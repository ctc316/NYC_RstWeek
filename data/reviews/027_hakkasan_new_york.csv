5.0,4/13/2019,"This is an EXPERIENCE. Not just a restaurant. Swanky marble and intricate geometric patterns decorate this hidden gem, which feels like a maze and palace all at once. Fine dining with the service to match, accommodated 8 of us with a multi course experience. We shared more than I can list appropriately, from the scallops (highly recommend), vegetarian and seafood dumplings, beef and mango chicken, pork tenderloin as well as fried rice. The portions are smaller than other places but so good and rich it isn't necessary to order a lot. We ordered too much and left full but not stuffed. Great variety for vegetarians, pescatarians (moi) and carnivores alike, truly impressive dining. Fine wine menu with a plethora of options, and same for those looking for whisky or imported liquor. Truly international bar, I tried the shoju based Cha butterfly (see photo). Recommend the Green Destiny with cucumbers over the cha butterfly, even though both are beautiful.",1,1,1,Alexandra R.,"New York, NY",522,131,111

3.0,4/8/2019,"The food was good but not worth the price. Got the ""Whole"" peking duck but it looked more like half a duck. Asked the waitress about it and she nomchalantly replies ""it's a small duck"". No matter how small, doesn't a duck still have two legs? How is it that it only comes with one drum?

2.0,3/26/2019,"First, the good part: the restaurant is gorgeous and very clean (even the restroom is immaculately clean).  It looks stylish and it's great for business meetings and dates...for those who don't mind the mediocre food.The service is adequate for the price point but not particularly friendly or attentive.The food is where this restaurant falls apart.  I don't care how much my meal costs so long as the cost matches with the quality of the meal.  I don't mind spending $1,000 for a solo dinner at Atera or Masa.But I do mind paying higher than usual prices for mediocre food.  The dim sum lunch consisted of items that tasted like they were pre-cooked a couple of hours before lunch time and kept lukewarm in a warmer of some type.  This was especially true for the stir-fried udon noodles, which was borderline cold.  The half peking duck that I ordered was about a quarter-duck size when compared to other peking duck places.  But it cost $58, which is what most places will charge you for a whole duck.  But it's not the portion that I really minded.  The quality of the duck was unacceptable at this price point.  The duck meat was lukewarm and dry.  The skin was more leathery tough than crispy.  The pancakes were brittle and old-tasting.  At least the cucumber and scallion slices were adequate.If you want to enjoy drinks with expensive but mediocre dim sum in a stylish setting, this is a place for you.  If you are looking for great food, look elsewhere.",2,0,0,Joseph S.,"Hartsdale, NY",2,121,0

The menu is slightly different at each one but their signature dishes can still be found, some vary based on location (duck salad).Once again the staff exceeds all expectations and the servers are extremely knowledgeable.Dim sum platter at Hakkasan is one of my favorite things EVER!!!

The service staff were friendly enough and I liked the interior of the restaurant. It's located in a very hot spot in town as well. The food was decent for the price you. The dishes I enjoyed the most were the veg dumplings and the dessert dumpling. However, one thing to really note is the portions are TINY and OVERPRICED. Seriously, the ratio of food you get per dollar spent is absurd, even by NYC standards. Overall, a decent food experience. Company was great which saved the night for me.

3.0,2/12/2019,The decor and the bar is top notch. Accommodating reservations and welcoming hostess. Some really good cocktails and the bartenders knew their stuff. The main course was nothing special. Rib eye was super chewy and hard. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and most of them were greasy or ok. Basically not Buddakan quality but definitely Buddakan prices. For dessert we had the pot of gold and it was REALLY GOOD. I cant remember which cake my friend had but I ate most of it when she went to the bathroom and it was really good too. I'll still do 3 stars because the drinks and the desserts made it up for the food.,0,0,0,Dom D.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",168,29,0

We ordered the 'The Hakka' which had the vodka, passion fruit and amongst other  stuft, the lychee!! Total win!! Was really tasty and we did order 2nd rounds. For the appetizers, we got the vegetarian dumplings and the mushroom lettuce wrap. Dumplings were great but the mushroom dish was something very unique and was very flavorful and crunchy from the  pistachios!! Would highly recommend to add it to your must order list!For the main course, we got some chicken dish and I ordered a veg chicken in black pepper sauce and three mushroom stir fry. The highlight of the evening was the veg chicken. Even my non veg friends were saying about how well made it was!! WIN!!!

We arrived on time and were seated fairly quickly, but then it all went downhill from there. It took forever to get our drinks (even after we asked several times about them), we didn't get hand towels even though everyone around us did, our waitress was rude and abrasive, dessert was terrible, and the manager or whoever was closing the restaurant literally was rushing and pushing us out at 12:30am on a Saturday night bc the cleaning crew was waiting to come in! She was yelling at us to leave! ""Oh so I have to sit around and wait until 3am when you decide to leave"" was said to us at 12:30 as we're putting on our coats.

4.0,1/25/2019,"My first Hakkasan experience was in London many years ago. They are probably the only option for decent Dim Sum in UK.  Glad to see that they are in NYC.Dim Sum in the NYC location is good, they serve it as a sampling platter instead of individually ordered.  It's definitely much higher quality than ones you can get in Canal, Brooklyn or Flushing Chinatown.  However, this comes with a premium  though well worth it.  I like the discreet entrance and the decor inside.  Great for bringing clients to impress.  And it's location is great for access within Manhattan.Other than Dim Sum, their Cantonese style dishes are also great.  I especially like their steam bass and stir fried lobsters.  Also Peking duck is awesome here.",0,0,0,JM H.,"McLean, VA",1,24,0

4.0,1/8/2019,"I came here with my friend for New York Restaurant week, so we got to avoid paying the high costs that this restaurant usually comes with. We got the 3 course lunch for $25 per person.The interior of this restaurant was very well decorated, and had a very good atmosphere. However, it's very dimly lit. We got the steamed dim sum plate and the fried dim sum plate as our first course. The presentation of the food is awesome, and our dim sum looked really good. There were a variety of colorful dumplings and oddly shaped dumplings. Then for the main course, we ordered duck with green beans, bok choy, and a spicy shrimp dish. The dim sum plates looked pretty, but tasted average. It kind of tasted like the dumplings that you can find at any other dim sum restaurant. The har gow (shrimp dumpling) was really good, and I also really liked the duck and green beans, especially the flavor of the duck. I only wished that there was more duck! The bok choy in garlic also tasted delicious, and we almost finished the whole thing between the two of us. Lastly, for dessert, we got this chocolate mousse cake with 24k gold flakes on top, with a small side of green tea ice cream. The gold flakes kind of freaked me out at first, but it ended up being really good, albeit a little small. We ended up getting a lot more food than we expected, and it was surprisingly very filling. Although, I don't think it would be the same for people with bigger appetites. I would definitely not pay full price for this place, but it might be a good idea to try this place out when there are special promotions like restaurant week.",2,0,3,Allison L.,"Seattle, WA",342,58,69
5.0,1/5/2019,"Hakkasan has a very discreet entrance, similar to that of a private club. A long corridor with candles and burning incense directs customers to the reception. The restaurant is much larger than I expected, with several small dining rooms. The service is impeccable and unobtrusive. We took the £138 Signature menu and we were delighted with it. The dim sum platter was delicious. The following courses were all just as scrumptious, especially the grilled Chilean sea bass with Chinese honey, the grilled lamb chops, the stir-fried ribeye in a Merlot sauce and the wok-fried Boston scallop. The wine list is extensive and we were told by fellow diners that the sake was excellent. HaKassan is definitely worth a visit!",0,0,0,Alex L.,"New York, NY",31,58,0
4.0,1/2/2019,"I'm surprised to see that it has such a low rating. Perhaps it is not the best Chinese restaurant in NYC but obviously it is a better restaurant than most Chinese restaurants here. Sanpei chicken is the best among all I have had. The problem might be that it is not Cantonese as probably stated elsewhere. It is more of a mixture of east Chinese dishes. Though the names of the dishes is quite Cantonese, the flavor is more like Shanghainese dishes. But it is worth better eval",0,0,0,Yan Z.,"Jersey City, NJ",345,19,25

2.0,12/25/2018,"Every year we always go to Hakassan for Christmas Eve dinner. With the exception of the waiter (Steve) who was great, this dinner was beyond disappointing. First, they have taken so many signature items off of the menu. First, we noticed that there was no more fried soft shell crab app which is my daughter's favorite (and on the Miami location menu).  Manager came over and apologized and tried to upsell a lobster entree dish at 60.00 when the issue was the appetizer.  Later ,we noticed other items were missing. Steve (our waiter) said he would ask the manager to come back and explain the changes. Manager never came back over (given that we are repeat customers) and he knew how disappointed we were and never even checked back at our table. We proceeded to order shanghai dumplings which were mediocre at best and stir-fry jumbo prawns which the sauce was similar to any szechuan take-out but 50.00. I don't mind spending money if the food is worth it.  The only good thing was the peking duck and spring onion fried rice.  The bill at the end - $200.00 before tip.  Rather than be the ""rude customer"", we just paid and walked out. On the way out, we saw the Manager again standing next to the host podium - didn't say one thing other than Happy Holidays... and he knew the situation.  I understand that Hakassan recently underwent a change in management.  Not sure that they've gone through proper customer service training.  Our tradition is over.

The picture attached are basically all the food we got except a plate of veggie and a plate of salad. We were very disappointed at the dessert. We received 3 baskets of macaroons and 3 ice cream balls for all the six sets we ordered . Like wtf????? One of the basket is free because we did check in so the dessert for six sets of a Michelin Star Restaurant is 2 baskets of macaroons and 3 scoops of ice cream? That's just cheap but the price isn't.

The club feel comes from the suited guy at the door and its velvet ropes - which are used for... well I don't know.I go to the NY location simply because there are not a lot of good restaurants around Times Square and Hakkasan at least is comfortable and has a festive feel to it plus its not overrun by tourists.The food is okay but its not going to wow many people, however if you know what to order and like dumplings then good food can be found at Hakkasan.

My mom is visiting from another country and she was so excited for having a great experience at your restaurant due to I explained to her and told her that your place is known by their great service and exquisite food. It supposed to be the first time of all of us at your venue. Unfortunately everything change as soon we arrive to the restaurant. We arrived 10 min prior to our reservation time, we were invited by the hostess to wait at the end of the bar. We sat where we were told, then another hostess came to move us to another area of the bar, kind of uncomfortable, but is ok. Then when the bartender approach to us and hand us the cocktails and drinks menu, he ask to my sister her ID (which is understandable, we know the rules of NY), my sister kindly showed him her driver license from our country (my sister is 22 y/o), the bartender immediately says that he cant accept that, and he needs a passport. My sister doesn't carry her passport with her, she is international student and she never haven't had a issue in other venues/bars/nightclubs showing her driver license which is a international valid document. I ask him to please ask to the manager and double check with him/her; the bartender agreed and within 2 min he comes back and says that it MUST BE THE PASSPORT. So, clearly we won't be able to celebrate and we won't stay at the restaurant knowing that my sister won't be able to enjoy the experience with us, we decided to leave the place right away and go to another place where we CAN enjoy without any ridiculous rules.

Being a big whiskey guy, I thought these were tasty and strong without being too overly sweet or muted.Only cons I could see is their usage of a regular spoon for Xiao long bao and generally that the prices are high, but considering the expensive real estate cost and quality of ingredients to make the food and drinks I get it.

3.0,10/21/2018,"This NYC outpost of the London Original is good but doesn't compare to its Hanway Place counterpart. Having recently dined in London, it was easy to compare the 2 locations. We arrived at 4:30 following a matinee in the theatre district and were politely told we could indeed have a cocktail at the bar before sitting for our early bird 5pm reservation. The bar itself is as grand as the Hanway location and seemed to be decorated similarly. The cocktails did not disappoint either. The Chinese Mule and the Smokey Mezcal Margarita were spot on. I ordered some fresh mint tea which was incredible, literally fresh herbaceous and steaming hot... hit the spot on a cool fall day. We were seated promptly and our bar tab was transferred to our table where a beverage specialist came to take orders and answer any questions on the wine list. She wasn't super informative or exciting to talk to about the lengthy and somewhat impressive wine list. But alas we settled on a $140 bottle of Sancerre...which was by all accounts quite good. We started with assorted dim sum. I didn't taste but the others at my table seemed to enjoy. They were quite beautiful to look at. We opted for the chicken clay pot entree, the sweet and sour pork tender loin, the crispy duck salad, the lotus root vegetable, spicy prawns and some fried rice. The crispy duck salad was the biggest disappointment. It lacked the flavorful punch and wonderful textures we expected from our experience in London and worse, the duck wasn't actually crispy. The chicken looked sumptuous but was all dark meat which didn't appeal to me. The spicy prawns were flavorful and yummy. The vegetable and rice were also quite good. But the star of the show was supposed to be the sweet and sour pork. This one was much saucier than the one we had in London and the pork was in large pieces vs the smaller crispier bites we remember just a few weeks ago. It wasn't as sophisticated a dish and just kind of reminded me of American Chinese food. Such a bummer. We were full and passed on dessert. Service was fine and attentive but nothing particularly special. The staff in London was really something-professional but full of personality and this location just seemed to lack that. The decor is somewhat similar but hands down the sexy subterranean location in London wins any day of the week. Prices are similar but for what it costs, I expect fabulous and this was simply just good. Given it's convenient location and proximity to Broadway, I can see why it's popular. For me, I will venture back for another go when I find myself in town for theatre again.

4.0,9/25/2018,"i had dinner here on friday night last week. the interior is a lot nicer than the exterior. the service was great (hostess, waiter, waiter's assistant/whoever delivered the food, and the new bar manager). the area is my least favorite part of manhattan (near times square) but happy that my train home was very close.i was not in love with the food, but i hardly eat fried food. i also don't care for sauteed food, so most of the menu was not an option. i can't find what i ordered on the online menu, but i had a chicken dish that was steamed with some kind of sweet soy sauce. the chicken was mostly tender, but some pieces were a little dry. i also had one cocktail called serpent's tongue. it comes with black pepper and i asked for the drink without it, but my drink came with it anyway. i asked for a new one and received it soon after. i was charged at the end for two drinks, but it was quickly removed once it was pointed out. the drink was strangely good. i had asked for something similar to japanese whiskey, which i tried at another restaurant and loved. this wasn't the same, but i see why it was close enough to be recommended.my sister and friend ordered a lot more food: dim sum mixed platter (2 of 3 types were good), wagyu beef (they said was incredible), bok choy (good), and some kind of fish marinated in a spicy orange sauce (also very good). they were stuffed and happy. my friend ordered sake & said it was the best she ever had. the three of us then split the macaroons. i was disappointed they didn't have chocolate, but they did get clever with the flavors. the best was green tea (or some other kind of tea). there was also a vanilla flavor (i liked this despite nor liking vanilla) & a mango flavor (don't recommend).i recommend trying this spot if you've been curious. just be prepared for the $. i spent about $70 for my one entree, one cocktail, and splitting the macaroons. my sister & friend spent around $120 each or a little more.",1,0,0,Letizia V.,"New York, NY",0,50,0
3.0,9/25/2018,"I generally try not to take price into consideration when deciding ratings, but for a place like Hakkasan, the price cannot be ignored. For a dinner that'll probably set you back $100 a person, you'd probably expect more--maybe even expect to have some of the best Chinese food you've ever had. Sadly, this is far from the case.When I came here, we ordered most of the signature Hakkasan dishes. Going through them, the Dim Sum Sampler (steamed) was okay, but for ~$4 a piece, it's depressing to think that I can get a plate of much better at many restaurants for a little more than the cost of one piece. The Pork Ribs were nothing special... would recommend that you pass on that and don't get drawn in by the Jasmine tea flavoring, and the Pork Belly Claypot was really just a fatty mess. The Tofu, Aubergine, and Mushroom pot was okay, but honestly, it didn't stand out from a crowd of already mediocre dishes.There were some highlights though; the Crispy Duck Salad was very good and featured a unique combination of ingredients that worked really well together. The Stir Fry Black Pepper Beef Ribeye in Merlot was also pretty good (definitely could taste the quality of meat), but at $38, you're left with much to be desired.I also got a Cha Butterfly cocktail for myself, which was probably the most reasonably priced thing (for NYC at least) at $15, and that wasn't bad either.Sitting in the restaurant, it's clear that you're paying a high premium for the ambience and service. The lighting is designed to showcase the effort put into the display of the dishes, and a lot of the time, that works in their favor. Unfortunately, the food is far from on par with the rest of the experience in my opinion.I sincerely believe that Chinese cuisine can and deserves to be elevated beyond everyday Americanized Chinese take-out, and places like Cafe China I feel like capture this idea pretty well. But I would not recommend that you go to Hakkasan to try and find it unless you're mainly looking to impress some folks who don't care that much about how good the food is.",1,0,0,Michael Z.,"New York, NY",454,165,358

The lobster pot was good but very overpriced for what it was. (Also very spicy and we weren't warned). For main course we had the small Peking duck skins called duck patai which was beautiful crispy skin on pieces of duck with the normal accompaniments of green onion and cucumber as well as hosein sauce.

Steam rolled out of my mouth from the first few bites. $14 Shanghai potstickers with chicken and shrimp, hot, crispy, served with chili sauce. Good if you're a fan of potstickers. They're honestly potstickers, not the actual pan fried Shanghai dumplings. Staying in Midtown means I'm a bit away from Chinatown.

Unfortunately, while it was a solid experience, the NYC version did not quite measure up. The decor is interesting, but the interior space is so vast and fragmented that it is hard to absorb whatever the intended effect was supposed to be (though the vastness does make it extremely easy to get a reservation). The service was highly professional, but somewhat indifferent/distant. The waiter was able to discuss the menu in detail and make some helpful suggestions (although he did give a bit of a hard sell to the expensive Peking duck dish). On basics, like refilling water and checking in after the food was served, the service fell a bit short. The food was very good, but not as good as I remember from San Francisco.

Restaurant is split into a pretty large bar area and then dining room with partitions.Food authenticity is somewhere between PF Chang's and your local favorite Chinese restaurants in Flushing or China Town.  However, the restaurant makes up for some slips in authenticity with unique contemporary spins on some of the dishes and overall beautiful presentation.  Probably on the the best plate preparations I have seen for Chinese food.Highly recommend taking the Chinese family style approach to ordering dishes so that you can try multiple dishes and have a good balance of meat, vegetable, and carb elements.  Appetizer - had the chicken and lettuce wraps, steamed and fried dim sum.  Chicken and lettuce and great flavor and liked how they are prepared into bitsized portions.  The steamed and fried dim sum was very good - not out of this world, but very very good for a non-dim sum restaurant.  The shrimp dumpling in particular was very well executed.Entrees - we ordered a mix of curry shrimp, pepper ribeye steak, 3 cup chicken, fried rice, fried noodles, and the Peking duck.  All very good - but favorites are definitely the pepper ribeye steak and the Peking duck.  Only complaint would the wraps on the Peking duck are a bit thick, however, the skin and meat on the duck are prepared very well with the skin crispy and meat tender.  We got lucky and were able to snag the last duck for that night - I assume this is quite a popular dish to order.Perfect restaurant for a larger party which plans on heading to bars and clubs afterwards.  Fun, modern, and great food - will be back.",4,0,1,Stephen C.,"Cincinnati, OH",123,109,567

As we ordered our appetizers and entrees, he would point out certain dishes that contained nuts and was accommodating in making them nut free. However, by the time dessert came, he seemed to have forgotten this life-threatening detail of my nut allergy and spaced out when I ordered the lemon pot. Two bites into the lemon pot I had a suspicion that there were nuts in the granola. I asked the waiter when he came back if he was sure that there were no nuts in it. He was flustered and said he had to go to the kitchen to check. He came back and said ""There are almonds in the crumble, but no where else in the dessert. You are good to eat everything in the lemon pot except for the crumble"" This response shows Hakkasan's lack of allergy training.

The food we ordered was Peking duck, crab shell, the dim sum plate, and a plate of vegetable. The dim sum plate was very ""creative"", with one had a pepper flavor mimicking the sour spicy soup. I understood it was unique, but seriously, the ingredient was cheap and not suitable for dim sum. The shrimp dim sum was made with minced shrimp and the flavor of sauce covered the flavor of shrimp.   The dim sum plate was certainly pretty on pictures, but the taste was mediocre. To order pecking duck was also a wrong choice in a Cantonese restaurant. For Peking duck, the work is not done when you finish cooking the duck. It still has a lot of requirement of how it is served. Each piece of the duck was cut too thick, which was too cheesy for a single pancake. The amount of cucumber and scallion were way less than needed as a companion.  The jasmine rice tasted so dry and cheap, which normally Chinese don't eat. The environment was very noisy, with a bar near around and loud music, not fitting the style.

The entrees included (1) honey black cod, which was very good and not overly sweet, (2) curry shrimp, also good, (3) chicken curry, this was okay, and (3) snow peas, which were okay. The fried rice was surprisingly good. Lastly, the desserts weren't awesome but I also don't like sweets so I'm not the right person to pass judgment on these. Overall, it was a good dinner.

4.0,6/22/2018,"After visiting the Hakkasan in Mayfair, London - we were excited to try the nyc one. As with our previous visit, interior and ambience didn't disappoint. We had booked a table online the day before and were seated as soon as we got there. Place was busy. We ordered dim sum platter for starters, Peking duck and spicy prawns for mains. Husband ordered a cocktail, waiter recommended a new special (not on menu) which he thoroughly enjoyed. Water was already refilled promptly. Piping hot dim sum starters were delivered immediately. Delicious! after we finished the starter, waiter said duck would take ""5-8 minutes"" which we thought was very precise haha unfortunately it took more like 30 minutes- which was fine as we needed time between courses but I don't understand why he felt the need to say that. Duck was disappointing as it wasn't hot and came out cut up - not what I had in mind. After finishing the duck we got our prawn dish- this was piping hot and delicious. We were stuffed and had no room for dessert. Bill was quite high but that's to be expected in such a venue. If I go back I Won't be ordering the duck again - for over 80 usd it was underwhelming. There was another whole duck on the menu that was over 200usd.. that might be the one everyone else seems to be raving about in the reviews.",0,0,0,Nani K.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,19,7

The restaurant is very large and could be about anyplace in the world (apparently, they are everyplace in the world). It's pretty loud in there, but the hosts changed my table farther away from the bar area. The portions are small, the prices are a bit high and they use a little more oil than I'd like...but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.

There was no choice of dessert and it was the free macaroons they offer on yelp. Complete waste of money. Really disappointed.

We arrived early for our reservation and were seated at a very nice table. Someone came by and asked what kind of water we wanted, but then...nothing. We watched as other tables ordered and received food, but still nothing. Finally we flagged down a woman who looked like she might be a manager, and she took our order. But instead of asking a server to come by and introduce themselves, we had haphazard service the whole night. After flagging the manager down on multiple occasions to receive missing portions of our meal, there was no attempt to explain or apologize. It was as if they truly did not understand that the service was terrible.That said, the food was very good. Vegetable dim sum, a signature dish, was outstanding. Spicy shrimp was great.

The largest pieces have a ton of almost raw rat that is impossible to chew. When I posted pointed this out to the staff they told me I was wrong and this is how they always make it. The rest of the skin was not very crispy. Plus they charge you extra for white rice. At $88 for picking duck it was absolutely not worth it. They also forgot the fourth dish in my party, it took an extra 20 minutes after the rest of the dishes arrived to make to the table, no apologies at all from the staff.

2.0,4/21/2018,"Going to have to give this restaurant 2 stars because of the awful service we experienced here. We came here on a Friday night with a reservation for 8:30. We showed up right before 8:30 and the hostess told us to have a seat in the lounge / bar area because it would be a few minutes before we could be seated. She told us they were still preparing the table. Twenty or so minutes later, we were a bit confused and asked the hostess again when our table would be ready. She apologized and said she would ask and get back to us and never got back to us. At this point we had been waiting for over a half hour and we tried asked someone else how much longer it would be; at this point we were very frustrated. This was the second person who told us she would ""ask"" and never returned to us with an answer. After 45 minutes of waiting, we asked to see a manager and complained about how we had asked multiple people for time updates only to be completely ignored. It almost seemed as if the people we had asked earlier were purposefully avoiding us. It took a reservation, 50 additional minutes of waiting, conversations with multiple hostesses, a lot of complaining, and a request speak to the manager until we were seated. Once seated, the manager finally came to speak to us and offered our party of 3 champagne and apologized. This did not at all really make up for the long wait and rudeness we had experienced from the hostesses. To be fair, the food was very good, although a bit on the pricey side. We ordered two plates of steamed dim sum (one vegetarian and one with seafood options), the Crispy Silver Cod, the Chilean Sea Bass, and an order of Egg and Scallion fried rice. We were happy with the meal. When we were finished eating, we began conversing with The table right next to us who was complaining as well about how horrible the service had been. They too, along with at least 5 other parties we had witnessed, had been forced to wait 40+ minutes despite having a reservation. We were not the only party who had been extremely frustrated and disappointed with the horrible service we had dealt with at the beginning of the evening. Our waitress was friendly and our dining experience was good, although the table next to us noted that they were seated 5 minutes after us and by the time we had finished eating they had still not been served.

Moreover, I didn't expect it at all.When you enter, there is a long hallway with blue ""mood light,"" and my heart sank. It felt like another TAO-type scam. (For those who don't know, TAO is the overpriced and below-mediocre Asian ""fusion"" eatery in NYC that doubles as the only place where my party has been kicked out to make way for those who booked a later time slot. Apparently, it's United Airlines, American, Frontier Airlines, and TAO who are into this.) And yes, you'll pay for a little of that internal decor with the pricing and not-great P2P (price to portions) ratio.So why a #MERLINFIVE? Two words: THE PEKING DUCK (not counting the article there). The stuff is perfectly sliced, with just the right mix of fatty and lean pieces and skins. No hair on the skin, which is a problem with cheap crispy duck. Pancakes are abundant, and they don't skim, unlike a lot of places. And P2P on it is excellent. You will blow the bank, but it's one of the few things where you won't regret it.Other good dishes: fried dumplings, dim sum sampler, and sichaun tofu. They're great, but P2P is ""problematic."" Still, I'm giving this place a #MerlinFIVE because the duck is THAT good.Skip desserts and go to Junior's.

The ambiance is very cool, with lots of nice Chinese architecture with a modern twist. The menu looked really good, but a little pricey of course. However, we settled on the prix fix restaurant week menu of one appetizer, one entree, and a dessert for $42/person. We both ordered the dim sum platter as our appetizer, which came with three different types of dumplings. They tasted different than what I would normally eat at dim sum, aside from the shrimp dumpling. The presentation was nice.Next, I ordered the chicken in a clay pot while my friend ordered a vegetarian chicken dish. Both were great! The chicken in a clay pot was a bit too sweet, but it tasted good. It had a Thai twist to it with the basil. The vegetarian chicken dish tasted exactly like chicken! However, the snap peas were a bit raw. Some people like their snap peas raw though. Our entrees came with a side of bok Choi which was really good.For dessert, we had the option of a tropical dish or sorbet. My friend and I ordered one each. The sorbet was well, sorbet. Nothing exciting. But the tropical dessert was very delicious, mixing coconut sorbet and coconut whipped cream with orange jelly almost. Quite a refreshing taste. The service was good. It did take them a little while before taking our orders, but for the most part everyone was very friendly. They did not let me pay with ApplePay but I understand that restaurants are not that up-to-date with their tech.This was definitely a fun experience.

The vegetarian steamed dim sum platter included morel crystal dumplings, bamboo dumplings, lotus beancurd rolls, and chive flower dumplings which all tasted unique and savoury.The stir-fry mushroom, pistachio and pine nut wraps were crunchy and refreshing. I also really liked their preparation of asparagus, yam bean, tofu and shimeji (a type of mushroom) in a slightly sweet and rich Szechuan sauce. My only gripe, as many would agree, is that the prices are a bit stretched up for the dishes. However, it is worth trying for the experience and the relatively unique menu they offer compared to the usual Americanized Chinese fare.",1,0,2,Pooja S.,"New York, NY",201,102,77

1.0,1/1/2018,"If I can give them a ZERO I would. I must share this with everyone. I had reserved a table for 25 guests for my wife's baby shower and requested for appetizers to be on the table so as my guests arrive there would be food to eat. Not only did they not have appetizers to eat but they insisted that my guests arrive first before they would have started. So I have a pregnant wife with a few couples and kids there no place to sit and no food to eat, I was livid and was assured things were being cooked for us. An hour and thirty minutes go by and we finally get seated. Well I raised up the issue after I was handed a check for over $5000 and was offered a coupon to return and overlook that nights terrible experience. So here we are now 2 years later when I am in the area we decided to stop in and use the coupon well guess what after the dinner they told me that management has changed and they were not going to honor the $400 coupon after I showed them proof via the many conversations with the General Manager. They told me that I had ""a time limit to use the credit"" or that I had to let them know that I had such s credit before coming to dine. You expect to fine dine and spend your money at a high end restaurant you should expect to not only have good food but get the level of service as a customer you deserve and have a restaurant honor their coupons or gift certificates.

We had one of our favorite Chinese meals at Hakkasan in Mayfair London with phenomenal food and service.This location in NYC is a disgrace to the brand, maintains the high prices but food and especially service leaves a lot to be desired. The waiters were pretty poor, large teams but no one had a clue about service or their dishes and very off handish. Lead waiters were the worst.Didn't help that they provided macaron basket for anniversary and then tried to sneak on a charge for it with no apology for the mess up.The Hakka drink was great and presentation of food exquisite especially dim sum and macaron basket.

4.0,12/16/2017,"Crab and corn soup tasted like egg drop soup with corn but even better. Plentiful and large soft pieces of crab blended nicely with the soup. The Hakkasan steamed dim sum was amazing. Each side sauce was spicier and better than the next, one even had shrimp flakes. Don't be a hero, use the spoon and not the chopsticks because they will fall apart.  They were all great, but shrimp shumai was the best. The Hakkasan fried dim sum was incredibly filling but so glad we got it. One was like a granulated shrimp filled empanada. The other was shaped like a pumpkin and had bean paste. The third had the best fried crust ever. I have no idea what was in it. The Prawn Toast has tails that dissolve in your mouth. I really love shrimp, so more granulated shrimp is a good thing. I tasted the foie gras in some bites -was super subtle. My absolute favorite dish was the Crispy Prawn. The best granulated shrimp deep fried and breaded ever in best duck sauce ever. Should make four for easier sharing, it came with three and the top edible branches are pretty. It make it hard to share.  The Soft shell crab is interesting, it stays hot, the stuff around it has nuts and curry and a fuzzy texture. No actual shell. I'm not going to lie, by the time it came out I was getting full. The black pepper ribeye is buttery soft, has a lot of garlic and curry in it and the cellophane noodle shell was good. The Egg and onion rice was not outstanding, but when mixed with the black pepper ribeye and the soft shell crab fuzzy stuff the tastes complemented each other well. For dessert I tried the Passion fruit. It's actually a piece of small chocolate cake with passion fruit in it, on top of it, and next to it. It also came with some sort of ice cream. Each item separately was great, but together not amazing. As for service, the waiter aimed to please and was patient with us. The manager greeted us and checked in with us which was respectful. Service was slow at all tables and not just ours, I think it is just a thing.",1,0,0,Ursula K.,"Manhattan, NY",89,55,56
2.0,12/11/2017,"Great experience for DMV enthusiast at the start. We waited way too long to get seated 1 hr with a reservation. I was unaware that this wait was a part of the restraunt experience as our unapoligetic waiter kindly enlightened me. As part of this restaurant experience they like to let you sit alone and wait for along time without any contact as not to disturb you as you find your pre-meal Zen.  Usually I welcome Waiter advice at a new restaurant, but when I said no multiple times, I was glad he informed me that my order was incorrect and that he knew what I should order. See another part of the experience is that some parts of the menu are just there for a joke. Luckily if you accidently pick the joke items the waiter will kindly direct you to the real items on the menu. If this guessing part excites you please stop reading now because I am about to tell you how to read the menu sans guessing. If you look at any item under $26, those are all joke items and you will quickly learn that if you accidently ask for it. Another great aspect is that you dont know for sure what part of your orders you will get. So even if you follow the  golden rule, you still get a surprise based on whether or not your food comes at all. All in all It was delicious, but the headgames became tedious. The  rest of the service was great besides some of the corrections we recieved and the extra waiting.

But it's plenty fancy though, so more likely than not you'll at least feel like you got what you paid for...Better yet, the food here is actually very, very good. We had some very delicate dim sum classics, re-imagined, that may or may not actually exist on their regular menu (so describing them may defeat the purpose). But suffice to say, this place is really good and you'll get the full michelin-star service.

5.0,12/8/2017,"One of my favorite spots in Manhattan especially to bring out-of-towners. A seemingly unsuspecting door on a dark random street, when you first walk into the restaurant you realize you are visiting somewhere special. A white long hallway leads you to the hostess who will then revel the enormous, well-lit space decorate minimally but very tastefully. The menu, Asian, is expansive and will have a multitude of options for vegetarians, pescaterians, and meat-eaters. I recommend the dumpling appetizers, spring rice, and vegetarian chicken. Definitely try the floating goddess drink as well. One con is that service is slow. The restaurant is understaff so expect to wait for your food and definitely for your drinks (I always tell the people I'm with to order their next drink when they are half-way through their current drink because that's how long it takes to arrive). The restaurant is on the pricier side- expect to spend at least $50 per person for dinner and a drink. Also, good for large groups.

2.0,12/3/2017,"Everything was to terrible that we wondered how they got the Michelin star to begin with. Upon asking, found out they changed owner a few years ago. No wonder the quality of both food & service was not up to par for an upscale restaurant like this. Staff so inexperienced, even Mgr was awkward, not knowing how to deal with his staff kept bumping in the back of my seat all evening. They should have trained their staff better; most of them don't speak English. Our white waiter (the bald young guy) snuck up on me, whispering in my ear, startling me each time. And when I turned around to face him, he didn't step back, just got in my face staring at me, a bit creepy. He had no concept of respecting personal space. Don't get me started on the food. The steamed dumplings were so overcooked they came out soggy, yuk. We tried almost everything except that overpriced Peking duck with caviar (almost almost $300). The only good dish we ate was the pork belly clay pot. Everything was below average and WAY over charged. Don't waste your money.

Immediately after appetizers (we weren't even done) dinner was ready and our drinks showed up. They had no idea how to serve.

2.0,11/5/2017,"Dined here on a quiet Sunday evening with my boyfriend.Being Michelin star rated, I expected an excellent dining experience start to finish; unfortunately the restaurant did not deliver.The ambiance is on the nicer side, and the staff is friendly and tries their best. However, there were too many botches and inconsistencies that made what would otherwise have been a fantastic dining experience feel below average.The food was definitely above average; I especially recommend the Peking Duck. But, at $88 for just this dish, and the high prices overall, I expect exemplary service which you will not get here. For these prices, you can do a lot better. For example, we observed:- Lack of knowledge or recommendations about menu items - Both of our menus were dirty with bits of food and smudges- Very long 25 minute+ wait between courses- Sake cups removed when more than half of the flask had remaining sake- Ordered dessert wine alongside dessert which did not arrive until well after dessert was finished; apology was given that there was only one person handling the wine, which is unacceptable given the size of this restaurant.- Sake was listed on the menu with the serving temperature (cold/room/warm). After I put in my order, after waiting a while someone came back to ask what temperature I wanted it at.- Service was generally not attentive when it came to drink refills - wine/sake glasses were never refilled and- Not my direct experience, but worth noting that 2 tables adjacent to me had to send food back for combing out cold. The ladies sitting at the table next to me had to send back 2 dishes.It may sound like nitpicking, but keep in mind we paid $170/person for our food and drinks for 2 people. This is simply NOT the upscale dining experience you deserve for shelling out this kind of money. To summarize, the service is not polished and detracts from the overall experience. It makes the whole Michelin rating system come into question. The best description I found among Yelp reviews for this place which I agree with is that it is an upscale PF Chang's.

The whole place is not classy. In London people are dressed up and it's classy. A real nice night out. Here it's just a dimly lit Chinese restaurant with a Times Square tourist crowd. Very disappointing. 2. Pace of meal. Awful. We arrived and had a drink at bar. Good cocktails. Seated at 7.45pm and ordered right away. Our appetizer arrived within 10 mins, very tasty. Then a full 50 mins before the rest of the food!!! It arrived at 8.50pm!!! We were almost ready to just up and leave, but kept being reassured ""your entree is coming, your entree is coming..."". Finally the dishes arrived and apart from the spicy shrimp being cold, was tasty.3. Screw up with the payment. The waiters were attentive and nice. However, when we paid they brought out a credit card slip with somebody's (more expensive) dinner charged to my card!!! I pointed this out and no apologies, they just responded casually"" oh it's wrong"" and they re-ran my card for our correct amount, without giving me any slip showing a reversal, just ""oh, you should see the correction on your credit card on Monday"". Very amateurish and not what you'd expect for a $200 dinner for two. So apart from the food being tasty (if expensive but that was to be expected) the ambience and inept service killed it for me.

On food - we got a variety of dishes and I enjoyed all of them. The tofu/eggplant claypot was by far my favorite (tofu was amazing - super flavorful), but the lobster claypot, peking duck and lotus/asparagus dish were really great too. Lotus root retained its texture (almost like a crisp when you bite into it) vs being too soft, and the asparagus was also perfectly cooked. This dish was flavorful but still light, which was nice in contrast to the other dishes we had. The exotic fruit platter is also pretty generous / bigger than I expected (included watermelon, mango, a couple blueberries mostly for decoration ha, starfruit slices, asian pear slices, and figs I believe). The only thing I probably wouldn't order again is the dimsum platter - just not worth it for the price. Dimsum is dimsum at the end of the day, and I didn't feel like anything in this platter was all that special. Setting was also a pleasant surprise. It definitely feels like a lounge when you walk in, but the seating area feels warm, and while it's not a quiet restaurant, it's easy to have a conversation (we were a group of 5 and i could hear everyone in the party easily). Also I showed up in jeans and a tshirt and did not feel any judgment (e.g. casual is totally ok). Waiters were really nice/helpful, but will highlight that the service generally was a little slow (wait time between ordering and when food is served is a little longer). We were seated at 7 and didn't leave till 9:30pm on a Sunday (restaurant was busy, but not packed). All in all - good experience, albeit on the pricier side for Asian food (worked out to $100+ per person, we ordered ~1-2 drinks per person (though 1 was tea and 2 were mocktails), and 8 dishes total for 5 people).",3,0,1,Jessica T.,"Manhattan, NY",279,214,551

Has a  Cantonese menu which includes dishes inspired by local flavors and influences, created exclusively for New York, in addition to Hakkasan signature dishes and  contemporary desserts. Had the hot and sour soup with chicken and the Hakka steamed dim sum platter for starters. The platter had eight of the crab, shrimp and  scallop and duck dumplings which were just perfect to taste. Soup also was so delicious and just right amount of spices - none of the condiments was needed to add to it. Also tried their chicken clay pot, spicy prawns, egg and spring onion fried rice. The prawns were just okay but the other two dishes were highly satisfactory. Overall prefect and delicious food - flavor and spice wise. Presentation of the food was also beautiful. Had their passion fruit dessert which was a visual delight as well as perfectly tasteful.However, the same cannot be said about the service. We had to wait nearly an hour between our entrees and main course even though we had placed all the order together. Our server told us that they had a large group and so the service had become slow.

We ordered 2 ""small eats"" appetizers, 3 entrées and 2 desserts. The food presentation for all the dishes was beautiful and ""Instagramable."" For the appetizers, the Hakka steamed dim sum platter and stir-fry mushroom lettuce wrap. Both were flavorful and would definitely recommend. For entrées, we ordered the stir-fry Chilean sea bass with Sanpei sauce, Peking duck, and Hakka spicy seafood fried rice. Amazing as well. The spicy sea bass meat was nice and buttery. The duck entrée came with Mandarin pancakes, spring onion, cucumber and hoi sin sauce. The duck ""wraps"" were delicious and are what the restaurant is known for. The fried rice was pretty good as well but less impressive compared to the other dishes we ordered. For dessert, we ordered the Exotic fruit flatter and the Selection of house made macarons.

And then there was the amazing desserts - macarons, passion fruit and chocolate, lemon, and coconut.

To put it plainly, for Hakkasan's expensive side dish/entree/cocktail prices, the service and food quality isn't quite with it.",0,0,0,Stelios S.,"Norwalk, CT",158,92,224
3.0,8/5/2017,"Wildly overrated venue with unjustified prices. You go to Hakkasan for the classy atmosphere rather than the food bc in my opinion the food was average or just a little above average. Bottom line: salty and saucy. I went here during restaurant week and my friend and I ordered the prawns, and chicken entrees. Not that I minded but the prawns/curry sauce was quite spicy FYI. First off, I could tell from the first bite that I was going to drink like a fish after the meal. But maybe the overly sauced theme is typical of Chinese food? Not sure. Anyhow, their steamed and fried dumpling appetizers were at least creative and interesting to look at. Service: pretty attentive, slightly bordering on hovering as they passed by several times to try clearing dishes to which I caught on, and kept my fork in the dish. Aside from the OK food, the restaurant itself was gorgeous. From the entrance to the hallway into the restaurant to the restrooms, you'll be transported to some amazing place, totally uncharacteristic of its Times Sq location. The place is just lovely. Go if you must, but the food was not spectacular IMO.",0,0,0,Sunny C.,"New York, NY",103,169,106
5.0,8/5/2017,"It was my first time coming to Hakkasan. As soon as my mother and I walked into the restaurant, we felt as though we were transported to another place. The ambiance exceeded both of our expectations- it had accents of blue and white, and the restaurant was very dim. It gave off  a trendy vibe. The service was impeccable, as well. I ordered from the restaurant week menu; I ordered the steamed dumpling platter, which came with three dumplings cooked to perfection. For my entrée, I ordered the chicken clay pot. It was delicious, however, there were chili peppers in the dish, which made it extremely spicy. The dessert was a small mango cake, which was light and scrumptious.

2.0,7/29/2017,"Came here during restaurant week. We were the first few to be seated at 530 for dinner. Everything started out great and we placed our orders from the restaurant week menu. Drinks came in about 10-15 mins. During this time, the restaurant started filling up. We waited for another 15 mins for our first course to arrive. We had the steamed and fried dim sums and the green salad. This was by far the best part of the meal. After this,there was nothing for 30 minutes. 30 MINUTES! Everyone who came after us were already getting their main course and we had nothing. The server came by and apologized and still, nothing. We were out of drinks and had nothing in front of us. Finally the food arrived and we were famished. Also did I mention we were trying to make a 730 show? Unfortunately, only 3 out of 4 of us got our meal. Our friend told us not to wait and start without her, because the server said it was going to be out soon. It literally took them another 15 mins to bring her meal out. We were already almost done with our food. I was so embarrassed because I talked this place up and recommended this place, and the service left little to be desired. How is this a Michelin star restaurant? I can't even enjoy my food anymore. The server apologized again and said she'll take the one late meal out of the check. Halfway through the meal, one member of the party who had to make a 7pm show had to leave, and he didn't have time to get his dessert at all. The server sent him off with macarons but still, this would have happened if the meals were served in an appropriate time. The main courses were fine. Good,but I wouldn't call it Michelin star quality. The mango dessert was good and delicious, even though a member of my party disagreed and only took a bite. By this time we needed to get out of there. One member of the party had a gift card which she gave to the server WHEN WE ARRIVED and she said she applied it to the check. The check arrived and guess what, the gift card wasn't applied, the late main course the server said was going to be taken off was not taken off. We were rushing for time and didn't have time to argue, but my party was really unhappy and did not enjoy the meal. We just asked them AGAIN to apply the gift card, but was too embarrassed and pressed for time to ask about the main course deduction. We shouldn't be feeling this way leaving a Michelin star restaurant. It was such a disappointment. Needless to say, I'll be hard pressed to come back, which is a shame because I frequent the area a lot and was looking for spot to make my pre-theater spot. I will not recommend this place to anyone unless you have plenty of time to spare and if you are willing to fight for your right to good and efficient service. I was already disappointed with the meal, and for them to not take the main course out of the check when they said they would was just downright rude. Not coming back, not recommended. Way overpriced for okay food and slow slow service. I am also inclined to write to the Michelin guide about this.",0,0,0,Debbie T.,"New York, NY",390,9,0

4.0,7/3/2017,"Hakkasan is a lounge/restaurant. You can come here to grab a drink or to have a nice fancy dinner.

The lychee was a nice touch.I enjoyed the vegetarian dim sum platter and vegetarian chicken with black bean sauce the most. The little colorful dumplings were plump and flavorful. The vegetarian chicken tasted better than the regular chicken that I've had elsewhere. I never knew vegetarian options could be so delicious!The Chilean sea bass with honey was good. The outside was grilled with the right amount of crisp, and the inside was still juicy and easy to cut. The sauce resembled a light honey barbecue glaze. The pak choi was a nice side dish but pricey.The desserts were interesting and exquisite in taste and presentation. The passion fruit filling inside the chocolate box was a bit overpowering though with its tart/sourness. I enjoyed the black sesame dessert with mango sorbet more out of the two.All of the dishes came out promptly after ordering. None of them were too oily or too seasoned. The presentation of each dish was on par. You really have to take a look and notice the detailing that they put into their dishes, such as the flower petals and other edibles.

4.0,6/13/2017,"I've been here a few times now and the food is really very good. I've probably tried close to half the items on their pretty extensive menu and every one has been excellent. A couple words of caution - the food is very rich and not all portions are created equal. Some items, like the spring rolls, are enough to feed a family while others, like the cod, are portioned for two. I'd say most are like the cod. So, you have to order a lot of items here to leave satisfied - which is why I've tried most of the menu. And, by the way, rice is not included, so be sure to order separately. All this results in a pretty expensive meal. This place is not cheap!Service, though your waiter can occasionally be difficult to flag down, is also pretty good. Staff is constantly bringing dishes, clearing dishes, refilling water, topping off wine... So, while it's generally pretty attentive, it's also not a place for a relaxing romantic dinner. The vibe is a little like a fancy Vegas club. On the whole, I'm always happy to go here. The food is pretty amazing.",0,0,0,Neil A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,57,1
4.0,6/10/2017,"I was a frequent patron of Hakkasan Shanghai which housed fine huangjiu on their drinks menu. That was exclusive to the Hakkasan in Shanghai, so I knew that the NYC branch wouldn't have it, but you can find many of the dim sum favorites AND orange wines! I can't tell you how delicious orange wines are with a fatty meal like duck or dim sum. I came to Hakkasan NYC mainly for the drinks which I had was the Asian Pear cocktail made with baijiu. It was delicious, but too sweet. Would definitely have them tone down the sweetness next time. I definitely recommend Hakkasan for a date night because the music is never too loud, the place is spacious but a bit dark from all the dark wood furniture, so it's quite romantic.

I especially enjoyed their shrimp dumplings which were plump with fresh shrimp. The vegetarian renditions used chives, giving them a strong and delicious flavor. The spicy prawns and the steak were fine as well.You come here to say that you've finally been to Hakkasan. The food here is better than that of Tao and Buddakan.

4.0,4/17/2017,"This resturant was referred to me by my American Express travel agent and I had an opportunity to dine there recently. I am frequently in the mood for great Asian cuisine and Hakkasan did not disappoint. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the quality of the food. I experienced some really unique flavors too. The Sea Bass, which looked like a piece of Tuna when it came out, had a wonderful sweet caramelized glaze with what looked and tasted like a sear finish. While this is not how you would normally expect Sea Bass, one bite and it was clear why this is their #1 dish. The Prawns were equally tasty and were served in a unique spicy curry sauce. I was most impressed however, with their Duck! I was saving this dish for last when all of the dishes came to my table, because I love duck and have had it served in just about every way.  When my waiter saw that I had not tasted it 5 minutes into my meal she urged me to begin eating this dish before it got cold and after one bite I could easily see why. Simply WOW!  Words cannot express the overall flavorful explosion from this dish. This Duck was served in thin small one-inch pieces spread out on a plate in a rich sweet and savory brown sauce.  The meat was perfectly moist.  The skin was crackling crispy. And both parts together with that sauce was sinful. I have never tasted Duck so good in my life and this dish was so memorable, that I can't wait until I am back in The City to try it again. Service was good, not great, and for this reason I am giving a 4 star over 5. What a meal!",1,0,0,David B.,"Austin, TX",66,95,126
3.0,4/15/2017,"First of all, this restaurant is defined as a high end Asian restaurant, so stop playing the annoying and loud music. Secondly, the service cannot be rated as Michelin level. The environment is too loud and the sever for our table was  hanging around with other tables.However, the dishes and drinks here are inevitably delicious. We had stir-fried ribeye, lamb, duck and the crispy cod. The beef and lamb meat melt right into the mouth. Moreover, the duck meat comes with slices fat and slices of skin on the surface which improve the nature palatable taste of duck meat. For the drink, I tried Smoky Negroni and Green Destiny. Smoky Negroni is a special drink, because it is made with Grand Marnier smoke infusion which is creative but not palatable, but green destiny has woodsy taste and comes with kiwi crush inside.

After discussing the place with some Chinese friends of mine, they scoffed at the idea of turning a number of Chinese dishes into fine dining.  I will say that I ate some of the prettiest steamed and fried dim sum dishes at this place, but at the end of the day they tasted like the stuff I'd get off a cart in Chinatown... it makes sense since they are using the same ingredients (maybe of a higher quality, and by the hands of experts, but in the end all the same).  Nevertheless, if you have the money to burn, whether you just ball that way, or if you're looking to experience the place for yourself to prove me wrong, or if you mistake it for a nightclub and then end up eating there anyway, or if you're trying to impress a person with lady parts... then you could certainly do worse than this place.",1,0,0,Joshua V.,"New York, NY",16,97,397

Lost its Michelin star last year, Hakkasan nevertheless continued to impress me from both its inside decoration and food quality.We decided to kick off with the most renown steamed dim sum platter. Instead of focusing only on the taste (like all those ordinary Chinatown spots), Hakkasan did a really good job balancing out the color inside the platter - best presentation award! The fried prawn with foie gras carefully filled in and sesame covering its crust, was tender from the inside while crispy on the outside. Pork belly was the one that indeed impressed us - not at all greasy yet preserved its nature of softness, with just the right amount of scallions and garlic to bring out the flavor. Dessert was probably one of the best things you could enjoy at Hakkasan, if not the only one. We shared the chocolate dumpling with yuzu sauce pouring inside, serving as the broth. The sweetness was perfectly balanced out by the light touch of sourness from the yuzu soup, well done!I could not believe that this was my first visit to Hakkasan NY (well I've been to its SanFran location).

5.0,3/21/2017,"The large, heavy steel door of the entrance at Hakkasan lead to a whole new world of high quality Chinese food and service experience. I've always wanted to check this place out after hearing many things about it from friends, but didn't have a nice enough occasion to, and when it was my birthday, I finally had a good reason to come! Immediately upon entering, I was greeted by two friendly hostesses who lead me to my table. The restaurant has such interesting decor with dim, blue lights and chinese-inspired panels that sections off the booths and dining areas in the restaurant.In terms of what we ordered, we started off with louis roederer champagne, and ordered the steamed dimsum platter for our appetizer, and pipa duck, honey glazed sea bass, and spicy seafood fried rice for our entrees. The dim sum platter came with 4 different kinds of dim sum, all steamed to perfection.  All the different pieces were not only so pretty to look at, but also so flavorful and unique in flavor. My favorite was the har gow (white dumpling with shrimp). Next came the entrees which were all quite heavy but flavorful orders. The duck was cooked and fried(?) so well and if you wrap it in half of the flour shells with some cucumber and scallion and sauce, it's the perfect duck wrap! The seabass dish was SO tender and almost melted in my mouth. The outside was crispy and sweet while the meat of the fish was more bland so really balanced out the sauce which could be overwhelming. Lastly, the spicy seafood fried rice gave extra variety to our meal and was also very good filled with lots of seafood. We also received a plate of steamed greens which were surprisingly very delicious and paired perfectly with the heavy dishes. Sipping on champagne throughout the meal also helped keep the palate clean and not leave a greasy after taste.Since it was my birthday, the staff so wonderfully prepared dessert for me, and I got to try the yuzu desert. Not only was it so pretty to look at with the pretty spring shades of yellow and purple, but also delicious - citrus-y and very bright!I was overall very pleased with my experience at Hakkasan with the lovely waiters so attentive to my needs. I will say that they were a bit clumsy with handling the dishes and placing them on the table, but I was really excited about the food that it didn't bother me too much.

Warm reception, hostess was very friendly, took our coats, opened doors for us etc. Restaurant is a bit of a maze which makes it seem bigger than it is. Interior is dark, modern and sexy and obviously asian inspired. Lets start off with the biggest weakness of this restaurant. Which is why I can tell you they lost that michelin star. SERVICE..(at least on our visit). Don't get me wrong the staff was very attentive to our needs and friendly. BUT...I received my dish first out of 8 people. I waited until everyone had their meal....but that didn't happen. It took nearly 25 minutes for everyone to receive their main dish. I waited for 10 minutes and then said ""I better eat this before it gets cold."" Which is odd to be the only one eating out of 8 people for 25 minutes. I usually don't complain about these things, but waiting 25 minutes for everyone to receive their dishes while I received mine is unacceptable. They apologized profusely and said the kitchen was backed up and I get it, mistakes happen. In the end they made good, and comped us for our desserts, which is expected when there was that much of a delay for a big party.Food was very good, BUT not worth the high price of admission. I have no problems delving out money for a nice meal, but it was definitely not worth the high price tag. Like I said it was good, but nothing memorable or luring me in to come back. I had the crispy duck with black truffles, which was fantastic but not worth $60. This at most should have been a $40-$45 dish. Again, no issues with the food, it was done to perfection, BUT not worth that price. Also, the ribs I had as an appetizer was fantastic. Great flavors and melted off the bone. Desserts were great 10-10! Macrons, were perfect. We also had a fruit tray and a banana chocolate cake dish. Kudos. For me, this place is perfect for a celebration. It's different, its exciting, great looking crowd, interior is posh. Even though the price tag was more than it was worth, and the service was lacking that night, I would still recommend it. HOWEVER!!! I think you can do better. Not to mention names, but there is a similar restaurant in the meat packing district, where service is on point. We more than likely had a fluke night and the food was great, but it didn't wow me to come back.",0,0,0,Matthew S.,"Queens, NY",5,47,54
3.0,2/12/2017,"TLDR: DON'T COME HERE IF YOU DON'T LIKE SPICY FOOD.Apparently--and the waiter didn't explain this until after we ordered, sent back and reordered, and still couldn't eat it--""XO"" and ""superior"" mean spicy! The manager came over after the second time and promised to bring us something not spicy... and then never came back (and no food other was brought).Appetizers: The duck salad that others rave about was overrated. I did like the (rather expensive) steamed dim sum appetizer. Entrees: The duck noodles, and seafood clay pot are good if you like spicy things. Desert: The black sesame and chocolate dumplings were my favorite, but others who tried them thought they were too weird. The chocolate and caramel cremeux was a hit all around.I'd come back here again if I needed to eat in the neighborhood, but only with adults, and only with people who like spicy food.FULL REVIEW:I've been here twice. First time was a good experience, hence the second excursion, which really was not. The food is good--pricey for ""Chinese"" food, but this is not your usual $10 lunch special Chinese place. The ""bouncer"" outside (during regular dinner hours) comes off pretentious, and the decor is trying a bit hard, but it's all good as long as the food is good...The only problem that keeps this review down to 3 stars is that EVERYTHING IS SPICY. The second time I ate here (last week), I brought my sister and niece. Neither of them can eat spicy food. My sister asked the waiter very clearly to help her avoid spicy things on the menu and he told her the only spicy things on the menu clearly said ""spicy"" in the description. That's not even close to true. As I stated above, we asked specifically and repeatedly to avoid spicy food and it was a major fail. And they can't make something that is spicy not spicy, because all of their stuff is pre-mixed. The waiter talked to us like we should have known that XO and Superior meant ""extra spicy."" Am I missing something? All my life going to Chinese restaurants in NY, Miami and LA, I've never seen those terms.In the end, the waiter brought us a desert ""on him"", which was appreciated, but didn't make up for the experience.",0,0,0,B K.,"New York, NY",0,12,0

Dinner 3 course for NY restaurant week is $49 which is a great deal for this place as most dishes are around $30-40 each. One of the dishes was $228! It had caviar I think. We tried Sanpie chicken, Spicy Prawn, dim sum platter and for desserts we had sago pudding and choc/caramel special that they had on the menu(I've forgotten the name). The prawn and chicken are both high in salt and I would recommend that getting with plain rice rather than fried rice that we ordered. Having said that, the egg fried rice were absolutely delicious. Prawn is definitely recommended, the gravy was really good. Sago pudding was light and yummy. The ambience was good but we went on Monday and because of restaurant week, it was full house and very noisy. Decor is very nice. Their kitchen is the biggest I've ever seen and they have separate chefs for diff cuisines. The manager there took me for a little tour of kitchen just from outside and she told me all this.

3.0,1/28/2017,This place feels like a variation of TAO that's further uptown. Food is Asian fusion. The decoration is a style seeming to be getting popular in Manhattan. A lounge with heavy Chinese accent. Food are good but not great. The most outstanding dish we had was Beijing roasted duck with caviar. That I'd give it 4.5 star. But unfortunately most of other dishes were boring. Not sure if it's because of Chinese New Year they were under staffed today. Everything we wanted had to wait for a long time to place order.

Today I made a reservation for 3 people for 8:30 pm. We arrived a little early around 8:10 pm and were told our table will be ready by 8:30 pm. We were in a hurry so we try to sit in the bar and order food first. However, we were told that if we order at the bar, we need to sit in the bar. Therefore, we waited till 8:45 pm and hurried the host couple times  - and were always told they are setting up the table and it will take couple more minutes. I asked for the manager and was told it will be another 15 mins wait. We finally got seated at 8:56 pm. the waitress brought our drink from the bar to the table and mis-placed 'whose is whose'. Our food coming in the following order - appetizer, Peking duck - appetizer *2 - noodle - warm napkins. And Peking duck meat was cold (the wraps were warm). I am tired of arguing. No one come to fill our water during the meal. The total for 3 of us was over $200 and significantly not meet the expectation of a $$$$ restaurant.

I ordered the fried shrimp dumpling and vegetable dumpling as the appetizer and Claypot chicken with egg fried rice. It was filling, but rice was a little sticky.

1.0,10/2/2016,"FOOD: While I am Chinese and know they are going for more of a fusion style here than authentic Chinese, they were not actually that inventive or exquisite with their fusion dishes. If you're not going to be inventive, the other way to go about serving expensive food is to include delicacies / expensive ingredients. They did not do this either. The duck spring roll was dry and just duck, with not much seasoning - not flavorful. Dim sum had some extra touches but was not at a level to charge $3 / pc (compared to so many amazing places in NYC that charge this per plate). Fried rice and noodle dishes were nice, not stellar. The two plates that did come out delicious were the chilean sea bass and chicken with plum sauce. In summary, for a place that had gotten a Michelin star in the past and to compare with others at their price level, the others definitely merit their higher price tag more. Hakkasan disappointed.SERVICE: Our servers did not seem very experienced. Our waiter was nice but, again, he was not the kind of professional you would expect for this type of place. He was junior, did not speak clearly or loudly enough - we all had to lean in to hear him - and was definitely much more reactive than proactive. It did not make sense why we had to wait so long for each dish and each ask as it was not that busy. More than half of the dining area was empty. My husband ordered a tea during dinner and waited over half an hour. He followed up with the waiter so he could still have it while he's eating his dinner, but the waiter just said that the barista was brewing it instead of following up for us. In the end, we finished our meal and it still did not arrive, so we cancelled it. Even just asking for water came with a 15-min wait each time. The tea was placed in the dessert menu - also not very Chinese at all - and was $12 a person, the cost of a cocktail. They only apologized when the order was canceled. Our waiter was training a new waiter and had this new waiter take our dessert order, but did not explain or stand in plain sight. Instead, he semi-hid and hovered behind one of the columns. Very strange.DECOR: They try very hard. This you can feel clearly, and I normally love all things design and decor, but this place felt cold and fake. They combined Chinese rosewood panels with what looked like laser-cut marble with parallelogram cutouts. This same pattern showed up in a few other places. So yes, they threw together a traditional Chinese wood with luxurious marble and added a modern technique and a modern geometric shape (not a very interesting one), but the effect of it all together just felt random and did not impress.The overall feel of this place screams fake. The people felt pretentious. Please don't go.We won't be going back.",1,1,0,Susan T.,"New York, NY",45,46,4

5.0,10/1/2016,"I'm quite surprised by the relatively low rating that Hakkasan gets. My wife and I came here for a weeknight dinner, and I have to say that I really enjoyed the experience. It may not have the best hospitality in the world, and I have no doubt that purists will be upset about the cuisine in some form or fashion - but everything from a food and drink perspective was excellent. It does have a bit of a lounge feel to it, with lounge seating in the front, low lighting throughout, and music pumping in the background giving it a bit more of a casual feel despite being an upscale restaurant that used to have a Michelin star. Although we showed up at our stated reservation time, we ended up waiting about 15-20 minutes at the bar - not a big deal, but something of an inconvenience, especially on a Tuesday night when the restaurant did not feel all that crowded. That said, it did allow us some time to explore the cocktails (they make excellent ones here). The beer menu very much mirrors what high-end Japanese restaurants offer, with the craft beers coming from the likes of Echigo and Hitachino.As mentioned, the cocktails are excellent, but the food is great as well. To be honest, the dumplings at the start were probably the least memorable part of the evening. Although they were quite good, I've never found fusion dumplings to be so delicious that I want to eat a whole steamer full of them - unlike your standard pan-fried pork and chive dumplings. The skins were also a tad on the thicker side. The Chilean sea bass soup was delicious; I've never had soup made out of fish broth from this fish (despite having eaten the fish many a time), and the flavor is incredibly rich while still being pretty light. For our entrees, we did the black truffle roasted duck, which is every bit as amazing as it sounds...basically a regular Peking duck (which on its own would be fabulous) but generously infused with a dose of black truffle (both in oil and in sliced truffles), really packing in a punch. The smokiness of the duck and the earthy flavor of the truffle complement each other really well, and this may very well be the best duck I've eaten yet. We also went with the roasted silver cod - extremely flaky and juicy, and although the Chinese honey sauce was a bit sweeter than I would have liked, it was still delicious. We finished off the meal with the sago pudding, which was sprinkled with pomegranate seeds, hibiscus, and other fruits. A very pleasing way to finish the meal in an aesthetically tasty way.I probably won't come back here too frequently, as it's a little ways off from where I live and work, and it's not cheap either - but the food quality was excellent, and as one of my few forays into high-end Asian food in the U.S. that isn't expressly dedicated to traditional dishes and methods of cooking, I really enjoyed the meal and would definitely come back for another meal. Even if it is only for snacks and drinks, it's still an experience one should have.",2,0,0,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169

I want to first talk about the service since I think they went above and beyond.  My husband forgot to print out our tickets before the show, so we figured we would just stop at the staples before going to the show to print them. We didn't make note that it closed at 6pm! The hostess told us we could email the manager and she could print them in her office, but the email was not going through and the manager (Tyler) went above and beyond and brought her laptop down for us so we can log in and print out our tickets. We really appreciated it and didn't have to rush and run and find a place to print our tickets and could enjoy our meal. Which was delicious. Food- we had the dim sum for app and ordered two main dishes - stir fry chilean sea bass and a lamb dish plus the fried rice.  everything was DELISH!! Also loved the ambiance it was more ""date night/romantic/hip"" vibe which I liked since it was our anniversary and better than eating at a loud family style italian restaurant before our show. we will def come back here!

4.0,9/3/2016,"Amazing food, friendly, courteous service, and unbelievable atmosphere. It looks and feels like a nightclub or a lounge, and gets pretty loud. Everything about this place is fun and trendy. I got the floating dragon drink, and the other drink in the pictures I posted is sort of like a margarita. Tart and delicious. My drink was good, but the margarita-like drink was super yummy. The food was really good. We got the senpai claypot chicken, Chilean sea bass, vegetable fried rice, stir fried veggies, and dumplings with duck. Everything was great and had so much flavor. I liked the dumplings and chicken the best. There is someone who opens the bathroom door for you which is interesting, and they give you hot towels to wipe your hands at the end of the meal. The restaurant is like a maze; it's easy to get lost if you walk around. Service was quick, and they make sure to note whether you have a show after or not, and bring the food out accordingly. It is a bit expensive, but given the area the restaurant is in, and the hip factor of this place, it's not obnoxiously pricey, for the most part. I would say it is a great place to go when you have something to celebrate, with a date or a group of people. Hakkasan has a really comprehensive cocktail menu, with interesting drinks, and a pretty varied food menu. Most food items are meant for sharing. One of the cocktails is white and served in a tall glass- it looks like a pina colada, and I have no idea what was in it, but it was sweet and sour/tart and I really enjoyed it, and definitely recommend it, as well as this restaurant!",0,0,0,Emily F.,"Washington Heights, Manhattan, NY",0,21,55

3.0,8/3/2016,"Dined at Hakkasan during Restaurant Week and was glad to see signature dishes available on the RW menu. Started off with the Hakka steamed dim sum platter (Har gau, prawn and Chinese chive dumpling, black pepper duck dumpling). Three sauces accompanied them chili in oil (spicy), another red sauce (creamy texture, mild), soy sauce). All 3 pieces, which were creatively prepared were hearty and actually really good. A lot of flavor was packed into each bite. I did use the sauces too which enhanced the taste. For my main I had Spicy prawns with lily bulb and almond. It came atop a yellow curry paste. All entrees are served with the option of steamed jasmine rice or egg fried rice and plain or garlic bok choy. I ordered the egg fried rice and garlic bok choy. The prawns definitely needed rice to enjoy the curry and again it was really good. I had a taste of my friend's Wok-fried lamb tenderloin in chili bean sauce, onions and peppers and it was juicy and tasty. That dish is great on its own if you're a meat eater - don't really need rice if you want to avoid.For dessert I opted for the Caramel cremeux, Earl Grey & chocolate gelato. I didn't like it. The caramel had a strange, herbal taste which for this dessert combination didn't go well. The gelato was average tasting - texture seemed a little too liquid for gelato. Hakkasan is a dimly-lit sexy dining scene that offers Asian fusion dishes that have potential. It's worth a visit and is a nice destination for the area.",0,0,0,Rose I.,"Manhattan, NY",105,441,3759
3.0,8/2/2016,"I'm giving Hakkasan 3 starts, having been there several times, every other time was a five star experience, but tonight was closer to one star.In the past, I've always had a great dining experience; I usually make reservations through American Express Centurion Concierge, and I usually get a free round of drinks ""courtesy of American Express"", the food is excellent, but having been to Hong Kong and Guangzhou, not very authentic.The last time I went I was coming back from a black tie and was wearing a tuxedo, and the hostess even said she loved my wooden bow tie, but this time I went after coming from the Broaday musical, An American in Paris, I was wearing a Ralph Lauren Polo Shirt, a Lacoste sweater, khakis and loafers.I sat down at the bar around 10 and had a Blood and Sand, which was excellent, but when I was ready for my table, I was told that I could not sit in the restaurant because I was not dressed appropriately.I was told that I could order off the full menu at the bar, I sat back down at the bar and recieved a menu from the bartender, but then he disappeared for like 10 minutes. Annoyed, I asked the hostess for the check for my drink, so I could just leave and go somewhere else. She brought me my American Express card and asked me again if I'd like to sit at the bar and order, she said that she would find me a server to serve me at the bar, but I just said I wanted to go.She handed me my check and their business card, and told me to call if I ever wanted to make another reservation.I want to be clear, Hakkasan is a great restaurant, I've enjoyed food and drinks there many times in the past, but my experience tonight was less than stellar--it was by far the most embarrassing experience I've ever had at a restaurant, and while I probably should have been dressed a little better, I really think they should have their bar staffed all the hours that they're open.Additionally, I think that if I come in about an hour before they close, and they're not super busy, they should be able to make sure that I'm properly served when I'm ready to order.",3,0,0,Andrew K.,"Manhattan, NY",219,2,0

4.0,7/4/2016,"Exquisite food with a presentation of pure class.Hakkasan is what you expect from a top of the line Asian restaurant.  A robust menu of select dishes, each designed to be shared, will tantalize your taste buds as excellent service enhances your dining experience.  I sampled a wide selection of dishes, each with their own distinct flavors.The crispy duck salad is a surprisingly refreshing appetizer that combines earthy greens with the natural fattiness of duck.  It's a dish that should feel heavy, but doesn't fill you up and leaves you wanting more.The fried soft shell crab with curry leaf is a flavorful explosion of tender juicy crab with spicy curry.  The texture of fried crab and some sort of shredded veggies gives the dish a satisfying crunch, but the crab to other ingredient ratio is lower than expected, considering the crab should be the signature part of the dish.The salt and pepper squid was the only part of this meal that I'd consider lackluster as most of the squid flavor due to how over fried it was.  The hakka dim sum platter was gone in a flash as the colorful assortment of dumplings were picked clean by my party.  I was only able to taste the duck dim sum, which was squishy and hard to grab with my chopsticks but proved worth the effort as the warm and gooey texture enhanced the smooth and almost creamy duck.  The crab and sweetcorn soup might sound like a bizarre combination, but the sweetness of the corn pairs perfectly with the saltiness of the crab, making the dish a treat for the palate.  I could enjoy this soup at the start or the end of my meal.The spicy prawns were not as hot as I expected, and instead exploded with flavors of chilies and curries.  The prawns themselves were meaty and will require several bites for people with smaller mouths.  The sweat and sour pork tenderloin with pomegranate is the closest dish to something you'd find in a Chinese takeout, yet it's flavors make it a delight to eat as the mix of the sweet and sour sauce combined with the tartness of the pomegranates make for an eye opening experience.The crispy chicken in lemon sauce was good, but it's more texture than anything else, as the flavor of the chicken paled in comparison to the other main courses.  If you are ordering the crispy chicken, I recommend eating it first or else the other dishes' flavors will overpower the chicken.  The seafood fried rice is heavily flavored with curry powder (a popular spice in this establishment), and not lacking in shrimps, scallops, and squid.  Very filling and a great side dish to go with the rest of your meal.For dessert, I sampled the black sesame and chocolate dumplings.  In addition to a fantastic visual presentation, the dumplings pack a wonderful surprise.  Before serving, our waiter pours sweet yuzu tea into the bowl of dumplings.  Once the dumplings have soaked some of the tea's flavors, I popped one into my mouth, tasting the sweetness of the dough, tea, and berries placed on top.  Once I bit down, I felt an intense explosion of rich, warm chocolate rush into my mouth.  The sudden shift in flavors took me aback at first before I became overwhelmed in tasty bliss.Every dish was beautifully presented and our server was of the utmost professionalism.  Next time I feel like truly splurging on a meal, you'll find me at Hakkasan.",0,0,0,Nadav P.,"Towson, MD",114,341,4

The waitress used a very cheesy chain restaurant style greeting and demeanor. This was not suitable for high end dining. This isn't the Olive Garden or even PF Changs. The service was way too noticeable. Every time someone would collect an empty plate or glass they would ask permission to remove it. Professional waitstaff just know to read your body language and take away empty dishes and glasses at precisely the right moment. It's too bad because the Decour atmosphere and food would be immensely improved by professional service. Wine and tea were delivered to the wrong diner by the food runners.

The restaurant was packed by the time our main courses came. Two of the entrees arrived cold and we didn't feel that there was sufficient time to replace them. The shrimp entrée (which was around $30) included only 3 shrimps, which was obviously inadequate for a group of four persons. Our bill (without any beverages) was around $70 per person, which we thought was excessive, considering that the portions were quite modest. On the whole, this place is all ""show"" and not much substance.",0,0,0,Abhi J.,"New York, NY",1,49,22

Please don't combine the two. Cocktails and wine by the glass were also like $17-20 which is just unnecessary. My friends' cocktails were good but not $20 good; my pinot noir was average.I was feeling pretty annoyed at my friend who had picked this place, until I tried the food. The dumplings were creative and delicious. I still have dreams about the lamb tenderloin. It was hands down the best Chinese meal I've ever had.

4.0,4/20/2016,"A step into the mystic blue ambiance engulfing your body and taking your soul into another world. A world of peace and tranquility yet anticipation for something incredible. A world that only exists in Hakkasan -a modern, classy Asian fusion restaurant named in a michelin guide for its delicacy in food, perfection in service, and beauty/elegance in ambiance.Hakkasan is a perfect choice for romantic dates, cozy family dinners, memorable friends outing, and more! Our Uncle D decided to take me and my sister out to an unforgettable and fun-filled night at Hakkasan for Fiona's graduation dinner. It sure left a strong impression and lingering feelings from that night because not only were the servers funny, friendly and attentive, the food and environment were on point.Starting with their besting-selling steamed dim sum platter and fried dim sum was the right way to do it! (Be sure to have a glass of cocktail or wine on hand!) The delicate pieces of colorful and tasty dim sum got our mouth watering, and the flavors were light yet flavorful awakening our palettes! The steamed dim sum was soft and warm throughout the entire piece while the fried one was crunchy on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside creating a distinct texture in every bite. One of the crispy doughs was sweet and fragrant with a hint of savoriness. Sometimes it's easy for the fried dim sum to be rather oily and greasy diminishing your appetite, but it was deep fried in very hot oil until the pieces were only crispy and dry from extra oil.Before we go into our favorite dish, the peking duck, let us mention how carefully designed this place was! We noticed that there was a speaker above almost every table, and each speaker was able to block off and cover up the sound of other tables around you yet allow you to chat happily at your table! Don't be afraid to spill your secrets to your friends or date because chances are that no one else will be able to hear you!As we mentioned, our favorite dish was the Peking Duck! The duck was carefully roasted with precision in which the skin was crispy and the meat was juicy and flavorful. In many occasions, the duck is usually sandwiched in a piece of thick, fluffy pocket bun, but surprisingly, it was paired with a slice of thin, soft mandarin pancakes creating the perfect balance among the ingredients without overshadowing the delicious, succulent piece of duck. This dish was HEAVENLY!The asparagus and udon noodles were well-seasoned, so the tastes were not bit disappointing. However, being Asians, we were able to taste that the dishes were lacking ""wok air,"" so we hypothesized that the dishes were not cooked with a wok. We asked our waiter for confirmation, but to our surprise, they used a wok! What was lacking was the ""fire air."" Without a strong, flaming fire, the dishes lacked certain flavors giving them a one dimensional character.",5,2,4,Fiona L.,"New Brunswick, NJ",422,353,1619
5.0,4/14/2016,"This place is honestly one of the best restaurants I've been too in my life! The hostess had a smile on her face the whole time speaking to me and my girlfriend. She had asked if we were celebrating anything special and I said yes her birthday and then she said Happy Birthday Jayleen with the biggest smile! As we walked to the table she asked more probing questions which was great! i love friendly people. I'm sorry i cant remember her name but she had a blue dress the night of 4/11/16. When seated, we were greeted by Danny our waiter. He was so knowledgeable of the WHOLE menu, extremely friendly and FUNNY!  There was also wine sommelier on site. The food served here is meant to be shared, which is great because I always end up stealing my girlfriend's food anyway! So down to what you guys really want to read about, THE FOOD! The drinks we ordered OUT OF THIS WORLD AMAZING cant remember exactly which but we had 3 different! For food we ordered The Duck Salad which the manager Marvin mixed for us and served it himself what an AWESOME GUY)! Shortly after we finished the salad another waiter came up to our table and saw we really liked the duck salad so he recommended we order The Duck Noodles with XO sauce, which we did because as he was describing it i almost passed out because it sounded so GREAT. Then we ordered the Truffle Duck dish which was recommended by Danny. The duck skin was so crunchy and the meat was so juicy....after we were done devouring our dishes another manager by the name of Tyler came over and wished Jayleen a happy birthday hope we enjoyed our meal, which we absolutely did. Then gave her a Birthday treat and wrote HAPPY BIRTHDAY on it! Our night at Hakkasan could not have been any better. The staff here are truly amazing and genuine people.

2.0,3/9/2016,"Hakkasan gets a big 'ole MEH in my books. Came here with roommates and our dates (6 people total). The experience was nothing like what I was hoping for. Aside from the fact that drinks were slightly overpriced (which is not entirely unexpected given it's an upscale restaurant located in midtown Manhattan), the overall quality of the food drastically under-performed expectations. Before diving into the food issues, couple of items to note which contributed to a negative review: our entire party had to wait at the bar for well over an hour to be seated (despite having a reservation), the table we were seated at was way too large for our group size (was meant to seat 10, not 6) and created slightly awkward conversation situations, and thirdly, the service seemed to be slow and inattentive to our needs.The food was marginally better than the experience - since it was restaurant week we all ordered pre-fixe menu selections. The lotus was my favorite dish and the duck pastrami was not far behind. However, both of our main dishes (lotus and beef) was served only mildly warm, tasted as if they'd been sitting out for quite some time - would prefer my meals to be served hot. The overall atmosphere/ambiance was actually decent and you can obviously see why tourists would be attracted to an establishment such as Hakkasan.

Otherwise I am not a fan of dinning in theater district, I am a restaurant owner. I pay attention to details. You go to an expensive restaurant for the bell & whistles. If you want just good food you go to a joint, 1) It was a very cold day 20 degrees outside. You enter the place through the  big doors door bang on us so loud.2) Long corridor was colder the than outside.3)Coat check girl was wearing ski attire almost because it was so cold. They kind of push you to check the coat in. I couldn't bear the cold. Already I dont have a good feeling.4)3 hostess. ( I am not a fan of hostess. They make getting you a seat like an 8th grade science project). They go put us on a table next to the street I am not kidding it was 40 degrees in there. Everyone around there was wearing their jackets.Other people sitting there  complained about it. I requested to move out of there. That obviously to another 15 minutes ( The science project).5)  Someone gave us the menu  with the black attire thought that was our waiter. Took another 10-12 minutes to figure it out he wasn't.6)Eventually waitress showed up she was nice & knowledgeable. We order drinks. 2 doubles of cognac. $24 each. I dont mind the price. Oh my god! glass looked like they took out of the glass washer with out washing. You can see what I have been going through so far. I really lost it. Finally a manger with a British accent showed up. He was the best thing there. He was really apologetic. Took the drink back & gave us a new one. But. its too late.7) Food was really good.I will name &  recommend few Asian fusion places that never go wrong. 1)Spice Market (jean George)2)Buddakan3)Tao (down town)4Jujube treeAlso if you visit Paris go to Buddha Bar.

Stand out dishes for me were the duck salad, peeking duck, Singapore noodles and if you have room for desert, the fruit plate will blow you away with it's presentation and exotic flavors.Chinatown in Flushing Queens has hands down the best dim sum in the city but when I don't want to go all the way out there it's Hakkasan no question. One other thing that really impressed me was the bar. They have the best mixology program I've ever seen at a restaurant with an exhaustive selection of bespoke spirits, beers and sakes. Their cocktails rival any of the best mixology spots I've been to in the city.

They seated us very close to the kitchen and we didn't care too much for the smell of boiling seafood but they couldn't move us as they were fully booked. For a place that charges as much as Hakkasan I feel they should pay more attention to things like this. We started off drinking the infamous Smoky Negroni, while the process of preparing it was very entertaining,I didn't care much for the drink itself, the aftertaste was too strong for me.

They have the best shrimp dumplings, har gau I think it's called I have ever had. Absolutely delicious. The fried dumplings were also pretty great. We even got a steamed veggie dumpling platter for the table and it was simply out of this world. They gave us this really yummy chili sauce with the dumplings that was the bomb, don't miss it. For main course, we tried the tofu aubergine claypot, the pork tenderloin and chicken claypot everything was delicious.  The egg fried rice is really yummy. For dessert there was tapioca pudding, which I was not a big fan of and chocolate mousse which was again spectacular. They are very good with dietary restrictions and allergies. The service is good.

Hidden behind a dark, low-key door, I walked right past the restaurant, even if I've been living next block to it for over a year.I LOVED the decor. While waiting for my friend, I took advantage of their creative Chinese style cocktails - these don't come by a lot! It was delicately made and super delicious. The bar tender had the best smile and was the most courteous.For starters we had the prince mushroom salad and the steamed dim sum. Neither one of us had tasted a better shrimp dumpling in our life, and we've had a lot of them between the two of us. The prince mushroom was also superb - crispy but juicy at the same time. The second highlight of the meal was the chicken claypot. OMG - I doubt you can make chicken tenderer and juicier than that. The sauce was amaaazing. Asparagus was refreshing and delicious too. Even the fried rice was way above par.The third highlight was the chocolate mousse - the pomegranate tapioca was great too, but the chocolate cake base in the mousse was second only to desserts made by Chika in the east village. I could've died for that mousse haha.Overall, this was the rare (Michelin) experience where there's not one thing you don't like. Especially during restaurant week.

4.0,1/31/2016,"I've been here twice already and as an Asian who grew up on plenty full of Chinese food, never have I ever thought I would pay absurd prices for Chinese food let alone even actually enjoy it. Hakkassan is a true gourmet-fancy-fine dine-chinese food. I totally underestimated Hakkassan. It is an art, from their modern upscale take on Chinese food, to the beautiful desserts, and to their top notch cocktails. The staff has been super professional, all the waitress I've had before has been so knowledgable and informative on the food and accommodating. Restaurant interior is spacious, nice, and trendy.**Hakkassan is undoubtedly delicious that I would've gave it all 5 stars, but the real Asian in me is still kind of finding it a little crazy on the thought of the price.COCKTAILS : I love watching them make the cocktails such as the smokey negroni, and the presentation is too pretty that it makes me not want to drink it!! For all the ladies who loves a fruity cocktail that's not too sweet either, you must get the floating goddess!! All my friends ended up ordering extra rounds on it. And if you're a whiskey lover, I highly recommend the blood&sand; its a tad strong but so perfectly made with a tad lightly smokey taste on some 12yr scotch and little orange zesty infusion tasteTHE FOOD : You are out of your mind if you don't order the Chilean sea bass and the truffle duck from here. The Chilean sea bass is so delicate yet grilled perfectly with a delicious sweet glaze that just over-all melts in your mouth. Truffle duck is boneless and roasted Chinese style... Except the skin is super crispy like never done before at any standard Chinese restaurant. Crispy duck salad is also another top must. Pretty much all other entrees I've had here that was even on the restaurant week menu was superb; spicy prawns, San-Pei chicken clay pot, wok-fry lamb tenderloin(which by the way my group loved this so much because it wasn't a bit gamey and was super tender and flavorful). The only passable dish was the sweet and sour pork which was nothing special. I say if you do plan on taking advantage of trying Hakkassan during RW, do come with a group and still order the truffle duck and Chilean Seabass on to the table... It is not to be missed.DESSERTS : I'm a dessert lover, and not only is their dessert so appealing... But the two times I've been here it has always exceeded my expectation. There's so many macaron shops in NYC now, and Hakkassan should definitely open up their own! The macaron she'll is well formed, soft, flaky but yet still has a chew to it like it should... Not too sweet either! Their carrot cake is nothing like your usual carrot cake that you don't enjoy eating.. Unless you do then this will blow your socks off even more because their carrot cake is DELICIOUS!! I also really enjoyed the chocolate mousse, coconut tapioca pudding, and pomegranate & chocolate bombe.",10,5,7,Monica P.,"Brooklyn, NY",432,222,440
3.0,1/30/2016,"Went here for my boyfriend's birthday. I knew ahead of time that I would be a little late, and called on the day asking that they still sit the party as they would all order without me. When I arrived, the host asked me to wait to be taken to the table. She said another host would return to take me to my group. I waited for 15 mins, watched numerous staff walk to the host, chat, leave, walk into the dining room. I was standing in plain view of her, and yet the lead host just left me there. I was frustrated as I was already late. Eventually I had to call my boyfriend and ask him to come get me, as when I did try to go through, I had problems finding them. Food was good. Service was good, although a little impersonal. The first 15 minutes of my experience, soured the entire experience for me.",0,0,0,Davina D.,"Manhattan, NY",58,24,5

3.0,1/25/2016,"I thought the food overall was good, and price was as I had expected, but there were other factors which sadly let me down and led to the removal of a couple of stars:As mentioned, the food was good. My husband and I ordered the pork ribs and the crispy duck rolls to start. The pork ribs were good and you could get the tea flavor, and they fell apart from the bone - overall, these were a win. The duck rolls were unfortunately not good, the duck itself was dry and just felt a bit bland. The hoi sin sauce was tasty but it's a shame that they were unable to get flavor out of a beautiful meat. For mains, I ordered Spicy Prawns (a signature dish) and my husband ordered the wagyu. We got pok choi to share. The spicy prawns were delicious and I would highly recommend them if dining here, by far my favorite dish - they were fresh and the sauce added perfect spice. The wagyu was disappointing, it didn't look appetizing and, while the flavor was ok, I felt like they ruined a good meat. If wanting wagyu, do not try it here. The pok choi was boring, bland - it felt like it had just been boiled and then dumped on a plate without even straining- not nice. A few other notes, my first wine glass they brought out was filthy, I asked for it to be sent back and they came out with a slightly cleaner one - in a nice establishment I would expect clean glasses.The lamp above our table had dust falling from it - not very nice when you're trying to eat.While the servers were good, there was several times when pouring wine/water that they weren't paying attention and a bit would fall on the table. The server who poured our wine-after he presented the bottle to us, he disappeared for about 5 minutes and then came back with the bottle opened. I like to watch the server opening the bottle so I know a) it's fresh, and b) he didn't cork it. He did return our cork, but this could have been any cork. I'm not sure why they don't open it infront of you, but I didn't like that. Overall I liked the atmosphere, it felt like a great place for big parties to come, but I don't think I'll be returning as a couple again. It's a shame as I live really close and wanted a nice place to come on a weekend, but I've had better experiences elsewhere in NYC.",0,1,0,Nicola B.,"New York, NY",3,21,0

4.0,1/18/2016,"I had a pretty solid meal here with a friend on a semi busy Thursday night. We started off with drinks by the bar, which is long and sleek, with a lot of tables and booths in that room. As soon as my friend joined me, we were seated quickly. Our waitress was very attentive to begin with, but the service  for the rest of the night left more to be desired. As far as the food... The duck spring rolls were perfect to start with. I recommend 2 orders of these if you are greedy like me. I had the corn and crab soup, with was delicious. Corn purée base, with shredded crab throughout. Very delicate, highly recommended as well. The one dish I'll come back to get would be the fried chicken with kumquat sauce. It was flavorful, light, and easy to share. The kumquat was like sweet and sour sauce on citrus steroids. I would put this on any and everything (I mixed some in with my rice). A very bright accompaniment to the chicken. Next in my mouth were the Singapore noodles, which was the only disappointment of the meal. But still only a slight one! Flavors were good, I just expected a bit more umami. Chicken and crispy fish rice was good, but there was a bone in the rice. I guess there could've been worse things, but that's definitely a choking hazard when you're shoveling rice down your throat. To complete our meal, we had the fanciest piece of carrot cake I've ever eaten. But undernearth the frou frou, it was damn good. Everything I had I would recommend. But our waitress had no soul and disappeared on us multiple times. That's just as memorable as the food!",8,3,4,Opal T.,"Atlanta, GA",306,238,475

4.0,1/6/2016,"I knew coming into this place that I was going to drop some cash.  Hanging their hat on a Michelin star, two doormen for a relatively unmarked and unassuming door, and a massive granite lined restaurant.  You can just feel the overhead dollars this restaurant is seeking to cover by their listed price points. Service was on point, and even when it wasn't on perfect it was addressed pretty darn quick.  My water was empty twice, and I caught the waiter motioning for it to be filled within one minute of it being empty.  Our cocktails were constantly checked on. The price here takes a bit to get over, but once you're over that you can thoroughly enjoy almost all of the offerings.  I highly recommend the Grilled Chilean sea bass with Chinese honey.  My wife said it was probably the best fish she has ever eaten.  I saved as much of it for her and did my work on the crispy duck salad, which was equally amazing.  The two dim sum sampler platters were good.  I don't know if they were 2-3 dollars per dumpling good, but good nonetheless.  The only miss of the night was the dessert dumplings I ordered.  The black sesame and chocolate filling was great.  The strange part was the jasmine and yuzu tea that the dumplings were in.  There were too many flavors that didn't meld well.  The yuzu was very citrusy, and the jasmine didn't cut through the acid enough to help carry it through with the chocolate and sesame.  So you had this sharp citrus flavor attacking the sweet and silkiness of the dumpling filling.  I can consider this place a special event, possibly once in a lifetime meal.  Given the mass amount of other establishments in NYC, offering items along the same thread for a quarter of the price, I might opt for them over Hakkasan.",4,0,5,Michael E.,"Raleigh, NC",283,223,28

Everyone loved the food including me and the drinks of course. One thing we all noticed and complained,  a large group of 25 people should have more than one assigned server.  The lady seemed to be waaaay too overwhelmed.  My coworkers went there before the cocktail hour to set up but for some reason, the manager could not grant our request for extra table to set up our gifts.  We have a cocktail hour before the event,  and MY DRINK which was a simple cran and vodka DID NOT arrive til 30 MINS later. I'm not sure if it was me because everyone else was served.  I had to ask the lady 3x and she kept telling me they're still making it.  Then I asked one of the guys and when I got served I actually had 2 almost at the same time.  And guess what,  the drink I ordered from 30 mins ago didn't come until after the guy gave me my first drink.  Unbelievable!!!

5.0,9/30/2015,"I've always had an issue with paying a lot of $$$$$ for Chinese food unless it included abalone or shark fin soup (exotic ingredients).  However, this past weekend, thanks to the generosity of family friends, I've changed my mind.  Hakkasan's food is delicious.  They use and are able to source ingredients that normal people don't have access to.  We're talking about ingredients and spices you can't procure at the farmer's market.  The NY branch is also the only Hakkasan location to garner the coveted 1* Michelin.  That just attests to how delicious the food is.I'll just let the pictures speak for themselves.  Everything was delicious and I devoured it like a champ, this being my 5th meal of the day.   ;o)Definitely try the mocktails, nonalcoholic drinks.  Since I'm not into sickening sweet, I skipped the popular lychee flavor and went with another.This is purely for the delicious food.  Not into the nightclub ambiance.  And the entryway - that long hallway leading to the hostess reminds me of a mausoleum.I love that their take away bags are very nice.  Nice small touches.  Not a brown paper bag, but a black bag that looks very boutiquey.Looking forward to trying the SF branch to see how it compares to the NY one.",0,0,0,Dorothy L.,"San Francisco, CA",65,504,317

The dim sum platter is a great appetizer, and we had the peppered rib-eye and prawns. Additionally, the service is excellent--attentive, but respectful and not too distracting.This place is a little sceney, and it's strange to see retiree tourists in walking gear in the seats next to you.

3.0,8/9/2015,"My husband and I tried Hakkasan in London and loved it and were looking forward to trying it here in New York.  We ended up trying it during restaurant week.  My husband tried the steamed dim sum and I tried the fried dim sum.  They were both really nice and we enjoyed them.   Next was the entrees.  I tried the shrimp and my husband tried the black peppered beef.  We both enjoyed the entrees as well.  The shrimp reminded me a lot like thai massaman curry.  It was really tasty and had a nice  kick to it.  The deserts however were really disappointing.  They were presented beautifully but that's where it ended.  We did not enjoy the apricot bavarois at all. The waitress had to tell us to wait a few minutes because the apricot part may still be frozen...if its not ready, I'm not sure why they served it to us.  I'm not sure if I've ever been told to wait to eat something after its been served.    The chocolate desert with the sorbet was ok, but we didn't feel like it was anything special.  I would have given the restaurant and the food 4 stars had it not been for the service.   We arrived at the restaurant, seated almost immediately and then waited 15 minutes before the waitress showed up with menus.  We then order our drinks and dinner together because we've been waiting awhile and just ready to eat...my husband's wine comes and there is cork in it.  We never send anything back, but this was unacceptable.  My drink, they tell me they have run out of, so I order something else.   Meanwhile, our appetizers come before our drinks even make it.  We are enjoying our appetizers.  We're eating at a leisurely pace but every time a dish is empty, the wait staff swoop in and take it away.  It was distracting.  I'm still eating, my husband had just finished and they took away his plates.  Before I know it, they start setting up for the main course and have brought the food, and I'm still eating, trying to converse with my husband but they were in such a rush, I felt rushed to finish my appetizer.  Where was this service when we were first seated?  Sometimes its nice to have a pause before the main dishes  arrive.  While we're eating, the staff including the waitress are almost always hovering.  The minute a dish looks close to empty, they wanted to take it away.  I appreciate how efficient they were but sometimes we were not finished!  Although the waitress seemed like she was always around, she never asked if we wanted a refill of our drinks until the end of the entree dishes, when we had already finished them partway through our meal.  Next we waited for desert, but we had to flag the waitress down to order coffee.  Sometimes people prefer to have their coffee while having desert...our's almost came 10 minutes after we finished our desert...almost took 15-20 minutes for it to come out after we ordered it.  Overall, we enjoyed the food and would consider going back again, but the service was just not polished for a restaurant of this caliber.",3,1,0,Purvi R.,"New York, NY",0,19,0

3.0,8/5/2015,"The only reason I came here because I had a great experience in Yauatcha in London a month ago. It's own by the some owner, and the waiter in Yauatcha told me that Hakkasan has almost the same menu as Yauatcha! I love Yauatcha because they serve the closest canton food I had outside of Hong Kong, and I had been craving for good Canton food for a long time! So I went to Hakkasan last night with certain expectation on restaurant week. We had steam and fried dum sum platter, chicken Claypot, Stir Fried Rib Eye with merlot sauce and dessert on restaurant week menu. The food was great for restaurant week standard, but I'm not sure if I want to come back for the full price.In addition, we ordered the Jasmine Tea Smoked Pork Ribs which is their signature dish. It was delicious! I would totally come back just for that dish! Aside from that, the manager also served us a complimentary Spicy Lamb Lupin Wrap (it was yummy) because the hostess refused to seat us as she claimed the restaurant was full even though we had a reservation 2 weeks in advance and I found a few empty tables inside. She also made 3 other parties (with reservation) waited!Overall, the food was good, but they need to retrain the hostess!",0,0,0,Be Fontaneous ..,"Manhattan, NY",6,37,204
4.0,8/5/2015,"Delicious food and excellent service! They have a very extensive food and drink menu, in bounded booklets. Each wine has been hand selected to go with the Asian cuisine (according to the waiter). Definitely on the pricey side but we came here for the restaurant week menu and we weren't disappointed! Everything is 'family style' meaning everything is meant to be shared. We went with the steam and fried dim sum samples and each one of the bite size servings was absolutely delicious, making me wish there was more than just one piece of everything. They brought out a chili sauce, a spicy hot pepper sauce, and the classic soy sauce. I skipped the soy sauce but mixing the sweet tangy chili sauce with the hot pepper oil works on just about anything. For the main we went with the beef and per the waiters suggestions, the clay pot chicken. The meats were so tender and easy to chew and they were cut into good bite size portions. The overall portions are a tad tiny for my appetite nonetheless share! But it was all so good! Each person gets a bowl of rice and a bowl of lightly seasoned bok choy. They could have reduce the amount of oil that went in the sauce...let's just say I'll be doing a lot of cardio to burn that fat but I would gladly go back and get myself another serving, it was that good.",3,0,0,Irene H.,"Boston, MA",390,251,286

The pink mojoto was good but with the 20 minute wait for it, it wasn't that good. Service just went down hill from there, we were delivered the wrong people's food twice and they couldn't  remember my boyfriends drink order. Luckily we were compted our drink order by the manager.

4.0,8/3/2015,"Came here for Restaurant Week with my hubby. First impressions were that I loved the dark decor, low lighting and sophisticated atmosphere. It felt very high end. We sat the bar first and had drinks, once we were ready to be seated, it took a while for a server to arrive to show us to our table, after we were told someone was coming to get us. Once we were seated, our server was very nice and was able to make recommendations and answer any questions we had about the menu. As it was a fixed menu, being restaurant week, we ordered one of each of the fried and steam dim sum, one of each of the desserts and for the main meal, my husband ordered the rib eye steak with merlot and I had the braised chicken. We then ordered one egg fried rice and one steamed jasmine rice. I didn't actually end up trying my husbands steamed dim sum, but the fried dim sum was amazing, my favorite being the duck & pumpkin puff! For the main meals, I preferred the stir fry rib-eye steak to my chicken as it was so full of flavor and tasty. The steak just melted in your mouth! I would order it off the main menu for sure ($38). The chicken I had was nice, but not very memorable. The egg fried rice with spring onion was really nice and the garlic bok choi. We didn't think much of the desserts. They were more style over substance. The presentation was good, but they didn't taste amazing. I enjoyed the chocolate and cherry dessert, which I didn't think I would. Neither of us liked the apricot bavarois, but the presentation made it look amazing, we ended up leaving it. Overall the meal was very good. I'm not sure that I would have been satisfied enough to pay full price, but the stand out item was definitely the stir fry steak for flavor.

I know good cuisine and this was just average.Asian food is known for being quite affordable .. but for some reason, this restaurant is getting away with serving rice and meat for 38$. If you crave Asian food, go somewhere else because it's just not worth the money... Nothing reinvented, nothing ""fusion"" about it... been there done that. Nowadays, restaurateurs are really good at fooling people: they make you believe you are eating expensive and well prepared food when all they really do, is invest more in the decor than the actual menu!

Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it is also widely available in the frozen sections in the grocery stores of China. You could also get it yourself for ~$2, boil it, and add some pomegranate seeds on top, and it'd taste almost the same.These 3 stars come from the black truffle roast duck and the service.

Flex your Asian taste buds at Pig n Khao on the LES or hit Pok Pok in Brooklyn. As for the food, omg where do I start?

I'll start with the meal so I can end on a positive note with the drinks. For apps we ordered the fried dim sum, soft shell crab and squid with pepper and salt. They need to incorporate dipping sauces!! Everything is just way too bland and dry without it! We had the duck and the sea bass with a honey sauce for our mains. The sea bass was really good! I always get this when I come here it's always so well cooked and prepared :) the duck wasn't well cooked, not at all just kind of ruined the meat actually but the sauce was tasty. We had it with the egg and onion fried rice. We each had several drinks. I had the basil and strawberry martini, pink mojito, and the bourbon drink with raspberry - oh my favorite one! My girlfriend had the strawberry martini, lychee martini (2) and the gimlet. She wasn't very impressed with the gimlet, it was actually kind of icky but well made. The lychee she loved :) my tip is to go for the drinks and skip the food- we walked out 315 dollars down later, and we're underwhelmed.",2,1,3,Jessica W.,"Hoboken, NJ",1468,418,199

We had the $88 set menu for 4 people and though it was a lot of food we could have ordered a more variety of dishes separately for probably a cheaper price. The salt pepper squid was a mix of REALLY salty or REALLY bland and overly battered / fried. The dim sum platter was prob the only redeeming quality.

5.0,5/7/2015,"Not sure how this place doesn't have 5 stars. Hakkasan has it all: amazing food, ambiance, decor, and that extra pinch of glamour that makes the night. This restaurant is definitely one that likes to boast its exclusivity, bolstered by their semi-hidden entrance, black out windows, and ability to let celebrities somehow escape without ever being seen. There's a security guard out front that let's you in, making the place feel like a night club. The long hallway entrance looks a scene straight out of Tron, with blue lighting and very attractive hosts and hostesses at the end. They offer coat check! Make a reservation in advance. Once inside, you take have a few drinks at the luxurious, trendy, and intimate bar/lounge. I just went straight to the dining area though. The place is all wood, but has a different vibe from Tao--much more intimate and intricate. Most of the waitstaff is not asian, not that it matters, but just interesting to note. I'll start with my only complain, that because this is an Asian restaurant I expected more of an Asian (but more specifically, Japanese) service style. I don't really like when waiters interrupt my meal or conversation to ask me how the food is. Like are you fishing for compliments? But seriously, stop that. Anyways, we ordered the spicy lamp lupin wrap for an appetizer, which I highly recommend. Super sopft and flavorful lamb in a crispy wrap--you will never eat spring rolls ever again! Also came with at least 6 pieces, which is unwarrantedly awesome at an upscale restaurant, so definitely enough to share. Next, my highly anticipated tofu, aubergine and shiitake mushroom claypot in chilli black bean sauce. I an obsessed with traditional cantonese claypot dishes and I am so happy that Hakkasan did it right. Every ingredient was very evenly cooked, not over cooked no matter how long is sat in there, and always steaming hot, which was perfect for the cold day. Then, the highly recommended, black truffle roast duck dish, which is by far my favorite duck dish I've ever tried. Forget Peking Duck (which I'm personally not even that big of a fan of), this dish will blow your mind. I can't even start describing it without drooling so I'm just gonna leave you with that feeling of wanting more--the feeling I had after finish the last bite of this duck. The last three dishes I highly highly recommend, in fact I'd find you in your sleep if you didn't try them. The next, the stir-fry black pepper rib-eye beef with merlot, was good, for sure, but nothing special like the other three. We also had a side of the spring onion and egg fried rice to go with everything, and it was a nice change from plain white rice. The dishes here are all in rather large portions, so it was worth the price, and presentation was beautiful.

Went here with a party of 20 for an office celebration so we had a preset menu since it was a large group.Cocktail hr by the bar: good Beijing duck sliders.  I've been to many Chinese restaurants and this was on par! The servers were making the sliders on the side so everything was fresh.  The cocktails were very good. I loved the Green Destiny and Eden. Next time I'm at Hakkasan, I'm only ordering those.Dinner: we had an amazing server. I didn't quite catch his name, I think it was Melvin or Marvin.  He was very attentive and polite.  One on my coworkers is allergic to seafood so he made sure to tell her the ingredients.Dim sum platter: very pretty presentation.  I loved the chive dumpling and the scallop shumai.Jasmine tea and smoked ribs: ORDER THIS! perfectly seasoned and cooked. The meat was falling off the bones. I ate like half of the dish.Grilled Chilean sea bass with honey: ORDER THIS TOO! I love sea bass, I normally have it steamed in other restaurants.  This perfectly grilled with a slight sweet taste from the honey. I ate half of this dish also  ( the Chinese in me doesn't like to waste food)Mongolian stir fried rib eye, Stir fried seafood: I felt that the other dishes in the main course was a bit too salty.  Other then that they were okay, but I wouldn't order it.Banana pearl pudding dessert: great presentation.  This wasn't sweet.  More of a bland banana taste.  I didn't like the texture because the chiffon cake under the pudding just didn't make sense to me.  The Carmel ice cream on top was good.At the end if the night, as ppl gradually left, everyone migrated to one side of the table.  Since we were having cocktails with dinner, the table was full of glasses.  Our server Melvin/Marvin was so sweet.  He brought us all new glasses of water.  Wanted to make sure we were all hydrated!

Hakkasan does a great job of balancing flavors and textures throughout the meal. For lunch/dinner, I'd recommend the following dishes: Hakka steamed dim sum platter - most high quality dim sum I've ever had  Steamed chicken soup - lacking a bit of substance, but the broth is very soothing Stir-fry Chilean seabass with Sanpie sauce - the fish just melts in your mouth, it's phenomenal Stir-fry sugar pea shoots with crabmeat and dried scallop  While many compare Hakkasan to the likes of Buddakan, Tao, etc., I'd highly recommend Hakkasan over the others.",5,3,3,Ha L.,"Manhattan, NY",572,23,15

3.0,3/18/2015,"Alright I see what the hype is about. The cool clubby ambience, the chic marble and wood interiors, and very sweet staff (minus the coat check girl who dropped things out of my pocket and could not find afterwards and almost forgot to return my shopping bag) was all very enthralling. But after you get past that, the food was just overpriced and extra- UNORDINARY. I'm Chinese and I've had my share of amazing Hakka style food. I could whip up half of the items on the menu blindfolded. The dishes are unimaginative and lack creativeness. That being side, presentation was beautiful and taste was a 6 out of 10.  I would go as far as comparing the quality and taste of the food to P.F Changs. I did really enjoy my lychee cocktail, called Hakka, which was very delicious. The Peking duck is pretty great but for how much it is really worth (duck, pancake, cucumbers, scallion and sauce would cost MAYBE $15?) is now at a steep $88, which is a bit outrageous. Dimsum was fine. It is hard to come by good places that can make a great dumpling skin and they do so very well. Dessert was the only course I found intriguing. We ordered the black sesame and chocolate dumplings. Creativity and presentation gets them a 9 but taste was a 6. It was surely a very exciting and different combination of flavors between the ginger yuzu tea over the chewy chocolate dumpling. But something was missing. I felt like it should've been hotter and/or sweeter. But it was unlike anything I have ever had and that gives them bonus points! I had an experience to say the least but was unmoved by the food.

5.0,3/15/2015,"[Vegetarian]Buddakan doesn't hold a handle to Hakkasan. I realize they are now in several major cities (Las Vegas, Miami, etc), but this location is CLUTCH.My only complaint here is service - they are SLOW, but let's face it: if you are gonna drop mad dough to eat here, may as well stay for a while and enjoy it. We love the ambiance, the dim sum, and the vibe (ambiance x2!). While we only come back to NYC once every year, it was a staple of ours while we lived there and a MUST-visit when we return.Must Order: Vegetable Dim Sum plate (they also let you order a la carte veg ones from the lunch menu if you ask nicely) - this is an absolute MUST and I would not split one plate with more than 2 people unless you want to have massive regret for the entire night and Vegetable Hot and Sour Soup (PHENOMENAL - a must order).To complement the must orders: the basic egg/scallion rice is great and any of their mixed veg entrees are just fine.An average 3.5 is just not right for this place. Have taken many different friends who eat meat here, have only heard equally amazing things. My guess is they take a hit for location and service (understandable)Last time I went with a group of 7, we ended up spending $75 each. Keep in mind we got 7 mixed drinks, a bottle of wine, and plenty of food. When we go as a couple, we typically drop $25-50 each depending on alcohol consumption.

4.0,3/8/2015,"This is a review for Restaurant Week 2015, although Hakkasan includes a lot of its regular menu dishes on its RW menu, which I definitely appreciated. We made a reservation ahead of time for Sunday at 5:30pm but the place is huge and wasn't completely packed while we were there so it's possible a reservation wasn't necessary.First of all, the atmosphere is crazy - they played some sort of electronic house music, but at a low volume, so it kind of felt like a toned down club. There's also a complimentary coat check, and the service in general was very good and attentive.For the first course, everyone got the Steamed Dim Sum Platter. The flavor combinations were unconventional and more intricate than regular dim sum, but it was otherwise very similar to what you'd expect from dim sum. For the main course, I got the Sanpei Chicken Claypot. There was plenty of tender chicken and it tasted wonderful in combination with the Egg Fried Rice and Garlic Bok Choy that it came with, which were both cooked perfectly. I also tried a piece of my friend's Stir-Fry Black Pepper Rib-Eye Beef with Merlot and it was just as tender, although it looked like her portion was smaller relative to ours. For dessert I got the Dark Chocolate Marquise with a scoop of jasmine ice cream and blood orange flavor. The richness of the chocolate was offset by the ice cream and blood orange, which worked very well together. Definitely one of the better RW desserts I've had. 4 stars - food was great, but I wouldn't have paid the regular menu price for it.",0,0,0,Susan W.,"New York, NY",8,15,61
4.0,3/8/2015,"Background: Came here on a Sunday at 530pm with a few friends for yet another restaurant week dinner. Can't stop won't stop.Food: Appetizer - Steamed dim sum platter. Good but nothing super special. I liked the one with prawns. One piece had corn, which wasn't bad but seemed a bit odd in a dim sum dumpling. Entree: Sanpei chicken clay pot. This dish was tasty, but didn't seem all that superior to other Thai/Japanese chicken dishes I've had elsewhere. Dessert - Dark chocolate marquise. Yum. What's a marquise? Heck if I know. It was a dark, rich, decadent dessert, just the way chocolate should be.Atmosphere: Cool. For starters I had trouble finding the place, which was a bit annoying - there's a small, easy-to-miss sign on the brick wall outside that says Hakkasan (just follow the building numbers) and a bouncer. And then inside there was light club music playing - is this a club or restaurant? Also each table has it's own small ceiling lamp hanging down, making the general area dark yet you're able to see your food which is nice.Service: Pretty good. I changed my mind about 5 minutes after ordering (yes I'm the worst) and asked our waiter to switch my entree - it was no problem, and my dish came out with my friends' plates fairly quickly. Bonus points for that.Overall: As with many of my past restaurant week experiences, I thought this place was good and served better-than-average food, but I'm glad I tried the prix fixe and don't feel the need to go back.",0,0,0,Emilia R.,"Manhattan, NY",50,31,15

There's a doorman, and coat check. Most, if not all of the waiters and servers look like models (if that matters). Our server was okay. I kind of felt like he was put off that we ordered from the Restaurant week menu. The food:I ordered the Hakka fried dim sum platter. The prawn dumpling was crusted with toasted sesame seeds, and filled with... Idk. Both were okay, and a tad bit salty for my liking.Main: Spicy prawn with lily bulb and almonds. This dish was good, but not excellent. It, too, was a bit heavy on the salt. The curry sauce it was cooked in was delicious, but, I feel like it is something I can make at home. If you have an aversion to spicy foods you should stay away from this dish.I loved the garlic bok Choy. I could have had that along with rice and would have been satisfied.I can't remember the first drink I had, but, I didn't like it. It had Rosemary, champagne and idk. $15 for a small beverage. My second drink was an Echigo Stout which was perfect. Dessert... I believe was a dark chocolate mousse and lavender ice cream.

It's not quite French, but certainly of the continent.Double doors opened by the doormen as you walk in, a long silvered hallway that captures the depth of the space. A quick check-in of the coat and to the back where the staffers point us to our party, in a roped-off section of the bar filled with glass cases of aged liqueurs and trinkets.Overall a very modern place, but they didn't cram or hurry us, and the food came out in waves - a chef right there to carve the five or six Peking ducks for the group, standing tables and sitting along the edges. Bar doesn't have your normal mix of drinks, instead aiming for that next step up - though the beer list had the class ""Tsingtao"" and a few better beers from Japan.Passed appetizers - Peking Duck, of course, was very good. The dumplings over a crab soup was a tasty palate cleanser, and the prawn meatballs with some spicy pepper on top was a hit with the group. Other appetizers missed our table, but the more exciting drink was a smoky concoction that had an orange slice on top - the smoke curled around the large glass and it was quite interesting to watch. Didn't get to try one (was driving), but otherwise interesting.Dessert - meh, flavored macaroons, I would've thought they would have cooked up something more appropriate, ah well.

3.0,2/7/2015,"I've been to Hakkasan in three different cities (SF, LA and NY) and have come to expect some consistent things: gorgeous decor, gorgeous diners and gorgeous dishes. The prices are not so gorgeous if you're pinching pennies, but the type of people who come here aren't really the penny-pinching type. ;)There are some subtle differences. I felt the SF location had a more business-y clientele. The LA spot (my favorite) feels like a scene from a P. Diddy video. And the NY location, which I've visited twice with out-of-town friends, has a pleasant mixture of both. The service has always been friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere provides chic trendiness with a side of romance to suit all your aspirations for the night.Highly recommended: The namesake cocktail and the Kalamansi Ganache dessert. The savory dishes are all decent, but the portions are noticeably small for the prices and everything always feels a tad greasy to me. If you must go savory, stick to the pork dishes (what the Chinese do best) and skip the seafood.Surprised this place has a Michelin star. They award them to chains?

5.0,2/1/2015,"Glitzy Chinese food does not get any better than this. I wanted to take off a star because it is so darn expensive. But you are paying for killer ambiance and a Michelin star.We came on New Year's Day. The decor is really beautiful, modern and retro. The service is superb and the food is well done. Authentic yet creative cantonese food. We ordered soup, dumplings as appetizers. We had a beef and a chicken dish (with orange?), both were excellent and made me wish my stomach was a size bigger. I tried a alcohol free specialty cocktail (which is really a smoothie) and it was very tasty. The only thing I didn't dig was the desert. I can tell they are fancy but it just really wasn't my thing.

OUTSTANDING atmosphere + Great People + Great food = Awesome night.This place is great for groups as they serve their food in large portions for everyone to share. Maybe a pro or con depending on the person but def. a pro for me. Drinks are great and if you want to ditch the food the bar is perfect. Food is Good to Great but it is a upscale chinese resturant with little to none 'Fusion' which is RARE and i love that. Won't compare to chinatown, because this place delievers atmosphere and exprience in BULK like NO OTHER. PICTURE THIS ENDINGAt the end picture you and your best friends stuffed JUST RIGHT w/ a 'Tincy Wincy' liquor inside you all making everyone/everything a little bit funnier. You pay the bill and you walk off the into this narrow hall which make you feel like you are exiting a nightclub. You stop at the restrooms of course which are beautiful from floor up. Its dim but lit up in red by the lights. you all finish walking down the hall and just when you are about to exit and feel like all the fun is done the doorman opens up the door and BOOM!. you step out LITERALLY one block off of Times Square; in the middle of the city that never sleeps you feel like the fun will NEVER end! :) Enjoy Everyone Missing one star because i feel food could have been better although it was definetly beyond decent. like i said , dont want to compare to china town but the food in a few CT spots can compete w the food here but thats about it. if you gave a 2 or 3 because of food you have to remember the location, the atmosphere, the decor and the service which were ALL standouts.",1,0,0,Marcus A.,"Manhattan, NY",124,9,0

5.0,1/13/2015,"Let me start by saying that my husband and I have been to Hakkasan London, Hanway Place, the Miami location, the Las Vegas location and a few others that will just make it sound like a bit of bragging. New York was not my favorite when it first opened, between the service and the management, it really wasn't what I thought was the best representation of the brand. So, my husband and I did not go for a long time. One day on a whim we decided to go have dumplings, and let me say I was blown away. First there is Ami, she is the manager and she rocks on levels. When we sat down she came over introduced herself and just chatted us up about or experiences at other Hakkasans as well as other restaurants that are on the same level. Ami is from the Miami location and if you have ever been to that location you fall in love, and I get it because she is the someway. Ok, now the food; I love love love the dumplings, there is not one on the menu that isn't just yummy, the duck salad if you like duck is just amazing and I never get tired of it. I really enjoy the portions of the egg fried rice (enough for 2 maybe even 3), the wine list is divided by palate not region, which is very interesting to read through, and then there is the lovely see bass that I could eat seriously everyday. My favorite table is by the kitchen, not sure why, it just is. On my most resent visit to Hakkasan, Ami took us to see the kitchen (I want one in my home), and it is a well oiled machine. Let me just say this, the food at Hakkasan NYC is cooked by people who know this cooking and food, with out sounding simple, it is authentic Asian fare.

The owner of the restaurant must have spent fortune on interior fittings! It's chic, modern and comfortable. Services are good. The guy served us gave us good suggestion on the portion and choices. But I compare a one Micheline started Chinese restaurant to other Italian or French restaurants for the same amount of money I spend - I prefer Italian or French. The duck is great. Stir fried veges and braised prawn are ok... Some Restaurants in China town serve similar quality of food but a lot cheaper. So we pay for the interior fittings....

5.0,1/5/2015,"Hakkasan is a really nice place.  It's a great atmosphere.  This is the kind of place that you need to be ready to spend a little money, remembering that what you are paying for is not just a drink or a meal.  You can go to a bar and a diner and pay much less if that is what you want.  Here, and in other places like this, you are paying for the atmosphere and the experience, to which Hakkasan delivers in bulk.While I waited for my friends to arrive, I sat at the bar which was a great experience to start off with.  The bar staff was very professional and well dressed.  My drink was served in a nice glass with one of those large ice balls.  Nicely done.  After my friends arrived one of the drinks was served with hickory smoke.  Pretty cool.  The food we had was very good and very well presented.  I can't recall the actual items but dumplings, and other sharable items started off the meal.  Even the fruit platter we had for desert was uniquely presented.Nice job Hakkasan.  I will be back for sure.",1,2,0,Stephen B.,"New York, NY",46,282,45
4.0,1/3/2015,"Summary:  1 Star Michelin Chinese Restaurant trendy chain that is great for business or for upscale in that area.  Less fusion, more Chinese than Buddakan and Tao. Great Decor and food that even Asian people approve of.About the ratings: The 2's and 3s for this place tend not to consider food quality vs. Chinatown or a desire to only rate the food vs. incorporate the decor and service. This would be like comparing Uncle Gussy's Food Truck to Mylos.  You just don't do that. I give both very high Yelp ratings for different reasons.  Also, there are so few nice specifically Chinese, not fusion (Buddakon and Tao), restaurant in the city, but this is the only one where you could take high end clients. For someone who has spent time in China and HK, THANK YOU for finally showing the NYC and the world something other than Chinatown.  I am thrilled that Hakkasan exists to show that you don't have to give up quality or be required to fuse with something else to be high end and Chinese.  Crazy to me that it took so long given Hk in the 80s  and 90's and Beijing and Shanghai in the early 2000's were entirely able to create quiet high end atmospheres of this sort with delicious food.Atmosphere:  The decor is Eye Candy and if it was in Chelsea, this location would be impossible to get a reservation for. Instead, it's in the theater district/midtown and - while it's constantly booked out for business dinners or events - it's generally not impossible to get a table at with friends.  I get inspired by the environment every time.The Food:  Delicious and consistent... that's why you have a star!  I'm a tough critique on high end Chinese.  All I can say is that Hakkasan has a Michelin star and I concur.  It's going to be more expensive than Chinatown, but it should be because the ingredients, the service, and the atmosphere are all better.  Also it's family style, so depends on the clients. Most will really like it.For dinner, Steamed dim sum platter -  really well executed and tells me I ought to try this place for proper dim sum to avoid the crowds and get more high end.  4.5 Stars.Soups - all are great (hot and sour, crabmeat).  The steamed Chicken with ginseng is the most authentic and one that is rare to find anymore. It use to be that many of the Chinese restaurants would provide it as a Lai-tang (a soup that comes with primarily given only to Chinese people who knew to ask for it). That has all stopped - or at a minimum - rarely comes with ginseng.  5 stars.Salt & Pepper Squid - usually this is a dinner dish for Chinese people, but here, it's an appetizer size more in line with the way Western Culture thinks of fried calamari. I would say this is very Chinese Style with minor adjustments which is a thumbs up.  But it's not fusion.  4.5 stars.Soft shell crab - Ok. This is good, but really more fusion than Chinese like the other dishes. 4.5 stars.Stir-Fry Black Pepper Rib-eye - This is a better version of what is commonly called HK steak.  5 stars.Spicy Prawns - Sauce was perfectly executed. 5 stars.Wok Fried lamb tenderloin - Not gamey at all.  I personally love chili bean sauce.  5 stars.Peking Duck with caviar - Honestly, I don't notice the caviar so much, but it's great.  Try it on a splurge. Alternatively, you can get the Crispy duck rolls which gives you some essence of Peking duck.  Try it if you love Peking Duck or if you don't mind the splurge.Jasmine Tea smoked Chicken - quite delicious.  Great if you wanted a chicken dish. 4.5 starsChicken in black bean sauce - simple and well executed 5 starsAll the veggies including the seasonal are 4+ stars.",6,1,0,May L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",617,466,229

This is not one.  This is a chain with over priced food.  I will say the service was good and the ambiance is nice.  Not worth 39$ for a few pieces of beef in in a rice noodle basket.",0,1,0,Patricia R.,"Scottsville, VA",28,6,0

5.0,12/16/2014,"Love this place. Every time I come here for lunch or dinner, I feel great. Finally a place with elegant preparations of dim sum, entree, drinks and dessert. Anyone giving them a rating less than what they deserve probably doesn't know what high quality and 5 star service is. Even the bathroom is beautiful and clean with great toiletries.I've tried all sorts of drinks there, enjoyed as many different kinds of dim sum as possible and stuffed myself on their entrees/desserts such as peking duck, noodles, rice, soft shell crab, tea smoked dishes, cakes and more. They will even prepare a to-go package.The very first time I went there was a hot evening when they just opened. It was very late, close to 11pm and I wanted to take a look. The bouncer and hostesses were super kind to me and let me explore. The maitre d' even asked if I wanted to sample a macaron for free--any flavor I wanted. He even complimented my outfit. To this day, their macaron set is one of my very favorites in town along with Laduree and the LES' Bisous Ciao. Macarons.After that great first impression, my friends and I have been regular customers. I know my Chinese food and I can say this is definitely one of my favorites. Food is fresh, served quickly and for its quality and quantity, I honestly think the price point is worth it. It's not cheaply priced, but I can definitely go along with the prices. I would however skip the lobster broth. Love the hot pepper condiments at every table. Well made. Crepes that come with the peking duck are unique, fresh, and has an irresistible light touch of sweetness: just a subtle touch. It melts in my mouth. Peking duck skin is crispy and the meat is perfectly cooked. Best to go when the head chef is actually there and not training staff at another Hakkasan. Keep the man here.The dessert is divine and the drink ingredients/combinations are so beautifully crafted. Staff is always kind and accommodating and their uniforms seem to be specially designed for the restaurant.

4.0,12/10/2014,"You might ask me : Is this an authentic Chinese restaurant ? I will say: European execution with Chinese passion. In the hakkasan's menu you can find the Chinese dishes that you familiar with has creative inspiration from European  cuisines. It's originally from London, England. Created by Hong Kong British immigrants and sold to Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan during 2008 financial crisis. Now an Abu Dhabi-based investment company that owns the Hakkasan brand, with seven locations around the world.Decor:4.2/5You are paying average $3 per dumpling, $3.5 extra for a bowl of rice to dine in this  fantastic restaurant with spectular interior design. Walking in a wall of white marble reception hallway,11,000 sq dinning area has been diced into banquettes by beautiful window lattices. Colorful recessed lightings creat clubs atmospher. Waiting lounge with extensive liquor collections. Service: 4.2/5What worries me the most in food is MSG. After letting the waiter knows about my MSG intorance, the restaurant manager showed up to double confirmed that there is no MSG in any of hakkasan's dishes. Compared to the waiter in cafe China, the same one starred Michelin establishment in mahattan, were stared at me with his poker-face. This reinforcement from hakkasan manager means tons to me. Food:3.8/5Lunch-Restaurant weeks deal is a steal. Three course lunch for $25. I had dim sum sampler as appetizer, black pepper beef and stir-fry as entree and macarons for dessert. Dim sum sampler came with a dedicate Chinese chive shumai dotted with a goji berry, har gau and scollpe shumai with small fish roes. The portion is my only complain. Every bite was tender and nuanced. Black pepper beef would be considered as more fusion than original cuisine. And the macaron will be the wow factor of the whole meal. A good kind of wow, like -WOW! How come macarons show up in a Chinese restaurant ? And WOW! I don't mind because they are delicious. Dinner -My favorite dish is shanghai dumpings with garilic dipping sauce. Perfectly chrispy skin, dumpings stuffed with juicy meats that made me finish all of them swiftly. Again, I wish the portion is not so small. Friend and I also ordered soft-shell crab. It disappointed me because it's too greasy and salty. The highlight of the dinner was the dessert!! A crystal clear cup topped by a thin layer of crepe. An aroma greeted me while I was smashing it with my spoon. Dig into the cup there were pearls alike tapiocas soaking in white coconut juice.

5.0,11/25/2014,"I've been to Hakkasan a number of times, both for brunch as well as dinner. I have never had anything besides absolutely stellar cuisine and service. The ambience when you first walk in is luxurious yet relaxed. An incredibly kind gentleman always opens the door for you and there is the lingering scent of some pleasant incense that wafts down the beautiful, white marble hallway to the hostess desk where you are greeted by a gaggle of smiling beauties in black dresses. When asked whether you prefer to start with a drink first or be shown directly to your table, go for the drink! The lounge/bar is one of the most beautiful in New York, with an incredibly diverse array of fine spirits and wine and an especially creative cocktail list. My personal favorites include The Golden Emperor, The Pink Mojito, The Hakka (their signature) as well as The Smokey Negroni if I'm in the mood for something with a bit of a kick to it. The bar tenders are are all sociable, knowledgeable and accommodating.Of course, the real star of the show is the cuisine. Once seated in the romantically lit labyrinth-like dining room, your server will politely make some recommendations and they are yet to steer me wrong. I always have to indulge with the the steamed dim sum to start; and I adore the duck salad which is mixed with an even distribution of pomelo pulp and pine nuts. As far as entrees go, the fish dishes are phenomenal. The Chilean Sea bass with Chinese Honey is fairly light in flavor and just a tad bit sweet. One of their signature dishes- The Champagne Silver Cod- is also delicious. It's slightly sweet and buttery. In general, I'm not a huge fan of red meat, but even The Black Pepper Ribeye with Merlot was out of this world. It was rich and savory and paired very nicely with the egg fried rice. And then there's the dessert! Whoever they have working back there is an absolute culinary genius! I can never get enough of the stuff! The dessert menu is constantly changing and there is always a new variation of treats available, including the macaron flavors. My personal favorite flavors from the past include yuzu, cassis, chai, raspberry vanilla and champagne. The coconut pudding is also out of this world! On a few occasions a manager was  also kind enough to stop by- not for any particular reason other than to make sure my friends and I were having a nice time. I recall a handsomely dressed Asian gentleman as well as a beautiful woman with a lovely smile and long black hair. They both gave us their business cards and wished us a most lovely rest of the evening. Upon leaving, the hostesses bid you adieu with a warm smile.

Main Course: *Wok-fried Wagyu beef tenderloin with spicy peanut sauce (5*)- The flavor balance between the spicy and the peanut sauce accompanied the beef tenderloin harmoniously.Dessert: 'Kir Royale' (5*)- The dessert was excellent in flavor and was a surprising reincarnation of the Classical Kir Royal Drink in dessert form.

The ginger seafood was OK but it was no better than Uncle Chen's at the local wok in my neighborhood. The mango pudding was delicious and so were the hakkas. Service was good with over dressed waiters asking you if you were enjoying your experience every 10 minutes. The ambience is hypnotic and fit the heavy price that you'll have to pay for the experience. Talking of pricing, make sure you take note of everything you've ordered. Rice isn't free side dish here.

2.0,10/5/2014,"The first sign that should tell you to run is the area it's in--Times Square, known for mediocre, half-assed, tossed up food and tourist traps. You can say that this is an upscale version of all those put together....Okay, I guess ""tossed-up"" doesn't seem to apply since they do put together a dish nicely. From it's swanky decor, to its over-the-top service, Hakkasan certainly aims to please their clientele with their attractive, yet pretentious presentations.Maybe I have been spoiled by authentic Chinese food my whole life, but the food here is nowhere on par with the kind I can get in Chinatown - - hell, I think I like Hing Won's (48th & 6th) westernized Chinese food much better. You're mostly just paying for the decor, service, location, and nothing more with the ridiculous prices. A friend had a voucher with a pretty hefty value here and it wasn't even enough to cover 3 small plates. It felt like every dish was loaded with grams of salt--especially the Fried Soft Shell Crab. And don't even get me started with the portions because they were nowhere near large enough to get your money's worth. If you really think they serve the ""best Chinese food in the city,"" you obviously have not eaten much Chinese out in the city--sans takeout. The food is ridiculously expensive, and Hakkasan, as a established chain, is overrated. Do not take your family here, and certainly not your clients--there is a range of better food down the block in Hell's Kitchen. There is so much sizing up to each other in the dining room, it is uncomfortable and nowhere near elegant and/or classy. 2 stars for the good service, though.",10,8,3,Sharon T.,"Queens, NY",856,1061,1832

1.0,9/17/2014,"Where to begin VERY DISSAPOINTED. We made reservations 2 weeks in advance for a party of 8. We were told by our phone rep alright ""GREAT"" we will see you then. Afterwards several other phone calls were made asking for birthday accomodations for a birthday dinwah. Even then ALL PHONE reps said ""alright see you then"". Arriving at the restaurant we sat at the bar and ordered a bottle of wine. Bartender seemed busy with a party of 2 quite odd since our party sat in the middle and was trying to get his attention for a bottle of wine and more. Moving on, hostess sat us nicely. Loved the ""semi private dining experience"". Ambiance and decor was very impressive. Waiter came and greeted us gave us some choices. Now the fun part upon placing our order we were told ""Restaurant week only serves a party of 6"". We kind of looked confused as we did make reservations AHEAD for restaurant week, made several calls yet no one told us this ""corporate policy"" thats stated NOWHERE. Waiter was nice enough to get our manager LUIS OR LOUIS. As he arrived those mere 2 mins was honestly the worst experience of our party. Not only was he completely unaccomodating but given Hakkasan is such a prestigious well known restaurant we were astonished at his responses. We were told the policy again along with there's nothing we can do. We explained we made this reservation strictly wanting to try restaurant week (as we haven't before), there were SEVERAL well known restaurants we chose yours. My party is not one to make a fuss esp given its a birthday gathering we shut up and just ordered from the regular menu. The issue was not that he did not honor the menu for only 2 other people. My issue was that as a manager I dont feel LUIS OR LOUIS lived upto offering our group as customers any satisfaction. Instead he told us there's one girl who works upstairs and she might have not told you guys, I'll go speak to her. We were once again just in awe why a manager of such a well known honored restaurant we chose out of several ones is blaming some poor employee when we don't even know if she was the phone rep making the reservation. He did not offer us any kind of customer resolution. There was no ""I'm sorry here's a drink for the birthday girl"" or ""excuse our employees mistake let us give you a complimentary dessert enjoy your night"" NOTHING. It was you can go or stay upto you attitude. Now to the food, the employees was so good and helpful it made the manager seem mediocre. Random bus boys cleaned served with a smile even brought me a warm towel because I had dropped something on my pants. It honestly made my night better their service was amazing. The food was so bland I could not believe it since the reviews were decent. Food was LITERALLY chinese food the lamb beef chicken all chinese flavors chinese. The manager was trying some rather odd ways of trying to make up for his poor service by serving us our meal, which was brought to us 2 at a time, we waited 20 mins for 2 other meals by that time the corner rice which was suppose to be ours was cold. We then waited longer for the last meal where no one knew how to locate, it was depressing. Even after the cake was served there was no checkups on our experience. It was quite interesting. My party will not be returning, we are used to trying various restaurants and usually have a good time.

You can even see inside the kitchen which I liked because theres so much action going on in there. We had lettuce wraps for appys which were my fave and in my opinion better than the snow crab which was deep fried and really heavy. I had chicken for dinner which looked small but was reallllly really filling. My friend had the veggie dish with the mushrooms which she wasnt a fan of.

3.0,9/8/2014,"This review is long overdue. My friends and I tried Hakkasan out during Restaurant Week. We had walked past the place couple of months ago and had been intrigued by the blue windows that you can barely see in through from the outside. This Asian-fusion restaurant close to the middle of what I like to call ""tourist-hell"" by Times Square is surprisingly expensive, but restaurant week let us try parts of the menu to a very decent price (3 courses for $38, which would only be one dish on a normal night). Either way, the ambience is pretty nice, exclusive yet casual at the same time with medium he noise level. At least at 10pm on a Thursday night. Being a big fan of Asian inspired food I was very pleased with all our dishes. My friends and I ordered different dishes so we could try of each other, we tried one beef dish, one chicken dish and one pork dish (sorry that I cannot be more specific), and it was all AMAZING. The dumplings we had were also very tasty, and so was desert as well.The only disappointing thing was that our reservation was at 9pm, and we were not seated until 9:45pm. And after a long day at work, when you expect to be seated at 9pm, you might understand our frustration over having to stand in the bar for 45 minutes, ESPECIALLY with a reservation. It is because of high prices, and a long wait in the bar Hakkasan only receive a 3 star by me.

Thankfully, restaurant week gives us the chance to try out these amazing restaurants that normally would have been out of our price range. We went to Hakkasan during the summer restaurant week for lunch and were thoroughly impressed. A meal for two was only a little over $50. The Dim Sum is the best I have had in New York. I got the fried combo while she got the boiled combo. I'd definitely recommend coming here with another person so that you get the chance to try both. My Thai chicken dish was great but could have used a little more spice in my opinion.

3.0,9/7/2014,"Hakkasan is a relatively prestigious name when it comes to progressive Americanized East Asian foods. I'm not too sure how they've gained their prestige but I'm guessing it has something to do with their nightclub in Vegas. My wife and I were about thirty minutes late for our dinner reservation so they had to give away our table. :(. No worries though because they told us to hang out in the bar area till another table clears up. Let me go ahead and say that they have one of the most amazing bar setups that I've ever seen! Their cocktail list is uber creative and the mixologists really knew what they're doing. The blood and sand drink was by far the best whiskey beat cocktail that I've ever had. They mixed up the ingredients and then attached a smoke machine to the glass and covered it with a slice of orange to keep the smoke from escaping. The Hakka was a sweet drink but will catch up to you really fast if you don't pay attention! As per the yelp reviews, we went with the duck egg rolls(crispy, well cooked, good dipping sauce), spicy seafood fried rice(ehhh, not bad), tea infused ribs(had higher expectations for them... They were ok) and the honey glazed Chilean sea bass(good but nothing to rave about). All said and done we had a great dining experience and we probably spent about 300 bucks here on dinner and drinks(we had a lot of them and they're between 15-17 each).  I would never recommend this place for dinner but I would come back here time and time again for their drinks!!

1.0,9/6/2014,"Pretentious and unfriendly staff, overpriced menu, inattentive service, mediocre fake Chinese food -- absolutely to avoid.    When made a reservation online on OpenTable, nowhere it says it is ""business casual"", even in the confirmation.  I went with my spouse for the birthday celebration, a scary-looking bouncer at the door refused to let us in.  Fine, we live nearby, and asked to push back our reservation a bit so we could go home and change.  The bouncer escorted us in, the hostess coldly changed our reservation, and we were escorted back out promptly.  Really?  Did we commit a crime that deserved public shaming?!  Had it not been my spouse's birthday celebration, we would have walked out at that moment and never come back.Half hour later, we came back, finally got seated.  Waiter was nowhere to be found.  No menu, no water, no services whatsoever until we could flag someone down.   We ordered one appetizer, three entrees, one noodle, and one dessert.  The only dish that was decent was the roasted silver cod.  Others were greasy, overcooked dishes overpowered by spices.  The Jasmine Tea Smoked Chicken had little taste other than the skin (well, the meat actually tasted like dry cloth)--a dish supposedly modeled after Soy Sauce Chicken which is known for its tenderness and flavor in its meat.  The Hakka Noodle with Mushrooms and Chinese Chive was the worst--supposedly Hakkasan's signature dish?!  It is possibly worse than Panda Express quality--so gross that we didn't even want to finish it.All in all, an extremely unpleasant dining experience.  With many other ""fusion"" options in New York with better services and better food, please look the other way.Oh, by the way, ""business casual""?  We saw people wearing t-shirts, torn jeans, and loose-shorts look like a skirt.  Apparently, Hakkasan is not THAT selective after all, just pretentious.",3,0,0,Kai L.,"New York, NY",1,156,16

3.0,8/23/2014,"So, hakkasan is a very pricey chinese for many but i can say that they do not feel chinese at all. The place mostly looks like a lounge that has been influenced from the ever-growing so-called `american new` style a wee to much and they have made a very nice bar out of it. The menu offers a very nice example of dim sum though and their beef and chicken dishes are very good to continue. I did not enjoy the shrimp that much though, could have been way better. The desert, yes, the macaroons are lovely. Especially the presentation of each dish excels the former one and the macaroons are served over chocolate pieces in these nice containers that they also the dim sum in. Wine. The wine menu is not probably the richest in town but i had malbec which was very nice. Though i think there are other hakkasan s in the world, probably in dubai. The location put aside, it is VERY touristy, Would i beware? Not exactly. Because although i like chinese, there are many few venues in this great new york that are - well it is better said - sanitary and attractive, unlike those `genuine` chinese places that you can find near Canal St. So, along with Buddhakan, hakkasan makes the cut and has a place in my list.",0,0,0,Jacqueline H.,"New York, NY",1054,98,0

We tried the jasmine tea smoked pork ribs, mongolian beef and the hakka spicy seafood rice.  The ribs were delish - super tender, the meat jus falls off. The beef tasted like Chinese take out and the fried crisp the beef sat on was soooo stale. I like the spicy kick in the rice and it was good but it felt like if u add hot pepper to any fried rice it would taste jus about that.  The highlight of the meal was by far the peach tart!

Our waiter was very knowleadgeable about all the items on the menu, as well as their lengthy wine list. I orderred their signature drink the hakka, and was warned that it was very sweet, so I was excited(major sweet tooth over here) But I wasn't thrilled, I did not like the way the lychee flavors owerpowered the entire drink I sampled the dim sum platter which included scallop shumai, har gau, prawn and Chinese chive dumpling.  The prawn was my favorite, but the Chinese chive was my least favorite as I did not like the combination of flavors with the texture of the dumpling. Oh I need to say, the filling fell out of my dumpling for the chive. My friend ordered the Stir-fry mushroom lettuce wrap with pistachio and pine nut and this was a nice tasteful blend of flavors, a bit spicy but tolerable. This must be an amazing mix when paired with the right wine.For the main course we ordered the spicy prawn and the asparagus and lotus as a side. Both were delicious, the prawns were cooked perfectly and the sauce was a delicious blend reminiscent of carribean curry. The aparagus was the perfect crunchy side to the texture of the soft prawns.  It was  A NICE mix.For dessert we ordered the macarroons, they were ok, I am used to Dominique Ansels macaroons (omg omg omg Dominique) After we finished dining, the waiter bought hot towels over for our hands, and we were sent of with a nice pricy bill.

I think you come more for the ambiance, not the food. Because if you want delicious ""authentic"" Chinese food, you go to Chinatown or your local dim sum joint. They put an upscale, sophisticated spin on Chinese food but smaller portions and visual delivery.The Restaurant week dinner menu was good with the fried/steamed dim sum platter, the beef praised in merlot was much better than the curry shrimp, and the bay leaf sorbet was ok if you're into sour, and the strawberry was sorbet was also just ok.The highlight was the service.

3.0,7/29/2014,"Hmm is the trendy atmosphere worth the steep prices?As with all fancy Chinese food, you could definitely get something just as, if not more, delicious in a more casual setting, but you're clearly at a place like Hakkasan for the sophisticated ambiance.That being said, their Restaurant Week Menu is a pretty good deal - sampler of a few items on their menu for a pretty reasonable price ($38 for 3 courses). Everything I ordered - steamed dim sum platter (shumai, har gau, and duck dumpling), the stir-fried beef tenderloin, and seasonal sorbet dessert - was definitely delicious, but not really filling enough. Overall, I would probably not come here regularly if it weren't for the special deal, because there's plenty of amazing Chinese food elsewhere (larger portions, cheaper prices), and I'd only justify paying for ambiance if it were truly spectacular.",1,1,0,Kristina W.,"San Francisco, CA",206,111,166

5.0,7/8/2014,"This is about the 6th time I came to this restaurant. I enjoyed the atmosphere and modern design the second you stepped into the place. It's hard to tell what's inside from the outside as it has a unique high class design, more secret and more mysterious. I had lots of experiences in trying different kinds of food, and the best was always what could preserve the original tastes of the ingredients, instead of covering it. As one of the Michelin one star restaurants, this serves you the wonderful combination of joy and nutrition.  I usually don't write reviews, but this one I highly recommend. The decoration is very modern, yet classic. With dragons and phoenix graphics on the leather chairs. The lights are dim but just perfect for any settings, family, friends or couples for a date night. I love the sparkling water they served, even at extra costs (which you can get in Whole Foods), but the right cold temperature makes the water even sweeter. The portions of the each dish is not too big and not too small. Two people, we usually order the dim sum appetizer (8 pieces, four kinds of buns), two entries, one poultry and one meat, then balancing with vegetables. Then, you will be full. If you eat a little bit more, try the fried rice. I noticed the menu will change depending on the season, and in summer I cannot find duck with mango appetizer which might only be served during fall season. I start to like the idea of changing menu, just like the other chain（Seasons 52). The background music always sounds exciting, and did not change much.  A good cocktail would be the cherry saki, which might be available only during the cherry blossom season. I remembered there should be another Hakkasan in Vegas in MGM, and many more across the world. Hope the tastes will be the same authentic, as always.",0,0,0,Amanda L.,"Bellevue, WA",7,67,64

There is music playing at a low murmur, so you can still flirt on your date or entertain clients.What I ate...At the bar- much attention is paid to each cocktail. I ordered a manhattan and it came complete with a spherical ice ball, branded with the Hakkasan logo right before my eyes.The dim sum was delicious. Perfectly crafted little pods of goodness they were. Try the fried and steamed variety. Both have their unique merits.I ordered the lamb dish along with fried rice. It was very tender and juicy.

Drinks are priced at $17 - $15 for the yummy ones and so we usually just stay for one drink to chit chat over. My favorite so far is the Golden Emperor--sweet and cinnamon-y. The smoke-infused drinks are certainly the draw, though. They know their drinks and many of the drinks have a pretty flower. The bar is hard to hang out with friends, however, because there's not a lot of room to move around to hang out with people so its not a place to go and have 6 friends drinking expecting to all chat together.

That's how I would describe Hakkasan.We came here for my wife's birthday, and both really enjoyed our dining experience here. Yes, it's very expensive, but it was totally worth it.We had the Stir-fry Mushroom Lettuce Wrap and the Pan-seared Shanghai Dumplings for appetizers. The lettuce wrap was excellent and I was a little mad that I had to split it with my wife. I'm not a big fan of dumplings, but the ones here were very tasty, and I had a lot more than I thought I would.For entrée I had the Spicy Prawn. Man, it was delicious! The curry was made with some amazing spice. Whatever the opposite of bland is, that's what this dish was. My wife had the Sanpei Chicken Claypot, and I thought it was pretty good too. For dessert, we had the Kalamansi Chocolate Ganache. I'm not kidding when I say that it was to die for. It was amazing. Combined with the eucalyptus sorbet it probably was one of my favorite desserts ever!Lastly, I want to say that the service was superb. We had a ton of questions for our waiter, and he patiently answered all of them. He knew the menu (and what the disher were made of) inside and out.I really liked Hakkasan, and can't wait to go back.

I know that a table of 6 people is a fairly large table for NYC, but it is not out of the realm of possibility. We were sat at our table on time, and were immediately greeted by our waiter, Fabiany. He told us about the menu and then gave us some time to look at the menu/order.  It all started going downhill from there. When he returned, we ordered our drinks, appetizers and entrees all at once. The appetizers came out (both dim sum platters and soft shell crab), we ate them, they took the plates away, STILL NO DRINKS! At this point, I was starting to get a bit pissy, so I asked multiple people (3 to be exact) where our bar drinks were. I got mostly eye rolling, and ""i'll get your server"" comments. Well, 56 minutes later, our first round of drinks finally arrived! Yes, I looked at my watch and took note. It was ridiculous. Needless to say, I was fuming at this point.  The only redeeming qualities of the night were the duck and sweet and sour pork. We ordered a bunch of things, but these were by far the best. The only reason this place is getting 2 starts. (BTW, our first round of drinks came on the same tray as our entrees, thanks Fabiany!) I woke up today still mad about how condescending and rude our waiter was. AND I had to give him a 20% tip since we had a party of 6 people, so it was automatically added. Fabiany was, by far, the very worst waiter I have ever had in any restaurant in NYC. I will never return to this place.

5.0,5/23/2014,"When a guest says ""This place is one to remember"", you know you've got a winner. And this guest was no pushover either. I have been Hakkasan twice now, the first for Restaurant Week. I decently enjoyed the prix fixe menu, and probably would have rated the place a 4 out of 5. But after tonight, I was floored. The dim sum platter we remembered to be quite good, and we were not disappointed when our four bamboo steamers came out. Our other appetizer was the smoked pork ribs, and they were simply delicious. Better than even Southern style BBQ ribs I have held elsewhere, and though small they all packed a tangy, meaty punch.For our main courses, they consisted of Peking duck, black pepper rib-eye beef , silver cod, and the spicy prawn. Oh the prawns. Each prawn was cooked perfectly and was even better with the curry sauce and vegetables. I would have been a happy camper simply dining on those prawns for the entire meal. I only wish there was more of that sauce to go with my rice. And the Peking duck was delightful. Not only did it taste authentic, but the skin slid right off the meat and was just the right amount of crisp. We couldn't have finished the dish any quicker. The cod and beef were quite good in their own right as well, but the duck and prawns shined the brightest.As if that wasn't enough, there was the dessert. Now I remembered the macarons being damn good last time, so we got one order for the table. This time around, the tastes were, shall we say, interesting. There were some bold choices in the fillings, such as sour cherry and lime, which kept us guessing but was a bit of fun. I tried someone else's chocolate ganache, which was very dark and simply didn't do it for me, but I'm not a huge chocolate guy anyways. But the mango pudding, oh man - it was to die for. Strike what I said earlier about the prawns, I could live a week just eating the prawns and this pudding. Oh and the pork ribs too.Anytime you get compliments about the place you've chosen for dinner, you know you're at least a 4 and pushing towards a 5. I should also mention the gorgeous decor of the place, there is no question the owners are going for a modern East meets West look, the bar being the greatest example.

2.0,5/13/2014,"Came here on a Friday and made a last minute 730 pm reservation for 6 the day of after failing to secure one at Tao and Buddahkan. I had always assumed this place to be a Japanese restaurant but walking in to the pumping club music it had a really nice interior and one of the cleanest Chinese restaurant kitchens I've even seen. It had a trendy, clubby, tastefully expensive vibe that screams $$$$. Overall impression is that service here was attentive, friendly but the it can be a little disjointed between the bar and the dining room. Hakkasan targets a very specific audience and tries to show case a combination of southern Chinese dishes with a more western/fusion twist to it. If you consider yourself a diner that focuses on food, there are many other 4 star options in the city you can try at this price point. If you're a diner that likes the decor, the club music and the service i.e. Tao/ buddakhan I would check this place out. Ordered the following: - Four-style vegetable stir-fry in sweet Szechuan sauce- Hakka steamed dim sum platter- Grilled Chilean sea bass with Chinese honey- Hakka noodle with mushrooms and Chinese chive- Crispy duck salad - Jasmine Rice- Stir-fry mushroom lettuce wrap- Desserts - Black sesame and chocolate dumplings, Kalamansi chocolate ganache- Drinks - Kuroshio Smash, Lychee Martini etc.  Overall entrees that was good was the sea bass, it was smoked and had a nice honey glaze over it. Sea bass being a fatty fish it was pretty good and did not dry. The dim sum platter at 3 dollars a piece was good, but not 3 dollar a piece blow my socks off good. They're pretty traditional dim sum that you can get in Chinatown, it was freshly steamed and was well made. The crispy duck salad was good, the duck could have been crispier, but it was a well made salad with pomegranates and micro greens. All the other entree dishes were okay, it was quite heavy with the corn starch sauces and I needed to have some rice to cut through the sauce and saltiness. The overall dinner highlights was the drinks which were well made and the desserts. The Gauche was very good, creamy and sweet. The Black sesame and chocolate dumplings were my favorite, a traditional dessert with black sesame and nutella, but what was great was the ginger/yuzu tea. The tea was very refreshing and I was surprised by the little flavor balls of lemon yuzu in the tea. In closing, I recognize that this restaurant targets a very specific audience and I respect its business model, but at this $$$$ price point I would expect food a little more innovative and discerning. You see glimpses of that but that was overshadowed by the pounding of my heart when dinner ended, I didn't know if it was from the music, the check balance or the MSG.",2,1,1,James C.,"Manhattan, NY",196,210,177

You walk past the very lavish looking bar and seated at your table. Very beautiful restaurant but that's where the fun ends. That itself deserves 2 stars.You can order the dim sum platter that comes with only a few pieces of dim sum for a very hefty price tag.

I won't even go through the list of things we ordered since everyone here seems to have rated it already with accuracy. Dim sum, rib eye, udon noodles with duck, they stuck out for this restaurant but not in life in general. I'm surprised Hakkasan is even Michelin star rated.

We started with the vegetarian dim sum platter. it was amazing and came quickly! i particularly enjoyed the bamboo and mushroom dumplings. they were my favorite on the platter!For drinks- i got the virgin hakka and kwoolon cooler- loved the virgin hakka. the kwoolon was a little weird with too many berries to get a distinct flavor for me.For main course- we got the four stir fry vegetables with sweet schzewan sauce and hakka noodles. they were both delicious!For dessert we tried the ganache and mango pudding. they were not traditional desserts. mango pudding was a little tangy as well but they were good. not mindblowing in my opinion but great nonetheless!,0,0,0,Jen P.,"Irvine, CA",5,76,3

4.0,3/9/2014,"Pleasantly surprised. A group of us came here for Restaurant Week, and we were expecting a crazy bar scene with so-so food. Well, we stood corrected. The food was delicious, and actually a great deal with the Restaurant Week menu. The staff were very kind and attentive, and the atmosphere was really cool. Definitely could be crazy bar scene, but we had our reservation really early. I orderd a Kowloon Cooler, and it was so good. It was tart, slightly sweet, and very refreshing. For my appetizer, I ordered the Steamed Dim Sum Platter. The dumplings were a diverse array of little bites. One had shrimp, one had scallop, one had crab(?). Either way they were all delicious morsels. For my second course I got the Pineapple Shrimp, the shrimp were perfectly cooked, though a bit under-seasoned. They were a bit spicy, but definitely not my favorite dish of the night. One friend ordered off the Regular menu, and got this really tasty mixed seafood dish and a stir fried veggie dish, Snow Peas with Wood Ear Mushrooms. All the seafood was perfectly cooked, with an amazing sauce. The vegetables were so sweet and crisp. I also got to try another friend's Claypot chicken dish. The chicken was tender, juicy, and flavorful. Our main courses, since we ordered off the Restaurant Week menu, included either egg fried rice or jasmine rice. The fried rice was a really nice foil to all the dishes we got. Then for dessert, I got the Chef's Selection Macarons, and my friend got the Chocolate Hazelnut Dumplings. The macarons were good, one was Mandarin Orange and something (can't remember), and the other I think was some kind of tea. The server explained them to us, but I promptly forgot after she told us. The dumplings were like the black sesame or peanut tang yuan, except filled with chocolate and hazelnut. They were delicious and a fun twist on a traditional Chinese dessert.

When entering the restaurant you walk through this long dimly lit hallway but at the other end are a few people happy to greet and accommodate you. My parents showed up first and were waiting at the bar, the waitress took their drinks and brought it to the table for them and moved their bar tab to their table tab. My dad had some whiskey (there were about 40 different choices), his gf had a strawberry basil margarita which was delicious, so I ventured out and tried their lychee margarita. It was a perfect balance of sweet with a little bitterness at the end. I was very happy with my drink (which I'm usually pretty picky about). We ordered off the restaurant week menu and had one of each appetizer, the duck roll, dim sum sampler and asparagus salad. The duck roll was delicious and came with a yummy plum dipping sauce. My dad loved the dim sum but I found them to be a little cold for serving. Salad was a salad :)I got a chicken in clay pot entree which was good but nothing spectacular. My dad got Mongolian beef and loved it  his gf got chilean sea bass and said it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. My sister got prawns with pineapple which was well flavored but too spicy for her. Dessert was definitely amazing. Macaroons we're fresh and flavorful. Panna cotta was well textured and the chocolate hazelnut dumplings were savory and delicious.

3.0,2/23/2014,"My girls and I had dinner and drinks on a Saturday at 7pm.  The restaurant is a tad difficult to locate from a dimly lighted sidewalk on 43rd street.  Look for a deep blue, extremely heavy-looking door.  Luckily, a doorman was kind enough to open both sets of doors for me.  Once inside, you walk down a long marble corridor toward two hostesses who greet you warmly.  Along the way, you can coat-check your belongings.AMBIANCE: I was the first in my party to arrive, so I sat at the bar and scoped out the scene.  The bar is lit by florescent blue lights, giving off an upscale, Vegas vibe.  The bar area is a nice place to grab a quick drinks/dinner with friends.  Just remember to dress accordingly!  The restaurant itself is huge, and dining sections are sectioned off by Chinese panels.  The panels are a nice touch because they divide the room yet the open panels still allow you to peer across into the next set of tables. The dining areas can seat both large parties and 1-on-1 dinner dates.FOOD: We ordered the following:1) Hakka steamed dim sum platter (scallop shumai, har gau, prawn and Chinese chive dumpling, black pepper duck dumpling)2) Steamed red snapper with chilli sauce3) Traditional braised lamb shank4) Spicy Fried RiceDRINKS:1) Shiso Gimlet (Nolet's gin, Pierre Ferrand dry curaçao, yuzu marmalade, lime, shiso leaves and lychee juice) ... I had 4 glasses of this ... so good!2)  Pink Mojito (Cabeza tequila, mint, lime, and cranberry juice)3) Bodhi Blossom (Brooklyn gin, raspberries, ginger, rosemary, lemon juice, and Champagne)4) Strawberry and Basil Martini (Spring 44 vodka, strawberries, white balsamic vinegar, and Thai basil leaves)The bill came out to about $400 (do take into account that we ordered several rounds of cocktails.)  In conclusion, it's a nice restaurant if you want to get prettied up with your girls, or if you want a nice dinner date.  But it's not one of those restaurants that you could afford to become a ""regular"" and dine here every other night.",6,2,2,Teresa L.,"New York, NY",253,403,259

This isn't Chinatown chinese so don't expect that down home cooking with questionable cleanilness. This place is clean...squeaky and huge like a Las Vegas establishment..We had an assortment of things. First of all vegetarian hot and sour soup is actually good. I couldn't tell the difference. The heat actually got to my palate which was unexpected. The vegetarian dim sum was fresh and just the right amount of steam. We followed this with Pipa duck (signature dish apparently) and stir fried mushrooms. The duck was crispy on the outside and flavorful on the inside, however the plum sauce was a bit too much for me. And I have a sweet tooth.  The stir fried mushrooms were clean with the macadamia nuts offered a sweet contrast to the dish's earthiness.  A well balanced dish.  The Hakka noodles are just ok but need a little less grease and a little more flavor. The spring onion and egg fried rice is DAMN good. For someone who doesn't like rice at all, especially fried, I really enjoyed it. There was just the right amount of flavor and not too much oil. I have since found a simple chicken fried rice that trumps this place and is humble unlike hakkasan. But then no one who wants something humble and simple should come here it's not that kind of joint... The black sesame cremeux would have been better without yuzu sherbet.

It was what a normal restaurant would call an appetizer and did not come with rice, and was almost forty dollars.

5.0,12/22/2013,"I ate here for a work dinner a couple months ago.  It's a really nice upscale restaurant with a good sized bar/lounge area that is nicely separated from the main dining area.  The drinks here are fantastic.  I had a gimlet with Tanqueray 10 gin, which was very well made.  For dinner, we shared a bunch of plates, most of which I don't know the names of since I didn't do the ordering.  All were delicious.  One of them came with a side of what looked like a chili-like paste, which was a favorite of the table.  One stand out:  the Pecking Duck.  I normally do not like duck, but this was unbelievably delicious with a nice, crispy skin.  The service for our party was also very good.  One of the staff saw I had my work bag on the floor and brought over a nice chair for all the ladies to rest their bags on.  These chairs were very comfortable to sit on...probably some of the most comfortable I've experienced in a restaurant setting.Overall, this is a great place.  I probably wouldn't come here often on my own because it is quite pricey.  But if you're looking to splurge for some high quality food and great drinks, or looking to have a work-related dinner here, it's worth a try!",0,0,0,Melissa M.,"Fairfield, CT",41,166,23

3.0,12/14/2013,"Perhaps Hakkasan in London has earned its Michelin star, but the New York iteration certainly would not.For the extremely pretty penny you pay, you can do far better in New York City.The decor is definitely hit or miss. It's a very modern location infused with the flavors of Asian styling. The interior is surprisingly spacious, though a bit maze-like at times, and as awkward as mentioning them may be, the bathrooms here are immaculate and possibly the most beautiful restrooms I have ever seen. I'm personally a fan, but the club-like vibe it may be a turn-off to some.The wait staff are on-point. They are attentive and professional, and know exactly when to disappear and reappear. It's a fine art, that, and I was nothing but impressed by my waiter's service. As a dim sum service though, ordering from a menu feels odd; there's something about ordering from dim sum carts that makes it an experience, and that is unfortunately missed at Hakkasan.It's likewise a pity that the food just doesn't hold up its end of the bargain. At the prices listed, you'd really expect more. I can absolutely understand the difficulty of making Chinese dim sum cooking look like high-end dining, but at least flavor-wise, you've gotta be able to beat out your average Chinatown dim sum restaurant. Hakkasan was frequently lacking. Flavors are too bland or too strong, or just generally unbalanced. Some hits: the king crab noodle roll and the absolutely delicious macarons.

5.0,10/17/2013,"Our waiter described Hakkasan as ""modern Chinese"" and this is exactly what Hakkasan is. I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for innovative Asian, but if perfect execution with an updated take on Chinese classics is what you're looking for, this is your place.  Hakkasan doesn't really succumb to the hyper-regional trend, but instead includes a large menu influenced by a combination of authentic and Chinese American cuisine.We ordered the Hakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter, Hakka Fried Dim Sum Platter, Peking Duck, Sanpei Chicken Claypot, and Seafood Fried Rice.  I seriously can't complain about any of these dishes... they were all really well prepared.My family frequently eats Dim Sum and we've been to many places in the city: Pacificana, Nom Wah Tea Parlor, Golden Unicorn, Dim Sum Go Go, etc... What always bothers me at these places is the lack of subtlety and poise. Though overall the food at these joints is good, sometimes a dish comes out too cold, sometimes under-steamed, sometimes too oily, sometimes over-seasoned and sometimes it just tastes old. I always get the feeling that the food is put together in a rush with little attention to details. On the contrary, the dim sum platters at Hakkasan were just perfect - perfectly steamed, perfectly cooked, perfectly put together.... nothing extraordinary, just spot on execution. I especially liked the Prawn and Chive Dumplings (part of the Steamed platter).  I could taste the individual flavors of the ingredients in each dish, which were all fresh and flavorful.The chicken was good, but frankly I barely remember it because I was too focused on the excellent Peking Duck.  Up to this point, the best Peking Duck I've had in NYC was at the Peking Duck House in Chinatown. The problem there was that some pieces of duck tasted significantly better than others and the Hoisin sauce tasted just a bit too sweet.  These are common problems I've encountered with Peking Duck. At Hakkasan instead of giving you the whole duck, they give you only the best pieces, each cut to include both meat and skin.  The Hoisin sauce is just sweet enough without being cloyingly sweet.  The cucumbers and scallions tasted fresh. Finally, instead of the typical pancake, Hakassan's pancakes are the size of soft taco shells. This is actually a great size since you can better control your portions. As far as the seafood fried rice, it had this unami flavor, that just made it feel good.  I felt satisfied after every bite.Hakkasan is not just about the food though, the whole experience is very well constructed. What I disliked about Tao and especially Buddakan (which as ""asian fusion"" restaurants are quite different from Hakkasan in terms of menu) was that you're forced to walk through (and often wait in) this noisy bar area.  Perhaps this is to tempt you into buying drinks, but it kind of annoys me when I just want to have a relaxing meal.  When you enter Hakkasan, you walk through a narrow quiet hall to the reception desk where friendly staff lead you into the dimly lit dining area.  There is a bar that you walk through before arriving at your table, but the music here is not loud, and the crowd is far more subdued than at Buddakan.  Our waiter too was professional and informative.  He gave us good suggestions and plainly explained the dishes and restaurant concept.Hakkasan is a great place to bring a date... in fact the whole big, but not loud, richly decorated atmosphere is a perfect pre-party venue... the calm before the storm. It's also perfect for a relaxing night out. The execution of food, decor, and service are all spot on, leaving almost nothing more to be desired.  I would certainly come back and would feel comfortable bringing some of my more picky friends here.",8,0,0,Victor C.,"New York, NY",250,12,1

The decor is decent, but not impressive. The entire space is on one level, so it's difficult for it to feel like anything other than one large space, no matter the room dividers. The music being piped in is Hed Kandi circa 1999. Makes one feel like they are at a gay circuit party or in a changing room at Zara. The only part that really annoyed me was the script that the waitstaff was on: My waiter reminded us that everything comes out family style (read: we suggest ordering 3 entrees because only one at a time may come out), but then had the audacity to say, ""Now, these entrees are all proteins, so we ask that you go to the back page and order rice and noodles from there."" Thanks Chief, I've lived in NYC for 10 years -- I think I know to order rice at an upscale Asian restaurant. The restaurant is clearly being run by classless people who know exactly how to draw in that demographic.

And then there was a tall dark door and I entered it. There was a long marbled corridor and I walked on it for a while. Dude, it was a long corridor. A beautiful lady greeted me and I was taken to the beautiful lounge with soft music where they made pretty drinks.I have tried several drinks on the menu and they tend to be pretty well balanced. Let me be clear, this is no Milk & Honey. They have plenty of vodka drinks and a few are too sweet and I'd always choose Macao Trading Company over Hakkasan for Asian fusion cocktails, but listen: for the most part these are solid cocktails. The Rum Daisy, the plum sour and bird's eye margarita are a few that come to mind.Their bar snacks as well as dining offerings are quite tasty - personally the mushroom lettuce wrap with pistachios and peanuts despite its saltiness is one of the yummiest appetizers I have eaten in recent memory. While the dumplings don't quite match up, they'll do nicely until the dinner menu becomes available at the bar.The dinner menu has enough vegetarian options and the veggie ""chicken"" dish is really flavourful. Their desserts all sound super interesting but I've only tried two so far. The sesame chocolate cremeux is this really quite intense dessert that takes over your tastebuds, while the pistachio 'parfait' is a tongue-in-cheek take on a parfait and what it would have been if someone real clever had created it.Hakkasan is the opposite of everything that port authority stands for - it's luxurious and expensive and stylish.

There was just something off in the service, the waiters did not look happy, they looked like they were under a lot of pressure from the management. So I will not blame the host and the waiters on their attitude - it surely looked like behavior was influenced by an exogenous factor. Once seated by a rather rude host, the waiter asked the guy filling our water glasses to not fill them till the top as she wanted us to order drinks. But during the entire meal she came to fill our glasses several times. We were told that food will come out as per when the chef makes it (appetizers and soups might not all come out together etc.) but then she asked us if we wanted our soups first and then the appetizers etc. She asked me if it was OK that my cocktail will be served in a martini glass, but the cocktail then came out in a high ball glass. Another waiter came quiet forcefully to ask us if we were done eating. I really don't know what to make of this but the management needs to do a better job training and keeping their people happy. Having said all this food was great. I will return when I am ready to tolerate their attitude.",0,0,0,Eva S.,"New York, NY",15,23,13
5.0,8/4/2013,"My first experience at Hakkasan was at their original location in London - and it is one that I will NEVER forget!  The  incredible food, fantastic cocktails, stimulating ambiance and most of all, the 200 euro check at the end of the night that I shared with a coworker.  Dinner for 2 cost pretty penny and so I knew when locations starting popping up in the US (Miami, San Fran and NYC) that I would need to try it again stateside and that Restaurant Week would be the perfect opportunity!So I recently dined here with my parents, pre-theater for lunch during NYC restaurant week.  You can see from the 5 stars above that it was every-bit as incredible as my previous experience in London.  Even at lunch.  Even at a discount.  Even with a limited menu.We started with the dim-sum:  both the fried and the steamed were unique and delicious combos that I would never have thought of so I recommend getting at least one of each.For our entrees, we decided to share them family style just as we did for the starters since we ARE family after-all!  We  shared the Steamed Red Snapper with Chili Sauce, the Braised Tiger Prawn Claypot and the Stir Fried Beef Tenderloin.  All were equally delicious, but the snapper was probably the smallest serving/least filling if you were to order this on your own.  Very tasty though - that's one thing that is guaranteed from here is that the amazing flavors with stimulate you as much as the gorgeous decor.  OOh - and while we are talking ""flavor"" - I had the best cocktail ever in life while here for lunch:  try THE HAKKA!  Intense, delicious flavors of Passion Fruit, Coconut and Lychee Juices that perfect disguise the fact that there is Sake and Belvedere Vodka mixed inside, too. This drink was like ""vacation""We all ended with the Peach Tart which was beautiful and yummy, but nothing like what we expected from the simple name of it.  Best Upscale Chinese Restaurant in NYC!",2,0,1,Niki C.,"South Orange, NJ",464,253,447
2.0,7/30/2013,"Overall, the food at Hakkasan didn't live up to its elegant presentation.  I came to Hakkasan to try their restaurant week lunch menu, which was a good way to sample various dishes without breaking the bank ($25 for 3 courses).  The virgin Hakka, a mix of lychee, coconut, and passion fruit, is a refreshing, fizzy and fruity beverage.  Of the steamed and fried dim sum appetizers, the standout was a pumpkin-shaped, fried ball filled with duck; salty, sticky, and sweet with a kick of green onion, this was a unique take on dim sum.  The remaining pieces were pretty good, particularly the shrimp in the steamed dim sum selection, but were not particularly memorable-the duck roll was especially forgettable.  Next came the braised tiger prawn claypot with asparagus, taro, and spicy bean sauce and the steamed red snapper with chili sauce.  I found the red snapper to be slightly overcooked and the flavor quite one-note.  The tiger prawn was ok but again, not distinctive; the taro was reminiscent of soggy french fries.  The chai and pistachio macarons had a predominant chocolate flavor from their filling.  The peach cake was nicely presented and had a flavorful champagne gelee, but I found the dessert overall to be too sweet.  Overall, the food at Hakkasan was not creative enough to be truly distinctive, yet not tasty or authentic enough to warrant another trip.",2,0,1,T T.,"Cambridge, MA",0,297,327
4.0,7/28/2013,"I love Hakkasan! It is a great elegant and upscale Asian fusion restaurant (mostly Chinese). I have been here twice for Restaurant Week and I was happy both times. I really like their dim sum steamer and the Fried ones. The dim sum is not your regular dim sum dumplings. Instead, it has high end ingredients and taste fresh and delicious. The fried dim sum are great too although the spring roll is nothing special. For entree, I tried the duck and it is great! Their stirfry chicken in clay pot is also amazing! You have to get your entree with the egg fried rice. It goes perfectly together. For dessert, I had the chocolate cake and it is just right since the entree is not too heavy. The macarons are also great. Great place to be on a date!",3,0,1,Athena C.,"San Francisco, CA",1008,1619,761

I'm a huge dim sum fan and these were true to their cheaper, on-a-cart counterparts. I think the shrimp and scallop shu mai was my favorite. The duck spring roll was also very tasty and well seasoned.We ordered Sanpei chicken claypot and Wok-fry duck breast with tangerine peel as our entrees. They were both incredibly delicious. The chicken was so super tender and soft, but had a nice flavor. The duck breast wasn't as tender, but had a dark, citrus flavor that I really enjoyed.For dessert, they had a cherry chocolate something and a peach something - I can't remember what it was called, but they were both light and tasty.They actually have a great vegetarian selection, so I'll definitely be back here with my boyfriend for a special occasion.",0,0,0,Thao L.,"Manhattan, NY",30,174,1
5.0,7/23/2013,"I was debating between 4 and 5 stars, but had to go with 5, based solely on the highest quality Chinese food I've had in NYC, even though the prices are also among the highest I've seen in New York.  Although the decor is very trendy and there is little hint that this would be a Chinese restaurant when you first enter, the dishes are quite authentic and very well prepared.The duck definitely shines here - a $88 Peking duck, carved back in the kitchen but with amazingly crispy skin and carved so that the skin and the meat are wonderfully balanced -- perfect for wrapping in the steamed flour skins with hoisin sauce, scallions, and cucumbers.  I enjoyed all of the other dishes I've ordered here, including the fried rice, string beans with pork, scallops, beef, etc -- everything is high quality.  Average entree is about $30 though, which means it is about 2x as expensive as your typical Chinese restaurant.  However, I firmly believe the quality is what you pay for here.  P.S.  Food here is about 100x better than Mr. Chows.",1,0,0,Winston G.,"Chicago, IL",458,809,23

The outstanding ones for me are the Morel Mushroom dumplings, King Crab dimsum, and the duck and truffle buns (an alternate to the Char Siu Bao) were beyond excellent. The lows were the lotus leaf wrapped sticky rice - very average bordering bland. The juicy buns (Xiao Lung Bao) should be served with proper chinese soup spoons to catch all the soup.

4.0,7/9/2013,"New York is not known for its Chinese food--compared to our counterparts on the West Coast, we are sadly lacking in non-grease-laden joints (not to disparage them!). Besides the antiquated Shun Lee or the unsuccessful Shang, there aren't really many upscale places either. For years, I've heard people complain about the lack of a exquisitely done, high-end Chinese restaurant in the city.Enter Hakkasan. Originally opened in the West End in London, the brainchild of superstar Alan Yau (Wagamama, Yauatcha), Hakkasan has become phenomenally successful and thus transplanted itself to other locations across the globe. Part lounge, part restaurant, and assuredly sexy in all efforts, this is a place that epitomizes a certain kind of sleekness and trendiness. When I first came here for dinner one night, I was a little skeptical--I'm personally of the belief that if something look and sounds like a lounge, the food isn't going to be terrific because it's not the place's focus. When the waiter informed us that they had a few award-winning mixed drinks, my doubt only grew. However, the food I've had here has consistently been top-notch, well-executed, and deliciously authentic. I've been here a few times and have yet to be disappointed with a meal.(Side note: Oddly enough, despite the accolades, I've actually generally disliked their drinks--the one exception is the Agave No. 8, which is a delightfully innovative blood-orange, cinnamon, Royal Combier, and tequila reposado mix. Meh to the Lavender Mumbai, Chinese Mule, Jin-Ji Yang, Hakka, and Shiso Gimlet.)The interesting thing about Hakkasan is that things are both innovative and true to the spirit and tradition of Chinese food. Generally, authentic Chinese restaurants tend to focus on one area (wherever the chef is from), but Hakkasan manages to sample the entire country fairly accurately. But, onto the food!Appetizers: The steamed dim sum plate is a collection of little brightly colored jewels that distill the traditional flavors of hargau, shumai, etc., incredibly cleanly and purely. The fried dim sum plate is less strikingly delicious, but similarly precious in presentation. The jasmine-tea smoked ribs are to die for (the lacquer is beautiful), a standout of the menu. The soft shell crab and crispy duck salad are okay, but not terrible either--just not my personal favorites.Mains:On the whole, less impressive than the appetizers, but perhaps I'm just not ordering the right things? The meat-based dishes tend to be less appealing to me than the fish or poultry, as they are oddly chewy at times and tend to be over-seasoned. The exception to this would be the Hakka clay pot pork belly, which is lusciously rich and melts in your mouth. The red snapper with chili is not very authentic (or at least I have no ida which region it's supposed to be referencing!), but still delicious. Poultry tends to be my favorite here.Sides:Sides of bok choy and fried rice are standard for China--the fried rice is done Yang Zhou style (I'm guessing this because it's very close to the ""best"" fried rices I've had there), so it may be less seasoned than you would expect. French beans with minced pork are flavorful and pungently tossed with garlic.Desserts:I've only had the coconut pudding and selection of macarons here. The coconut pudding was truly a thing of beauty (little beads of grapefruit caviar crushing on your tongue, buffeted by billows of coconut cream, occasionally interrupted by the sweet tang of perfectly caramelized pineapple). I'm not a huge fan of macarons (blasphemy!) but enjoyed the Earl Grey and salted caramel ones (tip: combining the Earl Grey and blood orange ones is surprisingly delicious).I'm not really sure why other reviewers have had trouble with the service, as when I've gone, the staff have been fairly attentive. They also clearly know their stuff. For instance, my waitress there my first time was pale, tall, and blonde--and also fluent in Chinese, having studied in Taiwan for a few years. She was able to answer all of our questions with genuine passion for the food, and even conversed with us in flawless Chinese for a few minutes. This tends to reflect the ambiance of the place; an emphasis on high quality and finesse.All of this, however, is counterbalanced by the extravagant price tag! The bill will be approximately five times more expensive than your standard Chinese place, and I'm not entirely certain it's justifiable. I do keep coming back, however, so that says something.",3,0,1,Audrey L.,"New York, NY",91,21,0
3.0,7/7/2013,"Second visit and this time chose to go a la carte. The big problem this time was the service. Firstly, it was totally unclear who was actually in charge of our party. Secondly, the staff was totally ignorant of what gluten is. One of the members of our party has an intolerance and was restricted to about 5 dishes total (from their huge menu). It all seemed fine and conservative until it came out that they all thought rice contained gluten. Nope, that simply is not true.Food-wise, we were all pretty pleased. You don't get a ton of food for your dollar but what you get tends to be pretty great. The small plate ribs, Peking duck, and Chilean sea bass were all standouts. The menu is a bit overwhelming though and fact that the waiter seemed to only recommend particular dishes suggests that maybe the kitchen should consolidate and focus on the core.

4.0,7/1/2013,"I have been wanting to pay this place a visit since its pre-open days. When I first heard of Hakkasan from a friend I looked it up. And it is actually one of the very first fine dining Asian restaurants to obtain a Michelin star.I came here for brunch with two friends. There is a brunch prix fixe menu which included a variety of dim sum. One of my friends ordered that. The other friend and I decided to order off the dinner menu. Which interestingly is offered throughout the day. The dim sum was nothing too out of the ordinary. Maybe a bit better than the average dim sum places, nothing more. We started out with soft shell crab with curry leaf and chilli; and jasmine tea smoked pork ribs. The crab was good, but nothing too outstanding. As for the pork ribs, it was phenomenal. The scent of the jasmine combined with smokiness makes you salivate. The ribs were so tender that it falls right off the bones. To finish it, the ribs were brushed with Chinese bbq sauce. For entrees we had rib eye stir fry with Merlot and Chilean sea bass with Chinese honey (sorry, I couldn't help it. Chilean sea bass is just so delicious!). The rib eye was really tender and flavorful. It was just good. The Chilean sea bass was perfectly cooked. When I cut it in half, the juices oozed out. Glazed with Chinese honey, the sweetness brings out the true flavor of the sea bass. Amazing dish.Overall I enjoyed this experience. The authenticity of Hakkasan is unquestionable.

Everything we had was fabulous, both food and drinks, it's just that the atmosphere is a little off and so was the service. I've been to the one in Miami and it had the same sort of vibe. The place is just too darn big and when it's empty, as it was at 11:00 on a Saturday night, it just loses it's luster. I made a rese mainly because it was 2 blocks from Kinky Boots, which was fab btw, and definitely one of the best options in the whole dining nightmare of the Theater District. When you walk in you have to walk down this really long hallway and at the end is a ""reception desk"" You definitely feel like you're checking into a hotel. We were seated at a booth which was nice but like I said, the place was empty, a few unsuspecting tourists that probably had sticker shock when getting the bill as this place ain't cheap. We started with drinks, Lychee Martini for me and some sort of tequila concoction for my sexy date. Both of these drinks were VERY good but the illusion is that they're MUCH bigger than they really are, as they should be at $17 a pop. For food we started with the vegetarian dim sum selection. I'm not exactly sure what was in each of these pockets of heaven but each one was big, puffy, beautiful and flavorful...YUM! After  that we went with the Tofu, Aubergine And Shiitake Mushroom Clay pot in chili black bean sauce and you KNOW it's got to be fantastic if we finished the whole thing because I don't even usually like tofu! The pieces were large and pretty squishy but the sauce and the other ingredients made this ta die for. I like the fact that this place is vegetarian friendly as my date keeps kosher. We had absolutely no problem ordering and everything was SUPERB! We also shared the Steamed Red Snapper with chili sauce. This was a beautiful piece of fish with just the right amount of kick and again, beautifully presented. When I mentioned that the service wasn't great, we had to wait an extra long time for our second drink, and with the place being empty, there really isn't an excuse. Also, the busboys were over zealous and a few times tried to clear our plates when we were still eating. I guess if you combined our absent waitress with the bus boys you'd have the perfect server.

My boyfriend and I were looking for an elegant, stylish yet fun atmosphere to have dinner. We made reservations at Hakkasan on a Sunday. Approaching the reservation desk the hostess greeted us with a warm smile; I knew we were going to have a great time. We were seated in a lovely table where it felt as if we had our private section. The cage like floor design was done in a way where you're unable to observe the opposite side the restaurant. I'm pretty picky when it comes to tables; I always expect the best! I don't feel like this place has a bad table.Now let me tell you about the food and amazing drinks and delicious desserts. We started with a drink called the Hakka and the Pink Mojito. WOW!!! I must say one of the best cocktails I've ever had.  Our sweet server Ying was very patient with us. We went back and forth trying to narrow down our selection. She noticed we were a bit conflicted with making our choices and offered her suggestions. My boyfriend and I have extremely different palettes, I like mild dishes and he loves his spicy food and I mean extra spicy! She recommended a hot and sour soup which he loved. We then ordered the Hakka dim sum, crispy duck roll, and jasmine tea ribs to start. All three starters were delicious, savory and made me want to order more of each.  As per our main course we had the Pepper beef rib eye with Merlot and the Chilean sea bass with honey. Both dishes were amazing, they melt in your mouth.  For dessert we ordered the homemade macarons and a refreshing mango/champagne, ice cream with rhubarb.   I may just have to stop by Hakkasan and enjoy their macarons rather than buying them at Ladurée. They were beautifully presented and appealing to the palette. As we were exiting, we noticed a lounge adorned with beautiful lavender orchids.  It seems like a great place to enjoy cocktails before dinner. A friendly manager, Michael, approached us.

5.0,6/13/2013,"Hands down the best dinner I had in New York. Everything, starting with booking the reservation (thanks, OpenTable and Yelp!), was most convenient and pleasurable.We arrived a little early and were graciously greeted by two gorgeous hostesses in red dresses. They asked if we would like to order drinks while they prepared our table, and led us to a swanky looking bar. It was empty but in an inviting (as opposed to deserted or unhappening) kind of way, so I sat down and ordered the Ling Ling Sling (trivia: the bar at London Hakkasan is called Ling Ling, so it's probably the drink special over there). Here, it is the Hakkatini, which is an apple juice and Absolut Mandarin blend. Anyway the Ling Ling Sling is a gin and grapefruit juice-based drink, and induced a solid buzz. Pleasant to taste, even for someone who dislikes gin.  They took us to our table, which was in the corner of a mood-lit thrush of other tables. I noted that the other patrons seemed to be on fancy dates with designer footwear and was secretly thankful that we'd dressed up---it was our first night in NYC and we had plans to go to Pacha, which we had incorrectly assumed to be a high-class exclusive club. We ordered the crispy chicken and fish fried rice, and wok-fry sea prawns with lotus root. The portions are small, so even if you want to share, plan to order one dish per person. Both were absolutely delicious; crispy chicken and fish fried rice often runs on the salty side, but this was taken down a notch to cater to the fusion palate. For dessert we got the assorted macarons, which were presented in a little straw basket. The salted caramel ones were exceptional.

5.0,6/12/2013,"By far the best lunch I have ever had. The place is beautiful, very big, but cozy at the same time. The service was impeccable. My experience is usually to be rushed through my meals during lunch and I did not feel like that at all here. Our server was Jill, she was very attentive and made some really good reccomendations. Also, when my party noticed their favorite plate, sweet and sour pork tenderloin, was not avaliable the manager; Eric; was very accomadating and provided us with the dish.All of the food was delicious. The best appetizers in my opinion were the Roast Duck Pumkin Puff and thee Truffle and Roasted Duck Bun. The Shanghai Dumplings and Crispy Duck Roll are mouth watering. I've never had better dumplings. For entree you definitely have to have th Chilean Sea Bass with Chinese Honey, it melts in your mouth. For dessert have the fruit platter, perfectly ripe fruit.

Walking down the hallway, I felt like I was walking into super chic eatery in China (well at least how they make it look on TV) My boyfriend actually commented on how it looked just like the Chinese places he was wined and dined in when we was overseas for work. At the host stand were all beautiful friendly girls who showed us to our table. We sat down and I just looked at this magnificent restaurant, and thought wow, I think I need to visit China soon! It didnt take much time before our waiter Greg greeted us. He was very sweet, polite and knowledgeable  (which I alway appreciate since I use to be in the restaurant industry myself). I started with something I knew... RIBS! I guess you could say I enjoyed them... I order 6 servings! AMAZING! I recognized that when they came out greg would immediately cut them off the bone, what great service! I enjoyed everything else I had there too, from the lobster to the dumplings. Nothing was heavy, it was honestly just right (that is a lot coming from somebody who doesnt like to eat out!) This is how I want eating out to be every time.

2.0,5/24/2013,"Hakkasan, beyond the origins of the name (Hakka for Hakka people, san for the Japanese honorific suffix, humorously), never interested me. Between its Time Square (calling it Hell's Kitchen is disingenuous realtor finagling) location, $10-$15 million renovation, and 11,000 square foot sprawl, calling my feelings at the prospect of dining here tepid would be no mean understatement. But sure enough, restaurant week rolled around, and I found myself pushing open the massive iron doors, walking down the absurdly long absurdly marbled hallway, into the booming club - no, that's the dining room. If it weren't so fastidiously bisected by wall carvings, wooden screens, and banquettes, people might start gravitating towards the center for communal casual head nodding through the bald-faced club soundtrack. The waitstaff are dressed like bouncers and club hostesses, and the lights only grow dimmer as the hour grows later. Therefore, strictly by ambiance, a Hong Kong banquet house it is not, nor is it a peerless measure of Chinese fine dining, a la Vancouver's finest. Given both the colloquial associations of Hakka (guest people) and the presumed goals of the restaurant with respect to Michelin stars, the crass ostentatiousness and brash atmosphere come across as terrifically discordant.  However, while the self perpetuated caterwauling was irritating, it would have been tolerable if the food had measured up to the standard implied through its price. Unfortunately, Hakkasan hamstrings itself with gimmick dishes, like an $888 plate of abalone. Including items such as that only serves to set the customer on edge, as it makes clear that the restaurant isn't above either catering to status through idiotic displays of wealth, or simply ripping people off. How then does the average customer feel confident that they're getting food commensurate to its price? People seldom complain about the organ they sold to eat at Eleven Madison Park or Per Se, primarily because these places craft experiences and dishes that are impossible to have elsewhere. Simply put, save the dim sum, equal, and in many cases, better versions of Hakkasan's dishes exist elsewhere. The entrees M and I received were lukewarm and their flavors were just as phlegmatic. Irrespective of restaurant week, most of the food was disappointing. And in normal circumstances, even the dim sum is questionable, given its steep prices. While inventive, (pumpkin and duck pastries? An ingeniously matched combination of flavors and textures, especially in the face of the lightness of the pastry shell.) the idea of paying around $4 a dumpling is a bit hard to stomach. It's a bit easier to forget, once they arrive, as they are generally constructed and plated impeccably. But you can only eat with your eyes for so long, and while the dim sum can be excellent, it seldom transcends its presentation. Opting for something more substantial and less aesthetically pleasing quickly becomes a dangerous proposition, with entrees all hovering around the high $30s and low $40s. Unless of course, rice is preferred with your entrees, in which case you'll be adding another $4. While not nearly as tone deaf as offering a $345 dish of Peking Duck, the gall to charge so much for plain rice in the face of already wildly expensive middling entrees is utterly beyond the pale. Fortunately for Hakkasan, they are owned by a fabulously wealthy group of individuals. Unfortunately for Hakkasan, even the richest of fools won't throw money into a pit forever.It's human nature to glorify an expensive eating endeavor. The lingering buyer's remorse manifests itself not in a proclamation to never return to the restaurant, but to instead convince oneself and others that the food wasn't so bad, to reclaim something which is sadly impossible to salvage - satisfaction. There exists an idea that, if viewed as an occasional splurge, Hakkasan is worth it. This however, implies that eating a standard dinner here (an appetizer, an entree, dessert and a few drinks) is pleasant; something which is assuredly false. Piecing together a meal that satisfies from the jumbled menu is a nightmarish process, and attempting to do so without spending ~ $120 per person is an impossibility. The few heights of the food never equal the depth of your wallet's emptiness, in spite of the scattered, flimsy assertions to the contrary. In this instance, the Emperor has no clothes.",13,9,7,Jordan S.,"Manhattan, NY",865,273,672
4.0,5/19/2013,"My stay in New York needed some good Chinese food. The concierge at my hotel agreed and recommended Hakkasan. He booked my family a table immediately. He told us it was in walking distance from the hotel, so as we walked through the streets of New York city looking for the Chinese restaurant called Hakkasan he told us about, we thought we were going the wrong way, until we saw a small sign. A large minimalistic black door was the entrance to Hakkasan, and as a family, we thought this was pretty strange for a Chinese restaurant... We walked inside and a huge hallway to the restaurant stood before us. We were seated by a rude condescending waitress with a terrible attitude and an annoying voice. She sat us down and began blabbering on about the place (taking away a star because of her). When she left, I started to adapt to the environment. It seemed like a upscale ""modern Chinese"" kind of restaurant, and this was no place for a family. There was a full bar right across us, and I could tell that my 12 year old sister felt uncomfortable, as did all of us as a family (the place was packed with young trendy 20 year olds who were getting drunk and enjoying a classy dinner). We ordered the Hakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter, Peking Duck, and a few others I can't necessarily remember. The Dim Sum was OK. It was not anything special and one of them left a bad taste in my mouth. However, the Peking Duck was amazing. I can't complain. I wish I remember the other dishes we ate, but they were all just as good.Don't think I will be back here until I'm in my 20's but hey, I can't complain.

4.0,5/19/2013,"This was my second visit to Hakkasan and my experience was stellar. I happened to be eating at the bar alone, for a quick but fabulous bite in the Theater District. There was a bit of commotion at the bar, caused by a rather unruly patron. Without as much as a complaint, the manager approached me and generously compensated me for any inconvenience. This is the ultimate in customer satisfaction, which is a big plus in my book, and often lacking in many high end NYC dining establishments. And, lest I forget the most important thing, the food was delicious. I am a vegetarian, and Hakkasan does have some vegetarian options, clearly delineated on the menu.

1.0,5/9/2013,"I had one of the most most unforgettable experiences I've ever had in a restaurant and not in a good way.  My dining companion and I were showered with glass bits after someone managed to walk right by with an uneven tray full of wine glasses, which then fell on the floor right under our table. It was freaky, and I even felt shards bounce on my knee (good thing i was wearing wellies) and crunch underfoot.  A quick visual ascertained no blood on my knees, and we tried our best to move on.  We even declined an offer to transfer to another table as we didn't want to make a big deal.  But when I got up to use the facilities and returned to the table, I noticed many shiny slivers of glass in the banquette seat where I had been sitting.  We then asked to be moved and asked for fresh drinks.  At no time during or after this incident did a manager come and pay us a visit and check in on us.  I would think that slivers of glass on customer's lap would warrant at least a visit? An apology?  Servers were nonchalantly (young, way too casual and inexperienced as well?) and noisily dealing with the cleanup and the mess.  I dont think I even recall hearing an apology.  We also literally had to stand up or flag a waiter several times (to get drinks, coffee, to move tables).  A check was unceremoniously dumped without comment during desert. Never mind that there were at least 8 open tables surrounding us.  It was if they wanted to quickly wash their hands of us and the unpleasant incident.  The food and decor under normal circumstances I  would give 4 stars to. It's good but not Michelin good on par with Anissa's quality. I won't bother to elaborate, as there are plenty of reviews on the menu and decor.  Really though, for half the price one can eat as well, or better, at Amazing 66 in Chinatown.   This is how the math works out: 4 stars for food and decor and -3 for service.I don't usually go off on a restaurant, but this was just unreal.",1,0,0,Kayo N.,"Brooklyn, NY",164,367,139

Almost made me think that we were eating street food in Thailand. We were asked by 2 waitress if we wanted dessert menu after we already asked for the bill.Food:  The dim sum platter is excellent. Good hot oil and spicy sauce. Fancier than what you get in China town...The duck salad tastes great except that there is very little green in it, so it does get too greasy and meaty towards the end.

Due to being born of Chinese decent and eating Chinese food for most of my life, I normally don't go, ""Oh, I'm craving authentic Chinese food today!"" Actually I've never craved Chinese food before till Hakkasan. I've passed by this place several times because it's so easy to overlook. They didn't have a sign (it does now) and the outside makes it look like either the lobby of a fancy hotel or a lounge. I've been here a couple of times now. Once for dinner, once for drinks, and twice for dim sum, each time was an amazing experience. The food is of great quality but pricey for the portions they serve. The duck is amazing. The drinks are amazing. The desserts make me drool (earl grey macaroons!). The dim sum TO DIE FOR! Brunch is $39 and is so filling. Boyfriend and I shared it and we both still couldn't finish it!The menu is seasonal which is awesome because you get to experience the creativity of the chefs.

4.0,5/2/2013,"Yum! This review is specific to their brunch menu. Everything was delicious and the portions were great, we had more than enough. Each order of brunch comes with a guava Bellini, yummy! We ordered 2 brunches and an order of pork belly stew. Everything was sensational and fresh.  Brunch comes with a variety of fried dumplings and steamed dumplings, it's obvious they use quality ingredients. I like my dumplings, whether steamed or fried, well filled whether it be shrimp, pork, duck, etc. Don't worry, these are not those doughy types. In addition, a stir-fry udon with plenty veggies and roasted pork. Personally, I'm not a fan of udon, but this was great. Perfectly seasoned, not overbearing with salt nor oil. Other delicious items included in our brunch: roast pork buns, large pork spring rolls, and for dessert 6 large different flavored macarons. The macarons were nothing spectacular, taste like most other macarons I've had in NYC. The best macarons I've had were in Pittsburghs, but that's another story. The pork belly stew was well made, came in this cute clay pot. I was too full to have more than a taste. I like it when the pork belly is cut into cubes, thus allowing the customer to separate the fat and skin from the meat. It was a nice touch when the head waiter explained the different items as they brought the food out. You don't want to have to guess what's what. The decor is really fun, but they could update the padding to their cushioned benches. Butt prints. Service wasn't bad. They would come by occasionally and check on you, but they failed to refill our water automatically.

2.0,4/23/2013,"Finally made it here after Hakkasan opened almost a year ago now. I'd honestly been avoiding it because it is so incredibly pricey I couldn't believe it- BUT, I am a sucker for Asian cuisine. Well let me say- as far as ambiance and cocktails go- this place is great, I would definitely come back for a signature drink at the bar and to gaze at the miraculous interior: there is a mixture of clean white marble and deep- warm wood, all cut with the same repeated geometrical pattern, reminiscent of a honeycomb. The patterned walls, much like traditional chinese screens, section off areas within the restaurant's massive interior, so that each table feels incredibly intimate. So- when we dined and saw the prices, I knew were my money was going- to all of the custom-cut marble and wood in the space.To drink- a Chinese Mule- vodka, sake, cilantro, ginger, lime and ginger beer. YUM! The Chinese version of a Pimm's cup.To start- the dim sum platters, both steamed and fried.The steamed ""Hakka steamed dim sum platter"" was impeccable. You get two dumplings of each variety: scallop shumai, har gau, prawn and Chinese chive dumpling, black pepper duck dumpling.The fried "" Hakka fried dim sum platter""- well, they were just strange... and not great. They come out looking like sweet pastries you'd get at a bakery, not what I want as my dumpling experience. You are given two of each options: roasted duck and pumpkin puff, crispy prawn dumpling, XO seafood puff. The worst was this triple-layered seafood puff, the outside was crunchy, then the inside was chewy and doughy and then the inner-most section had an overcooked piece of what was probably squid/calamari. The textures combination and the flavor was just awful.For our main- we had ""Stir-fry black pepper rib-eye beef with merlot."" This was really delicious, and we paired it with the spring onion and egg fried rice. It was a great pairing because unlike fast-food chinese restaurants, the fried rice was mild, and not drizzled in layers of soy sauce- it came out white (the way traditional fried rice is prepared). This coupled with the rib-eye, which was drenched in sauce made for a perfect pairing. The issue here, was not the taste, but the price. The rib-eye, which was at most 1 lb of beef, was $45. That is insane.Ultimately a lower-rated establishment for the negative experience with the fried dumplings and the price tag in conjunction with portion size.

4.0,4/3/2013,"Ate here 3 times in a month and I think I'm qualified to give some opinions! So read and buy this review here!1- Food: It was great! Even by Chinese standards, those food taste great. I must say though, certain dishes do not really stand out in terms of taste, but the presentations and the creativity in the ingredient choices make up for it. The beauty of the food here is that both Chinese and Westerners can appreciate it. If you are the type of Asian who tell me that you can get better value in Chinatown, or the type of White person who comes here for Fried Noodles + Red Wine. Please proceed to the pizza store next door. 2- Decor: I absolutely love the entrance (beside the heavy ass door) and the loooong walk in. The entire place is dimly lit with candles, and has a floral/tea scent. The inside - the tables, chairs, utensils, chopsticks, walls, etc etc - are not extremely upscale but they do convey a pretty authentic vibe. I do not recommend sitting near the window, it does not look pretty when it is bright outside. Sit in the inner sections, or come at night. Avoid the Sun at all costs. One sentence to describe the overall ambiance: Not too romantic, but sufficiently flirty and ambiguous. 3- Desserts/Drinks: The cocktails here are so delicious! Try them! Ask for recommendations if you don't know what you like. They are good mix of alcohol, sugar and citrus. Easy to consume and does not make you feel like you are gulping down pure vodka. As for the desserts, you WILL SEE those macarons in chinese steam baskets. DO NOT ORDER THEM. They are really not that good..... but considering its price, it's still pretty good value for your money. I like PB&J best! Nevetheless, nothing too special about the desserts, very typical french/new american stuffs.4- Price: You will drop anywhere between 60-100 here per person depending on if you ordered alcohol & desserts. The food items are reasonably priced for a Michelin rated restaurant.Overall, I highly recommend this place. I don't mind going back a fourth time... not these 2 months though... It's a pretty remarkable restaurant considering that it is only in business for a year and has already received Michelin rating.EDIT: I already came back for a 4th time... =.=!!! Had to attend a friend's bday dinner. Oh this place is sooooo bad for large groups (we had 10 people!). And NEVERMIND about my dessert suggestions, the menu just got CHANGED last week. Gosh... MY PB&J!!!!! T-TLet me add a very very important reminder/tip: This place is ideal for 3-5 people!!! The dishes are portioned to accommodate 3-5 people only.

2.0,3/31/2013,"Ok so came here on a saturday night at 8PM with 4 friends from high school for a semi reunion kind of thing. Sat at the table close to the bar. Wasn't too crowded or loud which was nice and the DJ put up some nice tunes.So for appetizers we got the Fried Dim sum platter, the crispy duck salad and the bbq ribs.Crispy Duck salad is mostly duck instead of salad which was surprising, but I didn't like how the duck lost it's temperature so quickly. It came lukewarm which was fine but just got cold too quickly. Fried Dim sum platter was decent - don't know why people are raving about the authenticity of the dim sum....Doesn't taste too authentic at all. The shrimp dumpling was slightly too oily. I took a bite and immediately felt the grease just coat my tongue. Shrimp was good but that oily feeling was not. The pork dumpling was really good though! Didn't get a chance to try the red bean one.Bbq ribs were nothing too special. I like mine to be fall off the bone but thats not a huge deal breaker that it wasnt. It wasn't anything special though so don't get this if you are thinking about it.Most of the drinks are really good. For drinks we got the Strawberry basil martini, the Hakka, the plum sour, the jin-ji-yang, and the chinese mule. I liked the Hakka and strawberry basil martini the best. For main dishes we got the Pipa duck, soft shell crab and hakka pork belly clay pot.The pipa duck was probably the best dish. Really tender slices of duck, but it was super small portioned when it was served. Again not surprised given the restaurant but just making the comment to manage your expectations.The soft shell crab was good and had a good spicy aftertaste.Hakka pork belly clay pot was actually very generously portioned which was surprising given the portions of the other dishes. It was pretty good. I loved the garlic in the dish. You can eat it and its yummyFor the dessert, we got the assorted Macarons which included the following flavors: pistachio, blood orange, almond coconut, earl grey, caramel, yuzu and cassis. Macaron shells were glossy and cracked quintessentially. Very good. I thought the earl grey macaron with chocolate ganache in the middle was the most interesting. The yuzu one was slightly tart which was good given the usual sweet flavor of macarons. I liked these a lot So why 2 stars. well I just think a combination of some of the plates being rather cold, the long time to bring out all our dishes, and the quality to price point ratio is just not worth it. Plus my drink (plum sour) came with a flower that I was told was edible and I think it gave me an upset stomach later during the meal. I had about 30 mins of stomach pain towards the end of my meal....I think if you are looking for a cool asian fusion experience, just go to buddakan...everything is much better there and slightly cheaper.",3,0,1,Harry L.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",291,132,96

We ordered the following:Chive flower dumplingsSticky rice in lotus leaf with chickenHakka pork belly claypotFrench beans with minced pork and preserved olive leafSpring onion and egg fried riceThe chive dumplings were absolutely delectable, the most perfectly steamed dim sum dumplings I've ever had, even more so than the soupy dumplings I had at the Shanghai branch of Din Tai Fung, which was my previous king of all dumplings. The fried rice, even though it was the plain egg and scallion kind, was absolutely ethereal; it was the most perfectly made fried rice I've ever had. It seems I'm over-using the phrase ""most perfectly made"", but seriously, these really were that perfect. The sticky rice in lotus leaf, pork belly claypot and french beans with minced pork were very excellent dishes in their own right. Some of the best I've ever had as well. I also ordered a pot of of their oolong tea, which had perfectly balanced flowery notes.The service was also amazing, although I noticed that none of the staff was actually Asian, except for one female server. The kitchen was open to the dining room, and looking in, and I didn't see a single Asian chef.The one downside? This lunch cost $46 per person, which makes it the most expensive Chinese meal I've ever had. Was it worth it? Abso-effing-lutely yes.",4,3,2,Andy L.,"Forest Hills, NY",64,24,11
5.0,3/26/2013,"One chilly January evening as I scrambled to get out of the office, I rang my girlfriend. We had made plans to meet up for dinner/drinks with a friend visiting from out of town. She suggested Hakkasan... seeing how our friend was staying in midtown and we all worked nearby. At first I was slightly off put by the idea of a high-end Chinese Restaurant.  Since moving to NYC I have not once found decent Chinese food. I'm a HUGE skeptic when it comes to Chinese food having had grown up in Vancouver and Toronto where they have some of the best in the world. Reluctantly, I decided we could go for drinks and see how we felt about dinner. Upon entering Hakkasan, immediately I felt like i was transported to an exotic experience with a kind of zen like quality, but not one without a sense of trendy exciting vibe. They had a fantastic DJ, a banging looking crowd and the BEST COCKTAILS I've had in my life. With a vast array of personally designed cocktail creations, the drinks not only just tasted amazing, but were personified equality in beauty, enhanced with the subtle wavelike illumination of the bar. Having had been so impressed with my first cocktail, The Hakka (Belvedere vodka, Ama No To junmai sake, coconut, passion fruit and lychee juice), I had to have another. This time i ordered the Eden (Black grapes, rose sugar, lychee juice andsoda water), a nonalcoholic beverage but asked the bartender to add a shot of Vodka in. Let me tell you. Those muddled grapes kept me ordering all night. After many cocktails we decided if they took such care into the drinks, imagine how the food must be. We ordered a few plates form the bar menu and were immediately upset that we decided against dinner. The dim sum platter was fantastic. The shrimp to die for...even the popcorn...out of this world. POPCORN?!!?! right? Anyways, I digress. This only made one thing abundantly clear...WE MUST RETURN FOR DINNER.We returned not a week later and ordered everything! Everything is hand crafted and made to order. Even each order of soup is made to order. It doesn't just stop at dinner. The dim sum... omg the dim sum. I salivate even thinking about it. The food is unbelievable.I am proud to say that my opinions of NYC Chinese Food has been altered forever. Hakkasan is a DELIGHT. Definitely worth every penny.

New Yorkers are not fans of Times Square because it's busy and touristy, so when a restaurant opens up in that neighborhood my first thought is that it's not so good and that it's a tourist trap. I have heard many excellent reviews of Hakkasan in Miami so I figured why not lets give this bad boy a try. We went on a Saturday night so the restaurant was pretty busy. The crowd wasn't bad, the service was a-ok, and the food was decent but I wasn't impressed. We started with the dim sum mixed platter which was just ok, but it definitely didn't stand out. Then we got the mushroom lettuce wraps which was more nuts then mushrooms and was just a tiny tiny portion and it wasn't anything special. After came our jasmine tea smoked ribs which were my favorite dish there, they were juicy and full of flavor. For the entree we got the black truffle duck which was a little overpowering for me, and the duck itself wasn't cooked to perfection, we ordered a spring onion and egg rice with that which was good. For dessert we tried the peanut butter and jelly parfait which was pretty good, and the macarons which were bad very bad!

Anyway, we sat down and service was slow. Our waiter was slow and non attentive.  Other tables were complaining too.We ordered the salt and pepper squid(calamari) and veggie dumplings for appetizers. Both were amazing, especially the dumplings. For entrees, my wife ordered the veggie noodles(forgot the name) but they were amazing as well. I ordered the spicy snapper but the waiter accidentally ordered the wrong dish so I had to wait 10 mins longer for my dish.When it finally arrived, it was disappointing. No very spicy and WAY overpriced at $35. My wife's 'cheap' noodles were superior to my dish. For dessert, we split a ginger pear plate. Carmelized pear, ginger, and ginger ice cream. It was delicious albeit small.We didn't order any alcohol since we're not drinking at this point but the subpar Thai iced tea cost $6 and a small diet coke was $5. We don't care about the pricing but expect better food and service.  Not very accommodating either as they refused to add chicken to my wifes noodles.  I've never gone to Buddakan but everyone has told me that it's superior to this place.

I have been to Hakkasan six times since they opened, and the service has always been lacking. Upon my latest visit last weekend, however, it was the worst. No one paid attention to me when only 70% tables were full. I ordered the brunch set (which already includes guava Bellini or ice tea) and an extra cocktail a la carte because I was unaware of such cocktail inclusion of brunch set. The server never asked what I would like to choose from Bellini or ice tea, nor did he bring out any cocktail that was already included in the brunch set.

We started with cocktails - one Hakka (more tropical with lychee and coconut) and the Chinese Mule (more refreshing with cilantro, lime and ginger).  Both were really really good and I would come back just to have drinks.The food was overall really solid.  We started with the salt and pepper calamari and the steamed dimsum.  The calamari had great flavor and the consistency of the squid itself was really soft and light while the coating was nice and crispy. The steamed dumplings were good (loved the presentation) but I can't remember which was which and not too memorable.Then for mains we had the spicy prawns and the stir-fried beef tenderloin.  The shrimp was actually pretty spicy (which is a good thing for me)!  I really loved the different flavors..more of a thai-style spicy than a chinese-spicy.  The beef was cooked perfectly and the quality of the meat was clearly very good.For dessert we shared the PBJ and the chocolate ganache, with the PBJ being my favorite.  Interesting desserts and not overly sweet...perfect way to end the meal. The service for the most part was friendly and helpful (server made some great recs), but it was really slow.  It didn't seem like a particularly busy night as there were a few empty tables but it took foreverrrrrrrrr just to get our check.  It kinda just ends the meal on a low note when you're trying to pay and get going. I would definitely come back for drinks.  I would come back for a meal only if they partake in the next NYRW as the food just doesn't justify the regular prices.  I don't mind spending money on a nice meal but at the end of the day, it's still just chinese food with nice packaging.  You could easily just hop on the train to Chinatown and get a really fab/cheap meal without all the frills for a fraction of the price and then go to a cool lounge for pricey drinks afterwards!",0,0,0,Flora S.,"New York, NY",1,41,0

You feel classier when the size is reduced, even with Chinese food!To anyone who are here for the restaurant week menu, it won't make you full. Probably you'll have to grab a bite in Chinatown later. Or just eat lots of rice in the first place. That helps you know.And speaking of rice, this is just my very own grievance: why cannot a single Chinese restaurant cook delish white rice? I'm talking about the tender and soft textured clingy jasmine rice with moist and flavor,  not fried rice, and certainly not the white rice to be used in fried rice(yes, there is a difference). Fine most people don't eat white rice except for the east Asian I get it, but am I asking too much even from a Michelin restaurant?Rest assured, above par food quality",2,2,0,YJ W.,"Manhattan, NY",31,14,1
2.0,1/21/2013,"Yikes. My experience may be aberrant, but this wasn't a Michelin-star experience. Not by a long shot. I've eaten at at least a dozen starred restaurants, and all of them are expensive but worth the cost of admission. I go in expecting to pay at least $100/pp, and I expect some level of service and food quality in return. Hakkasan didn't deliver. The space itself is beautiful. A little clubby with neon/dim blue lighting, incense in the entryway and house music in the background, but overall a trendy and upscale spot. Our first course was actually delicious; I had the fried dim sum plate and others at my table shared a variety of other appetizers. I will crave that little fried pumpkin appetizer, I swear. Crunchy, savory, just a little sweet, not overly greasy. Everyone was pleased with their appetizers. Second course was the first foul. One member of our party didn't receive her main course for about 10-15 minutes after the rest of the table started eating. We waited as long as we could and reminded multiple servers... but the remainder of the table had cold entrees by the time hers arrived. And while tasty, it wasn't an experience. Did I eat the best sweet and sour pork of my life? Yeah. But it was still just really good sweet and sour pork. Not worth thirty dollars for 6 ounces. Desserts were also fantastic. I have no complaints. Great quality. Not too sweet and the perfect size. Now came the major stumbling block. From the time our check hit the table, we waited 50 minutes to pay our bill. When the bill came, a bottle of wine which we ordered wasn't on the check. So we alerted the server (yay honesty!). Cue another incredibly long delay. 10 minutes. 15 minutes. 20 minutes. We ask the server about the delay and he tells us he doesn't know where the sommelier is, so he can't figure out what kind of wine we ordered. So we tell him. Check comes. No discount. We're now over an hour post-bill-arrival. One member of our party pulls aside a manager, politely, to let them know about the wait. We tell him the food was very good and we're planning to pay, but thought he should know about the service issues. He discounts a round of drinks and was genuinely surprised at the waits we experienced. +1 star. To be fair, it seemed like we were the only table that suffered through such poor service. Maybe it's because we ordered off the restaurant week menu. Even so, it's hard to understand how this place earned a Micehlin Star. To put it alongside wd~50, Rouge Tomate, or Ai Fiori is a joke.

4.0,11/6/2012,"Probably the best Chinese food restaurant in town, based on quality of food, service, presentation, and decor. -1 star for price, but I guess if that's not a concern for you, I would be a regular here. We came here for lunch on Saturday, but my family friend called in advance requesting a couple of dinner entrees, including the Peking duck with Kaluga caviar, Traditional braised lamb shank, Black truffle roasted duck, and Braised zucchini with crabmeat and crab roe. (yup, you need to call in advance if you want to have items from their dinner menu during lunch; otherwise, you can only order stuff from their lunch menu). As for the rest of our order, we had the Scallop shumai, Prawn and Chinese chive dumpling, Shanghai siew long bun, Har gau, and the Three style mushroom stir-fry with macadamia nut. Now all the dim sum dishes were very fresh and super delicious. The presentation was also delicate and beautiful. Although a bit pricey, but definitely worth trying every single one of them. The three style mushroom stir-fry was alright, mushrooms were very fresh, but there weren't too much taste to it. Healthy choice, but probably would skip this next time. The braised zucchini with crabmeat and crab roe was ok too; crabmeat was pretty much just frozen crabmeat before and totally not comparable to what would be served in Shanghai. But I guess for $19 in a restaurant like this, it is what it is. Now onto the good stuff: the Peking duck with Kaluga caviar was amazing. The duck skin was extremely thin and crispy with a slight sheet of meat underneath (yum yum! so darn good), but for most Chinese, it's pretty wasteful (they only give you 16 pieces of skin and that's it for the whole duck). The carviar was undoubtedly amazing and that's the premium you pay for.  The lamb shank was also good, but since I'm not much a lamb fan, I only had a tiny piece for taste. And last but not least, I loved the Black truffles roasted duck. The portion was small, but it was absolutely delicious; very tender and juicy duck meat, perfectly sauced and not too oily, and most importantly, the smell of black truffle was the perfect touch to this dish. Service was friendly and attentive, but we had to wait a very long time for the dinner entrees to come out (whole lunch lasted about 2.5hrs). I guess since it was special order during lunch time, we have to overlook the wait time a little.

Hubby and I went for our anniversary in September.  On a Monday night the place was pretty deserted. We walked by twice before we found it (doorman? Really?) and the place is definitely impressive and Vegas-y. Don't even want to think of the cost of the marble latticework. Manager was thoughtful enough to give us complimentary champagne and dessert for our anniversary, so thanks, Hakkasan. Service in general was borderline over the top - we clearly had two personal servers in addition to the flood of bussers and managers zipping around the place. But I've worked in high-end restaurants, and management can rest easy that staff is living up to the oft-ridiculous standards of fine dining. We ordered the tea-smoked ribs, jasmine tea-smoked chicken, spicy seafood fried rice, and stir-fried beef tenderloin.  The ribs might as well have been called boneless because I've never seen meat fall off the bone like that. I was a bit apprehensive about the chicken but that's quite possibly the best chicken I've ever eaten.  I couldn't come close to trying to describe the flavors except to say they were the best flavors of all time. The spicy fried rice was delicious but they didn't skimp on the jalapeños, so no false advertising there. With a bottle of wine, three entrees and comped dessert, the bill was $180 without tip.  They have a nice wine list and an appropriately snooty sommelier, but I know a lot about wine and didn't require her services. I think she was a bit miffed about that. :)We went back with hubby's sister and her boyfriend two days ago and the Michelin star has obviously increased business. We were hoping to have a few drinks and some ribs at the bar, but ended up grabbing a cocktail table because the bar was packed. Service was more understated but still impressive. We ordered 2 orders of ribs, the Hakka steamed dim sum and vegetarian platter, duck salad, and mushroom lettuce cups. I'm not a fan of high-brow dim sum and unfortunately Hakkasan didn't change my mind, but the ribs were as perfect as they were the first time; sister-in-law is a vegetarian and loved the lettuce cups; and having never eaten duck I could say without question that I would eat the duck salad every day for the rest of my life.

Make no mistake this is not your average midtown gastro experience laden with goofy tourists and over priced generic plates. The unassuming entrance may seem intimidating at first but as soon as you open the front door you're greeted with welcoming hostesses, nary a line nor snobby attitude in sight.I couldn't disagree with you more Mr. Platt in regards to the 'crematorium' entry, in fact the clever separation from the entrance allows all guests to sit comfortably without feeling as if they'll be interrupted by a rotation of patrons coming and going. The bar spans along the entire length of the space allowing for a very comfortable stint before being seated. The bar staff is less run of the mill and more like chemists as they enhance cocktails with smoky infusions and bespoke ice cubes. But not to worry they have an option for the most average to adventurous of bar fly's. Beginning with some apps, it mustn't go unsaid that the salt & pepper squid was the highlight of my savory experience with the crispy duck roll a close second. The impressive assortment of dim sum rivaled that of any Hong Kong dining experience I've had. And each plate following perfectly proportioned for anyone who likes to nibble on a few great plates rather than commit to only one. (They're just too tasty to pick only one!)  It's absolutely necessary to leave room for desert, that, after your first visit will make you consider skipping your main and heading right to the sweets. These deserts are works of art that don't get old after two or three bites. Instead each spoon-full is an intense combination of flavor and texture like sea-salt, caramel, grilled blood orange and chocolate ganache or the beautifully designed 'terrariums' that house the like of teeny tapioca, caramelized pineapple, coconut under a glass like sugar 'lid' needing to be cracked before enjoying. The fruit plate, hands down, is the best in town & last but not least the macarons are a must have, even if you have to get them to go. Each one perfectly crisp on the outside and smooth on the inside with exotics flavors such as cassis or jasmine tea. If you're looking for a new place for a great brunch, it's worth the trip uptown on a Saturday morning. Trust me this experience will rival any western outpost with a very economical menu that definitely gives you your money's worth. Starting with jasmine and lemongrass ice tea and an array of dim sum.

That said, nothing tasted overtly bad (tasted a number of dishes) and service was good so I guess if you don't care at all about price, it can handle a big group and is a 2 star place?",1,0,0,citizen l.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,125,0
5.0,9/4/2012,"Hakkassan is one of my favorites from London. It's very good and not that expensive if you know what to order.1. The small dishes are better than the mains. For a table of 2, order 3 appetizers and 1 main. Salt pepper squid, duck salad and the gai lan with garlic sauce are fantastic.2. Keep it simple with the mains. The more fanciful the description, the higher the likelihood of disappointment. Pipa duck is a favorite.Lastly, do not try to park in the area.

Thedecor makes you feel like you have been transported to a place where only therich and beautiful go, but the service and hospitality made you feel like you were in there home. From start to finish it was excellent. Before being taken to our table we decided to have some cocktails in the ling ling which is right by the gorgeous marble bar. I reccomend the plum sour, it is a refreshing and exotic take on a wiskhey sour and it is delish!!!!! Our server Mark was personable and attentive and so was Simone who is also a staff memeber. me and my husband were very well attended to. For dinner we sat in the main dinning room, our server was Harvey and he was amazing. He is the ninja of serving. He was seamless and effortless with his movements through the tabe and with his service. He had a strong knowledege of the menu and knew when and when not to be @ the table. You should request him!!! Amy one of the memebers of the wine team was amazing she recommened a wonderful Malbec that we enjoyed as well as a lovely rose.

3.0,8/23/2012,"This is a 3.5...Hakkasan is a spectacle.  It's more than a restaurant, it's an experience.  When our group walked in for a weeknight dinner reservation, it was pretty empty and the only diners were people on business travel.  This is probably due to the location and high prices.  The menu had a lot of good selections, and we had the chance to try lots of different things.  The standouts were the sea bass entree, jasmine tea-smoked chicken, and all the desserts.  Desserts were incredible and really unique.  The dim sum was good, but everyone thought you could get better for a tenth of the price in Chinatown.  The lettuce wraps and clay pot were also good but not amazing.  The also had Asian beers which was pretty cool.While it's been getting some harsh reviews in the news lately, I don't think it's really much different than your Tao, China Grill, or Buddakan, and I enjoyed my time here.",1,0,1,Lauren L.,"Manhattan, NY",88,235,0
5.0,8/14/2012,"I'm giving this place 5 stars because of the impeccable service.  I went for Restaurant Week -- wouldn't have tried it otherwise (which is the point of Restaurant Week.  Yay!).  The place was hard to find -- I didn't see any signage out front.  When the door magically appears in front of you, you walk into a long, dark, blue, incense-filled hallway that leads to smiling women who are expecting you to arrive.  Once you get out of the hallway, you see that the place is PALATIAL.  White marble, soft leather. private-ish tables and rooms.  Just huge and beautiful.  For lunch, we had the steamed and fried dim sum platters.  Steamed was a little better, but fried was light and flaky.  For our meals, we had the rib-eye stir fry and prawns in curry.  The curry had a slight heat that built up as you ate it, and the beef was juicy and tender.  Their egg fried rice was clean and healthier-tasting than fried rice elsewhere.  For dessert we had a selection of macaroons, which was fine with me because I love French macaroons.  Back to the service, the server put our napkins in our lap, and when I had to go to the restroom, someone appeared next to me and walked me there.  At the end of the meal, they brought us hot damp towels to wipe our hands.  We went for a weekday lunch, and while I can't normally take off two hours in the middle of the day, Hakkasan was a supremely relaxing break from the daily hustle and bustle.  I think this place would be great for a business meeting, or to really impress a date in the Times Square area.  And they have really cool business cards.",1,0,1,Dione D.,"Atlanta, GA",104,606,455
4.0,8/9/2012,"I came here last Friday with a big group and we had an amazing meal. Let me back up - the restaurant's exterior is discreet, comprised of a black chinese screen that suggests there is a trendy spot inside from the blueish light that peeks through the cutouts. I actually had to ask the woman standing outside the door if I was at Hakkasan because I didn't see a name anywhere. Upon entering, you are led down a long, white hallway with pink and blue lighting and greeted by lovely women at the reception desk who then show you to your party. We had a drink at the bar (a $16 dirty martini to be exact) while the late-comers rolled in. We were then seated at a large rectangular table in a semi private area, partially enclosed by more chinese screens. The dining is family-style so we shared a plethora of food including the spicy prawn with lily bulb and almond, vegetarian dim sum platter, stir-fry wild mushroom and water chestnut lettuce wrap (amazing), vegetarian noodles (I was with some non-meat eaters if you couldn't tell), and some duck that I don't remember the name of but it was delicious. Service was also excelled - we had a bevy of waiters constantly making sure that our plates were cleared and our glasses were never empty and our head server was great with making recommendations from the menu.

4.0,7/19/2012,"Came here with my boyfriend on a Friday evening a few weeks ago. Had never been to this location before, but my boyfriend had been to the restaurant in London and had only good things to say about it, so thought we'd check out the Midtown location. Was very easy to get a reservation and that became apparent when we walked into the beautifully decorated building, but it was surprisingly empty for a Friday. The front of house staff were very well dressed and gave us a very warm welcoming. We were seated after being led through the restaurant which really is beautifully designed. To begin, our waiter brought out a complimentary sake-fruit blended cocktail which was very delicious. We ordered a bottle of wine and some appetizers including the vegetable Shanghai dumplings, the mushroom lettuce wraps and the crispy duck roll. The food was excellent, my only complaint being that the lettuce for the lettuce wraps should be larger so you can actually make a wrap out of it as opposed to balancing the contents of the stir fry on the small piece of lettuce provided. For our main dish, we split some items as well including the veal short ribs, the sweet and sour pork and a side of the chicken and crispy fish fried rice. The sweet and sour pork was by far the best sweet and sour pork I had ever eaten in my life. Garnished with pineapple and pomegranate, every bite was beyond amazing. The veal short ribs were not my favorite, but that could be due to my personal dislike for soy sauce, however they were on the chewy side as well. I probably would not order them again. The service throughout our meal was excellent, just the right amount of attentiveness. We were in a slight rush as well, as we were going to the theatre, but we gave ourselves enough time that we were about to enjoy the atmosphere and experience, but our waiter arrived with our bill promptly when we asked for it.

4.0,7/17/2012,"Hakkasan was a great experience - went with a group of 16 people and had a prix-fix menu. Despite being a large and somewhat rowdy group, the service was impeccable. They managed to serve us in a timely and extremely professional manner despite having to maneuver around an over-excitable group (half of us were standing and chatting in the middle of the aisles at any one time). Drinks - delicious. Perfectly mixed such that you were getting a decent amount of alcohol masked by expertly mixed flavors. The waitresses were also very helpful picking cocktails for us once we told them the type of alcohol/flavor we were partial to. The Hakka (signature drink) is a must-try as is the Strawberry Mojito. Food - Loved it. Everything was delicate and delicious. I was hopelessly in love with the Sea Bass - melted in your mouth and trickled straight to your heart. Everything was extremely fresh as well. The crispy duck is a must-try as well. We ordered the Dim Sum platter which comprised of 4-5 different types of dumplings - each of them with their own unique flavor. Presentation of food also deserves a mention as it was interesting. For dessert, get the chocolate mousse. Ambiance - Trendy, Upscale and an overall fun night out. The restaurant itself is huge and reminded me of some Meatpacking establishments (buddhakan, spice market, Ajna Bar etc). Great place to go for a fun night out with your girls; however, this on the pricier side so bring a fat wallet. IMO - worth every dollar.",0,0,0,Nipunee D.,"Astoria, NY",127,39,47
5.0,7/6/2012,"The moment you walk into this place you know a lot of creativity, sophistication, time and money went into making Hakkasan beautiful.  The Marble entrance is stunning and the intricately cut out decor & soft lighting creates an atmosphere which no other fine dining restaurant does in NYC.  The space is big but it has been cleverly designed to still feel intimate. Also love that the kitchen, the hub of the restaurant, is centered in the space, although you wouldn't know it.  The edgy music with live DJ diverts any kitchen noise and when you do get a glimpse into the cool blue lit walls you see a brigade of chefs mastering creative and wonderful dishes.  A real treat!The bar is super cool - the back wall actually looks like it moving!  Cocktails are delicious and the bar staff are knowledgeable, friendly and great personalities!  The service cannot be faulted, each server has their own flair, their own personality and their advice is note-worthy, especially for someone like me, who can't make a decision!  We couldn't decide what we wanted when I went with my friends so we ended up having one of everything on the small plates menu and then we went straight for the desserts!  When it came to choosing the wine, the sommelier was great and helped us pick a wine that complimented our meal.The food is just delicious!  Love the salt and pepper squid and the dim sum platters are perfect for sharing!  Crispy duck rolls are worth a mention for sure and the sesame prawn toast with foie gras is not something you would expect but they are great, truly melt in your mouth tasty! Also had the roasted mango duck and the jasmine smoked chicken ... WOW!Desserts were a world of their own.  If you fill up on savory here you are missing out!  Very creative and each one was a work of art.  We had the fruit platter and it was stunning, with an array of exotic fruits.  The summer cherry ganache was decorated with gold leaf and presented to perfection!  The Strawberries and champagne was, without question, our favorite!  Im not going to tell you what was in it ... it needs to be tasted to be given the praise it deserves.

Which brings me to the other point of nickle and diming you, especially for the price they already charge you for food and drinks.What topped this off was the martini for sure.  That was tasty, but they better be for their price.To wrap this up...2 apps, 2 entrees, 2 tinis and one dessert - expect to pay over $100 a person.  Tips not included.But if overpriced Americanized Chinese food is what you are seeking, by all means give this place a try!",2,1,0,Jacob Y.,"New York, NY",184,466,120

So many walls separate the tables that it's hard to grasp the large size of this restaurant. The food is very mediocre in taste and extremely overpriced for what you actually get.

I've never recalled Voss tasting like this, so either something must have changed in the formula or someone at the restaurant filled this up with tap water. Lettuce wrap with mushroom - a bit on the salty side. Decent dish but more lettuce would have been niceShrimp toast with foie gras - so underwhelming. This reminded me of the fried shrimp balls at dim sum. The foie gras inside the fried shrimp ball was barely noticeable and did not make the fried shrimp ball taste more than the cheap dim sum versions. Chilean sea bass with honey - a bit on the heavier side but good.Ostrich cooked Chinese style - best dish of the night. Super soft meat with a little kick at the end. Fried rice ($8) - the waiter said this could be shared between the whole table, but basically it was 1.5 cups of rice and we shared it between 5 people so obviously this rice was not enough. The chocolate dessert was very underwhelming to say the least. Apple tart - basically a tart apple with apple sorbet on the side. Would not get this again.

The place is nice if you like that Vegas type of setting.  You know the type, it's the kind of place that tries very hard to come off as extremely extravagant.  Kind of like the model chick that's not exactly a model but tries to dress like one only to over do it a bit too much, every time.  Know what I mean?  Like, she'll go over to the designer house that she thinks is the most chic and extravagant, pick out an entire outfit and every single accessory that matches, and then wear it all in one night.  Nothing left to creativity because she has no true sense of style.  She just figures, ""let me buy the most expensive shit out there, wear it, and I'm cool!"". .. Not the case dear..  But hey listen, there is an entire demographic of douche bag brokers, bankers, oil sheiks, european steel moguls, and goofy dot com billionaires/basketball team owners that do love these kind of places, and they will LOVE Hakkasan like no ones business.  So don't fear for their survival, they will be just fine.  FOOD: We ordered the Lobster XO.  It had mushrooms and about 5 pieces of Lobster that I'm not even sure are actual Lobster, especially after the entire Lobster Salad at Zabar fiasco earlier this year  -_-.  Anyway, it was $59 and totally not worth the price. We also had the Jasmine Tea smoked ribs which were actually ok, but I think it was mostly the sauce that made them bearable to be perfectly honest.  The Salt and Pepper Squid was another miss. The best part of our meal was the Apple tatin, which get's a star on it's own! = YUM!We had some drinks as well, and overall had a very pleasant experience, but I feel like I could have saved an extra $100 just by going over to Buddakan and would have felt completely better about my meal all around.  All in all, don't shoot this place down just yet, but don't go just for the ""cool"" factor because ""cool"" it isn't, pricey however it is  all day!

4.0,6/8/2012,"I tend to thing in general that you can only dress up Chinese food so much and beyond a certain point you're just plain overpaying.    There's a feeling of that here although I did enjoy the restaurant.  It's a bit more commercialized and commoditized than the quaint original in London.  The long, marble entrance does have the feeling of a new age mausoleum.  The long bar area is beautiful.  I'll go back there  and drink on someone else's dime anytime.  One thing though....when did it become socially acceptable for the bartenders to purposely ignore you and pretend they don't see you standing there waiting for a drink?   Are they mistreated by patrons that badly or is the attitude supposed to add to the cache?  I feel like saying I'm getting drunk with or without you, so save it.One other note, the Signature Menus and the $300-$800 entrees.  The ship has sailed on this gang.  The bubble burst and not even Wall Street dopes are paying those prices anymore.  In any case, our waitress ended up being super nice.  Her frankness and informality were refreshing.  I liked the room quite a bit.  The lattice work breaks up the large room nicely and  the large tables would be great for groups.Quickly on the food though:*LOVED - duck salad, salt and pepper squid*LIKED - dim sum platter, soft shell crab, roasted cod, spicy prawn, pipa duck*PASS ON - jasmine tea ribs, wagyu beef with spicy peanut sauce, fried rice.The desserts were impressive to the eye but only OK to the taste.Bottom line, I would in fact go back to bar despite the subpar service or recommend for a group but overall, the differences with some of the other similar Asian themed restaurants are basically negligible.",0,0,0,Paul Q.,"New York, NY",0,168,31

3.0,5/21/2012,"I keep telling people again and again, it's about the food!!! Not the decor. I don't care if there are solid gold tables and chairs and diamond encrusted urinals, it's about the food. With that said, simply put the food was agreeable, not outstanding, just A-OK!Now for the full rundown...I booked for 6 people and had to give my credit card details to hold the table or it would be charged. I think this is a mind trick, you could probably give any card number. Anyway, honest me gave the correct one so I ended up planning my entire day around the time that was booked.When we walked in the place was pretty empty and our friends were at the bar. I was waiting for the bar tender to finish ""cooking"" some cocktails, because it took forever. I just wanted two glasses of wine. What's going to happen if there are more people waiting for drinks?We then get seated at a nice oval table. The waiter seemed nice and then the somellier showed up with the wine list. I didn't like the format at all and the selection was a bit off. It should be simple, list the whites and reds by region and grape, that's it. Don't go deeper than that in terms of the ""feeling"" it should give you. Anyway, she was really nice and helpful.Soon enough we order some small plates which were ok. The crispy duck rolls were just ok, not worth $8 a roll (you get two for $16). Then we got some chicken and shrimp dumplings which were pretty good. The order then on was black pepper rib-eye, venison, chilly prawns, mushrooms, and some rice.The rib-eye was really good but had too much sauce on it which really kills the flavor of the meat. My friend suggested venison, which I have never had before, so we got that. Once again, too much sauce on it, you're killing the poor deer!!! Lets respect the dead just a little bit please!! The rice was surprisingly good, which they wanted to clear but I had it kept there. The wines we got were among the best from the overpriced low range selection. 3 bottles later we were sitting and chatting the night away and then there was no one else. Our waiter was starting to get a little annoyed since this might have been his only table of the night. You want good decor, fine, I will sit and admire the restaurant for a few hours while I occasionally order something from the menu. Happy?!I just remembered, the one thing I didn't like was while the table behind us was being served the waiter knocked me in the back of the head, which has never happened in the most crowded and cramped restaurants anywhere. What could I say? Nothing. Sure he was sorry.So Hakkasan is good place to go if you want mainstream Chinese food with a nice decor. As far as the food itself goes, you can get better Chinese elsewhere in the city.The Good:- Decor- SommelierThe Bad:- Pricey for Chinese- Stale service- Getting knocked in the back of the head with a tray- Slow service at the barThe Ugly:- nothing to report",1,2,1,Sabin C.,"Scarsdale, NY",93,326,547
4.0,5/15/2012,"Generally I'm not a fan of modern Chinese restaurants (ie smaller dishes and higher prices), but Alan Yau's Hakkasan and Yauatcha restaurants in London changed my mind (and also my parents').My parents found out that Hakkasan opened in New York, and so they were curious to try it. The place was large and lovely, and the service was excellent. I tried a cocktail, and it was well-made and delicious. We ordered a soup, cod, stir-fry lobster, zucchini with crab, pork belly, and a three-mushroom stir-fry. Everything was scrumptious. You could probably find similar dishes with much lower prices elsewhere, but the food at Hakkasan tasted more delicate and everything was cooked perfectly. The pork belly melted in our mouths and the cod had the perfect texture. If you want to fork out money for fancy Chinese food, Hakkasan is worth a try. If you want more bang for your buck, you should probably just go to Chinatown.We were short on time and so asked the waiter to recommend a dessert for us. He asked chocolate or no chocolate, and we wanted chocolate. So, we got this dessert that was a more complex and yummy version of chocolate mousse.

4.0,5/4/2012,"Went here on a Friday night.  It was busy but b/c it's such a big restaurant, it didn't feel crowded.  Beautiful space.From reading the reviews, we knew to expect that it would be expensive so we weren't shock by the price.  Between the 2 of us, we shared the steam dim sum platter, pipa duck, the wagyu beef with spicy peanut sauce with a side order of white rice, and a dessert (can't remember the name but was good).  The dim sum was very nice and delicate.  They were unique and tasted fresh.  Not the usual dim sum you get from standard chinese restaurants.The pipa duck was similar to peking duck with the crispy skin and was served with hoisin sauce but w/o the pancakes.  So eating it w/ the white rice was a nice accompaniment.The wagyu beef was melt in your mouth tender and definitely had a kick.  I love spicy food but my bf does not, however, he was able to eat it b/c it was so delicious.  The white rice did help to balance the spiciness for him.  This is a very expensive dish (around $70) but worth it.They had a great cocktail menu.  We love drinks with muddled fruit, which they had.  The whole dinner with about 3 cocktails came to about $100/person.  This is a good place to take out of town friends (similar to the buddakan experience).",0,0,0,T T.,"New York, NY",5,63,6

While I was waiting for my ""date"" (who ended up getting pulled over for something that I don't even remember, nor do I care), I had a Hakkatini (a variant of a pink martini), a ""pink mojito,"" steamed dim sum and clay pot steamed pork belly.The food was to die for. I am a big fan of Pork Belly. Not many places do it right, not even the authentic asian eateries. But Hakkasan did a fantastic rendition of a clay pot pork belly. As the clock ticked and I become increasingly frustrated with waiting for my date, I ended up being placated by the amazing and considerate service provided by the servers and managers there. I ate until I was full (which I rarely do these days) and listened to the great house/ ambient music that Aaron James spun. By the time my ""date"" showed up, I didn't even care, nor did I want to hear the excuse (I never do, drama is boring). We ended up having a drink each and I headed out to another bar all warm and happy. On top of all that, I was coughing and sick and wore a heavy sweater on top of a black dress (no one seemed bothered by it), which made me feel as if they were more about the service and people rather than the hot spot superficiality that most hot spots are known for.

The London locations are both superior in location, food, decor and service.  The Miami location in the Foutainebleau Hotel is also superior in location, food, service and decor. Since New York has opened I have two separate experiences; once in the dining room and once at the bar. Both times I tried different drinks, different dishes but always had a Dim Sum item. The Dim Sum is very well prepared, beautiful and delicious. All the other items were good but not as I have had in London which is much better.  The decor of the New York branch falls short especially compared to Buddakan, Tao, Ajna and Spice Market.The drink list is large and all drinks are served very nicely. During the two visits we tried eight different cocktails; all average to good BUT none were as good as the London location. The staff do try hard but will need more time. Service staff was professional but due to the opening over staffed. The most irritating and unusual was the burning of incense in the reception area which could be smelled though out the restaurant.Great for expense account diners, great for Dim Sum, great for date if you are in Midtown at 8th and 43rd.

4.0,4/13/2012,"I'm a big fan of Hakkasan having been to the one in Miami Beach many times before.  The decor, and ambiance are really great.  I loved the layout inside, the entrance is very cool, and the bar is nicely laid out.  The place definitely has the wow factor going for it.  I thought the food was well above average, and almost at the 5 star level.  Everything we had was delicious.  Some more than others, which I'll go into.  Yes, the prices are ridiculous, but if you don't want to spend the money there are plenty of other alternatives.  This is NYC after all.  Small Plates:Duck w/ Mango:  Awesome!  The duck was perfectly cooked, and the mango was the perfect compliment.  A must try in my book.Jasmine Tea Smoked Ribs:  I'm a rib connoisseur.  I'll travel an hour out of my way for good BBQ, and these were some of the best I've had anywhere.  Now, are they going to compete with the best places Texas, or St. Louis have to offer?  No, but they're as good as it gets around here.  Right up there with places like Blue Smoke & Dino BBQ.Dim Sum Platter:  I have no idea what was inside these different dumplings, but they were all good, and I loved the spicy dipping sauces that came with them.Main Courses:Silver Cod w/ Champagne & Honey:  My favorite fish dish.  Perfectly cooked, and the sauce was fantastic.Peking Duck:  Let's just say that this place knows how to cook duck really well.  I thought the Mango Duck was as good as it gets until this arrived at our table 30 minutes later.  I've had Peking Duck at dozens of different locations here in NYC, and this is easily top 3.Sweet & Sour Pork:  I thought this would be pork overload after the ribs.  I was sorely mistaken.  I ate half by myself, and almost fought my friend over the last piece.  Very good.Tiger Prawns w/ Chili:  I liked this almost as much as the cod.  The combination of spices was incredible. Braised Turbot & Pork Belly:  At first glance I thought this would be my favorite dish, but it was a little underwhelming.  The pork belly wasn't crispy enough, and the fish was just so so.  Not a bad dish, but not my favorite.All in all this was a great experience.  Very similar to Buddakhan in both the scene, style, and quality of the food.  I'll be coming back for sure.",2,0,0,Mario F.,"Manhattan, NY",55,64,0

I was so overwhelmed with the curried puff pastry, I could barely taste what was inside the Dim Sum. I suggest a little less pastry or go easy of that seasoned batter.Wild Mushroom stir fry with Macadamia- This costs $30? You have to be kidding me.Tiger Prawns W/ Chilli tomato sauce - The best dish I have had so far! I am willing to pay a lot more for this. I loved the curry, the prawns were at perfect temperature. It's fresh and authentic. I ask for more dishes like this.Red snapper with chilli sauce- Pungent Spice! This would be the time when my server sent me over the edge. My tongue was burning and I could not find him. The snapper was so dry. I don't mind spice but please do warn your guests next time. So the food was mediocre, but I would have tolerated paying $30 for some stir fry mushrooms if the server attended us more frequently. I had to ask where he was twice in between meals.

4.0,4/8/2012,"Okay, just got back from brunch at Hakkasan.The restaurant is beautiful. The servers are beautiful. The music is soft and on the clubby side. At night, this is probably some super chic club-like eatery a la Tao or Buddakan. But during brunch, there are a lot of families, many with young children. The restaurant is very dark, even during daytime, but everyone is seated in the window-side section at brunch, where ample sunlight streams though the windows.The weekend brunch menu features a big dim sum section, with maybe 40+ varieties of dim sum. The dim sum items mostly range from $8 to $15+, with the majority priced at $10. Each dim sum item comes with 3 pieces. The restaurant also serves their normal menu during brunch, or at least, most of their normal menu.I over-ordered a little, because I wanted to try a bunch of different things. I'm also including the prices here since I don't think any of the below dishes are on the online menu right now.Prawn and Chinese Chive Dumpling ($8)Beautiful and delicate with a goji berry on top. The green-colored wrappers were a good thickness and steamed just right, the filling fresh and tasty. The quality was comparable to Chinatown Brasserie. Very good.Shanghai Siuw Long Buns ($10)Aka soup dumplings aka xiaolongbao. These were smaller than the ones at Chinatown Brasserie and contain less soup (and less sweet). I enjoyed the taste of the soup filling, but I prefer CB's because theirs have more soup.Baked Venison Puffs ($12)I remember reading somewhere that Hakkasan's Baked Venison Puffs are great. But I thought they're only all right. The venison taste was too subtle that I missed it entirely. I'm biased against baked puffs in general though and normally don't like them. Hakkasan's venison puffs didn't make me change my mind.Seafood Dumpling with Chinese Yellow Chive Soup ($15)The presentation was... curious. The crescent-shaped dumpling was gigantic (4 inches long) and looked really bloated in the soup bowl. Ehh. But once I took a bite, I was pleasantly surprised by the tastiness. The filling consisted of scallop, crab, shrimp, and shiitake mushroom and was really umami-ful. The soup itself was also very flavorful and packed with umami.Yuzu Parfait with Caramelized White Chocolate Ice Cream ($15)Nice presentation, refreshingly citrus-y and the ice cream was also delicious. Very enjoyable.They also have a very decent sized tea selection, with around 15 different varieties of tea. They have tie guan yin, dragon well, pu-er, etc.. Most of the Chinese teas are from Taiwan. I like how the teas are part of the brunch menu itself rather than on a separate drinks menu. Teas are $8-12, not sure if it's per pot or what.Service was very professional and attentive. No complaints except for one minor hiccup: the server who brought my dessert was too heavy-handed and my plate landed with a thud. One of the yuzu parfait pieces actually fell off its perch. She apologized, but it was somewhat of a O_o moment for me.Overall, a very good dim sum brunch. Everything was high quality and well-executed. The price point for dim sum brunch is on par with The Modern Bar Room (my favorite restaurant in the area). Since both are equal-distance from my apartment, Hakkasan will go on my weekend brunch / lunch rotation along with The Modern Bar Room on days that I don't feel like taking the subway to Chinatown Brasserie for high quality dim sum.",4,0,4,Lucy Y.,"Manhattan, NY",11,29,123
3.0,4/7/2012,"I came in for lunch during Good Friday.  This was the fourth day they had been open.First off, the decor is simply amazing. Second, they have a really good cocktail menu; however the beverage service was very slow.  The cocktails take forever to prepare, as I received my last drink towards the end of the meal versus when I ordered at the beginning of the meal.  In addition, I had to request for my drink status during my meal since I was getting thirsty.  The plus is that there is a wine sommelier that is available to suggest pairings for food.  Now on to the food.  We decided to try a bunch of small plates (dim sum) and then wrapped up with their Hakka Noodles.  The dim sum was well prepared definitely a higher level then what you get at the mom and pop shops.  The Hakka noodles were somewhat greasy.The manager stopped by the table when we were seated, but it would be wise for them to stop by during the meal to check and see what we were eating and if everything is ok.  For some reason they kept stopping by the table across from us to greet some lady and 2 other corporate guys stopped by her table as well gave them their cards.  The waiters also took the chili oil and soy sauce after a couple of dishes came out and then we had to request for the items again.They need to really get their game together because, hard working people will not feel comfortable spending their money with subpar service.  Treat all the customers as the same! At this time I would only recommend corporate clients here because of the subpar service.  At least you can get a good nights sleep knowing it's not coming out of your paycheck!",1,2,0,Arvind A.,"New York, NY",11,46,39
5.0,4/4/2012,"If Thomas Keller and Martin Yan got together on a new restaurant, it would probably be called Hakkasan.  How lucky we New Yorkers are to finally get this amazing concept as there are few other cities in the world that could ever appreciate, expect and afford cuisine of this caliber and an experience this exacting.  I am one of the lucky New Yorkers who knew someone that knew someone that got me on the short list for a pre-opening meal, before the paint on the door was even dry.  Let me tell you about my experience.First, really there isn't enough I could write to do justice to the first impression of the restaurant.  The ornate and commanding door is opened and you are hit in all your senses right away.  The smell of light perfuming incense, the soft candle lighting and the expansive depth of the white marble hallway.  As you walk down, being a New Yorker, I appreciated that they dedicated all this space, just to make my entrance feel more grand (instead of thirty more seats).  Beautiful coat check girls in tailored dresses greeted me and didn't look disappointed or annoyed when I held onto my coat.  The matching girls at the hostess booth gave me another clue that all the details would be thought through.  I was taken to the bar to wait for my party and found a high fashion bar that would blow away anything the Tao group had tried; but at the same time, I found bartenders who were totally approachable, engaging and knowledgeable (very un-Tao-like).  Drinks were fun and complicated, the kind you want the advice of a mixologist to make sure you don't waste your time.  I tried about three different drinks with more fresh ingredients than anyone should ever have to remember.  I knew they had skills when they made an absinthe concoction that went down like 20 year scotch. My party came and the hostess allowed us to catch up and enjoy a drink.  She waited for my sign that we were ready.  Can you imagine that happening at Buddakan?  We asked for the tour and she was happy to oblige.  Trust me, you'll want a tour.  The labyrinth of hallways helps make everyone's area feel private without being seedy.  The hostess gave us the history of the restaurant, the names of the rooms, the background of the owners and advice on dishes not to miss.  She sounded like she had been there for years, yet they were still counting hours.As this has already gotten quite long, I won't bore you with too much more.  Needless to say, you should expect your server to help step you through ordering as they have it down to a science.  The dishes are classics with many names that sound familiar but in ways we've never experienced.  If you're lucky enough to have ever had real homemade Chinese food, you know what a simple and elegant feast it can be.  Now magnify that because you are getting those same tastes but with quality ingredients that frugal home cooked Chinese moms would very rarely splurge for.  I guess that's what makes the food so unique.  In case you want some easy recommendations, definitely order one small plate and one entrée per person and then plan to share.  Don't leave without trying the salt and pepper squid or any of the duck dishes (you won't regret it).But I would be remiss if I didn't take a minute to describe the service.  I'd heard a high-end hotel  advertise that their service was ""unobtrusive and attentive"" - the managers at Hakkasan must have taught those classes.  It seemed like they were working on ""our"" schedule, not the other way around.  They could tell when we needed something, not by raising our hand or looking for them; rather, they knew when our drinks were empty - how quick of drinker I am can tell a lot about how long before I'd want to be asked for my next one, and they seemed to actually pay attention.  They didn't rush plates on and off the table as if it was a race, more like they just appeared/disappeared at the right time.  When I was done, I was full and satisfied - completely.  I felt like I got to learn a ton of interesting facts about the restaurant and my server.  I felt like I was able to order food exactly how I like it, spicy but not too spicy.  They steered me away from tastes that weren't going to do it for me, and instead, recommended flavors that I can still savor.  All in a location that engages you the entire time with its elegance and simplicity.  Critics, New Yorkers, tourists - it isn't everyday you'll be asked to pay steep prices for Chinese food, probably for a reason - you get what you pay for.  I hope you're hungry!",2,2,2,Zoe B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0
4.0,4/4/2012,"Came here for the opening- beautiful space with a winding hallway, long bar, and a labyrinth style maze of tables in the back room- it probably seats 200 people. A little too ""corporate place trying to be fashionable""- kind of a W Hotel vibe. There is a special sommelier station for people who want to do wine tastings. Similar style to Nobu and Imperial 9 but food is way better than Imperial. The banquettes have Chinese motifs such as dragons- nice touch.I'm not much of a tofu eater but Hakkasan's is perfectly silky like a creme brulee; fois gras dumplings were quite delectable although a tad too fatty for my tastes. I also tried a bass and chicken dish; the poultry was great just too spicy for me;  Peking duck with kaluga caviar was certainly tasty but not to the point that I'd o out of my way for it. They have a lot of great dishes on the menu like truffled egg noodles with enoki mushrooms, wagyu beef stir fry, and lamb shank. If you're looking to spend there's an $888 Japanese truffled abalone (duck & caviar will only set you back $345). I did love the Hakka cocktail- a twist on the pina colada decorated with lychee I probably had 5. Also tried a shizo leaf martini and a tropical whisky sour.  Every staff member was super nice and professional; some of them have DVF uniforms.",5,3,1,Elena V.,"New York, NY",104,191,232
