1.0,4/24/2019,"I have been coming to Barbounia periodically since 2009 and it has obviously been a favorite. Until this week. My companion and I brought friends from overseas for lunch and  it was the most embarrassing experience I have had in a restaurant in NY in the 20 years I have lived here. I am giving the restaurant one star because the service was fine.  But the food? It was hideous. The aperitifs were so bland and ordinary. So little taste. One of our guests and I are lamb aficionados but the lamb that was served didn't only not taste of lamb. It didn't taste of anything! It was minced something served up in rolls. Our fellow diners had shrimp. None of us asked what one usually does when you are out for a meal ""How is your...."" because everything was the same, bland, tasteless,  awful. Who is driving your kitchen now? Because whoever it is doesn't have any idea about what good cooking is. While I was trying to eat the mundane, tasteless sloppy food put in front of me, I looked out the window at the restaurant across the street and wished we were eating there. Next time we will be. Anywhere else except Barbounia. You will not continue to survive on Park Avenue South or anywhere else in Manhattan serving up the kind of slop you served us last Monday..",0,0,0,Bas S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0

5.0,4/20/2019,"Ambiance, food, music and everything is great! Except the service. Actually no, our waiter was the worst, he was angry, arrogant and did not even want to listen and take orders, the only thing he wanted was his tables to ask for the check and leave. I am excluding the whole service because the guys who brought the food to our table from the kitchen and the ones who refresh the drinks were very kind and nice. So the problem was specifically our waiter( I wish I had his name but I don't the only information I have is he is not very tall )However, about the food; it was good; we had hummus and spicy feta (amazing!!!) and calamari for starters, they were all good.For the mains we had lamb and bronzino( fish was not very good) Dessert was amazing- Warm nutella covered with soft dough and vanilla ice cream.However it is a really good place and will definitely go back.

2.0,4/1/2019,"Barbounia is built for a certain kind of person, and that person wants a loud, sizzling candle in their birthday dessert among a group of friends while everyone else looks along. This restaurant is so flashy that I seriously thought a belly dancer would pop out at any moment. That didn't happen, but I kid you not, there was an unnecessarily loud birthday song blasting through the entire restaurant every five minutes that made it so hard to converse; even the wait staff kept rolling their eyes and like they knew it was extreme. The waiter we had was present, but very robotic and stuffy. They didn't come across as friendly to me, in general. This was strange, but the actual restaurant is anything but stuffy. The grand arches on top, the throw pillows strewn about, and the expansive space do add a luxurious vibe to the space. Tuna salad - this was my entree, and I was so disappointed with it. It's first on my list because everyone should know to avoid this. The actual tuna was great, and comes with an egg, but I wish there was more tuna and less everything else, but nothing else besides the protein part was enjoyable. The worst part about it was that it was absolutely drenched in mayo, so much so that I seriously disliked eating it. Vegetable crudites - basic veggies, including carrots, green beans, cucumbers, and radishes. Obviously healthy, but so jokingly overpriced for what they're serving. Feta omelette - this is actually an enormous omelette, but the egg part tasted fake, and there are very few vegetables inside. It comes with a great little salad and some potatoes that I enjoyed, but the omelette was disappointing. Hummus - has chickpeas on it, and is a generous portion. Comes with this amazing rosemary bread that goes so well with the hummus. A Middle Eastern girl like me will have experienced a million types of hummus by now, and one thing I will tell you is that it should not cost $8.50 for a half cup of it. Coffee - they had no almond milk or soy milk (come on now...), but the coffee is good and there are free refills. They brought me honey to mix in.Overall, I really wasn't impressed with the food, and the ""see and be seen"" vibe isn't my jam, so I didn't think this was worth the money.",3,1,5,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",978,2060,1393
4.0,4/1/2019,The good.  Is the food. If you are looking for premium Greek food in a beautiful setting   Then this is the place. Maybe the best lamb kabobs I ever had.  My kids has the salmon which was also delicious. Spicy feta cheese for an app was also unusual and very good. My only complaint was it was a bit pricey and the waiter seemed to be waiting for us to place cocktail orders when we didn't want any.,0,0,0,Warren L.,"East Brunswick, NJ",0,34,23
2.0,3/30/2019,"It's the first nice day out all year with weather in the mid-60s, which apparently coincides with the day that literally everyone was born bc there were sooooo many birthday celebrations at Barbounia while we were there. How do I know there were a lot of birthdays? BECAUSE LITERALLY EVERY 10 MIN THEY WOULD TURN THE SPEAKERS UP AND START BLASTING SOME STRANGE OLDIES VERSION OF HAPPY BIRTHDAY REALLY LOUDLY. I was with a friend of mine and it felt like every time he was about to make an important point BOOM, the birthday song came through. Honestly can't you people find somewhere else to do a birthday brunch was the Bagatelle too crowded? (I mean to be fair it probably was)As for the food itself, I'm not gonna say it was bad, but it was really anything special. I've had food in the city that has completely blown me away, and this certainly wasn't that. Mediterranean food should have some more flavor and not be so generic, but then when you look at the crowd in the restaurant, it was all a bunch of early 20s somethings basically trying to go off on a boozy brunch. Everyone was there for the mimosas, and so it's not like they need to put a real emphasis on the food exactly. It's generic food for generic people, and that's fine if that's the sort of thing you're into. I wouldn't go out of my ways to make dinner reservations (unless it's your birthday and your birthday wish is to be a goddamn nuisance to everyone around you). I got the chicken sandwich for the brunch menu - again, it was fine, wouldn't go out of my way to eat it again.",0,0,0,Srikanth T.,"New York, NY",3,18,30
4.0,3/25/2019,"Anyone walking down Park Ave S has probably gotten a glimpse of Barbounia's grand architecture through its tall glass windows.But the ceilings weren't the only things that were high!!! The energy levels in the room were booming, and it's mostly from what look like recent college grads -- which is up to you to decide whether that's a good or bad thing lol. The resulting environment is reminiscent of a rooftop bar during happy hour: people talking and laughing obnoxiously loudly (myself included most likely?) and having photoshoots with their friends. But that'll work for some who are really just there for boozy brunch, aka us.My party of 6 did the $20 unlimited mimosas with table service, but had to move to the bar around 2pm where we were forced to get cozy with everyone around us. But hey...can't complain when there's champagne!!!!For food, our table shared a shakshouka ($22), canadian bacon eggs benedict ($19), and another dish that I can't remember -- indeed half the number of entrees as there were people, but sufficient given all the drinks we consumed. The real star of the show was the hummus though...smooth and zesty in all the right places!",2,1,2,Izzo C.,"New York, NY",483,111,397
1.0,3/17/2019,"This was the third time we have been to Barbounia, and it was quite a disappointment. The restaurant is beautiful, and the food has always been quite good, but our Sunday Brunch was made unbearable by the noise. The restaurant was packed, and the music was turned up quite loud. All the diners were practically shouting to be heard above the music . . . even the wait staff had trouble hearing as we were ordering. It was next to impossible to carry on a conversation at a four person table. To top it off, they would interrupt our meal every 15 minutes or so by cranking up the volume to the max playing ""happy birthday"" to a table. I felt like we were in TGIFridays. It was so painful, we all had to cover our ears. This happened three different times, so we cut our brunch short and left. The food and service was good, not great, but we were unable to enjoy our brunch at all. So disappointing. We won't be back.",0,0,0,mel h.,"Bellevue, WA",0,10,0

I will definitely be back.This last time the reservation was for 4 people at 1:15pm on a Sunday, Presidents' Day weekend. Our party wasn't all there until around 1:30pm but they seated us promptly when the last of us arrived. The place was packed but since it's huge, it never felt overcrowded or too tight a space. Every seat at the bar and restaurant was taken. It's a beautiful restaurant with high ceilings and a breezy / airy feel.We all chose the unlimited champagne brunch and our glasses were never empty for the entire time we were there. We ordered what we thought was the three appetizers for $19. Unfortunately, the waiter did not mention this only applies to the appetizers ""above"" the line. If my yelp reviews were based on things like this, I'd probably ding a star. It was pretty annoying because we definitely wouldn't have ordered the appetizers we did if we had known the special only applies to those apps. He did apologize but prob should have comped something. We had the hummus, the saganaki (cheese that arrives to your table in a literal fire) and the crispy calamari. They were all pretty good. Each of us also ordered an entree: the salmon scramble, the foie gras shashouka, veggie omelette and another omelette. The salmon scramble was delicious- eggs were perfectly scrambled, very light fluffy and buttery. The cream on top was amazing and there was a good amount of salmon. All the other dishes looked great and the plates were huge. No one came close to finishing their dish (especially given the amount of apps we had).I'd definitely come back here and recommend this place to anyone looking for a lively unlimited brunch with good food in a fun atmosphere (especially bdays!)",0,0,0,Elizabeth H.,"New York, NY",1,49,2

It came with fresh bread that we got several free refills of I split an order with my friend; green shakshouka and the mushroom khachaburi. Omg they were both so incredible. At first we were a little apprehensive about the creamed spinach cuz it literally just looked like frozen spinach smooshed into a cast iron but HOLY MOLY were we wrong. That green glob may not be attractive but dang did the taste deliver. The wild mushroom khachaburi was equally amazing and the egg atop it was cooked to perfection.

4.0,2/11/2019,"Restaurant week review:My friend and I came here during restaurant week, and had a three course lunch for an amazing price. I will say that if you come during regular times and you have regular prices, your meal will end up being pricy. But the food is worth it in my opinion. The portions are decent, the service was pretty quick. It was during lunchtime and the restaurant was pretty empty, but the waiters were very good at guiding us through the menu, and answered all our questions without a problem. Overall I'm a fan, probably won't go back unless I have an occasion there, but I'm a fan.The restaurant itself is really beautiful, they have pretty good music playing, and the Holiday decor is also very nice.

4.0,1/15/2019,"Ate at Barbounia on Sunday night. Been meaning to go for a while and it lived up to expectations. The service was excellent, all the waiters introduced themselves when we sat down, they filled water consistently, and didn't rush us for the table. The food was delicious! We ordered: Mezze (selection of 3 dips) and Crispy Calamari to start. Both were perfect! Calamari was cooked perfectly served with 2 delicious sauces, one red, one more zesty. The dips we got for Mezze were Fire-roasted eggplant, Hummus, and Spicy Feta. All were delicious, and the bread may have been the best part of the whole meal!For entrees I got the Lamb Kebab Terracotta. It was okay, but I wish I got the Duck. The presentation of the lamb was great, it came covered with bread kind of like a pie. The waiter cut it open at the table and it was steaming. The problem was the Lamb was kind of tasteless and the whole thing was on the salty side. Was perfectly OK - just not up to standard with rest of meal, and kind of disappointing for $38. Our waiter told us his favorite dish is the Duck, and I saw another table ordering it, and it looked really good. When I go back, I'm going to get the Duck. My girlfriend got the Branzino, and she loved it! Overall everything was very good. Highly recommended. Overall a solid restaurant, decent value for the money, and perfect atmosphere.

We asked for veggies on the side and for $9 we got a large plate of very fresh vegetables. We were very happy, and also got the delicious famous bread that always comes with the dips. We also had the Saganaki cheese which was to die for! It comes out sizzling on fire. It was not greasy at all and tasted sooo good. Next we had the greek salad and the green shakshuka!

3.0,1/6/2019,"Food:We started off with the hummus as appetizers. The hummus was creamy and simple. I like how they didn't add to much crazy flavors and let the chickpea flavor come out. The hummus came with some bread. The bread was by far the best thing we had. It was freshly toasted. Warm and soft in the inside but a slight crunch on the outside. My friends and I kept asking for more bread it was so good! For my entree, I got the Shakshouka Merguez. It's basically a tomato sauce with poached eggs and lamb sausage. The lamb sausage was pretty good but overall it wasn't anything amazing. It reminded me of a middle eastern dish. But dipping the bread into dish was amazing! If it wasn't for the bread, I think the food wouldn't be as good. We also got bottomless mimosas. They kept refilling the drinks even before we were finished with the glass which was great. For only $20, it's a steal. When you are done eating you just go to the bar and keep drinking til 4. Ambience and service:I love the decorations here. I like how it's a little bit more on the social side and you don't have to be dead silent eating and drinking. The service was ok. Our waiter seemed short with us and so did the bartenders.

While they all looked beautiful, my friends eggs were undercooked and my flatbread had a lot of cheese. In hindsight I would have ordered the falafal. I could have split my flatbread with a friend because it was extremely heavy. I got the mushroom one. The dessert was perhaps the best part.

At our table, the Taramossalata was good and the bread was yummy. But our two entrees were mediocre.

2.0,12/9/2018,"I have been coming here for years as this has been one of my favorite spots for brunch on the weekends. I came here for brunch with my husband last Sunday, and we were extremely disappointed with the service. First of all, our waitress was rushing us the ENTIRE meal. Relax, its Sunday, everyone wants to enjoy their brunch on their own time. Right when we were brought our appetizer, we were asked if we knew what we wanted for our main course, we said no. A few minutes later, we were asked again. And AGAIN. When WE were ready, we ordered our main course, because I do not think it's fair to be rushed out of a restaurant when we are just trying to enjoy ourselves.  Also, Barbounia is known for their bread that they bring, and little did we know (because we come here so often) all of a sudden, our waitress put a $4 charge for extra bread. When we asked her why this was done, because last time we also had her as a waitress and this was not done, she shrugged her shoulders and could care less. It is not about the $4 because when you are paying $100+ for brunch, it really doesn't matter, it is the principle of it and the fact that she just didn't care and just wanted us out of there.

3.0,11/30/2018,"The food at Barbounia is always delicious, and I love the atmosphere. However, the only 2 times I've eaten here, I've had subpar service, which is why I am giving 3 stars. The first time I dined here, we did not have a reservation, so we expected to wait, which is fine! We had some drinks at the bar and put our name in for a 15 minute wait, great. 45 minutes pass and we go up to the hostess to ask about our table. The hostess couldn't find us at the bar to let us know they were ready for us, so our table was given up...The second time, last night, I had a reservation at 8:30 for 3 people. We got there at 7:30, again expecting to have to wait at the bar, fine. We waited for the full hour until our reservation time, continuously checking back with the hostess in case something opened up. Several walk ins without reservations were seated ahead of us. At 8:30 we checked back for the last time with the hostess. She said they were setting our table and to close out at the bar, which we did in a matter of 2 minutes. Waiting at the hostess stand to be seated, all staff was scrambling around trying to find a table because they didn't have any available, although we were told it was ready. Fine, we got seated a few minutes later. Once seated, we ordered a bottle of wine. Glasses were brought to the table, at which point we put our food order in. Our appetizers arrived before ever receiving the wine. The waitress was pleasant and kind, which made up for the bit of a mix up at the hostess stand. Overall, although the food is good, I will be waiting to forget about the hostess service before returning.",3,0,0,Alexa B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",328,55,149

Between the drapery, the palm trees and the lit archs, just beautiful. It's definitely a trending spot. The service was amazing. I think our waiter's name was Francisco, I cant recall...either way he was great. We ordered the flat bread to share. Just a heads up, they're HUGE. The flatbread alone can fill you up. I ordered the short rib tahini and my friend ordered a sea bass meal. Everything was so well seasoned and cooked to perfection. They have an extensive wine list.

3.0,11/28/2018,"I came here for drunch with a large party and the experience was very ok. I would say the worst part was definitely the service - the restaurant was not busy at all when our party sat down and it still took 20 minutes for any wait staff to come to our table. The food was pretty good, the hummus and pita was especially delicious and I enjoyed my shakshuka main dish. The service again with the bottomless was not great and we constantly found ourselves flagging down the wait staff in a bid to get drinks refilled.

We had the cheese plate, grilled octopus appetizer And pasta with lamb ragu. All dishes were nicely prepared and delish! Removed one star because of the way they packed in the tables.

I stopped in for brunch recently and I have to tell you, the place is beautiful!  I arrived early for my reservation (as always). I told the hostess that I wanted to give her my card to checkmate any possible arguments over who paid the bill. They didn't know yet where we would be seated and therefore didn't know who to hand the card to. When we were finally guided to our table, I nearly fumbled the hand-off to the hostess. I finally got it into her hand just as my companion sat down. After that, it was smooth sailing! All the dishes we had were amazing. The hummus tastes exceedingly better than any I've ever had. I bet it's better than anything you've ever had too. I also had the Turkish eggs. Meanwhile, my guest had eggs benedict. Everything was awesome and it all arrived at the table in good time.

The ambiance, the crowd and the service I noticed was really good from the first five minutes I was inside. It was only me so the hostess sat me immediately.

So since he was unable to manage that order, I ordered a glass of white wine from happy hour. He served me a glass of Sancere, which was not part  of the promotional happy hour special.

I'm a student and I can't really afford much if I'm being completely honest but it was near by and my friend and I were down for a nice restaurant. We got this sampler with different hummus and salad and pita as an app. I ordered the salmon kebab and we also had two desserts. The appetizer was amazing and honestly, I would go back just for that. It was perfectly flavored and salted and was light yet slightly filling. It made for a great app and that BREAD WAS AMAZING! My kebabs were a bit over cooked and I wasn't a fan of the rice it came on, but it all tasted very nice and refined and clean so I was still content. The salmon was also a bit dried out but I don't mind that but I know others might. Our desserts Silan and Kanafeh were really unique and out of this world.

We had a couple of glasses of full priced wine (happy hour is not available at a table ) and the 3 item mezze platter. We enjoyed what we consumed so the price overall was no option. Suddenly we were rushed out with the check. No matter, we put down our cards and waited. We were incorrectly charged. Probably because they were rushing (however the place was not packed). The bill was corrected but no one acknowledged the problem. I called for a manager. We gave them great feedback for their server who was not at fault, but then expressed our disappointment with how the check was given and the inaccuracy. He said we won't do it again but we will get our money. This is not how you build customer loyalty.

I'll preface that the food was definitely 4 stars, but Barbounia gets dinged a star for poor service.The overall atmosphere of the restaurant is perfect for brunch - high ceilings, airy/open, cool decor, lots of tables and a long bar. They have an unlimited brunch drink option for $20, which is a great deal in NYC! There's a variety of mediterranean brunch items (mezze dips, pita sandwiches with chicken or falafel, shakshuka, turkish eggs, etc.) I went with one of the specials - ""greek"" eggs benedict with avocado greek yogurt sauce instead of the traditional hollandaise with crab and roasted eggplant underneath the poached eggs. The flavors of this dish went so well together. It was served with a side salad and some roasted potatoes. Everyone I was with also enjoyed their dishes (chicken pita sandwich, burger, salad with falafel, steak and eggs).Unfortunately, the service was very poor. We felt like our waiter was rushing us from the moment we sat down. He looked at our table from afar multiple times and was seemingly annoyed that we weren't ready to order quickly. He also didn't promptly fill the unlimited champagne cocktails, only upon request. When we asked him to take some pictures, he quickly took one of the group and left as soon as possible.

5.0,8/5/2018,"This place is such a gem! I went here with a bunch of friends for the first (of many) boogie brunch spots for our weekly breakfast club. It was FANTASTIC. Food: 5/5. Honestly, I've never had much Mediterranean food, much less breakfast, but I was really impressed with the diversity of dishes seen here. Pictured (and recommended) are the shokshukas (a red tomato sauce stew with eggs served in a hot cast iron pot) and the Khachapuri (a warm flame baked flatbread with Fresh mozzarella, ricotta, truffle paste, sage & slow poached egg). This was definitely my favorite dish, and of all of the khachapuris, probably the tastiest one said the waiter. Service / Atmosphere: 5/5. Make a reservation for larger parties, and maybe even smaller ones as the place packed up around 11am. Very attentive service, and they were helpful in deciding which menu items would be best to try. The atmosphere of this place is really relaxing / uplifting. Think Grecian style oasis. Think eating tasty brunch dishes while somehow being transplanted to some off-the-coast Mediterranean town cafe where, somehow, everyone still speaks English. All great things, with a wonderful decor, too! Price-to-experience: (5 is best) 5/5. This place had a DEAL going on with $19 unlimited champagne cocktails. What made this such a deal was that after you eat, you can then move to the bar and continue to enjoy your cocktails.  Definitely a pricey-er option, but splurge a bit, you probably deserve it!

This time, we brought friends in from out of town, and were mortified at the poor level of service and lack of cleanliness, which is not the fault of the server staff, but a result of horrendous management. The servers are stretched extremely thin serving too many tables at once, leaving the restaurant understaffed and resulting in extremely poor service. We ordered bottomless mimosas and at multiple times throughout the brunch, every single glass on the table was empty for more than 10 minutes. At one point, we asked our server, and two other servers to fill up our glasses. The manager knew that our table was upset due to slowness of service and actually watched us from a semi concealed corner of the restaurant, at which point I made eye contact and motioned to him, and he shook his head without pitching in to help his team or coming over to speak to us at any point.

4.0,7/9/2018,"Came here for a 1:00 brunch reservation on a Sunday. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and it's a lovely spot for brunch.  High ceilings was pretty archways. It really reminded me of the Mediterranean. There were a few birthdays there that day and when that happens they turn the music up really loud and play a birthday song over the speakers. I was confused why the music was so loud at first until I understood. Warning this may happen for you! I had a hard time deciding what to order but ended up getting the falafel pita because the girls sitting next to me had ordered it and it looked good. And so did the fries. It was pretty good. The fries need to be rated immediately. After sitting for a while they weren't that good.I got a frośe - which was both beautiful and tasted great!!! It was sweet and I loved that! The service was great. People kept coming to check on us and see what we wanted and it was a variety of staff helping out, not just one waiter.Good spot for brunch.

Asked for cucumber only and got an assortment of vegetables we didn't want.  Even the manager came over and argued with us and said there was a ""Corporate policy"" against the cucumber only request.  Are you kidding me?  I've been to this restaurant at least 25 times over 10 years.  They still charged us for the vegetables after saying they would take off.  Even the busboy made fun of the waiter for the ridiculous actions and he ultimately brought us the cucumber we wanted.  Management, what the hell is wrong with you?  Really?!  Cucumber?!  Arrogance=insolvency",0,0,0,Michael B.,"New York, NY",0,12,1

1.0,5/27/2018,"There was this time i went here... and I specifically asked for champagne from the waiter. I was ignored or brought bellinis when there was leftovers from the table next to us.I used to thoroughly enjoy coming here for the unlimited drink special- but When the waitstaff is more interested In chasing tail than paying attention to patrons equally, it becomes disingenuous. I had to take my drinks to the bar on 3 occasions to refill. And of course I'm then pressed to tip on shitty service and feel bad not giving an appropriate percentage because of how the tip system is used to finance  gaps in minimum wage and pay rendered by the company. It's sad, honestly.For food, get the spicy feta. Don't be shy to get your own refills or you won't get your money's worth. This place needs to get their act together.... particularly one gentleman who acted as our waiter. I wish we could have shifted the entirety of the tip to the bartender.

For apps we ordered the crispy artichoke and fire roasted cauliflower. Both were a decent size portion to split between 4 people. If you have more people then that, I also recommend the hummus. All the flavors had me going back for a second bite. As for dinner, I split the lamb kabobs with my friend. The dish itself comes inside of a popover. They cut the bread open and unveil the lamb inside. The lamb was perfectly cooked and super juicy. The sauce was almost a tomato-ish dip. I dipped the popover bread in the sauce after and it was so tasty. I would most defiantly go back as I hear the brunch is amazing.

5.0,5/14/2018,"My first time here while visiting NYC a couple of weekends ago and I am in love with this place. From the ambiance (think flowy translucent curtains, tall ceilings, beautiful bar, vast seating area) to the crowd that gathers here to the cheap bottomless brunch that they encourage you to finish at the bar until 4 pm. There is nothing that exists even remotely close to this in SF / Bay Area. The mimosas are truly bottomless and flowing. The tables are close together and the place is loud, you likely need to scream to get your message across to other members of your party but you didn't really come here to have a serious conversation did you? We went with a few shared plates and it was more than enough food. We started with a selection of green tahini, eggplant and taramousalata (all very good)! We also got the saganaki (cheese on fire) which you can never go wrong with. We ended with khachapuri which is basically like a flatbread and it was so much food we could barely finish it all.

4.0,5/11/2018,"I am not sure if you are aware, but I am a huge fan of brunch. If you give me decent food and a fountain of mimosa, I am a happy lady. Barbounia is not a place I often go (it is quite expensive once you start getting into the food) but every time I do go, I really enjoy myself.  The food is always really good and the drinks are free flowing. It is often packed, which can make it difficult to get a table. We have had reservations in the past but keep in mind you have to have your full party with you to be seated. Once you sit down you can really appreciate how huge this room is. The massive paintings and mirrored walls are pretty astounding. However it can also get SUPER LOUD, especially when that bachelorette party behind you gets to their 5th or 6th round of bubbly. The champagne drinks are unlimited for $20 and you even have the option of going to the bar to continue drinking after you are finished eating. That being said, do not expect a quiet, intimate brunch. Tables can be very tight together. The servers are normally pulled in a bunch of directions so service can be a little slow for pouring but I usually don't have too much issue with that. Now for the food. I have yet to be disappointed with my meals here. I normally get a baked egg dish. The lamb and spinach baked eggs are really good. I wish they were served with bread though. It would make the scoop more enjoyable.  My boyfriend normally goes for a burger. They are usually very juicy when ordered medium. The previous time we came, we also got hummus to start. This was a slight oversight. We were almost stuffed by the time the main meals came out. Still ate, do not get me wrong, but it was overkill. Next time I might just think about sharing 3 appetizers with one meal if possible.",2,1,2,Erin P.,"Brooklyn, NY",340,314,1082

I really enjoyed the flatbread with the spreads. I don't remember the 3 that we got. For our entrees, I ordered the steak and eggs and my girlfriend had the lamb kebab pita. The steak was thin and there were two pieces, both extremely well done when I asked for medium rare. My girlfriend didn't like her lamb kebab either. Service was fine, they were busy but we still got refills pretty frequently. After you're done at the table, you can continue drinking at the bar, which is what we did.

3.0,4/27/2018,"So this review is solely based on the weekend brunch. I've had brunch here a few times and it feels as though the quality of food and service has been consistently declining.They offer a boozy brunch option which is ~2 hours of unlimited champagne/mimosas/bellinis for $20 which is a pretty great deal. However, because the restaurant is SO packed on weekends you often times have a hard time getting refills for your drinks which is frustrating considering it's supposed to be 'unlimited'.The food here is generally good, at one brunch I've had a couple dishes arrived cold which was disappointing. The one thing that has consistently been excellent are their pizzas, hummus, and bread.Also worth noting, they have a hard stop at 4PM and they begin to run out of dishes in the early afternoon. Highly suggest booking brunch here for 1pm at the LATEST so that your time won't hit the stop and so all the dishes will be available.",0,0,0,Ian M.,"Manhattan, NY",287,38,1

Moroccan, Tunisian, Lebanese, or what.In the end, it was very much American takes on the region's cuisine which wasn't bad at all. Not authenticate, but if you know that going in it will suffice. We started with the Octopus and Calamari. The Octopus was perfectly cooked and very tasty. The Calamari was flash fried, which we do not like, but was okay for what it was. For mains, my Wife had the scallops, and I had the duck. Duck is a problematic dish usually in the States, but this place nailed it. Order the duck. Calling it duck shawarma is a bit of a misnomer, but ignore the name and order it anyways. The scallops were okay, but my Wife had colossal entrée envy.

3.0,4/8/2018,"Super scene-y, especially for this part of town. But it's weird scene-y, because Barbounia isn't necessarily an of-the-moment location, but its clientele certainly thinks they are at the coolest restaurant in town. *shrugs*Service is a bit lackluster, especially if you're not ordering mountains of food and cocktails, and they mysteriously have a minimum of 3 hostesses working at all times. Food is okay. Some dishes are better than others. I'm a fan of the falafel sandwich and fries (only served at lunch/brunch) as well as the shakshuka. The table side bread (if the waiter remembers to bring it to you) is excellent. Other egg dishes are meh and the flatbread is okay but not amazing. I find the pricing to be super strange here - salads without meat are $18+ and you have to spend another $10 to add protein to the salad, which is just wild to me. In general brunch and lunch pricing (never been here at night, thankfully) is a bit high considering the portion size and quality, but I guess it's not uncommon for the neighborhood.",0,0,0,Cat S.,"Manhattan, NY",447,371,0

The Kabab was divine and came covered in a pastry that was delicious as well. Scallops were also excellent and made to a special request. Suggestion to the chef: Don't serve the meze with the bread. Although delicious it's very filling and may call for a smaller main dish or skipping desert or both. Consider a good laffa (you owner and chef will know what that is) instead.

Loads of birthday brunches were happening and I can totally see why - very cute, $20 never ending champagne cocktails, you can go light or filling on the food, and it's a great share plate kind of spot....oh and it's totally 'gram-worthy! We started with some cocktails and a few mezze - the spicy feta obvi, the hummus, and the fire-roasted eggplant, one was better than the next, and the bread it comes with is basically crack...must try this! For lunch I got the classic greek salad with the lamb kebab, so good with the za'tar and the meatballs were tender tender tender! Other fan faves around the table were the falafel pita and the burger. Overall the food was fresh, filling, and left us with no regrets! Exactly the way brunch should be.

So good) and the calamari (so good too. The sauces were so flavorful). Would get both again. The other side of the table got the deluxe pikilia which came with 6 different dips and kept refilling the deliciously warm flatbread!! I think we got 3-4 platters of the flatbread- yummmmmm!!For entrees, I got the short ribs (SO GOOD!! 3 large chunks of soft, tender meat), sis got the duck (really good and tender too!),friend got beef tartare and grilled octopus apps instead of entrees, cod, branzini- and everyone liked their dishes. For dessert, we got the kanafeh which was a grilled cheese dish which was interestingly salty and sweet at the same time. The beignets were warm and soft, and Silan was sooo good (shaved sugar ice cream like dish.. honestly so hard to explain but it was super unique and good!! Definitely try it!!)The service was amazing, everyone was so nice, offered to take pictures for us and even put candle on the birthday boys dessert.

After ordering the mezze which is bread and dip, our main course which was salad and shrimp for God's sake  too over an hour to arrive and they gave us three rounds of bread to keep us distracted. The people next to us also had their main meal arrive before their mezze and sent it back. They even asked if if we wanted more wine when our water glasses were empty. Water glasses should never be empty, I don't care how backed up the kitchen is. The fact that they seemed to just want us to buy more wine instead of filling our drink water glasses is just wrong. We also had to ask for our check twice and they didn't even clear our plates after dinner when we asked for the check the first time.

My friends were furious and wanted to go to a different restaurant.  It took me a lot of effort to keep them waiting and have our brunch at Barbounia only because I was dying to try their green and Turkish shakshuka.  Our moment finally came and they sat us. We ordered 2 Turkish shakshuka and 1 green shakshuka, a side order of bacon and coffees and latte. They gave us their famous home made bread with our meals. Everything was so beyond delicious and the portions were good. Turkish shakshuka had chickpea, tahini, ground lamb and spinach baked in a tomato sauce. And green shakshuka was with spinach, mozarella and bunch of other cheeses. I personally liked green shakshuka better and kind of regretted not ordering it. Service was excellent.

3.0,1/31/2018,"This spot truly transports you to the Mediterranean. The ambiance is lively, decor is cozy with a view to their immaculate kitchen, and the dishes highlight the rich cuisine of the region (Greek, Turkish, Lebanese & Moroccan as far as I can tell). Any place that serves za'atar infused anything on their menu are top notch in my book. For my first visit, sampled restaurant week menu (which btw had very generous portions) with friends. For appetizers we sampled shredded salad (absolutely fresh and crunchy, with peanut sauce to boot), grilled prawn head, and mushroom soup. For entrees, we had lamb shawarma (soft and delectable), taboon dorade (fresh catch?), and some chicken kebabs. Their silan dessert (apparently a classic) did not disappoint, but truly the highlight for me was the ever intriguing fennel ice cream. Bonus, they served the warmest olive oil drenched turkish bread (which I would have been happy to consume all on my own). It's a sexy date spot, with solid cocktails & wine list. Next time I visit, I plan to order the lamb kebab terracotta (a neighboring patron ordered this and the smell wafted my way).

1.0,1/26/2018,"Came here with my friend for dinner during restaurant week, and was really disappointed. The food was good--very good even--and the interior was beautiful. But it was unfortunately the way that my friend and I were treated by the restaurant staff that really made the experience a negative one despite our best efforts to enjoy it. I rarely ever review restaurants, but really felt I had to share this experience because it affected me in a rather personal way. Let me start in chronological order of our experiences that night. First, although we had a reservation at 7:15, we were told our table was not ready yet and would be in 10 minutes. The restaurant was busy, so we waited patiently. However, we ended up waiting for over 40 minutes, and when my friend checked in politely with the waitress, she coldly told us each time to be patient and that it would be 10 more minutes, without a hint of apology. Others who came after us were, strangely, seated before we were. When we were finally led to our seats, the table was not yet ready, and we stood by our table awkwardly while a waiter prepared our table. Throughout this, we tried to be understanding and sympathetic to the busy waiters, and thanked them for getting our table ready.Next, after we were seated, they took ages to take our order. When they finally did, they did so very coldly and tersely, which we were surprised at since the waiters seemed to be very friendly to the tables around us. When my friend was about to order, the man seated next to him raised his hand, and the waiter cut my friend off to serve the guy next to him before getting back to taking his order. After one waiter had taken our order and we thought we were waiting for our food, another waiter came up to us to take our order as if we had never ordered. My friend explained that we had ordered already, but, ignoring us, he asked us what we wanted. We repeated our orders, and the waiter took it done as if we had ordered for the first time, again without a hint of apology. We finally got our food, and after we had finished our appetizer, we noticed that the other tables around us had been served complimentary bread, but that we had not. When we asked the waiter about this, he merely asked us coldly whether we wanted bread and rolled his eyes at us, not a hint apologetic. Finally, while clearing our entree, the waiter dropped a knife on my friend's foot. Instead of apologizing, the waiter merely told my friend ""not to worry"" as he bent down to pick up the dropped knife. Oh, and they also forgot our dessert order twice so we had to order it three times. While I understand that restaurants can be very busy and understaffed, what really disappointed us was that no one else around us seemed to be treated the way we were, and the difference was increasingly obvious. Though I hate to say this or think of it, my friend and I were the only racial minorities in the entire restaurant that night, and we could not help but think that that had something to do with the discrepancy in service, especially since we had tried to be extremely polite through the whole thing. The waiters were very attentive to those around us, they all got their food promptly, and we noticed that they were very chatty and friendly to the other guests. This is really the first time in my seven years living in New York that something like this has happened at a restaurant of this caliber, and am disappointed at the behavior that is really unrepresentative of the welcoming, inclusive place that I have known this city to be. Seriously disappointed, especially for a restaurant that makes a living off of serving ethnic food.",0,1,0,Chihiro I.,"New York, NY",307,7,0

When we ran out of hummus and garlic bread, we were brought more free of charge. The falafel was delicious and probably the most flavorful falafel I've ever tasted.The entree was the only disappointing part. I had a burger which was fine, but not a standout.

Drinks and food ordering was ok time wise but by 12:45 I was starting to wonder where my sandwich was. For a lunch seating, food should not take more than 20 minutes. Hummus texture was fine but didn't  have much of a taste. Bread was great!  Mushroom risotto was great but my dish, the falafel sandwich and salad that came  with it were pretty terrible with no seasoning.

2.0,1/15/2018,"After hearing much hype about this restaurant, my friends and I were excited to dine here for brunch over the long MLK weekend. We were sorely disappointed. The ambiance was fun. The decor was light, awash with gold accents, and decadent. This felt like the type of place that must have been popular during Sex and the City era NYC, where girlfriends went to chat over mimosas and the menu was a secondary consideration. To that end, I would recommend this restaurant as a place to catch up with friends if you're more concerned about conversation than food. Shakshuka is one of my favorite brunch dishes, so I wasn't happy when the chicken foie Gras sausage shakshuka I ordered missed the mark - my friend, who ordered the same dish, felt similarly.

At one point a server wanted to take my plate away and o had half my entree still to go. I don't think this is any of the wait staffs fault, I do think the root cause of this is the management.

Those guys had a whole extra table that could have gone to someone else yet we were being inconvenienced.We told our server once and she talked to the wait staff but even after that they came back and asked to clear our table.

Once we were seated at the table everything was perfect: the food was delicious, the waiter was very attentive, water was constantly refilled, etc. However, getting to that table was a terrible process. I had a special occasion dinner and made the reservation accordingly. Once I got to the restaurant it took them 40 minutes past the reserved time to seat us given they had no availability. If I reserve a table, I expect it to be available at a time close to the reserved time. More so, if they know they are taking long, at least get us started on drinks. So when we went to the bar section it was 1) impossible to get the wine menu and when we finally did it 2) we couldn't even place the order. I ended up being late to my own party at a bar because of this and the hosts weren't apologetic, they were rude.

As I was running late the night of my reservation I called to let them know but they couldn't find my reservation and argued with me about having reservation. Upon arrival they refused to seat us since only 4 of the 6 of us were there. When finally seated it was so noisy we couldn't have a conversation. The waiter came to take our order and wouldn't allow us to start with just appetizers. He left and didn't come back for more than 10 minutes. And when the food arrived no one was happy with the meal.

3.0,11/8/2017,"It's a decent place in the city to get brunch. The drinks are beautiful, but if you're not drinking, you'll be more focused on the food which is average.I ordered the Falafel Pita and found it fine, but not good enough to come back for the price.Our dishes and glasses were also being taken away at lightning speed even if we were still enjoying them. For example, we ordered a bread basket, and the wait staff tried to take it away once our main dishes came even though it was mostly full.  My friend was still enjoying her cocktail when it was whisked away, only for her to call the waiter back. We felt a bit stressed and rushed to leave, even though there were about 10 empty tables in the restaurant. It was a strange experience.Overall, a beautiful space to have lunch in, with average food, fun cocktails, and wait staff over eager to take away your dishes (whether or not you are done).",1,0,0,Agata R.,"Brookline Village, Boston, MA",1,1,1

The waiter seemed reluctant to serve us -- we noticed she looked at our table and went up to the table next to us that was seated 10 minutes after us. She finally came to our table and without any greetings (no hi, hello, how are you), asked, ""Are you ready?"" without a smile. We thought that was odd and attempted to make a conversation, asking how she's doing. She answered ""I'm fine. Are you ready?"" with a tone of a robot. That was it for us -- we got up and left. She did not ask why we left nor attempted to stop us by reversing her attitude. On our way out, we passed by the manager (we assumed he is a manager, wearing a blue blazer) and told him why we left. We walked to Fonda on 9th Avenue and had a fantastic bottomless brunch there.p.s.

It also looked (as you can tell in the photo) as if it was squeezed out a bottle which is not appealing to me for a 24$ sandwich.  I also wish the sandwich was cut in half so you could divide the veggies, meat and sauce instead of having chunks of meat only in the middle while veggies on top and in the bottom.

3.0,8/24/2017,One of my favorite brunch spots. Reason #1: you are allowed to drink until 4pm after your brunch is finished. For example if you sit at noon and finish at 1 you are politely sent to the bar where you can drink until 4pm. Reason #2: staff is amazing and attentive. Recommend Bryant as a server because he literally filled our drink every 5 minutes. He was so sweet and very knowledgeable about the menu. However I do not recommend the lamb pita. Lamb was undercooked and not seasoned which tasted bland and boring. I've visited this location multiple times and do recommend the burger or pizza to fill you up.

Gets you in the mood to eat. We tried all of dips, and loved each one. The flash fried cauliflower and artichoke dishes were stellar!The falafel are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I guess I had never had them cooked correctly before, because these really stood out to me, plus the sauce underneath was great and smooth. Mains - the lamb dish tasted unlike anything I'd had beforeThe duck was insane! Meat was so tender and flavorful plus the rice/mushroom concoction underneath was so tasty.

3.0,8/15/2017,"Nice atmosphere, but mediocre service and average food. Came here for Sunday brunch with a reservation for 4 people. The place was PACKED. We were seated instantly and our food came out very fast, so that's a plus!! I got the spinach omelette, and my friends ordered the French toast and spinach shakshouka. The omelette was honestly so normal. I thought it lacked flavor so I asked for hot sauce. They don't have Tabasco at the restaurant but they have a pretty good hot sauce alternative. The French toast was SOO tiny. I didn't give it a try, but it did not look worth the price. Literally a slice of bread! The spinach shakshouka was REALLY good. The flavor was delicious and I'd definitely order this dish myself if I ever went back. Stole some of my friends dish to flavor my omelette. Now, the BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS: They aren't on the menu, but the waiter should tell you about it. The mimosas are strong, but there's only one flavor and they are VERY slow at refilling. Left feeling pretty tipsy but the service was just soooo slow that the bottomless just didn't seem so great. It's pretty disorganized in terms of who comes to pour you more mimosas as well. Sometimes it's your waiter and sometimes it's someone else. Sometimes you wait for 30 minutes and sometimes they refill you before you even take a sip. Wasn't a fan of the inconsistency. Overall I enjoyed the atmosphere of the place. It was really loud, though and the service wasn't amazing.

2.0,6/20/2017,"Came here about two weeks ago and I am a regular here..I know their menu very well and I noticed there has been a change in the food. The bread that comes out with the dipping sauce was very flat, flatter than usual. And they did not provide extra bread as they normally would when they see you have finished it. A small bread with an order of a filling plate of dip calls for more bread. Then I made the order of my favorite potato gnocchi with creamy mushrooms, when it arrived it looked like a complete different dish. When asked what it was, I was told they ""enhanced"" the dish to give it more color. I don't care for color, I care for the taste and it was not good. I came for the potato gnocchi, I always come for the a. The dip and b. The potato gnocchi. It was a disappointment in both factors. Bring back the creamy mushroom gnocchi!!!!

I knocked off a star because there was one server/bus guy that looked annoyed when we asked for water and almost took away my meal while I was mid-bite.

1.0,3/26/2017,"I had this restaurant recommended to me by several different people so I really hope what I experienced yesterday was something out of the ordinary. First, we had a 3pm reservation- the bottomless deal ends at 4pm. Once we arrived at 3 they told us it would be a few minutes until our table was ready, but if we wanted to take advantage of the bottomless deal we could start drinking at the bar. We all decided we would go drink for drink instead since we only had an hour, and that we would simply just wait for our table. That might have been a mistake-- at 3:35, they were able to seat us. Once we were seated (35 minutes after our reservation time) the wait staff completely rushed us and told us that they absolutely needed to put our order in right away because the kitchen closes at 4. We obliged and ordered after we were basically yelled at to order something. We got our appetizer (set of 3 dips and bread) and then literally 4 minutes later had our meals brought to the table before we could really enjoy our apps. To add to it, we had ordered a bottle of prosecco which didn't make its way to the table until we were already halfway done with our meal. When we were almost done with everything we asked the wait staff for more bread to go with our dips and they told us ""sorry the kitchen is closed"". You would think that since THEY screwed up our reservation that they would be a little more lenient with this 4pm cutoff rather than making us feel like we were in the ones in the wrong for wanting the food we were paying for. I will never eat here again after being treated with such disrespect. Figure out this 4pm cutoff or don't take any reservations after 2pm.",0,0,0,Katherine J.,"Garden City, NY",0,2,0

We made a reservation a week in advance, waited for 40 minutes after our reservation time to be sat, and then were told we only had 30 mins left of the unlimited champagne. We explained that we had just sat down and had been waiting for over 40 mins, and THEN they mentioned we could have been drinking that whole time at the bar (but hostess had never told us that). Our waiter asked the manager for an exception but he said it was a hard no /4pm cutoff. At 4:15 that same manager was sitting at a table by himself drinking the champagne......... before we left he was sitting at the same table now having wine.

We were seated by a hostess, who accommodated the seating arrangement for us (the chair was on the side of the table, so instead of sitting across from each other, it was awkwardly placed until we changed it). About 10 minutes after, some rude man (later found out his name was Brian) comes up to us out of nowhere asking us to move to the table next to us. After politely telling him that we were perfectly fine where we were, he then told us that if we wanted to sit there then we had to move the  chair back to where it was before. Then before even giving us a chance to move our stuff, he proceeded to move our stuff for us!!! It was very unprofessional and uncalled for. To make a bad experience even worse, the food was actually very bad. I was very disappointed, especially since I had a few good brunches there and was excited to share it with my friend.

I've been wanting to come here, especially after my roommates rave about the experience they had here on their birthdays...Seriously they still talk about it. They did brunch tho. I want to begin by saying the restaurant week selection (winter 2017 Feb) was really lackluster compared to the other options on the menu. I thought the point was to showcase the best? The items we tried were good, but not great. Not to mention - it's 1,000,000,000% impossible to find a decent wine under $50. At that, I don't want to spend $50 on a bottle that probably costs the restaurant $10-15 a bottle. - Ceviche: shrimp, cirtusy and the winner of the apps - Salad: meh - Shawarma: mostly fat than meat, consistency was really off-putting- Chicken: actually v tasty. wintry spices with a sweet sauce atop cauliflower mash - yum!!! I would get this all the time although I usually opt away from chicken dishes You might be sitting there thinking ""why the heck would you go out to a nice restaurant if you aren't prepared to pay a pretty penny?"" I have 2 answers 1) TREAT YOSELF and 2) because I expect THE MOST from a place like this so please try to live up to expectation - from my other reviews anyone can see my threshold is LOW and I generally love everything I consume.

Came here for Restaurant week.  Our party had 3 of the 4 entrees offered. Chicken on beets with cauliflower mash was juicy, flavorful if a bit uninspired.  Dorado (fish) was a nice size, cooked well but nothing special. The lamb (shoulder) shawarma was a disaster. Overlooked, way too much fat (meaning not so much actual meat)-can lose that from the menu. No idea if meat was flavorful: it was overpowered by the tahini. Appetizer salmon ceviche was excellent. Also had 'spiced feta' with bread (not on RW menu)--Soo much GARLIC (bread was hot from the oven and yummy). The dessert Silan was wonderful- nuts and whipped and ice cream. Wow.

3.0,1/23/2017,"I have been going to Barbounia for many years for birthdays, celebrations and just a fun Saturday brunch. On 1/15/17, i go with four friends for my boyfriends birthday. We are excited and expect the usual good service and good food. First, we are seated near the kitchen, easily the worst seat in the place. We let that go. Then, our waitress barely fills our drinks before asking us to place an order. We are ready to place some appetizers but are told we have to order all at once. A bit confused, we ask for a manager as there seemed to be a language barrier between us and our waitress. The manager says we have to put it all in at once because ""the kitchen is so busy"" but they will be sure we are not rushed. Our main concern was not getting rushed off of the table so we could enjoy a birthday brunch. We then order the hummus appetizer. The waitress repeatedly says this is not enough and asks if we want more. Knowing the portion size and our group (only 5 of us) we say no, REPEATEDLY. Two hummus dishes are brought over. Odd. Then, a few bites into our appetizers the food comes. At this point we had been sitting down for only 30 minutes. It could not be more obvious that they wanted us to get moving so they could re-sit our table. Before we even put down our forks the check is brought. I tell the waitress (again) about my boyfriends birthday. I am not asked what kind of dessert and a random item is brought over for a three second song. Then a new check with TWO HUMMUS appetizers and $12 for the unknown dessert on it. As we are trying to enjoy our desert the waitress comes back repeatedly to check whether we filled the bill or not, hovering around our table. The manager removed the double app on the bill but all in all this was very disappointing. the only reason i am even giving 3 stars is because normally i have a good experience here.",1,0,0,Dana P.,"Manhattan, NY",158,14,0

I came with one my friends as a suggestion to dine here, at Barbounia.. I left with a not-so pleasant vibe -- granted I was sober, but hey, you can't be drunk for ALL your brunches right? Maybe?Atmosphere is cool, loud - sometimes ear-piercing, the whole Mediterranean theme is pretty - I'm sure during dinner, it's very intimate and classy. Food however, was meh - maybe if you're drunk enough, you won't realize the food is just your average bunch food that's priced through the roof.Our waitress on the other hand... damn, that girl either woke up on the wrong side of the bed or she's just a b*tch. Too much attitude for my liking. I don't care if you have to deal with tables of drunk girls yelling ""MORE MAMOSAS!! CAN YOU FILL IT TO THE TOP?!"" You don't treat your sober tables like you don't give a shit.My friend asked for a Cafe Ole, she gave her a black coffee with milk on the side.My friend told her this wasn't what she order, and that she'd like a Cafe Ole - the waitress had the audacity to say ""well this is how they do it in France""... OK, no need for the attitude, lady!There are a total of four more NO-NOs our waitress did during our dine-in, but in short, she was rude, rushed us out, and in the end, received an undesirable tip.

5.0,1/2/2017,Above and beyond! This place was not only beautiful but went the distance went it came to my 2 year old and 4 year old girls. It broke my heart to not be able to enjoy the bottomless mimosas at brunch because my little monkeys were getting restless. I kept bringing my girls to the open kitchen to keep them entertained when the owner (david) went up to me and asked if my girls wanted to make their own pizzas which they loved. He made their day. And he made my day since i was able to enjoy my cocktail while my kids were over the moon about making their own pizza pie. And he didn't stop there. He then brought my kids in the kitchen so they could see their pies baking. And if that wasn't enough he asked if the girls wanted to make their own dessert. Everyone has the best time and the food was delicious.  The extra love he put towards my girls made the experience. What a wonderful place. Highly recommend.,0,0,0,Stacy E.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",22,7,0

Service was a bit haphazard for our very large party. Service was also very slow. I ordered the lamb kebab pita...it was nicely presented with a side salad, but the lamb was tough instead of tender. It sat very heavy in my stomach for the rest of the day. I wouldn't recommend it. My table mates seemed underwhelmed with their orders of the Turkish eggs. I would say the food is average here.

The place was crowded as usual for Sunday brunch. We were seated by Server 203 Bryant T @ Table 5/1.   Things started off well, we all order the unlimited mismosa. We were getting refilled regularly and then it all went downhill from there.  We ordered, food came, table cleared and then the check. We never asked for the check, we were never asked if we wanted dessert and 2 of the 4 glasses at this point were being refilled. TERRIBLE. I just signed by credit card bill and he tried to swipe it from me. Give me a damn break. I'm not atourist and the fact that you have to turn a table within an hour is unacceptable. The table to my left and right were there much longer. Why weren't they being rushed? Was it because they were a group of three young ladies to the right and a pair of more mature ladies to my left and we we were a table of four gay men. The guy in the suit jacket comes over clears the rest of the table and pushes the table away from me. I told him he was terrible and I walked out of this place.

1.0,11/21/2016,"Let me star off by saying the food and our waiter was amazing. Prompt service, and smiles all around. Barbara was nothing short of spectacular and so attentive to our group it really made my friends birthday brunch an experience. The reason I am giving this restaurant such a low start rating is due to the manager that day and his lack of compassion. I did not catch his name, but I was there this past Sunday 11/20 for brunch around 2 pm. We had a situation at our table where a runner dropped a whole bowl of hummus down my friends shirt and back. Naturally we were upset but were understanding because of how busy it was. Barbara as well as the runner were so apologetic and were willing to do anything to remedy the problem. Of course someone's immediate reaction would be anger, but as we continued to enjoy our food the feeling subsided. Our waiter assured us that this would be handled appropriately.Fast forward to when we get the bill I see we were still getting charged for the spilled hummus. I asked to speak to the manager and when I tell you he had the most vile attitude I have ever encountered in customer service it was unreal. His first response when I mentioned the hot plate because it had just been washed his response was ""hummus is a cold appetizer""; which is a true statement, but its meant to be eaten and not spilled down someones back. Very defensive as if we were asking for half off our entire bill. When I explained that he goes on to say that it was a mistake (which is was), but he didn't care to even ask if the person was okay. All he could offer was to dry clean my friends shirt. NO compassion at all. The shirt had nothing to do with it; it's about caring about your consumer and showing concern or empathy. I'm not sure whether it was because we were young and didn't take us serious or something else but it left a horrible taste in my mouth.Our waiter was sweet enough to get a round of shots made for us because she felt so bad. I assured her it had NOTHING to do with her, but it was her management. It ruined the rest of our plans for the day because we had to go home and change. I'm still at a loss for words. It sucks because I really enjoyed the food and ambiance.",4,2,0,Raven M.,"New York, NY",387,15,0
2.0,11/16/2016,"Firstly, I want to acknowledge that we were front row to watching a waiter pick his nose. If that doesn't give you an idea of how I'll review this restaurant, I don't know what will. My brother picked out this restaurant to celebrate my mother's birthday and I am certain he didn't look at the menu beforehand. Growing up Kosher, we don't eat shellfish and I imagine he assumed that a restaurant like this would cater to those needs. We had a reservation but when I stepped in, I was overwhelmed with how busy it was but also how loud it was. The music was a great touch but not at the volume where I couldn't hear someone standing next to me. We were led to our seats and our waiter seemed a bit pushy in hopes that we'd order more than water. The tap water itself tasted off to me so my mother and I ordered Diet Coke while my brother and sister-in-law ordered beers.The menu was definitely meant for those who love meat or shellfish. My brother and sister-in-law are both Kosher, my mother is a picky eater too and I... well, I wasn't exactly enthused either. We decided to order a bunch of appetizers and side dishes - all vegetarian. My mother finally settled on a salad which seemed to be alright. It was just very difficult to figure out what to eat and that disappointed me greatly. Maybe this is a paradise for those who eagerly eat all things but I felt strained by the menu.Another note is that getting to the bathroom was quite challenging. You are either forced to go by the bar or to go through tables. The problem is that you have to squeeze by people or ask them to move in. There is just no better way to get to the bathroom and I find that to be a bit of an issue. When you do get to the bathroom itself, it is open to all, with various stalls. I was surprised by the openness and that it wasn't separate bathrooms for genders but it was a rather nice surprise. The bathroom was clean and the amount of stalls meant that there wasn't much of a wait.While the food we did order was good, I don't think I'll be rushing to come back.",0,0,0,Amy S.,"Manhattan, NY",144,141,2

Ask for cucumbers on the side once you notice you've been through three loaves and your pants are tight. Burger is good, chicken sandwich is good, baked eggs are better, bottomless champagne is best. I like the pizzas and I love sitting up at the bar instead of dealing with waiting for a table (I rarely venture to this place without a reservation). I almost always drop about 50$ for bottomless drinks, spreads, and an entree. It's a good value.A little annoying that they refuse to let you order appetizers separate from your meal, mostly to get you out so your drunk friends don't take over the table for the entire brunch. But you can take your glass to the bar and continue to be loud and drunk with the other degenerates. Excellent way to spend a weekend afternoon, but not for families or people that pretend to be classy. But enough of the birthday song. We get it, every group of girls 22-28 books her birthday brunch here. Maybe we need to collect a list every 2 hours and you can all celebrate together. Cuz we're over it by about song #6.

1.0,9/25/2016,"This place was insanely disappointing, don't waste your money.I went there for brunch with a friend and had my sights set on the Shakshuka Merguez. They didn't have lamb sausage. So I asked f they had anything else with lamb or a substitute for the lamb sausage (because this is a Mediterranean restaurant and I did not want the chicken foie gras). The server hesitated and then finally offered the lamb kabab. Ok. On a pita. Ok.The food comes and when I go to eat the pita, the meat is not cut up inside it. I expected it to be full pieces of lamb too, but it came more like gyro meat all ground up and pieced together (or as my Middle Easter friends call it, ""original meat""). So I wait for the server to come over to get me a plate so I can actually cut up the meat to make it edible size, I wait. And wait. My pita is cold by now. I finally get the server to give me a new plate and I cut up the meat. The food is absolutely tasteless (even with the mediocre tzatziki sauce) so I wait and wait for the server to come back so I can ask for something else to put on it to make it edible. It's cold at this point and beyond disappointing. I finally get some mango sauce with the check. One of the busboys (?) kept trying to take my plate away from me while I still eating. I felt like they were trying to rush us out even though I had waiting multiple times for the server to come and at least check in on us. (It's worth noting that they had a manager kick a couple girls out of the table next to us because they were taking too long enjoying their champagne after their meal)And then when we split the bill, my card was charged the whole bill while my friends was charged a dime. So we had to wait again to get the server to charge our cards the correct amount. I don't understand what the heck is wrong here with this place. $17 pita, poor service, unspiced food, and literally getting kicked out of your table.

Service was incredibly slow--how long does it take to pour a glass of wine? They do offer complimentary bread but it doesn't come out warm even though its served in a way you'd think it would be.

The food came out in a reasonable time and the waiter I had, was pretty good about refilling my drink constantly. The food was delicious and the portion was also very generous.

You would think the waiter or manager would at least apologize for the AC issues ( if there was actually AC issues or maybe it's just always this incredibly hot and stuffy in there, where I don't understand why anyone would return to this restaurant). The reason why I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 star is because their cocktails are good and they have a big selection. I don't think I would return here again unless they fix their AC situation. It ruined our entire dinner experience .",3,1,1,Priscilla C.,"Fairfield, NJ",228,45,1

Although most of our party wasn't there by then, we still ended up waiting an extra 30 minutes after everyone had arrived. The downside to this place on a hot summer day is that there isn't really air conditioning so if you're waiting for brunch, make sure you've made a reservation; otherwise prepare to wait for a while. The decor is great though--cute, classy, and sets up a comfortable space for a group outing.As for food--we shared the pita bread with three dips. I love, love the spicy feta! The hummus was also good, but the tzatziki was pretty bland. I ordered the scrambled eggs with salmon and salmon roe, which came with a side salad and home fries. Everything was really filling, and my friends also said that the pita sandwiches were great, although one of them ordered a salad with falafel and that surprisingly came out to $25. I thought that was pretty ridiculous given how small the salad was and how few of everything it had in it. Overall would recommend this spot for brunch, but I advise to not order a salad if you're looking for a filling meal.",0,2,0,Amy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",30,220,260

Oh, and they do a really annoying birthday song that's super loud and there were seriously ten bdays in the hour we were there. And they tried to take our food away three times before we were done.

5.0,7/18/2016,"Let me start off by saying I've been to a lot of brunches, and Barbounia has quickly become one of my absolute favorites. The decor/ambiance was was immediately welcoming and made the entire experience that much more pleasant. We had a 12 pm reservation and were seated immediately as it was not too crowded yet (seems that 1pm is the more popular start time as it got a bit more crowded then). Our reservation was supposed to be for 6 people but ended up only being 4 as we had a couple no shows, and our server was gracious about it. Service all around was great.Now for the most important part! Food/drinks. We did the bottomless deal for an extra $20 and it was beyond worth it - mimosas were STRONG. We truly never found the bottom of our glasses either - they were refilled before we even needed them to be. We started with an order of the spicy feta. It was DELICIOUS. Seriously, we wanted to get an order to go of this stuff. It came with hot, right-out-of-the-oven freshly baked bread and we couldn't get enough. The table also came with a bread/pastry basket which was okay, but we didn't care much for it compared to the spicy feta. For our entrees we all ordered omelettes. I got the spinach omelette - it was HUGE and had just the right amount of filling (spinach, fresh mozzarella, caramelized onions).I left feeling full and tipsy, exactly what you'd want after a great boozy brunch. Money wise it's a little more expensive than your average brunch but definitely WORTH it. I'd recommend this place to anyone and I can't wait to be back!",0,0,0,Brittany L.,"Bridgewater, NJ",0,3,0

Service was a bit slow, but the food was good. We started with the hummus, which came with warm bread that was delicious.  We quickly polished off the first loaf and our waiter brought us another. We also tried the calamari, which was very crispy but came on a bed of white sauce that I was disappointed in. We got the pan roasted chicken and the free range chicken sandwich for our entrees, both of which were good as well.  For dessert we split the panna cotta-the tiny pistaccio ice cream scoop nestled on top is not to be missed!Overall, the restaurant has a nice atmosphere and good but not great food.

Anyway, I guess they were trying to make up for it because the wait staff was super attentive. We ordered bottomless mimosas and they made sure our glasses were never empty.  It was the same for our waters.I ordered a merguez sausage and it's not bad.

The first time I came here, we sat on the couch seats, which are very comfortable and make you feel like you're sitting in VIP at a classy European bar. This time we sat at the large bar. The bartender was awesome. They had a 50 shades of pink drink as their drink of the day and he promised to make me another drink if I didn't like it. Well, I loved it! Flavors of mango and prosecco exploded in my mouth, yum! We ordered some dips and falafel from their happy hour menu. The dips were fantastic, hummus, eggplant spread and tzatziki. The spreads came with delicious rosemary baked bread too, delicious! The falafel was tasty too. The bar was pretty empty so the bartender chatted us up a bit.

And one of my ballsy friends talked to him, and no joke, it was another 20 mins until he came to table to refund that $.      Those 35 mins after having paid were painfully long and plenty of time for us all to forget about the good food and friendly staff...

4.0,3/18/2016,"Part Turkish, part Greek and completely alcohol infused, brunch at Barbounia is pretty damn awesome. I really had no clue what to expect when I heard we were coming here, I mean, yeah I basically know what a Mediterranean place is going to be like, but a Greek boozy brunch scene? It didn't make too much sense in my mind, but sounded novel enough. The space itself was chic and airy; a very comfortable atmosphere for brunch, which would seem counter intuitive considering how many people were jammed in the day we went ( the place was PACKED). We lucked out and got a table next to the freshly opened full length French doors. And seriously, who wouldn't love to have an airy brunch in the flatiron district? There's really nothing like NYC in the spring. I have to say, the food is fantastic. I had a burger (which I had no intention of getting), because I saw someone else's and it looked too good to pass up. The Turkish eggs are out of this world (so unique, and so tasty), I absolutely recommend them. Even the bread that they pass out is solid, lightly glazed in olive oil and seasoned nicely. All that said, 21$ add-on for an unlimited brunch coupled with a 16$ meal puts this place on the higher side for brunch, yet the quality of food and the lax time limit absolutely make it worth it in my opinion. I mean could you go to a cheaper brunch? Certainly, but like I said the quality of the dishes at these price points were spot on (not to mention the ambiance of the restaurant); the only reservation I had was that 21$ for mimosas/bellini's seemed a touch on the pricey side, that was, until I realized how long we could brunch for. Let's contrast.Take for example a place like Havana Alma de Cuba; the add-on for unlimited brunch is roughly in the same neighborhood as Barbounia (slightly cheaper), but you get handmade Cuban cocktails, which are delightful. The con is that the aforementioned Cuban cocktails take time to make....and are also comparatively expensive to make. As such, you don't necessarily get a bunch of them, and they are STRICT with their time limit. This is where Barbounia shines (if you have a drinking problem, which I ASSURE you I don't). It takes relatively little skill to pop a bottle of champagne and mix it with juice (or so I am told), and as such they constantly refill your glass. The high price point pretty much guarantees that you can stay for quite a while* without being politely asked to leave ""because you're causing a scene sir, please lower your voice, and put your pants back on"". Not that I would know anything about things like that. To summarize; high(ish) price point, fantastic food, and you can hang out for a while in their chill space without getting the boot. Win. ______________________________________________*Seriously though, a place that lets you hang out after you've paid and continue to sip mimosas and watch the world go by is a-OK in my book.",12,10,13,Chuck C.,"Brooklyn, NY",629,359,2618
5.0,3/15/2016,"***BRUNCH REVIEW***Upscale Quality Brunch! I came here with a few friends over the weekend and was very impressed. Bottomless mimosas and bellinis are an option for an additional fee. The place itself is fancy with gorgeous lighting and high ceilings. Definitely more upscale than my typical brunch experiences. The Barbounia Burger was superb (one of the best I've ever had). It consisted of smoked aioli, caramelized onions, baby arugula and New York white cheddar. It was exquisite! Everyone enjoyed their meal. Don't forget to ask for their specialty bread!

5.0,3/11/2016,"Delicious brunch food with a very dangerous unlimited boozy brunch option. Reservations are a must! Once we arrived we were immediately seated. The boozy brunch is about $19 (I believe), but you have the option to continue drinking at the bar after you've finished your meal! Totally worth my money. Just go to the bar and present the bartender with your glass and it will be refilled until brunch ends. The food prices range between $15-$25 (i'm pretty sure, but double check on their website) but it is also worth every penny considering the delicious options available. Service is quick and staff is incredibly attentive. Will say that tables are a bit crammed but not complicated to navigate through. Want to dine here and try their cocktails!

3.0,3/6/2016,"The food here is good - an amazing place for brunch. Reasonable price point and truly delicious food. The issue is that service is truly horrible. I have never had a truly pleasant experience with the host/hostess, even when I have a reservation. If you don't want to seta people until the entire party arrives, offer customers a seat by the bar while they wait. Servers are not bad, but do the bare minimum. Today, our table ordered a couple of lattes and we didn't even get them until after our food arrived...basic things like that can really throw off the overall flow of a meal. I have such mixed feelings bc the food is great, as is ambiance and decor but my goodness service is just so unacceptable esp. for a restaurant that is at its price point.

4.0,2/14/2016,"Came for brunch with reservations and were seated right away. Opted not to do the unlimited mimosa and ordered coffees (Latte and Cappucino were great).The restaurant however is not very vegetarian friendly for brunch. A friend wanted the eggs benedict but they all had some sort of meat on them. When she asked if she could substitute something (maybe avocado or even just feta) we were told there were no substitutions. The waiter recommended she get the Crab Benedict but without the crab. At $18, no substitutions, this doesn't make a lot of sense now does it? You're paying more for the meat..so found it unfortunate that they wouldn't allow substitutions but she could pay $3 more for feta. When we questioned this, we got a ""It isn't my choice"" response from the waiter. Hmph...a little sassy.AMBIENCE: 4/5Fun decor, very lively but not too loud that it interferes with conversation. -1 star because the table was packed with plates and there wasn't much space at all. Even after we finished our coffees they were shuffled around the table instead of removed to make space.SERVICE: 3/5The lack of substitutions was off-putting, but otherwise they were very attentive.FOOD: 4/5Flatbread - a long thing olive oiled flatbread that was delicious.Bread Basket - we didn't order this but they brought it to our table so not sure if it was on the house after the substitution fiasco or if everyone gets a brunch basket? Two croissants, two chocolate croissants, a lil muffin and a cheese bread were included. Expected the croissants to be fluffier.Turkish Eggs - beautiful presentation and great portion size.Falafel Pita - one of the fluffiest pitas I've ever had. Came with a side salad (slightly overdressed) and a beet slaw with pickles. Yummy.Eggs Benedict - great portion size, actually got to take half home.Croque Monsier - great portion size as well, came with fries, which were nothing out of this world but did the job.Nothing was 'AMAZING' per se, but everything was really good.",2,0,1,Kristen R.,"Miami, FL",463,25,5

Every time it's someone's birthday, they play a ridiculous birthday song that's decibels louder than the already deafening (awful) music they play. In fact, the music was so loud that our waiter ""didn't hear"" our appetizer order, so we never received it. Instead of apologizing, he offered a complimentary bread basket (we declined) and we never got the appetizer we wanted.

As you might imagine, the drinks are pretty pricey and the pours ain't exactly generous. My glass arrived half full - most of it, ice. As far as the apps go, Salmon tartar special was very good. As was the trout app. The surprising thing is for a seafood-based place, to try and categorize medium-sized shrimp as ""Jumbo"" is a bit of false advertising. Perhaps they've never seen the Homestead's jumbo shrimp. In any case, the thing to get here is the Hanger Steak. Amazing. Wine sauce. Cooked perfectly. Awesome. Wasn't crazy about the halibut.

3.0,10/14/2015,"I went to Barbounia for brunch on Sunday with two of my friends. We waited for a table for over an hour, but were entertained at the bar by the $20 bottomless mimosas. While at the bar, we ordered the fried calamari which were delicious! Once we sat down, we ordered the selection of 4 Mezze which included Hummus, Tzatziki, Roasted Eggplant, Taramousalata  and Spicy Feta. Although the freshly baked bread was good (obviously), the dips were just okay. I regretted not ordering the falafel instead. My friends then each ordered the Turkish eggs and were very happy with their selection. I had the Lamb Kebab Pita and was very disappointed. The pita bread looked like it was bought at a grocery store the day before, so I didn't eat it. The lamb was a big flavorless so I only ate a bit of it. If you're looking for a fun brunch spot with a scene, look no further! But, if you're looking for a knock-your-socks-off culinary experience, go elsewhere.",4,1,4,Stephanie G.,"Miami, FL",659,403,188
1.0,10/13/2015,"If I could give zero stars I would. To say this place is underwhelming is an understatement. To start off, to call this a ""Greek/Mediterranean"" restaurant is misleading. This place is more Italian and the majority of the small limited menu consists of pizza, pasta, and fish. Way overpriced, terrible service, and small portions.Let me share my experience at Barbounia. Sat down at 7:20pm with no wait even though place was pretty crowded. Was hoping to have a nice relaxing dinner after a long day at work. Ordered a glass of wine ($15), came out within a minute. 7:25pm Waiter came back and we ordered the gnocchi ($26) and scallops ($35). 7:27pm our food comes out and both dishes are ice cold (never felt so rushed). There was two of us and we both filled our small plates with a little bit of each dish before realizing that the food was cold. After taking a bite of each we had the waiter sent both dishes back. 7:35pm the two dishes come out and not they did not even give us new plates, it was our same dishes with the few missing gnocchi and scallops! To make it even worse, the food was very lukewarm like they just put the dishes under the heat lamp for a few minutes! At this point we were both just so hungry, so we ate our overpriced bland cold small dishes feeling truly disappointed throughout the whole meal. I am never one to complain and rarely send food back, but I truly regret not calling over the manager telling us how our experience was. 8pm I got my $85 check and left, feeling like I got scammed.  How this place gets good reviews is inconceivable to me because this is probably the worst restaurant I have been to in a long time.",1,0,0,Eric S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,3,0

There were a few things of course that could be worked on. To obtain speedy service at the bar you would have to wave your hand or ask another worker to send someone over. The place was very loud so this is not the place to go for a special occasion. On the Lamb sandwich all the sauce was on the tip top so within three bites it was dry the rest of the way.

The food portion did feel a bit rushed, I guess they're trying to clear the tables quickly. But we didn't mind because you can stay in the bar until 4pm and we were the first ones round there so plenty of places to sit.

3.0,9/25/2015,"I have come here a few times before and the food is always good, but the service needed work tonight.My colleagues and I went to a early happy hour when the bar was not too packed. The server promptly provided us water, but neglected us for good 15 to 20 minutes. She seemed like she was the only one running the floor despite the fact that there were others.After we were ready to pay, the server told us that there was a problem with the machine so they asked to minimize the use of the credit cards. Of course, none of us had cash and we were not told before we sat down that there was a machine problem,  so we had no choice but to use credit cards. The server took our cards and tried to use the machine a few times running across the restaurant couple of times. At that point it was already 15-20 minutes since we gave our cards. We called the manager over because we needed to leave. He checked up on it and he gave us paper slips that usually indicates that the transaction will be completed later in the day. The manager apologized and told us that he will serve us right next time. I appreciate that but it was disappointing that during the whole time he was not aware of these issues.The moment my colleague and I left, we realized the transaction went through on our cards, so we were not sure if the restaurant was going to double charge us since they claimed that the machine was not working. So we went back and spoke to the manager again. The hostess said to my colleague, ""do you know what this is regarding."" I am surprised she asked that instead of ""can I help you with anything"" I had a higher expectation of this restaurant as I have been here before but the lack of communication and details signified that things have changed. Considering the fact that there's numerous restaurants on park ave that is competitive, I would think that they would maintain a higher standard.I understand there are times when the machines stop working and there are issues but then they have a duty to be more communicative instead of keeping customers waiting.",0,0,0,Lina G.,"Long Island City, NY",6,61,46

5.0,9/24/2015,"My absolute favorite brunch place - the food is delicious, the people are pretty, and the drinks are free flowing.  It's Mediterranean food done well - the best items are the ones with that influence (e.g. kebab/pita instead of the pizza). It's $20 for all champagne you want, ending at 4pm. Meaning,  if you arrive at 11am for open, that's 5 hours (conversely, only one hour if you get there at 3). It is ordered at the bar, independent of food. You technically don't ever have to eat, but the bar is only one person wide. You'll be moving out of people's way every few minutes unless you snag a seat at the bar.Service is professional and all know what they're doing. Vibe is a nice, busy, Euro, upscale place.

Eat sub-par food accompanied by unlimited drinks to wash it all down. Typically, I fall into the second category, but this past weekend we were more focused on enjoying each other's company rather than building up to body-shots-at-3-in-the-afternoon status. Maybe this place is good for the bottomless, but if you're looking for just enjoying your food, I don't recommend it.So I had the lamb kebab, a bloody mary and also tried some of the Turkish eggs as well. Lamb kebab was very disappointing. Lots of meat but it had weird seasoning and could really have used some more condiments to complement the natural dryness of the meat. Bloody mary was alright but not great for $12. The Turkish eggs lacked flavor as well. I guess you're supposed to do bottomless here, but honestly I've had better food at other bottomless places so I just think there are some better options, at least based on the food that my table ordered.I'll update this review if I come back for bottomless brunch and have a better experience, but for now I have to stick with the three stars.",0,0,0,Kelly M.,"New York, NY",100,159,301

I made the reservation only half an hour earlier, but upon arrival the restaurant was almost completely full, hence the quite loud environment due to the huge gothic hall architecture. The cocktails were perfect and we had a greek salad as a starter, which was ""the best ever"" according to my partner. The entrees were equally great.

The food was fine, but frankly, I have had Mediterranean dishes of similar quality at fast-food restaurants for less than half the price (in fact, on a recent trip to Washington, DC, I had much BETTER falafel and hummus at a casual lunch place called Cava Grill). Service was seriously lacking: the timing of courses was off, our water glasses remained unfilled for long periods of time, and it took forever to get our check. Worst of all, there was a mix-up involving our order, and while in retrospect we realized that we had misunderstood something on the menu, we all agreed that the waiter should have caught that we weren't interpreting it correctly before bringing the unwanted dishes (my husband even asked, ""Do I have that right?"" when ordering -- we took the waiter's silence as a yes, but apparently it wasn't). I had a glass of wine and my husband had one cocktail, and our friend had no drink. For all that, the bill with tax and tip came to nearly $190 -- grossly overpriced for what we got.",0,0,0,T.

Just a day after returning from a trip to Athens to visit my relatives, I met up with a girlfriend at Barbounia for post-work drinks. There is not nearly enough praise or attention for the happy hour here, so I was expecting it to be at once genteel and low key. Instead what I got was busy, buzzing and boisterous - but it's a Greek restaurant, so shouldn't I have expected that? The bar was packed, no space, but there's a large communal table near the front window where my friend and I were able to snag a few seats. I ordered our drinks at the bar, and the delivery wasn't the smoothest (again, packed like mad), but the wait was worth it. I got the Thessaloniki cocktail, and it was fantastic - I'm not even a great fan of gin, but it sounded good, and it was better. My friend described her Athena cocktail as orgasmic. We hung out for two hours, long enough for the lights to dim, which really highlighted the beauty of the interior. I have to come back to try what I think is there ""secret"" champagne happy hour - a card that we got with the bill listed 7 champagne cocktails for $7 each.

Had a 2:30 reservation, arrived a little early and the place was packed, they weren't able to sit us immediately but checked in with me while we waited to let us know they didn't forget about us. Once we were seated our waitress immediately asked if we were doing the all you can drink mimosas, we were, and came back within 2 minutes to fill our glasses. The food here is decent, not the best brunch food you'll have but lets be honest, no one comes to bottomless brunch for the food. The mimosas were made just the way we like them, more champagne then OJ, and our glasses were never empty. The waitress even gave us a round of shots on the house (not the best idea on a Sunday but YOLO I guess).

So once we finished our meal we placed a dessert order, I then got up to use the restroom. The restroom is unisex, on my walk there the manager saw that I had my service dog, we made eye contact he didn't approach me or ask me anything. Once I walked out of the bathroom stall he was there waiting for me! To then inform me abt the pet policy, I cut him off midsentence and informed him that she was a service dog and thanked him for following me into the restroom, I then walked away. How RUDE!

3.0,4/11/2015,"I came here for my friend's birthday brunch. The ambiance was awesome and I loved the food. Per the waiter's recommendation, I got theFoie Gras Sausage Shakshuka- which are baked eggs with chicken sausage in a delicious semi-spicy tomato sauce. What I didn't like: granted we were a larger party, but we had a 1:30pm reservation and we weren't seated until 2:53pm. I don't feel good about having to wait almost 1 1/2 hours for a RESERVATION. That's hardly an acceptable wait time for a walk in. The manager compensated with a bread basket and shots for our party as we waited. That was a nice gesture. However, when a group spends $600 at your establishment and you're in the wrong that's what you should do (so no extra points for that). Around 4:30, we were given a check and notified that brunch ended at 4:00 and that there would be no more drink refills. The manager only accomodated us for 30 extra minutes despite us being seated later by about an hour. We sat at the table for around 1 1/2 hours, paid, and left. To me, getting brunch food right is simple. Eggs, french toast, pancakes etc. will be relatively the same wherever you go. Considering the plethora of dining establishments in NYC, it's the service that heavily influences my return behavior. This place doesn't have that fully figured out so I probably wouldn't come back.

It must be a popular item in the restaurant as I see fresh bread loaf after loaf (I use the term ""loaf"" lightly as its actually like a plank of bread) being churned out of the kitchen and whizzing by.I very much appreciate the attentiveness of the wait staff.

The décor and dim lighting in the dining room made for a great romantic setting. Given the limited selection on a restaurant week menu (typically three choices per course), we made up our minds pretty quickly about what we wanted to order.As a starter, I ordered the wild mushrooms and celery root soup which was just all right but mostly forgettable. As a main course, I ordered pork shawarma which came with gigante beans, spinach, and forbidden black rice. The pork was very tasty and crispy, and it worked harmoniously with the accompaniments (beans, spinach, black rice). I ordered guava gelato for dessert which was delicious- a sweet taste of summer on a frigid winter night.Service was definitely lacking here. It took about 10 minutes for us to flag down the server to take our order, which I'd understand if it were a busy night or the restaurant was understaffed. However, neither of those applied here. The restaurant was nowhere near busy at the time of our arrival (around 6:30PM). The server was not very attentive throughout our dinner either. There also seemed to be something off about the food runner serving our table.. He seemed to huff and puff with every visit to our table.

Also had the five mezes - not a bad deal at 24 and served with authentic Greek style bread.  The usual suspects a - humus, taramasalata, tzaziki, etc definitely a cut above many others.  The spicy feta particularly good.

They refill your drinks so frequently that sometimes I had only taken one or two sips since the previous time they had come around. As a result, after a couple hours, you honestly have no idea how many you've had...for better or for worse! :PAs a vegan, this was a treat. Not many popular brunch places offer a vegan option! I ordered the falafel pita, and goodness, it was delicious. The tahini and amba (it was like mango chutney) made it perfect.",4,1,1,Lauren S.,"New York, NY",292,321,674

5.0,1/14/2015,"I went here for bunch on Sunday with some friends and overall I was super impressed and would 100% come back. We had a 1pm reservation and we actually were 5 minutes late so the hostess told us to just wait at the bar till our table was ready. Most places would have cancelled the reservation so I am thankful that wasn't the case. The place was so packed and we pretty much could not move, not really surprise though. As for the decor. Wow. Beautiful! And the bathrooms were actually super awesome. At the bar we were able to start the unlimited drinks and just take them when our table was ready, which was a huge plus! For $18.95 (plus tax) you could get unlimited champagne, bellinis or mimosas.  I loved that it was not timed and you could switch between the three. Finally at 1:30 our table so ready and they actually sent me a text which was pretty cool and different. The restaurant was packed but I love that we got a table and not a booth sort of thing so we weren't eating right on top of everyone.  For as packed as it was we could actually hold a conversation with each other but that might have been because we did have a table so it wasn't insanely loud. Food -We ordered the humus for an appetizer and as most people commented the bread was super delicious. There was much more humus than bread but they did bring us another loaf. The humus was a little to creamy for me though. For a meal I love that they didn't just have breakfast food!! I ordered falafel pita, which was pretty good. Everyone I was with loved what they ordered; eggs Benedict, a burger, and chopped salad with shrimp. I really loved their fries though.Drinks -Like I said its $18.95 for unlimited drinks and our glasses were never empty. Our server was also walking around refilling them and it was nice that we never had to hunt them down. I can easily say I left pretty drunk.Even after we got our check we asked for another round. The price wasn't bad at all. Since we paid for our drinks at the bar just got the food it came it about $90 for 4 people.This place is awesome. Great value and service. I was beyond impressed.",0,0,0,Angela M.,"Centereach, NY",10,25,41

3.0,1/12/2015,"Went for brunch for a friend's birthday, and the unlimited drink special is an automatic winner for that. We had reservations however the place was so crowded early on a Sunday afternoon there is nowhere to stand that doesn't feel like you're going to get run over by a waiter.  Once we were finally seated I got to appreciate just how adorable the restaurant was, a lot of charm, a real warm feeling.The drink special is similar to that of most brunch places, unlimited champagne drinks so mimosas or bellinis for less than twenty bucks.  The food is Mediterranean so a little bit more unique than your typical brunch menu and includes lunch items as well.  The drink special does not limit you to a brunch only menu you can order anything you want because you pay for it separately. I had a lamb kebab pita, with a side salad and the portion is very generous.  My own fault for ordering something I knew I may not like, however I was still happy with the quality of the food.  Everyone elses looked delicious as well.  Overall great place for a boozy brunch or even lunch or dinner.",3,1,0,Andrea P.,"Deer Park, NY",150,128,3

It is a very warm setting and very lively during brunch. It was so crowded so I recommend a reservation in advance.Service: I think this is wholly dependent on who your server is but when I visited I wasn't impressed. Our server acted as if we were inconveniencing him anytime we asked for anything. Trying to get a refill on the mimosas was such a challenge. This is clearly violation numero uno for bottomless brunch! Food: Everyone in my group thought the food was...okay. We were actually still kind of hungry after we left. Caveat: We all ordered omelets. Still, I have been to a number of brunch spots and ordered an omelet and was just fine. The waiter relayed to us that there were zero substitutions and specifications. However, I had very simple request (i.e. changing the cheese used in an omelet) and he said they couldn't accommodate. So unless they have pre-made omelets I'm not sure how hard it is to pick up a handful of feta as opposed to mozzarella but I digress.All in all the restaurant is beautiful and the crowd is lively.

I'm THERE. I adore this place. First off all, the space is gorgeous. High ceilings, beautiful arches and elaborate chandeliers. 2nd: $20 unlimited champagne. This is a big deal for me, because most places make you go with mimosa's or bellinis.. which make me sick from the sugar. blegh. 3rd: nontraditional brunch food! For some reason, I hate breakfast food. Anything thing with eggs? Nooo thanks. And yes, I know there is something wrong with me. Anyway, Barbounia offers za, sandwiches and other great Mediterranean options. Their roasted eggplant is a must.

We had a party of 4 so split a few dishes, one better than the next.The trio: hummus, spicy feta and roasted eggplant with flat bread - the bread is served on a board warm and fresh from the oven with light seasoning, feta was not too creamy and not crazy spicy so delish, hummus - yes - it is fresh and flavorfulSaganaki - it comes out literally flaming so makes for a fun presentation, chewy and creamy, this had all of the right textures going on...this was the most frequented dish on the tableFlash fried cauliflower - portion size was great for 4, was expecting it to be a bit crunchier but found it fell between textures and while I loved the tahini and lemon flavors, the dish was not as top notch as other things we hadIron skillet shrimp - this dish is a must. Extremely flavorful, big/juicy shrimp Falafel - decent but not fantastic, it was a bit bland/denseCalamari - good, nothing out of this world but good calamari Roasted brussel sprouts - I've now ordered these both times I have been to Barbounia and they are fabulous - even for the brussel sprout haters, it's crispy and seasoned lightly but very wellI came back a few weeks later with a friend who is Vegan - not the easiest person to share with but they happily accommodated us. We split the hummus and flat bread then shared spaghetti in pesto with manila clams and the brussel sprouts. Everything was tasty and for a Tuesday around 7, there was still a light crowd. The service was attentive as always, they even lent my friend a phone charger and kept it safely up front throughout our meal. It's an easy location too - close to the 6 or NRQ.

It deserves one star because the lighting was nice and location is convenient, otherwise here's what my girlfriend and I experienced last night:Service: they seated us 40 minutes late, and we were on time for our reservation. When we sat, the busboy took away my (watered down, expensive) unfinished drink without asking. Worse, the only time our waiter was around (it wasn't busy) was when he hovered over us after giving me the check.Food: practically flavorless. The bread tasted like a foot-long from Subway. Mezze platter (eggplant, tziki, hummus, spicy feta) tasted like they came out of cheap grocery branded containers. I had the lamb and girlfriend the bass for main courses, both of which were awful and priced at $32 a piece. The lamb was definitely just fatty, greasy ground hamburger beef covered by even more cheap bread, and the fish tasted like paper with old canned tomato sauce over it. Waiter didn't ask how our meal was once.When I did finally pay (seemed as if they were in a rush to close) they placed the customer receipt at the top and merchant copy at the bottom of a stack of three papers, one not even a receipt. Sorry, that's a classic move restaurants/bars use to take advantage of customers so they can change tip amounts --not cool. AVOID THIS PLACE.

The hostess had us wait for about 30 minutes at the bar where we were able to pay 20 dollars each to start our bottomless mimosas. After being seated, the waitress was very accommodating and had some great recommendations. The saganaki (flaming cheese) and feta dip were my favorites. I also loved the fries.

2.0,8/12/2014,"I went here for restaurant week after have visited a few months ago for a drink at the bar. Liked the ambiance so thought I would give it a try. I went with a group of 5 people at 7:30 pm on a Monday. Were seated right away and place was reasonably busy. Ambiance of the place is nice, modern decor, dimly lit to create a nice night time mood. Our table split several bottles of Rose, which was good and decently priced. We started with a sampler of 5 dips to start and it was fantastic and a good amount of food for 5 people. Then however, came the entree. I ordered the ""local fish kabobs"" which were supposed to be black sea bass. It tasted more like a frozen cod patty. It was absolutely inedible - tasted terrible - far too salty, very fishy, and certainly no semblance of sea bass. Dessert was an ice cream which was ok, nothing noteworthy one way or another. Service was mediocre at best, took a long time to place our order and our waiter was not terribly attentive. I would not come back or recommend this place.",0,0,0,Lauren W.,"New York, NY",1,4,0

I was looking for a place to have a small crowd of friends go and celebrate a birthday with boozy brunch. The staff were kind enough to cater to a group of twelve and make space in a very crowded already booked place.The going back and forth making reservations was worth it! The food was prepared quickly and was delicious. Portions are very generous. Almost about half of the group were unable to finish the meals. The hostess and manager even asked how everything was personally. We had about 2 or 3 waiters catering to our needs as well. The bottomless champagne drinks for 18.95 was definitely worth it!

3.0,8/9/2014,"Came to this spot for a anniversary dinner. The restaurant taunts itself as a ""Greek, Mediterranean"" style restaurant.  The decor of the restaurant is classy, clean and sexy. Almost club like but not quite.  The bathrooms are kind of dope, there ""semi-unisex"" the stalls are all individual (a door number 1 door number 2 kind of thing) but the sinks are all located together. As far as dress code   I would suggest that guys wear a nice dark colored button up, and lady's a nice dark dress (no panties preferably) The menu has a pretty good selection,  although there are no burgers on the dinner menu only, but there are burgers on the brunch menu. The hostess and staff are professional and pleasant ALTHOUGH the restaurant was about half full and they sat a party right next to my party when there was tons of open tables I HATES WHEN THEY DO THAT SHIT! but other then that service was great. We had the Saganaki for a appetizer,  basically it's a grilled cheese sandwich on fire..... With Raisin Bread and grapes. It's also a dam liability for the restaurant because that shit comes out on fire and they don't warn you..... what if I had a jerry curl..... for the entrées I had the ""Lamb Kebab"" which is basically a Pot pie with 3 pieces oh lamb meat thats shaped like 3 perfect adult sized terds. If you never had lamb just keep in mind that it's very Musty, construction worker musty. Unless you specify definitely the meat is cooked medium rare,  which is normal for lamb because it preserves the taste. My date had the ""Braised Short Rib"" on top of cous cous it looked good. I didn't taste it. He liked it though. There dessert menu really isn't to exciting so we opted out on that. All in All the food,  service and ambiance was pretty good. I would suggest bringing a date here that you've been in in a relationship for a while, not a good 1st date. Or come during brunch before a Broadway play. I'm gonna give this place 3 and a half stars. There's nothing really ""wrong"" with the restaurant.  But it lacks something.  It's not worthy for 4 stars.",0,0,0,Rodney S.,"Bayonne, NJ",7,40,83

Stumbled upon this place a few years back and have been a loyal customer ever since. The bar is awesome, creative cocktails that do the trick while tasting amazing. You have to start with the breads/spreads. OMG. I could eat that all day. They serve a fresh baguette type thing with all these different spreads (hummus, cheese, olive, etc.) - It's insanely good. The specials are always good so start there. If they have the Short-Rib in Tomato look no further. Hands down, top 10 dishes in my life - and I like to eat.

1.0,8/5/2014,"My daughter and I had a 10:00 am reservation for brunch on Sunday.  We were visitng from Washington, DC.  Upon arrival, and we were the first ones to arrive in the restaurant, the hostess sat us at a table.   It took a waiter 10 minutes to even notice us, and the hostess could see us from where she sat us, and never attempted to let any wait staff know we were there.  He asked if we wanted coffee and then we never saw him again.  We waited until 10:30, all the time the hostess noticing that we were not waited on, and she never moved from her hostess stand to get us a waiter.  Meantime, there was still no one in the restaurant, that should have been my first clue.After 30 minutes of waiting, I got up, asked the hostess how much for my coffee so I could pay her and get out.  She went to get the manager, I assume, no idea because no one in that restaurant can speak, obviously.  Then I noticed the whole wait staff was sitting in the middle of the restaurant eating breakfast.  If they don't serve breakfast at 10:00 am, then why did they accept a 10:00 am reservation on Open Table?The manager came, and again, not one word out of his mouth, and I asked him how much was my coffee and he said $2.71.  I gave him $5.00 and then he couldn't find anyone who had change.  I turned around and walked out because I didn't have any more time to waste waiting for the change.  I couldn't believe that there was no apologies, and I had to pay for my cup of coffee.We walked around the corner and had brunch at Craftbar and it was a totally different experience.  The food was excellent, the service was the best we had that weekend and I will definitely not recommend Barbounia to any one who is visiting NYC.There are way too many excellent restaurants in NYC to waste your time going to Barbounia.  If this service is anything like the food, then stay away!",0,0,0,Nancy F.,"Alexandria, VA",0,1,0

I got the Greek salad and he offered if I wanted to add chicken, shrimp, salmon, falafel, kebab. I chose chicken. When I got the bill they added $10 for 5 thin triangles of chicken. I couldn't believe it. Normally it's $2 or $3 more when you add a meat to a salad. I questioned the waiter and he got really nervous and offered to show me on the menu the price. But he couldn't find it. He went to look on the computer but couldn't find it. Finally he told the manager who also told me it's not listed on the menu. I was floored! How can you run a businesslike that without listing prices? Do you just make them up? They offered no remorse. He told me it's very expensive to have a restaurant on Park Ave. What kind if an answer is that???? They were so rude and so wrong. This used to be my favorite place.

As a three-course meal, it was well worth the price. I heard that a lot of restaurants give smaller portions for the Restaurant Week 3-course meal special, but each dish at Barbounia was pretty large.Two points about this meal:1. The waiter asked me how I wanted my salmon cooked. I have never been asked this question before for salmon. I got confused so I said ""medium rare"" (how I like my beef). Wow that was disgusting. DO NOT GET MEDIUM RARE SALMON. Is it sashimi or is it cooked salmon? It was this weird in-between piece of fish that I could hardly finish because it was so inedible.2. SILAN. O M G SILAN. S I L A N. I would come back to Barbounia just for the silan (unless I can find another Mediterranean restaurant that offers this). I've never tasted such light, sweet goodness in my mouth. Everything about this dessert was perfect - from the ice cream and especially to the shredded halva. Everything was in perfect unison. GET IT.Would I come back? Probably not.

I wanted something really filling and our waiter informed us that it was definitely very filling (and it was). It was also well presented and very tasty. The chicken was flavorful (not dry) and came with excellent sauce.

5.0,6/3/2014,"This is my go-to restaurant in the neighborhood. I work just a few blocks away and often venture out here for a business lunch. I like it so much that I have brought back family and friends for a weeknight dinner.Superb service. Staff is really intent on making it a great experience for you. Before you even walk in the restaurant the hostess opens the door for you. From there, you are typically seated within 10 minutes of your reservation time. On average for a party of four, there are three waiters at the table (even during busy times!). All of our dining needs are addressed (sometimes before we even have a time to make a request). My boyfriend's father was looking for an extra plate to share his meal and the waiter conveniently standing nearby whipped out an extra plate without us even asking! Would give 5 stars just for the service alone if I could. Their three spread appetizer is by far one of my favorites. I typically get taramousalata, hummus and eggplant. It comes with freshly baked bread straight out the oven. I have to pace myself to leave enough room for the entry but quite honestly would be perfectly content filling up on the appetizer - it is really good! I often get Grilled Lamb Merguez. After the three spread appetizer, it is a perfect size for the second course :) Have also had pizza there, which is equally as good. All in all, great experience. Will definitely be back!",2,0,1,Olga W.,"Glendale, CA",26,15,23
3.0,6/2/2014,Decor is lovely.  Food is good (as others have shared a few items shine).  It is noisy and the food comes out QUICKLY which can be a good thing or an odd thing.  My service there has been hit and miss.  Nice positive and pleasant greeting at the door.  Spot On service at the bar (thank you Igor!) and the bus crew keeps things humming.  Had a bit of a Diva server the night I was there but again... Hit or miss here. If you want a slower paced quieter dinner I would not come here but if you are in a rush it's ideal.,0,0,0,Jennifer E.,"Long Island City, NY",68,87,3
3.0,6/1/2014,"Barbounia is an extremely upscale place with beautiful decor and a great, diverse brunch menu. I highly enjoyed their mushroom omelet with a side of bacon! Please make sure to take advantage of their $18.95 unlimited mimosa/Bellini add-on for your brunch, as their drinks tend to be pricey.  You will not be disappointed and the service is extremely, extremely attentive to refilling your glass. At the same time, make sure you're attentive to your glass as well, as an unlimited amount of drinks, while tempting, can be quite dangerous! ;)I took two stars off because I was rather disturbed by how many times the waitstaff came to our table to ask if we were finished yet with our plates. Eventually, they gave up, but I could tell they were trying to free up the tables and it got a bit annoying.I also didn't enjoy the fact that our waitress came back with my check to tell me that ""tip wasn't included,"" even though I included it when calculating the overall amount and made sure to indicate this on the receipt.I did end up adding onto my already 20% tip as a result because of this pressure from the waitress, and because I didn't want to be ""mean"" when we had such a great experience here otherwise. Looking back, I feel I shouldn't have had to do this at all. Sorry, Barbounia.

My favorite was the hummus, it was definitely the best hummus I've ever had! Now for the entree...I split the lamp and branzino with a friend.

4.0,4/26/2014,"Walking in on a Friday night with a party of 6 and mo reservations can be pretty hard in NYC. We were supposed to hit the restaurant next door, but the next table they had available was at 10:45pm. Good thing we passed Barbounia on the way to the other place. Decided to come here instead and definitely glad we did! :)They have a pretty fancy entrance that would certainly catch your eye if you were passing by. Staff was pretty friendly, we only had to wait 20 minutes for a table for 6 on a Friday night! Pretty impressive considering the place was packed. While waiting, we thought we'd head over to the bar for liquid appetizers. Two girlfriends and I got the Olympia - a strawberry martini with fresh strawberries, man, it was really good! I think I had three of those all night while one of my friends had four. Haha after what seemed much shorter than 20 minutes (amazing how good company and good drinks make time fly), we were seated. There menus are sheets of paper on a clipboard. The menus are very pretty - font, arrangement, wordings etc, but not sure I liked the clipboard. Lol. Very unique though. :)So we got the grilled octopus and roasted eggplant as appetizers - both were very delicious! But I was a little disappointed that the grilled octopus only had a couple of pieces and wasn't really ideal to share considering the price (next time I'll check portion pictures on here to make sure.) nevertheless, it was still amazing. Oh my, the grilled eggplant was really good too! It's amazing how the Mediterranean cuisine revamps eggplants and turn it into really yummy dips! Despite the variety of fish they served at Barbounia and the fact that I love fish so much, last night I opted for the grilled hanger steak - medium. It comes very artistically arranged on a bed of baby potatoes with some green sauce which I couldn't figure out and don't remember the name of, my bad. It was grilled to perfection, very tender and melts in your mouth - it was so good that my mouth still waters at the thought of it. Hats off, barbounia!

5.0,4/25/2014,"An elegant Mediterranean restaurant in the heart of Flatiron & one of the most extensive happy hour menus I have ever seen. Been here a few times but my most recent experience was most memorable.Our server Mustafa was fantastic. Super friendly, engaging & offered great drink & food rec's. The porters came to refill our waters on a regular basis & we never had to flag down the staff in order to place another drink order. Management was also present & made rounds through the restaurant (always a good sign). Energy is vibrant & a steady, classy crowd of people continue to pile in as the night progresses. We scored a communal bar top for happy hour - section closest to the entrance. If you can't find a seat at the bar itself and you're looking for more comfortable seating, I suggest the communal tables. Plus the bar gets pretty crowded as the night goes on and it's the main walkway path to the restrooms so it's unavoidable to have people push past you. Bathrooms are clean, individual stalls and a communal men/women arrangement. ** Happy hour from 3-7pm daily **$6 wines, $6 champagne flutes, $4-6 beers & mixed cocktails starting from $6 up. Tons of small plates & appetizer options from hummus to shrimp to salads and priced at nearly half the price you would get charged @ dinner time. Delish food & stellar prices for HH in Flatiron. A few must-haves: - Spicy feta: $3.50 (comes with warm focaccia bread) - the value for this dish is out of control (1/3 of the dinner time price). - Calamari: $6 (comes with dipping sauces)- Saganaki: $7 - THIS DISH IS A MUST FOR CHEESE LOVERS. I nearly licked the plate. Basically, fried cheese. Exactly. Comes with a few slices of bread & some grapes. Comes out of the oven piping hot & sizzling so don't burn your tongue! - drinks: Casablanca (lychee cocktail): $6 - a bit on the sweeter side but a great cocktail. Oh, and champagne. Lots of it.

I've always received excellent service, and the food is delicious. Lots of Mediterranean type dishes, and the bread is to die for. Barbounia's bread will make you hate all other breads, seriously. They have a nice balance between meat and fish or seafood dishes, also vegetarian options, so there's something for everyone. I like the mixed appetizer plate with different dips, and of course the bread. The pizzas are huge, and delicious of course! They also do an unlimited champagne brunch special -- highly recommend. There is a nice bar, and you can go for just a drink and appetizers. Also convenient if you're waiting for someone. My only (tiny) criticism is that the bathroom is too dark.

I cannot comment on the quality of the food. However, the service is an atrocity that a five-star culinary masterpiece would not be able to save. After waiting an eternity for a table we were promised would be ready shortly several times, my party took a seat at the bar. The bartender made us feel as though each request (i.e. ""may I have a glass of water"") was an outlandish imposition to her, almost as if her job description did not consist solely of serving beverages. Other bartenders shot us dirty looks for no reason as they stood there muddling cucumbers with a disconcerting look of aggression. Overall, very slow service coupled with an unfriendly attitude is not the way to run a restaurant and I will never be back. The one upside is that one of the bartenders was so oblivious that he continued to refill my friends glass of champagne even though she did not request the unlimited, so that is the reason for the two stars. Also the bloody Mary's had about 1 ice cube each. I don't know about you but I have never met a person who enjoys room temperature tomato juice and vodka.

The food itself was edible and fairly priced. If the service had been better.. or if the busboy hadn't hit on us, then I may have given this review another star. Too bad both of those things happened. Womp Womp.",0,0,0,Rachel B.,"New York, NY",55,36,0

2.0,1/28/2014,"Definitely not good for large groups because you can't hear anything.  Everything is super loud.  We were seated at an awkwardly large table in the front, and so you really had to shout to hear the person across the table.  The placement of that table is also awkward because there are a ton of people waiting around and will like drape their jackets over your chairs. Service was only ok.  I think he sort of slacked off because we had a large party and his tip was going to be automatically added.  He didn't seem particularly enthusiastic to be serving us.  There were definitely times when the mimosas/bellinis hit the bottom of the glass.  (it's about 20 dollars for all you can drink (AYCD).)I got the salmon benedict.  It was ok, but could have used more salmon ($15).  Perhaps it just wasn't my type of place.",0,0,0,Alison L.,"Atherton, CA",103,615,61

4.0,1/23/2014,"Had dinner at Barbounia with three other people on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice--comfortable seating and prompt service. We had the sangria to start which was just so-so. Then we moved on to appetizers which turned out to be the highlight of the meal for me. We had a trio of mezze--spicy feta (could have eaten a whole tub of it), hummus, and tzatziki sauce served with the delicious house bread. We really enjoyed each dip. Next we had one of the best salads I've ever eaten--an arugula salad with poached figs, haricot vert, parmesan, and fennel. I was so sad I had to share it! I should note that our waiter was extremely attentive to my husband's severe allergy to nuts which is just so wonderful when you're dining out as it can be a really serious concern. They double checked every item we had to make sure the recipes didn't include nuts and they left them off our desserts.My main course was good, not spectacular. I ordered the short ribs tajine. I expected it to come in a traditional preparation--inside an actual tajine on a bed of cous cous. Unfortunately, it was a sparse modern interpretation with just a smattering of cous cous and no tajine in sight. The one flat-out disappointing aspect of the meal was the dessert. Against my better judgement I ordered the ""beignets"" just because they sounded good (don't ask me what beignets are doing at a Mediterranean resto). Sadly what I got was under-ripe apples in a sad excuse for fried dough with sour blueberry compote. I'd definitely recommend going for a more traditional dessert instead!I think I'd go back to Barbounia--perhaps if I needed a place to take a group.",2,0,1,Bethany P.,"New York, NY",143,359,14
4.0,1/21/2014,"What an amazing restaurant! Ate here last week with a group of 5 adults and 3 kiddos. It was packed! The restaurant is beautiful... High ceilings, ambient lighting, open, swanky restaurant. The bathroom is quite modern and unisex so don't be frightened.We started our meal with hot herbed flatbread with hummus. That flatbread was soft, hot, and absolutely delicious with the hummus. I'm not a meat eater, but my company was in love with their lamb and steak. I was in love with their falafel. It's probably the BEST falafel that I've ever had!! It had a nice outside crisp, but not greasy and soft filling of chickpeas and spices inside. It came with two dipping sauces, a tahini sauce and some sort of garlic oily sauce.

4.0,1/21/2014,"Went to Barbounia on a Monday night of a long weekend. My brother-in-law and his girlfriend were in town visiting, this was the final meal of a 4 day long eating extravaganza. I hadn't been to Barbounia in over 4 years but knew the cozy yet elegant atmosphere and delicious food would not disappoint. And boy was I right. We were greeted and seated quickly. Our water glasses were never more than half empty and the wait staff was exceptional. The flatbread and trio of apps were delicious, I recommend the spicy feta. The sommelier was incredibly knowledgable and helpful, his Pinot Noir reco was spot on. The lamb kabobs and short rib tajine were out of this world. The swordfish my husband had was a little dry but his sides were cooked to perfection.  The Kanafeh to finish the meal was a slice of heaven, the perfect mix of sweet and savory and rose water.To top off the evening, we received a phone call from the manager 10 minutes after leaving. They had double charged us for the bottle of wine (the one time we don't double check the bill- go figure).

To me this place was exactly what I imagined a manhattan restaurant to be like.For starters we had charcuterie board,It was not amazing but good, I had a bottle of California red wine recommended by the waiter as I'm not familiar with that region. It was a good drop as expected for 88 bucks!.For mains we got scallop and salmon. The scallops were the best part. Very juicy and full or flavor. For dessert I had the chocolate fondant. It was tasty but not amazing. All and all I'd recommend this place mainly due to the atmosphere. Value for money it wasn't the best however the atmosphere and very good wait staff made up for that.

5.0,1/16/2014,"Lamb Terracotta, Steak with Bone Marrow, Hot Flatbread with hummas & olive oil. This place is so amazing, I don't even know where to begin. The best lamb dish I have ever experienced. It started with my confused look of this huge ""pot pie"" looking plate then proceeded to the table side dramatic opening of the flatbread over the terra cotta bowl. This lamb pot pie was filled with fresh stewed tomato, onions, & 3 hearty lamb pieces. TO DIE FOR !!! Steak ???? I know what your thinking, but these little slivers were tender, juicy, and flavorful.... It would make a vegetarian come to the red side.Ambiance... Just sexy. High cielings, arches, Marilyn Monroe, changing table in the bathroom (don't judge, that's sexy to any parent). Kitchen is center stage & diners are the audience. No stone left unturned in having your eyes follow the detailed design and the arch-atecture.  The candles make this place simply sexy. Bring a date, bring a picky eater, bring your family, bring your vegetarian friends, bring them now. It was no problem getting a large group seated (7:30 reservation & they sat us at 7:15).

2.0,10/27/2013,"I was really excited to try this place out, especially since my friend posted a picture of their restaurant week menu that looked exceptional. Well, it must have been the filter that made the food look appetizing, because in reality, it was far from it.I came here with 2 other girls for GNO. We decided to get a bottle of wine which was recommended by the waiter. Great, medium price-ranged bottle ($65), no complaints. As with any women, deciding what to eat and satisfying the many taste buds that we have as a collective whole, we ordered the Eggplant Hummus (not to be confused with the Eggplant AND Hummus, which the waiter mistook me for but I'll get to that later), Scallops, Branzino, Roasted Chicken, 2 cups of after-dinner coffee - a whopping total of ~$250. now, i'm not a stickler on pricing, but i think i would have rather starved the night away than waste $83 (per person) on some chicken and coffee that my oven and keurig can make for under $5. best thing about the meal? the conversation.So, let's get to service. I asked for the Eggplant Hummus. We got Eggplant Hummus AND regular Hummus. Upon delivery, we notified the waitstaff that we didn't mean to order the regular hummus, taking blame for what wasn't our fault. The waitstaff (different from our waiter) looked at us and goes, no worries, on the house. I had a feeling that those words would not have been communicated to the waiter and/or the manager and thus would end up on our bill. One of my biggest pet peeves, lack of communication. If you're going to tell me it's on the house, it better not be on the bill.Anyways, so moving on...friend 1 ordered the scallops. Before ordering, she asked how many would be in the order, the waiter told her 5. When she received it, there was only 4. i ordered the chicken. Friend 3 ordered the branzino. that night, there was also a branzino on the specials list, for 2. Now, if there was only 3 people, and 2 other people already ordered entrees, one would assume that the 3rd person would order for herself, and not for 2, right? Well, our waiter decides to ask her branzino for 1 or 2? ok fine, we can't blame him for double checking and making sure, kudos for that, but he not only just asked her once, he asked her 2 more times after that to which she replied ""i don't understand, do you think i'm fat? is that why you're making sure i dont want the portion for 2?"" so, we were already annoyed and thus criticizing everything at this point. well, after we were done eating, the service got worse. it took forever to get the bill and lo and behold...BOTH hummus-es were on there. annoying. so of course, we had to take that off. luckily, they weren't hesitant about taking it off. after we got the revised bill, it took forever to pay. the manager ended up taking care of us, no idea where our waiter went, i'm assuming he was embarrassed that he unintentionally called my friend fat.If you are on a 2 star binge, then go to this place fast, because I don't see it lasting for much longer in a city known for it's cutting-edge recipes and spectacular service.

You can continue to enjoy these tasty drinks well after you've finished your meal up until 4pm. We certainly got our money's worth. There were so many people there, we were lucky to spot three open seats at the bar. Nuri took care of us... he is fantastic! ASK FOR NURI if you sit at the bar... he's super attentive & easy on the eyes ;) We ended up ordering a variety of things between the three of us..I went with the burger...but got it plain. I had been drinking the night before so I wanted something greasy. The burger was fantastic despite the order mixup. I had wanted it plain but it camr out with all the fixings.

Mostly I just feel sorry for them as they pick at their salads while I'm getting carb happy on the delicious bread (judge me all you want).I've been here 3 or 4 times, but only for brunch since I've heard this place isn't the greatest for dinner. For starters, go with the selection of 3 mezze items- hummus, roasted eggplant, and taramousalata. The complimentary bread for the table goes perfectly with the mezze.

It's also great for sitting around and watching beautiful people walk by :)The service was quick and the servers were super helpful and super nice so I can't complain on that front.

The rest....eh....I didn't take a second bite I was so underwhelmedMargherita Pizza- its thin crust yea...but oooo the taste....it was pretty bland and pretty average....I can get better pizza around the corner from my house for less money!Falafel- Amazed at how flavorless this was......I think something out of the box would have tasted betterGreek salad- yummy with again the feta being really really good and if I went back again I would order this for sureBurrata with figs- totally tasteless and the figs surprisingly had no flavor!Dessert- The chocolate cake was good but nothing super special, the Silan which is their specialty was good but again nothing that special.

3.0,7/29/2013,"In a nutshell: shady happy hour pricing and alright food. My friend and I met there last week for dinner and got drinks at the bar off their happy hour menu. The bartender quoted us each a dollar more than the price on the menu. I got the Casablanca which was printed as $6 and her drink was $7, but the bartender quoted us $7 and $8 respectively. When we asked why, she said for tax, but of course, the math didn't add up and it left a bad taste in our mouths, which we washed out with the cocktails were in itself were quite good.We got a mix of appetizers which in itself was okay. The greek salad was nothing special, and the bufala mozzarella was a disappointment. I'm a big fan of that, but the texture of the cheese was strange and tasted like it had been refrigerated too long so it was crumbly.

By 12:30 PM it was crowded, at 1 PM music comes on, and at 2pm music gets louder. Once we were done with our food, we went to the bar for more champagne (which is allowed and encouraged).

This is a beautiful upscale place.  Vaulted ceiling, marble bar, tables set just a bit apart.  Two hostesses and the lady bartender in little black dresses.  All three were nice on the eyes - better than the gals at Coffee Shop. Background music was set high enough to listen to but not annoying.  Seemed like older American and British pop - fine by me.  No Sinatra, no Lady Gaga.On my own for lunch I sat at the bar, about sixteen seats if I counted right.  Bartender was professional, friendly, was nice enough to offer a splash of the Italian Fiano wine for me to sample.  I went with the Fiano - did not get the maker.  A good size pour for $13.00 - it lasted me thru a half hour lunch.I ordered two tapas - the sizzling shrimp and the gigantes.  The shrimp were nice enough but a small portion.  The gigantes could feed three or four people - nicely cooked. Came with a complimentary flat-bread which was very good - spiced with zataar - for an Anglo I think that I deserve extra credit for recognizing the flavor. Service was fast - I was there for about 45 minutes for lunch. They have an extensive cocktail program with daily specials listed.  Plus they prepare their own infused spirits - there are several glass dispensers at the back bar with vodka, gin and rum combined with fruit and herbs.

The booth was exactly what I had in mind, and the staff was attentive (albeit slightly brusque) throughout the experience. We split the grilled octopus appetizer, which was near-perfectly cooked and had good, simple flavor. The Green Shakshuka was very tasty, and I didn't miss the merguez at all what with all the creamy spinach and cheese. The Crabcake Benedict was less of a crabcake and more of a pile of lump crab, which was well seasoned and cooked. The bread on the benedict was a little questionable (soggy, not really paired well with the rest of the dish) and we didn't eat it. We did order the champagne brunch, which is a great deal if you have more than 3 drinks each. Perhaps my date and I were just being hopeless lushes, but at the time I remember thinking refills could have been more frequent. In retrospect we had about 5 glasses of mimosas/bellinis each so I can't complain at all. In sum, a solid value for a delicious seafood/champagne brunch in a feel-good space.

They are also very pushy in terms of sales, and seem to just try to up-sell menu items, rather than truly listening to what your looking for, and recommending what's right for you.  It almost makes me not want to return, but luckily the rest of the experience is always good, so I keep coming back.

They have a $18 add-on charge for unlimited mimosas / bellinis / champagne cocktails during brunch, an option that we gladly sprung for as a table.We ordered the bread basket which came with muffins, crossaint, some scones.... it was completely drab and at $7 for dry muffins, I actually felt a little ripped off. But I guess the onus is on me for ordering pastries at a Mediterranean restaurant.For my main I went with a more authentic-sounding ""Foie Gras Sausage Shakshuka."" A shakshuka is a Tunisian dish of poached eggs in a tomato chili sauce - an atypical brunch offering that sounded promising.What I was tasted looked more like eggs swimming in a pint of Ragu...and what a sad little coil of sausage in the middle! I consoled myself by tearing into the complimentary Meditarrean flatbread that they presented our table- probably the best part of the entire meal.I will concede that they were attentive with their cocktail pours, BUT after 1.5 hours the hostess asked our table to vacate. The bus boys were scrambling to clear our plates before I had the chance to choke down my final dry bite of crossaint.They offered to purchase us cocktails at the bar if we wanted to linger, but given the uninspiring food and the frenzied brunch crowds, we elected to leave (not drunk, might I add).(Lastly - what's with the untied bowties, hm waiters?

We did get there pretty late but the hostess told us ""about a 45 minute wait, but you can start the unlimited mimosas at the bar."" Ok great! ......2 hours later... Still waiting... I think maybe the hostess was a little off on her estimation. We even checked in with her a few times (we were all the way at the end of the bar so we were afraid they wouldn't see us) but that seemed to frustrate her and add extra time to our wait. By that time, we were hungry and getting pretty toasty from the unlimited drinks. Finally! A table! 2 different waiters came over to us, so that was a bit of a confusing situation and we were basically sitting on top of the table next to us but we were so grateful that we were sitting. We ordered an app for the table and put in our orders right away. They were pretty quick to come out with our food. I enjoyed mine mostly just because it was solid food and our liquid brunch was taking its toll. I can't remember what it was called but it involved spinach and egg in a iron skillet. For a 2 hour wait, I was expecting to be BLOWN AWAY! However, that wasn't the case. My boyfriend seemed to enjoy his croque monsieur though. The place itself is nice. Big open interior but still feels warm and cozy.  Nicely decorated. The kitchen is raised up so you can kind of see what's happening behind the scenes. Pretty cool. I'd give this place another try. Perhaps earlier. Perhaps with a reservation. Perhaps make friends with the hostess since she seemed to hate life and seemed like maybe she needed a hug and a sandwich.",1,0,0,Christine S.,"Manhattan, NY",46,165,2

My friend called exactly 1 week before we went to make a reservation. The woman took down her name, phone number, and time. A few days later, she called back because we had to change the time and the man who answered said we were never even in the book! I have no idea what the hostess did the first time!

The atmosphere will be enough to make the meal worth it.However appearance alone is not all you have to look forward to when going to dine at Barbounia. The food was an interesting complex burst of flavor in everything from the hummus to the bread that was presented perfectly. Started with a fresh spreads combo selection which includes 3 of your choices from such classics as humus etc., then enjoyed their charred octopus before finally moving on to the entree of fresh atlantic salmon. The food is simply fresh and delicious, with generous portions.The place is kind of pricey, in my opinion. In this case, there is an excellent option of their happy hour. They have it everyday from 3 to 7pm. Includes few small appetizers, such as their spreads, and a wide selection of house wines and their specialty cocktails.

We have been here a bunch of times and I have to say I was the least impressed the last time we came.I called in for a reservation for 1pm, and since we were running late I had to call back to switch it to 1:30. They were kind and able to move it around for us, and seated us the moment we got there. Since we had decided on the bottomless brunch, you would think the bellinis/mimosas/champagne would keep coming. Our waitress (Nicole S) took our order and brought us our drinks immediately. We got our food pretty fast as well, falafel, lamb falafel, egg sandwiches.. they were DELICIOUS! no complaints about the food.As far as the bottomless drinks went, there were moments we would be sitting there for almost 10 minutes with empty glasses. our waitress failed to refill our glasses and when she did,  she only filled them up half way. About 15 minutes after receiving our food, the busboys/waitress kept approaching us and asking if we were finished. No, we were not. taking small breaks doesn't mean we have completed our meal. it was getting quite frustrated being that they saw us eating our food and yet still wanted to take our plates away.Towards the end of our meals, we noticed the waitress was COMPLETELY skipping us and did not even fill our glasses. She then said to us, if you are finished, I will take your plates away and you can continue drinking at the bar. We were shocked.. not only were we being forced to eat fast, but we were not even getting half our drinks. She was pouring the tables next to us drinks and purposely avoiding ours. After we realized what she was doing, we decided to leave. Unfortunately, although the food was amazing, the service is what counts more.

4.0,3/7/2013,"Brunch in NYC on the weekend is one of my favorite things to do. Came to Barbounia last weekend with my boyfriend for this favorite pastime of mine. I liked it so much. The ambiance was beautiful and comfortable and there was no wait on a Sunday around 11:45am. We shared the spicy feta (to my surprise and delight it was not really spicy-- a little spice after taste, but anyone that doesn't like spicy would be just fine) and it was served with this delicious, fresh baked bread (both are pictured). They also asked us and offered additional bread (which ended up being another freshly baked LOAF) for free. Both the dip and bread were fantastic-- order it. I thought the bread basket was very reasonably priced ($5 for an assortment of freshly baked croissants, muffins, pieces of cake and pastries). I enjoyed them and had some to take home. The basket had 2 carrot muffins, a piece of delicious sweet cake-- like a pound cake of sorts, but very good, a pastry cheese stick, a plain croissant, and a chocolate croissant) I got the pita egg sandwich (pictured). It was a very large portion and a good value at only $11.50. The eggs were mixed with delicious herbs and there was feta and tomato at the bottom of the pita as well. I don't believe the menu said there was feta with it, but I was happy to have it. This also came with a small side value. I enjoyed both. My boyfriend got the lamb pita sandwich (pictured)-- he also enjoyed this and couldn't finish the whole thing ontop of the other food we ordered (mentioned above). The ONLY complaint I have about this restaurant was that the food was brought on top of each other. I don't like being overly rushed and we were only 1/2 through the feta dip when our brunch entrees came out. I didn't say anything to the waitress, but I really did not like this-- I'm in NYC for brunch, I don't want to be in and out in 10 minutes.

2.0,3/4/2013,"The food here --- amazing. The hummus was zippy and fresh, my zucchini and goat cheese frittata was great, and everyone else at my table really enjoyed their food. What brings this place down was the 2+ hour wait for a table for Sunday brunch.My friends and I arrived at 12:30 and were told there would be a minimum 30 minute wait for a table, which we were fine with.  We figured we'd probably wait around an hour but had no idea it'd end up being over 2. I understand reservations get priority over walk ins, and I feel for the reservations who had to wait extended amounts of time to sit, but there should have been better communication as to how committed they were from the get go. Part of the reason we didn't leave was because we had already paid for the bottomless drink special at the bar, and I kept asking the host how long it would be for a table. They could not give us a time frame and we were the first walk in on the list for over an hour.  We were finally seated at 2:45.What gets me is that they continued taking walk ins and I'm guessing not giving them time frames either. I would have rather been told they could not take us and find another place to go for brunch than wait around like that; not to mention that offering a bottomless drink special and having people wait 2hours to eat is not the safest thing to do. There are plenty of other brunch options in the neighborhood with better customer service. A shame because I could go for some more of that hummus",0,0,0,Raquel L.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,99,0

As for the food, they had some interesting dishes on the menu along with traditional brunch fare. I had an omelet stuffed with mortadella, goat cheese and artichokes. It sounded better on paper than it ended up tasting... it was kind of bland and I ended up just picking out most of the goat cheese and artichokes to eat.

4.0,2/24/2013,"I've always been intrigued by the exterior of the building and one has to be a little wary of the place on Park Ave South in Gramercy due to location potentially hiking up prices. Dinner here on a Friday was busy but the place didn't appear to have people waiting for a table after 9:00 PM. Try to get a table away from bar if you want a less heavily trafficked area. The items on the menu were a little pricey for what they were but there is value to be found in apps section. Some recommendations include the spreads and the falafels. The Hummus, Roasted Eggplant and Spicy Feta were all very tasty. They were each great in their own way but not so overly strong that it would turn people off. The spicy feta had just enough heat, similar to a fra diavola and it was served mixed with olive oil, not dry and crumbled. My advice here would be to partition the dipping bread when it first hits the table before it cools, otherwise it will become more difficult to slice later. The falafels are one of the best ones I've had in the city. They were really full of flavor and tasted like herbs instead of just fried bread at other places. I noticed the interior of each falafel was a bright green, indicative of the ample amount of herbs mixed with the chickpeas. For dinner my friend decided to have the apple and fig salad. Even though its a little expensive for a salad with no protein, my friend said it was a very good salad and had ample ingredients. The Barbounia Mousakka left something to be desired and I'm not sure I'd recommend it. The portion was not large and the lamb was very fatty. I looked over at another table and was immediately envious of the lamb kabob terra-cotta.I rarely order dessert but the Kanafeh was unique and it tasted great. It was a welcome change from the usual chocolate based desserts. The honey anise gelato that came with it was very good as well. Coincidentally, our server had a European accent and he was top notch all evening. So much so that he would fill water glasses and remove empty ones when his bus boys/ food runners did not.

Outside of the $18.95 endless mimosa/bellini special they have on Sundays til 4PM, they have a decent bar offering and surprisingly good food. A few tips:1. Get the bread. Its hot and doughy, comes on a wooden slab with olives and olive oil. Then get the hummus, and dip your bread in it.2. For egg fiends: They have a large variety of great egg plates for brunch - omelettes, baked eggs, scrambles, benedicts, fritattas, etc. 3. The charcuterie is not that good.4. It's usually packed on the weekends - filled with a blend of casual and pretentious groups of bitties who brunch.5.

4.0,1/27/2013,"If you want to feel all hip and fancy AND have great food, then come to Barbounia for a very satisfying and fun experience.Yes, this place is pretty pricy, but you actually get what you pay for: it takes a lot to get me full, and I was OK without getting dessert for once when leaving here after an extremely satisfying dinner (we did actually get dessert here too, but I still usually need dessert dessert).I came here for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night, and it was packed. We had a reservation for a large party, so they had a nice table set aside for us in the corner of the restaurant. This was nice, as we were isolated from some of the douchebaggery going on at the bar. My friend mentioned that she heard this was a hotspot for gold diggers to pick up rich men, and it definitely seemed to be a good call. I saw many a creepy old guy trolling the crowded bar area when I had to squeeze through the packed restaurant to get to the bathroom. This is all pretty standard though for a trendy spot like this.The food though was better than I would have expected. We started with a bunch of the ""Selection of Five"" Mezze platters ($23) for the table, which included hummus, tzatziki, roasted eggplant, taramousalata and spicy feta. I wasn't really feeling the feta (too cheesy for me), but the rest were all amazing, which is probably on account of the fact that each dollop of dip was sitting in a (overly) generous pool of oil (yelp.com/biz_photos/barb…). The bread it came with was also nice and wet, so also delicious. We also started with the Moroccan Cigars ($12). If I had known how much oil I would be consuming in the night, I probably would have avoided this fried appetizer, but it was excellent nonetheless - the fried shell was light and crispy and not too thick, and the chopped up veal inside was spicy and delicious.For our entrees, my wife and I shared the Lamb Kebab Terracotta ($32) and the Braised Short Ribs Bolognese ($20.50). Short Ribs is one of the greatest foods ever, and the Orecchiette pasta was delicious with it. This was a really excellent choice, but the other dish was the real winner. Not only was the Lamb Kebab Terracotta amazingly delicious, and so satisfying I could barely finish it, but it looked really cool too (yelp.com/biz_photos/barb…). It consists of tomatoes, grilled onions, tahini, pine nuts, parsley and a very generous amount of lamb kebab all covered in a soft, chewy layer of flat bread baked over the top of the bowl. It was kind of like a Mediterranean pot pie. It's a good thing it was dark in there, and I couldn't see what must have been the huge pools of oil I was eating and soaking up in this dish with the excellent flat bread.Even though we were beyond full, we tried the Silan ($10) for dessert (yelp.com/biz_photos/barb…): shredded halva, date-honey, almonds, pistachios, rice crispy brittle & milk gelato. We wanted to try something a little different (rather than the standard warm chocolate cake which is always good), and this did not disappoint. It was a little hard to eat as the strands of halva were very long and slightly overwhelmed the dish, but getting a bite of some of that along with the crispy brittle and the gelato all together was perfect.I was also pleasantly surprised by how fast and good the service was. By the time we ordered the appetizers, it was about 8 PM, and the restaurant was completely packed, but they still came out very quickly Even the entrees were brought out quite fast, even though we had such a large party.I guess I shouldn't complain too much about the copious amounts of oil in the food, as it is pretty standard for most of these types of Mediterranean restaurants. I'm pretty sure that's what did me in for the night though and removed my need for getting more dessert - I don't drink, but I have that food hangover feeling from my meal here last night.",4,1,2,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834

2.0,12/29/2012,"I came here last night with 4 of my girlfriends and I have to say I am giving Barbounia mixed reviews.  The positive: 1. Great drinks that pack a punch2. Awesome decor/atmosphere3. Kick ass spicy feta (have your water next to you)/flatbread/dipping sauces.  The negative: 1. WAY over priced- my friend and I both requested a 'side' of feta and tzatziki sauce with our meals and were charged for the a whole order ($8.95).  Entrees start at about $21.00 (pasta) and go up to about $40.00.  2. Terrible service- my friend had to send her overcooked tuna back and wait over 25 minutes for the waiter to come back with her new dish & they didn't even comp her a drink.  Overall, I personally can't complain about the food and would come back if I was looking to get a good drink or grab lunch- in good company.",0,0,0,Mego L.,"Levittown, NY",68,2,0

5.0,12/27/2012,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. Came here for Christmas brunch and it was simply phenomenal!Their spicy feta with fresh baked bread* from the taboon (wood-fire oven) alone deserves all 5 stars. I can probably rave about this mezze for a good half hour. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. No joke.Also very much deserving of a mention: the Greek fondue! Made with Kefalograviera cheese & Metaxa brandy and sprinkled with apricots, it was served with perfectly grilled bread that was just right for scooping up all the yummy cheese.The Mediterranean flavored entrees here are also delish. I usually get their spinach and caramelized onion egg white omelet, but branched out this time and tried their mushroom & asparagus flatbread pizza. Also very good, but it's huge so make sure you bring an appetite!To top it all off, for dessert we got the kanafeh (shredded phyllo dough with sheep's milk ricotta, rose-water syrup, Sicilian pistachios, and honey-anise gelato). Simply DELECTABLE. Barbounia also has an amazing $18.95 AYCD option and the servers were excellent at always topping up our flutes with delicious bellinis. A merry Christmas indeed! Combine all of the above with great decor and a bustling atmosphere perfect for groups and you have one of my absolute favorite brunch spots, hands down!*Note: You get up to two long pieces of bread complimentary; they start charging after that.

The drinks, however, are always enjoyable! I've been for champagne on a Friday night, unlimited mimosas for Sunday brunch-- but the TRUE beauty of this place is the Olympia.

The food gave one of the guests I was with HORRENDOUS stomach cramps. Bottom line, RUDE RUDE RUDE and will not be going back. We had a reservation and they still made us wait for 45 minutes, claiming the table was eating dessert, then paying the check, then paid the check, then back to paying the check. I made a reservation. Doesn't that mean the table was reserved? No, because they overbooked. After they seated us, the waiter came by once- to take out order, failed to mention the one item I wanted to order was sold out and then when I asked if anything else was sold out he said no. I had to wave at him to get his attention. He was standing right next to me. I am paying $30 a plate- wake the eff up. I asked again and he said the falafel. Is it no or is it the falafel. Dude needed a coffee and a new vocation. They took our plates away while eating our apps promising the entrees where right behind. Unless ""right behind"" means 20 more minutes of waiting time then they were dead wrong. My guest is still dealing with a terrible bout of stomach cramps because of them and the service was so subpar, I would warn anyone to stay away.

My friend who I dined with, ordered the Italian Omelet with Mortadella and goat cheese.  It arrived hot, and was fluffy and very tasty.Not sure if i will go back in the near future.  The food was decent but pricey, the ambiance was amazing, and the service was average at best.",2,0,1,Jennifer C.,"Manhattan, NY",191,327,14
3.0,10/25/2012,"Upbeat Mediterranean restaurant in Gramercy. The decor is beautiful and impressive, the music a bit loud, but still OK. We came here for late brunch (3pm). We had the spicy feta, the urkish eggs, and the lamb kebab pita. All dishes were delicious.We were not fully satisfied with the service though: We ordered the bottomless mimosas, which seemed like a great deal. However, it was very hard to find anyone's attention, including our waiter's, to give us a refill. We were finally told that the bottomless mimosas stopped at 4pm. Neither did we know nor were we told before, which in my view is a rip-off. I understand that the happy hour stops at 4pm and the manager was right to point out that it says so online, but our waiter should have told us when we ordered or at least make an effort to give us another round of mimosas before 4pm. Obviously, we were not happy to pay the $18 for one mimosa on the bill, so we complained to another waitress who took care of us and took off the charge. We got a free round of shots, which was a nice gesture, but this misunderstanding should simply not have happened in the first place, therefore my 3-star rating.",1,0,0,Erik D.,"Manhattan, NY",25,83,0
3.0,10/19/2012,"Came here once long ago when I was little with my fam but visited yesterday for a work lunch.  The decor is really beautiful in here- large space, lots of plants, a very serene Mediterranean theme.  I stopped here with two colleagues at 12:30 for lunch on a Wed..it was actually very quiet.  It got busier as we went into 1pm, onward. There's a lot on the menu- flatbreads (their bread and butter), sandwiches, salads, entrees, burgers.. my colleague got the burger. It looked juicy and big.  He skipped on the fries because he said they were extra crispy and greasy. Why anyone would pass that up is on me. Our other colleague treating us was not feeling up for eating but he did fine with his double espresso and lemonade.  The waiter brought out their signature flatbread (plain) to start  - it was fresh, and oily.  It could have been slightly softer but I liked the real olives and olive oil. I ordered what I thought was the marinated brick chicken- grilled chicken glazed with an orange sauce, with semolina mashed potatoes and pickled oyster mushrooms. Also came with a nice side Greek salad (no cheese or olives- mainly tomato, cucumber). The funny thing is.. they brought me the wrong dish.  My chicken was supposed to be grilled, however, out came a flat chicken cutlet (same were correct, as both dishes had the same).  I guess I am docking 1.5 stars for this serious error in judgement- I didn't want to cause a scene in front of my coworkers so I just ate my lunch.  In hindsight, this is pretty unacceptable.  And I could have saved myself from an extra 500 calories if I'd had the grilled chicken I asked for.  Otherwise, waters were filled and they were polite.On top of the misorder, I'd have to say Barbounia has more going for it on decor than food. It's just ok- good semolina mashed p's but the chicken milanese is nothing special. I don't even think I got a lemon to moisten it a bit.  The salad was fresh but just salad.

I'd say 75% of the time they've been good enough, but 25% of times they were acting sorta wack. Like ""ehem... we're all booked..."" It's like, oh, that's cool I'll hold off on the Mediterranean Cheesecake Factory... Goin for BBQ down the street. (exaggeration/hate, of course.) The food is actually really good.

5.0,10/16/2012,"For my friend, Brad's birthday, he gathered a bunch of us together for a Saturday brunch at Barbounia. As soon as I got this invite I was excited. Barbounia is a restaurant I've been wanting to try and it exceeded all my expectations.The interior of Barbounia takes a page out of the Mediterranean with high ceilings, arches, tan and orange colors and an overall very European feel. The seating arrangement is equally as impressive with tables, booths and hightops woven in an intricate design across the floor. The booths, lining a wall adorned with an enormous picture and mirror, have plush pillows inviting you to hunker down and stay for the afternoon.We arrived at 11:30 a.m., a little early for your typical New York City brunch, and Barbounia was practically empty. Our party of 14 was seated at a long high table close to the bar and right by two floor-to-ceiling windows letting a nice fall breeze in. Despite it being empty, the restaurant quickly filled up and before long, there was a line at the bar as people awaited tables.Since we were a large group, we were required to order off the four course brunch menu, with some of the courses served family style. Additionally, for around $14 dollars you get all-you-can-drink mimosas, bloody marys, etc. The family style dishes we received and main entree I ordered were:    Homemade Spreads and Flatbreads: hummus, tzatziki, roasted eggplant, taramousalata, spicy feta    Chopped Salad: chopped cucumber, tomato, onion, parsley, mint, sumac and lemon tahini dressing    Terracotta Shrimp: sizzling in lemon juice, parsley, garlic and olive oil    Greek Fondue: kefalograviera cheese and Metaxa 'five' brandy    Shashuka Merguez: baked eggs with tomato sauce, paprika, garlic and homemade lamb sausage    Malabi: with raspberry Coulis, berries, toasted coconut and pistachio    Silan: honey date, almonds, pistachios, rice crispy brittle, shredded halva and milk ice cream    Pogata: assorted homemade gelato and sorbettoThe homemade spreads and flatbreads were the perfect start to brunch. A long and narrow toasted small baguette arrived on a wooden cutting board accompanied by five different types of hummus and spreads. These spreads ranged from your traditional hummus to one with fish to one with a kick to it. They were all equally delicious and were perfect on the toasted bread.The next dishes kept us happy as well. Shrimp swimming in olive oil in a iron skillet and cheese fondue with raisin bread in another iron skillet arrived at the table. These plates didn't last long. I loved both of them, with the shrimp having a nice grilled taste to them and the fondue being nice and mild which allowed you to really taste the raisin bread.My entree, shashuka merguez, kept the trend going with delicious baked eggs served in a skillet and drowning in tomato sauce. The dish came with a long piece of homemade lamb sausage that had a little bit of spiciness to it, adding a welcoming kick to this dish.Onto dessert! The highlight of dessert was definitely  the silan. This was unlike anything I'd ever had and everyone at the table couldn't say enough about this dish. The shredded halva had us curiously scratching our heads as we tried to figure out exactly what the hair-like topping was. It was almost like cotton candy with a sweet and sugary taste and we greedily licked the plate clean. This, in combination with the rice crispy brittle and ice cream, had us all in heaven.Once the food was finished brunch wasn't over yet. We picked up our glasses and headed to the bar where we were welcome to continue our all-you-can-drink brunch until 4 p.m. The bar was very crowded but we were able to secure a corner and our group readily took advantage of the deal. This is by far one of the best deals in this area for all-you-can-drink brunch. The bartenders were quick to fill up glasses and the entire restaurant had a great buzz about it.

I sucked up my pride.I called for the reservation, normally the large party we had would require some sort of pre-fixed delio but the events girl was nowhere to be found so they just gave me a table.As soon as we came in someone told me that the cork fee was $35.  Wow I didnt know the palce was BYOB, so of course a $35 flate fee was nothing in comparison to city cocktail prices.  I hurried back to the limo to retrieve our bottles only to be told, based on size, they would be charging $50.I set my budget for the night extremely high, and $15 was not a big deal, but they told me 35 and I would not go down without a fight.My waitress was a sweetheart, yesing me to death and I drunkenly vented to her.  In fact, they were all sweethearts.. except whoever was from management I had to deal with.  I think hed had some Russian name I can't remember.What happened to the customer is always right?  It's my sisters Bachlorette party for Heavens sake!  I understand this place is prestigious and could survive without our business, but they could also afford to waive this extra charge and provide me with the original price I was told, or at least send me a friggon free piece of cake as an apology.No, instead my dinner started off full on arguing with this irritating man, and if you've read my other posts, I'm not a fussy being.  But fair is fair.""Hey, I was told the corkage fee was $35 so I went out of my way to call the limo back.""""Yes but your bottles are bigger than standard and we have to make some kind of profit"" (as if $35 to open a bottle isnt a profit)""Listen I work in the restaurant business myself, I know you have some leeway here"" (Even I had leeway and I only waitressed)""Oh you work in the restaraunt buisness? Good for you.""""Are you giving me an attitude?""""No.""I walked away.  I was already getting vibes from the other girls that me being difficult is only going to ruin my sisters day.We shared some appetizers among the table.

I think something a little more simple would work best with the spreads. The charred octopus appetizer was melt in your mouth delicious - cooked perfectly with lovely beans and tomatoes. I was feeling rather full by then, so my husband ordered the Lamb Kebab Terracotta and promised to share and I got a little side salad. The lamb dish was out of this world. Flavor was delightful - packed with lamb in a piquant tomato sauce with grilled onions and tahini, baked into a terracotta dish that was covered with dough that baked up to the tune of a naan type bread. They cut into it for you when they serve you and you can use it to wrap the stew in. I would go back for that and the octopus any day.

The bread they start us out with had way too much salt and oregano on it. You could taste the baking soda used in the batter of the calamari which made it salty. The best appetizer was the shrimp and octopus. We had the lamb kebab entree and the potatoe gnocchi to share and they were both delicious. The bread on the lamb kebab reminded me of NAND bread which I couldn't keep my hands off. The gnocchi was amazing but they only have us like 6 pieces in the entire dish and the rest were mushrooms. Dessert was terrible. We got rice pudding and it was way too lumpy and sweet. Overall, I will not be returning.",0,0,0,Sotiria K.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,9,3

It is just shredded small crab meat with an overload of spinach.I am not into the flavour of the crab here. I didn't remember this and so I ordered the crab benedict again - now I am reminded of how I didn't appreciate the crab benedict here. The meat doesn't taste sweet and it is a bit off putting for my taste buds.I should have got the damn foie gras sausage - those were good.The bread basket is a nice touch.Cornbread tasted like a cake.

1.0,9/8/2012,"While I agree that the decor and food at Barbouniacan be quite good, the absolutely horrific experience I had with a bottle of wine makes me tell everyone to proceed with extreme caution.Ordered a bottle of red wine which seemed to taste fine. My firend finished the bottle and found a large amount of red sludgy residue in his glass. It looked like red mud. Definitely took away our appetite and any desire to stay there. When I complained to the manager he took the glass away before I could take a picture of it and told me ""in France this happens all the time.""I had to stand up to find our waiter to get the check.For a pricey restaurant, it is not fine dining.

We started off with the entire five-set appetizer served with some of the VERY best addictive home-baked bread in New York. (Allright, I can't verify that it's home-baked, but I've done my share of baking and this is waaaay up there.) And excellent taramosalata!Tons of adorable servers with great haircuts don't hurt. The service could inch up a notch or two, but we had no wait at all and the appetizers came in like, two seconds. They're a little slower on the drinks, but forgivable 'cause we got food and watered in just a few minutes. Prices... this is not a budget house, so be prepared. To be frank, I didn't pay the bill, so ... maybe I just should have ordered twice as much??The artwork and decor deserve a special mention. Whoever designed this place has great taste.

I wish I had taken a picture of the grotesque desserts that some of my friends got after receiving disappointing starters and entrees. What looked like turkey chili with a dollop of sour cream was actually supposed to be a Chocolate Semolina Pudding. The Malabi (supposedly the texture is similar to panna cotta) was a joke. The texture was firmer than jello. I literally only ate the two blackberries and three raspberries that topped it. The only thing that saves this place from getting one star is the sweet/almost overbearing staff, consistently checking in every 2 minutes. It felt like each person at our table had their own server.

4.0,7/30/2012,"I went to Barbounia this Friday with my parents,  for an absolutely delicious meal. Really I would give it 4 and a half stars. Rather than order our own main courses, we ordered a few different appetizers, because there were just too many great sounding apps to choose just one.1) Hummus: I'm a huge hummus person and this was one of the best I've ever had. And they serve it with this freshly baked long flat bread that they'll keep bringing out for you as needed.2) Iron skillet shrimp: Sooo good! It's served in this garlicky oil that was so good we kept dipping our bread in it long after the shrimp was gone. 3) Charred octopus: The reviews on the octopus were mixed on yelp, but I'm happy to report that ours was delicious and perfectly cooked. 4) Lobster special app of the day: Not exactly sure what was in this besides lobster, definitely some fennel, but it was also creamy and tasty.5) Chopped salad: This was like your classic Israeli chopped salad with no lettuce, and some tahini sauce on top. MMM! I love Israeli salad and this was amazing. For dessert we had Malabi, which is a light custard with a Raspberry-hibiscus Coulis, berries, toasted coconut & pistachio. It also had a bit of rose water in it. I normally am not a fan of flowery desserts but this was light and yummy.Overall, this was probably the best Mediterranean cuisine I've had in the city, and would definitely say add it to your list of ""must eat at"" places in NYC.",0,0,0,Rebeka R.,"Manhattan, NY",10,7,4

Not only did they have a kick, they were absolutely delicious. I didn't have to search for my waiter to refill my glass..he knew exactly when I needed him. It was extremely crowded, we had reservations but we still ended up waiting for about 15 mins. Which was fine by me..I had the pancakes and the Canadian bacon, my friend had the salami pizza. Her pizza was delicious. My pancakes were kind of on the thick side, buy I'm a pancake person..so i devoured them. Of course the co-ed bathrooms were awesome. I left this review one star shy of five because they were REALLY kicking us out of our table after we finished eating. Like the waiter let us know we had to get up, which was a little rude.

Veggie plate, lamb and other entrees were also great. Service was excellent - we had a very large party - about 20 people at 2 tables and everything was prompt. They weren't too busy as it was a Wednesday night but service was still good. Brunch was also excellent - iced cappuccino was great. Eggs benedict with spinach divine. Pancakes are amazing - somehow they are both fluffy and a little crispy but in a good way. Omelettes are enormous!! One issue - it was super hot outside and not much cooler inside - they were packed but still...then they sat us next to the hot kitchen. They moved us quickly and with no issues. Now...they DO take reservations...but...we had a simple table of 4 and had to wait almost 30 minutes despite reservations. And the only reason we got sat was I went up to ask them what the hold up was and magically a table (near the hot kitchen) appeared...even though I saw 3 girls come in AFTER us (possibly with no reservation) get sat before us.

Also, for $18 at brunch, you can add bottomless cocktails (champagne or mimosas) and they are definitely NOT stingy at all... even when I didn't want any more to drink, more champagne somehow ended up in my glass, ha!However, despite the awesome food, I do have a few major problems with the service. First of all, one of the waiters is very bizarre and put his face right in my face to smile at me and tell me he recognized me - no idea how or why, but it was just plain weird and awkward! Secondly, when I came for brunch, I ordered eggs that came in a very, very hot skillet - and when the staff put it down, they didn't turn the handle away from me! Needless to say, I burnt my arm pretty badly... it hurt for days and I still have a scar (from early May). When it happened, my waiter ran over with a bandage and spray - like it happens all the time!! I am glad he bandaged me up, but, um - if this happens all the time, wouldn't the place come up with an easy solution, such as cloth coverings on the skillet handles, or simply placing the handle toward the center of the table?! It's not that hard. They also didn't really apologize or offer me anything in return for my burn, so that seemed kind of rude to me.Anyway... perhaps I will be back.

1.0,3/18/2012,"AWFUL experience here for brunch. The service seemed to get progressively worse, and the food was absolutely nothing special. I can see how people would go here if they don't know better. The decor is nice, and the menu is promising. We were certainly fooled enough to make a reservation.  My group of three each ordered different variations of their egg dishes and each of our eggs were improperly prepared. All of our eggs were undercooked with runny whites. Ummmm If a brunch place can't do eggs right..... We had a brunch reservation for 3 at 11am. This is relatively early for the NYC crowd and the restaurant was nearly empty when we arrived. They sat us at a tiny table more appropriate for 2 people, even though there were tons of larger tables available. When we asked to be moved the waitress said no, only tables for 4 could be seated there. As we dined, two parties of 3 were seated directly next to us AT THOSE TABLES. My friend asked to make a few substitutions to her dish -- we were told this was not allowed. I had to ask multiple times to have my coffee refilled, as did my friend for her to receive her bellini. They have an option for unlimited champagne or bellinis for $17.95 with brunch, however my friend chose to simply have one drink. While we were chatting, we didn't realize that a busboy had come over to refill her champagne glass without us asking. The waitress immediately came over and alerted us to the mistake and asked if she could take the glass. I was disgusted -- my friend didn't need the drink, but this was clearly their mistake, and she literally was going to take the glass off the table and toss it rather than let my friend have a complimentary drink?? I argued back and forth with her for a good minute about the clear ridiculousness of the situation before she gruffly just said fine just have it and walked off. After promptly clearing our plates when we paused with our forks, and hurrying over with the check, the manager came over and asked us to move to the bar if we wanted to stay in the restaurant because they wanted to turn over the table. Might I add that there were still plenty of tables in our vicinity that were empty. I have never been inspired to write such a poor service review (I actually signed up to YELP specifically to write this review because I was so put off by this place.) Needless to say I will not be returning.",2,1,0,Danielle F.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,23,0
1.0,3/18/2012,"This restaurant is absolutely deplorable. The food is just ok, and the service is one of the worst I've ever experienced. Went for Sunday brunch with two girlfriends- the restaurant was empty and they refused to seat us at a four person table, instead we were seated at a cramped 3-setting table meant for 2 and it was right in front of the host stand and entrance. I ordered a bellini and it didn't come until the end of our meal, therefore I told the server I didn't want to do the bottomless deal ($17.50 for all you can drink mimosas and bellinis). To my surprise, another bellini was poured by a bus boy and our server came over and told me it was a mistake and asked if she can take it away. REALLY?! So rude. We asked if she was just going to throw it away, if I could just have it, I mean what a waste. She told me it would defeat the purpose of the bottomless deal, which makes sense but this wasn't MY mistake....THEY made the mistake. After letting her know I felt that was a very bad way to treat a customer she agreed to let me drink it. As we were getting ready to leave, the floor manager came to our table and invited us to enjoy the bottomless champagne drinks at the bar, and to please get up from the table because there are other people waiting. We literally were putting our coats on when he asked us this- completely unnecessary and classless. Food is NOT WORTH IT for this type of service. Gross.",0,0,0,Geri C.,"Merrick, NY",11,17,0

Everything was very fresh and well thought out. The flavors were balanced and satisfying. The only dish thing I would change is the duck, which was very very sweet and made the dish feel heavy.

The decoration was lovely and ambiance, warm and cozy but the noise level...the NOISE. It's not a super casual setting where club/lounge music is played (God forbid!)  for it to be as loud as it was. The bar was attentive even though the aisle was narrow and the space surrounded it was crowded as I was getting a drink while waiting for my group. The food was decent. Nothing swept me off my feet. The appetizer, oysters, were ordinary. Plain but ordinary.  My entree, the duck, good, but not as impressive as I expected it to be.  The best part of the evening was the wine: Beaujolais (glass) and then bottle of Louis Jadot, Burgundy, and my dessert: a baked cheese with honey drizzled on top.

My friend ordered the blueberry pancakes - she seemed to like them, I thought they were too doughy.  The side of sausage she ordered - that was pretty tasty.  Would not come back here for food, but the bar area was nice and they had a good selection.  I could see coming back for a drink at some point.",3,0,0,Clifford R.,"Manhattan, NY",50,169,8

Had the pork roast which was dry, but the drinks were nice and strong which made up for it!

We squeezed into our table where the chairs barely pulled out and we were pretty much knocking elbows with our neighbors and overhearing their conversations. Yes, we did the unlimited champagne cocktails (for $15 on top of price of entree) and I loved that they had a choice of mimosas or bellinis or switch back and forth. I ordered the steak and eggs to which the server asked how i wanted the meat cooked. I like my steaks medium-well, which he found to be insulting. He shook his head and said ""No!"" Then hesitated to explain that it was a thin cut. Fine. Then just bring it cooked, not raw, if those are my options. As we waited we had the bread which was very good and the champagne was flowing steadily. Food arrived - steak was cooked. Just the way i like it. Eggs were good as well and everyone else seemed pleased with their meals too. Eggs benedict seemed a bit on the smaller side, but was still delicious. 2 Desserts: one was not memorable for me, but the Silan (shredded halva, date-honey, almonds, pistachios, rice crispy brittle & milk-caramelized coffee gelato) had an interesting combination of sweet and sexy flavors - i Loved this!Afterwards we moved to the bar to continue enjoying the unlimited cocktails. Unfortunately we were never told that they finish that service at 4pm. Which was okay cuz we still got our buzz on, but would've been nice to have gotten a heads up.I'd rate it a 3.5 if i could.

The seating is incredibly close to each other, so you're able to hear your neighbor's conversation, even using an inside voice, and there is no room if you had a coat and a handbag with you to place anywhere.I ordered the bacalao appetizer and the seafood pasta. My boyfriend ordered the grilled oysters and the Dorale (fish). Appetizer portion was very good, grilled oysters came four and seasoned with melted cheese.  A bit odd, but great tasting. The seafood pasta was really a good size, past a bit too al dente because unfortunately some pieces were still raw and the saffron overwhelmed the dish.  But you get two large shrimp and four pieces of mussels so it was good to share with my BF.  His fish dish was actually really well made and the eggplant was cooked enough.The price of the Pre Fix (2 people), one glass of wine and one additional appetizer with 15% top came out to $132. A little too pricey for poor service. The food was acceptable, the portions are very very adequate and we were full. The dessert, Kunerfe was really delicious and pretty big.

We started with the trio: hummus, spicy feta, and tzatziki with an herbed bread and olives. I want to eat that spicy feta every day for forever. So good. For our main meal, we split a few of the appetizers. The charred octopus was my absolute favorite. So simple, but it was cooked perfectly and the fennel went really well with the dish overall.We also got the beet salad, which was a nice complement to the octopus. It's all beet though. If you aren't a fan, this is not your dish.The steak tartare was the last thing we ordered and the most disappointing dish. I usually love tartare, but this dish was confusing from the start. First of all, it's green. HUH? Okay fine, the menu did indicate lettuce and artichoke. But then it almost had an egg salad taste and consistency. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.

The bar was packed on a week night.  The drinks and wine were very good.  The Meze were very good, too.   The spicy feta was a pleasant surprise.  The rest of the menu was a bit perplexing. I was expecting Greek, but this was more med fusion.  Many entrees were over $30.  The special of fish for two was 75 bucks.  This was one of the few restaurants that I have ever been to that didn't have chicken on the menu (I'm not complaining about this, but the rest of my family is a tribe of dedicated chicken eaters).   The pizza was good, a variation on the excellent flat breads that the restaurant serves.

The atmosphere was great, seating I recommend is one of the corner booths, food selection very limited and no traditional Greek food. The lamb skewer was presented well and I couldn't wait to open it up! Unfortunately I opened it up to reveal 3 pcs of over salted, charred lamb or at least meat they seasoned and called lamb.

I ordered a dozen oysters to snack on their mignonette was not the best. The oysters themselves were chilled nicely, shucked well.  The sign on the door for oysters were $1.95 and they charged $2.50 instead. It was their mistake and the lady bartender with the Eastern European accent admitted it was the house's mistake. She was just CLUELESS though and told us to wait for the manager because it would take a few minutes and that it was that fault. 5 minutes into this wait and still waiting no manager. The difference was $6 and it was the principal of the matter more so than the $6 as we tipped 20% as usual on the bill. So I stopped and asked the spanish Bartender I said the difference is $6, the house admitted they had their signage wrong, can you just give us the $6 and work it out with your manager?

5.0,9/18/2011,"I'm at the point in my life where I'm done with Greek food. I grew up in Whitestone, Queens (which has a shitload of Greeks), 4 of my best friends growing up were Greek and now I live in Astoria, which they say has the biggest population of Greeks outside of Athens. So after 27 years of frequenting countless Greek restaurants and tavernas in Astoria and other boroughs, on top of that, having Greek home cooked meals throughout my life AND I visited Greece while in the US military (I'm Croatian-American, if you were curious haha) I've had gyro, souvlaki, saganaki, spanakopita and pastitsio made every way you could think of, on this side of the pond and in Greece.Ok, now back to Fall 2011. My gf tells me we're going Barbounia, a Greek place in the city, for dinner. Immediately, I was like ""hereeeeeee we go, same old boring shit"". Wrong, wrong, WRONG. To start off with, that toasted bread they give you is some of the best bread I've had in a while. Best charred octopus I've EVER had, EVER. I mean, it would melt in your mouth and was seasoned perfectly. The red snapper crudo was perfect as well; came out sashimi style with shallots and sprouts.Then I began bringing down my hopes; nothing on the entree menu really caught my attention and I opted for the prawns. Right? How hard is it to fuck up prawns/shrimp? Again, I was blown away - the prawns were succulent, just the right size and seasoned to perfection. My gf's dorado fillet was ... you guessed it: PERFECT. And the cherry on top? The place is super chic, the vibe and ambiance were great and those high ceilings and trendy decor really added to a cozy and intimate dining experience. My only bone of contention was the prices. If all my food wasn't out of this world, I'd be pretty pissed off about paying $14 for a bottle of Hitachino's Nest white ale. Ok, I know it's a good quality beer and it's usually pretty expensive - but $14 for a 10 ounce bottle?! haha. If you're a fan of high quality Meditteraenean food and have the means, price won't matter - but just know, you're gonna pay for the good stuff you're ingesting. Now, when folks want my #1 recommendation for a Greek spot in NYC. It won't be some taverna in the middle of Queens or some high priced dump in midtown, it'll be Barbounia.",9,1,4,Jordan D.,"Providence, RI",318,706,90

It's lively but not too crowded to move. The menu is original and all ingredients taste fresh and delicious. Add to that that the bottomless mimosas rarely went empty for longer than a minute and you have yourself an excellent brunch experience.Not sure what kind of review they would give me - I was having so much fun that they had to pry me out of the restaurant (albeit very politely) at 530 pm so they could have their dinner sitting. Sorry about that Barbounia people! and thanks. Again!So after reading some reviews I was weary, but I was VERY pleasantly surprised.Food was phenomenal. Even something as simple as an Israeli salad had a delicious twist. Merguez - also fantastic and juicy, and apparently homemade. Add to that some really spectacular service. Not sure if they changed their ways after reading previous yelp reviews, but everyone went above and beyond to accomodate our requests (we asked to be moved to th ebar after being seated at a table). We had the opportunity to chat with the manager, the waitress at the table, and the bartender who eventually served us - all were lovely and personable.

3.0,8/23/2011,"Went here for Sunday brunch with a couple of friends when visiting one of them in NYC for the day. I love Mediterranean cuisine and it's my requirement that when I go to NYC, I must try a new place. I almost always go with the sampler-style platters of dips, and I did at Barbounia: tzatziki, hummus, and taramousalata. I went into this meal with high expectations because of the hefty price tagged placed on this trio ($17.50). I know it's New York, and it did come with an entire loaf of flatbread, but I would've liked to see more variety in the ""dipping supplies"". The flatbread was delicious, but some pita and/or veggies would have also enhanced the experience. I could be alone here, but I like to try different combos and only one thing to dip into the sauces kind of restricted me in t hat area. I asked for some cucumbers on the side but with a $3.50 price tag, decided against it.The hummus and tzatziki were both wonderful. The hummus especially tasted so authentic and I could definitely tell it was homemade. The taramousalata was saltier than other varieties I've tried, so I'm not sure I liked it as much, but I did like how finely chopped red onions came on top (though those were gone in the first dip). The bread as I said before was very good, but pita would have been better.My friends' meals came out great. Lanting got a lamb pita with some tasty thyme-seasoned fries. She did say the pita had a bit too much tzatziki on it. Hong really enjoyed his crab cake benedict though - he had no complaints. Our food came out extremely fast, as in within ten minutes. We were in a hurry so that was great, but I'm not sure I would have liked that otherwise. The decor of the restaurant was absolutely gorgeous - I will upload some photos when I get a chance. The bathroom sinks were even pretty! The high ceilings and dramatic pillars and curtains really made this place a sight to behold.I'd recommend Barbounia for a pretty dining experience, but there are certainly other Mediterranean places in the city where you could probably get the same food or even better food for less.",0,0,0,Caitlin C.,"Allston, MA",310,26,26

First I'd like to say that the blond bartendress is very pleasant but that's all I can say about this place. I was here yesterday for Happy Hour and finally ended up leaving drinkless. The bar area is small so it doesn't take much to fill it up and what's so annoying is that if you ask any of the clueless servers if you can sit at the large table they always say ""we're waiting for a large party"" riiiiggghhhht...I was watching one girl argue with a waiter about one of the small tables in the bar as well..why have them there if no one can use them???

4.0,8/4/2011,"Words can't express how much I love this place! Let me start off by saying I was a skeptic. My friend had suggested this place as a brunch option but I was hesitant because there wasn't a flat rate brunch (i.e. entree + unlimited drink option); the deal here is entree + fee for unlimited drinks. I made the concession when she made a good point: there are never enough good vegetarian options at a unlimited brunch and at Barbounia there is, so I figured the extra $$ was worth it. Those who know me, know I like my brunches boozy and cheap, so it was hard to fork over that extra cash on what I thought was the same thing.... I was wrong and ready to admit it! This place is definitely worth the extra $$ (eg. depending on entree & fee + tip it can be $40 and up/person). The first time we arrived with no reservations and an odd # group. We had been told 20 minutes but it was more like 35; however, when they realized they had kinda sorta forgotten about us, the manager (?) came out to apologize, sat us himself, brought us a complimentary basket of bread (usually charge for this, as I found out on the next trip) and came by at appropriate times to make sure everything was good. The waitstaff know what's up and that we're there for the DRANKS! so he made sure our glasses were always filled. The food was largely portioned and quite good and the menu offers a variety of food (not just egg breakfast items), seeing as that we have access to the entire menu, not just a pre-fixe brunch one. My bff is vegan and actually has a choice of food that is good AND filling, so that's a plus as well. Hilarious part was when my friend, who shall remain unnamed, kept ordering refills on our drinks well past paying for our bill AND the closing time of 4pm. They kept giving though and were actually amused by it instead of condescending. 2nd/3rd trips: Made reservations for a large group of 8 (past this number and you get into weird special pricing). They verified our reservation, accommodating to the large group and were ok when the number of people changed and also that we arrived slightly later than planned. The waitstaff, again, AWESOME! Knowledgeable about the food/menu, made great suggestions, constantly kept our glasses filled, extremely friendly and never made a mistake (i.e. forgetting something, overcharging, being inattentive, etc)....at least that I can recall ;) I'm rating this place on overall experiences had here. It's a champagne brunch so Mimosas and Bellinis only (although they make other drinks, just not included in the menu). Their food is pretty tasty and hearty, which serves you well when you realize how many drinks you've consumed....hard to put a number on that, considering your glass is always filled before you empty it. Only docking a star based on the fact that a) the unlimited drink fee is never published and you hate to ask and b) it changed from $10 to $15, again, without any prior disclosure.

Its an after thought in the NYC menus, considering the city has so many vegetarians and fabulous chefs, you would think they would try harder.anyways enough of my rant (sorry!) - what i was getting at was the Mediterranean place didn't have too many options for a vegetarian (there was a lot to choose from in dips, but that does not a dinner make). i had the beet salad, friend had a Greek salad and we shared the tsatziki and the eggplant dip.

3.0,6/8/2011,"Every time I've walked by Barbounia (right on the corner of 20th and Park), the atmosphere has always been bustling and lively, so I finally decided to give it a try with a friend for dinner. The presentation is lovely, the decor is majestic, and the restaurant itself is almost grandiose. The tables are a little close together, but not so close as to be uncomfortable.We ordered three mezzas (eggplant, spicy feta and hummus), as well as three appetizers (iron skillet shrimp, veal sweetbreads, and hummus with pork and quail egg). Our favorites were the roasted eggplant dip and veal sweetbreads. (The veal sweetbread may be more aptly described as a open-faced veal sandwich with falafel bun, but despite the misnomer, its quite tasty.) The shrimp felt like a ripoff - $20 bucks for 6 shrimp with some garlic? Not worth it.While the food is decent, it feels quite overpriced to me. I'm morally opposed to paying $10 bucks for a small bowl of hummus or feta cheese, so not sure if I'll come back here unless its on somebody else's tab. I've heard positive things about the brunch, though, so may yet return for that.",0,0,0,Nils H.,"Denver, CO",40,188,0

2.0,5/30/2011,"I'd walked by this place several times. Always a decent looking crowd. So on a random weeknight three of us stepped in. No reservations. We were seated 15 minutes before the kitchen closed (they let us know). So here's my pet peeve: if you seat me for dinner, shouldn't I have the same experience at 8PM as I would at 10:45?  Not only did the main course rush out of the kitchen while we were in the first few bites of our appetizers, they were also putting up chairs on the tables so they could start mopping the floors. Here comes the best part: food is just ok. And when you qualify it with what you pay for it, it's a C-. ""Iron skillet shrimp with garlic"" for $16.95???  5 or 6 shrimp boiled in oil???  Since the lamb shank ($29.95) made a premature appearance, I asked the waiter to keep it warm so we coud finish our apps. So he set it on the line under a heat lamp for 10 minutes. Knowing that every minute I delayed eating it would impact my experience, I had him bring it over. I should have waited even longer: it was dry, tepid at best and very mediocre.The manager was responsive with sympathy and comped desert (which was very yummy).If you want the scene, great.

I had the baked eggs for my entree and the bread and trio of dips as an appetizer. My favorite was the feta dip.. so good! Also to note is the restroom area.

3.0,5/8/2011,"Came a little while ago for Sunday brunch, we were a party of 6 with a reservation thankfully. I wouldn't think of coming here with a party over 2 without a reservation especially because its all you can drink champagne, bellinis and mimosas from noon to 4pm.Since there were 6 of us we were able to try a bunch of things. First the complimentary basket of mini muffins and chocolate croissants are outstanding. One of the apps we had gotten was the deluxe selection of tappas which were all good except the spicy fetta was incredible. I recommend just getting like 2 orders of that instead and the bread that comes with it was delicious perfection. We had also gotten the Greek fondue which was basically cheese in a small cast iron skillet that was thrown in a broiler but that metaxa brandy...ooooo weeee gives it some nice flavor! (if i remember correctly it come to the table on fire!!!)Now when it comes to the entrees aside from mine is where the stars were lost. First I had ordered the Croque Monsieur which was so rich that you felt that you need to walk it off or hit the gym after but can only mean one thing...it was DAMN good! Now I got to try most of my friends dishes and  I gotta say they were just average. Unfortunately I don't remember all of their dishes but I do remember the crab benedict and the Turkish eggs they were a huge disappointment, I was so glad I didn't go with either of those.For dessert we had gotten the Silan which was really good, different but good and espressos all around.Overall I think this is a great place, the atmosphere is nice and would come back again.

We got the grilled octopus to start, which was surprisingly good (I really am not an octopus fan, but the texture of this was not chewy at all!).I ordered the bluefin tuna for my entree, which was oh-so-good with the mashed potatoes, crispy onions, and mushrooms.

I have to say, I stand humbly corrected about my previous review. I had an AMAZING brunch, and it honestly makes me happy to write an updated review of Barbounia. We got a few different things to share, and everything was delicious. The granola with greek yogurt and fresh fruit and honey was delectable yet fresh; the green eggs shakshuka---baked eggs in a skilled with creamed spinach--were sooo freakin good; a simple yet tasty traditional greek salad with a big hunk of tangy feta; an egg-white mushroom spinach and goat cheese omelet, which came out a bit soggy, but it was forgivable; and the french toast, which was very fluffy and light, and came presented beautifully with sides of butter, syrup, and macerated blueberries. We also ordered a second bread basket (with extra blueberry muffins and chocolate croissants, which the waiter nicely indulged us with).Of course we got the bottomless bellinis, and even after we closed our tab at the table they let us keep drinking at the bar for almost another hour (it was a rainy Saturday, so what else were we gonna do but stay inside and drink all day??). It just goes to show you that even a great restaurant can have a bad day (or simply bad dishes) and that also you as the reviewer can have a bad day and write a bad review.

We started off ordering several appetizers for the table and a bottle of French Chardonnay which was great! They had a very good selection of wines. For appetizers we ordered, the crispy calamari, hummus, red snapper ceviche, and the iron skillet shrimp. They were all out of this world to the point that we thought about just ordering more appetizers for our main courses. We decided to all pick something different for our main courses and we passed them around the table and shared.

The atmosphere is great, very nice decor and good seating. To start the meal off we had the hummus platter which was amazing and served with a really nice, warm fresh flat bread. We also had the sweet cauliflower which was roasted and came in a really nice green tahini and pine nuts, we had the shrimp which was just your typical app nothing special. We then had the Chopped salad which was also delicious but nothing extremely special. We had the pizza of the day, which was arugula, mozz and prosciutto, I feel bad that its only a special because this was the most amazing pizza ever with a nice thin crust! Moving along to the entrees, we had the Idaho potato gnocchi, the mushrooms in this were my favorite, if you like gnocchi I highly suggest it. My favorite entree was the Scallop and Pumpkin risotto. I was a little turned off at first by the sound of it, but the minute I got some on my plate and tried it, I didn't want to pass it along to the rest of the group! We also got the Marinated free range chicken, which I didn't try but tried the marinate it was and it was pretty tasty. We also got sides of broccoli rabe and grilled asparagus, both were really good and I would highly recommend them. And to top it off, dessert we had the Silan, which was a very simple dessert and you would think rice krispy's but oh my, it was delicious, I could go for some of it right now!! We also had the Malabi, which was not good at all, it reminded all of us of perfume, and then we had the chocolate lava cake which is your standard chocolate cake dessert but of course very good.

2.0,2/23/2011,"What a beautiful dining room--decorated in reds and creams, with high ceilings and festooned with floating spheres. Based on looks alone, Barbounia hit it out of the park.Unfortunately, we did not go to Barbounia to admire  its decor but rather to brunch, and in that, the restaurant fell short. They informed us of the endless mimosa and champagne special. I asked if they had Bloody Marys, and was curtly informed those were not included in the endless drink special. I had assumed that, and was asking if they were available for me to order one a la carte. I thought it was handled a bit brusquely. The Bloody Mary I ordered was tasty but small.The menu offered about fifteen dishes with poached or soft-cooked eggs, which I don't like. Rather than special order, I opted for a burger cooked medium rare. When it arrived, it was closer to well-done, though I opted to eat it. Even if it had been properly cooked, the burger would have been unremarkable, even bland. The green salad accompaniment was tasty; the pickles were inedible (as my husband also discovered when he tried to swipe them off my plate toward the close of the meal). My husband thought his sausage omelet was ok, and our friend's eggs Benedict also looked pretty good (if you like poached eggs). One of our friends ordered the granola which actually looked incredible. It was a huge bowl of granola studded with chunks of fresh fruit. He wasn't able to finish.Barbounia really fell down on the service. We waited a long time between each interaction with the wait staff (greeting, water being served, ordering drinks, ordering food, receiving drinks, receiving food, having table cleared, getting check, paying check). In particular, we waited about 25 minutes between having the table cleared and receiving our check. We finally had to wave a waiter over to ask for it. I appreciate that we weren't rushed, but this was a bit too far on the other side of that balance.Although I wouldn't rush to a second brunch at Barbounia, I would try them for dinner based on the menu and the decor. I think I may have made an error choosing food outside their Mediterranean specialties.

The artichoke hearts were kind of tough to eat and the whole dish just tasted bland. I enjoyed the side of potatoes more than the frittata itself. The service was attentive; our waitress made sure to keep our flutes filled with bubbly goodness, and in the end that is all that mattered to me.",0,1,0,Tori N.,"Staten Island, NY",35,81,66
2.0,2/19/2011,"A vibrant Mediterranean brunch spot with endless champagne specials - this is the kind of place that makes you feel grateful to be alive in New York.  It reminded me of my first year here, excited to see and be scene, uplifted by the buoyousness of city life, and gave justification for moving 2,500 miles across the country for experiences to come. So it was only appropriate I would collect on a belated birthday treat here with one of the first girlfriends I met (and graciously manifested relationships) in New York. We indulged in the steak and eggs, asparagus mushroom white cheese pizza and saved the best for last.. a decadent valrhona chocolate cake - parline crust, preserved cherries & turkish coffee ice cream. If I'm ever back there again, although unlikely considering how many other endless champagne brunch places there are, I'd explore with their more authentic twist dishes. And as a vanity room lover, I adored their blue tiled restrooms. I also have to say, five years later, I don't mind paying by the glass or bottle if the champagne is sumptuous and prefer to keep endless friendships that are worth lasting. Life's too short for the lesser of either.",1,1,0,Maly L.,"Manhattan, NY",247,95,779

Relatively high ceiling and roomy tables.As for the food, steak (mine), burger and sandwich (my friends') are all  decent but not so memorable nor superb. The biggest minus here is the price.

I began my meal with warm, frothy cafe latte.Handmade bread topped with sea salt crystals and herbs arrived to whet our pre-entree appetite.Croque madame: Gooey gruyere cheese, bechamel sauce, and salty strips of ham were sandwiched between two thick slices of buttery-toasted brioche - all before being topped with two sunny-side-up eggs.

Swore I'd NEVER become a part of Yelp but, because I own my own business and because some (albeit far from all) yelpers generally tend to be overly picky, rather snobby, and, frankly, a bit of a pain in the a** .(Sorry, but it's seems to be true, especially if you ever read the spot on article about Yelp in Inc magazine.) Owning a business to business corporation rather than a business to consumer company makes me REALLY happy after seeing what a handful of people on Yelp can do to an (ideally) well meaning entrepreneur. Anyway. . .putting my distaste for Yelp aside. . and very well aware of the fact that this will probably be my ONLY review here, I wanted to make sure (someone) sees this from the restaurant. . ..as well as other Yelpers that have good intentions and aren't just out there writing to ruin people for the sake of ruining people and seeing their name in ""print.""Forget the area. If you are overly concerned about dining in a ""hip"" or ""trendy"" area, you're a pretentious snob. Go home and leave the rest of us alone. However, if you want great food, great service in a funky atmosphere with all kinds of pillows on the couch to make it extra comfy. . .come here. Three people. Saturday night. Prime time. No reservations. Got seated in less than 5 minutes. (And again, if you're the type that automatically is thinking, ""Well how good can it be because you got seated at prime time on a Saturday and didn't have to wait. . . . . ."" See above. And go home.) Great bottle of  California Pinot Noir. No pressure to upsell to anything else. Incredible, fresh baked, complementary bread with olives. Really sweet, high end olive oil as well.I had perhaps one of  the best lamb dishes I've ever tasted.  Lamb teracotta. It was was cooked in the dish with the bread around it. SO good. My two dining companions had the hangar steak and the pumpkin risotto.  Steak? Here? I thought. . .how could could it be? Suffice to say. . . .I was very pleasantly surprised. So was he! Not a place where you'd think the steak would be all that great. It really was! All three dishes were well prepared, fresh, and absolutely fantastic. If presentation matters to you. . .that was very well done as well. Absolutely nothing was left on (any) plate. Two of us are born and raised New Yorkers. R and P moved out to Cali and I'm still here. My friends are both rather picky about their food. She's European and fantastic, but won't hesitate to say if she's not enjoying something.  She LOVED it! As did he and I. Had two desserts. The Silan was off the charts delicious. Wish we ordered two for the table. To anyone actually paying attention to this review, be assured I don't give a top rating (to anything) lightly. But on this night. . .they absolutely deserved it. . and it really made for a wonderful ""catch-up-because-we-haven't-seen-each-other-in-too-long-a-time"" sort of night. And this is the type of party that restaurant owners kill for. . .and they scored. So, while I hope this helps other Yelpers in their decision, I hope more so that the owner of the place sees the following: ""From one business owner to another, 'Thank you, and well done.'"" Back to the consumer: Forget any other bad review you may have seen here. We're all in our 40's. Keep the pretentious foodies and their nonsense. (I have friends who are like this and I give them sh** for it all the time because lets face it, they're annoying!) This place is NOT cheap. Far from it.

4.0,10/25/2010,"I went here over the weekend with my mom and roommate - my mom was visiting me in the city and I wanted to take her somewhere nice, and based on all the positive reviews, I chose this place. I should also note that my entire family is Greek, so when we go to a Mediterranean restaurant, we have very high expectations! I had made a reservation earlier that week for 8:15 pm, and called the same day to confirm. We were a bit delayed in getting to the restaurant, so I called them at exactly 8:15 to let them know we were going to be late, and to please hold our table - which they very graciously said would be no problem. But when we arrived 15 minutes later, they seemed to have trouble finding our reservation in their system - and they asked us to wait in the bar for 5 minutes. Ten minutes later when we asked for the status of our table, the hostess and maitre'd pretty much brushed us off. Enter Angry Mom, who argued with the maitre'd about what was happening (we called to ask them to hold the table and they didn't, etc etc) and finally, we were seated. Though we were a bit frustrated by all this, I have to say that the owner, David, more than made up for the hiccup. We received complimentary champagne and an appetizer sampler on the house, as an apology - both of which were absolutely delicious. The sampler included an array of traditional cheese spreads: tzatsiki (garlic cucumber yogurt), taramosalata, melitsanosalata (roasted eggplant), and tirokafteri (spicy feta). We all particularly enjoyed the taramosalata (fish roe spread), which was expertly prepared, and the accompanying bread was amazing! We also ordered the grilled octopus appetizer, and I honestly have to say this was the BEST octopus I have ever eaten. Octopus can sometimes be a tough meat, but this stuff was flavorful, fresh and fall-apart-in-your-mouth tender. DO NOT skip this if you eat here! For entrees, we all ordered the signature branzino dish, which was very delicious, but the highlight of the dinner was truly the delectable appetizer assortment. For dessert, we tried the  Kanafeh, which is similar to the Greek kataifi (a version of baklava with shredded phyllo dough) with the addition of sweet goat cheese - also delicious and the perfect end to the meal. Despite the unfortunate reservation issue when we arrived, Barbounia handled us very professionally and really turned around my initial impression of the place. The food was delicious, and the service was impeccable. Though we didn't spend much time in the bar area, it seemed pretty lively, and a lot of cute Gramercy professionals were milling about.

3.0,7/14/2010,"I went here last summer for dinner for Restaurant Week. Barbounia was near my (awful) internship at the time in Union Square so I opted for a restaurant that was nearby to go to with my Aunt. Upon walking in, you notice the beautiful, Mediterranean inspired decor with high ceilings with arches. The joint was loud and lively, always a good thing unless you're old and like quiet places. The food was good, not great or truly memorable but might have been that way for RW. Some restaurants do not take full advantage of the opportunity RW provides and that is introducing their establishment to new customers with food that is equal to their normal menu items. There is also the chance I just ordered the wrong thing...Barbounia definitely has potential and I would love to go back to order from their main stream menu. I love Mediterranean food!

5.0,7/1/2010,"Yep, its official. My favorite unlimited champagne brunch spot. I have been so many damn times and am almost embarrassed with myself for not writing a review. There are a few things that go into a perfect weekend brunch in NYC, and here they are:1. Unlimited champagne, and or, brunch cocktails. They have them, they are delicious and don't make you want to bang your head against a wall a few hours later, and they refill them with a quickness. Key.2. Good food. You often times trade the solid food, and amount of choices, for the unlimited drinks, which I feel is a true crime. At Barbounia, the food stands alone. The breakfasty people can be traditional with eggs bene, the omelets, french toast, etc or get adventurous with the hearty and super delicious Moroccan or Turkish eggs. Their steak and eggs is ammmmmazing. The lunchy people can do delish pizzas, falafel sandwichs, lovely salads, etc. They give you this super yummy Cosi style bread to start, and everything is super fresh.3. Nice ambiance. I like to drink in access during the day at lively airy places. I don't like to be squished next to the person beside me as I probably won't want them hearing my convo, and even if I am not outside, I would like to at least get a peek of the sunshine outside. Barbounia is a nice mixed crowd. Not raucous by any means, but not a place where I feel like I am surrounded by children and their parents, staring....judging.I took my mom and best friends here for brunch when she was in town from LA and she loved it.

5.0,1/29/2010,"Just went for Restaurant Week and have to say this was one of my best meals ever. Their yummy flat bread arrived piping hot and with a side of olives. I had to force myself to stop munching on the bread so that I wouldn't fill up before the appetizer arrived. I started off with their mushroom gnocchi (my first but not my last time having gnocchi) which tasted so delicate and like little pillows of clouds. I was super happy that it was a healthy portion and not a skimpy plate. Then I had their sea bass on top of a bed of lentils and spinach. The sea bass had an ultra crisp skin. It was heavenly! And last but not least I finished with Silan Honey which was a serving of milk ice cream topped with a crunchy nut and rice crispy brittle as well as shredded halva which had an amazing nougat taste to it and reminded me of Chinese Dragon's Beard candy. They definitely have me sold and I will be returning post-Restaurant Week. On top of the good food, the staff was extremely attentive. Loved the décor - the numerous white candles and the bushels of apples near the front door.",0,0,0,Wendy W.,"New York, NY",3,150,14
1.0,1/21/2010,"I went here tonight with my best friend to celebrate our birthdays. I had a reservation at 7:15 and arrived at 7:23. When I went up to the hostess, she very rudely told me that she had given the table to another customer. Now, I don't know if this is because my friend and I are alot younger than the normal crowd here, but she seemed extremely pretentious. That, and 8 minutes late is not a proper reason to give up a person's table. I would understand if I was 15 or 20 minutes late, but this was ridiculous. I had train trouble, and now because of it, I had to wait another 20 minutes for a table. When the hostess seated us, she was very pretentious once again and rude to my friend and I. Our waiter, however, was a relief. He was very kind. At times he seemed a little bit flustered by the large crowd, but he was very consistent. On to the food: Appetizers: I had the beef carpaccio, and my friend had the greek fondue. The carpaccio was horrible. There was an overwhelming taste of vinaigrette, and the nuts were either stale or just too hard. I would give it a 1/5. My friend had the greek fondue, which turned out to be pretty good. The taste of wine was a bit strong, but besides that, it was very tasty. Nothing spectacular, but good. 3/5. Entree: I had the pumpkin risotto and my friend had the mushroom gnocchi. My risotto was very well flavored, and the scallops were cooked perfectly. However, I must say they were under-seasoned as I felt myself reaching for the salt again and again. 3/5.  My friend's mushroom gnocchi was rich and earthy. Very delicious. 4/5. Dessert: We shared both the chocolate fondant and the vanilla panna cotta. The chocolate fondant was too overwhelming, and the coffee ice cream that went with it detracted from the chocolate flavor instead of adding to it. 2/5. The vanilla panna cotta was AMAZING. it was so delicious, and I feel as if it was the highlight of the night. I would gladly eat more If I could. 5/5. The bill with tax and tip came out to be about $120 which isn't bad for the kind of setting. The ambience of the restaurant is fantastic and cozy. I love that you can see into the kitchen. However, the food was just not up to par at all, and very disappointing. For around $120, I could've spent a lifetime on itunes, or better. The hostess' attitude was something to be forgotten. I wouldn't recommend anyone who looks young coming here. Maybe it was just first impressions, but because of the hostess, my friend and I felt targeted the rest of the night and couldn't enjoy our meal as we should have.",2,0,1,Jessica Y.,"Manhattan, NY",99,108,130

But after tonight's dinner, I probably won't be back.We were seated pretty much on top of other diners, but I guess you should know to expect that ahead of time. But what was really frustrating was our waitress, who was very inattentive. First of all, she did not offer to tell us the specials, which she told to everyone she seated around us. Secondly, when it came to paying the check, not only was it impossible to get her attention (mind you, she was not busy running around to other customers, but rather standing and staring at the crowded space), but when she brought the check back, there was no pen and no credit card. Turns out she'd dropped my credit card on the floor near the register, so she had to go back to get it after I asked, and I had to dig out my own pen to sign the receipt for fear of waiting for her for another 15 minutes.For a place that charges this much, it really needs to work on reducing the snootiness of its staff.",1,1,0,Olga Z.,"Forest Hills, NY",2,34,0

4.0,12/14/2009,"Beautiful restaurant and really good service but one star off for being so darn expensive and putting the tables so close together. At $30+ for entrees the food better wow me, but it was just good, not wow good. I did really enjoy the flat bread, which always poses the danger of over-eating before your main dish arrives, so eat at your own risk. I wish I could apologize to the servers for the company I was with, specifically the British girl with a serious attitude problem. She would do things like tap a bus boy on the shoulder and say ""excuse me are you a waiter I want to put in an order"" or call another waiter over to  rudely demand that he turn up the air conditioning because she's feeling too hot. Ugh where do I find these people? Service cannot possibly be better in London. Anyway, I thought the service was amazing, they kept up with almost all her demands, which proceeded throughout the dinner.The decor of the place is lovely too. It's a big space and you can see the chefs preparing the meals in the kitchen. They have a modern unisex bathroom and nice mood lighting. As mentioned in the beginning I just wish they didn't try to cram so many tables into the place. It caused another woman to tip over a glass from our table as she was sliding into the seats at her table. The glass shattered and some moisture may have gotten on the Brit who then proceeded to bemoan this new catastrophe.

The bread basket is great, I was able to snag some kind of pumpkin mini muffin that was awesome. I ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict and they were probably the best I've had in the city.

Last time I went, my dining companion got the sea bass which was a wimpy portion but he declared it fantastic nonetheless. They also have really great falafel offered at lunch.

The service was terrible. it took 35 minutes to get our first drink. We had to flag down the waitress for everything. we asked for more bread we never got it. For $80 per person, we shoudl be getting outstanding service and this was AWFUL. food was ok - i have nothing specifically bad to say about it - but i was sooo turned off by the poor service that it made my meal so much less enjoyable. They have a really pretty bathroom but it is sooo dark you can hardly see yourself in mirror.. I will never return there and only gave it 2 stars because it is pretty.",2,0,1,Sandy T.,"New York, NY",0,2,0
4.0,5/10/2009,I recently went here for a dinner for my birthday that my boyfriend treated me to.  The bread and olives they serve before the meal were delicious but when I asked for more they told us they had to charge us!  We paid extra but couldn't help but feeling a bit rushed with our meal.  Overall the food was yummy and the ambiance was very romantic.  I would like to try this restaurant for lunch though.,1,0,0,Kimberly L.,"San Francisco, CA",816,852,812

4.0,5/3/2009,"This Greek and Mediterranean restaurant is GORGEOUS inside. I've always been intrigued as I walked by the restaurant from outside and the inside does not disappoint. The high ceilings, the fully stocked bar, the large mirrors and the unique unisex bathrooms are a treat to behold. We sat by the window and leisurely took our brunch for 1.5 hours. We ordered the following:1 French toast w/blueberry jam - VERY buttery and fluffy two thick slices, with cream and honey on the side2. Calzone w/feta cheese and Swiss chard3. Falafel sandwich - really a giant Indian naan type bread wrapped around three fat falafel w/yogurt sauce and cubed tomatoes and onions inside4. Also a Greek scrambled egg dishALL were absolutely yummy and the portions were HUGE! The food was presented on lovely apparatuses, like on wooden boards or little iron kettle style pots. The presentation is already enough for us to salivate over the food. We did not get the desserts, although I will certainly come back to try for dinner. Prices were very reasonable for brunch but for dinner I imagine it will  be more expensive.I cannot emphasize enough how beautiful the decor is inside - I can totally see anyone holding a wedding reception or a formal event inside. The ambience is elegant without being stuffy, and wonderfully cozy at the same time. I was soooo very undressed (practically in my gym clothing!) and definitely will put on a dress and a pair of heels when I come out next time. *blush*",1,1,1,Vanessa X.,"Chicago, IL",169,487,0

If you're looking for somewhere to get that will be pretty, and where you don't care too much about the food, then this is fine. The high ceilings and dim lighting makes for a beautiful atmoshpere. But what I hate is that it's 1) expensive, 2) for food much less tasty and authentic than anywhere one could go in Astoria. I got the Tzaziki (fine, you can't mess up yogurt...), and Chicken Kebabs.

The fresh baked bread they served along side was delicious! ...

They worked around eating restrictions as well. They accommodated all ahem 40 of us between 1PM and 4PM on Sunday afternoon. Everyone was stuffed for the day. There was no pressure to leave.

4.0,2/22/2009,"There are few places in the city that offer Bronzino and Broccoli Rabe, and to find one that does both, and does them well, is a treat. For those of you out of the know, I'll enlighten you: Bronzino is a mild fish, native mostly to the Adriatic and Mediterranean. It is served whole -- normally, this presentation terrifies me, but if you're a carnivore, seeing meat as it once appeared and not in neat little cutlets is the noble thing to do. Plus, you get all the crispy, healthy skin goodness. Barbounia treated this ""king of the sea"" royally -- not drowning it in sauce, but using rosemary, garlic, and olive oil to accentuate the flavor. The halibut was less impressive, as any flavor of the fish was drowned in sauce, albeit a delicious pepper-tomato affair. And the broccoli rabe...wow, cooked perfectly in garlic and oil -- its perfection enticed us into ordering a second serving. We also had the sardine appetizer, which was beautiful. Somehow, it ended up  being a fish Friday, a practice that went out of style with Vatican II, but left us feeling happy and sated. I deducted a star for the coat check person nearly losing my friend's hat, and appearing nonchalant about finding it. We had to go back and look ourselves, and we did unearth it, slightly dented and creased. Granted, it was a busy night and I know they were overwhelmed, but to not offer an apology marred an otherwise stellar dining experience.",2,2,2,Suzanne R.,"San Francisco, CA",589,409,7

I had the french toast...the bread was dark...probably pumperknickle and quite crisp....not soggy at all, I guess they used the perfect amount of eggs. I did eat the whole thing. The waiters were friendly but were not quite on the ball....I had to ask twice for a refill of water..but that's about it.

2.0,2/1/2009,"This review is for Restaurant Week only. I was pretty disappointed by this place- I had heard really good things beforehand, but it was one of my least favorite meals out. Ever. And I'm not too picky when it comes to restaurants.On the plus side, the cocktails were tasty. I had some type of champagne cocktail that was delish, if a bit too sweet. The bread was also super yummy, as was my appetizer, which was... umm, apparently not that memorable because I can't even remember what it was. I just know that it was the best part of the Restaurant Week three-course prix fixe.I was thoroughly unimpressed by my entree, which was supposed to be a fish kebab of some sort but was more like fish sticks on a plate with some other stuff. And my dessert, which was a custard type of deal with a fruity sauce, was so not delicious that I didn't even finish it. Which is saying A LOT. It was completely devoid of flavor.Service was nothing special. Our waitress didn't speak loud enough to overcome the deafening sound level and, while she was always in sight, just wasn't very intuitive.Also, as my dear dining companion Lauren C. wrote, the portions were TINY. Luckily I had filled up on bread. The regular menu must be better, from what I've heard, but I wouldn't come back after this experience.

4.0,1/31/2009,"I agree the entrees are hit-or-miss.  But everything else was fantastic.They serve you this spectacular fresh-baked bread with a dish of succulent olives soaked in olive oil.  The crust on the bread is a little oily (brushed with oils and sprinkled with herbs).  It's a hot mess.  Enjoy it.For starters, my friend and I both got the grilled octopus.  Very tender octopus with a tiny bit of char over some tangy, creamy labneh.  Highly recommended.I got the citrus-marinated salmon filet for my entree and thought it was a little overcooked (chef suggests medium, I suggest asking for medium rare) and generally devoid of personality.  It's like, hi, here's a slab of bored salmon.  The lamb kebab entree was quite good, though.  Very juicy, well-seasoned meat.My dessert was a chocolate mousse with strawberry sauce.  Chocolate mousse was pretty good, but the strawberry preserves on top didn't totally make sense.  My buddy's Silan, ice cream topped with what tasted like shredded Halva candy, was good.  I'm going to start doing that at home.They ask for a credit card if you reserve through OpenTable.  Kind of annoying considering I've never seen a full house here.  You could walk in during lunch hours and get seated without a problem.A decent pick for Restaurant Week.",2,0,1,Diana Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",426,568,355

I've had better fish in deli's for lunch.Also, even though we were seated pretty well inside the restaurant.

So we took the 6:30 and arrived and it was pretty dead. We were there through 7:30 and non one else really came in so that was a bit annoying.The waiter we had was a bit pushy. He told us the tzaki was very small and that we should order more appetizers. My friend also only wanted a salad and he told her it was small and to order a side plate. When the tzaki came out it was like 10 pieces of small bread and a large dip so we were confused.  They came over halfway through when we were eating and asked if we were done because the entrees were cooked.Then he brought out our entrees- I had mussels (good) and she had salmon- the girl with the salad got hers and it was quite enough then he brought out the side plate and it turned out to be too much food. Our waiter stood like 2 feet aside and kept staring at us.Once we had put the forks down they immediately cleaned everything up and seemed like they were in a rush.

WAY too much ground up lamb and not enough eggplant and potatoes.

It came baked in a dish, and by the time I'd eaten maybe 1/3 of it and could see the bottom of the dish, there was a noticeable pool of oil forming at the bottom. That was sort of offputting. Otherwise the dish was fine.This place is exactly at a Yelp 3-star. It's A-OK but I don't know if I would return.

They actually sat us around this large elevated wooden rectangular table so it made it relatively hard to talk to everyone. However, the seating for two had couches against the wall so I'm sure that would work out better for a small party.In terms of the food, we ordered a 3-dip plate in addition to their restaurant week menu. I was very impressed with their dips, particularly the eggplant one. Normally I hate anything eggplant but it was my favorite one! From their restaurant week menu I got their salad and lamb, which turned out better than I thought; I typically don't like lamb either but I figured it was worth a try to see if they can prepare it well...and they did! For dessert, they only had one option for restaurant week (which is the only disappointment) - creme brulee. It was prepared well, but I would recommended getting their molten chocolate cake. Someone ordered it, and it was delicious! It comes with mint ice cream and well-decorated. Very good.Overall, pretty great place to have a nice long dinner.

I had a very girlie, but very strong cocktail as I waited, and was checked on (but not in an annoying way) a couple of times by the waitstaff. The menu was unusual and appealing and I tried things I wouldn't normally order...I figure, during restaurant week it's the perfect time to branch out a bit.  All 3 of us loved our apps, entree, dessert and the delicious flat bread and olives they kept bringing. The service was gracious, knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. The atmosphere, while a little loud, was open and airy and very tasteful.

3.0,1/24/2008,"Day two of restaurant week  (and i'm getting a little bit tired of food)The ambience definetly makes you feel like you're home. The comfy chaise i was sitting on also helped.. Food wise, we decided to order a la carte as there was nothing (other than the spicy seared tuna) that looked appetizing to me. For starters, we ordered the three spreads - tetziki, roasted eggplant, and the hummus. Comparing this to Avra (my default Greek restaurant), the spreads were too small and didn't taste as distinctive. Best was the hummus hands down.  However, the bread that came with this was drizzled with oil and seasonings mmmFor my entree, i got the snapper which was really good for the first few mouthfuls. afterwards, it became WAY too salty. i think it was the tomatoe sauce that overwhelmed me. my friend enjoyed her mosaka but it had so much stuff in it that she had a hard time finishing. For dessert, we had molten choclate cake, the dough balls and the pumpkin cake with cinnamon.  Pumpkin cake won hands down! However, i was tempted to try the forest berry tea instead... Food alone - this place would've been a three star but the service was excellent despite the fact that we were neglected the first forty minutes after apps were served.  The chef came out to apologize for the delay and we were given fries ( YUM! perfectly seasoned), spinach, and deserts on the house. Water was refilled constantly (also nice).All in all it was a nice evening though verrryy long. The dinner was close to three hours !UPDATE:taking back a star - service was miserable the second time around for LUNCH. seriously? it wasn't even crowded! things we didn't order was sent to the table and things we did order never showed up.

The service was mediocre at best (although our water boys were excellent in constantly refilling our glasses), but the food more than made up for it. The toasted raisin bread that we got as a starter was warm and sweet. The Herbed Mushroom Omelette I ordered with caramelized onions was fantastic. The goat cheese was doled out in the perfect amount--it didn't overpower the omelette. The egg was a perfect consistency and density, whipped, light fluffy. The mushrooms were really great, too. I think it's really easy to either under cook mushrooms in an omelette making them tough and chewy or over cook them in butter making them thin, greasy and flimsy. But these were perfectly cooked. You could really taste the herbs in the omelette and the green little flecks on the exterior of the omelette made it look pretty (for lack of a better word). The caramelized onions were sweet and perfect. It came with a little side of fruit salad, a tasty piece of buttery bread with feta chunks in it, and the most delicious home fries. They also had caramelized onions and were cooked in a really good tomato-based  sauce. To drink we all had the ""Olympia"" cocktail, it's smashed strawberries, cinzano bianco, lemon, mathilde peach, champagne. Amazing. I would love to go back to try some of the more interesting items on the menu. The menu was so interesting. I'd never had Greek/Mediterranean brunch before so I was curious about a lot of things on the menu. I played it safe with the omelette because  because I was hungry, I knew it would be hearty and I needed something to tide me over before I hoped on a plane back to SF for 6 hours.We were going to have the fig baklava for dessert but, alas, they were out.

Our mains were the lamb chops (which were juicy and tender - but the slight charring on the outside overpowered the flavor of the lamb) and the halibut wrapped in grape leaves (quite soft and fleshy - but served in a oddly sour foam). Finally, even though we were sufficiently stuffed, we took on the trio of creme brulee and molton chocolate cake, which were both expectedly delicious.The decor is lovely... lofty ceilings, cushy seating and semi-open kitchen bring the warmth of the Mediterranean to stupid Park South.",1,1,1,Erica Jade L.,"New York, NY",26,262,1
4.0,2/28/2007,"Barbounia is nothing if not beautiful -  a friend suggested we eat here and i was shocked when I showed up and saw the place. High ceilings, gorgeous open kitchen, amazing bar display, fun blue tiled bathroom. My salmon and veggies were fresh and delicious. It was pricey - we each had a cocktail, an appetizer, and shared a dessert and the bill was around 80 bucks. But, the sexy, fancy atmosphere was worth more than my local falafel joint. It would be a good choice to take someone you wanted to impress, or to meet a date....",1,0,1,Maggie M.,"Austin, TX",18,41,0
4.0,2/22/2007,"Barbounia has to be one of the most chic Greek places in Manhattan, with some of the best seafood to boot. The food was quite good and the interior ambiance while crowded, was adorned with some of the finest decor one might find from the bathrooms to the funky ceiling drapes. Like the decor, the food presentation is well done despite the limited portions given the hefty price tags.  Yet this place is crowded all the time and big groups are best to make reservations ahead of time if they want to avoid the wait. Service hasn't always been on par but they do the job depending on where your seating is. Best recommended for brunch and small group dinners.",1,0,1,Jando S.,"Queens, NY",2723,3529,17072
4.0,1/21/2007,Think Greek?I had no idea that this place was Greek!! When my cell phone battery died one fine evening I was stranded in Grammercy with no hope of reaching my friends... alone and scared *laughs... yea... right*  Wandering through this majestic place to find my way to the ever so friendly bar.  I realized that not only could one comfortably dine here alone the drinks were exception and the food was quite tasty.  Granted I only had the chicken but to be perfectly honest -- no complaints!  Date Rating: 8Pick up Scale: 5 (8 if you're a chick on a work night and you go to the bar)Strong Suggestions: It's actually Greek!! Go here and try something Greek and let me know if it's good.,1,0,3,Megan C.,"New York, NY",4019,835,1062
4.0,12/19/2006,"Im a pretty big fan of this place. I go here a lot for lunch as its only a few blocks from my office. If you like good greek food, souvlaki, crab brioch or a grilled paprika spiced salmon to die for than this may be your next IT spot.",3,0,1,T N.,"Shelter Island, NY",33,251,0
3.0,9/12/2006,Lovely romantic atomosphere.  Entrees were ok.  Enjoyed more of the appetizers and dips and boards! saganaki was yum :) still would not compare to Greek food in Queens!,1,0,1,Lily S.,"Bronx, NY",43,227,20
4.0,8/17/2006,"Great menu with a few selections for vegetarians as well.  We tried a little of everything from the fantastic Greek salad, charred octopus confit was real nice.We had a ""gin sitras"" cocktail before dinner, which was very refreshing, with some strands of grapefruit pulp.For our main course, we had the lemon-rosemary chicken (which was excellent for a chicken dish!) as well as the risotto (veggie) and a gnocchi w/ braised fennel, sweet sausage and one more ingredient i can't remember - but that was my favorite.The wines were excellent.  Our host asked for a wine from Santorini, which was delicious with our food;  the waiter described it as more earthy.  We had another, sweeter white afterwards that was also great.The staff provided free dessert for our guest of honor whose birthday it was.  Thankfully he's dieting and we all scarfed down a great chocoloate cake with ice cream.The space itself reminds me of the types of restaurants you see in movies/tv shows, particularly at nite.  Good place for a party of 4 or more.  But not sure I'd recommend it for couples.",1,0,1,akhill c.,"New York, NY",182,5,0
4.0,7/21/2006,"Tried this place out for restaurant week and I liked what I had. The decor of this place is beautiful. Arched pillars and soft mood lighting with lots of pillows in the booth areas. They did a lot better with the space then the restaurant that occupied it before. And the restrooms are a beautiful suprise. I totally loved them.The food is great too. My boyfriend and I each ordered off of the restaurant week menu. I loved everything I got, but my boyfriend not impressed by some of his entrees. (he lived in astoria for a couple years so he has had really Greek food and kept comparing it to that.) Overall, we recommend the figs wrapped in bacon (who knew?!?), the cripsy snapper (buttery, lemony, and herbs) and the chocolate bread pudding. Jesse thought the sagnaggi was okay, but I liked it. And we both thought the lemon chicken was kinda boring and flavorless. The sides of lemon potatoes and kobe broccoli were much better then the chicken.Inspite of the chicken, I would definately go back. Happy to have another nice restaurant addition to that neighborhood.",0,0,0,kirsten s.,"Jackson Heights, NY",17,32,1
4.0,7/18/2006,"Kind of like eating in some sort of underwater mediterranean fantasy.  The decor here is absolutely beautiful: high arched ceilings, fat temple columns, and some sort of sparkly, fanned, chandelier. All lovely.  I ate entirely off the restaurant week menu which was delicious.  Flavorful and tasty Greek-inspired, pan-mediterranean food. I had the saganaki (VERY delicious), the skirt stake (tender and yummy), and the chocolate bread pudding (excellent).  Lost a star for inattentive service and not having a vegetarian option on the restaurant week menu, but overall recommended for nice, not too pricey eats in a lovely environment.  Oh, and don't miss the bathrooms!",1,0,1,Sam P.,"New York, NY",1869,875,636
5.0,7/12/2006,"Occasion: Restaurant Week DinnerFood: Had Saganaki (walnut bread with grapes, apple, orange, fig dip and sizzling cheese dip- EXCELLENT!), roasted chicken (average). My friends had the dates wrapped in bacon (yum!), skirt steak, crispy snapper, halibut, and lamb chops. Both fish were too dry for my taste. The lamb chop is very tender and flavorful! For dessert, definitely try the chocolate bread pudding!! I also got a Sappho cocktail, which was made of muddled grape, blueberry, red wine, and stoli. it was weird tasting at first, but got better along the way! My friend had the Olympia which was very light and refreshing!Atmosphere: The place is gorgeous! decorated in med-inspired theme, chilled but elegant. the only problem was the noise level... a bit too loud for a quiet conversation, so might not be a good date place on a weekend night. The service was attentive and good! Our waiter insisted on us knowing his name, and we certainly did!Overall: Highly Recommended.",1,0,1,Daisy L.,"New York, NY",2,29,0
4.0,6/2/2006,"I've been to Barbounia 4 times now. The first was a late night... we walked in at 11:30... they kept the kitchen open for us long enough to get our order in. Real good wine selection. Awesome layout. Friendly and attentive service (be careful when ordering extra bread.. apparently they make it ""fresh"" so it takes longer that expected to arrive... but its worth the wait). As for food... lets just say that I've enjoyed the food more and more with each subsequent visit. They have improved the menu over the past few months. On a cool summer night... with the doors wide open... what an experience!! Prices are good so its not a wallet killer. I plan to return in the near future.",0,0,0,Hector L.,"Redmond, WA",42,82,30
3.0,2/9/2006,"The first thing that has to be said about Barbounia is that it is gorgeous.  There are high, arched ceilings, beautiful winged chandeliers, an open kitchen and an attractive,  long gleaming bar.  The benches along the walls are covered in soft, comfortable pillows (why on this night do we recline?  Because we're at Barbounia).  It is a feast for the eyes.  The second thing that has to be said is that it is not a feast in any other way.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  The cheese platter was good, but how hard is it to make a good cheese platter?  The kafta and eggplant side were just okay.  I question whether the kafta was cooked all the way through.  The whole durade (which comes with not a single bone removed) and the rabbit got luke-warm receptions at my table.  The risotto was good by virtue of its creaminess.  The happiest person at the table ordered the veal.  Finally -- it was pricey (think $16 for a glass of pinot noir) and the service was slow and awkward.  A good place to go when you care more about your eyes than your stomach.",3,1,0,Debbie A.,"Mill Valley, CA",48,81,1
3.0,1/15/2006,"Barbounia's style is hard to pin down.  The restaurant  mullet that roams Mediterranean waters and claims to be Greek-inspired, but it is far too ambitious for it's simple inspiration. There's a nod to greece with the portobello moussaka and the mixed olives served with drinks. Even though the olive mix is reminiscent of Morocco...still on the mediterranean, but miles away from the Aegean shores.  The decor is also reminiscent of northern Africa and perhaps of tents in the desert.The food is good, I especially enjoyed the mascarpone polenta (yes, I said polenta), but the snapper I ordered was a little bit on the dry side. The friends I was with weren't up to ordering the main staple, barbounia, so I will have to go again and give it a go...if it'll be still open. Good choices for appetizers are:  the charred octopus confit lavished with a tangy kalamata tapenade, fava beans and crystallized lemon segments.All in all, a little too pricy and ambitious for the choices. Tread carefully.",0,0,0,ro b.,"New York, NY",21,78,11
