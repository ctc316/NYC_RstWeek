5.0,4/27/2019,I always walk pass this restaurant but I never realized how's busy they are. I had dinner with nice atmosphere. Appetizers were Tuna Tartare and Tarte Flambee . Entrees was Scallops and Steak. They were tasty and juicy. Dessert was Tahitaian Vanilla cream Brûlée. All food were great. I will come back again!!,0,0,0,Gizzy D.,"Queens, Queens, NY",6,3,20

3.0,4/15/2019,"Solid, but not nothing special French brunch spot in the UES. My brother got the shakshuka, which he enjoyed but found to be an Americanized version heavy in cheese and light in sauce. My mom ordered the smoked salmon duo with country bread, which she said was great. I ordered the chocolate croissant--yummy and served warm but I've had better in the city. We also shared the Belgian hot chocolate, which was large and made with real chocolate (vs. powder)--a plus but nothing special.Overall, if you are in the area and looking for somewhere to brunch, this is a decent option.",0,0,0,Amanda Y.,"New York, NY",138,65,43

3.0,4/5/2019,"I think this place is overrated. Maybe I'm missing something, I'm not sure. I think the food is mediocre at best. We got a shak Shula and spinach omelette. Although both dishes look delicious, I was underwhelmed. I always like to see if places live up to the hype, and quiet honestly this place was a flop. We also got a chocolate croissant (good but nothing to rave about) and Vietnamese coffee which was alright. I wouldn't come back here.. especially because the shak Shuka at mellow yellow is not too far away and AMAZING.",0,0,0,Neha P.,"New York, NY",5,44,51
4.0,3/31/2019,"Yum! Came here for brunch with a friend and loved it. The wait wasn't terrible - we probably waited for about 15 minutes for a table. Space is a bit tight though, we were seated quite close together to the point where the tables next to us could hear everything we were saying. I ran into the guy who was sitting at the table next to us in the bathroom sink area and all he kept telling me was to travel while I still can before ""this"" happens (he held up a baby bottle and formula as he said ""this""). Seems like parenthood struck him a bit sooner than he expected.Anyway, back to the real review: food was delicious. I ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict and loved it. All of the pieces tasted good: smoked salmon, poached egg, Hollandaise sauce and the egg muffin to soak up the egg yolk and sauce. Yum! The side salad was tasty too. My friend ordered the omelette and really enjoyed it too.Staff was very friendly as well - they were very accommodating and didn't rush us at all. I would definitely come back here again!",1,0,2,May C.,"Jersey City, NJ",507,704,665

5.0,3/15/2019,"I had posted a negative review about 2 months ago.  The manager Gabriel reached out to me to apologize and invited me back in - that alone earned a star.  The food the second time around was much improved.  The chicken (which I had ordered the last time and had been so disappointing) was moist and delicious this time, as it had been all the times before. Cafe d'Alsace is once again in my rotation of UES restaurants!  Also, I really have to commend Gabriel for caring so much - I can be a harsh critic when asked to spend $80 on a meal that is sub-par, and some restaurants don't seem to care.  Gabriel's prompt response, and efforts to woo me back, were tremendous.",1,0,0,Kevin O.,"New York, NY",7,6,0

2.0,3/10/2019,"I went to Cafe D'Alsace when it was brand new in the neighborhood. I held it high in my esteem for many years. But my most recent visit, last week, will probably be my last. My complaint is not about the food per se, it's about the chintziest, puniest serving of espresso that I've ever seen in my life. The gall of this place, serving about half an inch of this coffee, way at the bottom of the espresso cup. Everybody reading this, please take my word for it. Half an inch. Also it was sour. Really bad espresso. Next case is the plate of cookies for $14. You're thinking you're going to get some nice toothsome cookies with various fruit and chocolate variations. No, these things could have been Girl Scout cookies, quality wise. Plain little depressing discs of beige dough, about an inch across, and two or three weird minuscule spongy ones. No flavor, nothing. Maybe there were 10 of them. Chintzy to the max. Last but not least, my cosmopolitan was very light on the vodka. I couldn't taste it at first. Cosmopolitans can give me a significant buzz, but they wanted to charge me for a splash more buzz. Rolf's doesn't charge extra if you ask them for some more kick. When did Cafe D'Alsace start measuring portions with a tweezer?",0,0,0,Alex H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,20,1

4.0,3/7/2019,"Very good food. APPETIZERS: Bone Marrow and Salmon Tartare. Tartare was fragrant, citrusy and I found myself scraping the plate. Bone Marrow was good but a bit salty. Entrees: We both got the mussels. So flavorful, came in a creamy broth with leeks and garlic and parsley. We had to ask for bread to dip into the broth as most French places serve mussels with fries. Fries were great though! Didn't get a dessert because we were too stuffed.",0,0,0,Vicki G.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,31,0

5.0,3/3/2019,"Excellent UES neighborhood restaurant.  Not cheap, but not overpriced for the quality of food provided.  The steak frites are excellent, as is much of the rest of the menu.  There are many French bistros, but few focus on Alsatian food, and certainly not as well as Cafe D'Alsace.  Definitely worth a visit.",0,0,0,Alex S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0
3.0,3/3/2019,"I was really looking forward to having brunch at this place given all of the great reviews. They don't take reservations for brunch - only for dinner times (which you can reserve through opentable). The good thing is that when you get there, you give them your name and cell and they text you when your table is ready. The restaurant is quite small so waits can be quite long if you don't go early. However the inside of the restaurant is cute and cozy. TIP: you can actually eat/order everything off the menu from the bar! So if there's a long wait for a table and you don't mind the bar, grab a seat there! Will likely be little or no wait. There are hooks along center of the restaurant in between tables where you can hang your coats. For the ladies - purse hooks under the table at the bar. Service: great service. Friendly people. Food: I would give the food a 3/5. You get complimentary bread with butter and jam, which were great. The portions are actually pretty big. We got the shakshuka, which looked amazing but was disappointing. It came with huge chunks of onions that were barely cooked and the onion pieces were still stuck together. It just looked like they were too lazy to cut them up. The pieces of tomato were also huge but I was fine with that. The whole thing was topped with thick amount of cheese, so you couldn't actually dip your bread in it (which is the whole point of shakshuka). RYou can get 2 thin sausage links with it for an additional $8, which were not really worth it IMO. The croque madame was also just so-so. Huge pieces of bread (that probably should have been served with the shakshuka), with tiny bit of ham. The French fries served with it were very bland. As for dessert, we tried the molten hazelnut chocolate gateau, which was close to the worst dessert I've had at a French restaurant. I didn't taste any hazelnut whatsoever and it's served with a raspberry sauce, which is overwhelming because once you add it that's all you can taste. It was fun trying this place with friendly staff but sad to say that I wouldn't go back ...",0,0,0,Ruby C.,"Cambridge, MA",8,181,212

4.0,2/16/2019,"Decided to try someplace new to have lunch with my mom. Cafe D'Alsace was definitely worth the visit. For appetizers we had pheasant sausage w sauerkraut and cream of celery root soup. Soup was the right level of creaminess and perfect for a cold February day. Sausage was well-seasoned and properly tasting of pheasant; the sauerkraut was a great balance.For entrees we had the squash and wild-mushroom risotto and the steak frites. Risotto was a touch overdone but still rather flavorful (and only overdone if you enjoy a proper risotto that would not stay standing after removing a ring-mold, say). Steak was an incredibly tender, extremely flavorful piece of beef; frites were crispy and just salty enough; the bone marrow was an excellent accompaniment.Would definitely return for another meal to try other dishes.",0,0,0,Hansen L.,"Troy, NY",57,11,10
5.0,2/15/2019,It's always hard to find a good place to eat when I'm out and about and celiac. Plenty of gf options on the regular dinner menu and it seems like the kind of place that would be able to make it so if possible. I had grilled salmon with French lentils and vegetables. All clean and simple and absolutely delicious. There were several gf dessert options. Tonight they had a flourless chocolate offering that came with a scoop of their homemade ice cream and a chocolate dipped strawberry. The fries were clean so I stole some of my husband's. I would definitely dine here again and can highly recommend it.,0,0,0,Linda Q.,"Fairfield, CT",0,21,0
3.0,2/14/2019,"I've lived across the street for 8 years now and have come in many times over the years. Sadly, this place has gone downhill. My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch. He got the burger and I got a French onion soup. The prices have gotten ridiculous. His burger was over $20 and my soup was $16. His burger was overdone, the tomatoes mealy and refrigerated although the fries were good. However, my soup was not. It was 90% onions, the cheese was burnt to charcoal on one side and the bread was a Thomas English Muffin! The waiter never asked how our food was and didn't check on us even though there were only like three other tables.

We then got the French toast and crepe soufflé which melted in your mouth! For dessert we got a warm apple tart that was out of this world! Would definitely come back for dinner as well!

1.0,2/5/2019,"If you're black and have taste buds don't go to Cafe D'Alsace. The crab meat, avocado and sweet corn tastes like the flavor has been sucked out of each thing. Hell, even the salt lacks flavor. I tried sprinkling salt and pepper on my omelet and that didn't work. I wanted to change my order from before it came out because I looked over and saw someone eating the same thing. However, I couldn't.

Truly French and much flavor!  Why 3 stars- the service is terrible! They are very inattentive- at least twice we have sat for at least 10 minutes before even being greeted let alone a glass of water. First time we never got a bread basket until I asked after our food had come because we noticed everyone around us getting one. No one came back to check on us after the meal came.

5.0,1/8/2019,"We went on New Years Day at 11 am and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table for 2. There is only a couple of chairs for those waiting and the clientele is mostly 30 to 50 years old. The tables are very close together but the noise level is not too loud. The hosts were polite, pleasant and accurate in telling us how long the wait would be. The servers were efficient and worked as a team to keep up and we were able to order drinks immediately upon being seated. The complimentary bread basket was brought out quickly as well with a small dish of a very tasty butter and a little jam. Our drinks came quickly and the iced coffee was good. The latte was strong and very good. We ordered an omelette that came with potatoes and baby greens and was fresh, light and well seasoned. The potatoes were the best I have had at brunch in a long time. The eggs Benedict was well executed and also came with the potatoes and mixed greens.

4.0,1/4/2019,"A good French bistro; without the French attitude. We went there for brunch on a recent cold rainy afternoon and were in the mood for French onion soup and something that went with pomme fritte. We were seated at a corner table by the window, so while not Paris, what with the weather and the atmosphere in the restaurant we enjoyed a momentary Parisian feeling during our meal. We started with bloody Marys' that was nicely spiced and contained freshly ground horseradish, a nice touch. We ordered the onion soup, which didn't disappoint as well as the Croque Madame and Moules Frites Poulette and naturally pomme fritte. All was very good, nicely seasoned and plated. The service was friendly and efficient and while not Paris, it was Parisian enough.",2,0,1,Michael S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,141,2

5.0,12/31/2018,"This is one of my new favorite brunch spots. We went here on a Sunday at 12 PM and snagged one of the last tables. This place is quite popular so if you're going for brunch, I'd recommend a reservation or getting here before 12 PM. The place inside had adorable decorations for the holidays and it feels very authentically French. The brunch menu runs about $20 per item which is a fair price considering how nice the place is and the quality of the food. Cafe D'Alsace definitely specializes in cheese and bread. I had the shakshuka. The quality of the tomatoes was just okay but the thick layer of cheese on top was divine. They served it with some in house bread that was delicious. My husband had an omelette with caramelized onions and cheese that was delicious as well and mostly because of the high quality cheese. We also loved the bread that was given to us complimentary when we sat down. The bread basket included these small almond and sugar dusted popovers that were incredible, especially when paired with their jam. I can't wait to come back here for brunch again. I'm sure I'd love their dinner too.",0,0,0,Melissa S.,"Manhattan, NY",302,589,8
5.0,12/30/2018,"This place is such a warm and cozy cafe. It was super packed on a Thursday night- which is a good sign. I tried the meat and cheese plate and I was shocked it was a huge portion and there were pickles, olives, pearl onions, cheese and ham. For the entree I tried the scallop and the steak fries. oh my goodness the scallop was amazing it had truffle oil on it and it really accentuated the dish. It was also accompanied with chopped brussel sprouts and bacon. The steak fries had a beautiful presentation with the bone marrow. The meat was tender and the fries were so crispy and addicting, I couldn't stop eating them. For dessert, I had to get the profiteroles. Chocolate and icecream is always a good idea.

4.0,11/28/2018,"This is a cute brunch spot with outdoor seating during the summer - a great option for a small gathering or people watching right off of Central Park. While the coffee was not the greatest I've had and they did not offer me a bread basket like they did other tables, the menu features a good selection of French/Alsatian style options. The menu pricing is definitely a bit above-average for the type of food. I ended up going with the Croque Madame, which was made with artisan bread slices and came with a nice side salad. I also ordered a side of fries and they were pretty good! The Croque Madame was tasty, though a bit over-cooked such that the sides were burned and the cheese/bread portion became very chewy - in a way that is ideal if you want a good jaw muscle workout. After I asked several staff members, one finally gave me a bread basket. Contrary to expectation, the breads in the basket were a bit dry. For the price point, I was disappointed by the quality of the food (especially since I've been in Alsace many times and the food there is much better and cheaper), but overall, it was a beautiful day and I enjoyed having brunch outside - this is definitely a good spot for that!",6,2,5,Nataly N.,"Brooklyn, NY",355,489,1340

4.0,11/12/2018,"Great brunch at Cafe D'Alsace! Started with some complimentary artisanal breads. Everything on the menu sounded so tasty and we came so hungry that we decided to order family style for the table. We ordered the steak tartar, which was absolutely incredible - fresh, seasoned with crisp course salt among other ingredients. Had the Frisee Aux Lardons salad which was refreshening but nothing special and would probably not order it again. We then shared the Smoked Salmon Duo which came with a generous portion of Norwegian smoked salmon, a creamed salmon salad and plenty of bread and bagels to go around. For entrees, we ordered the Omelette Maison (my personal favorite), Eggs Petatou (warm cheesy potatoes with poached eggs which I also enjoyed but the rest of my party was not so fond of... has a pretty sharp Munster taste), Shakshuka (tasty but heavy on the onions), and lastly a French onion soup which my brother was disappointed by (though he is a harsh critic of French onion soup). Overall, the starters were much more enjoyable than the mains, however I was incredibly impressed by the various flavor profiles, fantastic service and fresh and clean presentation. Would definitely come back! Note, we were seated as a party of four immediately for Sunday brunch with other tables and bar area available, so reservations are not mandatory.",0,0,0,Biana G.,"Brooklyn, NY",455,121,120
4.0,11/12/2018,"Wanting to try a new place for brunch, my husband and I decided to check out this cute little French restaurant for brunch on an early Saturday morning.  Since they do not take reservations for brunch, it's first come, first served. We came around 10am (about an hour after opening) and we were still able to get a seat right away without a problem. When we were leaving it did appear to be a wait for a table.The brunch menu had a good variety of savory and sweet items to choose from. You also can order a cocktail if you choose, but we stuck to Belgian hot chocolate and coffee since it was a cold day. While you are waiting for your meal they serve a basket of breads with raspberry jam and butter. We decided to get sweet entrees (brioche French toast and buttermilk pancakes). I really liked the raspberry coulis and syrup that went with the French toast. The toast was thick cut and spongy. I did wish that the French toast batter was more custard in flavor, but that's just my preference. Overall the service was really good. Our waiter made sure our glasses of water and coffee were always full.I really thought it was a good idea of them to have the wash station separate from the bathroom stalls, so if anyone wanted to just wash their hands, they can. We would definitely consider going back to try one of their savory dishes, but I would highly recommend going early if you want to guarantee a shorter wait time for a table.",1,0,0,Tracy D.,"Merrick, NY",285,462,2300
4.0,11/11/2018,"This place lived up to the many positive reviews that it gets, for the most part; I can definitely see why it is so popular and crowded for brunch! The food is pretty good and the service is efficient and friendly. The breads that are brought to the table first are very tasty and come with delicious apricot jam and butter. I had a very popular menu item, the shakshuka, and was pleased with it overall, except for something that was said in another review which seemed to be very accurate, that there seems to be way more tomatoes,peppers and onions added but very little egg, and shakshuka is primarily supposed to be an egg dish. But what was more disappointing was that I asked for extra cheese and emphasized it since I love cheese and was more than willing to pay extra for this, however despite the fact that I was charged an extra $3 for it, there was only an extremely minimal amount added to the dish at all- it was not cheesy AT ALL and seemed to have below the standard amount of  cheese that would have been on a normal order of how it comes. Very very disappointed by that. Also, I've tasted authentic middle eastern shakshuka before and compared to that it was not too special. I still enjoyed it though. And the drink selection is great, they even offer a virgin Bloody Mary which I asked for extra spicy and it was. The Vietnamese coffee was okay, it was my first time having it so I didn't realize that it would be iced. The creme brûlée' was yummy, it tasted like vanilla pudding. My friend had the eggs Benedict and her daughter had the Brioche French toast which she said were amazing, as well as the Mimosa, Cafe Mocha and Profiteroles for desert which they liked as well. Would definitely recommend that you come here and strongly advise getting there early since it is very popular for brunch and they don't take reservations.

The short story: the restaurant has a terrible catty host and bad food!The longer story:The host was this rude and extremely catty guy who should not be the first person customers greet. When we got our table, my husband asked him if we could switch to an empty table nearby and he left my husband waiting only to say no (and not in an apologetic manner). He said that the table we wanted was reserved. Why couldn't those guests sit on our originally assigned table when they arrived? I did not find a way to select a specific table on their website. It is the first time in 9 years where we cannot change tables in a restaurant (and we have gone on so many dates). And by the way, we had a dinner reservation for two people and made it 15 minutes early.My husband wanted me to let it go, but then the food ended up being bad and quite expensive. He ordered the special, only to find it with the bill it was one of the most expensive items on the menu. Worse was the taste, so bad that he could not finish the mussels or the shrimp (and got a stomach ache that evening). I ordered the salmon and it was not good either. For appetizers, we both ordered the french onion soup and it was the worst I have ever had (and I have had a lot of french onion soups).

Typically French restaurants are more on the expensive side but this is pretty reasonably priced without sacrificing any of the quality. For lunch they have a good pre-fixe menu giving you an appetizer and entree for a lower price as well as a 3 - course pre theater fixe between 5pm and 6 pm, a great deal. I love sitting at the bar it's really nicely lit up. They always give you delicious fresh bread to start off your meal. I always order the chopped salad, it looks small but it's very dense and filling loaded with flavor as well as the Grilled Bass ""Antiboise"". The Tahitian vanilla crime brûlée is always nice to top off a meal. Sitting on the patio for brunch is also a great experience if you can get a spot. There aren't any brunch specials like many other UES spots around but the cappuccinos are fantastic and they don't want that crowd there anyway.

Cafe D'Alsace does not take reservations. The started bread with the almonds is REALLY good. I wish they didn't give it to us though because I ate so much of it that I was already full before the meal started. We ordered the French toast, eggs Benedict, and shakshuka.Eggs Benedict was pretty standard. It came with a side salad and potatoes. Definitely enjoyed it, but wasn't anything special. Shakshuka tasted too tomato-y, didn't taste that great to me. I also only had a few bites though, so I could be wrong. I think this is a dish you can skip, though - there are a lot of other amazing brunch options here. The French toast was really good, probably my favorite out of the 3. The toast was soft and egg-y, although the edges were a bit dry. I enjoyed the strawberry syrup on the side as well. I also ordered a Vietnamese coffee.

But, given how empty it was, the service was inattentive and lacking. Servers were talking with each other and seemed to having a good time (dancing around), that's fine, but my water wasn't refilled and my smoked bacon never came. Then, when I asked for a coffee refill, the server accidentally spilled the coffee over my French Toast. I like the space, cute bistro feel. But the two person tables are way too small for the dish sizes. And I was a little appalled at how many flies there were just flitting around. Yes, it's summer and it's open, but there really shouldn't be THAT many, large and small... I would've tried the bread, but it didn't look appetizing after seeing a fly emerge from both the bread basket and the butter.Food came out quickly. French toast at first place didn't seem appetizing. It seemed very dry when I cut into it. Wasn't as dry as I expected, but wasn't juicy either. Lacking in both moisture and flavor - neither egg-y nor brioche-y. Strawberries were so sour, even the maple syrup didn't help. But, it was soft. Still, wouldn't get it again. Maybe I'll try the waffles if I ever come back. The bacon was decent. I thought about just telling the server to take it off my order because it never came, but decided I wanted bacon after all.

5.0,7/26/2018,Very nice ambiance indoors and outdoors. Waiter staff is very friendly. Now for the food.I went during restaurant week. The Bass is absolutely amazing. The salmon tartare and duck terrine is a must. I suggest not to get the lamb choucroute unless you are obsessed with sauerkraut. There was way too much. The lamb was cooked perfectly but not enough lamb to finish the sauerkraut. DrinksMimosa is nothing like your endless brunch offers. Comes with a punch.

Really pretty space with indoor and outdoor seating, the waitstaff is all very professional but also nice. Delicious bread basket comes before your meal with homemade bread and these almond pastry things that were absolutely delicious. Prices may seem on the higher end but they are super reasonable for the quality and amount of food you get, and the vibe of the restaurant. I had the eggs Benedict which was perfect, a really nice light hollandaise sauce, well poached eggs, outrageously delicious potatoes that were spiced to perfection, and a really big salad!

5.0,6/26/2018,"Crowded on a Monday night in June, and everyone on the Upper East Side had the same idea as Cafe d'Alsace has a sidewalk terrace. Next time I will book a table, as it seemed all of us walk-ins were shown the bar, ( not that there's anything wrong or unpleasant about the bar; just the opposite. I just prefer dining at a table).The excellent beer list is extensive and that part of Europe is well represented, in addition to American beers of the same caliber.The wines by the glass (and the list as a whole) are well chosen, and I ordered a Pinot Blanc, and later a Gewurztraminer. The bartender was attentive in keeping me sated.There is a Farmer's Market Beet Salad with Montrachet, ($14), which is just that. The beets are cut up so it looks like a cylindrical tuna tartare. Perfectly delicious. As a main I had Grilled Scottish Salmon with French lentils, fresh lemon vinaigrette, ($28).  I couldn't help but stop and exclaim how good this dish was. Salmon is salmon and usually nothing to get excited about, but this preparation with the lentils and nicely done vegetables was really good.The couple next to me at the bar said that the Tarte Flambee is the way to go, and they also complemented the Wild Salmon Tartare. So after this first visit, I'm pleased that Cafe d'Alsace seemingly employs people who care and put out a quality product. There are also Moules-Frites, Choucroute, and Baeckeoffe on the menu.

4.0,6/25/2018,"Super adorable french cafe on Upper East Side.  We almost didn't come here, because they don't accept reservations for brunch.  We decided to give it a try on a Saturday morning round 11:30, and the three of us were seated without a problem after a short 10 minute wait -  a success in my book! We were seated at one of the booths, under the beautiful mercury mirrors, and loved the ambiance.  The place was kinda noisy, and if the weather was better - I would have preferred to sit outside.  My sister and I were treating my mom for a fun 'Mom's Day' day of adventures, and were feeling pretty indulgent.  All said and done, we had ordered three dishes, 3 cocktails, and 3 coffees, left the bill at $150 with a tip.  The quality of the food was good, but definitely comes with a price tag.  First off drinks:  my sister went with the classic mimosa.  I ordered the Bellini which was perfect, and my mom ordered the lychee Bellini which I tasted, and was phenomenal - sweet, and somehow slightly tart, very refreshing.  I indulged on an macchiato (espresso with small amount of steamed milk), which I LOVED.  They both opted for the cafe mocha which was served in a bowl big enough to swim in - personally, I found the cafe mocha too sweet, but they loved it.Food: We all split 3 dishes, the Shakshuka was the absolute winner, read the thoughts on the dishes below.//Shakshuka: Mediterranean casserole of eggs in tangy tomato sauce with peppers, onions, smoked paprika, cumin, cilantro, aged white cheddar, and fresh country bread.  This was the most delicious Shaksuka I've ever had - the flavors were exquisite, the eggs perfectly cooked, and the rough-chopped peppers and onions were super tender.   I would 100% order this again, when I visit.  The bread was stellar too - we used it to sop up every ounce of that tangy tomato sauce.//Berry Crêpes : fresh berries, crème fraiche, raspberry coulis - in a word, phenomenal.  Difficult to expand upon - simple, elegant, decadent - but not too overpoweringly sweet, a winner.// Artisanal Country Board: We opted to make this a vegetarian meal, and asked to sub more cheese out for the meat - we were told we could do this, for a $9 charge, no problem!  My only complaint was that the cheeses weren't labeled and we had to ask which were what.  Some were SUPER stinky and strong cheeses, fyi!  (Originally dish is: prosciutto, Parisian ham, duck ballotine, rosette de lyon, chèvre, gruyere, roquefort, herbed olives, walnuts, grilled country bread). Olives were delish!Super cute place to brunch, it's clean and fun - staff are friendly, but definitely busy!  We took our time, and nobody rushed us out.  Outside seating seems plentiful with great covered awnings.  A definite recommendation, if you're looking for a cute french cafe style brunch on the UES.",14,5,11,Robin G.,"Princeton, NJ",1226,379,2328

1.0,6/22/2018,"My sister, myself and my 2 year old niece came to Cafe D'Alsace for lunch on Wednesday and had an absolutely horrific experience. Upon arrival, the hostess was on the phone and would not even look up at us. We stood waiting for about 5 minutes and then just sat down on the bench nearby. The hostess nor anyone did not come to help or seat us for over TEN MINUTES. The restaurant was not busy at all. We decided we would seat ourselves and upon doing so, the hostess finally decided to come over and tell us that the table we selected was reserved and moved us. After finally being seated, we ordered our lunch, a burger and asked for a second recommendation and went with a flat bread. Our food arrived and the burger was decent.  The flatbread was burnt and entirely dry and inedible. I wanted to order a soda and explain how bad the flat bread was but the act of flagging down our waiter seemed near impossible. When I finally got his attention and asked for a soda, he ran off before we got to mention the awful flatbread. My soda took almost 20 minutes to come, at which point, I decided he had forgotten about it. But actually, the waiter brought it over when we were done with our lunch. When my sister told the waiter about how awful the flatbread tasted, the waiter actually laughed in her face and walked away. We received our bill, with the flatbread still on it and the soda that came at the end of our awful meal. When we told the manager, he said they were very busy (which they were not at all) and offered for us to stay and order something else after a very long and painfully dragged out meal. He was not overly apologetic, he did not offer any kind of refund, he did not offer for us to come back again for a better experience. This was hands down, one of the most appalling and ridiculous dining experiences I have had in a long time. I have no intention of ever going back.

2.0,6/17/2018,"Living in the area, seeing the lines outside Cafe D'Alsace, I just had to give it another try. I visited the place when it first opened, thought the food was average and overpriced but stopped going mainly because they didn't serve regular beers; no Coors, Budweiser etc. FYI: They still don't serve regular beers. But a friend and I went for brunch. The $19 burger, which I ordered medium, came well-done and dry on too-big a bun. Fries were soggy. My friend ordered their Black Angus Steak Salad at $24; good luck finding the steak. The dish was basically a pile of dry greens; we had to ask for dressing. I've no idea why people line the sidewalks waiting to get into this restaurant. You can get a much, much better burger, for $10.95, across the street.

For entrees, the hanger steak was excellent and the bone marrow delicious on the fries. The herbed goat cheese gnocchi was wonderful, soft and pillowy, but needed more texture - more pine nuts would have helped.  The desserts were lovely, especially the crepe soufflé with passion fruit sauce. The creme brûlée was delicious but needed a thicker crunch of sugar crust and the molten lava cake was cold in the middle the first try and over cooked the second.  Nevertheless we will return.",0,0,0,Susan B.,"Denver, CO",155,17,13
5.0,6/7/2018,"Really amazing dinner kitchen with lots of in kitchen house made delights, that transports you to Colmar in an instant. So many savory choices but still a manageable menu. Dinner without drinks here will run you from $23 to 70, depending on your choices. Our party of 5 spent $60 per head inclusive, and we were pretty frugal. only $50 of that was drinks.Great beer selection, amazing but expensive wine choices, and a few more wines by the glass would be appreciated. Romantic, a bit noisy when full as the place was hopping on a Wednesday night. They have no lack of clientele, as this is the well off upper east side so it's a bit fancy, but not overstuffed.This is a great choice for romantic or intimate smaller party meals. Very memorable and rich food. And for French food the proteins are generous, and the portions are large. The prix fixe is your best choice but it will stuff you, for 2 more days.I enjoyed the steak tartare, the sausage plate, my son's steak was was well seasoned and truly rare and came with bone marrow as a side,  a French specialty, along with pomme frites.Overall an exceptional restaurant with great staff, a prime location, and a kitchen that will leave you remembering, why you want to eat  once again ...In France.",0,0,0,Frank O.,"Shingle Springs, CA",130,388,752
5.0,6/2/2018,"Had a fantastic brunch here today. The waiter was perfect, and sitting outside was nice, as the air is decent and the space is cute.  We ordered the shakshuka and the souffle crepe and loved both.Some reviews said the shakshuka was unflavorful--I disagree. The sauce had a great flavor, and the sausage--really amazing. All the best flavors of lamb without the fishy aroma it can sometimes have. Definitely worth the extra $6. At first we ate the shakshuka alone, but in the end I realized that it goes insanely well with the bread.Glad we got the souffle crepe over the brioche french toast-- it was very special and the cream was very good. We soaked up all the fruit syrup around, which packed the crepe with flavor. We also experimented with pairing the dessert with the mint it came with, and it went well together. However the mint slightly interfered with the soft and creamy blend of souffle and cream.Oh, yes, great butter, jam, and bread. I like to put a lot of both for a nice butter and jam sandwich.",1,0,0,Tiffany J.,"Mountain View, CA",436,234,279

We were seated at a comfortable oval table, still awaiting two arrivals, when I realized my mistake. We were accommodated by merging several smaller tables so we had enough room. Then one member cancelled so we were down to eight. We requested and were moved back to the original table. All this was handled with grace and patience by the staff who were accommodating in all ways, even as out requests changed.The food is always good as is the service. I'm currently stuck on the mussels and fries but I might move on soon. Only four stars for one reason: The expansive, seemingly excellent, wine list is very short at the budget end. Wines start around $50 per bottle and go up quickly from there. It'd love to pop in for a bite on a whim but the total adds up quickly due to the cost of wine.Even with that one caveat, this is a fun, lively, attractive cafe with reliable good food.",0,0,0,Mark L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,0

After dinner, the waitress came out with a dessert (+candle) for our anniversary on the house from them!! and they wished us a happy anniversary many times as well.The food was fantastic!

4.0,2/4/2018,"My friends and I arrived here around 9:20PM on a Friday night and there was a 20 minute wait before the five of us could get seated.I didn't mind that because we showed up spontaneously and without reservation and the staff was very kind, took down my number so that we could take a quick walk around the block and then called me once a table was available.Service was prompt, but the waiter didn't seem to be overly enthusiastic about the menu of the day or about being there at all in the first place.We were quite impressed with the selection of beers available which could hold its own against the options available in the restaurants I know from growing up in Germany, which isn't commonly found in US restaurants.For my entrée I chose the salmon (medium rare). It came with a fantastic white wine sauce and left me wanting for more.The pricing was reasonable in light of the location, and just slightly higher than I feel comfortable spending on a dinner if it weren't a special occasion.Overall, 4/5 because the food was delicious but not quite top tier yet... with that said, I wouldn't be surprised if this place could whip up some kind of meal that would warrant a five star rating and the salmon simply wasn't it.",0,0,0,Conrad G.,"New York, NY",16,14,14
5.0,2/4/2018,"Wonderful restaurant week experiences here! I've been here two times a year apart and at the second opportunity, I was pining to come back. In my recent visit, I had the Tartee Flambee D'Hiver which was sort of like a flatbread pizza. With beets, goat cheese, and lardon (bacon?), it was savory and delicious. Not too heavy, but a cozy winter starter. Then for my entree I had the Classic Cassoulet. I was in heaven. The duck leg stole the show -- fall off the bone, a nice balance of crispy skin and fat. Then for dessert... I was also in heaven. I remember the year prior I had the creme brulee, which was great, but this time I had the cheese plate, which was AH-mahzing!! The cheeses were all fairly soft, but ones that I could identify were similar to brie and bleu cheese. It's a must-have, especially if you are having a glass of wine. Overall the atmosphere was cozy and had a lovely retro vibe. The beer and wine selection is vast and our interaction with our waiter was pleasant and funny.

3.0,1/24/2018,"I wanted to love this place; I've heard endless good things from several different people. My boyfriend and I decided to come by for Restaurant Week Winter 2018, but the food wasn't as up to par as everyone's rave reviews! Not bad but not phenomenal either.We got the Pheasant Sausage and the Grilled Octopus ($5 upcharge) for our appetizers. The pheasant sausage was good and paired well with the sauerkraut and apple; however there was an overwhelming amount of sauerkraut on the plate. The Grilled Octopus served over a large plate of salad. The tart vinaigrette paired well with the octopus and salad, though the octopus didn't have much of a grilled flavor.For our entrees, we got the Steak Frites ($8 upcharge) and the Herbed Goat Cheese Gnocchi. I asked for the steak to be cooked medium rare, but it was more like medium. The red wine reduction was flavorful. The fries were abundant, cooked to the perfect amount of crispness, and seasoned with just the right amount of salt. The bone marrow was buttery, but was gone in two small bites. The flavor of the goat cheese and herbs with the gnocchi was right on, but the gnocchi itself was much too mushy.The desserts came out in a more generous portion than expected. Unfortunately, we were not at all fans of the Ginger Creme Brûlée; the ginger taste was much too overpowering. The Crepe Soufflé was good; it reminded me of Asian spongecakes. There is a bit of cream inside and the lemony sauce and berry compote on the plate made for delicious flavors.A good place for date night with food that isn't disappointing, but not quite up to par with their prices.Side note: We tried to make a 7:30 pm dinner reservation, were told that there was nothing available, but that there was a 7:45 pm available. 15 minutes isn't a big deal so we took it. We ended up getting there early around 7:30 and there were multiple tables open! They still seated us though, so no big deal.",0,0,0,Vanessa W.,"New York, NY",472,142,337

3.0,1/17/2018,"I keep trying to love this place, but having been here for a half dozen times in the last 10 years, I have to say that at best it's a hit or miss experience.  The prices are just too high for the ho-hum quality. We came here for brunch one Sunday and had the crabcake omelette, shared a Belgian waffle, and had the shakshuka.  The latter was presented nicely in a small cast iron pan, but it lacked spices and flavor, instead it had a metallic taste, most likely from the pan.  With coffee for two, brunch came out to $75.

1.0,8/10/2017,"Good food. Great ambience. But for all that, I will never return until they improve their server training.1) The server gave us the check, then ignored us for half an hour. We wanted to split the check and leave but was not able to. 2) After about 30 mins our party really needed to leave. So we waved the server over. They ignored us. Then a red haired server named Lorene came over and told us that it's rude to wave to servers. Yes, it's rude to do so, but ruder to be ignored and not able to pay.Horrible service.

Great selections both sweet and savory.  Cute place, large enough that we did not have to wait long for seating (at least on a summer Sunday when many of the locals are out East).

2.0,8/4/2017,"My first few visits here were great - I didn't have a thing on the menu that wasn't great. But I just went for dinner and left so disappointed. We happened to be there during restaurant week, so their usual prix fixe was gone and the more expensive restaurant week menu was available instead. I'm pretty sure the menus were almost identical. The food was pretty good, although the steak was pretty chewy. The desserts were nothing great either - I wish the cake had been warm since it was served with ice cream. We also had to wait an unreasonable amount of time to get our second course. We were seated at 7:20, ordered immediately, and 50 minutes later were still waiting for our main courses. For desserts that took no prep (cake that wasn't warm and a bowl of ice cream), we had to wait quite a while for our dessert course. We asked our waitress if there was an issue, and shortly after our desserts the manager sent out a cookie plate. I appreciate the effort, but we already had dessert (and two courses)! It was pretty useless and way too much food. They could have comped our drinks instead or offered us a free round. The cookie plate was put on our bill as a $4 comped plate which was almost offensive on our $120 bill. I ended up leaving disappointed, especially because we spent a long time trying to decide which restaurant to go to and chose Cafe D'alsace because we knew we could rely on it. I guess the moral of this story is probably don't go during restaurant week. I also won't be defaulting to it as much in the future.",1,0,0,Molly H.,"New York, NY",244,37,1

The omelettes and breakfast sandwiches were great and the atmosphere is deceivingly classy. My favorite brunch spot in NYC so far for sure.

2.0,7/28/2017,Dined here for restaurant week with a friend. Ambiance was fine; outdoor seating seemed very nice. Food was nothing special- I had the steak frites and my friend had the duck. Unfortunately the most lacking aspect of our meal was the service. We barely had a moment with our waiter except for ordering and the several times we flagged him down for service.

3.0,7/15/2017,"Such a cute spot (with beautiful outdoor seating), but unfortunately the French food is just decent. I wanted to love this place, but the Croque Madame was disappointing. There was so little actually in the sandwich that it just looked like two pieces of bread on top of each other with an egg on top. The mixed greens were good, though, and the fries were really yummy. One upside is that even though this is a French place, they definitely give American-style large portions.

2.0,7/8/2017,"I've been to Cafe D'Alsace for brunch in the past and enjoyed it Tonight my husband and I had dinner here for the first time. It may have been an off night - Sunday before July 4th, perhaps unusual staffing, etc. But this was a very odd meal with very poor service - something we almost never experience in NYC - the world capital of attentive and engaging restaurant staff. We had French onion soup, spicy lamb sausage with sauerkraut, steak frites with an optional 'pepper sauce' and a creme brulee. The onion soup was peculiar and unpleasantly sweet, a sort of apple/gruyere stew, the onions were completely tasteless in the strange, saccharine broth. As for the steak, the meat was good and nicely cooked but the 'pepper sauce' was bland, nothing like a steak au poivre, for example, and the dish was not served with a bernaise or any other side nor was there catsup for the frittes.  Unimaginative. It frankly felt careless. The lamb sausage was average and the sauerkraut continued the theme of mysterious sweetness with no apparent source. Where were these treacly, syrupy flavors coming from? The kraut was unflavored otherwise - no onions, no apple, no caraway - off the shelf if we had to guess, but with these loopy honied fllavors. It made the decent sausages at first inedible and then unaccompanied. The creme brulee was the highlight, though it hadn't been brought up to room temp. and was only average, but the emphasis on sweet over savory had finally caught up to a dish! After all that we agreed that the worst part of the meal was sadly the service. We'd had a long day and didn't start with cocktails or wine, so that may have started us off badly, but our server uniquely took offense at the entire exchange when we returned the drinks list.  In any case, the service took a nose dive from that point forward. It was half an hour to get our starters and another full half hour at the close to get the check and have it run through. Our server seemed inexperienced and easily unsettled which subtly went agro in a matter of moments. Not a sweet eperience despite all the sugar!",1,0,0,Ana H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0

The food was pretty darn good and well-sized.  My lump-crab omelette was, to my surprise, full of crab meat!  I initially thought they'd try to stiff me on the crab, but I was pleasantly proven wrong. So, if you find yourself in the UES, I insist you grab a friend or two, stop by here, order the pastry basket, and dive into a thoughtful conversation.My only gripe is that they don't seat you until your entire party arrives..which is somewhat annoying...bleh!",0,0,0,Khama W.,"Washington, DC",452,34,19
5.0,7/6/2017,"A really good brunch, with shakshuka I still talk about to this day. Friend and I met another visiting friend for a very UES Sunday brunch catch-up session. It's a pretty place with old school décor and diner-esque seating complete with red leather plush seats. It's French themed as well, so there were hints of ""French Café"" all around ranging from the lighting fixtures, the menu options, and also the art on the wall. We were able to get seated immediately, which was surprising since the place was packed. We were able to make our choices quickly - one friend got a latte and a Western omelet with hash browns and salad, another got the French toast, and I got the shakshuka with Viennese sausages. The food took a while to come out, but when it did it definitely did not disappoint. Portions were large, and vibrant when contrasted with the table and surroundings. They were happy with their food, though no one was singing praises to the heavens because of it. My shakshuka was really super freakin' good, though - they made me believe in Viennese sausages again! It was served with this char-grilled, buttered thin-cut country bread that as my friend aptly put, ""tastes like blue skies and cow pastures"" in every bite. Service was fast, not too business-like as is common in larger brunch places, and generally a solid brunch option on the UES. Didn't try their alcohol selections, it's a must-do for when I go next!",0,0,0,Carol L.,"New York, NY",769,437,1507
3.0,7/4/2017,"I dunno... this place has changed for the worse for me. The food is still quite solid, but the service seems to now just be a high-turnover, no personality kind of place. Our waiter took our order, and never came back until it was time to give us our check. It was the kind of service you get in France but fortunately in France it's understood that you're not leaving a tip. No water refills, no coffee refills, no ""how is your meal"" or ""did your order arrive correctly"" check-ins. Worse was feeling so uncomfortable watching what I assume was the floor manager storm around treating customers like crap. She refused to seat a family of 4 with a baby (so, 5) in an empty restaurant in a corner seat (which sits 5 adults if squeezed in) saying the place would be ""packed in 30 minutes."" When the mom questioned her she rudely and sternly said no (with no patience) with the explanation, ""I need to maximize business."" For the record, they turned the corner seat into a table for 2 and another for 2 before it even became packed (an HOUR later, for the record)... which means they could have sat the family there and it would have been the same. We also overheard a nice woman eating alone ask her if they were serving brunch because it wasn't the time the menu said brunch was served, and that lady brusquely said (again with no patience whatsoever), ""I wouldn't have given you the brunch menu if I wasn't serving you brunch."" Then she proceeding to stomp around the restaurant with RBF making it very uncomfortable. I finally overhead a third couple complaining about similar treatment from the very same lady. This place seems to have decided they're the only game town and they think they can do no wrong with customer service. I'm  now at ""one last shot and never again"" and I'm sure many in that restaurant today felt the same.

Definitely get rezzies here, even if you think you don't need them! The crowd: lots of families on a weekend- typical UES scene :) What we ordered:Octopus salad (daily special) + grilled Scottish salmon: I was in a seafood mood. octopus was grilled well and complimented the salad. Salmon was seasoned well- perhaps a bit too salty for my taste but good nonetheless.Asparagus soup (Sdj) + burger d'alsace that comes with fries: friend loved her soup and then burger looked fantastic- fries were the crispy shoestring kind which was our fav! I would've totally gotten this if I wasn't on a health streak. Charcuterie board + farmhouse chicken: legit board! Chicken was devoured!They also brought out a plate of FANTASTIC CHEESY BREAD PUFFS for the table and omg was it heavenly. We also requested a basket of bread-bread and they were happy to accommodate. My friend even asked for seconds on their bread, which they were so generous to provide gracefully. Service is spectacular- our server was sweet and attentive!

The patty was cooked just right with so many flavors. Don't know how else to describe except to tell others that it's a must try. The fries weren't that delicious but the lamb burger definitely makes up for it. the burger was also topped with dried tomatoes, lettuce and goat cheese which was very interesting.

3.0,3/19/2017,"Came here for restaurant week. For $42 you get an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I got the beef tartare, lamb choucroute, and chocolate lava cake. I also got to try the lobster ravioli, steak frites, and lavender creme brulee. The beef tartare was fresh. Nothing really notable about it though. It didn't have a lot of flavor. Lobster ravioli was average. It was cooked well but again, had no flavor. The lamb choucroute came with four tiny pieces of lamb, a sausage that was too salty, and a crazy amount of sauerkraut. While the lamb was pretty tender, that was the most unworthwhile thing I have had in a long time. I basically paid for a pot of sauerkraut. I usually clean my plate when I go out or at least box it up, but I just had them throw this away. The bone marrow was fatty and delicious but the positives end there. The steak with bone marrow was unevenly cooked. Some parts were well done, some were medium rare. The fries that came with it tasted like something we could get at McDonalds for far less.The chocolate soufflé was really good. I'm a sucker for anything with melted chocolate in it and this really hit the spot. It was sweet, rich and tasted amazing with the vanilla ice cream. I also got to try the lavender creme brulee. It was honestly pretty gross. There was way too much lavender flavoring in it and it was very runny.The seats are pretty close together and its hard to squeeze inside the booth. Service is okay, flagging down the server can be a little difficult. I wouldn't actively choose to come back here. It was far too expensive for a mediocre meal.",1,0,1,Liz T.,"New York, NY",538,174,150
5.0,3/19/2017,"What's not to LOVE about Cafe D'Alsace? Their food is PHENOMENAL. They have so many incredible dishes for brunch, lunch and dinner. I have dreams about their savory burger, their delicious breads, their incredible omelets. The worst thing about dining at Cafe D'Alsace is having to choose from such amazing options.  The decor is beautiful - antique seltzer bottles of vibrant colored glass are lit above the bar area. The vibe feels what I would imagine to be very mid-century modern Alsacian (ok, I have never been to that region of the world, and I wasn't alive at that time, but still, it just FEELS RIGHT). It's the perfect balance of stylish coziness. I like to go there for special meals, but there is nothing affected about the restaurant.  Everyone who works there is wonderful.

Another table next to us were a cute elderly couple having their morning coffee. The customers and the friendly servers truly make this a lovely neighborhood cafe!The complimented Almond Gougeres bread was really yummy! It was soft, warm and fluffy! I asked for one more of the Gougeres because it went so well with the jelly and butter :D I ended up getting the grilled chicken club sandwich and my friend got the omelette lorraine. The portion of grilled chicken club sandwich was pretty big. The chicken was tender and I liked that there was a lot of cheese covering it!! The toast was a little bit burnt on the edge, and I hope it could be crispier. The side salad was refreshing, and the fries were thin and crispy which I love!!

Our server was pleasant and and they were bustling this particular evening. The restaurant week prices always significantly risen for NYC, with the dinners soaring to $42 for three courses. I've been here before with my girlfriend and we had a wonderful time. I remember their Gougères so vividly and this evening, we were served a nice plate of the light dinner clouds with the slightest essence of cheese. My only wish would be that they be served warmed. That would be perfect. After polishing off the three they gifted us, I asked for another helping because, I just love them sooooo much.Hubbs had the Steak Tartare and I had the Goose and Foie Gras Sausage w/Cabbage and Apple. Both were very good. Our second courses were Duck Confit Mushroom Risotto for moi and Steak Frites w/Bone Marrow for hubbs. I scored his bone marrow because he just doesn't appreciate the connective tissue flavour treasure. Our entrées were so good. We were basking in the wonderment of our meal. Our dining neighbors were all enjoying the restaurant week dishes. We hardly had any room for dessert but ordered Hubby's Lavender Vanilla Crème Brûlée and my Hazelnut Molten Chocolate Gâteau. Both were so tasty but at this point, I was stuffing bits into the small empty pockets of my stomach. I finished up with a double espresso and a touch of sambuca.

5.0,2/8/2017,"Totally screwed the pooch on this one.  My wife and I lived in this area, and somehow missed this place for lunch/dinner.  Our only stop over here was for breakfast one morning.  Not sure how we never ended up here after that.Was looking for a French place for my wife's birthday in the UES, and this place came up as a top place both on Yelp, and on some lists posted to Google.  Based on the pictures online I didn't recognize it as the place that was two short street blocks away from where we used to live.Going to see if I can make this shorter if I break it down by area:Hostess - 5 stars.  We were early for our 8:30 reservation back on 1/31, so she mentioned it would not take long but we were welcome to go to the bar.  After being there for less than five minutes, she came back to let us know that it will only be a few minutes as they were clearing off a table.  Then she came back a minute or two later to let us know our table was ready.  To me a hostess can't really hurt a place too much, but it can certainly help your appreciation of it.  And even though they were absolutely slammed, this woman made sure she communicated with everyone.  She set the tone for the wonderful evening we were about to have.Atmosphere - 5 stars.  Cute little bar, and although the seating is tight, it's not one on top of the other.  Plus even if it is, that's how Paris is.  We were lucky enough to sit catty-corner at one of their corner tables, and could not have been happier with the table location.  Further, even though they were slammed, the two of us went through two bottles of wine and a couple Grand Marnier's and we were never rushed.Server - 5 stars.  Like I mentioned before, they were slammed.  But this woman, Reanna, hustled so we were never without anything.  Plus she held the wine bottle the proper way when she poured.  I always find this to be a sign of a well-trained server.Sommelier - 5 stars.  We didn't break the bank with the bottles we ordered, in total they were only $140 (they had individual bottles well above that), but the Sommelier came over with the bottles, explained them, poured and held properly.  Now that we know that they have one, we'll ask him for suggestions next time up here.Food - 5 stars.  I had the lobster ravioli with Chardonnay sauce to start, and the seared skate fish as my entrée.  My wife went for it and got the steak frites.  Everything was presented and cooked exceptionally well.  Highly recommend any of those dishes, but chances are you can't go wrong with most anything on the menu.I've been lucky enough to spend almost four weeks in Paris the past three years, and another week in Nice.  The French know their food and wine much better than we do.  If you picked this place up and dropped it in Paris (or Alsace for that matter), they wouldn't miss a beat.",0,0,0,John M.,"Wantagh, NY",1,257,5

5.0,2/6/2017,"Thank goodness the Q train reaches this area because this restaurant is superb.The portion sizes are huge, appetizers nearly suffice as a delightful entree.We came here for RW and was seated in David's section. Really friendly waiter, didn't rush us, suggested we look at dessert later so we can enjoy our two courses first.To begin, from the RW menu, we got the Tarte Flambee and Steak Tartare. The tarte came in 4 slices, was so light and the sweetness from the leeks and onions were splendid. The tartare is a whole other level of mouth watering. A large serving of tartare with some arugula and 4 slices of bread to accompany it. Absolutely love and recommend this dish.For entrees, Steak Frites and Lamb Choucroute. The Steak Frites came with a side of fries and bone marrow. Gorgeous thick pieces of steak and buttery marrow are wonderful pairings. Fries had a slight sweetness to them and it worked, very tasty. The Lamb Choucroute comes in a bowl with a big portion of sauerkraut as a base, sausages, and cuts of lamb shoulder and loin. Boy, this dish was heavy, the meats were on the top ring and it was only focused on. The loin and shoulder pieces were extremely tender with wonderful flavor. Sausages were ok, some strong lamb flavor lingered through bites.Finally, desserts selected were Chocolate Gateaux and Brulee. The Gateaux came with a scoop of ice cream plus raspberry (?) sauce. Definitely chocolatey, but missing that expected deep rich flavor. The Brulee was pleasant, light and creamy. Great choice to lighten up the meal at the end.Definitely looking forward to returning to try out their other dishes.Note, be wary how much food you order. Portion sizes are delightfully large.

I was impressed that they have the muenster from Alsace there too which is very stinky. The food was great. I got the Seabass and started with the pork sausage. It was great. My boyfriend started with the soup du jour which was lentil and got the mixes sausage and meat platter, the flavors were very similar to dishes we got in Strasbourg a few months ago. For the dessert we tried the creme Brulee and the profiteroles. The creme Brulee was delicate and good.

1.0,12/12/2016,"I've been to this restaurant once for brunch, and after seeing their dinner menu, my wife and I decided to try it out for dinner on a Saturday night. While we didn't have a reservation on a Saturday night, we thought it would be simple enough to just show up. Given the fact that we did not have a reservation, we were completely aware that we might need to go elsewhere. Well, when we showed up shortly after 7pm, we asked the hostess for a table for two. The place was somewhat packed, but the hostess said she would see what she could do. There was at least one empty table in the restaurant, and the hostess said she would try and seat us. After looking through her book/tablet, she determined that there was one table available. Again, we are reasonable people, and since we showed up without a reservation, we were aware that we might not get seated. The hostess had the audacity to tell us that, the one table was available, but that she had an 8pm reservation for it, so we would need to be seated, order our meal, and finish by 8pm, mind you, it was 7:22pm. So, she thought it was reasonable for us to sit, have the waiter/waitress take our order, and then consume our meal in 38 minutes in order for the next group to be seated at 8pm. I mean really? It's not as if this were some 4-star restaurant. As you can imagine, we said no thank you and walked out. It would have been much easier for her to say that there were no tables available than to tell us that we had 38 minutes to sit, order our food, have it brought to the table, consume it, and then pay for the check. We decided to head over to the Writing Room, which had plenty of seating, and we were not subjected to a 38-minute time limit.

4.0,11/11/2016,"Great Upper East Side French Bistro/Cafe has an authentic aesthetic. Very hospitable non-pretentious staff. Also, has a great three course Prix Fixe menu.  Food was excellent and this diner appreciated how beautifully each dish was presented. Waitstaff was super friendly with real attention to detail by support staff who were non-intrusive yet kept the table looking great and our glasses filled. Our diners had escargot, octopus, beet and goat cheese salad, steak frites, striped bass and everyone was very satisfied with the flavor profiles. Flowerless chocolate cake was diminished by an accompanying and delicious pistachio ice cream. I thought the octopus deserved more char and citrus and a little less kalamata olive taste. The UES deserves more restaurants such as Cafe D'Alsace. Will definitely return and really appreciate their hospitality.",0,0,0,charles g.,"Virginia Beach, VA",1,5,0
3.0,11/8/2016,"With no tables available at a nearby brunch place, headed over here Saturday morning due to the solid reviews on Yelp. Outdoor seating is available with heated lamps to keep you warm; luckily we were able to secure a table inside after a short wait.Once seated we got a free basket of bread with jelly/butter. Warm and a delicious starter. For the main course, settled on the Grilled Boudin Blanc & Smoked Pork Sausages ($18). The pork sausage is cooked well with rich flavor; the Boudin Blanc is a chewy wurst which needed a bunch of hot sauce. The sausages are served on a bed of regular sauerkraut and potatoes. To drink I had a tequila-based cocktail that was probably 50% tequila - quite a punch (couldn't finish).Despite the crowd, the service is spot on and friendly. As for the food, felt my dish was just okay. Some items giving more bang for your buck than others, so would come back to try something else.",3,0,1,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",289,1569,1552

4.0,9/22/2016,"Psst, psst... you guys, the burger here is really good! You have to check this place out. I came on a late Saturday afternoon, after being thoroughly defeated by the NYC rental market. Since I was already up on the UES and ravenous, I decided to turn the day around with a quick lunch, party of one, at this little café I quickly yelped. (Thanks for the recommendations everyone!) Perched up at the bar with a few other solo diners, I quickly started a conversation with the bartender who was friendly and offered suggestions on the menu. His face lit up when describing the burger so I was instantly sold. I'd say the Burger D'Alsace is making its way into my top 5 burger list. Why the hesitation though? Well points off because my burger was a tad overcooked to my requested medium rare. Despite being overcooked, the burger was still juicy, combining flavors of a really good French onion soup and a quality burger. That hit the mark for me and since I did ultimately find an abode on the UES, I'll be back for more.",7,4,5,Stephanie S.,"New York, NY",94,153,102

4.0,8/21/2016,"I've been here 2x.  The first time was the 3rd week of Restaurant Week, for lunch. I like that they had 6 starters, 7 main courses and 4 desserts to choose from instead of the usual 2 or 3 that most restaurants had.I was greeted by the hostess, who was very pleasant, and seated immediately.  It wasn't very crowded but it was pouring rain, so that may have had something to do with it.  The service was very good.  Ordered a glass of white wine.  Was advised that the soup of the day was chilled cucumber and that was it for me.  Different from what I'm used to, but excellent.  I then had the Leek and Comte Quiche which came with field greens. The quiche was delicious--would've liked a bit more leek.  Loved that the field greens included frisee and loved the dressing.  Dessert was the creme brulee with raspberries.  Everything tasted very fresh and I thought I'd probably go back.When I got home, I read their entire menu and knew I would go back which I did the following week.This time I went for dinner and although it was still Restaurant Week, I wanted to order from their regular menu.  I'd made a reservation as better safe than sorry but at 6pm on a Thursday probably didn't need it.  Was greeted by the hostess and seated promptly.  I was at a table on the row of tables on the far left when you first walk in (with a booth type seat on the wall).  I first sat on the booth seating as I don't like having my back to the room (I like people watching).  HOWEVER (and this was the only complaint I had), the seat was so low I felt like a kid sitting at the grownups table that needed a booster seat.  The table top reached the top 1/3 of my chest. Egads!  So I switched to the other side of the table, sat in the chair and felt like an adult again.I started with the red and yellow tomato salad (it had frisee, too) which was so fresh tasting.  The tomatoes were sliced super thin, there was just the right amount of roquefort and the vinaigrette was perfect.  Thoroughly enjoyed it and will probably get it again as I like the first course to be light.  I ordered the main from their sausage menu.  I got the one sausage option (boudin blanc), but then ordered a side of spaetzle (I love spaetzle).  Everything was cooked just right; the sausage, the sauerkraut, the spaetzle and it was a great dinner.  Just what I was looking for.  Tried the thin caramelized apple tart with ice cream for dessert (got vanilla instead of caramel ice cream).   Loved it.  Had a couple of glasses of red wine and expresso to finish.  The service at dinner was also very good.So I've been there twice and plan on going back.  There is so much on the menu that I want to try and as what I've had so far was very good, I'm looking forward to my next visit.  I want to go for Le Petit Brunch soon as I want to try the Shakshuka which looks really interesting.With the exception of that booth, really liked the decor (I'll just insist on a table with a chair where I can people watch).  At bit like a french bistro.  It is not an expensive place to eat (unless you get everything I did).  I think if you're doing 3 courses (not including wine or expresso), it would probably be in the $$$ range.  For NYC, I consider that to be good.",0,0,0,Joan M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0

One of the best desserts in the world: Warm Flourless Chocolate Gâteau. Sometimes when it's really busy, the servers have trouble keeping up, so you might have to be patient with your refill. My only real gripe is that there's something weird about the acoustics that makes it particularly noisy.

3.0,8/2/2016,"I was struggling between the 3 stars and the 4 stars, if I could, I'd like to give it a 3.5 stars.Environment: we came here for lunch (restaurant week), and there were not packed with people! Nice! Not until we were seated which was close to the outdoor seats. Why? Because the construction work and the traffic over there were so loud that our conversation was interrupted like three times. Suggestions: sit inside if you would like to have private conversations. Foods: I had salmon tartare as appetizer, the salmon was fresh and sweet, but nothing outstanding, need some salt. Entree was medium rare steak with French fries on the side. Not a fan of dark fries...steak was ok, wish it was pinkish medium rare, mine was like 70% cooked. Dessert: chocolate cake with strawberry sauce and pecan ice cream, enjoyed the chocolate cake A LOT!!! The only impressive things overall. Cause the greenish looking pecan ice cream looked odd and it was just an ok one. Service: waitress was attentive and sweet, 4 stars.Overall experience: 3.5 stars.Conclusion: there are other much better French restaurants out there if you would like to impress your date. If you would just like to stop by and have some casual lunch, by all means go for it!Of course, this review does not reflect the dinner!

3.0,7/30/2016,"Ten months later, a dozen more visits for brunches, lunches, and dinners, and I stand by my original review: good food, bad service. Bad how? 1 - it takes forever to get your water and bread, water could be a deal breaker on a very hot day. It does not matter how busy they are, this part is consistently bad on a slow weekday late lunch and busy weekend brunch. 2 - tables outside can be dusty. I understand this is NYC, and the place is at the corner of a busy ave, but I still think a clean table is quite a modest thing to ask;3 - China and silverware is not always clean; E.g. lipstick marks on cups, dried leftover food on knives and forks, etc.4 - it's often hard to catch the attention of your waiter. There is an exception to this rule but getting good service here is rather a good surprise than a sure thing.We have had consistently good experience with multiple hostesses, and food is always good, just as I said before, but my points above are so annoying and so frequent that I'm ready to look for another go-to place.----------I have mixed feelings about this place. If you come for good food - this is a five star place, if you want good service go elsewhere. Sometimes it takes forever to get little things like water and bread. Servers are ok, but no more than that, sometimes you can see how bored or annoyed they are. This is not something I want to see after a long day, more so on a weekend.

I was trying to get information if they can accommodate 20 people on Sunday for a brunch and I would be the one who is organizing that and I didn't want my guests to pay for themselves. I was looking at the few places in the area. This place looks really nice , sunny and pretty, so I thought that would be perfect. I stopped by there and spoke to the hostess, she was very nice , and she said that manager wasn't there and they usually don't take reservations on Sundays , but because I was inquiring for 20 people , she gave me email address of the manager and advised to contact him . I went on their website and it says nothing about ""no reservations for Sunday "" , it even has link for the large party inquiries where you can pick date , time etc . So I did all that , got confirmation email , that my info was received. There was no response for few days and I wrote another email to the manager, email that hostess provided to me , I even called and confirmed it again . So I got no response for a few days again . Place is few blocks away from my home, so I stopped by there again . I spoke to another hostess , I told her that I would like to know if they can accommodate party of 20 , on Sunday, because we would like to be seated together, I would be one paying, etc . She said they don't take reservations for Saturdays or Sundays, because it's their busiest days . I said that's fine , I will go somewhere else , she said that she will check with manager , she went to talk to him and came back with a same response . So was it so difficult to respond to my emails ? I don't know what's wrong with them , but it's not how you treat people in hospitality business . It's is fine with me , that they were not interested to have us there, there are many places to eat on the Upper East Side. But I was talking to few other places in the area and this place was the worst , as far as their attitude. Hostess didn't even bother to offer to hold the doors for me , I was there with a stroller.

5.0,7/13/2016,"BEST PRIX FIXE Dinner deal around!This place is right around the corner from me and its always packed. So of course, like a fly to light, I had to go...and I was not disappointed. I went there for dinner and had the fixed price dinner. I then pigged out and had the tarte flambee and french onion soup. Don't judge me. I live to eat. Can we first start with the little gruyere balls they bring out. Heavenly little things and FREE! I had about two and could have eaten more. The tarte flambee was ok but a little greasy. There is a place in the 30s called Tarte flambee that actually makes it quite a bit better. The french onion soup was good. Very gooey with the fromage but a little on the sweet side. I'm not sure if they just used a specific sweeter onion or if they added sugar. But overall quite enjoyable. The meal then moved onto a beet and goat cheese salad and steak tartar. The beet and goat cheese salad stole the show. I usually try to avoid beets because I don't enjoy what happens the next day...if you don't know what I'm talking about, ask your mom. Its quite a frightful experience everytime. But I threw caution to the wind and gobbled it up. The sweetness of the beet and the tangy of the goat cheese were perfect. The steak tartar had pickles in them...or as the french call it cornichons. It was ok but I wouldn't get it again. I had the steak frites. The steak was a HUGE portion and perfectly cooked. I wasnt a fan of the sauce but thats ok considering how perfect the steak was. One of the best cooked steaks I've ever had. The frites...oh gosh. Best ones I've had in this city yet. So much better than that Pomme Frites place in the village. Everything was so good that when the hubs tried to steal a bite, I actually let out a growl because my basic caveman instincts emerged. I also had the profiterole and chocolate cake for dessert. Both great. Needless to say, I was extremely full. The price was unbeatable. It was only $39 for each person on the fixed price menu. The service was also nice and friendly. In the beginning, our waitress screwed up a little but definitely made up for it over the course of the meal. She gave us free country bread...twice... She must have known I am easy to bribe. She also told us about how the chef is from the Alsace region in france and very specific about the recipes...which made me imagine a french accented version of Gordon Ramsay calling someone a donkey.",2,2,1,Tina X.,"Manhattan, NY",30,164,12

4.0,6/29/2016,"New York exists to eat.  Forget the financial district, forget the museums, forget everything.  Everything you do in NY centers around filling up time between meals, and the only reason there is time between meals is because if your stomach ruptures and you die, you won't be able to keep eating.This was far from the best meal I have ever had in NY, but it was a really good brunch.  The restaurant was a couple of blocks from our airbnb on our last day, so we decided to hit it up for brunch before heading to the airport.  My girlfriend pointed out the Shakshuka, which was something she got in Boston at one of the awesome restaurants we went to there, and it was one of the best breakfast/brunch items I had tasted, so I made sure to get it here.For those of you unfamiliar, it is a Mediterranean dish, described as a casserole of eggs in a tangy tomato sauce with peppers, onions, paprika, cumin, cilantro, cheddar with grilled country bread (though I think the bread thing isn't part of the recipe - just a basket of bread).  I got it with the 2 merguez sausages.  Now, from this description we can determine 2 things:  one - I can read a menu and transcribe it to yelp perfectly, and 2-this isn't your average breakfast.  I got the sausage because I wanted protein and like breakfast meat and because its sausage, but really, the dish doesn't need the sausage.  It is fan-freaking-tastic and doesn't need anything; no salt or pepper - maybe just some water after you try to eat it right away and burn a hole in the roof of your mouth (the dish comes out in a piping hot iron skillet).    I am going 4 stars instead of 5 for 2 reasons.  Firstly, at $19, it is expensive for breakfast.  However, this is NY and you have to expect to pay more, so that probably isn't fair.  More importantly, I have had this dish twice.  I tasted it once in Boston and then had it here, and frankly, they did it better in Boston.  That's not to say this wasn't good - this was excellent - but the one in Boston was noticeably better and while there might be room for more than one 5-star Shakshuka, until more places start serving it, I can't give both 5-stars when one was better than another.  Again, maybe not fair - it was 2 different restaurants in 2 cities, so they aren't exactly competing, but...nothing, I have no way of ending that sentence.I didn't see much of the inside of the restaurant as we sat on the patio, but it looked very nice.  The outside wall opens up all the way so it merges seamlessly with the patio, giving it a nice open-air feel.  We were in the sun - the entire patio is not shaded - but thankfully it wasn't too hot.  I was still sweaty, but I always am, and that is too much information.  Sorry.Coffee was very good.  Service was excellent.  That grilled country bread?  Superb.  And, it was warm enough that our plate of butter melted completely, so we could dip it in butter.  Score!Don't know how they do other meals, but brunch is a winner here.",5,4,3,Todd B.,"St. Petersburg, FL",191,531,1101
4.0,6/28/2016,"Came for brunch on Saturday and I was really glad I did! I've been scoping this place out for a while given that my boyfriend's apartment is a 5 minute walk away but we've never gotten around to actually dining there. It's always packed, though, so we had really high hopes. We arrived and we were quoted at 15 minutes, and it ended up being closer to 10 (props to the hostesses!). We sat at the bar for a drink before our table cleared up. Can't remember the names of the drinks, but it was basically a strawberry bellini and a pear bellini. Both were okay, but I preferred the pear. We spent a while perusing the menu and ultimately decided on the eggs benedict with salmon and the omelette Lorraine (which I had seen mentioned on several Yelp reviews- thanks for the rec, guys!). Both came with some roasted potatoes and mixed greens. {Food} : despite being super plain, the mixed greens were high-key amazing. Really fresh with tasty flavors...even my veggie-averse, picky-eater boyfriend agreed they were good. The potatoes were awesome too, and were a lot better than the ultra-greasy home fries most places serve with brunch. I thought my boyfriend's eggs benedict was sooooo good. The hollandaise was perfect, and the salmon was fresh and smoky, just how we like it. The omelette was just slightly disappointing, but still good. It had gruyere, bacon, and grilled onions in it. I thought the eggy part was a little dry, and the contents of the omelette were inside the fold rather than mixed into the eggs (I prefer them actually mixed in when the eggs are being cooked). And the bacon was really fatty. BUT the flavors were good, and the bacon bits that weren't little strips of fat were so tasty. {Service}: It was fine. Nothing to write home about, but no complaints, either. Our server was a little aloof and didn't really make small talk or anything with us, but I'm sure he was pretty busy so it's fine, whatever. Would probably return, but would order the eggs benedict instead of the omelette lorraine, and would skip the drinks. Most brunch entrees are under $20, which is pretty competitive for the quality of the food. Glad I tried it, for sure.",1,1,2,Hannah M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1025,331,1186

We came for Saturday brunch today, unfortunately as we were pulling over ahead of a parked car in front of the restaurant, that car was leaving so we bumped into each other and had to wait for a long time for the police to come. I went into the restaurant to eat first while my husband was waiting, had the waffle with berries, it was really tasty. The police took a long time to come, after i was done eating, the manager Gabriel came out to give my husband and the other car some pastries for free since we had been waiting for like 1.5 hours already. When the police was done his work, the other car left, and our car battery died. The restaurant's neighbor, The owner of Fine Cleaners, a super nice Korean lady came out and said she had a jump starter and asked me to take care of her cleaning store so she can go around the corner to ask her husband to deliver the jump starter. Although the husband took a long time to arrive, before we saw him, Gabriel had this idea of having a yellow cab driver to jump start for us, and it finally worked. In the meantime, he had the waitress delivered us two hot chocolate for free again (it was cold out today). We were so touched.

The atmosphere is nice and dimly lit, although the tables against the wall are rather close to each other so it's not very private. We had an attentive and knowledgable server. I ordered a Lychee Martini, which was delicious, then shared the Mussels (entree) as an appetizer. They were some of the largest/plumpest mussels I have ever had. The broth was delicious and it was a generous portion. For my entree, I had the Sea Scallops. They were excellent. The price was pretty standard for a great experience without being over the top. Overall, it was a nice experience and I would certainly go back - next time for the wine and cheese selection!",1,0,1,Valerie H.,"Houston, TX",258,40,3

4.0,2/24/2016,"Cafe D'Alsace is a French restaurant with a hearty brunch menu in Upper East Side. First -- fantastic service. I arrived at 10:30AM. I was a half hour late to meet my friend, and my friend was able to sit and wait for me during that time. Our server was extremely nice and didn't rush us throughout our meal. It was great, especially for a popular Yelp restaurant during brunch. The food is traditional American, so if you're looking for pancakes, french toast, waffles, they have it. They also have some interesting choices like shakshuka, and eggs petatou. We split one Belgian waffle and shakshuka and it was a great mix of sweet and savory. The tables are small so our food barely fit on our table, but we didn't mind. If you're already in UES, I'd recommend coming here to try when there isn't a wait.",2,0,0,Sooz A.,"New York, NY",368,525,568

The chicken stuffed with mushrooms and froegrois was devine and the spinach was literally the best vegetable i have ever eaten. The steak frites was also to die for. We would def recommend trying those for sure! Then for dessert we got the chocolate cake and creme brulee which was the perf things to end with.

Granted we were seated super close to the door on a day where it was 10°F outside so we were a bit chilly, but it was all good given how people filled in to wait afterward and actually blocked the air coming into the restaurant. Lol. Food was incredible. They serve you this bread basket, but 1 piece is extremely special... I don't know how to describe it, but it's a soft piece, super buttery and sweet. INCREDIBLE. I had the Choucroute Garnie ($24.00) which is pretty much different sausages, ham and steamed bacon on a bed of sauerkraut served with a spicy mustard. Very good and filling. My guest had the Smoked Salmon Duo ($19.00). The bagel was a little crunchy, but it was very delicious. Our server, David, was super approachable and took care of our every need.

And they had 3 different types of bread! So many options! I ordered the Vietnamese coffee and the smoked salmon Benedict. The coffee was pretty pricy (5$)...usually at Vietnamese restaurants it's 3$. It was a tiny glass and wasn't as strong. The Benedict, on the other hand, was delicious!! It was perfect. I especially appreciated their side of salad in addition to the potatoes. It made the meal feel less heavy! Most restaurants only give potatoes. I'd definitely come back here! The food was great and the service was stellar!

Discovered this gem during RW to my utmost pleasure.Hidden at a corner on the UES (only adds to the charm, may I add), this is one of those cozy, classy, laissez-faire French places we're all too familiar with.With the almond bread as starters, I already surrendered. They were so well-baked! Delicate, flavorful, almost creamy tasting but still puffy. The waiter saw our obsession and kindly brought us a second basket.....The flambee was a tad disappointing as I found them on the greasy and dry side. Friend's winter salad was outstanding though - a very thick layer of avocado paired with prosciutto and artichoke. The combo was heavenly.We both had the bass which I regret - not that the bass wasn't great, but I would really love to have tried the chicken roulade or the cassoulet.Ginger creme brulee was better than the molten chocolate cake, in my opinion.Overall a really positive experience - would definitely come back again.",2,0,1,Arentha C.,"Manhattan, NY",22,103,282

I had the steak and eggs (something I never order) and the meat was perfectly med rare (I didn't even have to order it rare knowing that would mean rare) and the eggs perfectly over easy.

Though there is usually a wait on Saturdays and Sundays it moves quickly and they also allow you to sit at the bar while you wait. They serve an awesome hot chocolate- basically hot milk poured over chunks of dark chocolate. The way it should be. the servers are always attentive (refills before you even are halfway done with a drink, checking in on you, etc). They have a wonderful outdoor patio that gets the perfect amount of sun for those rare nice days. The menu has a great selection- croques, omelettes, benedicts, crepes and pancakes. For lunch there are sandwiches, meat dishes, burgers and more. The salmon Benedict is fantastic. The poached eggs are always cooked perfectly - NEVER overcooked. The hollandaise sauce is not overly creamy and has a nice tang. The roasted potatoes are good- so good that I don't even substitute them for French fries. I love the crispy outsides and the Rosemary.

So we just stood on the corner (the weather was nice enough that we could stand, and eventually sit, outside) and catch up with each other. The wait ended up being only 10ish minutes! YAY! We sat outside, as the interior was completely full and looked too bustling for us to have an easy comversation. I ordered the shakasuka, which came out quickly and had ample eggs/edible sauce, and it was so good that I used some of our table bread to sop up the remaining juices. Can't quite remember what my friend had, but overall affordable and good portions--and great atmosphere! A gem for the upper east side. Our waitress didn't rush us either, as we talked instead of looking at the menu the first few times, and talked instead of leaving, even though there were customers waiting.

4.0,9/27/2015,Cafe D'Alsace has such great food and service. It's an excellent brunch spot. I've been twice already and I've never had to wait very long for a table. The ham and comté crêpe is savoury but not heavy and their café au lait bowl is one of the best that I've had. The grilled chicken sandwich is big and the French fries are crispy and delicious.

5.0,8/19/2015,"The boyfriend took me here for my birthday, so I might be a bit biased because it was a happy occasion, but I'm so so glad I spent it at Cafe D'Alsace! Right when we walked in, I knew it was going to be a good meal. The restaurant has a Frenchy vibe and it's dimly lit. The waiters looked very professional and we were seated promptly. We had forgotten it was restaurant week, so we decided that one of us would order from the restaurant week menu and the other would order a regular entree from their regular menu. We aren't too into dessert, so it didn't make too much sense for both of us to order from the restaurant menu.Here comes the rave for their food. Oh my gosh, their puff cheese bread/pastry thing was phenomenal. I have never had anything like it. It was a fabulous melt-in-your-mouth flaky, airy cloud. The amount of cheese was so slight that it didn't overpower the butteriness of the pastry itself. And oh my, it was heavenly. When I raved about it to my waiter, he snuck us an extra 2 pastries for us! What a wonderful man! He deserves high-fives from the angels who made these puff breads. Our pan-seared soft shell crab was also too much for words. It was so so fresh and so savory. I wanted to stop eating so that I wouldn't finish it all. But alas, the portion was small (just one small crab for the two of us to share), and we had to let it go (i.e. eat it all). Next came the brussels sprouts. Oh my oh my, 3 for 3! We both love brussels sprouts, so I don't know if we're harsher critics or if we're more lenient, but yay for Cafe D'Alsace's brussels sprouts! Now for our entrees. We both ordered choucroutes, I the seafood and he the sausage. All I can say is interesting. I didn't realize I am not a fan of saffron. So not their fault; mine. I love savoy cabbage though, which is what the sausages came with. But the savoy cabbage was cooked with their Riesling-saffron sauce. Darn. The sausages were a hit or miss. Some were good, some were a bit too soft, so the casing was really apparent, which weirded me out a bit. The boyfriend's entree of meat sausages were a bit better than my seafood sausages. All in all, it was a wonderful meal and a splendid experience at Cafe D'Alsace. I want to go back to try their other entrees because I'm curious about their other entrees but mostly because I want to have that heavenly bread and savory soft-shell crab again.",1,1,0,Rosa C.,"New York, NY",85,320,122

Despite the fact that we had a reservation at 730 both my friend and I were running late..we got there about 15 mins after our reserved time, the hostess and waiters in the restaurant were nice enough to still let us get seated right away even when they were really busy and pretty much had a full house!We got seated right away when we got there at one of a 3 people corner table which was nice with lots of space for the two of us. To be honest I actually did not look at the menu before I came in, but my friend picked this place. I was really amused by the quality of food they serve for restaurant week menu!! as you probably already know..usually they don't put their best food/expensive ingredients in this rest week menu but this place surprised me. They did have a great selections of food on the rw menu with huge portions. Def worth the money. It was a fix price of $38 (one appetizer, one entree, one dessert)Drinks. We each got a drink off the flutes menu (bubbles cocktail to be specific) - $11I had the strawberry liquer + bubbles mix - taste a bit like cough syrup to me. but my friend loved itShe got the peach puree with bubbles - i liked this! Both are not very strongWe both started with the soft shell crab as app. Came with a bit of salad. It was pretty flavorful but a bit on the sour side EntreeWas feeling steak, so i got the steak frites. The steak was quite juicy and fries were good!! not soggy at all. came with a side of bone marrow tooo which is my fave!! def hgh quality right there for this price. Very filling I could not finishMy friend got the seafood choucroute. - This one was HUMONGOUS. Comes with a lot of cabbage on the bottom tho. I really liked it! Obviously we couldn't finish.Dessert I had the chocolate cake + pistacchio ice cream - the pistacchio ice cream is SUPER pistacchio-ish..which is great! Seems like they made this themselves if I am correct. I like it a lotMy friend had the peach tart with some sour flavor fruity sorbet (I cant remember what it was sorry) - It was great too!Overall food wise I give it a 4.7 stars.My only complaint is that the servers (person who take our food away) kept coming back every few minutes. Even when we obviously were still eating our food and had a lot left. He came at least 5 times. We felt like we were being rushed out of the restaurant constantly.

2.0,8/12/2015,First time i write review.. and i really didnt want it to be an unpleasant one. I visited this restaurant during restaurant week.Chose soft shelled crab as appetizer.. sauce was good. Crab was properly done but as for their entree..the braised short rib.. the beef is very tough..had a a very hard time chewing and swallowing.. never expected this from a restaurant witha 4 star rating on yelp.And the dessert the sugar on the creme brulee is very burnt/too charred. It was so bitter.. i had to remove it n just eat the creme .which is very disappointing for such a simple dessert to fail on just torching the top coat.It was my first time visiting this restaurant and RW was supposed to let ppl try your menu at a good price.

Upon arrival, the hostesses were friendly and let us select any table we wanted and were promptly seated. Our waiter quickly attended to our table by bringing glasses and water but didn't greet us or crack a smile, which I thought was odd but brushed it off because he looked extremely busy and stressed so he was probably having a bad day. Nonetheless I deducted one star for that because a waiter or waitress should ALWAYS smile (or fake one at least) and try to be personable to the best of their ability. The manager, on the other hand, was the opposite. He walked around the restaurant to make sure everything was running smoothly, stopping to talk to chat with a few customers here and there. Outdoor seating is offered but we chose to sit indoors by the window; we had ample space but it didn't look as spacious for those seated in the main dining area, as the tables are practically right next to each other.

Not a lot of people so early on a Sunday morning, so we got to choose where we sat. The first table we picked had a moth on the seat :(, and after the hostess got rid of the moth, we sat down, didn't like the seat (too hot), and switched to another table. Plus one star for being accommodating! We started with a machiatto... it was very very bitter. Fiance added splenda, which in turn, made it very sour. The machiatto was also very tiny (maybe like 2 mouthfuls). Not a fan. Maybe we just don't know our coffee very well and ordered wrong?Anyways... on to the food. We ordered ham benedict for him, salmon benedict for me, and a side of fries to share. The fries were the best part, very crunchy, nicely fried, perfectly seasoned. Also a large portion of fries, which means very good value (only $5!). I didn't try the ham benedict, assuming it would taste similar to the salmon benedict (just swap out the protein). The eggs that topped the benedicts were small! Maybe it's just a New York thing... this is the second time when I've gone somewhere and seen small eggs. The benedicts aren't the traditional benedicts with English muffin - instead, here they come on top of a piece of brioche toast, which to me, just tasted like hard slice of bread. Didn't think it was anything too special. Wish there was more hollandaise sauce though to make the dish pop. The only flavor was the salmon (overwhelmingly salty), but luckily the eggs on top and the side salad helped a little bit to neutralize the saltiness.

My mom had the two course prix fix (which is offered before 6pm) with the soup de jour and muscles. We were given a cheesy biscuit to start that was really tasty. The escargot was not in the typical presentation I've usually had it in with the shell but instead the meat was simmering in a herbal broth. I would've liked a stronger taste and more garlic, but otherwise, it came very warm and was very appetizing. The steak frites were prepared perfectly and the meat was tender but still well cooked. The side of fries perfectly complemented it. The muscles came steaming hot as well and there was a very generous serving size of them.

4.0,6/24/2015,"Yum! One of my favorite go to places in the UES because of the good food, great service, and relaxed environment. Too often do I decide to go to brunch on a whim in not-so-fashionable-clothing and get dirty looks from fellow foodies. However, this place is classy-casual; you don't have to dress up but don't come in sweats. Everyone is very welcoming and helpful.Food: 4 starsTheir food and drinks are pretty good here. There was only one time I came here and wasn't super happy with what I ate. For starters, I LOVE their cheese board. It is extremely affordable and comes with a wide variety of cheeses to try. The tarte flambee is also really yummy. I give the food 4 stars because I asked for my eggs to be fried, not scrambled, and my steak medium-well but it came on my plate bleeding :( I've been here once or twice for dinner and thought it was decent. I got the Scottish Salmon which was really good, however the server didn't know if it was wild-caught or farm-raised. The NY Strip Steak is pretty good. I wish it had a little more flavor, though. Overall, I would rather come here for brunch or lunch than dinner. Service: 5 starsThe servers are all really nice here. Although I've had a few servers who didn't know what was what, I let it slide because they were honest with me. They weren't trying to BS me with some fake knowledge or made up stuff. When I asked the server if the fish was wild-caught or farm-raised, he honestly said he had no idea and went to go ask a manager. I appreciate that rather than him randomly guessing on the spot. Ambiance/Location: 4.5 starsI like sitting outside on a nice day here. The location is convenient and it is cozy for dinner here. Took off .5 stars because in true NY fashion, they squish 100 tables together in a space meant for 10. I swore I was touching elbows with the gentleman next to me on my last visit.Overall, this is a great find. I will definitely be back.",11,8,6,Zoe Y.,"San Francisco, CA",1013,218,240
1.0,6/24/2015,"We went there for lunch last Friday. The food was acceptable (definitely not the best). The hostess was not friendly and had a holier-than-thou attitude. The main problem that would discourage me from recommending this place to anyone is I got my credit card copied there by one of the wait staff members. One of the waitresses took my credit card when it was time to pay. She must've left it with another person because she was attending to other diners shortly after she took my card. My card was returned by another waiter 5 minutes later. I was even joking with my husband that they are probably copying my card. Lo and behold, that same afternoon, my card company called me about some questionable charges. I had to get my card replaced. I know my card my ""stolen"" by someone at this place because I didn't use my card for a couple of days and it was never out of my possession except the 5 minutes or so it took for the wait staff to charge my card.",2,0,0,Betty W.,"WALL STREET, NY",0,3,0

My French toast was the best I've ever had, though, light and fluffy, garnished with fresh berries and a strawberry or raspberry syrup. The other downside was that we didn't know they couldn't serve mimosas (alcohol) before noon.

4.0,6/13/2015,"I decided to take my mom and my husband out to try the traditional Alsatian cuisine of my mother's heritage. This place was recommended to us by a friend and boy I am glad she did! We each had a drink, entree and desert.Drinks: The drink menu is quite extensive with plenty of wines and beers to suit every palate. Reasonably priced. I had a ginger saison beer on draft and a glass of Alsatian Riesling. My mother also had a glass of the Riesling and my husband had a Dark n' Stormy. True to the claims, Alsatian Riesling is indeed very dry and crisp. It was perfect for a hot summer evening. The Dark n' Stormy, however wasn't dark at all - just rum and ginger beer, no splash of cola or wedge of lime. But my husband said it was still quite good without it. Entrees: I opted for the baeckeoffe, my mother had the choucroute garnie and my husband had a selection of three sausages that came with mashed potatoes and choucroute. The baeckeoffe was amazing! The broth was incredibly flavorful and the entire dish was so filling and so delicious. I would love to have this again in the winter. My mom loved the choucroute garnie and my husband enjoyed the sausages. I had a bite of the choucroute and it was very good. Dessert: After reading so much praise in the reviews for the chocolate gateau cake, I recommended that to my husband since he is a big chocolate lover. So he got that, I got the creme brulee and my mother had the desert special of the day - the name of which I forgot, but it came with a bunch of berries and had a raspberry coulis. All the desserts were amazing and my husband said that the gateau lived up to the rave reviews.Service: The staff were all friendly and pleasant. The restaurant started filling up rather quickly so they seemed a bit harried. But our waiter was attentive and every staff member was quick with a smile and ready to assist.Atmosphere: The place itself is quite lovely and evokes a feeling of casual class. My only complaint is that the seats are very close together and for our party of three in a corner we felt right on top of each other as well as out neighboring guests. I wish the spacing between tables had a wider berth and the tables themselves were a touch bigger. We felt quite cramped, which isn't a pleasant feeling on a hot summer day.Overall, I give this place 4 our of 5 stars. The cuisine is delicious and while a touch pricey, it's still reasonable for the quality you receive. This is a wonderful place for small groups of 4 people and under, but I wouldn't recommend it for larger groups. The classy atmosphere makes it ideal for a date night out.

Ok lezgo- ordered the crab omelette and the Croque Madame. The omelette was interesting because avocado and crab aren't the most flavorful foods around. But then dat cream cheese crept up on yo boi like nobody's business- very subtle like a ninja. But overall taste id say B. Then the Croque Madame which is the French sandwich with an egg on the top. The bread was crisp and not overly soggy even with the yolk loosening. Ingredients were pretty nice but it didn't blow me away. Side salad was standard. But then Crunchy crunch crisp thin Frenchy French fries! I like my fries a little crunchy so I was a fan! Portions were solide but the price at $17 a dish before tip and tax was hefty for the quality of the food.

OK, but wait, our usual table became open just a few minutes later. Sheesh.Even worse, and what REALLY set me off, one of the two hostesses who showed us tables didn't even provide menus. And not just to us, but to every table she sat. Now, they may have a different system, but we sat at a table (our preferred table was now open, remember) with no menus, no welcome, no waiter, nada, totally ignored for 15 minutes.

This was regrettable because we should all have ordered our own. It was SO GOOD. The combination of pears-chocolate-mint-whipped cream was refreshing, light, and the perfect amount of sweet. I then had the Maryland Crab Omelette ($16) with avocado, corn, and cheese. The portion was huge and there was an ample amount of quality crab. The whole thing was creamy and I was killing myself trying to finish it all. (This is a matter of wanting more deliciousness in my mouth but also feeling too full to function, people!)

Our waiter was very nice and informed us of the specials for the night. We ordered the bone marrow and the salmon carpaccio for appetizers and the duck la'orange and oxtail for entree with a side of wild mushrooms. The bone marrow was absolutely delicious. The bone marrow was rich in flavor and loved the bread that was served with it. I especially appreciated the sea salt on the side that we could add to the marrow to give it a little bit more seasoning depending on our liking. The salmon carpaccio was pretty good. The sashimi slice was a little on the thick side and the vinaigrette was a bit too tart but overall I enjoyed the dish and the nice portion of avocado that it was served with. The duck entree was OK. I would have liked if the duck breast had a cleaner cut and wasn't served with the bone. It was cooked to a nice temperature but needed a bit more searing on the skin to give it a nice crisp. The oxtail was pretty good with a wonderful sauce. I think the oxtail needed to braise for a little longer so that the meat would be more tender but overall it was tasty. The wild mushrooms were done nicely, sautéed with nice seasoning and loved the variety of mushrooms in it. I think in general the dishes were a bit under seasoned but that was an easy fix with the salt shaker. We finished off the meal with the cherry creme brûlée which done nicely.

Not sure if it's due to Restaurant Week or not, but the quality of food left some to be desired. I ordered the Seafood Bisque, Steak dish, and Flourless Chocolate Cake. The bisque was very watery and the consistency was just not right for a bisque. Maybe they ran out of soup and decided to add water? That's what it seemed like, at least. The steak dish comes with a steak filet, gratin, and oxtail. It was alright. The duck dish my mom got was much better. The highlight of the night was definitely my dessert! The flourless chocolate cake was surprisingly light for a flourless cake. It reminded me a heavier lava cake, and it came with raspberry sauce and a side of vanilla icecream.

It was the most flavorful sausage I've ever tasted, nice cumin and middle eastern notes in it, I wish I had ordered this.

Came here last night again as it was close by and I couldn't be bothered to to walk elsewhere. Ended up doing the restaurant week menu.Place has a nice ambiance, always pretty busy, good wine n beer list.Started with the seafood soup, had saffron in it I think. VERY FIRST BITE. Crunch crunch crunch. Meh. Clearly some oyster wasn't cleaned well and I was getting some lovely grit. Sad face. Date had the endive salad which was thumbs up tho. Clean, light, nice bleu cheese on it to give it some balance.Main - I got the seafood risotto. Fair amount of lobster, 2 scallops (one seared nicely, the other with hardly any sear, wassup wit dat?). Was decent, but prefer a creamier risotto. Also would have preferred if the dish came out hotter than it did. Date got the duck l'orange. Duck was cooked very nicely. Flavor profile of the dish seemed a lil lacking/ muted. Would have preferred something stronger. Overall both dishes were good, but I wouldn't order either again. Also felt that there was a bit of salt lacking on most of the items (something I've probably never commented) except on the taters that were with the duck.Dessert - Got the chocolate cake n ice cream. Fuck. Me. I'm not a big dessert orderer and I'm not really a chocolate person. This thing was AWESOME. It looked like it'd be this dense, boring overly chocolatey cake. WRONG. Fluffy and light, piping hot, delicate and just... happiness in chocolate form which goes fantastic with vanilla ice cream. By far the best part of the meal and I'll be thinking about this for the next few days. Seriously, order this.Date got the sorbets, all of which were great as well. Passion fruit one was so passion fruity, I could picture myself actually eating a fresh one.They give you a very nice portion of it as well. Waiter was very personable, Antonio I think his name was (altho pssst, you say bonsoir at night, not bonjour =p )So this place is closer to a 4, but I just wish I fell in love with the mains here on a more regular basis. They have a gruyere burger here that is awesome which I recommend for lunch. To the owner / chef - I once had a rack of lamb here that was amazing. I've never seen it on the menu on my return trips.

4.0,2/28/2015,"Came for Restaurant Week with my boyfriend last night, we arrived promptly at 8:30 for our reservation but they told us they were running a bit behind schedule and we were given the option to take a seat at the bar or on a bench. We opted for the ladder and after 20 minutes were taken to our table. We didn't think much about the wait since it was a Friday night at prime dinner time, however upon being seated 2 glasses of champagne were brought to our table to apologize for the wait time which we really appreciated and was a great touch to start the meal!For appetizers he had the Gnocchi Parisienne and I had the Saffron Seafood Bisque. He really liked the Gnocchi and I enjoyed the bisque, however it was a bit thin and I was expecting a thicker, richer soup. Still good but not sure if this would be my choice next time around.Entrees were the Black Angus Beef Duo for him and the Duck l'Orange for me. His beef was good and well cooked to a medium rare. I thought my duck was delicious and appreciated them cooking it to my preference on the rarer side rather than just a flat medium. The duck didn't have a ton of citrus notes in it, but I still thought the sauce was really tasty.For dessert we had the Creme Brulee and Chocolate Gateau - both very good and an enjoyable way to end the meal.Also to note - we had a bottle of the cheapest red wine on the menu (a Beaujolais for $42) and it was actually really good, they also didn't seem perturbed that we just ordered the cheapest bottle as some restaurants do. We would definitely come back for a nicer occasion or night out.

3.0,2/20/2015,"Went to Cafe D'Alsace for restaurant week, 2015.  Was rather disappointed upon ordering cause they surprisingly didn't have two of the three dishes that I wanted to order and it was the first day of Restaurant Week.  Plus, on top of that, it was near opening when we went.  If they don't plan on being ready to serve it, why put it on their RW menu?The ambiance reminds me more of an American diner (especially cause of the diner-like booths), and it can get quite loud.  The service can be somewhat slow too.Moving on to the food.  For the appetizer, I got the homemade grilled Merguez sausage.  The sausage was grilled perfectly and seasoned very well.  The dill mustard on the side added a kick and flare to the sausages too, so use it sparingly.  The sauerkraut was good but the portion served was a bit too much.I ended up getting the grilled filet of sea bass for my entree.  The meat of the fish was tender but it didn't taste like it was actually grilled.  The skin of the fish wasn't crispy at all.  The fish was served on top of a bed of tender veggies.  While I appreciated it, the dish lacked texture overall and was a bit heavy due to the cheesy sauce.I also had a bite of my friend's seafood risotto.  The texture was creamy but heavy as well.For dessert, I ordered the homemade ice cream & sorbet.  It came with a scoop of vanilla, caramel, and coffee ice cream, along with two shortbread-like cookies.  The ice cream flavors were spot on and creamy.  The shortbread cookies were good too but could've been softer.",0,0,0,Nathaniel L.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",74,80,178

4.0,1/26/2015,"I have to say, I'm very happy I came back for dinner! The restaurant had a completely different vibe! It was relaxed, calm and quiet and not crazy like it was for brunch!The vibe was dark, romantic and there was definitely an older crowd, but c'est-la-vie!We started off with the tart flambé. Yum! Pretty much a bacon pizza and really what's not to love?! After we each had a bowl of the butternut squash soup which was a special for the day. It was good, not as thick as I would've wanted it to be, but had great flavor. Afterwards, we shared the winter salad. This salad had everything in it and it was fantastic! It had such an odd combo of items in it that I would never think to put together but it went so well! For our entrée, we shared the choucroute garnie (aka sausage fest). This dish was MASSIVE. Meat on meat on meat, over a very delicious mound of sauerkraut. The sausages ranged from traditional to unique and I couldn't tell you which I liked the best because I'm not sure which was which. I tried them all and there was so much leftover! We had the brussel sprouts on the side, which were obviously served with bacon. (I really think I was sweating bacon at the gym the next day). The brussel sprouts melted in your mouth, I think they were my favorite dish of the evening. We were busting, but dessert came and it was the flourless chocolate gateau which I swore I only was going to have one bite of! Well, I left one bite. It was so, so good. The service was impeccable, our waiter was extremely helpful and informative when we had questions about the menu. Overall, I'd definitely suggest this place for dinner over brunch.

It's just the right mix of good with a little bid of bad to set things straight for the work week to come. Part of my distaste for brunch is that I'm sick of seeing nearly the same menu everywhere, but Cafe D'Alsace menu is vast and makes things a lot more interesting than the standard French bistro fare with some of its dishes clearly German influenced (hence, the region of Alsace). Don't care for a gruyere omelette? Perhaps a German pancake would interest you, or maybe a tarte flambee?Whatever it is that's up your brunch alley, I'm sure Cafe D'Alsace has you covered.

I ordered the chicken sandwich, which was open-faced, and a large portion. It came with fries and salad, and the fries were authentic double-fried French fries.

We ordered a handful of dishes and sort-of shared family style. With a sample of their sausage, salmon eggs benedict, and French toast, our party left mostly satisfied. Sausage could have been better considering the selection and the salmon was a bit on the smoked side. But that French toast...so fluffy, flavorful, and fabu*. I would return based on that dish alone. Wait times and loud, sometimes family-oriented, crowd can be off-putting but their brunch is worth at least one fair try. The bright side is if you end up disappointed in the atmosphere, you won't be disappointed in their French toast.*Did I really just say fabu in a review? Did that line really rhyme?

4.0,8/8/2014,"This restaurant has it all. I came here for dinner during the weekday and it was packed with people coming in from a rainy night in NYC. I loved the ambiance of the place. The lighting, not too dark, paired with the small tables, endless chatter from other diners transported me back a few years ago when I sampled French food for the first time at the Hotel du Nord. The only exception were the billows of cigarette smoke from each table. It took quite a long time for our order to be taken. I would say the wait was approximately 10-15 minutes before we saw the waiter again. But once we placed our order everything else fell into place. For appetizer, we ordered the French Onion Soup and a 3-cheese platter with grapes, walnut raisin bread and berry chutney. I was very random with my choice of the cheeses and tried Roquefort, Beaufort d'Alpage, and Valancey. I thought it was a very diverse taste difference between each with flavors ranging from salty and nutty to buttery. The entree picks were grilled trout filet almondine and roasted duck breast. I had tasted other trout dishes before and this one seemed to be slightly on the overcooked/dry side. Perhaps because it was grilled? As for the duck breast, it was deliciously paired with some seasonal vegetables. I loved the surprising flavors of the sweet raspberries with the well-seasoned potatoes. Every meal needs a happy ending and I experienced that with the molten chocolate gateau. The pistachio ice cream that accompanied it was superb. I actually had 2 chocolate desserts that night as we also decided to try the chocolate tart. Yes, I have a second stomach for desserts only :) In total the amount spent for a dinner for 2 was about $110, which included french onion soup, 3-cheese platter, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, and 1 cafe latte.",1,0,1,Richel R.,"Queens, NY",63,109,316

The texture of the salmon, however, was on target: soft, moist, and easily breakable.  My mother ordered the Roasted Duck Breast medium rare, but it came out borderline rare. It was slightly rubbery in my mouth, but overall the flavors were really good there. For dessert, I got a scoop of pistachio ice cream, which had a general nutty flavor (almonds, some pistachio).

Really, people, don't give out long elaborate lists of wines that aren't available.  Rather than recite the specials, the waiter told us which menu items were not available. So they aren't just out of 2/3 of the wines we asked for, they are short on regular menu items as well. Food  was ok, but nothing great.

I wouldn't say the service was the best because for a brunch that's on the pricier side, I would expect more polite waitresses who smile more. Most of them actually looked grumpy working at 24hour diners. The outdoor seating was very nice but we didn't get a spot there. The Madison omelette was okay. I wouldn't get it again. The goat cheese was all lumped on one side and the spinach on the other. So my omelette had an inconsistent taste going from bland and stringy to salty and mushy. The eggs Benedict was decent but on the smaller side for the price maybe? The potatoes on this plate were better cooked than the burnt ones on my plate with the omelette.  The ham and poached eggs were cooked well and gave a good balance. The Apple pancakes were the best. It was very moist had a good thickness. Each pancake is the size of your two palms with no sides but this got my friend really full. The sweetness of the apples and syrup were not overpowering. I do recommend getting this fish if you are in the mood for pancakes. I was not wowed by anything much at Cafe D'Alsace  except for the moisty pancakes but I would come back if I'm feeling lazy to go further out of my neighborhood to look for a brunch spot with nice ambience.

Disproportionate amount of cheese to other ingredients, perhaps to hide the messily thrown-together omelette?My brunch partner did not complain about his choucroute garnie ($20) -- he's a trooper like that -- but I can tell it was not what he was expecting.

Indoors was quite full but we got seated right away at the time of 11:20 am.  This place has plenty of high chairs and booster chairs. Not those wooden high chairs or nice booster chairs like in Kyu-Gaku, and the high chair we got was a bit dirty which we could totally tell it didn't get cleaned from last time's use, but we were just happy that the restaurant carries those for kids, and they are very friendly to children. We order three dishes, Salmon egg Benedict, Ham and Comte crepe, and Frisee Aux Lardons (double smoked bacon salad). All were really good! Both benedict and salad came with two poached eggs- they were all so well-done and perfect that we were just happy with the quality of it here. Salmon egg Benedict came with not just perfect poached eggs but a great amount of the salmon and the bread underneath was flavorful and with just the right texture, not too saggy and not too hard. The overall combination is impressive, and it is one of the best Benedicts I had in NYC for sure. It came with potatoes and some greens, and these potatoes were very well-seasoned and baked that someone like me who never tastes/tries more than one or two pieces of potato finished all of it. Ham and Comte crepe is one of another great experiences we had here. It is SO good - the flavor, the texture of the crepe, and every pieces of ham and mushrooms in it. Cafe D'Alsace donesnt have kids menu, so we ordered this for our 19m and 5yo to share, and it's such a great idea! It came with huge amount of food, and both kids LOVED it, including my husband and I. We would totally go back there just for this. Finally, the bacon salad. It looks just ok, like all the other salads, but tastes really outstanding with the bacons, sauce, and the poached eggs. The atmosphere is loud and cozy, it got crowded around noon, because the seating area were tightly used, but it's a great place for both family with kids and young adults.",0,0,0,Aeeza L.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",19,115,2137

5.0,4/20/2014,"If you linger long enough outside, every patron on their way in will pause and tell you how good the place is. We knew, as we had just finished dinner there. The rave reviews just instilled how special Cafe D'Alsace was. I can't wait to go back!My first experience with Cafe D'Alsace was a to go dessert of chocolate tart. In its little plastic container, all the components were included for our at home gourmet makeshift meal: the tart, creme anglaise, chocolate cigarette, and caramel ice cream. It was a real treat and time saver after slaving away over a hot stove.My birthday dinner finished with that same tart. I didn't realize it. I thought I had ordered something else but when I saw and tasted the rich chocolaty goodness I said, ""Yup, that was the one."" All the memories had resurfaced.It'd be silly to walk into Cafe D'Alsace thinking you'd have a light meal. Just go all out as the French do. We started with the Merguez sausage. It was spicy lamb with sauerkraut and mustard. Perfection. Our entrees, the grilled trout filet almondine and the D'Alsace burger was equal in flavor. The trout was rich in butter (but extremely delicate) and the burger was juicy on a buttery brioche bun. To be extra French, order the burger with gruyere or alsatian muenster cheese. The ambiance is calm and a little too close to be comfortable. Nonetheless, it is New York and Cafe D'Alsace does its best to mimic a cute and cozy bistro.

I got a fresh squeezed orange juice and a bretonne crêpe with ham, compté and two eggs sunny side up. Well, the juice was from  a box, watered down and stale - maybe that's supposed to mimic fresh squeezed????The crêpe was clearly made yesterday, not fresh and they just added the (again previously prepared ingredients) and it was a sweet crêpe not a plain or salty one, which would have matched the salty ingredients here (probably because all their other types of crêpes are sweet and it's easier to pre-prepare them, they make them all sweet!!!) and the eggs were not properly cooked and therefore the whole construct paired with the wilted salad on the side made for a wholly disgusting taste and presentation.

Steak fritte was missing salt, pepper, any kind of flavor. I got the muscles which were too salty and too strong of flavors. Not a fan for dinner here. Service didn't make up for the unmemorable dinner we had..There is also so much hype for their brunch and the line is usually pretty long on the weekends so expect to come early or wait 30+ minutes for a table. We had an awful, awful, awful waitress that we will never forget.  She never came by to refill our coffee. She literally disappeared for most of our meal. The croque madame was actually amazing. The sunnyside up egg is the perfect amount of runnyness. The gruyere cheese mixed with the ham and toast is just mouth watering. I love the side of greens with a nice dressing as well as roasted potatoes. I can never finish it all. Also you will start with a basket of fresh bread and jam.

Combined with the excellent, friendly service and the extensive beer list, this place just hits all my buttons.  The only glaring flaws are the reverberate decor which amplifies the usually crowed dining room and the less than wallet-friendly prices.

The service was very good and the menu was fairly extensive, but I was disappointed at what I ordered.I decided to go with two apps--the bone marrow and the whole artichoke. I really enjoy bone marrow, but much prefer when the bone is cut long ways. This bone I had to dig deep in to get the marrow out, and was definitely unable to get a lot of it out. It also had a lot of more congealed fat--all in all, it was not quality bone marrow.The artichoke was unique--I rarely see this option on a menu. However, I would have preferred if the artichoke was roasted so that I could enjoy more of it. It came with a decent, yet not overly flavorful aioli sauce.My friend got the mussels and chocolate profiteroles, both of which I tried and which were pretty good.The bread was excellent.I don't have a strong desire to return since there are so many other places to try, but I wouldn't be upset if did--I would just definitely make sure to order different items.",2,1,1,Nikki A.,"New York, NY",267,500,31

Our visit began with dirty silverware, which can happen to anyone I guess. But the steak frites was bland and the fries were anything but French. The duck confit was dry and the accompanying risotto unremarkable. And while service was friendly - very friendly - it was not prompt.

For appetizers, we got the cheese puffs or gougeres which really is just cheesey bread or ""crispy gruyere cheese puffs. I was slightly upset that they weren't actual cheese puffs and were small rolls of bread. Delicious, light baked goods but still not what I had expected. I decided not to go with restaurant week menu so I ordered the steak frites, my sister ordered the 3 sausages (you can order 1 for $10 or 2 for $16 or 3 for $19) and sides. My mom ordered the king crab salad (which is actually under appetizers and not salads). The sausages were delicious and came with a bunch of different dipping sauces - one being a regular mustard and another just being a spicy mustard. We ordered the regular pork, the mix of pork and the beef and the chicken. The pork sausage was the best one while the others were good as well. Steak frites were good but nothing memorable. We finished the fries. I most definitely could not finish it so doggie bagged the rest of it and gave it to my boyfriend. Crab salad was small but it was good. Definitely something to eat if you want to eat light and not care that you're spending  $15 on it. For dessert, we ordered the creme brulee and the berry crumble. The blackberries in the crumble were huge! Portions were generous and delicious. This place is basically an upscale french diner. The menu is huge that there's something for everyone.

It was delicious.  Bf got the smoked trout mixed in with egg whites, which wasn't the best dish.  My sister got a breakfast sammich which really enjoyed.  Coffee was fresh and solid, with free refills, thank you very much!  They even give you bread basket to start.  A nice touch for brunch.  This is silly to note but I even loved the silverware and glasses.

4.0,5/16/2013,"as both a history buff and a fan of eating delicious food, you bet I enjoyed the blend of French & Germanic influences here.a fairly large but tightly packed bistro, Cafe D'Alsace serves an interesting menu inspired by both nations which have historically controlled this territory. flambee, duck, seafood, and cheese dishes are countered by sausage and other hearty meat platters.I wasn't feeling so well when we came here, so I limited my dinner to just one rolled meat product - boudin blanc sausage, a blend of veal and pork. it reminded me of weisswurst, which I am a fan of, and certainly hit the spot.I'm not really a sauerkraut person, so I skipped that, but the mustard provided with the sausage was quite potent. I wondered if ""the spice must flow"" has been translated into a battle cry for either the French or Germans.service was great, and the prices are quite fair especially considering the vastness of the menu.my only real gripe is that it can get a bit packed in here. I had the misfortune of being adjacent to a table where the wife was nagging the husband the entire night, and I felt like I might have to wage an intervention. alas, Alsace-Lorraine!I'll be back.",4,2,5,Mike B.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",187,1514,175

Still, the braised short rib with creamed cauliflower was to die for.

I wish it came with coffee or juice. I found the crowd here is mostly the neighbors. They have many regular customers and they're kids friendly.

Checked out the menu online, and waltzed on in for a great meal, about as good as you can get anywhere.   Was thrilled to see they had duck choucroute on the menu. Nobody in my family likes duck except me, and I LOVE it. This was lovely duck leg confit, breast and sausage, served on sauerkraut and taters. A basket of homemade bread, some nice draft ale, and oo-la-la. Nice and hearty on a cold night in early spring.   A couple of nice, accommodating guys behind the bar were generous with the samples, and seated next to me were regulars, who raved about the chef, and rightly so.

3.0,2/24/2013,"Tried brunch here.  We showed up at around 1:30pm, had about a 20 minute wait since we did not make a reservation, but luckily found seats at the bar and got to try their cocktails.  They were okay but the cocktail drinks menu isn't well thought out.  Ordered the pain au chocolat (fantastic) and Omelette d'Alsace.  Brunch was great but I thought the big chunks of sausage came across a bit too overpowering and didn't do justice to the gruyere cheese.  The service was average (our waitress was very friendly but the kitchen seemed slammed, and it took a while to get the food).Went back for dinner. Ordered the bone marrow and lamb shank. The bone marrow was amazing and the portion was more than expected. The lamb shank came with risotto which was slightly undercooked to my liking but was otherwise good.  The entree portion was also on the generous side.The overall ambiance is a little too loud and too big.  We felt a bit crammed both of the times (the tables are set a little too close to each other), so I couldn't really enjoy my meal and the company.  The quality of food is definitely great, but the overall experience is a bit too stressful.  Not the type of place that I can put on my short list.",1,0,1,Son D.,"Scottsdale, AZ",41,26,0

The bf and I stopped by around 1:30pm on a Thursday afternoon and was seated promptly. We noticed that the tables are all pretty wobbly and there wasn't much of a younger crowd, maybe given it was a random weekday afternoon.The food was a little above par. We started off with the calamari and venison sausage. I really liked the calamari in the pesto sauce but the bf was pretty indifferent about it--he liked the sausage more (men and their meat). For his second course, he got the filet mignon with mash potatoes. I was pretty surprised when it came out because they had chopped it up into pieces. It was just okay for me and he ended up taking it all home because he had stuffed himself for breakfast. As for me, I got the John Dory which was very moist and tender. I did like the lemon butter sauce and the rice medley that was under it but I thought the capers were a little overpowering. For dessert, he got the ice cream, that came with three scoops (he asked to be surprised), and I got the molten chocolate gateau. The desserts were solid and I enjoyed the pistachio ice cream that came with mine. The molten chocolate cake was ultra rich so that is a definite yes for a sweet tooth.3.5 stars if I could.

3.0,12/9/2012,"I wanted to go here for the longest time and finally got my chance; the results were a mixed bag but I would go back to try some of the other options.  While my wife's French Onion Soup was very good, 12.00 is a bit rough for a small bowl of soup.  On the other hand, my appetizer was a complete and utter disaster.  Steak Tartare, thank god I only ordered the appetizer portion.  First of all, the way it was plated, it looked like dog food.  Not appetizing looking at all.  It looked like it had been pressed out of a can, perfectly round.  Very odd.  Secondly, it was WAY over-seasoned and WAY over-marinated, it had the consistency of a ceviche, I simply could not taste the meat.  A simple dish that was way, way too complicated.  My Choucroute garnie was adequate, did not exactly blow me away.  There was a lot of fat on the ham and the slab bacon was not edible.  The various sausages were quite good and the sauerkraut braised in Riesling was very tasty. The highlight of the evening was my wife's Duck l'Orange, it was perfect in every way.  Well seasoned, cooked perfect with an excellent vegetable medley and near perfect mashed potatoes.  I had high expectations and was a little disappointed.  That being said, again, I would like to go back and try some of their other dishes.  A couple of things to note, the space is a lot smaller than it looks on the outside and is packed very tight.  It is a tad on the darkish side as well.  They have an extensive beer menu, unfortunately I did not feel like drinking.  Service was very good, appetizers and entrees came out lightening fast which can be interpreted one of two ways.  A solid 3.",0,0,0,Rob S.,"Manhattan, NY",42,267,92

It included duck confit, two types of duck  sausage and some duck meat. Truly wonderful! The beans were cooked just right (not too mushy), the sausage was beautifully herbed and meaty, and the confit fabulous (not dried out, as it sometimes is.)Our server was very good as was the sommelier, who offered good advice on wine.

My gf fish was ok not to great but she also has a problem always ordering the fish with veg which yes is a plain dish in it self but still we can make it taste a little better but over all it was ok. Then we came for breakfast which we liked alot pretty good food there. 2 weeks after that we went for dinner again and the food wasn't as good as before my duck was over over come the wine was coked and the veg I had my gf had as well on her fish.

In hopes of mixing up the brunch experience, I stopped with a friend early on a recent Saturday (well, at 10:00am but I think that's early for brunch). The restaurant itself is a charming caricature of  a Parisian brasserie. Richly detailed décor includes an tin ceilings, antique French product posters, smoke glass mirrors and a colorful tiled floor. Fortunately, the restaurant was only about 20% occupied when we got there since I suspect it would be simply booming with echoes if it was packed (all these hard surfaces! - sorry, I'm an architect so I think of these things). The menu presents an eclectic French offering including several interesting Alsatian specialties like charcuterie garnie and other things involving sauerkraut (sorry, was that glib?). Looking to try something new, I went with the Eggs Nicoise Gratinee which was two poached eggs served over ratatouille with melted gruyere on top. It was actually a pretty simple dish, but the flavors and textures worked wonderfully together, especially with some of the nice French bread they give you to sop the mixture up. My friend went with a goat cheese and mushroom omelet which was simply enormous and served with flavorful home fries and a small baby greens salad. Service was attentive and fast, with coffee refills aplenty and a relaxed vibe. I can certainly see why Café D'Alsace is so well-loved in the neighborhood and I am so glad I gave it a try.

A phenomenal beer list with over a dozen beers you probably cannot get anywhere else in America. Belgian and French beers are highlighted. There is wine here too, of course, but go with the thrill of drinking a $40 bottle of beer ;)Alas, we had perhaps the worst waiter we have ever experienced. Christopher had a lousy attitude and all but ignored us. We had to wait 42 minutes for our first food after our order while other tables with other waiters got their food in less than half the time. (drinking a $40 bottle of beer helped us through our wait) Our marvelous food arrived and we didn't see Christopher again for the next hour. Interestingly, another waiter from another section of the restaurant finally came over, rather concerned, to ask us if we needed anything.  Then suddenly Christopher came running to pretend to care about us.

(*Ask for the fries on a separate plate/bowl, they get soggy). The homemade sorbet.........I got three heaping scoops of the most tart, flavor-packed, succulent fruit sorbet I've ever had. Gee, thanks for being 90 miles away -_- The staff was pretty genuinely friendly. Even though we stayed past the closing time on a Wednesday night, nobody rushed us.

They came to tell us that our server would be with us soon, which was nice to know we finally were noticed and got a couple glasses of water, but it took another 20 minutes until our server was able to take our order. They give complimentary toast, which I really liked. Their toast was delicious especially with their jam. We ordered their fresh squeezed orange juice, which was very delicious and came quickly. I ordered their Salmon Benedict, which in my opinion was delicious. Their eggs were cooked perfectly and the smoked salmon wasn't too salty.

He quickly brought us tap water and took our coffee order.  This is when things slowed down.I suppose because it was such a busy brunch (Easter Sunday, mind you), there were a number of lengthy waits. First we waited 10 minutes to have out meal order taken- we selected the cheese board, I chose the crepe, and my date chose the eggs nicoise. We waited about 25 minutes for out orders to come. It was a little disheartening watching so many others have their meals served and we could only gaze longingly whilst smacking our lips in hope.Thankfully, it was incredibly delicious once it arrived. The crepe I had used a chestnut whipped cream with fruit and chocolate sauce. The eggs nicoise had a perfect hollandaise over a bed of ratatouille. Once again, amazing.  We waited another 15 minutes after we finished so we could pay the check.I suppose in the end, it was worth waiting both for spending time on a date and for appreciating the cuisine, though the wait staff could have been a but more attentive throughout.

I ordered the scallop for an appetizer, mushroom ravioli for the entree, and tatin for dessert. Completely over the top amazing! My friend's tuna (which I had a big bite of) was incredible.

3.0,1/31/2012,I was really surprised to see all of the high ratings for this restaurant but I realized a lot of them are for their brunch menu which I haven't yet tried. I came here for dinner and was pretty underwhelmed. My boyfriend was extremely impressed with the beer menu and he ordered a Sophie which is rare to see out. The food tasted like regular tavern/pub food (overly buttered and oiled and lacking in flavor). I had the salmon and I was pretty unimpressed with the meal. The service was lacking- we found ourselves waiting way past an hour to get our dinner. Overall- nothing exceptional but I may come back to try the restaurant for brunch since I am in the neighborhood quite often.,0,0,0,Rachel T.,"New York, NY",4,113,1

4.0,1/25/2012,"This is by far my favorite restaurant in the Yorkville area. In a neighborhood that is somewhat desperate for delicious and creative places to eat, Cafe D'Alsace rarely lets me down. The dinner menu is always delicious. I haven't had a bad dinner there yet. Brunch/Lunch is also pretty darn good but I found the egg dishes to be a little small in portion size. The Burger D'Alsace is on the top of most ""Best Burgers in NYC"" lists and rightfully so. It is large and in charge. I'm drooling just thinking about all the sausages, escargots, seafood paella....man there is just something for everyone on their menu. My girlfriend is a vegetarian...even she thinks its the best place to eat too in the neighborhood. They also have a killer beer menu (with great stuff on tap) and a very nice, affordable selection of wine.

2.0,1/24/2012,"I had high hopes for this place but it was not my cup of tea. Let me start off by saying I don't usually travel past 65th St since it feels like another world so I had hoped my travels would lead me to great food. I came here for Restaurant Week and chose it based on its special menu. My guest and I were running late and they were nice enough to accommodate us. We ordered the sea scallops on truffled mashed potato appetizer but what came was 1 scallop so its a bit misleading when you list it as plural. We then ordered some escargot which was was drenched in butter and what seemed like aioli. Not bad but not the traditional way especially as I was eating I felt guilty for all the butter I was ingesting. We ordered the mushroom ravioli and the ground chicken burger and both were okay but nothing to rave about. The dishes all seemed to be missing the pizzaz ingredient. The mushroom ravioli dish was really plain raviolis with mushrooms on top, not mushroom stuffed raviolis as we had thought. For dessert we ordered the Tarte Tatin and the chocolate hazelnut tarte. The Tatin seemed like it was heated in a microwave as it was a bit difficult to use a fork to split. The hazelnut tarte wasn't bad. The service was decent. One thing that I didn't like were the tables were so close you could hear the conversations next to you and some people were loud talkers while people of larger build would have their butts touch your table when they were squeezing out. The restaurant was quite crowded when I left but it was 8:30pm on a Friday night so I would hope so. All in all, I will not be going back but others may have different palates than mine.",0,0,0,Michelle T.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,46,0

No such luck. That would have been no problem, had the food been decent. Unfortunately, it was mediocre at best.Lamb chops with goat cheese mashed potatoes, spinach and roasted tomatoes: burnt on the outside, almost raw inside. I love my meat medium rare but this was just inedible. I also didn't care for the potatoes as they were incredibly salty (even for my husband, who actually loves salty food) and kind of gooey, leaving me wonder how long ago they had been prepared...Pan seared skate fish with aged port reduction, coco beans and vegetables: seriously overcooked. The port reduction with skate didn't work for me but that might just be personal preference. At least the veggies were tasty and crunchy.It's sad to leave a restaurant feeling like I could have cooked the same meal and it would have been remarkably better. Maybe it was because we came here on a quiet Sunday night and the chef was off. Maybe they cook better on other nights.

Favorites on menu (I've only been here for brunch):Mushroom Omelette with Comte cheese - probably my favorite way to have comte cheese, which is pretty pungentEggs Benedict - solid benedict hereFrittata D'Lyon - BEST THING I've had here - made with rosette d'lyon (a French strongly spiced sausage) and caramelized onions. I've never ordered the Eggs Petatou (poached eggs over roasted potatoes and cheese) but my friends who have say it's ""unlike any other breakfast dish they've had"".

Love the Chocolate Croissant - I get this when I'm particularly starving. :D Lastly, the coffee here is strong and delicious.

3.0,10/18/2011,"I was extremely underwhelmed by this place. First there was the issue with the ham and cheese croissant. My friend asked for a croissant and said he would pay extra if they could put some ham and cheese on it. The waiter said he'd ask but he knew the answer would be no (quite unapologetically I might add). Alas, the chef's answer was no. I'm not quite sure how ham and cheese, even on the side, would ruin the integrity of a plain croissant but I guess it is what it is. Finally the waiter said they would be willing to put melted cheese on the side but wouldn't cut the croissant or heat them together. I can't make this up... it was a little outrageous. My friend declined and we ordered our meals. I got the mushroom omelet with potatoes. I will say the potatoes were really yummy. The omelet on the other hand was dry and overcooked. That's something I'd stay at home for... It was pretty expensive for something that wasn't very good.My other friend got a sandwich that came with french fries. His fries were cold to the touch. Not warm, not room temperature -- COLD. We got another side of new french fries but the waiter was not apologetic at all. My boyfriend's apple pancakes were really delightful and I will say that is about the only thing that I was extraordinary. Everything was extraordinary or worse.

4.0,9/21/2011,"Go to a French restaurant anywhere and what you find is a homily rather than scripture.  Traditional flavors and ingredients are disavowed for the convenience and salability of local preferences.  Yes, I know what fusion is, but goddammit, this is French food we're talking about.  If you put anything other than gruyere in my soup, you better bring a towel along for the ride.Alsace is a very small region of France along the eastern border of Germany, and is heavily influenced by Germanic culinary traditions. Unsurprisingly, the area is known for both sauerkraut as well as foie gras. It also produces many wines and is noted for its dry rieslings.  It is also one of the most prolific beer producing regions of France as well.  Like the architecture from where it hails, the layout of the restaurant is classically French with perhaps a touch of whimsy.  Timber and bright grains are everywhere, polished to a sheen, giving the guest a warm and opulent feeling.  The floor is stone, once again hearkening to the classical themes of Alsace.  An elegantly curved bar sits at one side of the restaurant, with antique and colorful bottles suspended overhead on a wood-framed track lighting rail.  The occasional beer poster, well framed and manicured, is hung in good taste, reminding you that despite an impressive wine list, d'Alsace also serves over a hundred beers.  Yes, they thought the theme through very carefully.  For that alone, I upped the rating a point.And now for the food.French Onion Soup:  Alas, it was too sweet for me.  I almost think that they simmered the soup with riesling.  I salted it down but it was not a happy experience.  Although the gruyere was... how do we say... magnifique.Tuna Tartare:  This is a dish that is hard to mess up, as long as your tuna and your other ingredients are of good quality.  And yet... despite the fact that the tuna was a lush, deep red, the avocado was a brilliant and creamy green, and the dish looked like an invitation to a savory dreamworld, the flavor was flat.  Unremarkable.  It was twice as painful given how absolutely delicious it looked.  Alas my broken heart. Goat Cheese Tatin:  Not what I expected, but in a good way.  In a good, savory, delicious, luscious, holy hell kind of way.I couldn't finish off all of the goat cheese, but let me promise you that goat cheese goes unusually well with onions and potato.  Who would have thought?  Don't pass this up.  It's a heartbreaker.Duck Choucroute:  I had an unfortuante experience with duck confit at one of my favorite restaurants in Houston a few months ago.  That day, I cursed the insipid and cruel gods of fate and circumstance.  I wept at my soggy duck skin and my under-flavored, overcooked confit.  I cried out in rage, in sorrow, seeking redress, seeking redemption.  And I found it in New York City, on the Upper East side, at a small French brasserie.This dish was magical.  It came as a selection of three preparations of duck: confit, sausage, and breast.  Not one to put off traditional flavors, the chef prepared the meats and arranged them in a bed of sauerkraut and steamed potatoes. The breast was lightly cooked, both flavorful and juicy.  The sausage was succulent, salty, and full of traditional European and French spices.  The confit?  Oh heaven.  Succulent and juicy meat, at a perfect temperature and texture.  Crispy skin.  So tender that it walked off the bone and fell over on your fork like it wanted to take a nap.  Egads.  Couple those flavors with the bite of sauerkraut and it's obvious why it was love at first bite.This place is an upper east side treasure.  Service can be a bit slow, especially when it gets busy.  It can get a bit loud, and the two bathroom stalls are not exclusively for men and women, which for some reason makes me nervous.  But it's worth the wait.  Chef Philippe Roussel knows what he's doing. And he remembers where he came from.  Yum.",0,2,3,Jamal K.,"Houston, TX",73,15,0

4.0,8/10/2011,"Cafe D'Alsace doesn't need my review, but you need to know this:GET THE CROISSANT.It's a whole lotta delicious in a small package.  I'm on a quest to find a better one, hasn't happened yet.The menu used to be larger and better, I think they realized that UES brunchers would be just as happy with fewer options.  I was not amused.But that said, the food is good.  Wife and I do breakfast here (and sometimes dinner), and really sort of eat a collection of sides - two eggs (side), mesclun salad (also side), pork sausage (side again), and the aforementioned dream of a croissant.  Comes out to a little more than a regular brunch entree.  I like the smoked fish and eggs, but only once in a while.Try the Choucroute Garnie, especially if you're a drunk like me and like gin - you should try juniper berries at least once.  And if you like sweet, get the Barenjager (""bear hunter"") liqueur, it's so delicious, it really tastes like liquid honey.Would be five stars, except for some spotty service (sometimes, but not always), and weird stuff like not having bread ready at opening.Finally, this is going to sound pretentious (and correct me if I'm wrong) but isn't an amuse-bouche at the discretion of the chef, not a menu item to be purchased??",1,0,0,Thom H.,"Syosset, NY",166,549,180
5.0,8/2/2011,"At its core, Cafe d'Alsace is a neighborhood French place, which is a very good thing to be. But on every visit, my dinner has managed to be just a bit better than I expected...a neat trick that earns the fifth star.The decor is classic ""neighborhood French place"" and the menu is a sometimes incongruous mix of classic Alsatian dishes and crowd-pleasing nouveau American standards. The whole setup gives off a whiff of the mass-produced...you could as easily imagine yourself in an upscale Houston suburb as on the Upper East Side.Then the food arrives and it's very apparent that whatever else is going on, there's a serious cook in the kitchen. The sausages are superlative, the fish excellent, and the choucroute garni is a truly worthy interpretation of the classic.And to digress for a moment, I really don't understand why good Alsatian food remains such a rarity. Not only is is better than German food, and less fussy than many French regional cuisines, its entire premise is to take a big pile of cheap ingredients and make them delicious. You'd think from the economic perspective alone it would be more popular among restauranteurs.But to return to Cafe d'Alsace, this is the place to go when you want to be reminded why those shopworn French classics are classic, when you want to show off your taste without appearing to show off, when you just want to enjoy a really delicious dinner without any fuss or pomp.",0,0,0,Amy L.,"San Francisco, CA",38,129,0

An old couple strolls in and right when the hostess comes back, she greets them and they ask for a table. She caters to them first.Given that there is already a wait, that we were on a schedule ... I was really pissed! Not to let it slide, when she came to us later, I let her know that it wasn't cool what she did. She responded with a fake smile and said sorry. Our waiter was SO SLOW at taking our money! Who doesn't want our money? He didn't return for a full 30 minutes after he gave us a check, and it wasn't like we were still eating.

4.0,7/25/2011,"I moved to the UES in the beginning of this year, and almost every night, I see a full house in Cafe D'Alsace. What could it be about this place that entices so many crowds to wait outside or to put their names down and come back an hour later? Cafe D'Alsace just does it right. With their retro french decor they seem to be drawing both the young and old. Their menu is all in all a teaser because everything on it sounds so delicious and is plenty of it too. So we narrowed it down to Black sea bass ceviche and the king crab salad to start. The ceviche was just right with the sourness- not too overpowering. But what I found odd was they sprinkle dry seaweed on top that kinda mixed my taste buds a little. Nothing major, just a little weird. The crab leg salad was fresh and cool, and made with real crabs!! Entrees we ordered the Oxtail, Skate fish and the D'Alsace Burger. Oxtail was very rich and tender and just overall a good dish with the mash potatoes and onions. The skate fish was nice also:a mustard sauce like had the right amount of sour to pair with the dish. The rice that came with it were a bit undercooked but still not bad. And the burger, well... it's just a burger not much to say about it except that it was a burger lolz. with hand cut fries!!! In the end we enjoyed our time at Cafe D'Alsace. I will come back again to try their brunch menu which seem to be the hype around the area.

Thankfully, we came prepared and only needed to take a glance at the menu before being ready to order.We were sat in the corner by the window and if there was anything to complain about was there was a gigantic fly buzzing in and out of our faces. However, I'm here to talk about the food!I had the pan seared soft shell crab to start off with and my goodness I could have eaten that for the rest of my life. I just love soft shell crabs and the explosion of flavors in your mouth when you bite into that succulent crustacean is just divine.For entrees, I had the filet mignon and my friend had the sea bass. My filet mignon was nice, I think it could hit a better medium but still tasted very good. The sea bass was much more neutral in flavor and was very light. The bass was cooked beautifully, very flasky without it being over done. However, only complaint about this dish was that it looked a bit unappetizing but the wild rice was delicious in the sauce.Dessert was strawberry creme brulee and crepe mille feuilles. The creme brulee was very good. I'm not much of a dessert person but the strawberries couldn't have been fresher. The crepe was interesting. It was definitely an interesting experience. The dessert itself is layered with crepes and I believe a bit of whip in between the layers. The passion fruit ""dipping sauce"" was tart and worked well with the crepes but I couldn't help but feel like something was missing.

It was utterly delicious, full of flavor & perfectly dressed.He ordered the duck breast, which I sampled and enjoyed. However I scored a total home run with my dish - the diver scallops. Restaurant scallop dishes are always skimpy (I could eat a plateful of them!) but these three extra large scallops were perfectly cooked and accompanied by fava beans, asparagus, grapefruit sections & a citrus-y cream sauce. Divine. The only misstep was the dollop of mashed potatoes in the middle of my dish. They were tasty as all get out, but they were a bit heavy for what was otherwise a perfectly light summer dish.Service was terrific (they even did everything they could to put me at ease, whilst they cleaned up broken glass from my inadvertent smashing after I gestured just a little too wildly early on...before there was even any wine in it!)We sat for quite some time catching up & our water glasses & coffee cups remained consistently full!

From croque madames to french toast to bread baskets, the variety of food here can satisfy any brunch craving. Everything I've had so far (even dishes with stinky cheeses) are fantastic.-Price.

I usually go early before it gets busy so I can't recommend a time to go.-Al fresco dining. I'm a bit biased against it in general, as an fyi, since I always feel like an exhibit when people walk by and stare at me/my food.  One experience churned my stomach as I was sitting near the corner of the sidewalk, I was unfortunate to see a swarm of flies buzzing about some fecal matter close to the end of the sidewalk.

I came here on a Saturday night and had to be seated outside because I didn't place a reservation.Anyhow, let's talk about the food. Just so you know, everything here is on the high end of a $$ place, so be warned. Entrees average around $22 and appetizers are about $12.Offered a complimentary bread basket; I liked the oat/multi-grain bread. Too bad the butter was too hard to spread properly on the soft bread.Appetizer, La Moelle: This was a bone marrow dish served with toasted bread and sea salt. To be honest, the bone marrow itself already had salt sprinkled on it, and adding the sea salt just made it way too salty. In fact, it was quite salty without the sea salt.Entree, Lamb Burger: This one really disappointed me. I guess it was my fault for ordering the lamb. When I get a gourmet burger, I usually expect juices to run down my chin/arms and basically become a complete mess. I asked for it to be done medium rare, and there was no juice whatsoever. Is it just the nature of lamb to be so juiceless? Sigh. The goat cheese that was smeared on the patty only served to accentuate the chunky meatiness of the burger; there was no liquid to cut through all that texture and it just wasn't much of a joy to eat. Especially since I just had an uber juicy 5 Napkin burger the night before. I can't say I tasted any rosemary in the roll, but it was definitely buttered like there was no more butter left in the world.Fries that came with the burger were at least crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside.I'm definitely not making any special trips to the UES just for this place.",0,1,0,Jin C.,"New York, NY",36,1100,328

4.0,4/19/2011,"I am very, very picky when it comes to french food and I was amazed!!! My friend and I went here on a Saturday brunch outing (my first in NY) and it seriously served greatness on a platter. I ordered the croque monsieur. I need to mention how delicious the cheese is that they use to melt on top of one of the most tasty ham-wich's I have had in a long time. Superb!!! My friend ordered a breakfast dish of french toast with strawberries and strawberry drizzle. Now, usually this is a dish I tend not to care for, due to it being to sweet for my taste buds, but this was perfection!!! It really pretty much melted in my mouth. Syrup?... NO, why?!?! It was fine already. Now we move on to the well seasoned potatoes that we both received... Ugh, my toes are curling just thinking about them! i usually add salt and/or pepper to my papas, but I did no such thing to these golden brown nuggets of yumminess. I gave it 4 stars due the drinks being a little pricy if you are having more than one, but the food most definitely over powers the whole experience. You must go!!!",1,0,0,Joshua H.,"Manhattan, NY",69,11,0

4.0,4/17/2011,"I love this place for breakfast and brunch.  Even when it's busy, they manage to seat us quickly.  The menu ranges from salads and sandwiches to the more traditional breakfast fare.  I love the mushroom omelet and the omelet D'Alsace.  My boyfriend says the Croque Madame is the best he's had.  The bread basket at the beginning is superb.  A couple of different slices of bread and it's so delightfully crunchy.  Perfect and fresh.  Food always comes out quickly and is very consistent.  Bonus points for being one of the only places around with outdoor seating.  The only negative is that the service is kind of meh sometimes.  The busboys can be short.  ""Are you done?"" is sometimes uttered in a short, frustrated tone, before my plate is hastily rushed away to be washed.  When it's not busy, it takes a while to get the check because the wait staff is hanging out in the corner and chatting.  Not anything that would keep me from coming back, but definitely enough to subtract a star.  The food is great and the eggs are always cooked just right.  Definitely a fan.",0,0,0,Yelena K.,"Nashville, TN",162,275,167
4.0,4/16/2011,"One word. Awesome. So, we were on the hunt for a good brunch and after reading so many pleasant yelp reviews I thought why not? We go here about 3pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately. Yes, no wait! May have been the rains fault but either way, good start. We sat down and pondered the menu questionably. Right when I think we were about to head out, the people got served next to us and the food looked (and smelled) SO good we thought, eh, may as well give it a try. Glad we did. My friend got the Croque Monsiere and I got the french toast. the french toast was fluffy, light, flavorful and had strawberries and drizzle surrounding it. I also got a side of the breakfast potatoes. Let me tell you, Im a HUGE fan of potatoes and these were some of the best I've ever had. My friend agreed. No need to add salt or seasoning to them. Fresh, soft and perfectly seasoned. My friends dish was good as well. I picked a bite off it and would definately recommend it (I'm sure ill get it next time). The price being a french restaurant was decent. However, drinks are high priced and bland. We went simple (just got a few sodas) and they charge for refills. You can get unlimited alcoholic beverages at some places and breakfast and pay what we paid, but the food was good enough we were able to ignore the $10 charge for just 4 sodas.

4.0,4/1/2011,"It feels like Paris in here. I mean, I wouldn't know first hand since I do not have the time nor money to travel there, but according to my BFF, it's almost an exact replica of a french cafe. After a painfully (physically and figuratively) long manicure/pedicure at Kasia's European Day Spa we found ourselves here, drooling at the prospect of filling our faces with a croque-madame, steak frites, and eggs benedict. We did just that. Food was spot on; served in the traditional French brunch fashion with a mixed greens salad. Not even I, the cocky chef, had anything bad to say. Tender steak, hand cut, crispy frites, homemade hollandaise, thick-cut bread for the croque-madame, well seasoned roasted potatoes. We also ordered the assorted pastries, including pain au chocolat. croissant, and other flaky treats. Fantastic, classic brunch fare. Please note: this is not the type of brunch where you will find innovative cuisine or anything cutting edge. It's really just classic French comfort food. My only complaint lies with the beverages. The bellinis kind of sucked! As Peter D. mentioned, the green tea was also pretty awful. It would benefit them to get some loose teas or at least the full leaf brands in the silk bags. It kind of cheapens the place. If I'm ever uptown (which I rarely am) this would definitely be one of my first choices for a reasonably priced, tasty brunch.",0,0,0,Liana L.,"Brooklyn, NY",283,320,26

Order either the cassoulet, the burger, or something from the traditional Alsatian menu, then ask the sommelier for a beer recommendation. I have had many, many beers in my life and been to many, many NYC restaurants that claim to have the best beer selection. Alsace does not have the largest selection, but there is stuff there that you just cannot get anywhere else, and they will pair beers with your food as if they were wines.Desserts are very good too. Pretty traditional stuff, but well done. Flourless chocolate gateau is a must-have, and the brioche bread pudding is a favorite too.Warning: do not go here and expect to get laid afterward. Your date will be very impressed with the food, the atmosphere can be quite romantic, but after you polish off about two pounds of bacon and your date eats half a baby lamb, it's just not going to happen.

4.0,12/21/2010,"Solid 3.5 stars, but hey, it's the holidays, so I'm rounding up:Enjoyed a late dinner here, with my roommate, the other night. Place was packed when we got in around 10:15 and continued to be populated well past 11:30. 1 star docked for service. Yes, it was a busy night, and yes, our server clearly tried her best while apologizing for the delay, but it wasn't like they were short-handed. Also, was it absolutely necessary that she take her break smack in the middle of our meal, leaving us with no water replenished for a good 10-15 min? Food was pretty delectable, though, so I wasn't too upset. We started with the calamari, which I pretty much inhaled - not too heavily breaded/starchy and the right texture (e.g. chewy vs limp + soggy). For mains, roommate has the wild mushroom ravioli and I the grilled tuna. Ravioli was very rich and satisfying. The fact that the roommate - who normally disdains all things mushroom'd - loved it after 1 bite is saying a lot. I was a bit more ambivalent about the tuna. Well seasoned and the texture was just right, but it was slightly overcooked and I was repeatedly distracted by the 'taste of burning,' so another 1/2 star off.Otherwise, though, I thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience. Atmosphere was charming - though on the louder side so perhaps not ideal for a 1st date - and the drinks were strong. I might also add that the portions here are almost indecently large ( e.g. 3 full scoops of homemade sorbet for dessert would only be considered ""single-serving"" if you're the Hulk).",0,0,0,Jenny C.,"New York, NY",6,74,6
4.0,12/20/2010,"3.5 rounded up on the contingency that I'd come back, but not go out of my way again.This place is nice.  A nice bustling spot in the UES with bistro, gastropub type decor.  Apparently the owners of Cafe D'Alsace are those that own French Roast/ L""Express, two establishments I like.    I came here for brunch on a Sunday morning feeling Francophone with my girlfriend.  Diners among us were: couples, young 20 somethings and families.   The meal was pretty solid with nice French flares. Nothing was really orgasmic, but it was good.  Service was extremely fast (in a creepy, rushed way), and prices are a bit steep but I have no real complaints. This place kind of reminds me of a grade C Artisanal.We came in with no reservations around 1:30 pm, and the place was packed. We only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table; albeit I wasn't too thrilled about our seating. It wasn't very private, it was in the middle of the restaurant on an awkward two-seater which had no table room.  We got started with some freshly squeezed OJ, which was very pulp-y and fresh... but not as sweet as freshly squeezed OJ is which makes me feel they watered it down a bit. Still fine but not the best freshly squeezed OJ I've had, and a little steep at $4 a glass.  The brunch menu has really great variety; good options for breakfast (eggs, pancakes, waffles), lunch (steak & frites, chicken, sandwiches, salads, charchueteries).  The portion size is on the bigger size, so beware.  There is a lot of French influences such as Quiche, and cheese plates... I heard the cheese offered here was decent by my dining partner who'd come here for dinner/dessert.  She, therefore, went with the goat omelette with a side of bacon.  Feeling piggy, I got the French Onion Soup (not formally on the menu, but an item I thought they'd offer), and the Salmon Benedict (wish I'd gotten the better reviewed regular eggs benedict).  We ordered a croissant to share (just regular, but chocolate or raisin) for $2.  Most brunch items were between $10-15, and the chicken and whatnot was more expensive- $17-20.They brought out some french baguettes with butter and compote (apricot maybe? Seemed that way because of the color, but the fruit was hard to tell).  The butter/compote seemed fresh, and was nice.  The bread didn't feel that fresh- it was whatever.  I didn't try my friend's goat cheese omelette but she said it was good and fresh; it seemed fluffy. It came with home frites (this is their side order of ""french fries"" fyi- breakfast potatoes, in case you're wondering if they're fries fries) and a mesculin side salad- same as me.  The greens were refreshing but the dressing was really rich; I honestly think it was doused in butter + some form of a rich balsamic vinegar (but not as sour).  I wish they'd lighten up on that so I didn't feel like I was eating 485908 calories.  The home frites were nicely seasoned; and really done more as potatoes, not frites. They were cut in thick wedges so a little goes a long way.   They were nice with the house made (?) hot sauce- if you just ask for hou sauce, you'll get what I had.  They gave my friend quite a bit of side bacon ($4)- I think 4-5 strips, which were unevenly cooked (some burnt, some done right- but overall, not too greasy, more on the dry side). I got started with the French Onion Soup.  Damn,  it ended up being an expensive soup, $8.50. It was ok- a little on the watery side.  They did a great job with the cheese on top (the cheese did not have that much flavor though but was melty and integrated well with the soup), but the bread soaked the soup well.  There were a little too many onions for my taste but that's because I don't love 'em all too much-- I know, odd I'm eating french onion soup.  It was good but perhaps could have been a bit saltier.Then,  I had the salmon benedict. I think they put too much salmon- or maybe by this point I was full so didn't care to eat much of it.  It was kind of whatever- not that salty and extra ""fishy"" tasting.  The eggs were perfectly poached though, and the yolk tasted great atop the perfect toasted bread.  The hollandaise was a bit on the lighter side, and there was less of it. I didn't mind this.  I wish I did get the regular eggs benedict though (yum, canadian bacon). The best part of our meal was probably the croissant- either solo, or with the butter/compote combo, it was so buttery, fluffy and well baked. It was truly buttery- not oily; there's a difference.  I'd like to think they're baked in-house. Overall, the meal was decent. Our waiter was ok; funnily he barked if I wanted another OJ yet was rather absent when we needed waters refilled.  We didn't wait long though for more water.  He did ask me if I was done with my soup when it was only 3/4 of the way done so that was annoying- I guess they wanted you to get through your meal  to seat more patrons. Overall, good meal. Don't know that I'd come back...maybe to try dinner if i was in the hood.",1,0,1,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",878,1242,25

As a fellow foodie, I had total trust in his choice when he said it's one of his favorite neighborhood spots and the many excellent reviews I found online confirmed his great taste. Walking in and seeing Anthony Bourdain sitting at the table next to us cleared up any chance that this wouldn't be a great meal.I ordered the Omelette D'alsace which was filled with mushrooms and comte. It was cooked beautifully and even though I was stuffed after half of it, I managed to clean my plate. Light, fluffy eggs, juicy mushrooms and the perfect amount of melted cheese. The fries arrived well-done per my request and were crunchy and perfect, not too greasy. The side salad was lightly dressed with a balsamic vinaigrette and a refreshing complement to the heavier foods on my plate. I sipped a delightful lemonade and took in my surroundings. Brightly colored seltzer bottles circled the bar, a hoppin' UES crowd of all ages filled the tables.

4.0,11/22/2010,"This is my favorite restaurant in the ""Yorkville"" section of the Upper East Side. The food is simply consistently good, creative, and innovative. I am regularly impressed by the offerings. Some of the favorites of mine include the John Dory Grenobloise, Truite au Reisling, and wild mushroom ravioli. I recently also had a soup of the day (lentil) which was awesome. Each meal contains balanced flavors which work well together, and I get excited each year for the tomato festival in late summer. Finally, I cannot leave this review without mentioning the desserts. I am consistently impressed by the desserts, which include an amazing warm flourless chocolate gateau, an equally awesome chocolate tart, and (if you want to go lighter), a phenomenal thin carmelized apple tart. I also must mention that the service is terrific - I have always had great service - each time I go!I have also been here for brunch which is consistent and delicious.

3.0,9/29/2010,"Went on a Thursday evening and we decided on the prix fixe. For the app I had the pan seared scallops that had a tart sauce. Overall OK, same scallops I've had a million times not at all bad or unsatisfying, but also nothing to redefine it for me, hence the 3 stars, competent  and on the mark.For the entree Coq Au Riesling. Basically moist oven roasted drumstick/thigh served over mashed potatoes with a gravy with bits of mushrooms and pearl onions. The saucy gravy was solid and overall the dish was hearty. For dessert I had sorbet, which was like the supermarket Ciao Bella, solid & OK. My friend had the fig pie, which was really interesting as I've never has a pie with fig and am now on the lookout to try again if ever in the area.Unfortunately, this is a pretty boring and staid review, but ultimately this was what the evening added up for me. Nothing was really that memorable except for the fig pie. Cynically I could make the case I could have had this at my local diner for a third of the price. I also am willing to admit that the meal was secondary to my company and the evening at hand, and I very well could have missed many nuances and glazed over or took for granted some unique slant that might have been present.So to be fair I figure 3 stars is in order.I just was hoping to be charmed or enlightened based on others' reviews, but overall It was A-ok.  3 stars",0,1,0,John S.,"Astoria, NY",58,11,1

3.0,8/7/2010,"French Fast Food in a Faux  Fashon.The inside of the restaurant has the Dal-Tile, the mismatched chandelliers, banquettes, small chairs and marble-topped tables surrounded by  a rim of outside tables where you can sit and watch the world pass by.The food pays hommage to France but it is a photo copy of the original.  You know what it is and it reminds you of why you like it in the first place, but there is always that nagging suspicion that something is missing.  There is nothing bad on the menu; once your waiter finds you and gets your order, the food flies out of the kitchen to your table, so there is really no delay.  It is mercifully brought by the food runner, because the place is perpetually understaffed, so the odds of getting water refilled or a quick order/bill retrieval are pretty slim and that can be frustrating.The Mouilles Muenière had a strange wine sauce that had so many herbs ground into it that it was green and the mussels themselves were incompletely opened or broken.  No French Bread brought to the table.  Had an omelette that was better than the average diner fare - meaning the eggs were not scorched over a too-high flame.  The Croque Madame suffered from an imbalance in the bread/sauce ratio, leaving the sandwich too dry - God, I wanted to love it but couldn't.Over all, for the money, it is ok and a good place to meet for breakfast or a lunch or a light meal throughout the day or evening.  However, you should not mistake this as a ""French Restaurant""; rather, it is a neighborhood restaurant that serves French-style food.",1,0,1,Tom W.,"Houston, TX",38,160,89

1.0,6/16/2010,"This is my first review on this site. It might be my last, because I am rarely moved to review places. But this place has really earned the effort (and that is not a compliment), so without further ado:No.How else to put it?I have two entrees and one dessert from Cafe D'Alsace sitting in my refrigerator as I write this, and as a result, perhaps the only thing unhappier than I am right now is my refrigerator. Sitting in my refrigerator, I write? Yes. In my refrigerator as opposed to my stomach. And I am hungry. But not hungry enough to eat this stuff.1. Steak frites2. Cassoulet3. Sauteed Spinach4. Apple tart w/ vanilla ice creamI ordered two entrees. Why? Because in my long history of ordering from unfamiliar places, I have learned that casting my entire fate on the goodwill of one entree tends to be a bad idea. So, usually, I order at least one back-up entree. If the main one is bad, the alternative usually at least palatable. If both are great, I win two times over and spend a few days nibbling in delight. It is rare that a place gets two entrees totally wrong. (No, I am not rich, so you can stop frowning at your monitor; I just prefer to spend my ""eating out"" budget on a few quality meals a month, rather than several fast food places a week.) Anyway, where was I? Oh yes. Today, I lost twice.But let me start with the good: The apple tart? Phenomenal. Look no further for the perfect dessert. I spent $72 on the entire meal and the $9 corresponding to the tart was worth it. In fact, let's say $18 was worth it, because the tart gave me twice as much joy as I expected. I wouldn't say I came out ahead, but at least the meal was not a total loss, right? Onward:The cassoulet arrived with the white beans still hard. My first thought was, how can any restaurant worth its salt send out a stew with the beans still hard? But I put the thought aside and took a few more bites to be fair to the dish and see if the taste of the stew could make up for the texture of the beans. That was mistake #2 (Mistake #1 was ordering from this place.). I moved on to the steak frites. Now, to be fair, the steak was cooked to perfection. I ordered it medium rare and shocker of all shockers, it arrived medium rare. Many places seem to think medium rare means 'able to crack my jaw', but not Cafe D'Alsace. The texture was great and the steak would have been perfect, if not for the fact that the sauce was magic. Yes, magic. Not the good sort of magic, but the sort of magic performed by a sauce that looks thick, smells wonderful...but has no taste. I don't know how this kind of magic is worked, but I would tip my hat to Cafe D'Alsace, if not for the fact that I ordered *steak*, not magic. I mean, I know America is at war, but since when did the government start rationing salt?The fries saved the night. Just kidding.The fries arrived soggy and flattened, as if a fat-fingered lout had been enraged when he jammed them into the equally soggy cardboard box they arrived in. They tasted as bad as they looked (so, at least there was no trickery involved here as there had been with the steak). The spinach in the even soggier cardboard box beneath them was cold and as tasteless as the steak. The bread next to the spinach was hard and crusty in that I-just-know-mice-have-had-their-way-with-this-a-few-times sort of way. Sounds delicious, no?By the time I had finished making my way through the large paper bag my food arrived in, I was committed to jumpstarting some weight loss by starving myself for dinner. So, I suppose something good came out of this. And you all thought I was a downer. :)Stay away from this place, please. I don't know what the others eating here are thinking, but I am angry I read the reviews and listened to them. $72 was wasted this night and after this review, you'll have no one to blame but yourself, if the same happens to you.

The restaurant seemed spacious, cozy but elegant. My friend and I checked the online RW menu prior and pretty much knew what we wanted so for a change the ordering didn't take that long! The butternut squash soup was amazing! For our entrees, I had a fish (I think bass) and my friend picked the risotto (which apparently was erroneously on the online menu but the manager still let us have it as part of the deal, plus points for that!). Both were, again, pretty amazing. And the best for last: flourless chocolate cake with raspberry sauce for both of us - more than amazing.  Overall - great!

5.0,2/6/2010,"Amazing bouillabaisse (French seafood stew).  The word is so long because it has so many wonderful ingredients:  three types of fish including snapper, mussels, scallops and shrimp in a saffron broth served alongside a creamy sauce and grated Parmesan.  I applied the sauce and cheese to the mussels, slurped it down and used the shell as a scoop for the broth.  The experience was delicious and sensual.We were initially confused by the gnocchi appetizer; we expected a typical pasta dish. Cafe D'Alsace served anything but: the gnocchi and tender mushrooms were complimented by a nutty gruyere and baked in a warm, flaky tart.   My Alsatian friend thought the chocroute was good but inauthentic. He said it lacked the potato or dough crust that would seal the steam and juices inside; his came in a covered cast iron pot. Phil's chocroute came with various cuts of meat and sausage. Eric had a seared red snapper served over rice, leek fondue and topped with roasted tomatoes. We ate happily and with fervor.    The pear napoleon was divine, not too sweet and drizzled with chocolate sauce.  It was surrounded with three flavors of sauce (one raspberry, I believe) and swirled beautifully, like sun rays. It was almost a shame to dredge each bite through the sauce and eat it. They also served warm, fresh baked baguettes on wood cutting boards with a serrated knife and a circular pat of butter. High ceilings, warm lighting and an energetic crowd make for a lovely date or group dinner.

Turns out the soup of the day was lentil. Decided to skip on it and take my chances on the duck terrine even though I had NO IDEA what it would be. I thought "" eh it's duck, can't be that bad. "" WRONG. It was the most awful appetizer dish I've ever had. Not only did it taste like bologna, it even came with mustard.. eep.. Had two bites and I was done. Through with it, I tried washing it down with bread but no can do. The waiter even joked and asked if I enjoyed the dish or not. Next up, I had the seafood fettuccine. I'd actually prefer they give me more pasta instead of so much calamari, but the mussels were reallly fresh. Lastly, to the finish line with chocolate gateau! It was certainly a sweet dream come true. The chocolate cake was not only soft but warm and fresh! The pistachio ice cream assisting it only made it perfect.

4.0,4/26/2009,"the absolute perfect place for a spring kick-off brunch on the UES.  The coffee was rich and deep without being bitter, and the bread, butter, and jam our server brought to start our meal reminded me of the breakfasts I used to have in Italy.I had the tomato and goat cheese omelet, and he had the omelet d'Alsace.  Both were fantastic, and the roasted tomatoes and herbed goat cheese really hit the spot.  Servings were surprisingly huge - 6 hours later, I'm still stuffed.Drinks-wise, the Bellini and the strawberry concoction were both tasty, though the champagne - fresh strawberry flute was the clear winner.This could easily be a five star place were it not for the street noise from 2nd avenue, the crowds inside, and the harried (but certainly well intentioned) waitstaff.  Despite its drawbacks, Cafe D'Alsace is still very likely the best brunch to be found on the UES.",0,0,0,Caitlin P.,"Chicago, IL",27,48,0

I know it's Easter, but seriously it was insane.We stumbled upon Cafe D'Alsace -- so close to us and we never knew it was there.It was packed inside so we opted to brave the cold weather and eat outside.I had the goat cheese omelet and a bellini and he had the eggs benedict and a coffee. Both were good. Even though our server and the restaurant was obviously slammed, service was very quick and polite. Plus -- under $40 for the whole meal is a steal.Also, we got to sit next to some d-bag that took last nite's bar hookup to brunch. I love people watching and getting to listen to some 22 year old try to impress someone he met most likely at Brother Jimmy's made my breakfast that much more enjoyable.Overall -- great scene for people watching.

4.0,3/25/2009,"I have eaten here quite a few times and have never been disappointed. The beer, the food, the service, the beer and the ambiance are all stellar. Did I mention the beer? I wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars as 5 stars would imply perfection. It is close to that, but Le Bernadin or Picholine it is not. Nor is it priced like them.Last dinner here I had the duck breast. It was one of the best dishes I have had in a long time. I finished every last bite, which is unusual for me. My companion had a duck special, leg in confit, sausage and breast. I, sadly, only had a small bite of the sausage but it was outstanding. I am told that the rest of the platre was equally good, but there was no evidence of this left on the plate. I don't remember which beer I had on this occasion but it was surely one of their Belgian beers. I have never been disappointed by the beer at Cafe D'Alsace, it is always excellent, perfectly fresh and served in the appropriate glass.A few days ago I was in the neighborhood and hungry so I decided to go for lunch. The beer tap was having maintenance so there was no beer on tap. I resisted the urge to scream, or to run away as I fortunately remembered that they have an extraordinary selection of beer in the bottle. So I started with a Grimbergen then had a few Hoegartens to go along with my smoked fish plate. The smoked fish plate had rather a lot of smoked salmon (Excellent!) and smaller quantities of smoked trout and whitefish.

They also have a substantial selection of beers. Note: though the menu indicated fresh juice, it was not actually freshly squeezed; that said, I found $4 per glass to be a little ridiculous!Dinner was enjoyable as well, though I found the prices a bit inflated.

Also, the sausage was remarkably similar to a hot dog (not that there's anything wrong with that).  It was served with roasted potatoes and greens. All solidly done, but nothing to write home about. She had the French toast, which was good; but there was too much raspberryness for my taste, and she was unhappy that the maple syrup wasn't legit. I think it was Aunt Jemima. Perhaps I'm just bitter because I had food envy. I couldn't stop turning around and staring at the guy behind us because his burger looked so delicious. It was to the point where my girlfriend was a little peeved I wasn't paying attention to our own meal. Most guys get yelled at by their girlfriends for staring at other girls, but it's really burgers that turn me on.Oh, and avoid their green tea. I have nothing good to say about it: (1) My companion said it was like drinking grass, and I can't really disagree, (2) they were out of honey, and (3) although it is listed on the menu as $2.75, it's actually $3.25.",21,19,8,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4675,3021,10459

I came across Cafe D'Alsace via other websites on the web, ironically enough, not Yelp. Cafe D'Alsace delivered a fine brunch but at a cost higher than expected. Currently, I give it 3.5 stars. If it was a tad cheaper, then certainly, it would get a full 4 stars from me, even without dining there more than once. I ordered the prix fixe which offered three choices per course, with the exception of dessert which had four. I suppose that my French isn't too good, but I had some trouble pronouncing some of the dishes. (That's just a personal criticism however.) As the main dish, I ordered something with salmon steak. It was soft and tender and flavored just right. For dessert, I was torn between two choices. When it arrived, I felt instant regret that I had not ordered the other and thus, I could not enjoy it for what it really was. If I ever return, I would definitely like to get the profiterole... however exactly you pronounce it... It is much easier to write than say. As for the atmosphere, it was delightfully lively.

Just don't eat all your bread as they don't bring more to spread it on. For dinner, I've had the Trout, and the Steak Frites here, both were very good. It's a nice spot for a date. For brunch I've had both the French Toast and the Croque Monsieur. Both very nice if not hangover-eradicating. I have had their flourless chocolate gateau for dessert and found it lovely though, again, not worth traveling for.

4.0,11/7/2008,"I don't think it is quite right to call Café D'Alsace a French restaurant.  Alsace is a region in France that boarders Germany, so I would call Café D'Alsace an Alsatian restaurant.  There are better French restaurants in the city, but I am not aware of a better Alsatian one.If you can imagine a mixing of French and German cuisines, you can imagine the things that Café D'Alsace does particularly well.  Riesling, a wine commonly produced in Alsace, makes quite a few appearances on the menu (and wine list).  The Coq au Riesling is a fun twist on the more common Coq au Vin.  There are also many delicious, hardy, stewed and braised dishes on the menu.  If you're in the mood for something warming that will stick to your ribs, these are great options (I especially enjoy the baeckeofe). But the food isn't my favorite thing about this place - it's the beer.  True to the German influences in Alsace, Café D'Alsace has a vast beer selection.  I read a review in the times claiming  this place has a beer sommelier.  I don't know what this means, but the waiters were always able to recommend interesting beer and food parings.  I don't think beer gets the respect it deserves.  While debatable, I think it is harder to make a great beer than it is to make a great wine.  (And, the hardest part of make a good wine is growing the grapes - so wouldn't a great winemaker be more adequately described as a great farmer?  But I digress.)  Café D'Alsace gives beer the respect it deserves and gives it a place on the table with fine food.  Don't think beer can fill the same role as wine?  Give this place a try, ask for a beer recommendation and judge for yourself.  I bet you'll come around.",0,0,0,Doug J.,"New York, NY",3,5,0

Choucrute Garnie is easily enough for two, with a generous serving of sausages, pork belly, and apple-laden sauerkraut.  Take your meal up a notch and order the pear cider - more champagne than traditional cider, it's a nice splurge in lieu of a bottle of wine.  The service is attentive and give the place a chill vibe.",0,0,0,Angela G.,"Arlington, VA",62,149,0

The beer selection is fantastic -- rivals the bottled wine selection at most restaurants, and it's filled with great possibilities for very reasonable prices. The service was just okay, as it seemed like our waiter was running around a bit so things were sort of slow, but he made every effort to keep us happy and we appreciated that. For apps we ate a goat cheese tatin (really delicious) and a cold gazpacho soup, (a special that did not disappoint -- in fact, the chilled gazpacho was really satisfying on a warm day). Anyway, we went specifically because we heard the burgers were great... and sure enough, they were delicious. They were cooked just as we wanted them, but I wasn't very fond of the muenster/onion combo that came on the burger. The french fries really made up for that though, since they were probably top 5 for french fries that I've ever eaten. But if all you want is a fat, juicy burger and you're in the Upper East Side, I'd just say you should head down to J.G. Melon instead.

Each was extremely disappointing from the service stand point and far from the French food you'd get some place else.  I had a gazpacho -- which was nice (never had a bad gazpacho) and Dorado for the main course - which was just ok.  Really, the food was fine. Can't say the same about the service: slow, sloppy, attitudy, and careless.  Everything that cld have gone wrong with the service did. We waited and waited and waited... for water and bread, then we waited to give the order, then we waited for the bottle of champaign, which in the end wasn't there and we had to get another one. Then we, 30+ women in NYC got carded  - ""yey"",- you'd say, but wait a second - this was the first time was I was carded in the restaurant.  So, we waited and waited and waited.  The waiter grinned at our frustration and ignored completely our pleading for food (we had a pregnant girl with us).  We really enjoyed our post ""sex and the city premier"" girls night - it was all good, but then every 10 minutes we'd just look at each and say: is it us? or are we still waiting? So we'd laugh it off. Then, towards the end of the dinner, one of the waiters spilled my friends' glass of wine all over her white jacket... and said absolutely nothing, nada...:) No apology, no ""hey, can i get you another glass?"", just quietly wiped off the table.  The manager came over looked at the mess - said ""something spilled here?"" and walked away.  We were speachless :)  To top it all off - i got a little something extra in my tap water - looked something like a piece of cooked cabbage - a big piece of cooked cabbage... oh well - Otherwise, we had a great time",1,0,1,Serafima I.,"New York, NY",3,9,0
4.0,4/6/2008,"Great spot for brunch! I always get the tart to start. It's delicious! The frittata with caramelized onions is also good. I loved the potatoes on the side. My boyfriend got the french toast and loved it. Our waitress was great and on top of things. Nice, cozy atmosphere.",0,0,0,Katie H.,"New York, NY",125,106,0
4.0,2/5/2008,"I went here for brunch prior to going over to a friend's place on UES.  It is a cute bistro-type place where they serve mostly French fare.  Their hot chocolate (highly recommended by my friend's Swiss husband!) was mild and sweet... so delish!Our party of five all ordered either croque-monsieurs or croque-madames.  I personally loved this menu.  My croque-monsieur was made from a French baguette and it was crunchy and cheesy, oh-lala!Their orange juice was super nice too.  A place you want to keep in mind when you find yourself wandering on UES.",0,0,0,Yu T.,"San Francisco, CA",55,170,30
3.0,1/29/2008,"Brunch was good. I had a light helping of the salmon eggs benedict. Presentation was simple and elegant. Potatoes were perfectly seasoned and cooked. I was a bit disappointed with the poached eggs. I asked for the eggs to be less cooked (runny), and was instead surprised with a hard and chalky yolk. The coffee was mediocre, I think I could do a better job at home.",0,0,0,Teresa Y.,"San Francisco, CA",147,647,33

4.0,11/19/2007,"I've had brunch here a few times now and had to Yelp about how great their Omelette D'Alsace is. You can't go wrong with this pork sausage and eggs omelette. And cheese, of course! I've never had to wait long for a table for brunch (but then it's usually around 1pm)... And great for group brunches. Oh and it's one of the few good options for brunch in the UES!",2,0,3,Julianne C.,"Oakland, CA",384,276,170
2.0,9/9/2007,"Went for Saturday brunch.  Was ok.  Not memorable for me.  I had a smoked fish tossed with scrambled eggs and served with roasted fennel and potatoes.  The fish with eggs were way too salty and the fennel was too greasy.  Potatoes were good, especially with ketchup.  But it's hard to mess up potatoes.Friends had the German Apple Pancake and Smoked Salmon Egg Benedict.  They appeared to really like their dishes.  But I was a little disappointed when trying theirs.  The pancake was an actual pancake.  I was expecting the buttery concoction that puffs up in the oven - or is that Dutch?  I've never had one.  D'Alsace's pancakes are fluffy but no crispy exterior.  The egg benedict was also too salty for me.  I don't think they account for the salt already in the smoked fishes when they cook.LIked the atmosphere even though the decor was a little run-down.  Wouldn't come back with so many other good eats in Manhattan.",0,0,0,Tiffany T.,"New York, NY",32,230,2
4.0,7/5/2007,"What an odd location for a restaurant like this.  I'm still sort of perplexed by the choice of location, as the outdoor streetside patio dining gives you a wonderful view of...the bodega across the street and the goodwill. Classy.  I've been here for dinner once, their specials du jour were fabulous, I had a tuna tartare that was out of this world. But it's the $4 massive cone of pomme frites, that really does me.  You need to ask for the aoli with those, because nothing beats homemade garlic mayo.  Brunch here is a little more affordable, though the drinks will help your bill skyrocket.  The portions for brunch are MASSIVE, and everything is delicious.  The eggs petatou and the omelettes are among the best things on the brunch menu.  The Bloody Mary's were so good, I haven't had a better one anywhere else in the city.  They can also make a mean French 75.  The bar itself is covered in a rainbow of old seltzer bottles.  A favorite pastime of mine is going to the bar alone on a Wednesday looking pouty and sad and seeing if a German speaking IBanker will whisk me away into a New York fairy tale.  Hasn't happened yet. Will keep you posted, though.  The most action I've seen at this place was a *very* affectionate mother reading Hamlet to her pubescent son and hand feeding him pieces of prosciutto from the Country Charcuterie plate.  Hot.",1,0,1,Cassandra P.,"New York, NY",13,46,0
4.0,6/11/2007,"So good that i went here for brunch 2 days in a row.  Eating outside its better than inside, people watching 2nd ave is the best.  Men like beer, cafe d'alsace has lots of 'em, so impress your dude and bring him along.",1,0,1,Allison H.,"Jersey City, NJ",309,576,9
3.0,4/13/2007,"I think where we went wrong here was not ordering what they are really good at.  The waitress was about to sit us at a ridiculous crowded in table for two basically in someone else's party, but luckily I asked if we could get the open table in the middle of the room and she obliged.  I loved the wine list, and want to go back and try the beer's.  The bread and butter was really really good.  The appetizer's we tried were yummy- Patatu and a Tomato Salad.  However, the yummy stopped with our entrees.  A seafood Risotto special with tasteless shrimp, but delicious asparagus, and the Grilled Cod again tasteless but for the mashed potatoes.  The dessert redemmed the restaurant again (pistachio ice cream and the apple tart) however for what we paid it wasn't worth the bland entrees.  I may go back and check out the brunch, but I'd only go back for dinner if someone else was paying!",2,0,2,Adrienne B.,"New York, NY",40,322,5
5.0,2/28/2007,"A great little find in the often boring UES.  The room is warmly lit and feels very lively and classy.  This is the kind of place that you hope you find in France.  Even with the place half empty, you feel as there is a lot of bustling about, but in a festive way.There is an excellent wine list and an incredible selection of beer.  The waiters can help you oick out just the right beer for your palate.  The French Onion soup was divine.  And I love restaurants that have spaetzle! This spaetzle was actually almost liek a pesto gnocchi, but very delicious nonetheless.Service here was awesome.  The whole staff is quite competent, friendly, and will completely go out of your way to make you happy.  It's all about the small touches.  As it was my friend's birthday, the waitstaff surprised us with the most heavenly delicious chocolate cake!  So Yummy!  The light and airy ice cream accompanying the cake also hit the spot.Cafe D'Alsace definitely makes you feel welcome.  I would come here again as a sure thing for groups, a date, or just a solo glass of wine by the bar.",1,0,1,Jasmine M.,"Manhattan, NY",160,364,0

4.0,8/11/2006,"Nice location , in for me, the wilds of the UES, I enjoyed a delicious foie gras here ,followed by the choucroute garni with one of the many beers available. Great atmosphere, not oppressively noisy, but not recommended for a quiet meal with your SO.  The tables are pretty close together, if you don't mind somebodies bag, or even their body in your face as they negotiate the table layout you will be fine. Seated along the avenue to the kitchen I lost count of the number of closely avoided collisions between the waitstaff and bus boys - on one occasion I nearly received an elbow in my ear. That said the service was polite and inobtrusive at the table.All things done and said, I still liked it and will go back, there are a few more things on the menu I want to try like the tarte flambee, the charcuterie planche and the duck sausages.",2,0,1,Adrian B.,"Cos Cob, CT",38,247,49
