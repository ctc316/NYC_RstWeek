4.0,4/28/2019,"Great vibe. The full menu was available from the bar where we ate. Bartender was very helpful explaining the menu and making recommendations. For two people, we ordered the larb salad and quail for the small plates, and the pork curry noodles for the large plate, with a sorbet at the end for a palate cleanser. Everything served family style, and all of it food. The hand pulled noodles in the curry noodles were fantastic.",0,0,0,Glendon M.,"San Francisco, CA",80,45,0
4.0,4/27/2019,"Had a wonderful dinner here on a Saturday. This place was easy to book for a table on a Saturday night. The cocktails are amazing and the food was delicious. This was my first time trying Laotian food and I think it's very similar to thai food. The staff brought out the sticky rice as soon as we ordered food. That's like their equivalent of giving you bread in Italian restaurant. We ordered the papaya salad, the quail, and the crispy rice. I think the quail was by far my favorite. Then we split the salmon with green curry. Everything was very yummy!!",1,0,1,Callie S.,"New York, NY",133,123,502
1.0,4/25/2019,"What a disappointment! What a TERRIBLE experience. Avoid at all cost. Because I had an 8:45pm appointment in the Khe-Yo neighborhood this evening, I decided to stop by the restaurant @ 7:30pm for dinner. I sat quietly @ the bar. The bartender was very attentive. I ordered a drink (which I received promptly) & the special (duck). After 40 mins when the food did not show up, I asked the bartender for a status, who told me that the Manager said, ""2 more minutes"". The bartender also said that ""the wine is on the house & I will charge you half price for the duck."" All around me, people were ordering & receiving their orders in reasonable amounts of time. Orders put in after mine, had been filled. Ten minutes later, the server walks towards me with my order & the Manager, takes my food from his hand, & takes it back to the kitchen. For no reason! And despite knowing how long I have been waiting. At that point (8:20pm), I ask for the check & paid for my wine, (which was supposed to be ""on the house"") & as I am signing the receipt (8:26pm), the server shows up with HALF a portion of my order. I told him ""I need to leave"". He said, ""That's Great!"" (seriously?!)The bartender asked if I wanted to take the food with me. I declined because I was unsure how much longer it would take them. How disappointing! Sad because the place, the food and the ambiance, all looked great, but what a huge waste of time & money.",0,0,0,Nyc S.,"New York, NY",0,4,0
5.0,4/22/2019,"Food: We had one small plate (crispy pork wrap) and two large plates (spare ribs and pork curry noodles) to share for 2 people and that was definitely more than enough for both of us to eat. The food was out of this world! I must say, that crispy pork wrap was perfectly cooked! The crispy skin, the glistening fat, oh my it all just tasted like heaven. The pork curry noodles is probably the heaviest item because that one bowl could easily feed three people! Also, the spare ribs were perfectly cooked and fell off the bone! Overall the food was exceptional!Drinks: I did not try their drinks but was impressed at their wine menu! They also have a nice selection of beers (if you prefer that!)Vibe: Dimly lit with somewhat tight spaces was my only concern. But we had enough space to put my bag and coat on both my sides without any problem. The decor is somewhat more traditional, but elegant nonetheless. They had this cute decoration for the Laotian New Year when we went which was super cute.Service: Fabulous! They were very attentive and helpful during our menu selection. They often came around and asked us how was everything. They also were prompt at refilling my waters. At the end, the waiter even offered a box (as we could not finish everything!).

5.0,4/20/2019,"I've never had Laotian food before and Khe-Yo has turned me into a fan. Laotian new year was 14 to 16 April; to celebrate, the chef featured a special pre fixe menu ($75 per person). The whole table has to participate and all the food is presented at once, which is a feast for all senses! This feast featured a whole fish baked in salt, pork larb, barbecued frog legs and beef, steamed chicken with vermicelli noodles, soup, sticky rice. Very much like Vietnamese food, you wrap the fish and meats with herbs in lettuce, then you dip in the variety of sauces and pastes. Everything was delicious - a great balance of crunch vs soft textures, and sweet, spicy, salty and sour flavors. There was more than enough food for our party on three.As an extra bonus, when you order the new year's menu, the chef's mother will come to your table to give blessings to each patron. We received blessings and bracelets.",0,0,0,Cindy C.,"Maplewood, NJ",5,69,120
1.0,4/1/2019,"The Pho looked good, but tasted bad. Having eaten many Phos before, this sweetish flavor is very weird.The Brussel sprouts was also bad. They painstakingly reduced every Brussel sprout into flakes.

2.0,3/13/2019,"I went there last night with a date.   For some strange reason,the sign of the restaurant is actually a small distance from where the restaurant is. It's a little confusing. The restaurant has a homey feel but when it's crowded, the noise is quite loud. I liked the fact that it's a small menu.  It makes you feel that they're confident enough in just a few dishes.  Perhaps overconfident. When they didn't have a lychee or appletini, I went with a pretty unspectacular cosmo which wasn't really that cold. The restaurant gives you sticky rice on the house with two dips,one of which is eggplant. Interesting flavor. When we asked for more of the dip, we were charged an extra dollar!  Our bill was over $100.  What a silly business idea to charge the $1.00!I ordered the ribs and I was disappointed. I guess I'm used to succulent,fall of the bone ribs. These were tasty but hard. No tenderness here. My girl had the curried king salmon which we thought was very good. I came with real high expectations but was disappointed.",1,1,1,David E.,"New York, NY",363,21,0
5.0,3/9/2019,"I try hard not to overuse superlatives. But I'm pretty sure I just enjoyed the best bowl of pho I've ever had in NYC (or possibly even the world) at Khe Yo. The Nong-Khai Style Pho, available only at lunch, was made with exceptionally gorgeous tidbits of moist, tender brisket, oxtail & eye of round, sourced from Kansas-based Creekstone Farms. Quantities were small, but the quality was so high I couldn't complain. Thin rice noodles were perfectly al dente and somehow remained so throughout a long, leisurely meal. The broth, the all important broth, was a clear, straightforward version, similar to northern Vietnamese style phos, and remarkably dense in good beef flavor. When broth is this straightforward, it can't hide wateriness or other weaknesses in quality behind strong spices; the broth has to stand on its own merits. This one clearly did. Some pho aficionados prefer a more unctuous, collagen-rich broth and by itself, the broth was a touch too salty. But I personally enjoyed the level of richness (rich in flavor, but not in fat or collagen) and found that the salinity worked out when paired with a bite of noodles. Garnishes that accompanied: Pristinely fresh, flavor-concentrated Thai basil and cilantro, pickled jalapenos, a hoisin-based sauce topped with gorgeous, golden fried garlic, mung bean shoots. No lime. This is a pretty limited review given that pho was the one and only dish I tried -- but what a glorious bowl it was! After tasting the kind of attention the kitchen lavishes on a humble bowl of soup, I can't wait to see what other delights it's capable of.",1,0,1,Jane D.,"New York, NY",102,255,31

Service was ok, what I remember, we were ordering items we thought were good. You know we Asian so we gotta get the papaya salad and some chicken. I ordered the pad see ew which was $42! Lol I literally ordered that for the gram. It was ""ok"" not worth $42 though. For the papaya we asked for spicy and the waiter was implying that it was spicy and we were like ok yes, spicy then he would say well I just want you guys to know it's spicy and people have returned it, lol like ok. We want spicy sir. They give a jeow with some sticky rice as a starter which I enjoyed. More then the food itself. The rest of the food was good but not as good as it was hyped up to be. Also the papaya came, and no it wasn't that spicy lolWe finished our food and somehow we talked about our ethnicity and I mentioned I was Laotian.

Service was quick, water refilled without having to ask, and food brought out promptly.Food:Duck Leg with Pate (Appetizer - chosen with Restaurant Week menu) - great flavorful and portion, duck was savory and sweet with a nice glazeStick Rice with bang bang sauce (complimentary) - rice texture was a little hard, but the sauce was amazingly with a good kick to it Lemongrass Chicken Sausage (Appetizer - $14) - loved this dish, great portion of sausage, perfectly cooked with a tasty penaut sauce and lettuce wrapHangar Steak Fried Noodle Curry (Entree - chosen with Restaurant Week menu) - this dish I wasn't too fond of, small amount of hanger steak and an abundance of the fried, crispy noodles. Taste was good, wasn't too much of a curry taste though but was more like a soy sauce.Rice Pudding (Dessert - chosen with Restaurant Week menu) - always a fan of rice pudding, came with a slice of passionfruit and mango, sweet and delicious.Price: $42 for the Restaurant Week menu, an additional $14 for the extra appetizer.

This is one of the few places we found that could accommodate such a large group and it turned out really well. Extremely solid 4.5 stars.Sticky rice - this is complimentary and delicious. They gave about 1 free order to every 3-4 people. Bang bang sauce is the best since it's slightly spicy and sour. papaya salad - this is delicious. bamboo ginger quail - draws from traditional street food with the way it's cooked using a stick. Extremely tasty and the most traditional Laos food that I had here.branzino - fully fried fish. Lettuce wrap your own fish. Good option for sharing pork curry noodles - by far the best dish. Curry has tons of flavor, pork was tender and plenty of pork. Definitely the crowd favorite of the night. king salmon - size of salmon is extremely small for the cost. The branzino is the same cost and it's just as tasty and way larger in portion size. Salmon was done well and the sauce is perfect with the sticky rice.

We were seated without menus and no one came to our table for over 10 minutes, during which we waited and tried to get someone's attention (the restaurant wasn't even half full). At this point, someone in our party asked a server who was leaving the table next to us if we could please have someone help us out and he responded dismissively by raising his hand as if to silence us and practically rolled his eyes. He said nothing and didn't even look at us. Turns out this was the OWNER and manager of the restaurant, who did not even bother to apologize or explain his disrespectful and outright rude behavior at any point in the night. If we were not there for a special occasion, we absolutely would have gotten up and left at this point. Someone came to our table to give us menus and start our order and when we explained what had just happened, all we got was ""I'm sorry to hear that"". No effort was taken by anyone in the restaurant to make us feel welcome or accommodated - we were made to feel as if we were an inconvenience just by trying to have dinner.

3.0,2/7/2019,"Restaurant Week is always a good time to try place I normally wouldn't go to. Khe-Yo would be one of them. When I think Laotian, I don't necessarily think of expensive & posh not that I can't be. I see it more rustic home cooking. Given the location in Tribeca and not like in Chinatown I can see the given cost and clientele. The trendy tight interior squeezes every square feet of space to fill as many tables as possible an uneasy closeness to your neighbor and their conversation. We went during Restaurant Week which I think for some restaurants a good idea of the food being served (while many are bad). I initially thought the selection was decent.  I went for the duck leg with pate on a piece of grilled sliced baguette(appetizer). This kind of exemplifies the mix of Thai and French influences. The poussin (a fancy word for a young chicken - size of a quail) on a bed of rice with bok choy and soy/ginger was kind of ho-hum (it was very good. Tender chicken. Well-seasoned but nothing particularly stood out). My friend got the steak curry with noodles which again was good but wasn't a standout. Upon ordering the server also pushed the bang bang rice starter for $5. I figured worth a try. Okay, worth a try but also worth a pass for $5. It was rice with an accompanying side sauce of chili and eggplant. I'd recommend skipping this overpriced blatant mark-up 'starter'. Service was good even for a busy night pack full of eaters. For the Tribeca scene I guess the people who go here are into the whole trendy pay expensive Asian food and at $28 dollars for pork curry noodles is a bit extravagant in my book but hey that's your pocketbook not mine.",1,1,1,David N.,"Brooklyn, NY",123,631,903
5.0,2/5/2019,"Came here for my best friend's 30th birthday. The restaurant accommodated our group of 17. We chose the family style menu which was $32/person not including gratuity or tax. Every employee there worked hard and took care of all 17 guests! The service was great. One girl in the group has severe allergies to carrots and peanuts. The chefs and employees were very diligent about her allergies making sure none of those items were near her. Some people ordered drinks as well. The bill came out to be about $980. We paid for the birthday boy and ended up being $62 a person which wasn't bad at all considering all of the food we ate. We packed up the food to go since we couldn't finish it and sent it home with the birthday boy. The restaurant made my friend's birthday special by giving him a birthday drink and singing to him at the end of our meal. That was really nice of them. All of the food was fresh and delicious! The sticky rice appetizer was good with the eggplant sauce. I'm not a spicy girl but some people were so they enjoyed the spicy sauce. We weren't daring enough to eat the sticky rice with our hands as they said. Our first course consisted of the lollipop wings (amazing!!!), brussel sprouts (so tasty!) and pork and mushroom bahn mi. If you don't think that's filling enough, wait! We then had pho and then our came the meats as the second course. I'm not a big salmon eater but I ate that salmon!

We were seated promptly, served quickly, and had a very positive experience with the service. The menu is small, but quality is great. I ordered the salmon bowl over peanut noodles with kale and bean curds. The salmon was perfectly cooked. The second time I was less lucky with service. I met a friend for lunch and made a reservation. Though the restaurant was empty, I awkwardly waited at the door for several minutes before someone noticed me and waived me over to be seated. During that time waiters walked by me repeatedly, saying nothing. Once we were seated, the service was slow. We had to flag over someone to ask for menus, and waited a while to order. I ordered the same bowl as the first time, but this one with chicken. The chicken was tender and quite good. My friend ordered a sandwich, which was supposed to come with kale on it, but did not. When the waitress finally came back to check on us, my friend asked about the kale but at that point she had basically finished the sandwich. (This may sound minor but given kale was one of about 3 ingredients on the sandwich, the absence was notable.) The waitress offered to bring her a bowl of kale as an apology - a nice gesture - but the kale was literally just brought plain, chopped up in a bowl. My friend again had to awkwardly ask for dressing or something to eat it with. Very bizarre. I'd come back here again, as it's one of the few nicer and more affordable lunch spots in the area.

5.0,11/19/2018,Wonderful dinner at Khe-Yo. We went as a part of 4 and ordered a variety of food. The fried calamari specialty was the best I've ever had. Also loved the complimentary sticky rice.

3.0,11/18/2018,"Be warned that this place is not vegetarian friendly! Most Laotian dishes use fish sauce. Khe-Yo can make one off menu vegetarian broad noodle dish. The kitchen was also able to make the Crispy Brussels Sprouts (small plate) without the chili caramel sauce, which is also fish sauce-based, allowing our vegetarian friend to enjoy 2 dishes.Despite my excitement, I was underwhelmed by our experience at Khe-Yo. It smelled amazing when we walked in, and our party of 4 sat at the bar, which offers the full dinner menu. Our bartender was awesome, and he helped us through navigating vegetarian options for our vegetarian friend and with ordering the right portions for the remaining 3 omnivores. The three of us ordered 2 full plates and one small plate to share. They suggest ordering family style. We really enjoyed the complementary sticky rice and dipping sauces at the beginning (sort of the olive oil and bread of Laotian cuisine). The spicy sauce is very spicy but delicious, and the sweet sauce is a safe bet. They suggest using your hands!The Berkshire Spare Ribs we ordered were super disappointing. The meat was not tender at all, and I did not enjoy the hard glaze. The smashed long beans were refreshing and savory to me, but were too fishy for my dinner mates. The Sweet Chili Bell & Evans Chicken was reminiscent of a General Tsao's chicken, served on a bed of rice. The Crispy Pork Belly Wrap was portioned in a strange way, with only 3 pieces of lettuce (maybe it was 1 for each of us?) large chunky pieces of pork belly that were not conducive to being wrapped, and some rice noodles, cilantro, and mint. The pork belly itself was good, but it was not a satisfying wrap ratio. The modified vegetarian brussels sprouts dish was smokey and crispy, but a little greasier than I would've liked.Besides the novelty (including a beet-infused gin cocktail that I had), Khe-Yo didn't do it for me. The menu was very extensive, so I will admit maybe the other dishes would've been better, but our bartender seemed to approve of our choices, so it was overall pretty disappointing.

3.0,10/25/2018,"Never having eaten Laotian food before, we decided to give Khe-Yo a try for restaurant week in summer of 2018. To me the food tasted like a blend of Vietnamese and Thai flavors, and our experience here was pretty good, although not excellent.In terms of decor and ambiance I'd say this place is quite upscale. It's done up nicely in a dark, intimate sort of way and seems warm and cozy even though it's not a small space. The little southeast Asian touches add to the charm of the dining area. Service was good and our server was sweet and attentive throughout the meal.We went with the Prix Fixe restaurant week menu. For starters we had the seared tuna app which was good and a fried dumpling that was tasty but slightly oily. For mains, we got the shrimp chili rice bowl (our favorite dish for the night) and sausage with sticky rice and bang-bang (a simple dish but well executed). Dessert was a custard with a fruit topping (good but nothing special) and a ginger sorbet which was a very unique dessert - refreshing, not sweet, and with a pronounced ginger flavor. In hindsight, I feel the restaurant missed a chance to showcase their unique cuisine as restaurant week is supposed to do. Portions were small (as is expected with RW) but some of the really interesting dishes from their regular menu were not available. Food was good but nothing was especially memorable. It's a shame, since its a 3-dollar-sign spot and a strong restaurant week showing would have been a great way to win over some new customers.I might come back here another time for a regular dinner, since their menu does look really nice.

I think that part seemed more Vietnamese though. For the sides I liked the sausage and burned rice.

Watch out the bang bang sauce, although delicious, is surprisingly spicy! The snapper was a bit dry so that's why this is only 4/5 stars. The sweet sausage and shrimp dishes were fantastic, as well as the pork belly dumplings.For dessert, we had this lemon ginger sorbet and a sweet tart like dish.

2.0,9/8/2018,"There are so many positive reviews here and the menu looked so good that I am wondering if we went here on an off-night. I really do not enjoy leaving negative reviews, but our meal was all in all very disappointing, which is made worse by its pricey-ness.The papaya salad tasted nothing like papaya, just fish sauce (and while we were told it would be ""very spicy"" it was not spicy in the least). Fake news!!The quail we had was decent. I liked the sweet sauce on it and it was decently made; my only complaint on the quail was it was such a tiny portion, even for a small plate. The black bass was the sore spot for me.  It was listed as a ""caramelized whole fish""....and there's nothing that excites me more than a whole fish on the menu, head and all. At a whopping 65$, my friend and I decided to get it and share it, figuring there would be enough meat, as we had had apps and weren't that hungry. But when it came, it was actually deep fried (deep fry =/ caramelized), which wasnt the bad part, because deep fried fish is delicious lbr. The crime here was the way the fish was prepared. It was, like, turned inside out and sliced into cubes you could supposedly pick off??? There was so little meat, and we were relegated to gnawing at the fish skeleton for meat. I will say though, that what little meat there was, was quite good (even though I suspect this was a frozen fish). I wish they had just fried the damn thing whole without futzing with it. My favorite part of the black bass was the fresh cilantro and greens that came with it for making a lettuce ""wrap"".  All in all, very disappointing and thank god for the sticky rice for filling our stomachs.",0,0,0,Janet K.,"Astoria, NY",111,11,0

Was around the area for Bubble Tea POP Up and this cute place looked good from the pics. When we arrived, I didn't know it was a Michelin restaurant?! Amazing! Good for you Khe-Yo! We ordered a few apps to share to make it dinner.. and thank goodness we did bc we became so full! To start off, we were served hot towelettes to clean our hands. Why? Because what came next was the starter of sticky rice that we use our hands to Rip and dip into the sauces (eggplant and spicy. Both which were superb!).

Sure, it's Tribeca, so not exactly the most authentic place imaginable. But still, I was really impressed with myself for convincing my parents to go.We did Restaurant Week, so note that. Three dishes available per serving (apps, entree), and only 2 that are not pork (parents' wishes). So it was limiting. Is the real menu that much more vast? Not crazy, but definitely. So also note that.But I thought the food was great. Favorful, but not so over-the-top that some southeast asian places can be. Surprisingly filling, too. Sizeable enough portions, especially given how substantial the cuisine is.The restaurant week shrimp dish was great. My mom's dish was a notably less flavorful, to be fair.

4.0,8/16/2018,"This was very high end for Laotian food in my opinion - and not sure how much of the food I ate was considered Laotian except for the sticky rice and the steamer basket it comes served in.We started off with the lollipop chicken wings and I have to say that was bomb! Mildly spicy, sweet, and tangy. So crispy, the bones break off. My friend had ordered the Pho, which is not similar to Viet style at all except in appearance. I had a sip of the broth and it was definitely much denser in beef flavor, perhaps added cardamom? or cumin?My meal was the Creekstone Farms Skirt Steak market bowl that came along with sticky rice with Spicy Bang-Bang, Charred Eggplant & Roasted Mushrooms. The steak was very tasty and grilled just right. As for the sauces, I particularly liked the spicy bang-bang which I felt was more like a Thai chili sweet sauce, though I didn't think it was as spicy as the waitress described it. The charred eggplant had an interesting muddled spicy kick at the end. The Roasted mushrooms sauce blended with the sticky rice texture well. I wasn't fascinated by the sticky rice much - maybe because I've had it elsewhere or perhaps I should've gotten fish or maybe I should've been more creative with mixing my sauces. It is a very nice restaurant and if you want to bring a date to a fancy dinner, I'd consider coming here again - great inner decor and awesome customer service.

3.0,8/3/2018,"Upscale Laotian restaurant that is great for small groups. There is a classy, trendy atmosphere that is unfamiliar when eating Southeast Asian cuisine. I'm used to quick, casual Laotian, Vietnamese, and Thai food. However, everything seemed good on the menu, but they were overpriced. We ended up ordering the Smashed Green Papaya Salad, Sesame Beef Jerky, Pork Curry Noodles, Charred Fish Tails, and Foie Gras with Bone Marrow. Smashed Green Papaya Salad: it tasted very sour and acidic, and the fish sauce was somewhat mild. I love spicy food and was expecting it to be very spicy, but it only made my mouth tingle a little bit. It was decent, but it had a slightly pungent flavor that I can't pinpoint.Sesame Beef Jerky: the beef had a jerky texture, but it was very tender. It  had a sweet, yet salty flavor, like a sweet soy sauce.Pork Curry Noodles: the curry had a milkier texture, and it was pretty viscous. The noodles were similar to udon, and had a slight al dente texture. It was a very flavorful dish.Charred Fish Tails: special of the day. It was the best thing we ordered! The fish was crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside. It comes with a side of sweet and sour sauce that make it soo good!Foie Gras and Bone Marrow: worst dish we ordered. The cooked foie gras was tough, thick, and tasted very iron-y. There's nothing positive to say about this.Stick Rice: it was sticky, but had a very hard consistency. It was like they used overcooked or old, leftover rice.Overall, the food was just decent. The dishes were a hit or miss, with most falling short on flavor. For the price we paid, the serving sizes were small. You can get a better Laotian meal at a way cheaper price.

I love how almost everything was served with some kind of jeow (sauce/condiment). Just like when I eat at my parents' house!But the standout to me was the beef jerky, which was brought to the table piping hot. It was crispy, toothsome but not chewy. And then the chicken lemongrass sausage, which surprised me. This was sent to us compliments of the chef. I don't think I would have ordered chicken sausage, just because I tend to prefer pork, but this was as tender and flavorful as can be. Now a note about presentation. Like I said, I never thought of our food as being particularly beautiful. I never look for beauty there, but Chef Schwader somehow made the food visually pop out, effortlessly, while still retaining the essence of Laotian cuisine. By that, I mean that he made it beautiful in a way that did not feel like an imitation of something else. It was beautiful in a very Laotian way, and tasted really, really, really good.

The cuisine is more Laotian fusion with Malaysian/Thai inspirations. We got 4 small plates: two specials that featured grilled octopus, foie gras, and the papaya salad and crunchy coconut rice. Def recommend the crunchy coconut rice and the foie gras special! The papaya salad was standard and, unfortunately, they couldn't make it spicier which makes me wonder how it is produced .. regardless, the crunchy coconut rice was excellent with its sweet and savory undertones, and the foie gras was just .. amazing (how can you deny the richness of foie gras?). We also got 2 large plates: Berkshire ribs and chili prawns. I wasn't a total fan of the prawns but the damn ribs were hella good and so rich with flavor that I am salivating as I am typing this up. Also, don't forget about their sauce .. they featured this complimentary but amazing sweet chili sauce that was bomb! Really kicks you in the mouth but goes well with every dish. So overall: definitely get the coconut crunchy rice and ribs- you can't go wrong with those two! Would I recommend? Heck yes if you're in the neighborhood!",1,1,1,Jenn G.,"Atlanta, GA",5,148,105

I sat outdoor for my dinner with my friends and puppy, and the servers were super attentive to checking in on us (even though they could've just as easily forgotten about our table). The food was amazing. We ordered more than we could finish for three people; including: chili bass (omg!), prawns with scallion pancake (yum, but the bread can get filling with too much sauce), chicken sausage (hands down fav), pork curry noodle (can't stop thinking about them), and pork salad (could pass on it tbh). The bill came out on the pricey side ($$$), but we got 2 drinks, 2 large dishes, and 3 small dishes -- and it was an occasion.

It's close to the New York Academy of Fine Arts.I had the pork curry noodles entree and a Sapporo beer last night, and they were excellent. They gave a bowl of sticky rice with chili powder as a sort of amuse bouche, similar to the way an Italian restaurant gives bread. I ate on the porch, which was absolutely lovely in the beautiful weather. The waiter and the wait-staff, including the bus boys and food-runners were all great. This is Asian Fusion food done pretty well.

The waiters were nice, often refilling our waters and taking away plates when appropriate. Our appetizers were delicious. The crispy duck leg was crunchy and flavorful; hints of sweetness pervaded through the savory salty duck. My pumpkin and coconut soup was probably my favorite of the meal. The pumpkin and coconut flavors balanced well, giving a homey, sweet base that melded magically with the cutting savor and acid of the eggplant. The coconut and rice bits added great textural contrast. Our mains, however, were slightly disappointing. The tuna steak was unfortunately dry and thin, leaving my husband hungry and unsatisfied. My stewed chicken had muddled flavors, with small hints of lemongrass and herbs. Our desserts were good. The coconut ice cream had wonderful toasted pieces that added a smoky dimension to the sweet base. The rice pudding was delicious and balanced. The crunchy peanuts and acidic grapefruit cut the sweetness in the dish and played together to make a wonderful blend of textures and flavors.

5.0,1/31/2018,"TLDR: fast service, wonderful ambiance, amazing Laotian food in TribecaCame here with a friend on a Sunday night around 8:30pm. Given the closing time of 9pm, the restaurant was empty except for two other parties. Upon walking in, it felt like I was on a rustic outdoor patio--the walls were made of brick with plants hanging from the wall and ceiling, the tables were made of stained wood, the wooden chairs were sleek and modern, and there was dim lighting coming from candles, spotlights, and a large chandelier in the middle of the restaurant.After receiving our menus and tap water, we were informed that the kitchen would be closing in 15 minutes, so decided to order quickly. Based on recommendations from our server, we ordered two small plates and one large plate, consisting of the crunchy coconut rice, lemongrass chicken sausage, and wok seared lobster & noodles.Shortly after ordering, we were served complimentary sticky rice with bang bang and eggplant sauces. While I didn't try the eggplant sauce, the bang bang sauce was pretty spicy and added a good amount of flavor to the sticky rice.Our main plates came out quickly and in succession. Given the complimentary sticky rice, we were hesitant to order a rice dish, but did so based on the waitress's recommendation. This turned out to be a great recommendation, as the crunchy coconut rice was my favorite dish. We were instructed to crush the rice to mix it and then make lettuce wraps. The rice was savory with a hint of sweetness from the coconut and had an amazing crispy texture.Similar to the rice, the lemongrass chicken sausage was served with lettuce to make wraps. While it's usually served with a peanut sauce, the restaurant accommodated my allergy and served it with a sweet chili sauce. The sausage was cooked really well and was also flavorful.Lastly, the wok seared lobster & noodles arrived. This was probably my least favorite dish out of the three, but still delicious nonetheless. I'm not a huge fan of bean sprouts, so I feel like the dish could have been improved by reducing the amount of bean sprouts and adding more lobster chunks.Although we were eating close to closing time, we never felt rushed to finish and were attended to very well (ordered quickly, constantly had our waters refilled, and received the check promptly).

1.0,1/28/2018,"Terrible service. The sticky rice was so dry it could make your throat bleed; it felt like someone stuffing barb wire down your throat. And most of the other dishes were over seasoned / salty and oily. The lobster noodle was beyond salty as well as the ribs. It felt like the chef felt asleep while he was pouring the salt. The only decent edible thing was the sea-bass and even that was a bit dry and overcooked. I didnt want to sound negative all the way. Haha. So thats that.The panna cotta was so hard and over gelatinized i thought i was eating frozen jello. Rigid policy and the foods were forgettable, so i really would suggest you save your time and try elsewhere...Besides the bad foods, they were also being rigid for not letting me order a dessert from a menu for restaurant week only. I was there for a friend's birthday party. There were 12 of us. And there were two kinds of menus: one for restaurant week and one a la carte. So they said either all 12 order restaurant week menu or all order a la carte, which is totally understandable. But i really wanted to try a dessert (panna cotta) that sounds good in restaurant week menu but they didnt let me order it. And i asked them, what if one of my friends and I separate ourselves from the group, and act as if we are there for a table of two, and order two prefixed from the restaurant week menu, and get a separate check from the big group which would order a la carte, Would that be possible? And they still said no. And really didnt give any reasons. Just said its confusing for the chef to do.And then i asked, then could i just please please order the dessert separately? And they still said No and said i can only order it if i do restaurant week menu (haha. It felt like they were playing a joke on me) and that i cannot get that menu because they wont let my friend and me separate from the group whatsoever. So, the whole group ordered a la carte, meanwhile i went on opentable and made a reservation for two for myself at the same night there. I knew i would never come back here after tasted all the foods from the a la carte menu. I knew the dessert i wanted would probably be bad but might as well try what i wanted to try first originally. Anyway, at the end, i got the dessert (panna cotta, which was terrible...see the video i posted...but im glad i tried it) If you want good panna cotta, try Chikalicious Desserts Bar.Moreover, for my reservation, they forgot our water and napkin and everything. We had to ask for each thing separately over the period of 10-15 mins...It was just a dessert and its pre-made. How is that confusing for the chef to do (their reason)? And water, napkins and chopsticks/fork should be there within moments of you sitting down and getting situated. Bad foods is somewhat okay because some people have talents and some dont. But bad service and attitude are not acceptable. It doesnt take immense talent to be nice and accommodating to your customers. We were being very nice and polite when we asked about the desserts and basically begged them. So i really dont understand why they were being so rude and rigid. And all just became worse and more mystifying after the series of salty bad dishes.For a random restaurant out of all places, they were being extremely unreasonable and rigid. ****To the chef that i didnt get to meet, As a chef / management, you should have known how to train your staff better or created policy that would have given your staff some wiggle room to be nice to the customers and not some rigid unreasonable policies that they are forced to abided by because they need the work to pay rent. Or even better, maybe instead of focusing on enforcing the policies, please take time to taste your foods before you send it out to the customers to make sure its not too salty and dry. Thank you!****And if all this reminded you of the episode of South Park, im glad i got to make you chuckled. Haha. You know, the Germans, they have this word ""schadenfreude,"" which i think describes this situation perfectly. Haha",21,9,5,An L.,"Brooklyn, NY",689,48,151

The house tamarind and ginger soda was brilliant. So was the coconut water which btw comes in a young coconut and they even give you a spoon to eat the flesh. Needless to say I scraped till the last bit. The sticky rice and bang bang is great. That spicy sauce is out of the world. I want that recipe!! It's extremely hot btw. The frog legs was nicely done as well. So was the pork buns. The buns melt in your mouth. Pork was full of fat and crispy elsewhere. Lovely! I did not particularly like the entrees. The snapper was nicely steamed but nothing in that dish had flavor. Meh. The chicken noodle thing in coconut broth/ soup was okayish. Disappointing after the incredible appetizers. Coconut gelato was to die for but the blood orange panna cotta wasn't really panna cotta. Should have been more soft I think. I have had better panna Cotta basically.

3.0,1/13/2018,"I came here with a group of friends. our server suggested we order five starters and three entrees. we ordered sticky rice, short ribs, duck tacos, pork noodles, lobster noodles, and crisp rice. we also ordered 2 coconuts which were very exotic. our server and all the staff were kind, unlike the food to our stomachs. the sticky rice i highly recommend. plus the first one is free so that's a plus. the crispy rice, which we are supposed to wrap in lettuce, had a very unique taste. it tasted burnt and spicy, but nothing else. i do not recommend. next were the noodle dishes. the pork noodles, although extremely greasy, were pretty good. it also came with vegetables which we munched on. the lobster noodles were decent. the noodles and sauce was good but the lobster tasted very fishy and overall unpleasant. the lobster was also served with shell, so if you're looking for a challenge i recommend. we also had the duck carnitas, which i genuinely enjoyed unlike the rest. it tasted delicious, not even like duck. the tortillas were also good, and it came in a make it yourself style plate. there was also cilantro, hot pepper, pickled onion, and radish to top it off. the short ribs were not all that delicious. the sauce was good, but the ribs were very fatty. i really had to knaw. overall, i would get the duck carnitas, if you can. (they made be sold out because well... and they were a special so they aren't they every night). the children that were at this restaurant were either crying or sleeping, so there you have it. although i enjoyed my booth, the duck carnitas, and the atomosphere, overall the un consistency of the foods taste trumped the good.",1,0,0,Cass K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,26,8
2.0,1/13/2018,"I came here with a group of friends to try it out... I was disappointed. There are 12 different food choices on the menu (6 starters, 6 entrees) and they recommended 5 starters and 3 entrees for a group of 5 of us. By the end of our meal there was plenty of food leftover... partly because it was terrible and party because she recommended far too many items. The coconut rice tasted like chile and the lobster noodles were basically 10 noodles and a bunch of beans and 4 chunks of lobster. We also ordered 2 specials and a few other entrees that just did not fit the expectations that come with a Michelin star. My favorite meal was the pork noodles. I would highly recommend those. Otherwise, the menu was much too ""explorative"" for my taste. If you are willing to eat half of a pigs head for dinner, then this is the restaurant for you! If you are a normal person who just enjoys Asian food (like me) I recommend you go somewhere else. Also, I can't imagine any child ever eating anything on this menu, so unless your child has a super advanced taste then this is most definitely not the place for them. Overall, I do not recommend eating here, mostly because I sat at the table awkwardly the whole time eating sticky rice (the only other edible food on the menu) and dreaming of much more appealing food. I think that if you have a very advanced taste in Asian food you would enjoy it here... but normal people wanting a fun place to eat, this is not for you!",0,0,0,Ellie C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,30,0

However, I would only give it 3 stars for lunch so I averaged the two.Dinner: I went here with my team and we ordered a bunch of appetizers and mains to share along with drinks. Everything was DIVINE - everything had it's own unique taste and they give you sticky rice that you're supposed to eat with your hands. Some standouts were the wok noodle dish and the chicken sausage. My colleague really liked the rose and I enjoyed my bourbon cocktail. I definitely want to go back for dinner.Lunch: I've been twice and tried the bahn mi as well as the pho. The food was decent, but I've had better of both at different places so I can't say I highly recommend. Also, the service was pretty slow which can be frustrating when you don't have hours to spend on lunch.

The portion is quite big for an appetizer.We tried the chicken sausage, nothing special about it, it's ok.We had the Chili Prawn, I understand we were in Tribeca, but $31 for 3 prawns is kind of steep. The sauce and toast were really good. We also tried the spare ribs, hardest ribs I've ever tried to chew in my life. What really turn me off was they charge you for EVERYTHING.We ask for more lettuce because what they gave with the coconut rice was basically one leaf torn into 4. And ended up got charged $0.99 for yet another leaf. Then I asked for more bread for the prawn sauce, they charge me $3 for it! It's not $5 that matters. I mean if I'm at a fast food place, getting charge for these things are expected.

I'm not big on marinated beef (especially if it's sweet), but this one was delicious.

That bang bang sauce is no joke, extremely spicy and I can definitely handle heat! We ate the sticky rice with our hands as the Laotians do. For dessert, I went with the coconut gelato but since they were out, they came with this superbly yummy sea salt and caramel instead. Coconut wha--?

2.0,8/4/2017,"Terrible service, get your sh*** together. From seeing the other reviews I see similar complaints, I gather this place has a problem with how it's run and the attitude of the staff which really detracts from the food. I was excited to try this place as I had extended family visiting from Asia and knew they would enjoy the food here. My relatives are elderly and don't speak English, I asked on their behalf if we could close the window that we were sitting right next to on account of a strong breeze- the manager who was also taking our order was not friendly at all, I feel that some of her passive aggressive attitude may be because we were largely a non-white group of out-of-towners and she was not friendly or patient at all while I translated. The food was good, however, I ordered the Ocean Trout and am 99% sure they tried to pass off salmon as ocean trout. They may look the same but they don't taste the same! At the end of the meal, we ordered tea, waited 15 mins, again, I was ignored when I tried to get anyone's attention. Mind you, the restaurant was not busy, most of the tables were still empty. I finally got up and walked to the register- before I even spoke the manager said, ""Yeah, your tea is coming."" Needless to say I canceled the tea on account of her rudeness and the long wait, and while we still left a 20% tip, I will definitely not be coming back. The poor service and slightly racist vibe I got from the particular manager left a bad taste in my mouth.** **Hi Soulayphet, no doubt we should all have respect for hard working immigrants in this country. But I am talking specifically about the manager who is the face of your establishment- wether it's racism or not, no customer should ever walk away wondering if they were treated poorly on account of their race.",1,0,0,Margot M.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,10,0
4.0,7/28/2017,"Khe-yo serves up delicious South East Asian insured dishes. The flavors we all there! My only qualm is that it's a bit expensive for the quantity of food. The duck salad-verrry tasty, the dressing was superb (bit like fish sauce) however I barely base any duck in my salad. The chicken sausage-again flavorful, it had lemongrass and a satay peanut sauce accompanying. So good! The pig face special-$39 great value. The pig skin was crispy and meat inside tender af, I'm assuming they deep fried it. The dish came with rice paper that you soak with warm water in this one of a kind glassware made specifically for this usage (check out my pic). You use the rice paper to wrap the pork, sprouts, cilantro, noodles, and veggies inside. Wrap like a burrito and eat. Rice- given on the side was super dry, almost to the point of being too hard to eatThe textures and flavors were all there! Definitely go eat at Khe-yo. Don't ask for extra sauce because they will charge you $0.99 each time!! One star deducted for not telling us and then billing us at the end.",2,1,1,Soph N.,"New York, NY",11,110,438

I went for restaurant week. We got there early and luckily were seated early in a perfect little corner table. I was happy to have some veggie/pescatarian options.

The tables are well spaced out in order for customers to enjoy private conversation. The lunch/brunch menu is easy and simple, basically with three choices, Bahn Mi (sandwich), Pho (noodles) or the Market bowl dishes with selections of proteins and side dishes to pair with your entree.My group started with a Bell & Evans fried chicken as appetizer and cold bottle of Beer Lao, for my main entree, I selected Grilled Ginger Prawns served with sticky rice, spicy bang bang, charred eggplant and roasted mushrooms. It was ideal to eat with your hands, roll the sticky rice and dip it to their signature spicy bang bang. It was delicious and everyone seemed to enjoy their choices of entrees.Its the perfect choice specially when impressing a friend.

The menu is limited but has a selection of small plates and large plates. It is quite seafood and pork heavy with spices incorporated in most dishes.We ordered 3 small plates and 1 large plate for two people and it was plenty!The meal starts out with complimentary sticky rice with 2 sauces - bang bang and chili sauce. The bang bang was a mildly spicy green sauce and the chili was HOT! All that was needed was a couple drops even for a person who normally likes spicy! The small plates:-beef jerky was an interesting interpretation. Definitely not a Slim Jim! They were bite sized chunks of beef that had been baked in the oven and then dried. They came with a sweet spicy paste and pickled radishes.-pork belly special came with small chunks of pork belly and lettuce wraps and a yummy peanut sauce. Just the right amount for such a rich dish-duck salad - this was a bit of a disappointment. Shredded duck mixed in with watercress and sprouts. The duck wasn't particularly flavorful and the salad was very watery.Large dishLobster noodle - better in theory than in execution. I love wide rice noodles but somehow it was too salty.Good meal!

There were hits and misses, though.Hits:Ribs - though a bit greasy, marinated really well.Eggplant with sticky rice - completely finished, we prob should just add more! Very interesting taste!Coconut ice cream.Beef jerky - very flavorful.Misses:Sausage - too simple in flavor, and the sauce was nothing but too spicy.Coconut with sticky rice - we did not find the coconut at all, only the sticky rice with something crispy as the crust.If you stare at the menu long enough and pick on the right dishes, the meal can be quite satisfactory.

Main courses - the 3 prawns come with a scallion toast and a WONDERFUL chili sauce that's not too overwhelming. I'd ideally want more prawns, but it was really great..

I work in TriBeCa and there aren't too many decent sit-down restaurants around the area (as usually we just go to Brookfield for a fast bite),  but Khe-Yo's service is fast and the food is fresh. I've been here multiple times and I've tried the pho - it's alright overall but better than the other pho place around the area - and the noodle dishes. Honestly, the noodle dishes are not that great. The food is very light and fresh, which is nice, but the taste can be bland. There's not much to take away from it. The best thing to get here are the bahn mi. Through and through, each time I get the bahn mi, it never disappoints. It's $11 per bahn mi (soft shell crab and the pulled pork) and it's a lot better than Num Pang. If you are spending about ten dollars at Num Pang, I'd rather just spend one more dollar and get it from here. The pulled pork bahn mi is very good, but the soft shell crab bahn mi is the best.

3.0,5/3/2017,"Laotian, hipster-fied.Let's dispense with the pretenses. No, this isn't authentic Laotian cuisine. The restaurant is located in TriBeCa, the staff isn't Asian, and the price of one appetizer here could buy you a full-course spread at a a real restaurant in Laos. So please, let's call a larb a larb.Sadly, this is the closest to Laotian cuisine you'll get in NYC, which is woefully underrepresented when it comes to the smaller SE Asian cultures. Skip the Ping-Sai-Ua-Gai, and opt for the Nam-Khao. The Sticky Rice Balls are done well, but don't be a coward--dip them fully in the hot sauce. Get the Crisp Brussels Sprouts while you're at it, because you know you need more fiber in your diet.For desserts, the Cheesecake Gelato (not Laotian, obvi) is quite satisfying, and their cocktails will certainly please NYC's liquid diet crowd (re: everyone).

5.0,3/13/2017,"I was surprised to learn that Khe-Yo is New York City's only Laotian restaurant. If Lao cuisine is typically as good as it is here, I'd say it's only a matter of time before it becomes more popular.We came here on a Friday night and although we were easily able to book a table the night before, the place was nearly full when we arrived. The dining room has an air of trendiness and warmth. Cozy booths line the walls, and the center of the room has bamboo-style tables and chairs. The service is unobtrusive, but attentive.Our waiter suggested that we (a party of two) order two small plates and one large. We opted for four small items, not realizing that we'd also be served a complimentary plate of stick rice. The dishes are of varying size, so take my advice with a grain of salt, but we were stuffed by the end of our meal and probably could've done with one less dish. That said, I'm glad I tried everything I did.-Sticky rice, gratis: Served with fire-hot bang bang sauce and sweet eggplant. As is mentioned by many others, you take a little piece of the rice, pack it into a ball, dip it into the bang bang, and spoon a little eggplant sauce on top. It honestly tastes incredible. It it gets too spicy, take a little break from the hot sauce and just spoon on the eggplant, which is amazing on its own.-Mussels (special of the day): I can't remember the exact ingredients, but I think this was a coconut milk curry with onions and flavors of lemongrass. This might've been my favorite dish; it's well worth trying if you're lucky enough to have it on offer while you're there. Sop up the rich, savory sauce with pesto-brushed bread. Mmmm.-Crunchy coconut rice with spicy lime leaf sausage and lettuce: the fried crunch has a honey-like taste with maybe a bit of bbq flavor. You can use the pieces of lettuce to make a little lettuce wrap, or just eat it as is. This dish was also delicious. Just one win after another.-The quail - rather depressingly impaled on a stick - had a tasty ginger sauce and real pieces of ginger, the flavors reminiscent of Thai dishes. This was very good, but the quail was perhaps a bit chewy. Not the best I've ever had.-Lemongrass chicken sausage - had a delightful peanut sauce, which was tastier and more complex than the average version. Sweet, but not at all cloying.

3.0,2/12/2017,"My friend and I got the smashed green papaya salad, bamboo ginger quail and berkshire spare ribs to share. My favorite was the quail - the meat was so juicy and perfectly marinated. But unfortunately, the salad and spare ribs were rather unimpressive. The salad wasn't very flavorful and the spare ribs were too hard to chew. I actually enjoyed the rice with eggplants and spicy sauce served on the side a lot more.Another problem with this place is that it's incredibly loud, even in the separate dining area away from the bar. I found myself having to shout at my friend during the whole dinner conversation. It's a shame because the ambiance is very trendy and intimate, which would make a good date spot otherwise. In sum, the food here is rather mediocre and overpriced, and the noise level is higher than it should be. I probably won't return.",1,1,0,Elle C.,"Manhattan, NY",21,331,0

3.0,2/9/2017,"*Restaurant week winter 2017*Came here with a friend to try Laotian food for the first time and everything on the menu looks super unique, but unfortunately there were parts of our meal that we were disappointed with.We both got the spicy papaya salad with grilled BBQ prawns to start and the ocean trout with ""pad Lao"" noodles as our mains. For dessert we got the coconut gelato and the dragon fruit/citrus/pomegranate.The flavors in the spicy papaya salad was way too strong, it was too sour and the prawn was too salty, and a bit over grilled - the prawn tasted kind of mushy. By the end of this appetizer my friend and I were desperately chugging water.The ocean trout was grilled beautifully and came out hot, but the noodles were surprisingly cold and very stuck together. They didn't have the chewy consistency I expect pad Thai-like noodles to have. The noodles felt like they had been sitting out for awhile and not made to order, especially when compared to the piping hot trout. I feel like a squeeze of lime would have paired well with this dish.For dessert, the fruits were refreshing (but probably not worth the bang for your buck if we are talking about RW value), BUT they did pair wonderfully with the amazing coconut gelato!!Overall, the highlight of the meal was the gelato. This review is only for RW though, so I would give their normal menu a try because they do seem to sacrifice quality for quantity, whereas this might not be the case if you're ordering a la carte.",3,2,2,Karen C.,"New York, NY",226,66,321
4.0,2/8/2017,"I had out of town guests wanting to come here to try their pig face special. They were very nice about reserving that dish for us on the day of our visit even if it is not typically served on a Sunday.To start off - the idea of eating pig face didn't sound too appealing to me at first, even given the fact that I grew up eating basically EVERYTHING (in terms of bone in whole fish, pig ears, beef tripes, Asian diet everything). When the dish got brought out, I was very intimidated by it - where do you even begin? Also, omg, are those teeth that are sticking out? But oh man, that was probably one of the best pork I have had in my entire life. The skin is crispy and chewy, the meat is tender and flavorful. It is EVERYTHING! Very messy to eat, as expected though. Also adding to the fact that you need to dip the rice paper in the water. But the dish was truly epic and was brought together with other veggies and herbs. Other dishes are decent but not as memorable. I had the curry pork noodle, which was delicious. My friend had lobster noodle, she wasn't impressed. The food is on the pricier side. Verdict: You have to come here at least once to try the pig face.",3,2,1,Shirley Z.,"Manhattan, NY",209,98,30
5.0,2/8/2017,"****Review is for 2017 RW only***This is my second time visiting during restaurant week.  RW menu offers good choices but the portion during RW 2016 was small.  To my surprise, portion was very satisfying this time.  To start, 3 of us ordered the chicken wings (with chili sauce) and it came with 5 wings/drumsticks!!  (I believe this dish is replacing pumpkin soup).  I was pretty full by the time I finished my appetizer.  One friend got the prawns (came with papaya salad), it was very tasty but not as filling.  For entree, 3 of us got the ocean trout where the fish was cooked to perfection and the pad lao noodles (very similar to pad thai) paired really well with the fish.  B&E chicken coconut curry was a soup noodle dish.  Broth was good but didn't have a lot of chicken meat.  For dessert, the clear winner was the coconut gelato and they give you 3 scoops!

4.0,1/17/2017,"Bang bang indeed, the food here is loud in a good way. I had my first taste of Laotian food here, or rather first 12 tastes as I ate my way through the menu. It reminds me of Thai and Filipino food, utilizing fresh herbs and not shy in flavor. I am still thinking about the crunchy coconut rice, it's so good! Shaped like falafel with a crunchy shell, the kind that you can actually hear across the table. The duck salad was similar to a ""larb"", not vegetables but rather a mix of things with a dressing. I loved the sesame beef jerky which was sweeter and so good with rice. We had this amazing tuna tartare with bone marrow and foie gras, a trifecta of indulgences that are weird together yet really amazing together. The Berkshire Spare Ribs were a little underwhelming, but provide a little break from the spicy foods. Wok-seared lobster and noodles are made with wide rice noodles, and I preferred that over the pork curry noodles (flavors didn't come together as well for me). Highly recommend the charred curry king salmon. Order sticky rice, roll it into a ball with your hands, dip into bang bang sauce and spoon the mushrooms on top, repeat. The climax of the meal was the crispy pig face. Yes, the pig's face (still completely intact) was placed on a platter accompanied by fresh vegetables and rice paper wrappers. DIY summer roll-style. Although I felt some guilt with it staring me down, I must say that was some seriously delicious pork. As a lover of meat on the bone (so much more flavor), this was the cream of the crop - tender tender meat, crunchy skin (like cracklin's), and even the ear cartilage had a crazy crunch like the best potato chip you've ever had. It's not for the faint-hearted, but be a little adventurous and you'll be rewarded. Desserts included a refreshing lime sorbet over dragon fruit, and a warm chocolate cake. The Chef is an awesome and chill guy, very passionate about cooking and sharing Laotian food. Hoping to return on Laotian New Years in April to meet his mom, who is like most moms, an amazing chef and inspiration herself.

4.0,1/15/2017,"Khe-yo was definitely a delicious experience, but I wish the service were a little bit quicker. I walked in a few minutes after the restaurant opened for lunch and there was only one other table (seating 2 people) there. The server was really friendly, but seemed preoccupied. Despite that I would still go back. The menu wasn't daunting and they only had a few items to choose from, which I actually kind of like--it's a nice change of pace from always having to choose between 10948028932 menu items. I had the chicken with rice noodles--it was basically vermicelli. I was craving SE Asian food for the longest time and this place hit the spot..I mean, BULLSEYE. The sauce was just tangy enough and the vegetables and herbs were fresh and had a great crunch to them. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the chicken wasn't dry, but moist and juicy too. The portion size was just right for me--I left feeling really full, but ate everything in my bowl. That being said though, this place is on the pricier end, especially for how SE Asian food is usually charged; probably because of location and atmosphere.Speaking of which, the atmosphere of the restaurant is classy, but casual at the same time.

Only app we regretted ordering was the papaya salad because it was super spicy. The waitress did warn us so my fault for being overly confident. The pig face definitely the highlight of the nice.

This is pretty standard in NYC where restaurants fill up and they can't afford to lose seating on people that might not come... anyway... we waited for our entire party to arrive and it was fine with us.INTERESTING! Reallyreally interesting. That's what I kept thinking as the continuous stream of dishes came to the table -with 15 of us, we were basically able to try the entire menu. Each dish was reminiscent of a Thai or Filipino or otherwise Asian dish I'd already had (but not like, American-Thai, more like the food I'd had IN THAILAND). However, there was something different, something distinguishing about each dish. The flavors are strong, some bordering on aggressive (especially with the spice level), and though the first bite of nearly every dish was intriguing and delicious, there was a fine line between the dishes that I felt like I could eat all day, and others that were too much for more than a couple bites.

Most delicious bites of pork I've ever tasted in my life (and I'm Chinese so I've eaten a lot of pork). The rest of the meal wasn't nearly as good but that pig face was life-changing. - Pig face: the pig face is actually half a pigs face, roasted until the skin super crispy and the meat is moist and tender. It comes with Vietnamese summer roll wrappers, vermicelli noodles, pickled vegetables, bean sprouts, basil and a sweet hoisin based sauce. Oh my lord was this pig delicious. Wrapped up with all the fresh veggies and that delicious, pure heavenly goodness. - Bone marrow special: rich, fatty bone marrow on top of shrimp chips? Sign me up! Delicious flavors although I wished there was more of it. - Green papaya salad: Ironic that this salad made me sweat more than a Soulcycle class. The chili vinaigrette was spiiiiiicy. I love heat but my god did this pack a wallop. It was delicious though if you can get past all your taste buds being burned off. Overall, a very adventurous meal with surprising flavors.

As two individuals of South East Asian descent, we were excited to try this Laotian restaurant in the city, as there are so few. We were NOT disappointed. Our meal got incrementally better, and started off perfectly with the sticky rice and bang bang sauce (and eggplant sauce). The bang bang sauce tastes like homemade hot sauce from our culture (Hmong). This harked back to our childhood/home cooking, and we will definitely be back when we miss homecooked Hmong meals.We started off with the Crunchy Coconut Rice with Sausage (so-so, but a little too sweet and not spicy enough), Papaya salad (also a little sweet, not spicy enough), the Lobster Noodles (delicious and satisfying!), and the Pork Curry Noodles (also amazing and the closest thing to Khapoon noodles I could find in NYC).

3.0,10/2/2016,"The Marketbowl was quite a disappointment. Our group got all the different proteins-chicken, salmon, beef. Some with Jasmine rice and mine with the rice noodles. All came with the same veggie sides which was not what we expected as listed on the menu. It was a bunch of pickled veggies, hot protein (delicious), bean sprouts and then NO sauce!! As a whole dish it was very dry and unflavorful. Orders should come with a side of bang bang sauce or something by default. My noodles were also cold noodles which I didn't know based of the menu. I wish the menu was written better and had real photos of these because we all would have ordered otherwise if we understood what we were really getting.

Ordered from Seamless, delivery arrived within the estimated time window of 35-45 minutes.Ordered the sweet chili chicken large dinner plate (must be new as not on their site menu yet) and pork ribs plate, since we were expecting Tribeca smaller portions.

One signature called bang bang and the other is an egg plant. The bang bang sauce is spicy but was really good! I also tried their crispy coconut rice balls and they were my favorite. The beef jerky was also goid. The bbq ribs is very tasteful as well. And the duck salad was good for a person who never had duck before. The ambiance is dim lighting with a rustic feel.

Crunchy, full of flavor, and the option to stuff them into lettuce wraps.We also tried the salmon curry dish which is really good but I wouldn't call exquisite.

I came here with a friend intending on doing restaurant week lunch. However, after seeing the regular lunch menu we decided to skip the restaurant week menu and do lunch and get dessert elsewhere. Food: We got fried calamari as appetizers. I got the ginger grilled prawns and my friend got the salmon, we both opted for sticky rice. Calamari was really yummy, but it's pretty hard to mess up calamari especially with yummy pickled jalapenos and spicy mayo. My ""prawns"" were basically 2 pieces of jumbo-ish shrimp on a bamboo skewer. Grilled and charred to death (tasted too smokey and burnt for my palate), I didnt even taste ginger at all. The sticky rice that came with it was not really warm, looked stale (you know how rice gets that kind of shiny cast after you leave it out for a while? It had that) and tasted stale too not warm soft and sticky like I had imagined. My friend's salmon was grilled to death and charred as well maybe the flame was too high because the inside was still raw (had to send it back but the waiter was nice about it).

4.0,7/30/2016,"Came here for Restaurant Week. We ordered the curry mussels, Hoisen and Siracha Chicken Wings, Pork belly and Bok Choy, and Flank steak. We also ordered Sticky Rice with Bang Bang hot sauce and eggplant for additional $5.FYI if you order a la carte, the sticky rice is given free. Appetizers: Sticky Rice - yes you eat with your hands. You don't need to worry about dirty hands or making a mess. They give you steamed hand wipes and the rice sticks together pretty well. Be a little light handed with the hot sauce. It does open up your palette and I understand why it's called bang bang bc I felt someone just hit me with a ton of flavors along with a punch of spice. Curry mussels - by far the best mussels I've had so far. It was so smooth and absolutely no sand residue. I'm not a big fan of mussels as often times it's overcooked and ends up having a rubbery tough texture that feels like there's no end to chewing. Not these mussels. The hoisen and siracha chicken wings were ok, but not amazing. LOL with the sticky rice, curry mussels and chicken wings - definitely not a place for a first date. You'll be eating with your hands a lot. The pork belly was incredibly buttery and savory. Except it was 50% fat that is still edible, but some people may find it greasy. I was slightly disappointed with the flank steak. I was expecting a nice piece of steak, but what I got was mostly dried noodles that reminded me of ramen before you drop it in the water, and just a few pieces of thin steak. It reminded me of Mongolian bbq. I would not recommend it. For dessert we tried their plum sorbet and rice pudding. Both were very good. The plum sorbet was on point in terms of taste, and w/o being overly sweet. The rice pudding was surprisingly good. The sweetness of the rice pudding was balanced by the sourness of the berries it was served with.For drinks - I ordered their thai drink that had thai chili, cucumber and vodka. Delicious and refreshing. All in all, I enjoyed my experience and I am willing to come back to try more food from their a la carte menu.

2.0,7/27/2016,"I hate to write this review since I only ate here once, for restaurant week.  I don't like judging a restaurant from one dining experience, and I expect that the food is much better if you order from the regular menu.  However, food should be well-prepared regardless of prix fixe vs. a la carte, and I probably won't be back to try other food of theirs because my meal last night was.. meh.My girlfriend ordered the mussels in green curry, which was solid.  I ordered the lobster dumplings, which were interesting - although they tasted a little vinegar-y.  There was a large piece of lobster shell in two out of three of the dumplings, which was a shock the first time I bit into one.Unfortunately, we ordered the same entree - the fish.  I think it was sea bass, and both pieces were overcooked. Delicate flavors on fish are great when they are tender, but not so great when they are overcooked.  The bang-bang sauce, while delicious, was too hot to mask the mediocre fish for more than a few bites.Rice pudding followed which was just right.  In the end, or bill came to $150 total, which is about what we spend almost every time we go out to dinner.  Sadly, the food was well below average.  This may have been an exception, and the restaurant is trendy, busy, and probably a fun place to go with a group.",0,1,0,Smith Z.,"New York, NY",0,40,0

Really felt lively and upbeat.The drinks were great -- try the Mescal Margarita, which has a chili bite to it. Between us some of our favourite small plates were the crunchy rice, and the special which was a tuna tartar with bone marrow on the side that you eat with prawn crackers. As a main, i ordered the red snapper and thought it was wonderful - especially for the really cool sauce (this place is all about really cool and surprising sauces!).  Other faves included the ribs.

They also bring out traditional sticky rice and dipping sauce as an appetizer.The sticky rice was warm and delicious -- and we ate it the ""traditional"" way, as advised. It comes with a charred eggplant sauce and a sauce they call Spicy Bang Bang. Both are delicious, but beware, the Bang Bang sauce is the hottest thing I've ever eaten. Honestly.

But you should still try it.For dinner we ordered (see pictures):Lemongrass Chicken Sausage - delicious with the peanut sauce!Crunchy Coconut Rice - little fried rice balls (YUM!)Bamboo Ginger Quail - very good, but a little too smoky for me.The prices are generally on par with trendy, niche restaurants these days, so we just skipped the alcohol to save money (and you only want water anyways with that spicy sauce).

We made a reservation for 6:30 on a Friday night so the place was still relatively slow and calm. It wasn't until we left around 7:30 that the restaurant became more packed.The menu is separated into two different categories, small plates and large plates. Our waiter recommended us to order two small plates and one large which ended up being the perfect amount of food for two. We were first given the complementary sticky rice with bang-bang sauce. The waiter told us to roll up the sticky rice into balls with our hands and dip them into the given sauces. At first, we were a bit taken back since we were not accustomed to eating rice with our hands but the rice had a nice texture and the sauces were tart and spicy. As recommended by other reviewers here on Yelp, we ordered the Crunchy Coconut Rice which was an interesting fusion of flavors. The crunchiness of the coconut crust paired really well with the spicy lime leaf sausage. But, I would have preferred a different veggie instead of iceberg lettuce. We also ordered another small plate, Lemongrass Chicken Sausage. The sausage had an interesting but pleasant taste and paired well with the given peanut sauce. Lastly, we ordered Pork Curry Noodles.

Knowing that Marc Forgione is involved made this a no brainer. They sat us on time even though the place was jammed and buzzing.  Many tables of groups and sharing was definitely in our future. We started out with cocktails and they were big and delish. Each had a spice and a sweetness with tequila or gin or mescal. I had a beer.  It was a mistake. Their complimentary sticky rice and chili sauce and eggplant mix was the perfect starter. The crunchy rice balls and the beef jerky plus three spicy but not too hot specials set the tone for our first Laotian style dinner. Whole Red Snapper, Pork Spare Ribs, Chili Prawns plus three other amazing main dishes rounded out our evening.You can park almost anywhere in TriBeCa after 7pm so it makes it easy and the subway is only a minute away.

5.0,5/30/2016,"It's been a while since I've been impressed by an ethnic restaurant. After all, practically every other new restaurant is dishing out plates inflected with various ethnic flavors. And when I first read the review for Khe-yo it did not sound very impressive. So when my boyfriend suggested we check it out during last winter's Restaurant Week I went with moderate expectations. I'm happy to report that I left satisfied and surprisingly impressed. Yes, the setting is typical of what you'd find in Tribeca. It appeals to the fashionable and hip crowd. But the food appeals to the foodie. It's the first time I encountered jeow mak keua, the traditional Laotian eggplant dip, and I was instantly hooked. Khe-yo serves the dip and accompanying sticky rice as a sort of appetizer to the meal. And open up my taste buds, it certainly did! Really, this is one of the most memorable things you would eat at Khe-yo. Because the a la carte menu looked very good and the price point were very reasonable we actually ended up ordering off of the regular dinner menu. So we had a couple of small dishes, one of which was the special of the night, and a bowl of curry noodles with shredded pork to share. The special was a plate of foie gras, bone marrow, and sea urchin. It was one of the most decadent dishes I've had because of that combination. It was utterly delicious! The curry noodles were also very tasty but I have to admit it was a lot of food. Kinda wished we didn't put all the fixings in.. We got so full that we did not have any room for dessert.

4.0,5/15/2016,"Made rezzies and came with a friend for brunch/lunch on the weekend. The storefront is unassuming, but once inside, walking past the bar leads to a spacious open dining area. We were seated comfortably in a corner booth and able to take in the high ceilings and exposed brick walls.My friend, having already eaten here twice in the past two weeks (once for lunch and once for dinner), recommended the pho. We ended up sharing the following three items:-Nong-Khai Style Pho ($15) (Creekstone Farms Brisket, Oxtail & Eye Round)Definitely the highlight of the meal, the pho was delicious - noodles were just right/not soggy, topped with good quality meat and in a soup base so flavorful I ended up drinking it all. It comes with some veggies on the side (bean sprouts and lettuce) and a small plate of tangy hoisin sauce that you can mix into the bowl of pho. We agreed that we'd rather eat the pho from Khe-Yo rather than having pho at a lower price point from a Vietnamese restaurant in Chinatown (where it would still be around $8 a bowl and have way too much MSG). Case in point, I drank all the soup but didn't come away feeling at all parched.-Bell & Evans Lemongrass Chicken Market Bowl ($13) (Sticky Rice w/ Spicy Bang-Bang, Charred Eggplant & Roasted Mushrooms)While the portion was on the smaller side (though I did see someone at the next table get the skirt steak market bowl and that portion size looked solid), the lemongrass chicken itself was moist, simply grilled and tasted light/refreshing. The chicken was served over a bed of pickled veggies to round out the dish. The market bowls during brunch/lunch come with a choice of sticky rice/rice noodles/salad and we went with the sticky rice. The sticky rice is served with a tray of 3 dips; the bang-bang is definitely very spicy, flanked by the milder eggplant and mushroom on either side.-Laos Style Omelette ($13) (Sweet Chinese Sausage, Fresh Dill & Scallions)The omelette had an Asian twist to it and was both sweet and savory with sliced sausage pieces throughout. I will note that it was a tad on the saltier side, but not unbearably so. The omelette also came with the sticky rice, something I wish the waiter would have told us when ordering so we could have paired the market bowl with a different option (i.e. the Fresh Rice Noodles w/ Sweet Carrot Sauce, Peanuts, Crispy Shallots, Bean Sprouts & Black Kale).Service was cordial and attentive, but trailed towards the end, perhaps as it got busier (there were only 2-3 waiters staffed).  Overall, it was an enjoyable experience with good food in a casual/relaxing setting.

Came here for a double date.  Very easy to make reservations for a Saturday night.  Didn't expect to be seated at the booth across from the bar -- can you say, best seats in the house!?  Definitely request to sit here if possible.  The booth was meant for 7-8 people, so the 4 of us sat comfortably.  We started with the duck salad and the sausage salad off the appetizers menu.  Didn't expect both to be so similar in composition.  Basically, meat over a bed of raw vegetables.  Enjoyed the flavors nonetheless.  For a main, we split the lobster drunken noodles.  I was initially reluctant to order this because drunken noodles are so ordinary, but the lobster really made it different!  Highly recommend!  For dessert, we shares the salted caramel ice cream, which we loved.  You can't go wrong with salted caramel.Additionally, have to give props for the stick rice appetizer.  Didn't try the bang bang sauce, since neither my boyfriend not I can do spicy.  But, the eggplant sauce was delicious.  Also, service was great!We've been long-time patrons of Pig and Khao for southeast Asian food, and have to say that this place is so much better!  We will definitely be back!",0,0,0,Kathy W.,"New York, NY",36,256,1

However, the maitre d' refused to seat us until we were a full 12 as in the reservation, rather than 11, forcing us to mill with our large group blocking the aisle.  Then even when we explained that one of our party would be late and the host would immediately order for all so that we would not delay the restaurant, continued to refuse,  and then agreed only if she could seat us in a space that would not hold our 12th when he arrived late.  There were  numerous empty tables .  We agreed so we could  finally sit and then squeezed him in.

3.0,4/14/2016,"I was extremely eager to give this place a try because it's pretty much the only ""established"" Laotian restaurant in a big city like NYC.  My visit was on a Monday evening and the place was pretty empty and slowly filled up from there.  I had been craving Laotian food for a long time so my expectations were incredibly high.  The menu is pretty authentic but the flavors were definitely modified toward the American audience and almost tasted as if I were eating at a Thai restaurant (no offense).  The restaurant offered complimentary sticky rice paired with bang bang (chili lime fish sauce) and an eggplant sauce (jeow mak ker)- these are typical Laotian dipping sauces and I personally liked the eggplant more.  We ordered chicken sausage (ping sai-oar), papaya salad (thum mak hoong), coconut rice (nam khao) and beef jerky (sien haeng) for small plates and chili prawns and spare ribs (ping sien moo) for large plates.  The small plates are tapa style and the large plates really aren't that much bigger.  The sausage wasn't nearly as flavorful and herb-y as my dad used to make. The server warned us that the papaya salad would be really spicy (it wasn't...at all) and tasted more like som thum- the Thai equivalency and not nearly as good.  The coconut rice was pretty good except that it was sweet and it normally isn't so we added more lime juice to the dish.  The beef jerky was probably the best of the small plates and came with a smokey chili sauce (jeow bong) which is great with sticky rice.  As for large plates, I had no idea what to make of the chili prawns.  It was served with toast and tasted like it was cooked in a butter sauce- French inspired?  Maybe but I'm no chef.  I could've passed on the spare ribs because it wasn't awesome but the long bean salad (thum mak thua) side it came with was good and so much better than the papaya salad!I love the idea of a Laotian restaurant.

We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 large portion of entrees. For the appetizers, we had their daily special tuna tartar with bone marrow and Uni, follow by beef jerky. For the entree, we had whole red snapper and short ribs. They all tasted incredible delicious and meanwhile some of them are spicy, which I did not expected. Before our meals they have a traditional which is the complimentary sticky rice, it come with two different sauces. You just eat them with your hands, it was really fun experience.

We were beyond hungry, the menu looked good, so we gave it a chance.Inside was a spacious, beautiful dining area. We were greeted and had a place to sit immediately. It was lunch time, so we had the menu options from there. It was pricey, but given the area and type of restaurant, it was expected. I ordered the grilled garlic prawns with the jasmine rice and pickled veggies, and my bf ordered the market bowl of the day, which was basically a fancy bowl of Pho. Lol. The food took around 15 minutes to arrive, and the presentation of the food was very nice. My bowl of food was so colorful and smelled great, and my bf received a tray with a bowl of broth with noodles and different cuts of beef in it, and tiny plates of things to add to his soup. My only complaint is that I only received two pieces of prawns. And granted they were large pieces, if I'm paying $16 for a prawn dish, I'd like to have more than two. My bowl had A LOT of veggies, it was almost like a salad bowl with rice and two pieces of prawn. However, it was tasty.The restaurant is a place to try if you want something different.

2.0,3/20/2016,"Such a disappointment.  With the exception of our snobbish waiter who was easily-peeved that I simply asked for the price on one of the specials, the rest of the staff was great. However, because of the tone set by the waiter overall, I lost my appetite and didn't even order another large dish as intended out of principle. Ambience/decor was lovely here. However focusing on the food and being asian as well as having in-laws who are Laotian (therefore I've had some of the best Laotian homecooking for many years), this place failed horribly. First, their papaya salad tasted more like kim chi. It was extremely sour more than spicy and not a hint of shrimp or even fishsauce for that matter. To fail on papaya salad for any southeast asian restaurant is pretty unacceptable, especially for a Laos-inspired one.Forget about the fact also that said waiter scoffed when I asked if they could possibly tone down the spicy level for the sake of my 6-year old daughter. I've lived in Tribeca for over 11.5 years and never have I encountered such lousy service, and I've eaten at Nobu, Tribeca Grill, and the rest of the best in the area. I find it audacious & rich that a lead waiter at a place where they all wear t-shirts is going to come off like this. It took so much effort not to followup with him aside. He later seemed to self-correct as if realizing that I wasn't exactly thrilled with him but damage was already done. Wife says he was apparently pressured or upset by the hostess or manager before dealing with us, but it's still inexcusable.Next, there was the beefy jerky. An insult as far as price for the amount of meat although it was pretty tasty. The only saving grace of a dish that somewhat made up for all of the food disappointments was their chili buttermilk whole chicken large special dish. Also, the Wok Seered Lobster Pad See Ew was decent but again overpriced for the meager portion.Doubt I'd ever go back after our experience tonight there...granted there are other regular dishes I would've liked to have given a chance to down the road. However, between lousy, small dish portions that were overpriced as well as more needed work on guest service (as far as this particular waiter anyhow), I certainly wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

3.0,3/7/2016,"Great ambiance, but the food portions were really small and overpriced. Menu is limited so this is not a good place for vegetarians. Service is excellent and everyone there truly cares about presentation and the ""experience"" customers get, most of whom are probably eating Laotian food for the first time. They encourage diners to share plates and make it more of a family style experience than ordering individual plates.We started with the sticky rice with the bang-bang and eggplant sauces (both excellent). Our party additionally ordered the chili prawns, pork noodles, quail, lemongrass chicken, and a couple other dishes I can't remember. All the dishes with the exception of the lemongrass chicken were excellent. The lemongrass chicken sausage was really small and the accompanying salad was pungent and frankly, hard to eat. This was easily the worst dish and the chicken sausage itself was too small for even one person, let alone to be shared. My biggest gripe here would have to be portion sizes which are not on par with the $$ you're paying per dish. The quail dish was the only one where I felt like the portion size was adequate - but that dish is hard to share. Most of the ""family style"" dishes just were too small. Overall - it's okay but I won't return. I've been here twice (first visit was back in 2013 or 2014) and the menu has changed and possibly gotten smaller.

From the moment you walk in, you know you're in a TriBeCa *hot spot.* This restaurant is trendy, romantic, and buzzing. For someone who appreciates ambiance -- to a point -- I was interested to see if the food would match the feeling. Some dishes did, some dishes didn't.We ordered the crunchy coconut rice, spare ribs, and chili prawns (and a bottle of wine). Call me crazy, but the most memorable part of the meal may actually have been the complimentary sticky rice served right when we sat down. The rice was perfectly sticky and the eggplant dipping sauce it came with was to die for. I could eat that stuff every damn day. The crunchy coconut rice was a close second, followed by the spare ribs and chili prawns. The ribs were deliciously seasoned but the meat was unfortunately on the tough side. I would've loved a bit more tenderness. The prawns were OK; not bad, but not life changing.Overall, this is a cute place to split a bottle and maybe a small plate or two but if you're looking for mind-blowing food, I would look elsewhere.",2,1,1,Shannon G.,"Brooklyn, NY",213,311,69

This was my first foray into Laotian food and I can safely say I will be back to try more!For the appetizer, I had the Pork Belly in Jasmine Rice Soup, which turned out to be several crispy strips of pork belly sprinkled atop what resembled Chinese congee. Though not what I had expected, the soup turned out to be tasty, though slightly salty and the pork belly strips were crispy and savory.As a main, I had the Fried Bell & Evans Chicken with Sticky Rice and Bang Bang sauce. The fried chicken itself reminded me vaguely of Southern fried chicken, though the batter was undoubtedly lighter and more Asian-inspired. The chicken was crispy on the outside, while remaining tender, albeit slightly greasy, on the inside. However, my favorite part of the meal was undoubtedly slapping the Bang Bang sauce on the chicken as well as the sticky rice. The bang bang sauce is incredible with the chicken and sticky rice, and really pulled the entire dish together. Be warned that it is extremely spicy and might not be suited for everyone! Unfortunately, my dining companion had a low tolerance for spiciness and was unable to enjoy the sauce as much as I did.For dessert, we opted for the Toasted Coconut Gelato, which had actual bits of toasted coconut in it. Both my dining partner and I agreed that it was a pleasantly sweet end to our meal!This restaurant week lunch was definitely a welcome segue into the realm of Laotian food and I would definitely return to sample more of Khe-Yo's dishes!",0,0,0,Jessica C.,"Manhattan, NY",4,15,0

It was our last night in NY and we were craving some Asian so Lex did a quick Yelp search and found rave reviews for a place called Khe Yo - which happened to be on the same street as our hotel. We booked a table for an hours time and got ready to go. We almost missed the entrance of Khe Yo as it's a discreet shopfront and was so dimly lit we thought that it was closed. We were seated promptly and the brick-walled, industrial-styled setting created a perfect ambience. The place was lively and had large groups dining. I'm not sure how they heard each other, the place was so loud that Lex and I could barely hear each other!The waitress recommend we order two small and two large plates to share. Each diner gets a free serving of rice with their meal also.  I think this was probably too much for two people to share. The large dishes were true to their namesake. I'd probably order just one small plate next time.

4.0,2/8/2016,"Really cool atmosphere and interesting food! Came here on a Friday night as a party of 6. Even though our reservation was for 8:15, we were not seated until about 8:50 which was irritating since we were so hungry. They did give us a free appetizer though to make up for it (and a really good one too). Some of us were originally going to order from the restaurant week menu, but the policy was that if one person was doing RW, everyone had to do RW. So we browsed the menu and decided to share a bunch of plates off the normal dinner menu. For our appetizers, we went for the ginger quail and the chicken sausage. Quail was super delicious and tender but VERY small! We each had about two little bites, if that. Chicken sausage was nothing special, a little too salty, but it was cool that it came with starfruit which I'd never tried before. I thought that our complimentary appetizer, the crunchy coconut rice, was the best. The rice balls kind of reminded me of falafel, and there were iceberg lettuce leaves you could wrap them in. They were super flavorful, crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside, and went perfectly with the spicy bang bang sauce.Next up was the pig face. This was one of their specials of the night, and is a dish that is a must get just for the experience! You get an entire pig face profile on a huge plate along with lettuce, vermicelli noodles, and onions. There are rice paper sheets which you dip in warm water to soften, in which you wrap the meat and toppings. The meat was very fatty but rich in flavor. It was quite a messy ordeal but also fun and unique.We also ordered the chili prawns, which I also really loved. You get about 5 big, juicy prawns atop thick pieces of toast drenched in this tangy spicy cream sauce. So delicious!The two noodle dishes we got were the pork curry noodles and the lobster pad see ew. These were more underwhelming. Lobster pad see ew was better, with a generous amount of lobster, but leaned a little on the sweeter side. Curry noodles were not anything special - similar to curry noodle dishes you could get at any old Thai restaurant at half the price.For dessert we ordered the rice pudding and almond ice cream. They were okay in my opinion, and I preferred the rice pudding over the ice cream for its uniqueness. I liked that it came with pomegranate seeds and peanuts - added a nice crunchy texture.Overall really great place to try more exotic foods and have a fun time with friends!

4.0,2/3/2016,"I went here for restaurant week, and the meal was awesome in parts, and four stars.  By far my favorite part of the meal (not pictured) was my husband's chicken soup. It had notes of ginger and chilli and was just A+ phenomenal, and was a joy to eat. When I come back, I hope that is on the menu again. The sticky rice we ordered was good and fun to eat, but I could have skipped it; just note that the bang bang sauce is VERY spicy! The dumplings I ordered were delicious, but not as completely incredible as the chicken soup - I didn't think they were special.As far as entrees - my husband ordered the red snapper curry. It was good and enjoyable, but I did not adore it. I ordered the caramelized chilli catfish over jasmine rice and u choy. The fish was absolutely perfectly cooked and flavored - it was spicy and sweet and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and it was pleasant to have the u choy (apparently a relative of bok choy) to complement the meal. We both enjoyed our rice pudding dessert, though it might have been nice to have ordered blood orange sorbet as a nice cool down.In any case, the service was excellent. The wait staff was very attentive and the food arrived at a great time. It was fun to try a new cuisine - Laotian cuisine! I would love to try more Laotian dishes!I can say both my husband and I had a wonderful night out and truly enjoyed our experience at this restaurant.",1,0,0,Racquel R.,"Forest Hills, NY",215,165,183
2.0,1/31/2016,"*** First YELP & 2-Star Review *** Normally I would not take the trouble to post reviews for Yelp restaurants - be the experience good or bad. The good ones will always attract me; the bad ones, I would spread the words with friends and never go again. Also reviews are subjective, which are absolutely applicable to what I am about to write below. I am not comfortable publishing negative ratings based on subjective perceptions so as not to mislead anyone. However, for this time I feel compelling responsibility to share my experience to the community after feeling somewhat being ""misled"" by the overwhelmingly positive reviews on this Khe-Yo in the hope that my personal experience can help counter-balance the overly-inflated ratings and hype for Restaurant Week.  Under the dim light stands the wood-carved ""Khe-Yo"" store sign, a low-key spot which is easily betrayed by the long queue wrapped around outside the entrance at a 7-pm Friday night. Luckily my friend and I have long made the reservation and went in smoothly without any hassle. Waiters are amiable, the interior decor cozy and modern - the typical hardware for an upscale establishment in the city. Nothing to complain yet. We get seated shortly, and was presented the menu by a waiter with a smile that is warm enough to melt the Jan snow. Menu is small, names are cute/exotic, and choices were few. We decide to go with the RW menu first as planned.  I got a banana leaf minty salad, a coconut rice noodle broth with minced Snapper (this is huge - I will go through details later), and Blood Orange Sorbet combo; my friend ordered the pork dumpling, beef broccoli stir-fried noodle, and rice-pudding combo. All set, 2 girls after a long working week waiting anxiously for a comfort dinner - In hindsight how naive were we! Food came fast. I have only had banana leaf once years ago when I was traveling in Thailand so was excited to try it out again in the States. The salad has sharp minty taste with Sesame oil spread on top. A little spicy for me but people are different. I do not have strong feelings against the salad - the portion is understandably tiny for a typical upscale place. I was bit shocked though when I overheard a lady sitting next to me chatting away to the gentleman across her how she ""loves the banana leaf salad and that it is the best salad she ever had and that if she had to choose one dish to leave on for the rest of her life it gotta be this banana leaf salad "" -  very dramatic comment but she may have other motives like getting his attention etc which let's just not take it too serious.  Nothing particularly about the pork dumpling for my friend - the skins are flat, pork tiny, below expectations. Main dish is hilarious. And both my friend and my faces were wearing the ""Are-you-kidding- me"" look when the plates are delivered. I shall start with my coconut-broth rice noodle with shredded Snapper. To me this bowl of noodle broth is more like overnight left-over for a lazy morning - why is the portion only 1/3 of the usual size you get from a regular tasty Thai place? And more devastatingly, the scanty rice noodles did not come in complete form. Rather they look like having being chewed off half-way. And hello, why is the shredded Snapper? Because I do not see ANY. No wonder the waiter made a polite yet hesitant FYI remark before I ordered that the Snapper did not come in wholes - it is chopped up and part of the broth. But are you saying it is a fish broth, or the fish is chopped up and thrown into the broth? Because the closest thing I can find related to fish in the broth is a bread-crumb-shaped stuff, which may be battered fish minces. As for the broccoli beef fried noodles ... I do not want to speak for my friend, but her noodles are literally poured from the instant noodle package where you can easily find at any Asian supermarket. I do not understand why the chef have to fried them, but she ended up having to munch on a tiny cluster of snacks. I cannot comment much on the beef and broccoli because I did not have them, but from what I saw, they are chopped up in extremely tiny bits, but at least visible, which beats mine invisible ""Snapper""broth.  We stared at each other swallowing down the main dish with sinking hearts. It didn't take long before we snacked up the dishes. With what happened prior, we now have a much calmer mentality for the closing dessert, and were glad that we managed our expectations. The rice pudding for my friend was no better than the yogurt you get from Pret A Manager at $4 but at almost 1/3 of the size. The blood orange sorbet is regular sorbet, nothing particular. Having said much, you can imagine the WTH that went through our minds when the bill came up on table with outstanding $84 including taxes. This is going to be a remarkable dinner in 2016, because I do not think I will be able to find similarly priced combo with so hilarious food quality. Why are there so many good ratings here is beyond me.",2,3,1,Lizhi D.,"Jersey City, NJ",12,2,0
2.0,1/31/2016,Really wanted to love this place.  Came here for brunch. The service was good and our table of 9 was well attended to.  So why the low rating?  The food was just average or overpriced - take your pick.  I tried the prawn bowl and the skirt steak bowl.  The skirt steak was cook well and with the sticky rice the dish was filling.  Unfortunately I ordered the short rib and received the wrong dish.  Decided not to send it back because I didn't want to ruin it for the group.  The prawn bowl was good as well but it only comes with two.  Three would have definitely been appreciated.

Even though our table was ready, the maitre d told us we couldn't sit until everyone had arrived, even though my mother in law is elderly. My mother in law also asked her if we could sit, but she once again replied in an arrogant and condescending tone that my MIL would just need to stand and wait. It would have been different if there was an area near the entrance where patrons could sit and wait, but there isn't even standing room! We walked out and dined next door at Takahachi instead, where we did need wait but there were benches in the entryway for guests to sit.

2.0,1/19/2016,"Granted I have only ordered from Khe-Yo once and I didn't have the full-on, sit-down, dining experience that probably would have made my experience better, more or less. Placed an order for their Bell & Evans Lemongrass Chicken with Fresh Rice Noodles Market Bowl. I didn't realize it'd come in a takeout paper box, which wasn't the biggest of my problems, although the food was much more watery than I expected it to be (more on that later). When I first opened the box, I couldn't wait to chime in because the grilled chicken looked delicious, but I couldn't help but wonder why there was so much water underneath--I know I didn't go for noodle soup, though it does look like stir-fried pho. I brushed it off, thinking the water excess was probably from the steam, but no. It was the juice from the loads of pickled carrots and turnip it came with. I'm not sure if it's supposed to have a sour, pickled taste, but the juice soaked up most of the noodles and I ended up eating pickle-juiced noodles. Had it not been for that overpowering taste, I think I would've really enjoyed the noodles overall. Sadly, I had to toss this because I couldn't go through with a meal that was sour. The chicken was the only good part of it and was grilled perfectly, but that also started to taste like the rest of the meal as I got through halfway. I can't compare this to other Laotian food because, frankly, this was my first time having Laotian food (an upscale one, too), but I'm positive there is so much more (and better) that defines Laotian cuisine. That being said, even though this place left a sour taste in my mouth (literally), this is the only restaurant in New York that serves Laotian-inspired (notice I said ""inspired"" because it is not Laotian-operated) food, I would be opened to coming back for brunch to give this place another chance.",1,0,2,Sharon T.,"Queens, NY",856,1061,1832

This restaurant is definitely hipper than I am accustomed to for Southeast Asian food but it definitely did not disappoint. It is a tad expensive but I do think it is worth it for the quality of food you are getting. I was pretty hungry but two entrees was plenty for me and a friend. What we ordered:Red Snapper Curry with half a dozen of bay scallops: Holy moly. This dish was a beautiful blend of textures and flavors. It comes with vermicelli, raw vegetables, a creamy decadent curry, and perfectly cooked skewered scallops. This dish went quick. Chili Prawns: I really hate paying such a premium for a few prawns at other restaurants but this was out of this world. Though the prawns were a little too cooked for my liking (probably could have been cooked 30 seconds less), the sauce that it was bathing in was phenomenal. The dish also came with beautifully buttered toast to mop up the sauce. If you get this dish, make sure to suck the contents in the head too--that's where all the creamy good stuff is!

5.0,11/13/2015,"My favorite restaurant in New York, hands down, is this little Laotian gem. I lived very close when I spent my summer in the city, so Khe-Yo was my go-to for dinner. Being right off the 123 line makes it a very accessible location as well. The vibe is fun but intimate, never overwhelming. The service is immaculate. Most of the dishes are easy to share, so you can avoid serious meal envy. The chef typically does specials and the menu changes quite often so see what your waitstaff recommends for the day.Rather than bread & butter, this Laotian spot serves up sticky rice with different sauces. The eggplant sauce is my personal favorite. The bang-bang sauce is intense.The crunchy coconut rice with sausage is my #1. I love wrapping it up in the lettuce that accompanies it. Be careful with crushing the red peppers if you're not spice-tolerant because it can easily make the dish too hot. When the sriracha chicken wings are on the menu I highly recommend them. They are crispy fried wings of delicious, in a hot sauce that is neither overwhelming nor boring. Don't pass these up.Bamboo ginger quail is an adorable and tasty dish, but so tiny that the overall value is less than I would like.Whole caramelized sea bream was very well done--not too fishy.

(but this is just a preference)brussel sprouts, good, the combination of the pickles and pepper are slightly more interesting than the others dishes.sausage, with starfruit (very common at where I from, but never had it in dishes), vietnamese coriander, lettuce and peanut sauce. peanut sauce is the same as those you'd typically have in a thai restaurant (couldn't remember exactly but for sure it tastes extremely ordinary from my experiences), the starfruit is flavorless compares to what I used to have, so it only adds a little water-ish texture to the dish. it might be more interesting if the starfruit has more of the actual starfruit flavor.   ginger grilled quail, a little disappointing, chest is a bit dry (not too bad, since it is a small bird) with chinese kale and the bang bang sauce. it's hard to feel that caramelized and bang bang sauce go well together, seems to me a cut corner solution.in general the dishes are executed well, but don't expect it to be something surprising / creative.

We split the pork curry noodles and roasted chicken special (not on the menu). Pork curry noodles came highly recommended by many waitstaff and I loved it. It came in a very flavorful coconut soup that made you want to order another to go. I don't think anything made in this soup could taste not-spectacular. The roasted chicken special was also great. Chicken was super soft and juicy. Nothing out of this world, but definitely a well-made dish. All meals come with a complimentary side of bang-bang, which is sticky rice meant to be eaten with your hands. Was definitely the most cultural dish and was fun to eat. Be warned the bowl of spices it comes with is really spicy but the eggplant was cool and refreshing. They refill the eggplant side if you run out too, which is good cause I needed like ten of them.

3.0,8/27/2015,"The first few times I dined here, it was 5-stars without any hesitation. The food is phenomenal. The ambiance is terrific. The drinks are a delight. The Bang Bang sauce is ridiculously spicy and addictive. Always looked forward to returning.Then I returned a few more times, in the past 2 months, once for brunch and the other for dinner. The one thing that has changed, in my experience, is the service. This restaurant is not very large but for some reason, everything takes forever. I always say that I can wait almost forever for my food as long as I have a cocktail in hand. But when no one even asks to take your drink order... and then when you finally do order it, it takes 15 minutes to arrive, that's not good.I know I will go back again and again because the food really is that good. Hopefully I can bump this up a star one day. And I will probably just go back for dinner - better ambiance.",0,0,0,Kathleen H.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",44,377,12
4.0,8/25/2015,"I don't want to be too critical since I am a fellow Laotian. You do not hear of many Laotian restaurants around the country so I'm happy to see one in NY. When I walked in I was super excited to see the decor that reminded me of my parents home (filled with fabrics and items brought home from their visit to Laos).  When you visit a Laotian home (including ours) the host will always great you with ""Ghen Kow La Boh?"" = ""have you eaten?"" Even if there isn't food readily available, we will make you something. If you leave a Laotian persons home hungry, it's your own fault. I often joke with friends that you can feed a Laotian family of 4 with $10 and it's a true statement! To the food! We received the complimentary sticky rice and Jaew. First of all... I grew up on sticky rice and if we weren't avoiding carbs now, I would make it every week. Sticky rice is a staple in every Laotian household and everyone knows how to make it. 1 sign that someone does not know how to make it well, if the rice is too moist and it sticks to your fingers/hands. Sticky rice is easy to make and easy to mess up, that night, someone messed up. We also had the grilled fish dish which was good. Thum Mak Hoong (papaya salad) and Seen Savan (heavenly beef).  I get it, since most of your patrons are American you have to cater to their taste. The last item we had was the Nam Kow (coconut fried rice).  This is one of my favorite Laotian dishes. Whenever we have a family function I make a large batch of it. Some people make it differently but the taste is very similar. For example, some people will put pickled garlic in it, peanuts, or fried red chili peppers and some will omit some or all of the extra garnishes. Either way, the flavors are similar. Boy, was I disappointed when I had this dish. Again, I am being critical since I've had great Nam Kow. This dish was too sweet. You should be able to taste the shredded coconut in the rice and it will compliment the red curry mix with the rice before you deep fry it. But it tasted like after they fried the rice they just poured a bunch of sweet chili sauce (normally eaten with fried egg rolls) over the rice. Yikes! This dish totally threw me off. Remember when i said that a Laotian family can feed a family of 4 for $10, this meal for 3 cost us over $150. I wasn't too impressed with the food and a little disappointed that we are introducing Laotian food to the world this way. The flavors from Laotian cuisines are so unique, I know from experience that we can stay true to our flavors and people (including Americans) will still love it.

4.0,8/17/2015,"The only problem with my meal at Khe-Yo was that it went downhill. That doesn't sound great at first, but if you start on a really high mountain and go downhill, then you might still be pretty high up at the end of your descent.At Khe-Yo, the mountain that your journey begins on is the Bang Bang sauce. This will blow you away! It comes alongside some sticky rice, which was lukewarm and somewhat dull in texture, but took on divine qualities once drizzled with Bang Bang.The rest of the meal hovered between 3 and 4 stars. The papaya salad was tasty, but lacked that last bit of zing (some slivers of bird chillies would have been perfect). The spare ribs were good, but perhaps a bit tougher than you would get at a great barbecue joint like Hill Country or Blue Smoke. The red snapper was tender and flavourful, but seemed rather lonesome sitting alongside a few wisps of asparagus. Other dishes whose names I forgot weren't memorable because they tasted good, but not great.Everything takes on a different hue, however, if you sprinkle some Bang Bang on it. So what did we do before we left? We sweet talked the waitress into getting us a small bottle of it to take home. And that's what tipped the scale here to get to 4 stars: the service was great.

4.0,8/14/2015,"It was my first time having Laotian cuisine and I was impressed! There are similarities between Laotian and northern Thai food, although there are subtle differences as well. We were served complimentary sticky rice with bang bang sauce. The rice was amazing but beware, the sauce is potent. We also tried the beef jerky, crunchy coconut rice and the blue fin tuna to start. The coconut rice is amazing and I love the spicy sausage in it. The tuna is expensive for the size and it's similar to dishes you can get at Japanese restaurants. We also got the caramelized Black Sea bass, which was crispy and sweet and came with a bunch of herbs and vegetables for wrapping. We also got the pigs head, which was a little too crispy for my taste.  They provided rice wrappers for you to wrap the meat, noodles and herbs in.

Fun ambiance for a relaxed date or cocktails / small plates at the bar. I definitely recommend eating tapas style and favoring the small plates as they were more complex and interesting in flavor than the mains.  Strongly recommend the crunchy coconut rice.

3.0,7/30/2015,"I booked through sosh once back in April or May. The entrees and plates were VERY amazing and the portions were very generously sized. We had soups, salads, Huge stone crab, giant whole sea bass, and other dishes I can't name. We booked with sosh last week again being that we had such a great experience the first time and I must say the second time around was a let down. The plates were very basic and small. We were waiting for like a signature plate to bring the experience to life and it just didn't happen. The final plate was a whole fish of some sort that was rather small, and was mostly bones. Being that I'm from Laos I can see that the plates we had were very minimal and very easy to make, not worth the cost of the sosh package. The first time around it was worst it and we left very full and satisfied, the other night we left hungry and ended up going to St.marks for skewers right after. Not to mention the first time around also, the dessert was a mountain sized scoops of sorbet and it was to die for, the second time around we both got 2 tiny little cups of rice pudding which was ok.

1.0,7/27/2015,"To most westerners, the taste is exotic enough to be wowed for.However, I have to say it's not very Laotian. The menu has been carefully crafted to compromised the westerners liking. For example, you'd not find Blue Fin Tuna in a typical Laotian menu. To me it's just not authentic enough.They're also selling street food with Four Seasons Hotel price. The proportion is hideous! We paid $12 for half of a sausage and $17 for a few strings of noodle-size tuna with little veggies. That's $29 spent on just one bite for each of us three.The entree is also disappointing. The Black Sea Bass we ordered wasn't even fresh. I can clearly tell since I grew up with seafood. They also deep deep fried it until it's so so hard that I guess it helped get rid of the unfresh fish smell. It's so hard that the meat is sticking with the bones and you can't separate the two with forks. And it's a small fish with not much to eat to begin with. And yes, we paid $36 for it.After all, I feel sad that they seemed to have a good idea but didn't execute correctly. Laotian food is rare in NYC and I was exciting to come try. This is definitely not the impression I was hoping for. Sorry! NOT HAPPY at all.",4,2,1,H X.,"Manhattan, NY",16,20,1
4.0,7/27/2015,"I can't tell if it tastes authentic because it's the only Laotian Restaurant I've ever been to in Manhattan. However, the food is phenomenal. The food definitely tastes different from any other restaurant you been to that serves the same kind of dish, such as sticky rice, fried fish, soft shell crabs, sausages, and beef ribs. There was one or two dish I'm not comfortable with such as the ""pig face"". It was a bit too dishearten to me. But that's just me; my friends seem to enjoy it so it must be good also. I'm more of a veggies and fish kind of person; therefore I don't care much for the meat dish. I recommend the soft shell crabs, the perpetual flavor of freshness & delightful throughout the dish. They garnish with grilled scallions and a light mayo. The ""bang bang"" sauce is contains fish sauce, garlic, cilantro and jalapeno peppers. If you like spicy and a heavier flavor to the appetizers, dip into this sauce. I also suggest the imported Lao's beer (light one). Why not try the beer if you're in the restaurant trying the food? Right!.I'm pleased with my dining experience here because the waitress and waiters were very friendly and helpful.

5.0,7/21/2015,"Excellent food! I went for the Sosh prix fixe so I didn't have to make any decisions. This brought back flavors I recall from visiting South East Asian (I havent had galangal in a while) combined with the fun of eating with hands. They serve sticky rice and ""bang bang"" sauce instead of bread and the crunchy rice lettuce wraps are great as an appetizer. Their coconut based soup was very good, similar to Thai thom ka gai but this had noodles and some nice potent Asian cilantro, which I enjoyed. The lettuce wrapped beef ribs were excellent, similar-but-different to Korean style, so if you like Korean Kal-bi, you'll like these.I also sampled a tuna tartar with shrimp chips; was good, not great, but I really liked the shrimp chips it came with. The main course was a grilled fish which was not the highlight of the meal but was novel.Dessert was a wonderful rice pudding with cashews and very small raspberries. Overall, the ambiance was very nice (granted its New York so the tables are too close together), the service was great (never an empty water glass), and the lettuce wraps, bang-bang sauce on sticky rice, beef rib lettuce wraps and rice pudding are excellent.I would recommend this place to a friend.",0,1,0,Zac H.,"New York, NY",2,190,39
3.0,7/19/2015,"When Khe-Yo opened in late 2013, the restaurant had the honor of calling itself the first and only Laotian restaurant in Manhattan. Take it with a little grain of salt, however; while the chef may be Soulayphet Schwader, an immigrant from Laos who grew up in the Midwest, the restaurant is still overseen by Marc Forgione and Nick Bradley, who don't exactly have reputations in showcasing ethnic cuisines. The TriBeCa-appropriate prices deterred me for a while, until a few friends suggested meeting here for brunch, which explains why I found myself entering the nearly-empty dining room of Khe-Yo on a Saturday afternoon.The dining area is pretty bare-bones, featuring several extensive exposed brick walls interrupted only with a few drapes and a chalkboard drawing of an elephant in the back. It's unfussy and probably not coincidentally reminiscent of the decor at Restaurant Marc Forgione, located only a few blocks away. Once our full party had arrived, we attempted to decide on our dishes; a good number of the dishes on the brunch menu are pulled from their dinner selections, so we all veered from the modified egg-heavy dishes.I wound up ordering the Char-Siu Caramelized Short Ribs, a less than impressive dish that featured one lone cut of bone-in short ribs with two small sides of charred eggplants and roasted mushrooms. There was a serving of sticky rice accompanied by their signature Bang Bang sauce, an aggressive mixture of red chilies, cilantro, fish sauce, and lime juice that will jar even the most dedicated spice lovers. The main element of the dish, the short ribs, were neatly caramelized in a basic sweet-savory char siu sauce, but was difficult to eat given the fact that the bones had been left intact. Neither was there anything particularly noteworthy about the vegetable sides, other than giving the appearance of providing substance to a near non-existent entree. In retrospect, was the dish worth $16? In my opinion, no.It's not entirely fair to give a firm rating to a restaurant based on just one dish and one experience, so I'll hold the three stars in the best of my judgement. While I certainly give Khe-Yo credit for highlighting a less-than-recognized cuisine in New York City, it seems to have focused less on the quality and flavors of the food and moreso on the capability to garner increased business. At the end of the day, though, only time will tell if it's a successful tactic.",18,6,8,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

The tuna tartar with shrimp chips was also good, but lacked a lot of flavor. The snapper was very good - just enough flavor w/o overwhelming the fish, and the fish was not too soft nor too dry - just right. The Laos grilled sausage was incredible too, would def order it again. We also had cocktails - tried the bourbon cocktail.

Let's just say this is the type of place where you most likely will not recognize a thing on your plate, but you'll love all of it.They start off by putting sticky rice and eggplant puree on the table, which remains there. They told us to try to eat it with our hands, at first I was weary but it is so sticky that it is kind of like bread, so we ended up using our hands at some point. The whole menu is fun to eat and interactive. It's definitely a dig-in-and-eat type of place, but on a higher-end. Tasting menu-Amuse bouche was dried shrimp in some sort of a thick leaf, unfamiliar but great.They then came out with the crispy coconut rice... AMAZING and decadent.The salad was interesting. It wasn't bad but it was a tad sour and tangy for my pallet, but if you like papaya salad at Thai places, it has the same kickThe coconut broth pork and noodles was delicious. They were also very generous with the toppings. The soft shell crab was a must eat! I'm not the biggest fan of soft shell crab because the shell is never completely soft, but it was perfect here. The ramps were also amazing. Wish I had a huge bed of them to eat. The sea bass was intimidating, it has a face, but it was really good. Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the food, ingredients, seasonality of the dishes, but also, the culture of Laos. She gave us background on everything we ate, and how Laotian people traditionally eat it. All in all I had a ton of fun, and the food was amazing. The place is also ""fancy"" in the sense that service and quality is 5 star, but it's completely laid back in there. Cant wait to go back!",1,0,0,Samer H.,"Manhattan, NY",141,169,2

It was a lot of fun/frustration eating the soft shell crab though. Those suckers are so hard to crack! I particularly loved the noodle soup that came towards the end of the meal. It ended with a fried branzino- FRIED WHOLE. We were so stuffed by then that we ended up doggy bagging most of it home. It was such a great meal- especially since it was on the house.

Anyway, for the entree I ordered the curry duck noodles. I could not believe how tiny it was- They gave a small amount of rice noodles and then barely enough curry sauce to cover the tiny noodle portion- It looked too small to even qualify as an appetizer. For $24 there is no way I would buy that again- total waste of money. Saying that, the flavor was good. I had no issues with the appetizers (They were both larger in size than my entree was) and tasted delicious. I got the quail, and the crispy coconut rice with kaffir lime sausage. Both delicious.

Warning--if you cannot bear to dig your knife and fork into a pig's profile, do not order this.  It may also make vegetarians at your table weep.Docking off one star because the pig face was a bit hard to eat.  It took quite a bit of sawing to get the meat off.  And the complimentary sticky rice was a bit too dry and hard.

5.0,4/7/2015,"I was so so, excited to finally have a chance to come to Khe-Yo. I'm from Oakland, CA which many people may or may not know-is densely populated with South East Asians.. So when I'd stumbled upon Khe-Yo (VIA a Vice documentary), I was instantly sold on the possibility of enjoying an authentic Lao meal just like home! First, I would absolutely suggest making an open table reservation because this place filled up very quickly. Everything we ordered at Khe-Yo was incredible. They start you off with the famous sticky rice and bang bang sauce+some type of eggplant sauce. Both were really tasty!We ordered two of the specials of the night, goat sausage with pickled cucumbers, and sauteed fiddlehead ferns. I've never had fiddlehead ferns before so I was a bit perplexed and extremely curious as to how they would be. Turns out I am definitely in love with them, crunchy, flavorful, and just beautiful to look at! The goat was packed with a plethora of spices+herbs and the pickled cucumber salad that it came with gave it a nice flavor composition. From the regular menu, we tried the quail and snapper. The quail was juicy and packed with a lot of flavor. A definite must-try. The snapper was also another star, fish was cooked perfectly - it had a nice light refreshing lemongrass flavor to it which I love, especially with fish. The service here was good. I was a little annoyed because we kept getting approached by different servers during the beginning of our visit, usually when you go to a restaurant... you just deal with one server right? After a couple of the same questions from 3583453045 servers, we had one server although - at times it was a bit difficult getting his attention but totally understandable given the dining room had really packed up by the middle of our meal. He was knowledgeable about the menu, and pretty funny. So hats off to him. For drinks, we started off with the hot toddy. Really tasty! I wish I remembered what bottle of wine we had, but either way it was also equally tasty. Overall, I'd totally come back! It was a really enjoyable meal and a fun place to go to (good music, too).",9,3,4,Thao L.,"Brooklyn, NY",1228,330,5
5.0,4/3/2015,"This place is my new obsession.  The food, cocktails and service are all superb!  They switch up the menu, but the small and large plate distinctions remain with some key elements, spice and textures.*Complimentary Sticky Rice with Bang Bang sauce and eggplant puree - very filling and fun to eat!  The suggestion upon consumption is to roll up the rice in a ball (with your hands) and dip into the super hot and addicting Bang Bang, followed with a glaze of the eggplant puree.  The flavor combination is perfect and well balanced, spicy but a hint of sweetness.  Its easy to fill up on this so be sure to leave room for the rest of the meal.*Coconut Sticky Rice with Sausage - four balls of coconut crusted rice with slices of sausage, the bowl is served with instructions to crush it all together with a spoon and wrap it up in the baby iceberg.  As a coconut feen, this rice is right up my alley.  *Some special salad of the evening for which i cannot recall the name - bean sprouts, fried pork belly, red onions, sesame seeds tossed in a really great semi-sweet/tart dressing.  Very interesting flavors, and highly recommended by the staff (and now myself).*Lao Lao Sausage: small, grilled slices of meat with a few paper thin slices of mango, lettuce, peanut tamarind sauce.  This is probably my least favorite bite of the night; not to say it wasnt good, but the prior three were just flavor knockouts.",8,1,2,Teresa B.,"SUNNYSIDE, NY",425,190,919

We were a party of three on a weeknight so the roads were pretty clear and parking not as horrendous. Not sure it's a place I would wait long to eat at or to fight through downtown traffic for, but it worked in our favor. I would say try if you haven't.

2.0,3/27/2015,"I'm sorry that we didn't like this place more. With its ratings here and on Yelp we had high expectations, but it just wasn't very good.We ordered for delivery at lunch time: Berkshire Belly Bahn Mi-This was OK and the reason for 2 stars rather than 1. However, there was too much sauce making it messy and the bread a little soggy, and the pork was weirdly chopped making it look like ground meat. I've had bahn mi that I've liked better at other much less expensive places so this isn't really a ringing endorsement for Khe-Yo.Lunch Creekstone Farms Skirt Steak and Lunch Grilled Ginger Prawns-The portion sizes were pretty petite for $15 each, just 2 smallish skewers of beef and 2 prawns. With the heads on, the prawns looked bigger than they really were; after removing the heads they were average sized and quite dry. The beef was OK, but with sides of rice and pickled items nothing seemed like a composed dish. We kept trying different combinations of meat and the various accompaniments, but nothing worked together very well. All of this said, I've never had Laotian food before, so the problem may be that my palate isn't sufficiently trained for it. I love most Thai and Vietnamese food, but admit that I am grossed out by some Asian dishes (usually Chinese and Japanese), those that are to my taste slimey, fishy, or moldy/rotten smelling or tasting. I add this for context, and because there were a few ""strange flavor"" moments while eating lunch from Khe-Yo today.",0,0,0,Sondra M.,"New York, NY",1,8,8
5.0,3/25/2015,"Can't say enough good things about this place. I still have no idea what Laotion cuisine consists of, but if it's supposed to be a mixture of Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai food, then this place is spot on. I imagine that Laos would and could easily borrow and fuse itself with cuisines in its proximity...and that's precisely what made this dinner so damn delicious. For apps we shared the quail that everyone raves about as well as another special that night of bone marrow topped with tartare (this is actually pretty absurd to think about) and thin crisps. The richness of the marrow wrapped around the tartare and it was just one decadent and delicious mess. The quail was small but it really was a whole quail, skewered on all sides and made scrumptious by the slight charring on the side. By this point we were already pretty full given the complimentary sticky rice, bang bang sauce (i have no idea why they made up this name. it's just chill sauce) and pickled eggplant. The entrees were similarly amazing-- the pork curry noodles was an obnoxious amount of food, filled with pairings and side dishes that we didn't even know what to do with. The red snapper, while small, was cooked perfectly, with each filet peeling perfectly away. Honestly, this is a restaurant fit for any occasion, whether it be taking your parents out for dinner, catching up with friends, or even celebrating a birthday party. Service was meh tho-- our waitress had to consistently stare off into space to remember what that day's specials were. Also, the group of white ppl next to us ordered the pig's head and seeing that just warmed my heart. You go white ppl.",0,1,0,Henry Y.,"New York, NY",376,801,1

We had the special of the night which was pig's head. I would go back and order it again because it was absolutely tasty. To eat it, you had to wrap it in a rice paper and put in lettuce, noodles, and a sweet sauce (something similar to a Vietnamese spring roll).

3.0,3/23/2015,"I went to Khe-Yo on Saturday with a group of 4 after looking at the pictures and thought it looked delicious. We made a reservation for 7PM the day before so easy enough. Upon walking in we were 10-15 minutes early for our reservation but seated immediately.  Once we got seated we ordered some drinks and my Thai friend ordered some food as we were going to share everything. We got our drinks and first came the sticky rice with the bang bang sauce.  I guess I should have expected at a Southeast Asian restaurant but I accidently tasted the sauce and my mouth was on fire.  It would've been nice, but there was no warning at all from the server that placed the sauce on the table to let us know how spicy the food was. After that I was hardly able to taste anything not that it really mattered because everything we ordered was incredibly spicy anyway. The only dish I could eat was the spare ribs were quite good. In addition to the spare ribs we ordered the Line Caught Blue-Fin Tuna, Smashed Green Papaya Salad, Pork Curry Noodles, Grilled Laos Style Sausage and Brussels sprouts special.  Since I wasn't really able to enjoy the food I figured I would just have a drink and grab something to eat after since the rest of my party was fine with the spiciness- or so they claimed as they were sweating more than normal if you ask me while eating dinner.  My friends whom did eat the food said it was okay but nothing all too special and definitely not for the prices charged. I ordered the Bourbon cocktail on the menu which I would recommend.  Problem is I tried to order a second drink and was unable to.  After our server took our order I did not see her again.  I looked for a while and then finally was able to get her attention and order a drink.  Please keep in mind the restaurant wasn't even super crowded and it was relatively small.  I finally ordered my drink and the dishes began coming. Once our last dish came and I told the food runner if he could find our server and cancel my drink.  As our meal was pretty much at its conclusion I wasn't going to hold up my table by having the drink or feel like I had to basically chug a $14 cocktail.  Finally the server came over with my drink and asked if I wanted to cancel it.  I looked at her and said since by this time our table was cleared of all the dishes we were ready for the check.  My friend also had an unpleasant experience with a bus person.  She was almost done with her drink and the bus person asked if she would like another drink.  My friend said no and the bus person said ""Well, can I have your glass?"" My friend was surprised and didn't know what to do so she quickly finished her wine and handed her the glass.  For the price of this place I would definitely expect more from the service. First of all this type of food is generally cheap so to charge the high prices on the menu everything else should be top notch.  The atmosphere was nice but I would not recommend this place and was truly disappointed with my overall experience here.",0,1,0,Lisa I.,"Manhattan, NY",2,13,15
5.0,3/23/2015,"I took my partner here for a Friday night date (thanks EaterNY for the last minute reservation guide). The food was incredible, and if you like copious amounts of chiles, fish sauce and sticky rice you will definitely feel the same. I have not ever eaten food from Laos, but my first impression is that it's the all the things I love about Vietnamese and Thai food. We had a papaya salad and raw fish (like ceviche) apps to share, they serve sticky rice and dipping sauce with your meal...and by the time we consumed that portion of the meal I could confidently say is was the spiciest meal I've ever eaten. And not the heat that blots out the flavors of the whole meal, the surprisingly addictive hot that creeps on you until your gums and face feel the heat. But it's so good you bear it, with a smile. It was spicier than crazy hot street food in Thailand. Entree we had the pigs face, which is to share, and you pull pieces off and make your own fresh spring rolls with all the sides and sauce you desire. The room is minimal with a refined brick loft vibe using what I assume is reclaimed materials.

1.0,3/2/2015,"I had made a reservation on Yelp through Opentable for 8:45 PM. I arrived on site at 8:00 PM and alerted the hostess with curly red hair of my reservation. She said she would check my party in accordingly. As we waited, we noticed that many walk-ins were seated before us. Confused, we touched base multiple times with the same hostess to find out the status of our reservation. She discourteously informed us each time that we were ""coming up."" All the walk-ins were cleared and business was finally slowing down. We were finally seated at 9:45 PM, one hour and forty five minutes after we arrived, an hour past our reservation. She was unapologetic and unfriendly. The following day I received a message from OpenTable, informing me that I had not checked in to my reservation. I have attached a screenshot of the email for your reference below. The hostess failed to check us in despite that we had informed her of our arrival and checked in with her at least five times over a one hour period. I am livid at the horribly incompetent service. The mix up put my OpenTable account in jeopardy before I had the issue resolved.Upon entering the establishment, there is a bar lined with chairs of attenuated blocks of wood. The footrests are made up of thick, stainless steel pipes that sprout up through the floorboards. The walls of the restaurant are made of exposed red brick and dressed with green ferns. A substantially large light fixture extends from the ceiling dead-center with at least a dozen naked bulbs at the end of each metal arm. The scene feels trendy and its interior, contemporary.Our waiter, Dunn, enthusiastically and passionately explained the specials of Khe-Yo's Laotian-inspired menu. The meal began with a generous serving of sticky rice. The first round of rice is complimentary. It is more glutinous and slightly sweeter than its basic version. Its grains are soaked and steamed in banana leaves for a distinct and subtle earthy flavor. It rolls around in the mouth perfectly with a gentle tap of the tongue and dissolves easily after a few chews. Khe-Yo's sticky rice is served in a basket intricately weaved with delicate ribbons of red, green, and tan bamboo. This is served with the Bang-Bang sauce which is made from Thai chilies, cilantro, lime, and fragrant fish sauce. Its name can be described mildly as an onomatopoeia... it is an incendiary sauce. It also comes with an eggplant dipping sauce that perfectly balanced out the fiery flare of the Bang-Bang. The Laos Sausage ($12) was grounded with minced lemongrass and Kafir lime. The peanut sauce is mixed with mangos, fish sauce, and lemongrass. This dish was delicious but its portion was pitiably small. The Banana Wrapped Red Snapper ($33) is pan-seared with Bang-Bang sauce. The fish itself was over-cooked and resulted in a rubbery, chewy catastrophe of a dish. The skin was soggy and there were a few scales left behind on the fillet. A handful of crispy baby artichokes roasted in butter topped the fillet. The Spare Ribs ($24) were stacked in a meager portion of six. The sauce was well marinated however, overly brined. The ribs were too salty and inedible. Overall, the entrees we were served were severely deficient in quality.Some Pro Tips: All-French wine list. Additional sticky rice is $3.

J tried it and said the spice kicked pretty hard, but for me it was perfect.J enjoyed the Mezcal Strega, Sweet Vermouth, Lemon - I thought it was too smoky for me.E and K just had the beer, so nothing special, except one was from Laos.They took off some items and kept some and thank god, my two favourites were still here.We shared the following items:Line Caught Blue-Fin Tuna{Laap-Pa} Santa Barbara Uni & Shrimp Chips - Yummy, and the uni was good, didn't taste like iodine - thank goodness. Super fresh and delicious.Smashed Green Papaya Salad{Tam-Mak-Hoong} Green Market Cabbage & Pumpkin Seeds - this was really good too and I made sure to eat the pumpkin seeds to get my zinc intake.Bamboo Grilled Ginger Quail{Ping-Nok-Noi} Bang-Bang & Gai-Lan - This is my favourite dish, it's just so damn good. I was afraid only K and I was able to eat it, since E is a pescatarian and J doesn't eat anything ""weird"". J said will try it, but what is it, I said it's a bird, it's like 100x tastier than a chicken and it's not weird. J was a bit scared, since seeing the entire body on the plate, I gave J a good cut of the meat, since giving J anything with a bone in it, would probably have discourage J's bravery. J loved it and we're super proud that J actually tried this dish. Such a damn good quail - NEVER TAKE THIS OFF THE MENU.Wok-Fried Lobster & Rice Sheets{Pad-See-Ew} Pea Shoots & Thai Basil - We let E decide between the Sea Bream or whatever other seafood. E picked this and J complained about the amount of lobster within this dish and the price point. This place was super small, although it is considered a large plate. I want to say this pad see ew was cooked really well and the taste was phenomenal. But I feel like this is good, but it would have been better if the size was better priced.Chili Prawns {Goong-Phet}Ginger Scallion Toast & Thai Basil - My other favourite dish and everyone gave me their heads....yups, me loves them.This time around, I knew not to order the beef jerky, because it is just not good. Overall, the food is good, but price point really needs to be lowered for the portion size and it just doesn't make sense in terms of the ingredients and amount.J ended up getting fries and dessert at another restaurant, I mean, for four of us and the bill was a couple of bills and yet J and K still had to eat fries to satiate the appetite is telling you a lot.",1,0,0,Ro R.,"Brooklyn, NY",83,2220,93
5.0,2/16/2015,"People sometimes talk about ""cursed"" restaurant locations.  I'd like to talk about the opposite: ""charmed"" ones.  Khe-Yo is in the space formerly occupied by Duane Park, the dazzling and decadent burlesque show + fancy Southern food place that moved (to expand, perhaps?) to the Bowery. It was one of my favorite restaurants in my pre-Yelping days and I look forward to going again. But in the meantime, I have a new favorite restaurant: Khe Yo.My wife and I wanted to have a nice meal on Valentine's Day.  To be more specific: we wanted good food, a nice atmosphere, and the ability to make a reservation, while also avoiding the near-ubiquitious overpriced V-day pre-fixe menus. A Valentine's Day reservation without a pre-fixe menu? Thankfully, I found Khe-Yo.The food here is fantastic: the sticky rice is addictive, the bang-bang sauce is powerful and the smokey eggplant sauce is delicious. We loved the pork curry noodles which came in a rich flavorful sauce and a great collection of herbs on the side. The short rib special was expensive but totally worth it (and much cheaper than an over-priced pre-fixe menu). Best short rib I've ever had.This place has a ""hipster Asian fusion restaurant"" vibe. But unlike some other places in that category (Pok Pok, Pig and Khao), the food here is uniformly excellent and there's no hipster attitude.  The servers may be wearing black t-shirts and jeans, but they are incredibly professional and friendly.",3,0,1,Leonard F.,"Queens, NY",17,195,0

4.0,2/7/2015,"Disclaimer: this review is for brunch only. Having walked by this place so many times and as another establishment by Iron Chef Marc Forgione, I have always been skeptical about Khe-Yo, because, after all, it's supposed to be ""Laotian"", or Southeastern cuisine, and we all know chef Forgione didn't make his name known by making Laotian food. However, my sister in law and her husband, who lived in Southeast Asia for over 4 years, couldn't stop talking about how authentic the spices were after dinning here, so we finally decided to give it a try for brunch on a random Saturday. Maybe it started offering brunch not too long ago, when we walked in around noon, we were the only people there. No problem, that means we'd get 100% attention by our lovely waitress, and yes we did. I ordered Market bowl of pork chop and sticky rice, and my husband ordered the sausage fried rice. The pork chop was those thin chops that's slightly chewy, but the condiments came with the sticky rice were soooo amazing! It was some eggplant side, mushroom, and ""bang bang"" sauce. The bang bang sauce tasted like something I'd have in Southeast Asia, it was spicy and sour and I just wanted to dip everything in it. The sausage fried rice, per my husband, was pretty good too, because he practically finished the whole thing. In terms of price, for a brunch place in Tribeca, it's VERY reasonable. Two entrees and one coffee came at less than $35. Now I will definitely come back and try its dinner.",8,1,2,Lu H.,"New York, NY",294,570,1967

One quirk is that eating was very technical: most of our orders came with instructions and in several parts that needed to be assembled.

If you don't like it too sweet, don't pour all the condensed milk into the icy coffee!!)Started with chicken lettuce wraps, tuna and shrimp chips, crunchy coconut rice. Our server brought the grilled laoation sausage on the house as well, and all were amazingly flavorful and incredibly unique.  For the entrees, we shared the pork curry noodles, and the special, pork belly skewers that were to be roasted on the table. The curry noodles were fabulous. Creamy sauce, yummy pork, fresh, homemade tasting noodles. The pork belly was our least favorite dish, as it just didn't seem very special in any way. It felt almost gimmicky with cooking it at the table. All things considered, this is a five star dining experience.

3.0,1/6/2015,"Love the ambiance of this place. It's so cute!Bang Bang sauce has some serious heat. If they bottled the stuff and sold it, I'd be first in line to buy.Crunchy coconut rice is as tasty as everyone else says; it might not sound like much (I didn't get much coconut flavor out of it) but it's definitely worth trying!One of the small plate specials of the night was a ""Brussels sprouts leaves"" with bacon type of thing. The ingredients were kind of unrecognizably browned/fried. Bf liked it but I found it too oily.Banana wrapped red snapper was a very tasty piece of fish. Menu says it comes with ""Bang Bang"" but it did not appear present in the dish, which was just the fish and a pile of yummy greens on the side. Chili prawns were just okay; I expected the dish to have more of a kick but I didn't get much chili flavor. It was just kind of salty. The thick toast was wonderful for mopping up the juices.The weirdest thing to me was the way the drinking water worked...we were asked when we sat down whether we'd like bottled or tap water, and we ordered a bottle of still water. What we got was a big glass bottle that's just like something you'd see in any other restaurant, which they fill with tap water and leave on your table for self-serve. Our bottle said ""Khe-Yo"" on it. After we drained our first bottle, a server asked if we wanted another one, and we said sure. The group next to us also had a bottle of water on their table; nobody else in the restaurant did. At the end of our meal we were charged $8 for two bottles of ""LRG Khe-Yo Still"" water.I didn't ask (though I wanted to), but unless Khe-Yo is branding and manufacturing its own spring water back there, were we paying for the privilege of pouring ourselves tap water? Or were they filling the glass bottles with gallons of Poland Spring or something? I'm not upset, just confused.That aside, I liked Khe-Yo but probably wouldn't come back.

4.0,1/2/2015,"- Laotian food goes CLASSY - Khe-yo has a warm and intimate feel to it, making it an ideal place for a date or a gathering of friends. The meal starts off with rice served on a banana leave in a woven basket. This is accompanied by an eggplant dip and a chili dip. The latter is extremely fiery as is expected of chili paid so go easy on it. The eggplant dip goes extremely well with rice. It tasted a tad sweet, probably from caramelized onions. Feel free to order refills though they are charged at $1, which is very decent for the quality of the dip.We had Tuna Laap for appetizer ($17). This gem was topped with fresh uni and accompanied with shrimp crackers. It was certainly a flavorful and refreshing way to start the meal, which of course ought to also include some Beer Lao ($7)!The Black Bass ($33) was fresh and served lightly steamed while the curry noodles ($24) packed a punch of solid curry goodness.  Give this spot a shot!",0,0,0,Shulin T.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",22,238,402
4.0,1/1/2015,"Laotian food for $$$? I'm from Thailand and had a hard time with the price, especially since Lao style food is typically very cheap in Thailand. This place came highly recommended and after a botched attempt to dine at a restaurant we had a reservation at, we decided to go to Khe-Yo,The restaurant is hard to spot. We actually walked past it twice without realizing that it was right in front of us. The inside is quite dark and nicely decorated. I definitely did not feel like I was in an Asian restaurant but more like a classic tapas lounge.The food is quite good but the price tag definitely matches the ambiance. Although it's not cheap, I would say that the price here isn't completely unreasonable for a Manhattan restaurant.Their menu changes often so some of the delicious-looking dishes I saw on Yelp was no longer available. We tried the grilled octopus salad, the sour pork sausage, the fried sea bream, and the spicy prawns. Everything is super flavorful and even though it's not the most authentic stuff, I really enjoyed my meal.They also give you this eggplant paste and a spicy dipping sauce with your meal. The sauce is delicious. They also give you sticky rice with your meal even though it doesn't actually go with all your dishes. If you would like to get the more authentic experience, you can eat your entire meal with your hands.I give them props for making Laotian food classy.

4.0,12/31/2014,"I have been very keen to try Laotian food because I've never had it before.  Although we initially made a booking for dinner, my son got sick so we decided to just take out and eat in.  The food took out very well.The bartender who took our order was extremely knowledgeable so after discussing our options, we ordered:Crunchy coconut rice with spicy lime leaf sausage - this is a lettuce wrap appetizer with the crunchy and flavorful coconut rice ball and a thin slice of sausage as the main components to be wrapped.  It was VERY tasty but wished that the sausage was bigger and the coconut rice ball smaller.Ginger quail with a side of gailan (Chinese broccoli) - OMG, this was so tasty and completely de-boned save the little drumstick on both sides.  For some reason, it tasted like a more refined and less gamey pigeon.  It was perfectly seasoned with a sweet ginger marinade.Prawns in curry sauce with Texas bread to sop up the curry sauce.  The prawns were excellent, but I didn't particularly care for the Texas bread which was a bit too chewy.Although free if eating in, I did have to pay for the sticky rice which you ball up and dip into the Bang Bang sauce (so flavor but spicy that my tongue burned for a good 20 minutes afterwards) and charred eggplant.The flavors at this restaurant did not apologize with its strong spicing because it was totally on the mark.  I sometimes wished that there were more Thai places like this that are not afraid to go for the full flavor.  They did not tone down for the Western palate and despite my burning tongue, I really appreciated the taste of everything.My one advice is to order more protein because the meal had too many carbs as we ordered it.  This, hands down, beat Uncle Boons for me on this trip which frankly was very disappointing the second time around.",1,0,0,C T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,112,0

All in all i would have to say that Khe-yo was a wonderful experience! The service was excellent. The spicy BANG BANG vinegar based sauce, is just a single reason to go and try out Khe-yo. The CHILI PRAWNS and the sauce that they swim in, was probably one of the best things I've eaten in months. The Texas sized toast to mop up all that sauce was gluttony at its best. The QUAIL small plate was so tender and tasty. Their SEA BREAM with crunch shallots were equally perfect as well.The only downside to this place is value. The main plates were valued fairly, but we had ordered the wrapped SKIRT STEAK app, which was marked at $14. I was so surprised at how small it was!  Three pickled cauliflower and five pieces of steak as thin as my pinky finger??TIPS:1.

4.0,11/28/2014,"Khe-Yo is one of those classy, expensive I guess sort of ""Asian"" restaurants perfect for an intimate dinner or hanging out with a close group of friends. The restaurant is on the small side, so making a reservation is recommended. I have never had Laotian food before, so I can't tell if this place is authentic, but the tastes are similar to Vietnamese and Thai. Very bold flavors. Seriously, not subtle at all.Starters:Complimentary Sticky Rice - Instead of bread they give you a small bamboo bucket of sticky rice and their signature Bang Bang sauce. I wasn't sure if the rice would actually be sticky rice, meaning glutinous rice, but glad to see it was. Some restaurants sell ""sticky rice"" when it is actually just plain rice. The Bang Bang sauce just tasted like regular fish sauce with added peppers for extra hotness and a kick. It was tasty, but by no means addicting. The eggplant was kind of unmemorable next to the Bang Bang sauce.Bamboo Grilled Ginger Quail, Bang-Bang & Gai-Lan - The quail was perfect and succulent. So much juiciness and flavor packed into that little bird. On the side they have jielan (Chinese broccoli), which I thought was strange, but still delicious. Too bad quails are smaller and more expensive than chicken :(. Definitely get this appetizer above anything else.Entrees:Banana Wrapped Red Snapper, Crispy Artichokes & Bang Bang  - The red snapper was incredibly soft and flaky. It paired well with the broccoli for an overall very healthy dish. Next to the extremely, juicy quail, this dish was a nice complement. The taste of the fish itself is light, but made less subtle with the Bang Bang sauce. I enjoyed the extra crunch from the artichokes.Pig's Head - We got the pig's head to my dining partner's chagrin because the waiter said the other dishes we ordered were small. It's more like a fried pig's profile than an entire head. The ear became puffed up and crispy. Overall, very fatty. with the only piece of meat coming from the cheek. You cut up the pig and make your own spring rolls. They provide rice paper, water, noodles, lettuce, basil, fish sauce, pickled onions. and cilantro. Glad I could try pig's head, but still would not recommend. Way too fatty for my liking.The best parts were the eye and the ear. I think I made the white girl at the table next to me sick while I was digging out the eye and ripping off the ear. I wouldn't say it's worth the $40 price tag, but it was an experience.This place is on the expensive side for Asian food, so not sure if I would come back again. Their lunch menu does seem interesting, and it might be worth it to make another trip just for the quail.",9,6,6,Jocelyn K.,"Jersey City, NJ",479,885,4955

Don't miss this spot if you are a fan of Thai and Vietnamese food + vast selection of beer and wines. Right from the beginning you'd get a complimentary basket full of sticky rice and 2 sauces, smokey spicy eggplant paste and the famous bang-bang sauce. The paste was delicious and spicy but not nearly as spicy as the bangbang sauce, which is uniquely salty and spicy and very addicting.Must get:- The Crunchy Coconut Rice (4 rice balls) $10: served with buttery iceberg lattuce and thin sausages. Hands down one of the best dishes I have ever had. So good I can order 2 or 3 of this for myself! - Laos Dark Beer $7: It has a mildly rich and soft taste to it, kind of soothing. I don't enjoy beer and I still think this is pretty good. - Brussel Sprout Leaves $10: I just don't understand how they make Brussel sprouts to taste sooo darrrnnn good?! The dish came out and it looked like a small dish with a pile of black flaky stuff. It turned out that instead of cooking the Brussel spouts whole like miniature green ball, each leaf was satay separately and coated with delicious sweet and salty flavor. You have to try it yourself! I believe this one was not on the regular menu - make sure to ask your waiter about it even if it was not mentioned. First Timer Must-get:- The Pig face $39: Where else but khe-yo can you find roasted pig face? I was taken back by it and its name (cruel you may say) but if we are eating pork anyways left and right (hello ... bacon) so why can't we also eat the other parts of the pig too? Don't waste food right? The face was big though not big enough to feed 4 hungry people, it was still a nice decent size dish at $40. You get the pig face, mixed greens,  mint leaves, and fried vermicelli noodles to make wraps. Dip the harden soy paper in the hot water container that was prepared for us for 8 seconds the paper softens to a clear rice noodle texture which you wrap the ingredients however with whatever you like even the bangbang sauce + rice! It was a fun DIY dish I must say!Good but not too special:- Berkshire Spare Ribs $24: Nothing special, it was good but I feel like you can get this else where easily at other Asian restaurants. The ribs were tender but too salty in my opinion. - Pork Curry Noodles $24:  A very very very mild milky curry noodle. It was also not particularly hot enough when it was brought out to the table. The flavor was lacking among other palette-kicking dished at the table.  - Bread pudding with ice cream $10: nice portion - good for sharing between 2 or 3 people.

Smashed Green Papaya Salad Green Market Cabbage & Pumpkin Seeds - tasted like your typical papaya salad from a Thai joint.  Bamboo Grilled Ginger Quail Bang-Bang & Gai-Lan  - tasty, but the spare ribs were definitely more savory and a better protein option.Special - Fish jerky - The plating was very pretty, but I think I'll stick with the bon chon in Ktown.Special - Brussel Sprout leaves - AWESOMENESS - YOU MUST GET THISWhole Caramelized Sea Bream Tamarind-Peanut Sauce & Crispy Shallots  - by far the best dish.  Savory, crispy on the surface and juicy inside.  The combo of sweet and tanginess....Wok-Fried Glass Noodles  Snow Peas & Sugar Snaps  - yummy! Pork Curry Noodles Pickled Chili & Banana Flower  -    Kind of underwhelming... might be due to it being luke warm...Chili Prawns Ginger Scallion Toast & Thai Basil - Prawns cooked perfectly with that juicy snap and the broth contained some intense shrimpy flavor.    Was not a fan of the toast though, may have ordered this with the idea that is was going to be similar to how shrimp toast is prepared Cantonese style.  Try to sop up all the shrimp broth goodness.Banana Wrapped Red Snapper Crispy Artichokes & Bang Bang - Compared to the other dish, this one was the most delicate in flavor.  Berkshire Spare Ribs  Smashed Long Bean & Cherry Tomato -   Oh so savory and fall off the bone tender.  Special - Braised duck - Might have been over braised?

4.0,11/8/2014,"This place is great. The service is friendly and attentive, and the food is flavorful and beautifully displayed. I've enjoyed both brunch and dinner here. For brunch, you can choose one of several proteins over salad or rice or noodles. The pork belly over romaine leaves with a wide range of colorful vegetables was great. The eggs with sticky rice, an eggplant purée, pickles, and a very spicy chili sauce was great, but felt to me like several different dishes that didn't necessarily blend together. For dinner, the crispy coconut rice cakes are delicious, with a variety of textures. The complimentary sticky rice served with eggplant and chili is fun to eat and tasty. The brussel sprouts lightly fried with a pungent fish sauce is good but a little pungent. The fish steamed in banana leaf is a nice change from all the other strong flavors.

I am gluten intolerant and they had plenty of options for me as well as being well-educated on what is available for gluten free individuals on their menu.And not to be overlooked - the best starter anywhere - sticky rice with the most bangin'  hot sauce (bangin' delicious and bagin' spicy out of control).

5.0,10/16/2014,"Khe-Yo is a total knock your socks off situation. It's no coincidence their name sounds like KO. This is easily one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I normally don't go to a restaurant more than once (there are so many restaurants in NY to try!) but Khe-Yo is an exception.  It's the perfect restaurant to bring a date - mood lighting, nice but not overly schmancy and most importantly, they have fun with their food. Every dish I had was like pop rocks in your mouth - tingly, explosive and so much fun.  Things you must order:1. Crunchy Coconut Rice - a perfect play in flavors and textures. Ahhhhh, I'm drooling just thinking about it!2. Chili Prawns - my favorite part is that it comes with thick toast for you to mop up every last drop of that delicious sauce. Don't be put off by the name, this dish is flavorful, not spicy. 3. Pig's face (special of the day) - they brought out an entire pig's face (yes, snout and ears included!) for you to make your own summer rolls. You first dip the dried rice paper in a bath of hot water to soften it, chop up some of the pig's face, add vermicelli, cucumbers, mint and voila - yum yum in your tum tum.4. Roasted Brussels Sprouts (special of the day) - I never, ever rave about vegetables, but this! THIS. Was. Heavenly. The baby Brussels sprouts were perfectly roasted (lightly crisp but not dehydrated), mixed in with small chunks of pork belly and dressed with the most amazing sauce. The sauce really was what dragged this dish into out-of-this-world territory for me.I also tried the Berkshire Spare Ribs and it was good, but not half as exciting as everything else.The only qualm I have about this place?

4.0,9/22/2014,"This was my first foray into Laotian cuisine and it did not disappoint. Khe-yo is a trendy restaurant with a limited menu in an expensive area, but everything is extremely flavorful (and on the spicy side). It was easy to make an appointment through OpenTable, so my boyfriend and I popped in on a Friday night to a packed restaurant.The menu is divided into appetizers, small plates, and large plates. We had one appetizer, one small plate, and one large plate. Along with the complimentary sticky rice rice and bang bang sauce, this was just enough food for two hungry people. I recommend ordering a few things and sharing instead of getting your own dish, because that's boring.  We ate:Spicy duck & watercress salad ($16)Crunchy coconut rice with spicy sausage ($12)Spare ribs ($24)The spicy duck salad had duck tongues, which were interesting, but way too salty for my taste. I would pass on this next time. The crunchy coconut rice is one of their most popular dishes for a reason - it's a good amount of food and TONS of flavor, plus the sausage gives it another dimension. The spare ribs were awesome, huge, and slightly sweet, though I could do without the sides of green beans and cherry tomatoes. I could barely finish my half. -1 star for very average service and an extremely limited dessert menu (as in, they only had 1 item), but it's still a solid restaurant, and I'm sure I'll be back!",2,0,0,Valerie L.,"San Francisco, CA",245,652,2

Everything was a bit on the saltier side (except the rice of course). Beware of the bang and sauce!! We all like spicy and it was really strong and intense. Numbing spiciness.

5.0,9/12/2014,"What a great experience! Go!I was meeting my girlfriend in Tribeca for a Thursday date night, and on the advice of my fellow Yelpers, figured we had to give Khe-Yo a try.  Neither of us had been to a Laotian restaurant before, although we eat lots of Vietnamese and Thai.  All I can say is ""Thank You Friends"".  I'm probably just going to rehash what everyone else is saying, but the atmosphere, staff, and food all make this place worth trying.  The food is messy, and they encourage you to use you fingers, which is always fun, but everything was super tasty.They start with a complimentary sticky rice with two dipping sauces, bang bang which is super spicy but absolutely delicious, and an eggplant puree which compliments the spicy sauce well.  You are supposed to grab little bits of rice with your fingers, roll it into a ball, and dip it in the sauces.  Fun and tasty.We tried the Crispy Coconut Rice (seems like a staple).  It had a crispy crust, tasty tang from lime leaves and spices, and a sweet sauce.  To channel my inner Top Chef Judge, it had the perfect balance of flavors and both crispy and creamy textures to delight the senses.We also got the Blue Crab appetizer special.  Sweet and Delicious crab in a slightly spicy, creamy, herbaceous sauce.  For entrees we got the whole grilled Black Bass and Chili Prawns.  The prawns were enormous, and tasted like small lobsters.  SO GOOD!  The bass was nicely flavored and perfectly cooked, and had amazing little fried shoestring shallots.Most of the dishes were a bit on the spicy side, so if you don't like spice at all, this might not be a great experience for you, but the dimensions of flavor they achieve with herbs and nuts compliments the spiciness well and makes it all perfectly balanced.  Price-wise, it really isn't that bad considering the neighborhood and the quality of food.  I will be back.",3,1,2,Greg C.,"South Orange, NJ",632,365,698

The family style plate sharing and the way you're encouraged to eat with your hands creates a fun experience that makes you feel closer to your food and everyone else at the table.  We started with the Cucumber and Thai chili vodka and the Ginger Sparkling Wine and Tamarind cocktails. Both were excellent. I thought the Cucumber cocktail was just perfectly balanced. It couldn't have been any better!    Starting the meal you are treated to Sticky Rice that comes with Roasted Eggplant and Bang-Bang Sauce. WoW! Both were Fantastic! The Bang Bang sauce was spicy but yet bursting with many layers of flavor. I wish I had it right now!  For dinner we ordered the Kona Kampachi, Lobster Spring Rolls, Crunchy Coconut Rice, Crab with Caramelized Onions and Black Bean appetizers.  For entrees the Whole Black Bass and Berkshire Spare Ribs.   Every dish was beautiful and delicious!  One appetizer was better than the next and after the Amazing Crunchy Coconut Rice I was in the zone. Hell after the Sticky Rice I was in the zone!   As I was eating the Crab special I happened to look at the people who sat across from us who were looking at me with a funny expression then I realized that for the last 5 minutes I had my face and hands buried in that bowl eating crabs like a savage. That bowl had blocked out the entire world around me and I forgot that I was sitting in the middle of a crowded restaurant.  I'll tell you one thing though 10 minutes later they had a bowl of crabs on their table too!  The Ribs and smashed Long Beans was great and I just cannot stop thinking about the Black Bass. I would eat this entire meal again right now. I would eat it for breakfast and I would pick this as my last meal on this earth.   I would be remiss if I didn't mention the fact that the service was equally as impressive!

5.0,8/26/2014,"Come to Khe-yo for an amazing and unique meal that you can taste on your tongue even hours afterward (in a good way!). I dined here last week and am still thinking about the meal I had. In place of bread you might get at other restaurants, they give you sticky rice with a nice eggplant puree and their super spicy ""bang bang"" sauce to dip the sticky rice into. Eat this with your hands! And go easy on the bang bang sauce - they aren't lying when they tell you how spicy it is! For starters we had the crunchy coconut rice and the bamboo grilled ginger quail, both of which were outstanding. The crunchy coconut rice came as 4 crunchy little rice balls topped with a nice thick slice of Chinese sausage and a wedge of iceberg lettuce on the side. It looked so pretty I was sad for a second when the waiter started crunching up the balls but he told us that the more you mix it, the better the flavors meld together. He was right - I loved the nice touch of fried kaffir lime leaves in there too for some additional texture, and scooping this mixture into the cool iceberg lettuce with some bang bang sauce on top helped round the dish out. What complex citrusy and savory flavors! I'd go back just for this dish. The quail was also super tender and had a really tasty glaze.For the mains, we shared the pork curry noodles and Berskhire spare ribs. I wasn't totally blown away by the spare ribs but maybe that's because I ate the pork curry noodles first and that was mind blowing! The curry noodles was a soup with a thick and flavorful curry broth, and they gave you a side of fresh Thai basil, green beans, shaved cabbage, and bean sprouts for a bit of freshness. You could tell the noodles were hand made with care, and they were so delicious alongside tender little chunks of pork. I want to clarify that the spare ribs weren't bad by any means - they did have a nice flavorful glaze on them - but they were not as tender as they could have been and were nothing in comparison to the pork curry noodles in my opinion.

4.0,6/15/2014,"After this meal, I am almost convinced anything pork is delicious - even a pig face. Yes. I said pig's face. More on that a little later.I almost never go down to TriBeCa, but I may just start frequenting the neighborhood more often now that I've discovered Khe-Yo. If you like savory, flavorful and spicy eats, then this restaurant is a must. After a 45 minute wait at the bar (and a few cocktails in), my pals and I went to town on the menu. The menu is family style, so our party of four ordered 4 starters and 4 mains. We started with the steak tartare, crunchy coconut rice, grilled sausage and the papaya salad. The tartare was mixed with bone marrow and embedded back into the bone. Um, sidenote: whoever decided to combine the two is a genius. A normal person could've ended the meal right there and would have been content. Fortunately for me, my friends and I gorge until we drop. Diet starts tomorrow, amirite? Anyway, halfway through the meal I'm pretty sure I fell into some kind of fugue state (RIP Walter White). I remember eating some spare ribs, a little of the curry and glass noodles and then making a spring roll of pig ear and cheek. They need to seriously make this a permanent entree on the menu, because it's THAT good. I'm going to need another order of pig face next time I come, Khe-Yo staff. Sounds crazy, but it tastes amazing. Crackling, crunchy, fatty pork skin is the way to go. It also makes for a great Instagram photo opp. The drinks were good and the food portions were generous. Their booth seating is also great for taking naps on in between pork face and spare ribs. I mean, not like I did that or anything. Khe-Yo, I'll be back!",1,1,1,Nancy D.,"New York, NY",321,343,75

4.0,5/10/2014,"This place gets pretty crowded.  If you have a reservation, expect to be seated about 10-20 minutes after arrival.  There's a bar in the front with some interesting cocktails on the menu.  I wouldn't consider Khe-Yo truly a Laotian restaurant.  It's more Laos-inspired and reformatted to fit the typical New American meal structure, and it's done well.  The first sign of that is the sticky rice you get as a starter instead of bread, which is cute.  What's also cute is there's a sign in the restaurant that says ""sticky rice tastes better when you eat it with your hands,"" and the waitress repeated that also.  Well, I conducted  a scientific experiment in the restaurant, and that claim proved to be false.  It tastes just as good eaten with a fork.  There's probably some justification for this in Laos, where they eat  sticky rice along with their main meals in a family-style setting, so their fingers would be covered with sauces from other dishes to flavor the rice.  Anyway, the sticky rice comes with a small dish of an eggplant sauce, and some spicy ""bang bang"" sauce.  Mix them together if you can handle the heat.  Steak Tartare Salad with bone marrow was ordered as our appetizer.  A more apt name for this dish would be ""Steak Tartare on Bone Marrow.""  There were very few veggies at all, and this dish was misplaced in the salad section of the menu.  Not that I'm complaining, it was delicious.  The meat melted in your mouth, and the bone marrow just made it decadent.  There were some cerviche'ish onions and veggies on top that complimented the meat well.  Chili Prawns was my entree.  It came in a bowl with a broth that reminiscent of a red curry dish from a Thai restaurant that was very good, and a little bit spicy.  The prawns were a little soggy, which is not unusual since they were cooked in soup instead of being steamed separately. There were also pieces of toast topped with ginger and scallion, which tasted good soaked with the broth.  HOWEVER,  the soup tasted even better on some of the sticky rice we had left over...The Grilled Red Snapper was ordered by my friend, and I had a little bit of it.  The fish was cooked well, and had a good texture to it.  This dish does have bang bang sauce on it, so be careful if you can't handle spicy stuff.  The restaurant was great, and I would definitely come here again.  The Berkshire Spare Ribs seemed like a popular dish there, as I saw a lot of other tables ordering it.  Maybe next time, I would definitely come here again.",1,2,0,Dennis L.,"New York, NY",76,196,1

We ordered the sausage appetizer with sweet peanut sauce. It was delicious. We ordered two entrees. First was the spare ribs which were very basic and kinda chewy. Good marinade though. The pork curry was great. The curry itself was the best part and it came with veggies on the side to add to the meal. They have a full bar. I ordered an $8 cider which was good but I've had better for half the price. The style of the restaurant is very trendy and the furniture has a Frank Lloyd Wright vibe. Very beautiful.

When I found myself here for lunch, I was pleasantly surprised (thanks Mark!). The lunch menu is much simpler, just two food items: grilled shrimp banh-mi and pork belly banh-mi. And why complicate things with too many options when you do two dishes very, very well? Before we get to the delicious food, let's get the other critical elements out of the way: service was great. Marissa was friendly and made me feel welcomed from the moment I stepped in the door. The place is far from pretentious during the day. We went for an early lunch, so the place was empty and we were able to score a table in the little nook by the window, with fluffy colorful pillows not dissimilar to those you'd find at a therapist office (all shrinks have colorful pillows, I swear) and plenty of natural light. Although, I should warn that this seems to be the only window in the restaurant. If you're lucky enough to get the table in the nook, it would be the perfect setup for an afternoon cat party, lazily lounging in the sun with delicious food. The pork belly banh-mi is really good. I had my doubts: paying $11 for a sandwich seems steep, even in NY, but Khe-Yo really delivered on the sandwich. If Ippudo's pork buns (on their best day) mate with the best banh-mi you can imagine, the result would be Khe-Yo's pork belly banh-mi. The baguette is warm, soft and chewy. It's stuffed with two kinds of pork: ground pork marinated in something amazing and melt-in-your-mouth fatty pork belly goodness. They also have a dipping sauce (like French dip au jus), but really there's no need for it.So good. SO GOOD. Just so damn good. I'll be back for lunch.",0,0,0,Vania K.,"Seattle, WA",613,587,372

I'm just going to get down to business describing the deliciousness:THE PIG HEAD - This is Khe-Yo's specialty and if you don't get it, you're actually missing out on the best pork life has to offer.  That's a pretty bold claim, but AM I BLINKING?! FUCK NO. This is half a pig's head, deep fried, alongside some herby/curried vermicelli noodles, mushrooms, and a pot of ginger peanut dipping sauce. There's a separate apparatus on the side where you can soak and then load up clear rice paper wraps with pork, noodle, mushroom, and some mint or cilantro also served on the main. The result is actually orgasmic. You'll eat too much and you won't care. AN IMPORTANT WORD OF ADVICE: BE AGGRESSIVE AND CREATIVE WHILE CUTTING THE PIG HEAD. THere's so much meat on that thing outside of the obvious areas like the cheek. Look under the jaw for some heartbreakingly dark chunks and under the jawbone for some marbled-looking pieces. Mint salad appetizer (with shrimp chips) - excellent, appallingly flavorful, a great starter to get your palate hella stimulated before your mains. I have to say, this dish represents the epitome of what Khe-Yo does well: pack complex spice and flavor into even the most simple, basic dishes. Soft-shelled shrimp appetizer - also delicious.I think I've said enough. This is a very special place. Go with a big group, try as much of the menu as possible.

Probably good for two to four people. Probably not first date, but would be a cool second date.FOOD: Exciting and fun and delicious. Strong flavors in every dish. They bring you sticky rice to start - it's like their version of bread - with a spicy sauce and an eggplant mush. The eggplant is so tasty and you can put it on everything. We got the roasted squash - which was my favorite. Squash with mint and mushrooms and something spicy, so my mouth was on fire. But I kept going back for more. The sausage with peanut sauce. We determined it was best wrapped in the lettuce leaf (korean bbq style) and with a bit of sticky rice. The crunchy coconut rice was good, although just a lot of rice. I liked the crunch but felt it needed something a bit more. The beef jerky was also tasty and came with a chili paste, but it's a dish I could pass on next time. The special they had was pig's face - and it was amazing. So tender and fatty. You wrap it in rice paper with greens and bean sprouts to lighten it up a little.ENVIRONMENT: The place is dark - dark walls, dark furniture, not a lot of lighting. Bar in front, tables in back. It's pretty tight seating - on the Saturday night we went, it was packed. The music was pretty loud given that it was more restaurant than bar.SERVICE: I liked our waiter. He was friendly and attentive. Gave us recommendations when we were choosing dishes. The staff was really good at clearing dishes and refilling water as well.

5.0,3/2/2014,"I don't even know where to begin. Let's start with the decor. Loved the style of the restaurant and while the tables were somewhat close together - it's the city so it didn't bother me. Great lighting and music. Ok now on to service.  Amazing and attentive wait staff from pouring drinks to clean up. Our waiter was incredibly knowledgeable and when we said we hadn't eaten at the restaurant before told us how to prepare each dish as it came out (wrap in lettuce, dip in here etc). Now the real star of the evening. The food. As others have noted they bring out sticky rice which you roll into a ball and dip into the bang bang sauce and top with the eggplant. Wow. Great heat level - found myself addicted within seconds. Lol. We then started with the sausage and coconut rice appetizers. Both were excellent. Loved the crunch on the rice and the sausage wrapped in the lettuce with the peanut sauce. Next were the main courses - went with the pig head special and the whole bass. Both were executed perfectly and while way too much food for two we found ourselves cleaning the plates!  The heat cut through the richness of the pork and the skin, omg the crispy skin. My mouth is watering!  The bass was also incredibly good with a nice fish sauce lime flavor. All in all this was one of the best meals I've had in recent memory.

We had the crunchy coconut rice and steak tartar, as well as the prawns, and short rib (special).  Don't order the crunchy coconut rice when you come with parents or older adults, I don't think it will be particularly enjoyable for them to eat something crunchy that is not a nut.  The steak tartar was fantastic with marrow, it was rich but well balanced.  We enjoyed the prawns and short ribs and they were nicely seasoned and filling.  If you've never had this kind of flavor before and you liked it, I recommend you venture further into trying authentic Thai food.",0,0,0,Jenny L.,"Queens, NY",95,191,288

5.0,2/18/2014,"Two Words: Laotian CuisineOwned by Iron Chef Marc Forgione and Laos-born but USA raised Executive Chef Phet Schwader, Khe-Yo (meaning ""GREEN"") is the first and ONLY Laotian restaurant in the entire NYC metropolitan area and I've been dying to try this place out ever since it opened up last year but never really found the right time to do so. Finally made it out here last night for dinner with two of my closest friends and had a SUPERB ""mini gastronomical"" trip to the mysterious and widely unfamiliar country of Lao.I was able to secure a reservation for 7:30PM on a Monday night. When we arrived, my friends have already arrived and were sitting in the main dining area. However, I noticed that the table right next to the entrance near the window with cushions was open and we asked the HOST or I think he was one of the owners if we were able to sit there instead and surprisingly unpretentious, he told us that it's ""OPEN and All ours"" which was awesome and made us feel VERY welcome at this restaurant. The decor of the restaurant is chic, sexy, and trendy yet cozy and warm with dim lights and a wheel-of-bulbs chandelier hung from the center of the main dining area's ceiling which gave off a soft glow that revealed an elephant sketched on one wall and the colorful dishes and food. There is also a small bar area near the entrance. It wasn't too crowded and loud when we arrived which was good. As soon as we settled down, our waitress arrived, served us water, and explained us to specials for tonight. She was very friendly and attentive. If I can recall correctly, the specials for the night were Duck Salad and Pig's Head. We opted for the Pig's Head as I heard it's only available on certain nights and not on the menu. We also ordered two appetizers to share: Ping Sai Ua Moo and the Nam-Khao. Shortly after we ordered our meal, a baskey of Laotian Sticky Rice arrived with two different sauces. One of them was the infamous ""Bang Bang"" sauce, which puckered our mouths with lime, fish sauce, and assaulted our lips and sinuses with Chile. We loved this sauce!! It was so savory, slightly sweet, spicy just like how we as spicy food lovers want it to be. The other sauce or ""Mash"" consisted of Sweet and Smoky Eggplant which was good stuff as well.  The Sticky Rice did not disappoint. It was served warm in a straw basket, semi dry and gently glutinous with the right amount of tanginess. [HINT: You can ask for more without extra charge, in fact this is their version of BREAD AND BUTTER]As we were enjoying the sticky rice, our two appetizers arrived:Ping-Sai-Ua-Moo or Grilled Laos Style Sausage served with Lettuce, Star Fruit, and Sweet Peanut Sauce. The sausages were sweet and delicious! The Peanut Sauce looked like Korean Ssamjang in appearance but they were sweet and definitely peanut-buttery but definitely NOT in a SKIPPY, JIF or Planters kind of way.Nam-Khao is a Crunchy Coconut Rice dish served with Spicy Kaffir Lime Sausage & Baby Iceberg Wraps. Our server explained to us that we should mas the rice with the sausage and eat them wrapped around the Iceberg lettuce. The dish itself  had a variety of balanced flavors from sweet, spicy, sour, and salty. Not to mention crunchy, soft, and meaty.  YUMAs we were near finishing up with our appetizers, the main dish ""Pig's Head"" arrived. The dish was served with a side of noodles and some greens which I cannot recall what they were but went well with the Pig's head. The portion is great to share for a party of up to 4 people. Not too big nor not too small. The meat is crispy on the outer layer which reminded me of Chicharron or the Filipino Lechon Kawali. The insides were tender, flavorful, moisty, and fatty. Simply delicious. A downside might be that there is a charge for extra lettuce or greens. We were previously told by the server that it was $3 so we declined (afterall, we're not in a Korean restaurant with unlimited sides and greens) but then the busboy brought  out a side of lettuce and told us that it was $1. Strange but didn't ruin our dining experience, just something to keep in mind.Throughout our meal, water was constantly refilled by bus boys and waitress came back to check up on us several times. Our attentive and friendly bus boy even took us our pictures with the pig's head! :P Dessert-wise Khe-Yo is a bit weak as the selections aren't ""Laotian"" but you know with Asian cuisines, desserts are not really the norm but that doesn't mean the restaurant itself does not deserve 5 stars from me. Prices are slightly high but won't break your bank (around $12-21 for salads and appetizers and $20-40 for entrees) Total for $3 came out to less than $70 and we left full (not like buffet-full but feel-good full) and satisfied. It's a perfect place to share small plates and a main entree like the Pig's head family-style with a group of close friends in a chic yet cozy neighborhood spot!Will return in the future to try their ""entrees"" and drinks!!",5,0,0,Old Fart M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1148,11072

I LOVE it when asian restaurants give you complimentary rice! It feels so miserly when they don't.The two of us ordered:- crunchy coconut rice. They reminded me of arancini balls. Deep fried and very flavorful. Accompanied by slices of fried, sweet sausage-ginger quail. A whole quail, which appeared to have been rotisseried/grilled on bamboo sticks to perfection - very juicy and flavorful- the evening special of a whole pig face! That's right. FACE. The skin was super crispy and the meat had obviously been braised for hours.

Actually I feel like a lof the food comes with lettuce/sauce to wrap with. Everything was great but our least favorite was the bass. It was a little dry and I just didn't think it was worth it being the most highly priced item on the menu. My overall favorite was the prawns and the curry noodles. We all enjoyed the complimentary sticky rice and bang bang sauce which also comes with a eggplant paste. I feel like all the flavors are so intense so salt intake is a bit crazy. I drank 4 cups of water during dinner and a few more after dinner. Also, the runner accidently spilled a whole glass of water on my friend's lap and it got on her phone as well and though they offered to dry clean, I think a dessert on the house or maybe a few drinks would have helped.

4.0,1/21/2014,"More like a 3.5, but OK, I'll round it up because of their darn comp sticky rice with bangbang sauce. I came here for my annual birthday dinner with my best friend. We take this day very seriously because it's in celebration of both our birthdays (5 days apart! ;D), so we always end up scalping for a new restaurant to try weeks and weeks in advance. I forever wanted d to try Khe-yo after seeing it on Thrillist, and she happily agreed to try it out as well. Well, 10 seconds after walking into Khe-yo, we almost wanted to leave. What prevented us from leaving was because we didn't want to ruin our annual dinner, and because it was snowing out. The hostess is a B*TCH! She's a brunette, tall, (OK this is rude) fat, and pale with vampire red lips. She was so rude to us, and had a really angry face on from checking us in, to checking our coats. Even the way she seated us was ridiculous. She literally walked us NEAR our table, pointed at it, and walked away. Wow. Hence why I was debating on 3.5 stars being a 3 or 4. She was the sole reason. I hope Khe-Yo reads this honestly.Onto the food, oh my god! Everything was way overpriced, but we expected that from asian fusion cuisine already. Laotian food is very similar to the spices used in viet and thai dishes, so we were very happy about that. Everything we ordered off the menu were delicious, and yes, the comp sticky rice was awesome! We even asked for another serving! Their shrimp with toast was incredibly tasty, but I must say, that toast soaked in the broth was the highlight of the night. It was divineeeee. We also ordered the curry pork noodles, seabass, and ribs - all which were good. We did order their scallop? dish as an appetizer, and it was not memorable. We forgot we even had that by the time we finished our meal. For dessert, we ended up ordering something along the line of coconut flan? - well, that was also a very pleasant surprise because we dogged it in less than 30 secs probably haha.Once again, nothing wrong with Khe-Yo aside from their food being a tad on the salty side, and the horrible hostess.

The cuisine might be unfamiliar but the ambiance certainly isn't; the restaurant falls in line with the typical trendy Tribeca decor, and betrays little of its Asian influences.The complimentary sticky rice did not disappoint, although I will say that fellow Yelpers did not warn me of the HEAT. Am I a complete wuss, or is every other patron just immune to how crazy spicy that bang-bang sauce is? I was thankful the ""Flip"" cocktail I ordered tasted basically like a milkshake; I needed it.We also ordered the Crunchy Coconut Rice to start, which in retrospect was way too much rice. I can't recommend this appetizer - an order of four rice balls are deep fried like croquettes and topped with sausage, and I couldn't discern any coconut flavor.For the mains I ordered the Chili Prawns. The flavors here were actually complex and spicy, and I loved the thick Texas toast that the shrimp came resting on. Unfortunately the dish is EXTREMELY messy, and I may have just resorted to using my hands (oh you know, viciously ripping off shrimp heads while chili sauce drips down my arm). Super sexy, my dinner date was sure to be impressed.Overall I was disappointed by Khe-Yo, since the restaurant has earned such rave reviews. It's definitely overpriced for the food you get, as the portions here are pretty small. None of the flavors struck me as THAT ethnically eye-opening.

I really enjoyed the flavor of the ginger quail. I thought the chili prawns were the weakest part of the night.

Moreover, I'm not the type of person to douse every meal in Sriracha, so the sticky rice was a much-appreciated antidote for the spicier moments of the evening. Overall, Khe-Yo was amazing, and I highly recommend it to NY natives and visitors alike.",0,0,0,Gwen H.,"Washington, DC",0,12,0

5.0,12/24/2013,"Where to start: We began with the Crunchy Coconut Rice withspicy kaffir lime sausage, Sesame Beef Jerky (must order), Bay Scallops, Steak Tartare with roasted bone marrow. The beef jerky was to die for, as was the steak tartare. We really enjoyed the other appetizers, but if you can only choose 2 I would recommend the beef jerky and steak tartare/bone marrow. The waiter was very knowledgeable about what wines paired best with the food we ordered (We went with the 97' Riesling).On to the main entrees. We decided to share a few entrees which turned out to be a great way to go. We ordered the Chili Prawns (awesome), Whole Grilled Black Bass (fantastic), and the Braised Pork Belly (melted in my mouth). I guess we ordered a lot of food because even though they looked incredible, I couldn't force myself to eat any of the Berkshire Spare Ribs. From the speed in which the rest of the table inhaled the ribs, I can only assume I missed out on another great dish. This was my 1st time at the restaurant, and I can honestly say that I was very impressed by both the trendy atmosphere (packed on a rainy Monday night), and how clean and assertive the flavors were.Can't wait to go back again and try the few dishes that didn't make the 1st go around. Great service and great food. Just a quick warning for those who don't like spicy...

4.0,12/20/2013,"Ah, Khe-Yo. Firsting Laotian.  It's sort of just southeast Asian food.  Black spicy, shrimp paste, spicy spicy hot sauce (well oil and vinegar more like it), lots of kaffir leaves and ginger? Yep Southeast Asian, all right.  Take it a step further and eat with your hands (they recommend it, they don't give you a knife or spoon...only a fork if you must) and you'll be JUST like the locals.Came here on a happening Thursday (it's Tribecca) with bf and another couple.  Decor is teak wood-y, dim and simple, and the restaurant was actually cozy.  There were a decent amount of tables, but, the it wasn't grandiose like many other restos in the area (I mean Bouley is next door). Our reservation was at 8:15 and we had to wait a bit before sitting.  All in all. our service was decent..our waitress was sweet but she tended to forget a thing or two.  Fortunately, our waters were refilled on time.  What really lacked was explaining the dishes..plating and presentation were fine, but Laotian food is complicated so figuring out how to eat it all is a big feat (yes, even for me, the Chinese-Burmese girl)Onto the food. I have never been to Laos but I don't doubt the authenticity of this food.   We had three small plates, and 3 entrees.  The total was $180 for four (including 2 glasses of wine).  The waitress did a good job of explaining HOW to eat the dishes and let me tell you, they were rather complicated.  Here's what we ordered:1. Complimentary Sticky Rice- this you must eat with your hands (it tastes better). Don't worry, they offer you hot towels before and after dinner to rinse (though, wash those hands!). Comes with two dipping sauces- really hot, hot chili sauce..which was hot chili fish sauce, and oil, and a pickled eggplant paste.  Refills anytime.2. The famous crispy rice- sort of like a faint coconut coating of ""friedness"" on the outside, packed with spicy, oily rice balls on the inside. BF compared it to kimchi fried rice but it wasn't picked at all. 4 balls per order. Comes with a side of sausage that was pretty decent, sort of like a Chinese sweet sausage, but not as sticky, sweet or hard. 3. The sesame beef jerky- I didn't try this, as I don't eat beef but I was told it was like a marinated teriyaki beef, not really dried ""jerky"" per se.  Was a little small for $13. Fresh radishes came with it, alongside,  really good black paste (sweet first, then hot). 4. The Kabocha Squash salad- probably my favorite dish of the night; very clean, sweet, complex salad.  The squash was similar to butternut, and was cold but it came with really tasty croutons (oily, yet bread-y at the same time), and a lot of really fresh greens. 5. The Spare Ribs- Grilled, blackened pork to perfection, tender, sweet-chili style glazed on the bone.  Definitely had good fat content. I had a small small bite as I don't really eat pork but this seemed to be the favorite among the table. 6. The Pork Belly- stewed, super tender, in chunks that were not overly fatty along with a palette cleanser (basically radish in water), boiled quail egg (eh) and some turnips.  I think I prefer the belly to crispy (it's the few times I eat pork), via being seared, and so, I just think this preparation wasn't my preference. 7. The Black Bass- the grand finale, ""MP"" (it's $34-47), a while grilled fish that has been prepared with ginger (INSIDE of it), along with kaffir lime leaves, basil, crunchy shallots, beans sprouts, and a really decadent/thick peanut sauce (yes I know it doesn't look appetizer- that's SE Asian food for you...brown!)  It comes with big lettuce wraps, deboned, and beautifully presented and along, free of utensils.  This was probably one of the most complicated dishes to eat: you had to wrap all the ingredients up in a lettuce wrap, sort of like Korean BBQ. We skipped deserts and others after-dinner drinks, though the waitress recommended the Lao Lao cocktail.  They only have one desert, this coconut sweet sticky rice which we all passed up.Everything was just pickled, and sweet chilled as you would expect.  Thatta Laotian!  Go!",4,1,3,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",878,1242,25

Poke, poke, I went, using touch response to the knife rather than sight, really, that's how dark it was. Disappointingly, the food was not really that tasty either. The beef jerky was kinda sad. More chew than flavor, which is what I tend to associate with western, not well-made eastern, jerky. The sticky rice was okay, not really impressive. You should try the browned sticy rice fragranced with coconut at Somtum Der instead. Now that is special. The much-reviewed Bang Bang sauce here, well, if you eat spicy, and fish sauce, at all, it's just not that unique.

The sticky rice that came to the table was tasty and unique, and came with the famous bang bang (spicy) sauce and eggplant that were both delicious. We got all the appetizers: my more favorite ones were the crunchy coconut rice and the quail, and was overall pretty good, while the duck salad was also quite good. The jerky was also not too tough, which was pleasant. We also had a steak and bone marrow special, which was really good. The entrees we tried were mixed, though--the spare ribs were tender and well spiced, but I found the sea bass pretty uninspiring.

Yum.*pork belly & shrimp crispy rolls home style: straight up looks and tastes just like a vietnamese crispy spring roll.  Loved it but not different from what mom makes at home.  Lettuce and trimmings and dip also similar.*chili prawns: the prawns and the sauce were very tasty.  head on prawns altho more like large shrimp to me rather than prawns.  Great flavors.*crispy pig face: talked hubby into getting this special since they dont always have it.  This was half a pig face that was fall off the bone tender and juicy and the skin on the outside was super crispy and downright piggy deliciousness.  Be ready to look right into a pig face though, teeth, eye, ear and all.  So good.  Comes with a refreshing salad, nicely balances the super fatty goodness plus there was a steak like mushroom that was grilled to pretty much perfection.  One of our favorites on this dish.  Wish there had been more than one.*rice pudding for dessert: we were seriously stuffed but they were super nice and for hubby'd bday brought out this great ending to our meal.  It was light yet creamy and had green apple chunks that made it not heavy at all.  He totally said he loved it way more than rice to riches.  wwuuuhhh???  ok it was good and it was different...Service is awesome.  Staff is knowledgeable and on top of things so you dont feel like you're sitting there being ignored.  As soon as we're done with a dish, the empty plate gets whisked away so we have our table real estate back.  I'd definitely like to come back.",0,1,0,Caroline V.,"New York, NY",57,507,1081

I was told by the lady who answered the call that for a party of seven, we would need to go with their ""Family Style Menu"", which is fine. And then, she put me on hold to talk to her manager... She came back to say that the only time they can accommodate 7 people is at 5:30pm. I replied that we would all still be at work so that time slot will not work. So I said we would just all be there at 6:30pm, without a reservation. She then said, ""I am sorry, that is the only time that works for us for that amount of people."" What does that mean?So I clarified by saying, ""Do you mean to say if 7 of us are all complete and there at 6:30pm, you would turn us away?""She said yes. They just cannot accommodate that much people at that time. HUH?? What? Even by NYC standards of snobbishness, this is just RIDICULOUS.

It was a good sign when we walked in for our reservation and they sat us immediately despite the hoards of people waiting outside. That's how it should be. We had a corner table which was the best seat in the house (though slightly cramped). Our server Brandon was incredible - so sweet and friendly and took really great care of us all night. He made the experience perfect (cos the food and drinks were fantastic already). Ok so seriously - sticky rice with super spicy nam pla and smoky eggplant dip is probably the best thing a restaurant has ever given me for free. I could have just eaten that alone all night & we all found it hard to resist through the whole meal. We had to get a 2nd basket of the rice. 5 stars!Papaya salad - 3.5 to 4 stars - it was spicy, sweet, sour - flavors were all well-balanced and delicious. The only complaint we had was that the papaya didn't seem like it was shredded fresh. It was soggy like it was shredded much earlier and left to sit. Flavor-wise though, the dish was good.Beef jerky - 4 stars. Sweet and smoky and comes with a chili paste for dipping. Eat this with the papaya salad and sticky rice for a traditional Laotian comboBeef larp on roasted bone marrow - 4 stars- heart attack on a plate but it doesn't taste like it. The sour and spicy larp made it seem light and refreshing. Garlic shrimp with toast - 5 stars - large shrimp with heads served in a rich, flavorful broth. They come with thick fluffy but crunchy toasts (like brick toast) that are so perfect to use for sopping up that delicious broth. Pork and rice noodles - 4 stars. Didn't realize this was a soup, because it just said noodles. I was hoping for a stirfried noodle plate but the soup was really good. It was milder in flavor than the other dishes we ordered which was actually good. The coconut broth was smooth and rich. They present the soup with a bunch of condiments that you're meant to add in as you wish to customize the soup (chilis, lime, herbs).Whole sea bass - 4 stars - the fish was moist, and they debone and open it for you at the table. It comes with a fish sauce sauce that was too sweet. I mistakenly poured it on the fish (which I think you're supposed to do, right?) I had to dip the fish in the spicy nam pla they gave us with the sticky rice. That corrected the sweetness. I had a plum and gin drink that was sweet but not overpowering.

KAY-YO?  CAHAY-YO?  I'm just going to just call it KY.THE UYE consisted for oodles of tasting samples which we indulged one.1) Stick Rice w/Bang Bang sauce - The sauce really was BANG BANG because not only was it the right amount of spiciness, tang, and flavor;  it gave the sticky rice which reminded me of con con (Dominican) but with a slightly softer texture.  Nice solid slim rice pieces.    It also came with this eggplant puree which was smooth but spicy as hell.  DEEELICIOUS.2) Smashed Green Papua Salad - String Cabbage that has a lemony acidity taste.  But despite the sourness it was quite yummy.  Pork Grinds were presented along with this dish which isn't something I'd eat but I know people fiend for this so BON APPETIT.  If you are allergic to nuts, THIS IS NOT THE DISH FOR YOU.  Lots of peanuts.3) Crunchy Coconut Rice - what else do I need to say about this?  The rice had good texture and obviously the crunch was amazing.  I love crunch (not the gym) but the noise and flavors that it emit.  The spicy kaffir sausages and baby iceberg gave the whole overall dish a unique and tasty flavor that you really have to try for yourself.4) Jurgielewicz Duck - the duck was savory and the salad had a strong note of vinegar taste throughout the dish.  And how can I say no to Lemongrass.  I wouldn't eat it but it definitely gives any dish a distinct flavor in a good way.5) Chili Prawns - Ginger scallion toast and Thai basil was very pungent.  The toast was soft yet sturdy (Italian bread).  The shrimp was flavorful, juicy and tender.  6) Pork Belly - The quail eggs was good albeit small.  To be honest I've never had quail eggs before or didn't realize it was quail eggs when I ate it once upon a time.  It was a much creamy yolk which indicated to me of better quality.  Not to be confused with runny.The soup with willow wisp turnip was good but nothing spectacular.The pork belly was fatty but I've never been a fat of pork belly so my opinion on this need not much explain.7) Bells & Evans Grilled Half Chicken - I did not taste any of the ""sweet"" chili honey in this chicken.If it was glazed, then it needed to be EXTRA GLAZED on.   However, the chicken was tender but the grilling was a bit too charcoaled for me.  Kirby Cucumber is not pickle but it'll do.8) Vanilla Rice Pudding  - the combination of honey crisp apple slices, caramel and peanut brittle was a great choice.  This dish needs no words.There are 2 versions of this.  The second version of rice pudding came with fresh strawberries, blueberries and other berries.Stick with the apply version.With all this food you'd think that we'd pay a King's ransom to dine.And you would be right.$540 for a party of 8 = $67.5 + tips = $80Is it worth it?The flavors of the dish yes, the service YES, and the ambiance YES.So folks remember to bring your wallet.Or there is always a need for competent people to wash dishes...",2,2,1,Anderson C.,"Queens, NY",1085,656,867

My only suggestion would be including some summer rice paper to make more substantial roll-ups. For dessert, we got a candied ginger bread cake. It was solid. We shared everything Asian family style.

5.0,10/10/2013,"Came in for dinner tonight with my brother and Husband.  Being Laotian in NYC, we rarely get a taste of home cooked food.I didn't know what to expect because most places in NYC that's Thai and says they serve Laotian dishes too end up being Thai style.  This was different.  When Chef Phet said he was opening up an authentic Laotian restaurant, he wasn't kidding.  His Mom gave it two thumbs up and my Mom would approve too.So usually when you go dine at most places they give you bread and butter.  At Khe-yo he switched it up a little.  You first get served with two sauces and sticky rice.  In Laotian it's called jeow.  One being the egg plant jeow and the other called ""Bang Bang"".  So before I came here, I was wondering what this bang bang sauce was all about.  Now I know why he called it bang bang.  If you translate it directly from Laotian, it's just funny.  But for those of you who are Laotian, it's jeow som.  Not even all Laotians can make good Laotian dishes.  But Chef Phet really hit home with this one.  We had the beef jerky, larb gai, bamboo quail, nam khao, whole grilled black bass, half grilled chicken, grilled ribs with long bean salad and the rice pudding dessert.All was wonderful.  Highly recommend the quail for starters.  So tender and delicious.  The grilled chicken was also so tender.  Can't go wrong with sauce.  If you want a healthy dish, definitely try the whole black bass and don't be afraid to use a little extra sauce on that wrap. Dessert a must try.  It was not heavy and had all the right flavors.All the staffs were super friendly and attentive.  We noticed all the staffs were super informative.  They learned the dishes well and knew all the right answers.  Shout out to our server Tenzing!  Great service, friendly and attentive.  Highly highly recommend.  The bang bang sauce is not hype.  It really is good and so is the eggplant sauce.",1,0,0,Debbie M.,"Long Island City, NY",91,81,32

4.0,9/29/2013,"Fancy Lao Food in NYC?!This is definitely a trendy TriBeCa restaurant: small, dimly-lit, and packed.  My aunt was visiting from Cali so we had to try this place.  Luckily we scored two seats at the bar on a busy Saturday night.  It was hot out.  I was sweating out of my ass onto the bar stools.  Cue the Cucumber Thai-Chili Vodka cocktail.  It was a refreshing kick to the mouth, with the spice and vodka and all.  Auntie had the Hibiscus Mimosa--don't really see how one can go wrong with words like hibiscus, mimosa, and elderflower.Food:Sticky rice with ""bang bang"" sauce (I have never ever heard it called this.  Cute!) and tomato jeo - I love both of these sauces and they tasted exactly how I imagine they should.  We had seconds.  It's weird that the restaurant likens this to bread and butter because Lao people don't just eat sticky rice and sauce, unless you're like, 2 years old.  It's a good concept for people who need something to nibble on.Laap-Pa - Great rendition of one of my favorites.  The presentation wasn't what I was expecting at all, but it was so flavorful and the fish just melted.  I think we were both practically licking the plate with this one.Tam-Mak-Houng - You cannot eat at a Thai or Lao restaurant without having this.  Their version was very good and the presentation with the cabbage and peanuts was lovely.  If I could make one suggestion it would be to add some salted black crabs or, dare I say it, pba-dak.  Yes, I'm dirty like that.  Nam-Khao - Ok, this too is also one of my favorites (are you seeing a pattern here?) and, I hate to say it, but it was just good, not great.  It definitely needed a squeeze of lime and I am just so used to it being made with som moo (fermented sausage with pork skin) that some of its essential flavor was missing.  Also, no dried chili peppers?Pork Belly and Shrimp Crispy rolls - This came out by mistake but we ate it anyway because we are fat and greedy!  It has pork belly and is deep fried.  Need I say more?Tohm-Kem - This dish reminds me so much of my grandma.  The soup had a great depth to it but it was just a *tad* on the salty side if one were to eat it without rice.  I do like that it included quail eggs.  I appreciated the broth for cleansing the palate because after eating this, the ol' palate needed a good cleansing.In conclusion, this restaurant and Chef Phet definitely did not disappoint me with their execution of some of my favorite (they're all my favorite) Lao dishes.  It made me miss my parents just a *little* less.  Then again, I would never bring my parents here.  I would just get a big smack upside the head.  I can see it now.  I mean, did y'all look at the bill?  This place is better suited for a nice date where you want to try something different or, if you're Laotian, for introducing and impressing your friends with flavors from the Motherland.Kup Chai, Khe-yo!",6,5,5,Nisa N.,"Brooklyn, NY",418,241,84

4.0,9/26/2013,"Walking into Khe-Yo, you wouldn't think it was NYC's only Laotian restaurant - with its loud, upbeat music, it feels like a very trendy, hip restaurant. And on a Monday night, it was pretty full (but not completely full, since my friend and I were still able to get a table 15 minutes before our reservation time).Our server was a bit slow with bringing us menus, but from there on the rest of dinner went great. As each dish is served, the server explains it with a set of instructions on how to eat it. The complimentary sticky rice served at the start was no exception - we were told to eat with our hands, and dip the rice in the bang bang spice and eggplant puree. The rice itself wasn't as sticky as I had expected (I'd been expecting something like the Chinese kind that comes wrapped in leaves) but it seemed pretty much like normal rice. The puree was great, but the bang bang sauce was WAY spicier than I anticipated, even though it was good. It tasted like fish sauce with a ton of little peppers thrown in, and it was one of those things you know is too spicy for you to handle, but you just can't stop eating. (Me throughout the night: ""OMG my tongue is on fire."" Friend: ""Why are you still eating that thing?!"")The two of us decided to order two appetizers and an entree to split. Our first appetizer was the crunchy coconut rice, which was my favorite dish of the night. The rice came in four little balls that resembled falafels, and our server recommended that we mash them up to get all the flavors of the other ingredients (we took out the chili peppers on the side though, for fear of death by spiciness). I liked the mix of sweet and savory - the rice was on the sweeter side, and was complemented nicely by the spicy kaffir lime sausage. Our server had also told us to wrap the rice with the pieces of lettuce on the side, which I liked too - it made the dish seem less like carb overload.Our second appetizer was the duck salad. The duck, which was sliced into bite-size pieces, was tender and delicious. I thought some of the greens in the salad were too bitter though.We got the braised pork belly entree, which came with a side of kale and a bowl of soup that our server told us was for cleansing our palate afterwards. I wasn't particularly wowed by this dish, though I was pleasantly surprised to see that the pork belly didn't taste fatty at all. The kale and the soup were both a bit too salty. Overall, I probably wouldn't order this one again.Conclusion: I'm not sure if I'm eager to return right away, but I'd definitely recommend Khe-Yo for adventurous people who like trying new cuisines.",2,0,1,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",423,287,2844

3.0,9/25/2013,"Our dinner experiences weren't like most reviews here. When I dine, I want to enjoy with my full senses. The entire space was dark. One of my friends was over 50 and he used his cellphone to see the menu but he gave up. Most dishes were presented as a set, it is a perfect size for lunch and designed for a person.- Housemade Sauce -Complimentary dipping sauces, home-made Thai Phrik Nam Pla or Vietnamese Nuoc Cham like sauce was fiery good. It worked beautifully over on a even plain rice or any boring flavored meat or fish. Everything taste better with this yummy sauce. If they sell in a jar, I would definitely bought one. There was one more sauce but I don't even remember what and how it was.  - Appetizers -Although our waiter announced the foods were ""family style"" but most dishes came as a set on a tray like Ootoya, with some sides - fresh bean sprouts with cucumber & carrot and tasteless broth (our waiter called it broth but to me, it was a bland soup).Nam-Khao - fried crunchy coconut rice balls were interesting but nothing particularly exciting nor tasty. I read such good reviews that it was very unfortunate. Fluke Laap-Pa - spicy and with bursting of complex flavors, but nothing very special compare to Laab at Kin Shop or Zabb Elee to me. Papaya salad - nothing like Thai version, sweet, sour and spicy. It was limey, period. Porkbelly and Shrimp Crispy Rolls - they were just like Vietnamese Spring Rolls, very crispy and satisfying.  - Entrees -Tohm-Kem pork - delicious! It's a sweet-soy based flavored braised pork and it'a a melts-in-your-mouth good. I make similar to this dish from Okinawa, Rafutei and their porkbelly was equally satisfying. Ping-Pa - grilled bass, was tasty fresh fish and good for one person, suggest no share. - Drink - We also ordered a bottle of Sake from Niigata Prefecture in Japan. Trader Joe-san Jimai Sake taste much better to me, cleaner and crisper. - Conclusion -One of my friends asked to our table ""Would you came back?""

5.0,9/23/2013,"Now I have some pretty high standards when it comes to eating Lao cuisine. My parents were both born and raised in Laos, I was raised my entire life to eat Laotion food. So of course, I come to Khe-Yo with high hopes, but skeptical, that this place would be the real thing.    Yep people, its authentic. This is not Thai food, or a trendy fusion. The Chef did not try to Americanize the dishes to appease the masses. Nope.  It's real Lao cuisine.  My friends and I came here on a busy Friday night and ordered just about every item on the menu. Rather than give a long-winded description of each, I will tell you we did not go wrong with any of the dishes. Group favorites were the beef jerky, spare ribs, papaya salad, coconut rice balls, and black bass. If you love the fuego, you'll love the bang-bang sauce. It was HOT! Just some tips: During the dinner, there were various sauces that accompany your dish.  Try these, as they enhance the flavors of each dish.  Don't be afraid to try different meats with different sauces either. If you find lettuce on a dish, it's there for a reason. Get traditional and wrap your food and veggies in it, and pick a sauce to dip it in.  The crisp veggies toned down the fire, and complemented the meat and fish well. Also, its just FUN to use your hands to eat.  For the desert, there was a sort-of rice tapioca / pudding dish. I was not a fan of the texture or taste. My friends told me that while I was away at the bathroom before the dessert arrived, I missed the waiter telling them that the restaurant is still trying to work out the kinks with the desserts.  I have to appreciate the honesty. Despite the Lao-see (Lousy, see what I did there?) dessert, I rate this restaurant 5 stars. My taste buds were built for this food, and I found everything to be spot-on.  Service was also excellent - from the hostess. Bartender, to the waiter.

4.0,9/17/2013,"This is a new Banh Mi sandwich window with a very clever name. It's a kiosk next to the hip new restaurant, Khe-Yo (get it?).They have just two sandwiches available: the Jurgielewicz Duck Confit and the Beer Lao-Braised Berkshire Pork Belly ($11 each). The duck one comes with some of the amazing Bang Bang dipping sauce that they use at the main restaurant next door, while the pork belly comes with an au jus dipping sauce.They're both pretty good. It was tough to find any actual meat though on the pork belly one - it was pretty much all belly and no pork. They're also obviously way overpriced for Banh Mi, which you can get for literally half the price in Chinatown. But it's in TriBeCa, and I guess the ingredients are a little fancier than your typical Banh Mi. I'd rather take some good old chicken or a classic one though over the extremely fatty pork belly in this one.If you like that pure fatiness though, you will be in heaven with these sandwiches. And the bread is delicious and nice and crispy. I wouldn't mind stopping by here again if they switch up the menu and add some new sandwiches.",8,5,9,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
3.0,9/12/2013,"Somehow I am feeling bad to give them a 3 stars which makes me a minority on this board where the average rating is 4.5 (really?).I do think Khe-Yo does have lots potential, especially as the one and only Laotian restaurants in the city, it has an unspoken mission to show New Yorkers what Lao cuisine is. Yet, I think they faied me, as least last night, on both the food and the services.I came in here after work by myself on a Wed, 7ish. The restaurant was almost full. So I just grab a seat at the bar. Let me just say it out loud now, the service was subpar last night. But I am not going to bitch about it and leave it to the end of this review. I want to focus on the food first. I ordered 3 apps and an entree (yes lots left over) because I was excited to try as many as I could!  Green papaya salad: mediocre at best. There is no mint and I barely could taste the fish sauce. I have never been to Laos but I did go to the Isaam area (northern Thai) twice and if I remember it correctly, Laos and the northern Thais are the same origin. So I assume the cuisine shall be similar; secondly, how could you make Tam-Mak-Hoong without fish sauce? This might be the worst green papaya salad I ever had in the city.  For those who want to know which restaurant I am comparing to, Zab elee(northern Thai cuisine). Go see it yourself. Duck Laap: this is actually very good. the crispy fried duck tongue and soft and juicy duck breast together created a very interesting contrast. The two then were tossed with chopped lemongrass, shallots, scallions, chiles, cilantro, mint. Very refreshing for a 90 F late late summer day! But again, something was missing, fish sauce. Long Island Fluke & Banana Flower: was decent but the fish did not taste fresh; plus the seasoning is, boring, I am sorry for lacking a better word.For the main, I ordered the whole grilled black bass, which I anticipated the most. It turned out, the higher your anticipation, the bigger your disappointment. Mind you, I had been to both Thailand and Vietnam couple times for Thailand. So I am fairly familiar with how people along the Mekong river cook their fish, be it grilled or steamed in banana leaf. But that is def not what I was served at Khe-Yo. I am sorry to be harsh. The fish was not rubbed with salt before grilling which ending up almost tasteless. Plus the fish selection, black bass, might just not a good option. A fresh water ones might be better, just like the Laos do. To make this dish worse, the tamarind peanut sauce. Bad match. Isn't that just served with Roasted Tomato Chili Sauce in Laos? Onto the service two major pitfalls. Waitress/Bar tender obviously not trained well about their menu or the cuisine itself, offering no help with my ordering. ""I don't know"" is not the answer. Secondly, I could not even get my order of wine for 15 mins, not getting my water till my food firstly arrived, waited over 15 mins after I finished my first salad and before the next one came out.All in all, I was not impressed. I may not return any time soon even though I am living nearby. The wine by the glass is a bit overpriced too for the quality ($15).I am not sure how many reviewers here actually been to Laos or at least northern Thai. The high rating might just because of novelty/exoticism.",1,0,1,Nomad M.,"New York, NY",126,298,1138
2.0,9/10/2013,"I actually feel terrible to report that Kho-Ye was overall a disappointment. I was excited to try this place because of the overwhelmingly positive Yelp reviews and because I was excited for Laotian food. Apparently it's the only Laotian restaurant in the city! I really wish I could've loved it. However, nothing we ate nearly matched up to my expectations. Sadly, even if I had not built up my expectations, I would still be disappointed because the food was barely mediocre, and when you factor in price, it becomes a restaurant for which I now have strong aversions. We managed to squeeze in a same day reservation on a Monday for 8:45. The ambiance was dark and trendy and there was a nice bar in the front of the restaurant, so not a bad option for a place to wait to be seated. Upon being seated, we were given lemon hand cloths (a nice touch), and shortly afterward,  a basket of sticky rice with salsa and bang bang sauce (spicy sauce which was way too salty) as accoutrements. It was the restaurant's equivalent of bread and butter, which I really appreciated and enjoyed. Though I highly doubt that traditional Laotian cuisine includes salsa, I'm glad it was included because James loved the sticky rice and salsa. Our server was really great and the service was consistently strong throughout the meal. He encouraged us to eat with our hands--not only was it tradition, but it would also bring out the taste--and I happily set down my utensils and set to work balling up the sticky rice. We ordered the beef jerky and the duck salad as starters. The beef jerky was nowhere near as tender and flavorful as I had expected. In fact, it was rather dry and flavorless. We tried adding generous spoonfuls of the sauce that it came with but it didn't help too much. I think that this dish was missing a bit of a kick to make it stand out. I expected a lot from homemade jerky and was sorely disappointed. The duck salad was actually really good and the best part of the meal. The duck slices were aromatic and tender and well complemented by the bed of greens. For our main courses, we tried the bass and the pork belly. Though it was impressive to look at, the fish was nowhere best as tender or flavorful as I expected. I didn't like the tamarind sauce but liked the traditional fish sauce, so I was glad that the sauces came on the side. The pork belly was extremely salty and I did not enjoy the dish at all. The soup that accompanied the dish was salty and while I love Asian greens, the vegetables that the pork belly was served with had too high of a stem to leaf proportion. I really wish I had better things to say about this restaurant and I wish I weren't such a downer.

4.0,9/6/2013,"KenScale: 8.0/10Khe-Yo is a new restaurant from chef and restaurateur Marc Forgione in partnerhsip with Soulayphet Schwader (""Chef Phet"") featuring cuisine from Laos based on Chef Phet's Laotian heritage. I've never tried Laotian dishes before, and walked out of the restaurant very pleased with the food that the restaurant offered.For starters, I tried Jurgielewicz duck salad with lemongrass and crunchy coconut rice with sausage and baby iceberg. Both dishes were outstanding. The duck salad was very fresh and flavorful, and I would come back to the restaurant for this dish alone. Crunchy coconut rice was also very crunchy and an excellent way to start the meal. Main dishes were also very good, although a tad short compared to the two appetizers that I had. Chili prawns with giner scallion toast was rich and delicious, but I couldn't see much difference from the chili lobster with toast dish that I loved so much at chef Forgione's eponymous restaurant. Whole grilled black bass with crispy shallots and Tamarind peanut sauce featured very tasty meat. The restaurant's sole dessert, coconut rice pudding, was also solid, but not particularly amazing.The restaurant has a full bar, with a selection of Southeast Asia-inspired cocktails. It was very crowded on a Thursday night when I visited, so make sure to make a reservation in advance. I was a little bummed when I had to wait despite having made a reservation (I couldn't be seated until my full party arrived), but the manager kindly made up for my frustration by serving the coconut rice pudding dessert and cocktails with ginseng for free at the end of the meal.

5.0,9/3/2013,"After reading the reviews from some of my trusted Yelp friends I finally got to Khe-Yo.  Took the family out for a night of adventurous eating.  I had not had Laotian food since the late 80's in Arlington Virginia which was as I recall good but not great.  We started with an assortment of appetizers in addition to the sticky rice with bang bang sauce that was on the table.  Yes, you eat it with your hands which is a an absolute delight to my Daughters.  The bang bang sauce is amazing.  I would describe it as chillies in fish sauce but I bet it's more complex than that.  This stuff should be sold for home consumption because I would put that sh*t on anything.  Then we had the Creekstone Farms sesame beef jerky with smoked chili sauce and fresh radish.  Jerky has never been this good.  Each bite was a sheer delight and you could taste the marinade that made it so good.  We had the crunchy coconut rice with the spicy kaffir lime sausage and baby iceberg lettuce.  Delicious but it fills you up fast and I might skip it next time because it is so filling.  We also got the pork belly and crispy shrimp rolls with bibb lettuce, perilla & carrot.  Delciate and delicious as well.  The food is meant to be shared and we did.  My Wife got the Rock Cornish Hen salad which was ground spiced chicken on romanine hearts and toasted rice.  This too was outstanding.  The service was excellent and every dish was explained thoroughly.  Kudos to our waiter for being so solicitous of my girls.  The drinks wwere banging as well.  I had the plum gin drink which was refreshing and beautifully presented.  My Wife had the thai basil jalapeno vodka drink which was spicy and damn good.On to the entrees:  My youngest Daughter has ther Lemongrass Berkshire Sprae Ribs with smashed long bean & Heirloom tomato which she loved but could not finsih so home they came.  My oldest Daughter & my wife each got the chilli prawns on ginger scallion toast & thai basil.  They loved it.  I had a taste and I would consider getting that next time except that they have specials.  My original plan to get the pork belly was thwarted.   Once the waiter said we have a pig face special I was ready for the foodie adventure of a lifetime.  He warned me it was big.  He did not lie.  It was epically huge and yes it looked like a pig face.  The outside texture was like a well done spare rib with the most tender moist and rich pig face meat underneath.  Yes it was fatty and salty but that was what I expected out of a pig face.  I could not finish it but it was outstanding.  The bang bang sauce worked nicely with it.  It was a lot of work and perhaps would have been better if served off the bones but I loved it anyways.  We were too full for dessert but I am definitely coming back.  Every aspect of the evening was perfect: service; atmosphere, food, and drinks all top notch.  Kudos to Forgione and Chef Phet you have hit it out of the park.My only complaint is that is very dark in here and hard to see what you are eating.",10,1,8,Scott S.,"Short Hills, NJ",4913,715,1351
4.0,9/3/2013,Very solid addition to the neighborhood.  Bang Bang sauce is great.  Really like the rice and sauces substituting bread and butter.  Whole fish was great for share and the desert of rice pudding was surprisingly refreshing and not too filling.All around good food and service.,0,0,0,M S.,"CANAL STREET, NY",0,14,0
3.0,9/3/2013,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I have to break it to everyone.  It's not that good.  Its all this grand opening hype caused by being a Marc Forgione collaboration. I was very excited to try this place, hoping that it would replace Pok Pok and the wait.  Given that this is the first Laotion place in the city, I wasn't sure what to expect, but at the same time I've had my fair share of south east asian cuisine and expected food from Laos to be a mish mash of all the flavors I love from the neighboring countries.To sum it up food was MEH.  We ordered the famed (half) pig's head, which is the size of a spring chicken (and felt really ripped off) considering there wasn't much meat on it, it was just skin and fat.  Ordered the Grill Fish and got very annoyed trying to pick everything off the bone.  Once fish is overcooked it will stick to the bone, I don't even cook and I know that!  The red curry might have been the best entree out of the three, but it was just an fancy eggplant dish with some mushrooms on the side.  It should be called eggplant with curry sauce, since it's not the big bowl of curry that you'd expect.For appetizers we had the beef jerky and crunchy sticky rice.  Sticky rice wasn't bad, think of it as a rice ball.  Not sure I'm a fan of the beef jerky, tasted all burnt to a crisp.It was dark as hell in there.  I couldn't even see my food.  I am all for ambiance, but when it is pitch dark, it should be flagged as a safety hazard.Don't get too excited or you will be disappointed.",2,1,0,Tina Y.,"WALL STREET, NY",227,269,2984
5.0,8/28/2013,"One of the best dining experiences I've had in quite some time. The food is incomparable--gorgeous presentation and explosive with flavor. The staff is incredibly knowledgable and efficient. The ambiance is great--understated industrial decor, intimate lighting and ambient music.Our server, Vance, was charming and casual when coaching us through the more unique dishes. The food runner was also quite knowledgeable of the menu, a refreshing change from the usual silent runners at other restaurants. The bussers were quite stelthy when refreshing water and clearing/marking the tables between courses. At one point during the evening, my friend noticed a small stain on her white sweater and not even 10 seconds later, before I could even finish saying the words ""club soda,"" the hostess brought some over with a smile and a joke. Last, but certainly not least, Chef Phet, despite his indusputable culinary genius, greeted us at the end of the night with such humility and gave us some insight on his vision for the menu. Very excited to see it evolve and expand. Bottomline: The service was sharp. And not just for having opened a mere month ago. Now onto the food--the REAL star of this show. (For the record, Khe-Yo would not shine nearly as bright without all the aforementioned supporting elements. However, the food is just indescribably good. That said, I'll briefly touch on what we ordered. Truth is, you just have to go and experience this food yourself!)Now I can't recall exactly every dish in detail, (because in all honestly, I felt like I was on the most incredible acid trip of my life--each bite more euphoric than the last) but I'll reference the menu again and highlight my favorites with an asterisk for posterity's sake, even though every single dish was uniquely flavorful and dynamic.The Long Island Fluke & Banana Flower* Crunchy Coconut Rice*Jurgielewicz DuckCreekstone Farms Sesame Beef Jerky***Chili PrawnsWhole Grilled Black Bass*And I can't end this without mentioning the BANG BANG SAUCE (served with sticky rice). It might actually be the best thing in the world. I would like to get paid in this bang bang sauce.Okay, so maybe I've gone a little overboard with the superlatives and you're thinking ""What is this guy getting out of it?"" The answer is NOTHING. Just giving credit where credit is due. Khe-Yo is truly one of a kind.",0,1,0,Fernando T.,"Manhattan, NY",4,4,0
4.0,8/26/2013,"Khe-Yo has been on a straight upward ascend since opening, and it's not difficult to see why. In a city so saturated with great restaurant, ethnic Southeast Asian cuisine such as Laotian are still grossly underrepresented. I love Chef Phet and Marc Forgione for mixing things up, and pushing the envelope. Khe-Yo excels in offering a tight menu of a combination of familiar ingredients with complex flavors.The bf, BL and I visited during a Saturday evening, excited to venture a little outside our typical culinary comfort zones. We started with a round of cocktails, inspired by some tropical fruits and SE Asian flavors: my rum, young coconut, strawberry and kaffir lime was refreshingly sweet, although more spiced rum would have rounded out the sweetness more. The boys had some gin and bourbon-based concoctions, which also had some interesting ingredients like kalamansi and thai basil. We were then greeted with a little basket of hot sticky rice, which we were advised to dip in a spicy bang bang sauce or tomato-based relish with our hands. I love that the server encouraged us to eat with our hands, in keeping with Laotian tradition, making for a more fun and interactive experience. And hey, I'm all for direct hand to mouth action. Eating with our hands continued for a good part of our meal - as the crunchy coconut rice, pork belly and shrimp crispy rolls, bamboo grilled ginger quail and whole grilled black bass all required some sort of wrapping in various lettuces and dipping in condiments. While we picked up the duck laap (salad) with our utensils, the dish was no less exciting - a flavorful and balanced plate of spicy watercress and herbs, tender seared duck breast and exquisitely fried duck tongue taken off the bone and cartilage. This reminded me of the northern Thai larb, only slightly sweeter. The grilled quail was perfectly grilled to retain its sweet tenderness, nicely presented still strapped to a bamboo branch which imparted a subtle fragrance. The crunchy coconut rice with spicy kaffir lime sausage and iceberg was a standout, totally fun to eat as you have to mix and mash all the different components together to release the oils from the roasted chili peppers and allow the flavors to meld. I swear it was like a flavor and textural revelation the moment it touched my mouth. The fried bass was grilled and presented whole, which I greatly appreciated. The fish was nicely cooked and seasoned, although our only complaint was that it was covered in various inedible garnishes like fried bay leaves and huge chunks of ginger.I am looking forward to come back soon, to try more things on the very controlled menu. Service is surprisingly efficient and smooth for a relatively new restaurant, and the ambiance of the dining room is comfortable and slightly industrial. The only thing that would make Khe-Yo better at this point is a bigger wine list, and perhaps stronger cocktails.",3,1,2,Cecilia Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",762,644,43
5.0,8/26/2013,"Khe-Yo is one of the best restaurants I've been to this year. To start, the service and staff was perfect. When I called to make a reservation, the hostess moved things around to accommodate my request, which is rare with hot, new restaurants. While waiting for my table and having a delicious drink at the bar, the bartender couldn't have been more friendly and recommended dishes that I would like. He even went as far as reserving a baby pig head, the special of the night, because there were only two left.The meal was delicious. If you like spice, put the bang bang sauce on everything. My Dad and I shared the duck salad, pork belly/shrimp crisp rolls and the baby pig head. Everything was great. The baby pig head was so unique, flavorful and fun to eat. If you have a weak stomach though, avoid this. It's aggressive and not the easiest thing to look at!I can't wait to go back to Khe-Yo.",1,0,0,Jen S.,"Manhattan, NY",53,24,0
4.0,8/25/2013,"""I said bang bang bangity bang, bang bang bangity bang"" ...sauceIf you get the reference then oh yeeeeaaaaaah it's that satisfying. Smell, sight, taste and sound all rolled into one great meal. At the suggestion of our waiter, Vance, the boyfriend ordered a dark lager (Beer Lao Dark, $7) and I ordered the Cucumber-Thai Chili Vodka, $13 (Fresh Cucumber, Lime, Bubbles) to complement our anticipatory spicy meal. The meal started off with complimentary sticky rice with two sauces; tomato puree and their signature Bang Bang sauce (I said bang bang bangity bang, bang bang bangity bang...). Both sauces equally as delicious but the Bang Bang sauce had quite the kick. As our waiter recommended, we dug into the sticky rice, rolled it into a little ball and dipped to our taste buds content...and although we kept telling each other to stop eating the rice because it would fill us up, the sticky rice disappeared with a quickness. Next up was the Long Island Fluke & Banana Flower {Laap-Pa} $13 (Fresh Mint, Kaffir Lime Leaf & Galangal Chips). I was wishy washy about ordering this dish because I really wanted to try everything that Chef Phet could offer. Since the fish was crudo I thought ordering this dish would mean missing out on something else. I'm so glad my brain went into auto-pilot and I ordered it without thinking. The intense flavors complemented the fluke so well. Probably my favorite dish of the night. After we polished off the fluke, Vance promptly set down the Jurgielewicz Duck {Laap-Peht} $15 (Lemongrass, Langue de Canard & Rau-Rum). OMG so delicious. If I had one complaint, it would be I wished there was more duck. It was one of those dishes where I quickly thought about wrestling the boyfriend for his last piece but refrained by anticipating what the next dish would bring.  Cockles with basil and garlic (off the specials): extremely tasty and nice sized pieces of toast to sop up all the sauce. We ended up ordering the Crunchy Coconut Rice {Nam-Khao} $10 (Spicy Kaffir Lime Sausage & Baby Iceberg) part way into the appetizers due to my brain lapse with the fluke but the meal didn't miss a beat. The crunchy coconut rice came out shortly after we polished off the cockles. Just between you and me, the crunchy coconut rice was really good but I was really glad I ordered the fluke. The boyfriend really liked the crunchy coconut rice so I'm glad we ordered both. ...as for the pièce de résistance - Roasted Pig Face. I had read about Khe-Yo's special Roasted PIg Face that wasn't on the regular menu so the boyfriend and I were really hoping we'd be able to get an order in. As soon as Vance mentioned the special entree for the night, I immediately blurted out, ""Pig head?! Tell me it's the pig head!"" When the roasted pig face was set down in front of us, Vance recommended using the bang bang sauce and eating EVERYTHING except the teeth and bones....to which we did. I can't be more proud to say that when our dinner came to an end, the couple next to us (who also ordered the roasted pig face and finished around the same time) left most of it claiming it was ""too rich."" Vance too one look at our plate and said, ""Wow, looks like you two really went to town on this."" Damn straight. I was only slightly disappointed after our great dinner had ended while we were waiting for the check, Chef Phet came out into the dining area and greeted table next to us. I was so ready to shake his hand and tell him what an amazing meal we had when he skipped over our table and turned to the one behind him instead. Perhaps it was because the table next to us just got their meal and our table was empty? Whatever the case, I felt a bit slighted that he came out to greet his patrons and didn't greet us. None-the-less Chef Phet, kudos to you for being the first Laotian restaurant to open in Manhattan and making the meal a very worthwhile experience.",5,3,3,Vanessa T.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",93,68,84
4.0,8/22/2013,"Now don't get me wrong, I had a great experience but if I have to be honest, 3 stars is all I could give when it came to the food. There were a lot of things that were 4 and 5 stars about this place but the food was just average. We walked in without a reservation on a Wednesday night at around 8:45 and were told it would be an hour wait. I liked the decor, it is a bit reminiscent of Marc Forgione's place which I love btw only with an Asian twist. One of the Hostesses could not have been nicer. We were given menus right away and decided to wait by the bar. The place isn't that big so the bar waiting area is a bit awkward as most people in that area are sitting at the bar eating. We couldn't get the bartenders attention so the nice Hostess ended up taking our order. We were only there about 10 minutes when the couple in front of us got up to leave, score on the bar stools! For drinks we started with the cucumber-thai chili vodka with fresh cucumber lime and bubbles and the mango-lemongrass tequila with fresh mango citrus and soda and both drinks were as good as they sound. Our bartender was attentive and was great at offering suggestions on the food menu. The menu is small but everything sounded so good we wanted to order it all. After discussing with the bartender he determined we probably were ordered too much food with 3 appetizers and 2 entrees so we paired it down to 2 apps and 1 entree to split and it was perfect. To start we had the creekstone farms sesame beef jerky with smoked chili sauce and fresh radish. They serve sticky rice with your order and it was classically good served with some nice sauces. The beef jerky was good if a bit dry, I know, jerky what do you expect but I was hoping for a bit more. Watch out for the sauces they serve alongside as they offer some kick, wowie! We also went with the pork belly & shrimp crispy rolls with bibb lettuce and sweet carrots. These were somewhat like an egg roll, sliced like a sushi roll and perfect for rolling up in the lettuce leaves with the accoutrement's served on the side, very good. For an entree I feel like we should have gone with our original choice of the pork jowl red curry but instead went with the chili prawns with ginger scallion toast. The best part of this dish was the buttery slices of toast dipped in the chili sauce, heavenly. The shrimp were served head-on and I just wasn't a huge fan of them, but I did proceed to devour the bread, sticky rice and anything else I could dip in that sauce. The wine list is short and sweet and I had a lovely glass of Chateau Belingard Bergerac Sec. We were definitely satisfied with the amount of food we ordered, it was just enough. I definitely would recommend this place for the atmosphere and the service, definitely 5 stars, and the food was interesting enough to warrant a trip back.",0,0,0,Leslie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,444,2
5.0,8/21/2013,"My experience at Khe-Yo just might be the best one I have had at a NYC restaurant thus far. The service was impeccable and the quality shows through the wait staff as they GUSH about the dishes when you place your order. The ambiance is different than I had expected. I thought it was much smaller than it actually is. The ceilings are very high, which give it an open feel. We went for our anniversary and could not decide on our dishes. So, we ordered one of almost everything. The sticky rice cannot be missed and I wanted to pour bang bang sauce on everything!We ordered the whole bass (do not pass on this) and were pleasantly surprised by how well it was prepared, the flavors that were held within and its pairing. We also tried the shrimp and pork roll appetizer - which was another flavor explosion. The real surprise for us was the pork belly which comes with an amazing broth. I wouldn't pass that dish up if I were you. The final dish was the spare ribs. They literally melted in our mouth. All in all, this restaurant is a gem and will be my favorite meal for some time. We paired the meal with their unfiltered Sake - AMAZING!I can't wait to go back. I want to try the duck salad.",2,1,1,Alyvia M.,"New York, NY",486,774,48
5.0,8/18/2013,"This place is absolutely incredible. I understand all the buzz it's starting to generate and I'm super glad I came before there's [potentially] full blown pandemonium. I had astronomical expectations and they were definitely exceeded. Service: From the start the service was spot on, including making a reservation. The time I wanted to reserve was unavailable, yet the reservationist took my name and number down and promised to call if anyone had canceled. True to their word, I got a call the night before as well as day of asking if I had wanted to move my reserved time. Food: There are not enough adjectives in the English language to describe how amazing the food is.We started off with drinks. I had the rum with young coconut and strawberry [$13]. Served in a martini glass, it was visually beautiful and tasty. Similar to any other cocktail you'd get at a trendy restaurant. My friend got the gin with plum, I actually liked hers better.Sticky Rice [complimentary]: It doesn't look like there's a whole lot of rice in the very cute wooden basket. Don't be deceived, there actually is and don't make the mistake of filling up on it. Remember rice expands in your stomach! The bang bang sauce on the side was delicious, spicy and tangy and goes well with all the subsequent dishes we ordered. The roasted tomato sauce was alright but can't hold a candle to the bang bang.Crunchy Coconut Rice [$10] with spicy kaffir lime sausage and iceberg lettuce: Slightly sweet from the coconut and lime, slightly salty from the sausage, wrapping it all up in the iceberg lettuce and throwing some bang bang sauce on it was ""the perfect bite."" I was too chicken to throw the Thai chilies on there. Pork Belly and Shrimp Crispy Rolls [$9]: This came out on a big platter and looked a little intimidating. Also, the waiter recommended wrapping the roll in the bibb lettuce with the sprouts, mint, sweet carrots, and the bang bang sauce. The mint really makes this dish refreshing and not overpowering or spicy/salty from all the ingredients. Braised Berkshire Pork Belly [$25] with quail egg and summer gourd pork broth: Yet again the waiter described the ""perfect bite"" as recommended by the chef. Drop some pork belly on the rice along with the vegetables and bang bang sauce [more bang bang sauce] and eat. Use the gourd pork broth to cleanse the palette. Repeat. The pork belly was so tender, I enjoyed even the fatty bits. The pieces were huge. It was kind of difficult compiling ""the perfect bite"" but every effort was worth it. I could have done without the quail as it didn't add to the dish. The pork broth was indeed cleansing, if not a little bland.Lemongrass Berkshire Spare Ribs [$23]: These were big and succulent and kind of smokey. I only had one as I had hit the food wall at this point.  The smashed beans and heirloom tomatoes on the side were served cold and also didn't add anything to the dish. We didn't get dessert which was wise since we rolled out of Khe-Yo. All in all, it was $50pp with alcohol, so it definitely doesn't break the bank.Honestly, you can't tell that this is a new spot. It's like they've been around for years. Excellent.",1,0,0,Felisa F.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,198,192
4.0,8/16/2013,"Finally a Laotian restaurant in Manhattan.  We got the dishes that were recommended by the waiter: the home staple chicken salad, the street food grilled quail, and the black bass.  Everything tasted great, even the incredibly spicy bang bang sauce.  The one star off five is the price.  Will still go back and try the rest,  wish they have more dessert selection (only a rice pudding at this point)...was really looking forward to interesting desserts after all the interesting dishes.",0,0,0,Stan P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,182,1

5.0,8/14/2013,"It's not often that a restaurant is so deserving of a gold star, I'd almost rather keep the secret to myself. Alas, with just under a few weeks on the books, Khe-Yo's accolades have already spread like wild fire--with darn good reason. This Laotian gem taking up res in Duane Park's old digs is backed by all-star power duo, Marc Forgione and Executive Chef Phet (Soulayphet Schwader) and presents what is perhaps the most unique concept to hit these streets in years. Ducking into the dim, reclaimed-wood laden spot, we were immediately enveloped in the warmth and homey-feeling so oft overlooked when dropping a big name like Forgione behind a project. We were led to the back of the 64-seater--a perfect size really as it afforded just the right amount of intimacy, afforded for conversation at normal levels and still left enough of an airy, easy-breezy feel to accommodate group diners, young and old. There was a surprising number of both in fact on the restaurant's fourth night of service, all foodies to be sure, ready to indulge on not-so-usual fare. The menu was presented on a simple bamboo square, with a short, but sweet list of bespoke, inventive cocktails highlighting herbal infusions, fresh fruit and floral liquors. I went for their uber refreshing, kick-in-the-back-of-your-throat cucumber and thai-chili infused vodka tipple, while my girl took our bubbly waiter's suggestion and opted for a subtly sweet, smooth mixture of rum, coconut and strawberries. We perused the menu, which may seem limited until further inspection, is an amalgam of funky, inspired dishes of richly prepared proteins with stunning, flavor-forward profiles. Asian and Thai renderings are what came to mind as we wrapped our head around the Laotian-inspired descriptions. Sure, we probably couldn't tell you exactly where Laos is on the map, but it didn't matter, as we would soon find that Chef Phet has successfully carried his native fare into modern Manhattan.Small plates are not so small and meant to be shared. We dug our chopsticks into an assortment of vibrant, beautifully plated dishes including the rock Cornish chicken salad with romaine, the smashed green papaya salad and the sesame beef jerky with smoked chili sauce to start. Both salads were refreshing and I absolutely loved the fresh peanuts and rice puffs atop the tangy papaya whereas the Cornish hen gave off just the right amount of flavor and popped alongside the fresh romaine and bits of fried chicken skin embedded within. Next, we fell in love with the bowl of crunchy coconut rice with spicy kaffir lime sausage--the rice was perfectly crispy on the outside and supple on the inside and the meat provided the perfect sweet-meets-salty measure. This, along with the bamboo grilled ginger quail, set alight by the bang bang dipping sauce Chef Phet makes with a secret recipe every morning, as well the pork belly and shrimp crispy rolls (which I recommend rolling up in the accompanying accouterments for easy lettuce cup-snacking) were killer.Excited for more, our entrees swooped down upon us and were again, a feast for the eyes as well as the belly. The Chili prawns, served head on, came bathing in a deeply orange, ginger-laden sauce alongside buttery scallion brioche, and played perfectly well alongside the grilled half chicken (*note to those diners looking for lighter dishes--this one, along with the papaya salad are spot on) which was simple, and awe-inspiringly juicy--the sweet chili honey and cucumber salad was a palate pleasing garnish to be sure. Finally, we couldn't pass up the lemongrass spare ribs. I'm the first to say that I'm not typically a spare rib fan, but these babies were outstanding and were falling off the bone with one small tug--not to mention, we could've all put away plate upon plate of the smashed long bean and heirloom tomato salad it was served with. It was that good, and I'm salivating again as we speak.Finally, though stuffed to the gils, we were treated to what was the biggest highlight of our evening. Just as we were ready to throw in the chopsticks and loosen our belts, our waiter came carrying the dish over to our table, a big smile on his face (and ours) and Chef Phet in tow. Phet was humble as they come and walked us through the best way to dig into the picture-worthy Pig Face (yes, ears and all) and we all sampled bits of the incredibly succulent succulent, juicy interior and crunchy, salty, smoky cracklings of its exterior. Though the desserts list is extremely limited, and consists of a singular rice pudding and a heartily poured Hennessy-laden Laotian specialty cocktail, we didn't mind as we couldn't fathom eating anything else.

5.0,8/11/2013,"Phenomenal!  We're huge fans of Thai and Vietnamese cuisines and were excited to try Laotian cuisine for our anniversary.  TriBeCa is great - street parking was easy (we may have gotten lucky but it seemed there were spots everywhere because we went after 7:00.)  This place was only opened about 2 weeks when we went... aside from from a smaller-than-is-typical menu, there were absolutely no signs that this restaurant was ""starting out.""  Service was fantastic, all staff seemed genuinely proud and happy, (even Chef Phet kept popping his head out of the kitchen and smiling, occasionally going up to tables and shaking their hands) ... and the food was outrageous.  And even after reading other reviews on Yelp, there had already been some additions / changes made to the menu on our visit.  Here's what we got:Appetizers: Bamboo Grilled Ginger Quail - This was my favorite appetizer.  Caramelized, crispy skin, tender meat, incredible flavor. Even after it was over, I found myself gnawing on the bamboo sticks and lemongrass ties it was BBQ'd on.  Quail is small, so if you're sharing this one, be prepared for a few precious bites.Pork Belly & Shrimp Crispy Rolls - My husband's favorite.  You get one crispy roll cut into 4 pieces, with the makings of a wrap on the same plate: lettuce, noodles, bean sprouts, cucumbers, tomatoes, mint & other herbs, and dipping sauce.  The roll to veggies ratio was a little off for me, but everything was very tasty, in retrospect, it's good the portions are small so you can try more and not feel as full.  Creekstone Farms Sesame Beef Jerky - Pretty good.  We tried it just out of curiosity.   Tasty little sticks... but I would skip them next time.  If you're not with sharers and had to eat them on your own as your only appetizer, you'd be a little bummed.  They're not really satisfying and pale in comparison to the other apps.  Entrees:Pork Jowl Red Curry - YUM! Not as spicy as my husband was hoping for, but I thought it was just the right amount of heat (plus the restaurant was a little warm so we would have been sweating if it'd be super duper spicy).  Laotian curry is not made creamy with coconut milk, so it didn't feel that heavy.  Little bits of tender meat coated in tasty curry ... I didn't even need the jasmine rice it came with.  Braised Berkshire Pork Belly -  Hands down the BEST pork belly we have ever had, anywhere.  Tender meat, not too fatty, amazing sauce... just delicious.  Came with a side of greens (forgot the name) that had an amazing grilled flavor and were so fresh.  Also came with a pork broth that was meant as a palate cleanser.  I had a few spoonfuls because it was so tasty but I didn't have too much, mainly because I didn't want my palate cleansed with all those amazing flavors going on. Dessert:Coconut Rice Pudding & Strawberries - Truth be told, this is the only dessert on the menu. They have this and lots of after dinner drinks.  I like to end the meal on a cool, sweet note so we shared it.  It was definitely tasty - sweet, thick pudding, fresh strawberries, and tasty crunchy things on top.  I liked it but was a little on the dense and heavy side after the big meal. Family Liqueur -  Apparently this is the Phet family recipe.  Peaches and Hennessy and a secret blend of spices.  It's refreshing but not sweet at all.  Served on the rocks so it was a bit watered down after about 5 minutes.  My husband liked it.  Overall a great meal and a cool atmosphere - wonderful dinner experience.  For as much food and drink as we had, not even that expensive.  Would definitely recommend to try something new and delicious.",1,1,1,Lisa S.,"Clifton, NJ",0,6,3
4.0,8/8/2013,"Really more 4.5. If I had one complaint, and I really only do have one complaint, its that the ribs were WAY too salty. Like I probably should have just sent them back - perhaps one of the sous chefs dropped an extra handful of maldon or something but no biggie.Everything else was fantastic. The hostesses were also quite lovely and it wasn't one of those places where they know they are going to get a ton of business so they just treat people like cr*p - they seem to sympathize that you're going to wait and try to make that as pleasant as possible.If you do one thing in life, get the beef jerky. Really solid stuff. I also very much liked the sticky rice- its quite good. For a relatively new place they also seem to have a lot of the initial kinks worked out which is always nice.",0,0,0,Sean K.,"San Diego, CA",27,312,0
4.0,8/6/2013,"Made reservations for 9:30 with a friend, but we got there at 8:30 to see if we could be seated, and thankfully they had two seats at the bar. Ordered:Pork Belly & Shrimp Crispy Rolls Home Style - nothing specialBraised Berkshire Pork Belly - I liked this, especially the sauce.Lemongrass Berkshire Spare Ribs - tasted a little dated, even the marination couldn't mask that taste coconut rice pudding - favorite item, love the combination of strawberries, the pudding and the crushed flakesThe menu is quite small, I'd come back if that ever expands.",2,2,4,Robert N.,"New York, NY",343,225,30
4.0,8/3/2013,"The last time I so blatantly ate with my hands I was in pre-school and the food was nowhere near as delicious.  Maybe I've been missing out?FOMO aside, Khe-Yo delivers a polished, unique dining experience just one week into its run.  The service -- shout out to Vance -- is terrific, explaining the dishes and suggesting how to combine ingredients to get the best bite.For two people, two appetizers and two entrees is the right amount of food.  The Crunchy Coconut Rice, smashed up at the table, is a can't miss appetizer.  The whole Black Bass entree is easily picked off the bone to place into lettuce wraps for handmade fish tacos.  Add a bottle of wine and tip, and you have a fun, flavorful meal for a reasonable $160.The uniqueness of Laotian cuisine in NYC, the professionalism of the staff and the buzz within the restaurant make it easy to envision Khe-Yo becoming a Tribeca staple.",2,2,0,Tom E.,"Manhattan, NY",6,47,1
5.0,8/1/2013,"Really good. I was a bit iffy about coming here, just because most times when I go to a ""fringe"" Asian restaurant, there ends up being one or two dishes from the spotlighted country, and then a bunch of dishes that are thinly veiled variants from their larger neighbors.Thankfully, that wasn't really the case here, as far as I know anyway. While the flavor profiles are kinda similar to some Thai food, there's definitely some interesting things going on here. We were given an interesting rice appetizer where we were supposed to grab the rice with our hands, roll it up into a ball, and then dip it into one of two salsas. It was fun to actually be encouraged to play with your food. The rice is slightly sweet, and it goes well with the spicy ""Bang Bang"" sauce.The crunchy coconut rice dish is very good as well. It has a nice kick to it, and, while I could be wrong, it tasted like it had some kind of shrimp paste in it. Like most of the dishes, it comes with lettuce so that you can make your own wraps. My friend saw Chef Phet bringing out a boar or pig's head to his friends, so we quickly tried to order one as well. It will supposedly be added to the menu soon, but to start there will only be 16 available per week. It's not too large, and can be comfortably shared between three people, but it's very tender and flavorful - thankfully not too smokey or salty like your standard bbq joints. We were encouraged to eat the eye (by the caucasian waiter for anyone wondering). I really didn't want to, but after he recommended it, I ate a sliver; it was actually pretty tasty. Kind of like a meat pudding. Just close your eyes. We also got the black bass. A good complement to the pig's head since the pig's head is so rich and heavy, while the fish is light and flaky (but still flavorful).Good job, Chef Phet!",5,2,2,Ron H.,"Manhattan, NY",206,335,200
5.0,7/31/2013,"Alright - we pretty much had everything on the menu - and it was all fantastic. My aunt is Laotian and she couldn't find any errors in the food. Go there- order a lot, use your hands and make sure you get some bang bang sauce to dip it in. Good call Pet (owner chef) = I look forward to coming back shortly.",0,0,1,G T.,"New York, NY",2,13,0
4.0,7/30/2013,"Nice job Forgione. Glad to see you were out in the dining area tonight. Been eyeing the restaurant for awhile and was very happy with our experience. Our server was very helpful in explaining the dishes as this was our first time having Laotian food. It was good to eat with my hands as it made me reminisce of my childhood eating Filipino food with my hands. I must admit I was a bit rusty. We were intrigued with the rice given in lieu of bread for the table. It's difficult to pick up with a fork or chopsticks, so that was a smart way to get us used to digging in with our fingers. We had the crispy rice and spring rolls for appetizers. Very flavorful without having to be spicy. The spring rolls reminded me of Vietnamese spring rolls but with more fresh herbs. We got the pork belly and spare ribs next. The spare ribs were a good size, great flavor, not overly saucy and came with Asian string beans that was crunchy and delicious. The pork belly was a bit more interesting with the accompanying broth. We were advised how to make the perfect bite including the pork belly, pork belly sauce, white rice, vegetable, pork belly broth and to top with the spicy sauce given with the rice at the beginning of the meal... Oh man, it is one hell of a bite. Reminds me how I pile up my spoon when eating a Filipino dish called nilaga, so you know I knew what I was doing. This place is a great addition to the neighborhood. Definitely elevated food in a lax atmosphere. Looking forward to trying more dishes on the menu and next time getting the coconut rice pudding!!!I'll be back!!!",5,2,3,Donna V.,"New York, NY",221,288,328
5.0,7/30/2013,"OMG is this for reals? There's actually a restaurant serving Lao food?!? I'm in awe and in shock with extremely high expectations. What more, I know ever item on the menu growing up eating them as my parents have been making the same dishes my entire life. I'm ecstatic. So really, it only makes sense for me to post the first review.It's spacious with nice exposed brick walls and dark coloring with great ambient lighting. Would be great for dates and intimate dinners. Background music is low enough for conversation without the yelling. Classy but not insanely so. The smells are amazing. This time around, we decided to order nam-khao, laap phet, crispy rolls and coconut rice pudding for dessert. Before you even start to get your food, like some restaurants they Khe-Yo gives you something to nibble on. Unlike those restaurants, it's not chips or bread, it's sticky rice with jaew aka sauces, two sauces to be exact. One is a roasted tomato-based sauce, which I personally don't like and have never liked growing up, but it's perfectly delicious...(I say this because I did continue to dunk my rice in it). The second sauce is the bang bang sauce, which is one of my all time favorite sauces in the world and is GREAT with steak and other suck meats...also good for dunking.Let's take a closer look at the food -Crunchy Coconut Rice {Nam-Khao}: basically you get a small bowl that has 4 balls of crunchy coconut rice with fresh homemade sausage on top. the server smashes the balls...you kind of mix it all together (I asked for lime as top off the delicious and cut the coconut a little and we also poured our bang bang sauce over it (because bang bang sauce is delicious) and then you eat it lettuce wrap style. Not exactly what I wanted, but it was pretty delicious and fresh.Pork Belly & Shrimp Crispy Rolls Home Style: you get one roll cut up into 5 slices...this is also served lettuce wrap style with more ingredients to add (bean sprouts, fresh mint, tomatoes, cucumber, vermicelli noodles, etc) and a sweet carrot sauce. Gather all the toppings and one piece of the crispy roll, make a canoe, add the sweet carrot sauce and then it's a one-biter!...and by that I mean just put the whole thing in your mouth so you don't miss out on any of the awesome flavors each of the components bring to the table.Jurgielewicz Duck {Laap-Peht}: this was definitely not what I was expecting, but the duck was cooked to perfection. The greens were delicious. The flavors I was expecting were spot on, it was just the execution that was different. I was expecting laap, if you know what that is...not salad with duck on top...the crispy bits were good. And I'd even go so far as to say, dip your duck meat into the bang bang sauce and try that deliciousness out.Coconut Rice Pudding - beware, served cold, which was a little unexpected for me, but super awesome delicious and currently being served with fresh nectarines to help cut the coconut sweetness and some sugared, crush nuts. This was pretty awesome.Finally, I'd love to get a great, big shout-out to Chef Phet (who made all our awesome food and only speaks a little bit of Laotion, yes, I'm calling you out) and Megan, the awesome manager. They both came to speak to me and Dorie and check on us. I can't forget our servers who were pretty awesome and were very attentive. They were great in giving instructions about how the food was typically eaten...mostly with your hands and not with utensils (sometimes that's just how you roll and it can get messy....but they give you hot towels before AND after your meal - AMAZING!).I'm definitely coming back and bringing my friends with me. Who wants to go?",13,6,12,Baramee C.,"Chicago, IL",774,662,677
