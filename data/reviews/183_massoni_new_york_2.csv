5.0,4/22/2019,"Masson is great- we have been a few times and it was delicious both times. A perfect place for a group to share and have multiple dishes. The Ceasar salad is AMAZING probably one of my favorite salads in New York City- perfect to share, we always end up ordering another one- so tasty! Pizza is delicious not a thin crust more like on top of a crispy focaccia, like a grandma type slice! The pepperoni is delicious and always the group favorite. There are multiple seating levels and it is pretty spacious. The cocktails are always on point. A good choice for a group dinner with quality pizza and starters!",0,0,1,Katherine K.,"Brooklyn, NY",152,94,161

4.0,4/15/2019,My boyfriend and I ate here while waiting for our real dinner at Take31 lol.We were starving and got a chicken parm pizza (Detroit style here) and a cocktail. The whiskey cocktail was tasty but a little weak. The pizza came out piping hot and crusty in the best way! It all worked together but felt they could have seasoned it more to give it that extra depth of flavor.I'd come here again because the service was kind and fantastic and the space is really chill. We ate at the bar and never felt rushed or crowded. 4.5 stars!,0,0,1,Nancy C.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",288,172,282
5.0,4/11/2019,"We visited Massoni on a weekday so I think we circumvented the weekend crowd as it is quite popular on yelp. The place was relatively empty that day. It's a part of the Arlo Nomad hotel and is located on the 1st floor. There is a separate lounge and a bar area to this restaurant. The dining area is really pretty with candle lit tables and red curtains. I read the reviews on yelp which suggested that their deep dish pies are very popular. So we got the mushroom pie which had mushrooms, French onion mascarpone and smoked mozzarella as toppings. I think it was pretty close to the Detroit style pizzas I've had back in Michigan. I loved the toppings and the pie crust! They were baked to perfection! There were some pastas I wanted to try but the pie was enough for a late dinner. I will be back to try out some of their special dishes and pasta. Ps: It's a great place for a date night :)",0,0,0,Ankita N.,"Farmington Hills, MI",84,51,98

When we walked in, we were the only ones, but by the time we left there were two other tables seated. We ordered the Massoni burger and the Breakfast Pizza. Both meals tasted fine, but they were super salty and greasy. If you do decide to dine here, I would maybe ask to have the cook to go easy on the salt/oil. I personally am not inclined to return to Massoni.",1,0,0,M C.,"Marlboro Township, NJ",0,20,9

4.0,12/10/2018,"Great restaurant in an unlikely secluded hotel location I've been going here on an almost weekly basis and haven't been disappointed. The cheese pie is excellent, it's a pan pizza sort of like Pizza Hut, but much better! The sauce is excellent and the ratio of cheese and sauce is always perfect. The four slice size is good for one person. The pasta dishes are also great, the paccheri is a favorite. The service is very good!",0,0,0,Joseph R.,"New York, NY",0,38,3
2.0,11/25/2018,"They say you shouldn't eat at an empty restaurant.  Good advice.  Went here on a Friday night at peak dinner time (6pm) and there was literally only one other table in a decent sized dining room.  And it's not like it is really that much off the beaten path.So we proceeded to dine at Massoni even though it was practically empty.  Service was fine, but since we were one of the only tables there should be no excuse for bad service.  Biggest complaint was the prices relative to the portion size/quality.  We all ordered the pasta dishes.  I realize this is mid-town Manhattan, but $19 for a dish of plain spaghetti & marinara sauce?  And it wasn't a huge portion by any means.  It certainly wasn't gourmet; pretty much basic boxed spaghetti with a plain sauce.  I ordered the ravioli and it was okay but again way overpriced at $29 and not very substantial.  Also there was no bread service provided for the table.With so many choices to eat in NYC, I would suggest passing on Massoni.  Unless you don't mind having to get a few New York slices of pizza after dinner since you might still be hungry and not really pleased with the overall experience.",1,1,0,James S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,5

4.0,10/29/2018,"Went to Massoni with a dear friend of mine and we sat right away! We went around 7pm on a Thursday and it was relatively active. We sat in an adorable corner seat where we could people watch and avoid people we may or may not have known from college. Our waiter Al was pretty cool and he found us funny so we liked him. Also because he was really nice. He told us how the specialty cocktails were included in happy hour... so we figured the regular cocktails would be as well.. but Al surprised us with the check and then told us they were not  This was kind of like when Buddy the elf found out Santa wasn't real. On a positive note, we ordered the prosciutto vodka pizza and it was AMAZING (almost as good as the company.. ALMOST). The ingredients were SUPA fresh and the crust was crispy cheese so I'd give it a 10/10... and I don't judge lightly. Here is a picture of my friend enjoying the pizza... clearly loving it.. a little too much (must be the tequila sodas). Would definitely recommend trying it out!",0,0,0,Ani D.,"Manasquan, NJ",329,1,3
3.0,10/7/2018,"Food wasn't bad but service was so so slow so three stars and probably won't be back- lots of other better Italian options in city. Favorites were the pepperoni pizza and bucatini. Loved the pizza in particular - marinara was just a tad sweet and the pepperoni and small pieces of jalapeño blended really well together. The crust was also so good. Definitely favorite dish of the night. Bucatini was tasty too - standard red sauce pasta dish. We also got the snap pea salad which was really refreshing. The lobster pappardelle however was mediocre (pasta itself was pretty good but wasn't impressed by sauce/flavor of dish - very bland, and there was hardly any lobster). Dessert options are lackluster (apple pie and sundae) so we didn't order any. Service like I said, was pretty sad/slow. Took so much effort to catch someone's attention to take our orders (20min of just chillin at the table...) and then food took forever to arrive. Our water was never proactively refilled and we had to ask multiple times to get a box for our leftovers and for the check. I also think number of waiters to tables isn't abnormal vs most dining locations in nyc so not sure why service was so slow/inattentive.",2,0,0,Jessica T.,"Manhattan, NY",279,214,551
4.0,10/4/2018,"This one now one of my favorite to eat in midtown/Murray hill area. Yesterday was looking for a Italian restaurant to eat before attending Game of Thrones live at MSG. Made reservations for  two about 530pm. As you walk to dining area you pass through the bar area. The dining area felt comfortable,  relaxing, and cozy. Our server Al was great. He was friendly and answered all our questions regarding appetizers. I read some reviews regarding picking garlic knots and meatballs. Wow! the appetizer was amazing.  Best garlic knot I ever eaten. Lightly sprinkled with parmesan cheese, the outside had an enjoyable crunchiness and inside was like soft pastry. It was great compliment with meatballs.  I also ordered the prosciutto with melon. What beautiful combination of flavors. Al the server recommended to apply the tagarashi oil to appetizer.  The Tagargashi seasoning added wonderful sweet, hot flavor to appetizer. Our entrees were the pacchierri with Italian chicken sausage and broccoli rave and spaghetti oomodoro with meatballs.  Both dishes were delicious, pacchieri had a nice light tasting creamy sauce. And the meatballs were delicious with spaghetti.     For dessert we had apple and pear pie with vanilla bean ice cream . Also amazing, Al recommended the pear pie, it was delicioso!. Pears were so tender, and spices and or seasonings took the pie to another level.  I certainly recommend a place to eat if your looking  a wonderful dinner, friendly service and great atmosphere.",0,0,0,Martin R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,3
5.0,9/22/2018,Andrew and I were here last night and we were invited upstairs for their annual seafood buffet. They served a carefully made seafood brasserie! The mussels are so fresh! The shrimps are huge! They are not overly salty or saucy like what other places usually do. It's a wonderful seafood buffet with all the fancy food! Their bread is superb as well. They served garlic bread and fried dough. Everything tastes so great. We had a bottle of sparkling wine along the way and finished with a sundae. The sundae was huge and I love the caramel and chocolate ice cream. The brownie at the bottom is completely dark! I don't like something that's too sweet and this seems to be the go to place!,2,0,1,Isabelle L.,"San Francisco Bay, CA",21,178,94

4.0,8/12/2018,"3.5 stars rounded up! Came for brunch on a rainy Saturday with 3 other friends and 2 Pulsd deals. Using these vouchers was very easy and we encountered no trouble. The restaurant was fairly empty on arrival, and stayed pretty quiet during our duration. Walls were decorated vibrantly and we were seated in large and comfortable booth. I ordered the carbonara while my friends ordered the bucatini and the eggs your way. I thought their version of carbonara was excellent, rich and creamy with a generous portion of pancetta mixed in. Serving size was fair. However I thought the bucatini, while tasty and spicy, seemed a little small. Drinks were pretty good, though I wish they came around a little more often. After we finished our breakfast, we were all a little hungry still so we got an order of their pepperoni pizza. Pizza is very similar to the colony squared at Emmy squared, in terms of flavor, but does not achieve the same crispy/airy/chewy crust . Nevertheless, I'd order it again! They were a stickler about time limits, which I don't find is the case in all time limited boozy brunches; still, massoni is a fine way to spend a rainy Saturday.",1,0,0,Danielle B.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,40,1
4.0,8/11/2018,"I was staying at the Arlo Nomad and the front desk worker said I should try the pizza at Massoni. Since I was in NY for 10 days I figured I'd give it a go. MEATBALLS AND GARLIC KNOTS - Such a great starter if you have a decent size group for dinner. Meatballs in a marinara and bread for sauce dipping. MASSONI CAESAR - Definitely a different take on caesar since nori is added. I had it multiple times while in NY. PEPPERONI PIZZA - Is a must because it's sicilian style, perfectly crispy crusts, and a little spice as well. This is definitely a restaurant worth checking out.

5.0,7/28/2018,We had a plan to spend sometime on top of the roof deck of the Arlo nomad hotel but the weather didn't cooperate.  So we ended going to eat downstairs at this cozy restaurant called Massoni.  This deep dish pizza was perfection.  The cherry and burrata were a perfect combination and the the crust was perfect!

1.0,7/27/2018,"This is a review of there MealPal lunch. I ordered the House Ricotta Sandwich and was so excited to pick it up as the photo on the site looks delicious! When I unwrapped the sandwich I was sorely disappointed off the bat. Firstly, it is only half a sandwich when it should have been a full. The sandwich should come with tomato, ricotta, balsamic vinegar and basil on a crunchy bread, there was no basil or balsamic vinegar, only one tomato slice and was on sesame bread. And the ricotta mixture was all over the sandwich, causing the bread to be soggy and very messy. I think for many MealPal is a way to try a restaurant or establishment, then they can confidently come another time. I will not ever be coming back here and will actively let others know the experience I had.",2,1,1,Kaitlyn K.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",45,90,91

1.0,7/15/2018,I was staying in the city and saw an advertisement for the '$31 on 31' bottomless brunch special so I made a reservation. When we arrived the menu said '$41 brunch'. I consulted the waitress and she said they recently changed the menu. When I pulled up the menu online it wasn't changed at all! Feels very much like false advertising / cat fishing. The manager would not alter the price to represent the price on the online menu. We walked out. It was a bummer because we were one of 4 other parties even eating at 12:30 on a Saturday.

3.0,6/20/2018,"My boyfriend and I were staying at the Arlo Nomad hotel and got into the city late (9pm) and exhausted. We decided to grab a bite to eat at Massoni strictly due to convenience since it's in the lobby of the hotel.We ordered the caesar salad and meatball sandwich. The salad came out promptly and was very tasty. It's a generous portion and had great flavor. It's topped with chopped seaweed which adds an extra layer of umami flavor. Delicious! Our waitress' shift ended midway through our meal and somehow in the handoff to the next waitress, our meatball sub got lost. Our new waitress didn't check on us for 20ish minutes and when she did, she was surprised to hear we didn't have the sandwich already. Apparently the first waitress told her we were taken care of. We eventually got the meatball sub and it was very good but certainly not worth waiting over an hour for. They comp'ed us the meatball sub due to the delay and mixup.

5.0,6/11/2018,"Upon entering the Arlo, there's a Massoni Bodega directly across from the concierge desk where they serve coffee, tea, and small bites. It's also the place where Chef Dale Talde has set up Dale's Ice C.R.E.A.M. Shop for the summer. I believe they serve ice cream from Oddfellows, but the real star of the show is the Shaved Ice Sundae ($14). There are two flavors currently available: Strawberry Rhubarb Pie and Tiramisu. It was too hot for something decadent and tiramisu-flavored so I opted for the strawberry rhubarb pie shaved ice. The ice is really frozen condensed milk, so it's light and sweet in flavor and doesn't rely on sugar syrups to sweeten it. The portion of shaved ice was very generous; I wish I had a friend with me to share it with. Topped with freeze-dried raspberries, a sprinkling of matcha powder and served alongside a slice of rhubarb pie dipped in white chocolate, it was the perfect treat to welcome the weekend with. I didn't have time to check out the more formal, sit-down table service at Massoni (which is behind the lobby) but if Massoni Bodega/Ice C.R.E.A.M. Shop is any indication of the creativity and quality of the food, I'll be sure to come back.",2,0,0,Michelle C.,"Brooklyn, NY",212,221,170

The service is just so slow. I think they must have one waitress for the entire restaurant. I love a bottomless brunch, but when service is so slow it doesn't feel quite like bottomless. Their sangria and margaritas are just not good and I LOVE when brunches add in drinks besides mimosas, but these are just not good. I'm embarrassed to talk this place up to my friends and then when we go the drinks are bad and we sit there forever without food or drinks.",1,1,0,Becca R.,"New York, NY",133,18,14
4.0,5/28/2018,"Really good food but not great service. Massoni is located in the first floor of the trendy Arlo Nomad Hotel. We came here for brunch and made a reservation ahead of time, though we didn't need it since there were some empty tables. The space itself isn't very large which is why it's even more confusing that service isn't good. After being seated for 10 minutes and no server stopping by, I asked someone to find our waitress. After our waitress stopped by, she didn't ask us if we had any questions on the menu or provide any recommendations. We both did the bottomless brunch because the price ends up being worth it if you have more than one drink. The mimosas came out and weren't overly sugary - they actually had a nice balance. Our food came out in piecemeal - the burger came out at least 10 minutes before the breakfast pizza entree. Thankfully we were splitting them but if we hadn't, one person would've fully finished eating before the other even got their food. The burger had some amazing aioli or sauce on it and was accompanied with waffle fries. We also got the breakfast pizza which I highly recommend trying. The chives and siriracha ketchup add a new level of flavor. We continued to order mimosas for the remaining time of our two hours - whenever we could call over the waitress since she never really stopped by.

After being sat, it took 15 minutes for someone to finally approach us for a drink order - and that was AFTER we tried for flag someone down and were blatantly ignored each time, then went and asked if we had a waiter. When she did come, there was no apology for the delay or anything (we were also one of 4 tables in the place). After this, it took another 15 minutes to get our drinks - and mind you we were paying for bottomless... the food came fairly quickly, and I have to say it was the saving grace - food is amazing!!

2.0,5/3/2018,"I don't expect Massoni to be around much longer, and that's both disappointing and deserved.First ate here for brunch in January 2017; food was fine, space was a bit coffin-like with no windows, and it was empty.  I chalked up the last part to it being fairly new, and not prime brunch season.Returned on a Thursday afternoon in May 2018 for lunch; space was still coffin-like, it was still completely empty, but this time, the service was the real issue.  The hostess gave us the wrong menus -- hardly an annoyance, but it allowed me to notice they charge $1 more for the exact same Meatball Sandwich when it's ""lunch"" rather than ""brunch"".My friend ordered a chicken sandwich with no cheese.  When it came out -- again, we were the only two people there -- it had cheese.  The waitress was apologetic and ran back to the kitchen.Five minutes later the sandwich came back out, and yup, you guessed it, they had just put the exact chicken on new bread, so there were still remnants of cheese.She apologized once more and comped it for us, but man, that sort of behavior gets you a 2 Star review, and lunch crowds that could be counted with your elbows.Stick with The Smith, L&W Oyster, Tacombi, etc for casual lunches in the neighborhood.",4,4,2,Tom E.,"Manhattan, NY",6,47,1
4.0,4/29/2018,Came here for bottomless brunch. Pros:The pies are great- especially the breakfast pizza. Very flavorful and thick cheesy crust (if you like carbs) Best comfort food for a Sunday morning!Drinks are good. You get unlimited mimosa/bloody Mary/Magarita/sangria. They are REAL cocktails that are not sugary like some other brunch places. Cons:Service is not desirable. We were done with drinks and water but nobody came by for our orders or refill our water until we had to actively wave at a server when he was taking orders from the next table. Servers in general didn't really bother checking in at guests besides taking orders. The place is small and loud. There is no music but somehow the sound all trapped in the small space making it difficult to talk. Overall:Good experience? YesComing back?

The beef cannoli was the best dish we had, though the raw beef looked like it wasn't very fresh. The lasagna was sweet in an undesirable way.

Seeing that this is Manhattan, a reservation is required on a day like today. I then called the restaurant on Thursday (February 8, 2018) to ask whether they would take a Pulsd deal. They said yes and therefore I bought the deal. Over the phone, I asked a few times if they really would because I was happy doing ala carte and understood since it was Valentine's Day. They reconfirmed saying no, we will take the deal just show the QR code to your server. Cut to 8:43pm on Valentine's Day. My husband and I are on our way to the restaurant and I get a call.

When the hostess walked out and up the stairs to the upstairs dining room I knew we were in trouble. The upstairs dining room turned out to be a covered patio with a leak running down the wall on the side of our table. The ""just okay"" food was served lukewarm. I had the rigatoni with short rib and Szechuan chili oil, it was one of the most boring pastas I've had. The meat balls appetizer was great, I wish I could say the same for the rice balls and the shishito peppers. We felt as if they didn't actually have a dedicated server for the upper floor and the person who took our order perhaps was covering a large section, or maybe just didn't care.

3.0,2/3/2018,"Came here for brunch on a Pulsd deal, 2 people 2hr boozy bunch for $39 so pretty awesome deal. Cocktails available were: Bloody Mary, margarita, mimosa, and sangria.Bloody Mary had one heck of a kick and the margaritas were so so (definitely an under pour). Drinks came out pretty slowly but the staff was good about getting our follow ups when we were near finished. As for the mimosas they don't give you the Pitcher but they gave a healthy pour.As for the food we did the brunch pizza which included a fried over easy egg and bacon bits (definitely recommend at least one person gets this). Additionally we got the mushroom polenta which also had poached eggs on top. The polenta was a creamy consistency with the mushrooms being chunky. Nothing amazing about the dish (especially for the true polenta fans) but nonetheless it was enjoyable and ended up being better than we thought.The other couple we were with got the smoked salmon toast and a pasta dish. I'm not personally a fan but the smoked salmon was supposedly really good and definitely a good serving size.All in, the dining area was kind of small/low-key and given the slower during service it would be hard to take advantage of the boozy brunch. However, given the rooftop is also awesome I would recommend going there over the spring or summer when it opens, and doing a boozy brunch / rooftop drinks combo.Rich and Sophie",0,0,0,Richard J.,"Manhattan, NY",157,24,35

4.0,1/15/2018,"I have been to Massoni a few times now, but realized that I had never completed my review, so I am going to stray from my normal format and just cut right to the positives and negatives of my comprehensive experience:Atmosphere:  Massoni is located within the Arlo NoMad hotel.  The lobby has a really artsy feel, with its lofted ceiling and brightly-colored paintings covering the walls. If you walk through this upbeat and airy space, you will find yourself at Massoni's dimly-lit bar and lounge, which tends to be completely packed with a well-dressed, after-work crowd.  The main dining room sits just beyond that, and one of its brick walls is covered with a sprawling mural with one of the three kings, referenced in the name of Chef Dale Talde's restaurant group.  The space really speaks to the creative mindset of the chef with its artsy décor, rebellious rock n' roll soundtrack, and cuisine mash-ups like the biriyani rice balls.Service: On each visit, I left thinking my service was adequate, in that we received everything in a timely manner, but it was nothing memorable.Drinks: The restaurant's wine list is exclusively Italian, but the cocktails were less ethnically-focused.  On my first visit, I enjoyed one of my favorite wines - a Falanghina, this one being the 2014 Fuedi di San Gregorio.  This white varietal has so many various renditions, but this version was very well-balanced.  My recently, I also tried the Forest Hills cocktail, which was a gardenlike blend of rosemary-infused Ford's Gin, lemon, Thai basil, and honey. The highlight in the beverage department is their half-price happy hour until 7 pm.Food: --Starters:1.) Meatballs & Garlic Knots: On two of the three visits, the meatballs were accompanied by large, doughy, pillow-like rolls covered with the perfect amount of garlic oil, but on the other trip, the knots were more like crispy, deep-fried pitas.  We were not sure if they were testing a different style, but we were not amused.  The meatballs and sauce were consistently delicious, though.  The meatballs were airy and not overly dense; and the sauce was well-seasoned and chunky.2.) Biriyani Rice Balls: Though these looked like typical, Italian arancini, the crispy spheres were infused with Indian seasoning and served over a spicy tomato sauce.  They were creative and tasty.3.) Roasted Beet & Burrata: This refreshing salad included red beets, pistachios, mint, and a healthy glop of burrata, topped with a pomegranate agrodolce.  It appears that burrata tends to be on the menu at all times, though its accompaniments change seasonally.--Pizza:1.) Charred Brussels Sprout: Like all Massoni pies, this was a deep-dish, rectangular pizza with a crispy bottom.  The brussels could have used more direct seasoning, such as garlic or pepper, leaving the pistachio pesto and ricotta salata to assume the responsibility of infusing the flavor.  Thankfully, they were able to elevate the pie with the extra herbs.--Pasta:1.) Squid Ink Pappardelle with Crab alla Vodka:  The black ribbons were perfectly cooked and topped with a slightly creamy vodka sauce infused with chunks of fresh crab meat.  It was sprinkled with bread crumbs for texture, but was a bit bland in flavor.2.) Rigatoni: This pasta was topped with a hearty, chunky braised short rib sauce, whipped ricotta, and Szechuan chili oil.  The spice and quality of the meat gave it a real ""wow"" factor.3.) Mushroom ""Lasagna"": This untraditional layering of mushrooms and cheese was delicious.  A rich, mushroom jus was used in place of a standard marinara sauce, and brussel sprout leaves were added to emphasize the woodsy, foraged flavor.--Entrees:1) Whole Steamed Orata: The fish was an impressive size and perfectly cooked.  It was topped with a hot olive oil soy sauce, as well as marcona almonds and a caper-ginger relish, making for an usual Asian-Italian blend.  NOTE: You do not go to Massoni for the entrees!  Stick with pizza or pasta; they are the highlight.While Massoni has some of Chef Talde's cultural influences, it is very satisfying to see him successful execute Italian flavors as well.  Massoni offers light-hearted cuisine in an imaginative space, making it great for dates or entertaining nights out with friends.",2,0,2,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640
5.0,1/14/2018,"I came here on a Thursday night with my boyfriend and had to leave a review because of how accommodating they were!We came during Christmas party season so it was a little busy when we got there but quieted down a bit later. I am vegan and was pleased to see a few options on the menu but I always ask the servers if they have anything they can make without cheese/butter.It can be very frustrating to go to a nice restaurant and the staff has no idea what options are vegan or can easily be made vegan. Our server was incredibly knowledgeable on the entire menu, knew exactly what substitutions could be made in various dishes, and even offered to check with the chef if he could make a dish for me. I was really blown away by the offer, as I'm used to just having to pick a side dish or a salad on menus at nicer restaurants. They typically pre-prepare the pizzas on busy nights, but since it wasn't too busy they offered to make me a cheeseless pizza loaded with veggies. It was incredible!!!

They weren't bad.For the entrees, I got the Breakfast Pizza (bacon, cheese, sunny side up egg, and a side of sriracha ketchup) and he got the Pasta Carbonara (pancetta, poached egg, and crispy kale). Both started out pretty good. The sriracha ketchup gave the pizza a nice tangy kick, and the pasta was perfectly cooked. After about halfway through, it became a bit overwhelming.

We were seated at the ends of one of the long dinner tables (last supper style table) and was a bit confused why we were the only two so far but decided it wasn't irrelevant since we came for prime ribs! First was the drinks, which was house win, margarita or beer. We had the house wine. Second came the pizza. It was amazingly cheesy and tender. Finally came the main focus, the prime ribs! First 2 slices were pretty juicy albeit warm instead of hot. The server came back to give us seconds but after that, he stopped coming to us. We had to personally ask him for more.

3.0,12/21/2017,"I had such high hopes for this place.  I absolutely loved Talde in JC and had been looking forward to trying Massoni.  After making the reservation for Massoni, I happened upon a Travelzoo deal that provided $100 worth of credit for only $59.  How fortuitous, I thought, I would be able to get good food for a fraction of the price.  Unfortunately, that was not the case, we ended up with average to below-average food, which made me glad that we didn't have to pay the full price. Let's get into the nitty gritty of the meal, we tried:Steak Tartare + Pistachio Cannoli - I normally love steak tartare, and usually order it whenever I see it on the menu.  However, this one was a huge let down.  The notion of stuffing steak tartare inside a cannoli is interesting, but tartare should be served cold.  In this case, the tartare was lukewarm, greasy and slimy, not a winning combination.  I don't think cannoli was a good vehicle for the tartare.Mushroom Pizza - in my opinion, this was the only good dish of the meal.  The pizza was deep dish style with perfectly crunchy crust, the mushrooms were beautifully flavored, and the mascarpone provided just the right amount of creaminess.Brick Chicken - the chicken pieces were unevenly coated.  I was hit with a nice burst of spices on my first bite, all of which disappeared thereafter.  The result was a super bland chicken with over-charred and over-cooked mustard greens.Sundae - this was recommended by our server, and was plopped down on our table without any explanation as to the flavors of the three ice cream scoops.  It was ok, I only liked one of the three flavors, which I think is salted caramel.  I hated the whipped cream on top, I thought it was grainy and the cinnamon flavor was overpowering the ice cream.The service was terrible.  Our waiter disappeared throughout most of the service, we had to ask twice for the dessert menu when our server finally appear to give us the desserts verbally.  The restaurant was fairly loud and I had a hard time hearing the choices.  When I asked him to repeat it, he seemed annoyed at my request.  We didn't finish the tartare, and when the person removing the plate pointed out that we still had a piece left, we smiled and said we did not want to eat more of this dish.  There was no follow up questions, not once were we asked if everything was ok.  However, I do have to point out that our water was always filled promptly and our water never dipped below midway point.  Also, even though we informed them of our Travelzoo voucher prior to ordering, they forgot to apply the credit.  When we informed them of the mistake, the waived the whole bill, which was slightly above $100.  I really appreciate their effort to rectify the initial mistake.Overall, Massoni is a beautifully decorated restaurant.  I think it would be a fun place to stop in for a drink, or maybe even a snack (stick to the pizza), but I don't think I would be back for a full meal.",3,1,1,Kat J.,"Jersey City, NJ",137,196,1246

The hostess forgot about us when she first told us they were running 5 min late for our table and then asked that we step aside towards the lobby. when i came back 20 min later to ask about the table, said ""oh you are ready now?"" She then proceeded to squeeze us into a low top 4 top between two large parties at high top tables, while two booths sat empty the whole meal a few feet away. Very weird. When asked which pizza would be best to share, our waitress replied ""they are all really good, just depends on your preference."" Then deadpan silence for 60 seconds while we chose one. That was the last we saw of her until the half hearted obligatory desert question followed quickly by the check. The food itself is decent, but tiny portions and overpriced. Appetizer sized pizzas run close to $20, and small portions of pasta run about $25. Drinks run $12-14, but mine was syrupy sweet.

The pizza also had a sweet honey sauce on it when I finally got it. The menu needs to identify that- it was honey which is not vegan. I don't think we will be coming back.

This was unlimited, and there was also the option of white wine, house beer, or house margarita. First appetizer was a cheese pizza, which was thick sliced and delicious. I could've eaten the whole thing if I hadn't tried to save room for the prime rib. The prime rib plate came next, with 2 good slices of prime rib, 2 garlic knots, and potatoes. The prime rib was tender and juicy, though slightly cold. The garlic knot was like a greasy oily garlicky donut, so delicious but extremely unhealthy. The chef came around with platters of more food, we got a few refills of the prime rib. However, after we'd had about 2 extra plates of the prime rib they stopped coming around to us, and when we asked for more they would eventually come back around and give us just one piece. Lastly, the Apple pie was good but also kind of cold, the crust was especially sweetOverall, it was worth the price but I probably would not come back. Can only eat so much cold prime rib.

5.0,12/6/2017,"I had such a good experience at Massoni. Definitely needed to rave here. I only heard about this restaurant from a Pusld deal. I came here with a friend with using the deal ($69) covering 2 appetizer, 2 entrée, 2 dessert or drinks, and 2 coffee or tea. First of all, the service was exceptional. Our server was such a sweet girl and gave us great recommendations on food and wine.Food-wise: we ordered the steak tartare + pistachio cannoli, fritto misto (calamari) for appetizer, shrimp fettucine and rigatoni for entrée. Opt out of coffee and tea.Everything was pretty delicious. The only comment was that the fettucine was little salty, but there was plenty of shrimp. In lieu of dessert, which they only had pies, we ordered 2 drinks.Ambience-wise, it's very cozy. I really like the Christmas decoration. My favorite part was the furry chairs. My friend and I migrated to the center of the room with drinks after we paid. Needless to say that this is a hotel restaurant and many of the patron are also hotel guest. The overall feel was great. I would love to come back for a birthday event. They had private rooms for large party with great interior upstairs. The restaurant also had seating both downstairs and upstairs.",1,0,0,Cher M.,"New York, NY",0,8,3
4.0,12/5/2017,"Another successful Puls'd brunch deal. $39 for two entree's and 2 hours bottomless bloody mary, sangria, mimosa or margaritas for 2 people. Winning.The restaurant itself is really nice (it's inside The Arlo Hotel). Very cool artwork on the walls and funky lighting all over the place. It was busy when we came in at 2pm on Sunday but was virtually empty by the time we left at 4pm. I'd been eyeing up the pie's on Yelp earlier in that day so I already knew what I was going to be having - the brussel sprout, pistachio and ricotta pie. It's not a combination seen often, and i'm a big sprouts fan! And to my delight, it was as good as it tasted! Very creamy, but also kinda sweet.  It's quite a thick pie and made a nice difference to the classic, thin slice most places do in NYC. Drinks were also pretty good (and by good I mean strong), but the white sangria did taste a bit watery. Would def recommend as the pizza pies are pretty damn good. Obviously, the Puls'd deal is great to have but as a side note, without this brunch is $33 which isn't too bad for two hours of boozing in NYC",4,0,1,Taylor A.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",106,134,141

4.0,11/15/2017,"This is really a hidden gem, tucked inside the Arlo Nomad Hotel.  They're on OPT so it's easy to make a ressie.  Came here with my bestie on a Tuesday evening around 730. It was pretty busy. They have a small ish dining room downstairs and cozy bar/lounge area.  It seems as though they had more dining usptairs but it might be for private or larger parties.  In the normal dining room, it's really most comfortable for 2 or 4-5. Space is a bit tight and in winter, expect them to make you check your coats, lol. As far as the food. This is a reasonably priced and yummy, fusion-esque Italian spot. Fusion esque because it's a Dale Talde place and there's always an Asian twang in his food.  Drinks (wine, cocktails) looked good even though we didn't feel like drinking yesterday. We had: - Garlic knots and meatballs. Amazingly, flavorful rich tomato sauce and meaty meatballs.  Yummy knots that were soft and buttery on the inside but had a pretty toasted shell. $15.-The pepperoni, peppers, and honey pizza again with amazing tomato sauce.  I'm a sucker for this pizza flavor combo. Note that while the pizzas look small ($15 ish each), they are THICK pan pizza style slices. Almost like a Detriot style pizza with crispy edges and oily dough. We each had two slices, cut in squares. The texture and flavors were very good.  If I were to come back, I'd have the mushroom white pie. Overall very rich. -We shared the rigatoni which had really good short rib and some kind of cheese or cream accent. It came with chili oil which they put on the side for us.  It was good. I would also like to try the spaghetti and meatballs, and the shrimp fettuccine which looked really good. The pastas were in the low to mid $20s which is standard for NYC.We were pretty stuffed with sharing the above, and it was about $40 pp after tip, tax, etc.  I'd definitely come back to try other things and just hang out.

The food was good but the wait staff was severely understaffed, which made drinks far and few between. There were eight of us, so I know we weren't the easiest table, but it took over 45 minutes after being seat to receive a drink, which I find difficult to swallow, even if they are understaffed. At the end of the meal, they brought out a ice cream sundae for the birthday girl (which was very sweet). The problem was that we had only been drinking for about an hour and 15 minutes and they stopped bringing drinks. Two waiters told us they were making us a round and we left an hour later without drinks. I would say this is a good place for brunch if you're trying to go get a decent meal and have 2-4 drinks.

The restaurant is fairly small and is located inside the Argo NOMAD so I would recommend making a reservation before coming. We were able to order 2 apps, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts (or 2 drinks) with our voucher. We opted to get drinks on the happy hour special and get desserts.  Great happy hour! Half off selected wines and cocktails and beers.We started with the buratta and the rice ball appetizers. they came out incredibly fast! The rice balls were absolutely amazing. The flavor of them was rich and cheesy and wonderful and they paired beautifully with the sauce that came with it. The buratta was just incredible. It was really high quality and fresh and the grapes that came with it were an outstanding touch.We got the Detroit style cheese pizza and the pumpkin ravioli which we shared with each other. The cheese pizza was absolutely perfect and delicious and amazing. True to Detroit style, the crust was thick and crispy and cheesey. We loved it. The pumpkin ravioli was just so delicious. The brown butter with crispy sage was PERFECT with it and the hazelnuts were a great touch. The hint of netmnug really did it for us. We loved all our dishes.Now for dessert: we ordered the sundae and the snickers cannolis. Dale Talde is known for making unique desserts in his restaurants, however (in my opinion) they just aren't executed well. At Talde, I felt the same way. He takes a very grand idea for dessert but then it just doesn't perform. The sundae was fine but nothing special. The ice cream didn't have a ton of flavor. The cannoli, however, had way too much flavor and truly not ina good way. We couldn't finish either. The atmosphere here is relaxed and laid back and the service is outstanding.

Then, she finally came over, we put in an order for food (2 entrees) and drinks.  The drinks never came. We had to ask a different staff member to bring over our drinks.  Then about 20 minutes later the food finally came- except one thing: the waitress must have been pissed off or something, very petty, she never put in my order; so my boyfriends food came but mine did not.  A different waitress brought out my boyfriends food and she said ""did you not order anything?"" and I clarified that I had, and about 15 minutes later, my food finally came.  She also got us our drinks.  But the first waitress who took our order, never came back, and obviously was very petty.  Because of her, I give this place 1 star.

After a Thursday night happy hour, I was looking for a quick bite, and stumbled upon massoni, which I had been meaning to try. I walked in to inquire as to where I could order just a slice and I was directed to ""bodega"" which is basically a hotel coffee bar with a few slices of pizza. The options were very limited. There was a cheese / grandma pie or a cheese and heirloomTomato pie. I was told I would have to Wait 20Minutes for a pepperoni slice. So, I opted for the standard cheese square slice. It was half cold and $9 for one slice and a soda. Far from a bargain. Especially for the quality. Dale Talde needs to check his ego. His quality has gone severely down hill since his staple, Talde in Park Slope opened, which I have visited at least 5 times.  I also visited his Miami Beach restaurant late spring 2017, and was very disappointed.  It's quite apparent he has sacrificed quality for quantity.

The food, drinks, ambience & service are all super top notch. The longer: I made an 8:30 pm reservation and we got there around 8. It was crowded (so definitely make a reservation if you can!), so we grabbed a seat at the bar and ordered some drinks. Their infused gin is homemade and awesome. We also tasted the mushroom pizza at the bar. It was savory, sweet (from the mascarpone) and tangy (from the onion jam). Then, we sat down and had the kale salad, pappardelle and the fish. The food here is just crazy good. The pasta was perfectly al dente, the sauces and flavors are blend together perfectly, and the food is really unlike anything I've ever had before. For dessert we shared the ice cream sundae. It was piled high with whipped cream, chocolate drizzle and brownies. It was amazing. We sat for dinner for a really long time.

So far I've had the kale salad which sounds great and flavorful but is not really, instead flat and uninspiring. The the octopus pasta w breadcrumbs that I had to sadly send back, the rice balls which were highly recommended were just fine and wouldn't order them again and the bucatini that is really good but way too spicy and apparently there's no way to make it without chilies.

3.0,4/7/2017,"Had a pleasant dinner here with a friend after work.  Chef Dale Talde is doing a nice job on the food, as all of the dishes we had were tasty and well prepared.  Stopping a bit short of giving Massoni top reviews primarily due to service polish and environment.The space is tucked behind the lobby of the Arlo Hotel in a windowless interior area with exposed brick wall, wood floors and very basic tables/chairs.  It's a simplistic design that is neither warm nor overly inviting, and at times seems like it was trying to hard with diversions to overcome the less than optimal space (i.e. trying to create cool factor to compensate).  Two top tables along the walls were spaced quite close together.In terms of food, I enjoyed the Biryani Rice Balls which had a very interesting Indian twist on a classic Italian Arancini.  The Meat + Cheese board was also enjoyable with classics such as salami, prosciutto and humbolt fog along with a few small, house made accompaniments - a safe choice to start.  Pizzas are Detroit style, having a semi-deep dish crust in a square shape (four slices).  The Spicy Sausage with Peppers and Onions was delicious and who could hate the ranch dressing that comes alongside.  Charred Brussel Sprout with Pistachio Pesto was also good.  Bucatini with bacon, marinara and chilis was flavorful, but sadly I found the pasta to be undercooked (biggest food flaw).  Brick Chicken with Calabrian Chili Spiced Yoghurt was moist and tasted nice.  The Snickers Cannoli, which comes with three, was a good conclusion.  Interestingly, this and an ice cream sundae are the only dessert options.Tried two cocktails off the menu; as the menu is not posted online, I cannot fully quote them.  However, I remember preferring the Forrest Hills which was gin based.  One nit was the consistency of how it was made (had a few), and they ranged from excellent to overly bitter.It seemed as though staff really had not been through much training in terms of how to handle patrons and the operation.  First of all, when we arrived, nearly every table was occupied around the walls of the restaurant (two tops), but literally the entire set of tables in the middle of the room was vacant (two and four tops). Beyond this, our waitress and other staff, while very nice and pleasant were not the most polished.  Ready to take our order right away, could not concisely walk through the menu/concept, had to come back after taking the order to ask about allergies, and really just overall demeanor.Overall, I liked the food at Massoni, but the atmosphere and service did leave something to be desired.

This is on the ground floor of the Arlo Hotel. I went there for lunch. The menu didn't excite me, but I chose the Avocado sandwich. I really like my avocado bread, this should be even better. There was way too much acid in the avocado or the salad that was in the sandwich. I know I don't like the sandwich that much, when I'm searching for the cherry tomato (which by the way was kept whole. odd). The plating.. um. awful. This is not restaurant quality.

From the currency and newspaper mache walls to the floral embroidered lamp shade interiors...details, details, details. Now enough with my decor love letter to Massoni. My +1 and I came for brunch pre-12pm and the space was pretty empty (the crowd started rolling in ~1pm). We ordered a few drinks, the breakfast pizza, and the carbonara. What's better than bacon in pasta? Pancetta. The carbonara was very rich and creamy but in no way overbearing. It was heavy, but in a satiated, I've-had-a-long-week-and-it's-the-weekend-so-it's-okay kind of way. I barely noticed the kale so I guess that's a good way to trick adults (and kids) who are anti-kale or aren't a fan of greens! We were a bit disappointed with the breakfast pizza.

To start we have the calamari and rice balls. Both amazing dishes! There was something about the calamari dish that made it different and far better than any other I have had. All the pizzas on the menu are interesting combinations, some being extremely decadent. We went with the charred brussel sprout pistachio pesto ricotta pizza and the pepperoni picked pepper honey pizza (a more simple one). Both were great but the charred brussel sprout one was unreal! For a pasta we shared the bucatini which was served very hot and fresh! I was hoping it would have a tiny bit more flavour but I would still order it again and recommend it. And finally for dessert we shared the sundae which was amazing (although we were so full). The style of pies at Massoni is pretty similar to that of Emmy Squared, so if you like those you'll be happy with these pies.

Dinner for one included a glass of valpociello, their beets appetizer and bucatini pasta. It was a delicious meal, the beets refreshing and nicely complimented with the burrata and nuts while the bucatini had a little kick that made a simple dish interesting and made you want to lick up every bit of the sauce. Kudos to the (she) bartender who did a great job tending to a busy bar that evening. As busy as she was, she still checked in with me every now and then to make sure all was good. (I can't say the same for the hostess who checked if everything was ok once I received my main dish, offered to grab me a spoon for my pasta and then forgot about me, someone who was sitting less than 1 feet from her.

4.0,3/13/2017,"I understand that there are several dining options in the Arlo and this review is just for dinner at the sit-down Massoni restaurant off of the lobby. I had a holiday dinner here with my work team and we all walked away really full and really happy. The first brownie point was how we ended up here in the first place. I had previously made a reservation at another spot close by, but when I called to confirm the day before they somehow completely lost any record of it and told me that they were now full for dinner. Panicked, I had a coworker call Massoni and they were kindly able to fit us in for an early dinner on a Wednesday night. The space is tiny but our group of eight was able to sit comfortably at one of their long hightop tables. One not-so-fun part of the experience was before we ordered and started eating. Our server was super nice, informative, and helpful, but maybe too much so. I'll explain. After we told her that only one of us had eaten here before, she proceeded to read literally every single item on the menu to us and describe every single dish. Not just her favorites, or the ones we asked about - every single one! It took forever and we were hungry and anyway we pretty much knew what we wanted to order so we all got super antsy and honestly stopped listening halfway through. But other than that small hiccup, the rest of the experience was enjoyable and the food was very tasty. We requested extra fried grapes with the fritto misto and they brought out some small bowls of it for us (if you've never tried a fried grape you haven't lived). On top of those fun little guys we also loved the biryani rice balls, the beef tartare cannoli, and the twist on the classic Caesar salad for starters. For entrees, some standouts for me included the bucatini, the whole steamed orata, and many of the pizzas. As they explained to us (in depth), it's not your typical classic Italian dishes but there are even some Asian flavors in there (as with the biryani rice balls and the soy sauce on the fish). Honestly, there really wasn't a dud in the whole meal. For dessert we got the snickers cannoli and honestly I probably could have skipped that considering how stuffed we were from the rest of the meal. But overall we walked away stuffed and happy and I would totally recommend this to anyone else looking for a higher end, creative meal!",13,4,14,Christina P.,"Culver City, CA",4723,2090,4060

2.0,3/4/2017,I have yet to be impressed by a meal prepared by a Top Chef alumni or one of the recurring judges. Unfortunately Dale Talde's newest restaurant doesn't change my opinion. I am not sure why it is marketed as an Asian Italian fusion restaurant. Looking at the menu there were just a few items that could pass for fusion food. We ordered other items that looked more interesting. Bad call. We started with the steak tartare pistachio cannelloni. It was a creative dish sadly the meat was under seasoned.

3.0,2/22/2017,"KenScale: 7.5/10More often than not, I derive more satisfaction from food that sticks to the culinary tradition and influence faithfully, partly because it is not as easy as it sounds to pull off ""fusion""-style food that attempts to disrupt the existing paradigms. Chef Dale Talde has seemingly done a very nice job with his ""inauthentic Asian"" style dishes although I have yet to visit his eponymous restaurant in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn. When his team decided to expand their horizon to the realm of Italian cuisine at a brand new midtown hotel in Manhattan, I was somewhat skeptical but still wanted to give it a shot given my love for Italian food. As my trip to Italy last year showed, Italian food is often done best when it stays simple. Will chef Talde's latest project make me think there are smart ways to make some playful tweaks to this cuisine? My experience on recent weekend dinner had too many misses to convince me otherwise.The menu at Massoni consists of a variety of starters, pastas, pizzas and larger dishes. My girlfriend and I met up with another couple at Massoni, so that we had an opportunity to try a bunch. I immediately saw from some of the dishes' plating that the kitchen seems to have a lot of creative ideas. For instance, beef tartare inside pistachio cannoli was done quite cleverly and I really enjoyed the nice texture of the raw beef that combined with the sensation of pistachio for delightful bites. On the other hand, consistency was a significant issue for some dishes. Biryani rice balls and spicy tomato sauce to form a fusion take on arancini was serviceable, but the fritto misto of calamari, grapes, lemon and pastrami spiced aioli had such overwhelmingly strong seasoning that I had to give up after a couple of bites. The inconsistency was even more prominent in pasta and pizza sections. I actually quite enjoyed both pastas we had ordered. Squid ink pappardelle with crab alla vodka was the best dish of the night with very rich but not overly heavy flavor, and the spaghetti with meatballs also had a hearty feel to it. On the other hand, both pizzas we had ordered were major disappointments. The flavor of the pie with spicy sausage, peppers and onions with side ranch on the side somehow didn't add up, and despite the promising outlook, the charred Brussels sprouts pizza with pistachio pesto and ricotta salata was simply overcooked to the point where it was hard to proceed after a couple of bites. Even the desserts were a mixed bunch. I actually liked the sundae quite a lot (although my sweet tooth girlfriend didn't quite approve), but snickers cannoli, despite the playful attempt at molding snickers ice cream into cannoli form, didn't have the punch it needed. Overall, this was a meal where I couldn't find strong points; I liked the novelty of some dishes, but the execution throughout seemed to be lacking with a singular focus.Getting a reservation wasn't too difficult, although the dining space was nearly packed with young and handsome crowds during our meal. There is full bar with Italian-centric wine selections to complement your meal. The dining space has a weirdly hip vibe inside the hotel where it was hard to find what type of audience the restaurant was really targeting. Massoni was by no means a bad place, but as someone who deeply respects the beauty of simplicity in Italian cuisine, I couldn't say I was a fan of a somewhat halfhearted attempt at playing with the food from this beautiful country, and not necessarily in the most satisfying way.",5,0,2,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

5.0,2/16/2017,"Surprised my boyfriend with a stay at the Arlo Nomad for Valentine's Day. In the hotel is a restaurant called Massoni, a Three Kings Restaurant Group establishment. Food: From the restaurant's ""Italian-ish"" menu with Asian notes, we tried three items: the biriyani rice balls, the charred brussels sprout, pistachio pesto, ricotta salata pie, and the squid ink pappardella with crab. The rice balls were delicious and my favorite item of the night. Crisp on the outside, moist and soft inside. I had no idea what biriyani was before, but I'm so happy I tried this. The pizza has great texture; I've always been a fan of brussel sprouts and even more so on top of a pizza. The cheese and pistachio were a great combination. The pasta was good; pasta was al dente and there was a good amount of crab.  Drinks: My boyfriend doesn't drink, but I had an opportunity to try one of their signature cocktails: the Franklin. I am a sucker for white peach anything, and when I saw it on the menu, I had to have it. I'm glad I did because it was perfect. Though I can't recall what was in it, it was delicious. Service: Service was excellent. Pleasant greeting at the door and quick to find my reservation. Our waiter was knowledgeable and our glasses were always filled with water. Chef Dale Talde was even present checking up on some guests. Finals Thoughts: I can't wait to come back to try other items on their menu.

4.0,2/3/2017,"I've had so-so experiences at Dale Talde's earlier restaurants (Talde Park Slope, Pork Slope, Talde Jersey City...), so I initially hesitated when deciding whether or not to make a visit to Massoni. The restaurant is the latest collaboration between between Chef Talde, David Massoni, and John Bush (the trio are all partners in the Three Kings Restaurant Group), and features a similar concept of merging together Italian and Asian cuisine.Massoni, like many other new restaurants, is housed within a longstanding hotel - in this case, the Arlo NoMad. There isn't much by way of signage, so make your way past the hotel lobby to the curtained entrance on the left. The venue is split into a bar / lounge area and a separate dining room; the former is surprisingly small and was both crowded and loud, so I wouldn't recommend making an impromptu visit. Plan ahead and make reservations (if you can get them), as you'll want to have access to the entire menu. Dishes range from small plates, to pizza and pasta, as well as some heartier entrees; our server recommended we order dishes to share, and it's definitely the best way to sample the most options.We started off with the Biryani Rice Balls, which are one of the better takes on a fusion dish that I've to encounter. Each plate consists of 5 small arincini, cooked in the traditional Italian style but with basmati rice and a generous helping of Indian spices, and served with a cool ranch raita and spicy tomato sauce. It's initially a confusing set of tastes and textures, but the contrast of the creaminess of the arincini against the spicy sweetness in the tomato sauce works seamlessly.Worth noting as well are the pastas, which are made in house. We tried the Bucatini, which is served in a spicy marinara sauce with cubes of Nueske's Bacon and chilis; while the sauce wasn't particularly noteworthy, I did appreciate how the pasta was cooked to the perfect al dente. My preference lies with the pizza available at Massoni, which is cooked Detroit-style: a medium-thick crust that's charred and crispy at the edges, but has enough softness and chew in the center. We opted for the Sweet Fennel Sausage, which sprinkled chunks of fennel-infused sausage across a mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce pizza, and came with a side of ranch sauce in a miniature squeeze bottle. While my dining companion seemed to like the unconventional pairing more than I did, I enjoyed the pizza sans sauce; it was a delightful combination of textures and flavors and had just the right ratio of crust to sauce to toppings. Each pan consists of four square slices, so it's an ideal dish for sharing as well.As a whole, I'd say Massoni is off to a strong start. While it would have been nice to see more integrated elements of Asian and Italian cuisine across more than just a small handful of plates, the overall execution and delivery across the menu has been done surprisingly well.",16,5,15,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827
2.0,1/29/2017,"I was a bit disappointed in the two times I tried to get breakfast from here. On my recent stay at the Arlo Nomad I had decided to try breakfast from here. The first morning I ordered a breakfast sandwich and a latte. The breakfast sandwich was probably the worst I have ever had. The bacon was so fatty that I legit had to tear away the meat from the fatty parts, just so that I could recover something from this sandwich to hold me over til I could get some real food. The bread was almost as bad as some of the gluten free breads I have tried.. it was soggy, wet and crumbled apart as you picked up the ""sandwich."" They might want to try slicing open a bagel or delicious buttery croissant to replace that bread product they are currently using. When I opened up my ""sandwich"" nothing about what I found looked appealing. My latte was like hot milk and lacked a good strong coffee flavor. The next morning I went down and figured I would just take a totally different approach and ordered a small drop coffee and had inquired about the waffles that were sitting in front of me. I asked how they served them, if they warmed them and served them with syrup. The kid said yes so I placed my order. It came to $16 which seemed like a lot but I am in a different city so figured it is what it is. When I got to my room and opened the container the two waffle pieces were covered in sliced cinnamon apples and was served with a caramel sauce. I was not a fan and really just wanted regular syrup like I had inquired about. My coffee was delicious so maybe it's best to just stick to that.",7,2,1,Michael P.,"Providence, RI",1195,457,1606

3.0,1/26/2017,"This is a review just for the square pizza to go at the ""bodega"".Chic hotel lobby for an informal slice of pizza.

Inside the restaurant the menu offers several alluring pizza choices, but since it's the same method, I wanted to try the more affordable option before paying $17 for a pie. It was just ok. The dough didn't strike me as particularly tasty, nor did the tomato and the mozzarella. I understand that it was waiting on the counter for a while (and therefore should not be compared with the fresh-coming-out-of-the-oven option on their menu).

4.0,1/15/2017,"Great place for some gourmet pizza and ""Italianish"" food. It seems like a spot that you can easily get a reservation (early in the week at least) only a few days in advance. When I checked, there were plenty of reservations starting from 6pm and beyond. We made a reservation for 8 people on a Monday at 7:30pm. When I arrived, the restaurant was not crowded at all. The entrance is confusing, but you enter in what looks like a hotel. Massoni is through the doorway towards the top left corner of the lobby.Our waiter gave us some great recommendations:Appetizers:Biryani rice balls with spicy tomato sauce - I wouldn't say this tasted like biryani specifically. It did taste like an arancini ball with Indian flavors, which I enjoyed very much. They come with 5 to a plate. My whole group agreed this was a good appetizer to order.Pies:Charred brussels sprout, pistachio pesto, ricotta salata - This was my favorite pie we ordered. The flavors were more subtle and the pie wasn't too salty. The pie had a sweetness to it that I couldn't quite place, but I think it was the pistachio pesto. The brussel sprouts pie is a must order.Mushroom, french onion mascarpone, smoked mozzarella - Very rich with the french onion mascarpone, but I couldn't really taste much mushroom flavor. I preferred the brussel sprouts pie over this one.Pepperoni, pickled pepper, honey - You can't go wrong with pepperoni pizza. The honey wasn't very strong, but I could still taste the flavor of it.'nduja, peppers + onions, side ranch - Standard sausage, peppers, and onions pie. The sausages were tasty.Buffalo chicken, roth buttermilk blue cheese - The buffalo pie was my least favorite one. I thought it was a bit too salty, which overwhelmed the buffalo flavor.You can taste individual flavors of the pizza. I do like Emmy Squared better because they have a more buttery crust. The crust here was more crispy, but still very tasty. The pizzas are also smaller, but I think a better portion size for me. Unbeknownst to me, my friends actually set up a belated birthday surprise.

We started with the ceaser salad which came in a big portion and was good. For entrees we ordered one pepperoni pizza with no peppers and the spaghetti and meatballs. To be honest, I liked their take on Detroit style pizza better than Emmy Squared. The pizza was very similar to Emmy Squared but didn't taste as salty to us. My only wish was that the waiter could have accommodated our request to have the honey that came with the pizza on the side. Don't get me wrong, the honey was great but I wanted to be able to appreciate the sauce on it's own without every bite being sweet. The spaghetti with meatballs was classic, the paster was aldente and the meatballs were hearty. They aren't anything out of the ordinary so I suggest going for something more unusual that you can't get at every Italian place.

4.0,12/4/2016,"The new ""Italian-ish"" restaurant by Chef Talde. Decor-wise, it's pretty stunning - graffiti on the walls, pop art, that sort of thing. We started with the biriyani rice balls (5 per order), which are mini arancini with a hint of Indian spices. Familiar with a twist, ""italian-ish,"" tasty. The roasted beet and burrata was a step above standard, made more interesting with some hints of cumin and fresh mint. Now the pies. Lured by instagram pics comparing its awesomeness to that of Emmy Squared, we ordered 2 of their Detroit-style pies. The buffalo chicken with blue cheese was funky, gooey, dense, and definitely had a kick. The 'njuda with peppers and onions is a good take on a familiar sausage and pepper pie, and who doesn't love a little squeeze bottle of ranch on the side? Both pizzas were crisp on the edges, fluffy in the middle, and pretty good. However, they were also pretty greasy (as evidenced by my well-used napkin) and the flavors weren't as pronounced as they could've been. Emmy Squared definitely wins out on quality and taste, with a better even crust around the entire pie, and more thoughtful topping combos. Skip the squid ink pappardelle with crab, it was really underwhelming. Our side of mustard greens was also overly-vinegary. My favorite thing of the night? Our ice cream sundae dessert. Seriously, this was everything you want in a sundae. The ice cream is from Oddfellows (a scoop each of miso cherry, chocolate, and vanilla sprinkle), smothered in whipped cream, hot fudge, brownie pieces, and more sprinkles. And there is a layer of fudgey chocolate surprise waiting for you at the bottom of the dish. It's glorious, and perfect for splitting. The staff was really accommodating and friendly, and we saw Chef Talde and Mr Massoni himself making their rounds. Cocktails are good and strong, with a beautiful bar area in front. Hopefully they refine the menu a bit, but this is definitely a good restaurant option in the area.",2,0,2,Lillian Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",461,285,1300
5.0,12/1/2016,"So good, beer salad, mozzarella dish and mushroom pie pizza was so good. About to have the sundae now..can't wait. They play Old school music...Grand Puba tonight. Throwback! Nice pour of scotch. Ultra nice owner and staff. Cool bar area. Kind of disconnected dining room. Prefer bar to eat at.",2,0,1,Joe S.,"Manhattan, NY",52,150,493
5.0,11/25/2016,"Super-cool and artistic design inside the restaurant. Casual, hip, and fun. Zero pretension. Everything on the menu sounded good, but we were only 3 people so couldn't order everything. Started with the sausage pizza which was incredibly delicious, was like a combination of the original Chicago Uno/Due (not the chain) and a perfect slice of grandma's style. Also started with the Kale salad which was tasty and perfectly dressed. Then had spaghetti & meatballs where the pasta was beautifully firm and the meatballs were light and flavorful. Tagliatelle with crab was also wonderful along with the roast chicken. Fantastic cocktails and a well-priced interesting wine list. Fabulous spot, and the type of food one can eat once a week. Kudos.",0,0,0,Eric S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,40,0
5.0,11/23/2016,"The Three Kings Restaurant group hitting us with yet another great spot.For anyone who's lost, the restaurant is located inside of the Arlo Nomad hotel.The second I walked into Massoni, I was thoroughly impressed (more like jaw-dropped).  Dim lighting but various light fixtures to show off the amazing decor! FOOD- Biryani Rice Balls... who the heck thinks of this!? I love biryani, I love Rice Balls, but never thought I'd see them together; but it makes sense and tastes great!- 'Nduja Detroit-style Pie with peppers + onions, caciocavallo served with a mini squeeze bottle of ranch - the creaminess/tanginess of the ranch completes the pie so go wild!- Squid Ink Pappardelle w/ Crab alla Vodka sauce:  probably my least favorite of the night but great nonetheless.  Squid ink pappardelle was impressive but I wish there was more crab in there (could just be me being a fatass).- Apple Strudel/Pie sort of thing topped with vanilla ice cream:  simple-looking dessert but packs a lot of flavor.  Apples still had a nice crunch, the crust was still nice a flaky despite being doused in the salted caramel sauce, and the scoop of ice cream really finished it off.Service was phenomenal.  We were greeted and seated promptly.  We even got to meet 2 of the 3 Kings [Restaurant Group].  Our server offered great suggestions for food and he clearly had an extensive knowledge of the menu.  The busser/food-runner was amazing and friendly as well.Can't wait to be back here for more!",2,1,2,Glenn D.,"Woodside, NY",341,141,387
5.0,11/23/2016,"Three Kings Restaurant Group at it back again with another hit! Described as ""Italian-ish,"" this place has the typical Italian dishes (pizza, spaghetti and meatballs, arancini, etc.) and adds some Asian flare (biriyani for the rice balls, uni with the pasta, and so on). It's located on the first floor of the Arlo NoMad hotel. When you walk in, they have a ""bodega"" with slices, sandwiches, and coffee to go. Just past the staircase they have their bar/lounge area, and the entrance to the restaurant. We had the biriyani rice balls, 'nduja pizza, squid ink pappardelle with crab alla vodka, and the apple pie dessert. The biriyani rice balls definitely had an Indian flavor to it, and the stringy cheese in the middle of it all was a nice surprise. Their pizza is served Detroit style, and each of the four slices has a cheesy, crispy crust. Topped with Nduja peppers and onions, sausage and ranch (which came on the side in a mini squeeze bottle), this reminded me of a supreme pizza. The squid ink pasta tasted fresh from the sea - I loved the bold flavors. For dessert they had two options, a deconstructed cheese plate and one that sounded like an apple pie. It had a flaky crust, caramel sauce, the most delicious apples and vanilla ice cream on top! I loved every single thing we ate, and I can only pray that there won't be a huge wait the next time that I come here. The location is great - the Arlo NoMad is modern and trendy, and the restaurant fits right in. Service was top notch, as to be expected from this group. Our server was thoughtful and genuinely friendly. He was able to give us helpful suggestions, and even the bus boys were super nice when bringing our food over. I'll be back to try more!",6,4,5,Michelle B.,"Brooklyn, NY",446,352,1499
5.0,11/17/2016,"Wow. I've only just tried their Breakfast Pizza, but wow. Definitely need to come back for more stuff. The dining room is bright and beautiful, and will be a great spot once they start dinner next week.It's an ambitious new venture from the team behind Talde, and they are also starting lunch from ""The Bodega"", which is the little window in the front of the hotel, serving pizza by the slice, pastries, and Italian sandwiches.Going back to that pizza though, you must try it. Topped with bacon, a fried egg and cheese, along with everything bagel seasoning and a personal squeeze bottle of ""Srirancha Ketchup"" (not a typo), it's super salty, fatty and addictive. I'll be back soon for more pizza and sandwiches.",23,10,15,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
