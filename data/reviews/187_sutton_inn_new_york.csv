5.0,4/26/2019,"Four of us at dinner. Staff got one entree wrong (they brought filet mignon instead of chicken) which was really not a big deal for us, but they took the entree off the bill. At more than $50 this was a really generous, unnecessary, but appreciated accommodation. All of our meals were absolutely outstanding. My filet was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Service was perfect.

5.0,10/24/2018,"This is a great little place off the beaten path. Went in for dinner and was a little bit early. I was told by the very friendly waitress that I could have a seat despite them not being open yet and even though the bartender wasn't in yet she would gladly make me a drink.The food was well composed, fresh and tasty. I really enjoyed the seasonal lobster dumplings and the salmon was great. The deserts were also really good...They have a no tipping policy, so if you are looking at prices online keep that in mind. They aren't as expensive as they seem when you realize you aren't leaving a tip afterwards..Pro Tip: they have an arrangement with the wine store on 1st and 54th that if you buy a bottle of wine from the store they won't charge you a corkage fee. While you can't really see it from the outside because it is in the back past all the tables, they have a fairly nice bar.

Now I did read about the small portions, and despite coming from an old school Italian culture where portion use to be important, same ole is great, I thought the portions were just right. I really enjoyed the different salad. I would say the food was on point from all perspectives: presentation, portion, and flavor. We will look forward to seeing you again. We love this restaurant.

Feels like someone took the fanciest of haute cuisine and stuffed it into a livable, unprepossessing and welcoming environment. The BYOB option (no corking fee for wine purchased at the nearby wine shop on 1st) is a particularly phenomenal value and lets you bring a favorite with you (though the restaurant's wine menu is more than adequate).

5.0,4/13/2018,"Wow! Impeccable service and phenomenal cuisine. This restaurant is nestled on a pretty street near Sutton Place. You will notice that the clientele are mainly rich older people or the occasional business people drinking bottles upon bottles of wine. We had the three course tasting menu. It took a long time for our appetizer to come out which consisted of gnocchi and pea soup. Because of the wait, boyfriend and I were offered complimentary proseccos to compensate. Classy touch. We then had chicken and salmon for our mains and creme brûlée and chocolate tart for our desserts. Considering how much food we got, the tasting menu was a good deal. I do not normally spend so much money on a dinner but this is the white linen, top notch service, and interesting dishes that you expect to receive dining at a five star restaurant. I would certainly recommend this place to foodies who can appreciate an unusual and elegant culinary adventure .

Beautiful presentation, attentive and great service, but the taste/texture of the dishes were just ehhh.I did like the salad, risotto with sausage, and beet soup! I did not like the carbonara. There was no flavor..or saltiness. I could be wrong but I think the chef forgot the salt or cook the pasta in salt. Tasted bland. I heard he table next to me say the duck was amazing!! If they had that as an option on their restaurant week menu I would have tried it. Next time I go, I'll order from the main menu instead so I can try the duck.

3.0,1/20/2018,"This is a really adorable restaurant in midtown east. I came here for a group dinner in early January and waited by the bar until our entire party was here. I didn't have a cocktail, but the bartender was attentive and they served us some homemade chips while we waited. Once we were seated, we quickly placed our drink / food orders. We didn't try any of the appetizers and went right for our entrees. I had the salmon which was very delicious but very small. How small you ask? Well, I met my cousin for a drink post-dinner and we split the Mac and cheese at the other bar because I was still hungry. Maybe I would have left feeling more satisfied if we shared some apps in addition to our entree but our bill was around 71 per person for one glass of wine, one entree, and one cup of tea/coffee each. Mind you, this is a non tipping restaurant. So maybe at another restaurant it would have been like 55-60 per person... regardless, it was a pricy meal to leave feeling hungry (and sober haha). I don't think I would come back based on the prices/portion size, but I did enjoy my salmon.",0,1,0,Lauren L.,"Manhattan, NY",105,115,14

5.0,2/14/2017,"As someone who worked in the restaurant industry for years I have made it a habit NOT to write reviews. With that said, I recently had dinner with my boyfriend at Sutton Inn, and I was so pleasantly surprised by the attention to detail that I wanted to give praise where praise is due.Unknown to the staff, we were celebrating my birthday, and we chose to try the 5 course tasting menu. Each of the dishes were delicious and the courses were timed very well. The only hiccup in our evening was when our Sea Bass came out undercooked. I very rarely, if ever, return anything, as I find that too many people will complain over the smallest thing simply to complain or to get something for free. However, I wanted to be able to really enjoy my Bass so I reluctantly flagged the waitress and asked her if I could have it cooked more. Without so much as a hiccup, the waitress returned my Sea Bass to the kitchen and when she brought it back to the table it was cooked perfectly (my boyfriend, after trying round 2, regretted his decision to keep his) and was accompanied by the delicious Lobster Dumplings (compliments of the chef). Furthermore, when it came time for our final course, desert, the waitress informed us that the chef wanted to offer us a different desert, which he discretely delivered himself. Let me reiterate that these kinds of gestures on the part of the restaurant/chef are a clear sign of how much care they put into making their product and the overall experience memorable. They did not know it was my birthday, and although inconvenient an undercooked piece of Sea Bass is not a deal breaker. However, the way that they chose to handle the situation truly moulded my experience and I will be back for more delicious food.

2.0,1/30/2017,"I really wanted to like Sutton Inn.  Live in the neighborhood, great reviews, cozy yet comforting decor.  The bulk of the issues had to do with service, which was surprising given the glowing reviews here.  At this price point, which is comparable to what Michelin-starred restaurants charge, expectations are understandably high.  I know I'm going to sound like a snot, but (i) every server should know about the foie gras + sauternes classic pairing combination, especially if foie is on your menu (our primary server was completely lost and the secondary server tried to be helpful w/another wine pairing suggestion but blanked as well; fyi, sauternes by the glass is available on the dessert menu) and (ii) our server mishandled our steak entree, to the point that when it came out there was visible blood and oil smeared all over the clean white plate.  On this latter point, I was a bit shocked at the presentation - who wants to eat a $42 steak dish on a gross bloody oily plate (other than at a steakhouse)?  My wife's duck breast entree presentation had the same issue - oil and juices running across the plate, presumably from poor handling by the server.  It killed our appetites so we packed it to go and skipped dessert.  I debated saying something but didnt want to make it awkward, so here I am on the internet.  I know, I know.",0,1,0,Hhhoya W.,"New York, NY",9,94,0

The dessert, the chocolate mousse crunch was incredibly rich very tasty - the only thing I didn't like was the chocolate sorbet that came with this dish, though it was on the side so it was easy to avoid.

On the other hand the main dishes were absolutely terrific; I ordered the duck which quite frankly was to die for, with just the right brand of tenderness and moist crunchy skin. Also,  while I did not order the blue fish myself, I did have an opportunity to taste it and by this discover a most amazing dish. It was,  simply put, out of this world! Honestly! Note this  dish is seasonal so hurry there before it falls off the menu.Desserts were s little more disappointing I feel,  their ""mouse aux chocolat"" was more a chocolate cake of sorts and I didn't care much for the accompanying fruity sauces. One of our dishes was sent back per it's disappointment and another was reordered as a substitute.Besides the food and the restaurant's feel the service was flawless. We were very well looked after and our questions and concerns were immediately cared for with both efficiently and good humour.

4.0,9/20/2016,"Sutton Inn is like a gem in the middle of midtown east. I came for a birthday celebration and was not disappointed. Prices are very reasonable and no tip is required since all wages are paid fairly. They have a 3 course tasting menu for $50 which is what we went for (also have a 4 course chefs tasting). To start I had the Rissotto which came in a very large portion. The flavors were very strong from the first bite and made you want to go back from more after each bite. However, the next time I would most likely want to try the chilled corn soup. For my entree I had the Bluefish with Green Curry. The fish itself was not very flavorful but the Green Curry and Grains that it came with were amazing. If there is one thing the chef does well here is the sauce and marinades that accompany each dish. For dessert I had the Rhubarb Tart which was delicious to the last bite. It isn't an extremely decadent dessert that makes it hard to finish and is one of the few desserts on pre-fixe menus I was actually able to finish. I would return in the future to try other dishes off the menu and probably avoid the pre-fixe menu. The pre-fixe menu is great on a per dollar basis and basically gives you a free dessert.

4.0,2/8/2016,"Came here for restaurant week.  Wasn't really a deal.  You basically get a free dessert for the price... that's all.  I really enjoyed the appetizers.  Kale salad and mushroom risotto.   Both my boyfriend and I ordered the salmon which I really did enjoy.  My boyfriend thought it was too dry which I did not at all.  I did not like the dessert which was a chocolate mousse and a citrus vacherin.  It was good service, however, we were there quite early before a crowd ever showed.  The waitress was not helpful when we asked about her opinion on two separate entrees.  All she did was repeat what is written on the menu.  They do have a wonderful wine selection and I highly recommend chateauneuf du pape dom du viex lazaret 2011.  It was amazing.   All and all it was an enjoyable experience.  Just not an experience I would've paid the amount we paid for it even for restaurant week.  The wine was worth every penny though.",1,0,0,Krisitin R.,"Manhattan, NY",10,40,34
5.0,2/6/2016,"My boyfriend and I came here for the last night of restaurant week and really enjoyed everything we tried. I started off with the sweet potato soup, which they pour table side, and thought that the combination of cheddar, apple, and gingerbread was unexpected and delicious. My boyfriend had the mushroom risotto and I thought that it was great as well, and I don't even care for risotto or mushrooms. For my main course I got the chicken and it was cooked perfectly! They serve it with cauliflower, almonds, and grapes, which I've never seen on any other menu, and enjoyed every single bite of it. The deserts here are not to be missed as they are carefully constructed and combine unique and subtle flavors that keep you guessing and going back for more. You can tell that a lot of thought and care goes into everything that they make here and the food is by no means generic. In a city where great food is the norm, this restaurant manages to stand out. This is the first restaurant I've been to that doesn't accept tipping, so I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of service. However, the servers were all very attentive and knowledgeable. If you're in the area I'd say Sutton Inn is a great choice when you're looking for something unique for either date night or dinner with parents.",0,0,0,Hannah L.,"Manhattan, NY",6,13,13

Onto the food, really great flavors and perfect execution on the mushroom risotto and chicken entree. Please skip the sea scallop appetizer, that scallop was so miniscule I am convince they took one big scallop and carved one 3 mini rounds and the sous chef ate the cut-outs and tried to pass the dish as an 'artful' appetizer. Please give the clients respectful portions please. If you are looking for a cozy place for girls night out this might be a fun place.

5.0,1/25/2016,"We originally planned to just stop for a casual dinner, but then after looking at the menu, we cancelled our after-dinner plans so we could do the tasting menu. We thought why not, let's do the wine pairing as well, and I am so glad we did. Chef Scott provided an amazing dinner. We started with the Slow Poached Egg, and it so creamy and flavorful. Then we had the Nantucket Bay Scallops, and my boyfriend doesn't even like seafood, but raved about this dish. The Long Island Duck Breast was my personal favorite. I had to ask later how they got the duck skin so crispy. It was amazing. We proceeded to the Soy Marinated Atlantic Hake, and it was perfectly cooked and seasoned We finished with the Chocolate Mousse Crunch, and afterwards had warm baked Chai cookies.

1.0,1/20/2016,"I want to start off by saying that I REALLY wanted to like this place. I heard about it a while ago and I have been wanting to try it out. Although it is restaurant week, and it might not be the best accurate representation of the best the restaurant has to offer, it should have been as good of an experience to want me to come back and eat off the regular menu...isn't that the whole point of restaurant week after all? First off, I was definitely the youngest person in the place. I know its Midtown-east, but it seems that all the 75 y.o + UES diplomats and businessmen eat here. I called before and asked about a dress code and they said it was casual, when I showed up...casual...I felt super underdressed as I opened the door and saw every man wearing a sports jacket. I had a reservation for 8 and sat down 15 minutes early waiting for a friend to arrive. We asked for a cocktail list from the bar and was told they didn't have a menu...but the bartender could make anything we like...first turn off. While waiting for my friend to join us, we asked for bread, not only did it take like 15 minutes for bread, but the bread was horrific, it was cold, and tasted like a Parmesan Ritz Cracker baked last week, butter was hard and had to chomp away at it with my knife due to the fact that I was starving at this point. When my friend finally arrived, it took another 20 minutes until they didn't notice his arrival and we had to ask if we even had a waiter, which we were unsure who we were supposed to even communicate with to order. When the server came over, we ordered the 2011 Cotes De Rhone and each placed our individual RW order. 20 minutes later, wine came out, I tasted it...It was good. I asked to see the bottle, waiter showed it to me and it was a 2012, same vineyard...but still, I paid for a 2011 and I could tell the difference in vintage. I asked the waiter to see the wine list again because I swore I saw 2011 but she never brought it over and dodged the question. Risotto was delicious. Waited 45 minutes for Chicken and it was super tender, however, soggy skin, incredibly under seasoned, asked for some salt for something to help bring it to life, grapes were confusing but cool I guess...and then there was dessert.......CITRUS VACHERIN GRAPEFRUIT, YUZU TAPIOCA, KAFFIR LIME ICE CREAM??? Was the worst dessert I have ever had in my entire life. Plate was empty, one piece of grapefruit, yuzu tapioca tasted like grainy bitter rotten jello, kaffir lime ice cream was 1/2 way melted and had no kaffir lime flavor we all love...and don't even get me started on the rock hard, flavorless vacherin. Super disappointed, this is one of those instances where I wish no tip was included so I could have saved some money and left a nice $0 tip. It was that horrible.",2,3,1,Matthew M.,"FRESH MEADOWS, NY",16,20,36
5.0,1/5/2016,"I will certainly be coming back here. The service was impeccable. They don't accept tips which is nice and makes me feel like the waiters are paid a living wage. Our server did a fantastic job explaining my questions going into detail about the process rather than just the dish. The ambiance is elegant without being stuffy or trendy. The focaccia is great, the pretzel role is like eating a pretzel ball, and I did not try the parmesan bread. To start, I had the Ricotta Gnudi. The sauce they were in was delicious and the brussels sprouts were perfectly cooked. It was good, but I wish I had gone with the sweet potato soup like the rest of my family. For my main course I had the Hake, which was phenomenal. The fish was cooked perfectly and the potatoes, edamame, and mushrooms added a balanced heartiness to the dish. For desert I had the Grapefruit Vacherin. The presentation was beautiful and the flavor was decent, the ice cream being the best part.",3,0,0,Austin M.,"Manhattan, NY",7,9,2
1.0,1/1/2016,"Had a terrible New Years Eve experience. The service was horrendous. The waitress continuously asked us if we were ready to submit our order for the special four course menu. When I asked questions about the menu, she was unable to provide explanations and turned to the bartender for assistance. After taking our orders, she seemed to relinquish her duties as our waitress. We had to flag a random waiter down to order drinks, but after 45 minutes, there was no sign of these drinks arriving. When we inquired with our waitress, she said that our order must have gotten lost. At one point, she asked us which course we were waiting on. The pacing was awful. To top it all off, the waitress charged us for an extra person, so our bill was over $100 higher than it should have been. I am guessing that the no tipping policy has contributed to the restaurant going completely downhill since my previous last Feburary.

4.0,12/6/2015,"The Sutton inn has a nice semi-historic atmosphere. It was full but not packed on a Friday night, so I think this place is a little bit under the radar. We came here with friends, and we had a reservation. Things are a little bit pricey, but the tip is included in the price, so everything is less expensive than it seems. Servers were friendly, and the service was pretty good, which is impressive when you consider that this place has only been around for a few weeks.Here's the breakdown of the food:Baby Kale Salad - everyone liked this, it was a nice starter. How could you not like aged gouda?Caramelized butternut squash - I was a big fan of this dish, mostly because it was really unique. The caramelized squash has a creme brulee-ish top, and it comes in a thin bed of creamy ricotta-like goat cheese. Paired with whole lightly cooked cranberries, and chestnuts it's a great dish with unique flavors. Thanksgiving without the turkey.Smoked ricotta tortellini - I was also a fan of this dish, the sausage gives it a nice salty profile, and the brussel spouts make it fresh. A little small, but delicious.Pan seared salmon - this was delicious, but heavy. Bacon is delicious, hollandaise is delicious, and the salmon is cooked well. The spaghetti squash allows you to scoop up all that extra hollandaise sauce that could have been lost and gone forever.Soy marinated atlantic hake - I thought this was really unique as well - a nice light dish, with some salt and umami from the soy. I would recommend this.Our friends got the wild mushroom risotto and the grilled hanger steak, which they liked as well. The grilled hanger steak look really good.Overall, this was a nice intimate setting, with good unique food, that will probably only get more crowded.",2,0,0,Matt G.,"Hoboken, NJ",238,166,10
3.0,11/11/2015,Overall the food was good but nothing terribly special especially for the prices. I had the hanger steak which was disappointing as it didn't have much flavor to it. My friend had the Bronzino which was well cooked but again lacking much flavor. The tortellini appetizer was very good. The no tipping rule didn't seem to affect service which was find.

1.0,11/4/2015,Hands down one of the worst dining experiences I have had in a long time. I decided to bring clients there and was impressed by the menu and ambience in the photographs. I walked in and immediately could tell there was miscommunication amongst the staff. The music was not on and I asked if it was always so quiet. They let me know it had not been turned on yet. Odd since they were open. The server came and took our drink order (no cocktail menu) and after that we saw her two times. One when we had to literally flag her down after flagging down every single one of her colleagues and another time of flagging her down to get the bill.New Drinks were presented and old empty glasses were left behind. Apps served with no plates. Our drinks sat empty 75% of the time. We flagged down a different server who was obviously annoyed that we bothered her since it wasn't her table. Food was overcooked and far from what I read would be the experience. I could hardly eat it. The bathroom had a rancid smell and was far from being clean. I would never go back to this establishment.  It's one thing to lack in one department but to lack everywhere is far from good. The only thing I can say was positive was the company I had.,3,1,0,Jacquelin P.,"Miami Beach, FL",4,21,0

Your choice of a  popover, pretzel bread or the Foccia, you might have to tell them to stop coming over because you can easily down 3-4 pieces before you know it.   I have had the Porkchop and the Duck and could honestly not give you one negative comment about either.   The ice-cream for dessert was a perfect way to end up the meal and you get 3 scoops and have the choice of choosing 3 different types if you want nestled on crushed graham crackers.  My advice, go with the graham cracker ice cream!",0,2,0,marc s.,"Jamaica, NY",32,78,163

5.0,6/26/2015,"Food was fantastic. Relaxed, quiet place to dine. Waitstaff was truly lovely. The asparagus with morels and smoked egg yolk appetizer was perfect. Fresh and tender asparagus and a generous serving of morels. The sauces were at once both bright and rich. Nicely done. The branzino with sea beans was also impressive. So often I find over- or under-cooked fish at really upscale restaurants and have been frustrated by this, as I do not like sending food back. This filet was absolutely on point. Crispy, moist, and fully cooked--10 seconds more or less in the pan probably would have pushed it away from perfection. Sea beans were salty for my taste, maybe a bit much, but it's always fun to get to try something unusual and they went well with the rest of the vegetables. My sister had the chicken breast. Zero complaint. The Minuty was a lovely compliment to the meal. The Persephone was refreshing, but not particularly noteworthy.We tried the rhubbarb cheesecake for dessert, which was amazing. It was too much food to finish with everything else, but, like the other dishes, it was a creative approach and really very tasty. The rhubbarb was tart enough to set off the creamy cheesecake and sweetness of the almost crispy crust. Overall, each dish managed to push away from the tried and true routines and let me sample a touch of something just a little unusual or exotic.

I got the French Pepper and it was weirdly spicy and calming at the same time.Food menu is separated into Classic and Seasonal. The English pea soup was marvelous, smooth, light and refreshing. It was quite genius to use diced carrots in lieu of croutons. A seafood dish with fava and artichoke has got quite good reviews from critics, but since it is seasonal the fish is now branzino instead of salmon. It was a very substantial portion of protein. The skin was ridiculously crispy but the fish was a tad too greasy and overcooked. The blend of vegetables was on point. I never thought parsley, artichoke and fava would work so well together. Didn't order dessert. Espresso was good quality.Service was attentive. Price is on higher side despite the no tip policy.

2.0,2/22/2015,"I was excited to try to this place given all the positive reviews so far and the fact its a block from my apartment. While the service and decor were on point, the food was severely lacking.For appetizers we ordered the Lamb, crispy crab, and the tuna crudo. The lamb was dry and the au jus was flavorless. The crispy crab tasted more like a fish stick and was way too greasy because of the thick breading. The tuna crudo was actually great, but unfortunately this was the only good plate we had. They also served homemade bread which was great. If I could have done our order over again it would have consisted of just the tuna crudo and the Parmesan puffs.For entrees we both had the rib-eye and it was probably the worst steak either me or my girlfriend had ever had at a restaurant. First, the menu said the cuts were 7 oz but they were not even close to the same size. Second, I didn't taste my girlfriends steak but mine did not seem like a rib-eye cut as it was so tough and had the consistency of a NY strip. I wasn't expecting this to measure up to a steakhouse cut, but I have made a much better rib-eye at home on a stove top. Finally, for desert we ordered the cranberry cheesecake and were once again disappointed. I thought it was average but my girlfriend remarked how the desert lacked freshness and tasted ""like plastic"".The bill ended up being close to $200 and I did not feel like we received a meal with quality anywhere near the price.

4.0,1/18/2015,"Sutton Inn fits in well with the Midtown East neighborhood.  The ambiance is quiet and pleasant allowing for easy conversation.  The waitstaff are all kind and knowledgeable as well.The food was great but the menu seems like it is trying a bit too hard.  I got the Organic Chicken, which was quite tasty along with the brussel sprouts on the side.  However, the cauliflower had a bit of an off taste.  My Fiance had the duck and said it was excellent, but the ginger/orange combination through her off a bit.Overall, a great addition to the neighborhood.",1,0,0,Adam G.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",25,134,10
4.0,1/18/2015,"The chef here is very talented from the breads to the appetizers and to the entrees everything was fantastic. The only complaints would be the front of the house, there needs to be a more out going host to great you and deal with the coat check. Plus ther was no music playing in the background and the mixed cocktails were on the short side. All can be corrected very easily.I will definitely try again.",0,0,0,Robert D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0
5.0,1/16/2015,"What a great find! Sutton Inn is a new favorite for dinner and drinks, or just drinks! This lovely place is so warm and welcoming, as soon as I step through the door I am greeted by a smiling hostess asking if she can take my jacket.  For dinner, I have had the kale salad and Hake, which were both delicious choices, definitely recommend. If I'm not hungry enough for dinner, I love stopping in and just grabbing a drink at the bar with the bartender, Lauren. She is so friendly and outgoing. Great service and staff at this place! I only wish they had better wine by the glass options, but that won't stop me from coming back!",0,0,0,Kellyn N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0
5.0,1/8/2015,Fantastically good!!  A very welcome addition to our Sutton Place neighborhood.  I ordered the Scottish Salmon....prepared to perfection.  My dinner partner had the roast chicken and was equally delighted.  The ambience is quiet (probably quieter than usual since it was about 16 degrees tonight).   Terrific evening all around.  Fine service and a superb chef!,0,0,0,John B.,"Manhattan, NY",7,6,0
5.0,1/4/2015,"I stopped here after a long day at work and was not disappointed. I sat at the bar in the back of the restaurant. The bartender (Lauren) was very pleasant and outgoing. The menu had a few gems, though, I went for monkfish chop and it was superb. Excellent service and great staff. It's worth another visit next time I'm in the city.",0,0,0,Jose L.,"Philadelphia, PA",15,2,0
5.0,12/27/2014,"If you didn't know better, from the looks you'd have thought this was still Jubilee, the restaurant that inhabited this space for many years: The banquettes recovered, but the tables set up the same, still with the little cupboard at the front and the velvet curtain keeping out the cold. The resemblance stops once the service and food start. We love Jubilee, even in its new spot, but Sutton Inn blows it away. Excellent service (bordering on obsequious but never crossing the line) and amazing food. Breads: choice of parmesan, herb, pretzel, with maple butter that brought out the flavor of everything. We shared an app of roasted butternut squash, filled with goat cheese, the plate garnished with crisp, fresh cranberries and pieces of warm chestnuts. A wonderful mix of texture and flavors. We had the branzino special (a perfectly cooked hunk of fish with, I think, puréed turnips that tasted almost like lemon mousse) and the duck breast, perfectly medium rare, not fatty at all, with carrots and just enough ginger to give the duck a small webbed kick. We splurged on two desserts: Chocolate mousse crunch, with raspberries, a hint of ginger and a sorbet that was more like cold whipped cream; and pumpkin cheesecake that was more like pumpkin mousse pie. And who knew coconut would go so well with pumpkin? Sutton Inn did. With a cocktail and glass of wine each, total was around $200, not outrageous, though not a weekly thing. I think we have our new favorite treat-ourselves place. Our only concern is that the name makes it sound more like a bar that serves food, instead of an incredible food destination. We hope that it can survive and thrive, despite its odd location, on a mostly residential block.",1,0,0,M P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0
5.0,12/21/2014,I LOVE this place. It has a very charming ambience and it is blissfully quiet. Not easy To find a quiet restaurant these days. The food was great especially the roasted mushrooms and the Hake...just fabulous. Service was lovely and very friendly.Really nice dining experience.,6,0,1,Bonnie B.,"Manhattan, NY",3,33,0
5.0,12/20/2014,Sutton Inn is a real treat.  We were wowed by everything from the candlelit ambiance to the impeccable service and... of course the food.  My guest and I agreed the roasted mushroom appetizer was the best we had ever had.  The kale salad was gorgeous with squash and aged goat cheese and my guest raved over her hake.  Our server and the maitre d' could not have nicer or more accommodating.  If you want an overall excellent fine dining experience - this is your place.,4,0,3,Sasha A.,"Playa Del Rey, CA",0,65,8
2.0,12/14/2014,"I'm not very adventurous when it comes to food. When we noted that the new restaurant opening, only blocks away, would be featuring American cuisine, we decided to give it a try. Upon entering the Sutton Inn, we were offered a choice of two tables near the front of the room. Our dinner companions choose one and we all took our seats. I ended up with my back to the rather narrow aisle. The first big plus was that there was no loud music, forcing people to speak louder than normal. I soon discovered that the aisle was much too narrow. Each time a waiter or patron walked behind my chair I was struck. Most of the time, the waiters courteously apologized. Other patrons however, seemed oblivious and made no effort to side step through the narrow space. I was hit in the back of the head by an elbow or purse on several occasions during dinner. I should have complained and ask to be seated at another table, but noted that the small restaurant was fully occupied and no other tables were available. In my opinion, economics aside, our table should have been for two, not four. We've eaten in every conceivable type or restaurant, from roadside truck stops to five star restaurants in major European cities. I have learned that the swankier, more expensive the menu, the smaller the portions. The Sutton Inn's menu of entrees consists of seven items ranging from $23 to $42 did not seem exceedingly high, except when I noted that it was à la carte and a vegetable would add an additional $7 to $9 to my dinner. I ordered the Scottish Salmon and was not surprised when I was served a piece, cooked to my request, which measured a scant 2 X 2"" and about ¾ inch thick. Having forgone an appetizer and vegetable, I immediately realized an after dinner snack would be needed. I left the restaurant hungry and bruised. Regardless of how much of this I could blame on myself, I can find no reason to make a return trip to the Sutton Inn.",4,2,0,Ken T.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,55,0
5.0,12/12/2014,"Sutton Inn is my new neighborhood favorite.  I will become a regular.  I discovered the warm ambiance through the windows from the outside looking in while walking around, but my dining experience inside was even more true to my taste.  The ingredients in the kale salad with root vegetables were the first indication to me that the chef is experienced. I also enjoyed a flavorful, tender rib steak and recommend it. After all that, I couldn't skip dessert... and glad I didn't. I indulged in the chocolate mousse accompanied with the bartender's own Manhattan recipe much to my liking. The food is excellent, and the service equally inviting.",0,0,0,Irene D.,"Manhattan, NY",2,10,0
5.0,11/29/2014,"My wife and I have strolled by Sutton Inn countless times while it was under construction. We were curious to see what the dormant spot (once home to Jubilee) would soon become.  The space had some relatively large shoes to fill as we loved going there years ago.  I had the pleasure of meeting one of the servers, Guilherme, the day after they opened who was excited to tell me about the restaurant and its offerings.  We requested to have him take care of us there the next evening!Well I am happy to report that everything from food to decor to service exceeded our expectations.  We both decided to do the 5 course tasting menu with the optional wine tasting as there were to many interesting dishes to try.  The flavors were amazing with everything complimenting each other perfectly and aligned brilliantly for the season.  The wine tasting was equally ample and delicious.  I will not get into every detail here but surely it seemed one could not go wrong with any choice on the menu.  The most significant dish of the tasting was the Duck, a dish I learned long ago not to order as I was always disappointed.  This was the best Duck I've ever had!The Sutton Inn is classy and subtle in appearance and feel.  The Chef/Owners clearly know that the food they are serving says more than any other detail about the restaurant.  We will be regulars for sure.",3,0,1,Evan N.,"New York, NY",233,6,0
5.0,11/25/2014,"I loved my entire experience here- the ambiance was elegant yet welcoming, and the service was impeccable. Our server's description of the pairing of wines with different courses was great, and we were very well attended to. Of course, all of the food too was incredible. We sampled a variety of dishes, and everything was very flavorful- I particularly enjoyed the Lobster and Quinoa and Atlantic Hake. From the desserts, the Chocolate Mousse Crunch was delicious.

5.0,11/22/2014,"Sutton Inn is a great new neighborhood spot. The food is incredible, very seasonal. I went there on a cold night and the ambiance was warm and glowing. I had the most delicious fall-inspired sweet potato soup with diced apple, cheddar and toasted ginger bread croutons, poured table side. One of the best soups I've ever had! It was paired with a delicious french Chardonnay recommended by the chef. I felt so cozy and taken care of by the staff. Definitely recommend this place as a new neighborhood go-to.",4,0,0,Elizabeth G.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,15,0
