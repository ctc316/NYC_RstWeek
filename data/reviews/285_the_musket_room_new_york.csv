4.0,4/13/2019,"Amazing flavors from the start. I wish I could give it 5 stars as the staff was wonderful and the food was phenomenal but near the end of the long tasting the pacing between meals kind of fell off the the train. The oysters, crawfish, and caviar courses were amazing. The scallops left something to be desired. The sweetbreads were fabulously complimented by the peas but the steak was overly salty. The dessert course was something I wish I loved but the 20 min wait between each course was laborious. Overall I would come here again but I feel like I would have to make a huge time commitment.",0,0,0,Kathleen L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,3
5.0,3/31/2019,"I was so excited about Restaurant Week (RW) when I first came to New York, I mean who doesn't like those affordable fine dining prix fixe menu? After trying so many of them, I realized that food quality and portion are less than regular menu. Also service is quite slow due to high volume of orders.

5.0,3/24/2019,"After a long day in the city, we asked a friend for recommendations and she chose The Musket Room. As we passed by busy bars and made our way down Elizabeth Street, we were surprised to see this quiet restaurant, and ducked inside for some drinks at the bar. Over cocktails, we discovered that TMR is a Michelin Star restaurant, but without any of the pretentious attitude typically associated with the award, and with absolutely reasonable prices for a 3 course tasting menu! The staff was incredible to us, bringing us little extras and making us feel like home throughout our meal, and it was certainly one of the best experiences I have had in the city.

He was on top of all our food and drinks and full of personality. Reservations were made easily. Communication via email was handled promptly and dIm giving 4 stars because while the small tasting menu items were tasty, the portion sizes were underwhelming, think bite sized snacks. I do appreciate their efforts in making a pescatarian friendly tasting menu for me.

4.0,3/17/2019,"I went here with a group of 8 for a friend's 40th bday. We had a reservation at 9:30pm and were able to be seated upon arrival. We had a couple guests with food allergies so I made sure to notify them before we arrived and they had their own special menu throughout the night.This place served up some great food--most of the courses were very good, though nothing quite blew us away. That being said, the whole ambiance and vibe of the place was great and the service was top-notch. Also, we really enjoyed the cocktails as they were super tasty and inventive. Overall, I was definitely impressed with this place, though I found it to be a bit overpriced--but not surprised as it is a tasting menu format.

2.0,3/5/2019,"I was quite disappointed by my experience at The Musket Room. While it is worth noting the food was quite well-prepared everything else fell well outside my expectations of a fine dining experience.  The meal was rushed, either by design (which would be disappointing) or due to the staff wanting to turn-tables. For example, we were never given the option to have a cocktail before our meal and were never given the option to have tea or coffee after. When we asked for a cocktail before dinner, it was of course served, but along with the first course as opposed to before like was requested. Further, the group I was with did the short form tasting menu and wine pairing. In their apparent haste to turn the table multiple times, we were not able to enjoy the full pairing before being poured another glass, making the table crowded with unfinished beverages. Again, I want to reiterate the food was quite good, it is just a shame that for such an expensive and purported fine dining established that we were treated to a fast-food pace.",0,0,0,Fred I.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,4
5.0,3/1/2019,"They set the bar high, really REALLY high! While restaurants with a Michelin star tend to cover a large and varied range I walked out of this spot afterwards feeling like I had dined at a spot with more stars! The place itself is quite nice, very hip with a nice casual air to it. We had gone for my birthday and my wife had noted that when she made the reservation. When we got to our table the waitstaff had all signed a bday card, gestures like that can really make a meal personal and take it from ordinary to special. Our waiter was Kevin, and he was amazing, fun and very well informed about the food and wine. We did the long story, and it is long, took us about 3.5 hours. So let me take you on a story of the food because quite frankly it was spectacular!They started us with bread, I had the brioche with cheese on it. Each one is a single serving and the flavors are great. POWHIRI Section:Squash tart - Two bites of heaven, the tarte shell was stunningly thin and delicate white the squash has a smooth butteryness to it. Radish | brown butter - The crispness of the radish complimented is sharp bite which was mellowed by the sweet butter. Deer croquette - Heaven! The meat was amazingly tender and juicy while the exterior was perfectly thin with the lightest crunch. KAIMOANA Section:Shigoku oyster | trout roe | yuzu - The Yuzu did wonders in cutting in creating balance between the ocean flavors of the oyster and the salty tang of the roe. Diver scallop | PEI mussel | tapioca | dill - This dish really elicited feelings of the ocean bringing back memories of spending time on Cape Cod. The tapioca added a neutral plane for the brine and slat of the mussel while complimenting the soft flesh of the scallop, a clean bite of ocean air. Hangi potato | hen yolk | caviar  - This dish will be remembered for a very long time. Both the yoke and the caviar are super rich bites, and both were beautifully balanced by the potato. The three together on a spoon was mind blowing. I also don't think I have ever had mashed potato so smooth. PAPATÙÀNUKU Section:Smoked foie | apple | manuka honey cake - The presentation on this was unreal, the foie was molded into a tiki warrior, super creative. The Foie was smooth and subtle with hints of smoke. The apple was prepared in several ways with slight variations in the flavors and the honey cake was soft and divine. A solid plate. Quail | blackberry | bread sauce | roasted onion - Smooth clean flavors, the onion and quail were slightly earthy while the bread sauce helped carry an ever so subtle tang and sweetness from the blackberry.  Canterbury beef Wellington | spinach crepe | duxelle | truffle jus - Without a doubt the best beef wellington I have eaten. The meat was cooked medium rare, the flavors being beefier and deep, with an added oomph from the jus. RANGINUI Section:Woodcock Farms (kind of blue) | cranberry | honey | sourdough - Honestly I didn't know I could keep eating by this point. The cheese added a sharp bite that was almost surprising after the subtle beauty of the dishes beforehand. The bread helped temper the flavors while the honey counter the salt. This dish was a nice wake up call.  Page mandarin | Kaffir lime  - Very fun way to transition into desert. It was served in a smoking bowl of oranges. The sorbet was smooth and tarte, waking up the taste buds while creating a refreshing rush in the mouth. Valrhona chocolate variations | raspberry - One of the best deserts I have ever had. The flavors were so perfectly paired I feel I can't fairly express it here. The mouse was bittersweet and ever so creamy. The raspberry danced across the taste buds smoothly interreacting with the mouse. The cake was chocolate, thin and light. The shell was beautifully tin with a great crack to it. And lastly there were little balls of chocolate about it that added a great crunch to the bite.      KA KITE Section: This was in a take home box. Herbal caramel - This was good, an interesting twist to the flavor. Passionfruit & fennel gummy - This was delicious, the fennel added a very unexpected kick to the gummy adding nice depth to the fruity flavor of the passionfruit. Hauraki salted liquid bonbon - Wow, just wow. This was spectacular. Its funny because we also had a box of chocolates from Jacques Torres at home, while his was very good, this was on another level. All I can say is that this place delivers an experience, not just a meal.",0,0,0,Nathaniel Ħ.,"Brooklyn, NY",194,89,21
2.0,2/26/2019,"Review for the $165 Long Story 10 course tasting menu. First sign of concern was the fact that there were only 3 or 4 other tables seated at the time we arrived which was 8:30pm and the time we left which was 10pm. Granted it was a Monday but any restaurant that thinks it can pull off a 10 course tasting menu that all in all will cost more than $200 per person should never be that empty. The food was very average. The best items were the 1) free cheddar biscuits with herb butter that came before the tasting menu, 2) oysters and roe which were light and refreshing, 3) hangi potato with yolk and caviar, and the 4) chocolate mousse with raspberry coating... though nothing stole the show. The beef wellington with truffle jus was the ""main"" course and looked incredible. It was incredibly average. I would have rather enjoyed a McDonalds hamburger any day. Other dishes like the scallop and quail were in fact decent, though in general the whole meal felt like a dud for the price. There are much better options out there. I think this place is past its prime. The service was excellent and the staff very friendly.",0,0,0,Matt E.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0
3.0,2/23/2019,"I was very excited about this place but unfortunately our experience was only ok here... We did come for restaurant week so maybe their regular menu is better! We tried:- Quail - portion was small and flavor-wise not very memorable- Cod in green curry - this was pretty disappointing, as the cod was a little overcooked and quite tough and lacking in flavor. The green curry was on the milder side, and had a slight tart flavor.- Pavlova with berries and passionfruit - the dish is exactly what the name suggests: some pavlova, some berries and some passionfruit puree. I guess the only innovative part of the dish is that the pavlova is in a thin cylindrical shape, but we didn't think that the presentation impacted the taste at all.The highlight of the meal was their complimentary cheese brioche bread. There's nothing to not like about these little warm fluffy cheesy balls. I would've been happier just eating a bunch of these for dinner...",0,0,0,Sophia X.,"Manhattan, NY",384,126,189

5.0,2/18/2019,"I always appreciate the ~story~ when it comes to food, and the Musket Room has a rich story of New Zealand's cuisine and culture to tell through its dishes. I came for restaurant week, and was early hoping to catch happy hour (as advertised on the website), but we were informed that they no longer have it. We had a later reservation, but luckily a table opened up and was able to get seated without waiting too long.Our server was friendly and was patient while we took our time choosing the wine to accompany our meal. We ordered off the winter 2019 restaurant week menu, and I'll say that I enjoyed every dish that came out! I got the quail to start off, and while you can see a lot of the quail's shape in meat form, the meat was very tender and its combination with the blackberry and bread sauce is unexpectedly good. As the entree I got the super meaty cod that melted in my mouth and came with a really nice green curry sauce. I got to try a bit of the chicken dish, and it was very soft and not dry at all! For dessert, I really appreciated how they had a non-sweet option (blue cheese w/ cranberry compote) but their carrot cake, though not a fan usually, was pretty good - not too sweet, not too dry. I also tried the pavlova which honestly isn't my type of dessert, but I'm sure i'd feel the same way about it no matter where I had it.I'd want to come back to try one of their more traditional tasting menus and see what else they have to offer!tl;dr I give it a 5 star because I think it's a great experience and value for restaurant week.",0,0,0,Dan-Ah K.,"Manhattan, NY",561,104,680
4.0,2/14/2019,"I came here with my girlfriend for an early Valentine's Day dinner. I have heard some good reviews about this place and despite some mixed reviews, we gave it a shot. Sadly, we did not love it. It was good, but not amazing.The restaurant is located in the Soho. We really enjoyed the interior design as it had a minimalist vibe to it. It also appears to have outdoor seating which was not open at this time during winter.The menu is separated into three options: Short Story, Long Story, and Pre-Fixed. This translates to a 6 course tasting, 10 course tasting, and a 3 course pick you own dish menu. The bread that they start you off with is amazing. And this is coming from a guy that doesn't even like bread. The sourdough is especially delicious. I also had the smoked old fashion cocktail; it's similar to the ones you find at Angel's Share and Sakamai.The ""Kaimoana"" courses were my favorite. The oyster, diver scallop, and hangi potato were all quite amazong. The smoked foie was not a favorite unfortunately. And the beef wellington, although tasty, was a bit of a disappointment as it was a deconstructed beef wellington as opposed to the real meat pie.The waitstaff were friendly but a bit lacking in attentiveness. They were busy stacking and glassware as opposed to noticing that my drink was empty. One was even taking a selfie at one point. Not a dealbreaker, but you could be a bit more aware of your patron's needs.Overall, I think the food was good but not amazing. I would consider giving this place a second go but my girlfriend considered this place a one and done.",1,0,0,Tony Y.,"New York, NY",250,177,1053

2.0,2/10/2019,"What a letdown. I visited four Restaurant Week spots this season, and this was my least favorite by far. They changed numerous parts of the menu. No mussels in the cod dish. The smoked ricotta dumplings were no longer smoked. The mackerel appetizer was replaced by scallop (I actually didn't mind this as I love scallop). The honeycomb in the blue cheese ""dessert"" was replaced by plain honey. Our waitress claimed it was subject to change every day, but that wasn't written anywhere so it took us by surprise. Feels like kind of a shady downgrade from what they listed. Apparently these dishes are normally not part of their regular menu, so they fail to give me a sample of what this restaurant offers up... which is kind of the point.The complimentary bread (we got cheddar brioche) arrived on a nifty, rustic platter that resembled the cross section of a log. Very cool, points for presentation. The butter was tasty and came topped with seaweed powder. Probably one of my favorite bites of the night.Everything else was okay to underwhelming. The scallop and quail appetizers were itty bitty and somewhat boring. The cod was a bit firmer than I'd like, and the green curry was a bit liquidy and kind of mild. I had fun breaking the thin, crepe-like roll of the pavlova, but it just dissolved into sugar without much other flavor. I did enjoy the sweet, tangy flavor of the passion fruit bits... but I could've done without the rest.All in all, not a stellar representation in my mind. Portions were miniscule and underwhelming in flavor, so I don't think I'd return. If I want some New Zealand cuisine, maybe I'll just give Kiwiana in Park Slope a try.",2,1,0,Wendy W.,"Brooklyn, NY",135,190,778
4.0,2/10/2019,Came here for restaurant week and the food is delicious! I must warn this is more of a testing menu restaurant. The portions are extremely small and will by no means fill you.

5.0,2/5/2019,"What a lovely experience! I came here during restaurant week for dinner with one of my girlfriends. It's a sleek, dimly lit restaurant that gives off a sexy yet elegant vibe. Service was delightful. Our waitress had a bright personality and gladly answered our questions regarding the menu and drink/wine list. When our food was being served, a different person (the server) presented the dish and explained the components of each dish. (This was refreshing). For my course selection, I started with the quail, continued with the cod, and finished with the carrot cake. My friend started with the diver scallop, continued with the butternut squash ricotta dumplings, and finished with the pavlova. The quail was magnificently executed! The meat was extremely tender, flavorful, and dressed in an exquisite blackberry sauce. The sauce was slightly sweetened, giving the dish a flavorful surprise. The cod was cooked to perfection. It was lightly crisp on the outside, and perfectly flaky on the inside. The dish was served in a green curry sauce that was rich in flavor, but light in consistency. It had a mild level of spiciness to it, which was more than manageable and added a perfect characteristic of the plate. The carrot cake was the heartiest of the 3 courses, giving it a nice ""homey""/comfort food feel. I paired my courses with a New Zealand sauvignon blanc, which was equally delightful. My friend said all three of her courses were delightful and filled with flavor. She voiced throughout the meal that she was highly impressed with her meal execution, and that she throughly enjoyed her meal. She paired her meal with their special drink for the night, which was the ""musket mule"". She informed that her drink was ""really good"" and left her quite tipsy (this is a plus in her book).

But I did not know beforehand how chicken could be cooked so perfectly tender and savory. The cod was also phenomenally prepared. I do not like curry but the cod and the green curry that came with it was a match made in heaven. The Pavlov tasted very citrusy, and the strawberries were super fresh. Also, I cannot believe how good the carrot cake was. I love cake, and usually, I do not go for carrot cake, but I am so, so glad I did.

3.0,2/2/2019,"Went for restaurant week dinner. The biggest complaint was the portion - both my friend and I were still hungry after the 3 courses... The appetizer quail was only half of my palm size-wise. We thought it was okay since it was only the appetizer. Then the main course came and the cod was SMALLER than half of my palm, and it came with one single bok choy. The dessert was small too - less than 1/4 of the plate it came in.

Highly recommend this restaurant in the heart of Nolita and near SoHo.Overall: 4.8/5Value: 4.5/5 (restaurant week) Food: 5/5Decor: 4.8/5Service: 5/5First off the bread was heavenly. First round is complimentary, afterward they charge $6 for 4 rolls. Warm and buttery cheese rolls and earthy sourdough, pretty worthy of being deemed an attraction on its own! We ordered the restaurant week 3 course menu ($42), along with the additional foie gras course ($20). I had the quail, butternut squash and ricotta dumplings, and carrot cake. The quail was heavenly. Yes, a somewhat small portion but perfectly tender and delectable - a highlight for sure. The foie gras mousse was so creamy and rich, and was nicely offset by the crisp tartness of the apple. Again a fairly small portion but enough to share a bit and have a taste. Absolutely beautiful plating with the foie gras shaped into tribal figures. The ricotta dumplings has an interesting taste, but were nicely offset with the sweet butternut squash and sunflower seeds. I had a bite of my friend's cod and it was really good with the slightly spicy green curry. Carrot cake was so good and had the right mix of creamy and earthy with the balance of cream and cake. Liked how it was not too sweet as well. Decor is quite casual for a Michelin Star restaurant but service is still impeccable, with servers timing to ensure plates are placed down in synchrony and all.

It has a light floral flavor without any sweetness and maintains the richness of classic foie gras. The quail was cooked to perfection as well. The ambiance is the perfect escape from the loud city.

The staff was attentive and provided great recommendations on drinks based on what we said we liked drinking.I read some of the reviews saying the portions were to small but to me it was the right size. I left feeling very full and I couldn't even finish my final dessert.Cheese brioche - basically could eat a whole basket of this. The butter had some seaweed flakes and salt on top which was a nice touch. The 3 piece amuse bouche was delightfully pleasant. Personally loved the mushroom one.Scallop with tapioca and dill. Normally don't like a heavy dill flavor but this had a bit of creme fraische to balance it out.Foie with apples was probably my least favorite but that's because I'm not really into foie but I appreciate the complexity of flavors.Beef Wellington was very nicely cooked and delicious. A tad salty for my personal taste.Pear sorbet was really nicely balanced with the caramel.

Next up was the beef Wellington. The pate was very salty but the meat was cooked perfectly. We moved on to dessert after that with a pear sorbet, some fancy cream on top and a bourbon sauce.

When I told our server, Marishka, about it she responded with an attitude instead of apologizing. The food was great but service was horrible.",1,0,0,Anuki M.,"Manhattan, NY",13,8,17

5.0,11/25/2018,"I would give 4.5 stars, but since I can't and we had such a nice experience, I am going with 5 stars. We came here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and when we were brought to our table we found the staff had all signed a birthday card which was a really nice touch.The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and the staff are excellent, extremely attentive (refilled your water glass as soon as it was half empty) knowledgeable and friendly. We opted for the long story menu which is 10 courses. They brought cheddar brioche to the table which was divine. We also tried their rye and sourdough bread, both were good, but the brioche was the outstanding. The first dish was a bite size pork rillete, crab stick and smoked trout cracker. The pork was the best thing on the plate, the other two were alright, not very memorable. The second dish was three oysters which were pretty good, lightly flavorful and served cold. I had only had oysters once before and this was the first time trying them for my boyfriend, but we both found them pleasant. Next were scallops which was our least favorite dish. They were clean and crisp and light but almost entirely devoid of flavor. The truffle mashed potato with egg and caviar they brought out next was delicious and was one of the highlights. The foie grais came with honeycake and beets and was really tasty and flavorful. That was followed by the quail which was really enjoyable, lots of flavor and everything on the plate went well together. The next dish was our favorite which was the beef. I am a big beef fan and this was one of the best pieces of beef I have ever tasted. Perfect texture, cooked medium with an incredible spiced exterior. The broccoli it was served with was surprisingly good, light and crispy and the swede and puree underneath went well together. The whole plate was perfect. The next course before dessert was a whipped blue cheese with onion and walnut. I am not a huge blue cheese fan and while this wasn't offensive (it was better than I'd thought it would be), two bites were more than enough for me. For dessert we got a pear sorbet which was nice and refreshing, the lavender foam on top was a nice touch. Next we had the sweet potato mousse which was nice, but nothing to write home about. The best dessert was the one they brought my boyfriend for his birthday, chocolate ganache with mocha. It was decadent and satisfying. The last item which they gave to us in a small to go box, was a chocolate rum bonbon, a fernet gummy and a hazelnut orange caramel. None were sensational, but they were good.The dinner took about 2.5hrs and each dish was presented beautifully. You leave feeling quite full and the price is relatively reasonable for the quality and number of courses. I would recommend it for a special occasion.",0,0,0,Jennie A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,160,3

We thought he tried too hard to ask questions about why we were out, whether we were having fun, etc.   It felt like he was forcing a relationship with us.  I would recommend that he read his audience and if the table doesn't respond, to moderate the approach.The back room is a good setting, but it's loud.   One way to fix this is to put sound absorption on the ceiling.   Most restaurants do this.",0,1,0,Doug J.,"New York, NY",6,39,8
1.0,11/8/2018,"Just a 1 star, because: we haven't been poisoned!We had the short story tasting menu and here's what I think about it:1st course: 3 smallest appetizers which tasted almost the same, can't imagine what you need to do with the caviar so it has no caviar taste2nd course: scallops, has nice taste of cider and horseradish, but no scallops at all, just a feeling you ate something soft.3rd course: quail -- in a size of a cotton swab, there were 2 pieces, one had crust and another one is not! Seriously, why so small???Grass fed beef was ok, but, additionally we ordered red deer, which tasted the same and had the same texture!There was nothing outstanding in the desert also.The bread with a butter is nothing special.In my opinion, the price is too high, for $95(should be $45) you get so little food. This place has nothing in common with Michelin starred restaurants and it's still a mystery for me how they got one. After all, food was edible, but tasteless, I've seen waiters every 2 minutes and they continuously tried to sell me and my wife wine, instead of sharing plate of a red deer they brought deer to both of us.I wouldn't recommend this place and will never go back.",0,2,0,Mischa T.,"Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0

We ordered a few dishes to share instead of the tasting menu and were very satisfied.The drinks were good, not great and I switched to wine.We started off with 1 particular waiter who was curt and weird. It knocked our experience off kilter a bit. Then another waiter came by and he seemed to really love the restaurant and its food. He made recommendations and really engaged us which was nice.

With about 6 of us there, we just all decided to get a plate of just about everything off the a la carte menu to share since none of us had been before. Our waiter was incredibly kind and patient and knowledgeable about the foods. We trusted his judgement on the food and wine options he gave us, and we were glad we did!

5.0,9/8/2018,"This is one of THE MOST incredible dining experiences I have had in my entire life.  And, my review is just for Restaurant Week Summer 2018. It was my then fiance's now husband's birthday, and I wanted to choose somewhere extra special from the Restaurant Week participating places to go to celebrate.  I narrowed my search to Michelin star rated places, and what brought us to The Musket Room was not only their stellar near 5-star rating on Yelp, but the fact that they are a New Zealand restaurant.  We'll be going to New Zealand on our honeymoon in a few months, so thought this would be a great precursor - plus, I can't ever say that we have had New Zealand cuisine before!When we arrived around 7:30pm on a Friday, the restaurant was a little under half full but it quickly filled up over the few hours we were there.  From the moment we entered, to the moment we left, it was a true 5-star experience.  The staff was fabulous, the decor, flatware and everything in between was carefully designed and selected.  We were seated at a small table towards the back of the main dining room.  Our meal began with some delicious bread & butter served hot, a delicate but melt-in-your-mouth portion.  This is 100% a quality over quantity experience. All of the courses were petite, yet perfectly portioned. That satisfying dining experience when you leave the restaurant feeling full and inspired, but not stuffed. For my appetizer, I selected the Tomato Gazpacho soup. It was unlike any gazpacho I had before in my life.  The presentation was impeccable - the server arrived with a small milk jar, and poured the soup into my bowl.  The tomatoes were from the restaurant's personal garden behind the restaurant, and was topped off with olive oil and herbs.My main was unparalleled - the Smoked Ricotta Dumplings with artichokes, chanterelle and garden basil.  While I was blown away by the dumplings (and Gazpacho soup), the dessert was perhaps the star of the show. The Passionfruit Palvoa had a very unique, light and crisp crust with whipped cream inside, and of course it was presented beautifully.  It was topped off with some amazingly fresh strawberries. Restaurant Week was 100% worth it here.  I got to try the Gazpacho soup which is normally only offered on the tasting menu.  Plus, the Smoked Ricotta Dumplings are normally $31 on the a-la-carte menu, and the dessert is normally $14, so it is well worth the Restaurant Week fixed-price of $45. Would love to make it back to The Musket Room for a very special occasion to try their tasting menu.  This experience has me VERY excited to try New Zealand cuisine in the country on our honeymoon - high expectations have been set!",4,0,2,Collette S.,"Boston, MA",216,258,169
5.0,9/1/2018,"Myself and my boyfriend dined here last night, and truly had an amazing experience. First of all, the food was out of this world. One of the best meals we've ever eaten - and we're foodies who love to explore the best and the most innovative restaurants. The meal did have one hiccup, where the waiter accidentally brought me the dumplings rather than the duck as my meal. No big deal, an understandable mix up since we did have a discussion while ordering that the two meals sometimes sound the same. I kindly let the waiter know, and he promptly apologized and offered us an additional appetizer for the inconvenience. It wasn't an inconvenience to us, since as I said it's an understandable mixup, but we were very appreciative of the appetizer (foie) which he offered to bring. We both expected one plate of foie to share, since we had been sharing appetizers previously. However, we were floored when the waiter brought each of us our own dish. The foie was truly delicious and I highly recommend for anyone who dines here.

My friend had the tomato gazpacho which was creamy and I preferred. For the entree I had the cod which was sensational - full of flavor and butter. A friend had the smoked ricotta dumplings which were equally amazing - came with truffles. For dessert I had the passion fruit pavlova. To me this was the perfect dessert. Light, sweet, tangy.

Despite this serious flaw, I did enjoy my main course - the gnocchi - immensely. The sauce was delightfully sour and the gnocchi fluffy. It's the only veggie option on the menu, but hey, you only need one. And, I think all the meat and fish eaters were jealous.

I highly recommend the beefsteak tomato gazpacho, ora king salmon, and the long island duck breast.  The star of the show was definitely the gazpacho.  Dipping their warm rye bread into the soup was heavenly! I knocked off one star due to the ridiculously small portion they gave when the Quail arrived.

The way the food melds together in the mouth is, honestly, just about perfect.We were very impressed and happy. I can recommend the place.Once we left (and learned it has a Michelin star) that invites comparison. First, the wine menu should be improved. I don't know if they have a sommelier on staff: if not, they need one. Or they should revise it and listen more to the sommelier they have.Second, the service could be tightened up.

3.0,5/9/2018,"TLDR: beautiful, rustic ambiance, but food fell a bit short for the price and one Michelin star rating; best part of the meal was the wine and dessertMade a 6:30pm reservation on a Saturday about a week in advance for two people. Had been interested in trying The Musket Room due to its one Michelin star status as well as its unique New Zealand cuisine. The ambiance of the restaurant was cute and rustic, with hardwood floors, distressed white and brown brick walls, white wood paneled ceilings, wooden tables, deep cyan upholstery, and bright, natural light from the bay doors and windows at the entrance. I ordered a glass of malbec and my sister ordered a glass of rose to drink and then we both got the short story ($90):Focaccia bread with herb butter - although the flavor of the bread was good, it was neither warm nor fresh tasting (seemed a bit stale), which was a bit disappointingPowhiri: servo pie croquette, smoked cheddar, cauliflower tart, burgundy truffle, pork rillette, huckleberry jam, sage - these were presented as three small bites; all were very different with complex flavors and textures; I found them to be pretty goodKaimoana: Ora King salmon, horseradish yoghurt, Granny Smith apple - this was light and refreshing although a little blandPapatuanuku: quail, blackberry, bread sauce, roasted onion, New Zealand red deer, cilantro, juniper, celery root, fennel - the quail was cooked well with a nice sauce, but wasn't super memorable; I found the red deer to be a bit tough without much flavorRanginui: raspberry, pomegranate, olive oil, parsnip, white chocolate, blood orange - before the two desserts, we were given a palate cleanser--a grapefruit ""burst"" within a white chocolate shell, which was sweet, fruity, and refreshing; the raspberry sorbet with pomegranate foam on a bed of olive oil was sweet and delicious while the second dessert was beautiful in presentation, unique, and also deliciousWhile I liked the decor, wine, and desserts, I had high expectations for The Musket Room which unfortunately weren't met.

5.0,4/22/2018,"Entertaining those from other cities can sometimes leave you in a pickle: plan everything for your guest in advance or let them suss out what they want from the city. My guest seemed to gravitate more towards the latter for the 36 hours we had -- only requirement was, ""something I can't get at home."" Well, my friend, that will be most things. In our case specifically, that was the one-star Michelin rated Musket Room. I had a little concern about ""Western"" food not being NYC unique enough, even if Michelin rated, but then I realized I had never had New Zealand cuisine, let alone Michelin rated New Zealand cuisine. I am assuming there is no such things as Michelin rated New Zealand cuisine even in New Zealand. So, yeah, unique.Space: really has something for any occasion: date, business meeting, friends, whatever. It is classically casual with only minor finishings of kitsch just to let you know you are in a unique place (see: drinks). The two-tiered, railroad layout dining room, very nice. A+Vibe: they play Radiohead. 'nuff said. A+Service: Excellent, and on par with what it should be. Polite, attentive, and yet, keeping with its New Zealand roots, casual enough to make a drunk man in cargos or a lady in a pantsuit feel at home. A+Food: I rebelled and went against the recommendation for either long or short story, their (self-explanatory) set menus. Maybe more service-related, but I felt like this was pushed just a little too hard. Good intentioned, I am sure, as it was our first time there, but it seemed to persist a touch too long. Actually, yes, this is totally under the service category. B+REALLY, THE FOOD: went a la carte and was pleased with the dressed up bed of an otherwise very basic mixed salad. The tofu gnocchi was solid and thoroughly enjoyable, and I was grateful for a vegetarian-friendly dish, but I was hoping for a little more boldness to the dish (yes, tofu can totally be made bold). Dining companions had the short story with deer main entrée. Both were left incredibly satisfied and crowed about their meat conquest the rest of the evening. There was an assortment of small offerings provided to the table throughout the evening, which is always appreciated and the hallmark of a place this caliber. ADrinks: The bartender knows how to make a dry Manhattan. Also saw some tiki-type drinks being slinged.

2.0,4/15/2018,"The food is amazing, but the front of house needs some serious lessons in why this industry is called the ""hospitality"" Industry. I arrived with a coat and bag and was told my friend was not there yet, so I said I would wait at the bar. There were 2 free barstools. I put my coat on the barstool beside me because no one had offered to check it, I had a large and heavy work tote at my feet. The maitre D came over with a man and said are you waiting for someone, would you mind moving your coat, I said yes I was waiting for someone but we would move to the table when they arrive, and moved my coat. He guy ordered a drink and then got up and said he was going to wait outside, (why I don't know) He was gone about 5 mins so I thought he was done with the stool so I put my coat back. The maitre d rushed over and said, no really, that seat is taken, to which I said, Oh I'm sorry I thought he was done. AGAIN no offer to check coat. Come on! This is standard restaurant practice!He didn't come back for another 5 mins. Clearly the guy was someone important because both the bar tenders also were falling over him, while it took me some time to get their attention to order a drink while they stood there chatting with no other orders.I used to work as a waiter in a 3 star restaurant. It is not rocket science to figure out how to make people feel welcome. Here I was made to feel like I was in the way after only a few minutes. The wait staff in the dining room were fantastic however. And the food as always was great.I guess I wasn't some old moneyed guy, I was just a middle aged woman. But I do work in media and I work closely with many restaurant reviewers. That's the thing about customers, you can't make assumptions about who they are or what their circumstances are.

5.0,4/9/2018,"My boyfriend took me here recently to celebrate my promotion and the end of a very exhausting week. He definitely hit it out of the park with the restaurant choice! This place had been on my radar for a while given its Michelin Star status and positive press reviews, but I knew very little about it outside of that until our actual dinner.Musket Room is a New Zealand restaurant located in SoHo. The facade is unassuming, but leads into a very elegant, rustic-style bar and dining room area and a cute backyard with outdoor seating (closed given it's still freezing in April).I started off my meal with the Pencillin cocktail (scotch, lemon, simple syrup) which was strong, tasty, and refreshing. Perfect for letting me pretend that it was spring, and super sippable. For dinner, they have three options - a six-course ""Short Story"" tasting menu, an eleven-course ""Long Story"" tasting menu, or the a la carte. The entire table must participate in the same menu, and we decided on the Short Story, adding the scallops from the a la carte menu as an additional course. The tasting menus' progressions are themed to evoke Maori traditions, which are laid out on the first page of the menu.The menu changes constantly, so I won't go into details of everything that we had, but each dish was impeccably plated, well-thought out, and delicious. My favorites included the pork rillette, which was almost like a creamy meat mousse (so much better than it sounds, trust me); the New Zealand red deer, which came with the best roasted fennel I've ever tasted; and the parsnip cake dessert course. Service was also super friendly throughout our meal.The restaurant wasn't full despite us being there at prime time on a Saturday, but I hope that this place generates enough business to stick around for the long haul. The food certainly warrants it.",6,3,5,Yuting Z.,"Manhattan, NY",435,332,543

Had decided to make dinner reservations here based on the recommendations of coworkers who reported that the short story tasting menu was more than enough food and I'm glad we listened; we were incredibly full by the end. For us, the Short Story tasting menu consisted of 6 courses broken into the story categories of: Powhiri (Introduction), Kaimoana (Seafood), Papatuanuku (Land), and Ranginui (Sky/dessert). I hadn't known what to expect for New Zealand cuisine, but all of the dishes were intricately plated and delicious with interesting new flavors. Our favorite courses were the dry aged beef and the Ora king salmon. Their house made bread was also incredible, warm and soft, served with creamy butter.We were pleasantly surprised by an additional chocolate cake with a candle that accompanied our dessert course at the end.

This was probably the least enjoyable michelin star restaurant I've ever been to, which is quite a shame because I really liked the general atmosphere, service, and vibe.Long story short, your pear sorbet shouldn't taste like applesauce. Your chocolate musketeer bar shouldn't have a weird sour cream ice cream next to it (which was so bad I actually didn't eat it, which marks probably the first time in history I've failed to eat something I've been served at a restaurant. I'll eat basically anything). Your grouper shouldn't be accompanied by dry, tasteless vegetables (I'll admit that the grouper itself was good, but as a fish dish, so much depends on what it comes with).The best part of the meal was the bread.

4.0,2/6/2018,"I came to The Musket Room to have dinner with a friend recently, and although I'd vaguely heard of it previously, I didn't know much - making the fact that it had some New Zealand-inspired elements to the menu a nice surprise, given the fond moments I had from a culinary perspective over there. The entrance is a little off Houston, and it's got a very homey kind of feel to it, with lightbulbs hanging unadorned providing light and the dining room in the back giving off a bit of a rustic house feel with white paint over slabs of wood - making it feel a little farmlike, which would be in very much in line with a good deal of New Zealand's nature. The bar at the front is decently-sized and has a bit of a retro feel, while the main dining room in the back has some tables that have that typical NYC-style closeness. Our servers were pretty good, making the tasting course feel leisurely but not overly so. There's a very nice choice of wines from both New Zealand and elsewhere; I ended up sticking with a couple of the cocktails (both very good) and an IPA from Vermont...there were a couple of NZ-brewed beers, but having been there, beer is not their strong suit!The food here is served in a well-worn leather-bound cover, keeping with the rustic feel of the restaurant. You can choose from either a short tasting menu, a longer one (or 'story', as it's called here), or you can stick with a la carte. We went with the longer tasting menu, and I felt it was worth it - you didn't get stuffed (depending on how much bread you ate), and given the first few items on the menu are actually served together on a nicely-polished log as small bites, the portions also seem less daunting despite how many are listed. The first few bites were all quite delicious - the cauliflower tart with shaved truffle was very good, albeit with a crust that was a bit dense for my liking; the meat pie served as a croquette was extremely savory, more so than I would typically expect of this kind dish were it served as a pie; and a pork rillete that looked like a brown cream served on top of a cracker - but with the slightly textured feel of pork in it. Despite all being bite-sized, they each punched above their weight from a flavor perspective. Next up were some seafood dishes, and while I was excited about the king salmon, I actually found this one to be a bit disappointing. The texture on the fish was interesting - it was dusted with some kind of powder - but it really lacked the kind of bright, meaty flavor from New Zealand salmon and came out a bit on the plain side instead. The following dish with mackerel was much better, with the pear and celery giving it a clean flavor and allowing the sashimi-like freshness of the fish to really come through. The jalapeno adds a nice dash of heat without being too overbearing as well.From here, we moved to the dishes that had less of a meat or fish focus, and dare I say that I enjoyed these the best! The mushroom custard with mushrooms and truffles was phenomenal, with every bite filled with a bit of creamy earthiness, and the wisps of dill and cilantro gave it a hint of herbs without intruding too much. The next course was really unique and fan - an egg yolk served in broth with thyme and crunchier-than-usual trout roe. Stirring in the yolk made it creamy, but the roe gave it pinches of saltiness and crunch that made it a very unique souplike course. We finished up the main courses with grilled quail (a small serving but very delicious, with a hint of gaminess that makes it more distinctive than chicken) and the venison / red deer, which I really enjoyed - cooked better than some other venison I have had, and, in this case, with the gaminess a bit more muted, but with the au jus making it a very deliciously-finished meat course. We got 3 courses for dessert, although very reasonably apportioned; my favorite was the white chocolate served with pear juice inside, which came off as a clean, wintry bite without being overly heavy. The sweet potato cake infused with coffee and topped with a maple leaf was fun, albeit it a bit on the heavy side and not as light as either the chocolate or the goat milk yogurt that served to reset the palate.Overall, the food was very good all around, and I enjoyed a lot of the meal. The echoes of New Zealand are definitely there, if perhaps not as prominent in some instances (no lamb, for example), but objectively, the food stands on its own regardless of its regional inspiration. I'd probably come back to try an a la carte meal next so that I could try some different dishes. It is worth a repeat visit for sure.",1,0,1,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169

So, with no plans for Saturday, my partner secured a last minute reservation. Scurrying in from the cold, we were graciously greeted by two hosts, one of whom I later learned was Barbara, the co-owner and wife of the chef. She checked in on us midway through our meal and exuded the confidence and warm smile that comes from knowing they bring their A game every night. We sat down to a knowledgeable and enthusiastic bartender who explained the menu and drink selections. He made some suggestions and we weren't steered wrong one bit. From start to finish, The Musket Room, was a true dining experience that set itself apart. The prefix short menu was an experience not to be forgotten. Presentation was nothing short of four stars. But the taste....oh the taste. Delicately prepared quail was sublime. The red deer forced me to close my eyes and take a deep breadth as I savored every morsel.

We had to ask for detailed information about the food, and even then, it felt a bit like a hustle.The food was seriously underwhelming. The bread, I swear, was a DINNER ROLL. At one point after eating another dish doused in gravy and sopping it up with the DINNER ROLL we were feeling like we were at a church potluck, or revisiting the TV dinners of our childhood (think: Salisbury steak).Our server was very kind and brought us an extra desert, but honestly the pavlova was subpar.Ultimately the price was RIDICULOUS for the quality of food.

4.0,11/26/2017,"Chef Matt Lambert kills it on the finessed and well-executed New Zealand inspired cuisine - well deserving of his Michelin star. There are only so many other places in Manhattan that you'll find perfectly cooked venison or an interestingly curated, New Zealand focused wine list. Really love their warm and approachable take on fine dining. Overall my rating is predominated by the food/wine, as otherwise some aspects were a bit uneven (i.e. atmosphere, timing of food service, cocktails, etc.). Wish the softer aspects of the experience could make it to the same level the food itself achieves.Atmosphere- Prefer the front main dining area with it's relaxed, cozy/buzzy vibe, exposed brick and long walnut bar. Was filled with diners on a Friday night and had nice atmosphere. Have enjoyed it here before.- Garden Room in the rear, with rather bland decor, was pretty empty when we arrived, and felt more stiff and a tad awkward. Would have been better with more patrons, if guests had been more evenly spaced between the two so it had some buzz.- Generally, casual and comfortable - not uptight or stuffy by design.FoodWe really enjoyed everything we tried, the execution is top notch and presentation beautiful. All of the flavors Chef Lambert weaves together are so complimentary. If you order a la carte, note the portions are designed for multiple courses (i.e. an entree on its own wouldn't be much food).- Housemade Bread & Butter ($6): It's just bread, but very good start.- Quail (Blackberry, Bread Sauce, Roasted Onion - $15): Loved the flavors, but not very much meat, even for quail. Would have preferred slightly higher price and more quail.- Smoked Hudson Valley Foie (Beet, Manuka Honey Cake - $20): Perfect portion, not overly indulgent and well paired.- Long Island Duck Breast (Plums, Tokyo Turnips - $35): Nice rendering, fall flavors.- New Zealand Red Deer (Cilantro, Juniper, Celery Root, Fennel - $38): Amazing and cooked perfectly, something you don't get everyday. Cilantro a unique addition. Must try!- Hazelnut Cremeux (Chocolate Ganache, Garden Mint Ice Cream - $12): More decadent of the desserts, classic flavors and ultra smooth; really enjoyed the mint.- Passionfruit Pavlova (Passionfruit Curd, Whipped Cream, Strawberries - $12): New Zealand born, light and refreshing conclusion.BeverageStarted with a martini ($15) made as a I like, while my wife tried the Sweet As (Gin, Grapefruit, Grenadine, Sparkling Wine - $16) which was just alright. To our taste, not much on the cocktail menu seemed very alluring. Also note, the bar, as I recall, generally doesn't stock 'name brand' liquors. Do yourself a favor and skip right to their awesome NZ wines! With dinner, the 2012 Peregrine Pinot Noir ($87) from Central Otago, NZ was very nice. Cool to try the Seifried 'Sweet Agnes' Riesling ($16) from Nelson, NZ, a rare find, with dessert. Wine list is replete with unique, interesting New Zealand wines, don't miss the chance to try one!Service- A bit clunky.

It was a delightful dish with crab and roasted corn. Best dish of the night. *Portobello mushroom mousse | pickled honshimeji | summer truffle | herbs - this looked like a Coachella flower crown but it was very tasty. I love mushrooms so the mousse and the truffle really brought out the earthy goodness of shrooms. *The Aesop hand soap in the bathroom - I liked it so much that I visited the Aesop boutique to pick some up for myself. Of course, I ordered 5 dishes a la carte for myself, but they were pretty underwhelming:*Manuka smoked scallop | nashi pear | black garlic | cucumber - I felt like it was under seasoned and relatively flavorless. I've had better scallops. The smoke unveiled at your table is a cool tableside effect though. *Smoked Hudson Valley foie | beet | manuka honey cake - Presentation was fantastic! Reminded me of tetris. But, it was just okay. Maybe I don't like foie as much as I thought I did. *Quail | cherry | bread sauce | roasted onion - This is apparently a menu staple. The quail was tender, but nothing really stood out to me about it. My friend thought her roasted chicken dish was way too salty. Bummer. Also, not surprising but everyone at your table has to order the tasting menu in order to try it.

From the start booking the table was easy. The restaurant was very responsive to email for booking a large party. I also bought two small children with me as part of the group and they were very receptive to that. There is an area in the front of the restaurant that is good for large groups so that worked out for us. Our food came out to be slightly different from the menu they had on the website. For the first course, it seems like there should have been 4 canapes from the menu online but we received 3. The second course was salmon and it was delicious. The third course was quail which was also very good. For the fourth course we had a choice of cod or steak. I was disappointed the lamb from the menu online was not being offered. My husband got the cod and I got the steak so we tried each. I thought the steak was the better of the two. After that, came several courses of dessert all of which were pretty good. When the check came, the gratuity had not been added on. After I gave them the credit card, our waitress gave me the slip to sign and said ""by the way, the gratuity has been added on there."" I didn't say anything to her because I didn't realize it at the time but they had added that on without letting us know at any point.

Another manager helped us pick our first bottle of wine....expressed what type of Chardonnay I liked but was interested in trying a New Zealand wine since that is the origin of this restaurant! He recommended a superb wine and we took his recommendation on the 2nd bottle as well...however at some point during dinner I saw him open our bottle and pour a  bit in a glass for himself...probably 2 inches worth in a water glass and I was like WTF was that? So I called him over and called him on it...I said ""Did I just see you pour some wine out of our bottle and drink it?"" He looked a bit embarrassed and explained lamely that he wanted to taste it after it was opened for a bit to see if it still tasted ok! so that was a huge fuck up right there! Now to the food.....we did the short story food menu! Here's my assessment on that....the starter quad of petite apps were divine! Although the tomato gazpacho had a back end taste I didn't not care for....next the Ora King Salmon-beautifully presented but it was RAW and I was not aware (the manager mentioned at the very bottom of the menu it does say some items may be raw) if I were a server I would remind every patron of that fact per course to make sure they were ok with that...that being said they accommodated me fairly quickly with a mushroom tart dish which was sublime! Next was an addition of the foie with a marinated honey cake and beet purée-Divine!  Next was the quail with blackberries and roasted onions-Amazing! Then came the dry aged beef with truffle jus-Disappointing, chewy and inedible for me...had to spit out! The two deserts were beautiful and delicious!

5.0,10/19/2017,"This place is really special! Came here for our 5th year wedding anniversary and we had a great time. Their pre-fixe menus are very reasonably priced, but we opted to go a la carte since my wife had some dietary restrictions. We ordered the smoked scallop, corned lamb tongue and quail to start. The smoked scallop was a unique dish - it came out encased in a glass cover. When the cover was lifted, the smoke was released. The scallop was first poached then thinly sliced. The texture was more firm than I expected and the overall flavor was refreshing and bright.The corned lamb tongue was super flavorful - like a pastrami. This dish had a classic flavor, but an unusual cut of meat. I wouldn't have known this was the tongue of the lamb - it wasn't chewy like tongue usually is. My favorite starter was the quail. The outside was seared and it's had a slight crisp. The inside was juicy and delicious. The cherry and bread sauce nicely balanced out the savory quail.I opted for the New Zealand red deer for my main because I was intrigued. I've had venison before, but never one from New Zealand. The meat was served in three medallions. It was perfectly cooked and very good. I really liked the celery root and cilantro that accompanied it. My wife had the Arctic Char. The fish was served with an insanely crispy piece of skin. It was amazing! I bet they used a blow torch to get that precise amount of crisp without burning the skin. She loved her dish.OH! One last thing - I almost forgot to mention the freshly baked bread! They serve you a perfect round loaf of sourdough bread before your meal and it's one of the best pre-dinner breads I've ever had. Overall this is a great place for a nice night out or a special occasion. I hope to be back soon!",1,0,0,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",288,574,317
5.0,9/30/2017,"The Musket Room is as close to perfect a dining experience can get. Food is delicious and memorable, and the service is impeccable. Had the pleasure of having the tasting menu for the second time - small bites, but huge, unique flavors, and so very, very reasonably priced. The quail, especially, has staying power (and I hope to return to have more of it!) A special thank you to the manager, Sean, who handled a slight snafu so kindly and generously.

Opted out of the wine pairing not because of the money but because I wanted cocktails instead.  The cocktails were delicious and robustly flavored perfectly while still being strong enough to get a nice buzz going. Their names for the cocktails were unique too. This New Zealandic resturant takes you through a portal of food from each region of the country if you get the long story.  It was just perfectly filling enough but not too much once finished. This place has 1 Michelin star and should be proud of that, they deserve it. The staff was all funny and happy yet very professional. I loved the everything! Great place for a anniversary date, I wouldn't use it for a first date unless you want to set a precedent of spending a ton of money on someone each time you see them again lol.

I would recommend it to everyone I know.Before coming in for my reservation, I was contemplating whether to get the ""short story"" or the ""long story"" but decided to go for the ""short story"". Since I eat A LOT, I was worried that the short story would not satisfy my hunger but I was WRONG! I went home stuffed! From the bread they served at the beginning of the course to the end, everything was delicious! Being a sweet tooth, I enjoyed the multiple plates of dessert. The chocolate truffle they served, cracked as I bit into it, as all great truffles should, and was filled with salted caramel that melted in your mouth. The sorbets served with each dessert was so fresh and light. None of the plates were over nor under seasoned. Everything was just perfect!

3.0,9/4/2017,"Three stars review is just based on the short story tasting menu and phone reservation service. First, if you call to reserve they won't keep a note about any of your special request. Such as where you prefer to be seated or party event. They forgot mine. The phone call made me feel they were impatient to answer your questions and wanted finish conversation lol. That's fine I understand they are super busy.When it comes to the short story tasting. The food didn't surprise me that much. I can tell dishes were inspired by Asian fusion and Asian cuisine. I've been eating tons of Asian food so the dishes are like like western fine dining presentation but with flavor of dumpling fillings and Cantonese roast meat. I left  short comments for all the dishes in my photos uploaded here if you're interested.All in all, the short story tasting menu makes me feel most dishes are premade, reheated and then put together for cute presentation. They were served very fast one by one to our table but not explained very well. Service is basically good and courteous. But the food is just okay. I recommend it to people who've been eating salad or pasta for their whole life but never eaten any fine cooked Asian food :)",0,1,0,Daniel S.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,70,178
4.0,8/29/2017,"I took my boyfriend to the musket room for his birthday. The restaurant decor is beautiful. There is exposed brick, which is really pretty. We started off with a cocktail called sweet as. We enjoyed the drink. We decided to do the short story menu, which consisted of 6 courses. Overall, we enjoyed the meal. To be honest, I wasn't blown away and I was expecting that I would be. The presentation of the dishes were beautiful. The food tasted good, but again, it didn't blow me away. I wasn't a fan of the mackerel because it was fishy and I don't like that taste. The quail and pork were delicious. I also really enjoyed the heirloom tomato gazpacho. The service was very attentive and we appreciated that. At the end, they gave us a print out of the menu and truffles in a box to take home. That was a nice touch.

3.0,8/21/2017,"I was really excited to try this restaurant since it was given one Michelin star and New Zealand cuisine is something new to me. I went with a few friends and we opted for the Short Story set menu, which was $85, and to be honest, we all left kinda disappointed. The food wasn't as flavorful as we were hoping/expecting, it was was either bland or over seasoned and nothing in between. But the one point of mention, I really thought the service was great, it was super polished and very attentive. Short Story:POWHIRIHeirloom tomato gazpacho- The Gazpacho was great, it was super light and refreshing with a hint of carrot flavor. Mince & cheese- It was like a pork croquette, it was made well but it was really small, it was single small bite. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Pork rillette | huckleberry- The rillette was kinda like a mind fuck, it really felt like I was eating whipped cream but with a very strong essence of pork, this was a lot of fun. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Ham | egg- This was one of my least favorite dishes, the quail egg was just a boiled quail egg that was pretty boring, bland and room temp. yelp.com/user_local_phot…KAIMOANAManuka smoked scallop | nashi pear | black garlic | cucumber- The idea of the smoked scallop was great, the scallop itself was really fresh and I really loved the texture of the scallop but the scallop wasn't as naturally sweet as I was expecting and the dish was screaming for some salt. yelp.com/user_local_phot…PAPATÙÀNUKUCorned lamb tongue | nanas mustard sauce | croutons- The lamb tongue was really tender, it kinda had a softness like the way a pate would, but there was a kinda off putting gaminess to the lamb that I was not in love with. The nanas mustard complemented the lamb well but the lamb came off really salty. The croutons are usually a welcome addition but the croutons here were oddly hard, not crunchy, hard. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Berkshire pork | black pudding | kale | tomato- The pork was nice and tender but had a very distinctive ham like flavor. I enjoyed the flavor of the pork but the pork itself came off salty as well. The black pudding was an interesting pairing since it was crunchy kinda like a crouton. I thought the tomato compote was a great addition. yelp.com/user_local_phot…RANGINUIPassionfruit- I personally really enjoyed the passion fruit dessert, it is like a passion fruit sorbet but it is so in your face since it is extremely tart and very intense. If you love passion fruit, this is a must. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Chocolate mousse | raspberry sorbet- The chocolate mouse was nothing to write home about, it seemed like a standard chocolate cake, the raspberry sorbet was good, though. yelp.com/user_local_phot…",10,6,7,Ben L.,"Queens, NY",978,1001,2785
5.0,8/18/2017,"Went here on a Friday with my family.  We went a la carte.  I ordered the Spanish mackerel for one  appetizer; it was extremely soft and sashimi-esque with an added sauce poured on top.  The foie gras was very rich and practically liquid in consistency; many different flavors were presented on the plate.  My main course was the New Zealand deer, which was phenomenal as the taste resembled more like a well cooked steak and had no game-iness at all.  The sourdough bread was also excellent and felt very fresh.  Overall service was excellent as the servers were attentive to refilling water and explaining the dishes.  They even offered my sister (a vegan) an option (a tofu gnocchi, I believe) which wasn't on the menu.  The only drawback was the time between courses get protracted, but it was understandable considering the amount of detail displayed in the facility (the check was presented in an elegant box with the restaurant's name engraved).",0,0,0,Ken W.,"Forest Hills, NY",27,234,810

Additionally, one should know there is only one bottle of wine that is less than $100 and that bottle is $89.The dishes are so insanely small - we were all starving after this meal.

The ingredients are fresh, the pairings and flavors a little unusual, and the atmosphere is dreamy. The service also stands out because it's attentive but not at all overbearing - you almost don't notice your plates are being taken, but they always ask if you want your beverage refilled which I think is so much classier than the overbearing overfilling that happens in a lot of places.

5.0,7/21/2017,"I meant to write this review weeks ago when my boyfriend went to the Musket Room for his birthday. This was probably my favorite dining experience I've had in New York. Not only is the food amazing, innovative, and perfectly prepared/presented but the service is outstanding. My boyfriend and I agree that Denny was hands down the best, most thoughtful, most professional waitress we have ever had. My boyfriend has a severe lactose intolerance and Denny was quick to recommend dishes that he could eat, and kept an eye on our orders as they were brought out to make sure he was gobent the correct things. Not only that, but I had forgotten that when I made the reservation I mentioned that it was my boyfriend's birthday and even though we didn't order dessert after dinner (because we didn't notice and dairy free options) she brought out sorbet with a birthday candle in it. Denny absolutely made our night. I hope by the way I'm getting her name right, I accidentally threw out the receipt but I'm pretty sure I'm remembering correctly. As for the food, everything was fantastic. We couldn't do the long or short story because they couldn't make the tasting menus dairy free, but we ordered several of the starters and our mains. The scallops with grapefruit was one of the best things I've ever eaten. My boyfriend preferred the foie gras (also excellent). For mains we both had the duck with plums and turnips which was, again, flawless. We didn't have wine because we weren't in the mood for it, but the wine list looks great and has a selection of New Zealand and Australian wines that you won't find anywhere else.

I highly recommend choosing the tasting menu with the suggested wine pairings. The delight of the meal from the first bite continues through the entire experience - and it is an experience. The restaurant decor adds to the charm - humbly inviting, a feeling of cozy escape from the stresses of the city. When seated in the back, conversation is easy and a view of the outdoor garden reminds you of the care put into freshness in flavor and the surprise found in Matt's culinary creations.

2.0,7/2/2017,"Okay, this is one of those trendy and pricey spots in NYC that if transplanted to another location (or time) would go out of business. I had the duck and it was served raw. Notjust cooked right, and kept tender (I have had duck at many many different restaurants and know a good moistly prepared duck)... it was raw. I unfortunately had a bite or two (it was dark in the dining area) before sending it back. The replacement dish was burnt... okay...Wife's dish was underwhelming but the bill was not. Based on this experience, I cannot lump this restaurant with the price tier it ""competes"" with. Maybe clueless hipsters like it but I wouldn't eat here at even half the price. The one redeeming point -- the waitress removed both attempts of serving me an entree from our bill. I gave her the savings back as an extra tip because the service was actually very good.

5.0,4/24/2017,"The Musket Room has been on my list since its 2013 debut. It was actually one of the first restaurants I bookmarked on Yelp. The pictures looked great, the food looked great, and my uncle is a born-and-bred Kiwi so it made good sense. But I never seemed to find an occasion to make a reservation until this past weekend. I'm the type of person to save up any presents for future use because redeeming things is fun. The boyfriend, knowing that 90% of my money goes towards food, got me a ""fancy dinner certificate"" for Hanukkah last year and I'm happy to report that I put it to good use. Musket Room is a fabulous venue for when you're looking to venture out of your comfort zone in the food and wine arenas. Plates are inventive, aesthetically gorgeous and of course, yummy beyond belief. The venue itself is homey and beautiful. There's a massive, live cherry blossom tree spilling out from the bar area, lots of natural elements and warm lighting. The food might be fancy but the decor makes you want to cozy up in a corner and stay awhile. Probably a good thing, because you'll almost certainly stay longer than you intended.The Musket Room offers two tasting menu options: the ""Short Story"" ($85/pp) and the ""Long Story"" ($145/pp). An a la carte menu is also available, but I highly recommend the tasting route if it's in your budget. If you do opt for the Long Story (as we did), don't expect a quick night. When all was said and done, we spent about 2.5-3 hours at Musket Room. The timing was pretty much spot-on as far as courses go, giving us enough time to enjoy/reflect/digest between dishes. If you have the funds for the wine pairing option (there's both standard and premium options), it's highly recommended here. Musket Room boasts one of the best wine selections in the city, many coming from New Zealand (and like I mentioned, I'm partial to anything from New Zealand because my uncle is one of the coolest people ever). I ended up trying just one glass, which was medium-bodied and delicious. Definitely piqued my interest in terms of NZ wine.A note for those uninterested in wine: they've got decent cocktails here, too. I tried three--a spicy, rum-based drink served in a mule cup (delicious), a scotch-based cocktail that was perfectly well-balanced, and a gin/lemongrass drink that I could've done with out. They can't all be winners! No updated menu on the website, so hopefully this gives enough guidance. The Long Story at Musket Room is divided into five parts. Three savory courses, going from lightest to heaviest, and two sweeter courses, one more substantial than the other. Musket Room gets five stars because virtually every plate was inventive, thoughtful, beautifully presented (flatware included) and tasty beyond belief. Expanded our horizons in a tactful way. In most reviews, I tend to grade each dish and give some idea of what I liked/didn't like. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on what seat you're in) there's a character limit on Yelp reviews so my typical format is simply not feasible. I'll stick with grades and rapid fire notes. Eats, below:POWHIRI: All courses arrive at once--the crowd warmers of the evening, though far more credentialed than any crowd warmer you'll find at a late-night show.

3.0,4/8/2017,"3.5 starsOverall an enjoyable experience and I liked the way they played with the flavors in some of the dishes. But at the end of the day, wasn't a memorable enough meal that I'd want to come back for.I had:Scallops - I was surprised when I realized that this was actually raw scallops - which were good, but found the appetizer to be a bit underwhelming. I heard that the mushroom appetizer was really good so I regret not getting that one. Venison - I had to order this in addition to my set menu because they refused to allow me to order it in the place of my entree. I enjoyed the foam that was on the edges of the dish and the deer itself was fairly tender and light in flavor, almost reminded me of beef, and a lot less gamey than the other versions of deer I've eaten before. Chicken and egg - I actually really enjoyed this dish, the chicken was very tender and flavorful and loved the way the egg mixed in with the savory flavors at the bottom of the plate. Also probably one of the larger serving sizes. Cod - The fish was very tender and delicious.Pear Pistachio cheesecake - This was by far my favorite dessert of the bunch, and I loved the way the pistachio sauce mixed in with the cake and this sweet crisp that was layered on top of the cake. The cake didn't take cheesecake-y at all to me, which is a plus in my book since I dislike cheesecake. Citrus Pavlova - I found this dish to be too tart in general, with lemon on top of lemon. Perhaps it would be better with different flavors. For a restaurant of this caliber, I was a bit surprised by how often they messed up the orders. As in every course, they gave someone the wrong order and then we had to switch the plates around. Also dislike that when you come in a large group, you're forced to order off the set menu instead of their normal menu.",3,0,0,Jenny W.,"New York, NY",22,768,133
3.0,4/3/2017,"Went for their tasting menu, attracted by their Michelin star. Overall the food tasted good. Serviceably good. But nothing blew my mind away. Of all the dishes on the long menu, the diver scallops was the most interesting. But, the chef missed putting uni in the dish as written in the menu. Pretty embarrassing for a Michelin restaurant. The wait staff missed it, the chefs missed it. We had to ask several times, pull up our photos of the dish to prove our point... The manager apologized profusely and offered to buy our table drinks. I said I don't really drink alcohol as I'm slightly allergic. To which he brought us tequila yuzu cocktails. Puzzling choice. In summary, food was good, but their second Michelin star will probably prove elusive.",1,0,0,Ruth O.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",116,17,572

5.0,1/4/2017,"Amazing restaurant.Came here for an anniversary date with a reservation at 6:30. We opted for the ""long story"" (an 11-course meal) and didn't end up leaving until 4.5 hours later. Heads up: It's also $155 per person, not $125 as the menu on Yelp reflects.  The entrance is very awkward in the winter since there isn't much wiggle room in between the two doors for the entrance. There is also no separate space for the host; as soon as you walk in, you are in the dining room/bar. The host does coat checks though. I'm still a newbie when it comes to fine dining but I know good food when I eat it.The meal consisted of the following:POWHIRI (Introduction)-First course: Oysters, black pudding, eggs (I'm guessing quail eggs?), potatoes with trout roe, and squash. This easily takes a spot in the top three dishes of the night. There was nothing here that I did not enjoy. For some reason, the squash isn't listed on the menu.KAIMOANA (Seafood)-Second course: tuna with flavors of dashi. (In case anyone wants to know, the tiny gelatinous cubes are soy sauce.)-Third course: cod with brown butter. Very flavorful, but didn't leave a lasting impression.PAPATUANUKU (Land)-Fourth course: Mushroom custard. This included little white mushrooms that were sort of sweet and sour and little corn chips. Didn't care too much for this either.-Fifth course: veal sweetbreads with kumquats and cauliflower puree. So delicious. Also up there on the list.-Sixth course: Quail with blackberries. This was also good, but not terribly mind blowing. I was not happy that I had to flag down our waitress to ask what it was because the person who brought the plate over didn't let us know what the dish was. -Seventh course: deer with some sort of green puree. RANGINUI (Sky)(Desserts from here on.)-Eighth course: A praline ""ice cream sandwich"" with gold leaf.-Ninth course: Kiwi and lime sorbet. This had a strange sourness that slightly resembled an actual kiwi but didn't taste as good as the actual fruit. My mouth puckered at every bite...-Tenth course: Citrus pavlova. I have mixed feelings about this one. I've never had pavlova before - there were a lot of firsts for me that night - but once I got used to the texture, it was one of the better desserts served.KA KITE (Farewell)-Eleventh and final course: Five bon bons presented on a miniature log: chocolate-covered marshmallow, bacon-caramel white chocolate bon bon (super sweet), praline bon bon, and I forgot what the other two were. At this point, I was actually kind of tired and wanted to just take the bon bons home. Our waitress did ask if we wanted some tea ($6 for a pot), which definitely helped. I wish that she asked us earlier though. I'd definitely come back for a special occasion or to treat myself one day. I'm glad to have tried the long story but a short story (or a la carte) would probably be better for me next time. There are items on the short- and long-stories that aren't on the regular menu, if that helps you decide which way to go. Side note: they will ask if you'd like more bread, but after the first batch, I feel like each one after is progressively worse. (They probably want you to feel special by offering more bread but without giving the same quality as the first one to deter you from asking for any more.)",11,1,2,Aimee L.,"Mastic Beach, NY",145,117,573

BALL OUT BABY!!!! I made reservations for 7pm and arrived earlier, but was quickly seated. GREAT ambiance (dim lighting with a rustic, romantic feel), but I felt a little underdressed coming from work. We both opted for the ""long story"" tasting menu and did not realize how LONGGGGG it was! Dinner lasted 3+ hours!! Although the food was interesting and delicious, we had to flag down the waiter to speed things up! While making reservations, I made sure they knew it was his birthday so we got a little something extra (food) on the side, which made it that much more special. The food was different (in a good way) and each course kept getting better. Because the menu does change, I think a few of the menu items do remain similar if not the same (my favorite: oysters, snap peas, and quail). My favorite part of the tasting menu was def the ""appetizers"". In the middle of our meal, we were pulled outside to meet the cooks/owner (???) who made us something fresh out of their garden while enjoying a nice glass of local wine/beer. It was a nice touch and experience. By the time our last ""entree"" came, we were both too full to finish it, but still had dessert to go!

I felt like I could have eaten the quail in one bite if it weren't for the bone. It was nicely plated. The veal, also came out very nicely. It was a little gamey, but it had this delicious green sauce, so I forgot all about the gameyness and smothered it in that yummy green stuff. I think it may have been some sort of vegetable puree?

We all opted for a la carte menu because none of the main dishes we wanted were on the tasting menu. Oh well. We ordered the Salmon and Smoked Foie as starters, and Venison, Duck, and Cod as main. Smoked Foie was perfectly balanced - smoky but not overwhelming, picked apple added enough acidity, and whatever the crisps on the side was just right to eat with the Foie. Salmon was slightly unmemorable as I didn't recall any special flavors, maybe I didn't get all the condiments/sauces on the dish? I LOVED my duck, it was cooked perfectly. Huckleberry added enough sweetness and tartness to it, but not super sweet like some other places. I tried couple bites of deer, it was tender, flavorful, just perfect. For dessert, we shared pear/pistachio/cheese cake. If you like desserts that are not overly sweet, this is the one for you. It's more refreshing and tart than sweet, and it may be the least cheesy cheese cake I've had, the texture tasted more like a normal cake than cheese cake, not that I'm complaining, I actually liked it a lot.Anyways, great experience here, would be back.",14,13,13,Lu H.,"New York, NY",294,570,1967

The bread that they serve is something I'd like to sleep in every night.  Next was the deer and the cod with zucchini three ways. Here we had some more delicate, but still prominent flavors. What a lovely attention to detail!  I absolutely LOVED their serving-wear and really appreciated the music stand for the reservation book at the entrance.

Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our night and I'm glad we tried it, but there were a few aspect that left me a bit surprised that they had a star. Food (3/5) - everything was cooked perfectly, but the taste of the food was average. Some dishes being slightly better, some not so. Food gras, quail, and bone marrow dishes stood out. Eel was a fun composition. The reason these dishes stood out though, were primarily from the creativity (as reflected in the next category). Other dishes were difficult to get down for most of our party.Creativity (5/5) - the redeeming aspect of the dishes , was that I found them very creative and adventurous. They pushed the envelope in combining ingredients that don't typically go with each other. Sometimes this worked to their advantage; sometimes to their disadvantage, but this is why I get a tasting menu - to experience something new and inventive. I need to give them a lot of credit for this, because i imagine it's easier to stick with the status quo.Service (4/5) - everyone was very friendly and accommodating, but there were certainly a few times we were left wondering when our next dish would arrive or if we could get another drink.Decor (5/5) - love the humble cozy feel here. No white table cloths or pretentious settings. Come in to comfortably enjoy your mealPlating (5/5) - beautiful and clean plating. Nothing to complain about hereWine (4/5) - great som; fun pairings of New Zealand wines that I typically wouldn't  grab, but I wish there were more reds with the pairing and I was surprised that there were some dishes that came without pairings at the end.

From the first bite of the bread, we knew we were in for a treat. I noted in my reservation the day before that we'd be getting the short story (tasting menu), and that my date was a pescatarian. They happily accommodated this, and did so in grand fashion. We also got the standard wine pairing, which featured generous pours of a broad spectrum of styles that took the already-divine food to a whole other level.While my date was away from the table for a moment, one of the staff asked if this was a special occasion. I replied that no, it was just a date, and he replied well, that was a special occasion. I'm not sure if what happened later was as a result of this conversation, or if everyone gets to do this when ordering the tasting menu, but for the intermezzo, our server asked us to get up from our table and follow. We were led out back to a gorgeous grotto-like area, where a frozen slate was waiting with a pair of popsicles for us, and our wine glasses were brought out as well. We had the whole area to ourselves. and it was the most romantic thing ... ever. Seriously, it felt like we were in a movie. Before this turns into a novella, I'll just say that this will be hard to top. The service was friendly, enthusiastic and perfectly-timed. The food was rich, complex, unique, and bold at every turn. The wine was on point. The only negative is that I couldn't personally hug or high-five every staff member that made for a night we'll hopefully never forget.",4,1,0,Steve W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",52,42,0
3.0,7/16/2016,"Had been meaning to try here for sometime and what better occasion than to celebrate my fiance's bday! Made reservations for 740 wed night. We both ordered the long story version of the tastingmenu. Long story short (no pun intended) it really was a long story. we were one of the last to leave (not complaining). Couple things:a.) Our waiter had difficulty multitasking and remembering simple requests.. ie drink order?  Menu? B)going out to the garden area: how unique! except we were led there and the sous-chef said muttered something  and he was gone! Me and my fiance were like do we eat this now? Is he coming back?....well we helped ourselves to the beer that were chilling there thanks; )c.) odd moment was watching the couple adjacent to us cut their meal short cause the girl became ill (couldn't help but watch them leave) after their venture to the garden. Or was it the sea urchin?  Made us wonder....Overall, very cute presentation of food. creative...unique flavors..the sea urchin though tasted very seafoody/horrible aftertaste.. and service staff  (ie. our server) chick-fil-a has a better wait staff on consistent basis.",1,2,0,Philip P.,"Rahway, NJ",3,53,15

5.0,6/19/2016,"My boyfriend and I came here for our 1 year anniversary and it was our first experience dining in a Michelin rated restaurant and what an experience it was!  We felt comfortable from the second we sat down in their small dining room overlooking a very charming herb garden in the back.  The waiter took note of our ""allergy to alcohol"" and offered us a nice selection of nonalcoholic beverages, as well as ensuring us each time there was a dish that had some sort of liqueur used in it, that the alcohol had been completely cooked out.  We did the long story, 1p course tasting menu and everything was so incredibly delicious!  After the first few courses, we were invited into the herb garden to enjoy a small plate prepared right in front of us on an outdoor grill by the chef.  I will say that there was some miscommunication between the wait staff and the chef at this point, because when we came out he offered us a beer pairing with the plate.  However, this was by no means a shortcoming.  I am in the service industry and am very well aware that miscommunication and mistakes happen, we are all human!  However,  it's how you recover from these mistakes that make or break the experience and the chef and maitre de were genuinely apologetic and brought us a beautiful ginger beer instead, which we were most grateful for.  From start to finish, the dining experience was not too pretentious, but just right.  All the staff were knowledgeable on the culture of the New Zealand origins and stories behind every dish, and it was an absolute pleasure.  We wouldn't have had it any other way and are looking forward to bringing my parents back there.",0,0,0,Caity t.,"Manhattan, NY",136,5,0

I made reservations and we were seated promptly by the hostess. I dressed up for dinner but I wouldn't say it's completely necessary; the decor is rustic (almost a little homey) and definitely not a frilly place. The restaurant was completely empty and it didn't fill up once whatsoever while we were there.Unfortunately, since a year has passed and their menu has changed (as it does, seasonally) I can't really recall each and every course. I do remember thinking that the dinner was solid and that The Musket Room was well-deserving of its one Michelin star.However, service left a lot to be desired. It took a while for our server to greet us at our table and while she was attentive enough, she was cold. No smiles, no warmth, no personality! Hm.

The bread they serve is always fresh and warm.  The dish with morel mushrooms with truffles is exquisite.  Very fulfilling dish with crispy pork before the dessert courses.  Wine: the wine pairing is great and interesting. Service: absolutely excellent. The servers are very attentive. Our water glasses were being refilled very frequently.  Midway through, there was a shrimp course with parmesan broth.  The server came over and check with us if everything is up to our expectations. He told us he was concerned if the broth was a bit too salty because he got that comment from a customer in another table.

He even substituted an item off the larger chef's tasting for me.Every course was divine. My father, who can be picky and prefers to select his own meals from menus most of the time, cleared each of his plates.

5.0,3/29/2016,"We booked The Musket Room for my best friend's birthday as I had read it offered one of the best tasting menus in New York City. The people on the phone was really nice and understanding when we phoned up a few times to push back the time - latest booking available is 9:30pm.As I had been eating all my meals out on this trip, we opted for the six course menu instead of the 10. We started with a Sad times. The ant man is not showing on this flight! - South Island Sling and Triple As. Our amuse bouche was a goats cheese foam over beetroot and crisped rye cubes - I just love cheese in a foam form and the crispy croutons and soft beets gave it an interesting texture. We went for some lovely homemade sourdough and brioche that was served with whipped butter and crisped herbs when we were offered. The first starter was oysters with radish foam and chive oil which was awesomely served in a bowl of pebbles and dry ice! It was soooooo cool! The oysters were really fresh and the flavours well balanced. The second starter was the BEST potato soup I have EVER tasted. First, it is served with chive oil and salmon roe in a bowl and a bridge of crispy bacon carrying a piece of the sweetest razor clam and the waiter pours this really creamy potato soup into the bowl at the table. The soup is velvety smooth and there is not one single grainy but in there! I have no idea how they did it! The combination of the soup and the roe was a flavour party in my mouth! I'd recommend ordering this of the a la carte menu! The first main was half a crispy quail - mini drum stick and wing included - that has a bit of five spice flavour served with cute little sweet roasted onions. The second main was also a firm favourite - the Berkshire pork which was a cube of roast pork belly confit and slices of beautiful smoked pork loin with kale, clementine segments and al dente cauliflower. The park was perfectly done and the textures were really beautiful. Our first dessert was a passion fruit sorbet served with crispy meringue and passion fruit purée. The second dessert was the chocolate brownie that was toppled with a salt caramel marshmallow and chocolate ganache, served with milk sorbet and mandarin jellies. I didn't think I would be fussed about dessert as I would not have gone for these options but both were really nice and neither was overly sweet.The atmosphere of the restaurant is really casual and a bit noisier than I expected because it has a bar in the main restaurant, but it was so relaxing and the staff were brilliant.

They open at 5pm but the dinner service doesn't start until 6pm. It was nice to be one of the first parties to arrive, we got all the attention! My fiance and u had their regular tasting menu which was $75/person. They started us off with an appetizer which was on the house and it had frozen wasabi (omg!), very refreshing. As the courses started coming in, they were small and I was worried a bit that the whole dinner is going to be over in 30 mins and we would walk out hungry and would need to grab a burger. I was wrong. The restaurant started getting filled up pretty quickly and courses were coming in with a bit of delay which was nice because it gave us time to enjoy our wine and talk a bit about our experience with each dish. All in all it took about 2 hrs and we were full! Oh and I also asked if I could substitute my pork entree with red deer and they said yes! My first time trying red deer and I LOVED it!

I tried the foie gras which was the pate style, where I usually like the seared type.  It was very creamy and delicious.  My friend enjoyed the scallops appetizer and I tried our other friend's quail, which was excellent but extremely small.  We all had a Bourbon or Rye cocktail and they were well made.  For entrees I had the duck breast which was spectacular.  My two friends had the red deer which was highly recommended by the waitress.  I had a bit and it was out of this world.  We skipped dessert because we wanted to continue our night at a nearby bar, Shorty's, and we were at the restaurant for a while since there was some delay between our appetizer and main dish.  I had never eaten at a place before which served New Zealand food, and I was a little surprised when there was no lamb on the short menu.  (The server said they have it on special at certain times of the year.)  I will definitely be back to this classy place and recommend it wholeheartedly.",0,0,0,Jim S.,"Ridgewood, NJ",5,65,0

Another half was because of the drinks- reasonable price but not tasty at all...We were excited to check this one out, it's always been on the list but finally! They have daily tasting menu 6 courses for $85. Not bad pricing, but if everyone on the table has to get exactly the same thing, I wouldn't do it. So we ordered a la carte so that we can try a couple more items:App: mushroom soup- a bit on the salty side but it's a delight; scallops- fantastically cooked, sides are also amazing.Main: duck- perfectly cooked and the carrot sauce was wonderful to tone down the heaviness of duck meat; salmon- a bit on the raw side but the taste was wonderful.Dessert: carrot cheesecake- didn't enjoy it as much as I thought.

I saw a lot of great reviews on yelp and I know they earned a Michelin star in 2015 and 2016 and they certainly deserve it so that's why I chose this for my wife's birthday dinner. We were both glad I did.Her b-day was on a Sunday night so it was quiet here, but the space is intimate and relaxing without any pretentiousness. The hostess was nice and sat us right away. Our server, Allison was fantastic, friendly and asked us if we had any questions. We started with a couple cocktails, both absolutely Delicious. Mine was the rye one and the wife's a cucumber drink that was outstanding and refreshing. For the meal! Anyone that says portions are small has never been to fine dining, they are usual portions and plenty for an average person if you go with the flow of the menu. I ordered the mushroom soup, duck and chocolate roll in total. The wife got scallops, cod and the carrot cake. Because I don't eat seafood we didn't opt for the tasting menu. The mushroom soup was fantastic, not to mushroom-y, a great balance of truffle, buttermilk and shitake 'shrooms. The duck, holy crap the duck, cooked PERFECT and each part of the dish was heaven the kale was amazing..kale?! Yeah the kale was one of my favorite parts. The carrot puree, everything jived perfect and I cleaned my plate. The desserts were both unbelievably delectable and perfectly balanced. My wife also loved hers equally. I also loved the mini macaroons with the check. I also have to mention the bread before hand, get the chedder brioche...game changing! After our first round we were asked if we wanted another, I of course said yes. When asked if we wanted a 3rd one, we declined, only because we didn't want to seem like goobers.

When my friend arrived, we ordered some wine and our meals.  Our server was spot on with his recommendations and the food was EXCELLENT, but the portions were unbelievably small.  I am a tiny person, and I left STARVING.  They offered to refill our bread order twice but never actually did.  Womp. My friend and I split two appetizers, an entree, and a dessert.  We ordered the scallops, the quail, and the cod.  They were all INCREDIBLE but ultra tiny.  The scallops were served with curry and cauliflower.  They were excellent - but there were only two of them.  $15.  The quail was slightly bigger - it was served with blackberry and roasted onion.  We both absolutely loved this dish.  $16.For an entree we got the cod which was served with pomegranate and brussels.  For an entree, I found this to be small as well, and it was $32.  For dessert we got the dish our server recommended, which was the maluka honey with milk, walnut, and little pear croutons.  We didn't love this but it was an interesting dish.  Reminded me of a panna cotta.  $13.All in all, the food was 5 stars, but the portions were just too small.  I can appreciate quality food and understand that it comes with a price tag, but for the number of dishes we got and how small of a person I am, I don't think it's acceptable to leave a restaurant hungry, especially when your total bill clocks in at over $100.  Although I would love to try the other items on the menu, I'm not sure my wallet can handle it.",2,2,0,Jenn P.,"Manhattan, NY",285,134,933

Warm intimate ambience, incredibly gracious and attentive service (from hostess to waiter - our waiter took time to walk us through very informed recommendations on both food and beverages)...and last but not least - such beautifully presented, artistic, and delicious food. We had and loved the scallop and quail appetizers, and the duck and chicken entrees. Highly recommend all of these (even the chicken! And we never order chicken at restaurants - it was so tender it was almost like eating a different meat!)- my favorites were the scallop and duck. The portion sizes are not huge - recommend at least one appetizer and entree per person vs. splitting, but combined with the three different breads we had over the course of the meal we felt perfect (not hungry and not too full) by the end of the meal the carrot cake dessert was fabulous - and was uniquely nut free (my husband has an allergy) and I would have ordered a second I liked it so much. Not inexpensive but for a meal like this which feels like an event and that is so visually and tastebuds  satisfying - thought it was 100% worth it.",0,0,0,Arjun S.,"Manhattan, NY",8,54,1

5.0,12/25/2015,"I gotta say, this was the best dining experience I have had in recent days.  Everything worked out perfectly.  My wife and I made a last minute reservation here because they had a spot at 9:15pm of the christmas eve.  This place is located around SoHo, right across Manhattan Portage Flagship store (which is another favorite store of mine).  The interior was very rustic, and seemed like they utilized an existing interior from before, but I thought it was pretty nice.  Really liked the rustic brick wall.We were seated on a corner of the front room (there is a back room with more dining tables).  Asked for virgin mojito, which was limey and good, but I would have liked it a little better if the drink had more mojito flavor.  They had fresh baked bread, sourdough, rye and cheddar brioche.  I asked for brioche and rye, and it came with cream cheese.  Bread was very soft, and tasted really good.For the first course we ordered veal sweetbread and scallop with wasabi sauce.  The scallop was amazing in that chopped pieces of scallop mingled perfectly with wasabi, and made a very unique flavor.  Veal sweetbread with huckleberry sauce and fried green leaves were very well balanced, too.We ordered lamb tenderloin and duck breast for entree and both of them were amazing, but in different context.  First lamb was cooked to perfection itself.  Chef also basically got rid of the strong smell of lamb but left the aroma which stimulated your nostril perfectly with the flavor.  As for the duck, it was medium rare cooked, and it worked perfectly with the sauce.  The only thing is that it would have been even better for me if the turnip was a little softer.For dessert we ordered cheese plate which came with some bread chips, huckleberry sauce and quince spread.  I really liked the balance.  Then the milk dessert, looking like pana cotta, was a great way to end our very satisfying dining experience.Bottom line.  This place definitely should get more credit than they do now.  I will definitely come back in the future.",0,1,1,Jay I.,"New York, NY",260,683,192

3.0,12/14/2015,"I went to The Musket Room on Nov 17 2015 for my wife's birthday.  I had made reservation the previous day for the chefs tasting.  I walked into the restaurant excited and with a big smile on my face only to receive an unwelcoming vibe.  I believe the host (or hostess) was busy when we walked in, which is completely understandable however I waited for nearly 7 minutes without my wife and I being acknowledged by any of the staff members.  I made eye contact with the bartender (whom looked like Thor) that was standing the closest to the entrance about 2 to 3 times as I nicely smiled and he literally looked away and ignored our presence.  As soon as that happened I told my wife is I had to wait one more minute without any greetings or acknowledgement I would leave and take her to another restaurant.  Within a few seconds of me grunting to wife a gentleman walked up to us and asked if we have been helped, that was when he apologized for the wait and followed by the question if we had any reservation.  I quickly affirmed that I had made reservations the previous day and told him my name.  As soon as the host checked my reservation and realized I had booked the Chef's Tasting which costs $145 per person it seemed like his eyes lit up a bit and I felt treated slightly better.  We were directed to a back room where I believe the tastings takes place.  My wife and I were already feeling slightly set back from the unwelcoming entrance.As soon as we sat down the chef sent us a complementary plate of beets. The waitress approached the table and she was extremely sweet, very kind, cute girl with a lisp which reminded us of our niece so we felt a bit delighted to have her as our server.   I decided to order a bottle of wine so the sommelier who seemed slightly snobbish but helpful nonetheless assisted us on choosing a bottle that catered to a taste as close as possible to what I wanted (the bottle was a New Zealand Syrah).  We ended up having a total of 11 courses and the only dish I didn't like was the oyster since it tasted it like pure vinegar.  The deep fried bone marrow was to die for I must be honest.  After I asked the sommelier for an advice on a glass of with wine to accompany some of the dishes since we had a bottle of red he gave us a free glass of prosecco from New Zealand that was very low on the acidity and it was rather creamy. It paired so well with the bone marrow, absolutely delicious.It's understandable the reason why the portions are small since it was 11 courses in total however it were incredibly small to the point where we left the restaurant hungry.  I tried to look at it as more of an artistic/culinary experience rather than a dinning experience. I also wished the lighting was slightly dimmed, it was too bright I didn't think it was romantic at all.Would I do it again?  Absolutely not.Reasons why? Because my wife and I felt awful upon arrival by not being acknowledged by any staff member so that left a really bad imprint, also I was disappointed with the size of the portions.  Def not worthy of the $540 check I paid!!!",1,0,0,Will V.,"Jamaica, NY",0,3,0

1.0,12/13/2015,"I wish it was possible to give 0 stars to this horrid place. Big mistake picking this place for a very, very special occasion.Booked a table for 7 over a month ago for the 9pm seating at the Garden Room. I even asked the entire group to be there for 8:45 (which was a feat in itself!) to be courteous to the restaurant so they can seat us altogether on time. Unfortunately, this restaurant did not share the same sentiment when it came to timeliness and courteousness.Our Garden Room table was not ready and they tried to pull a fast one on us and tried seat us at the front of the restaurant which we did not find acceptable. They said that they did not want to kick out the party before us who was there since 6pm and was clearly overstaying! They went as far to say that they will kick them out if I asked them to! Clearly they do not know how to manage their tables and timing.We finally got seated at 9:30pm. I had a holiday party afterwards which I missed because we were still there close to 1am. I can't say much about ambience when you are the only ones left eating at a place!The food was mediocre at best and does not deserve even a shadow of Michelin star. The portions were tiny (I must have eaten 5 pieces of bread to keep myself from fainting) and the taste and texture was not impressive by any means whatsoever. The price tag definitely did not justify such poor cuisine and service.I deeply regret hosting a special occasion at this mismanaged, poor excuse of an establishment.

5.0,11/30/2015,"When I first walked into The Musket Room I was immediately overcome with a sense of calm. The restaurant was perfectly lit with beautiful music playing softly in the background. Having travelled to New Zealand, I was in search of a place in the city that would provide me with a small taste of my beautiful experience on the island. The Musket Room was it! Strike up a conversation with the bartenders over a perfectly made cocktail. Be sure to explore the wine menu which effortlessly takes you to every region of New Zealand and beyond. And then there's the garden room which overlooks the backyard where their herbs are freshly grown. Stunningly cozy! I'd recommend the tasting menu to experience the full range of what The Musket Room has to offer. The Chef's Tasting Menu is certainly the way to go. It is easy to get lost in the food; it commanded my full attention, as it should. The pork is a no-brainer!At The Musket Room you'll never feel rushed. The idea of slow food is honored. 'Lentamente' as they say in Italy. The staff is extremely attentive and can explain every element of the menu. Furthermore, the owners of The Musket Room are always present. I find this to be particularly important when dining. They're so invested in their establishment and take great pride in providing their diners with an exquisite, quality evening.

We decided to go all out, Chef's tasting, wine tastings, etc etc. I have to say $700 later, I was left very underwhelmed and not appreciated. Every dish was barely described to us by a guy that didn't know what he was talking about. The wine pairings were off schedule and we were constantly looking for a waiter to get another drink. Our initial cocktails took almost an hour to deliver and one of them was one we did not even order. Every waiter didn't seem to care about our table and everything seemed disorganized. If I would have known that this was going to be the experience I was going to receive, I would have gone to a restaurant such as Del Posto that would have cared that we were there. We were at the restaurant for almost 4 hours not because we wanted to be but because we waited that long for every course and every drink. I still don't know what we ate because no one really explained anything to me. Sadly, I will never return. The worst part is that that I reached out to the restaurant and they never took a moment to contact me.

This Saturday night the only option we were given was the tasting option... pushed specifically into the chef tasting option as we could not mix the smaller option with the larger. ""You can't mix the two as the chef doesn't want others not to eat while others are eating...."" Over about 2+hrs little bits were brought out which the waiters struggled to explain what they were. On average they were good, but not great. They were made better though by the expensive cocktails we had through out the night once we were actually able to get the waiters attention to order.The biggest shock of the night was the actual bill. Myself and friend looked at and broke out into hysterics..... literally the tab was over $200 each + tip brining the bill to over $1k! Yes that's right...

The sommelier is incredibly knowledgeable and gave us a list of the wines that we had over the course of dinner. I would recommend going on a quieter night, when you can get a more customized experience. Coming with a large group is also a huge plus, as it allows the somm to open some of the rarer bottles (we went with 8 people, so we finished a bottle each course).

I'm so glad that I have ordered the regular one as it turned out to be a big meal!Out of the six dishes, my favorite was for sure the chocolate cake with sorbet even though it came out at last. I also enjoyed the pork with crispy crust as it reminded me the pork dish back in Hong Kong.

5.0,9/8/2015,The musket room offers a $75 dollar tasting menu which is more affordable in comparison to other restaurants of this quality. It started off a bit shaky as the first course was just three sprigs of food.. lol. My boyfriend and I were afraid we'd be hungry by the end... However most of the other courses were phenomenal and by the end we were comfortably full. (The pork belly was my personal favorite course)  I've never really had New Zealand cuisine so this was a pleasant first experience.The interior is minimal and well lit. I definitely don't prefer the lack of light in most restaurants. They even have Aesop products in the restroom which I found to be a nice luxurious touch.Service was very attentive.

However, our client had to sit through the entire meal with a soaked suit and myself with a drenched dress - both smelling of alcohol.  It was rather embarrassing but we tried not to make a big deal of it.  The waitress was very apologetic as well and we felt bad for her. I was especially embarrassed since we were hosting the meal for our clients.However, on reflection, at the end of the evening or even as soon as it happened, there was no offer from either the waitress or restaurant manager to do something - anything to make-up for this experience.  At the very least, they should have offered a complimentary bottle of champagne or wine for the inconvenience but offered nothing, which was incredibily disappointing.  They even charged us for the bottle that they spilled all over us! I should never have tipped them either but did not want the rest of the staff to be penalized for an unfortunate experience.  Although, mind you, they happily took the tip as well!  We really should have made a bigger deal at the time but I did not want to make a big scene in front of my clients - it was bad enough that they were soaked in alcohol.  To be fair as well, a real five star establishment would have been more proactive without having to wait for clients to complain in order to launch into action.  Would never return.  Too many other better places to waste time here or money!",0,3,0,Phuong P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0

The place is really that good! My friend and I had the pleasure of doing the ten course tasting menu and each and every dish was different, beautiful to look at, and even better to taste. This is creative cooking at it's best. From the creme fraiche ice cream with caviar to the unbelievably good carrot desert, our delight grew with the plates continued to be put in front of us.

2.0,6/3/2015,"Disappointing experience. Food was not that flavorful, tiny portions even for a restaurant trying to be pretentious, service was subpar, and overpriced. Our waitress was not friendly or attentive, though the other staff was great filling water and bringing out food, etc., and didn't tell us about a bone marrow butter which apparently is off the menu, so now you know. Seemed like there was no management or direction to keep things running on point.The whole vibe here was just was, not warm, and the tiny portions and high prices just turned me off. This isn't Per Se Nolita but it thinks it is. They also nickle and dime you, for example I had a martini and they charged $2 more for it. I get some places do this but just seems to be an aggressive fleecing of patrons with that and the small portions. The quail appetizer ($16) was 4 bites and the Red Deer entree ($33) was 3 small medallions. Unfortunately wouldn't go back or recommend.",2,2,0,E. M.,"Manhattan, NY",14,135,72

The explanations were rushed, and the captain seemed to not care much about my table. I always had to call him over. That was disappointing. The sommelier saved my whole experience.

2.0,6/1/2015,"I ate there last Monday, my friend and I had 3 courses each, with wine. I ordered the: Cold smoked scallops | cucumber | pear | black garlic | sea beans 16Lamb | mint | Jerusalem artichoke | grains 35 Passion fruit pavlova | strawberries | cream 13 My friend had the foie gras, lamb and pavlova too.I awoke in the early hours of Tuesday morning incredibly nauseous and spent most of  Tuesday vomiting and with diarrhea.  It could only have been the scallops as my friend ate exactly the same other courses. Although the presentation was nice, the portions were incredibly small. I still felt somewhat hungry after the meal.  The lamb was also cooked medium despite me asking for and being told it was served medium-rare. The wine for $14 a glass was only filled to allow for two or three sips, not even half a glass.I wrote via Open table to express my utter disappointment at what was meant to be a celebratory meal, at a Michelin starred restaurant.   I received no acknowledgment from the restaurant whatsoever and having spent over $200 on our meal it would have to be one of the worst dining experiences I have had (I have eaten street food in countries across the globe and never once been poisoned!)UPDATE:The restaurant has since reached out to me and refunded my meal which is much appreciated.",2,0,0,Victoria F.,"Stirling, United Kingdom",0,20,4

5.0,5/27/2015,"After viewing pictures online I was afraid this food might be a little bit fussy, but thankfully I was mistaken. A rustic setting in Nolita keeps expectations low but you're in for a great surprise. They do have one Michelin star, which should tell you that the food here is sublime.This New Zealand team is incredibly focused on sourcing the best from their homeland. This includes wine's, meats and more.We decided to order a la carte but I'd be interested in trying the tasting menu in the future. Their bread was the first thing to hit the table. A warm soft brioche cheddar roll, was soft with a crispy layer of cheese on top and served with the creamiest salted butter that melted in our mouths. We decided to share everything. We started with the corn custard, and the quail. Be for warned that appetizers are quite small, and more just a bite to get you excited for your main course. The quail is one of their classic dishes and two drumsticks come out with cherries, bread sauce and roasted onions. A small bite, but a burst of incredible flavor. The corn was creamy and just as good. Then we had the foie gras torchon with granny smith apple, date and brioche. This was the best foie gras I've had in a very long time. It was so creamy and spread like butter on the brioche. For mains we had the chicken and egg, and the beef. The chicken was good with a runny egg served on top that turned into a sauce of sorts when sliced. The beef was wonderful. So tender and they poured a sauce over it table side. I would definitely order the beef again. We were blown away by the food. This is a great way to experience fine dining in more casual atmosphere. The reviews are spot on - this is an incredible NYC restaurant.",36,20,22,Brittany F.,"Los Angeles, CA",4564,1592,1644

5.0,5/5/2015,"Musket Room has one of the most innovative but approachable cuisines going in NYC right now. Pro tip: you can eat ala carte at the bar and usually get seated pretty quickly. I tend to stick with appetizers though the entrees are definitely worth having. If on the menu, trying anything scallop, venison, or smoked (vague I know, but they change the menu often). They take Cover which is a total plus and always makes me feel like a regular. PLUS they have THE BEST gluten free bread anywhere south of 14th street. It comes with a whipped butter that you'll be requesting more of the second you finish.",3,1,1,Michelle C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0
5.0,4/29/2015,"Perhaps it's because I'm not overly familiar with New Zealand cuisine, but I found the flavors quite adventurous. I recommend the tasting menu with the wine pairings, which were superb and amplified the taste of every course. Portioning for the six course tasting menu was perfect by NYC standards. Serving appearance was excellent. Service was responsive and informative.

Service was great and every dish that came out was like a work of art - just beautiful and colorful creations on a plate.  We didn't do the tasting menu - just a few items a la cart.  We had the oysters (I think I had a bad oyster because it was absolutely terrible but others at the table enjoyed it), smoked scallop - probably my favorite dish of the night, quail (tasted like chicken wings), foie gras (hard to go wrong), and cod (cod was good but green pea purée was bland).  Overall we had a great dining experience but I knocked off a star because the restaurant service and presentation of the dishes were more impressive than the actual taste of the dishes themselves.",1,0,1,Anna K.,"Manhattan, NY",5,20,57
3.0,4/25/2015,"The food is good,  I can't complain about that.  I got the cod which wasn't on the menu (they forgot to put it on that night the waitress told me). I also wanted the lobster app but that also wasn't on the menu, they omitted it, and I didn't ask about it.  When the cod came to the table the aroma was a little fishy so I asked for some lemon.  It took awhile to get the lemon so I started eating. I liked the way it was cooked but it was a terribly small portion.  I suggest if you go to have the tasting menu.)         for dessert I got the passion fruit dessert. I love passion fruit so when I saw this on the menu online I wanted to come and try it.  The (ganache?) part was good .  I didn't like the other part.         Other things-after eating here my husband got sick.  He had the tofu. I tried it but I didn't get sick so I'm not sure what was up with that . Also I found the chairs to be pretty uncomfortable and my back was hurting by the end. Also disappointed that we didn't get to try the bacon bread everyone is talking about.        There are other great restaurants with great cooking and similar prices but the portion are a bit bigger ( usually I don't complain about portions but this was pretty tiny, so overall I don't think I would come back .",1,0,0,E R.,"Manhattan, NY",41,137,32

We split the scallops and quail to start. Both very different but excellent. The smoky sensation of the scallops is truly remarkable and something I have never experienced. We also split the lamb as an entree. The mix of flavors between the creamy artichoke, mint gel, and tender lamb was sensational.

5.0,4/3/2015,"My friend and I had a superlative dining experience at The Musket Room last night.  The intimate space is warm and rustic.  It has sort of a chic farmhouse feel, but with modern flourishes and a breeziness that make it cool without feeling forced.  Very tasteful and comfortable.  The service was top notch; always attentive, knowledgeable and helpful, with a good sense of humor.  They also seemed perfectly content to keep feeding us those incredibly addictive and delicious, warm cheddar brioche rolls throughout the meal, so that was another plus.  Now to the highlight reel:- Great beverage program.  Excellent wine list, paying deep homage to New Zealand.  Some signature cocktails and craft beers, as well.- Presentation like I have not seen in a very long time.  We're talking laser-like accuracy and extreme attention to detail.  Just stunning.  Reminded me of Daniel.- For starters, we shared the Cold Smoked Scallops and the Foie Gras.  Both of those were epic.  The scallops were brought out obscured by a smoke-filled bell jar and revealed at the table.  It felt like a magic trick.  The dish was as beautiful as it was delicious.  The foie gras was substantial and as smooth as a baby's butt.  Served with two pieces of toast and three different accompaniments, it was heavenly.- For mains, we shared the Beef and the Lamb.  Both were ridiculously tender and cooked to perfection.  The beef was served as two small filets with salsify (a root vegetable), roasted eggplant mousse (for lack of a better description) and lobster cream.  The lamb was served in several long, thin slices along with savory farro in gastrique, Jerusalem artichoke crisps with creamy mousse inside, and beautiful droplets of gelée topped with small mint leaves.  Again, both were visually stunning and creative, and the flavors and execution were just flawless.- For dessert, we shared the chocolate ""log"" with salted caramel and mandarin orange.  This was probably more wonderful to look at than it was to eat, though we had no issue choking it down!  Compared to everything that came before it, it just fell a little flat on the wow spectrum, but that's not to say it wasn't fantastic, because it was.Overall, this place really has their act together.  No detail was left unattended and everything was done exquisitely.  This is fine dining in a hip and relaxed downtown setting.  Don't be fooled by the casual vibe, this is serious food that commands your attention and contemplation.  It is not cheap, but I think it's good value given the extremely high level of quality and caliber of service.  All of the above plus two glasses of wine each and coffee cost us $200 before tip.  I've paid way more for much less!  Whether you come here for a special occasion or not, I think you'll find I'm not exaggerating when I say this was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time.  Highly recommended.",3,1,2,Joe L.,"South Orange, NJ",317,398,322

5.0,3/31/2015,"The Manhattan restaurant scene is a fickle and ephemeral thing. You can easily get caught up in trying all the hot new things, or settle into a rotation of favorite places. After awhile you begin to be able to discern which places have staying power, and which ones will eventually go out of style and shutter, their all-star staff moving on to a newer, cooler concept. I have even begun to notice how the Hot New Things and the Favorites seem to diverge on a few key qualities. So where would I categorize Musket Room?Well, ideally, a place with staying power--but not the kind that earns it an accolade via TV or film appearance, which would ruin it forever. A well-kept secret that is kept alive by its evidently affluent clientele and its incredible food. This could be a pipe dream, but I'll dream it anyway.I first requested to try out Musket Room for my birthday last year, after seeing a gorgeous photo essay of its interiors in a local magazine. I figured it might be a lark to go to one of those Fancy Places where all the food is teeny tiny and everyone takes it all super seriously and no one mentions how little the portions are. Plus, as everyone in the lead-up asked me, what the hell is New Zealand cuisine? It was all a delightful mystery.After having been to Musket Room for two of my birthdays, my boyfriend's birthday, and our eighteen month anniversary, I can safely say that it's probably one of the loveliest meals I've had in a very long time, and I look forward to every visit. As my terrible foreshadowing attests, this place is certainly Fancy, but the only time that's ever uncomfortable is when you're sitting next to some insufferable investment bankers (and you might do, sorry!). The staff are warm and friendly, and the only thing they really seem to take seriously is the quality of the food, all of which is wonderful. While offering some seasonal variations, Musket Room almost always has an affordable and very well-executed tasting menu, featuring, at some point, cold diver scallops, quail legs, and New Zealand red deer. These signature dishes are also available a la carte, and well worth the price if you'd like slightly larger portions. Their wine list is also quite extensive and well-populated with biodynamic and ecologically friendly wines, a lovely touch for a restaurant that grows several of its herbs and vegetables right in the backyard. The last time we went, they even packed a pair of boxes with macarons, jellies, and small candies for us to take home with us. It was a sweet touch, and one that speaks well to the care and thoughtfulness of the proprietors and head chefs. It's a great place for a low-key night out, an indulgent date night, meeting the parents, or even a small rehearsal dinner. I definitely plan to be back for more birthdays.",2,0,2,Melissa S.,"New York, NY",95,40,0

5.0,3/8/2015,"We dined here for nearly two hours celebrating the completion of my latest book and I'm absolutely thrilled we picked this place to do so - it is a winner! Our reservation was for 7:15pm. We got there 5 minutes early and was seated right away. The ambiance/decor of the restaurant is really lovely and high end without feeling stuffy.Our first taste of the musket room was the bread. Now, I don't normally eat bread but they offer warm bacon, cheddar, and some other types of bread along with beer butter? so I decided to have a small bite of both the bacon and cheddar bread. It was like a croissant and I didn't really taste any of the bacon or cheddar flavors, but it wasn't bad - just not worth the calories for me, so I unloaded mine of my boyfriend who thoroughly enjoyed them.After the bread, about 5-10 minutes later, our appetizers were brought out. I had the quail, with blackberries, bread sauce and roasted onions while my bf had the foie gras with granny smith apples and apricot, and we split the mushroom custard with raw mushroom, truffle and herbs. The quail and the sauce it was served in was delicious but pretty small - like two pieces of leg, or maybe a leg and wing? It is a starter though, so what can you expect? The mushroom custard was tasty, but I had a bite of my bf's foie gras and that was a show stopper!Next, our entrees were brought out - I had the pollock, which was lightly fried and came with a tasty mayo based sauce, parsnip, artichoke and 2 pieces of shrimp. Scrumptious! My bf got the red deer, which I sampled - it came with little dots of marshmallowy tasting meringue and green pea sauce. It was just ok for me but my bf seemed to like it.Last, but not least were our desserts. I had the banana foster while my boyfriend tried the hazelnut sweet potato log? His was pretty tasty but mine was delicious. It came with a lemon sorbet, hot caramel, and granitas. The bananas were cooked in a sauce and came in a white chocolate shell. It was heavenly!Yes, everything was pretty calorific (it was my first meal for the day) but it was well worth it! The cherry on top were two mini macarons served with the check, which came out to about the cost of two six course tasting menus. I think our meal was better than the 6 course tasting menu though because we were able to get more of the things we wanted and many of the items on the regular menu is on the tasting menu.Great service, atmosphere, food, attention to detail (our water glasses were always filled) and background music (which was at the perfect level - not too loud so that we couldn't hear each other).

Unfortunately, i dont eat red meat so my man got to eat two courses of the deer, but i was still full and satisfied at the end of the meal (and it was my own fault for not disclosing with the waitress ahead of time). We like to eat at nice restaurants more for the overall experience and not so much the actual food, and we both felt that this restaurant was amazing because it was unique and not at all pretentious.

The food is extraordinary and the service is fantastic.  We dine out a lot and it's rare we having a meal that justifies these pomp and prices.  Boy, did the Musket Room do just that. My boyfriend and I celebrated our anniversary at The Musket Room last night and were not just impressed but bowled over. We did the 6 course tasting menu which was  mind blowing on our taste buds and easy on the other senses. The staff was attentive and professional, our waitress incredibly charming. The kicker though, was when they found out it was our anniversary. Not only did they bring us a special dessert, but they brought us parting gifts of chocolates (5 each) in cute little boxes and a copy of the tasting menu with a wax seal! The attention to detail made a special night truly unforgettable.  Above and beyond.While the ambiance isn't necessarily unique it was tastefully decorated, we could hear each other very well, and it suited the evening.

5.0,2/17/2015,"My experience at The Musket Room was without a shred of doubt spectacular.  We had done the tasting menu and every dish was powered with flavor.  I would equate it to a sports car without a muffler.  Each bite had a specific node it was accentuating, and none of them were muted.Meal highlights I'd like to emphasize because after 5 months since my meal, they still stick in my mind:1) The caviar - yeah I know it's cliche, but it was darn good.  Usually places skimp, but I was impressed at how much they offered us.  A light flavoring of fish with a smooth finish.2) Heirloom tomato Gazpacho - Not a huge fan of over use of tomato, but the fact that I loved this soup speaks volumes.  Creamy finish with strong tomato flavor no over done.3) Quail - Really, the shining star of the night for everyone at our table.  Savory and refined.4) Red Deer - Didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised.  Coupled with fresh herbs, a very good dish, but it was no Quail.At the end of the day, service was on point like Baryshnikov, the meal struck every chord like the London Symphony Orchetra, and together we were applauding for an encore.The Musket Room operates at a complex level of quality and I'm happy to have experienced it.",1,0,2,Chester N.,"Astoria, NY",121,174,1

4.0,2/12/2015,"4.5 stars really, but only because I think it's appropriate to give 5 stars when you think there's literally nothing to improve upon. There were only two points that I wish the restaurant had done better.The Musket Room features New Zealand fare, and by that I'm thinking gamey birds and more 'unconventional' meats like lamb and venison, with some berries and twigs sprinkled on there. My one gripe about cuisine descriptions (and this is totally not on MR) is when they describe their food as 'fresh' and 'locally sourced.' Whenever I hear this I always ask myself: are there really cuisines out there that like old, moldy food that's traveled hundreds of miles? A hole-in-the-wall amateur chef in Suzhou, China no doubt loves to cook with local, fresh ingredients. As do chefs half a world away in Bogota, Colombia. Hearing famous chefs touting that their specific cuisine as especially 'fresh' and 'locally sourced,' always makes me roll my eyes, because it speaks to their reliance on buzzwords in foodie and popular culture and their unintentional implication that somewhere, somehow, some chef is sitting around picking and prodding at his fermented and rotting vegetables, ready to serve it to his diners. Just say NZ fare has wild meats and relies on x, y, and z cooking techniques. That would tell me much more about what NZ food really is. Anyway, that rant aside, this restaurant is a delight. The space itself is cleanly designed with bright walls and relaxed spacing. Furniture is expertly arranged to make the dining area larger than it is. Don't even get me started on the silverware. I've been to maybe 3-4 restaurants that have the fancy curved knives and I LOVE it. It's so small and subtle, yet it speaks volumes about the manager/owner. It fits the grip much more naturally and adds depth to the presentation. I know my three sentence laudation of the silverware is a bit excessive but it's really shocking how few restaurants care about the eating and drinking utensils of their patrons. Oh and the glasses? Love it even more. It's a heavy bottom that expands as you move further down to the table. Awful for alcohol as it cuts off air circulation but great for your hands bc it's ALSO a much better and more comfortable grip for your hands. It's just the details man. Anyway, two thoughts on the food: one is that portion size is small. It's not depressingly small but it's borderline. We opted for the 6-course tasting menu:1. Broccoli soup with beef cheek and parsley oil- Pleasantly rich soup with a super tender piece of cheek plopped in the middle. And despite how heavy it may seem, it actually feels more like a refreshing appetizer. 2. Mushroom custard with truffles, foie gras, and assorted herbs. This was my favorite dish I think. The custard definitely tastes like foie gras, even if it might not be. The truffles are expectedly decadent, with the herbs lifting the dish and the flavor at the very end of the bite. 3. Quail with blackberries, bread sauce and roasted onions. This one was good but it didn't have as much gamey-ness as I expected, which in my view is a minus because what's the point of eating quail if it just tastes like mini-chicken? It was tender though, and crispy on the outside. The chef definitely knows how to quarter and break down the bird, which is nice. 4. Lamb with heirloom grains, sunchoke and mint. Could've been better. The lamb came room-temperature and was absolutely tiny. About the size of a fudge pop as it was just a barely inch-thick sliver of meat. The heirloom grains were chewy and imparted little flavor to complement the meat. Can't say this was one of my favs. 5. Cranberry lime sorbet of sorts with an 'egg shell' pairing that melts like ice cream. This was a delight and very refreshing.6. Carrot cake. There's a fancy sugar transparent sugar brittle on top. Nothing too fancy but a solid finishing course. We also had the Chenin Blanc and Riesling throughout the meal.My one gripe (aside from the portion sizes, which were expected going in) is that I wish the food relied on more flavors and sauces. The ONLY flavor I can remember is foie gras. I don't even think it was mentioned by name on the menu, but from dish 2 to dish 4, as in mushroom custard, quail, and lamb, I tasted nothing but creamy liver. I have no problem with eating foie gras normally as it's the bomb but you can't do stuff like this on a tasting menu. Even if these three dishes are all supposed to contain the noted ingredients, at least remove 2 of them so diners selecting the tasting menu don't have a constant taste of savory liver in their mouths. I thought this was super weird and it was definitely one of the first things I remember coming out of the restaurant. That said, The Musket Room is a wonderful restaurant that I would highly recommend to my friends and given that the food and service are so great, I will definitely be coming back to try the other offerings.",3,0,1,Henry Y.,"New York, NY",376,801,1
5.0,2/9/2015,"The family and I just had an absolutely delicious meal at the Musket room. After dinner, I could have seriously started a slow clap for the chef.After walking in, I really loved the vibe and space. It felt upscale, a perfect blend of modern/rustic without a hint of stuffiness. Great start. I also was really happy with the wine and cocktail list. As a New Zealand inspired restaurant, there were plenty of NZ wines on the list which I'm always a fan of. I also really enjoyed the cocktail list. I started with the Elisabeth Street Mara and loved how refreshing it was! On to the food...Let me start by saying, bone marrow butter. Yep, they served bone marrow butter with our deliciousl little rolls. My mouth is watering just thinking about this butter! It was great. My husband and I agreed to share everything so we decided on two appetizers and 2 entrees and felt that it was the right amount of food. The plates are not huge so keep that in mind. We started off with the quail and foie gras torchon and we thrilled. The quail was served with a blackberry sauce and was absolutely delicious. I find quail tough to eat often as it's so tiny but this was cooked so well that it fell off the bone so easily. The torchon was also fantastic. They gave us a huge piece of foie that was perfectly paired with apple, prune and a toasted brioche.For our main dishes, my husband and I split the lamb with grains, sunflowers and mint and the cod with artichokes, mussels, parsnip puree in a Parmesan broth. But dishes were excellent. I'm generally not a huge lover of mint with my lamb but the fresh mint was just lovely. It brightened up the dish so nicely. The cod was heaven. Perfectly cooked and everything just came together so nicely. The flavors were bold but the dish managed to stay nice and light. I highly recommend both dishes. After all of that food, we naturally had no room for dessert but it all sounded wonderful AND based on our meal, I'm sure it was. Do yourself a favor and get to the Musket Room before the word gets out too much and you can't get in!",0,0,0,Lindsay H.,"Philadelphia, PA",125,220,10

5.0,1/16/2015,"Probably the best dining experience that I have ever had. (it was my first Michelin Star experience)I started the night off by ordering a couple drinks at the bar, which were the best I've ever had ($15), old fashioned bourbon, and sezerac. I've never had sezerac before, but the aroma was exceptional.A bit after my party arrived, we were escorted to our table, and because we had to wait 10 minutes at the bar, the host put a round of drinks that we had at the bar on the house as a sign of appreciation, which took off $60 off of our bill already.We had two appetizers, 4 mains and 2 desserts among 4 people, and although the portions weren't too filling, every bite was so good and interesting that we thoroughly enjoyed every morsel.They have a Master Sommelier in New Zealand that source the wine selection for them, and the in-house expert was very knowledgeable and recommended a very nice wine for us. Other waiting staffs were all so courteous and knowledgeable about everything that they were serving.

5.0,1/16/2015,"This has to be one of the best tasting menus in NYC. It was my boyfriend's birthday so we decided to go all out with the 10 course tasting menu. We loved every. Single. Plate. I find when you go to really nice restaurants with tasting menus, a lot of the chefs go crazy with their molecular gastronomy - you get something that looks amazing and nothing like the ingredients they have claimed to use, but actually tastes awful. Not being the most sophisticated eater, I just assumed the chef knew what they were doing, and my tastebuds were too ""common"" to understand the flavors. This experience certainly gave me faith that you can go to a michelin starred restaurant, recognize everything on your plate and love 10/10 dishes.Though the food stood out on its own, I could not believe the effort they made to make the night extra special. I had let the restaurant know it was a birthday dinner beforehand, so on one of the dessert plates they spelled out Happy Birthday in chocolate - pretty standard, but still nice. Then our petit fours were served with the night's menu folded and sealed with a wax stamp. After paying, we were offered a tour of their herb garden with the chef's wife (and the manager), Barbara, who is very sweet and down to earth. We chatted for a while and got to hear about their back story and vision for the restaurant. I am sure this treatment came from the combination of doing the tasting menu and the birthday, but we both left unable to think of a better dining experience.",0,0,0,India W.,"Manhattan, NY",4,18,0

5.0,12/16/2014,"Words can't even begin to explain how much I loved my dining experience at The Musket Room. I heard from a friend that they had an amazing 6-course tasting menu for an affordable price ($75) and they were able to snag a Michelin Star within the first year of opening.  All these accolades are EXACTLY on point!To start, the service here is impeccable! When we arrived at our reservation, our hostess was very apologetic about making us wait and she offered to buy us drinks.  We opted for the Smoky Kiss and The Queen's Punch.  Among the two, the Queen's Punch was the better drink, with a little less of an alcoholic aftertaste.When we were finally seated, we chose the 6-course tasting menu.  While we were waiting, our server gave us a choice of a couple different breads: sourdough, bacon and cheddar brioche, and rye.  Like any starving individual, I stopped listening when our server said bacon and ordered the brioche immediately.  AMAZINGGGGG.  We asked for seconds and thirds throughout the night and our server happily obliged.  The sourdough was pretty good as well, but no contest for the brioche.Our dishes were paced perfectly and in this order:- Broccoli soup | oxtail | parsley: The oxtail croquette was SO DELICIOUS.  Be sure to savor this one!  The broccoli soup was a great appetizer for a cold night.  It was thick and had great texture without being too heavy.- Cold smoked scallops | cucumbers | black garlic | pears | sea beans:  This dish had the best presentation.  It was served with smoke bubbling underneath a glass cover and when the server lifted the glass, the smoke dissipated into the air, drawing the attention of other patrons sitting near us. The rolls of pickled cucumber here were my favorite.  Everything on this dish complemented each other perfectly. - Quail | blackberries | bread sauce | roasted onions: I haven't had quail too many times before this, but I really enjoyed this one.  The bread sauce was very unique and tasted great with the tender quail, which fell right off the bone.  I only wish there was more meat!- New Zealand red deer | flavors of gin:  This was my favorite dish of the night.  The red deer was cooked perfectly and did not have a gamey taste to it at all. The portions looked small at first, but as I was eating this one, it didn't feel that way at all.  I think it was just the right portion to satiate an appetite without being overwhelming.- Grape | ginger: This was a really interesting palate cleanser. I liked how at certain parts it tasted somewhat like a peanut butter jelly sandwich.  It was bright and sweet without being too overly saccharine.- Chocolate mousse cake | pear | almond: I wasn't a huge fan of this dessert, but it was still pretty good.  I'm big on textures so I really appreciated the medley of flavors and combination of textures on this plate.This is probably one of my best dining experiences in NYC and I will definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone!

It is nestled away in a cozy little block of NOHO , so since we were early for our reservation we walked around to a few shops until it was time. When we walked in we were hit with a feeling of warmth and comfort do to the small bar , little tables and brick inside. Our server was very nice and was happy to answer any of our questions. I have a lot of food allergies so needless to say the chef was not willing to accommodate which sucked but funny enough I was really enjoying the black salt margarita that I really didn't mind. I ended up ordering the gazpacho because that was the only the waiter said I could eat . Meanwhile on the other side of the table my boy friend was having a field day...he ordered an old fashioned which he said was superb and started his meal off with the  Cold smoked scallops, cucumbers, black garlic, pears and sea beans. He said the app was divine...I could see for myself they were fresh scallops and they prepared them so nicely I was almost tempted to try one myself. My Heirloom tomato gazpacho, olive oil and garden herbs, was alright ...to be honest I have never had gazpacho before so i was not so keen on the whole cold soup thing...ah well another margarita for me it was ! they were addicting ! Now onto my boy friends main he ordered the Steak and cheese pie which was a great decision because boy was that steak prepared beautifully . It was a filet cooked to perfection and paired with a cracker and cheese on the side....seriously its a better deal than any steak house around !  For 32 dollars he had a  filet minion in a Michelin star restaurant ...who can beat those prices !! You go to Wolfgangs or any where else that same piece of meat would be 60 bucks!

4.0,10/5/2014,"So. The musket room is one of those michelin's where you can get consistently good food and a friendly service.The menu is characteristic to be described most accurately. There are not many options. Only a few mains and appetizers and delicious desserts. There is the tasting menu option, obviously, but if you want to savor one recipe to the utmost degree that might not be your first choice.As appetizers i would recommend the foie gras which is very appetizing and the portion is generous. Entrees on the other hand are more of a challenge. The chicken is delicious and big. The deer is probably the most interesting dish on the menu and a new zealand specialty. Another thing you might go for is the pie. Steak and cheese in a pie is interesting. For desserts the most popular one might be the chocolate cake with the mint ice cream but i would recommend the pavlova. It is the specialty.Wine list is inadequate. Though the cocktails do make up for that deficiency. Interior decoration is also very minimal and comfy. The atmosphere is intimate and quiet so is excellent for a private gathering or a date.

Fast forward to the end of the meal, there was no room left for dessert. The purees with the duck were absolutely delicious, but did not overpower the duck itself. The fried herbs added a nice touch of texture. Paired with a bottle of syrah, this meal was worth every penny. The staff just made the night even better.

3.0,9/20/2014,"I really wish I could give a higher rating to this restaurant, but the overall experience only rates 3 stars at most. We dined here on a Saturday evening. We arrived at our reservation time and were seated promptly in the front of the restaurant opposite the bar. . We were offered water, given menus, and then there was a long period of time before anyone returned to the table to ask if we wanted something from the bar. We ordered from the Ala Carte menu while the adjoining table ordered from the tasting menu. Surprisingly, the portions that the adjacent table received on the tasting menu were IDENTICAL to the portions that we received when we ordered from the ala carte menu. The result is that ordering 3 courses ala carte is not enough but ordering the tasting menu results in an excessive amount of food. Those did NOT appear to be tasting portions. On to the food. The gazpacho was admittedly excellent. Not overwhelming, but excellent. The smoked scallops, a signature dish, proved disappointing. The problem was that the scallops were chopped up so small that the dish, despite having been smoked, had surprisingly little taste. The entrees... Codfish was fine. The Red Deer was amazing.  It had a combination of flavors that worked perfectly together and was unlike any dish I have ever had anywhere. This dish alone proved that the chef was ingenious. We ordered one desert the plum tart but because of miscommunication (a common problem here) we got two but the waitress graciously removed the charge for one . I'm not big on desserts, which is why I never order them, but I have to admit I loved this dessert. The Musket Room doesn't have ""regular coffee"". They only have espresso and serve a double espresso as ""Americano"".  At $4.00 it's a fair charge, but why don't they serve regular coffee? Another problem I had with this restaurant was the ""Vibe"". Some restaurants are ""relaxing"" and some have ""electricity"". The Musket Room just felt ""depressed"" for some reason. There was no energy, and there was no relaxation. On a positive note, the wines, even by the glass, were exceptonal and the wine steward who attended to the next table was extremely knowledgable and cordial. But.. the whole just doesn't add up to the sum of the parts here. The kitchen clearly is excellent, but the bumbling service and depressed setting detract from the experience. The tasting menu here is $75.00 and considering that 3 courses come to $65.00 and really another course should be added to have a satisfying meal, I'd suggest going with the tasting menu if you come here, unless you are like me and routinely don't order dessert.

5.0,9/19/2014,"A few friends of mine visited The Musket Room when the restaurant first opened in late summer of 2013. The feedback on the food was all positive, but when I heard stories of the drawn out waits between courses, it was enough to deter me from making my own visit. Fast forward to over a year later: with a Michelin star under its belt and with (what I hoped was) sufficient time to work out the kinks in timing and service, I was lucky enough to make a trip here for dinner. The chef at Musket Room, Matt Lambert, hails from New Zealand, and spent some time in the kitchens of Saxon + Parole as well as PUBLIC. The menu reflects his unique and slightly eccentric style, presented in a three, six, or ten-course tasting menu. We opted to go with the six course, and after starting with housemade bread and butter, our dinner began.First up was the Heirloom Tomato Gazpacho. We were first presented with a bowl with only the olive oil and garden herbs, before the gazpacho was poured tableside. The gazpacho is emulsified, so it maintains a creamy texture while being still very light, and each spoonful had an unique edge with the presence of olive oil.Our second course was the Cold Smoked Scallops, which was brought out in a silver dome; upon opening, we were barely able to catch sight of the wisps of smoke. It's a surprisingly complex dish, comprised of Maine Diver Scallops that are lightly seared before being smoked in manuka chips (bark from a tree found only in New Zealand), cucumbers marinated in chardonnay vinegar before being formed into twirls, compressed pears, blanched sea beans, and black garlic puree. All the elements combine to form a startlingly successful dish. The scallops taste as though they've been fully cooked, even though their texture suggests otherwise. A touch of acidity from the cucumbers, sweetness from the pears, and a final punch of umami from the black garlic make for a intricate forkful.And then, then a dish featuring Quail legs cooked with roasted onions and braised cherries; again, another balanced dish featuring savory flavors with sweet undertones. The fourth course is also another signature dish at The Musket Room. On the menu, it's listed as ""New Zealand Red Deer with Flavors of Gin"". Dig a little deeper, though, and the staff will reveal that Chef Lambert gets the venison from a farm in New Zealand owned by friends of his family. The leg filet is paired with gin botanicals, a variety of herbs and flavors that accompany the dish in the form of a celery root puree, roasted fennel, juniper meringue, and finished with a final pour of jus from the pan. It's another perfectly harmonized dish, with flavors that blend in seamlessly with the venison.There was a small palate cleanser of watermelon, sorbet, and a jalapeno-spiced sauce... And we ended the evening with dessert, which was a chocolate torte with a side of mint ice cream. Not too sweet, and a light end to a delicious meal.The manager was kind enough to stop by our table at the end of the meal, and when we inquired about the area we saw outside of the window in the back, took us through their herb garden, pointing out their microgreens and where some of the herbs and vegetables we'd had earlier in the evening came from. If you do come by The Musket Room, make sure you ask for a quick tour!In hindsight, it would be erroneous of me to say that our meal here was anything short of flawless. At first glance, a lot of the items may appear gimmicky or only for show, but many of the techniques and ingredients have been carefully thought through. It's wonderful to see how Chef Lambert is able to take ingredients and elements from his home and craft them into a modern, elegant cuisine. Thankfully, I'm not the only one who thinks so.",13,5,9,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827
5.0,9/16/2014,"I've been a Yelp user for so many years and its truly never led me astray  So when my girlfriend asked me to pick a restaurant for a last minute Monday night celebratory dinner, I found the Musket Room and was easily convinced.  And the experience was so well received by my girlfriend and I that I felt the need to write my first review.The ambiance and decor was terrific -- a very cool vibe.  We were excited to see that while there weren't a ton of tables, the restaurant was setup so that diners were not sitting on top of each other.  The bar was very cool and the selection and service was perfect for two celebratory glasses of champagne.  We were seated slightly after our reservation time.We debated back and forth for a bit on whether to get the six course tasting menu -- I am so glad that we did!  Having never been to New Zealand, every option on the menu was intriguing for us.  In the end, the six course tasting menu gave us a great sample of so many flavors and ingredients.  The smoked scallops and the red deer were amazing.  The deserts were incredibly tasty and left us perfectly satisfied.  We picked a nice glass of red and a nice glass of white, both from New Zealand, that were excellent with our food.The service was also fantastic.  The servers were very attentive and answered all of our questions.  Absolutely perfect.  My only issue was that the dinner did take a fair amount of time.  And while we were not in a rush at all, it did seem like there was a little bit too much time in between courses.  Many tables were sitting around enjoying some wine or coffee, so I think the vibe was supposed to be relaxed.  Still, no real problem at all.I would highly recommend taking a trip down to the Musket Room, it really was a perfect dining experience.",0,0,0,Michael G.,"Flatiron, Manhattan, NY",3,1,0

5.0,8/4/2014,"I truly enjoyed this one Michelin starred place, every dish that we ordered was to my liking and cocktails were extremely tasty.I had a 7 PM reservation here on a Sunday and walked in to see a really sleek yet natural looking space. Very cool and comfortable. The hostesses are very friendly as they direct you to your table where you are greeted by your waiter who gives you your cocktail menu. I ordered the Mana Tea cocktail which had some tea and bourbon whiskey - very refreshing. I then ordered their Sandy drink which also had bourbon whiskey with a bunch of bitters, somehow tasted very sweet and was almost addicting. I ordered two more! Don't know how this drink is meant for two people.As far as the menu goes, it can be a bit intimidating at first. It is meant to be New Zealand cuisine which is big on their more gamey type foods so you'll have your deer and your quail be the most marquee items on their menu. But everything was prepared very beautifully in both look and taste. Here is what we ordered:1) Corn custard - if I could give this 100 stars I would. This was an incredible taste, almost tasted like a dorito if you ate the whole thing haha.2) Foie gras - I didn't eat this but my friend did and said it was one of her favorites that she's tried.3) Smoked scallops - This was nicely mixed with floral elements and herbs. Light and refreshing4) Steak and cheese pie - An interesting plate that I found to be a great mix (when mixing the steak and dried cheese together)5) NZ Red Deer with gin - Beautifully presented with a great taste. Does not have even a hit of gaminess to it.6) Plum tart with plum ice cream - DELICIOUS (if you like plums :))I highly recommend this place as an experience. Great location too.

I ordered the red deer and my friend ordered the duck breast, both of which were fantastic. To start we ordered the foie gras (not as good as the rest of the food) and scallops (spectacular). Look at the website--the scallop looked just as beautiful and perfect as the one on the front page! We ordered a not-too-expensive New Zealand pinot which paired very well with both entrees.

5.0,7/24/2014,"My friend and I had a truly wonderful meal at this New Zealand restaurant. I had been interested in eating there after reading and hearing good things - and because after a trip to NZ 2 years ago, I search the city constantly for NZ-inspired food. (So far the downtown bar in the seaport and the restaurant in Park Slope were my other options.)The fact that they offered 2 tasting menus was quite unique (both a 6 course and a 10 course) and very reasonably priced (6 course $75/10 course $125). Though my friend and I decided to make our own version of a tasting menu, it was nice to see their options. We started with shigoku oysters topped with cava foam and ginger jelly. I love shigokus on their own - but with these toppings they were equally tasty and interesting without being overwhelmed. (My one issue for the entire meal - which was scrumptious - was that my friend had some of her oysters improperly shucked. A few were still stuck to their foot and she had to try to pry them off - leaving behind some of the meat. Though they were clean and not gritty, I have to think that at a 1 Michelin star restaurant that shouldn't happen.) Next we shared the cold smoked scallops with cucumbers, black garlic, pears and sea beans. The presentation makes you fall in love when they lift the silver dome off the dish and the wonderful smokiness wafts out. The chilled nature makes the scallop even more refreshing (we were dining on a hot sticky night). We also shared the quail with cherries, bread sauce and roasted onions. My only complaint with the quail was that we wish there was more meat on these birds! Flavorful, wonderfully combined ingredients - just the right amount of sweet and sour and the onion...well I could go on and on. For entrees we shared the tofu gnocchi with tomato dashi, oyster mushrooms and Asian greens. The greens were a bit tough to get through (large and leafy made for a bit more work than we were expecting) but the flavor was pleasant. I have never seen tofu gnocchi on a menu and was pleasantly surprised with the flavor which paired wonderfully with the tomato dashi (I could have slurped that all night). But, the star of the meal, in my opinion, was the New Zealand red deer ""with flavors of gin"". It was ridiculous. It was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and amazingly flavorful and tender. I am not sure of what it was served with, but one of the sauces almost had the texture of a semi-melted marshmallow. With the meal we had an Ostler reisling and with dessert we shared the Cloudy Bay late harvest reisling (don't miss this wine!! I love Cloudy Bay wines...). The servers were attentive without rushing (we were there for over 2.5 hours) and helpful when we had questions. The sommalier/gm invited us out to see the ""chef's garden"" at the end of our meal and gave us a bit of a tour through it discussing the plan to try to get tables outside (or one large table) in the future if the ordinance will allow it. The team at the Musket Room seems genuinely interested in trying to take NZ fare to a higher level while using inspiration from the homeland. The price point is very accessible (appetizers range from $13-19 and entrees from $26-33) and I am glad that they showcase the wonderful wines from their home country. I hope in the future they can get some green lip mussels on their menu! Fingers crossed.",0,0,0,Lindsey S.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,158,592
4.0,7/8/2014,Overall I enjoyed my experiance at The Musket Room. Great interior and interesting menu. I went in the spring and found the food very rich and full of saturated flavors.

I enjoyed many things but would reccomend the cold smoked scalops and the mushroom custard.

We also got the foie gras which was fantastic and came with tiny pieces of toast in a rack (too cute).For me, the apps outshone the entrees.

5.0,3/26/2014,"Went here last Saturday and had the 10 course tasting menu with matched wines.  All of the food was incredible - delicious, wonderfully presented and inventive.  The cooking is on par with the best restaurants in town, though the dishes are more creative than in most of the established Michelin places.  I could write at length about all of the dishes but I'll just mention that the Red Deer with flavours of gin wasn't on the tasting menu, but was something that we really wanted having perused the menu on-line beforehand.  So we asked them to add it in as an extra course.  They did. It was amazing.  For me where the Musket room surpasses other fine dining restaurants in the city is in the service and atmosphere.  Don't get me wrong the service at Daniel and Le Bernardin etc is obviously faultless, and I do enjoy such places, but what you're getting at the Musket Room is something completely different.  Rather than being stuffy/clinical it is just incredibly relaxed and friendly whilst still maintaining the quality.  It is personal rather than impersonal.The sommelier was really attentive and gave us great explanations of the wine (but not in an 'I'm reciting this faultlessly from memory from my wine bible, and telling you everything which is text book correct about this wine' way but more in a 'I have tasted this wine and this is what I personally think about it' kind of a way which is far more interesting for me). The pairings were excellent and I must say that I also appreciated the fact that she came round and topped up our glasses on courses where some of us were getting through the glass quite quickly (and the initial servings were generous) - that is not something I've seen elsewhere.  When we were having our final course she mentioned a great dessert wine that they'd got in recently and then gave us all a taste in addition to the pairing that we had for the course.  Little touches like that go a long way for me.Barbara, the front of house and co-owner greeted us when we came in and then stopped to chat from time to time as we had our meal.  She was so friendly and relaxed.  To contrast this place with normal Michelin places again I'd say this: when she asked if you were enjoying your course it wasn't a platitude, she cared whether you were enjoying it or not and was interested in your answer. When she found out that our two guests were from Hawkes Bay in New Zealand she disappeared and came back to show us a wine map of the region that they'd just had framed.  Later in the meal her husband, who is the chef, popped out to say hello too and was also really lovely.So to conclude my essay, it was really amazing to eat at a place which got the right balance between fine dining (and the food was wonderful) and a relaxing atmosphere.  We all really enjoyed speaking to the owners and it was so clear that  they were very proud of their restaurant and it was personally important to them that we had a good time, which we did.  Lastly I'll just say that I was so impressed that this is the first review that I've bothered to write after four years of living in New York.",1,0,0,Rohan W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0

I'm a vegetarian, so there aren't too many options for me, but what I had was out of control good- mushroom custard & tofu gnocchi. Unf. My boyfriend had the steak & cheese pie, which he loved every second of, but said he felt mislead that it was so heavily deconstructed. He's kind of a self proclaimed meat pie connoisseur (to which he replies, ""I disagree; MANY people would call me a meat pie connoisseur""). I personally feel that the reputation of the musket room should have dictated that it WOULD be so deconstructed, but he disagrees. Saying that the hotly contested legitimacy of Musket Room's steak and cheese pie was the only complaint our party had that evening should show how lovely an experience we had.Then suddenly; dessert. We were sent a complimentary plate of the cherry/pistachio dessert, which was lovely (boyfriend's favorite, only because a he's deathly allergic to passion fruit- more pavlova for me), the fig & cheese plate, and the pavlova.

The wine selection is sublime, featuring some of the best of NZ, the Marlborough Sounds, and beyond. We decided not to partake in the tasting menu, selfishly, as the mains we really wanted were not on it, but we'll be back to experience the chef's best.  We had the Uni and Smoked Scallops, which were great, but our mains of Steak and Cheese Pie and Red Deer absolutely stole the show. Some of the tastiest dishes we've had in recent memory. My girlfriend was aghast that a Kiwi would be serving a Steak and Cheese Pie (standard drunk and fast food in NZ) as fine fare, but the deconstruction really proved her wrong.  For dessert the Pavlova was beautifully authentic, and the Kikorangi Blue cheese was heavenly (how do they import such amazing cheese across the Pacific Ocean)??? Service was absolutely excellent, offering tastes of wine and always attentive to our needs.I left wishing I had explored more of the menu and more of the incredible wine list.

The private dining room that hides behind a set of heavy red velour curtains.. What's behind there? Deliciousness of course. Any time I spot a prix fixe option my vote is ALWAYS ""Yes please."" Why? Because it's generally the chef saying ""Here are the most delicious things on the menu..and you should try small bites of every single one of them"" & who can say no to that?

Up next was the smoked scallop with pear and sea bean. This was interesting but not delicious. There was a definite unpleasant fishy taste that usually isn't present in smoked fish. A whole glass of water wouldn't wash it away. Won't order that again. Then the butternut custard with pumpkin seeds came. I could've ordered this twice over. Delicious!! For the main course we had the Duck and the Cod. Both were excellent. They were prepared perfectly and the portions were just right.For desert I ordered pumpkin pie, which was disappointing and not pie at all. It was rather a deconstructed pie... which means pumpkin puree and toasted marshmallow with pumpkin seeds and cranberries with salt. I wish someone had mentioned that when I ordered.All in all quite good.

I have been wanting to try this place since it opened and I happened to score a Saturday reservation for last night. We had a 9:15 but were ready to go at about 8:00. We walked in sheepishly hoping for a table and were shocked to see the place 1/2 empty. Everyone was so pleasant, 5 stars for that. They sat us at a cozy table by the door and when we said it was a bit cold they offered to turn up the heat..toasty table for 2 in about 5. The decor is tres cool, although I think the place to sit is definitely in the back room. Our waiter was fabulous and when I asked for the MS he said SHE will be with us shortly.  I'm on the sommelier track so I was aware that they had a MS in residence but he was a man...has he left? Don't know, either way the assistant Dane came over and made my evening. To start they offer you a choice of bread, bacon cheddar biscuits. Yes, please can I have another. The drinks were a bit fab themselves, I went with The finer things: cognac,amaretto, cardamom bitters sparkling wine and my man: some crazy warm cocktail. They both were phenomenal!!!! On to the food and wine. Since I'm studying for my Level 2 MS I chose 4 wines and let my date pick out of those. My job was to determine which bottle it was. I loved the fact that both Dane and his boss indulged me in this, I can't say enough about their participation and genuine interest in what we were doing. I ended up with Misha's vineyard"" the high note"" 2012 Pinot and all I can say is if you find this, buy it. 1. Quail, blackberries, bread sauce roasted onions: insanely good but we each had about 1/2 a bite.2. Cold scallops, cucumbers, black garlic, pear and sea beans - I would never have ordered this had I not trusted my fellow yelpers...y'all failed me...hated it!!! Way too smokey.3. New Zealand red deer with tastes of gin - y'all redeemed yourselves here. Unbelievable!!!4.

4.0,12/26/2013,"Sometimes, you just need a break from the rush of New York City. Instead of taking that weekend getaway to the Poconos or Jersey, consider taking a day trip (literally! prepare yourself for a long meal) to the Musket Room.Tucked along the quiet Elizabeth St, a far cry from the hustle and bustle of Houston St (now that's pronounced HOW-ston, tourists), the Musket Room brings about a sense of agrarian serenity with its white-washed walls, walnut timber bar, and bountiful greens in sight. We sadly did not get to see the backyard garden, but based off the interior, I'm sure it is breathtaking.The food was outstanding. We decided against the tasting menu (they have a 3-, 6-, or 9- course tasting menu that changes daily) and ordered the quail, scallops, tofu gnocchi, passion fruit pavlova, and pistachio custard. The heirloom tomato gazpacho amuse bouche was surprisingly one of our favorites. The freshness of the tomatoes grabs your attention immediately, then it spins you around with the saltiness of the fortified olive oil gelee. It was a touch spicy and just the most incredible interplay of salty and sweet flavors. The cold smoked scallops with cucumbers, black garlic, pears, and sea beans was also impressive. When your server lifts that silver, dome-shaped cover, a cloud of smoke dissipates into the air in front of you. (I wish I asked them how they got the smoke in there.) I was mildly disappointed that the scallops were only a little smokey (if only I could spoon the smoke into my mouth), but the dish was phenomenal nonetheless. In a meticulous ceviche-like dish, you have pieces of smoked scallops, a salty black garlic sauce, and pears soaked in white balsamic vinegar. The tofu gnocchi was lovely (didn't taste too healthy haha) with the sweetness of the tomato cutting through the dashi broth flavor and the gnocchi just melting into your mouth. The bacon cheddar biscuit, on the the other hand, was ALMOST as good as everyone says it is. The baker in me still found some room for improvement.Pastry Chef Rob Rohl certainly has a fondness for deconstructing his desserts. The pistachio custard with dehydrated cherries, nitrogen frozen mango, and caramel sounded wild on paper, but didn't come together as I imagined. The passion fruit pavlova with strawberries and cream was extremely light and airy, but there was no sweetness whatsoever. Perhaps if the meringue or cream gelato (?) was flavored or a sweeter fruit (than passion fruit) was used, this dessert could be more interesting.I didn't give Musket Room five stars for the following reasons:- Our three course meal was badly paced and spanned over FOUR hours. We spent a lot of time twiddling our thumbs while waiting for the next dish.- Service was spotty. No one was around to pour us water or hand us menus for at least ten minutes after we first sat down. Good thing we didn't walk out. Later, we got to talk with our server, and she was the sweetest girl ever.- Bread was rationed. I get so riled up when restaurants do this! You can't trust the diners to pace themselves so you give them one bread at a time, only upon request? Bah humbug!- Our drinks were poorly mixed. I forget what we ordered, but given their association with Saxon + Parole, I expected better. Extremely disappointed.- Lastly, exactly how much of the menu is New Zealand cuisine? Our server did explain the story behind the origin of the pavlova dessert (named after Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova visiting NZ), but it'd be nice for Matt Lambert to have confidence in his cuisine and share it with New Yorkers. I mean, when else will we be able to try New Zealand food?",9,4,6,Jess C.,"New York, NY",591,305,582
5.0,12/22/2013,"This was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. I stared with the squash custard, which was delicious. The people I was with got the foie gras and said it was the best they've ever had (I didn't try it because I am a pescetarian, I'll take their word for t). I usually find that at most restaurants, when the appetizers are so spectacular, the entree tends to be disappointing, but this was one of the only meals I've had in a while where the main course outshines the app. I had the cod with brown butter and parsnip puree and it was absolutely out of this world. I was deciding between that and the tofu gnocchi, and while I've heard good things about the gnocchi and would like to try it, I just can't imagine anything being better than the cod. The fish itself was excellent, but the brown butter and parsnip puree was absolutely outstanding. This was definitely one of the best entrees I've had all year. For desert, we split the pistachio custard with cherries and grape and the devil's food cake with olive caramel. They were both excellent, I couldn't really decide which one I liked better because every time I took a bite of the custard I thought ""this one is definitely better"" and then when I took a bite of the cake I thought ""no maybe this one's better"". All of the deserts on the menu looked great, usually it is easy for me to choose a desert because only one or two things appeal to me, but literally almost every desert on the menu looked good. The service was great,  very friendly and attentive. The small details from the beautiful, modern dishes and silverware to the steaming hot bread really added to the experience. I would definitely recommend coming here. I usually son't go to the same place twice, but I would come back here, my only problem would be deciding whether to reorder everything I got this time, or switching it up.

5.0,11/12/2013,"Simply said...AMAZING!!!!!!This was the best dining experience I've had in a very long time. The food is spectacular and the service outstanding. The Musket Room recently received a Micheline star after only four months of opening and it is very well deserved.A coworker and I ate here tonight after a very long day and it was a very much needed treat. We started with the cold smoked sea scallops and the Hamachi. The scallops arrived covered to capture the smoke and once presented and the cover removed you get a whiff of smoke that tantalizes the pallet and it doesn't disappoint! Most restaurants do captured smoke for the presentation with little regard to what it does to the flavors of the dish, not so with this appetizer. The subtle smoke enhances the sea scallops' sweetness and is the perfect backdrop to the saltiness of the sea beans and the fruitiness of the pears. The addition of the cucumbers balances the strong flavors of the smoke and sea beans. This app is a study of flavor balance that only a master can acheive! The Hamachi with apples and wasabi was just as amazing in it's subtle mix of flavors. The addition of the puffed rice kernels was the absolutely perfect textural counter balance to the Hamachi. For the main courses we had the New Zealand red deer and the duck, simply GENIUS!!!!! The venison was perfectly done with the jus and caramelized shallots was sublime! Paired with a kiwi cabernet franc it was the best venison dish I have EVER eaten. With that being said the duck with zuccini, huckleberry and jus eclipsed the venison! Perfectly medium rare and cut thick like a steak, hands down is the best main on the menu. STUNNING!!! Seriously, this is the BEST duck dish in the city!I am not a big sweet desert person, however, my coworker and I shared the sponge cake with lavender mouse  and raspberries and it lives up to the level of the savory dishes on the menu.

We opted for the ten course tasting menu which is surprisingly not too much food. The portions are perfect and like they should, start light and get progressively richer. I happened to mention a desire to avoid gluten and they seamlessly adapted the meal. Some of the courses were entirely different and maybe even better than the set menu! Of course we opted for the pairing. The only downside is, dare I say, it was a bit too much for my taste- about a 1-2 oz. pour with each course. Some of the bold choices that would make me come back- sashimi with dill, a port paired midway through (with questionable success but A for effort), and the main protein was venison and it worked!!Go before it becomes too cool for you.",1,1,1,Tara W.,"Ridgewood, NJ",488,585,132

3.0,10/1/2013,"KenScale: 7.5/10The Musket Room is a restaurant from chef Matt Lambert paying homage to his root in New Zealand, combined with some Asian influences. While I was in love with the decor of the beautiful dining room overlooking the garden outside, unfortunately that was the most memorable part of my dining experience. All the dishes that I had were not bad (and their display was very well thought out) but not particularly memorable either, especially given my anticipation not having known what New Zealand cuisine is like.I started the meal with heirloom gazpacho with garden herbs and olive oil and cold smoked scallops with cucumbers, black garlic, pears and sea beans. I liked the lightness of gazpacho, but scallops somehow tasted flat despite all the other ingredients combined. For the main dishes, I had steak and cheese pie and Chatham cod with brown butter, beans and barley miso. Steak was tender, but I didn't find anything special about the dish in a pie setting. Cod was solid, but a little too salty to my taste, and somehow the combination with beans didn't work as well as I thought texture-wise. For dessert, I had pistachio custard with cherries and caramel. Another beautifully displayed dish that for some reason didn't live up to my expectations. The restaurant, perhaps because of its location in Nolita or maybe because of mixed reviews, is relatively easy to get a reservation.

For dessert, my pistachio custard was ridiculously good. Each dish was presented as multiple bites so that each bite would be consistent in flavor. I loved every aspect of the food here.The service: we waited 20 minutes before someone came by to even take drink orders. We never even got water in between. The homemade cooked bread didn't even arrive until after the appetizer course and we had to ask for it then. No one stopped by after dessert to ask for anything else so that we could get the check.

I'm glad for it as the apps were quite small ( cannot imagine the tasting menu portions). However, none of them were really that expensive with the foi gras being the most at $19. Had the corn custard, foi, smoked scallops, and quail. Followed by the venison for entree. Portions all on the small side but didn't really notice as i was too distracted by the presentation. The entree, however, was dramatically larger. I actually thought the waitress mistakenly put in an order of two instead of us sharing one, but was told that they actually SPLIT the entrees for us. Based on how big the apps were, we did not expected that. Very happy with all the choices, everything delicious. It's a little surprising since the food is so beautifully presented, I was almost expecting crisp taste (maybe i've had too much modern french), but yet the food here are all very homey, which is nice and a bit refreshing.

This is where you take your first date.Do ask for recommendation on wine options if you are not familiar with NZ or Austrian wines like me. Service are on par though not feeling too warm. But the manager was nice enough to show me the garden and herbs they were growing/ using for cooking.Cold smoked scallops and Chatham cod in green pea puree blended with crab and topped with pickle oyster were both beautifully executed. Almost too pretty to eat! The scallop was seasoned with pickle cucumber and fermented black garlic dressing. Fresh with a spice kick. Love it! However I was not wowed. I mean, it was good but not mind blowing. Some people said the portion is small. But I think it is just the right size..I did not even finish my food.. yes I am 95 lb.

5.0,8/14/2013,I realize that quality restaurants do not typically give large portions so I started my night at a different fine dining establishment ~ Chipotle ~ It's kinda like pre-gaming before you go out drinking!  The service at the Musket Room was very attentive and all the servers were both friendly and helpful. I got  the following dishes and loved each and every one.Smoked Scallops Seared Foie Steak And Cheese Pie Some pork somethingChocolate TortLike I said everything was pretty good but the dessert was just plain ridiculous. I got the chocolate tort and almost had an orgasm in my mouth. Wait that doesn't sound right. But it was so ridiculously good I don't care how it sounds.  Someday I will tell my grandchildren about that chocolate tort.

4.0,8/11/2013,"The restaurant is very casual and low key.  The backyard is a dedicated kitchen garden.  We saw the chef picking vegetables.  This may not be a big deal for out of towners but NYC dwellers who think local means a farmers market, this is truly farm to table.The food is delicious but I agree with the other reviewers that the portions are really small.  The bread is even rationed.  The server asked us which of three types of bread loaves we wanted.  I was envisioning a nice hunk of bread for the table similar to Nomad.  We greedily asked if we could try all three.  The server produced three warm breads that were TINY.  The cheddar bacon ""loaf"" was the size of a silver dollar which at Artisanal they call a gougeres.  The baguette was the size of the small baguettes at The Modern bar where they serve 2-3 without asking.  I noticed on the bill, that the number of ""loaves"" ordered was noted.  We must have looked like pigs eating 5 cheddar bacon rolls and 2 of the other loaves.  I didn't want to ask but I really wanted another cheddar roll since it was warm and yummy.  The rationing of bread is odd.Overall, the food is visually beautiful, delicious but really small.  We are two small women.  The person I was with didn't think she could ever bring a man there for fear that he would be starving.  I tend to agree.  She had an appetizer and entree that looked like the size of an appetizer.  I had two appetizers which is usually more than sufficient for me.  We had two desserts and were not full.  That said, the smoked scallops are visually beautiful.  The dish is presented with a silver dome and the smoke billows out as the dome as its lifted.  It is reminiscent of the s'mores dessert at Saxon & Parole where the chef previously worked.  The gazpacho was poured at the table.  The server did not serve the full pour which is not usually, an issue but here, you want every morsel.  The gazpacho was incredible.  The cod was tiny and looked like an appetizer portion.  The quail which would be tiny to begin with was about three bites and that was with surgical carving.  When my guest wanted to try it, she added, I mean the tiniest of tastes.  We loved both.The chocolate dessert tastes like an amazing twix bar.  Do not be deterred by the word sponge cake.  It is not your grandmother's dry and tasteless dessert.  It is so pretty, that I had to finally whip out the camera and take a photo (below) and it is scrumptious.  The barley dessert which we initially, ordered did not fare well.  I anticipated a dessert similar to Acme but this was tasteless.  We sent it back.  There was no fuss.  We were told this dessert is a hit or miss.  If that is the review, it should be removed.The bill is presented in a box with two yummy orange and chocolate macrons.  A very nice touch.  Overall, I loved this restaurant.  The portions should just be increased a tad since the prices are not inexpensive.  Please also stop monitoring my bread intake.  I felt like the carb police were watching me.",0,3,0,Restaurantista S.,"Manhattan, NY",9,105,15

5.0,8/1/2013,"One word: magicalMy boyfriend surprised me here for my birthday dinner last night, and I haven't had a more memorable meal in my five years in New York. He decided on Musket Room after we had a drink here a month ago soon after it first opened. The bartenders were so friendly and made us several cocktails off-the-menu. Order a Vieux Carré and you won't be sorry! Every person from the hostess to bartenders to waiters were exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable about everything on the menu: which local farm it came from, the New Zealand inspiration, the background of rare Turkish wine, the story of the chefs/owners, everything. We had the corn appetizer with truffles: exquisite. The foie gras bon bons wrapped in valrhona chocolate were completely unexpected and delicious. The smoked scallops presentation was like art. We split the steak and cheese was a perfectly cooked petit filet flanked with talleggio cheese and root vegetables with puff pastry placed on top. We wanted to lick the plate. The duck with huckeberries had the same effect. Every dish was sprinkled with beautiful herbacious flowers and meticulously designed. I loved how every dish was completely inspired. So the food was amazing, obviously, but what made this meal so memorable was the friendly staff. We even got a special tour of the outdoor herb garden. It is rare in this city to find a spot with amazing food and a staff without terrible ego's - and I've found it! Tell everyone, spread the word, go to Musket Room immediately!

3.0,7/25/2013,"Arrived on a Monday night for dinner at 6:45. The back room was empty until about 7:30/8 so if you're looking for something quiet... We ordered- Smoked Scallops cucumbers, black garlic, pears and sea beans.- Quail cherries, bread sauce and roasted onion- and the Grouper, fried Coromandel oyster, peas and pickled mussels- Black barley pudding, coconut mousse, mango- Chocolate torte, blackmint ice cream, mascarpone.Presentation was beautiful but portions are TINY. It was probably the tiniest meal I've had in a while. That would be my only point of dislike about this place. overall, the food was good & an interesting play of textures and flavors.

Ordered the mushroom custard: silky and smooth but I didn't taste the black truffle that was supposed to be on it.  Also ordered the Foie Gras appetizer...you can't mess that up no matter how it's prepared.  For main ordered the steak and cheese pie...the steak was just buttery and delicious, also had the Chatham Cod entree...not memorable but just a solid good.  Didn't do the dessert course but the check came with 2 small tasty macaroons.I'll give them another try but they seriously need to up the ante for the non drinkers of soda and alcohol!",3,1,1,Jenn S.,"Point Lookout, NY",690,793,1628

1.0,7/7/2013,"After getting over our waiter's sweaty shirt, we were uninspired by a lack luster cocktail list (considering the Saxone and Parole Connection) especially in a hot dining room on a summer night. Even worse was living thru the nostalgia and decor of Elizabeth. The much raved about bite sized bacon biscuit somewhat lived up to its expectation. However, the steak and cheese pie tasted like a cold wedding filet. We started with the scallops which smelled like week left over sushi. The beet salad with goat cheese ice cream was decent but some of the beets were squishy. The venison was the best dish we had but it was made more complicated than necessary.

The passionfruit pav ands down the best pav I've ever had.  Light, sweet and refreshing and looked as good as it tasted!I had the steak and cheese pie which definitely has some notes and parallels to a steak and cheese pie back home, but it's much closer to filet mignon than something you'd pic up at the diary/corner store in NZ ;)  I also had the foie gras which was amazing!Great fit out, awesome atmosphere for a group dinner or date and delicious food!  Definitely go try it out.",1,0,0,Guy H.,"New York, NY",142,1,0

5.0,6/14/2013,"Three words: Bacon Cheddar Biscuit. Okay, well there's clearly a lot more to say than that, but the small hunk of salty-meets-subtly-sweet heaven placed on my plate alongside a dash of black sea-salted butter, set the stage for a truly fantastic meal. I must admit, I knew very little about New Zealand cuisine as I made my way down a familiar stretch of Elizabeth Street and entered the warm, white-walled & exposed brick-laden space of The Musket Room. I was immediately charmed by the rustic, yet chic interior and immediately drawn in by the pleasant din encircling the bustling center bar and surrounding wooden tables. After chatting with Shawn, their bartender about the hyper-curated list of cocktails built around liquor native to New Zealand (like 42 Below Vodka), I enjoyed the bright, apply notes of the Aphrodite, placed with seasoned ease on a thin black leather coaster. (Nice touch, I thought). After settling into the corner candle-lit banquette--perfect for people watching and date nights alike--that aforementioned biscuit, along with a sampling of their homemade rye and sourdough morsels, hit our lips, and immediately, our anticipation and expectations of what was to come skyrocketed. It had already become clear that though the restaurant has only had its doors open for mere weeks, the staff are all extremely knowledgeable--their sommelier Dane was no exception. After commenting on his bowtie and checkered shirt and jacket get-up (par for course at the Musket Room) he selected the perfect light, balanced red we were seeking to compliment our meal; and just as the he had finished his first pour, the main event arrived. We began with seared foie gras atop a small brioche with apricot and mandarin accompaniments as well as their already highly lauded smoked scallops--a dish almost too beautiful to eat. Served chilled, the smoky hints were subtle alongside bright sea beans, pears and cucumbers whereas the foie was incredibly unctuous and rich, and begged to be smeared over every bit of the brioche we could get our hands on. Small plates to be sure, but we were hooked. We dug into their sole pasta dish--an unbelievable tofu gnocchi that came bathing in roasted tomato dashi, peppered with large oyster mushrooms. While it sounds a bit odd, it was perhaps one of the best dishes I've ever tasted--the pillow-y softness of the gnocchi playing so well alongside the delicate broth and slightly chewy mushrooms that the umami was simply undeniable. Next, we tried the venison with flavors of gin and the grouper with pickled mussels, peas and a single, deep fried oyster. The former was, again, mind-blowing both in its preparation and presentation and both of our eyes lit up with a simultaneous ""mmmm"". There was absolutely no gaminess whatsoever and the flavor profiles were spot on. The grouper was an extremely fun dish to sink our teeth (and forks) into; the fish itself was light and relatively uncomplicated, but when combined with other flavors on the plate, took on an entirely new personality--hints of acid, salt, sweetness and an undeniable freshness took this dish to the next level. The bite of fried oyster goodness added yet another (insanely delicious) layer.  The only knock I'll take against The Musket Room is that the portion sizes are relatively small--especially when they come with pretty large price tags. Though, this being the case, we were still game for dessert. (And were even still a bit hungry after that to be honest) But again, we're so glad we indulged.We left on the incredibly high notes of their elegantly plated, sinfully delicious chocolate torte with mint ice cream and mascarpone as well as their lighter than air take on a traditional pavlova, this one of the passion fruit variety, nestled next to strawberries and fluffy cream. Both were absolutely delicious and an excellent duo as the silky smooth decadence of the chocolate was cut by the fruity, delicate sweet and slightly sour crispness of the meringue-like pastry. All in all, this was absolute tour de force of culinary proportions, and a nod to chef/owner Matt Lambert (born and raised in Aukland) and his spot-on sensibilities. Formerly of PUBLIC and Saxon & Parole, this guy knows what he's doing, and it's made perfectly clear from the very first bite to the very last sip. (I now know that I love food with roots in New Zealand!) We are already excited to plan our next trip--especially as once the sun returns, the herb garden--seen through wall to ceiling windows out the back of their semi-private room, (and tasted in many of their seasonally-charged herbaceous dishes)--is an extra special touch in and of itself. Oh, and did I mention they'll be rolling out brunch service in the next few months? Nice.",5,0,1,Victoria G.,"New York, NY",34,136,21

Haven't seen such a blanketed effort from ALL staff to be stellar in a long time.Went in for dinner last Wednesday, which I believe was only the first or second week they were open. Gorgeous inside, sort of rustic and classic. Very nice.Ordered a couple of drinks, one with a mezcal/tequila blend and another with rye - I don't remember names but both were awesome. Bacon and cheddar rolls and cold smoked scallops to start - all delicious. Entrees were the venison and the ""steak cheese pie"" that is more of a filet than a pie - really tasty, but if you're in the mood for pie this won't get you, FYI. I was really impressed with quality and cook of the meats - I'm a snob here - and both were literally perfect. And I mean perfect. Skipped dessert, but options looked good.Only lost a start for portions vs. price, although for presentation and quality this was far from a rip off.

This restaurant has only been open about a week and a half, but they have really hit the ground running.  The food was delicious. Not just good, but truly delicious and wonderfully prepared!  I found a few dishes caught me off guard. In a good way! Take the Cold Smoked Scallops. I didn't know what to expect, and found myself pleasantly surprised by what a delightful dish this is. It's just what it sounds like, and yet so much more. And they presented it so beautifully. I recommend the Steak and Cheese pie. It's not what you think, and you will love it! I have to be honest, I don't know a thing about New Zealand cuisine, but this has made a huge fan of the Kiwi's! The customer service was wonderful as well. I felt like every person working there was going out of their way to make sure that me and my friends and I had a wonderful experience. We did.

On charming Elizabeth street serving up New Zealand cuisine from chef Matt Lambert of Saxon + Parole, this is a perfect date spot. The long walnut bar is a great spot to catch up after work this summer and throw back something cold, and may I recommend the Scorsese, a rye whiskey concoction with egg whites and bitters. The bartenders here are always smiling and the leather coasters were a nice touch as well. I have yet to eat here so I cannot judge the dinner menu, but the room in the back is inviting with windows overlooking a garden area. The front has sexy leather banquette booths opposite the bar. Both perfectly suitable for date night. I can't wait to come back and try the seared foie gras with apricots and mandarin or the Quail with cherries and bread sauce.
