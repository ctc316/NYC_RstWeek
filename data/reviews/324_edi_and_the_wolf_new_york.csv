2.0,4/9/2019,"Went in for brunch with a group of about 10 on a Sunday. Restaurant was empty but it took forever to get just coffee and place our orders. There seemed to only be one server waiting on the entire restaurant, which became a problem when other customers started coming. Overall, very poor service that seemed overwhelmed not just by our group but by tables of 2 and 4 all around us -- everyone seemed to be waiting over 30 minutes for their simply breakfast food. The food itself was below average -- overpriced, small portions, nothing special.",0,0,0,Sean C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,12,3
2.0,2/4/2019,RW reviewBread & oil/butter- yummyAppetizers:Baby back Ribs- yummyPotato leek soup- unimpressive Entrees:Spatzle- meh. Nothing stood out. Wiener schnitzel - meh. Really meh. Nothing stood out. Desserts:Apple Strudel- goodChocolate soufflé Austrian style- in America its a chocolate lava cake.- good.Service? It was okay. Worth a repeat trip? No. Best part of the meal was the bread with oil/butter and the desserts. Upside is it was $2 less than the fixed price but I can't see why it was worth $40 for the 3 course. Worth $25 - that's being generous.,1,0,0,Judy C.,"Bronx, NY",21,55,5
4.0,1/28/2019,"I enjoyed Edi & the Wolf minus a few thoughts. Pros: The ambiance, mood, crowd, lighting, vibe and service were great! We had an 8pm res on a Sat night. Place was packed. Seated right away. They never rushed us. We actually stayed until 11pm and closed the place down. So, the experience was lovely!Con: I think they're going for a German/Austrian version of a farm-to-table menu. While that's lovely, the menu is very limited. There are maybe 5 options for entrees and I didn't find them unique. Burger, Wiener schnitzel, duck, trout. The menu is not very inventive. And we were a group of 4 that are all German and attend very, very German restaurants and bier gardens in very ethnic parts of New York where the ""German food"" is way better. So, I wish they would expand the menu and have some more creative options for such a creative space.",0,0,1,Julia C.,"New York, NY",0,50,0

5.0,10/25/2018,I visited New York in October 2018 from Minnesota to see Eric Clapton at Madison Square Garden. Edi and the Wolf was a short walk from my East Village AirBnB.   Wow!  Do not miss this venue.  The burger was a custom mix of beef from a local meat artisan.  A shared desert: awesome.  All of it was Crazy delicious.  The decor is very warm and intimate.  Our very pleasant waiter was from Europe.  The front opens to the street on nice fall days.  Call a Taxi/Uber.  Do it.,0,0,0,Kent S.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,14,0
5.0,9/25/2018,"We went for a last minute quick trip to NYC, but we wanted to have a really good dinner... So who do you ask? Well, I asked my friend Chef Michael for a recommendation to one of his friend's restaurants. He immediately contacted Eddi and helped me with the reservation. I have to confess that I was not convinced, as I'm not a big fan of German food, but he had already called, so we decided to go.  BEST decision ever!!!This place is a small restaurant with dimmed lights and a feeling between old warehouse/barn and an open patio.  It has about 8-10 tables/booths plus a long one in the middle, shares by different parties. Very welcoming and, at the same time, cool decor.For appetizers, we ordered the octopus and the cures bacon, usually, I think the octopus has a rubberish consistency, this one was cooked (grilled to perfection). For entrees, we had the chicken (so juicy!!!) And the short ribs (sooooo full of flavor).  Finally, we were not hungry anymore, but how can you be at such a great German place and not have their strudel... Well we were lucky and got as a courtesy of the house the chocolate volcano (I honestly don't remember the exact name) I don't eat chocolate, but the people that tried both loved them.  I have to say that the strudel was worth the calories!If you're in the East Village in NYC you HAVE to visit this place.",3,0,1,Pita M.,"Snellville, GA",100,137,567
5.0,7/7/2018,"My friend and I wanted to try something new and in a different location than were I live, in Hell's Kitchen. So we decided to go down to the east village and have some German food. As soon as I saw it, I knew I had made the right decision. I loved the way it's setup inside. The seating, and the rustic charm of the decor made it very comfortable. The staff was really sweet and attentive and the food very enjoyable. I would definitely go back and would recommend this place to friends.",0,0,0,George S.,"Manhattan, NY",1029,5,0
3.0,6/10/2018,"Came here with family and friends and was not overly impressed. Nothing really wrong here just not the best kitchen incarnations and a bit pricey. For example $19 for pasta (that's what spaetzle are) and a rather small bowl of all vegan ingredients is a bit off.The wienerschnitzel, although good was not memorable, a bit thin and dry. My son's Wolf burger was on a cheap bun and definitely far from his ""best burger"". The Neuburger 2011 white wine from the Austrian hills pretty darn good at $60 a bottle, but again that's a steep price for wine that sells in Austria for probably $8 (*a bottle, not per glass).I would say the best thing we had was the smoked meat appetizers. The speck (bacon) especially good.

5.0,4/6/2018,"This place was on my list for about 5 years and I finally made it happen! I was really shocked by how incredible the food, the service, and the atmosphere was. It's not easy to make Austrian food appeal to people, especially if you are a vegetarian or a vegan, but Edi & the Wolf does a FLAWLESS job at making unique Austrian cuisine that is accessible for everyone. As soon as I got there, I was already in love with the decor from the outside of the restaurant, and the inside was even better. It is dimly lit and extremely cozy, and although the room is small, it is spacious and comfortable. I love restaurants that have a rustic feel, and this place really nails it! Our waitress was wonderful(Unfortunately I didn't get her name, but she was great!) and considering how busy it got, she was always attentive to our table. Now for the best part about this place...the food!!! I was seriously blown away. I just went to Austria in January and I was wondering how a trendy downtown Manhattan spot could ever make this food appealing. The modern spin on classic Austrian dishes was genius, and there was something on the menu for everyone(which is a little harder to find in Austria.) my favorite dishes were the octopus, the flatbread, and the burger. The burger was one of the BEST I have ever had in the city. Also, they had an oyster happy hour which was a nice surprise. Overall, Edi & the Wolf has become one of my favorite restaurants and I can't wait to come back here. If I lived in the east village, I would be coming here every week for those oysters and that burger. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! 5++++ STARS!",1,0,1,Katie T.,"Manhattan, NY",351,80,29
5.0,3/22/2018,"Went here recently with my boyfriend late in the evening ~ the atmosphere is lovely and romantic, like the inside of a dark magical old ship or something.  Got the wolf burger, spatzle, and roasted beat salad. ~ all were insanely delicious ~ the burger was super juicy and one of the better burgers I've ever had.  The roasted beat salad was so yummy I could probably eat it every day of my life and not get tired of it. A very unique and delicious dressing with perfectly balanced ingredients. The spatzle was super creamy and filling.  Super crazy full after ~ we were given a token for two free drinks at their nearby bar but had to bumble home like two big roly polys instead ~ but well stop by soon :) I look forward to going again and trying out the rest of what is on the menu ~ what a lovely and magical place",1,1,1,Amanda F.,"Brooklyn, NY",86,58,19

4.0,3/6/2018,"What a great establishment! From the decor and service to all of the options on the menu for food and drinks this place was great all the way through and is worth a stop.My one complaint is the Wiener schnitzel wasn't my favorite. Too much breading and not enough pork, and the pork was a little dry. Everything else though was delicious. The pickled vegetables to the Brussels sprouts, to the crispy fries, octopus and of course the schnitzel! That was by far the best item on the menu and is a must-order. The drink menu was great as well with some lovely cocktails we sampled like the restaurant's version of an old fashion.

They also serve cheese and bread before the meal, delicious! For dessert we got the apple strudel and chocolate soufflé - both were great, but not very shareable. The servings were rich but small, definitely need to order more than one for a group of people to share. The service was great and very friendly and attentive!

5.0,11/27/2017,"Edi & the Wolf brings rustic decor and amazing German food to Alphabet City! I'd been to the area before and noticed the unique design of the entryway before of the restaurant, but the name of the restaurant was only written on the board sitting out front (from what I could see). Inside the restaurant, is an incredibly cozy design with a romantic ambiance with dim lights and darker wood. We made a reservation in advance and were greeted and seated quickly by an incredibly friendly staff. The front was full, so we were seated in the back, which was nice and quiet and great for chatting with our group. After checking out the menu and having seen pictures online our whole group went for the schnitzel and were not let down. The pork had a great crispy fry to it without being overly thick, which is what I expect in a good schnitzel. It was more than enough to eat, but we had ordered fries to be safe and those were tasty, although pretty much unneeded. The cocktails were also great! I went with the Johnny Apple Smoke which felt like a good option for a cold Friday night. Loved the big slide of green apple as a garnish. Definitely recommend checking out for a date night with reservations in advance!",2,1,1,Denay W.,"New York, NY",323,237,799
4.0,11/27/2017,"This rustic looking German restaurant certainly stands out from the crowd. Actually, it hard not to miss along the street. This is caddie corner across from Zum Schneider. The German fare here is a bit lighter than the usual that we are familiar with. The small restaurant with is shared benched seating is casual but can be a little tight on a crowded night. The evening we went by the time we were seated, the early dinner crowd had thinned out a bit. Our server came to by to get our drink and food. Overall the quality of the food was excellent and tasted great. We certainly enjoyed the food there. The staff was friendly and service was good.

2.0,9/24/2017,"So-so, completely forgettable dinner.  Decor is rustic - think hunting cabin.  Gin/basil, cucumber cocktail was annoyingly sweet and had very little gin.  Aperol spritzer was tasty.  Labnah-like fresh cheese in olive oil made for a pleasant spread on fresh bread.  Short ribs were cooked dry and covered with a blah, sweet-ish sauce.  Wiener Schnitzel was fried to dryness and and the meat had no particular taste.  Accompanying berry jam helped slightly.  Side German-style potato salad was tasty as was the side cucumber tsatsiki. Overall okay but blah food.  Service was attentive - better than in other reviews.  No real reason to stop here in a neighborhood full of varied eating options.",0,0,0,Rich H.,"New York, NY",8,187,0
5.0,9/16/2017,"Visited on a whim with my lady after promising myself to further explore Alphabet City. Edi & the Wolf did not disappoint.Even on a Friday night at 9, we were seated almost immediately, Upon entering you're greeted by a rustic menagerie of foliage and wood; manilla rope hangs insouciantly from the ceiling. It is hip, but not intimidatingly so. The tables are community style dining setting where couples are seated across from one another. I expected the accommodation to feel cramped, and while it was the intoxicating aroma of horseradish and fresh bread quickly lulls you away. Our waitress arrived within two minutes of us being seated. She was warm and friendly, carefully inspecting the rhythm of conversation to choose the ample moment to hear our cocktail orders. We chose the Gin's Jewels, an effervescent combination of gin, sparkling rosè and strawberry; a wonderful dessert cocktail poorly suited to the start of a meal, but an apt pairing to the end of one, and a refreshing gin and dill cocktail. Both were well executed, but neither revolutionary. The starters menu had many highlights. Cuts of flaky bread with a diverse set of spreads and cheeses, seared octopus scattered among fingerling potatoes and chimichurri sauce, but most notable was the dish I did not order; a succulent plate of baby back ribs slathered in sauce cut only by the sharpness of horseradish and mustard lying beneath; accompanied by a dish of coleslaw acting as a maven mediating the fierce contrast of the sharp and sweet. As the plate was placed in front of the couple next to me I was transfixed. Despite this, with an enticing sounding short rib just a few spots down the menu and my girlfriend's draw to the Wolf Burger we decided three courses of red meat would overwhelm and ultimately infeeble us, and chose the octopus instead. Our waitress whisked backed to the kitchen and seemingly moments later a slab of slate with a tapestry of greens, purples, and oranges was presented to us. Dots of molten orange chimichurri lined the plate's edge. Five crispy pieces of octopus lie out like sunbathers on the slab, guarded by fingerling potato dividers. It is a scene that looks crafted, thoughtfully choreographed as if it's performing for us. Yet on top lies a comically large stalk of green onion, flopped over the delicately placed octopus like a drunk tourist passed out in a land unknown and unappreciated. The octopus was delightful, cooked to perfection and still fresh from the oven; their crisp masking a tender meaty center; with the fingerling potatoes dutifully complimenting the show stealing octopus. The chiimichurri enhanced every bite and gave deference to the simplicity with which the octopus and potatoes were prepared. After one minute I hesitantly ceded the last piece of octopus knowing it is my girlfriend's favorite. The table over to our left had a small side dish of crispy brussel sprouts. We heard each forkful making a satisfying audible crunch as they slowly disappear. No discussion required, in shared impulse we opt for the heftier bowl portion, it arrived shortly after the thought entered my mind. Hopes of creating our own satisfying crunches were quickly satisfied. The brussel sprouts were roasted to perfect, shedding their outer layers in the bowl as the salt and lemon juice dried them up. Accompanying was a familiar face, the sharp horseradish enjoyed by the ribs made a guest appearance. The brussel sprouts were divine, the horseradish a treat. This frumpy, green, unassuming, underdog, outperformed itself. This was the high point of an impressive meal. Now, sufficiently full of horseradish and chimichurri our meals arrive. Hers is the Wolf Burger a meaty patty, dripping with gruyere comfortably nested in a sesame bun that would seem in character next to a soda jerk. She ordered a side of fries seemingly as a matter of almost religious tradition. I'm glad she did, they are crispy recreations of a tried and true classic. Some traditions exist for a reason. Alongside are the house ketchup, a ketchup reimagining that can't seem to decide if it's ketchup, curry, or siracha, and a bacon aioli, that as is the case with many aiolis is really just mayonaisse that lucked into a corner office. I ordered short rib, medium rare. It sat a atop a bed of unidentifiable mushrooms and a puree of apple and onion that in their alchemy create a rich creamy mashed potatoes. The short rib and I were both dripping with anticipation. But atop were tangled and twisting branches of fried onion, blocking my path to the real prize. As I look over to the burger there they are again. A naturally occurring barbed wire slowing the aggressive poking and prodding of our forks. We swept them away, relegating them to the pile of debris they are. The burger was good, but never lived up to its ambitions of greatness.  The spare rib however was juicy and tender, the mushrooms created a chorus to the spare rib's vibrato. Alphabet City never tasted so good!",4,3,2,Kyle S.,"New York, NY",30,2,0

4.0,8/10/2017,"Live in the neighborhood but first time at this restaurant.  Previous reviews have been helpful, so I'll try and add a little more color.  Ordered the oysters to start - and were disappointed overall.  $3 / oyster is relatively expensive and there was no selection offered.  The ones served were ok, but fairly bland.  Forgettable.  My girlfriend has several food allergies and the waitress was great with those - offering suggestions and knowledgeable, as well as checking with the chef.  I note this is different from the experience of other reviewers.  Had the burger and my girlfriend the octopus appetizer.  Both were ok, but nothing memorable, which echoed the experience with the house wine.  The service was friendly and attentive and the restaurant had a nice vibe / atmosphere, particularly with the window/door open.  Overall I'm giving this a 4, mainly because of the service, but I won't put this on my list of regulars mainly because of the instantly forgotten cuisine.",0,0,0,David M.,"Yulan, NY",1,28,0

My boyfriends duck was literally two slices out of a breast. Also it was the coldest day of 2016 and they had no door guard to keep the air out. My feet were almost hypothermic. And it didn't matter where we were seated, we moved twice and were still freezing. I don't know if it's still laid out the same way but there's a long center table and essentially you sit 4 inches from other people at a big picnic table.

5.0,6/22/2017,"I came to Edi & the Wolf this past Wednesday night. I made a reservation for 2 through OpenTable and upon arrival I was seated almost immediately. It was not that crowded at first but over the course of the next 2 hours the restaurant was at about 65% capacity (which is the perfect amount of people in my opinion). The decor gave off a rustic and industrial vibe which made for a great date spot.We were seated nearest to the door and because it was a summer night they had the windows open which allowed a nice breeze to come through and cool the place down. We looked over the menu and because we had some food restrictions (GF,DF) we made sure to ask the waitress about certain menu items. After mulling over the menu we went with the wiener schnitzel and Roasted chicken ( and substituted the pommes puree for asparagus). The waitress did not seem to know a ton about what exactly what was/wasn't in the dish and at first this caused some mild frustration but after going back and talking with the chef everything was sorted out accordingly.We also placed an order of fries but this seemed to get lost in the order. Our food arrived and we began to eat and about halfway through we realized the fries never came. We asked our waitress about them and she stated we never ordered them, although we most certainly did. This was not a big deal though as the waitress put a rush on the fries and they came out almost immediately. I had the Wiener Schnitzel and it was quite delicious. It was ever so flavorful yet not over saturated with seasoning. The lingonberry jam was questionable and i did not love the bitter taste of it as it was extremely potent. I choose to not eat this portion of the dish. Overall our experience was very good and it was a great evening in Alphabet cityThe only recommendation would be to put some AC or fans in the bathroom as this was almost like a hot box and was extremely uncomfortable",1,1,1,Lex B.,"Manhattan, NY",387,31,29

2.0,5/10/2017,"Wandered in a few weeks ago after the brunch place we were heading towards unexpectedly opened half an hour later than we thought. Strange how Alphabet City is a ghost town at 11 am on a Saturday. Our only real goal had been to eat outside or near it (have to take advantage of every early day of warmth!), and this looked rustically cute and was open to the street.She seated us pretty far back away from the street (2/3 into the dining room), so assumed there was a large party coming... nope, seated a guy much closer to it and no one else came in during the hour or so we were here. Maybe our fault not for asking, but seemed weird.Everyone we interacted with here seemed as if they had just come out of a coma and were befuddled as to how they got here. My boyfriend asked if they did iced coffee and the server seemed entirely baffled by the concept. (We did find out, 5 minutes later, that they in fact did.) I predicted that she wouldn't know what was in the daily frittata, and I was correct. Beyond that, service was slow, as the 4 (!) people working a nearly empty room drifted around aimlessly.Our food took a solid 25 minutes to come out. My frittata was good, not great. It came slightly cooled; I don't think they timed it right with my partner's entree. Something in it was overly salty (the mushrooms? too much cheese?), but the kale in it was well-cooked. I was pleasantly surprised by my side salad, which was perfectly dressed with soft, springy greens. Our other dish was an arrangement of fried German food (spaetzle and chicken?). My boyfriend devoured it and I liked the bites of it I tried. Pretty salty too.Overall, I had an alright experience here. Price was steep for unexceptional food. The meal seemed to drag on, and bewilderment is not the first quality I look for in my waiters. And maybe the ambiance is romantic at night, but in the bright daylight all of the dried plants looked dusty and sad. Ultimately, it wouldn't be my pick for brunch as there's much better in the area; perhaps they do better with dinner.",2,2,1,Liz S.,"New York, NY",952,772,1843

3.0,4/3/2017,"I made reservations for Edi and the Wolf for my boyfriend's birthday.  He had been there before and loved this place so I figured a birthday dinner there would be great. We got there around 8pm and were seated within a couple of minutes in the back patio.  Was pretty cool back there, a little more private. We were seated at a 2 person table which was perfectly fine but it felt like that table was just stuck there. Was kind of in the way of the servers and people coming in and out. The table itself was basically falling apart, the boards on it were detached so we had to eat carefully, we even ended up spilling the water because the table was so wobbly. It was also raining outside so every once and a while we would get dripped on. We ordered drinks and then maybe 15 minutes later ordered our apps and food. The waitress came over a couple times to apologize for our drinks taking so long. Once the drinks were made, a waiter came into the patio with them and went to every table asking if they had ordered them but ours even though we kept trying to get his attention to say that they were for us. The waiter walked out of the room with the drinks and it took another 5 minutes for them to figure out they were ours and to come back out with them. About 2 minutes after we got our drinks the apps came out.  We ordered the baby back ribs which were really good. Super tender and flavorful and we ordered the octopus which was good, a little mushy though. About 5 minutes after we got our apps, our dinners arrived. So in about a 10 minute span we got our drinks, apps, and dinners while all the tables around us who were there before us hadn't gotten any of their food yet, just drinks. For some reason it felt like they were rushing just us through dinner which was a little annoying. I ordered the spätzle with fried onions, chilies, and rainbow chard. It was really good. Nice and hearty for the crappy day it was outside. My boyfriend ordered the short rib which he said he really enjoyed. After dinner he ordered an espresso and I ordered a coffee. That alone took longer to come out then all the food we had ordered. It took about 25-30 minutes. We then asked for the check which took another 20 minutes to get.  So overall the food was good, the service was odd, and the back patio, while it is cool looking, needs some work.",0,0,0,Lisa M.,"Clark, NJ",0,1,0

2.0,3/25/2017,"Stumbled in on this place when another restaurant we wanted to go to was full. We were drawn in by the cool, rustic decor and atmosphere. It was super busy and without a reservation we were sat in the middle of a giant communal table, which we don't mind.The food was not worth the price. We started off with the pickled vegetables; the radishes were so full of vinegar it was hard to eat and the carrots looked like they were bought at the corner bodega and were sitting there for 2 weeks. My boyfriend got the short ribs and I got the ravioli. The ravioli was nothing spectacular, very bland with runny ricotta inside them. My boyfriend's hunk of short rib was cold like it had been sitting around for a while and he could barely finish it. We left still hungry because the portions are small. I'm ok with paying money for small plates if it's out of this world delicious, but this...not worth it.

2.0,3/6/2017,"Maybe we came on a really bad night.This weekend was freezing, so although we had reservations at a place down the street, my German roots led me to ditch our other reso in favor of German comfort food.  The food ended up being ok, but the service left a pall over the evening.Ten minutes after we put our order of apps and mains in, our waitress let us know that they did not have the potato leek soup.  Would have been good to know prior, but we picked another app.  Then, she came back 10 minutes later with our entrees before we had received our apps.  We ordered more wine and chalked it up to someone new in the kitchen/new waitstaff.  When the main course came back out, it was barely warm.  Like they had taken our main courses and stuck them under a heat lamp while they made our apps.  Why would you put cold/old food in front of a customer?  Wouldn't you want to put your best food forward?  Puzzling.Final straw, they dropped the dessert menu and we had to flag someone down to order dessert and coffee.  Lo and behold...after we ordered the waitress came back ...no apple streusel.  Three snafus at 5:30pm on a Sunday evening.  There were two other tables in the restaurant.   Staff needs better training.",2,1,0,Jade O.,"New York, NY",40,40,2

From the intriguing exterior design to the lightly dim interior and superior service and delicious food, there is nothing Edi & The Wolf does not offer.Came in on a Friday for dinner with a friend and we opted to try the Flatbread and I had the Short Rib. My oh my, the flatbread was a cheesy bread goodness. Every bite had me craving more! The creme fraiche and gruyere combined together with something that tasted tangy like barbecue sauce really completed this flatbread! My entree, the Short Rib was surprisingly the furthest thing from dry and cooked perfectly to medium rare. Straight down from the sauce to the celery root purée, I basically licked the whole plate. Every bite was flavorful, seasoned perfectly and cooked well. Opt to make a reservation at a table or you might be sitting at a communal table.

We got seated in the back room which was cozy and a little more private. I have sat at the bar which is also enjoyable if you don't mind sitting on a high-seat all night.

4.0,1/20/2017,"My boyfriend and I have been wanting to try this restaurant for so long. I was struggling to find a good Austrian/German restaurant since my last visit to Europe. We made a reservation for Friday night at 7:30pm and right when we walked in, the restaurant started filling up. Decor was very interested and it felt super cozy with the dim lighting and candles on the table. I was seated in the middle section of tables and if it was possible to sit at a booth. You need to ask for it when you make your reservation.Kudos for the great cocktail menu and delicious bread (how can I not love the bread)!! We pretty much knew what we wanted to eat: spaetzle and schnitzle. So obviously we were quick to order. We also couldn't decide between the two sides, so we had both the pomme frites and brussel sprouts. When I took my first bite of the spaetzle, I thought I was in Berlin again! But, I must say... the texture was a little off, but can be considered better than everything else I've had. The schnitzle could be a little more tender, but of course decent! Definitely pair it with the jam provided. The pomme frites comes with 4 dips and all are tasteful. One is actually a potato salad. Okay, my favorite was the brussel sprouts!!! Seriously, just eat brussel sprouts as your entree. We finished off our dinner with the apple strudel. Very tangy and very good way to end a wonderful dinner. Everything was well portioned, but we were obviously stuffed. We devoured the whole meal pretty quickly. Haha!",2,1,4,Celeste Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",180,239,1071

2.0,12/30/2016,We had Dinner at the Restaurant on Christmas. Very nice Ambience. Food was great and Drinks are good.The reason why I give only 2 Stars is that we find the portion are way to small and overpriced. The Protein  side was good but Vegetables and starch common guys. I good 4 little green Beans and a spoon of farro Risotto on the side. My wife had the short ribs and good a small spoon of root mash. I am not sure why is that I appricate the seasonal vegetable a lot but being cheap with cheap vegetable just is not right.The apple strudel was good but really a half piece? We had a course meal and left still hungry. You guys charge a great $$ for this food and clearly is great but is not work well the money if you be cheap on side dishes.

4.0,12/29/2016,"I took my 18 year old daughter here on a Wednesday nite.  She doesnt come in to the city often and i thought why not go with ""different"" versus something more traditional.  Austrian is different for us.  First impression is the outdoor entrance which makes you feel as if you're walking into a Lord of the Rings bar.  Okay maybe that's a stretch but maybe... it isnt.  We liked the entrance.  Walk in and it's a decent sized space.. communal long table in the middle and separate tables on each side of the communal table.  It works.  Small to medium sized bar.  We're seated right away.  Hostess great.  Waitress great.  Hostess was very attentive to water fillage constantly even though the bottle was right next to us we didnt have to lift a finger.  That is a very small detail that made me feel like she really cared about our experience.  Waitress was great, suggestions were great.  I had the Schnitzel, daughter had the braised short ribs.. bangin.  Food and service great.. Okay I kinda let this one fly but (SIGH).. I had to use the rest room.  #1 nothing crazy..

The servers are busy so service isn't prompt and took a while to take any drink or food orders. Guys next to me get food first after ordering perhaps fifteen twenty minutes after I do.

The interior is exquisitely designed and feels like a marriage between ""my secret garden"", a rustic nautical bar, and the Pinterest board of a tinkering mad scientist- it's really something to see.The meal started with a few versions of bread and a delicious ricotta style butter/oil concoction. We all but licked the bowl on that one, really delicious. For appetizers, we ordered the baby back ribs and flatbread. They were both excellent and perfect for sharing.The three of us ordered the chicken, spatzle, and wiener schnitzel to share. All three dishes were excellent and well portioned but the spatzle stood out to me as the top dog on the table. I had never had it before, and likened it to a mac and cheese with crispy onions and spinach situation. It's rich but not overbearing, a real treat.We weren't blown away by the desert menu so we opted for desert elsewhere, but there seemed to be some decent choices for others.In summary, I really recommend this spot as a delightful little gem with great service and eclectic food.

4.0,4/12/2016,"I went to Edi & the Wolf last night for the the first time (myself and three girlfriends- two of which are very much into food/one picky eater.) First off-- You feel like you're walking into the secret garden. It's majestic, dark cozy- heavy on the greenery, plants, ropes. It was a Monday night, so the restaurant wasn't jam packed, but many of the tables were filled-- The service was attentive and very nice.We started with the flat bread, the octopus, and the liptauer & pumpkin seed spread. The flat bread was delicious- I would absolutely recommend getting as an appetizer. The spreads were okay-- Do not get if you are not a fan of cream cheese, as I believe both spreads are cream cheese based. However, I would skip the spreads. With that said, the bread they have is fantastic. The octopus honestly wasn't so memorable. It is a small portion-- three very small pieces of octopus. Since I split it between 3 other people, perhaps that's why it wasn't so memorable. Onto the entrees-- My friend and I split both the schnitzel and the spatzle. Both we great-- I am officially a spatzle fan. If you get the schnitzel, take advantage of the cucumber and potato salad sizes along with it. My two other friends both got the chicken entrees and both really enjoyed them. We got the cauliflower side as well- Get it. I could have eaten a whole bowl of it.Overall, it was a both a very good meal and very good experience.

It brought together sweet, sour, and salty flavors into one bite. The place has a nice ambience and there was no wait. I probably would have enjoyed it more had we ordered a wider varied of foods. Also, I would highly recommend the Alpine Mule cocktail!",0,0,1,Diana J.,"San Francisco, CA",0,37,5

2.0,2/21/2016,"Excellent food, terrible service.  We have been to Edi & the Wolf a few times and I was looking forward to this return visit.  The food is excellent and the ambiance is cosy and comfortable.  The service however was TERRIBLE.  We ordered appetizers & dinner & two cocktails, our appetizers arrived and we had to ask for our drinks two times.  Moving on to dinner, the waitress mixed up the order and served two servings of spaetzle rather than an order of spaetzle and schnitzel.  They brought the order of schnitzel and once we were finished with dinner, the waitress asked ""do we need anything else"" rather than would you like to see a dessert menu.  We ordered dessert which was delicious and another drink, again I had ask for my drink 2 times was told it was coming and then was eventually told (after we nearly finished our dessert) that they did not have any sambuca.  Definitely a disappointment given past experiences, the excellent food and the michelin rating....",0,0,0,Heather K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0

4.0,2/1/2016,"We spotted the restaurant far down the street with its hanging baskets, iron steps, ten or so large potted plants, wooden benches, rusted chains, vintage style garage door and gas lamp - all very uncool but cool New York hip. Edi and the Wolf is a spin off from Michelin Starred chef's Eduard Frauneder and Wolf Ban and offers Austrian fare in a setting inspired by an Austrian wine tavern known as a Heuriger. We'd booked on the Open Table app and remembered to mention it to the server to collect the dining points. She seated us quickly at a wooden bench and table and brought us a pretty bottle of tap water and some artsy narrow highball glasses. Lou ordered bottled water, which they didn't have and a tasty cocktail with bourbon and an apple liquor sprinkled with cinnamon with some hefty almost perfectly square ice cubes bobbing around in it.We ordered quickly from the leather bound menu and noticed that everybody had bread, so we asked for some and it was delicious, with nigella seeds running through the whole wheat dough. We asked for butter and ended up with ricotta in lemon olive oil which was pleasant but not what we really wanted - still we knew we were eating at a restaurant which was on the unusual side for us, so suspending the imagination in terms of having exactly what we wanted was expected. The cosy, rustic atmosphere had a very charming feel as if you could easily wander through exploring the various pretty plates, animal horns, dried flowers and glass trinkets adorning the shelves. Our appetisers came quickly - Pickled Vegetables to share and Romaine Wedge for him. The delicately pickled carrots were deliciously crunchy with a slightly sweet hint and just enough salt to make them tastier not salty. The other pickled vegetables were nice but it's the carrots who were the winner for me. Lou cut me off a chunk from his wedge salad and it was nice and refreshing with pickled fennel, olive crumble (which neither of us could distinguish until we ate it alone) and charred cucumber. What a contrast to normal American style wedge salads which are usually drenched in blue cheese dressing with the only relief being a tiny cherry tomato or two. We sat happily whilst our plates were taken away - me devouring the bread crusts with the oil and leaving the soft middle doughy parts with the ricotta for Lou. Just as I debated asking for more, my entrée of Lentil Stew with black garlic, crème fraiche and beech mushrooms arrived. It was hearty, savoury, rich and dark reddish brown with a huge blob of crème fraiche and a generous handful of some non-descript microgreen. I couldn't help noticing the mushrooms were oyster and not beech and even though it was delicious it irked me that they didn't say when I ordered. Lou's Baby Back Ribs with honey and beer glaze, bacon slaw and ""awesome"" mustard was apparently delicious and made me ponder that with most restaurants in America there was definitely more than a hint of the American in with the Austrian flavours. We had a side of house made fries with bacon aioli and house ketchup (which was distinctly not Heinz with a less sweet more tomato taste) and crispy Brussel sprouts with curry vinaigrette, shallot marmalade and cilantro. With just a smattering of cilantro it didn't really impact the dish in any way and the curry vinaigrette only really came through on the last few sprouts which hung out bathing at the bottom of the bowl. I love the natural mustard sprout flavour and it was only really present on the few little balls of intact sprout which had made it through the roasting process and remained green. Still the bowl went back to the kitchen empty so perhaps I'm being too critical. Completely full and with no space for dessert I was ready to go home but Lou had read up on the restaurant and insisted we stay to try the apple strudel which was apparently what everyone comes for. I looked on the menu for a Sacher Torte but there was none to be found, much to the disappoint of not just me but also a Russian fellow diner on a neighbouring table. I explained to her that the Hotel Sacher were the only place allowed to use the name Sacher Torte, however we both agreed that there should be a chocolate cake type thing with cream on the menu. The strudel was absolutely delicious with a well baked, golden base and light crisp layers over firm but not crunchy apple and tiny pieces of what I think were walnuts. A light crème Anglaise decorated the plate but wasn't enough to really be a part of the dessert and a small spoon of crème Chantilly was on top of the pretty square of strudel. I think they may have made it like a baklava in a tray rather than folded like a long log but however they did it, it was light and just sweet enough.",2,1,0,Pamela P.,"Hoboken, NJ",3,35,29
5.0,1/29/2016,"One of my favorite recent finds in the east village, will definitely be back soon.  Cosy, intimate and beautifully decorated German restaurant, starters and mains were both incredible. We shared the ribs for a starter which were soft and delicious. My boyfriend and I had the schnitzel and duck ravioli for mains respectively, whilst the schnitzel was delicious, the ravioli was potentially one of the tastiest raviolis I've had in awhile Ambience was relaxed, waitress did not once try rush us.

4.0,1/28/2016,"I adore this place and am now reminded that I am due for a visit here. It's been way too long.  One of the things I love most about this restaurant is the gorgeous interior. It's just what I like.  The decor has a gritty rusticism to it that is gussied up only slightly with elegant touches like tufted banquets, wildflowers, and hanging greenery, that look so interesting against a backdrop of reclaimed wood, steel and nautical roping. My initial thought when walking in was that it reminded me of the underbelly of old ship, but in actuality it's fashioned to look like an Austrian wine tavern. In the back is a beautiful secret garden room that I love. The atmosphere is a little more whimsical, green and earthy. To top it all off, they play great music which only adds to the atmosphere. The menu features mainly Austrian classics and comfort food as well as some other fun things mixed in. Everything is done simply and done well, which I appreciate.  There is continuity across all aspects of the Edi experience, which seems to be going for a very homey, inviting feel that allows guests to just relax and enjoy the moments shared there with friends and special someones.  Service was excellent and they make great cocktails. Definitely one of my favorite New York spots for a casual, relaxed evening.",6,3,4,Christina G.,"New York, NY",401,474,103
5.0,1/25/2016,"Very impressed by this quaint restaurant! It comes across almost as unassuming: there's no sign outside and really just looks like a chic, underground bunker/overrun garden. But I have to say I was SUPER impressed with everything I encountered here: the classy, sophisticated yet casual atmosphere, friendly service and beyond delicious menu offerings!A group of friends and I came here on a Friday night (we had made reservations) but ended up waiting an hour at the small bar in the back before we were able to be seated. As a result, we received a round of free drinks and appetizers on the house! Of course you win points with that thoughtful gesture.Fast forward to the meal: hot damn. Could NOT get enough. Especially the schnitzel (served with cucumber and potato salads) and spatzel (w/mushrooms and peas). To DIE for: so rich and bursting with flavor.

2.0,1/5/2016,"The food was excellent. The service was very poor though. We had an 8:30 pm reservation, but we were kept waiting for over 30 minutes and then placed in a poorly isolated cold room in the back of the restaurant. We were invited to have a cocktail while we waited and assumed that it would be on the house due to the long wait and the fact that the waitress clearly said the word invite, but it was later added to the check. Food was very good but there was a 45 minutes blank between appetizers and entrees. The worst part of the service was yet to come though: another 30 minutes waiting for the check despite asking for it several times. The check  had the service charge included and we handed our cards to the waitress. After another long wait, she came back with the individulized receipts. And some minutes after that she came back again to tell us that she had actually made a mistake and the service charge had not been included in our receipts and asked us to manually add it. We were very unhappy at this point and asked to talk to the superviser, who had apparently already left. And she was right to do so: at this point it was past 12:30 am. We were the last clients in the restaurant and left while the staff was finishing cleaning up. In all, a 4-hour stay at the restaurant, most of it waiting (for a table, for the entrees, for the check, for the receipts...).

4.0,1/3/2016,"New Year's Eve was interesting to say the least. I came the year before for the ball drop and it was awesome. The place was so crazy I wish I had come in to dinner. So now fast forward to this New Year's Eve I came for the early menu and was surprised with the selection available. It was advertised as a three course set menu for the earlier seating but upon seeing the menu we had a few options to chose from. The crudo was delish, the short rib was excellent, and the chocolate cake so good. The service was ok for the most part our server just seemed a little flustered. The only other part of the night that was a small let down was that the steak was not available for the three course menu.

1.0,1/1/2016,"We wanted to do a nice dinner for NYE, so four of us went here to spend a bit more than usual on the five course fixed price menu. I don't normally do Yelp reviews but the experience here motivated me. The restaurant wasn't that busy, but the staff struggled at effectively managing the place.Pros:+ Most of the dishes were pretty good+ Complimentary glass of wine - due to issues below.Cons: - They served two of us a 3rd course dish and then left the other two people waiting for a meal for 5-10 minutes. When we raised the question, it turned out the couple at the next table should have received those dishes, and they were also left waiting longer. - When the two missing 3rd course dishes were supposed to be served, we were given 4th course dishes instead. Despite the mistake, these were left on our table for a while, maybe to make us eat them. Eventually they were taken away, and a while after that we were given the 3rd course. - One of our party chose the vegetarian menu, and the eventual 3rd course for them was the same as their 2nd course. It turned out for their previous 2nd course, they were accidentally given 3rd course. Despite that, the staff left that there and expected the person to eat the same dish twice in a row, which they did because they were sick of waiting - The 4th course was brought out before we were half finished the third course and left on the table next to our plates. It turned out their hurry was due to the original 4th course was just left in the oven rather than being remade. So when it came back to the table it was pretty overcooked, crusted and wilted as you'd expect from a dish that had been left in an oven for 20 minutes after it had already been cooked and plated- Service was curt, and the main impression was total confusion. We would be asked variations on the the same questions by different people. Who had received what dish, who was up to which course, 'point out to me what you've eaten so far on this menu'. No genuine apologetic attitude for all of this.- Some wine glasses provided weren't clean, had smears from people's hands or lips on them. Sure that's happened in restaurants before, but these guys didn't have our confidence at this point.- We widn't get the dessert listed on the menu, they served us something else, but they didn't bother to tell us that after all the other problems throughout the meal.",5,1,0,Liam P.,"New York, NY",1,3,2
4.0,12/29/2015,"I came here with #brian to celebrate the end of a wonderful year. We had bookmarked this place a few months ago, and were excited to finally have a chance to go. Definitely the standout part of this experience was the overall décor and vibes. It really feels like you are outside - the place is made of wood and covered in an assortment of plants. This was definitely a good call as we are approaching the winter when I plan on venturing out of the apartment only for the bare necessities - this is definitely a good call if you are trying to get your #outdoorson when it is -15 degrees. The tables are communal style for the most part with a few other tables on the sides as well.They have a pretty extensive list of cocktails which I thoroughly enjoyed. I would definitely come here just to experience the bar scene. For food, we started with an order of the mussels - these were awesome and possibly the best I've ever had. I'm typically used to the classic white wine sauce which is amazing, but pretty standard. This was similar, but also incorporated some spice via peppers into the mix. Here's a tip: they bring out a bunch of bread in the beginning to start the meal. #brian and I are #dieting after the calorically intensive holiday season, so we were pretty starved by the time we got there and devoured it. You should cherish it and use it with the mussels instead - we got another thing of bread but I mean us home girls gotta watch out dem carbs - beach season isn't as far away as you think.The rest of the food wasn't particularly memorable unfortunately. We had to get the schnitzel, and also got a duck pasta dish. I have had a ton of short rib recently so we opted to not order it but someone next to me ordered it and man oh man did it look good.

We had the flatbread as a starter. This was definitely a great choice. As for entrees, my friend got the seabass and I got the wiener schnitzel.

The schnitzel itself tasted rather bland and the only thing that gave it any character was the copious amounts of sauce they put on it.My girlfriend ordered the poached eggs, which we thought would be more like eggs benny minus the bread. Why would you ever not include the bread? Also, the chef was either having a bad day with the pot or they need to learn how to poach a damn egg. It was transparent, so we sent it back for a re-do. A simple 2 or 3 minutes under a roaster would have sufficed, but they insisted on redoing the dish; fine. Came back with the same issue, just covered with sauce to try and hide the see-through health hazard. Ugh. The only good part were the potatoes.The dish made 0 sense, it was like a gross soupy mess.

Lucky for me, I stayed over at a friend's place literally 2 blocks away from Edi for a girls weekend, and were able to nab a last minute rez for brunch. The only way to describe the place is...whimsical, lots of foliage and dark wood. Absolutely amazing. The food, however, was just average and the brunch menu was a bit limited. Couple of us had the Weiner Schnitzel sandwich, while was as good as many have described. The only gripe was the bread, which was too thick and overpowering.

5.0,8/5/2015,"Hands down the best experience we had in NYC.Brought my boyfriend to New York for a Knife Fight (the cooking competition show on Esquire) themed foodie weekend. When we saw chef Frauneder from Edi and the Wolf crowned champion of the most recent season, I added a reservation almost as an afterthought. It turned out to be the best meal and all around experience we had. We has an early meal around 5:30 pm on a Friday. The place was just getting opened up, we were the first ones there. (More people came in as we were there) We were given singular service and even got to chat with the chef a few times and he recommended we actually move our seats to something more romantic. Our drinks (a classic Old Fashioned and a Franz Fizz off the cocktail menu) were made perfectly. The meal was delayed a bit because the staff was doing their tasting (which they did front of house and was lead by the chef - if you are into the preparation of food or cooking at all, it is incredibly interesting and not to be missed - for us it was worth it) but our server and the chef both came over to check in on us and make sure we were okay. We had the Weiner Schnitzel (with veal) and the small Squid Linguini (made with squid ink pasta) and both were out of this world. Schnitzel isn't the most complicated of dishes but it was done perfectly and the side pairings were exquisite. The tastes combined with the linguini (squid ink in the pasta, pickled red peppers, a poached egg and crispy garlic) along with a very light and fresh garnish were like nothing I have ever experienced and would recommend to anyone. I can't speak to what the restaurant is like when it's a busy night, but for us it could not have been a better meal or experience.

I've experienced better.""We wanted to try this out after watching Edi win Knife Fight on the Esquire channel. It was m husband's 40th birthday and we went out with one other couple for dinner.Pros: Appetizers. If nothing else, come here for appetizers and a few cocktails and dessert, and you're golden. Had we done this, it would have been a 4 star review FOR SURE. The ribs were melt in your mouth, and the cheese plate was very good. Dessert was good (not the best I've had, but not the worst), and while I was just hoping for a candle in my husband's cheesecake, the entire restaurant wound up singing happy birthday to him.Cons: Mains. I'm fine with paying a lot for OUTSTANDING food, even when the portions are relatively small. These portions are relatively small and pricey and just ok. Nothing outstanding or special or memorable. My steak was kinda chewy and I wanted to ask for salt. The corn puree that came with it was DELICIOUS, but there was barely a teaspoon of it. I almost asked where it was on my plate, because it was buried underneath a huge ""bowl"" of chimichuri. The french fries were damn good, and I'd come here again just for those with the bacon aioli - buckets of the bacon aioli. My husband did enjoy his schnitzel, however.Another HUGE con was pacing. We were barely done enjoying our apps when our waiter (whose personality was a little blah, and never even gave us his name) came and said ""oh there was a mistake in the kitchen.""

3.0,4/9/2015,"I ventured to Avenue C to go to Edi & The Wolf on Easter Sunday for brunch with some friends. The food tasted really good, and the brunch drinks were good as well. We had a reservation, and didn't have to wait for a table. My main issue really is with the prices and the portion size. I'm a pretty small person, so I don't eat a lot in general. That being said, the portions here for brunch are paltry and come with no sides at all. I ordered the small side salad ($5) and the strudel ($9). The food was very good as far as taste goes. The side salad was the right size, but the $9 strudel...a 2"" by 2"" piece with four or five berries on the side. When I said I don't eat much...it does require a little more than some lettuce and a miniscule piece of strudel to make me not hungry. This is the only place I've ever eaten at where I had to go to another brunch somewhere else afterwards because I was still hungry but refused to pay $8 for fries or some other side that probably would have been small enough to still require me to go someplace else.Overall, an okay experience.

3.0,3/2/2015,"Edi & the Wolf has been on my short list for special occasions for quite some time. I'm out of the dating world these days, but this spot's metaphorical Tinder game was strong enough for a solid swipe right.* Through word of mouth, press, this very website, I had envisioned an intimate date spot in a homey setting. What I got instead was a kinda-sorta kitschy, urban gardener's garage playing what could only be described as Baby Boomer music - cheesy classic rock and disco and such. Edi & the Wolf's IRL ambiance threw me, for sure. She's by no means unattractive, just perhaps a bit more laid-back than I was led to believe. Heading into an Austrian/German meal, I also anticipated being well-fed. Well, not so much there either. There are still praise-worthy things to say about this Alphabet City favorite, but my expectation of the whole affair was something different, to say the least.Let's start with the highs. The Flatbread appetizer (candied onion, pickled mushroom, mozzarella) was very good - cracker-thin, salty, and gooey in all the right places. Not to mention, the $2 speck addition was a more-than-reasonable upcharge when we're talkin' meat toppings. My Braised Short Ribs entree (pearl onions, sunchokes, trumpet mushroom, carrot) was tasty, too - tender and flavorful, and the sunchokes were a nice potato substitute. The bourbon-based Fall of Franz cocktail was an easy winner - I ordered two of 'em. While the music may have been casual and/or off-putting, the shabby chic decor and wood-planked ceilings with LED movie-theater lights were well done.As for the lows? The Crispy Wild Octopus (confit potato, romesco, grapefruit) was a small, single-tentacle serving smothered in the smoky, almost ketchup-like condiment. I rarely say this about my eight-legged friends, but skip it. That tasty short rib I just talked about? Also, too small a dish. I heard some other table's server expound passionately about his favorite menu picks, the kind of guidance I feel I needed after adjusting myself to the actuality of our aforementioned ambiance. Our server, while nice and accommodating, gave us little more than a ""What would you like?""I can't fault an establishment for not living up to my preconceived notion of some place I'd never been before. But had I known ahead of time, perhaps I would've saved it for more of a pre-game dinner with friends kind of night. If we're still on modern courtship terms, a Grouper, if you will?* With the right expectations and occasion, Edi & the Wolf can still be a satisfactory spot with quality cuisine, even if it failed to make my heart a-flutter, or my stomach a-fuller.*Kids, am I doing this right?**What a time capsule review this should be.

The food is ok, though for the prices I expected something more memorable (I had the squid pasta - ended up with maybe six little calamari pieces in the bowl, sauce was basic). Decent, albeit very marked up, wines on the list.But the service is what has brought this down to 2 stars. The woman who took us to our table was curt. We sat there for nearly 15 minutes before someone came to greet us and take our drink orders (for the record, the restaurant at this point was about 2/3 full, so not slammed). Our server was very much elsewhere the entire meal, both physically and mentally. He seemed bored. Gave the most perfunctory answer when my friend asked a question about the menu. Never once came to refill our glasses of $60 a bottle Riesling. We couldn't get his attention for the check. In fact, the only time he started to act like he cared about our table was when we already had the check and where filling out the tip line.

5.0,2/8/2015,"Great place. Cozy and rustic- it definitely feels like you booked a ticket to Austria to hang out in someone's cabin to eat + drink delicious food and cocktails. The spot can be kinda hard to find, once youre on Ave C just look for an overgrown, foliage covered entrance and you're there. You walk in and the place is dimly lit but enough that you can appreciate what your food and everyone looks like. The inside looks like a treehouse/cabin with old Austrian memorabilia spread across the walls.  This is a great space to come with your friends or bring a date. Towards the back the bar was constructed as the central focus with foliage surrounding it. Really great set up. I have to say I am a self admitted Germanophile and this place lived up to expectations. It had all the staples Ive come to learn for German and Austrian cuisine and the staff speaks German as well. Suffice to say I was happy. My friend and I wanted a light dinner so we ordered to share the pork schnitzel, the pickled vegetables, the chocolate tart (I dont think they are offering right now) and each a glass of wine (I had the Endrizzi 2011 and my friend the Grüner Veltliner, KEG). Although we wanted a light dinner we ended up leaving comfortably full. The waiter was attentive and knowledgable about all the food and wines, he helped us pick something that we would like. They start you off with their bread and butter + olive oil. WOW.  That is some tasty butter/olive oil they have. Salty, creamy, and depth of flavor. I just wanted to know who their butter supplier is. It IS that good.  The schnitzel is HUGE! (We opted for Pork but they also offer Veal.) I was happy we were sharing that. Not greasy at all. The lingonberry jam was the right amount of sweet. The potato salad and cucumber salad added a great balance to this dish. The pickled veggies were so tasty- good amount of acid. It was presented on a slate board. Really nice touch. The wines were delicious. And the tart was all chocolate and moist. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone- especially for a date.",4,0,1,Nicole E.,"Miami, FL",188,137,185

2.0,1/23/2015,"There was a private party so we were led to the back area which was cozy but awkward. It was hard to have a decently indecent convo w my girlfriends without everyone being able to listen in. Thought a little music would be a good buffer from the deafening silence. Both my friend's and my wine were way too cold for a red. Red wine shouldn't be served at the same temperature as a white. The cheese platter was set on our table without any explanation of what the 6 cheeses were. Questions of whether we were done with our dishes (when we clearly weren't) were too frequent.As for the food, the spatzle was good and something I'd order agn. The schnitzel is far too expensive for what it is- essentially a thin, fried pork cutlet.

3.0,1/9/2015,"""There's no sign. Just lots of...foliage.""That was the text my date sent me when he moved our date venue from another German spot to this quaint little restaurant for a more ""quiet place to talk"". (That's code for we're going to make up, get back together, and head back to his place to celebrate.)After walking up the plank of foliage that was described to me quite accurately, I opened the doors to a very rustic space. The individual tables around the walls were already occupied, so it was just the two of us at the end of a long communal table. It was empty for a Sunday night, but since this was my big, romantic ""getting back together"" dinner, the relative calm of the place was welcome.I started with The Third Man cocktail which was tasty; fruity, sweet, with a slight bitter finish. I would tell you what was in it, but the ingredient list read like an alchemy recipe. I remember apple and maybe vodka? It was prepared meticulously with real citrus rinds muddled with the other ingredients. The care that went into the drink was well worth the price tag. I had three of them. Although, I left buzzed by the end of the evening, I was no where near drunk, so the spirits were rather light in that glass.We started the evening browsing the menu as my date caressed my hand over candlelight. The waitress came through to try to take our order, but I needed extra  time before I could choose. I was expecting hearty German fair, and even though there is a schnitzel and some spatzle, the rest of the menu read rather...American. Free range chicken, braised short ribs, trout. I debated between the large portion of the goat cheese ravioli, or the small portion paired with another item. None of the apps caught my fancy. Back and forth: The ravioli and the spatzle? The spatzle and the trout? The weiner schnitzle and the 1/2 doz oysters? My date ordered the chicken for himself. What finally got me was the price points. These dishes were a tad on the pricey side for the small portions I saw coming out of the kitchen. Knowing my date was picking up the check and he didn't bother with an app, I decided to go with the small portion of the goat cheese ravioli and save some room for dessert. It took a while for our food to come out on a night that wasn't all that busy, but we were happy conversing about our great romance. As the time passed and we ordered another round of drinks, our lovely conversation took a sour note and before I knew it, I was crying, my date softly trying to wipe away stray tears. (You didn't know this review was going to get all dramatic, did you?) Of course, before we could resolve our conflict, our food comes right out, and we're both forced to pull our lips into strained, polite smiles for the waitress who has no idea what's going on since we were on the verge of making out when she brought our drinks and now on the verge of collapse as she's setting our plates down. She offered another round of drinks, but we were not even halfway through our second round. She quickly took off to give us back our uncomfortably tense privacy.We both tried to tuck into the food as we patched up our discontent. My appetite, which was really looking forward to my ravioli, suddenly dissipated, and I was glad when he excused himself to take a business call. I cut into one of the 5 pieces of ravioli which was in a light ricotta and topped with fresh corn. It was so good and I quickly devoured my plate, ready for dessert.The date came back, we made up, he finished his food. We got another round of drinks since the dessert menu didn't appeal to me. When we got our drinks, we were told they were getting ready to close for the night. It was past 10, but since the place was nearly empty, I understood. There were a couple of eaters coming in for a very late night bite as we settled up, and I give them points for allowing them to come in to eat. Turning away business on a slow night is never smart, in my opinion. So, kudos on that. I end this review with a lesson on etiquette, seizing the day, and ordering whatever the heck you want . My ""date"" was once again my ""boyfriend"" when we left Edi & the Wolf. I happily celebrated our coupledom back at his apt. The NEXT night as I'm breaking up w/ him after he asks why he can't keep seeing me & all the women he's been dating since our breakup at the same time, I realized I should've ordered every damn plate on that menu that I wanted to taste because WHY NOT? Had I known his take on life is to HAVE EVERYTHING YOU WANT ALL AT THE SAME TIME, hell, I would've gone ham on that menu! The ravioli AND the spatzle AND the schnitzle AND oysters AND the trout AND a side of brussel sprouts. The man paying sees nothing wrong in having it all, so I should've, too. And so should YOU!The VERY Bitter End.

The restaurant is beautifully decorated with artful touches throughout, all contributing to a treehouse/woodsy/jungle vibe that is really cool and also romantic. Great ambiance that is perfect for a date!The food was tasty as well. To start off, we had some tasty bread with an olive oil/herb/cheese mixture that was unique and really good! We had the squid linguine and the weiner schitnzel (comes made with your choice of either pork or veal, and we went with veal which is more traditional). I wasn't all that hungry so ordered the appetizer portion of the linguine which came in a pretty size-able portion still and was enough for me! The noodles were al dente and covered with creamy uni butter and a poached egg that I mixed in. Yum! The schnitzel was tasty as well, not too greasy even though it's fried, and with some tasty lingonberry sauce, cucumbers, and potatoes on the side. Not a big portion of meat though, so not the best choice if you're very hungry!Worth a visit if you're up for the long walk from the subway, and don't forget to check out the cool jungle-themed bathroom as well =).",5,0,0,Vivian L.,"San Francisco, CA",153,330,43

2.0,8/11/2014,"We had high hopes for this restaurant and though the service was very good the food and the ambience were not.  The interior space does have a lot of quirky charm but the seating itself leaves something to be desired. Our seating options were: perched on the edge of a long communal table inside or a high-top in the back patio.  We chose the latter but found the patio distinctly un-charming. Too cramped, too much concrete. We followed some yelpers' recommendations and ordered the pickled vegetables, schnitzel and spaetzle. The spaetzel was pretty good.  Nowhere near as good as the spaetzle served at The Marrow in the West Village but still creamy and tasty.  The pickled vegetables were so lightly pickled, they barely tasted sour at all. The cabbage slaw was bland beyond belief. Then the pork schnitzel was essentially all breading.  It was SO thin that you could barely taste the pork, and you felt like every bite was a mouthful of breading. Much better schnitzel can be had at other restaurants. This combined with the generally small portion sizes that others have commented on, convince me that there is some serious cost-cutting going on here. In short, the meals we had were not worth the price. This seems to be another over-hyped, over-charging hipster restaurant.",6,0,0,Leonard F.,"Queens, NY",17,195,0
4.0,8/3/2014,"I was über excited about going to this restaurant on a Saturday night. I had read several reviews stating that the food was excellent....but that the portions were a different story. Here's the scoop....""To Start"" (Appetizers) (5/5 - fair price for a hearty serving)Pickled Vegetables - I was hesitant to order this because I figured all pickled things tasted the same. Definitely not. The taste and consistency of the pickled items was intriguing, and held unexpected (but certainly welcomed) surprises. Included were carrots, peppers, cucumbers, etc.Liptauer & Pumpkin Seed - If there is one appetizer you are going to order, make sure it is this one. By far my favorite of the two I ordered. The two sauces used to spread on the toasted bread were incredible. If looking at the dish was watching #foodporn, then eating was #foodsex, and tasting it was #foodorgasm. One of the spreads was orange, and the other was green. If I remember correctly, the latter was pumpkin based. I cannot figure out what the former was though. Just order it, and thank me later. ""Sea"" (Entree) (4/5 - great food, tiny portion)Squid Linguine - It's been almost 24 hours since I ate there, and my tiny heart still skips a beat when I think of this dish...while also feeling sad when I think of the portion size. The linguine was cooked to perfection, ""al dente"", and the seasoning was phenomenal. So why the ""4"" stars? Simple. There were, at most, 4 pieces of squid in the entire dish. Not to mention that the pasta was a less-than-generous helping. There was a poached egg in there, but I feel that for $22, the seafood protein should be the star. I ordered the entree serving at $22, but there is an appetizer option at $14. I can't imagine how small that would be though!Ambiance/ServiceI love the decor there, and the lighting makes it feel incredibly romantic. When you sit in the back of the house, it elevates your dining experience to a level that many other restaurants strive for. The waitress was helpful, understanding, and diligent.Bottom Line: The food there is magnificent. HOWEVER, if you're truly hungry I would do one of the following: Eat something before arriving at the restaurant, so you're not starving afterwards.Ordering many plates worth of food because there is simply not enough in one. Consider going somewhere else.",4,0,0,Carlos G.,"Long Island, NY",12,140,3

5.0,7/10/2014,"This is a way cool place to eat in Alphabet City.  The Gruner Veltliner was bone dry and perfectly chilled, great for drinking during the World Cup semi-final.  So popular they ran out and I couldn't order a second glass.  They serve terrific dark bread with a salty spread made of garlic, mayo and olive oil.I ordered the pickled vegetables and got a board with perfectly pickled yellow squash, cukes, white onion and red peppers.  Tasty!  Having recently tasted the sad picklings at Jacob's Pickles on the UWS, I can tell you the pickles here are so far superior to those, they are not even in the same league.For my main course I had spatzle.  Usually this dish plays a side role but here it's a main course.  And rightly so. The hand-made noodle nuggets are dressed in a terrific cream & dill sauce. The portion size is just right. This dish is satisfying and not heavy (but it's not light either). Service was super friendly and totally efficient.   A lot of people like the rustic (rickety) decor and communal tables here but I don't.  In my opinion, there's East Village, there's funky, and there's way too funky, and the decor here is way, way too funky, and it gets worse as you head to the back.  But frankly, if you focus on what's on your plate and not the surroundings, you'll do fine, very well indeed.",2,2,0,Jeff J.,"Chicago, IL",124,352,145

3.0,6/29/2014,"I really debated with myself over the stars here - three or four? So just know that.We walked by here a few times in our 10-day stay on the LES. Finally decided to check it out our last Friday night. Went early-ish (7pm) because we were heading to the Nuyorican later. Hubby and the teens and I got right in and sat at the long community table in the middle (do they call them that in NY? or just a table? LOL). Service was friendly...and although the beer menu was somewhat limited, the one dark beer selection (Krosovice Dark) they had was delicious.Ordered some sides for starters - cauliflower and pommes frites, as well as the liptauer and pumpkin seed spread. The cauliflower was absolutely delicious. Pommes frites were cooked just right, with a nice selection of two dips.We then had the chicken, short ribs, octopus and spätzle. Truly, all were delicious. Loved the fiddleheads that came with the chicken. Teen girl gobbled every bite of the spätzle. The huge conundrum here was the octopus. When I ordered, our server let me know that the dish came as an appetizer portion. Now, here's the problem....I took that to mean that I could order it as an appetizer portion. I said ""oh no - I want as much as possible,"" meaning I wanted the entree portion. So, when the dish came, and there were literally three small pieces of octopus wedged between 4 slices of potato, I was mad. When I tasted it, I was even more angry....because it was f'ing delicious. The four of us then debated the entire evening....as three of us apparently were on the misunderstanding side of the waiter, and one of us told us that he clearly understood that the waiter was telling us it was an appetizer portion. And now, with more space and time, it makes sense because I'll bet that many diners get angry when they see the portion come....so the waiter was basically warning me. So I shall now turn my anger to the chef and/or house management: get the octopus off of the dinner side of the menu and place it where it should be - as a starter. OR change the portion size and the price so that we can all enjoy it as a meal. No one will blink at $30 for it, if you're charging $25 for the trout and the short ribs, etc. I know I'm not the first to complain about this, so go to the typesetter, shuffle your menu, print up new ones, and get going.

And either is fine, but you kind of have to pick one and commit to doing it well, I think. I had the Kurobuta pork belly with creamy Peas, ramp gazpacho and malted cipollini, which was tasty but a small portion. My boyfriend and I also shared the octopus, which is great but listed as an entree though it's a tiny portion (the server advised us to order it as an app). Little details like that are important -- don't list something as en entree when it's that small. Put it on the app section of the menu where it clearly belongs.

3.0,4/29/2014,"The Good:The food is consistently delicious.  There are some great desserts. The white fish entree is always good.  The wine choices are typically fantastic and not at all over priced. The scene started out truly downtown-they had a super cool staff and a relaxed cool attitude, that made it my favorite place for a year or so.The Bad: Edi's turned into the most popular place on the block.  Downtown cool gets discovered and pretty quickly turns into something like a destination.  Think fashionistas pushing food around their plates and loudly complaining, euro trash that are eating almost as frequently as they are ignoring or yelling at the staff, out of towners bragging about being there  ( a woman sat next to me and literally described herself as the 'creme de la creme' at least 5 times through the course of the evening) and a staff that seems overwhelmed.  The last time I was there we waited over an hour for our entrees.   The big communal table in the middle of the restaurant is basically like eating with - not near but *with* -your table matesThe Special:The decor at Edi & The Wolf is like something you would find in Bangkok. It's a bit wacked out, a bit inspired and pretty cool.  There are lots of details and it's great to take them all in.The Conclusion:Edi's was great.  Now it's popular.  It might still be great but you have to wade through acres of people seeking downtown cool without actually realizing they are kind of killing it.

There were two choices for every course, so the girlfriend and I went with one of everything. The problem? These were the absolute smallest portions of food I've ever seen. Ever. It was shocking that the restaurant didn't feel awkward serving them. The oysters appetizer was one oyster. The butternut squash soup was served in a shot glass sized cup. The gnocchi dish had five.. yes, FIVE gnocchi. My ramen was literally smaller and less fresh tasting than the packaged version. The veal, our main course, was the only passable dish, but was unfortunately the size of a tapa at any normal restaurant.

4.0,2/2/2014,"Being Austrian, loving my national cuisine, I had to try this restaurant for originality. I had passed by in May already and loved the interior, I had to check it out in December when the snow and the cold made for a perfect atmosphere to visit this lovely rustic place. The decoration looks more like a film set, lots of wood, dried leaf-arrangements, with every piece very thoughtfully placed. The bar in the back is also nice, good to hang around at whilst waiting to be seated.The nice waiter finally sat us down, with the table being very small for three girls, but we managed somehow. For dinner, we all chose Wiener (Viennese) Schnitzel - breaded veal cutlet - and Grüner Veltliner, a typical white wine from Lower Austria, to drink. The Schnitzel was lovely - and with 21 US-$ around the price you would pay in Germany in Euro - the Grüner very easy to drink.All in all, a nice place, different from the many restaurants around, quite cosy, but difficult to actually get a table as reservations are not taken.

1.0,12/9/2013,"My girlfriend and I have been wanting to eat here for a while, but due to the restaurant's poor management and staff's incompetence, have been unable to do so.  Now for the story...A few weeks ago, I checked Edi & the Wolf's website to see if they took reservations.  According to their website (ediandthewolf.com/reserv…), they only take reservations for parties of 6 of more.  Upon arriving at the restaurant later that night, the hostess asked if we had a reservation, at which point I mentioned that their website said they only took reservations for large parties.  The hostess wasn't aware of that rule, but offered us a seat at the bar.  Since we wanted to have somewhat of a romantic evening, we declined and left, knowing that we had to make a reservation in the future.This past Saturday, I called the restaurant to make a reservation for that night.  I was told that there were no available tables in the main room, so I made a reservation for a table in their heated back garden.  When we got to the restaurant, there was no hostess to greet us and we waited awkwardly in the front of the restaurant.  After around 5 minutes, my girlfriend went to find a hostess so we could be seated.  The hostess said there was no more room in the back garden and offered us a seat at the bar.  When my girlfriend reiterated that we had a reservation for the back garden, the hostess offered only the rude explanation of ""well sometimes plans change.""We are both disgusted by our treatment by the staff of this restaurant, will not be returning, and will not recommend this restaurant to any of our friends or family.  It's disappointing because the menu looks absolutely delicious and the restaurant has a great vibe, but we refuse to patronize a restaurant that doesn't have a clear reservation policy and doesn't honor reservations on a Saturday night.  Shame on you, Edi & the Wolf.",10,1,1,Steven S.,"New York, NY",0,3,0

5.0,11/18/2013,"Went to dinner with my fiance and a friend for a tasting menu. It was a dim lit restaurant without any real signage on the outside of it to note that it's Edi & the Wolf but peeking inside the doors confirmed it was the right place. The decor is very rustic and imaginative (esp the men's bathroom if you venture in there). The place does get quite crowded on a Friday night. I got there at 7:30 and didn't realize how crowded it got around me until 8:30 or so. Reservations are definitely in order if you want to catch a good seat here.The service was fantastic. We had a very attentive waitress that was checking up on us, asking how the courses were, if we were OK, and refilling our water. Considering how many people were packed into the establishment, I was very impressed with the wait staff. The chef also came out on occasion to get our feedback and present some of the dishes to us. I didn't have a single bad thing to say aside from not finishing all my food due to stomach capacity.I'll try to recall all the dishes through the pictures taken:- Pork belly slider on a sweet potato bun- small bowls of the fries w house made ketchup/baconnaise, Brussels sprouts, and spicy collard greens- seared scallop, squid ink pasta, and uni foam- gnocchi and poached egg on a sweet potato puree- coconut ice cream with candied ginger, some sort of snow, and a yuzu sauce- apple strudel, candied cranberries, and a scoop of ice cream (can't remember the flavor to save my life)I thoroughly enjoyed everything served to me on Friday night but the stand outs were the pork belly slider, squid ink pasta, and the coconut ice cream/yuzu. Particularly that dessert, like it seriously gave me a holy shit moment with the course. I'm a sucker for yuzu but even with that aside the ice cream was killer. I'm not sure how often this dish is on the menu but try to get it because it's probably the best dessert I've had in a restaurant period!",1,0,1,Sean F.,"Essex, MD",10,11,0

Dimly-lit, a lot of wood, plants, trees, all integrated with the tables, walls, etc. -- it's almost as if this is where Frodo and Samwise would ball out on their birthday. The Pickled Vegetables weren't as exciting as I was hoping. The Flat Bread was darn good, but there wasn't anything Austrian about it (from my understanding, the place is Austrian or at the very least, German). The Tile Fish was really tender, but $25 was steep (and the tamarind barbecue sauce reminded me too much of Indian food (yes, I know Indian food often uses tamarind, but still)). I only had beer, which was limited to the region. They had a pretty extensive, indigenous wine list, as well.

5.0,8/20/2013,"What a gem in the middle of Alphabet City. The best time to enjoy this restaurant is when it is warm enough for them to open their front windows to the street, where they also have a beautiful garden and array of hanging plants. Inside the restaurant is just as beautiful, with cozy furniture and a rustic but elegant bar in the back of the room. I came here for a birthday party and the waiter was incredibly accommodating to a group of ten girls. He then continued to offer menu suggestions. I was very put-off by his recommendation of the risotto and scallops--the dish is too often found on menus and is too often underwhelming--but when he said it was his favorite dish on the menu, I figured I would give it a try. I am so happy I did because it was fantastic. The risotto was cooked with squid ink, giving it its dark color and offering an additional creaminess. And the scallops were truly perfectly cooked--not always an easy feat. The risotto and scallops dish alone sealed my commitment to giving the restaurant five stars, but, again, I'd like to give a nod to the fantastic service, too.",1,0,0,Mary Cecilia M.,"Manhattan, NY",31,75,4

I had the poached egg with the pork belly and potatoes and kimchee and it was so decadent and wonderful. There were so many great options to choose from and by the looks of all the empty plates, it seemed like everyone really enjoyed their meal.

2.0,6/3/2013,"The food could only be described as incredible.  The service was some of the worst I've ever had in Manhattan.The first problem here is an unclear reservation policy.  Online research will suggest to a first-time visitor that reservations are accepted only for parties of 6 or more.  We were surprised, therefore, as a party of 2, to arrive at the door only to be asked if we had a reservation.  Several such parties were indeed seated soon thereafter, perhaps indicating a slight miscommunication.We were instructed to dine at the bar.  The space we were actually given was the back wall across from the bar: a dim, cramped corner.  This probably explains why we waited 20 minutes for drink orders and 30 minutes for a check (after busing), despite waiting only 5-10 mins each for starters and entrees.We were waited on by no less than four (4) people at various times, but were repeatedly asked the same questions (indicating no communication amongst staff).  We felt generally ignored the entire evening.  It's a shame.  I wanted to like this restaurant after so many strolls past the enticing-looking decor and reading rave food reviews.  I won't go back.Good Wiener Schnitzel and fantastic risotto.",4,0,0,Sam D.,"Glen Rock, NJ",69,3,0

4.0,5/18/2013,"We had a fun dinner here, but my expectations were probably too high. 3 stars seems low... so we'll call this a faithful 4 stars.Despite my fascination with Austrian food, the menu for this venture between two Viennese chefs (Eduard and Wolfgang! Get it?) does not at all restrict itself to the region. Our dinner actually ended up too far south (squid ink risotto, lamb ragu pappardelle) and too far west (moules frites... separately). We waltzed in without reservations just before 7pm on a Thursday, but the restaurant was mostly empty. (By 8pm the main room was full, but still no one waiting. They have a back garden that I didn't get a peek at.) That evening, they had pulled up the whole front window like a garage door. This pseudo-al-fresco may be annoying to most, but it's kind of great hearing people yelling and cars zooming down the awesomely-named Loisaida Ave.The food, the food... It was fine but not nearly as nuanced as I'd hoped. Seems they're still moving away from their winter menu, so maybe the kinks haven't quite been worked out?Mussels ($15) - Decent because mussels are always good, but nothing too amazing. The bread perched on top was hotter than the mussels, which was disappointing. The tomato-based sauce was a little bland. Belgian fries ($8) - What happened here? The fries were limp/broken, and kind of lukewarm. The two dipping sauces (slightly spicy curry, bacon mayo) were fun, but again, sort of clumsy. The curry dip was too aggressively sweet.Lamb pappardelle ($23) - I didn't want to get such a classic dish, but carby goodness is an irresistible promise. First off, the texture of the pappardelle was PERFECT. Each noodle had perfect tenderness with perfect bite, plus a delightfully coarse surface. I'm not a fan of al dente, but this is exactly as I've always dreamed for non-mushy pasta. Unfortunately, the ragu itself was just okay. Quite salty, and too bold for the use of fresh pasta. Black risotto ($23) - Too bad the best dish was the one I only sampled a bit of! But what little I had was amazing. Just the right amount of caviar for saltiness, plus a good dose of that lovely tomalley taste (I know, gross, sorry, shellfish guts are just delicious and I regret every moment I feel that way). Did they pour lobster goo into the risotto? Who knows? The risotto was topped with seared scallops, which I didn't try, but the whole plate just looked completely lovely.Of course, the real draw of Edi & the Wolf is the decor. My hopes for a LOTR-esque ""primeval forest,"" as Tom K. describes, were not fulfilled. BUT the top hat lamp is fun and the rustic setting is straight out of your Kinfolk dreams (though in reality, you will snag your tights on the chairs). If the decor looks theatrical, that's because it was actually done by a set designer. I do wish this set designer had coordinated with a lighting designer for late-spring evenings, as the front of the room was lit naturally but the back half was plunged into darkness as the evening progressed.I can see this space being a lot cooler in the winter: snowing outside through the beautiful front window, cozy and candlelit inside. Yes, identifying a snowy evening is my plan for when I return. I think the food would be better suited to the weather then.",6,5,4,Ju L.,"Osaka, Japan",960,922,1265

We didn't even need our whole party to be seated which was nice. Service and food came relatively quickly. The people were nice when they gave us a veal weiner schnitzel instead of pork. They let us keep the plate and then gave us a free plate. Good service!The second time I went the service was pretty bad. The waitress was extremely nice, but really flaky. Overall service was extremely slow. The dinner turned into about 2+ hours, not expected. We didn't even get water until I asked a busboy to help us out. We ordered the broccoli rabe which is actually batter fried in tempura - NOT what we expected. We asked her if we could send it back and she said ok, but brought out the brussels sprouts and told us it was on her.

Our party sampled every starter and side dish as well as almost all of the entrees. The delivery was flawless and deserving of 4-5 stars. Must haves include the traditional schnitzel, brussel sprouts, pork belly, spaetzle and the short ribs.",0,0,0,Pamela R.,"Southport, CT",0,3,0

4.0,4/14/2013,"One of the nicest surprises I've had in a while in the city. I was looking for a special place with good food and atmosphere. Somewhere eclectic and energetic and substantive without being twee or beset upon by hoards of people. Edi & The Wolf did not disappoint on any measure. Had no problem getting a table (with a 10 minute bar wait- hardly a draconian sentence) at 8pm on a Friday. I think the Avenue C location insulates the place from too much speculative traffic- this is a very good thing. The restaurant was full of people and energy and life, but no line at the door. The decor is warm and eccentric in a teutonic way. The beer and drinks are excellent, and the Austrian comfort food is just that. The Germanic near-disdain I felt from the bartender and waitstaff was actually welcome- no reflexive smiling or overattentiveness, just prompt, efficient, but unrushed service. Personally, that's the way I prefer at a restaurant. I'm a fan and will return.",1,1,1,Martin G.,"New York, NY",20,18,0
4.0,4/10/2013,"Edi & The Wolf literally lures you in as you pass it by. The atmosphere, from the outside in (and I stole this from Ava R.) is part sexy, part eery, and part garbage. And by garbage it is literally - part garbage. Small details like hooks, lamps, and decorative pieces are made from old scraps of objects or materials most likely found in a garbage dump. But this only adds to the eeriness and sexiness of the restaurant and bar.As far as food goes, we only got dessert. The apple crumble was absurdly buttery and delicious. The deconstructed s'mores cake was pretty sweet and chocolaty, but without many other layers of flavors.",0,0,0,Liz B.,"NY, NY",130,588,129

2.0,3/31/2013,"We went with a group of six total. We were seated at a nice table but the restaurant quickly filled up to an uncomfortable degree after that. It got really loud and it was actually difficult to move around, even to just get out the door when we were done.One of our friends doesn't drink, so she nicely asked the waiter (slash manager maybe?) if they could make her a non-alcoholic cocktail. I've gone to plenty of other places with her where they've quickly and kindly accommodated her reasonable request. All it takes is some juice or soda and a little bit of creativity. This guy looked at her like she had just asked if she could eat off the floor or something. He sneered, ""We don't have anything"" and then took everyone else's drink order. Over the course of the night, he continued to act twitchy and weird, although the food service never seemed to lag.The food itself was okay. I had the spaetzle and agree with the reviewer who said it was too salty. It was a one-note, overpowering dish. I tried someone else's schnitzel, which was fine, but I've had better. Go to Blaue Gans in Tribeca instead. This place was loud, crowded, and with such mediocre service and food, I'll get my Austrian fix elsewhere.",2,0,0,Caitlin F.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,14,0

We shared the mussels which were delicately cooked in a very velvety broth of paprika, fennel and hefeweisen. yum! I had the squid ink risotto and he had the goat cheese ravioli. I loved my dish! They somehow managed to pack sweetness, spice and velvety into one dish. sweetness and velvety taste are easy to manage with squid ink (for those of you who love squid ink as much as I do and order it often), but spice... not so easy. no idea what they put in it, but it was awesome! The baby octopus on top were also perfectly cooked! The goat cheese ravioli was delicious, a little salty for my taste, but good... and while the drinks were nothing to write home about, the house wine was divine! Again very delicate and smoky. yum!

As a resident of Alphabet City, I really need to prioritize visiting places in the hood. Anyway, I walked in with the bf around 10 on a Thursday night and it was jam packed. There was a large party clearing out, but we were happy to eat at the bar; otherwise, we were going to get stuck at the long communal table, and that just wasn't what I was in the mood for. It's a really cool place - the ambiance is perfect for a date or someone you like. Liquor menu includes three cocktails, some wine, and large beers. I went for my typical elderflower based drink which was delicious. Since I wasn't very hungry, I just ordered the pork belly off the small plates, along with some brussels sprouts. Um, can I say best brussels sprouts ever? No seriously. The best. If you don't like brussels sprouts, you will like these.

Could have eaten about five more on tastiness alone. My entree was the spaetzle, while my date was having the weinersnitzel. The spaetzle was... okay. It was creamy, with brussels sprouts and arugula, but way too salty. I love spaetzel, but the salt issue was enough to distract me and make me unhappy. After trying for quite some time to alert the waitstaff (props to that guy for running the whole floor AND the bar) they brought me a new entree, the weinersnitzel, which was balanced much better: thin breaded pork, german potato salad, dilled cucumbers, and lingonberry sauce.

5.0,1/9/2013,"I stepped inside Edi & the Wolf and was immediately transported to my happy place. A hidden gem in the East Village/ ABC city (literally, there is no sign out front), that I'm almost tempted NOT to share this review because I don't want it to became even more popular. The vibe is rustic farmhouse. It's complete with all kinds of kitchy details, a wooden planked ceiling, and exposed worn away brick. The large garage door that creates a lovely window onto Avenue C opens in the summer and there is also a garden area in the back. The space itself is small, with one long communal table in the middle and other wooden tables and cozy booths on either side. There's also a small bar area, full of character itself. It's the perfect atmosphere for a cozy January evening. It's far enough East (all the way on Ave C) that it weeds out the B&T and any unwanted douchiness. The crowd feels very local. It also is a bit older and sophisticated than is typical for Alphabet City, a huge plus in my book. Besides the coziness of the vibe, the staff is also so friendly that it makes you just want to hunker down for several hours. My girlie and I were there on a Sunday evening and Shanna our server took excellent care of us from start to finish. I asked Shanna what her favorite dish on the menu is and she said that's a really tough question. Her theory was depending on what you're in the mood for you really can't go wrong with any of the selections, they are ALL that good. She so strongly believes this that she even told me if I didn't like my dinner she'd buy it for me! (clearly from the number of stars that you see I've chosen you know that didn't happen). We shared a lovely bottle of Syrah. The wine list is not long, but there is enough variety for most everyone to find something they like. Also, the Prosecco by the glass it's absolutely lovely. Food wise, we started with the flatbread which was absolutely divine. I mean mouthwatering, food orgasmic, to die for, divine!!! The flatbread, as well as all of the dishes have such a wonderful combination of flavors. My girlie had the Spatzle (and I helped out with several bites as well, it's a large portion) and I had the Pork Schnitzel. Both of which were authentically Austrian and executed perfectly. We also shared the brussel sprouts, which my girlie has stated are her favorite in all of New York! Due to our onset of food coma we were unable to even think about dessert. For the amount and quality of the dishes the prices here are very reasonable. This may be my new favorite Sunday night spot. I can also see myself popping in for a glass of Prosecco in the bar area anytime I'm in the area. My girlie and I will be coming back here to see Shanna and partake in this excellent meal again, and again, and again.Also FYI, as a courtesy of Sandy they are CASH ONLY",12,9,11,Lissa V.,"New York, NY",565,242,4

4.0,1/5/2013,"Take Schnitzel - and CASH with you (Currently CASH ONLY)After scrolling through the reviews I was undecided whether I should have a Schnitzel or the Spätzle. So 2 out of 4 people had the Schnitzel and the other 2 had Spätzle.I had Spätzle because I was a bit afraid that the Schnitzel might be so fatty. I mean fatty in terms of visible oily fat that will collect under your Schnitzel on your plate - Spätzle is heavy, of course. However, the Schnitzel was the lighter choice and would DEFINITELY go for the SCHNITZEL next time. I tastes so fresh and simply delicious. It is not of enormous size as in some places in Europe, I would rather think it is on a smaller side which in my world is good. I'm no giant myself. So if you think you are too small or something for a Schnitzel: don't worry! GO FOR THE SCHNITZEL! :)The Spätzle were good but I would not have them a second time. Someone wrote that there was too much cheese. Honestly, for me there was not enough cheese. I think Spätzle have to be covered with cheese while this dish just tasted a bit of cheese. The brussler sprouts in it fit well and I liked that about the Spätzle. It was written that there where mushrooms but I did not find them (or it was just too dark to see them).As starters we had Speck, pickled vegetables, red snapper tartar (as fluke tartar on the menu) and something with L.... cream cheese that was spiced.Everything was good. The red snapper was like sashimi. The pickled vegetables were 99% Sauerkraut, 0,9% carrots and 0,1% beets. So I was a bit disappointed because I especially liked the beets and carrots and with this ratio I would call the dish rather Sauerkraut. But the Sauerkraut was not pickled for a long time because it was not very sauer / sour, it was more like salad from kraut / Rübe.The wine list is impressive, so take a minute to study it or take an Austrian guy with you who will choose the good ones for you (as I did).If you are German speaking: this is not the place for intimate, secretive talks as many people were speaking German, including the owners, of course.We were seated in the winter garden as the main room was packed. In terms of general atmosphere the main room is preferable but in the winter garden we could easily talk to each other and actually understand each other.. The staff and Wolf took very good care of us. There was a heater and after a moment I got really cozy there.In the aftermath of Sandy the restaurant is without internet, phone and credit card system. That's why they can only accept cash. But right opposite there is a small supermarket with an ATM.",1,0,1,Miranda K. D.,"Zürich, Switzerland",173,245,979

It's a great spot if you're looking to impress a date. I had the fluke tartar, a while fish sliced about a cm thick topped with a hint of hot peppers, herbs, and a small citrus slice similar to a clementine. What I liked most about it was that each bite tasted a bit different depending on what topping was on that particular part of the fluke. Compared to tuna and salmon, fluke is less fatty and slight more chewy but still quite tasty. My favorite dish here is the spatzle. If mac &cheese and gnocchi had a baby, it would be spatzle. It's absolutely delicious! The dish is topped with arugula and tiny, delicate, crisy onion stings. The dish is actually quite large and a bit heavy so it's great to share.

I really liked the pork wiener schnitzel, too.  It was excellently prepared- it was slightly crisp on the battered-outside and very juicy and tender on the inside.  Its accompaniments (savory and sweet) were very good, too, but the potato salad was just a tad too runny for my taste.  The spätzle was another wonderful surprise... speckled with mushrooms, fava beans and Brussels sprouts.  Plus, if you are not careful, a string of melted cheese will follow your fork all the way to your mouth with every savory bite.  The beers are so well-described, even an old dog like me can learn new tricks.  I cannot tell you how many times I've had Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier and I have never quite thought about its combination of flavors in the way Edi's menu described them.  On my trip, however, I went with a draft Stiegl.  The only less than perfect thing for me was the mountain-cheese stuffed ravioli with little morsels and schmear of fall vegetables.  I would skip that in the future.  It was not, in my view, on par with the excellence of the other dishes we sampled.The atmosphere here is cozy, whimsical and charming.  Our waitress provided just the right level of attentiveness.  We came early and were able to avoid the long communal table because were were larger than a party of 2.  This was a wonderful experience and I will be back!",3,4,0,Jason N.,"New York, NY",307,671,1117

The whole meal definitely satisfied my ravenous appetite. And we just had to leave room for some cappuccino and dessert. If you really want to indulge your guilty sweet tooth, get the lime parfait. Don't even know how they made something so refreshing, but I couldn't stop licking my lips. Growl... I'll be back again.",0,0,0,Maria L.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",335,305,46

4.0,8/5/2012,"I went to Edi & the Wolf with a group of 7 people and it was really fun! Definitely make a reservation if you're coming with a group though! We were seated in the back ""garden"" area which looked like a creepy/cool greenhouse. It was much quieter back there though and a great spot for a larger group. The front of the restaurant was a little small, and I'm not always a fan of communal tables but the energy and atmosphere were good. As it got later in the evening, the front section of the restaurant seemed to be a really fun place to hang out and enjoy some drinks.      The food that I was able to try was wonderful! I wish I could have tried more of the smaller plates, but I  certainly didn't leave feeling hungry. My favorite dish there was the spatzle. It had such a great flavor and the portion size was generous. One serving is plenty for about four people to share. For my entree I got the Schlutzkrapfen (goat cheese ravioli) which was excellent. I thought the presentation was a little plain, but the flavors made up for it. I sampled my boyfriend's linguini with the mussels and clams, which was pretty good, but I'm definitely glad I got the ravioli instead. My friends at the table had great things to say about the pork belly and schnitzel, but I didn't get to taste them for myself.      Overall, the food was very rich, flavorful, and unique.

4.0,8/2/2012,"Had dinner with a friend on a weeknight here after walking by for weeks looking at the interesting decor wondering what exactly went on here. To preface everything, the food and drink here are a bit pricey. We split one appetizer and 2 mains and got a bottle of wine (on the cheaper end) to the tune of roughly $80 each pre-tip. The appetizer was their flatbread which was ...amazing. The organic chicken was good, but nothing to write home about. The goat cheese ravioli was superb as well. The ambience was great, their decoration is a bit intense and brought the words ""Hans and Gretel"" to mind. Would be a great place for a date as well. The price didn't turn me off but it might turn others off but overall definitely recommended if you find yourself on the burgeoning scene that is Avenue C.",1,0,1,Saad M.,"Manhattan, NY",58,235,0
4.0,8/2/2012,"This may be an Austrian restaurant but my first thought was of ""Peter and the Wolf"". You know, the orchestral work by Sergei Prokofiev very popular amongst the under 12 set as an introduction to the workings of instruments, classical music and all that's not jazz.And with my other foot grounded in pop culture, I was hungry like the wolf.But Edi and the Wolf is Austrian ,with ""Edi"" and ""Wolf"" the nicknames of Eduard and Wolfgang, the same executive chef team behind the midtown Austrian spot Seasonal.Avenue C is most certainly not Midtown so by definition, the vibe will be different. Rustic, cavernous and somewhat primeval forest mystical best describe my initial impressions of the spot. Mainly communal wooden tables make up the interior and on a Friday night we were lucky to get in.Yes, if I wanted to I could easily hear my neighbors' conversations but the energy level was contagious, as was the effects of the beer.Ok, you probably should have wine here instead as the wine menu is lengthy and impressive. But it was a beer kind of night and so I had 5 choices on tap to choose from or 5 bottled offerings. The Radeberger Pilsner on tap was perfect and went very well with the appetizer of pork belly.Unlike the night's second serving of pork belly across the street and chronologically later, the immediate Edi and the Wolf pork belly was a modern take on classic swine. Thin slices of peaches, mustard seeds and pumpkin seed oil surrounded an almost maki-esque pork belly 'roll' that as presented was almost too well formed to eat.Aesthetics aside, I dove in and enjoyed every bite. About four to be exact.Up next was the wiener schnitzel and here I will shock the reader: what was most surprising about this dish was just how tasty the cucumber salad was! Yes, it is cucumber salad that I turn to first as mixing the accompanying ligonberry with the salad with the potato salad resulted in a creation that should be marketed as po-cuke-berry salad. (I'll work on that later)As for the schnitzel, it was lightly breaded, crisp and not at all greasy. Well executed and well eaten.Service was responsive and given the crowd, that's a compliment. You'll pay $21 for the wiener schnitzel and $11 for pork belly. Desserts are available but none were needed as we continued on to the second stop of the austro-german spontaneous food and drink crawl, directly across the street.",5,3,4,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",337,820,47

So I thought dinner would be excellent. I was sadly mistaken. I ordered the Pork Belly and they were tough and salty and the accompaniments were bland. Then had the flatbread with the Speck and Horseradish which was quite delicious--lots of flavor and fresh. Then had the Skate, it was again very salty but besides the salt had no other flavors.

2.0,6/19/2012,We went to Edi & the Wolf on a rainy weekday. We were a party of 14 or so. My experience of the food is that it was OK. The flatbread me and a friend shared was really great. It came out warm and delicious although small it packed together great flavors and made it the highlight of the evening. A few of ordered the same beer the Weihenstephan Hefeweizen. Instead they served us Radeberger Pilsners. We told the waitress and she apologized and brought the correct beer. I ordered the Wiener Schnitzel. The potato salad side and lingonberry jam was quite good. The actual Scnitzel wasn't fried as much as I wouldve liked instead of a nice golden fry it was pretty pale and not very crispy.When it came time to pay the bill comes out and gratuity is not included. So now everyone is trying to figure out what they owe (something I hate when going out in large groups). I wish they would've included the gratuity to make everyones job a bit easier. Instead after a few minutes we are told to get up and figure it out over by the bar. The bar is also very small and we're about 14 aside from that it  was rude. We spent a good amount of money and shouldn't be hustled out. The food was OK. The flatbread is really great. The service is where they really fell flat. People go out for the experience.

The place is surrounded by thick ropes, and dead flowers and plants (in a good way).  They clearly spent a long time developing the atmosphere to make it feel really rustic and warm.  There are velvet couches, old lamps hanging from the walls, and vases of interesting flowers. It's truly a botanist delight. The food itself was good but not exceptional.  We split the pork belly, spatzle with fried brussel sprouts and mushrooms, and the wiener schnitzel, and both had large beers.  I wasn't crazy about the pork belly-- it sort of just tasted like raw bacon... way too fatty and the texture freaked me out.The spatzle and the wiener schnitzel were OUT of control good. The schnitzel came with cucumber salad, potato salad, and lingonberry jam. All the sides were amazing-- interesting and unique flavors galore. The veal itself was tender, breaded, overall delicious.  The spatzle was by far the best dish-- it was buttery goodness with fried veggies and mushrooms.  It was like nothing I'd ever tasted.This place was so fun.

We were kinda hungry afterwards.Service was also not great and kind of awkward at times. My friend got his cider right away but my orange juice was nowhere to be seen.

4.0,2/28/2012,"Cliff Notes: Sure beats restaurant week for value. Came here for our wedding anniversary dinner and came without reservations early Saturday evening.  We stuck with ""traditional"" dishes like the spatzle and wiener schnitzel with a dark beer to wash it down.  They state the spatzle is a sharing dish.  Most definitely, it is portioned enough for two people (or one super-sized appetite).  The dish was different than a traditional spatzle with more farm-to-table ingredients like some veggies, mushrooms, and herbs.  I thought it was a delicious take on a standard dish.  Same goes for the schintzel (veal), the batter was light and reminded me of a Taiwanese dish with it's delicate yet scrumptious batter and breading.  You could tell there was a measure of care and culinary technique applied to get that texture, and I appreciated it because it oddly reminded me of home cooking despite it not matching a more traditional style.  My wife said she preferred Zum Schnieder's more traditional takes on those dishes since she has nostalgia from her time in Germany as a student.  I liked Edi and the Wolf's style as well since it was more ""light"" despite being also savory and flavorful.  It isn't as ""heavy"" and warming as a home-cooked comfort food would be and I think that Cafe Katjka does that style better.As others have stated, the space is really great.  A bit dark and dreary with a touch of fairy tale fantasy.  Very rustic and very unique at the same time.  The space isn't super tight though I think the communal table might be if you decided to sit there.  Their garden space is great and would be wonderful with some sun but I can see it getting really loud if you have some ""boisterous"" folks in there.  The staff was very nice and tried to make sure that there weren't any reserved folks on our backs for our table.  They initially wanted to seat us in the main dining area but my wife suggested the back garden since we wanted someplace quieter so we could talk quietly.  To be 100% correct, the staff should have offered it to us, but they did their best to be attentive make sure we were comfortable (propane heaters adjusted so I didn't melt or freeze).  We were among the first patrons that night so the dinner rush had just begun by the time we left.  But the staff, though busy was still very attentive to the other customers even as the rush was hitting... good signs to the professionalism of the staff.I'm seriously considering giving this place another star... great food, great service, great atmosphere but I think I need another visit to truly decide.",0,0,0,Albert K.,"Fort Lee, NJ",60,44,8

We were able to sit at the bar on a busy Saturday night - come early if you'd like to sit - this place draws a crowd, and with good reason. The bar tender came out of this same fairy tale, it was as if he had just descended from an Austrian pirate ship - his forearms were the size of my calf muscles! The wine was delicious. It came straight out of a tap. ""Hans and Franz"" is light and easy to drink - just the way I like it! My hesitations with giving this restaurant more stars is the food. Disappointingly small portions for the price. The green salad was the size of my fist. I was not a huge fan of the Wiener Schnitzel either - this is the pork wiener schnitzel (you have a choice of either pork or veal). The fried coating had strangely separated from the meat itself and it was not flavorful enough - it needed gravy, or something. I preferred the accompanying potato salad, cucumber salad, and lingonberry jam. I guess this is a bad sign when you're ordering meat, but they were actually quite good. Subtly flavored with dill.

4.0,2/20/2012,"This place is great!  Tucked amongst a string of new n' trendy places along Avenue C (boy that street has changed so much in the last 5 years), it offers a hip dining experience with good food, a nice 90s - early 2000s soundtrack and no attitude.We were a party of 3 that showed up around 9:30 on a Friday with no reservation, so we waited a bit and had a look around.  The front room is quite overheated and packed with young people, but adorably decked out like some 19th century botanist's bungalow: lots of wood, dried flowers, old knick-knacks and candles everywhere give that retro, ""I might be living in 1890"" feel that so many NYC bars and restaurants are in love with right now.We did not have to wait too long for a table.  We squeezed in and had drinks at the bar and enjoyed some people watching, while the wait staff were great about communicating with us about when our table would be ready.  Eventually, we opted for a table in the much quieter back room which looks and feels a lot like a makeshift semi-outdoor space.  For winter, however, they've put loads of outdoor heaters back there and it's actually quite charming, flanked with metal walls and other decor that looks like it was salvaged from a scrap yard, and it's not nearly as overheated as the front dining room.The food is German and very good.  We shared a gooey warm spatzle that was soooooo yummy, a great small plate that was definitely enough appetizer for 3 people. For my entree I had some kind of orzo and mackerel combination that had some flavors and spices that I definitely haven't tasted in any other restaurant.  The tastes seemed definitely authentic, foreign and like something I would have in Germany!  One of our party also ordered the wiener schnitzel, and noticed that it was pleasantly light and not overly fried or greasy at all.This place serves decent wine and beer but I'm not sure if it's a full bar.  Anyway, the service was very prompt and pleasant, the food was excellent and the ambience is very mellow and eclectic, like the kind of place you'd find in Williamsburg.  Altogether a very nice dining experience and, unlike some other East Village establishments (I'm looking at you, Saxon & Parole), worth the money.  I'll be back!",0,0,0,elise h.,"New York, NY",52,243,6
5.0,2/5/2012,"What a welcoming and cozy gem of a find!  When I think of German food, fireworks  typically don't fly, and I certainly wouldn't ever think of using the word ""delicious"" to describe it.  I've been so wrong, and it took this hidden, antiqued farmhouse restaurant to change my perception.  Of course, it doesn't hurt that my friend who works at the UN with plenty of Germans (and who has traveled the world seeking out good schnitzel), highly recommended this place.  The space was so cozy - the perfect spot for a cold winter's afternoon brunch.  Comfortable seats, not crowded, a killer deal for coffee, juice or cider, a bread basket, and an entree ($14!).  Don't expect to order anything favorable to a diet, they don't even have skim milk for the coffee!  The pancakes and the schnitzel burger were absolutely delicious.  I can hardly wait until the next time I get to go.The bathroom was pretty unique, as was the lighting and the bar.  I would love to go here for a drink at the bar - adorable.  This is definitely a must visit if you want quality and authentic German food.",0,0,0,Ash C.,"New York, NY",72,301,6
3.0,1/30/2012,"I want to love this place.  I first heard of them at the cassoulet cook-off at Jimmy's 43 and they were by far the best of the bunch.  With this realization I promptly made plans to visit the restaurant for Saturday brunch with three friends.  I arrived early (about noon) and there was plenty of availability so I was sat immediately and served very good coffee and water while I waited. The restaurant itself is somewhat rustic, all wood and rope and wrought iron looking lamps, perfectly cozy for a frigid, windy, January day with a hint of a flurry or two in the air. I loved it, perfect place to meet friends, wonderful place for a first date or a 10th anniversary.The boys had the schnitzel sandwich and I had the poached eggs with leeks. The food was prefect, and I am eager to try the place for dinner.  The reason for only 3 stars?  Although service was attentive and efficient at first but it took almost an hour for our three dishes to some out. The restaurant was not a quarter full and we were offered no apology or explanation for this delay.

3.0,1/2/2012,"Edi & the Wolf is what I might picture eating at a casual tavern in a city like Salzburg despite never having visited Austria. You walk in from Avenue C into this seemingly out-of-place woodsy, rustic hut, and it's easy to forget that you're in alphabet city. Ambiance-wise, Edi is unique in an Alps chalet sort of way. The restaurant has wooden 2-tops, 4-tops and a long communal table in the center, and various trinkets line the exposed brick walls, giving it a very warm feel. However, the brunch couldn't match the same warm feeling of the room. First, service was aloof--the restaurant isn't that big but our server kept disappearing on us and we had felt like we were always trying to track her down to get a refill on water or to order additional drinks or food.  The brunch menu itself is a set menu, and $14 will get you a choice of entree, coffee/espresso/machiatto, a glass of juice, and a bread basket.  Price-wise, it seemed to be one of the best bang-for-your-buck brunches in New York. Unfortunately, the strong, rich coffee may have been the most memorable part of the brunch. My schnitzel burger sounded like a sure-fire hit considering this was an Austrian place, but the challah bread was toasted and dry, and the schnitzel was a bit too thin and dry also. Dry and dry didn't work for me, and even the savory cucumber salad couldn't save it. The breadbasket would be great if it all consisted of pain au chocolat and croissants, but for our party of 6 people, 4 of us never got a chance to taste them and instead had some relatively boring bread. On a cold day, the warmth of Edi would definitely attract me for drinks or maybe even to try dinner.

I went to Edi & the Wolf with the bf on a week night - totally on a whim. We were too lazy to cook and wanted to have a nicer casual meal without all the frills. A venture into Alphabet City led us to Edi & the Wolf. First things first, I would like to commend whoever decided to decorate the restaurant. Many kudos to you, now please come decorate my future house. Stepping inside the restaurant immediately transports you to special place. The place screams shabby chic and the mood lighting is to die for. *Ahem gentlemen, please take ladies on dates here* Fortunately, when we got there, there was no wait. Perfect! The tables are kind of cramped so we decided to eat at the bar. Which totally worked out since we befriended the bartender and he gave me an extra glass of wine. Instant best friend status! Now on to the best part: the food. We shared the Pork Belly and the Spatzle. The pork belly was yummy, but nothing extraordinary. However, the spatzle. Yowza, that dish was something else. I seriously could have eaten the whole thing by myself - screw you Brian M., get your own plate of spatzle! If he weren't my bf, claws would've definitely come out. Then I got the SCHLUTZKRAPFEN (yes, I had to copy and paste that from the restaurant's online menu), which is ravioli filled with Austrian mountain cheese. The ravioli was cooked perfectly and sat in a rich butter sauce - which I would easily have sopped up with bread if I wasn't already pigging out on the spatzle. Brian M. got the Wiener Schnitzel which is their specialty dish. Also quite delicious and something I recommend ordering. In an area with so many great restaurants, Edi & the Wolf manages to distance itself from the competition. I will most definitely be coming back for more and sitting at the bar - just in case the bartender's feeling generous again.",1,2,1,Nancy D.,"New York, NY",321,343,75

I would've liked to try the lipptauer cheese, but my friend is lactose intolerant, so no dice.I had the pork Wiener schnitzel for dinner which was delicious. Perfectly fried and very porky (which I like). The cuke and potato salads that accompanied it were nice, as was the lingonberry jam. My friend had the poached eggs, which he seemed to enjoy, but I didn't take a taste.The wine list is pretty expensive, but I had a couple of glasses of a very tasty, dry riesling for $11 each. My friend had a couple of beers, pretty good as well.I think if this place were in my neighborhood, and the food was a little bit cheaper, I'd go all the time.

4.0,11/22/2011,"Came in on Sunday for brunch and was pleasantly surprised to not be greeted with the usual NYC Brunch Scene. Maybe it was because the restaurant is all the way east on C, but there were not many people there (at around noon - prime brunch time) and it was not noisy in the slightest (read: no loud recaps of the night before coming from two tables away). The food was good, certainly for the price.  Along with a bread basket to share my friends and I got the eggs with Gruyere and walnuts (nice and comforting), caramelized pancake bits (sweet but not saccharine), and a ""burger"" which looked less like a burger and more like a German inspired club sandwich (oddly good).  But oddly good is kind of the overall feel in Edi & the Wolf.

3.0,10/19/2011,"My friend and I checked out this place last night. Normally we would never have trekked to alphabet city because we both live and work on the west side, but this place got such great reviews that we thought we'd give it a try. The food was definitely very good. We had the spatzle, the wiener schnitzel, the pork belly and the cheese. I would say that we could have definitely done without the pork belly, which wasn't too exciting. We felt extremely stuffed to the point of discomfort. For the food and atmosphere, I would give this place 4 stars. However, we really felt that the prices did not match the location. The cheapest bottle of wine was around 60 dollars, and they offered a total of three reds by the glass, each $12 dollars. This is quite high for a restaurant in alphabet city. They also charged $25 dollars for the veal wiener schnitzel, and $17 for the spatzle. If you are going to trek all the way out to alphabet city, a good 15 min walk from any subway, you expect to get your money's worth.They also sat us at a 4 person table, with another couple next to us, which was a little awkward.

A couple of my friends and I were starving (starving, I tell you!!!) and, not wanting to join the fest that was Oktobfest at Zum Schneider across the street, we stumbled into E&W. Upon our friendly greeting, we were advised that the kitchen didn't open for another 40 minutes. A collective ""ugh"" was released by my party. We decided to stick around and get some drinks. The interiors are woodsy and gorgeous, just the right balance of atmosphere and kitsch. It is a transporting experience - the rainy, grey weather outside only added to the cozy charm - and certainly gave us enough to chit-chat about while we waited for the kitchen to open up.The prosecco was excellent. Then came the appetizers. We ordered the ribs and an order of spaetzle. Both excellent. The spaetzle had some mushrooms and asparagus in it that were a perfect combination for the rest of the dish. The ribs were subtly seasoned and juicy. We devoured it all.The waitstaff was casual and friendly, and timed the arrival of our entrees perfectly in sync with the conclusion of our appetizers. One took our plates away while another placed our entrees. I loved it, as it so rarely happens so swimmingly in even the nicest restaurants.My ravioli dish was ""to die for"" (and I never say that). Seriously delicious with a hint of lemon/basil that kept things light even while a brown sugar-enhanced sauce bathed the pasta.

I think we had 5 different appatizers for the table to share, and the quantity was definitely more than enough and incredibly tastey.  They have an amazing pizza thing with creme fresh and fried artichokes, and an incredible paprika cheese spread.  Those were my favorites. The main courses were great too.  We had a choice of three and I think everyone really enjoyed theirs.  The desserts were also quite good, and again, they brought out a few different types of cake and we shared as a table.  They was plenty for us all to try each even though we were already stuffed!We hung out there for over 3 hours and never felt rushed, and never waited long for anything.  The quality of the food is superb, so that's worth the trip, and the level of service is probably the best I've ever experienced in a large group. Not many servers are well able to balance keeping everything coming without hovering or seeming stressed.  Ours was perfect. I highly recommend this place, especially for larger groups, just be sure to call ahead and check out their group menues, because I'm sure having a set menu helps.(I marked attire as dressy, because we were, but casual would also be totally appropriate.

4.0,5/31/2011,"Venue: We had a rough idea of where Edi & the Wolf was located on Avenue C but we didn't have the exact street number. When we walked up to this attractive, inviting restaurant (we didn't see any signs) we were happy to realize that we've, indeed, come to the right place. The decor inside was great with a lot of unique, interesting details. The long, communal table was partially occupied and we were seated in one of the ""sofas"", which was fine by us. It was early in the evening and the place was half full. Unfortunately it was extremely hot and they didn't have any fans whatsoever (the big open windows didn't help much)...Food: I had the baby back ribs with honey, beer, mustard and pickles as an appetizer and I thought that it was absolutely amazing. The meat was tender and the flavors blended well. They called it a ""shared plate"" but based on the size it was just barely enough as an appetizer for one person. As a main course I had the veil wiener schnitzel with potato salad, cucumber and lingonberry jam. Again, this was an amazing dish -- but I was left a bit hungry, wanting more. By experience, I know that they would've served you at least three times as much potato salad with the same dish in Germany or the Czech Republic. I had the Apfelstrudel as dessert and it was good, but not spectacular. Overall, I was very happy with the food but not with the portions.Drinks: Good selection of German, Austrian and Czech draft beers, including Stiegl, Gaffel Kölsch, Gösser, Radeberger and more. I don't drink wine but the wine list looked pretty good too.Service: The waiter was very nice and professional, yet down-to-earth. He (obviously) made some good recommendations and was quick to get us drinks when we were about to run out.Value: A bit more expensive than your average East Village restaurant but definitely not outrageous. The food was well worth the price I paid.Verdict: Great looking restaurant, amazing food, nice beer and attentive staff. Not cheap but not expensive. The only downer is that the portions are too small for a hungry guy. They could also do with a few fans on hot days. Overall highly recommended; I would definitely come back here again.",1,0,0,Victor S.,"New York, NY",0,3,0

4.0,5/26/2011,"The talk of a long wait is true, but it's the crowd inside that's surprising; the oddest mix of hipsters and international NYU kids' parents in town for a visit. We hoped for outstanding wines and equally mind-blowing bites to accompany them, but instead we got very drinkable wine and glorified bar food. The pickled vegetables were shaved thin and looked utterly unable to make a dent in our January snow day appetites but actually tasted better than they looked. The Landjager was neither life-altering nor overly reminiscent of Slim Jims, but the baby back ribs should have been left to the many establishments around the city trying to cash in on the Southern comfort food craze. The farmer's cheese is worth mentioning solely because the dish employs pumpkinseed oil, which could be the game changer that bacon is. Its mere presence could make the most mediocre dish ethereal with its fresh, dark green nuttiness.The Schlutzkrapfen might have been one of the best single dishes we've had ever. It was perfection on a plate; well-balanced (ravioli, homemade ricotta, toasted pine nuts, braised chard, roasted delicata squash), unpretentious (dumplings, cheese, nuts, leafy greens, gourd), and, well, nothing short of glorious (perfectly cooked pasta, soft, flavorful cheese melting into rich brown butter sauce spiked with the caramelized drippings from the roasted delicata, the tiniest crunch from pine nuts, and the satisfaction of knowing you'd had something green).A restaurant whose menu offered every item as good as the Schlutzkrapfen couldn't exist and if it did, would have you under the table crying uncle.

Edi & the Wolf makes one of the best I ever had. I tried both the veal (traditional) and the pork version. Both are incredibly tasty, have a perfect crunchy crust. Even the traditional potato and cucumber salads on the side are so perfect in texture and taste, I don't think I would easily  find something comparable in Austria.On my second visit I had the chicken which was just as great, especially the gravy tied the dish together really nicely.I would have wished for a broader Austrian beer selection, but the wine list made up for that featuring almost exclusively Austrian wines.The only minor letdown was the bread. It's not horrible and by American standards actually not that bad, but it doesn't at all compare to what we would typically get at home at even the cheapest restaurants. Especially when ordering the spread (which is very good indeed) it is hard to get excited combined with the relatively poor bread quality. On the second visit the bread was better, as they offered dark bread as well, but it was still not great.The ambient is relaxed with a lot of fun details to discover in the decor.

The schnitzel burger was made with perfectly grilled toast and an absolutely lovely coleslaw. The schnitzel was great! Crispy and full of flavor. The home fries were yummy and sprinkled with parmesean cheese and bacon bits. I really liked their cucumber salad. It was doused in some kind of light sour-cream based sauce that was really ""bright"" and helped set off the more savory tastes of the burger and the fries.

3.0,4/22/2011,"It was a beautiful spring Sunday afternoon in NYC, the kind where if you were in the sun, it was warm, and if you walked into the stretched shadow of a nearby building, it was chilly.  My friend and I found our way to Edi and The Wolf in East Village for brunch.It was about one o'clock or one-thirty in the afternoon.  We had walked quite a few blocks in that brisk New Yorker pace that New Yorkers keep when we walk, and I had worked up an appetite.  Edi and The Wolf was nearly packed but lucky for us there was still available seating, right next to the front of the restaurant which opened up to the outside.  This restaurant is beautifully decorated right down to the bathroom with a kind of rustic chic theme.  If only the sun had shone through, our seating would have been perfect.  It was actually a bit cold and we had to keep our jackets on, but be that as it may, having fresh air during brunch was something I had sorely missed during these past few months of cold weather. Opening up the brunch menu, it did not take me long to decide on the Toasted Tartine Belegtes Brot, with black forest ham, cornichon, and baby greens.  Toasted tartine belegtes brot basically means an ""open faced"" piece of toasted bread with toppings on it.  But I'll admit that what caught my attention was simply the black forest ham, and not the fancy name of the dish.  I also ordered a mimosa - I wish Edi and The Wolf served bloody marys.Customers streamed in while we waited for our food.  A family of German-speaking patrons walked in and sat down, which in my mind at the time attested to the authenticity of the food in the establishment.  But in hindsight I wondered if this group of German speakers was afflicted with the same predicament I would similarly be afflicted with if I was in the Midwest and I found a P.F. Chang's.  I took the opportunity to snap a picture of my photogenic friend with the last of a roll of black and white film in my Holga, with her giving me the ""I'm not posing for a picture"" camera pose, producing a beautifully whimsical picture.Soon enough, my toasted tartine arrived at the table.  Four pieces of the bread with toppings were served on a flat rectangular plate, along with a bit of a spread to be applied.  The black forest ham and cornichon made for a tasty combination, but to be truthful, it was also not particularly memorable either.  It did not seem like they did anything interesting with the ingredients other than putting them on top of one another.  What was memorable for me was actually the spread.  It was salty and heavy with what hinted of radish or wasabi.  I could not get enough of it.  But in the end, I cannot see myself giving this restaurant more than three stars just because I really liked a spread for toast that they make.",5,1,2,Radford T.,"Queens, NY",612,452,159
5.0,4/22/2011,"MARONE A MI!! WHAT A MEAL!! After talking about making a reservation at this local Austrian joint for weeks, a friend of mine finally pulled the trigger and reserved us a table for my birthday.  Although I have been known to talk about trying new places and never following thru, I am elated that I got up to this gem in a semi-timely fashion.First off, the setup in this place is different.  There is a huge communal table, (reminded me of the scene in Braveheart where all the nobles are breaking bread and the body falls from the rafters) and then several surrounding tables along the walls.  Although our reservation was for six (believe that is the minimum at this place which I did find a little booji) the table was really for five.  We made due and to be honest it was a nice change to have everyone close together -- didn't have to scream and everyone was engaged in the conversation.  I won't go into detail but the decor and ambience was great.Now to the food.  We started off  with one of each of the shared plates.  The flatbreads and spatzle were to die for. The g-d-damn of it is that those two still took a backseat to the baby back ribs.  Cooked to perfection; I wanted to go into the kitchen and personally shake the chef's hand.  We also got the cured pork belly but that wasn't really my scene.For the main course we pre-ordered the duck (I believe this needs to be done 24 hours in advance).  According to the waitress (who did a fantastic job) the entire restaurant was jealous of our choice.  And for good reason!  I haven't had an experience involving a duck this good since Julie ""The Cat"" Gaffney stopped Gunner Stahl to win the Junior Olympics!  So tasty and it came with some great sides (potatoes, mushrooms, pears, veggies).  Absolutely delicious!!I can't wait to come back and try out the rest of the menu!  Good job Edi!

5.0,4/15/2011,"Calling a place the ""best"" restaurant in a city is pretty hard to do, but I have no problem saying that my new favorite restaurant in New York is Edi & the Wolf on Avenue C in the East Village.This is a statement that I don't make lightly, and is one made with a few caveats.  For me, restaurant greatness is less about fancy & expensive and more about tasty & tasteful.  Wonderful food made with streamlined, minimal ingredients is more impressive to me than overly fussy, elaborate concoction of fifty ingredients (if you have that many elements in a dish, it BETTER be good).What attracted me to this place was a very positive NEW YORKER review.  I had met one of the owners before, and tried his fancier, uptown Seasonal, a nice Austrian place near The Plaza Hotel.As with the whole vibe of the restaurant, the food at Edi & the Wolf is more casual and playful.   It feels Austrian-ish.   For appetizer and entrée, I had the Spätzle and the Wiener Schnitzel, both of which felt familiar and innovative all at once.  The mushrooms, beans, and asparagus mixed in with the Spätzle was really heavenly, making it feel as light and healthy as this heavy dish can feel.  The cucumber in the Schnitzel dish was a wonderful counterpoint to the meat itself.For dessert, I hesitated on getting the Schokolade Nuss Palatschinken, basically nutella crepe, but was glad the waitress behind the bar vouched for it so strongly.  Again, it was simple, but had really subtle-yet-vibrant flavors and did not feel too rich at all.Austrian wine is gaining greater mainstream awareness here in the U.S., but still not all that easy to come by.  The Edi & the Wolf  wine list provides a great chance to check it out.  I had a white, a rose, and a sparkling, all of which were refined, flavorful, and crisp without being austere.One of the many cool things about this place is that the owners take a real pride in the food and wine's Viennese roots, without rubbing it in your face.  Instead, it makes you want to know (and try) more of the cuisne.The vibe manages to be truly hip, without being too-cool-for-school, mainly because they are so welcoming.  One (maybe odd) correlation that I made while dining there is that when I went to Babbo a few years back, I loved the food, but felt like it was trying too hard to be cool, with loud rock music, etc.  It feels like Edi & the Wolf achieves the vibe that Babbo was trying to achieve.As for the service, be ready for some playful sass from the waiters.  The staff may tease and joke a bit, but in the end they know what they are doing and care about you having a good time as a guest.I currently live in Los Angeles, and the restaurant standard that seems to matter most to my fellow Angelenos is great décor, and the truth is WeHo and Hollywood restaurants really do have great interiors.  The food, however, is often less amazing.  So Edi & the Wolf  scores extra points for having such a well-chosen interior and nice lighting. I'm probably just stereotyping, but the wood, dried flowers, and curls of rope hanging from the ceiling evoked an Austrian pastoral scene perfectly.  The restaurateurs have a strikingly impeccable sense of taste.Does this all sound ""very nice"" but not ""spectacular""?   Maybe it does sound that way, but being hyperbolic about this place feels inappropriate.   Tasteful, elegant culinary creativity like this is by its nature not going to shock-and-awe you or your taste buds.  This type of food encourages you to sit back and appreciate it, then share it with your friends or fellow guests as a wonderful new discovery.  With a couple of days of thinking about my visit, I can say it was solidly one of the best restaurant experiences that I have ever had.No place that I know of in NYC provides such a vivid and tasteful experience, and has prices that allow you to come back over and over so that you too can become one of the many repeat customers.",3,0,0,Mr. Voracity I.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,83,0

5.0,3/24/2011,"Absolutely everything about this place was on point - including the food, which, to me at least, comes from a region (Germany/Austria) whose cuisine can be a bit of a tough sell.  Things went right for our party of 5 from the get-go when we arrived on time and were told we would have to wait for about ten or fifteen minutes.  In many NYC restaurants, this would be the part where you are shunted off to an overcrowded bar and ignored for half an hour.  Instead, the host AND waiter stopped by our party to bring us glasses of wine, apologized for the wait, and pointed out which table was ""ours"".  So, instead of being peeved about waiting past reservation time, we got a chance to experience the restaurant's hospitality. The dishes were universally strong; I had the steak and the pickled vegetables.  The meat was flawlessly cooked and the parsnip puree it was served on was a nice change from the typical mashed potatoes.The wine list leans German/Austrian and isn't terribly inexpensive, though the $56 Blaufrankisch we ordered was quite good.  I suspect a lot of people will need help navigating the somewhat less familiar German and Austrian varietals, but you really should try them out - just ask a waiter for some help.Edi and the Wolf is another strong add to this ever-expanding part of the East Village, and should be one of the neighborhood's biggest hits.  Go before Sifton discovers it and makes it impossible to get in...",3,1,1,Jonas B.,"Brooklyn, NY",257,92,3

4.0,1/31/2011,"I was hesitant to try Edi & the Wolf so soon after dining at Wallse, where I was introduced to the sublime flavors of Austrian cuisine at its finest.  But Edi & the Wolf did not disappoint.  The Good:  I started with the picked vegetables, falling in love with he sauerkraut, then shared a very nice Brussels sprout and mushroom spatzel with a friend, and chose the fluke special as my main course, pan seared, over creamy polenta and more mushrooms.  My husband had the poached eggs, which were also good.  Great beer and wine lists.The Not-So-Good: I had a bite of my friend's wiener schnitzel, a flavor and consistency I hope to never taste again.  And I found the desserts, a coffee cake and chocolate crepe, underwhelming.  Overall, our group of six enjoyed a good meal in this cozy,  Austrian tavern, and I wouldn't hesitate to go back.",0,0,0,Caroline M.,"New York, NY",66,32,1
3.0,1/27/2011,"Schnitzel, Schlutzkrapfen, Spatzle, Weinhenstephan Hefeweizen, Landjager, Linzer Torte...It went on and on; those un-pronounceable names of Austrian plates.I was sitting at Edi & the Wolf, an Austrian restaurant in West Village. This is a cheaper version of upscale Seasonal in midtown. Rough wooden tables, entrance decorated with reeds, dingy light, giant ropes hanging by the bar, innocent little flowers on the table, and display of EGGS in the bathroom work together to make this place feel like a farm or barn experience. But that's not the point of the night. I came to pronounce. First bread came; no need to say a word for this. Relieved. Chopped up chives smelled very strong. There's no inviting sweet or fresh scent of butter or bread. Chive smell became overwhelming gradually up to the point where I didn't want to touch the breads. That strong. Then the first bite; chive smell disappeared. Butter taste was so rich and sweet that somewhat unpleasant smell was forgotten. A tall, thin, pretty, model-like looking server visited out table. OK. Time to open my mouth to order this Austrian beer. ""Weinhen...wienhenste....Um..What is this?"", I pointed at the menu.""Weinhenstephan Hefeweizen!"", the server's tongue was rolling with such a confidence. ""Yeah...that one.."", I was defeated. The beer glass arrived, just looking like that tall server. Very pretty and very fruity. One sip, then another sip, time was approaching to pronounce other name. First small plate was easy; Pickled sardine($13). Did I order that because it was easy to say? It will remain as mystery. Sardine was not aggressively pickled, which I preferred. Fish was very plumpy as well. It went well crunchy apple slices. Candied, sweet walnut worked as a bridge whenever fish became too fishy. One bite of walnut will save you from that fishiness. Deals and oil didn't do too much for me. Next, Spatzle. Spatzle, spatzle. Not bad. The pretty server understood my order, but showed off her original, accent-free pronunciation. Pew. Then, pointless competitive mode kicked in. I asked. ""Isn't this sort of mac-cheese?"" with a proud smile. ""Oh, no, not at all, not at all"" , she responded, with a sympathetic teacher face. I accepted the fact I am not Austrian. Just that. Spatzle($17) turned  out a small twisty noodle dish. Warm white sauce(not too saucy), brusslesprouts, wild mushroom proved that it was a comfort food, perfect in winter. Well seasoned crispy onion rings and soft baby salads played hard to make this dish not too mushy. and it worked. The challenge of the night, Schlutzkrapfen.Jessica tried to locate her tongue on right places to make up that name, but again, we're just not Austrians. ""I love Chinese.."", I was thinking. I couldn't help picturing this NUMBER organized menu of Chinese restaurants in my head. ""Stirred fried string beans is 168....Chef special shrimp with leek was..."" My love for Ollies was never been bigger that this moment. Schlutzkrapfen($17) was a dish that you can really tell that a chef touched on every ingredient. Austrian raviolis filled with mountain cheese (goat cheese, turned out) were made with a thin dough. Better than original ravioli, I concluded. Slices of squash, tiny fried slices of cauliflower was individually prepared. Their tastes stood out and mingled with other friends on the plate. Wild, little tough salads and toasty seeds were nice too. What else is left to be pronounced?Schnitzel($19) is a relatively familiar name. Edi & the wolf offers variety of it, and we went with wiener(pig). It was thin as it is supposed to be. There was a airy gap between the pig and the batter, which I welcomed. That made me think this fried dish wasn't too heavy. Two pieces of pig were on the bed of potato & cucumber salads. I'm not a huge fan of creamed cukes, but this one was light and refreshing. Lingonberry jam was a nice mate for pig, too. Pearls on pig. Schokolade nuss palatschinken($7). Basically it's a chocolate crepe filled with hazelnuts. By this time, we just asked our server with fingers. ""What it this?"" Crepe was paper thin, but looked like a beer belly since it contained so much of crushed nuts in it. Hazelnuts tasted raw, and not ground finely enough.Warm black liquid was bitter dark chocolate. Very nice. But overall, dish felt lost. It didn't know where to go with money in its pocket.  'Daily dessert'($7) was a coffee cake. How simple is that and also it was the best of the night to me. Silky mousse cream of coffee trapped between springy puffs. So simple, but sophisticated and subtle. I spotted a manager who was leaning on the wall and spying on our table, somewhat nervously. He had a good reason for that. It's been only a week since it was open. ""The coffee cake is so good"", I said.""How about other foods?"", he quickly asked.""They were all good"", I nodded.""For New Yorkers"", he bowed.",0,0,0,Jinhwa J.,"Manhattan, NY",14,28,121

4.0,1/6/2011,"First let me say I'm a pretty tough grader and maybe this place deserves the 5 stars some have given it--but in my book the perfect restaurant is very rare.This place is very, very good but not perfect.Let's start with the food.  I had an appetizer of pickled vegetables which is actually very thinly sliced (almost shaved) vegies on a bed of well-rinsed kraut and sauced (or probably marinated) in a sweetish, vinegary dressing, not unlike Thai cucumber salad which is something I love.  I found it quite tasty and a nice, light way to start a meal.  Then I had what I came for--the Wiener Schnitzel.  They will do either veal or pork.  I had veal.  It was nice and competently done; nothing to complain about but nothing really special either. What was special were the two sides that come with it:  a German style potato salad (but lighter than most) and what seemed like a cucumber salad sort of thing in what I think was a sour cream-based sauce/dressing.  Both were yummy and appropriate with schnitzel.  I also had a nice desert of a Bavarian custard topped with orange (tangerine?) slices and house coffee that seemed closer to espresso which was fine with me.Now lets talk about service.  I left wondering if they had mistaken me for the Times food critic.  They were that attentive.  I ordered wine by the glass and after I did so, the host asked if I would try another suggestion.  He gave me samples of both what I had ordered and his suggestion to try--his was better and went very well with the meal.  Same deal with desert--I was offered a taste of a suggested Austrian desert wine with my coffee and custard and it was very good so I let them sell me a full glass.  Heck, you only live once.The decor is unique (barn-like rustic)--and be sure to visit the restroom if only to see the ""sink"" which was apparently made from a very large old pot.When I was there around 6:30 PM on a Thursday, the place was almost empty but by the time I left 3 or 4 more tables were occupied.  In addition, there were a number of people eating, drinking and chatting who seemed like friends of the management.  But at no point would a new arrival have had trouble being seated.",1,0,1,B.

The wine list is extensive with helpful descriptions, and beers are interesting Austrian choices. Definitely a fun place to go for a drink. The food menu doesn't give a ton of options. They have small plates of tapas, ""shared plates"" with larger portions, cheese plates and entrees. All sounded unique and interesting. We decided on 2 of the shared plates - baby back ribs and spaetzle.  Good choice - Baby back ribs  - they were well-cooked, tasty and came with 3 dipping sauces - 4 good sized ribs. Bad choice - Spaetzle - This came in a rich creamy cheese sauce that wasn't mentioned on the menu...I'm not sure what type of cheese, but it had a very strong, almost sour, smell and flavor that I really did not like. The noodles had a good texture, but the sauce ruined it for me. The entrees that we saw others eating looked good, and the service was excellent.

This crew is the very opposite of that--kitchen hums along with efficiency, deploying wonderfully cooked and plated eats with a friendly waitstaff that is laid back and on top of their game. Congratulations for opening smoothly!We had the Wiener Schnitzel, Cured Pork Belly, and the Baby Back Ribs. Amazingly all the dishes were spot on. Now, if you've viewed my profile, you know that I only write a review of places where I've been delighted... and I'm trying not to overly gush about this place... and maybe I just fell in love with the space and the people, who knows? All I know is that things were spot on when we came.The Wiener Schnitzel was served on top of warm potato salad composed of thinly sliced potatoes and light sauce of some kind (didn't taste like mayo, but what do I know?)...and on top of a sweet, slightly sour cucumber salad. The small spot of lingonberry sauce was just enough to compliment each bite of the schnitzel.The Cured Pork Belly was a pleasantly bracing plate being served over the horseradish and onions. The pork belly was fatty, which typically would be a bit much, but the sour from the horseradish and onions gave the whole plate a nice balance.Now to the Baby Back Ribs. The ribs were (baked?) with a most interesting rub. The menu lists honey and beer, but there was more to it than that. Don't think BBQ, but rather seasoning that gives it a distinctly non-American flavor. Add to it the sharp mustard and spicy ketchup(?) that's served along side it and it turns out to be a lively, new way to serve baby back ribs.Just so you're forewarned, don't expect to leave the place stuffed to the gills if you're used to the typical German resto fare. Instead, think quality foods, and great hospitality... oh! before I forget... they have an extensive wine list. They opened a fine bottle of full-bodied red for us that was one of the best we've had in a while.

From the eerie light seeping through cracks in the ceiling to the boot vases scattered about the dining room, Edi and the Wolf takes the ever-popular ""rustic chic"" look and turns up a notch, with dazzling results.

Both were excellent.The food was great, although it was the weakest part of the experience when compared with the fantastic wines and the surreal ambiance. I'd highly recommend the Landjagr (dried sausage) or the veal Wiener Schnitzel, which was expertly-fried with a very tasty side of potato salad. We were disappointed with the Spaetzle (noodle dish with mushrooms), which was drowning in butter.Overall, I'd highly recommend this place for a unique fine-dining experience.

Austrians do comfort food very, very well, which seems to surprise a lot of people (it goes back to the lousy quality of Viennese housing etc etc that led to the rise of cafe culture etc etc blah blah).  Anyway, this place does a fabulous version of your Austrian favorites.  What?  You don't have Austrian favorites?  Well, you should.  Austrians, you see, like butter. And meat products. And fatty things. And bread. Washed down with lots and lots of booze. And coffee (that also is spiked with booze).  And lots of cigarettes (well, that's missing here, obviously).  In other words, to borrow loosely from someone a lot smarter than I am, they excel at a lush, baroque aesthetic culture. In simpler words, they eat and drink well.  And you'll eat and drink very well here.  For an extremely reasonable price.Austrian wines are a surprisingly good value. All of the reds are under $10 a glass, and there are some good and interesting choices amongst them that are a good bit more interesting than your run of the mill pinot.  They've got a decent selection of good beers. Reasonably priced, if not as cheap, alas, as in the mother land.  The schnitzel was amazing. I say this as a person who actually doesn't consume a lot of meat. And even less veal.  The schnitzel was amazing.Yes, I know, maybe it's premature to go throwing around 5* for a place that just opened. But considering how good the food was, how good the service was, how wonderfully cozy the place is, I think they deserve it.---PS, they seem to be doing a lot of private events  (I tried to go again, but, alas, I was not one of the chosen ones).  It might be best to call ahead just to make sure.",8,0,2,H H.,"Brooklyn, NY",30,227,0
