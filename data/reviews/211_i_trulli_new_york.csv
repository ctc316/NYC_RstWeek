5.0,5/1/2019,Love Love love this place! Honestly deserves more stars. Saw it on Facebook and decided to come in  -- didn't disappoint! Loved the meatballs (which are gluten free -- yum) and then had the cavatelli w/ broccoli rabe which wasn't as bitter as I thought it might be. And the lady from the Facebook video is sitting right there making pasta!,0,0,0,Juila K.,"Manhattan, PRINCE, NY",0,2,0
4.0,4/27/2019,"I very much like I Trulli. It has great food, nice atmosphere and good service. There are many dishes that I like. Try the Polpette, or the Octopus, or the Maloredus. No matter what you are eating it will be good. Bring friends, bring family, or sit at the bar. No matter where you are siting you will have a nice time, and be treated nicely. I would like to see the owner Nicola a  more often, the place seems a bit empty without him.",0,0,0,Randall M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,37,0
5.0,4/26/2019,"This is by far the best Italian restaurant I've ever eaten in my entire life! Warm lighting and a cool environment. It may not seem like the most kid friendly place but you'll be greeted by the hostess who grew up in the restaurant that her dad owns all while her grandmother makes pasta there by the bar.  The servers were attentive and helpful. we were served a sun dried tomato bread with ricotta and oil-amazing! We ordered the orecchiette with rabbit ragu and the malloreddus with saffron, sausage and tomato sauce which were both exquisite. And the desserts are to die for. I would move to New York for this restaurant alone. 10/10-absolutely recommend to anyone looking for real authentic Italian food and hospitality.",0,0,0,Thomas D.,"Solomons, MD",82,3,3
4.0,4/20/2019,"Saw this restaurant on a good show and was intrigued. We went last night and had a wonderful dinner. We shared 3 appetizers- amazing beer salad with pistachio and ricotta, meatballs and fried seafood assortment. All were fantastic! I had the orchietta with rabbit ragu which was delicious and hubby had swordfish with canellini- perfectly seasoned. Fresh and clean tasting. Beans had great texture- not mushy.  Desert was a rhubarb cake with pistachio gelato and a pecan tart with caramel gelato. Both delicious but be forewarned- kind of a big portion.  Usually it's the opposite! Why a 4? My orchietta would have been so much better with pepper and cheese- neither of which were offered. Yeah, I know. Get over myself-- but it was a small portion and was $28. It would have been much more enjoyable.",0,0,0,Sharon C.,"Montclair, NJ",111,40,2
2.0,4/17/2019,"Its an old standby and the atmosphere is great. The staff is super attentive and really did their best to make our dinner a pleasant experience. However the kitchen has not kept up with the dining scene in NY. The menu is excellent and has great choices but the preparation of the food was not great. The simple salad was overdressed and not as fresh as I would have expected. We send back the swordfish because it was really overcooked and dry. The skirt steak was slightly over salted and again an overdressed salad. Too bad, hopefully we just picked a bad night for the chef.",1,0,0,Gijs V.,"Manhattan, NY",0,169,0

5.0,3/14/2019,"i Trulli has dim lights, ambient music, and flowing wine - perfect for a date night or hangout with friendsThe restaurant in Flatiron was packed on a random Thursday night. My girlfriend and I got seated next to a roaring fireplace, complete with freshly cut logs. Don't get me wrong, the restaurant evokes more of a bustling trattoria than a library, but there's a certain charm anyway.We shared two pastas (appetizer size), 2 entrees, and 2 desserts. 1. Rabbit Ragu Pasta - amazing and hearty with a texture like gnocchi2. Crab Artichoke and Jalapeño Pasta - even better bite in a rich butter sauce and generous amounts of crab3. Roasted Rabbit - a little light but a good portion4. Scallops - highlight of the night. Cooked to a buttery texture and a rich flavorThe desserts were also great! We got the tiramisu and Nutella calzone.

I dipped it in the meatball sauce for more flavor.Ravioli- Tasty.Malloreddus- The texture was good, but it was a bit salty for me.Cavatelli- Wow, this dish makes other dishes with broccoli rabe look bad.

5.0,11/9/2018,"This place needs more stars, especially on Yelp. If you're looking for authentic Italian food from Puglia - which is the heel region of Italy, you need to make your way here. I trulli has been open for around 25 years, and Mamma Dora is still here (not as often of course) to make fresh pasta like orecchiette and Cavatelli. All pastas are handmade on a daily basis, along with the bread and the panzerotti - that you have to get cause OMG. If you're looking for traditional food from Bari you're in for a treat, just their focaccia Barese is to die for  I definitely recommend their stracciatella, as well as the Polpette, aka their signature meatballs. Flavorful, soft and oh so yummy - and believe me when I say I'm ultra picky when it comes to meatballs. The sauce they come in is perfect as well, sweet and with the right hint of acidity. If you go there for lunch don't skip out on their pastas: try both the orecchiette with rabbit ragù and the Cavatelli with broccoli rabe and crunchy almonds and give the coniglio alla Barese a try, or go for the grilled swordfish. As far as dessert, why not finishing the way you began - with a panzerotto? This time with Nutella! Perfect, especially paired with a nice espresso (or a macchiato if you're like me). I already have reservations for December - but to be honest I might go back even sooner than that  . Nicola tienimi un tavolo!",0,0,1,Sacha D.,"New York, NY",106,103,589

As a pasta maker myself, I'm always happy when pasta is made in house and the orecchiette in a rabbit ragu is by far the best dish I've tried here.

5.0,10/3/2018,"I recently had my birthday party at i Trulli...and it was fabulous.  As a bit of background I had contacted the restaurant as I live in the neighborhood, had been there a few times before (always thought the food was good) and wanted a place that wouldn't be too difficult to get to as I had folks coming in from all over the city as well as NJ. I had read they did private events.Astrid responded to my query right away, gave me a call to ask me what I was envisioning, how many people I was expecting and invited me to come check out the space. At this point, I had talked with a few other restaurant venues and I thought she gave me a very reasonable quote, especially for the amount of food. I also liked the idea of hosting the party at a restaurant that is a neighborhood staple (its been there for 25 years). Initially the event was supposed to be held in the back side garden but sadly it is under construction and wasn't ready on time, so they moved me to the main garden and made sure I was the only party. I had about 40 people, cocktail party style with passed hor d'oeuvres, wine and beer and a very large dinner buffet. Honestly the food options were incredible...and it all tasted delicious and it was very plentiful (they kept on bringing out more. My guests all raved how good the food was and asked if I came here often.  The staff was very generous, allowing us to stay way after our welcome, pouring wine and taking pictures.  Overall, I would definitely recommend i Trulli for future events--and of course dinner too!",0,0,0,Emily L.,"Manhattan, NY",165,14,0

2.0,8/4/2018,"A disappointing experience at what looked like a nice restaurant. Our stracciatella was served with unripened flavorless tomatoes - a crying shame. The orechiette was ok but the rabbit ragu had no flavor and a strange texture. Then the scallops, whilst beautifully tender were served with an indistinguishable lurid red sauce and a piece of unknown vegetable on the plate that was undercooked and grey - the accompanying seasonal vegetables were overlooked and sloppy.

4.0,7/24/2018,"On a perfectly warm Friday afternoon, my first instinct was to hunt down a rooftop for a cold beverage, but that plan was sadly thwarted when I saw lines down the block for nearby roof bars like the Broken Shaker. Instead, my happy hour partner and I decided to hunt down a quaint outdoor table to enjoy ourselves in peace and we strolled right by i Trulli, where the manager was sitting outside himself and let us know that we could take advantage of their happy hour deals al fresco. We were sold! I started with the spritzer and shared a dozen HH oysters at $1/each. They also had shrimp for $2/each (had two rounds of those), and some apps for $5/each. Our panzerotti came at the very end of the session (I think they forgot), but it was piping hot and fresh, like a little fancy pizza Hot Pocket. With two rounds of drinks and lots of bites the check came out to about $70 before tip, which isn't the cheapest around but for the quality and the charming ambiance of a real life restaurant (vs. a sweaty, crowded bar), I think it was totally worth it. Really looking forward to coming back to try a full meal, and check out their cute back garden, too!",9,4,12,Christina P.,"Culver City, CA",4723,2090,4060
3.0,7/21/2018,3.7/5.0. So I can not stop talking about how amazing my meal was as well as everyone else at the tables (yes I stole many a bite from the other plates) and honestly this may have been a five star review based solely off food. However the service. The service. The service. It stated out fine (not amazing) but fine none the less. Then the end of the meal came. And it honestly ruined the entire experience. One of servers just ignored us the entire time. Yes I know I'm not your table. I'm just asking you to grab my server. Don't sassy me queen. Then the deserts came out staggered. About ten minutes after we had FINISHED our deserts the coffee came. And it was cold. I will be back but only for the food.,1,0,1,Cam G.,"Boston, MA",462,93,93

3.0,4/2/2018,"Been here many times before but not in last 2 years however.  Decided to try the Easter dinner. I Trulli is a fine place with excellent authentic fare from Apulia. This could have been an easy 4 start but cheapness on their part limits to 3.  The ""roast lamb"" described in the menu (the special served family style in our case 2) was actually baked in a cheese and egg sauce. It was good but not the expected simply roasted lamb.  And it was cut up in hunks - many of which were mostly 90% bone. Frankly it was stingy.  The crudités excellent, same with perfect fried artichokes, orriechette was nice also a bit blobby and oversauced, but the ""dessert"" was a plate of common Italian cookies.   I don't know why some restaurants think of special holiday dinners as a free for all on the customers wallet by being stingy and cheap.  I've brought many guests and business associates here and always enjoyed it but when they mess with Easter dinner - well is disappointing.  Server was excellent by the way, and the room pretty and inviting.",2,0,1,Pete M.,"New York, NY",234,360,142
5.0,3/9/2018,"The food at iTrulli and Sottosuolo is amazing - best chicken parm in the city, and the pizza is straight out of Italy. The wine list is eclectic and solid. The space is quaint and a a bit of respite from the typically overcrowded, factory-like establishments that have been slowly edging out authentic, original restaurants and bars in NYC for over a decade. The management is top notch, and to add to all of the positives, once in a while they have live music. Live music is integral to the coolness that this city once had before every millennial invaded the island with their facebook apps, iPhones, and vapid cluelessness as to how to interact with other human beings. I appreciate a good live band, and when the owner makes a point to hire musicians that have played with the likes of The Beatles, it's apparent that only a housebound recluse could complain.",0,0,1,Debra H.,"Manhattan, NY",16,12,0

We opted out of the restaurant week menu and went for the full on Taste of Puglia menu and it was so amazing, perfect to get a good taste of the menu.

5.0,12/4/2017,"I've been an occasional visitor to I Trulli over at least two decades, but I hadn't been here in a while. When I ate here tonight, the restaurant had been totally redone. The western half of the space, which always had the pizza oven, had become an upscale pizza place, not connected physically to the restaurant. It even has a separate name which I didn't catch. I like the new space better aesthetically and acoustically. The former L-shaped configuration and warren of rooms seemed sprawling, with tightly packed tables. I tell you this, because it's physically different than the restaurant described in the older reviews. But this isn't about restaurant designs. I do miss some things, like the old side bar where you could get flights of wine and charcuterie. But the current bar is spacious and pretty. In fact, we chose to eat at the bar. The bartender was super attentive. I can't comment on the table service. Whats important, I'm glad to report, is that the kitchen still turns out authentic and delicious Puglian cuisine. Telling, in terms of authenticity, is the fact that when I asked about the lack of tomatoes as an ingredient in the dishes, the maitre'd said ""It's December,"" meaning that in Winter in Puglia, traditionally they cook with seasonably available produce. Tonight we had cold faro salad (made with root vegetables and hard cheese) ravioli, mushrooms and sea bass. Light dinner. Wines, as always, are an education here. Great Aglianico by the glass tonight. I think I've learned more about Italian wines at the bar here than anyplace else. Be forewarned, this isn't for you if your idea of great Italian food is served at Olive Garden. The cuisine, other than the pastas, is not the type of food most Americans would identify as Italian. By the way, I Trulli is the name for the cone-shaped stone houses found in Puglia. The singular for the house is Trullo.",7,0,4,Zachary S.,"Vero Beach, FL",322,373,3440

5.0,8/16/2017,"Went with my husband for Restaurant Week lunch, which was an excellent value. They didn't skimp on the portions or service, and we left stuffed and satisfied. Their style is from Puglia, the ""heel"" of Italy. The pasta was al dente, and the sauces had a great balance of flavors. The pulpo was easily our favorite; I've never had octopus so tender... and such a massive portion, too! My only criticism for the meal is that they could have toned down the cocoa powder on the tiramisu. It made it too dry and bitter for my taste, and I felt it overwhelmed the other flavors/textures. The panna cotta was divine, though, so that will be my go-to dessert next time. Overall, a well-executed meal. Lovely quiet, casual ambiance, perfect for business meals or catching up with friends.

5.0,8/2/2017,"I'm typically a woman who knows what she likes and dislikes. But I Trulli's beet salad, man. It had me questioning my tastes, questioning who I am in a fundamental sense. Am I a person who enjoys beets? Had I always liked beets and just not been aware? I'd never really given them a fair shake. However, on a fated day in the summer of 2017, my date and I went with our server's recommendation for the beet salad. I'd take a bite and think, ""It's good,"" and then with the next bite amend that to: ""...for beet salad."" I think beets are an acquired taste that I am in the process of acquiring. On to the stuff I know I like: cocktails. I ordered the Hemingway Daiquiri - tasty! Refreshing! A nice milky whitish color (this is a plus in my book, for some reason). I also tried my date's Sidecar, which tasted like a Dreamsicle. Dope. The bread: Yo, I'm not one of those sensible folks who forgoes the bread basket to save calories for the main course. I want all the calories. The garlic focaccia with sun-dried tomatoes? Uh, fuck yeah. So buttery and soft. Gimme dat. The whole wheat was also good; I slathered it in the superb house-made(?) butter, as I am an unrepentant glutton.Let's talk pasta. I Trulli's is handmade by someone named Dora. Or handmade by another person, using Dora's recipe? The specifics are unclear, but nonetheless, bless that Dora and her pasta witchcraft. I got the highly recommended Malloreddus dish with saffron, sausage and tomato. Amazing! The taste is magnificent, the texture dreamy. Little pillows of deliciousness. (Great 'mouthfeel', as those in the industry say.) My date's Tonnarelli dish was excellent as well, but we both agreed mine was where it's at.

2.0,4/16/2017,"I've been to this restaurant twice before and this time it appears to be under new management. My experience the first time (last year) was much better. My mother also brought friends here after going to see off Broadway's shows in the area previously and we both agreed were never going back there again. First of all, all they had to offer was a dinner menu at noon which on a Sunday in NY, I find to be outrageous.  The food which the staff kept raving about being the best homemade pasta anywhere was really just ok. I ordered a pasta and sausage dis and ended up getting a ragu type meat sauce with hardly any sausage meat at all. I literally had to search for it. My husband ordered the market fish (striped bass) and it came with the smallest portion of fava beans. They provided no side options of a potatoes, risotto, veggies or even pasta to supplement. Only beans? The wine list was good but they had no drink specials, offered no recommendations for pairing and again for the price, were rather ungenerous with the wine portions. To top it off, we had 4 different wait staff (which I suppose accounts for the expensive meal) however, when we needed them they were no where to be found. They came to take our plates away immediately and never came to check in, never asked us if we needed anything, more drinks or if our food was good. Overall I'm extremely disappointed with the changes in this restaurant and I will be shocked if they survive.

1.0,2/15/2017,To say disappointing is understatement of the year. Went here for Valentine's Day and it is was epically horrible. Literally didn't see food for an hour and fifteen minutes and that was just the antipasti. Our apps came out an hour and forty five minutes into our meal. I literally had my coat on because we were about to walk out (after what I counted was five table around us walking our). We did stay because it was almost like a train wreck you couldn't look away from. To top off the horrible service the food was not good; cold apps and my steak was charred. The dessert was the best thing. They did take one of the prix fixe meals off the tab but honestly should have saved the money and left like so many others and gotten a slice of pizza.

We started with the meatball appetizer, it was amazing and the red sauce that it was swimming in was some of the best I ever had. Maybe a higher tomato paste to tomato ratio? Not sure but the flavors were deep and fab. I also tried the fresh mozzarella with the picked eggplant and the balsamic glaze. Loved it! I wasn't a big fan of the eggplant, but others enjoyed it mucho. Our main course were the short ribs with farro and while this was my least favorite item on the menu, it was very rich and tasty. I had a bite of the chicken: delicious! But my favorite main course was the grilled bass with the sautéed potatoes and mushrooms. It was phenomenal!! Finally we had a dessert composed of an amazingly prepared pannacotta, a mini decadent chocolate cake and fresh fruits. Delicious! We all had an amazing experience. I loved everything!

1.0,12/21/2015,"What a dishonest, horribly-run, disorganized mess of a restaurant. I made an open-table reservation FOR CHRISTMAS EVE weeks in advance. Open table CONFIRMED the reservation. I also spoke to a woman on the phone way back then and she confirmed she also had the instructions written in about requesting the slightest seating accommodation regarding a medical condition (not a wheelchair or anything). The woman assured me that they have several rooms and different seating arrangements and that it was no problem and she would see that we got an appropriate seat. (Again, it was the slightest thing that we asked for, which no other restaurant, no matter how crowded or busy has easily taken care of).TODAY--December 21st, I called again just to mention this again and spoke to Raquida(spelling?). I told her we have an Xmas Eve CONFIRMED reservation, per open table, and she said ""but I don't have your credit card number"". I said ""No one asked--the reservation was simply confirmed, online and with your staff already."" She then told me they were demanding a credit card number from everyone that night, even though they would absolutely not charge until and unless people actually came and ate there. I asked how we were supposed to know about this since it is not part of the open table reservation. She said ""We would have called you the day before."" I said ""What if the unknowing clients didn't even have a credit card?"" She said they don't keep the reservation then. I said, ""So you hold a reservation, confirmed online and on the phone before, make no mention of this sudden Xmas Eve ""policy"" and then could easily destroy someone's holiday dinner by calling them with this last-minute requirement that you don't publicize or mention in prior conversations""? She didn't really know what was in the supposed prix-fixe for that night and kept telling me all different things were included/and not included and kept changing it. ""Includes tip""she said, then I said ""what?"" then she said doesn't, then this/ then not, etc. etc. She confirmed our simple seating request as well.     I decided to call back and asked for the manager, since no one had mentioned collecting credit card numbers and we had a confirmed reservation with no mention of such.I then spoke to Ahmed, who said he was the Manager. He said this was correct about the credit card. I asked the same things--yes, they were going to spring it on unsuspecting customers at the very last minute. Oh, and as far as it not being mentioned in any way on open table, and open table even confirming out reservation, he said ""Oh yes, we will have to update that"". I guess he will update it the last minute, on Xmas Eve, since it's almost there already. And then he contradicted everything the other people had promised about a simple table accommodation. No--there would NOT be the slightest attempt or forethought, even for people with ""CONFIRMED"" (which has little meaning to them) and CREDIT-CARD BACKED reservations. It would just be 'whatever happens when you get here' as far as the seating issue. Oh, and about all the lying from the other staff who answer the phones and misinform people with reservations, including promising ever so slight seating planning but definitely promising it, Ahmed said ""Yeah, I'll have to speak to them."" Alot of good that does at this point! It's not like you can go get another reservation so close to the holiday, and that is precisely why it was all supposedly set and confirmed far in advance. What was the point, since it was nothing but lies and last minute sudden ""requirements"" and the OPEN TABLE RESERVATION CONFIRMATION also has NO meaning, so don't believe restaurants honor those either.Thanks to I Trulli for ruining our Xmas Eve and also preventing us from going elsewhere, which we certainly would have, had we known the management there is so random, dishonest, and unethical towards patrons and waits till the last minute to spring their last minute tricks on you.I see there are plenty of bad reviews of the place, the service and the staff here as well. Hopefully restaurant-goers will all learn what an awful and horribly-run business I Trulli is. I Trulli is ""Trulli horrible"".Wish NO STARS was an option on this site.

The insimino (?) was the special of the day--an octopus and calamari stew with black chickpeas--and it was lovely. Homey tasting with perfectly tender seafood.

And he waved his arm out and said, ""Do you see how busy we are??"" I kid you not. No apology, nothing. Oh and at 7:30, they were already running out of main courses, which they didn't bother to mention until my friend ordered something and the waiter said they ran out.... The food came, and it was ok. Just ok. Nothing to jump up and down about. None of us were overly thrilled with the pasta, fish or beef. I would expect more, considering the prices and solid reviews. The server never once came over and asked how our meal was, if we needed anything etc. Just once someone did swing by and asked if we wanted another bottle of wine. There are so many great choices in the city. It's just my opinion, but after this experience, I  wouldn't waste time and money by going here, ever.",0,0,0,Linda S.,"New York, NY",1,3,0

4.0,7/29/2015,"This is a lovely and charming Italian restaurant with a gorgeous outdoor garden in the back, where we enjoyed our Restaurant Week lunch meal. First we were given water and our glass was always full. Then the waiter brought out a small basket of bread: There were 2 different types. One was foccaccia like with sun-dried tomato, fennel, rosemary and other seasoning. The other was rustic brown bread. It came with nice fluffy and creamy butter.I had the baby calzones for my appetizer. One had cheese and tomato filling, while the other was sausage and broccoli rabe. I think I liked the cheesy one better. There wasn't enough of the filling in the other calzone. For my main course, I chose the ""straw and hay"" pasta dish, Paglia e Fieno, which came with peas, pancetta (lots of it, to my delight) and cream sauce. It was truly delicious! The pasta itself were long strips of golden yellow and green colors and cooked to perfection. The peas were fresh and wonderful, the pancetta was incredibly flavorful with just the right amount of salt, slightly crispy with tons of great seasoning. It tasted amazing. The dish also came with lots of Parmesan cheese. It was very rich and filling. My friend had the Pork Scaloppini which was pork medallions with bread salad of tomatoes, onion and cucumber. The presentation was really nice and I loved that it was so colorful, but I wasn't a huge fan of the pork. It didn't taste all that flavorful to me and was a bit too chewy. The salad was pretty tasty though. Dessert was Torta di Cioccolato, chocolate cake with a scoop of coconut sorbetti. When we were first served dessert, my friend and I felt that the portion size was quite small, but it still satisfied us. The cake, however, was more like a mini brownie with chocolate drizzled on top. The ice cream was in a perfect small ball and there was toffee peanut brittle underneath it. I enjoyed the cake which was chocolate-y, moist and slightly sweet, while the coconut sorbetti was refreshing and light. Really enjoyed the meal, atmosphere and attentive service at i Trulli.",11,10,11,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",783,438,5876

2.0,2/21/2015,"Have you ever met someone really attractive and you get super excited then you speak to them.. And everything goes downhill. This restaurant gave me the same feeling.I had reservations for restaurant week, so our party of 4 was excited to try this place. But it was a big let down.  Environment: 3/4 It was a nice setting, had a visible wood oven right when you walked it. We were seated in the enclosed patio area and it was awful. It's in the middle of winter so there was a draft that would come in and it was so cold. They had a heat lamp but it turned off early in our dinner. I was just happy we didn't coat check. Food: I originally wanted to try this place because the online menu stated that there was duck confit but they switched it with duck sausage. -Panzerotti Duo (Baby calzones filled with tomato and mozzarella, scallion and olive): These are NOT calzones, they were deep fried stuff bread-like. If you look up ""Johnny cakes,"" that is what they were. There was not flavor and just stale and chewy.-Ostriche (Wood-oven roasted oysters with tuscan kale and fonduta):  3 oysters come with this plate. It was ok if you like shells in your oysters. Every single oyster had a big piece of broken shell. I love the feeling like I am going to crack a tooth on every bite.-MezzaLuna (Homemade half moon ravioli filled with chicken, ricotta and salami, tomato basil sauce): This was ok not great. I think there was a sale on salt or something because the chef was quite heavy handed on this dish.-Brasato (Braised beef short rib with rutabaga purée and roasted brussels sprouts): The first bite was pretty good, but as you get a second bite, you realize how dry and fiber like the meat is. I had to drink with every bite to get the food down. -Torta di Cioccolato (Chocolate cake, coconut sorbetti and mocha brittle) I LOVE LOVE desert but man, I couldn't eat this. Words can not describe this. Service: The servers were great! They were the only reason this place didn't get 1 star.TLDR/Summary: Restaurant week is great to try new places.

A taste of the chefs offerings! The meal was so rushed that even after requests to have a pause between meals was ignored. My fiancés plate was always cleared before mine. I find that very rude. As soon as I laid my cutlery the plate was taken and another was served in seconds. There was no time to enjoy.The food was below average. The appetiser was two calzones that were not balanced in flavour. The mozzarella was lovely. The next course we had chosen one of each and the rabbit ragu was amazing, the broccoli and almond was disgusting. For the main meals we also chose one of each and the lamb was divine but very salty.

2.0,9/29/2014,"One of the most disappointing and offensive evenings I've ever had. I'm born, raised and live in NYC, so that's saying something. Allow me to ""set the table"". My wife and I were looking for a Italian restaurant to celebrate our anniversary, and planned to dine with friends who had flown in from out of town. We had plenty of choices, and favorites, but our friends had asked about I Trulli, Garden tables, homemade pastas and a wonderful wine list. What could go wrong?   We arrived on time, greeted by a hostess, and swept past empty tables to the farthest table in the corner of the garden. My wife and I sat facing the wall and rear exit, but stayed calm not wanting to upset the evening. Two of us ordered a special entre, but moments later were told by two jostling waiters that they were out, at 7:30PM. To again be gracious, I went with another choice, though I noticed the no longer available special being served to diners who had arrived after us. When all the meals finally arrived, there was a collective ""meh"" after our first bites; and mine was the entre I was told was not available, but now miraculously appeared. (I ordered a second bottle).   Here's the capper. A friend and very frequent patron had kindly called the owner on our behalf, arranged for a special garden table, and a bottle of champagne to start our evening. A bottle, we found out later he was charged for but that never arrived; and a table that seemed to go to his ""good"" customers, though admittedly a guess on our part because the restaurant was behind us. This was all so wrong, and unnecessary, happening as it did on a special occasion, in a town with a dozen other places that pride themselves on delivering a quality evening for their patrons.  This is the first and last Yelp review I'll ever write, but think the owner should know what's going on at his place on weekends while he's at his beach or country house.

I got the 4 course for $48 and my boyfriend just ordered an entree off the regular menu and we basically shared everything. For app I had the chickpea fritter and goat cheese which was delicious.

I came with an old coworker and we immediately saw the the back garden when we entered the restaurant. We decided to dine in the garden and it was so pretty outside. After reviewing the menu, we decided to do the 4 course restaurant week menu (for $10 more). We both got the mini calzones, the ravioli with pistachio sauce, and short rib. For dessert, I got the tiramisu and my coworker got the chocolate cake. The mini calzones came in two. One is filled with mozzarella tomato and the other with olives and anchovy. I'm not a big fan of olives, but I actually did enjoy both of the calzones. Despite it being fried, it wasn't too heavy or oily. For the pasta dish, I LOVED the ravioli. The pistachio sauce was AWESOME! I could lick the plate! Here is where the bread basket comes in handy to pick up the rest of the sauce. By the pasta course, we were kind of full. When the short rib came, we had hungry eyes, but full stomachs. However, the short rib was so buttery, it was just amazing. The sauce was a bit on the salty side, but it was wonderful when paired with the meat. I don't like to waste food, but we simply couldn't finish the meat. We were pretty darn close though, but we had to save room for dessert. So the tiramisu was ok. It wasn't anything special.

The garden looked nice too but it was much to humid to sit outside. The waiter was fine, between giving us the menus and ordering was about 20 minutes. He also told us the specials right when we were about to order so that was weird. The Sommelier or manager (wasn't sure who) was rude, I asked him a question about some of the wines mainly why they had an entire list of this winery we'd been too in Tuscany. He answered flat and literally acted like he was so busy and couldn't be bothered with my comment or care less. We got our appetizers, the meatballs were good. The frito misto was pretty pathedic. There were like less than eight pieces of tiny chopped calamari and then maybe six slivers of zucchini. My Orchiette with rabbit ragu was good. My husband ordered the Bucatini all' Amatriana and there was literally two pieces of panchetta. It was all tomato so that was sad.We didn't get dessert so I can't comment on that.I think my main issue was the not very friendly staff.

We got seated and had to flag someone down to even order our bottle of wine. I have no idea who our server was suppose to be, because we had to flag someone different down every time we needed something.The only thing I can figure is that the Spanish guy who was serving every other table around us took one look at us and because we are mid-twenties (as opposed to the older business crowd around us) he figured we weren't worth his time.I gave it two stars because the food was good. We had the burrata, carpaccio and stuffed calamari. All really good.

The service here was on point; friendly, efficient, didn't feel rushed, and didn't have that vibe where the server attempts to get you to order more dishes. I really enjoyed the service flow the whole night. The decor made me feel as if I was in a rustic type home.They serve 1/2 bottles of wine--for those who are weak sauce like me. You know the feeling where you are starving and pounce on the bread basket once in it arrives? Any place that serves focaccia with sun dried tomatoes has a MAJOR plus in my book! Nomnomnom!We started off with meatballs. Okay, I thought there would be something special about this dish but I was wrong. It was just a plain meatball dish with some plain marinara sauce. I had the malloreddus, sardinian saffron dumplings with sausage and tomato. It was delicious-- rarely do I enjoy pasta THAT much. There really is a difference in homemade pastas! My date had a meat dish, I cannot recall for the life of me, but that wasn't too shabby either. I was hoping for the dessert options that's on the Yelp page menu, but I suppose it's a bit outdated.

4.0,2/19/2014,"I love this place. I came here once before for a company dinner so I decided to come back for lunch during Restaurant Week. This place introduced me to the best tasting Moscato ever!! It's called moscato d'asti. Love this stuffOkay let's get on with the food:PROS:- Ravioli per Olivia - basically cheese ravioli with green sauce (possibly pesto sauce) this contained some nuts and it was very delicious. The nuts helped deepened the flavor and add texture to the dish. Very filling. [4.5 STARS/ 5 STARS]- Bucatini All'Amatriciana (Thick Spaghetti with Pancetta, Tomato, and Pecorino) - it was my first time having such thick spaghetti. It was thick and fresh. It was also a bit bouncy/chewy - like it was fresh made. Apparently, the pasta are made fresh daily by mother of the family! Just a tad bit salty but nonetheless very good [4 STARS/ 5 STARS]- Moscato [5 STARS/ 5 STARS] - I can probably drink a whole bottle of this stuff!- Service was prompt and wonderful.- I also loved that they served bread in the beginning. I really like the Pan con Tomate. THE OKAY:- Panzeratti Duo (calzones for appetizers) its fried similarly to zeppoles however it has fillings. One of them had cheese and tomatoes and the other one had anchovies and olives. I preferred the cheese and tomato one however I felt like they could have filled it up with more tomatoes so it'd be more flavorful. I'm not wild about the calzone with the olives and anchovies. I typically don't like anything with olives but it was actually edible here and I didn't feel like I had to pick it apart.[3.5 STARS/ 5 STARS]- Tiramisu - It was wonderful however they layered the top with too much cocoa powder. Almost coughed on the powder. It's much better after you scrape off a couple millimeters of the powder. [3.5 STARS/ 5 STARS]CONS:- None really. Place is just that good.- Actually wait there is one. The 2 person seats that are beside the walls are angled a little weirdly and if you were heavy set, I don't think it'd be easy getting in to sit down comfortably.",3,0,1,Teresa C.,"New York, NY",156,471,1940

It was all quite good. The meals were decent, again a bit pricey.We get the bill at the end of the night - and all $200 of the apps were on the bill!! 'On the house""?? Nope, not really.

We arrived on time to an empty restaurant( a bit foreboding) and received an attitude when we told them we had elected to bring our own wine.  We had brought champagne and a Barolo. We were then told that we could only open one of the bottles- I was more than willing to pay multiple corkage fees ($25).  From this point on we received an attitude from the wait staff and felt rushed to turn the table.  The food was ok-3 stars maybe.  The New Years sausage was terrible, tasted like fried spam.  The duo of mozzarella was good as was the spinach gnocchi.  I ordered the filet which was mediocre at best and it seemed like a half a filet.  My gf ordered the lamb which was excellent as were the Brussel sprouts it was paired with. The desserts were a mixed bag-tiramisu was good, the gellato was not.  We also received a hazelnut panzerotti which was good.  We paired dessert to two glasses of sambuca. The total for the meal was about 200 dollars after corkage and a sambuca with dessert.  Neither the food nor the service really justified the premium.  I felt as if it was a restaurant week sort of experience.  I will not be returning to this place.  Scarpetta is around the corner and over all a much better restaurant from a food and service perspective.",0,1,0,Lou L.,"New York, NY",6,44,31

It was killer with the grilled octopus.What great start! Off to course #2, knowing this was going to be a memorable gastronomic marathon!Our table shared several pastas, accompanied by a 2001 Amarone.

3.0,1/22/2013,"Found this place via a Yelp search while we were looking for a reasonable Italian restaurant for New Year's Eve dinner.  While we loved the atmosphere, wine, and service, I was not really wowed by the overall food quality/quantity.New Year's Eve featured a $65 fixed menu, not including alcohol (though they offered a range of reasonably priced wines).  The first course was a traditional Italian sausage and lentil dish, which tasted absolutely delicious (the sausage was made in-house), but, there were only two tiny slivers of sausage.  What was great about the next three courses was the abundance of choice; there were at least 6 first plate options, 6 second plate options, and about 4 dessert options.  Choices galore!  I started with seared tuna with orange salad, followed by rack of lamb.  My friend started with butternut squash-filled ravioli and followed with halibut.  My tuna, for some reason, was flavorless.  The rack of lamb was cooked perfectly (accompanied by brussels sprouts and parsnip puree).  However, it was only 2 ribs.  TWO.  I have to say, whenever and wherever I have ordered rack of lamb, it has been at least 4 ribs.  At least.  This was my biggest disappointment.To finish, I had their tiramisu, which was delicious and tasted freshly prepared.  Oddly, the dessert was the most substantial course - certainly too much for one person.Overall, there are too many restaurants in NYC to say that I would ever return here.  However, if I lived in the neighborhood, I would perhaps give it another try for special occasions.  I'd stick with more traditional Italian dishes, though.",0,0,0,James B.,"Baltimore, MD",149,103,1

We were seated in the back corner of the covered garden area where were was a draft but at least we were sitting close enough to the heating lamps to get a little bit of warmth. They offered a fourth pasta course for an extra $10 which we thought was a nice option.

5.0,10/12/2012,"Came here with my friends and was SO pleasantly surprised by the menu. We sat outside on the patio and enjoyed a lot of delicious wine from the owner's vineyards in Italy. I was also pleased to see the owner Nicola making his way around tables chatting to guests and making them feel welcome.We ordered a bunch of stuff to share, maybe a little too much, but I was so impressed by the home made pastas on the menu, which, Nicola's mom comes in to make by hand daily. Naturally, we had to try those.We started with Panzerotti, little calzones stuffed with tomato and mozarella, and another kind with broccoli rabe. Both were deliciously light, although I loved the tomato and mozarella a little more.We then moved on to the pastas and there were so many to rave about. We started with the Ravioli per Olivia, ricotta filled raviolis with a pistachio sauce.I especially loved the one with burnt flour -- maccheroncini -- thinly rolled pasta about an inch and half long with a nutty roasted taste. Tossed together with a fava been sauce, cherry tomatoes and pepperoncini, this was not only a unique dish, but also, a delicious one.Orevchiette, not usually one of my favorite pastas literally blew my mind. I think it was the texture of the pasta which took this one out of the ball park. The rabbit ragu it was tossed in brought it to a whole new level. I've never experienced pasta like this outside of Italy. Incredible.But that didn't end there. I think my favorite of all was the Malloreddus, Sardinian saffron dumplings (similar to gnocchi but smaller and firmer) with sausage and tomato. I couldn't stop eating this delectable dish and I had already eaten WAY too much.However, there was still Coniglio -- rabbit -- to come. Crispy fried rabbit was so juicy and tender. I'd never had fried rabbit before and found that I thoroughly enjoyed it prepared this way. Together with the garlic spinach and carrot puree, the simplicity of the dish was complex in taste -- something I'm well aware of!After SO much food, and more than a bottle of wine each, my friends and I stumbled happily out of iTrulli with our bellies full and an evening spent with the company of good friends.",5,2,3,Anita L.,"Irvine, CA",1409,4084,3685

Cooked perfectly and tasted traditional, its not to be missed.Speaking of not to be missed, the Baccalà is off the chain. It's not a heavily salted fish that you had for holidays. Its Pan-Roasted Chatham Cod with Tomatoes, Eggplant, Peppers and Basil. Mmmm mm! Cooked so perfectly, the chef is on target with this dish.I finished with the homemade Tiramisu.

We ordered a few appetizers for the table. The Grilled Octopus was perfectly done with just the right amount of bite. The Carpaccio of Beef Tenderloin was moist and delicious; the Miniature Calzones were light fluffy, flakey purses of gooey cheese that burst with flavor and goodness. My first Rabbit experience was tremendous. It's been four days and I can't stop thinking about how good this dish was. The handmade, homemade pasta from Dora was special. The Ragu was deep, earthy and as tender as the best short rib ever.An excellent wine menu, fresh pasta, welcoming staff and great ambiance create a great dining experience.

2.0,1/1/2012,"I will preface this with I have been to I Trulli years ago and found it only OK. But we thought we would try again and for New Year's Eve they had a special menu and we went last night. I have been to Puglia many times for work so appreciate the cuisine and was looking forward to the meal. The room is nice, and we sat in the back garden which was lovely though the heaters were at times too hot (it was a warm night). When requested the heat was turned down kind of grudgingly.  Ended up glad I wore short sleeves under my jacket. First off, the web deal said after 8pm we would have ""sparkling wine"" toast. This was not shown on the menu and we were not offered it so ordered our own. A few glasses later the sparkling wine came with dessert...would have preferred it right away but suppose they are trying to keep the wine orders coming and by the time we had it, was superfluous. The web menu day of was not exactly the menu offered. One app was gone (leaving a blank line on the menu) and some other preps were different. The fish was to have been an olive poached halibut but instead was a wild sea bass some other way that I did not want. Most of what we had seemed pre-cooked, dry and not hot enough.  Apps: My husband ordered the rabbit terrine with pistachios and the nuts were merely sprinkled on top vs cooked with. He did not like it at all and though we rarely do so, sent it back and switched for mache salad. I had the ""wood roasted Oysters"" which I have had at beacon but these were nothing comparable. They did not seem wood roasted at all, in fact I saw the oven on the way out and it was closed up/ not in use. The oysters were merely warm and nothing special at all. 4 tiny ones, with no real flavor. Next came pastas. Husband had gnocchi and I the butternut squash capelletti. Eh..only 4 and the dough was thick, with little filling. Again...not special at all. Main course: Husband had venison, I had porchetta.

I got the octopus cooked in wine, tomatoes and chick peas and the ear-shapped pasta in a rabbit ragu, which were both really good, just not great.  The pasta noodles and ragu sauce just were not all that special. In retrospect, I should have tried some of the other options - squid ink thick spaghetti with octopus - and a bunch of meat dishes that sound amazing as well upon a second read. We got a bunch of chiantis, which were all great and topped it all off with a delicious plum tart and vanilla ice cream dessert.

The food, on the other hand, didn't impress me too much. The fresh ricotta with the bread was absolutely delicious but the caprese ""calzones"" appetizer were more like cheap empanadas. Tasted good, but definitely not worth the price.My boyfriend got the famous orechiette with rabbit ragu, which really did live up to the hype. So hearty and delicious. My gnocchi with broccoli rabe, on the other hand, was almost inedible. In fact, I had maybe 3 bites because the broccoli rabe was SO bitter, I couldn't taste anything else. So disappointing.

3.0,10/10/2011,"My experience here was good, but not great.  I probably walked in with high expectations, especially since this place had been mentioned in ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate"" for their Orechiette w/ Rabbit Ragu.I happened to pass I Trulli on my way to the gym, so I was excited to make it my post-workout dinner treat with my friend.  I know, the irony.  I was expecting to get turned away because we were dressed in work out clothes, but the hostess couldn't have been sweeter.  The customer service was fantastic, and we were seated in the garden area along with other restaurant patrons, many of whom had made reservations (so we didn't feel like we were cast away to some random corner because of our attire).Now onto the food...Burata - Wasn't spectacular.  Burrata should be creamy in texture, but the one I had was kind of in between regular mozzarella and burrata.  Parts of it were creamy, but other parts were too rubbery for me.  The greens it was served on top of was a bit too bitter, and I didn't find that it complemented the burrata very well at all.Pulpo - Pretty good.  I just had a few bites of my friend's, so I don't have much to say about it.Orechiette - I was expecting this to be spectacular, but it fell short.  The flavors were a bit flat for me, almost on the bland side...and I kept thinking about different meats other than rabbit that I would have preferred with this dish.  Thumbs down because there was a rabbit bone in my dish.  The pasta was good, but I don't think I would have recognized that it was handmade if it wasn't pointed out on the menu.Malloreddus - This was tasty, and you'd probably like it if you like sausage.  It has that distinct flavor that you can only get from sausage.The nice thing is that you can order all of the handmade pasta dishes as appetizer portions (half the size)...and the appetizer portion still was able to get me full (since I had gotten the burata to start).Overall, this place serves good food, but when you consider how much you're paying for all the dishes...it makes you think twice about making it your local go-to italian pasta restaurant.  But when you want to make it a nice, romantic, special event dinner...you question it because the food isn't spectacular.  Kind of in that in-between restaurant limbo area.",2,0,1,Jackie K.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",220,138,43

5.0,9/18/2011,"Our first experience at I Trulli can only be described as delightful. The large restaurant is divided into three sections, the main area, the outdoor area, and a more informal bar area. We ate in the formal main dining area next to the large fireplace in the back. This is a beautiful classy place with nicely spaced tables. We came (as I usually do) a bit ahead of the 7:00pm crowd which gave us time to talk with the friendly staff, and look over the rather interesting, mouth watering menu. We started out with the Crudo of Sea Scallops with fennel, and rhubarb, and also the Grilled Octopus with yellow beans, black olives, and new potatoes, both appetizers' absolutely delicious. Then our party of three, lucky me two women and myself continued on to split a homemade pasta dish. The Toasted Flour Pasta, Duck Sausage, Beans, and Spinach were a taster's treat. Toasted Flour comes from a little-known Pugliese tradition when the local nobles allowed the peasants to glean from the fields the remaining wheat harvest, usually done after the fields had been burned clean. The blackened wheat when used in pasta giving off a delicious toasty, nutty flavor. For the entrée we choose two orders of the Wild Stripped Bass with sweet pea ravioli, pea shoots, and cockles. And yes it was good as it sounds on the menu. The Pan Roasted Cod, tomatoes, olives, capers, and broccoli rabe was to my taste good, but I am not big on Cod, broccoli rabe or that many receipts that mix tomatoes with fish. Our waiter had suggested a white wine from Toscana which I was not familiar with. Not hard considering that the wine cellar is loaded with over 450 different wines. The Gavignano wine that he suggested had a nice nose, was dry, with an interesting tropical fruit taste, and was perfect with the meal. The hearty portions of both the pasta dish, and entrees left hardly any room for dessert, but gluttons know no limits. It was on to the Plum Tart, Vanilla Ice Cream, and vin cotto, along with another shared dessert of Chocolate Cake, Espresso Gelato, and Hazelnut Brittle. In sum although not an inexpensive place it certainly should be on your list for that very special occasion with friends, family, or your sweetie. And yes it's in Manhattan on East 27th Street...",1,0,0,Louie D.,"Rego Park, NY",0,23,0

4.0,8/5/2011,"I'm writing my review of Enoteca to Go, which offers breakfast and lunch. I visited with my boyfriend primarily because I had a LivingSocial deal and the menu sounded nice. It was a bit out of the way for us, but since it was a lovely, sunny morning (and the vicious August heat was just beginning to crawl over the city), we decided to give it a shot.Upon entering the restaurant, we realized that we were the only diners there, which never bothers me, since I like the relative quiet environment that comes such a condition. It was cute, cozy, and I was pleased by the warm greeting we received by the two servers who were situated behind the bar. We found a menu at our table and noticed signs on each table that directed us to order directly at the bar. Since we were hungry, we decided to start with a fruit salad to share, then order something more substantial. I ordered the Uova pugliese sandwich, which boasted eggs, pepper, and potato (one of the few vegetarian dishes beyond fruit or pastries, it seemed) and my boyfriend ordered the Erbazzone, which was a swiss chard, egg and cheese pie with grilled mortadella. As we munched on our fruit salad and sipped coffee, we noticed it was taking quite a bit of time for the sandwiches to arrive. This hardly bothered us, since we knew it was close to being disgustingly hot outside and were enjoying the air conditioning. But we did have plans to meet up with a friend shortly, and did not want to be late. One of the servers came up to us shortly to apologize for the wait and indicated that there was some sort of issue with an ingredient in my boyfriend's order. He was told it would be another 20 minutes: or he could order something else. Scanning the menu quickly, he opted for the PBT, which the server said was great, and we happily went back to our conversation. Soon, our food arrived, and I was immediately in awe of his PBT. The PBT, which contained pancetta, burrata, and tomato, was absolutely fantastic. This was one of the best takes on a BLT that I've ever seen executed. My favorite aspect of it was how the burrata, a cheese I'd never had before, and the tomato worked so well together. My Uova pugliese was quite good too, though I should have realized it would be smothered in onions, since it contained peppers and potato (and often onions are a part of that combination), and I detest onions. It would have been nice to have that indicated on the menu. Despite the lengthy wait, we thoroughly enjoyed our food and are still talking about that PBT sandwich. Since it is called Enoteca To Go, I imagine you can get all of this goodness to go as well (duh, me!), so I recommend trying that option if you are in a hurry.",2,0,1,Amanda S.,"Syracuse, NY",4,29,24

We had such high hopes for this place because of the yelp reviews we had seen, but we were thoroughly disappointed. My boyfriend had the grilled octopus with the endives as an appetizer, and it was god awful. I took a bite or two to help him finish it because of how expensive it was, but it tasted like charcoal, no flavor or creativity whatsoever. It was clearly too burnt to be eaten. For his entree, he tried the rabbit ragu after reading the yelp reviews. I had to have a taste to see if everything that was said about this dish was true. My first bite was disgusting, it tasted very gamey, it had a very strong flavor, but not in a good way, and to top it all off the ragu was filled with bones, I counted at least three times when my boyfriend and I had to stop to pick a bone out of our mouths. The taste of most everything we had there was very over powering and over seasoned. What a bad experience. My appetizer and entrees were not bad, but they weren't great. I had the chickpeas with the goat cheese, followed by the dumplings with the sausage in tomato sauce. The service was was fine, not as great as everybody says, and we were not the only ones who had complaints about their food; our neighbor had to return his dish to the kitchen after just one bite because it was ""bristly."" Needless to say, we didn't stay for a second or for dessert (although I could always go for dessert), and we did not even finish our meals.

Then the restaurant next door closed up, and they acquired it and made it into a deceptively large restaurant that has covered outdoor seating in the back. They do have coat check (which is nice), and the outdoor seating is very nice. The only downside (which I experienced) is having a heat lamp behind me...even on a relatively cool night, I was almost sweating through my sweater by the end of the meal.We ended up skipping on appetizers, but the entree was absolutely marvelous. I had the macherroncini, which was a very substantive (but not too heavy) homemade pasta. The highlight was the duck sausage, which was generously heaped in with the pasta. I'm not the biggest sausage person in the world, but duck sausage is pretty fantastic - you get a very nice meaty flavor that has a twinge of gamey taste to it. To top it off, I split the daily sorbet and the chocolate cake with my girlfriend. The chocolate cake was above-average, but nothing compared to the top-notch cakes I've had elsewhere (like Gotham Bar & Grill). The sorbet was 3 well-selected and diverse scoops...one pistachio flavor, one citrus, and one that I didn't try (because it was at the bottom, and I had switched desserts by then).The service was average; I didn't understand the waiter very well, so it was hard to understand what was in all of the daily specials.

In the horrific words of Rachel Ray ""Yum-O"". (I'm not a RR fan, but I find those words so appropriate right now. I can't explain my creative genius. Please detect the sarcasm.)The cod was a wildy enormous dish and I couldn't even come close to finishing (which never happens to me).

And, the highlight of the evening, an actual wood burning fireplace at the middle of the restaurant.Over all I gave it 3 stars since even though it was a good dining experience I wasn't very much excited about it afterwards.

3.0,1/28/2011,"""Good evening, Ms. M. You are the first to arrive. Would you like to wait by the bar?""Those dreaded words, they're code for, ""Would you like to wait by the bar so that we can suck out of you that money you weren't planning to spend?"" Ugh, fine, if you INSIST. I silently cursed my beloved and usually quite punctual bestie (who would, in the end, arrive half an hour late) and sourly did as I was told. But what was that saying about one door closing and a window opening? Yes, quite applicable to this particular outing. As I slid onto a stool, I was cheerfully greeted by V___, an incredibly charming fellow who would rescue me from my thumb-twiddling doldrums. He made me a margarita, per my request, while I tried to look interested in the wine list. I stopped pretending when I saw the word ""Lambrusco."" Twice! I lit up, then faded back again when I realized that I had maxed my one-drink quota for the evening with the (albeit delicious) tequila concoction. V, a twinkle in his eye, stated that, as the restaurant was hosting a large party, he could let me taste both versions of my favorite wine. (Game!) As he entertained me with fun, obscure trivia, he pushed towards me an untouched sampler plate a server brought for him to nibble on. (Set!) And when my companion (finally) arrived, he threw in a drop of Italian sparkling wine for the both of us. (Match!)V was so ebullient that my bestie and I ended up asking for our table at 8p instead of our reserved 7p. Sadly, that is when I Trulli turned into a pumpkin. I had heard marvelous things about the restaurant's hand-made pasta dishes, above all the Orecchiette (ear-shaped pasta in a rabbit ragu). All lies. The morsels of rabbit - its meat dry and bitter - brought the dish down, down, down. Even the Panzerotti (baby calzones filled with tomato and mozzarella) were, to my astonishment, a disappointment. (I suppose I need to stop with the irrational expectation that munchkin foods will taste exponentially better than the originals...)At the end of the meal, I alerted the server that my margarita had been omitted from the bill. He left to make an inquiry, then returned with: ""We like honest people. It's on the house."" That response smelled of V's sly handiwork...",1,2,3,Kira M.,"Los Angeles, CA",67,155,21

4.0,10/27/2010,"I first heard of I Trulli in an episode of Food Network's The Best Thing I Ever Ate.  The Orecchiette with Rabbit Ragu was the dish featured, and a big part of the buzz behind the dish was not only the delicious sauce, but that on particular evenings, diners can actually watch Dora, the owner's mother, making all the pasta by hand.  It's always made in house, whether or not she puts on a show.  Also, the pastas are available in appetizer or entree portions (I love when restaurants do that) so you can have a tasting of pasta and still have room for a more substantial entree.My friend and I decided to get 2 pasta appetizers and 2 fish entrees and split everything, which is an excellent plan to get to try more food!  We had to get the famous orecchiette with the tomatoey braised rabbit ragu, and also tried the special pasta of the day, Paglia e Fieno (I believe) which translated into ""straw and hay.""  It featured both regular egg spaghetti and spinach spaghetti, chanterelle mushrooms, prosciutto, peas, and a touch of cream.  We enjoyed both a lot.  The orecchiette had a lovely chewy texture, melt-in-your-mouth chunks of rabbit meat slowly cooked in a slightly sweet tomato sauce.  The spaghetti also had a great texture and tasted very light for a dish tossed in cream.  I enjoyed the mixture of textures and flavors, but was surprised as to how small the mushrooms and prosciutto were cut, as it was difficult to decipher them at times just by looking (in the defense of my vision, the seating area was very dimly lit).Both fishes were cooked perfectly, juicy and delicious, not dry at all.  The cod boasted both an eggplant puree and some eggplant chunks along with roasted red peppers.  I love eggplant and really enjoyed these flavors together, and even slightly preferred this dish to the swordfish.  My dining companion actually preferred the swordfish, so I guess it was just a matter of taste.  That was served with tomatoes, artichokes, and green olives, a nice Mediterranean feel.  Like I said, both fish dishes were nicely cooked, flavorful, and very juicy.  It was a nice finish to our meal.  We were too full for dessert, but the menu definitely looked alluring to both of us.  Maybe next time!",0,0,0,Victoria K.,"Cranston, RI",579,664,2519

4.0,8/31/2010,"I went here for dinner with a party of three.  We had all been sucked in by Michael Psilakis's praises on ""Best Thing I Ever Ate.""  I mean, if an Iron Chef raves about a place (and moreover, a dish), it has to be good.We all ordered the prix fixe menu, which included baby calzones, burrata cheese, a choice of the famed orecchiette in a rabbit ragu or cavatelli (two of us ordered the former, one the latter), a choice of lamb chops or grilled octopus (again, two of the former, and one of the latter), and a watermelon parfait.  The calzones, quite frankly, reminded me of fried wonton skins.  Anything fried guarantees a ""yum"" from me, but the calzones were nothing special.  The burrata was served with a salad of chicory and colatura; the mild, buttery cheese was extremely satisfying when paired with the greens.  The immensely hyped orecciette was decent, but I can't say it would be on my list if I ever got to spout the best things I've ever eaten to national television.  My dad, who ordered the cavatelli, said the dumplings were akin to gnocchi.  The lamb chops were excellent, and were good to the last bit of cartilage-matter stuck on the bone, according to my mom (I have to agree with that completely).  However, the same could not be said for the side of dandelion served with the lamb; it tasted as bitter as the ibuprofen pill i once attempted to chew.  The octopus was surprisingly tender and not chewy, although the sight of the creature presented on the plate might turn those unfamiliar with it off.  Finally, the parfait was quite good; I'm not a big fan of the fruit in general, but I polished off the generous serving in minutes before experiencing a nasty case of shivers.Overall, the meal was very good, if not ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate.""  If you'd like to eat here for dinner, I suggest you make reservations or drop by later rather than sooner; our 9:00 meal was enjoyed without a full crowd.  The waitstaff (at least on an uneventful night) was very attentive, and the meal was paced well.  If the weather is perfect, I Trulli is a wonderful place to eat outdoors.  If the weather is typical of the city, though, it's better off to enjoy your meal in the warm and inviting indoor dining area.",1,0,0,Brennan L.,"East Bay, CA",401,260,169

Rumor has it that an old Italian woman makes the pasta fresh for patrons to see during certain days, but I didn't have a chance to catch her. This place is wonderful to bring a date.I'll be damned if I let a little bit of aesthetic amazement cloud my palette though! The food is really unspectacular, and the most enjoyable item I had here was the starter bread. The rabbit ragu wasn't bad... but it just wasn't that good. Maybe I lacked the finer tasting points of a well-renown chef to place it as the best meal ever, but the rabbit didn't even taste like rabbit.

1.0,11/8/2009,"Went to the enoteca side on a Friday night with a group.  The place was maybe half-full, certainly not busy, and seemed properly staffed for a Friday night.  There was absolutely no sense of welcome - they didn't seem to care whether people were there and being served or not. The bartender had an incredible ability to avoid eye contact with everyone at all times, too.  What a great skill for a bartender, no?The menu of wines by the glass has absolutely no descriptions of the individual wines.  I'm sorry, but what kind of enoteca is this?  The bartender was absolutely no help when asked for guidance.  When flights were ordered, the fill levels varied widely from glass to glass, giving the impression that the customer is either being cheated or they just don't care.  To top it all off, I ordered an aged grappa which was brought to me in a shot glass, which is traditional, I suppose, but when I politely requested a snifter, the bartender rolled her eyes at me.  Sorry, but when I go to a pretentious wine bar, if someone is going to roll their eyes at me, it should be because I ask for an ice cube in my Pinot Grigio, not because I ask for proper glassware!As far as the food is concerned, the menu looks fantastic but delivers expensive (and tiny bites) of middling quality.  The fried artichokes were burnt, woody, stringy, and flavorless, and the mint sauce made no sense.  Cheese was thrown on a plate in awkward sizes with no utensil to cut it with.  Fettunta with a white bean puree was served with the puree on the plate topped by the toast points, again with no utensil.  All of the ingredients are there for this to be a fine place, but the consistent lack of care and consideration taints almost every aspect of the experience.Given the numerous other fantastic wine bars in the city, I found absolutely no reason to return here.",0,0,0,M U.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,19,1

2.0,10/21/2009,"If you decide to dine here, don't order the Calamaretta dish which is a ring-shaped pasta dish with mussels, clams, zucchini and cherry tomatoes. There was a good amount of mussels and clams however they need to improve on fully cooking their pasta. How hard is it to prepare ring-shaped pasta?! Anyway, I ended up asking the waiter to cook the pasta a little longer. 10 minutes later the waiter came back and told me that the chef prepared a new batch of ring-shaped pasta... however it was still undercooked. The manager even came by our table and mentioned that the pasta still look undercooked but oh well I wasn't in the mood for round three. So, I left my silly ring-shaped pasta on my plate and finished the clams, zucchini and cherry tomatoes instead. Okay, so my dish was not so great and another friend of mine ordered some other dish that tasted like Hamburger Helper. It was starting to get late and it was time to pay for the bill and be on our way. My friends gave me cash for their share so I asked the waiter to use the cash and put the remainding amount on my card. BAD IDEA! I come to find out that I got charged for the entire bill on my card and who knows what happened to the cash. After contacting my bank and waiting to see if I Trulli would transfer the unauthorized funds back to my bank account which never happened, the dispute center ended up reversing the funds after investigation.

We then shared the heirloom tomato and mozzarella appetizer, and the corn fritters with goat cheese. The cheeses served at I Trulli are to die for!!! All of the entrees had perfectly selected ingredients that truely complimented each other. I don't think you could possibly go wrong at this place! We ordered a tiramisu for dessert, and were surprised with two additional complimentary desserts. The manager was a doll too. She was chatting it up with everyone in the resturaunt and going table to table. I love managers that really interact with their customers and deliver a personal experience by engaging you in conversation. She even sent us over three glasses of a delicious dessert wine!

We did not get off to a great start, as the bottle of Chianti we ordered didn't taste so great...a bit on the tart side, so we did not accept it. Luis brought us a bottle of ""reserve"" Chianti which was much better! For appetizers, we shared the heirloom tomatoes with fresh buffalo mozzarella cheese and a garbanzo bean fritter with fresh goat cheese(sorry, I don't remember the name of this delicious dish); then we shared a first course - orecchiette with rabbit sauce. Awesome flavors! For the second course, we had our own entree- I thoroughly enjoyed the fresh tuna that was prepared to perfection, Ryan had the lamb and his friend, Desiree had the swordfish. All we could say was, ""oh my God, this is delicious""! For dessert, we shared the tiramisu in memory of our dear friend Patty who loved tiramisu. Luis treated us to 2 additional desserts- complimentary creme brulee and a chocolate torte. The general manager completed our meal with a complimentary glass of Maivasia Frizzante '05.

We eat at a very good Italian restaurant in Brooklyn every once in awhile, and we really love it, but I Trulli is a nice change from the classic Mozz, Marinara, and Marsala style Italian food. We found all the food to be very well balanced in flavors, even our dessert was very well thought out, a not so sweet chocolate cake with a coffee sauce and sweet fresh wipped cream, devine. We really liked the decor, it was simple, but the lighting made it feel romantic. The garden in the back looks very pretty, but since it was chilly and windy out we chose to sit inside.We will be back to I Trulli again I'm sure, maybe to the front bar next time where it seems they offer a pretty decent menu also, and a bit cheaper.

5.0,7/25/2009,"Yet another typically humid summer day in NYC, my afternoon was surprisingly interrupted by a late lunch with a couple of Frenchy, Los Angeles fashionista friends who were in town for business. Gotta love the French for making sure to pull you away from the normal schedule and beeline for the afternoon respite of their version of ""afternoon tea"".  Giggling down the street soon after meeting up, we quickly duck into Enoteca, a slightly romantic looking Italian wine bar for some wine, cheese and other savory afternoon snacks. Immediately upon entering, you are immersed into a dark, rustic and warm little world of small tables and countless bottles of wine.  Our hostess seated the four of us into a little corner table and several servers surrounded us, setting the table, handing us menus and pouring water.  The attention was top notch, like something from a small, yet elegant European Cafe.A bottle of French wine was ordered, brought to the table and uncorked right away.  They served each of us a taste, a little out of the norm from my experience but very considerate of them.  The wine was delicious.  A fuller bodied merlot, with an excellent balance of spice and berries, smooth finish.  We're giddy.A bread basket filled with an herb and tomato foccacia arrives almost as quickly.  Perhaps one of the best foccacias I've ever had.  Just the right amount of delicious olive oil, fresh tomatos and soft bread.Our first plate arrives.  A mixture of prosciutto, figs, manchego and gorgonzola cheese arranged neatly with a couple of Grissini crossing over the plate.  The prosciutto almost melts in your mouth.  The manchego is smooth and gorgonzola has just the right amount of pungency. Our next plate is of fresh ricottta cheese and spinach.  Fresh ricotta is one of my favorites...and this dish meets my expectations.  Smooth but not that pungent...it's a fun cheese the way it almost morphs with the slightly bitter steamed spinach.Our next and final shared plate is of rabbit, tuna style, a Tuscan favorite.  The rabbit is prepared similar to the way canned tuna fish can be prepared...a variation of sliced and shredded with oils, herbs...maybe a bit of mayonnaise and it is served on bruschetta bread.  The flavor is delicious.  A slightly gamey version of tuna fish is really the best way to compare the taste.All along we've received the most attentive service which we find impressive.  We're happily satiated for now, the servers allow us to linger (which is nice to not have to be rushed out), we finish our bottle of wine and we finally request our bill.We slowly make our exit, donning our rock star shades noting that this little gem is one to keep on the list!",0,0,0,Joanne B.,"Mammoth Lakes, CA",83,283,39

What I like about this place the most is their garden in the back, always nice to have a great time drinking wine with great friends in the back.Portions are generous, and the food has always been fresh! The bar at the front is a nice little touch; one of the few places where I wouldn't mind if my friends were late, just pull up a seat and enjoy a glass of wine.The ravioli and lamb (Angello) are never a letdown.",5,0,3,Armin L.,"New York, NY",20,84,0
5.0,5/14/2008,"i came here for restaurant week this year and loved it.  the homemade pasta is really good, and they have a great wine list.the crowd is a really good mix.. i sat at the bar while waiting for my friends, had a glass of wine, and found myself chatting with some of the people at the bar, who were super nice.waiter service was also really good-didn't have to wait long for anything, they were really accommodating, professional, etc.the atmosphere is also nice-not too dark, not too brightly lit.  will definitely come back!",0,0,0,Ashley T.,"San Francisco, CA",34,83,9
5.0,4/21/2008,"I always pass this place and thought it looked cute, so I after reading the reviews on Yelp, I decided to take my former boss (& good friend) here.  I made reservations for a Friday night at 8:45 pm.  When we got there they told us that if we waited 15 minutes they could seat us on the back garden so we sat at the bar and ordered a drink while we waited.  The host was able to seat us before we got our drinks from the bartender so he said he would send the drinks over, but it took about 20 minutes for the drinks to finally come.  We sat at a cozy table next to the fountain.  The wine list is huge, so we asked the server for a suggestion and got a bottle of Sangiovese to go along with dinner.  For an appetizer we had the Panzerotti Baby calzones filled with mozzarella and tomato, which were very yummy.  I had the Malloreddus Sardinian saffron dumplings with sausage and tomato for dinner and my friend had the Orecchiette Ear-shaped pasta in a rabbit rag.  Both were very good and the portions were not too big so you didn't feel stuffed afterwards.  We also had a chocolate cake with coconut ice cream that was delicious.  I would definitely come back here.  The place was welcoming, clientele very mixed (families, couples), food was delicious, restaurant was roomier than expected, service pretty good and beautiful garden for the warmer months.",0,0,0,Sheree A.,"Seattle, WA",8,26,6
1.0,4/13/2008,"We had a large party, 9 people, and one of the more frustrating dining experiences I've ever had at these prices.  The service wasn't so much bad, as completely non-existent.  The waiter came to get our drink orders, our mains (this process was slow, but not ridiculously so), and then literally never returned.  Did we want more wine?  Yes, probably (it was a party), but I wasn't going to chase him around the restaurant to get it.  What sort of resteraunt doesn't try to sell you wine?  They have a tremendous wine list, but apparently no interest in selling it.  They did come by to remove our wine glasses before we had even gotten our entrees which is unusual, to say the least.Our appetizers were bland, and took forever to show up.  Charging 14 dollars for an arugla salad dressed in lemon is bad enough, but it really shouldn't take 45 minutes to get it.  The meatballs were fine, on the plus side.Another hour-plus, we're complaining about our mains not showing up (I had to pretty much chase down the waiter to get him to talk to me), and we're assured that they are coming right out.  Twenty minutes after that, they show up.  Everything was fine - not great - but fine.  The saffron dumplings were tasty enough.  Overall, not quite what I'd expect at the prices, but not horrible.  But we were not in a mood to be charitable after the service.At no point did the management apologize, let alone comp us for a bottle of wine or anything of that sort (it was truly the least they could do).  Our waiter actually left the restaurant during our service in street clothes, never to return.  Since he didn't come by anyway, it didn't make a huge impact on anything but his tip, but still, that's pretty pathetic for a restaurant with pretensions like I Trulli.If they could sort out their problems and actually value customers (normally a hallmark of a good Italian restaurant), they might have a nice thing going.  They don't, and we won't be going back.",2,0,1,Jeff L.,"Washington, DC",0,13,0
4.0,2/14/2008,"I really wanted to give this a 3.5 but rounded to a 4 as nothing was particularly wrong. The service was out of this world. Every time I needed something it was like they were mind readers. My water glass was always full and the food came out super fast. For an appetizer we had calamari that was definitely fresh. It came out nice and hot like it was just pulled out of the frier. It was 5 startcalamari. For my entree I had sea bass and it was just alright. The beans it was served with were yummy and unique. It was a good combination of sunflower seeds, garbanzo beans, and a few other goodies. All and all it was quite pricey for the portion. I would have liked another side dish with it. Maybe some spinach or broccoli. After our meal we had green tea which came out in a fancy looking individual tea maker but was sort of weak. In summary I gave it 4 stars for its handmade pasta's that you can watch while you wait, great service, and good calamari. I took one star for price and my plain sea bass but I would give it another visit. My guest was quite happy.",3,2,2,Vanessa y.,"San Jose, CA",177,135,3
4.0,11/14/2007,"I went to dinner here after work on a weeknight.  The service was excellent (we went early though) and the food was great.  The fresh pasta with seafood dish and the Tirimisu were delicious.  In the back is a patio and more tables which would be nice in the summer, the place is big and spacious and you don't feel like you're piled on top of other guests.  I will definitely be returning.",0,0,0,Tiffany T.,"Jersey City, NJ",7,46,0
5.0,8/26/2007,"An Italian ex-NYer knew I was going to New York on a business trip and asked me, another Italian ex-NYer,  to try this place, as she has been getting their emails for a long time but hadn't yet gotten there.What  a great recommendation.  Everything was superb. We started with a special appetizer of shrimp served over a bread/tomato sauce. The whole dish was cooked in the wood fired oven. It was outstanding.My mixed green salad was served with a small ""panelle,"" a chickpea fritter with goat cheese ""sandwich."" Very tasty.Someone at the table ordered ""panzerotti,"" small pugliese calzones filled with fresh mozzarella and tomato. These got raves by everyone.My favorite dish was the ""cavatelli,"" pugliese pasta dumpllngs with broccoli rabe and roasted almonds. I'm a huge fan of pasta and broccoli rabe, and this dish was outstanding. The cavatelli were perfectly plump and the flavors merged together perfectly.  If this restaurant weren't 3000 miles from where I live, I can guarantee I'd weigh 10 pounds more because I'd eat this dish all the time. (Would I then be Trulli addicted??)My co-worker ordered the special pounded pork chop served with rosemary and potatoes. I'm pretty sure he wanted to lick the plate was he was done.For desert we tried the tiramisu and the Italian-style cheesecake. It's not often that you see this type of cheesecake on the menu and it was quite authentic and delicious. And the tiramisu didn't disappoint, either. Again, all plates went back empty.All in all, quite a find. I will certainly make another trip to I Trulli the next time I'm in NY.",3,0,1,stacy o.,"San Francisco, CA",7,48,4
1.0,7/11/2007,"Ok, the food's good, the space is quite nice, but the service is just lousy.   We live two blocks from here and when we moved in last Feb. we were looking for a nice neighborhood place we could meet for dinner on the way home once or twice a week.  Well, after tonight, probably our 5th or 6th attempt at liking this place, we're never going back. The service just keeps getting worse.   We kind of stayed away for a few months after our first two miserable attempts, but it's not improved. Frankly, it's incredible.  The wait staff in both dining rooms -but particularly in the small, cute wine bar, Enoteca- is awful.  Expect to always wait 20 minutes for menus.  You'll wait even longer to place your drink order.  And odds are you still won't have a glass of water...  Yeah, the food is quite good -sometimes almost 4-star quality (which is why we kept going back)- but really, it's just not worth it.   We have never had good service and, sadly, this great, earthy place never became our weekly rendezvous because of it.   Best,A",1,0,1,Adam S.,"New York, NY",1,8,0
4.0,6/16/2007,"I enjoyed the fresh pasta but if I went again, I'd try the meat.  The lamb dish looked excellent.  If I did go back for another pasta dish, I'd choose the Orecchiette over the Tagliolini.  Both were good but the Tagliolini had more flavor.  The desserts were good but the flan was better than the tiramisu.  Overall, very good food, ok service, and a bit expensive.",2,0,0,Kristina W.,"New York, NY",13,201,17
4.0,5/19/2007,"Great Italian food and a great atmosphere to have dinner.  The service is a little spotty, but the food more than makes up for it.  I was here with a group of 6 and every one really enjoyed the meal.  For an appetizer, I would recommend the calamari, which is not fried, so you can taste the fish and the fried rabbit.  For an entree, I thought the fresh orecchiette and the rack of lamb were excellent.  You may as well go all out at this place and treat yourself to some dessert - the flan and tiramisu were both good.

4.0,5/4/2007,"I have now eaten here twice on someone else's dime, and I gotta say, I could get used to it!  The first time was a work lunch with my new boss at the time and the woman I was replacing, as a farewell lunch to her.  It gets very, very busy during lunchtime because of all the business people schmoozing and wining & dining.  But it's a fairly large restaurant with a big back garden, so it doesn't feel cramped, just a bit loud and lively.The second time I went was for dinner, again with coworkers.  This time, we were being treated to our Secretary's Day dinner by the big boss man.  We sat in the back garden on a lovely spring evening at about 6pm, and it wasn't crowded at all.  The service was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  Our waitress had to explain a few of the dishes on the menu since this wasn't a typical spaghetti & red sauce Italian restaurant, but one that aimed for authenticity.  She also informed us that most of the primi dishes could be served as a smaller appetizer portion so you could also order a secondi.  I was still a bit full from my very late lunch and was worried that I wouldn't be able to enjoy my meal here, so I opted for some lighter fare.  I decided on one of the specials, a monkfish with shellfish (clams & mussels) in a lemon, (ever so slight) butter and thyme broth.  It was tasty in its simplicity, and was the perfect portion - not too filling, not too skimpy.  A few of the other women ordered risotto with shrimp and enjoyed it, while one woman ordered the veal chops and raved about it (the chops were surprisingly big).The dessert menu had some intriguing choices, so it was good that we all still had room for it.  I actually went with a favorite of mine, tiramisu, while others tried the Italian cheesecake with fig compote,  the flourless chocolate cake and the white chocolate flan.  My tiramisu was good, but definitely not the best I've had.  Next time, I'd order the flan since it was really yummy!I'd say the food is 3.5 stars - it didn't blow me away, but it was solidly good.  The ambiance, service and back garden help to bump it up to a healthy 4 stars.",2,0,3,Kristine R.,"Astoria, NY",299,363,1
