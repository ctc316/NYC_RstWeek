Service was so bad I had to find the host to get our check, our server disappeared. We were served rock hard stale rolls. My salmon was served skin up and was just dreadful.

I don't think I've ever left this much food on a plate. Service was t frat and the soup was watery/weak, but the burger was a crime against food. And the prices are sky high.

3.0,2/14/2019,"Came for Valentine's Day. It was part of a prix fixe three course menu with skating. I had risotto with egg and black truffles, it was okay. The risotto was a tiny bit hard. I then had the Duck Two Ways. It was supposed to be breast with a leg confit but I think I was only served breast. I ordered it medium rare, it came with one end dried out hard to a crisp, some slices well done, and the rest completely rare. I ended up sending it back. They sent me a new one that was indeed beautifully medium rare on all fronts.The salad that came with the duck (a frisée/radish combo) was super underwhelming. No balance with the duck. It was also served with some sort of beans, then were large, black, and dry. I didn't finish it.I had no issues with my server.

The waiter and staff are less than friendly; the waiter never once smiled! And they are not very attentive. The soup was bland, lukewarm and very sloppily served. The bottle of Merlot was fantastic and the entree and dessert were great. The only person who was happy was the hostess. The atmosphere was great and watch by the ice skating rink was fun. We even saw a proposal. Overall very nice but if I returned I wouldn't expect happy staff just a good bottle of wine and appetizers will do... even though the pasta was fantastic and my mom loved the salmon!

We had three vegetarians and they stated that their trays are already pre-prepared and there are no modifications that can be made. We were stuck with all these meat sandwiches that more than half of our party cannot even enjoy. Their hot chocolate is made with water and not milk. We made a reservation at this place for tea which was included in a package for a reservation for ice-skating at Rockefeller Center. We were told that this package included not having to wait in line and our server also confirmed this information. Unfortunately, after having our meal we proceeded to the area where everyone was lined up for the ice-skating rink. They made us stand in line with everybody including those that did not have a reservation in advance. We booked the tea solely for the purpose of not having to wait in line.

4.0,1/31/2019,"Big surprise!!  Our expectations for lunch were modest, as we chose this restaurant for its location.  The greeting is indifferent, but we were ushered to a window table ringside.  Our server was coarse, clumsy, and inept, but the food is the surprise.  [server removed my husbands plate without asking, and while I was still eating...he was clueless]. The restaurant week menu was concise but offered something for everyone. Our choices were the salads to start; the burrata and the roasted beets,  both nicely presented and tasty.  Entrees were a brisket sandwich, with fries, and the skate.   As someone who often orders skate, I can attest to the perfection of this dish...In a less than a lovely room, and a noise level that can be intrusive, the food is a wonderful contrast.   Thanks...",0,0,0,Thelma S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,69,0
1.0,1/26/2019,"Tip:  Review Your BillA dollar extra added for each of our glasses of wine was the finishing touch to an very unfortunate diner.  On the menu we recalled the wine was $15 a glass--our bill, $16--we probably wouldn't have even noticed but at the beginning of the evening when we asked our hapless waiter about a mysterious red that seemed interesting even though we didn't recognize it, he assured us it was a very light white.  We asked why it was listed as a red.  He wasn't sure and then proceded to suggest another ""white"".  We asked for a sample, tried it, liked it, and ordered it.  He asked if we were sharing?! No, two separate glasses would be fine. When we pointed out the discrepancy on our bill and asked to see a menu--he disappeared, went in search of a menu--they all lived at the host's podium but we watched as he wandered around--he didn't bring a menu but agreed it was $15 and he would bring another corrected bill.  That finally arrived.  It was now 8:45--we had planned to try the fabled hamburgers and were sure it would be a quick and easy dinner.  Our reservation was at 7:00.  They had plenty of time for leisurely service in the more than half-empty cavernous space.  We were offered rolls--the sourdough was so ""crusty"" we all had trouble breaking them open.  At some point in time, they had obviously been frozen and not given time to defrost--the centers were still frigid--well, the ice skating rink is right outside the windows so maybe it was to give a sense of solidarity with the skaters.  Our hamburgers arrive on buns so unappetizing, none of us ate them--mine was ordered rare--it appeared medium to well done with an after-taste of unclean grill lingering--the pickles are excellent however and if you like thousand island dressing infused with bacon the sauce for the hamburger is pretty good too.  The french fries are good hot but as they cooled down, we agreed, McDonald's still does it better.  When I pointed out my hamburger wasn't rare, the waiter did get the manager who offered to try again.  Not a believer in if at first, you don't succeed--I politely refused.   The waiter dispatched a busboy to clear plates, one problem, we hadn't finished.  Much to his chagrin, we had become the table from the city, most of the clientele seemed to be tourists, taking selfies, watching the skaters, and happy to be in a NYC restaurant, we had the audacity to order a dessert.  When we asked what was for dessert, he growled, the menu was on the dinner card on the table.  We ordered a slice of chocolate cake with ice cream, also icy and not memorable.  The plate was removed as soon as the last fork was put down and the check appeared immediately.  The take-away, the waiter and we probably agree on one thing, the Rock Center Cafe is not for the likes of us.",0,0,0,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",11,42,0

4.0,1/3/2019,"We returned, this time for breakfast. Both opting for the top-of-the-menu 2 eggs with bacon and spuds. Tip #1: if you're after quantity in the egg department, go with scrambled. It was a BIG, loving spoonful of just-right cooked eggs, fluffy and light. Cooked to order? No. But good. 3 slices of bacon and the hash browns were quite fine. This place offers a fine value. No, it's not inexpensive. But it's not (IMHO) over-priced. It's a singular spot. If you're lucky, you'll not only see super novicey skaters hug the rail and careen to the ice, but you might also catch the zamboni. Professional staff all around.

1.0,12/24/2018,"No, no, no, nope. Don't do it. Despite a 1:15 reservation we sat down at 2. There were five of us they sat at a four top. I sat in the isle - which meant that EVERYONE that walked by bumped into me - waitstaff and bus people included. We were hoping that reserving ahead meant a decent table but we were seated in the back with no view. This guy with bad breath brought us four rolls (again, there were five of us) which we gnawed through quickly because it took a while for waitstaff to come. We would have left long before this but, unfortunately we were starving and had my mother in law in tow who can't walk very well...so at this point we're committed.The food was horrible- this was a fixed price menu but we figured we'd try anyway, we were there for a show and it was convenient. $50 a plate. What came was soup from a can (I know Campbell's when I taste it), limp/brown lettuce, burger with gristle, and ice cream which my kids wouldn't even eat.

Not only were they running ridiculously behind and were obviously overbooked, but they made it worse by flat out lying to each reservation holder by stating that the seating would be 15 minutes, regardless of the actual wait. Twenty minutes later, we were told it would be another 15 minutes.

I was only 5 blocks away from the cafe and because of the light show, all of the crowds who refused to move when I asked both nicely and then ultimately lost my cool, the disgusting cops who made me go in circles, and after the phone call I had to make in regards to my reservation... I lost the reservation in 45 minutes of human traffic. I was so upset. This cafe, knowing how crazy it is in the area should have a more flexible reservation policy! If anyone makes a reservation, on days like this they should be seated regardless of whether the show up late or early! My whole entire experience and day was ruined! I'm a native New Yorker, I'm used to crowds but, everyone's behavior last night was completely unacceptable and I am not a door mat! It was okay for everyone to push and trample my child but, God forbid that I pushed an adult who refused to let me pass.

It was a special occasion with my sister-in-law, her daughters (10 & 17), our niece, and my my new daughter-in-law. It was my sister-in-law's first trip to NYC. We arrived at 6:45 to check-in knowing it is a busy time of year. We were greeted by the not so friendly maitre d', who informed us that we would be seated as soon as a table was available.At 7:45 we were finally seated and discovered that their regular menu had been switched to a holiday pre fixe menu. Had I known this in advance, I would have been able to inform the other dinner party guests, and book a reservation somewhere else. We spoke with the waitress about this, and we were told that would reduce the pre fixe price by $25/adult meal.Our niece had ordered the lobster bisque as the starter course, and when all of our starter courses were brought to the table, her's was not included. After a few minutes, we were able to get the attention of the waitress, and she went to the kitchen and returned with a tin measuring cup filled with the bisque and then poured it into the bowl. Not sure why she couldn't have done that in the kitchen as no other diners received their bisque in a tin measuring cup.When we received the bill, we discovered that the restaurant did not deduct the $125 from the bill, but had given us a $100 credit/points on Open Table. At that point I was so disgusted with the restaurant, I didn't pursue it. We paid full blowout Christmas prices for less than full service and experience.

3.0,12/16/2018,"Everyone thinks - Christmas, skating, the TREE, Rockefeller Center!  Let's try and make this Christmas experience something to remember!  And so, this is just what I did.  I booked the Rock Center Cafe on a Thursday night after our show at Radio City Music Hall (Christmas Spectacular which was amazing by the way!).  I booked this reservation in August for my daughter's birthday which was  during Christmas, requesting a window seat if possible, but also noting it was her birthday when making the reservation.During this time, the meal is a fixed price for the Holiday Season.I think overall, this restaurant is overrated.  Honestly, it is very overpriced for what you receive with the fixed price menu option, very small portions, and also VERY busy during this time of year ~ you're just another number.  Staff was polite as always, but honestly, no special treatment here, not even any mention of my daughter's birthday (perhaps a candle).  I left the restaurant spending $300 for 2 adults, one child, no alcoholic beverages, and left hungry, even after my husband and I finished off our child's chicken fingers.I advise you to get a hot cocoa and walk by the rink and tree, take it all in, or even perhaps visit bar at Rock Center Cafe'.  That's just my opinion during the Christmas season.",0,0,0,Madison U.,"Boston, MA",0,5,0

It was as far away from the ice skating ring as it could possibly be (and we had specifically asked to have a table near the ice so the kids could watch the skaters)  People that were in the bar waiting for their tables would sit on the wall right by our heads and hang their coats all around us.  It was not the kind of experience you would expect for the money you have to pay for their fixed price Thanksgiving menu.  And the food is average at best.  We will not be coming back.  There are WAY too many great places to eat in NY.,0,0,0,Cortney S.,"North Dallas, Dallas, TX",0,4,0

1.0,7/18/2018,"The afternoon before my dining experience, I called the restaurant to make sure their normal menu would be available for the reservation we had made days earlier, as they had some kind of event going on the next day.  A woman picked up the phone and spoke to me as though I had deeply disturbed her, sighing before answering the simplest conceivable question: have food?After answering me she traded no friendliness and hung up abruptly. Fine, whatever.The next day we arrived for our reservation, where we had requested to eat outside. We saw multiple people, (older, white, and wealthy looking) being escorted to outdoor seating. They then proceeded to tell us they had no available seating outside, a bold lie to tell two young people who could clearly see otherwise. What is with the attitude the staff of this place have? The man on hosting duties was just extraordinarily rude, and taken aback when we called his bold faced lie to his face. He showed us to our seat.The waiter was rude, and gave us the impression that we were the least important table on the premises. Why? We are both young, did they think we were just going to order apps and leave?The food was as good as anything you could order from a Friday's at 4x the cost. Bill came, plopped on our table wordlessly, but our waiter was VERY quick to collect the mediocre tip we left him.Ironically, I would have had no problem giving a larger tip if we had been treated like people. We were perfectly pleasant, having just come from a Fallon taping, and our attitude was friendly and reflected that. Immediately, one gets the sense from Rock Center Cafe that they are the embodiment of that stuck up, elitist attitude that stereotypes New York dining. Upsetting, considering how many out-of-towner's probably dine here after engaging in their NBC experience.I'm angry and disappointed by both the way we were treated (and explicitly and poorly LIED to) and by the poor quality of the overpriced food. 1/5 - definitely do not recommend.Edit: We has the skirt steak and the Atlantic salmon.

5.0,4/4/2018,"Let me start out by telling myself how stupid I was. I walked by this fantastic establishment for years, never to dine there once. I always knew it existed, but never tried it. How could I have been so dumb? Trying the place was one of the best decisions I have made in a long time. The restaurant itself is located on the concourse level of Rockefeller Plaza. It is easily accessed by a glass elevator from the plaza level, clearly marked with the restaurant's name, or from the entrance from the underground concourse level shops. The latter is convenient if you are coming via subway. The restaurant has windows that overlook the plaza, which is an ice skating rink during the winter, and an outdoor dining room in warmer months. Anyway, on to the experience itself. I came on April 2nd with a friend after spending a bit of time at the Museum of Natural History uptown. We arrived at Rockefeller by subway and entered the restaurant from underground. We were promptly seated at a lovely window table overlooking the rink. (It was still up at the time.) Our waiter, whose name I'm not aware of, was friendly and attentive. I ordered a ginger ale to drink, which was very good because the fountain mixed it properly. Some places do it incorrectly. My friend had a glass of red wine. The waiter picked a glass that suited what she had ordered and she liked the wine very much. We ordered no appetizers as we had had a large breakfast at Naples 45 earlier. (Tip-Naples is another great restaurant in Midtown. Located at the MetLife Building, they are an Italian Restaurant, and have a delicious breakfast. It also happens to be in the same restaurant group as Rock Center Café.) For our entree, I had the shrimp Caesar salad. It was delicious! The shrimp was magnificently fresh, over a bed of perfectly dressed Romaine with the traditional croutons. My friend has the French Dip (au jus) sandwich. We both tried each other's dishes, and I must say the meat on the sandwich was perfectly cooked and the bread fresh, and the fact that they served it with mushrooms gave it even more flavor. For dessert, we had the ice cream trio. The ice cream, which is house made, is some of the best I've had in the city ever. The three flavors were chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry; all delicious. Since we ordered coffee as well, they served absolutely scrumptious biscotti as well. The only complaint of the entire afternoon was that the waiter brought out a Macchiato instead of the Cappuccino I had ordered. But no big deal, it was easily corrected. Overall, this was a thoroughly amazing and enjoyable experience and I will soon be back. I am still happy I tried it, but mad I didn't sooner. I hope you like it like I did!

1.0,1/3/2018,Perfect example of tourist restaurant-which is expected considering where it is but it was awful!!! The waiter was rude and short and very unfriendly!  The other waiters were arguing all evening behind us. One waitress was so horrible to a bus boy-humiliating him-yelling at him in front of guests. i felt so bad for this grown man. The bus boys were dropping plates and glasses making a huge commotion probably because they are so unhappy. The food was inedible! The noodles were raw in the bolognese and the sauce tasted canned. The desserts were frozen and clearly bought from a third party. For $450 i expect more even from a tourist trap!

The steak was topped w/ brussel sprouts, pom seeds, horseradish sauce - honestly so good. Dessert was okay and I probably would have not ordered if not included, but still a good price.

We have visited many times over the years so we are familiar with the fine dining that is offered in this wonderful city. We just returned from a late night holiday dinner that was fixed price. We paid $350 for 2 adults / 2 children. My compliments to the chef/management for pulling off the biggest SHAM- taking advantage of the holiday season as well as the cache of its internationally recognized name. My husband ordered a glass of Chardonnay. The Chardonnay was definitely cheap wine at $16.00 a glass. I ordered a Bloody Mary which I sent back as it was poorly prepared. Ordered scallops and pork for appetizers. For dinner we ordered the fillet, quinoa cake, kids pasta, kids fish & chips. It was easy to tell that the quality of food was very poor- no better than a local diner. For dessert we ordered the apple pie, brownie, brownie sundae. Desserts from Costco were of better quality than this. Our waiter was fine & the atmosphere was festive with a great view of the ice skating rink, but it was certainly not enough to compensate for a terrible meal. Please know that we are not afraid to pay to eat well. We enjoyed outstanding dinners at Esca the 1st night, followed by Estela last night with the tab at approximately $300+ each night for the 4 of us.

Unfortunately the older I get the less patience I have for the crowd, the cold and the insanity that ensues in this general vicinity so we decided to make an early (6:15pm) reservation on a Saturday. Arrived on time, there was a ""15 minute delay"" which turned into 30 minutes but we got really lucky and got seats by the bar and had a couple of drinks. Once our table was ready, we were sat right at the window by the ice rink -- as a previous review read, it's definitely chilly by the window. I had to keep my jacket draped over my shoulders however, the entertainment value was endless AND I saw 3 people get engaged within an hour. I'm not entirely sure if this is year-round but I'm assuming during the holidays they offer a prix fix menu. 3 course = $75. I had the organic mixed greens (okay), the filet (delish) and the lemon cake (not fresh). All in all, I believe you get exactly what you come for here.

5.0,11/25/2017,"It's Christmas season in Manhattan. There's no place I look forward to visiting more than the Rockefeller Center area. The decorated Christmas tree, the 50 state flags fluttering in the wind, the golden Prometheus statue, the skating rink, the illuminated 30 Rock (Comcast Building) and neighboring Radio City Music Hall all provide a Yuletide visual treat. The Saks Fifth Avenue windows are there as well as is the street level Today studio. A good place to have a meal and/or drink in the area is the Rock Center Cafe. I'll tell you why. But first, I'll mention reasons some people say not to go there: It's a tourist trap. It's pricey. Service can be slow (if you get the wrong server--it's union, so it's hard to get rid of the bad ones). The food is meh. It's crowded. These are some of the negatives people have written about. This has not been my experience, and I'm a New Yorker and pick my restaurants thoughtfully. I've never had a bad meal here, the service has been professional and the restaurant is pleasingly designed. The main draw for me is the setting--the view you get through the floor to ceiling south-facing windows. You see the skaters up close. You see the colorful flags and landmarked buildings. SNL and MSNBC originate from here. Fox News is down the street (I'm trying to be fair and balanced).I find the food to be good--actually better than it needs to be given that the main draw is Rockefeller Center. I highly recommend the pastas. The fish is a good choice. Omelets are good for breakfast or lunch. Deserts are great. If your looking for great meal in Manhattan, there are countless restaurants I could recommend. But none can offer a total holiday experience like Rock Center Cafe. You also get to meet nice people from all over. Some suggestions. Make a reservations. Also book a tour of the NBC studios--you can go to 30 Rock directly indoors from the restaurant.",3,1,4,Zachary S.,"Vero Beach, FL",322,373,3440

But what about the other ten tables.  She said sorry.  So we didn't discuss it further but then our waiter ultimately ignored us.  He asked me if I wanted a drink, I don't drink but did not ask the others at the table.  Then the 15 people arrived at the other table and he catered to them.  We finally gave our order and waited so long, I asked  if it would be possible if they brought us some bread.  He said oh, you didn't get any, ok.  After our meal he never asked if we wanted dessert.  We did want coffee and asked if we could have some and some ice cream for the 2 children we had with us.  Just rude, rude, rude.   From the fool that took us to our seats to the end.   Don't go, or go with 15 people.",0,0,0,Rita P.,"Yonkers, NY",0,12,0

My coworkers and I come here on a Thursday for lunch - we'd decided to go somewhere nicer in the area as it was our last day working together. I tell the hostess that we don't have a reservation and I can see on her face that she thinks we're not worth her time because we're not tourists willing to spend exorbitant amounts of money. She proceeds to seat us right next to the huge fountain outdoors, tucked into the back corner where the sun umbrella doesn't fully cover, the fountain is too loud for nice conversation, and the wait staff have no idea you exist - fine. We get our menus and order, after which they proceed to give us each one roll of bread, instead of a bread basket, as if they were rationing us? My one coworker ordered off the NYC restaurant week menu which came with a salad which would have been great had the lettuce actually been edible instead of black and falling apart. Can't even imagine how this clearly inedible dish reached our table. They eventually replace the salad with a kale and strawberry salad which, to their credit, was actually appetizing. Coworker had finished her second salad and the rest of us were still waiting on our food. Let me interject here to say that we spent 2.5 hours here and not because we loved the ~ambiance~ but because we were waiting for our disappointing meal to actually show up.  Food finally comes out and it's actually so disappointing. The portions are so small. I ordered the $24 ""Light Lunch"" which was advertised as choice of 2 items perfectly portioned for lunch - hmmm riiight. Also ordered a side of fries (which would be more accurately described as a cup of fries which cost $NINE.)

Too bad he didn't give as much effort to his tables as he did to his conversations.  After receiving our drinks, we were never checked on again.  We could only watch as he wandered around to various places in the restaurant. 40 minutes after finishing our drinks, we finally got his attention long enough to ask for the bill.  My husband was pretty upset at this point.  Our bill was just over $30 for two drinks, which given the touristy nature and location isn't too ridiculous but we didn't feel the need to give a tip for the terrible service.  As we were walking up the stairs, John B proceeded to holler at us and flip us off.  Apparently he disagreed with our lack of tip and wanted to tell us in the most unprofessional way possible.

5.0,6/5/2017,"I agree with previous posters that Rock Center Cafe deserves more than 3 stars. Personally, I too would give it 4.5 if I could.This NYC historical landmark in the heart of the the plaza, is located right in the lower lever of the Rockefeller Center. A very convenient location for employees, tourists, and locals. In the Summer, the outdoor seating is a must! The tables sit on top of what would be the ice skating rink in subsequent months. And with individual umbrellas and possible breeze picking up from the landmark fountain, the experience is dare I say... almost tropical.The menu at Rock Center Cafe is simple, but covers all the bases. For my first trip, I ordered the lobster avocado lunch special salad. The lobster was hearty and flavors had remarkable depth. Service was friendly and efficient, and the real fresh ingredients and make tasty, simple dishes! Net net is... I know I'll certainly be returning soon.",1,0,0,Kelsey H.,"Hoboken, NJ",223,89,1304
5.0,6/4/2017,"Had a beautiful time with my three bestfriends! We're from Orlando so we always go to NY once a year to just enjoy the city life and this time around was great. Although photos really do not do justice, this scenery was AMAZING. I couldn't believe we were basically in the heart of NYC doing all of the wonderful things we were doing. We had the sweetest waitress who made us feel comfortable in all things - also, the manager on duty made it her business to come and check up on us, she shared a fun fact that she was also from Orlando! It was great being able to have a little piece of home with us. As for the food, we had all appetizers. Wings, loaded tots and calamari, all made with excellence. -- I didn't enjoy the ranch too much but that's the only negative experience. We all shared the DELICIOUS cheesecake, best in town!

4.0,5/30/2017,"So, I am not sure why I have seen an average of only 3 stars for Rock Center Cafe but, I would give it 4.5 if I could. We arrived on Saturday May 27th, 2017 for a trip to the city to see Hello Dolly with Bette Midler and David Hyde Pierce. We walked from Grand Central Station down to Rockefeller Plaza and thought this would be a nice place to eat outdoors. We were greeted by friendly staff, and there was a little confusion on what we were there for either Brunch or Appetizers and cocktails, because I guess seating makes a difference. It was cleared up promptly and we were guided to some great seats right by the fountain. I opted for a cocktail to go along with lunch, a Peach Bellini, and it was tasty, my only complaint that would bring it down from a 5 star occasion was that it was served warm. This should be ice cold especially on a day like Saturday with the sun beating down. My guest and I had a hard time deciding what to have because of the pretty decent sized offerings. We narrowed it down to the Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad and the RCC Grain Bowl. I asked the waiter if there was any way that he could bring us two small plates so that we could share, and he one upped it, he brought us two plates already shared for us to enjoy. The Caesar Salad is what you would expect, and the RCC Grain Bowl was Toasted Farro, Red Quinoa, Kale, Avocado, Cucumber, Tomatoes, Feta Cheese, Lemon Vinaigrette. Both of them were amazing! The chicken portions on them was unbelievable, there was enough to share with two more guests. I even eyed the food at the table next to us (Waffles and Calamari) and they looked great too. The waitstaff here were great, kind and patient when we did not know what we wanted to order, and helpful with us gathering our barrings to head back to the Theater District.

Right when we were about to order the waiter said dinner would be starting in 5 or so minutes but couldn't be split if our party was doing a brunch.

Pasta was hot and fresh with a really good velvety tomato sauce, but you can really get that anywhere for a fraction of the price.

Had eaten their once before at Christmas and it was great, a four star experience for sure.This week was one star for food but view of the ice-rink is unique New York experience so that makes it two. Bonus star as once before was great.Where to begin, the three of us ordered. The bald headed Indian looking guy with the bread came round, he automatically served both London colleagues the sliced bread, didn't offer the choice of the other two kinds.  I asked him what the other two kinds were, he struggled to get the words out, lacked energy and dynamism. A real contrast to the energetic beings through the looking glass skating around. He served one small olive oil bowl between the three of us and clumsily dripped it onto the table. It would be nicer if came round a second time and gave each person their own bowl, especially as I'm cautious of the double dippers and it turned out one of my colleagues did do this.All three of us ordered burgers of various kinds. Every single one looked unappetizing. both colleagues commented on how sorry they looked. We tried the french fries, cold and over seasoned. It was as though the chef's hand slipped with the salt shaker. A colleague asked the server for vinegar for his chips as Brits call them. She was blank, had never heard of vinegar, the three of us tried to explain various types. She still wasn't clearer but would ask chef. On her return advised they do not keep vinegar. Now for an upscale place am surprised they don't have. Cold burgers and over salty chips, well if anyone wants to get high blood pressure or a salt induced heart attack we know the place.We were offered dessert but we just wanted out of there.

4.0,9/10/2016,"Rock Center Cafe, which doubles as the famous ice-skating rink during the winter, has been on the to-do list for quite some time.  Last night, I finally made it happen.  The outdoor dining is likely a big sell for this place under the right conditions.  Last night, though moderately hot and humid, wasn't unbearable because the was a nice breeze.  We were seated quite close to the famous gold Prometheus fountain/statue.  The noise level permitted normal conversational effort (no screaming to hear each other).  Service was polite, attentive, and precise. Our glasses never ran dry.  We had the watermelon and heirloom tomato salad for starters.  It was cool and dressed with balsamic vinegar and feta.  This was spot on and quite the treat on a warm night.  For our main dish, I selected the garganelli with shrimp which was bathed in a delicious and zesty saffron butter sauce and wilted arugula (not my favorite green but, I efficiently ate around it).  Supposedly, there were English peas in there somewhere, though I never spotted one.  My dining partner ordered the RCC Chef's Burger. This was accompanied by some pretty good fries but, I we both agreed that the real star of the show was the bacon aioli.  This stuff was like the nectar of the gods.  Put it on your burger.

1.0,8/9/2016,"My 1 star review is a result of watching how terribly the staff is treated. We were sitting by the bar, lucky enough to be one of the only tables covered by a roof during a fleeting rain storm. Watching the staff during the rain was actually pretty impressive since they had to scurry to get people their checks/continue serving drinks and rescue menus as it down poured on them and never seemed annoyed. So we continued to sit and enjoy our drinks as the place emptied, when a manager appears out of nowhere and starts screaming at our waitress right there in font of everyone. I have no clue what it was about but the poor girl hadn't stopped working and even if there had been another issue,  it's never professional to do it in front of guests. Then as the other waitress, who we had also watched continue to serve guests in the rain, came to the bar to get her drinks, the same manager gets in her face and goes off. It was really sad to watch the attitude of the whole staff change with his presence. The servers and bartenders looked miserable while he was around and we just felt bad for them, which made us no longer enjoy being there. This isn't the type of place I'd normally read or write a review for. It's Rockefeller Center, it's expensive, it is what it is. People complaining about prices can only blame themselves for going to a NY landmark. I'm glad someone else felt the need to say something about how management treats the staff. I don't know if it's the same guy or same day, but the lack of respect is clearly a problem and does affect the experience of the consumer.  I don't have any contacts and can't help with a lawsuit, but at the very least I hope my review earns those girls an apology and sheds light for upper management to see how their staff is treated. Bottom line, the drinks are expensive but it's a nice atmosphere and the staff is friendly and attentive as long as Mr. Crabs isn't running around red in the face and causing problems.",0,0,0,Erin W.,"Hermitage, TN",276,3,0

3.0,7/18/2016,"Food was mostly pretty good.  Service was pathetic.  The restaurant was not very busy when we arrived.  Probably 60% occupied.  When we entered the dining room, the not-so-fresh smell of fish was much stronger than it should have been. Although there were numerous servers nearby, after being seated, we waited 10 minutes for water or any acknowledgement from our server.  We never were offered bread until the dinner plates were being cleared.  When the busboy picked up our unused bread plates, he returned them to the stack of clean bread plates at his station.We all ordered the NY cheesecake for dessert, and it was dry and nearly flavorless.   We had asked for inside seating because of the intense July heat, but the servers propped the doors open, and the heat quickly overtook the dining room.  We asked that they close the doors, which they gladly did, but it only lasted a few minutes before they were again stuck wide open.  Ugh!We waited much too long for our check after finishing dessert.  There are far too many great restaurants in NYC for me to imagine that we will return to this one.",0,0,0,Friendly Curmudgeon I.,"Birmingham, AL",0,13,6

As we were leaving we peeked around the corner and sure enough there was a couple eating breakfast there. What was that all about??? Anyway, back to review...Service was somewhat slow but not too bad. The breakfast prices were reasonable for Manhattan. I had the 2 scrambled eggs with bacon. $15.00 It was good.

4.0,6/9/2016,"Recently went here for lunch, and dined outside on what is the ice skating rink in the winter. This place has a cool look and feel too it, and is a great spot to have a work lunch. I've eaten inside and outside here, and have to say I prefer outside. There's a large outdoor bar, high top tables, and regular tables. My buddy and I both each had two of the six point rock center cafe special edition beers, and they were perfect on a hot day. I was craving something healthy-ish, so I went for the chicken avocado wrap with a side salad. It was pretty good, a nice size. My buddy had the pork panini with fries, and he was stuffed after. The taste was great, as I grabbed a few of his fries. This place is pricy, but cmon its in rock center in NYC, of course the prices are going to be high.I really like coming here in the summer, walking down the famous staircase near where the tree is, and grabbing a table outside near the fountains in the ice skating rink. We made a reservation, but we didn't need one, there was plenty of space available outside as the restaurant is pretty big. I've never been here for dinner, but I imagine it's just as good.One strange thing, the entrees came out within about 4 minutes of us ordering them, and they were so not busy that day that the waiter kept coming by asking us if we needed anything. I'm all for attentive service, but this was a bit much, and I wondered if the sandwiches were pre made when they came out so fast. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but I'm skeptical when it's this fast. I remember having the cheesecake at a business lunch one time, and it was huge and delicious. This is pretty much my go to summer lunch spot. If it's really hot though, consider sitting inside, we were both sweating the whole lunch on a 90 degree day when we went.",2,0,0,Matt F.,"Rockville Centre, NY",4,138,70

But then again any alcoholic beverage in the a.m. is great. Ordered the All American breakfast which came with bacon, egg, and hash. Their hash is something I have never had before, definitely a shocker. Doesn't look all that great but once you taste it is definitely amazing.  I highly recommend it if your unsure on what to order.

3.0,3/23/2016,"Hostess (1 star): Nothing says ""Welcome to a nice dining establishment at Rockefeller center"" like a unhappy, angry, sour face & attitude! My co-workers and I were hosting interviews during a few weekday lunches and made reservations at the Rock Center Cafe. We had a reservation under the name of our HR team. When we arrived and told the hostess the name, she sourly replied ""someone has already taken that reservation."" Okay... we explained to her there were probably many reservations under her name and she said ""No."" Look. This place was empty when we came at 11:45. EMPTY. I don't care if you lost our reservation, we had one, and give us any empty table. After a few more minutes of huffing at at the computer and rolling her eyes, and angry looks, she finally got a waiter to take us over and sit us down. We were literally in ""WTF- is- going- on"" mode. This place is empty. Get it together, hostess, this is your job. Fake it.Service (1-2 stars): Shattered plates, waiters/waitresses standing around, and for a relatively empty place, incredibly slow service. The complimentary bread didn't even come to us until after our 2nd appetizer in. I didn't want it, but it should have been a little more consistent with the other tables around us. You would think a restaurant with so many servers to give you apps, main plates, and drinks (no seriously, I think we had a different server every time someone came to our table), someone would have a smile. No, they all looked miserable. Halfway through our meal one older waiter completely shattered plates on the ground next to us and he didn't even flinch. Again...what the heck was going on, since we were sure as heck were completely startled. Food (3 stars):Caramelized Goat Cheese ($20): 5 stars. I am a huge fan of goat cheese and this dish was absolutely delicious. While the picture might not do justice, the caramelized top was perfect and the cheese underneath was soft. There's just something satisfying about cracking through caramel. The salad to the left was tossed in a light dressing and also great on its own.Pesto Shrimp Crostini ($18): 5 stars. Again, Rock cafe kills it with their apps. This is the second time I've gotten this app and each time it's delicious. The shrimp tastes very fresh and when it is tossed in the pesto, it is a perfect combination of flavors. The only thing I can say is that the dish will only make you want to eat more. I mean just look! The dish itself is beautiful. Sirloin Steak Salad ($28): 2 stars. Meh...When the dish came out I could tell it wouldn't be very good. The steak had a weird rubbery texture, and no normal grill marks. It looked like it was baked for a bit in an oven, and much of the steak had fat at the sides. The wedge lettuce looked a bit wilted and was not crisp. The salad was a huge let down after great appetizers, since isn't very hard to make. SKIP.The others at the table didn't enjoy their main meal as much as the appetizers ether. None of us got the sandwiches because let's face it you can get a great sandwich at a lot of places in the city. Atmosphere/Location (5 stars): All in all, I believe the Rock Cafe has an amazing location and the space itself is beautiful and well kept. The floor is spacious and bright, the tables are clean, and it feels like a great business lunch/dinner area. During lunch, there was a ice skating performance going on and during the winter time the rink is always open to the public. The clientele is usually people wearing business casual as opposed to tourists walking in (at least every time I go).Overall: I would never dine here on my own dime.

I did feel it was a little dark though. Our server was awesome. We had the chefs burger and the calamari to share. The burger and fries was actually served on two separate plates without even asking. The calamari was placed in between us for easy access. The portions are healthy and we still had some fries and a lot of calamari left. Spring Rosè sangria and two heinekens for about 75$.

3.0,3/12/2016,"I'm very happy that I did not have to pay full price for anything we ate at the Rock Center Cafe since I purchased a skating package that included 'tea service' for four. We walked up and checked in for our 3:30 pm reservation before the 4:30 ice skating session.  We were seated rather promptly and we were one of two tables occupied in the entire right half of the restaurant.  After a few minutes' wait, our drink orders were taken and the tea service was brought out.  The tea service was composed of a three-tiered presentation with tea sandwiches at the top, sweets in the middle, and scones / cookies on the bottom tier.  Pretty standard setup.  The quality, however, was what I would expect from a Starbucks (no offense to Starbucks).  Basic, seemingly prepackaged items hastily laid out on the tiers.  There were four triangles each of cucumber and PB&J tea sandwiches.  The pastries, brownies, and such were boring.  If they told me any of the baked items were made in house, I would ask to see the oven because I wouldn't believe it.Then the wait.  Thirty minutes (yes, thirty minutes) passed without anyone coming by to check on us.  I had to get up, flag down the manager and ask what to do.  His response was that we were down so we were free to go and skate whenever we wanted.  Hmm - I guess since the 18% gratuity was already tacked onto the entire bill that I paid two weeks prior, they didn't have to work for it....All in all, not terrible for the price, $45 per person for tea service, skating, and skate rentals.  That would put the tea service at about $10-15 per person.  You get what you pay for.",1,0,1,David K.,"Austin, TX",423,153,207

Then provide an ice bucket and water; got the former (ice), but not the latter (water).I'd be a bit paranoid in returning.  This was supposed to be a fine dining experience, I don't think it can be classed as such.I have recently been contacted by the general manager (Allan Beardslee) to provide either my personal e-mail address or my telephone number.  I have replied with the former on the 2nd March, but no further response.  Is it because I am in the UK?  I don't know.Look.  I cannot attribute anything else to the problem I encountered, and it is always difficult with regards to these things, but I have to give it how I see it.",1,0,0,Peter M.,"Redditch, United Kingdom",9,226,57

5.0,1/5/2016,"Wanted to treat my fiancé to the best 30th birthday ever. We came to NYC all the way from London, England so needed a great venue for dinner and Rock Center Cafe certainly didn't disappoint. My fiancé can be very fussy when it comes to food so after spending hours researching back in the UK I chose this venue on account of the views of the ice rink and the good looking good. Booking online was quick and easy and I had confirmation within minutes. On arrival we were greeted by friendly hosts and shown to our table. The view of the rink was stunning and provided much entertainment as we watched over confident skaters try to perform a trick before falling over! The decor at the venue was well presented and made for a warm and comfortable atmosphere.Our server for the evening was Christine. She was friendly enough to be personable but not to the point of being irritating. Attentive enough to make sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our meals but not to the point of being intrusive. Knowledgeable enough to help us with our questions but not pushy towards certain dishes at all. She even allowed us to take a bit of a gap between our entrees and our sweets to allow our stomachs to recover. We certainly felt welcome and able to take our time without any pressure to release the table for another guest.The food was excellent. The appetisers (beet salad and clam chowder) were sublime - I'm going to have to try and recreate that salad at home when I start my diet! The Salmon and Chicken breast entrees were cooked to perfection. Deliciously moist meat with crispy skin, and portion sizes just right (and as an Englishman I do sometimes struggle with American portion sizes!) for afters I had the New York Cheesecake (hey if I've come all this way I can't not!) and my fiancé had the chocolate mouse. I would eat either again. Oh and if you don't try the roast cauliflower or the Sprouts then you've missed out.Whilst eating I noticed the manager spending time talking to guests asking how their experience was. It's nice to see such attentiveness and appreciation for customer views.Would certainly recommend coming back here - Whilst there is a price tag attached to eating here, every cent was worth it, and was certainly a fitting end to a busy 30th birthday for my fiancé.",1,0,0,Luke T.,"Croydon, United Kingdom",3,9,0
1.0,1/4/2016,"My family eats here every year when we visit the tree. We never make reservations before hand, and we never mind waiting. We are just very spontaneous. We understand that we will have to wait because of that. We are always okay with it. On Sunday, January 3, around 3:45 I went into the restaurant to speak to the hostess. The hostess I had the issue with was young, frizzy curly brown dyed hair, and I believe she had braces (I could be wrong on that detail.)  I had asked her if I could make a reservation of 8, and she said that it was not in their reservation policy. Which is 100% understandable. She also said they would not be seating anyone until 4. Which is also 100% understandable. I had her how long the wait would be if we put our name down, and she told me that she does not know whatsoever as their were parties ahead of us. Which is again agreeable, you can't just walk into a fine dining establishment without a reservation and expect to be seated right away. When I asked her to take my parties name down she refused.  She claimed that she could not write down our reservation until the computer opened up at 4. There were multiple other parties around waiting to be seated. I asked her if should could write down our name anywhere so that another party would not cut in front of us since she had not written anything down. Pretty much every question I asked her she said I don't know, and was insanely rude about it. My father walked in less than 2 minutes later.

We were not seated until about 20 minutes after our reservation time, which I guess I can understand, as I requested a good view and they had to wait on that to become available. The problem I had was that the hosts kept telling anyone that walked up and asked how much longer ""one more minute, you are the next to be sat."" Which obviously was not true - how can everyone be the next to be sat? And in ""one more minute""??  This resulted in a lot of angry (hangry) and grumbly patrons.

With that said, I came in on Friday at 11PM after having dinner and seeing a show in the Theater district with some out of town family. The place was buzzing, but not crowded. Lots of seating at the bar, at the high top tables as well as the dining tables. My mom can't sit at a high top or bar stool because of her back, so we attempted to sit at 1 of the many empty tables near the bar, but were told we could not unless we were ordering entrees. Again, it was 11pm, no chance we were ordering entrees at this hour. That is completely unreasonable to force on customers! We said we would order dessert and cocktails. Still, we were not allowed to sit at the tables. We were told that due to shortage of servers they could not seat us at a table and we had to sit at a high top. The high top was no more than 3 feet from the regular table. This seemed like the most absurd ""rule"" and completely unnecessary.

So I guess, 90% of the choice to go to this restaurant is about location, location, location!   The service is unparalleled, I think it actually improved from the last time I dined; you do feel like you're in an upper echelon eatery and the waitstaff is incredibly attentive.

But when you're going to charge $15 for a small bowl of lobster bisque (without any signs of lobster) and $5 for mediocre coffee, at least make people happy with your service.Major fail. I hate not tipping. I really wanted to leave a tip. But out of principle, when service was not given, no tip is deserved. I worked in restaurant service- I understand there can be bad days, but this is completely unprofessional and avoidable. Sadly, for the 2nd time in my life, I did not tip.",1,0,0,Huong V.,"Oakland, CA",227,219,150

I made reservations one week in advance for my boyfriend's birthday and had requested a table by the window to watch the ice skating. They informed me they do not guarantee specific tables. When we arrived we asked again to sit at the open table by the window BUT they told us we could not sit at because it was reserved for someone else. WHAT? It made no sense. We chose to wait for the next open table by the window despite having reservations and a request for a window seat. Once seated, we were not greeted by a waiter, THE ENTIRE TIME! We were served by random rude and overworked busboys or the hostess. We had to waive down a rude waiter to get the check at the end of the night. We ate off the restaurant week menu which was a huge disappointment. The lobster bisque had no lobster meat or real flavor, the pasta dish was cold and fell flat and the cheesecake dessert had no crust. How do you not have a crust bottom to a cheesecake?

It's $13 a la carte and I can't imagine anyone accepting this soup for so much. Just skip it.The salmon was really well cooked, but tasted horribly. It was tasteless - like I'm not sure if this place knows that salt is the greatest mineral ever - but they should probably utilize it a little more. Btw, this dish comes with a bowl of kidney beans underneath that tastes straight out of a Goya can.  Not only was it disgusting, but again, another cold dish.I'm so glad for the chocolate praline dessert because it was so subtle and delicious - thank god for their pastry chef!

3.0,8/8/2014,"I am basing my rating on the location and pricing. Higher expectations need to met and they weren't fully met.Let me start with the ambience, because the ambience is absolutely beautiful and stunning. The atmosphere of the outside seating is perfect a night out, and especially for a date. You have a stunning fountain and currently an interesting bush sculptured design. I honestly forgot for a second that I was in New York City.We ordered appetizers to start dinner off. The Summer Garden Signature Guacamole and Mediterranean Garden Dips were ordered. Let me start with the guacamole, the chips were good but the guacamole was missing flavor. My friend's brother thought it was amazing, but the rest of the table felt like it needed at least some salt and pepper for flavor. However, it did taste fresh and I usually don't mind touching it up, but a table shouldn't have to when charging how much they are charging. The Mediterranean Garden Dips had it's perks, but it had it's cons. The hummus was okay, it was good, but it wasn't the best I've had. The baba ganoush was good, it was missing flavor, but I was able to appreciate it. The tzaziki was good, but the flavor of tzaziki wasn't exactly there. The pita bread that came with the appetizer was amazing! I loved the flavor, and the texture and consistency was just right.The entrees left a better taste in the mouth! I am unable to remember each individual dish that was ordered, but they did please the table. I ordered a Shaved Steak Panino, and I was very pleased with it. I enjoyed the flavor, the texture and it was made righteously. The fries were good too, but I feel like an orientation towards home style fries would work really well with the sandwich. It is pricey, but I'm sure it's based on location and ambience. However, the output should be as equal as the ambience as well, in my opinion.

I was so eager to try this place out but left disappointed with only a relatively large bill in hand and still very hungry.I'm not one to complain about portions as I usually eat less since I tend to get fuller faster - usually bagging half or more of my order with me home - but when an entree along with a side leaves me rather starved in the end, then it's definitely not me. The entree was bland and very oily that at times I felt like I was eating a puddle of olive oil. Service was alright for lunch time but was on the more-than-usual slow side (looking around the restaurant, it wasn't busy - tons of empty seats inside and many people leaving their table outside). We weren't checked up on until the end - not about how everything tasted but if we wanted to get dessert. There's a big chance I won't be back for another bite here.

I ordered a simple burger and it was the worst burger ive ever eaten in my life for $28. Bun was soggy, Fries was already cold, meat was tasteless. My sister ordered the steak with potato and she said it tasted more like fried steak coz of the fat on it. We also had the guacamole with nacho and the same, mediocre.

The hostess staff was friendly and inviting but unfortunately the warmth ended there.  The wait staff was across the board rude - whether waiting on a neighboring table or just out and about in the restaurant - we've never experienced such a universally hostile service staff that was not part of their mission; a la Waffle House or Medieval Mannor.    The food was expensive, which is fine if the food is great, but the Rock was fair to poor, making this a stop to leave off our list.  The suckling pig was dry and bland, brussel sprouts were hard and not remotely close to el dente.  The crab cake was passable but on a lake of mustard and small for the price. The sirloin was good and the chicken dish rose to fair, but the side portions were laughable.   The kids dishes were actually better eating than the adult food - but at a fixed $25 per, it's hard to justify.  The grilled cheese and fries, for example, was great at 7.99 - $10.99 but at $25 it's outlandish.  At the Rock, you pay for the novelty of watching the Rockefeller skating not the quality of food or service.  In our case, we got the hefty bill without the view.",0,0,0,Steven P.,"Fairhaven, MA",4,8,5

4.0,3/13/2013,"Perhaps it's because I went in with much lower expectations after reading the other reviews here, but I was very pleasantly surprised at our experience here. As most have noted, the location is spectacular, especially if you come during the winter. The restaurant is literally on the side of the Rockefeller Center ice rink, meaning that as you're in the warmth enjoying your meal you can gawk at the skaters making their way around the rink. Every now and then you'll be treated to a show-off doing triple lutzes and salchows, and more often you'll be treated to various forms of wipeouts by newbie skaters. Thankfully, there's about two feet of concrete separating the restaurant window from the skating rink, so your meal won't be interrupted by a wayward skater slamming against the glass. The menu choices are decidedly limited; if you're vegan or vegetarian I didn't see much on the menu for you except for maybe a soup or an iceberg wedge. On the other hand, meat-eaters have a choice of options: on the night we went there was salmon, duck, chicken, pork chops, fish and chips, and seafood pasta or salad. There were also a few steak options. An ""NY"" icon next to the menu indicated that the ingredients were locally sourced from New York state farms, breweries, wineries, and seafood providers, which I found was a nice touch. Although strangely, the only steak on the menu that wasn't from New York was the New York Strip Sirlion.My first impressions weren't great. They brought out the bread, which consisted of a wheat roll, two hard rolls, and two dinner rolls. The dinner rolls were a bit crusty and ice cold, making me wonder how long they've been sitting around. But our server was excellent. He was friendly and genuinely seemed happy to be there and serving us. We mentioned to him in passing that we were in a bit of a rush, and he accommodated us by taking our order quickly, and bringing the food out quickly. I went with the duck, while my wife went with the Calamarata Pasta. Now I've been in other ""restaurants with a view"" in New York where the food was simply embarrassing. But I was pleasantly surprised. The duck (from La Belle Farm, no less), was fresh, tender, and had an excellent taste. The duck itself wasn't overly seasoned, letting that fresh flavor come through. A sweet and lightly tangy brown sauce that paired very well with it. It came with Brussels Sprouts that weren't prepared in the usual ""I'll have some Brussels sprouts with my salt"" way, but actually had excellent flavor, that went well with the crisp onions and the sauce for the duck. My wife's pasta was surprisingly light in flavor, but the seafood was surprisingly fresh. The mussels were huge, and the shrimp had that fresh ""snap"" you always look for. All the seafood had that sweetness that's distinctive in fresh seafood. Again, the seasoning was subtle and not overpowering, with a tinge of herbs and lemon.  The restaurant itself was about half full. Even though there were people all around us, we could have a pleasant conversation without shouting. We got a kick out of the couple sitting by the window who were enjoying their meal while their kids were skating outside and from time to time would stop by the railing and interact with their parents. I'm not sure if we came on a good night or if this is the way it always is, but I we definitely enjoyed our experience. Both of the entrees were home runs with us. Our server couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. And perhaps because we're coming in February, we were spared from the maddening crowds that swoop down on Rockefeller Center between November and January.",1,0,0,Steve L.,"Great Neck, NY",107,128,2

The Bloody Mary:  I tasted no vodka at all.  Tomato juice was watery.  The large appetizer salad was a bunch of greens, many too large to eat without cutting (cutting lettuce??) heaped on the plate with some kind of dressing which had sugar in it.  The Amish Country chicken leg and tiny breast looked very old and was dry as a bone and tasteless (Whole Foods and Food Fair make very tasty, juicy grilled chickens),  I won't go on.  Well,  maybe two more items.  I thought maybe the dessert would be better but I sent back  the Deep Dish Apple pie drowned in cinnamon.  If you like cinnamon, fine; if not, oi!  The espresso?  Bitter.  Bitter.

The other problem I had with the breakfast was the coffee.  They serve their coffee french pressed.  Now, I love french pressed coffee and I think it is the best way to brew coffee.  The problem, however, is the press they served couldn't have contained more than 10 ounces of coffee.  When I am enjoying a leisurely breakfast I enjoy my coffee and like to have about 3 cups over the course of an hour.

2.0,11/29/2012,"This place can be summed up in one timeless expression.... mediaserver.pulse2.com/u…(Thank you, McKayla Maroney)!!I came here the other night during the pre-tape tree-lighting ceremony with my sister.  We really needed to escape the bone-chilling cold after standing outside for over 2 hours, first waiting for Mariah Carey, and then watching her perform two songs.  As much as we heart MC, I couldn't hack the cold any longer as my feet were frozen and thisclose to being frost bitten.  (I do adore Mariah, but I also didn't want to lose any toes in the process of standing outside in the cold).  We chose to dine at Rock Center Cafe to thaw out our cold bones, and catch glimpses of Mariah perform a few additional songs for the crowd.  Initially, I was impressed with this space.  It is on the ground floor and adjacent to the ice rink.  You can see everything going on in the rink with no visual obstructions, and it's a great option to people watch and a nice way to obtain some holiday spirit in the process by way of osmosis.  The decor is a fine contemporary mixture of furniture, lighting and minimalist and modern artwork.  But then, all goes pretty much downhill from there.First, we were greeted by the snotty, blonde, ice princess (and I don't mean that in a good way) who proved to be a very poor example of a hostess.  She wasn't welcoming at all and didn't even smile once.  (I saw the coat room, but she didn't bother to ask if we wanted to leave our coats there).  We ordered from the dinner menu (which btw, is pretty pricey), and got a few appetizers and sides.  The crab cake was tasty, though I bit onto a hard piece of cartilage, which has never happened to me before.  The mac-n-cheese was really bland, and the calamari was soggy.  I had to salt and pepper everything expect the crab cake.  But the biggest offense was the food temperature.  I saw the heat lamp at the pass, and figured, we'd be given warm food, but no, the food was almost as cold as the ice princess hostess.  It came as a shock.  I didn't think a swanky place like this would serve bland, cold food.  Horrendous.The only glimmer of hope was found in the spread that they give you with the dinner rolls.  It's a salty and creamy tahini-like mixture, and it's fantastic.  Also, our waiter was really on-point and we appreciated his attention and service.I guess Rock Center Cafe need not try too hard to make her customers happy as this is a revolving door for tourists and business meetings.  Clearly, I made two mistakes that night, 1) standing in the freezing cold for 2 hours, and 2) spending a dime at this lackluster restaurant.  Never again.",2,3,2,Jennifer C.,"Elmhurst, NY",559,645,1350

1.0,10/11/2010,"Do not go here if you are trying to save money ie:a tourist running low from doing expensive tourist stuff they overprice especially for you guys around ny OR if your an employee of cheapass salary anthropology and just getting off her hellish shift helping you tourists and is starving!!! Because that's what I just did and man do I regret it!! I always pass here and everywhere else around the concourse on my break and I love the area. Looking down and out at the tourists sitting on the concourse and down in the cafe in the rink while your working gets very lonely so I had been longing to try out the place they all seem to flock to. Downstairs in the concourse period has lots of great food spots to go to on my budget and all the workers are friendly in them! But nooo today I was dressed well enough to sit in a nice restaurant with the tourists and have sum dinner before I hopped on the train. So I checked the sea grills menu first. Didn't have a great variety for just one girls needs for a quick filling but special sit down. Plus they are really expensive!! Not saying I'll never try them but Id rather with someone. So I went into the rock and was seated at a table for just me. I had looked at their menu before and knew they had refreshing looking appetizers like cold soups n shrimp cocktail with creative sauces so they I figured would be more up my alley. My waiter came immediately and was on time with the bread and water. The bread came with some olive type spread that was descent,no big deal just descent. I didn't finish it. I asked the waiter about a few dishes and he gave some info but 2 different times a noticed he kept trying to get me to try some of the pricier dishes!? I was sticking to the budget I had in my head,nothing over 17 so I had the fusilli w shrimp and had a tomato soup appetizer. I only ordered an appetizer bc of other reviewers saying their order took long to come out-it did. The tomato soup I ordered was a cold one thst was supposed to come with creme fresh on it. It instead had a small amount of some green cream swirled on top that tasted bad-like peas and sour milk? I dunno just weird and not agreeing with my palate. The soup was reallly salty and I like salt a lot but this was too much salt I think for a cold refreshing soup. It had a few drizzles of olive oil on it too. I give it a C. Now the shrimp fusilli. Ew!!?? I submitted a pic just take a look. It had skinny fusilli which I wasn't expecting but it was ok. The issue was the greasiness and the sour taste of the sauce. Like too much tomato prescence even though there were like 4 tomatoes. It was really sour and weird. The shrimp were of though,5 descent size big ones so there shrimp cocktail must be good. For just me:Lemonade,tomato soup appetizer,shrimp fusilli=45.63 before tip!!!!!! Ridiculous!!!I should have did my usual and gone to pret a manager where I would have gotten something much cheaper and healthier to! If I ever come back I will....nah I'm never going back. And my waiter was creepy. Everytime I looked up to take a bite I could see him staring at me from the darker part of the restaurant. Weird. There was a drunk Spanish or European woman emmasculating some lover of hers on the phone for everyone 5 of us in the restaurant to hear. Something about how he isn't a man. I picked a good evening to yelp about this place I thought listening to her.",0,0,0,lovelyd k.,"New York, NY",33,25,3

We were seated indoors as the outdoor patio tables with umbrellas were full. But a table along the window suited just fine so we could still admire the gorgeous weather going on outside.We were greeted by a friendly server, delicious looking bread basket and water. For the table, we had an order of calamari yelp.com/biz_photos/Ropt… . Crispy and tender, with a delightful dipping sauce that added a good kick. Our lunch entrees included the chopped shrimp salad with crispy wontons yelp.com/biz_photos/Ropt… , the crab and risotto cakes yelp.com/biz_photos/Ropt… , turkey sandwich (not pictured) and the ginormous cheeseburger yelp.com/biz_photos/Ropt… .The chopped shrimp salad was pretty good, though perhaps slightly overdressed. The dressing was quite vinegar-y but full of flavor. Mom ate almost all of her salad, I ate most of it but toward the end, ate all of the good bits and left the remaining lettuce. My dad scarfed down his turkey sandwich with no complaints. My friends split the burger yelp.com/biz_photos/Ropt… and crab/risotto cakes and completely devoured them both. While I didn't get a bite of the burger due to the fact they ate it all, I did get to sample the crab/risotto cake. It was pretty heavy but had healthy portion of crab in there so it wasn't all rice. The accompanying watercress salad definitely helped cut down the heaviness of the cake but when it's your (my cousin's) birthday and you're pigging out - these thoughts quickly escape your mind.By the end of the meal and at least one watermelon mojito yelp.com/biz_photos/Ropt… later, we were way too stuffed for dessert. When the bill to be signed was returned with my dad's credit card, we definitely appreciated that the server noted on there that the gratuity was already added.

Ran across Rock Center Cafe trying to navigate our way from St. Patrick's to our hotel after mass on Sunday morning. The Puerto Rican Day parade forced us into Rockefeller Center and we figured brunch here couldn't be any worse than eating at the hotel. We were seated immediately owing to the fact that it was only 10am. I wish we hadn't missed the opening of the bar by two hours, but oh well. Our waiter, Scott, was very friendly and attentive. My iced tea never dipped below half-full before I had a fresh glass. He also ensured that my pancakes came without hazelnuts as I am allergic to them. The pancakes were delicious buttermilk style - thick, yet fluffy. We also enjoyed a fresh fruit plate with honey-yogurt which was a perfect accompaniment. I like that they serve you an assortment of small breads - fresh rolls, croissant, and muffins with raspberry jam. The atmosphere was lovely for an early Sunday morning in summer with the warm sun and light spray from the fountain.

(Her still being not our real waitress but the one who was kind enough to help her out)-A nice man brought out our food about 10 minutes after we got our drinks.  Presentation was fantastic, taste was mediocre.-After our dishes were cleared and the wonderful bus boys had refilled our water twice more (we are talking 20 minutes after we were finished) our real waitress finally shows up (she really DOES exist!)  She meekly asks us if there is anything else she can get us (not that she got us anything... all evening!) and when we ask for the check it takes another ten minutes for her to retrieve it.  -Overall, a bad experience.  I left pissed about how much  we had just spent for what we received.Go somewhere else!",2,0,0,Megan C.,"Seattle, WA",132,283,14

3.0,2/19/2008,"It was pouring when we came, so everyone moved indoor. It's nice to be eating on the ice-skating rink, and the fries that came with our burger were surprisingly good. The burger was not juicy enough, but it seemed to be the most popular thing to order for lunch, especially among tourists who didn't intend to spend too much on food.

3.0,2/11/2008,"Came here with family this past weekend after touring Rockefeller Center. The decor was nice - elegant and cozy at the same time, and the slightly snobby hostess was balanced out by our super friendly waiter. The food was good overall, but overpriced. The crab and risotto cakes were nice, with big chunks of crab, but heavily battered. The polenta fries that came with it turned out to be 3 small rectangular logs of polenta - so tasteless I didn't finish them. The dish definitely didn't justify the $30 price tag. I also had the calamari appetizier, served with creamy aioli - tasty, but didn't really stand out.The best part of this place is watching the little kids wobbling around the ice rink - faceplants are inevitable! - not the food.",1,0,1,Gloria C.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,33,0

1.0,8/19/2007,"Again... I realize I have been complaining about all the tourists and the development of classic eateries into traps for those with terrible taste and worst manners but it has happened again.  I had a few hours to myself recently and convinced my very busy fiance to join me for a late lunch.  It is understood that tourists don't have fashion sense but do they all have to wear those God awful shirts and shorts?   As I was saying, we popped into the Rock for a late lunch and it was mobbed now what I didn't say is that my assistant, the best on the planet, put in a reservation for me.  I walked to the front of the line to tell the hostess that we had a reservation.  Her reply was that it didn't matter because all these folks were here before I had arrived.  I asked if they had reservations and she informed me, in the rudest manner, that they didn't but they were here before me.The manager heard this and apologized and I was seated quickly.  The problems continued with my order being screwed-up, twice and having to ask for an act of God to get another Whiskey.In short, the Rock was a nice place and someday when New York is no longer the top tourist attraction on the planet it will be again.",1,0,1,Edward Tj G.,"New York, NY",72,180,54
4.0,8/14/2007,"I know, all my reviews lately are ""3 star"" but I love this place.  It's nothing ""amazing"" but at the same time, in a city as potentially off-putting as New York, it is.. The bread is good (nice bread sticks, a few different types of bread in the basket - good rolls), the crab cakes are phenomenal (and I am a tough judge of crab cakes. These are the best or close to it that I have ever had. Good enough to go for alone? Heck yes!).  While the fish part of the 'seared daily fish' in the coconut ginger broth is as precarious as it sounds (I mean really, not every fish belongs in that), the sweet snap peas in the same sauce are delightful!  Also, the first time I went my mother had the BBQ dinner plate and everything on it was amazing and uniquely different. The chicken was sweet with a hint of spice - well flavored certainly, the ribs were succulent, and the shrimp were delightful and exotic. - all a win. The second time I went I had the 'crispy seared organic chicken' and while it was what you would expect - crispy fried (not breaded) chicken, it was only 'decent' - like 'home cookin' which certainly pleased me. I was however disappointed in what seemed like a not-at-all thought out ""roasted corn and smoked bacon hash"" which was not at all hash-like, and had not even a faint hint of bacon to it, and which did not make sense at all with the watermelon 'vinaigrette' - chunks of watermelon and potato do not co-exist. Even still, I enjoyed my meal very much. Maybe I was home sick and the comfort food was what I needed?  I also don't understand why people seem to dislike the decor here. I love it! Maybe you wouldn't enjoy it for a romantic evening out (though I certainly think you could) but I think the orange/red hues, dim lighting, cozy booths, and view of the outside bar (or even better - rink in winter) are terrific. I love that I work above this place and plan to make it a frequent dining/lunch spot.",1,0,0,Valerie J.,"Sheboygan, WI",152,296,3312

3.0,3/4/2007,"I went here today for brunch and had a basically good experience with a few complaints.  I ordered the lobster quiche.  It was pretty good, but not amazing.  Usually my favorite part of a quiche is the crust, and I ended up picking the filling out of this one.  It certainly was not worth the approximately $20 it cost.  I had major food envy when I saw what the two people across from me ordered - a sort of update of eggs benedict, basically hash browns, smoked salmon, poached eggs and  hollaindaise sauce.We were seated at one of the tables right next to the skating rink.  I imagine this would be really cool at night when there are lots of happy skaters or during the holiday season, when the tree is up.  However, I ended up with rink-side tickets to elementary school hockey practice.",1,0,1,Nancy H.,"San Antonio, TX",6,50,0
4.0,9/28/2006,"My last breakfast in NYC was spent here. I ordered the Poached Egg and Prime Rib Hash, my friend ordered the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict, and my other friend ordered Nutella & Banana Crepes. Everything was delicious - to me, anyway. We started with a plate of madeleine cookies served with our choice of honey or orange marmalade - fantastic. The steak in my hash was tender, and even though I could have done without all the globs of hollandaise sauce over everything, it did balance out the heaviness of the steak and potatoes. My friend's egg benedict was fantastic - it was the first time I tasted it with salmon and not something like Canadian bacon or spinach, and it came with what looked like a compressed hash brown cake. Our other friend didn't fare too well with his crepes because it seemed to be more Nutella than anything else, but as a lover of Nutella, I probably would've just asked for an extra glass of milk or something. But it wasn't my meal. On another note, I could have done without our server - polite and easy to talk to as she was - somewhat rushing us with our meal. I couldn't help feeling like there was this pressure to be out as soon as we were done eating (which probably came across because she set down our check way sooner than I anticipated), but as far as the food, everything was great. It would be nice to come back in winter so we could watch people ice skating as opposed to an under-construction pit!",0,0,0,Aivy C.,"Fremont, CA",662,1048,19
3.0,7/18/2006,"Stopped by the Rock Center Cafe for restaurant week and I was not disappointed ('cept for their decor)... until they started ushering people to the tables next to us; the food from the menu looked much more delectable than what we were given to sample from the prix-fixe courses.  Not to say our meal was bad, the food was well prepared (though my filet mignon was a little more cooked than I would have liked) and the service was impeccable.   The dessert was a little lacking, however; I had some strawberry based dessert and felt it was the only thing that was not above-average-- it tasted like it was premade in masses from the week before, the strawberries were extremely tart and sour. From the ""looks"" of it, I'd highly recommend the shrimp dish (photo pictured on their restaurant website) and their pasta comes in huuuge portions.  I'd loved to have sampled their very best from the menu for a higher price than a little bit of their above-average prix-fix menu, but I could be back again.",1,0,1,Amy Y.,"New York, NY",149,121,0
