5.0,5/1/2019,This is probably the best hidden secret in the city!! The food is amazing !!! I ended up having their truffle balls and flat bread . It came out literally so quick and so fresh .. also Valerie Valerie Valerie !!! I sat down at this busy bar and she immediately served me and never made me feel rushed ! Every question I had she answered and she made me feel like glass house should be my new spot!! I definitely will be back not only for the food and ambiance but Valerie or Michael have to be there!!!,0,0,0,Emily R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0
3.0,4/26/2019,"When I first entered in, it wasn't as noisy as other bars. The servers didn't really pay attention to us and just kept talking to each other... So we felt neglected. However the drink we got was pretty good (house wine sangria with fruits) and was in a big glass so I guess worth $15. The taste was a bit sour rather than on the sweeter end. Their cocktails menu seemed pretty limited...",0,0,0,Wendy T.,"Queens, NY",368,190,406
3.0,4/7/2019,"I give this 3 stars because of the exceptional service. The waiter and staff were very attentive making sure water was filled and plates were removed. I had ordered the poached eggs with spinach and prosciutto. The poached eggs were more like hard boiled eggs. The prosciutto was more like a garnishment, barely enough to even taste.  My husband got the chicken wrap.  Very bland.  Needed a sauce or dressing. Disappointed with the food, however the staff and front of the house Manager did his best to compensate with a chocolate dessert which was amazing.",0,0,0,Kim K.,"Prospect Park, Minneapolis, MN",23,15,5
3.0,3/29/2019,"I'm all about brunch as my restaurant meal of choice these days, and I love a good prix fixe. I brought some relatives to Glass House before a matinee, and it was...fine. I won't avoid it, but it's not a place I'm rushing to return to. The frittata was not a frittata at all-- it was just an omelette. A fine omelette, but not even close to a frittata. A frittata is a frittata because it has potato at the bottom and is finished in the oven. This was just eggs, whisked, and cooked on the stovetop. It came with a little side salad. The salmon was over cooked and dry. Personally, I would have sent it back, but my grandmother is 93 and very polite, so she just told the server and asked for some ketchup. You heard me, it was so mediocre that she put ketchup on it. The server brought ketchup, but never apologized that the fish was overcooked. The bread pudding and warm chocolate cake were both delicious. The coffee was standard. The service was super duper slow and rather uneven, but our server was friendly. The food was mostly brought out and cleared by other staff.",0,0,0,Liz K.,"New York, NY",314,244,1047
4.0,3/17/2019,Went here for brunch before a show. Food was pretty good. Crabcake was very good but I would have liked it to have a crispier crust. Service was very good but a little slow,1,0,1,Alexis M.,"Howell, NJ",0,16,7
4.0,3/15/2019,"I came here with a friend to partake in their pre fixe menu. The interior is expansive with bright yellow lights along the bar and striped orange, beige and brown booth seats. My friend was already there so upon entering, I was seated upstairs in cozy booth seating for two. The decor was classic and the ambiance was comfortable, as well as calm. There was less hustle and bustle in the upstairs dining area which was nice and made for a more intimate setting.For the first course I ordered the duck wellington which was wonderful! Portion wise, it was a decent size, especially for an appetizer. The crust was perfectly flaky, buttery and the duck was so very juicy and full of flavor. There was a bit of salad underneath with just the right amount of vinaigrette dressing.I had the Atlantic salmon for my entree. The salmon was cooked to a slight and delicious crispness, and placed on top of cous cous risotto with corn, along with blood orange and regular orange slice on top. The piece of salmon was on the small side, but was exquisitely made. The meat was delightfully tender, falling off easily and the accompanying sauce was soo good! The cous cous risotto was pretty tasty and had plenty of seasoning that satisfied the palette.The warm chocolate cake was absolutely divine! True to the name, this cake was indeed served warm. There was also berry sauce, blackberries and a sprinkling of powdered sugar on top, with a side of vanilla bean ice cream. The cake was incredibly chocolate-y, velvety smooth, rich and melted in my mouth! I even enjoyed the vanilla ice cream with it - Usually I'm not a fan of plain vanilla ice cream because I find it boring. This particular ice cream had the fresh vanilla taste and paired well with the chocolate cake. The berry sauce was a little too sweet though. Our waiter was great. He was welcoming, personable and easy to chat with. He brought everything out in a timely manner and knew the menu well. The menu is on the pricey side so I would only return if there was a special.",11,7,9,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",783,438,5876
5.0,3/7/2019,"My wife and I had dinner here after seeing Hamilton last night. We had a 530 reservation and they were accommodating when we showed up at 5pm. We got drinks first. If there was one complaint it was that my wifes drink wasn't strong enough. I had a Gin and Tonic which was fine. The food was great.I had a New York strip steak which was fantastic. My wife had Salmon which she enjoyed as well. It was my wifes birthday and they brought out a dessert with candle on the house! Service was great as well.

2.0,2/12/2019,"We went to glass house tavern with 11 girls for brunch before a show on Saturday.  We were seated right away and everything was really nice. I asked the waitress a few questions about the Mixners Crispy Chicken Salad. She said it would be no problem to switch the crispy fried chicken to warm grilled chicken.  While I was waiting my mom ordered the price fixed which came with a DELICIOUS salad to start. When my salad came it was so overdressed it was difficult to eat but I didn't send it back because I didn't want to make everyone late to the show.  My cousin sitting next to me said, that looks like it has too much dressing.  Also, my grilled chicken had a fishy taste. I was so grossed out. Everyone else loved their food.",1,0,0,Lina C.,"Glen Head, NY",1,2,0
3.0,2/2/2019,"We came here for brunch.  If you came early, they will seat you unlike other places.   If you saw the first floor you would think the restaurant is empty meanwhile everything is buzzing on the second floor.This is really a 3.5*.  The only issue is whatever was happening behind my booth seat.  The busboys have to put the used plates or items somewhere.  I am guessing it is behind me (forgot to look after I got up!) because at one point the loud bang behind me and my booth seat felt the vibration and my friend ask me what is going on besides the usually clanking of used plates, glasses/cups and utensils.We got a nice cozy booth.  The waitress gave us plenty of time to review the menu.  I got the cinnamon raisin brioche french toast with fruits.  My friend got an Eggs Benedict.  Everything was great.  It was a nice place to catch up with my friend.  The waitress checked in to see if we needed anything which is nice.Food was good.  Overall service was great.",1,0,0,Caroline N.,"Queens, NY",47,311,2697

4.0,1/13/2019,"Went with friends on a Saturday after seeing a show. We were seated promptly and courteously even though we were 15 minutes late for our reservation. They have a nice cocktail menu and i opted to try the house sangria. It was very refreshing, not too sweet as some sangrias can be. My friends shared a half bottle of wine which gave them barely a glass each so it must have been a small half bottle. When making them reservation we didn't realize they had a prix fixe dinner which is very reasonable and has a nice selection of items. So that was a pleasant surprise. We shared the pear salad (delicious) i ordered the crab cake( add $4) salmon with roast corn cous cous risotto (terrific) and warm chocolate ale with berries (yummy). Friends enjoyed their meals of filet mignon and cavatelli. We had a very leisurely meal, perhaps too leisurely as we ended up missing our train because we had to wait so long for our waiter to bring the check.",1,0,1,Kathy W.,"New York, NY",39,174,38

2.0,1/5/2019,"Walk 6 Blocks for Much Better FoodThe food in here is not offensive, but not very good either.  The menu is not creative and the execution is mediocre.  It's cruise ship food, basically, intended to appeal to a very broad clientele vacationing in NYC and lacking the motivation or courage to venture away from Times Square into parts unknown.You can do better, even in Times Square, but if you are willing to do a little research and walk 10 minutes in pretty much any direction, you'll find much better food for less money.On the plus side, you can probably get in here with very little notice, which can be useful but is telling.",1,0,0,Will G.,"Castle Rock, CO",16,14,0
2.0,1/2/2019,"The highlight of the evening was my Jumbo Lump Crab cake and my order of large Caesar salad. I work in the Midtown area almost everyday my work allows me travel. I have been here many times. The biggest issue that stands out this time?  The waitress she saw me ignored me on purpose. I should have called for the the manager - my mistake. I've noticed a large turnover on female staff over the years. The waitress can't recall her name her behavior was not okay or professional she was talking on her phone just to name a few issues :/ I usually reach out for someone else to handle this shyte but working and was on a business call and busy myself!

3.0,12/31/2018,"Very average spot to come for lunch/dinner in NYC, so 3 stars is pretty fitting for this place.  There's pros and cons which I'll get into.Pro-  Getting seated immediately after walking in, which in NYC is a blessing, down the street at Friedmans it was like an hour wait, for a party of two.Pro- The waitress was very sweet, and we were on a time clock cause we were seeing a show an hour and a half from when we sat down, she was very helpful in getting the food out, offering options, and just being a good waitress.Con-  The Eggs Benedict I got had no flavor, Hollandaise was like water, The Salmon that replaced the Ham felt old and fishy, not special, at all.Con- The Hot Chocolate was the worst I've ever had. It was also like water. And disgusting. A shame. DO NOT GET ITCon- I had 1 Mimosa, and it was 13 dollars...I didn't know they put Moet into the Mimosas, there are places that do Bottomless for that amount, horrible.Pro- The Bread Baskets and Baked Goods Basket were great. Good amount of Jam, Butter, Pastries, etc.  This spot would be good to go for Lite fare, like a meeting maybe, but not a full on brunch or lunch.Three Stars. Very Average. Can do Much Much better even down the block or around the corner. Place needs to step it's game up!!",0,0,0,Alex H.,"Los Angeles, CA",1161,224,238

It was the best pear salad I have ever had the pleasure of eating - and I've eaten a lot.

1.0,11/30/2018,"Just to preface this story-we live in the neighborhood and have been to glasshouse several times. Tonight, on a Friday evening, my wife and I walked hand in hand into the bar. The doorman (someone I didn't recognize) asked us for our ID's, which we provided. He asked us where we are coming from, to which we replied, ""well we live here."" He then said, ""did you come from a bar?"" We thought he must have thought we were tourists or something so we told him we came from another place in the area and brushed it off and walked to the bar. We had been to another bar but we certainly weren't drunk by any means. When my wife tried to order drinks/food, the bartenders told us they couldn't serve us because their boss felt we were drunk. They were apologetic and said,"" you guys seem fine, it's not our choice, but our boss said we can't serve you."" When I went to find him, he was no where to be found. I don't want to assume this, but it seems more like an issue with my sexual preference and less my level of intoxication.  It saddens me that in New York City and in 2018, I would encounter this at my local bar where my friends and I hang out so often, but I won't be back.",0,0,0,Ashley H.,"Torrance, CA",0,4,0

4.0,10/24/2018,"Four stars for the quick in and out before a show across the street! Honestly, that's why I picked it; it's right across the street from the Friedman Theater where we were seeing a play after dinner. The value of the 4 course prix fixe dinner was very good. Probably one of the less expensive meals I had while visiting the city. We were served quickly, and the drinks were very good! I had a jalapeno cilantro martini which was done perfectly, not too spicy and not too cilantro-forward. I had the salmon for my main course, and the couscous with it was really good! The salmon was just okay, could have used a little more seasoning. For dessert, we opted for the white chocolate breading pudding, and it was delightful! I think bread pudding is probably underrated as a dessert. It's hard to mess up, but I love it! Our booth was upstairs in the main dining area, and I liked the intimate nature of it. Don't forget to reserve online, and if you're celebrating a special occasion (we were celebrating our anniversary), mark it and you may get a fun surprise! ;) I would definitely come here again for a pre-show meal done well and with options that won't weigh you down while enjoying your show!",1,0,1,Libby B.,"Indianapolis, IN",158,509,2119

While there is seating downstairs, we opted to sit upstairs in the spacious dining room. The service was fantastic and the waiter was very knowledgeable and attentive. They offer a prix fixe lunch (menu attached), but it seemed like a bit too much food, so I opted for the burger and fries, which was solid. Not mind blowing, but good enough. They didn't have pepper jack (my favorite cheese), so cheddar had to suffice. The burger is served with sautéed onions which is normally a good thing, but there were a lot of them. My coworker went with a kale salad and the soup of the day which was tomato, fennel. All in all. A solid lunch experience. The only downside was that the resturant was freezing.

Looses a star for our service. Took our server forever to come to our table (not a good thing when you have a show to go to), so much so another server took our food order so we could eat on time. We decided on the set pre theater dinner. I started with the crab cake, while my husband chose the chicken risotto. Both were amazing. My crab cake was full of tender crab without the fillers that I am used to. Tasty without being overpowering, it paired really well with the ginger glass noodles accompanying it. My husband's risotto was lovely, fragrant with lemon and full broth. My husband was pleased with the amount of hearty pieces of chicken in it. Really generous portions for both. Onto the main courses. I chose the salmon while my husband chose the stuffed pork tenderloin. My salmon was amazing. Perfectly charred nestled in a  delicious corn/barley medley. My husband also loved his rather generous portion of pork and I loved the interesting paring of the mango salsa on top.   A combination that I didn't think would go well together seemed to work seamlessly. We both chose the Greek yogurt honey panna cotta. It was delicious. Rich and light at the same time with a smattering of walnuts on top. Really great meal to celebrate my 40th birthday.

We had 3 hours before our show and my husband is starving and I feel sick not wanting anything. After much decision making (like a 1/2 hour) I ordered corn chowder and my husband ordered a Cubano sandwich which came with perfect shoestring fries.  My chowder was probably really good and filling , but I was reluctant to eat to much given my condition. I did order wine and Veronica kindly brought out some crackers for me to nibble on. She also gave my husband a Guinness on her as she knew we didn't want to venture out in the rain.

Atmosphere is nice but nothing too memorable, same goes for their menu. Servers were friendly and for a ""fancier"" place the atmosphere was quite relaxedFor our meal my friend and I got the following:1) Atlantic Salmon over cous cous & corn w/ citrus and jalapeno: Salmon was cooked rare and the texture of the fish was the absolute highlight of the meal. It was my first time even considering that salmon didn't need to be cooked all the way through. Skin was crisp but needed a bit more seasoning as did the ""risotto"". The jalapeno and citrus worked well together but didn't integrate all that well into the rest of the dish. (3.75/5)2) Seafood paella: My friend's entree. It's not bad but not great either. They don't skimp out on the seafood for sure. I had a piece of calamari and a clam and quality wise they were fairly tender (well at least not rubbery). Portion was quite large, needed more spices. Overall you can find better out there.Overall, nothing quite impressed me flavorwise and for the price there's definitely many more options out there.

The drinks were good I ordered a lemon drop martini which came out tasty but without a sugar rum but the manager was really good about exchanging it. I also ordered a burger which I could've done without. The bun seemed like it has been sitting out for a period of time and the actual meat had no flavor. A complete waste. My sister in law ordered the shrimp ceviche that came with 2 pieces of shrimp. All in all they completely missed the ball. I probably won't be coming back to this restaurant. They left nothing to be desired.,0,0,0,Samantha J.,"Westbury, NY",3,37,159

5.0,4/1/2018,"Bottom line: Great pre-Show dinner, with fantastic food and service.The Story: Stopped here before my wife's birthday present, seeing Hamilton on Broadway. The staff there welcomed us warmly, even though we called and said we were stuck in traffic.  ""We're glad you called, and your table is ready for you now."" And what a nice table it was too. Proper silverware and table settings. Our ten year old daughter got a proper lesson in a first class prix fix meal. Wife started with first rate Cesar salad, and my risotto was equal to the task. Adding a half bottle of Duckhorn merlot was easily done.When the mushroom Bolognese came, I was in my happy place. The taste was worth the price, (and calories!) - as it was first class service all the way. Dessert of bread pudding closed out the meal, while my wife's chocolate cake met all her expectations. In short, nothing was amiss. Server earned a nice tip, and I would happily return for a meal or drink at the bar.

Caprese salad, grilled salmon with roasted corn/cous-cous and white chocolate bread pudding. The salad was fresh with delicious components like roasted garlic and lemon zest. The salmon had a bright flavor with the sweetness of the corn. The dessert was meh, but honestly, I didn't have much room for it. Chris had the tomato soup and wedge salad (both apps). The dressing needed flavor. His entree was the filet (cooked perfectly), Parmesan mashed potatoes and pickled carrot spirals. The carrot was a surprise, but added a welcome bite of acid.

Proximity was probably the most important thing. So when it came to dinner time, I had my fingers crossed that the food would be good. After all, I was entertaining clients and didn't want to look bad, right? We arrived 15 minutes early and were sat immediately even though only half our group was there. Our table was right under the a/c and created really cold chairs (we were all dressed up in fancy Summer dresses with open backs and the chairs were made of metal, so it felt freezing); we asked if it could be turned down, and it was resolved immediately. Then when presented with the menu, everything sounded just as great as I hoped. I ordered the crab cakes and while surprised that only one arrived on my plate, it was the best I ever had, so who cares? [don't offer to share this dish!] There were 14 of us and the bill came in under $1000. Factors that made it more affordable was that there was only 2 rounds of drinks and one bottle of wine purchased (and that was Champagne), so I was very happy with my investment.I will definitely be treating my clients here again when I am in NY!",2,0,0,catherine k.,"Galena, IL",593,26,102

It is very close to the theater where 'waitress' is showing, so we decided to have lunch here prior to our matinee. I had the mushroom barley soup and it was fantastic. It is a broth-based soup with plenty of mushrooms and other vegetables. My husband had the chicken Bacon wrap and this was probably the most disappointing plate. I would say all it really needs to make it better is to season the chicken a little more intensely and perhaps add a sharp cheese to the mix (maybe bleu) and it would be absolutely brilliant.

Others in our party has the seafood spaghettini (a bit bland but very meaty), the ""risotto"" (best thing on the table!), and other sides.

2.0,1/6/2016,"TL; DR - Perhaps there are gems on the full menu.  But how often are they prepared properly, as to be gems, when what I experienced showed a serious lack of quality control in chef's kitchen?  If I'm spending $110 for four drinks and two appetizers, everything needs to be on-point every time I visit; from server etiquette and finesse, to space, to ambiance, to execution of every beverage and dish...and I should never feel that I'm receiving less than my fellow diners.Full review:I'm torn.  So much potential for this to actually be an on-point, classy-though-accessible pre-show dining option.  It is certainly an acceptable option for pre-show drinks (all four craft cocktails we ordered were either good or excellent).  And the ambiance is built to easily be lovely.  But the finesse needed to nail all these options just wasn't there last night, and has given me serious pause as to whether I want to give it another chance.Comfortable bar seating.  Lovely - and acoustically pleasing - space design.  Though the bartender didn't really greet or welcome us, even while cleaning the area to start our service.  It took him about ten minutes to make two drinks (and he was only making ours).  Worst of all, he would slam the shakers down on the bar, hard enough to shake it and us, loud jarring noise to boot (very LES dive bar style).Then the manager set up a three-top directly behind us, in the only walking space there was....which led to us being unnecessarily cramped and frequently bumped...Then we spotted a hostess dressed more casually than the same at Virgil's, which changed the tone of the place....Still, a 3-star rating, until it came to the food.The gentlemen next to us were watching their watches, making comment on how long their order was taking.  When it came out, the tortellini in broth looked less than impressive (same as most other dishes we'd been eyeing at the bar), though the mussels and sesame-crusted tuna both looked quite good.  The tuna looked especially tempting, since it was a perfect rare cook, and 7-8 generous pieces, with the end pieces not included on the plate.We ordered one tuna for each of us.  My friend received five pieces, but with a proper cook.  I received four pieces, the two center of which were overcooked, and two end pieces to boot, all with burnt sesame coating.  Clearly, no consistency in portion size, fillet weight, or quality, evident by three identical dishes served quite differently (two of which were for the same dining party!).  This was even more off-putting considering the price tag, which is greater than the area high-end sushi restaurants my friend and I have enjoyed (I paid over $4 per piece of overcooked tuna with burnt seasoning; maddening).Might pop in with this same friend, if he brings it up.  At this point, not likely to try again on my own accord, or to recommend to any other of my theater friends.",6,2,1,Christopher M.,"New York, NY",1591,1629,394

My fiancé had mushroom tortellini as an app, red snapper with a crab chowder (fish special) and a peach cobbler - his meal wasn't featured on the RW menu, but it was totally worth it.

The service to start was pretty terrible and the servers just chatted in the back by the register while we waited to be helped. The appetizer was actually very delicious. We had the caprese and also the chick pea salad. The entree on the other hand, was less than pleasing. The salmon had no flavor or seasoning and was completely bland. The corn served under it however, was quite good. The steak we ordered medium rare and it came out medium well and extremely dry as though it sat under a light for 30 minutes before making its way to our table. It was also a horrible cut and close to impossible to cut through. The entire table shook each time I tried to cut a piece. The desert again was actually pretty good.

4.0,6/24/2015,"I despise Times Square so much, everything is so tacky and fake and every restaurant is a chain with terrible food. With that being said, I randomly stopped in this place the other day and really liked it. As another reviewer said and I agree, it feels like your local restaurant. It's a nice bar that I would describe as new, casual, comfortable, trendy, and tastefully decorated, it's the type of bar I would want to go for happy hour after work. I can't stand the Irish pubs in Midtown that smell like beer, it's loud and over crowded, and everyone seems to be wasted. No thanks. Moving on, the two times I have been here, there have been a fair share of people, but not so busy you wait 30 minutes at the bar just to get a drink. Fairly upscale crowd, although with anything in Times Square, you will always get annoying tourists. Anyway, they have a decent cocktail menu, the bartenders know how to make drinks, and they're pretty friendly. I had their rice balls the other day, which I highly recommend (6 small rice balls with truffle that comes with a side of parmesan like aioli). Delicious.",4,2,1,Shannon W.,"Paramus, NJ",592,501,940

1.0,6/15/2015,"Ok, seriously? What's with all the good reviews? You all really led me astray with this one. Had such a bad experience here last night. The place is beautiful and well air conditioned, but that's all the pros.Our waiter-Carlos-was a jittery mess. Completely unfamiliar with the menu and couldn't pronounce the menu correctly. Gave us wrong pricing on appetizer specials. Caesar salad app-overdressed and served with a hard as a rock piece of bread with parm cheese. Asked him to take it back, and he said it may not supposed to be soft. I dared him to try and bite it as I knocked it against the table. He brought it back out-same bread, just microwaved. So disappointing. Seafood paella-rice overcooked and came with salmon on top. No salmon listed on menu. When I told him, he came over with the menu and read it out loud to check. I was right, but servers really should have the menu memorized. That's also a major allergy hazard. How can you put something on a plate that is not listed on the menu? Gorgonzola and pear salad-my moms salad literally had no pear in it. Wtf? The kitchen is not on point.As we left, the couple next to us complained about the noise level. Carlos said ""well I can't move you because I wouldn't be able to find you again"" seriously????

1.0,5/9/2015,"My girl and I ordered the scallops appetizer for a quick nibble before a Broadway show. They came out and one smelled like ammonia (it was going bad). My girl noticed it as she cut it open, I took one wiff and it was clear as day that this one had gone bad (my nose was burning). I sent it back and the manager came out and told me that it was not bad and insisted that he tasted it.  I asked him if he bothered smelling it and that if he knew what it meant when it smells like ammonia, he just reiterated that it wasn't bad and then decided to patronize me by telling me that I wouldn't have to pay for it since it didn't meet my expectations. My only expectation being fresh fish. I am appreciative that he did but make us pay, but I did feel disrespected when he told us it was not bad. As if we were making it up or trying to pull a fast one on him. We are foodies, I know a bad scallop when I smell one. I would have gracefully left this alone had he not insisted we were wrong.  Smells like cat pee.

While the service was excellent--they accommodated our need to make a curtain, filled water glasses promptly and unobtrusively, etc.--the food was really mediocre.We both had the Caesar salad, which was absurdly huge--one could easily have been shared by both of us--and quite under dressed.  I usually have the opposite problem and hate salad doused in dressing, but I could barely taste anything other than the cheese on the romaine leaves. They don't include croutons in the salad, but instead serve a very large single crouton with cheese on the side of the plate. I've seen this done before, and I just don't think it's a good idea, since the crouton can't be integrated with the salad nor absorb any dressing (had there been any to absorb..)My main course was cornmeal crusted trout served with Asian flavored gnocchi with bok choy. The fish, while cooked properly, was very bland, as the cornmeal was flavorless. The gnocchi were okay, but in the end I just wasn't sold on the whole idea of combining the two ethnicities, which had  sounded better on paper than it worked on the plate. My companion had a pasta dish that was the special of the day. It included sausage and broccoli rabe. It was just okay, and had some kind of odd flavor that we couldn't place--not bad, just odd.I think the best part of the meal was the nice assortment of rolls.

We also enjoyed a nice bottle of wine at a reasonable price. Service was attentive without being obtrusive.

Now, the aforementioned bar food was all okay, but missed the mark of greatness. It's especially a letdown to have only a so-so baked potato with bacon. And I'm still not quite sure what is so special about truffle oil, but it seems to be de rigueur these days. Makes the ingredient less special, no?But the zeppoli are the best I have ever had. They came out crispy, piping hot and filled with warm ricotta. A nice chocolate sauce and a caramel sauce, the latter of which probably skyrocketed me to type 2 diabetes with one taste, accompanied the zeppoli.

The drinks here are reasonably priced and you get your money's worth. The cocktails aren't that bad either, there was an eggnog concoction that tasted like Christmas, very delicious. I didn't have dinner here but just a few drinks and appetizers. Crispy risotto balls - Fried in truffle oil, these little bites were surely a treat. The risotto seemed a little overcooked but these little balls were delicious. Served with tartar sauce for dipping, it was a bit strange but a very interesting combo that worked itself out. Fried Calamari - Fresh, chewy and well seasoned. They were not over fried and had a little kick to it as well. Tamarind shrimp - Three large pieces of shrimp laid over a bed of spicy chutney drizzled with tamarind sauce. This was my favorite appetizer. All I could taste in the first bite was the tenderness of the shrimp, very juicy but I wanted more than three pieces.Peeking at their dinner menu, it was looking very inviting but I was saving room for liquor.

My pasta bolognese was luke warm, kind of cold even. We were a big party and had a schedule, so sending it back so they could nuke it or make a new one would've been a hassle, so I ate w/o complaint.

2.0,10/28/2013,"Was here this past Friday night, before seeing Betrayal. Appetizer - some kind of polenta with sausage. How bad could it be right? It came served as a rectangle chocked full of red pepper. Had to cut it with a knife because it had a skin to it. Ever cut polenta with a knife before? Me neither. Too many peppers and I don't know where the sausage was hiding. It wasn't under the peppers... Didn't finish it.Entree -- hangar steak with smashed potatoes. This was the highlight of the entire meal! On top of the steak were 3 onion rings and I'm thinking they were there for decoration because they weren't edible. Ice cold, hard and greasy. I guess they haven't heard of less is more.Dessert -- pannacotta with berries. Too bland and not enough berries. Left more than 1/2 of it.While the waiter was a lovely person the place was so busy that we did a lot of waiting. Especially for coffee at the end of the meal. No kidding we waited 10-15 minutes for a cup.They did have a really really nice Washington State reisling though. When I requested a second glass they brought me swill -- something sauterne-tasting that wasn't anywhere near a reisling. But they did take it back and bring me what I requested.Not worth the experience and I'll never ever go back.

Got the prix fixe lunch menu, and everything was quite tasty with great portions! Service was good, and the courses came pretty quickly one after the other.Shrimp and scallop appetizer was quite nice, with both being pretty tasty. Both the pieces were huge, too. I got the salmon for entree on a bed of corn and couscous - meat was well cooked at a generous portion, and paired with the bed of vegetables made for a great mesh of healthy, light flavor. For the dessert, I usually would've chosen the warm chocolate cake, but for some reason I am forgetting why I picked the buttermilk panna cotta with berries instead! What the heck!? I never fail to get the chocolate stuff...anyway, the panna cotta was great, so I guess I'm pretty happy with the decision. Now that I think about it, the flavors here were pretty light, so at the end you don't feel as overpowered by flavor and therefore you don't feel as gross and unhealthy.

The menu isn't particularly large, and they served American cuisine.My uncle and I each started with the Caesar salad, and it was large enough to be a meal. I then moved along to the Lamb Bolognese which I enjoyed. My Uncle had the Braised Lamb Shank, but he liked what I ordered much better.

In return, a suited male manager came over to me, repleatedly asked ""are you suuuure you gave the card to us?"" ""did you check your pockets?"" to which I had to check my wallet & purse. After insisting to the manager, who spoke to me with a tone like I was lying/trying not to pay.I've never lost a credit card or forgotten to close a tab in my life, but let me tell you, if 2-3 waitresses/managers keep telling you that you did NOT give them any credit card, adn force you to check your stuff.. it can really make you doubt your own memory. (Also having never lost a card, the idea of having another person lose it for you -- all the while getting accused -- was heartbreaking.My entire table sat without additional drinks & services and waited with no service for a good 20-30 minutes. The waitresses continued to stand 10ft away pointing/staring the whole time.

They have really unique and tasty drinks (like blood orange martinis) and yummy appetizers. The rice balls were delicious. We also ordered the flatbread pizza and chips and salsa, which were average and tasted pretty good. The staff was just so friendly and we had a really nice experience there.The second time we went was after a show and we ate in the upstairs section this time and ordered dinner. They brought out fresh bread and the wait for the food was not bad at all. I ordered a the bibb lettuce salad with a side of rosemary fries. They were good, nothing spectacular, but good and definitely hit the spot. Other people at my table ordered the salmon and the rock shrimp with cavatelli, which they said were both very good. For dessert we ordered the pineapple bread pudding and the ricotta cheesecake napoleon. Both were perfect portion sizes, not too big and they were plated beautifully.

4.0,2/12/2012,"Restaurant Week Review:For anyone who has tried to organize a large Restaurant Week get together, you know it can be a beast. Glass House Tavern was extremely accommodating and gracious throughout the changes in party size, people trickling in late, and some people not showing up at all. They sat the first four people (out of 13) at our nice, large, well decorated table, as soon as we arrived. As the rest of the party entered, they continued to escort them to our table in the pleasantly secluded upstairs area.The menu began with a tasty salad that was advertised as having Roquefort and brioche. When I got the salad, I detected no cheese (admittedly, the reason I ordered it) and asked about it. Our server said that the advertised cheese was actually inside the brioche but he would be happy to bring out a side.The entree was a grilled snapper with sweet and sour eggplant. Interesting flavor palette for the cuisine of the restaurant, but it was well done.Finally, the desserts were all excellent. We passed them all around and thoroughly enjoyed.I credit GHT with four stars for their service. The food was great and the atmosphere was nice and mellow for the Theatre District, but the service is what truly made it shine.",1,0,1,Kirsten S.,"New York, NY",132,335,1
4.0,2/9/2012,"I don't like to throw stones, but I don't get some of the other Yelper's reviews of this joint.  When there are scores of mediocre restaurants in the Theater District, GHT is a consistent performer for me and I can bring local or out of town friends here and enjoy the meal.   I'm sure after reading my review some of you will probably say ""You May Be Right"".Finding a solid pre-theater place in midtown can be ""Sometimes a Fantasy"", but I've found GHT to be a great go to place for a brunch or a dinner.  Ate here before ""Book of Mormon"" most recently and they had a Restaurant Week menu for $35.  Had a great appetizer (bdf* had green salad, I had tomato and green bean salad- both great), entrees were also terrific (she- grilled red snapper; me- petit filet with polenta) and the desserts (she-chocolate cake; me- panna cotta) were great. Portions were splendid. Some people have found the service poor.  To that I say, ""Don't Ask Me Why"". In the four or five times I've been here, it's been friendly, efficient and unobtrusive.I think they have prix-fixe pre-theater menus similar to the Restaurant Week menu and that is a great value.  One cool thing that happened one time was they had a tie-in with the show ""Lombardi"" and they had a special appetizer (cheese plate) and drink (old fashioned) as an homage to Vince and Wisconsin.  Having lived in the 54956 (Neenah, WI) I can tell you it was a good old fashioned!So I think you should give this place a try, but if you don't ""It's Still Rock and Roll to Me"".**_______________________________________*best dermatologist friend** any Billy Joel fans get what I'm going for here?

After looking up the menu online I was excited to try a new American place in the city.The restaurant was nice and the staff greeted us promptly at the door. We were escorted upstairs to our extremely large table. It was very spacious, which was nice as it didn't feel like we were in New York City, but this was almost too much space. The distance between the guests was sort of awkward as it didn't encourage intimacy nor conversation.We were greeted by the server who took our drink orders. Rather than promptly clearing the wine glasses they sat on the table for quite a long time. We had wine that came out in a new glass so there were three glasses crowding the table. One filled with water, one with wine and one empty one. It was the same for the three places that were never filled. Three people cancelled last minute and the server never cleared the place settings, this was also unexpected and sort of disappointing.The restaurant week menu was not that great. I would have ordered from it but nothing really stood out. It seemed that they took the run of the mill three appetizers, entrees and desserts from the menu and called it restaurant week. I decided on the seafood spaghettini. The bread they brought out was delicious and served warm, this was a nice touch. The butter was brought out with the bread while oil and vinegar were on the table already.The food came out in the right amount of time. Although it was good, it was nothing special. From the service to the cuisine I was not really impressed with the overall experience. It was just your average American restaurant with no stand out moments or tastes. To be honest I will probably never return. In the city filled with thousands of restaurants I am not sure that being just ok will do.

Once you travel through the 47th St/Theater/Times Square zone of madness, Glass House Tavern is a soothing escape. A sexy modern bar and friendly host greet you on the ground floor. With reservations, we were led upstairs to the main dining area. It's not huge but the railroad style depth imparts space and coziness. At 12:45pm, it was fairly empty which leads to excellent service expectations, in my book. Was it? Absolutely. Aside from neglecting to bring sugar when it was asked for, service was perfect. The restaurant week menu was ok. For the salmon that's listed at 18.95 on their regular lunch menu, the 24.07 that includes an appetizer and dessert is a solid deal. My portobello salad was delish. The salmon was ok. The bread pudding is like french toast; comes like a slice of bread with a sliced strawberry. Not too sweet, a bit dense but definitely enjoyable.

One of my dining companions said he saw Jennifer Coolidge (American Pie, Legally Blonde, Best in Show) in this place once, so star sighting isn't out of the realm of possibility.The food was okay. Nothing great, not awful. Two things that almost put this place at a 2-star level: 1) My mimosa was more OJ than champagne, and at the price I was paying I expected more of the latter, and 2) two pancakes does NOTan entree make. I'm more of a sweet than savory kind of guy, so I ordered the buttermilk pancake entree. The pancakes themselves were good, but for $13 they should have put at least three on the plate.

To be honest, it was nothing to write home about. It was cooked well, but was too sweet and lacked that ""pop"" that a lamb shank should have.

Dinner: Grilled Hangar steak w/smashed potato and caramelized shallots. The meat didn't have much flavor and I encountered a few really chewy pieces. Dessert: Ordered Buttermilk Panna Cotta- received the Pineapple Bread Pudding. As soon as they put the plate down I knew I received the wrong dessert.

5.0,4/2/2010,"After a so-so and pricey dinner at another Times Square restaurant, my boyfriend and I stumbled upon The Glass House Tavern. We decided to go in for a few drinks to try to redeem the evening.It was midweek, not too crowded and the music selection was great... (Johnny Cash, Ramones, Van Morrison) and not too loud either. The drinks were reasonably priced, especially for New York, and the staff was attentive and pleasent.We enjoyed the Tavern so much, we decided to try it out for dinner the next night.....We sat upstairs in the main dining room which was quiet and good for people watching. The grilled shrimp app (about $13) was delicious and the free range chicken entree (about $20) was very juicy.We went back downstairs to have a few drinks before heading back to the hotel. Again, the service was excellent.All in all, this is the best deal if you're staying in Times Square. It's cozy but contemporary, unpretentious, and affordable. If I could give it more stars, I would.And as a side note, we topped off the evening by listening to Karen Brown play piano at the Hotel Edison just a few doors down. She will play just about any older tune by request; Nina Simone and the like. The cast of characters (including an opera singer) who got up to sing a tune with her was just as entertaining as a Broadway show! She may even ask you to sing.",1,0,0,J. R.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,2,0

There are three tables next to the windows (I reserved for one) and the other two quickly had seated guests, who had also made the same requests when reserving. The dining area beyond the window area seemed a bit more dimmed, and could probably pull of ""romantic"" if on a date.Food:I ordered from the prix fixe menu - three courses of delicious food! The bread had a bit of a hard crust and was a little cold, the butter also wasn't at room temperature, which always irks me a little.I started with the Mozzarella & Tomato Salad. The cheese and tomatoes were absolutely fresh and had a perfect balance of the olive oil drizzled on.The medium cooked salmon came on top of a hefty amount of risotto. The portion was a lot more than I expected but the dish was so wonderful, I finished the entire plate! The smokiness of the salmon could be tasted right away, with a perfectly crusted outer layer and soft inside.The Free Range Roast Chicken was also a generous portion but a bit on the dry side. The Warm Chocolate Cake was greatly balanced with the vanilla ice cream and a cup of coffee.They also carry a good wine list with average prices.Service:As soon as we were seated, we were asked if we would be watching a show that night. When we told them we were watching a 7PM show, our waitress took note and made sure all the dishes came out in a timely manner (but not rushed) so that we wouldn't be late.

4.0,7/23/2009,"When looking for a restaurant to eat a quick pre-theatre dinner, we walked in to the recently opened The Glass House Tavern. This is a brand new restaurant opened about a month ago, if I recall correctly there used to be a Japanese / Asian restaurant at the same location. We didn't have a reservation but the restaurant wasn't that busy for 6:30 pm in the Theatre District. This is a bi-level restaurant with main dining room being up the stairs. Downstairs area features a large bar with some tables scattered. Hostess at the door walked us upstairs to one of the two-person booths. The whole place is brand new and you can see that they wanted this place to look elegant yet casual; very well planned out and decorated. There is a private dining area for groups with a small bar and fireplace in the back of the dining room. The service was superb and extremely attentive for this area of Manhattan especially before the showtime. Our waiter made sure that our meal was complete with time to spare to walk over to the theatre. There is a three course, prix-fix menu for $29.99, even though we didn't order from it, the food looked amazing with very generous portions. Starters averaged at $10 while the main courses averaged at $22-23. There is a well selected wine list and a small dessert menu of $6 each. Besides the dinner menu they also offer bar, lunch and brunch menus.Our server Alain was both attentive and polite. We decided to order the Seared Diver Sea Scallops at $13.95 and Sweet Garlic Risotto at $8.95, for starters and Lamp Pappardelle at $18.95 and Radiatore Pasta with Roasted Duck at $19.95 for mains. Unfortunately we didn't have time for dessert but the Pineapple Bread Pudding looked amazing while being delivered to the next table. There were so many other dishes we wanted to try but it was only two of us and we can only eat so much...Overall this is a restaurant we will happily return. We both thought that the food was excellent and the price to portion / quality was better than most in this area. We will certainly return when back in the Theatre District before this place gets discovered by the out-of-towners. Give them a try and you will be happy you did.
