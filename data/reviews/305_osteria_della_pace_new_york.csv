1.0,3/4/2019,"I came here March 2 for my father-in-law's 70th birthday. We got there a few minutes before our reservations and left our coats with the hostess. It was 6 adults and my two small kids. One look at the menu, and I knew my kids weren't going to eat anything there. The first waiter came by and my mother-in-law asked for cranberry juice. The waiter said they do not have soft drinks like that. My six year old raised her hand and asked for pizza. He was annoyed by this and never took our drink and food order. The second waiter came and took our order. He brought the complimentary bread over (which looked like little pieces of pizza to my kids). We asked if we can get more and he brought it over. The food came and it was so bad and bland. We are Dominican and Guyanese and enjoy a bit more flavor in our food. I asked the first waiter for the restroom for my kids and he pointed to the door where it would be. It was like our presence there bothered them. I looked around the room and noticed everyone there was white. Could this be a race thing, even though the waiters were all Spanish? The dessert menu was never offered to us. My sister-in-law asked the hostess if this place came bring over a cake for her dad's birthday and she said yes, but they never brought it, even after we asked an additional two more times. The bill was almost $300. The food was bad and the service was even worst. When we were leaving you can survey the place by hitting a button. We all gave a negative reviews. The guard suggested we speak to the General Manager. They listened to our experience, and said they would refund. They took my mother-in-law's credit card for an hour and came back and gave her the card. She then asked if it was refunded. They said no, because they gave her extra bread. So if she didn't ask, we would have thought it was refunded. Imagine waiting with two toddlers for over an hour to find out they were not giving a refund, a discount, or gift card....If we looked different, this situation would have been different. Shame on them for not treating everyone the same and ruining my father-in-law's birthday. I would never go back here or recommend this place!!!!!!!!",1,0,0,evelyn p.,"Brooklyn, NY",226,10,0
5.0,2/20/2019,"Had a fabulous dinner at Eataly's Osteria della Pace. I don't give out many 5 star reviews, but this was one of my beat meals of the year. The Brunello wine flight was exceptional. If you like Brunello - do NOT miss it.  The Burrata appetizer was amazing. The bell pepper reduction and almonds with it must be one of the tastiest combinations I have experienced with Buratta. For entree, I had the scallops which were magnificent. Cooked to a perfect tenderness, and the mushrooms which accompanied were made to go with these scallops!Fabulous service, delicious food, beautifully curated wines.  All around great experience!",0,0,0,Alison B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",81,166,25
4.0,2/15/2019,"I found this place on yelp as I was searching for a place for valentine's day dinner. I dint know that this restaurant is in the back of Eataly until I went inside. I usually come to eataly to have a pizza slice or some desserts from their bakery but never went inside the restaurant area. But it is surprisingly a very big area and the view is amazing. This area is also shared by other restaurant LA pizza and LA pasta.I had a reservation at 8 pm but we arrived early around 7:30 and they checked our coat as the table was ready. We started with some complimentary bread with extra virgin olive oil. Their were 3 different types of bread and 2 slices of each. I really liked the tomato focaccia bread. We ordered gnocchi sorrentina and Maialino from the Dinner menu. They also had a special valentine'd day menu. Our waiter told us that our order will take 15-20 mins and we were fine by that as we were on a window seat and the view was amazing, was seeing the WTC with all the colorful lights. Our order came in 15 mins, and both dishes looked amazing. Gnocchi - 4/5I was craving for a pasta but as soon as I saw gnocchi in the menu, I knew its going to my dinner. It came with melted burrata on the top, tomato sauce which was tasty but very less, should have been more on the plate. Gnocchi without sauce and burrata was bland, there was very little seasoning. Overall I liked it, with little more seasoning and more sauce it would have been perfect.Maialino - 4/5The grilled pork and the pork belly was really good but my husband dint like the vegetables that it came with. Their dessert menu looks really amazing but we were so full that we dint order any dessert. But they gave one fennel cookie and one small chocolate crisp as complimentary desserts. I had a great time, service was very good. Its ambiance is very fancy, a good place for a date. Restrooms are very clean and spacious.",2,2,2,Bhavnit K.,"Jersey City, NJ",139,195,1308

I thought it was just a bar when I walk in until the waiter took us to the dining area behind the bar. It was stunning because I didn't expect this view. The interior was very classy and gorgeous, the lighting was perfect for a date. We ordered a bottle of orange color wine the waiter recommended and it was impressive.

4.0,12/29/2018,"Excellent meal; attentive service. Although this Eataly-downtown restaurant is expensive, the portions are generous. Risotto ai funghi was superbly done; tagliatelle al ragu had a traditional, tasty meat sauce. One of the Eataly specials, spinach pasta (twisted pasta braids) was great -- a tad sweet, and with a light truffle sauce. The calamari and fried zucchini antipasto was wonderfully light and crispy. The antipasto meat/cheese platter is pretty substantial -- so much so that we had to request the old ""'take-away' borsa"" for home.

As I expect from a nicer restaurant. However, my dish which was the Passatelli di Mare was an ok dish. The mussels were the size of my thumbnail which didn't end up being very filling and was slightly disappointed. My wife's dish was spectacular and very flavorful which was the Tagliatelle al Ragu.

1.0,8/12/2018,Hahahah what a joke! Came for restaurant week on a Sunday for lunch and the eggplant dish was smaller than the size of my fist. Three small eggplant slices between cheese as a secondini. This was smaller than an appetizer portion.  I asked about the small portion and they said it was because of restaurant week. I've dined at many restaurants for restaurant week and they don't skimp on the food because you're getting a known deal. What a disappointment! I feel like I got punked.

Very fresh. Size seemed small at first but it's just in appearance because I was pretty full at the end!- PESCE AL CARTOCCIO (mussels, clams): it was good.

4.0,7/17/2018,"I think it's important to start off with the pasta. It was very al dente.  Not undercooked.  ...to me at least it wasn't.  I thought it was perfect.  Italian Americans (of which I am one) simply cook their pasta more than Italians in Italy.  The antipasti were all very good.  We were a table of 8 and got 2 salads, a salumi & formaggio platter, fried calamari & zucchini and a fresh mozzarella.  The bread was also good and there was enough for  the table.  Went with ziti all genovese which I thought was outstanding.  Tasted the gnocchi and they were also outstanding.   Was told the lobster pasta was so/so, and the ravioli stuffed with sole was also so/so.  Just cannot confirm because I didn't taste, but the lobster smelled pretty darn good.  Deserts were very good.  Had cioccolata.  Didn't taste the others like ""Italian sundae"" (think that was the name), but was it was good.

5.0,5/24/2018,"Just one word: AMAZING! This little cozy restaurant is an hidden gem in the Eataly DT store. If you are lucky, you can get an amazing table with the suggestive view of the memorial and of the freedom tower (try to ask for it, or write it in the reservation ;) ). The staff is super friendly and you can actually find legit Italians working in the restaurant that make the whole experience even more authentic.We started at the bar, where the bartender made us couple of amazing cocktails. My boyfriend had the No Guey, it was a delicious smokey, fruity, and refreshing cocktail. I had the Italian Sangria. A twist on a Sangria which was made with Lambrusco....tastyyyy! They have a huge selections of wine by the bottle with every kind of price (I would ask for suggestions), and we went for a bottle of DeConciliis ""Fiano""...$105 not cheap, but super worthy.We started with the Tuna Carpaccio and a side of mixed greens. The Tuna was super fresh, and the balance of the apple/fish/capers was perfection.We also ordered the Passatelli with Clams and Mussels, a typical Italian pasta. I never saw anything like this in any Italian restaurant in the city since it's pasta made out of bread and cheese. It was literally mind blowing. We also had the Veal Saltimbocca which melted in our mouths. It was such a flavorful piece of meat!

2.0,4/1/2018,"This restaurant, and most of the less expensive restaurants in this Eataly location, specialize in ruining good ingredients by having them prepared by undertrained/mediocre cooks.  The space at Osteria della Pace is nice, but the food and service are seriously lacking.  It is a wasted opportunity.

3.0,3/8/2018,"So disappointed! I just moved to Fidi and was so happy to have an Eatly in walking distance from my apartment. Eatly itself is amazing. Just like the flat iron location. This particular restaurant falls flat. It's located on the top corner of Eatly. Really gorgeous spacious restaurant with good views. A hidden gem. However, it stops there. Everything from service to food just falls flat. For 1, they are stingy about bread. Literally give you exact # of pieces for the # of people sitting there. Then the olive oil pour is beyond stingy. I guess it's nice to have your waiter give you portion control and carb watch, but thanks we can do that on our own. App wise, the buffalo mozzarella and fried calamari are good. Nice portion and fresh ingredients. The entree pastas, are just okay. Our table got the gnocchi, ravioli, and spaghetti. Probably the best out of the three was the gnocchi. The pastas are all cooked al dente so, if that's not your style beware. The spaghetti was tasteless and the ravioli was okay, but none of us devoured it. All in all it's okay, but for the price you are expecting more. Without drinks our two apps and three  dishes ended up being around 150.00. Not terrible, but not a memorable place.

1.0,2/26/2018,"Well, where should I start!? I went here during restaurant week with my sister and her boyfriend. The menu they offered was subpar at best and the service was really slow. We got through the meal to dessert when my sisters boyfriend started the have an allergic reaction from something he ate. We quickly asked the waiter if there was anything in his courses that had nuts even though we made sure to warn them before the meal even started that he was very allergic. The waiter was unsure so a manager came by and said it's possible that something was cross contaminated. Now, at this point the manager is speaking and my sisters bfs throat was closing. THANK GOD my sister had some Benadryl pills but it wasn't enough so we asked the staff if they had any liquid Benadryl. They could not have been slower to respond and the answer was no. I asked for the check while my sister was panicked and her bf was just trying to breathe...I asked for the check and it took the staff a whole 10minutes and they could NOT have been slower in returning it to the table. I mistakenly left a 30% tip which they did not deserve. ( i didn't realize until the next day) Our meal should have been 100% comped and they should have paid for a cab to get us to the hospital. Now, if things could not get worse the manager flagged us down as we were running out to ask for my sisters phone number so she could ""check in"" on her bf. OBVIOUSLY they just did not want a lawsuit. Needless to say, A HORRIBLE NIGHT AT THIS PLACE. *We ended up cabbing Home and he had a few shots of liquid Benadryl and lots of water and sleep.

Overlooking the 9/11 memorial, this place affords stunning views and a unique perspective on the World Trade Center site. Try and get a table by the west-facing windows. From a culinary experience, I had a delicious lunch here, consisting of an exceptional salad (the insalate verde was really good) and a very nice entree (the tagliatella al ragu) and a perfect ending with a small chocolate-style lava cake.

It was fine until around 10:15pm they started shutting down. There were still other patrons at tables but they took unfinished dishes and glasses without asking if done. They put the chairs on all the tables that were empty. They told us we needed to leave with 'c'mon ladies! We have to close!' It makes sense, this isn't a restaurant but a supermarket that serves food. Once the market closes, they kick you out. We paid $100per person but we were such an inconvenience to them. Food was subpar. The gnocchi shouldn't be called gnocchi. It's a shame bc the venue is nice.**I tried to contact the manager to let them know what happened, and that patrons shouldn't be treated this way. After repeatedly being told that they don't know what happened, and they still need to get more information, when I clearly told them, I just asked for a refund. They said they can add in something complimentary next time I'm there, but I won't go back to be treated so badly.

As he stopped by a 3rd time, we were informed that our entrees would be out in 2 minutes and they began clearing the table. Once the entrees were arrived and were tasted it was obvious they have been sitting back in the kitchen for some time. Both pastas were room temperature and very undercooked.

I chose this place to bring out-of-town relatives for sit-down dinner after visiting the World Trade observatory. Unfortunately, my guests were not impressed. Even though portions were small, my guests barely ate half of their food. Three of us ordered a seafood de mare pasta dish. Unlike other restaurants where large shrimp, mussels, and scallops typically accompany your pasta in this dish, this place chops up the seafood into tiny pieces and cooks it into the sauce. While there was a depth of flavor in the pasta and sauce, it was disappointing not to have actual pieces of seafood. The pasta was VERY al dente, to the point where it tasted undercooked and slightly crunchy. Our server said that is the way this pasta is cooked. We also ordered a cheese and meat appetizer, which included prosciutto and Brie and other meats and cheeses. The meats were extremely salty. I had to wrap it in the complimentary bread and cover the meat with the accompanying honey to make it edible. Not everything was a miss. The lamb chops were good and the pasta Ragu was was typical.

2.0,9/17/2017,"This is a nice place to sit and have a drink at the bar. The bar snacks are also nice. I have a visited the bar a few times when I have been in the area and had always had a pleasant experience. However, the restaurant was very disappointing. I made a reservation for 3 people at 6pm on Friday evening. When we walked in the front dining room with the nice view was fairly empty, with plenty of tables. Since I was entertaining a guest from Germany, I enquired as to whether we could be seated by the window and was told that it was reserved (gee I thought I made a reservation too). We were seated near the toilets and where the staff hung around, but I guess we were still in the main dining room. Other less ""desirable"" guests were being stuffed into the small back dining room. The whole time we sat there and ate and drank, the main room did not fill up at all and one of the two tables I enquired about by the window stayed empty. I suppose you could argue that the tables by the window were for 4 and we were 3, but the table they sat us at near the toilet was also for 4 and so no, that can't be it. I am not sure what the official policy for seating/reservations is or if it left to the discretion of the staff, but they need a reality check as this is an average establishment, not an elite restaurant. Unfortunately the food did not redeem the already bad impression the restaurant staff made. The food was was not particularly tasty - which is so disappointing considering the Eataly location. While the food was not terrible, it was nothing to recommend. The pasta was slightly overcooked and unimaginative. The cooks clearly over rely on the quality of ingredients, which alone does not make something taste good. I would never, ever return to this restaurant to eat. I absolutely do not recommend it, other than for a drink at the bar - the cocktails are nice.

2.0,6/12/2017,"Should have done better research before we made a reservation at this restaurant in Eataly, as the below reviews hit the nail on head. Only pros are the views and the lack of wait time. But even regarding that, when we made the reservation we were told no later than 7:30 was available, then when one party member arrived he told them 2 of us were running late and was told it wasn't a problem, they say that on the phone to make the restaurant seem busier... there were several open tables. They also didn't give us a window seat when there were plenty availableFor a starter we got formaggi - 3 choices of cheese. Very tiny portions. Tagliatelle al ragù dinner pasta was pretty awful- could have come out of a can. Spaghetti ""cacio e pepe"" was a good vegetarian option for one of the girls, but it was just okay and really nothing to rave about. Other person got a salad which was again, standard.All in all, $140 + tip for 2 pasta dishes, a salad, and a bottle of wine was not worth it. Would not return.",0,0,1,Cait B.,"New York, NY",85,48,102

1.0,6/5/2017,"The only benefit to eating here is that you won't have a wait. That's about it.Our fettuccine clams were under cooked, and they said it would take 14 minutes to cook a new one, or to cook the same dish a little longer. My friend ended up just going without. My pasta was also WAY too al dente, almost crunchy. There was never enough water for the table and service nearly non-existence. Oh, and if you happen to be there when it's sunny? Be prepared to feel the heat come through the windows, they didn't even have sheer curtains to offset some of the suns strong rays. Go to La Pizza La Pasta.

1.0,6/2/2017,Am a huge fan of Batali's Del Posto.That being said this place is absolute disrespect to Italian food. Your local pizza shop could prepare a more delicious plate of pasta. Mario should be ashamed of himself & the level of cooking is equivalent to air plane food.Octopus was so over fried you didn't even know it is octopus anymore. The ragu was absolutely tasteless till the point you had to dump copious amounts of red pepper flakes over it to make it worth eating. 3 people $150 & my party were literally laughing on how much a joke the quality of food was. Insult to injury the service was atrocious.If you still go after reading this you most likely are retarded & will think of this review after your tastebuds are extremely disappointed.,0,0,0,Rommo R.,"New York, NY",2,97,0
5.0,5/14/2017,"Nice little place in the back on Eataly. If you follow the signs you won't get lost in the middle of things. No wait when we got there, which is always nice. We had two waitresses, both of which were excellent, and always coming over to see how things were, which I feel you don't get much nowadays, except for maybe once. They have a huge selection of bottles, which we splurged a little and got one. The bread, appetizers, meals and deserts were perfect portion sizes for what we wanted, and just excellent overall. Probably one of the best pasta dishes I've had in a while, it just had one of those flavors I've been missing. I would definitely recommend checking this place out if your in town for a night!",0,0,0,Chris D.,"Ledyard, CT",145,23,19
4.0,5/8/2017,"Located inside Eataly downtown, Osteria della Pace is a more upscale restaurant with amazing views of the World Trade area. Food is delicious. We did family style and ordered a lot of dishes and shared amongst friends. We kicked it off with a platter of meats and cheeses. That honey dip which came with it was so good. It doesn't have the same color or consistency as the normal honey you get buy off from the supermarket but it tastes 100% times better. For entrees, we got the spaghetti cacao e pepe, ziti alla Genovese, scialetti with clams, and the red snapper special. My favorite was the spaghetti cacao e pepe. It was such a simple dish but it was very flavorful and loved the texture of the spaghetti. Overall, it was a really good dining experience and looking forward to coming back again in the near future.",1,1,0,Rowena Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",480,1179,549

Once you're there though, Osteria della Pace is a great little spot with a nice bar area. Some friends and I came here after work the other night for drinks and we were all thrilled with the drinks and the bar menu. We ordered salumi and formaggi misti platters, arancino (fried rice ball) and pizza fritta to share. I had the Venus Rising cocktail (delicious!), and friends had the Martinez, venetian spritz, martini, prosecco, and the dry rose wine which we all loved. It's a nice corner tucked away, not too loud, with nice views of lower Manhattan.

3.0,1/24/2017,"I was really between 3 and 4 stars for Osteria della Pace.  I fell in love with the restaurant immediately.  The service is fantastic and the menu is so appetizing that you want to order everything on it.  I really wanted to give it 4 stars, but the food needs to step up its game.  I will definitely be going back to try more of the menu, and I did really love this place, but in good conscience I had to give a fair rating for you readers out there, the food did not deserve more than 3 stars.Appetizers:-Sgombro (Mackerel crudo) - This dish was unbearable.  I had one bite and couldn't stomach another, very fishy and the flavors weren't working at all-On special they had a ""bread stew"" with burrata.  The stew had really confusing flavors, you couldn't eat it on its own really.  If you spread it on bread it tasted good, but we didn't want to fill up on bread in the appetizer course.  The ratio of burrata to stew was off as well, needed much more burrataEntrees:-Tortelli stuffed with braised oxtail - this has the foundation to be a really delicious dish if executed better.  The flavors are there, but the filling for the tortelli is so mushy that it is off-putting to eat.  The pasta itself might have been overcooked or rolled too thin because the tortelli was coming apart before i even put a fork in it.  The flavors were there, just many flaws in the execution.  Do something about that mushy filling, seems like the meat was blended until it almost liquefied. blegh.-On special they had agnolotti with shaved truffle.  This dish was almost perfection - they just forgot the salt!  This should have been a homerun dish, the lack of seasoning made it borderline bland, a little bit of salt would have gone a long way.  I still loved the dish, I just wished for that dash of salt.Our waiter was fantastic, the atmosphere is perfect, and overall this place has a lot of potential to be great.  I think based on my experience as well as the other reviews on Yelp the owners just need to have a talk to the chefs about dish execution to get this restaurant headed in the right direction.  Almost there, just step up the food game.  I will be back for more of Osteria, and I hope this feedback is taken into consideration for some positive changes.",1,0,0,Marisa S.,"New York, NY",2,16,24
5.0,1/1/2017,"My wife and I love to visit this place around the holidays.  I would go as far as saying that Osteria is the best place to be around the holidays, as the staff is what I refer to as ""Italian Friendly"", they always make you feel welcome, and treat you like family.  The staff is very friendly, as the bar tender Jason is the perfect bar tender, and has great recommendations.Although we've been here for dinner a couple of times, we prefer to order a couple of appetizers and split a bottle of wine.  They have an excellent selection of wine, including Silver Oak, Stags Leap, and Opus One.  On our last trip to Osteria, we tried the Calamari in a hot sauce, I believe it's called the Diablo.  We joked that we're indian and although we're used to spicy food, the Calamari was the spiciest Italian dish we'd eaten in the US, and Italy. We met the owner on our last visit, Nelly.  I love knowing that our money goes to a good family run business, who treats their staff right, as opposed to a big chain.",1,0,1,Indy S.,"Jersey City, NJ",277,186,52
2.0,12/21/2016,"I just stopped in with a friend for drinks to check it out so review is for bar only. We got there around 430pm and there were maybe 4 people in the place but we were waiting for a while before bartender came by. He said he would be with us in a minute and repeated the phrase 5 minutes later. At least 10 minutes before we were served and we were very close to leaving. That being said it was a great looking place and a nice selection of wines by the glass. After the initial bad impression of the service, everything was fine until 5pm when the shift bell must have rang because same bartender is asking every body at the bar to close their tabs because his shift is over, Are you kidding me?? A fine dining establishment is asking to close a check and reopen another one because the bartender wants his tips??Is this a dive bar or a nice restaurant? Very poor taste in my opinion and will probably keep me from coming back. He even asked a couple in the middle of eating to close the check. That is crazy to me..",1,0,0,Joe M.,"Brooklyn, NY",94,83,4
1.0,12/20/2016,"Underwhelming, to say the least. I came here for my birthday dinner with my family and we all left feeling confused and extremely disappointed. We had the chickpea cakes, octopus, and mushroom appetizers. The mushrooms were salty. The octopus pieces were teeny tiny-hard to really taste something when the bite is so small. The chickpea cake was good (it was fried, how could it not be good?).Cacio e pepe, ziti alla genovese, linguine with clam sauce. Absolutely nothing special about any of them, and the ragu on the ziti was, without a doubt, served after it was MICROWAVED. You know how meat takes on that funny flavor and texture when it's microwaved? You can't hide that flavor, no matter how much cheese you put on top. Eating food that is obviously not fresh is not what you want when you're paying as much as you are here. We didn't order dessert after the let-down of a meal we had. The service was good and it's a lovely little restaurant, but the dining experience left so much to be desired.",0,0,0,Kathleen N.,"New York, NY",5,34,5

I had a burrata plate and seared scallops, both of which were fantastic. The white wine I had (can't remember what it was but similar to a Riesling) was delicious.

Walked around the various places, chatted with the staff but we liked the warm welcome the podium hosts gave and the quieter ambience so having assessed the various establishments decided to dine here.The server was quick, enthusiastic and happy to answer all our questions, particularly as my friend has very particular dietary requirements. Italian soda looked tempting, the server suggested the cola flavor, it was delicious and my friend was so impressed he ordered one too. For the meal we shared a bruschetta to start and then had the vegan broccoli rabe, both dishes were good, particularly the starter. Food was fresh, piping hot how I like it and served with a smile.

I got the ribeye which was a very small portion for 40 bucks and my friend for the suckling pig which she liked a lot. Pig dish came with cabbage cooked in lard but was to be desired.

He had plenty of recommends on a menu that was newly expanded. We sat in the main room and took in  the views of the city at night. Fried mushrooms app, along with the tomatoes and burrata were excellent.I had the cod over broccoli rabe. I found the rabe still a bit bitter, but my wife enjoyed it that way. My wife's Cacio e Pepe may be the best pasta we have ever tasted, spring onion mash once mixed thru the pasta was so tasty, yet so simple.Sides of cauliflower, and potatoes, were very good.

2.0,9/12/2016,"What we ate: burrata with yellow pepper puree, ziti with braised veal, spicy cavatelli with octopus, cauliflower saladWhat we drank: glass of chiantiwhat a disappointment. we live in the neighborhood and just got around to checking out the new fido Eataly over a recent weekend. We saw  sign for Osteria della Pace during our day time visit which advertised a more upscale dining experience and immediately made a reservation for dinner the following week. i'm not sure how long this restaurant has been open, likely not long, as there are some significant kinks to work out. Food - we were really underwhelmed with most of the food options we chose. we usually order quite a lot and found a hard time even finding enough things that jumped out at us off the menu to get. the burrata and yellow pepper was a nice simple start. then the pastas were a let down. the better of the was definitely the braised veal ziti - it was rich and topped off nicely with fresh grated cheese. however it doesn't stand up to the amazing pastas available around the city at the likes of l'artusi, babbo, etc and comes at the same price point. the octopus cavatelli was the worst of our dishes - 1 star. it was incredibly fishy, the octopus was overcooked / mushy, and the pasta was also mushy giving the dish no texture and an unpleasant flavor. we left this sitting on our table while we ate the ziti and cauliflower but no one ever came to ask if there was an issue. eventually after we finished the other dishes, my husband finished as he was still hungry. the cauliflower salad was nice though also struck me as a bit overcooked and mushy at times. Service - friendly but not of the caliber i would expect in a restaurant of this price point. it was clumsy and a bit invasive at times. someone attempted to clear our starter when there was still a third of the burrata left on the plate. our water bottle and my glass were empty for most of the mains before i flagged someone to refill. the bill sat on our table with the credit card on top while a manager and multiple servers passed by. we had to wait until our specific server returned to take it (maybe this is a service choice, but i tend to prefer where anyone on staff respond to obvious things like water and checks). also as mentioned previously no one, including our server, ever asked how our mains were and while there was at least one manager  in the dining room, no one came by our table. also no one was at the door when we left, instead 4-5 staff members (including the hostess, apparent manager, somm, and a few servers) were all clustered by the service station to the side of the bar. so we just saw ourselves out of a very mediocre meal. total price for 1 app, 2 pastas, 1 side, and 1 glass of wine (incl tax and 20% tip) = $120",3,1,0,Christina H.,"Manhattan, NY",54,533,110
4.0,8/28/2016,"What a great restaurant addition to the neighborhood. The restaurant is nestled within Eataly past the pasta and pizza stations. The dining area has floor to ceiling windows overlooking the beautiful financial district. Tables aren't too cramped but it does get very loud. Their bread board is delicious. It comes with 4 different homemade breads with olive oil from the campania region of Italy. We started with the panelle which is deep fried chickpea dough topped with escarole and ricotta cheese. You can really taste the chickpea. I got the linguine ai ricci. It was extremely creamy with soft pieces of sea urchin. The pasta was cooked perfectly with a little kick from red pepper flakes and a nice crunch from the focaccia bread crumbs that helps balance the richness of the dish. It is definitely an indulgent dish I recommend. The hub got the maialino which was soooo tender. It had a very nice marinade. It only comes with 1 piece of grilled eggplant for the 2 good size portions of pork though. Really great dishes packed with flavor and well balanced. We definitely will be returning. Service was on point. Hub's water glass had a chip so after telling the server, she brought us another bottle of sparkling water on the house. My only suggestion is to update the music. It was like 80s or 90s pop background music. Something more soothing would have been nice.",6,1,4,Donna V.,"New York, NY",221,288,328
