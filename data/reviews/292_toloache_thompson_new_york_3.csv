4.0,4/29/2019,"My friends and I brunched here this past weekend and we loved our experience. Please keep in mind any venue in NYC where it is bottomless brunch and near the NYU area, it will get rowdy. There were upset patrons around us that complained about the noise level and disrespect of a group of college students but to their argument... Toloache is a fun atmosphere brunch spot on Saturdays and not exactly the first venue that comes to mind to bring the entire family including children. After the disrespectful group of college students left, the manager, Sulima, apologized if it affected our experience and gave us free desserts and drinks and her business card. She was beyond kind and went out of her way to make sure everyone was happy, after the poor woman was yelled at by other upset patrons. We will definitely come back!",0,0,0,Halie E.,"Manhattan, NY",461,24,3
1.0,4/25/2019,"Their service is excellent, the food is terrific--mainly their arroz con pollo, their drinks are very good. I regularly visit Toloache to unwind after long hours of school and work. Everybody in this place is kind and courteous. I was appalled, however, when recently a staff member approached me at the bar and abruptly asked me if I had ordered my food. This staff member spontaneously told me ""the kitchen is closing NOW! and if you don't order you're screwed."" The bartender then proceeded to tell this staff member that I did not intend to order food. She walked away and said in Spanish ""you know how people are, I am trying to go home."" Seriously? I asked the bartender. His reaction, abashed--the reason is obvious. He apologized for that person's ill-mannered approach. To my surprise this staff member was a newly transferred female manager. This was remarkably disheartening. I asked for my check and left the premises. Upper management seriously needs to address that behavior. Until then, I will spend my money and time somewhere else.

1.0,4/21/2019,I really love the food ***** stars The staff ***** specially the bartenders and servers all smiling and ready to take care if you but recently they hire someone that manages the place and she is so rude and no personality at all... complaining in front of clients about her own food  coming from the kitchen out loud???  Very bossy to the employees... very stressful environment for now..../I hope they can bring back someone with a smile and beautiful personality totally into customer service ... other that that  *****starts,0,0,0,Susana B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,3

4.0,3/10/2019,"The only reason I gave it a 4 was because the place was soo dark.. I feel like it should be lit up & bright. They should also gave larger tables & distance so everyone can walk comfortably around when passing by. I loved the food! If you're a vegetarian looking for comfort food (sort of unhealthy & cheesy day) out with your friends or family... please read this:I usually don't like guac (I do like avocados), but their guac de Rojo was amazing ( not spicy, very mild) they also gave a salsa sauce on the side queso fresco which was an upgraded version of salsa ( not chunky, just perfect)Their chips were soo fresh ( fresh as if they just came out of the oven crunch & thin)Their croquetas de queso were amazing (would describe it as mozzarella sticks except it has a Mexican cheesy flair that's soo good) Their truffle quesadilla was nice.. ( if you're a cheese lover you'll love this it's nice & small to feed 2 people. Their cactus fries were alright( nothing too special other than the word cactus) tastes like a common vegetable  (zucchini fries)... I also wanted a fruity drink & the waitress suggested a mango drink (it tasted like an upgraded mango & guava juice cocktail) There ya go. Hope my review was helpful!",0,0,0,Radhika R.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,9,11
2.0,2/23/2019,"Honestly not a good price to quality ratio. Food is okay but I think you can get just as good or better for much less expensive at other places.  Carne Asada tacos were great, enchiladas were okay.  But I think if you're in the village maybe elsewhere would get you better food for the same price.",1,0,0,Lauren H.,"New York, NY",3,127,296
3.0,2/21/2019,"I came in for lunch on a weekday after a long weekend, place was completely empty which I expected and liked since it wasn't a planned in and out lunch so I didn't want to be rushed. Well that was not the case from minute one. We were literally the only two people in the restaurant for a while. From the moment I sat down waiter had asked us ""do you want guacamole"" Would you like to start with would have been nicer. We didn't want any but still haven't had a chance to look at the menu. Waiter returned after few minutes with the same question, ""do you want guacamole"". At this point I was a little irritated, and again said ""no, thank you we will not have any, please give us few minutes to look at the menu"" Anyway, it was this type of experience for most of the time I was there. I at some point asked if he needs us to move to the bar or anything even though restaurant was nearly empty. He had no sense of reading customers and knowing whether his attention is needed or not.We ended up having 2 more people joining us but we're not will to eat just order drinks. That of course didn't sit well with staff.Of course at some point we were asked to close the tab and reopen it due to the shift change, I k ow for a fact this can be easily transferred. Through the rest of our visit we had I think manager come up to us very frequently and asking is if we need anything. When I actually said yes please we would like another round the response was oh I was just checking, waiter will take your order lol.Overall it wasn't a great experience. Food is ok but staff was just a little too much for my liking, I may try another location in the future.",0,0,0,Diana Z.,"Manhattan, NY",59,49,11
1.0,2/2/2019,"If you need a place to ruin your bottomless birthday Saturday brunch, this place is for you. If you're seeking staff that does not speak English this place is also just for you!  We confirmed a reservation for a bottomless brunch for a party of 5 at 2:45pm on 2/2/2019. Most of the party showed on time, however we were not able to be seated until everyone arrived. We were compliant and were told that there's no need to worry- ""would you like to sit at the bar to wait for the rest of your party"". Of course we said okay- I work in hospitality myself. When the rest of our party arrived we all sat down and were given menus that did not include the bottomless brunch special. At first, we all thought this was a mistake so my friend went to speak to management to confirm that we were still eligible for the bottomless brunch. To our dismay, and lack of apparent knowledge (according to the staff that did not inform us) the bottomless brunch had ended 6 minutes prior before we all sat down. This could of all been avoided if the staff communicated properly to their customers that bottomless brunch ended at a certain time..... there was no communication whatsoever, and because of this my Saturday birthday brunch was completely ruined.",0,0,0,Kristen C.,"Elon, NC",505,3,0
4.0,2/1/2019,First visit to the downtown Toloache and it was quite enjoyable. Had a delicious cocktail at the bar before dinner and were seated in their small dinning area. There is an upstairs that our server ensured us gets quite busy on weekends. The server- Luces? was very helpful with explaining some of our questions about the menu. After the guac appetizer we had the carne asada and the chicken tacos. Both were excellent!! Will definitely be going back! Bravo Sr Medina!,1,0,0,Joe J.,"New York, NY",0,8,0

4.0,12/9/2018,"Came here for boozy brunch on two separate occasions. They're usually able to accommodate large parties if you make a reservation. I got the steak burrito, which was really good. Only con is that portion is a bit small. Everyone was satisfied with what they ordered. Service was also excellent. I've been to many places that only refill your drinks once or twice, but the staff was super attentive and came to refill our waters constantly while taking drink orders very often as well.",0,0,1,Wei P.,"New York, NY",24,63,41
3.0,11/19/2018,"The food and service were subpar. The meat could have been more flavorful, and even cooked a bit better. I had the meat platter for two and it looked better than it tasted. It was also definitely overpriced. Just a disappointment.",0,0,0,Roxanne G.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,107,76
3.0,11/6/2018,"I've been to Toloache a few times. It's a New York Mexican chain with a colorful ambiance and festive decor. It's great for group gatherings or simply one-on-ones. All times I've been, it hasn't been crowded at all. Service has been standard. First of all, try those grasshoppers! They're crunchy and chock full of protein. Second of all, the portion sizes here disappoint, especially for the price. I came for a group brunch this past Sunday and got the huevos rancheros. I downed the toppings in three bites and I wasn't even hungry. It is more of an appetizer size whereas it's counted as an entree. I would advise against ordering it if you're hungry. The table shared the guac trio appetizer, and my favorite was the one with pomegranate seeds. It's so fruity and fresh! I also got a tea, and even though they have no Mexican ones, the ones they do have see pretty unique! They also have coffee if you're here for brunch. I've had the brisket and beef tacos here, and while they are delicious, the price is too much for the small portion! If you're hungry and/or want to get your money's worth, I'd get the carne asada or chilaquiles. Those options are huge and much more worth it. Overall, it's definitely not my favorite commercialized Mexican food, but it's worth at least one visit if you get the right item. Also, some complimentary chips and salsa would've been nice.",5,2,5,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",978,2060,1393
3.0,11/5/2018,"Their pozole is on point! So amazing. Best that I've had since moving from California.That being said, if you come here with a large group, not accommodating, not attentive, not worth it.This past weekend, I came here with a large group. We had given the restaurant advance notice and made a reservation day of. We get there, place our orders and wait. They were great on water, terrible on refilling our bottomless drinks. I struggled to get 2 drinks, not because I couldn't finish my drink but because after I finished my first, the waiters avoided eye contact and didn't even come over. The bottomless drinks for $20 is a great deal if you can get at least 2 drinks as one drink is only $12. That being said, how is a place bottomless if you're trying to order a second drink and no waiter is coming over to check up on you even when you wave and make eye contact at almost every waiter in the room. It should not take more than 30 minutes for a waiter to come over and yet they charge you 20% gratuity...",1,0,0,Rebecca H.,"Manhattan, NY",322,236,36
2.0,11/5/2018,"My friend suggested Toloache for dinner on a rainy Thursday night. The restaurant was mostly empty but somehow I got seated on the only ripped cushion in the place. And by ripped, I mean there was a massive gash in the cushion with the stuffing coming out. I tried to put on a brave face but I actually sunk into the rip when I sat down (lol - 'twas a sight to see), so I just moved myself and my stuff to another unripped seat while I waited for my friend. I had a chance to look over the menu while waiting and definitely spied some cool dishes that I wanted to try. We settled on the guacamole which was okay, but particularly oniony. Strongly recommend against this if you want your date to like you after dinner. Up next, we tried to lobster taco which, again, was basic. At $17 for 2 tiny tacos, I would say this dish is pretty pricey and, in my opinion, not worth it. At this point I still had hope for our main dish but...We split the Lechon Prensado - a massive chunk of pig carnitas, corn pudding, some sort of chile/tomato salsa and a mix of vinegary, pickled vegetables. I thought this was going to be the highlight of the evening, but unfortunately, the lechon was dry and the corn pudding resembled scrambled eggs. I wouldn't recommend. We took a few bites and then left the rest.I think the best part of this place has to be the friendly service and the classic margaritas - these margs were extra strong, perfectly salted, and well worth the $$$. Come for the drinks, skip the food.",2,1,2,Cristina G.,"Brooklyn, NY",239,409,960
5.0,11/4/2018,"Came out for the bottomless brunch and it was so delicious! I made a reservation a week or so ahead, but lots of slots were open at the time as well. When I arrived, I was directed to sit at the bar until my friend arrived. They brought me a glass of water while I waited which was nice. As soon as my friend arrived they seated us immediately. A great aspect of this bottomless brunch is you get to switch between drinks, so I started with a hibiscus mimosa and then switched over to the frozen margaritas. The mimosa was a little too sweet for me - I'd probably stick to an OJ mimosa next time. The frozen margs however were very good and very strong! 3 of them was more than enough. We started with the traditional mild guac and it was so fresh! It's a good portion as well - we weren't able to finish it. They bring out some kind of salsa or queso with it which was spicy and tasty as well. For our entrees, we both went with the benedict. It was a delicious surprise! We weren't sure about the sweet corn cake as the base but it turns out it was a perfect balance of flavors. I like that they had melted cheese in it, and the serrano ham is thinly sliced which I loved. The mexican-style hollandaise was a good twist on the typical kind. Was truly delicious and filling.The waiters were very attentive and kind. Had an amazing experience and would love to come back to try more of the margaritas and menu!",0,0,1,Natalie K.,"New York, NY",106,67,2

5.0,10/27/2018,"This place is pricey but delicious. A small restaurant  that takes reservations (and on Open Table) with all the Mexican options, cute for friends or a fun first date.We got the spicy guacamole which was incredible and easily shared between 2 people, if you have 4 people you probably definitely need 2 orders.  The chips and salsa were so good as well. We ordered a seasonal appetizer special which was out of this world, a cheese crab dip served in a pumpkin sent me to heaven as a basic festive pumpkin bitch, but it was to die for! The drinks were good as well and perfectly proportioned with alcohol to mix, I loved the Paloma with fresh grapefruit.For dinner I got the chicken enchiladas which were insane and so good, i didn't need to eat them all and shouldn't have but i did, god help my soul. My friend got this veggie quinoa paella which was out if this world as well, i don't like cauliflower but i loved this dish.For dessert we got the churros and there are about 6 tiny churro sticks with a chocolate and caramel dipping sauce.

2.0,10/10/2018,"This was a disappointing experience for us - I've been to a couple of other Toloache outposts and I've generally been quite happy, but Toloache Thompson missed the mark. Food here was not as good as I'm used to from Julian Medina establishments. We were a big group and got a few dishes - a few were good but most were quite disappointing. Some of the ones I remember were the Camarones Toloache (the shrimp were stale and overdone), the Costilla de Res (lacking in flavor and a bit dry), the Lecon Prensado (best dish of the evening - flavorful and moist), and the Paella de Quinoa (dry and lacked truffle flavor). They also have the tacos here (including the famous cricket tacos) if you want to try them, but remember the portion sizes for these are quite small.Cocktails here are tasty and strong and worth getting. Our server was friendly and upbeat and did well to keep up with our big group, but made a mistake and charged us for a drink we did not order. Toloache is a place that is pricey for the food portions but the quality is normally  guaranteed; unfortunately this was not true for the Thompson st. location. You're probably better off going to a different location like the Midtown West or the Upper East side one instead.",0,0,0,Melville G.,"New York, NY",124,361,697

Our food took a while to come out so our server Rogelio (shout out to this beautiful man) gave us shots and dessert on the house.

5.0,9/23/2018,"After about 4 or 5 visits, I've come to think of this as one of my faves in the Village. When I'm looking for quality food at a little bit of an off-hour, I always walk by here because it's often possible to do a walk-in outside of meal time. I can only figure that's because it's not quite what the ritzier crowd would consider fine fair, and it's going to strike a younger crowd (like NYU students) as too pricey.In my opinion, it finds a very happy space to exist between the desires of those crowds. It's not cheap, but not that expensive either. And the drinks and food are consistently excellent. The ceviches inparticular always leave me happy, and I can confidently recommend the quesadilla de huitlacoche y trufas for any truffle lovers. I agree with others that the menu makes the guacamole optoins sound like they will be more unusual than they are, but I've always found them to be excellent.I just noticed the cactus fries, and I'm already excited to return.",0,0,0,Daniel K.,"New York, NY",120,44,0

We loved the guacamole, but my friend and I agreed that the salsa stole the show.. ****Pro Tip**** Hold onto the salsa and put it on EVERYTHING. Trust me, you'll love it. We also tried 2 orders of tacos and some rice and beans. Everything was fantastic! Around the time we were finishing this food, a large party came in.

3.0,5/28/2018,"A pretty mediocre place for Mexican food. I came here with a bunch of friends for dinner and they cramped 6 people into a 4 seat table. When we asked them if it's ok to move the 2 seater next to the 4 seater, they pretended not to understand us and walked away. The hostess then basically told us they only do that if we have more than 6. I may be bad at math but that just didn't make sense.We were too hungry to argue or look for another place so we stayed and crammed ourselves into the space. We ordered our drinks and they do have strong drinks so that's a good thing. We ordered a bunch of food to share family style and the portions were perfect for doing so. We had the fruit guac, (honestly couldn't taste the mangoes) was very good flavored wise. The ceviche sampler was ok, the octopus tapas was the best in my opinion. The rib eye was definitely better than the skirt steak (too dry even at medium rare). The garlic shrimp was delicious but you only get 5, so we had 1 piece each. The lechon was tender but I wish the skin was crispy. The seafood paella was ok. Didn't have much flavor.Overall, I can't say any of the food was memorable or makes me want to go back.

The grasshopper tacos where very interesting. The waiter said that they were very healthy based on what they eat (grass etc). My friend loved them ! I on the other hand couldn't get over the crunch which made me not like it so much . Those were just for fun though. For the main entree we got quesadilla's which turned out to be pretty small and looked like another appetizer which I guess made sense since it was only 15-17$ .

What my date and I ordered... the medium guacamole, beef short rib quesadilla, carne asada tacos with queso, the sweet plantains, rice and black beans, and margaritas. Everything that we ordered was EXCELLENT.  What surprised me was the pomegranates in the guacamole. It gave a nice pop of sweetness and the salsa that accompanied it was amazing! The consistency was nice and smooth, not too spicy, but just enough to warm the tongue. My favorite items were the tacos, the quesadilla, and the margaritas. The meat was super tender and juicy in the taco and quesadilla. I have never had tacos THAT good. The margaritas were equally amazing! They were very strong, but still had a nice balance of flavor.

Our table was a little drafty since we were seated right up against the large window pane walls. But overall I really liked the vibe. They offer a 20$ bottomless drink option which we all participated in. What is nice about their brunch is the drink list is extensive- sangria, mimosas, margaritas and more.

1.0,11/4/2017,"I had a birthday brunch here earlier today for 27 people. I've never had a worse or more embarrassing experience in my life. We selected the 1.5 hr unlimited drink brunch special and after an hour 4 people in my party still had not had one drink and when we asked the waitress where drinks were, we got the response it was coming. When I looked down at the rest of my party the table was completely empty of drinks and everyone was waiting on a second round for at least 25 minutes with no drinks on the table. To say I was stressed was beyond an understatement. To make people pay $45 for one drink during an unlimited 1.5 hr open bar is beyond embarrassing. We found out the reason for this was the bus boys were drinking margaritas in the closet behind our table as some of our table could see into the closet.  After this they dropped an entire tray of drinks that shattered on the floor. The whole room screamed and we thought this was a one off.  After this they dropped a second tray of drinks followed by a third tray and during the 3rd tray, 2 people in my party were spilled on and my friend went to tell the manager that the bus boys were drinking in the back which caused them to spill. While she was down there the bus boy spilled a FOURTH TRAY OF DRINKS this time shattering glass and red wine that spilled on my $1,500 bag and my friends $2,000 suede bag which is now completely ruined and I feel responsible for.

4.0,8/25/2017,"I'm a big fan of this Tolache and have come here numerous times - mainly just for cocktails. As a number of other reviewers mentioned the food is definitely on the pricier side for the portions that you get - you could definitely rack up an eye-watering bill if you were loose and easy with your ordering. But, considering it is sandwiched between the West Village and SoHo I guess the prices aren't totally ridiculous. I still think that the food is decent. It is also very vegetarian friendly (they have a separate menu) but, as is the case for many Mexican restaurants, not so much for vegans. At this Tolache I really enjoy the decor. It is all very cute and Mexican-themed. I particularly enjoy the patterned tiles and overall color scheme. Downstairs has smaller tables and bar seating whereas upstairs caters to large groups. For my best experiences here I have sat at the bar. I find the staff to be friendly, fun and chatty and always I have fun if I sit there. You can eat there if you so desire. As aforementioned, I honestly come here for the cocktails, and one specifically: the Poquito Picante. It is a delicious Mexican cocktail with gin and just the right amount of jalapeno spice. Plus it is beautifully presented. Try it - you won't be sorry.I know Tolache also offers brunch. I haven't tried it or visited the other locations - but I will look to do so in the future.

Two of my favorite items on the menu are the Suadero Tacos and their Flan. I basically get it every time with obviously chips and guac. the only reason I am giving this restaurant a 4 stars instead of the 5 I truly think it deserves is strictly because of one event that happened to my friend here were our waitress took a tip with her card because my friend did not tip with her card but two others did with theirs. We didn't realize it happened to her until the next day and she had much difficulty getting a refund when it happened. The waitress did not pay attention to our table and the fact she took a tip was in a sense disrespectful even though others did tip her.

We came on a Wednesday evening around 830 and there were plenty of tables in the upstairs sitting room. The service was good and all of the food delicious. We started off with cucumber margaritas. While expensive and small they were good. The food was the real star here. We ordered watermelon fries which as you guested are exactly what it sounds like. Watermelon, Fried like french fries but in some sort of a batter that was slightly sweet and with two dipping sauces that had a chipotle flavor to them. Afterwards we split several rounds of tacos and while the orders are small after an appetizer the tacos were filling. We had the short rib tacos, the shrimp tacos, the fish tacos and the star were the special scallop tacos. I really recommend all of them they were good in their own way. Everything was very fresh with interesting and creative toppings.  We were pretty stuffed after that and wrapped up and so the bill only came to around $40 a person for each of us.

The place is attempting a pricing strategy like Dos Caminos, which is interesting because I don't think the guacamole is worth $14. I didn't order it, but the table beside ours did and it looked pretty basic.I think what took away from the experience for me was the value of the food. It was delicious, but really nothing crazy special. It was a good thing my friend and I were not starving, because the tiny portions were just right.We filled up on chips & salsa ($4), but my friend didn't really seem to like the salsa they gave us, so she asked for a verde one, which was added onto our bill as extra. The salsa they originally gave us almost tasted like a sundried tomato purée, which I didn't mind.We had the - Shrimp Quesadilla ($14, really not what I had expected; it was a tortilla base with the littlest bit of melted cheese, shrimp, and a pineapple salsa)- Beef Short Rib Tacos ($16, actually very delicious from the one bite I had from my friend's dish, the meat was succulent and tender--a signature Chef Julian Medina dish)Overall good food, but don't think I'll come back!",1,0,0,Rucha D.,"Brooklyn, NY",455,187,233

They were really really strong and definitely lasted the duration of the meal2) Homemade guac and chips - a solid complement to the cocktails3) An appetizer of your choice - ordered the Quesadilla de Huitlacoche & Trufas.

Carne Asada - medium rare steak was solid Brussels sprouts - on point and perfectly seasoned. Never thought veggies could be so yummy5) Dessert - The texture of the sorbet was flawless.

I'd like to say it was a margarita and it was delicious, but what do I know? The food, however, I do remember. I remember devouring the guacamole. I also ordered tacos as my entree and really liked them. I got the Pescado, Suadero, and Pollo. I added the salsa they give us with the chips for an extra kick.

A few people sitting at the window wall even had their dogs with them, and were able to have them sit outside next to their tables. Now for the boozy brunch: You could alternate between Margs, Bloody Mary, Mimosas and Sangria, so the options were pretty great - $20 all you can drink for 1.5 hours. It took a while to get our first round, but they kept the drinks flowing from that point on.Foodwise, all the guys at the table got the steak burrito, and were all shocked at how small the portions were (especially when you are ordering unlimited drinks)! I ordered the pork torta, which was covered in a red tomato sauce, a little bigger portion than some of the other meals at the table and was quite delicious!Overall successful boozy brunch where the drinks continued to flow and they were not too pushy to get us out of there at the 1.5 hr mark!",0,0,0,Sam K.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",138,211,397

Around 6, the bar filled up and so did the customers. We ordered a couple of drinks for around $5-7 on their happy hour menu along with some apps such as nachos with guac and their other tapas dishes. I do not know the names but they tasted quite similar but were good and filling if you order about two dishes along with a drink.

2.0,2/25/2017,"This was our 8th or 9th time dining here. This time was for lunch with my wife. They always try to seat you at the smallest table possible which is very annoying. They were not busy at all and sat us at a table that gives absolutely no foot room for the person sitting on the fixed bench and the person on the other side is smack in the middle of the walkway to go through the restaurant.  Nothing annoys me more than my chair getting knocked, banged or kicked every time people walk by. If you ask for a table with more room you are told those tables are for 4 people. My wife ordered off the lunch special ($16.99) menu (guac & Tacos), and I ordered off the regular full price lunch menu. Since all of the items on the special menu are just items from the taco and salad section from the regular menu I expected they would come out fast so I asked for my taco appetizers to come out with my wife's guac and my entree to come out with her tacos. I don't think this was a request that was difficult to accomplish. Well, my wifes whole meal came out with my appetizer so by the time my entree came out I was eating alone.The tacos were delicious as always but the Carne Asada left much to be desired. The skirt steak was under cooked and not as tender as usual, the potatoes gratin were cold in the middle and the cheese enchilada seemed as if it was cooked in a microwave (the guac was good though).Overall the food here is usually good but this time left me thinking it's time to find a new Mexican place to eat. Somewhere that has my comfort in mind and doesn't have way overpriced food. Seriously though... 2 tiny tacos for $16...  $14 for guacamole, c'mon now, the October avocado shortage is over.Downstairs has Very Cramped Seating! Try to get a table upstairs.

The chips were so good and fresh and served warm, and the avocado fries are a MUST!!! The sauce they're served with (along with the house salsa) was incredible; it was blended and sort of viscous and orange and probably the best salsa I have ever tasted. Our entrees were equally delicious and we raved about our meal for days afterward. I had the carne asada tacos- let me say, I typically cannot stand a soft corn tortilla and the same goes for my sister, but these....game changer. They were so fresh and delicious I may consider myself a corn taco lover now! She had shrimp tacos and said they were one of the best she had ever had. Both entrees came with beans and rice and were so flavorful and filling. The only drawback is the price..for the two of us for lunch, ordering guacamole and chips and salsa, avocado fries and 2 entrees cost $72 before tip...that's extremely pricy for Mexican, however, I will say it was the best Mexican I've ever had and well worth the price.

The reviews were good and we were sorta nearby. When we get to the restaurant we were seated on the first floor by the bar/kitchen. It seemed as if this was a two floor establishment. Our table for 2 was so cramped It was so hard for us to settle down. We still hadnt taken off our coats and the waiter was already asking us for our drink orders. Also, since it was so cramped we were literally sitting on top of the people next to us and I felt like I was apart of their conversation. Fast forward to the menu...everything is overpriced. OH and the tacos platter are appetizer sized and DO NOT come with a side of rice and beans. Yep, my plate cost $14...FOURTEEN dollars for two VERY SMALL appetizer sized tacos, let me also mention that these were NOT appetizer items  and on top of that I had to order a side of rice and beans which was an extra $6. I was very disappointed. HOW DO YOU NOT SERVE RICE AND BEANS WITH YOUR MEAL??? Aside from that major dissapointment the tacos tasted great. My friend ordered the fruitas guacamole which was FOURTEEN dollars as well and it was the size of a kids bowl of soup. she also had the tortilla soup which was $9 Now dessert....the dessert was excellent. We ordered the churros which comes with a caramel and a chocolate dipping sauce and you get 6 small churros for TEN DOLLARS. I wish the churros were bigger because they were great.

It was just a bowl of acid with some cheese sprinkled on top. And it was room temperature. I couldn't finish it. My guest had the beef and bone marrow quesadilla which really wasn't a quesadilla because it was open-faced. So half a quesadilla? The beef was chewy and there was too much going on flavor-wise. The flavors didn't mesh together. Serving sizes were small for the price. Which is fine if I'm blown away by the flavors, but if I can make better soup from a can, I'm not happy with the value.

2.0,10/15/2016,"I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this place sooner. I usually don't like to review places when I haven't gone more than once. My one food experience here was bland. The guac and salsa was bland; the salsa tasted like tomato sauce (see my sister, Louise M.'s review - we went together!) My steak tacos were bland, and for something between $16-18 (I can't remember), you get two measly little tacos!Also, it might just be me, but, listen to these weird string of events: the kitchen sent my sister's order wrong - sent out fish tacos instead of chicken tacos. The food came out quick and in such a hurry that they got her order wrong. Next, (white) patrons next to us (and seated after us) were offered that night's food and drink specials, while we were only offered drink specials. We were probably the only patrons of color in the restaurant at that moment, but it was clear that the waitress didn't put the same care and effort in serving us colored folk.

The restaurant brought a piece of tres leches for dessert with a candle, and when we got the bill we saw they charged us for the dessert. It felt really petty to charge 10$ for a birthday dessert when we already spent 600$ on food/drink and then 100$ for the included tip. All of us enjoyed the food - between us we ordered guacamole, quesadillas, tacos, brussel sprouts, avocado fries and margaritas. I'm sad that i felt ripped off when i left, since the food and drinks were really good. Yes, in the long run it was only 10$ for the tres leches but after an almost 700$ bill it seemed like they were adding it onto our bill thinking we wouldn't notice.

Maybe I was expecting something elevated but I was also expecting authentic, and I was a little let down for the following reasons:- Spicy Guac ($14) - was not spicy. came with salsa that tasted like tomato sauce :(- Chicken Tacos ($13) - for two tacos; filled to capacity and tasty, but the single corn tortilla was so thin that it quickly fell apart in the chicken juices. also, no cilantro or spicy salsa :(- Waitress - very nice, but didn't tell us the specials which we probably would have gotten had we known they existed. We overheard her telling the table next to us about the specials long after we placed our order. The service is fast - too fast, like the food is already prepped and ready to be plated - so this place is good if you are in a rush to go somewhere but also want a nice sit-down dinner. Overall, I there are plenty of Mexican places in the area so this probably wouldn't enter my rotation, but it's a decent spot if you're not keen on spicy Mexican food.

3.0,8/17/2016,"Came here for what we thought was Restaurant Week Brunch as they advertise on the nycgo.com website as having it on Sundays. When we arrived, management informed us that they did not have it and when inquired as to why they were listed on the nycgo.com website as having it, they pointed out that the website notes that the website also says that Sundays are optional. While not incorrect, it seems strange that the listing itself includes Sunday Brunch, Lunch, and Dinner. Does that mean they have it sometimes then? If so, it would be nice to be notified when making a reservation what was available. If they never have it, there might a issue of communication between the restaurant and nycgo.com as to how their listings should be done. (See attached picture showing Toloache's listing along with a few others that are much clearer as to what is available and what is not)FOOD: Although disappointed with the fact that we were not able to experience what sounded like a very good set of dishes for Restaurant Week, the group decided to stay and try out the brunch menu that was available which included bottomless drinks. The group members that took advantage of this agreed that the drinks were good and the options were decently varied for a bottomless option. The menu for brunch includes standard Mexican dishes like huevos rancheros and tacos and some standard brunch fare with a slight Mexican twist such as breakfast burritos and french toast. We got some guacamole for the table and I'll echo what another reviewer said about the spicy guacamole being just ok as far as heat level goes. The guacamole itself was good and I quite liked the one with apple and pomegranate. For entrees, I ordered an egg dish which I quite enjoyed. It was unfortunate that the poached eggs were a bit overcooked. There was a bit of runny yolk left but not as much as I would have liked in a dish like that. An extra note would be that the house hot sauce is the exact opposite of their spicy guacamole. It delivered quite the punch and helped spice up the entree I ordered.SERVICE: The server we had was great. She was very high energy and was always ready to help. Waters were always filled and drinks were always ready to go when ordered. There were no complaints on this end.",0,0,0,Henry W.,"Elmhurst, NY",86,25,5

1.0,7/19/2016,"Well, maybe a Yelp review will get them to finally reimburse me for my bill that was overcharged for an amount that I never signed for. Let's start off by saying despite what I've just said, I had a terrible experience from the start. 1. Walk in. It's my boyfriends 30th birthday. We have a few friends with us - in total, a party of 7. It's a Tuesday night and the restaurant is nearly dead. The hostess starts freaking out and goes ""ugh hold on."" Leaves and comes back. More politely she says, ""ok just give us a few minutes to set a table up."" Ok no worries. We head to the bar to wait. Told her to just let us know once the table is set up. 2. We get to the bar and the bartender completely ignores us. Yeah, there's two people at the bar. But didn't realize that meant we get ignored. Finally we get his attention. We ask for a few Pacificos and two cocktails. I'm a server myself so I understand the cocktails might take a little longer, but this guy doesn't even begin to make our drinks or get the beers which are in bottles and easy to serve!!! We waited 10 minutes to finally get beers. My boyfriend was so angry he went across the street to get a drink. Was served immediately. 3. I finally check with the hostess after waiting 30 minutes for our table. ""Oh we thought you weren't staying."" Ugh what? We told you we were going to get drinks at the bar while we waited for you to set up the table!! Whatever. 4. Finally, we sit. The server comes over. Service seems to be better than what we experienced. She takes our order and everything seems fine. 5. My boyfriend leaves to go to the bathroom right before our food is out. We flag down the waitress and let her know it's his birthday. ""Oh cool here is what we have for dessert ______."" We picked the flan and a shot of Jameson. She proceeded to tell us the dessert would be on the house. Oh cool! Definitely making us happier than the host and bartender!!6. Our food comes out. We didn't get anything too big. A few tacos, a quesadilla and two sides. Two of our friends ended up getting rice and beans as a side but never got it. I went to the bathroom and on the table outside there was the rice and beans. Attracting bugs and getting all gross. Lovely. Good thing they didn't serve that to us! But it's fine. Maybe they just forgot. 7. Dessert and drinks come out. Everyone is happy.8. Bill comes. Dessert is on there- ok I'm not gonna complain. It would have been nice to comp it since that's what we were told, but whatever. BUT the rice and beans which are still sitting on the table by the BATHROOM (yuck!!) were on our bill. The server then gave us an attitude when we asked for it to be removed. As a server myself, if I made an error it's my duty to comp it. Especially if the customer never got it. 9. We pay and everyone leaves. Head to another bar and try to forget about that god awful experience (at least the food was good!)10. About three days later I check my bank statement and find out I was charged $40 over what my card was originally ran for. Tried calling the restaurant. Was told it's a holiday weekend so someone would call back after the holiday. I totally understood. Waited another week...NOTHING. Called again was told ""oh I'll have the manager call back tonight."" Waited waited waited. Nothing nothing nothing. Call again was politely told ""oh I'm so sorry. Just give me your information and I'll credit you now!"" Ah finally. Someone could help!!11. It is now July 19. I ate at the restaurant on June 28. And I have still yet to be reimbursed for the overcharge of $40. Not to sound like that ridiculous commercial, but, ""it's my money and I want it now!!"" Toloache, I will never be back.

Up until this point, my favorite place for a hibiscus margarita was Papatzul but this place is now neck-and-neck. Also, the guacamole is fabulous. When I saw the price tag (over $10 for guac seems excessive), I almost didn't order it but we were hungry and needed something to go with the drinks. Safe to say, I understand the price tag now because the ingredients are amazing and the taste is robust.

5.0,7/16/2016,"I have a lot to say about tihs place:First of all, after reading some negative reviews about this place, I considered cancelling my reservation. I am SO glad I didn't.  The service: 10/10.  Our server, Hector M, was unbelievably kind and helpful.  He recommended our drinks, dessert, and which ceviche to get!  I loved everything he recommended.  He frequently returned to our table to see if we needed anything else.The ambiance: 9.5/10.  Many people complained in their reviews that it was too loud.  My boyfriend came on a Friday night and could easily hold a conversation.  While it was very crowded (people are seated very close together), I think this actually adds to the ambiance.  It felt less like an expensive restaurant in the middle of tourist central, and more like a small gem tucked away in NYC. I also loved the tiling on the walls and the Spanish music they played. The food: 9/10. My boyfriend and I loved EVERYTHING we tried here. We had the chipotle shrimp quesadilla, the fruity guacamole (perfect for 2 people to share; was the best guac I've ever had), the ceviche trio (the bottom 3, which were recommended by our server), and the lobster tacos (the lobster meat was tender and juicy.)  I highly recommend all of these items on the menu; they each had unique flavors and spices.  The only reason I give it 9 out of 10 is because the portion sizes were small for the prices.  The drinks: 9/10. I had a frozen margarita (mango flavor) and loved it - I don't usually like alcoholic drinks but this one was great.  And it gave me a nice buzz.  My boyfriend had two drinks - the mescalita de pina (too strong for me to enjoy, but he loved it) and the La Passion (which he - and even I - loved as well.)  Again, only giving this a 9 out of 10 because of the prices.  The dessert: 10/10.  Our server recommended the Chocolate Mole.  I had never had mole before and eating it here was honestly a great experience.  The chocolate tart paired so well with the cherry ice cream.  A great dessert to share between two people. We will definitely be returning.  Thanks, Hector!",0,0,2,Alyssa J.,"Nashville, TN",0,18,2

I ordered from the lunch special menu, so I got guac, an entree, and a soft drink or iced tea for about $17. The guac is great! I opted for the traditional mild guac and was pleasantly surprised by just how much they give you! I couldn't finish my guac, if that says anything. The guac as an appetizer alone is expensive so I'm not sure if I would have ordered it if it weren't included in the lunch special menu. For the entree I ordered the tacos de pollo, which were delicious. The dish comes with 2 tacos, rice, and black beans. The tacos were incredibly messy so don't order them if you're trying to impress anyone (i.e. a date), but they were really good. My friends ordered quesadillas and reported that they were good.

Our friends ordered this as well, and also ate about 2 slices and stopped eating - we should have shared. Los Tacos - comes with 2 tacos each - were very delicious, beautifully presented and with a good amount of meat, however they are little tacos and quite pricey for what you get.  I'm from California, so $$$$ tacos blow my mind, even when they are high quality!Langosta $17 - Spicy lobster, morita salsa, avocadoGood amount of lobster, I was impressed, not a ton, but more than just a few slivers.  Flavor and salsa was delicious.  Suadero $13 - Bohemia - braised brisket, avocado red onions, cilantro, tomatillo salsa horseradish cremaSimilar comments to above, great meat, flavor, salsa - which I had 6 of them!Platos FuertesBacalao Trufado $30 - Miso-tequila glazed black cod, corn, hon shimeji mushrooms, chipotles black truffle butter Perfectly cooked and flavored cod.  There are no words, it's amazing! For this I think $30 is a fair price (the starters, tacos and sides were pricey for what you got).Camarones Toloache $28 - Roasted garlic shrimp, crispy tortilla, black beans chayote squash spaghetti salad, Mexican cheeses cascabel salsa Huge shrimp, great flavor, amazing sauce, great mixture of textures - loved it!Overall, the food is amazing, there is no denying that, I think I just can't get past how pricey it is.  I would say the two entrees were definitely worth it, but the tacos, appetizers and sides were too pricey for not that much food.  As I said, I'm from California, so we have good quality Mexican food, and it doesn't cost $$$$.  Personally I would not come back here again if I were paying for my meal.  I would recommend this place to others for good Mexican food ONLY if price was not an issue.",2,0,2,Klarissa L.,"New York, NY",64,166,953

4.0,2/2/2016,"This year, I decided to do New Year's Eve dinner at Toloache, mainly for these reasons:1) Reservations were easily available even day of through OpenTable at prime times.2) They were offering their regular a la carte menu in addition to the usual Gatsbyesque prix fixe.Everything from the beautiful servers to the casual yet chic dining areas agreed with us, including the reasonable noise level (fun but not too crazy). The table was available almost immediately and our server was a really cool dude from Mexico (wish I could remember his name to call him out) who explained the various menus and made confident recommendations (always great).The food itself was excellent, 4.5/5 stars, or whatever. You'll probably [want to] get the Trio de Guacamoles, which is a nice sampler of mild, medium, and spicy (though very tolerable even for non-spice eaters) guac.-Mild: Avocado, tomato, onion, cilantro, serrano.-Medium: Avocado, pomegranate (!), Vidalia onion, mango, apple, habanero, Thai basil.-Spicy: Avocado, tomato, red onion, chipotle, queso fresco.All three were fantastic.There were a number of inventive entrees courtesy of Chef Julian Medina, but since I intent revisit Toloache sometime, I kept it simple with an order of tacos: -Costilla & Tuetano (Beef short ribs, bone marrow,Thai basil, roasted red onion-jalapenochiles toreados)-JM Pescado (Baja-style fluke, spicy jicama slaw, guacamole)Both outstanding. They have other tantalizing choices, with ingredients like grasshoppers, lechon, and cactus. Hard to choose just two.We kept the booze flowing with Mexican red wine, which was actually quite nice. There are also a bunch of expertly made cocktails. Really, one of the better ambitious Mexican kitchens in the city, if you're willing to shell out a bit of dough. Good place to take a date, too.PS: I strongly disagree with the 2-dollar sign price index tag. It is very easily a $$$ place, especially for a Mexican restaurant (even if it's upmarket Mexican).",6,2,3,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2506,1716,229

5.0,1/24/2016,"This place has to be one of the best Latin American restaurants in the city. Top notch!We came here for Restaurant Week. I wanted to come a couple of times for RW in the past but I just couldn't so it was on my bucket list. The chef Julian Medina has some great dishes that I couldn't resist.The food is amazing, especially the entraña which I have to say coming from Argentina, it was one of the best I ever tasted. So tender with an awesome grill flavor. It goes head to head with the entraña at Tabaré which is one of my favorite Argentinian/Uruguayan restaurants out there. The key is their sauce!! superb!! the portion is big, and I say it's big because it's big for New York, it's super big for a RW menu and it's big enough for a starving person. Add an appetizer and a killer flan and you'll be heading home in an ambulance LOL.All the dishes are generous in size and there are no bad choices. We order the lamb tacos and the quesadilla with burrata for the appetizer round. The tacos had a lot of flavor: the lamb was greatly marinated and it came with nopales which add a nice touch to it, also, they came in corn tortillas that beat the hell out of the flour tortillas... Mexico style! The quesadilla (more like a open-faced quesadilla, kind of a pizza shape) had an incredible pesto that made the difference and the tortilla was crispy and tender. It remind me of a Malawach (a Yemenite dish).The entrees were incredible. I put too much of an excitement to the review but the experience was like that indeed. The entraña again... mmmmm... is just music to my ears. I forgot to mention that it came with a bed of brussel sprouts on top with cheese and this amazing chipotle/mole/chimichurri-like sauce that put the dish in another level.Then the salmon! don't forget about the salmon. Excellent! order everything medium rare. That way you'll have super fresh food in its perfect point. The tortilla underneath with black beans adds a lot of flavor to the salmon that again came with a really nice sauce.Dessert? who said dessert? yes! my girlfriend came just for this. That's how I convinced here to come. Flan de Dulce de Leche and Tres Leches. What else can you ask for??The flan competes with the dulce de leche flan at Tabaré. It's soooooo yummy that is mouth watering everything I think about it. The Tres Leches is also great: it comes with a ice cream that is nothing out of this world and soaked in a nice milk based cream. I would definitely go with the flan every time. Even two flans!! for RW... the tres leches is ok but it didn't surprise me.It was a lot of great food for a great price! go for RW if you can since I find it quite expensive for a regular dinner.

We got the guacamole trio to start out which was out of this world. The bloody mary wasn't very good (I'm a die-hard bloody mary fan and I switched to mimosas for drinks 2-4). I got a burrito as my entree and it was ok, but I've had significantly better breakfast burritos. My friends all loved their entrees though. My burrito came with the weirdest ""hash browns"" which were basically little long, thin potato chips. I wasn't pleased. The salsa that came with the burrito was dope, though.

We were seated 20 minutes after our reservation time. -Our waitress spilled an entire tray of drinks all over my dad. We had to move tables because the booth was wet. Once at the new table we had no water, no napkins, and no one came back for a good 10 minutes. -Someone showed up apologetically with some extra guacamole as a token of their apologies. Very kind. That was probably to distract us from the fact that it had, at that point, been an entire hour since we ordered food. -A busser took all of our plates away while we were still eating chips and guac; during that time he reached over my friend, put his arm right in front of his face and *in* the guacamole that was about to be in his mouth. ??-When the food arrived, my dad's steak was ice cold. He sent it back. It came back 20 minutes later - it was warm, but rare. (He had ordered medium well.) By the time we all had our food, the magic was just gone. I'm sure it was fine, but nothing really stood out and we were starving anyway. We sort of scarfed everything down and tried to get the check. It took another 30 MINUTES before anyone even came near us, and when we asked for the check they just started putting spoons down. They gave us two small, mediocre desserts meant to make up for the rest of the evening, and I actually had to get up and find someone to give us the check a few minutes later.

5.0,11/6/2015,"This review is to add to the one we submitted two years ago - In all that time, Toloache has never let us down - excellent food, great ambiance, attentive staff - it has become our go-to place for neighborhood dining as well as for company. However last night something happened that went beyond our normal high expectations. I have (alas) been put on an extremely restricted diet and cannot (alas, again)  eat much of what is on the menu. In the midst of a party of eight, I asked Hector, our waiter, if I could just have some bread and butter and he genuinely apologized for the fact that they did not have any. I was fine with water, figuring I would eat when we got home - but 20 minutes later, Hector appeared with a plate of warm Italian bread and a dish of butter that he had gotten at the Italian restaurant across the street! We were absolutely floored! This brought customer service to new heights - bravo and many thanks to Hector -and, as always, kudos to Toloache for a wonderful night!",0,0,0,Felice K.,"New York, NY",0,13,0
5.0,11/5/2015,"I recently was here with a group of friends and we had a great time. First we started with the guacamole trio which consisted of two mildly spicy guacamoles and one spicy. One of the mild ones had pomegranate seeds in it, I never tried that before and was happy to taste that it was delicious. It added a sweetness to a dish that usually is only savory and salty.We ordered a bunch of dishes to share. I like how they did not bring out all the dishes at once. They served more than half of them first, then gave us fresh dishes and then served the remaining dishes.The vegetarian enchiladas were too spicy for me. I cannot tolerate a ton of spice but at most Mexican places the enchiladas are not too spicy for me. The huitlacoche quesadilla with truffle oil was delicious and the mushroom tacos are probably my favorite.Something to keep in mind when ordering is that the dishes are not authentic to Mexican cuisine which can be a disappointment when certain dishes are ordered and you receive something very different than expected. For example, the vegetarian paella de quinoa. When I ordered it the waiter warned me that he didn't like the dish. I always appreciate an honest server. He asked if I liked quinoa, which I do, so I ordered it. After having the dish I really think they should just rename the dish. It was tasty but did not taste anything like paella. I have had vegetarian paella at other restaurants which is prepared and tastes very close to traditional paella with the saffron rice which I think is key to calling a dish paella.  I like how that have a lot of vegetarian options but you have to ask for the vegetarian menu. I'm not sure why they do not just make the vegetarian options as part of their regular menu. When they give you the regular menu almost every item had meat or fish. So if a customer is vegetarian and does not already know to ask for a vegetarian menu that customer could be quite disappointed.This place is good for anywhere between a party of 2-8. To make a table of 8 they placed a large table top over four smaller tables which is nicer than having four separate tables pushed together.  I always appreciate attention to these fine details.",2,0,0,Nicole C.,"Manhattan, NY",109,121,477

2.0,10/30/2015,"Terrible restaurant management.  Do not go here. If u are here with a noisy party don't expect anything done about it.Update**We came for a family reunion with a party of 10 and sat next to a party of 12. This party treated the restaurant as a bar by continually with yelling, drunken guests running into us, continuous singing, and chanting multiple times during a three hour period. Despite our requests along with others, management explained there was ""nothing they could do"" after a few attempts asking them to ""consider others"". After 3 hours of tolerance, we asked them to be respectful of others and were confronted by the nastiest ""man"" of their family who began yelling at everyone that he was ""ready to go"" if they ""had a problem"". Although we would have loved nothing more than to confront the low-life instigator, we decided to leave so we would be welcomed back and because we were raised with morals and respect for others. As regulars and NYC residents, we may return here because the food was great and management made an effort to discount our bill. However, catering to rowdy and disrespectful derelicts is not a way to keep long-term patrons. If degenerates are disrupting your restaurant, the 20% extra gratuity should NEVER be worth losing faithful patrons. We hope the distinctions are understood.",0,0,0,David U.,"Irvine, CA",10,4,0
4.0,10/27/2015,"Discovering this charming Mexican restaurant is one of those delightful culinary surprises that, fortunately, is still possible in this city. After finding the Porto Bello closed, despite our reservation for a late dinner, we worried that we would have to either go hungry or settle for some sub-par eatery. Then we noticed this restaurant across the street, whose parallel-to-the-street long axis and large windows allowed us to see that many of its tables were occupied with actively-engaged diners. We ventured in. Was the music too loud or of poor quality, perhaps? No. We were seated. There began a truly gracious dining experience. The manager, a pleasant and intelligent young man, readily complied with my request not to call the three of us ""guys."" The menu held wonderful creations that my wife and I had not seen before in many decades of Mexican dining, both here in NYC and in Mexico. The guacamole was as good as any we've tasted and the fairly hot sauce served on the side was an irresistible lure for dipping taco chips. Fluke ceviche was very fresh and properly piquant. Many dishes were accompanied by cooked quinoa instead of the usual rice. The appearance of huitlacoche (black corn fungus -- Mexico's truffles) on the menu was quite unexpected. (Rosa Mexicano used to serve it but does no longer.) My only regret here was that the fungus was cut into very small chunks. Then, a dish consisting of a pressed block of alternating layers of crispy pork skin and pork meat brought my admiration for their kitchen's inventiveness to a successful conclusion. Coupled with glasses of satisfying Rioja (both the Tempranillo and Garnacha varieties), this unexpectedly fine meal caused us to wonder: ""How have we overlooked this place for so long?"" The musical ambience was pleasant and appropriate for the most part, lapsing only occasionally into too-loud, U.S. pop-contaminated fare, which is the only thing that prevents me from awarding five stars.",0,0,0,Barry F.,"New York, NY",0,29,0

The food and drinks are solid, the vibes are fun, and you'll end up paying a little bit more than you probably should, but you'll have a good time.

3.0,8/11/2015,"Toloache has been on my Yelp bookmarks list for a while now. They have multiple locations, but I happened to see a Travelzoo deal for brunch + unlimited cocktails for the Thompson Street location. So a friend and I decided to try it out. It wasn't too packed at noon on a Sunday but when we were leaving (at around 1:30, aka prime NYC brunch time), it was getting filled up.For the deal, you get pick anything on the menu for your entree. It's not limited to the brunch section. However, for drinks, you can only choose from red/white sangria, bloody marys, or mimosas. I tried the bloody mary first, which I did not like. Something just tasted off about it. After that, I stuck to mango mimosas (I believe they also have regular, and hibiscus). I tried my friend's white sangria and it tasted like straight up juice. But enough about the alcohol.I've been hearing that their grasshopper tacos are pretty interesting. Normally, I'm the type of person who will try anything once. But bugs/insects is where I draw the line. So I went with the lobster tacos. Technically, they're like bugs since they're considered cockroaches of the sea, so that's gotta count for something, right? No? Okay, fine. Anyway, this comes with two tacos, and a side of rice and beans. I'm pretty sure the lobster isn't fresh but it tasted pretty good too me. Plus they didn't overcook/reheat it so the meat wasn't chewy at all.I probably won't be back for unlimited drinks brunch since the drinks weren't too great.

I never once felt judged or uncomfortable because I brought a coupon, they served and treated us just like we paid in full for each item (and to be honest, after this experience, we will be back, with coupons or without).We came for brunch with 90 minutes of unlimited mimosas (multiple flavors) and white or red sangria. Let me say, their hibiscus mimosa is now my favorite. Funny enough, I am a white sangria type guy, but I found it a dash too sweet and found myself enjoying more the red sangria (big glasses btw). Additionally, you can change between any of the drinks, so if you want to start with the mimosa, you can change into the sangria and back!! Can't tell you how disappointed I have been at other places that offer unlimited of their drinks, but they limit you to select only one of the drinks for the full time. We tried the Hibiscus, Mango mimosas, and both sangrias and they all were quickly favorites for the table. They also really kept are glasses of drinks as full as our glasses of water quickly!For food, we had a few plates. Our starters included chips and salsa and their open quesadilla, which included truffle cheese with corn, black bean puree, our cream, and chives. This was such a delicious appetizer! I usually think that the truffle oil is really overpowering of most plates, but it just added such a great taste. The chips were so crispy (I definitely feel they must have been home fried) and the salsa is a puree (don't expect the chunks of tomato and cilantro). We asked for both the red and green sauce. I have to say, the red one was much less spicy than the green, but both were equally delicious. For main entrees, we got the steak and eggs, and I got the ""Huachaca"" (God, I hope I wrote that correctly). My taste buds were in heaven, though I would gladly sell my soul to be able to eat this food all the time (and not gain weight, let's face it, it is tortilla, cream, and cheese heavy). The steak was a pretty big size, and cooked to medium rare perfection, the eggs, were so well cooked, with a side of delicious guacamole and a tortilla filled with melted cheese and smothered in black bean puree with more grated cheese on top.... I want to go back right now!!! The ""Huachaca"" was definitely a bit lighter (maybe cause it doesn't have a huge slab of meat), but by no means missing on flavor and presentation. It is a work of art of all goodness! The chorizo was such a great touch, and my goal was to get full, but not overdo it... besides, I had plenty of drinks, and boy did we have drinks. We even got the churros desert which included small dips of chocolate and dulce de leche.... Yes... bliss.... and what a way to finish the meal...  The unlimited brunch time was not over yet, and though no more food was coming, they had no problems in bringing us more drinks even after we paid. With that said, you should be respectful, and if your time is up, go ahead and move over to the bar area and ask for a double barrel reposado shot of Herradura that only Toloache has to offer. (Not a cheap shot, but so worth it if you are a tequila lover as we are). This is a sipping tequila type experience, something to take in smoothly and just enjoy the good quality. We did not try their margaritas sadly, but there will always be a second, third, and many more times. Wish they had an establishment in Long Island City... Lord knows we do not have enough Mexican great restaurants like this one. As usual, I will now rate this place by their ability to be more of a first, second, or third date type establishment. If you follow my other reviews, you know I usually stay away from load places for first date. For this reason I would have said second or third date... but we decided to sit in the first floor of this two floor location, and we had a window view... and what can I say, I could not stop looking at my partners eyes... and the light just hit his face in a way, that I was willing to let him eat the very last piece of my desert and be ok with that! This is definitely a first date type place, a come celebrate your birthday with good friends type place, a come by yourself and eat good food type place, a make it your go to restaurant type place. Fun atmosphere, good on noise level, and again, the best staff I have received service from in a long time! Many thanks to Toloache staff and management for giving me one of the best brunch experiences in New York City!",1,0,1,Evian D.,"New York, NY",425,239,432

4.0,4/28/2015,"Went here with my husband for an early dinner on a Sunday evening and there were surprisingly a lot of people (5:30 dinner downtown?), which added to the nice vibe. We had a traditional guacamole (very good, nothing exotic because that is the type we chose), the huitlacoche and trufas quesadilla (excellent and a real departure from standard quesadillas), cactus fries (delicious - who knew?), the quinoa paella and the carne asada. Everything was delicious. We also tried their traditional margaritas. Finally a place that knows how to make a margarita that is not cloyingly sweet. The quality of their ingredients in both their drinks and food are really what set Toloache apart.Some vegetarians might be disappointed that there was only 1 main course, but I found they had tons of other options. I once heard they have a separate menu, too, but I was actually excited about the quinoa option and did not ask for it. My only recommendation would be for them to offer a different salsa or hot sauce that does not have chipotle. I found it overwhelmed the flavor of some of the dishes.

3.0,4/8/2015,"If you're brave, try the grasshopper tacos. For me that's what Toloache is all about. Eating crispy bugs wrapped in a corn tortilla. Otherwise, I can't justify the prices for two al pastor tacos. Something that you can find much cheaper most places in the city. I give a pal of mine (Jando) a hard time for thinking $3.50 is too much for an awesome taco at Los. Tacos No. 1. But these are on a whole other level at $14 for two. I'd totally understand anyone balking at that price point, Jando or otherwise. While the food carries an elevated price tag, their margaritas are stellar and fall right in the average range for drinks in New York. The blueberry number is especially notable. My suggestion: head to the bar, grab a margarita, and if you're feeling like doing something wild... snatch up a grasshopper taco and post your bizarre foods moment for the world to see.

2.0,2/16/2015,"The food was good, the margaritas were great but the service was pretty bad. I should maybe cut them a little slack being that I did go on Valentine's Day but considering that we were seated at 8:15 and didn't get our entrees until two hours later was unacceptable. We ordered off of a pre fixe menu that included one and a half hours of unlimited margaritas which I thought was good. The problem with that is that is was hard for us to even order drinks since our waitress would disappear for 5 - 10 mins at a time and then when we would get eyes on her, she would be on the other side of the restaurant so we weren't able to get her attention. At one point, the manager noticed that we were looking around a lot and he came over and took our drink orders. We had the tacos langosta as an appetizer. We didn't get our appetizers until about 9pm which is 45 mins after we've been seated. We had the filet mignon a sour entrees but we didn't receive that until around 10:15 and that was after we asked how long it would take after ordering our entrees at around 9:40. I was a bit annoyed at this point so when our entrees came, I also asked for the bill. The waitress began to apologize and said that she will give us an extra hour on the unlimited drinks since we've waited so long. On top of the long wait, it was pretty cold inside of the restaurant. A little bit too cold, as if their heaters were off.

Rest of meal was NOT inexpensive, but the quality of the food is there.  My $32 paella entree was enough for only 1, but had large, fresh and juicy pieces of crab, shrimp, and clams.  We had the grande ceviche sampler ($34) and they were so beautifully prepared.  $18 for a (chef's special) margarita is very rich, even for NYC standards, but it was excellent and muy fuerte, mis amigos.  Tasty happy hour margs are $5 (sadly, no food on the HH menu).  There was a hiccup with dessert, but the management was so prompt and apologetic about remedying a forgotten order and drinks that they sent out a couple extra on them.  Pre-tip/tax per-person cost with 1.5 drinks (one was on HH), entree, and shared apps and desserts was about $80.  I've been to the UES location, which is also excellent, and was very pleased the Village one was just as good.  I can't wait to go back!",0,0,0,Cynthia L.,"New York, NY",0,41,10

4.0,11/18/2014,"For my party of 10 on Saturday night-a birthday celebration, and Halloween weekend-this place hit the mark pretty damn high.They were very easy to deal with for reservation/logistics reasons. I had to make a last minute change to add a person to the reservation and it was met without question. When we arrived, people trickled in around reservation time, as will happen with a large party, and it wasn't a problem. We did end up ordering with one person still missing, and again, no issues.The restaurant is two levels. Decor casual without being tacky, dark & warm, not overcrowded with tables as many restaurants in this neighborhood can be. In fact, given the two levels and many tables, probably a lot bigger in general than most area restaurants.The service was great, very attentive and well timed. The overwhelming observation of the group was two-one negative and one positive. The negative being the price point, mostly for drinks. I have to agree, though in Manhattan-and the Village at that-a margarita at a casual Mexican restaurant probably is too steep at a $15 price tag. And NO margarita pitchers! I was quite sad by that. I guess at $15 per glass, though, your pitcher would have to cost like, $60, and who would buy that? The other very overwhelmingly positive remark by the group was that the food, all around for the 10 of us, was fantastic. There were a few people who had tacos-lobster and beef short rib both had fans. I had the suckling pig entree which came with some sort of sweet corn side dish. It was so damn good. I don't eat a lot of meat, but something about suckling pig always makes me go carnivore-and I was not disappointed. We also collectively tried the guac trio (two for the table of 10 of us worked well), all three were great. Honestly, the salsa that was served on the side with the chips was maybe even more remarkable than any of the guacs. Churros (again, x2 for the table) were great with two dipping sauces to top off the meal.I was very satisfied, having planned the get together, in all aspects of the meal.

3.0,11/15/2014,My friend and I went for dinner here on a Friday night. Pros: It was busy but didn't have a problem getting a reservation. The jalapeno margarita and mahi tacos were delicious and the staff is friendly!Cons: 3 Stars though because the service was very slow/unattentive--we ordered the fried brussel sprouts as an app and after a long time waiting for it to come out we asked about the status of it. They finally brought it out but with our mains. I also requested no cheese but there was cheese on my chicken tacos.,0,0,0,Sonali G.,"Hollywood, FL",4,24,0

3.0,11/11/2014,"I tried 5 different tacos: fish, shrimp, brisket, short rib, lechon (pork). The winners were shrimp and short rib. Very very flavorful. The fish taco tasted fishy that night. The lechon and brisket were forgetable. Cactus fries - interesting. Had a citrusy taste. Good to try once out of curiousity, but wouldn't order it again.Guacamole sampler - get it. I'm a big fan of the original/plain. However, the pop and slightly sweet surprise of the pomegranates was a nice change, and the spicy notes of the other sample was very tastey. Service at 11pm was great - no complaints from me. Yes, it's dark like other reviewers mentioned, but not so much that it bothered me. It can get loud too. Seating upstairs is much nicer - roomier and less noisy.",0,0,0,Jamlen F.,"Long Island, NY",69,162,30
4.0,11/10/2014,"Fantastic food! Although, this place is quite ridiculously pricey for a Mexican restaurant (only forgivable cause it's in nyc, where most restaurants are overpriced anyways). Running into some unexpected company, my bf and I decided to meet up for a double dinner date. Mexican was the consensus so we scouted Yelp for the best in the area, and lo and behold, Toloache popped up. Located in Greenwich, amongst other hipster establishments in the backyard of Soho, Toloache is a cozy, modish Mexican restaurant, with wood paneled ""windows"" that probably open up like balcony doors in the summer and dim, intimate lighting. The decor is modern but rustic, clearly a hipster nyc establishment but still paying some homage to Mexican culture.For appetizers, we ordered the Trio de Guacamoles: Three bowls of guac that ranged from sweet and creamy to smokey and spicy. The Tradicional (mild) was your typical guac and my least favorite cause it really didn't pack an oomph and I can barely recall what it tasted like (ingredients: avacado, tomato, onion, cilantro, serrano). The Frutas (medium) was extremely smooth and creamy but also sweet and tart (ingredients: avacado, pomegranate, vidalia onion mango, apple, habanero, thai basil). Finally, my favorite... The Rojo (spicy) was a fantastic blend of spice and smoke, with a hint of sweetness and tartness mixed in, while still maintaining the smoothness of good guac -- multidimensional and absolutely delicious! (ingredients: avacado, tomato, red onion, chipotle queso fresco). It was also great that the waiter made no fuss about refilling our chips, and actually filled it a second time without even being prompted.  For an entree, my bf ordered the Enchiladas Borrachas, which I unabashedly stole several bites of... ok, maybe half the plate or more ended up in my stomach. It was that good! Pulled chicken, tomatillo-5 chiles salsa, and borracha mexican cheeses, topped with crema, lettuce, and radish salad... I'm salivating just thinking about it! Spicy and tender chicken, cooked to perfection, wrapped in a heavenly mix of salsa and cheese, then brightened and crisped up with some radish and lettuce, this dish was easily devoured in seconds. My bf left the table for a few seconds to do a restroom run. He came back to find his plate half empty and me surreptitiously stuffing some lettuce in my mouth. Two Enchiladas? No, hun, there was only one all along.Astounded by the steep prices, I ordered a taco appetizer in lieu of an entree: The Carne Asada tacos (marinated beef skirt steak, chipotle salsa, avocado, onions, and cilantro). Like the enchiladas, these tacos were divine -- perfectly cooked beef (juicy and tender and well-marinated), smokey and spicy chipotle salsa, a creamy slice of avocado on top, and some onions, cilantro, and lime to add even more dimension, brightness, and punch to the dish! The best tacos I've ever had in my life were some fresh, authentic, dirt cheap tacos from a Mexican hole-in-the-wall marketplace that my El Salvadorian friend took me to in Texas. Toloache's tacos are the only tacos that have even come close to being comparable to those.Our awesome and unexpected dinner company ordered Pescado tacos (fish tacos), sauteed spicy kale, and Pollo Toloache (chicken toloache). Judging by how quickly their food disappeared from their plates, I'd say those dishes were also big hits!Finally, for dessert, we ordered two plates of churros and proceeded to try to play churro jenga (which, might I add, failed miserably). The manager or maitre d' (someone official looking with slick hair and a nice suit) walked by and noticed, to his and our amusement, that we were attempting churro jenga. Courteous, jovial, and welcoming, he chatted with us for a bit then brought us a round of free tequila shots on the house cause it was our first time at their restaurant. Absolutely stellar service!Food: 4/5 -- Delish by NYC Mexican food standards and ok prices too, by NYC standards. Outside of NYC (say in Texas or Cali), you'll definitely be able to find better Mexican food and prices but as far as Manhattan goes, this is one of your best bets.Service: 5/5 -- Fantastic! Free tequila shots at the end and super attentive and friendly throughout.Atmosphere: 4/5 -- Intimate, cozy, nice dim lighting, modish but still rustic... just your typical hipster abodeOverall: 4/5 -- Great place to get solid Mexican food in NYC!",1,0,0,Diana F.,"Harrisburg, PA",136,163,811
2.0,11/10/2014,"Will start by saying the atmosphere in this place is awesome, nice bar, nice upstairs dinning area. The food was awesome and drinks were on point. The reason behind giving only two stars is the service and miscommunication between management and service was horrible. Half way through our dinner(7pm reservation) we were told that we had to leave by 8:15 with no reason. Immediately after finishing our main course we were rushed into dessert selection and handed the check before even receiving our desert. We approached the manager asking why we need to leave by 8pm if there is  a set time allowed to din and they needed to make room for other reservations, he did not know what we were talking about but did not offer to stay longer or ask who told us this information. Immediately after paying for our check we leaved, and the manger rushed after us, apologizing for any misunderstanding and wanted to offer us one free drink. One free drink after a $200+ dinner?

We started off with beers, I had never tried Pacifico and as the chef suggested it on the menu I gave it a whirl, excellent choice. We then had the guac sampler, and it was killer. All three guacs and the sauce were spiced to perfection. Its that feeling of heat without the ""OMG IM GOING TO DIE WHERE IS THE WATER"" heat. My girlfriend had the fish tacos and spiced kale. Let me be frank and say I dont enjoy kale, but this stuff was great. I had the chicken toloache and again, spiced to perfection. We all enjoyed our meal and moved onto the churros. They were presented nicely and both sauces were on par with the excellence of the meal.

Their main dishes are appetizer sizes which they tell you when you order but it's too pricey for the amount you get and they tasted just mediocre. I ordered the shrimp quesadilla and hamachi ceviche.

They also have my favorite Mexican beer, the dos Equis lager. They have grasshopper tacos! I didn't have the gumption to try them this time but I did try the brisket which was good just salty. The lobster tacos are better.The quesadilla with truffle is very good. Probably one of my favorite things there.I had a shit ton of dessert given the birthday dinner. The tres leches tasted like pineapple upside down cake. I wasn't a fan of that and wanted a more dense experience from the milks, not pineapple. But I do like pineapple upside down cake I just preferred that it taste like its name. The chocolate bread pudding is very good especially the fruity sauce it comes on top.Churros are ok but they don't offer much in comparison with my favorite...Caramel popcorn flan with raspberry sauce base is the best dessert.

All 3 are amazing twists on traditional guacamole. For entrees we had the cod with truffle butter (excellent), lobster tacos(v tasty) and the enchiladas. The food is not your run-of-the mill Mexican food smothered in cheese and beans thats served by chain restaurants, . Each dish has a distinctive flavor and texture.

Came here with a couple of friends on a Thursday evening and we were able to score a table right by the front window open to the sidewalk. As soon as we entered, we were greeted nicely by the host and seated to our table even though the third person in our party was a bit delayed. So thankful for that considering most places in NYC will not seat you without your entire party present. We started off with some house happy hour margaritas and they were delicious. A bit on the smaller side, but packed quite a punch so that was a non-issue. We got the rojo guacamole, which was good, but the chipotle sauce on the side was the real star of the dish. I do wish it was a bit bigger of a portion however. To eat we shared the shrimp quesadilla, lechon tacos and fish tacos. Portions are a bit small all around, and it would have been nice if the tacos could have been served in groups of three since there were three in our party. The shrimp quesadilla was a favorite of the table and I highly recommend this here! Probably the best version of that dish I have had. We even ordered a second quesadilla since it was that good. The lechon and fish tacos were okay, but not sure I would order them again. Would probably try something different next time. Unfortunately the grasshopper tacos were unavailable that night so we weren't able to try them.

Onto the important matters: The food was delicious! There were so many things on the menu that sounded amazing, that I had a really hard time deciding what to order. I ended up ordering the Caesar -- I know -- strange choice at a Mexican restaurant, but with the roasted pasilla chile strips, the cojita cheese crumbles and the roasted garlic vinaigrette, combined with the freshness of the ingredients, it did not disappoint. I also ordered the Sea Scallops with Quinoa Risotto. The presentation was beautiful, if that's important to you. I was worried this dish would be too rich, but it was not. Two large sea scallops were served over a small bed of the risotto and mushrooms... So while it was super flavorful and SLIGHTLY rich (as risotto always is), the texture and flavor of the risotto/mushroom was balanced by the delicateness of the sea scallops. It was SO yummy, and, it was really exactly the right sized portion. I guess neither of the items I ordered were Mexican! But I did order two Pacificos.. Those are Mexican!! Does that count? The atmosphere was really good too... except for the horrible pop music that was playing... Other than that it was quite cozy and inviting.

We considered all three locations, but opted for the Village location to be closer to bars after dinner. I'm so happy that we did! The entire experience at Toloache was great, and it ended up being the perfect birthday dinner.The Food: There were three of us, so we opted to share and eat tapas style. We started with the guacamole trio. It is a MUST TRY! Amazing. The price is a bit steep at $24, but I didn't regret it for a second. The Frutas (guac with mango and pomegranate!) and the Rojo were both to die for. We then shared the fish tacos, the quesadilla de huitlacoche y trufas (mushroom and truffles), and the hamachi ceviche. My boyfriend loved the quesadilla, but I thought the ceviche was the winner. Each dish was great though.The Drinks: The margaritas were all excellent, but to really have your mind blown, make sure to order the mezcalita cocktail with grilled pineapple and jalapeño. I wish I had one right now. So good! So good! So good!The Service: The service was the best part. Our server was patient through all of our annoying questions, gave great advice about what to order and once he heard it was my birthday, was sure that he and his servers gave me an appropriately embarrassing and totally fun birthday song and (delicious!) flan dessert. And, before we even mentioned my birthday, the manager Luis stopped by just to make sure that we were enjoying ourselves.

2.0,7/26/2014,I have eaten at the Toloache in the West 50's and loved it.  But dinner at the Greenwich Village outpost was mediocre.  I adore suckling pig but their version was as hard and dry as a hockey puck.  If the quesadilla contained the promised huitlacoche I would be very surprised.  Likewise the truffle.  It was just boring.  We decided to pass on dessert and got some very good baklava at Mamoun's.,0,1,0,Meche K.,"New York, NY",17,106,0

Some gluten free options for those who need (unmarked, but just ask).  I've brought people visiting town to this and the midtown location and it's always a hit.

My meal was the carne asada con queso tacos which consisted of 2 tiny tacos, think the size of the average persons palm, but AMAZING. A friend of mine ordered the shrimp quesadilla which Im told was phenomenal, but it was open faced (unexpected) and also very small. This place is awesome for a special occasion (a bit on the pricey side) or if you want both an appetizer and dessert but dont usually have room for both! My only real complaint is that the service was really slow, we waited for quite awhile before our order was taken and drinks brought out, id say around 30 min, then another 30 min for the food.

4.0,6/7/2014,"I had been meaning to try this place for a long time, as the Greenwich Village incarnation popped up about 6 months ago. It did not disappoint!I will start with the service, we were greeted politely and seated promptly by the open doors on the side of the restaurant, which was perfect for the lovely night . I believe in life it's all about the little things, and they were extremely attentive. Probably what comes to mind the most, was when my brother went to the bathroom and left his napkin unfolded over his plate. A worker (manager?) swooped in more slyly then batman and folded it neatly up, before dashing away. That's some obsessive compulsive attention to detail. Our waiter was friendly and the bus boy when he over heard me practicing my spanish asked if I wanted desert in espanol and it only took him 3 more times repeating it slowly for me to figure that out!On to the actual food and drinks. The mild guacamole was very respectable, although I still like Dos Caminos's (on Houston) version better. The salsa on the other hand was a home run. It had a slight kick but had an outstanding tomato flavor that I've never had before. The chips were delicious to boot.I drank a Sol beer, you really can't go wrong with a Mexican cerveza in their own restaurant can you? My brother and our friend had margaritas, and they were very impressive!The reason I'm dropping this review to 4 stars was my entree (Pollo Toloache) while decent was not worth the price ($24). The chicken itself was a little bit on the dry side, although I can't complain about the sweet-corn pico de gallo salsa. Also the portion really isn't that big, so it was wise to munch on 2 separate baskets of chips.Overall, I'm still a fan of this place and will return, but I think I'm going to try another entree. Another note: I walked up stairs and they have some huge tables, so this could be a great spot for a party, large group get-together.",1,1,0,Jon B.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",165,417,3
4.0,6/7/2014,"The newest Mexican place in the area, so I had to swing by and give it a whirl!

The upper level up two flights is larger and more spacious, good for groups.I started with a frozen Strawberry margarita, which was pretty strong and had a great taste to it. It's perfect for a summer night. My table also split chips and mild Guacamole, which hit the spot. The chips were crunchy and the Guac was tasty, even the free tortilla sauce was actually pretty good.For my main course, I got the  Pollo Toloache which was cooked in a nice cheese and pinto bean dip. The Sweet corn-pico de gallo dip was great, my only complaint was that the actual chicken tasted just ""so-so"".The service was very good, and the manager and waiters kept checking up on us, which I found refreshing.

5.0,5/3/2014,"I love Toloache. Friendly, down to earth service, outstanding food and delicious drinks. We went for dinner early Saturday night. The restaurant is cozy but airy when the weather is accommodating. First the drinks. I had the Mezcalita de Piña - spicy and smoky with a hint of sweet from grilled pineapple and perfectly made. I also enjoyed the Meloncita - habenero infused tequila - yum. We ordered the guacamole which was very tasty and fresh. Warm tasty chips as well. For the mains we had the Quesadilla Huitlacoche y Trufas (manchego, black truffle, corn, huitlacoche salsa) which was thin, crisp, lightly but satisfactorily cheesy and nicely truffled. SO GOOD. Then we had the tacos - Langosta (spicy lobster, avocado, morita salsa) and Suadero (Bohemia braised brisket, red onion, avocado, tomatillo salsa, cilantro, horseradish crema). Both were outstanding and bursting with flavor although they were small but that locked in the flavor. For desert we had the upside down banana cake with negro modello ice cream which was warm, sweet, well presented and simply hit the spot. They've got a great mescal list and beers as well.

Like the huitlacoche and truffle quesadille: awesome. The guacamole and the salsa are also well done - never to be under-estimated. The braised short rib tacos were amazing.

The churros were delicious and the caramel flan was too sweet & unsubtle. The piña mezcal cocktail again was good but not great. It needed a more powerful acid to balance the gasoline-y mezcal. I did like the chili rim. I liked it but didn't love it like mezcal cocktails elsewhere. For those prices, there are so many better restaurants downtown. I just don't see what the hype is about. My waiter refused to give me a separate check from the group even though I had to leave early. He said he'd check with the manager but ended up handing a check to the whole group.

5.0,1/23/2014,"This place has been on my radar because a coworker of mine who lives on the UES frequents this place and raves about the food every single time. He is a fellow foodie, and I do trust his opinion, but going to the UES for mexican was just never on my itin. Mexican in NYC is never good, so trekking to the UES for it, um yeah...no. So when I saw that Toloache opened a downtown location, I decided I would give it a shot. All i have to say is FINALLY!! A Mexican Restaurant in NYC that is worthy of our time. Hey @immaculateinfat, get on this #asap. Met a girlfriend for dinner on a snowy Wednesday night and besides being excited to see her, I was really excited for this meal. I obvs spent time on the menu during my work day and we may or may not have gchatted about what we were going to get. I decided I wasnt drinking so cant comment on the bevvies but they did look goood. We started with the Toloache Cesear salad which was excellent. Lettuce was crunchy, dressing was garlicy and well dispersed, this salad was on point.(Disclaimer, this friend doesn't really eat raw fish or lobster so next time I go back, I am going to order totally different things). Next we got the truffle quesadilla and added short rib. Great decision-this quesadilla was served open face and was very tasty. You are probably wondering why we didn't get the guac sampler but in my opinion, guac is guac is guac and there were so many other things to try. At this point, had there been another person with us, we would have gotten the guac-but not this time around. Next up was the Seared sea scallops served on top of quinoa risotto with porcinimushroom and huitlacoche butter(whatever that is). I NEED TO EAT THIS EVERYDAY for the rest of my life. It was everything I could hope for and more. As our final course, we got the shrimp tacos and the tequila miso glazed cod. I am a sucker for miso cod and this did not dissapoint. It was actually amazing. Better than, dare I say it, nobu's. I SAID IT. and I mean it. Served atop a bed of corn and mushrooms, YUM. Oh, i almost forgot about the brussel sprouts. Probably unneccessary as I was extremely full but they were topped with cotija cheese so I just couldnt resist. Toloache is going to be really hard to get a reservation at, you heard it here first people. They have 3 NYC locations, do yourself a favor and make a resso- ASAP. and ps-they have a private dining room upstairs- im just saying, perfect for a birthday dinner.",6,2,1,Brooke S.,"Manhattan, NY",86,43,5
