3.0,5/1/2019,"The views from this place are no doubt gorgeous, but it costs money just to sit, and the food is buffet style which is a major turn off for anything considered a romantic dinner.

4.0,5/1/2019,"So we meandered up here on our first night in the city. It's only accessible from the 3rd floor of the hotel with a horribly slow elevator system. We were seated promptly with a window table. The lounge revolves around so you get a great view, hence the name, especially at night. Their cocktail napkins map out the sights. The service was pretty meh. My mom asked our server twice for a water and it never came. Her wine did though!  It had been a long day of airline travel and it was close to 11:30 pm so I settled for a delightful ginger ale with two long stemmed cherries. We hadn't seen each other in a while and we were not rushed out. We stayed an hour or so long enough to revolve once. The service might have been better had we ordered more but that's really never an excuse for poor service. Our waitress was obviously tired and worn out from the day. We'll cut her a break this time. Get some rest Denise and we will be back!",0,0,0,Jeannine M.,"Littleton, CO",0,313,539

2.0,4/19/2019,"Ok, yes we had to do the tourist thing and had dinner in The View. The food was fine. The wine list was ok. But service and noise level was terrible. Everybody and their brother was here tonight. We were told by the hotel it was a classy place but did not require a tie. Needless to say everything goes in The View. We saw cutoff shorts, warmup suits or whatever you wanted to wear. For an upscale location they don't enforce anything. Took us 20 minutes to get seated even though we had a reservation while people with no reservations were being called with beepers. Two hours later and were still waiting for desserts.  Buyer beware.",0,1,0,Phillip F.,"Smithfield, VA",7,37,31

5.0,4/11/2019,I had an amazing time there. Let me say that after reading only the negative comments on Yelp instead of the good ones. I was ready for the worst experience of my life but sometimes you need to give pple a second chance and learn from your experience. I invited my wife and few of her friends there for her birthday diner. Everyone from the lobby to the top floor was polite and well mannered. The food our server recommended was good( they definitely need better food on d menu) but the pastry was top notch( something a camera lens would not be able to accurately describe.) I cannot remember the name of our server but when I do I'd let you know. With her we felt in good hands. She really put her heart into her job(she should be promoted). The view is nice as the we slowly moved in circle. I recommend it.,0,0,0,Moussey M.,"Staten Island, NY",3,15,0

So pretty and we had Tracey as our waitress, she was great and very accommodating!We stayed in this restaurant from 4pm to 8pm and enjoyed some really cool well made drinks!We did not eat since we had eaten prior to going to the view.What was really cool about this restaurant is that it's on a rotating setup, in an hour you get to see all the different sides of NYC! It's simply beautiful. The place is very cozy and enjoyable.Definitely will go back there on my next NYC visit! Thank you Tracey for great hospitality!A place to remember for sure!

4.0,4/4/2019,"Nice view and good service.  It's located on 47th and 48th floor inside the Marriott Marquis hotel.  We had the three course prix-fixe and the portion is big.  New England style crab cake is very good but the Classic New York Strip steak is just ok.  We also had the Foie Gras Ganache and the Pacific Cod.  Both are good too.  All the dessert we had were very good especially the Green Apple.  Wine is very pricey.    We are party of 2 but the waiter added the 18% gratuity on the bill already, so you should pay attention to check the bill before you add the gratuity.",1,0,1,Ken C.,"New York, NY",1,31,441
5.0,4/3/2019,"I went for my birthday dinner. We did the pre-fix menu & service is included!! I would recommend the clam chowder soup it was really flavorful or the beef ravioli for appetizer. The entree, I wasn't in love with the lamb but the couscous it came with was great and the hen was dry. The lobster mac and cheese side was really creamy loved it! The truffle mashed potato was kind of cold and bland. The birthday chocolate fudge cake they give (off the pre fix menu) was amazing. I liked it better than the dessert options they had.",0,0,0,A I.,"Queens, NY",0,6,1

1.0,3/22/2019,"Pros: The bar spins. Cons: Everything else.My wife and I brought my father-in-law here, who was visiting us from abroad, tonight. We were excited, as he'd requested us take him here as he'd gone back in 2009. We arrived and the hosts were nice. They sat us and we were greeted by a server, Mizanur (which is what it says on my receipt) about 5-7 minutes later.We ordered water, then glanced at the menu. We didn't know it was prix fixe, and there was no indication that everyone at the table had to do it, so we asked our server if one of us could do it and the rest of us order entrees. His response? ""The buffet is upstairs.""From then on out, I knew it wasn't going to be great.It took 15 minutes for him to return. We ordered a bottle of wine. He sent over a supporting staff member to serve it and pretended to be busy.In their defense, the supporting staff came over frequently to clear our plates and were quite nice. Our server was nowhere to be found a majority of the time.We finished our meal and asked for the check. When we were given it, we saw that he had ADDED GRATUITY. There was 3 of us and no reason to do that. The menu clearly stated parties of 6 or more.For what it's worth, he is an absolute moron for doing that. Not only was he inappropriate enough to add a tip to a bill he had no right to touch when his service was so bad, but he shortchanged himself. He gave himself a 15 percent tip. I would've tipped him 18%, which is the minimum I give for absurdly bad service. Jokes on you, bro.When I flagged it to the manager, she offered to remove the tip but did not apologize. I told her about his buffet comment, and she, quite inappropriately, seemed to defend him. All I can say is, don't go here... especially if you want good service without a forced tip. Not worth it, especially if they're as rude as Mizanur.",1,0,0,Suzanne D.,"New York, NY",4,21,0
3.0,3/20/2019,"I came here for my birthday and the wait was ridiculous . I had a 7:30 reservations and they made it clear I had to come earlier I got there by 7pm did not get seated until 9. The Decour and atmosphere is very beautiful but honestly paying that much money for the amount of food that I did not receive was ridiculous. Mind you i did  a prefix menu. My date and I did not even stay for dessert because we've literally had between both of us six pieces of pasta, and a lot of leafy foods and still was starving . It's a nice place to go for a look but food wise it's really not worth it.

2.0,3/13/2019,"We paid two visits to the View Lounge during our stay in NYC as we were staying at the hotel - once we stayed, enjoyed the view and a drink and tolerated the mediocre service just for the views - we had a beer and a champagne and with window seating enjoyed the views the slow revolve provided.Service was painfully slow - about 15 minutes to get served and about the same to get a tab but on the second time we could not tolerate it. We only returned as it was our last night and we wanted to show our kids that view . The waitress eventually turned up and all but threw some menus at us while she slurred that she would she would be  back - completely incoherent I have no clue what was going on other than the fact that she never did return so we saw it as a lucky escape from the rather unappealing drink list and overwhelming smell of the buffet food and took off having got out full of the city views !In a nutshell, food is buffet style and smells like it, service is slow and drinks are inspired by the early 90s. See the view then head out",3,0,1,Sam P.,"San Antonio, TX",15,227,601
5.0,3/13/2019,"Talk about a great experience! The View was such a great idea for a beautiful NYC Friday night dinner. For it being my first time in the city, I couldn't be any happier to have dinner here at The View. It takes about 60 minutes to do a full rotation around the city, but my goodness are the views breathtaking! You also get a nice little walk through Times Square. Staff: The staff is very friendly and professional. Wait time was less than 5 minutes with a reservation. You will always get a window view, however, there are a few tables that are more in the middle of the restaurant, but the staff understands you want a window seat. Our waiter was great. He was personable and available. I cant think of anything he did wrong.Food: The food was great! Given I am a pescetarian, there were options for me + vegetarian options and of course options for meatatarians. The food portions were not small, you get your money worth. The flavor was phenomenal. The way the courses are organized was very impressive. I did not feel over stuffed even though I ate the entire time! Very impressed. The dessert also was so yummy! For my appetizer, I ordered the New England style Crab Cake. This was my first time actually even trying crab cakes and OMG IT WAS SO GOOD! It was pan roasted jumbo lump cake, cajun style remoulade topped with piquillo pepper cream. My main course, I ordered the Atlantic Salmon. Impressed! It was also pan roasted Atlantic Salmon served on black beluga lentils with roasted baby artichokes and asparagus, finished with a blood orange glaze. MOUTH WATERING! & finally for dessert, I ordered the Cheese Plate. This cheese was divine! I love cheese and was very interested in trying what this restaurant was offering, I was highly impressed.Great wine selection by the way! Dont miss out!

2.0,3/4/2019,"We made reservations and we should of only gone for drink in the lounge. If you make a reservation for the restaurant know that it has a set price of $89 per person. I wouldn't mind paying that price for a set course meal but the food and service was subpar. We went to a steakhouse earlier in the week and had steak with shrimp and a glass of wine for $35. That steak melted and the flavor was out of this world. The steak at the view was tough and tasted horrible. The server treated us like we were trash off the street. I have been to many high end restaurants and never got this kind of horrid service. We always leave a good no matter the service but this waiter made sure we knew how much a 15% tip was before he left our table. Never been so annoyed! I wouldn't never recommend this place for the food but if you would like the experience the view, go to the lounge and order drinks.

The restaurant has a prix-fixe dinner menu which is $89 per person and includes an appetizer, main course, and dessert. The service, food, and ambiance are always spectacular. My server both times was very knowledgeable about which buildings were within view as well as had some great conversations with us. My mother, who is vegetarian, loves eating here as they do have some very tasty veg options. I highly recommend getting a reservation, especially if you wish to dine here during sunset at night, at least a few days in advance. Both times I have eaten here is has been around sunset when Times Square is really lighting up.

She did not ask for our server's name and tried to make it better by offering us a round of drinks on our next visit.

1.0,2/14/2019,"Yes this place has a beautiful and unique view of the city, but the overall experience will make it not worth going to. I have never had such horrible, rude service in my whole life. From the second we walked in we were pushed aside, made wait when we had a reservation, and the waiter was the rudest of all. We went for restaurant week, and he almost forced us to buy the expensive prixe-fix menu over the restaurant week menu. Then, once we got our way and got the restaurant week menu, he tried pushing us to do all the upgrades to make it more expensive. When we refused that and refused alcoholic beverages, he made nasty remarks to others in the restaurant loud enough for us to hear- basically calling us cheap. NO CUSTOMER SHOULD BE TREATED THAT WAY. Such a horrible way to run business. Oh, and the food was less than mediocre.

5.0,2/8/2019,2nd time here. Got treated to an early Bday dinner. I visited this location many years ago but remember having a great experience and went in with good expectations and they did not disappoint. Appetizer. Crab cakes and gnocchi. 1st of all. I think gnocchi is crap. Boiled fried potato balls. Why? Idk. Anyway. 1 word to describe theCrab cake: Divine. Delicious lump crab meat. Not too much sauce or fillers like some places. Absolutely A1. My heart was warm and fuzzy after that. Main course. Filet mignon and the snapper honestly... I've had better steak. And I've certainly had better snapper. But the dish was really good. And after hitting the snapper with some sriracha it came alive. I had to try the lobster Mac and cheese and this was really what closed the deal for me. At first I was thinking 4 stars but after the Mac n cheese 5 was solidified. Big pieces of lobster. I had a giant claw looking at me when it arrived. Just off the charts. Desert. Chocolate something. Again not really great.... but by then I was already full. Great wine list. Just a really nice place.

2.0,2/2/2019,"We came for restaurant week for the 360 rotation view experience. The idea of a 360 rotation restaurant is pretty cool and intriguing. It was a whole adventure actually getting to the restaurant as you have to go into the Marriott, pass the theater area up specific elevators and then the receptionist upstairs will tell u to go down to the elevator to be seated in the usual area. It wasn't dull tho, quite enjoyable and not hard as there were people guiding us the whole time. When we got seated, near the windows of course, we noticed the restaurant started rotating little by little. Supposedly, it takes an hour for a full 360 degree rotation, but it seems like it takes longer to rotate. The restaurant rotates the outer donut shape only. So the bathroom location, located in the inside circle seems to move as you technically are the one moving. This is a really slow and captivating experience perfect for a date or long conversations. You definitely can't rush this. Occasionally, the view isn't flattering as the circular restaurant is located in a rectangular building so your view is obstructed by columns. The food is mediocre and not worth the price, but you're really paying for the access of a 360 degree rotating dinner experience.",1,0,0,Nicole N.,"Brooklyn, NY",198,165,193

5.0,12/27/2018,"I quite enjoyed myself here. I went for brunch on my birthday which fell on a Sunday. We had mimosas in which each person was limited to 2 each and there was a breakfast/brunch buffet which is self serve. The restaurant rotates and rotates slowly. The seating areas/sections have some sort of assignment which makes it easier for you to find where you were. There were different sections and pretty good variety with the food. There were things like omelets, fruit, pancakes, pastries, salads (pasta, quinoa etc.). They gave me a little chocolate cake since it was my birthday. The view was amazing....you get to see the statue of liberty, Time Square and things like that.

1.0,12/27/2018,Service is extreme slow. We almost made it one full rotation and the server only came by once.

4.0,12/26/2018,"This was fun, haven't gone for several years. Drinks are very $$$$ but you do get excellent drinks and well worth it for a treat or occasion. The only thing i would say was a negative was the decor. I mean for $20 or so a drink it shouldn't look like a cruise ship. The bathrooms are a dump and, God, the aggressive-for-tips-Indian-guy-bathroom-attendant was too pushy for my taste. I did have to make 3 trips since i had 3 drinks :) All in all, a spinning bar with a pretty OK view and worth the extra green.",1,0,1,Jill m.,"Manhattan, NY",15,15,0
5.0,12/21/2018,"So...ever since I was a kid, I always wanted to go to one of those revolving restaurants.  Now finally I got to one---time to check that off the bucket list!We're Marriott Rewards members and used points to stay at the Marriott Marquis.  When we checked in, we were given a card that said we get a $35 voucher for food and/or drinks at any of the hotel restaurants (except places like Starbucks since Marriott doesn't own that).  Right away, I knew we would use that voucher at The View.We were here on a Monday evening around 9 p.m.  They have a dress code that says ""dressy jeans"".  Well...our jeans are in no way ""dressy"" but we did pack some khakis which we wore.  Getting to The View isn't very straightforward.  You have to go to the 3rd floor where you get an elevator that is an express to The View.We were greeted upon arrival and asked if we were coming for a drink or the buffet.  We told them we were here for a drink.  Then we were taken to a two top right by the window.  They have a drink menu that features a few mixed drinks.  Be aware that their drinks are pricey.  The espresso martini I ordered was $19.  My husband got a gin and tonic which, I believe, was about $2 less.  We told our very friendly and efficient server that we had the voucher.  With the voucher, you don't pay the server.  Rather, you give him/her your room number and it gets charged to your room.  That voucher was awesome.  We ended up paying only a few dollars (I forget the exact amount but I remember how impressed we were).  We gave our server her tip in cash.It takes an hour for the restaurant to make a full 360 degree rotation.  We just nursed our drinks for that hour and nobody minded.  There was no pressure to order another drink.  Our server did check on us from time to time to see if we wanted to order another.We had a great time enjoying the view.  The outside of the place revolves while the center remains stationary.  We were seated as our spot came upon the west side where we saw the Hudson River and NJ.  The highlight for us was seeing the Chrysler building which remained in view quite clearly for a few minutes.  As for the Empire State building---if you blink, you will miss it.  It's hidden behind a large building and you can only quickly glimpse it.  Looking south, there is a small area where you can glimpse the FiDi.  Still---we have no complaints.  The NYC nighttime skyline is always awesome to view!We were close to finishing up the complete rotation when the server told customers that it would be last call for drinks.  No one was made to feel like they had to leave right away.I highly (no pun intended) recommend going to The View and see Manhattan from the 48th floor!  It's very well worth it.",74,35,65,Susan H.,"Reston, VA",457,688,1316

5.0,12/17/2018,"The View is an amazing restaurant!  It was my girlfriends birthday and I wanted to do something different, so after making reservations- we arrived, and went 48 stories UP.  Upon checking in- and arriving a bit early, we went up to the Lounge for drinks and a meat and cheese platter.  The drinks were excellent- no complaints at all.  The platter consisted of Prosciutto, some salami, a variety of cheese, brie and olives.Shortly after we were paged and proceeded downstairs to the Dining level.  We had the Braised Wagyu Beef Ravioli and the crab cake, both equally amazing in presentation and taste!  For the main we both had the New York Strip, gruyere potato au gratin, roasted brussels sprouts with pancetta and vine tomatoes,  finished with a smoky caramelized cipollini onio... all to die for!Dessert was equally amazing.  I ordered a dessert that was a cornucopia of different tangy flavors that took me back and forth reeling, and only complimented the glass of Jack that I had been enjoying all along.  All this while the restaurant slowly rotated, allowing everyone a 360' view of NYC.  .....well done, well done!",1,0,0,Lawrence D.,"New York, NY",46,127,47
4.0,12/16/2018,"So, I am updating my review to be more accurate, forgiving the elevator delay.  While I felt the managers response was minimal. I hate holding a grudge so, I don't. Just give yourself 10 extra minutes at least to get out of the building if you need the elevator. I thought 20 minutes was enough time and it was not. Try a half hour (to get  to the street level, just in case)  if you have trouble with steps because the elevator can cause a delay.  12/16/18 ValOld review: On November 3rd, we came for dinner and a show for my son's birthday.  I would love to be able to give this restaurant a 4-5 stars review but..The food was delicious. Great sauces and a nice menu having something for vegetarians, people needing gluten-free food and carnivores, like me. I had the surf and turf both cooked perfectly and delicious. The sides were great (family style) and unique as well as the usuals.  Do yourself a favor and don't skip desert!  I think our table of six had every desert on the menu and everyone licked their plates!  Yummy!  Table service was great also. The rotating floor and the views are breathtaking.  If you can be there at sunset, you get a very dramatic show as the sun sets.  And the movement is not noticeable.  The floor moves very slowly and it is not at all disturbing. Instead it is fascinating and beautiful. Nice decor. Very clean and comfortable.  One problem, since we own a lighting design firm, they need new updated lighting. Especially the track lighting on the walls that play a huge part in the effect since there are short times when the view is blocked by buildings (2 times?) and the lighting makes the wall visible in the windows so you're not looking at a blank building and invisible when there is a view. NOW, THE REASON I GAVE YOU A 2 STAR RATING....I have very bad knees (both replaced) and ankles, making climbing stairs very painful.  When you get to the restaurant, the elevator ride, (glass encased elevator), is very exciting.  Don't face the window if heights or roller coasters are a problem for you!  You arrive on the 48th (?) floor and have to walk down a circular staircase to get to the restaurant.  Very painful for me but down is easier than up, plus it can be embarrassing to ask for a special elevator ride.   At the end of dinner we got up from our table at 7:40 because we had 8pm tickets for the show across the street at the Minskoff. I chose to ask them to take me up in the elevator they had for the handicapped at about 7:45.  At 7:55, after telling the host and hostess that I was still waiting for the 3rd time, I opted, unhappily, to struggle, painfully, up the stairs rather than be later for the show.  Thinking the entire time what a shame it was that after a perfect meal with my family, costing us about $1000 for 6, (and we don't drink much at all), that the only problem was that I had to PAINFULLY struggle up a flight of stairs rather than ride an attended elevator that would take me up one flight!  When you charge that much for a meal the staff should make darn sure the entire experience is as close to perfect as possible. Seeing 3 staff people standing around the host station as I waited anxiously, did not help.  They were polite and called 3 times for the elevator attendant.  After I limped up the stairs a staff person said ""Oh, I just went down to get you.  I had to wait for the elevator.""  I'm not sure how the elevators are programmed but being in construction my husband's private response to that was ""bull sh... they can easily fix that."" No one should have to wait 10 minutes for an elevator.  We had sent our adult children across to the theater so they would be on time for the curtain, but for me, it put a real damper on what was otherwise a perfect dining experience.  It's a real shame to spend that much on a dinner to have it end on a painful and frustrating note. People with handicaps should not be treated with so little regard and care!  Once we paid the bill and tipped generously, I felt as though your staff felt I was unimportant. In spite of their politeness and apologies, I felt embarrassed, frustrated and disrespected.I am happy to adjust this review once I see a response from your management.  I felt it was important that management know that there is a problem with your way of handling this issue, especially in the theater district before 8pm when most curtains go up!  Please respond and I will adjust my rating and hopefully feel much better about the experience at your beautiful, unique and convenient restaurant! Thank you and sorry for the length.Valerie H.",0,0,0,Valerie H.,"Medford, NJ",0,16,0

3.0,12/10/2018,"I'm somewhere in between loving this place and hating this place. I mean, it's a rotating restaurant, right? It's amazing. But that's kind of were the lure of this place ends unfortunately. The food is really expensive, which I would not complain about had it been amazing food. For instance, my daughter (a toddler) had a kid's size portion of pasta with just butter and it was $30. Our waitress asked if we wanted sparkling water or still water and I responded that regular was fine, assuming that she meant tap. Nope. We ended up paying $40 just for water. I felt like the way she worded the question was kind of a set up although other than that she was pretty nice. Now, I know to make sure to clarify in the future. I ordered the surf and turf and have had this at many places before both high and low end, and they missed the mark. Also, the surf and turf was an additional $23 on top of the mandatory three course price of $89. The steak had no flavor although very tender and the lobster was just a pool of butter. The only thing I liked was the side of brussel sprouts and my mango smoothie drink. As for the view, I went at night. As a New Yorker, I've had better views at other restaurants and bars.

Okay, we understand it's a Friday night in Manhattan. The lounge was packed but we were able to get a table within 10 minutes. We thought we'd be able to just hang at a bar and grab a drink, but it appears to be all sit down lounge seating. The revolving concept is pretty neat. Our waitress wasn't very friendly and it took forever to put in our drink order (but pretty quickly to actually get our drinks). As expected, the drinks were incredibly overpriced (paying for that revolving view), but I was actually pleasantly surprised with the alcohol content in the drinks.

I will definitely go back when I am in the city again. I believe it takes about an hour to do a full rotation. You get a ""Mapkin"" that shows different landmarks that you'll see along the way. Your server will tell you where you're at when you first begin. I was told The Hudson Yard is a newer building so it isn't on the current napkins. The two servers who helped us were very knowledgeable about the city. Your brunch comes with choice of one glass of champagne or two mimosas. I chose just the champagne and they gave our table a generous pour (a full glass)! :)The buffet was so delicious. I loved the bacon, omelet bar, the squash they had, desserts, etc. The buffet sections are split into three different areas, so I made three stops and had a little something from each area.  The city is so busy and can be so crowded -- it's the city that never sleeps -- so it was so nice to be up and away looking out into the view while enjoying a great meal.",1,0,1,Natasha D.,"Marina, CA",208,56,97

We were hungry, so we were eager to be seated.The views are not impressive unfortunately. We went for restaurant week, and started with the octopus - or should I say what octopus? I know it was baby octopus, but we literally got one peace. I don't care how much decoration, ink, or arugula you put on the plate, one teeny piece of octopus is NOT okay!For the main course, I went with the steak, and my husband upgraded for the filet mignon. I'm pretty sure my regular steak was better than his! Steak came with potatoes and carrots, which are literally the same I buy in BJ's. Also - my potatoes and carrots were pretty hard. Carrots I ate, but I couldn't do the hard potatoes.We also got the lobster mac and cheese - EW! not sure what cheese they use, but it was bitter and all kinds of wrong. I had to return it which was a shame - we subbed for the crab cake, which I wasn't impressed with either.The part of our night was probably our waiter, Luis, from Ecuador.

5.0,8/7/2018,"I made reservations here for the first time to celebrate my lovely lady's birthday. This beautiful restaurant sits on the 49th floor of the Marriott Marquis hotel. Dinner in the reserved section is a 3 course prix-fixed menu. The main attraction to this particular restaurant is that the floor revolves and shows you a 360 degree view of the Times Square area. We had two servers who were both very accommodating and very nice. Our reservation was for 5:00 because we had tickets to see Wicked at 8:00pm. I mention that because I'm sure the ambiance is much more romantic in the evening overlooking the Time Square skyline which we were unable to see. Nonetheless the experience was magical. We ordered their signature drink ""The View"" and I highly recommend you try it. For dinner she had the Filet Mignon and I had the Lamb Shank. We both enjoyed our meals very much. We took our time enjoying our food and never felt rushed to leave. We actually spent 2 hours there enjoying the food and each other's company. For dessert we both ordered the cheesecake with strawberries, however they also surprised her with a mini chocolate birthday cake which she took home with her. The food was so good it nearly evoked a coma. We quickly asked for an antidote...coffee and was able to find the strength to leave.

2.0,7/30/2018,"The only reason this place should get stars is the location. It is cool to be up high in a revolving restaurant, being able to see all of Manhattan.Even the decor on the inside of the restaurant, though, was lacking (the carpet that looked like it was from the 80's, for one). It is very clearly a restaurant in a hotel (it's located in a Marriott). It's pretty confusing to get to as well.My friend and I went for Restaurant Week, so I suppose it's possible we got less than average quality food because of that. However, the price was still in the $$$ range, and it was not a deal whatsoever. The vegetables with the main course looked like they had been cooked at least a day ago, the steak was decent but I've had way better for less, and the dessert (sorbet) looked like it was straight from a container. The drinks were ~$20, which is expensive even for NYC standards (the drinks were good, strong, but very small). We had a nice time because of the view, and each other's company, but that's pretty much it. The only other positive was that the staff was nice and the service was quick.

4.0,6/22/2018,"Went here with a friend and I'm really glad he took me- it really is a lovely place (despite some qualms, will get to that later). The place itself is beautiful BUT definitely do yourself a favor and go in the nighttime. It's not half as pretty as it is in the nighttime just like any skyline is to be honest. The place rotated very slowly (which is obviously a good thing) but you can tell that you're moving. The funny part is that the male and female bathrooms are on two polar ends so whenever I went to the bathroom it was either the first door I saw in the middle of the restaurant or the last door (probably didn't explain that right but if you ever visit this place you'll know what I mean).We got the 3-course prix fixe that I believe was a little under $100 per person. Yes that's pricey but I think on occasion it's worth it (depending on the place of course)! Anyways, for the appetizer I got the crab cake. Seriously, SO good. Perfect size and everything- loved it and can't say anything bad about it. For the entree I got the braised lamb shank. To be honest if the appetizer and dessert weren't delicious, I would've given this place three stars. The portion was great, way more than adequate. However, the lamb shank itself lacked any real flavor in my honest opinion. The couscous didn't help adding to the flavor either. I can't inherently say that the meal tasted bad, but one can't say that a flavorless meal tasted good. For the dessert I got the profiteroles. Whenever a restaurant has profiteroles, I am most definitely ordering them because 1. Hard to mess up and 2. Typically always delicious (as they are hard to mess up lol). Profiteroles are typically a cream puff with vanilla ice cream drizzled with chocolate sauce BUT this place has a variation on the classic recipe which I ended up surprisingly enjoying a lot. The two major changes were dulce de leche sauce versus chocolate sauce and a raspberry-based cream puff versus the traditional plain one. I thought I would either hate it or love it and I definitely loved it- get this!!! The service was as expected (great, couldn't complain) and overall, I'm glad my friend took me here. To be frank I thought maybe the food would completely be a miss as I know the place is very touristy but overall I can't say I was disappointed.

3.0,5/1/2018,"Overall: I'm conflicted between amazing views hence the perfect name and subpar food for the price. Price is comparable to a 2-3 Michelin star restaurant; however food is not there.Hence, I think the lounge for drinks would be the best alternative to enjoying a nice view with a small bite rather than a 3 course meal or buffet. Atmosphere: beautiful views as you can see from pictures. Definitely perfect if you enjoy being within the New York City skyline, slowly cruising with views of the Hudson, East River, and everything perfect in between . Food:Okay- there is definitely better especially for the price. Again I really think you're paying to sit and admire the city skyline for a few hours rather than a  top notch food experience. Bread- standard - could definitely be more fresh, at least heated. 1st course foie gras - sweet pineapple twist, standard taste , side pita chip? cracker? Would pair with something more complementary like fresh warm bread.2nd course- Duo chicken with confit. Delicious , juicy paired with steamed carrots and spinach. Spinach is a bit salty. Good.3rd course - I got a cheese board- 5 pieces , was good... it's hard to mess up cheese boards... and served with crackers... could be more fresh. Service: water filled in a timely manner.

My wife and I tried to come up with a restaurant that had worse food.It wasn't one dish, it was literally everything. On the bright side, we had fun daring each other to try things and enjoyed the locks of astonishment from other tables when they got their food.The service wasn't rude but they didn't really care. We didn't complain but our waiter who didn't really have a personality didn't acknowledge that we barely ate and didn't come close to touching either side dish. The interior is very tired looking as well (for those who care about décor.)Without a doubt, if you are looking for this kind of experience, go to an observatory where the views are way better and either catch some pizza and save some money or go to a nice restaurant where you get what you pay for!",0,0,0,Ricky B.,"Syosset, NY",0,1,0

4.0,4/7/2018,"This was an amazing experience for our first dinner in NYC! We did not have a reservation so we were given the choice of small plates ($21 for shrimp cocktail, charcuterie board, etc) or the buffet for $40/person. We chose the buffet. I had a champagne-tini and my boyfriend had a jack & coke. The buffet was amazing. Tons of options- pasta, salad, quinoa salad, root veggie salad, Asian noodle salad, cinnamon chickpea salad, rolls, and more. (There were meat options that my bf loved, but I'm vegetarian so I don't know what they were sorry!) Of course there were bunch of mini desserts and a chocolate fountain.

I can see why people give some bad reviews, window seats are about everything in this place, but you're not guaranteed even with reservation, so I would say make an early reservation and show up ON TIME - cuz there will be a lot of people checking in! Which probably is the only thing that made me gave it a 4.5 star... friendly staff, but checking people in is somehow really slow....otherwise it would be a 5 star experience.

5.0,4/5/2018,"This is certainly on of the most atmospheric restaurants in the City of New York. Where else in the city can you indulge in a delicious meal, fifty floors up at a revolving restaurant? Due to the tragic end of Windows on the World, this is the only restaurant in Manhattan with a great view of the city, besides the Rainbow Room. But the View revolves, and Rainbow Room does not. Anyway, the actual restaurant has an elegant ambiance, and is perfect for a dinner before or after a show, for a romantic meal, or traditional Sunday brunch. The restaurant itself has two floors. The upper level is the cocktail lounge, where you can go without a reservation. The lower level is the main dining room. I strongly recommend a reservation, unless you would just like drinks. My first time here was after a performance of the Phantom of the Opera for my birthday. That was thoroughly enjoyable, and I must say, every other time has been excellent as well. The service is prompt and attentive, the waiters respond to every need. I would definitely recommend the steaks. They are tender and flavorful. You can even cut them with the butter knife! And the desserts are something else. My first time, I ordered the Black Forest cake and it was to die for. They also brought me chocolate cake for my birthday, and it was also impeccable. The dinner  menu itself is a three course prix-fixe, for $89, not bad considering the quality of the meal. And the best part? The glass elevator ride up to the restaurant itself. You check in on level three and go right up an express elevator. I strongly recommend this establishment to anyone, absolutely anyone who sets foot in the city of New York. You will not be amazed, you will be astounded. Try coming after a Broadway matinee. It puts the cap on a perfect evening. Or come before an evening show. It sets things off to a great start. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!",1,1,1,Matthew A.,"New York, NY",1,17,19
5.0,4/2/2018,"My boyfriend and i only had 1 week vacation in nyc and we wanted to eat somewhere special, since we haven't had the time to go on dates or even see each other often. I was able to make a reservation online and asked for a seat next to the window. they were so kind as to make that wish come true. it was a little confusing for us to find, since it wasn't clear to us that you had to go into a hotel building. anyway, the minute we got there, the service has been fantastic the whole time. one guy even spoke a little german and was very friendly. we had a fantastic view from our table and took our time to take a look at the menu. we were informed about the 3 course menu, which only costs $89pp  what a deal! as my boyfriend and i waited for our meals, they brought us cocktails (for me without alcohol). the food arrived shortly and didn't disappoint us. the waitress will also take a picture of you of the view behind you but we had bad luck and asked while a building was kinda blocking the view",1,1,1,P K.,"Lucerne, Switzerland",0,9,32
3.0,3/25/2018,"Interesting concept for a restaurant. My husband took me here for my 31st birthday after a co worker recommended this place. The restaurant is located on the 47th floor of the Marriott Hotel smack in the middle of Time Square. Needless to say, If you're driving, I suggest you park somewhere far away and just walk...if you're from the area, you know what a nightmare Getting through Time Square is. Anyway, since we had reservations, we were immediately sent up to the restaurant. If you don't have reservations, you can wait in line to grab some drinks and enjoy 'the view'. Unfortunately, even with reservations, we didn't get to sit by the window which is really where The View is. We were given a napkin with what we're seeing as the floor rotates 360 degrees. It takes an hour for a full rotation (slow rotations) and you get a view with all the skyscrapers, Times Square, Hudson River, etc. Enough about the restaurant, the service, I have to say, was great...considering there was only two of them in the area that I was seated at. While the waiter was busy, he still made sure my husband and I had everything we needed. I wish I could say the food was amazing, but it wasn't something I'd go back for anytime soon. We opted for the pre-fixe menu which was $89pp...this includes your appetizer, entree, and dessert. I started off with a kale salad..then the seafood paella and finished off with the Panna cotta. Kale salad- not really all kale. It was just a bed of veggies with pumpkin and pomegranate seeds. My seafood paella...was good. But I really only ate the seafood: two scallops, 4 shrimps, two large steamed clams, on a bed of funky looking rice?  The rice was way too oily for my liking and I really couldn't stomach it after seeing all the oil at the bottom of the plate. My dessert I had to go which was OVERLY sweet. It was a vanilla pudding with fresh fruits and some sweet honey sauce that was way too over the top. My husband got the lobster bisque to start, which was different....it was very liquidy to be lobster bisque and very salty. The sirloin steak he got came with an awesome side dish of a baked potato with Mac n cheese and bacon-I mean this was probably the best dish.Service wise I'd give a 5 star because there were only two of them waiting on at least 8-10 tables. Food and restaurant experience, I gave 3 stars because the views wasn't that amazing..from my view, seeing the top of skyscrapers and looking out the window like I was staring at others eating dinner didn't do it for me. It was a nice experience and very thoughtful of my husband to take me here. Unless you're sitting by the table (which I don't think you can request), you'd have to get up and walk to the window to see 'the view'. I'd probably come back here just for drinks..I might have a better chance at getting a seat by the window to actually enjoy the view.",7,3,6,Tiffany Y.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",145,222,393

Lobster bisque was too salty and tasted like it was pre made and just heated up before it was served to me. And my filet mignon was cooked terribly, I ordered it to be cooked medium. Also the mashed potatoes were HORRIBLE. How can a restaurant screw up mashed potatoes? Such a steep price for such bad food. The dessert was and the view were the only two things I enjoyed.

I explained about the inattentive service and untimeliness and she proceeded to tell me ""well, we advertise that the dining experience is approximately 2 hours, so you're just a bit over"".  I asked ""where was this advertised?""  She stated ""on our website""....I checked the entire website while still at the table....NO where did it speak of a 2 hour process.  So I brought it to her attention, and she stated ""oh, I meant open table's website"".  Again, I checked the entire website, with again NO 2 hour mention.  She offered to give us a free drink, but after sitting for 2+ hours, we were ready to go.   She then gave us a small discount on our bill.  When she came back with the check, we had even more conversation about the ""missing advertisement"" that she claimed.I COULD NOT BELIEVE that she blatantly lied, but I guess she did not expect me to check.  I was applauded to say the least.If you want to eat here, I suggest that you order your food to-go and eat in the comfort of your own home/room so you do not have to be concerned with the lackluster service.",0,0,0,Ty H.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,14,1

1.0,3/9/2018,"We went to the view lounge to have celebratory drinks for a friend that just got engaged in the dining literally 15 min before we were seated at a table. When the waitress came over she asked for our drink order but we were so excited getting the story from the soon to be bride that not everyone was ready. I asked for a glass of water and she said she would bring it AFTER we ordered drinks. Well I'm getting sick so I had no intention of drinking alcohol but my husband and I planned on buying several rounds for the bride and groom to be. She comes back and we give her the bride and groom order and I say I'm not drinking just water to which she responds ""it's a mandatory drink order per person so you can order bottled water."" I order a mint tea as does my husband and still ask again for a glass of water.  She then takes everyone else's order (8 of total) then proceeds to say it will be an $8  charge PER PERSON to just have a drink in the lounge. That was never told to anyone in the party and we said the couple just ate here and got engaged here and we are here to celebrate shouldn't that cover it and she asked to see the receipt for proof. Again we are there to celebrate and the couple is literally basking in their post engagement glow and they couldn't find their receipt. She then asks for their last name and says well that only covers the bride and groom. We decide to suck it up and not ruin their fun and just pay the charge to enjoy our drinks. Then to add insult to injury she then asks for a room number. We weren't staying their so she says she needs cash or a credit card to secure the table. I say is this because of what our table looks like( mix of black and white people) do you think we are just going to run off on the bill? and she said ""basically yes. My husband again not wanting to ruin our friend's night hands her his card and she says ""We are going to have to call and verify that there is enough to secure a $50 deposit down"". She said ""it's not my rule its a corporation it's their rules"" and my husband asked for his card back since that seemed like a ridiculous request just to order drinks. It was incredibly insulting and we have never been treated so rudely and so poorly before in our lives. EVERYONE at the table was fed up and offended by these overtly discriminatory policies and when the waitress walked away to fill our drink orders we packed up and left. The bride and groom did their best to keep a smile on their face and as we walked out our waitress saw us and didn't even make an attempt to apologize. Little did she know that I have done several events at this hotel and have spent north of $50k hosting large conferences and seminars. I have extreme purchasing power and this restaurant has forever lost my business and those of any clients I work with in the future due to their disgusting behavior.  If your policies are real then you need to be more upfront from the beginning and more courteous when explaining them. If they are not real then you have a lawsuit waiting to happen due to your prejudiced staff and you need to clean house immediately.

It would have been good to have a la carte option. My drink was refreshing and exactly like how I liked. The starter with pita, hummus, olives and eggplant was really good.

The portions were standard, not too big and not too small... filet was cooked perfectly and accompanying veggie/sauces were wonderful. We got 3 side dishes (mac+cheese and mushrooms were the best), and these were very generously sized - perfect for sharing amongst 3 hungry adults.Now, onto the view itself... the downstairs dining room rotates, which is really cool and great - but we are only on the 47th floor, so you're at eye level or below many of the other Times Sq high rise buildings and not the best views of midtown (Rock Center or ESB would be most pristine views)!!!

1.0,2/21/2018,"I literally paid $262 for the worst service EVER EVER EVER and food poisoning. I wanted to take my husband out for a late Valentine's Day celebration, I came across ""The View"" The pictures of the restaurant caught my attention and decided to look at the menu, seemed interesting and something my husband would enjoy. We got there and the MaitreD checked us in and said there was no tables by the window available and it was a 30-45 min wait. We decided to wait but noticed there was a lot of tables empty by the window... anyway I don't know how their sitting works but it was not a big deal, besides we were a bit late for our reservation. We waited upstairs at the lounge, nobody offered a drink or water... whatever... after 45 minutes we got seated. This is where the tragedy starts.The waitress was very sweet, unfortunately the service was SLOW, very very slow. She explained the menu, left and came back after 15mins asking for our orders. We ordered and by this time I was starving. The appetizers and drinks took about 30mins to get there, my husband had the kale salad which was just okay, my ravioli however was not. It was a ravioli with a sweet purée inside and a couple of pumpkin seeds, nothing special, I had one piece and couldn't have more of it, it was painful to eat. I decided to eat the complimentary bread and butter instead...For main-course my husband had the sirloin steak which again, had no flavor, it needed a lot of salt and seasoning. The only thing that helped was the chimichurri sauce. I had the filet mignon which was soft and not as bad, it was okay. Thankfully we ordered the potato with Mac n cheese which was the only thing I actually liked. NOW  this is were my experience got worst. We had been done with our drinks and food and nobody came to ask how it was or if we wanted another drink. It took so long for a person to come and clear the table when we were done with both courses we honestly were tired of waiting and wanted to leave without ordering dessert but decided to wait. Our waitress finally came and we ordered the dessert the chocolate gingerbread  pudding for my husband and cheesecake for me. As soon as I ordered I gave my waitress the card to settle the check, she asked if we wanted it after the dessert I kindly explained we needed to leave right after the dessert. She left and after 30 minutes the busboy came to give us the dessert menu and we told him we had ordered, that's when the waitress came and told us she was gonna check on the dessert and asked what we had ordered again (we knew she didn't put in the order) by this time I was already irritated and anxious to leave after all we had experienced and waited. We repeated the order and waited AGAIN. The check came of course before the dessert even got there. Now when we got the dessert  WE GOT THE WRONG ORDER! Are you kidding me? I brought it to her attention and she told my husband ""oh that's why I asked you again and you said the cherry basque cake""  I quickly intervened and told her that he said chocolate gingerbread pudding and even I repeated the order to her right after him to be clear. She told us to enjoy it and she would bring out the pudding, I was furious and just said we didn't want it anymore because we had to leave. She insisted but we were just sick of waiting for things and tired of them wasting our time. I took a look at the check to sign it and leave but when I did that I noticed the 18% gratuity was included I looked at the website and it says it's added to parties of 6 or more. I'm sorry but I know about the industry because I have worked in it for a long time and I understand sometimes you forget things and get busy. But for a $89   3 course prefix menu I expected a better service, maybe not the greatest but not this bad either. My tab came up to $262 now I would've spent a lot more if they came to ask if we wanted more drinks. It was by far the most ridiculous, comical and sad thing I've ever experienced in a restaurant, sorry but McDonalds probably has a better service. Now the perfect finale my husband missed a day of work because he got food poisoning! Bravo!  It sounds like a made up story because of how many things went wrong and how bad it was but I'm not making it up.

Amazing view from this slowly revolving restaurant. Service was good. We went for the price fix of $89 which will be more if you have a drink or two. Food was ok not the best I've ever had but an interesting selection. We had appetizers of shrimp cocktail, yellow tail tuna crudet, fried ravioli - all kind of small portions. Mains were salmon, braised lamb shank which everyone loved, seafood paella which was good. I had the filet mignon which was a bit over cooked even though I requested rare. The add on extras we had were baked potato with Mac and cheese. A little disappointing because it was dry.  The jumbo asparagus was delicious Desert seemed to  be everyone's favorite part.

The presentation was very nice, but the food should follow through from presentation to taste.I started off with the Lobster Bisque, my friend had the crab cake (+12). The crab cake was good because there was little to no breading so kudos to them for that. My lobster bisque was good as well, very rich and creamy consistency (not pictured). The bread they bring at the beginning was hard as a rock, honestly could've thrown mine in the microwave. For my second course I had the chicken (pictured) which was a huge breast and a few Brussels and fingerlings. The breast was overcooked, I know it's hard to get a huge breast to stay juicy but come on this is a nice restaurant. Also added a side of bacon Mac ($9), which needed a bit of salt but the bacon and little tomatoes on top provided this sweet and smoky taste, which I did like. For dessert I had the Pana Cotta which was very light and airy, not as decadent as I would've liked but a nice finish to the dry chicken.

We had pretty high expectations after seeing it's a rotating rooftop restaurant and is marked as $$$$ so we figured food would be top notch. We made reservations day before and the only time slot that was open was 930 so we took it. Atmosphere: The view was really nice, one of our favorite things of our evening here. The restaurant does rotate and you can see the surrounding buildings and areas. Luckily we had a good view for an hour and then visibility started to decrease to pretty much nothing but that's weather and nothing can be done about that. There was nice music and it's a good place for a date or special celebration. Food: we got to pick an appetizer, main entree and dessert. For my main entree I went with the filet mignon and my wife went with something of a seafood platter. We thought it was ok at best, definitely not worth $$$$! Our desserts were actually our favorite part of the meal, very delicious! Service: Our waiter was really nice and pleasant, no complaints there.

2.0,2/7/2018,"I came here with friends for the restaurant week event; this is not my first revolving restaurant since I have been plenty of times to the one in San Antonio, TX I was here to experience the food and a little bit to enjoy the view ofc.the place is located at the top of a hotel in the middle of times square and they have free coat check before taking the elevator to the main restaurant room. the elevators are super cool and look like those vintage mail capsules going through the pipes, pretty insane speeds they have these elevators. there are plenty of these elevators so going up is not a hustle like at the one in San Antonio that only counts with one elevator. the place is a very beautiful one, the tables are well set and the staff is super nice. the view is ok, the tables are not right next to the windows so the view is from a far. now lets go to the needy greedy. the menu and drinks.- PINEAPPLE CAIPIRINHA- wrong wrong wrong, I am Brazilian and I know a caipirinha when I drink one, and this was not a caipirinha, they made it with some cheap liquor that I am not even sure what it was, if they used cachaca they better rethink it. it tasted horrible. as we were there for the restaurant week the below are the items I picked from the pre fixed menu, I am not sure if they sell these on a regular basis but here is my take on what I had. - LOBSTER BISQUE- super salty! it had some butter also on the side for taste and beauty. it was ok but way too salty. - COD- it came with parsnip and some free risotto, both had no taste at all, another case of the missing salt in these sides. the cod itself was dry and I didn't even want to eat ti anymore as I was full of salt from the bisque.- PANNA COTTA - it is some relating thing and this was the only thing I truly liked from my meal, my friends did not like this one but I did. it tasted fun and came out so pretty like a tiny wedding cake. this desert was very delicious with a hint of vanilla and some eatable flowers (that I most certainly ate!) ***THIS ONE WAS NOT ON THE RESTAURANT WEEK MENU.- MAC AND CHEESE WITH BACON- this dish was pretty good. go figure, the one thing we had the was not on the prefix menu was something we all liked, but hey, it is pretty hard to mess up Mac and cheese. I was going to chose to come back here solely based on this experience I would not to, there are plenty better restaurants in the city that cost way less with way better food. it was ok to try once but I don't know if I would recommend for the foodies out there.",9,6,4,Erica F.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",634,586,4481

Maybe it was because we were there for restaurant week but it was really hard to get a waiter (to ask for water or for the check or anything). But the view was really nice.

Our waiter was kind to me but very rude to my boyfriend, didn't offer the same additional commentary on the menu to us and we overheard him doing to other tables. My boyfriends steak was very bloody, too much for his liking so he asked for it to be slightly more cooked. The waiter said ""this is how we serve it"" despite us hearing him ask the next table over how they want their steak prepared. That kind of set an off tone for the rest of the night.

I told him that we were seeing a show and he made sure to get our food out as quickly as possible. The entire staff was very responsive to us. The rotation of the restaurant is so slight, you have to remember to look outside to not miss the incredible view. The restaurant week menu is basically a smaller version of their regular items. The lobster bisque was good, a bit heavy with the fennel in my opinion. The steak was perfectly cooked and the chocolate gingerbread pudding was the definition of the word decadent.

1.0,1/18/2018,I have been to this restaurant over ten years ago and it was amazing! I recently took my fiancé who had never been and he could not have been more let down if they tried! To start it looked exactly how it did ten years ago. It is very out dated and the rug is rather dirty. The service was good but the food was AWFUL!!! I literally took one bite of my filet Mignon. Everything was extremely salty and was terribly seasoned. It infuriates me that we paid what we did. They did take the entree off the check (what they thought was a good price as it is prix fixe menu) over all it was not worth the view you get and the terrible food.,0,0,0,Danielle G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,21,40

1.0,1/13/2018,"PLEASE READ!! While it took me many weeks to decide whether or not i should write this review, i have chosen to do so. And the main reason why is because of the way i was handled after the incident. On Dec 22 2017. my 34th birthday. My husband decided to take me out to a beautiful dinner at this restaurant. I have nothing but good this to say about the food and my server. Super pricey but we knew that before attending. The drama began after we excited the premises, and realized about 20 mins later that i left the gift bag my husband gave me on the ledge of the table we were sitting.The gift bag contained a birthday card and a 250.00 gift card to MAC COSMETICS (my favorite). So one could imagine have nervous i was to have potentially lost it. We were just around the corner. So we rushed back ran down stairs to where we were sitting to find an empty restaurant, Only cleaning staff. Not surprised because the dinning area was closed when we left. however i know 100% where i left my gift bag. But i didnt see it.  We went back up stairs to look for any staff member that can be of assistance. Maybe our waitress found the bag and put it in lost and found. or something of the sort. Finding a hostess and explaining the situation we were directed to the ""Manager"". Which is where the trouble began. This women (for lack of a better word) was the must unaccommodating, uncaring, unempathetic trash bag i have ever met. Between her accusing me of first not knowing whether i truly left it there or not, and trying her best to rush us out the door. We were asking questions like ""are there cameras"" ""can you contact our waitress"" ""where do we go from here"" because i know without a shadow of a doubt that i left the bag on the ledge"" She was give me answers like ""well there nothin we can do tonight"" ""we are not responsible for people losing things"" and i get all that. i wanted to just feel like when i left you would even try and that wasn't the feeling i was getting. At one point seeing the frustration growing in my face she same ""maam , do you have a problem"" and my response was to repeat the same question to her. because honestly the way she was handling us i wanted to say waaaaay more but i kept me composure.After 10 minutes of back and forth with this disgusting individual i asked one last time to go down stairs and check again. She said that she already did and there was nothing there. I insisted and she reluctantly agreed. I asked her to show us our table according to my receipt it was table 12. When we go downstairs she say ""Heres table 12"" OMG. NO ITS NOT. We sat at a 2 seater this is a table for 4. I suddenly here my husband behind saying omg babe here it is under the table"" 2 tables away from where we were actually sitting . Low and behold theres my gift card!! great right.... WRONG. There was my gift card but it was only the gift card, taken out the gift bag and wheres vmy card. SO basically someone took the gift card out my bag tossed my card and bag. and when they got wind that i was looking for it. tossed it under a table. We spent 500.00 in this place and someone that worked there tried to steal my gift card. UNBELIEVABLE. I was livid. I told her that and she yelled at me telling me not to accuse her staff of stealing. That other people come to the diner. Even though there wasnt a soul in there when we left. I was disgusted.The next day I called bright and early. I left 4. not 1 not 2 but 4 messages on the directors voicemail. I even called during dining hours to see if i could speak to him. I wanted to look at cameras. I wanted answers. I wanted someone fired fore stealing. I wanted an apology if nothing else. and here i sit on Jan 14 2018. writing a review on yelp. because i have not gotten a return phone call. or email. nothingI conclude that they know what happened. They possibly looked at the cameras. Even though i got my card. Someone physically reached in my bag and tried to steal it. Threw away my beautiful birthday card that my lovely husband gave me like it was trash. and ruined what before was rather a wonderful evening DONT SPEND YOUR MONEY.and the manger Mary Ann, Mary JO, Mary Lou whatever the hell your name is, try not to be a bitch, next time a customer comes to you with a concern.

All of us plus baby had an amazing time. The food was great, the view spectacular and the service was the best I have ever had in any restaurant. Whenever I take our 1.5 year old to a nice restaurant, I get anxious because you just don't know if people will be accommodating and your child will behave well as you go from course to course. Rita, our server, was charming, so accommodating to our child - she brought him strawberries so he was happy while we made our menu decisions. She bent over backwards for us all to have a great experience - simply delightful person. I had the fois gras appetizer which was fantastic - then the filet mignon and the cheese cake with marinated strawberries. I loved the entire meal. It was substantial for a high end restaurant. The rest of our group tried shrimp cocktail ( only disappointed it was only two big shrimp), lobster bisque (pretty decent), crab cake appetizer (very good), sirloin steak, cherry basque cake (divine, especially for my husband who loves cherries) etc. I can see that other reviewers wish for the menu to be more inventive, but I have to say everyone of us found something we were excited to order.  Now one note to the management - it's unacceptable we had to leave the table mid menu and spend 20 minutes traveling to the nearest changing table and then 20 minutes back. The food got cold and I saw plenty of other young families in the restaurant who have the same issue. For such a big restaurant with lots of traffic and the revenue they are creating here annually, it's not too much to ask to put a changing table in the restroom. You have to take two separate elevators and a significant distance through the building to find one. Annoying.",0,0,0,Johanna R.,"New York, NY",0,4,4

1.0,12/6/2017,"I visited NYC for the first time with my girlfriend and another couple. We read the reviews of ""The View Restaurant & Lounge"" and decided to ignore the negative commentary and test it out for ourselves. It's New York, right? Maybe people had too high of expectations or were overly critical... Not the case. After making reservations days in advance, we called ahead the night before to ask about window seating and whether arriving early would increase our chances. We called twice. After over an hour on hold, we gave up without talking to a live person. Still, we decided to go anyway and arrived twenty minutes prior to our reservation. Two of our group ordered a bottle of wine and a couple shots. After sitting for fifteen minutes, they were drink-less and called downstairs to be seated. We were then told that the drink orders do not transfer from the Lounge to the Restaurant. They had to be reordered (the manager did provide the shots on house, it would be unfair not to note that). After waiting for an extended period to place our orders, we eventually had our dinner. The food was like a decent steakhouse, but nowhere near the price the menu would suggest. Dessert was similarly mediocre, while looking like a five star restaurant, it tasted far less appetizing than it looked. Our evening at The View closed with receiving our check, as a group of four we were charged an automatic 18% gratuity by our waitress (mandatory for a group of 6 or more). This ""service charge"" was never brought to our attention. When we inquired about it, the waitress stated that we agreed to it... Even when confronted, she claimed to have explained it clearly to us and that we had consented to it. We spoke with the manager and, while the 18% was removed from our check, we were treated very much as if we were in the wrong. The best thing about The View is the view... which is actually OVER time square, not of it (it is difficult to see anything but skyline from the restaurant's vantage point). Don't go if you expect to receive the quality of service and exquisite meal that SHOULD be expected from such an expensive restaurant. Catch ""the view"" from the square and hit a food cart.

1.0,11/26/2017,Last night I was celebrating my birthday and also my engagement to my future wife . I made reservations for approx. 15-17 people. However have never ever had such a terrible experience as I had last night . The service was extremely terrible . The food was average for the price that we spent approx. $2800.00. When it was time to pay the bill we asked if we could spilt the check multiple ways at which point we were told that it was impossible to do this . We asked to speak to a manager and a gentlemen by the name of Melvin came and told us that he was the manager . Then he changed his story and said he was the Captain in charge of services . I explained the situation to Me. Marcel but I was better of speaking to a deaf mute because everything I spoke to him about he had it go through one ear and out the other . He then told me to break up the check amongst ourselves and he would then review it and charge us accordingly. I have never been to what I consider a very good restaurant and have to pull out a pen and paper and start dividing my check . I asked Mr. Marcel for the manager and he told me that he was in charge . I then walked over to the hostess and asked to speak to the manager in charge and was directed to Mrs Nicole . Mrs. Nicole advised me that  Mr. Marcel was not a manager and that she had never Ever heard of a Captain position in her restaurant . Mrs.Nicole made no attempt to fix the situation but only made things worse by telling us that the menu has in fine print on the back of the menu that checks cannot be spit and if it is to be split for any reason it is at the discretion of the waiter . Are you kidding me ! Who picks up a menu and reads the back of the menu to see if we can spilt a bill . Mrs Nicole never made any attempt to fix the problem or try to accommodate our party. But to make matters worse Mrs Nicole writes a reply to a review that one of our guest wrote stating that we were happy with the services etc. let me make it clear that this is 100% untrue . I'm sure this establishment could care less of my review because I'm just a tourist passing by however I travel to New York on a constant basis and with a lot of friends . We will never ever come back to this establishment nor will I recommend it to anyone ! Horrible experience .

Yes the food was ehhhhh Ok but not spectacular, that I don't care about. Nicoles attitude was substandard for a person who works in Managmemt. There was no tact in her approach and she actually complained about one of the guests Yelp review (Julie R). As a manager that was pretty petty but I said let me mend relationships and express that we were happy and this was probably a misunderstanding. This was far from a misunderstanding the rules were adhered to and we filled out all the documentation prior to our arrival. We asked the staff to split checks later and we were assured this was not a big deal. Now I have been to less reputable places and this has never been an issue but in this bigggggg restaurant, splitting checks for couples was an impossibility. Maybe we asked for too much and overstepped our bounds as paying customers, I think not! Anyway Nicole's attitude is exactly what is wrong with this establishment, her problem solving skills were shot and immediately took a shot at Julie R. For her review. I mean you are a Managmet, rise above and be better, rectify the problem. But Nicole did the opposite and It is clearly reflected in her snarky response. I have to say substandard for a big restaurant such as this one. Antonio the waiter did the best he could and I made sure the manager knew that, I chalked the issue up to a mere misunderstanding and told her thank you.

1.0,11/6/2017,"God awful from beginning to the end. I had the absolutely WORST experience ever at this restaurant! This dinner was supposed to be my proposal dinner to my girlfriend (now, fiance, with no help to The View). I made my reservation two weeks in advance and clearly stated that this would be a wedding proposal and explained how I wanted it to happen (also sent a follow up message to the event email). The manager waits until the day of proposal/reservation day to notify me that they couldn't accommodate my request. WOW!!! Possibly the biggest moment of our lives and you wait until the day of to let me know you can't accommodate my WEDDING PROPOSAL! Absolutely unprofessional and inconsiderate. That was part 1. I decide to amend my 8 oclock reservation and still go to the restaurant. We begin by waiting 20 mins for bread and water. Then we order a bottle of wine to celebrate and it took 45 mins to receive it, but not before the waiter gave our bottle to the table behind us that had just sat down. The service was absolutely terrible. He didn't check on us ONCE during that 45 mins of waiting for the wine bottle. When I asked him why it took so long and his reply was "" (with an attitude) I'm the only one working 17 tables. Don't you see me running around."" As I try to reply,  he immediately cuts me off and says ""You can just speak to a manager if you got a problem. I actually prefer you talk to a manager. Let him know this isn't okay"". The manager tried to reconcile the situation with complimentary drinks, but he didn't show much empathy or sincereity and my fiancé was fed up with the restaurant's service at this point. It took 1 hour for bread, water and wine. Who knows how long it would of taken to get the main course. I will not recommend this restaurant to any of my friends/family/colleagues ever until they undergo new management. - Disappointed Newly Enegaged Couple",10,0,0,Stovi A.,"Berkeley, CA",307,9,1

Service: 5/5My boyfriend made a reservation for us on a Saturday night at 6 pm - this was perfect timing since we got to see the sunset. I suggest making a reservation and asking for a window view. You enter through the Marriott hotel and take an elevator up to the 48th floor. When we got to the top we were seated immediately. The view when you first sit down is not that great, but it gets better as the restaurant rotates. The food was served quickly, and the waiters were quick to clean our plates. Servers were very friendly and accommodating to the customizations I requested for my meal.Ambience: 5/5Great great GREAT ambience. There are huge windows so that you can see the skyline. Can't remember if they played music but if they did it was not overwhelming.Food: 4/5Okay I will be honest I am not a fan of food at really high end places and have never really had great food at any place that has more than $$ on it. HOWEVER, I will say that my meal her was the best ""fancy restaurant food"" I've had. It's a set three course meal. I got an octopus and watermelon appetizer. It was interesting combination and thought it tasted decent. Boyfriend got the gazpacho - tasted average. For entree I got a lamb shank with creamy polenta and asparagus. I love lamb and I thought this was very well done. It had some sort of citrus seasoning, which tasted fantastic with the meat. The portion was also huge... The polenta and asparagus were very normal.  Boyfriend got some sort of cod dish. Was all right. We were pretty full by the time dessert came around so we shared a pavlova with a coconut and mahogany mousse thing and also a sherbet on the side. Very yummy. The sherbet was some.kind of tart grape flavor which we liked. We also got a cheese and crackers plate to go but forgot it at the hotel so we didn't actually get to taste it.

4.0,9/4/2017,"We had read the reviews so we were prepared for the pricey, meh Ok meal but it was pretty good actually.  The view is what you went there for in the first place and it is worth it.  They have some improvements that could be made.  Their 'concierge/host' staff leaves much to be desired.  They should be friendlier and not so put-upon when asked for directions.  They don't have many signs and if you miss it your out of luck.  It's in the Marriott.  Go to the third floor, then take the f or g elevator to the top 48 floor.  Then if you aren't doing the buffet you have to walk down to the 47th floor.  I think we would have been just as equally happy on the buffet but didn't want to risk it with a party of 8 and getting seated together.  The wait staff is fine, just the hostess staff borders upon being rude.  Don't have high expectations and you'll be happy.  The price point doesn't match the food or service but coupling in the view - it's probably about right. The get a 5 for the view and ambience, a 3 for the services (to include the host/hostess).  Be a little more engaging with your group.  Point the 'Big' buildings as they come into view for your table.  Be nice to those that are just entering the restaurant, they haven't been there before and don't know where everything is - it certainly isn't intuitive to know to walk down a flight of hidden stairs to be seated for your reservation.",1,0,0,Marian L.,"Fairfax, VA",9,39,0

It was my best friends birthday and we were ordering off of the menu for restaurant week. When the waiter took our order, it took about  20 mins for our food to be brought out. The waiter wasn't nasty but he wasn't the happiest either. I was halfway done with my entree when I saw something crawling in my food. I thought it was a fly and tried to swat it away and as I looked closer, it did not have any wings and ran deeper into my food. At this point I am in total shook and pretty much want to leave.  The waiter takes the food away with no apologies and we had to request to speak with the manager. They offered to bring me another entree but I no longer wanted to take that chance. So I received another appetizer. The chef came out to apologize and the manager acknowledged the incident but we had to ask that something be done towards the bill. Which is poor customer service because due to the price range of their food and the fact that we ordered bottle service, there should have been immediate attention brought to the bill. They gave us $28 off of the bill which is not significant enough given the nature of the occurrence. There should have been something on the bill comp and it wasn't.

4.0,7/3/2017,"Okay so first and foremost, this is a REALLY EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT. It's a bit of a tourist trap, located at the top of the Marriott Marquis in Times Square, and our bill for two people came to $340. If you're no longer interested after hearing that, you're a smarter person than I am, and you should skip it.But if you come in knowing how pricey it will be and you're totally fine with that, I do recommend it for you. Cost aside, our experience was quite nice. Of course, the primary attractor here is the fact that the 48th-floor restaurant rotates. It rotates very slowly - about one rotation per hour, and it's not like you're looking out the window and seeing straight down, because there are tracks upon which the restaurant is rotating and the tracks are much wider than the restaurant. So if you look straight down, you're just looking at the bottom of the tracks.The views are pretty good - not top of the Freedom Tower good, but good.The menu was prix fixe at $90 per person. This included an appetizer, main course and dessert. Cocktails were $18-19 each.For drinks, I got the View Fizz and the Cocktail d'Estate, both of which were tasty but definitely did not contain $19 worth of alcohol.My meal: crabcake, aromatic duck, and cheesecake. I also ordered a non-included side of lobster mac and cheese because it's my favorite and at that point, realizing how much I was about to spend either way, the extra $23 didn't seem like it would make much of a difference lol. Everything was tasty enough. The rolls were super stale, but that was my only real complaint about the food. I didn't actually eat my cheesecake because they ended up bringing me a surprise dessert after overhearing it was my birthday weekend. Sweet gesture, and I'm not quite sure what it was - some type of large chocolate cheesecake torte - but it was yummy, and way too filling to leave room for the actual dessert I had ordered.We ended up getting a window seat, but if you don't, it's totally pointless.

5.0,4/12/2017,"The View in a whole is a touristy restaurant. ""When you go to NYC go to the restaurant that spins around with views of the city"" type of place. However, there is more to this place than that. The food (which is pre-fixe) is STELLAR! Top notch food. The view(s) really ARE amazing, even if you have lived in this city all your life. And the service is excellent! It was my girlfriends 30th B-day and they made every part of it amazing. Even bringing a separate Happy Birthday cake with a candle. I mean, they went out of their way. Tip was included (18%) but I would have left more. Really good service. Great Ambiance. And really good food. Not just for the tourists! Trust me! However, for a pre-fixe meal for two, plus two glasses of wine, total damage was around $280 so be mindful about that. Definitely a $$$$ restaurant.

I was there a week ago with a group of high school students who had just competed in a national competition, and our server barely spoke to us. Didn't ask where we were from, what we were celebrating, nothing. Didn't tell us about the buildings as we were rotating. Terrible server interaction. Our bill for 6 people was over $700 and he got an automatic 18%, which I don't think he deserved. If you are a server at an expensive restaurant then you should be a GREAT server!

I can see the fascination for tourists, a 360 view of the city, all our skyscrapers. However, for me livening and working in the city, I have seen better, I was expecting the restaurant to be a bit higher, overseeing the city, not with office buildings and hotels right in my face next door.For food, they have a small salad bar, 3 different entrees and a chocolate fountain and cakes.

Let me start by saying that this place definitely is beautiful, but with that, I'm also going to say (as other's have stated) I think it's a tourist trap. Definitely a bit expensive, at $89/person, this become a pricey outing and if you add wine or drinks, man it's and bank breaker.So a rotating view of NY huh? It's beautiful, definitely something to see at night. Again, this restaurant is one on my ""once in a life time visit"" list. While the restaurant was beautiful, the food wasn't something to brag about. I'm one to get motion sick very, very easily but the rotating view of NY was not nauseating at all. I'm glad to see that my mom was excited but none of us were impressed by the food, although I will admit that presentation was on point and beautiful. I also loved that they gave you cute napkins that were a kind of map of the area.Be aware that there are quite a few parking lots in the area but expect to pay. Word of advice, go online for those parking lots and see if you can make a ""reservation,"" this is sometimes cheaper or you mind find a coupon instead which is what I did - saved about $10 on parking which was great.So again, spectacular view, but the food...don't expect a magnificent meal for the price.",4,1,2,Rona R.,"Alexandria, VA",176,86,838

For dessert, we got cheesecake, a mango sorbet dessert, and chocolate cake. I do have to say that the presentation of the desserts are beautiful, but taste was just ok. The chocolate cake was a bit too sweet and the mango sorbet was just a touch too sour.I think this place would be great for tourists who wants a nice restaurant with a nice view of NYC but at the same time don't want to pay an exorbitant amount for dinner.

4.0,2/15/2017,"The restaurant is located on the 48th (top) floor of the Marriott Marquis.  It's a little tricky to find it as if you enter at ground level, you need to go up the escalator (sign says it goes to the view).  Then on that floor you have to find the right elevator (there are 2) that says it goes to The View and punch in 48 for the floor.  The elevator is glass so you can see the interior of the Marriott as you go up.  When you arrive, you are actually in the bar and have to go down steps to get to the restaurant (if you need to go down on elevator, someone will take you down a level).  They don't open until 5:30 but if you arrive a bit earlier, there are some chairs to wait.  No-one offered to take our coats so doubt they have a coat check.  It would be nice if they did.  The restaurant rotates and during the meal you will make a full circle.  A lot of the view is other buildings but still kind of fun to see.  If you don't like heights, you don't have to look down.  We chose the prix fixe menu for restaurant week.  I had the baby gem lettuce salad as a starter which was quite good.  It had a nice mix of vegetables, walnut crumbs and a sherry pomegranate vinaigrette dressing.  For dinner I had the chicken breast that came with a ""savory bread pudding"" that was more of a stuffing but tasty and the chicken was tender and tasted good.  For dessert I had the cheesecake that had some strawberries, shaved cucumbers and lime.  It was pretty good.  A couple of days later, due to the snow storm and theater tickets on that block, we decided to go back with some other friends.  Had the salad and cheesecake again but for entree had the salmon.  It also was tender and had a lobster ragout sauce with yukon mash.  It was very good.   The service on both occasions was excellent throughout the meal and waiters were attentive to our theater timeline.  They have a nice wine selection as well.",2,1,1,Betsy B.,"Tucson, AZ",50,528,917

My options included crab  cake, skirt steak and a chocolate pudding.  The crab cake was pretty awesome with huge chunks or crab meat, no cheap filling that some restaurants use. We're talking the good stuff. The skirt steak,although the waiter said we couldn't order to temperature because it was restaurant week, I thought was a weird requirement but the steak was perfectly cooked. The baked chocolate pudding hmmm I didn't know what to expect but it basically came out as a brownie/lava cake. I guess if the two were to somehow have a baby lol. Hmmm lava brownie? Oh wow if that doesn't exist it really should! It came with ice cream and a toffee wafer. Delicious! I also had a berry martini  very strong but very tasty. Now onto the view, gorgeous! Everything that you would expect. I love that the place was spinning and it wasn't too fast either. I was worried that the spinning mixed with eating might create vertigo but we were good. Our waiters (yes there were two of them) Eric and Josh were fabulous. The only reason why I didn't give this place 5 stars is:1) you have to go to one floor to check your coat then another floor and then another section. You basically are sent to two or three sections BEFORE you can actually be seated which is time consuming and annoying you're hungry or have a show to get to. I would recommend the coat check on either the ground floor when you come in or alternatively on the same floor as the actual restaurant. 2) the hostess was kind of snippy about telling us we couldn't have a seat near the window. I'm sure she receives that request all the time but at the end of the day the restaurant is called ""the view"" so it's honestly not a unreasonable request.

3.0,11/9/2016,"I'll start with that overall it was a positive experience. I made the reservations a few weeks ahead of time, and the receptionist was pleasant and accommodating. When we got to the restaurant, we used the valet as parking in the area is impossible. When we got up to the restaurant I requested a window seat, which after a 15 minute wait they were able to accommodate. The service was excellent, our 2 waiters that were working the section we were sitting made us feel like it was their pleasure to serve us. I don't know if that would be everyone's experience though as the service at the neighboring section didn't seem to have waiters who were as good (less attentive and less organized, just didn't seem on point). The food was ok, it wasn't anything spectacular but it was good, nowhere near The River Cafe for instance which is another place with a view and similarly priced. I ordered the rib eye as a main and was surprised it was only a 1/2"" cut though it was cook exactly how I asked and the flavor was pretty good. The bill came out to be about $625 for dinner, drinks and tip for 4 people, plus another $48 for 3 hours parking. I felt the prices for drinks on the receipt were a bit higher than on the menu. Overall a pleasant experience, $160+/person pleasant? Not sure.",0,0,0,Michael G.,"Bath Beach, Brooklyn, NY",13,8,2

We got there right on time and he luckily reserved a table by the window. To begin with our waitress - she was not nice to us, we went there with our little daughter which is 9mo so she started to be cranky at some point and this lady preached us not to bring kids here so and so...really?!!! Please mind your own business dear miss waitress know it all. Bum, here is +1 to not to tip her well.Then she was openly ignoring guests next to us, they just left without getting their checks... isn't it ridiculous?Apart from that the whole place needs an update, it is soooo old and looks dark and gloomy. Of course it is cool to have an amazing view and spinning side but hey would be even better if management bothered a little for an upgrade in waiting staff and interior decorations.Three stars I'm giving for an amazing chief who made my day with birthday cake and who made our food.

We had a fixed price meal and that STUNK! Our waiter treated us like we didn't deserve to be there, and we were wasting his time. But, from the very beginning, the experience was just so bad. They gave us a menu that outlined all these foods we could NOT have...even though they were made aware at the hostess stand that we were on a price fixed menu. The couple of options we had weren't even good.       It wasn't until we were leaving, and our waiter saw the tip I had left him (B/c even though he deserved nothing...I have compassion and want the man to be able to pay his rent), that when we asked him to take a photo of us he suddenly feigned interest in us. And, once he realized we were from a part of the country he was from, he was oh so chatty and ""friendly"". Dude, a little late. You should be welcoming to anyone, no matter what part of the world they are from - and no matter what they are ordering, or what menu it comes from.

I ask for it on the side as years of experience have taught me it is a rare corn salsa that doesn't contain my nemesis. The salads arrive. Hers had no avocado - when she asks where is the avocado - he claims it doesn't come with it - she sends him to the menu and he goes back to the kitchen. Meanwhile my plate has corn salsa loaded with bell peppers all over it. I point it out and tell him - please re cook. I get very sick if it's been touching. Fast forward 20 minutes and I get a new salad - with bell pepper filled corn salsa all over it!  I show the waiter and he laughs?? I remind him about the need for a fresh salad. 5 minutes later he shows up with a new one. He swears it's been freshly made. I eat about 10 bites and find corn kernels on the underside of the meat.

We drove in so thought we would eat at hotel first night and celebrate his birthday at the View.  Had reservation and showed up a bit early.  They confirmed his birthday at check in. We went to bar for a drink and shared a bottle of wine. Wait for server to acknowledge us was about 5 minutes then another 5-10 to get our bottle of wine. Enjoyed the view as the floor rotates so you can enjoy a panoramic scene of the city. At end of first glass we were called to restaurant to sit which was prior to our reservation at 7:15. Didnt see server again after she had a young man deliver and pour the wine. We went to restaurant not thinking it was a big deal as we had charged wine to room already. We went to sit for dinner. A few minutes later server showed up saying that the bar and restaurant didnt bill together. We think she was looking for more tip. The young man did all the work. He should have received  her tip to begin with. Anyway dinner was prefix. I ordered salmon medium and my husband ordered filet medium rare. Salmon came out well done and dry and steak came medium well. Server filled our glasses and left us alone. Although kind, he never asked how our meal tasted or if we were pleased with the preparation or if we cared for another drink. He cleared our wine glasses as soon as we finished, cleared dishes, and cleared crumbs from the table from the half stale rolls.  The sauce on the salmon was completely flavorless with some sort of weak cream and a green, unrecognizable herb that offered no flavor.  The desserts were okay with the lemon sorbet being the best. My husband enjoyed the strawberry shortcake. Two others around us enjoyed a happy birthday presentation with their dessert. My husband didnt even get a ""happy birthday"". It was a disappointing $300 experience with the exception of the wonderful view. It was one of those places where the ambiance didnt match the service or food.

The food was dry and not tasty. The selection was very small and not much attention was given to the stations to maintain them properly. The dessert station was 3 out of five stars but I felt it also needed attention tin the maintenance dept!

Located inside the Marriott Hotel, The View Restaurant is on the 48th floor accessible by a fun elevator ride. We had a reservation and had noted in our reservation that we were celebrating a birthday. Our server was friendly and humorous. We were attended to, but not bothered. The selections from the restaurant week menu included:Creamless tomato soup- just the right temperature, tart but full-bodiedCrab cakes- I'm not usually a fan of crab cakes because I think they're too much cake and not enough crab, but these crab cakes were stellar! So much fresh crab meat!Butter poached Alaskan crab legs- a bit too heavy with the butter, but still delicious crab legs, nonetheless Flatiron steak- WOW. Was definitely not expecting the steak to be so perfect. The medium was cooked perfectly, and the meat was so tender and perfectly seasoned!Seared Atlantic Grouper- good, but not mind-blowing. The ratatouille that it came with was quite good. The chocolate mousse parfait and cheesecake were both delicious. Much to our delight, we were given a complimentary chocolate mousse cake with candles for our birthday celebration! That was so lovely of them, and definitely was the cherry on the top.We loved the rotating aspect of the experience, and really enjoyed seeing different views of the Manhattan skyline, though it wasn't as spectacular as I expected it to be. We did have a window seat, so not sure how much better it could get. I won't be back for the regular menu because the prices are more than I should be paying as a graduate student, for sure.

Luckily we were staying in the hotel so the surcharge didn't apply to us. To be honest I don't think that the rotating view would be worth the additional charge.I had the Perfectly French, I would say just ok and BF had the Channel Crossing which is basically gin and tonic. That was good and their limes were freshly sliced! For me that's key, especially if you're charging premium prices.The view was beautiful and they print the buildings that you view on your napkin so you can keep track as you rotate.  The rotating room is inside a square exterior so the view is semi obstructed unlike the Westin Bonaventure in LA where the rotating restaurant is framed in a circle as well.  Here you get corners etc, aesthetically not as pleasing.  Service was good.

Only to watch people sneak around the hostess stand and get on the elevator directly to the 48th floor. Then it's the worst buffet I have experienced in International travel.

Very few choices on Buffett for the $40 per person charge, Roast beef, hot wings, pasta, mashed potatoes, salads and a few others. Quality of food was very good and even had a good dessert selection.

Me and my wife live in New York City and never have been to the view restaurant. I've heard great things and I truly was excited to go. The hostess that greeted us were very friendly and took us to a table immediately which I thought was great after having to wait in that long line. We ordered. Got our food out very fast and it was very hot. Everything was going well until our server , his name is Marcell started staring awkwardly at my wife's chest repeatedly every time he came over to check on us. When she went to the bathroom he was watching her walk away. Probably staring at her backside.  Then I over heard him speaking about her chest to other coworkers. And honestly I find that so rude while We were just trying to eat a delicious meal. And I wouldn't have been that upset if he didn't talk about it with other people. Thinking I was not going to hear that. I would love to come back but with that type of unprofessional behavior. I don't see my self ever setting foot back in this restaurant. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the food. Thank you for listening. Have a good day.",2,2,0,Corey B.,"New York, NY",1,3,0

The atmosphere feels like you're eating at Denny's. The service was terrible. Had to ask for refill of water and more ice on 2 seperate occasions.

1.0,4/3/2016,"What a poor experience... At first the bouncer let us in without charging us a cover charge because it was our anniversary. At least we thought, as absolutely nothing was mentioned about a cover charge. We sat down and ordered drinks and the server informed us that there is an $8 dollar charge per person as a fee to enjoy the view ($32 dollars total for 4 of us). The drinks are overpriced but we ordered some with the confidence from the server that she'll get verification from the manager that it's ok to waive the fee. Again, that was the impression we got. The server dropped the drinks off and we started to drink them. The manager came over, Brian, (skinny white guy with glasses mid thirties). And he informed us that there was nothing he could do about it and only if we were hotel guests, which we told them the truth that we weren't. He wouldn't budge, even considering the special occasion. The server came back after hearing about our conversation with the manager and without asking took our drinks away and said ""I guess you guys aren't staying"". And walked away with our drinks and and then whispered something under her breath, something like ""weirdos"", or something like that, I didn't her it, but she definitely mumbled something under her breath. Not cool. Not a good experience at all. I talked to her again and let her know this was not cool, and she said she was just taking the drinks away according to what the manager said. She also called my friend who a liar, which, even if my friend was lying about the cover charge issue (which she wasn't) the server should NOT call any customer a liar. Brian should not be the manager. He handled this VERY poorly. This place has a beautiful view. That's about it. Drinks are over priced and not that great.

We decided just to go for it and I'm so glad we did - all the bad reviews seriously have to be people in NYC that are way too snobby and demanding. The food was excellent and the service made the meal all that it was. It was a fixed menu and it's definitely a little pricey ... $200 + $60 tip for two people. BUT since we told them it was my birthday, they gave us 4 free desserts so it was worth it! (Though, You probably wouldn't pay much different anywhere else, realistically. it is NYC after all). The view of the city isn't anything too spectacular just because the high rises block out a lot but we live 30 minutes outside of the city and we can see it anytime we want. It definitely pretty cool to spin around while you're eating though and see the city in a different light. If you're a tourist looking to come to see the view, this place probably isn't your best best.

It takes a while to adjust to the restaurant platform that rotates in order to get a 360 view of the city from Times Square. The hostess was very friendly and promptly took us to our table. The menu is prix fixe for a three-course menu. We started with beet ravioli and prawns. Both appetizers were generous portions and a strong start to the meal. The beet ravioli really stood out with fresh beets and the pasta that was covered in a light brown sugar sauce. Entrees - we ordered the griddled scallops and the ribeye steak. The scallops were okay but a bit too dense; not a melt in your mouth texture. The spiced cauliflower and roasted potatoes made up for the underwhelming scallops. We rated the steak 6/10Dessert - nice range of options on the menu. I highly recommend the tipsy pineapple cake - it was a spice cake drizzled with a pineapple chutney with a delicate almond cookie on top. We also ordered the sorbet and ice cream that came with mixed berries. The waitress Rita was amazing! She was very attentive and always willing to suggest an item from the menu.  Pros - Cool concept, nice view, quality service and food, dishes were served to the table quickly Cons - Somewhat outdated decor, time needed to adjust to the moving platform (you might be dizzy for the first few minutes)",1,0,0,Jessica G.,"Manhattan, NY",319,37,72

1.0,2/1/2016,"This is an in-depth review of December 31st 2015 leading into 1 January 2016.Entrance/check-in The night started off with the entrance to the Marriott Marquis in NYC. Security was top notch and the entrance was heavily guarded. We made it through security by showing our ID's and our confirmation letter. We then went to the event check-in at the desk for our dinner reservation. Check-in went smooth and the personnel were hospitable. From the check-in we were directed to the complimentary coat check which was an added bonus. After checking the coats, my wife and I went up to the 48th floor to The View lounge for drinks.Havana nights themed New years Eve PartyPre-dinner drinks/appetizers The View was amazing. We were seated next to the window and were able to see many historic NYC landmarks. The cocktails were a bit pricey but that's expected since we opted out of the $150 per person open bar charge. The drinks were phenomenal. The mojitos were made with premium liquor and it reflected in the quality. My wife had painkillers which was also made with premium liquor. We didn't mind paying $17 per drink because they were really good and because it was NYE in NYC. With the drinks, our server offered us complimentary finger food which was very flavorful. The music during this part of the night fit the ambience perfectly. Our server handed out fedoras to all the guests, which I thought was a nice touch. I felt the females should've been given a flower for their hair because not a lot of women wore theirs. Women typically do not want to mess up their hair styles. A lot of the gents however wore theirs.DinnerThe dinner was a 5 course prefixed menu. The food was cooked to perfection. Our waiter was very attentive and gave us great information on the food as well as the origins of the food. The majority of the menu I had not had before. Due to the fact that I had a shellfish allergy it eliminated a few of my options. I knew this in advance and was fine with it. A lot of the food however I probably wouldn't order had I been to any other 5 star restaurants. Being that it was NYE, I was feeling adventurous. The food was prepared well and was pleasing to the eye.Live Dj and DancingThis was where our evening took a turn for the worse. At around 930pm, we asked one the servers when will the live dj and Dancing would start (as advertised). He told us that there was a change in plans. Instead of having the advertised live dj and due to enhance Cuban themed party 'Havana Nights', the live Dj thing was scrapped for a live band. He explained that the band was a 10 piece band that will be playing Latin music for the night. He also told us that due to the size of the band, the band would have to use the majority of what would have been the dancefloor. Essentially, there was no space to dance so we had no dancing.The bandI am from Central America with Spanish as my primary language and culture. I have a keen ear for music, especially Latin music. The band was mediocre at best. The songs they chose to play, which I've heard various renditions of preciously, sounded very tired. The band wasn't engaged with the audience at all. The singers almost seemed like they didn't want to be there. It all seemed like a boring dinner show. What made it even worse was that the members of the band were very unprofessional. They were eating on the stage as well as hanging out in the seating area. Also, I wouldn't call it a 10 piece band if throughout the whole night 1 member of the band was recording and taking pictures of the band. We saw many guests leave and complain about the music and entertainment. When a band is used at a venue as nice as The View, a certain level of professionalism must be maintained. The band chosen for that night was not the right choice.The audience The age range for the event was from approximately 6 months old all the way up to the elderly. I understand allowing toddlers and preteens at the dinner, but for the after dinner portion of the event that is absurd. While sitting with my wife, we had to deal with kids crying and being annoying (rightfully so because they were bored and tired).When one pays $650 a person for an event like this, expectations are extremely high. Everything that happened after dinner was a huge let down. Had I known there wouldn't be a live Dj and Dancing (as was advertised), I  would've taken my business elsewhere. Had I known that this was a kid friendly event, I would've taken my business elsewhere. What occurred was a clear violation of the contract I signed and I am extremely disappointed in the events leading up to the year 2016. With such drastic changes made to the agenda at the last minute I should've been given the option to opt out with a full refund. Going to this event was the worst part of our first trip to New York.

4.0,1/9/2016,"Brunch at The View in the Marriott Hotel in Times Square when you're in Times Square NYC because there isn't anything else like it! Where else can you enjoy an amazing buffet style brunch selection in a rotating restaurant at the top of a hotel to see a 360 degree view of NYC?It takes about an hour to complete an entire rotation of the restaurant, so it's not revolving at a fast pace for anyone who may be prone to motion sickness. The food stations themselves, which are in the center of the circular restaurant do not rotate -- just the tables which are located on the outside of the circumference. The view truly is breathtaking, and you can see the Hudson River, the World Trade Center, you can see out into the other boroughs of NYC -- however, it's not ideal for taking pictures as the circular restaurant is built inside a rectangular hotel, so the view is a bit obstructed when you are facing one of the corners of the hotel. While the corners have clear windows, the infrastructure still partially blocks the view, and while you can still see outside into the city, you won't be able to take any clear pictures. As a photo junkie, I found this aspect of the restaurant to be disappointing.I was blown away by the food, as there was an impressive selection of various brunch items including pastries, various meats and cheeses, eggs served multiple ways, and there was a waffle, crepe, and omelet station where you can ask the chef to prepare your own custom item. My favorite station was the dessert station which had so many gorgeously decorated cakes, cake pops, a chocolate fondue machine and various foods like marshmallows and strawberries to dip into the chocolate fountain. There were also cream puffs, mousses, and the list goes on. I helped myself to two plates of dessert, as dessert is always my favorite part of the meal. Brunch on the day that we went (12/27/15) had complimentary bottomless mimosas, which I thought was a nice touch. The price for brunch was not too bad considering the stature surrounding this restaurant -- we paid $65 per person for brunch. Eating at The View was definitely one of the highlights of my NYC trip, and I would definitely recommend it as a must for anyone visiting the city in the future.",6,1,1,Pooja M.,"Fremont, CA",543,264,1109

Unfortunately the rotating room made me queasy (and I'm not normally susceptible to motion sickness) and the main course was so heavily salted that I couldn't even eat it. The only menu option was the $84 fixed price meal, so I started with the curried coconut soup, which was ok. Then the salmon came out with two kinds of mushy potato; not a green veg in sight. The salmon had a nice crispy sear to it, but my mouth burned from the salt as soon as I took one bite. I couldn't even eat a quarter of the fish due to the excessive saltiness. I found myself pushing it around my plate like a child trying to get out of eating her dinner. My friend's strip steak was also extremely over seasoned.When the waitress returned we told her about the salt issue. She felt badly and she was a fine waitress, but her solution was to bring out an extra dessert that we didn't even want.

By NYC standards, a decent $60 meal is considered  deal to us.We enjoyed the view, and for most part, the brunch buffet was actually pretty good. The lox/bagel/pastry area was great with all sorts of different smoked fish and various spreads and cheeses. The omelette bar was nice, along with the make your own pancakes station (our daughter loved that).  My two complaints...one, our server was pretty stingy with the mimosas. We were greeted with one upon arrival, but otherwise he did not keep them coming. I wasn't looking for more than two or three...I don't think that is too much to ask for. He did replenish them without asking about 45 minutes into our meal, but still.....kind of disappointing. Its Sunday brunch in NYC...keep them flowing!   Other complaint...whenever we take our daughter to a brunch like this, if she wants something, we take her to get it. We do not let our child run around unsupervised.  So the fact that families were allowing their children to run to the chocolate fountain and other places and stick their grimy hands into bowls and such without using utensils...gross.

As you all know yes it rotates and yes it's totally worth every penny. We received very personal attention till last second and afterwords they asked us to leave kindly and with professional manners.

4.0,9/6/2015,"I came to this place with my boyfriend and had a difficult time finding the actual restaurant. It is located inside the hotel but you need to take two separate elevators to get there. When we finally made it up, it was beautiful. We had reservations for 10pm and was a few minutes late but that was no issue.  We were seated immediately. I would suggest the restaurant update the carpets as they seem a bit outdated. Nevertheless, everything else was stunning. Our waiter was very attentive and pleasant. The food portions are too small and could not possibly leave you satisfied. So if you are hungry, this is not the place for you. Despite that, the food was perfectly seasoned and left you wanting more. We ordered the steak and salmon which were both delicious.This restaurant is such a romantic place. The ambiance is on an all time high and the view of the city as we rotate makes it even more romantic. The restaurant spins at a decent speed; enough for you to feel it moving but not enough for you to feel sick.

But since they charge an arm and leg for everything, i'm sure they'll be fine.  I would NEVER go to this place again, and let me tell you why. First of all, our waiter's name was Samir and he was a  first class jackass, as would be expected in a first class place like this.   He was rude, rolled his eyes A LOT and only was nice when you were ordering something. He literally cut off my friend telling him a joke to say ""are you ordering something?"" When he said no not yet, the asshole walked away mid-joke.   I was fuming!! My bf and I got there first. There were 12 of us in 6 rooms at the hotel (Marriot Marquis) and we were meeting for drinks before heading out on the town. We ask Samir to charge our beers to our room.  No problem he says. Great. Then, the rest of our party shows up and starts ordering their drinks and as him to charge their drinks to their rooms (mind you, as most hotels do nowadays, we all gave a credit card for incidentals upon check in), Samir says no, he cannot do that.  ALL the drinks now have to be charged to OUR room!!!   I looked right at him and said well bring that bill NOW and you won't see any of us in here again.  Way to go.Are you fucking kidding me right now?  Oh... but then EUREKA!! It came over me like a wave ... 18% gratuity automatic with parties of 6 or more.

The only food portions they had when I went was a buffet ($38) or cheese and dessert plate ($21). They had a wide selection of desserts but they all tasted pretty bland and some of the chocolate tasted like Hershey chocolate. They only had 4 options for cheese, which for someone coming from Wisconsin was pretty pitiful. Service was mediocre. My first drink was gone before I could flag the waitress down for a second.

We said we were full and just getting a drink. The server did not seem impressed and less than a minute later the host came to our table and asked us go downstairs and take our drink there since the table was reserved for diners only. I explained that we didn't know it was for diners only since we just followed her and she kept saying we had to leave cuz the tables were for people who get food and she insisted we take our drink with ourselves. Frustrated, we went upstairs with our drink and got seated and was asked to pay right away when we said we were going to pay by cash. When the bill came, she already added 18% gratitude as if they deserved such thing. The whole experience left us speechless and i do not intend to go back there EVER AGAIN.

That said, the place is in desperate need of a makeover. For the prices they charge, it needs to shed the ugly brass and 26 year old carpet for something more modern. The price fixe meal was good but really too much food for a pre-theater dinner. They should offer a smaller tasting menu that would be quicker and smaller for these early, quick meals. Meanwhile the signage to get to the restaurant is abysmally bad. We had to wander around the lobby trying to figure out how to get upstairs.

I have to stick to filet mignon. The potatoes were a little overlooked. However the cheesecake was delicious!!!!! It was soft and flavorful and the strawberries added a nice touch. I would like to dine here again and actually stay at the hotel...lovely!!!P.S. This has nothing to do with the restaurant but as you know the place revolves so you get different views of the city.

3.0,8/5/2015,"2015 Restaurant Week Review ($38 per person, three course meal)I've been to The View with friends back in February (six months ago) for Restaurant Week. This time, I decided to come back again with my parents to let them have the experience of dinning at a moving restaurant. Needless to say, the view never changed, and neither did the menu.The menu basically stayed the same with really minor tweaks to their appetizers and dessert options and no changes whatsoever to their entrées. NAVIGATION:Take the ESCALATORS to the third floor. There is a coat check on that floor (fall/winter time). Find the receptionist on that floor by the elevators. He/she will direct you to take elevators F or G to The View on the 47/48th Floor. SERVICES:1.) Pros: We were promptly seated for the reservation we made for 7pm, though we were 12 minutes late because we got lost in the big hotel. I asked if we can have a window seat for four people and were given one, no questions asked, which was awesome. The waiter was very attentive and kind. He even helped refill our bread.2.) Cons: I'm being petty about this, but the waiter seemed confused every time I asked him to take a picture for us and it comes out blurry most of the time. There weren't a lot of people either and it wasn't even noisy. He seems like he couldn't hear me most of the time, but I guess I spoke a bit soft. Other than this, not really much of a con. APPETIZERS:1.) *Soup: It's a creamy corn soup with a hint of curry. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't spectacular either. Compared to last time, they had the clam chowder instead of this. 2.) Salad: Please, don't get this. It's literally just a bunch of sliced up colorful tomatoes with balsamic vinegar and lemon oil. You can make this at home.3.) *Crab Cake: You need to pay an addition of $10 for this dish. The portion was pretty decent (about twice the size of a ping pong ball) and it tasted pretty good. ENTREÉS:1.) Chicken breast: Same presentation as last time. Meat was somewhat dry. Huge portion size.2.) *Salmon: This was actually pretty succulent. Lots of moisture. The presentation is pretty simple. Just a seared salmon on top of a bunch of greens. 3.) Flatiron steak: Comes with two potato wedges that has been fried to death and these carrots that have seen black death of hell. There are tiny caramelized onions that I thought were potatoes, so be careful not to stab into it because it's slippery. Steak's a bit rough on the outside despite being medium rare.4.) *Filet Mignon ($15 extra) to upgrade your steak cut: Huge difference in texture between this and the Flatiron steak. The meat is much tender and soft. A SIDE THING:For $12, you can get these crab legs. It's really salty, and their really small. It's somewhat meaty, but definitely not worth it. Don't get it because it only fills up one person. DESSERTS:1.) *Cheesecake: Really delicious. It was the same presentation as the last time I came here. 2.) Chocolate cake thing: It was the same dessert as last time, except they took away the ice cream and added tiny marshmallows and three puny raspberries instead. Guess they were on a tight budget...The chocolate cake is a rectangular prism, width is about 0.75 inches, length about 3.5 inches, and 0.75 inches tall.3.) Ice cream: Comes with three different scopes of flavors: vanilla, chocolate, and lemon sorbet and these two dark chocolate sticks. * Indicates the entree I recommend. OVERALL EXPERIENCE: It averaged out to be $70 per person. But, yours will definitely be less because We went a bit crazy with the extra costs. I liked the food better last time, despite minor changes. The food is so-so. You're basically there for the view, literally. Would I come back next time? Probably not.",5,2,0,Kyle L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0
4.0,8/3/2015,"**RESTAURANT WEEK 2015 REVIEW**I went here on Friday night with a friend for her birthday; I'm usually very weary of places where the median stars on Yelp is a 3 but I took a chance.  Primarily because my friend is a demanding Leo, but a chance nonetheless.Be advised that you'll have to ride the escalator TO the elevator and go all the way up.  Someone will be at the elevators and will direct you on how to get there.  Arriving, I found my friend and we waited to be seated (which wasn't long at all).  Here's the selling point of this place, while I was seated I felt that we were moving.  Yes, girl.  MOVING.  The restaurant makes a slow rotation so you're able to take in beautiful city lights while seated.  In the time that you've eaten you'll make at least one full rotation.I wish I remembered our server's name; he was attentive and didn't pressure us into ordering quickly.  I had the pineapple capirinha as a drink.  The crab cake, pan seared salmon, and chocolate cake were exceptional!  You'd think that considering the Restaurant Week menu is so scarce they'd give you the less popular food options, but I was pleasantly satisfied.  I'm a person who thinks that two to three drinks will satisfy them, but one drink was more than enough for me.  Definitely no watered down cocktails here.I'll definitely work a zillion hours overtime and come back on a regular day, I had a great experience at The View.",3,2,0,Shanté D.,"Queens, NY",5,27,13
4.0,8/3/2015,"We visited here for restaurant week and found it to be a lovely experience. The View is a rotating lounge and restaurant split across the 48th and 47th floors of the Marriott Marquis hotel in Times Square. It features 360 degree views (sometimes obstructed) of Manhattan and the Hudson River. It takes about an hour or so to complete the rotation.  For restaurant week, we each enjoyed a three course meal (heirloom tomato salad and corn chowder, chicken and salmon, and chocolate marshmallow cake) for $38/each. Everything was well done and prepared and served to us promptly. The chocolate marshmallow cake was divine! Drinks were on the expensive side ($15+ for a glass of wine of specialty drink, $8 for a beer).  We probably won't eat here normally as the prices are up there (almost $50/prix fixe meal on the normal menu) but count us in for restaurant week next year! Worth a visit here (even if you just grab a drink at the lounge) for any tourist or even  a local looking for something new!  If coming on a weekend, plan to make a reservation on Open Table as it can get packed (and having a reservation lets you cut any long elevator lines in the lobby!).",3,1,1,Amanda B.,"West Hartford, CT",72,404,760

From the moment we stepped thru the elevator everyone was friendly and super nice. We had a guest with a wheelchair and the hostess for the lounge quickly got us our elevator for one floor down. When we got downstairs Ms. Darline B. greeted us right away. We had reservations and arrived early so we had a seat. She showed us our table and we asked if possible can we have one by the window. She explained it would be an additional wait and if we do not mind we can wait for one to open up. We agreed. While sitting there we watched her and the other hostess (Sophia?) checking tables, greeting guests and trying to fulfill all accommodations while remaining professional and polite. Ms. Darline showed us to our table which was, as promised, right next to the window. Our waiter was very tentative for the rush on a Thurs while being short staffed. He explained to us any questions we had and was very helpful. The food was amazing and dessert was the perfect ending. Ms. Darline even went above and beyond and came and checked on us.

Unfortunately they close early ,around 11pm so you only get 830 pm to 11 pm for the skyline night time view. Since it,was daytime there were mostly buildings , airvents, satellite dishes, scaffolding.  AND THERE NO PLACE TO PLUG YOUR CELL. So when I needed it most later on, it was dead!

Luckily I could drown my meat in the sauces, since the meat was overcooked. I did not send it back because of the  upcoming show nor did I mention it. At those prices the cook should get ut right. I have no or9blem paying even more , just get it right the first time.The waiters made sure we got out on time and even gave us special treatment.

I must say the only time he was attentive was when we left a 20%tip to a $250 bill, all of a sudden his personality became upbeat and chipper. I am just disappointed in the service. I know that I am young and so is my boyfriend however, how we look or our age should not define the service we deserve.

I wish there were some tart cornichons to cut the fat with, but there you go.For the mains, you can choose between steak, chicken, pork and fish - I got myself a pork shank, which came huge on the bone, with sides of spaetzle and mustard greens.

1.0,5/11/2015,"My boyfriend and I were staying at the hotel for 4 nights and decided to go to the View on a Saturday night around 12:30am for dinner. Once we were seated, we did not see a server for 10minutes and discovered from another customer,that only a buffet was available. We started the first course of the buffet  at almost 1am and then our server made it to our table to get our drink order. He ordered a beer around 1 am and then another  at 1:20am. In the middle of eating our second course, we noticed that they were closing the buffet and cleaning up without any notice; so we got up to get our dessert. When we made it back to our table, the waitress served my boyfriend's 2nd beer and when we asked, informed us the buffet closed at 1:30. Right after she left, a busboy passed by and informed us the restaurant was closed...we hadn't even started our dessert and were still eating dinner. When we said that to him, he snickered and asked how long were we going to take to eat our dessert. We didn't answer, and a couple minutes later the hostess came over to inform us the restaurant was now closed. We asked to at least finish our meal; she stated she could pack the remainder of our food and we could go to the 8th floor lounge area or back to our room. When my boyfriend asked to speak to the manager it was the same story. Anne Marie, the manager, was not only not apologetic, but rude. She blamed our waitress for not informing us that the restaurant closed at 1:30 and did not take responsibility that they served my boyfriend's beer at 1:25 and expected us to be gone  5 minutes afterwards. She said last call was at 1:15 and he wasn't supposed to get his beer at that time anyway. There is a major disconnect with what is supposed to happen with the staff. Why offer a diner level buffet at 1am for that price and expect a customer to be out the door by 1:30? Not only that, but a staff that repeatedly comes by to state that you need to leave while you're eating; along with a manager who is unable to 'manage' a situation except to blame others and be rude to customers. I have Never been to any restaurant that tries to kick you out in the middle of your meal...this is the first and definitely the Last time I ever stay at this hotel.

He gave us the dinner menu, and specifically told us to choose from these options. We did and we had a lovely dinner. At checkout, the bill was for U$S 434.41 (+ 18% gratuity included = U$S 71.82). That surprised us, since we where there for restaurant week expecting to spend half of what they charged. So we kindly ask Frank if there was any mistake, and he explained that we had chosen from the dinner menu, instead of the restaurant week. (as he told us to). All he said to us was ""I am sorry"".We went to the lady at the reception and explain the situation, and again, all she said was ""I am sorry, restaurant week is optional"". Yes, I know it is optional, that is why I requested that menu TWICE. And when I asked for an email to make the complaint, she just gave me the postcard with the Facebook and instagram contact.

It was atrocious. Our server was inattentive, rude, pushy, and later in our evening incredibly hostile. My party of five came to The View to take advantage of restaurant week. We were happy with the pre-fixe menu and while ordering we explicitly stated we wanted to stick to it and avoid the specials. The server seemed a bit pushy about the specials but we all brushed it off. (All servers have to upsell specials, I understand but she her tone wasn't appropriate.) During our meal, we had to ask other servers to replenish our drinks because our server couldn't be found. Not to our knowledge our server upgraded our entrees from the regular flank steak to filet mignon and it reflected so on the bill. Our party explained to her that we explicitly told her that we didn't want the special. So instead of dealing with this in a professional manner, she was loud and there was a lot of finger pointing. She couldn't own up to her mistake and we requested a manager. She didn't bother getting a manager and just adjusted our bill from 300 to 250. Temps reached 15C that evening and we were happy to be in such a pleasant restaurant. We wouldn't have expected our server to be as frigid and cold as the weather outside.

3.0,2/19/2015,"The experience here can be summarized in two parts; the view from the restaurant and the food.The view is amazing... Probably one of the best views you'll get in Manhattan. Add to that the rotating floor and you get a full view of Manhattan and even into Queens. It can make you slightly nauseous pending on if you have a weak stomach, but in all likelihood it's just an awesome experience.Now the food? Not so amazing. It's about as basic of buffet food as you can get. All the dishes are average and nothing seems like it took much effort to prepare. I had some of the breakfast buffet as well as the lunch buffet, and both were average at best. The dessert section looks amazing, but that too I found to be just ok.The unlimited mimosas were ok. Not the greatest champagne and a little too much OJ, but is was still ok. It's unlimited champagne at the end of the day so I learned to live with it after a few minutes.This is definitely a place for tourists. With all the amazing brunch places in the city, this place definitely doesn't hold a candle from a food standpoint. It's literally just about the view and nothing else.

1.0,12/31/2014,"i went upstairs to the view with my husband and mother-in-law after watching the illusionists at the theater below. although I fusually shy away from touristy places like this lounge, my mother-in-law insisted we go up for a drink, and so I conceded. besides, it's nice to soak in the nighttime view of manhattan while having a drink. $8  cover charge? fine - I get it, it's nyc. rotating restaurant? sure, cool for about 5 minutes and then it gets real old real fast. décor? think 90s style casino lounge, with the waitresses pretty much dressed in the same manner. nothing impressive, furniture, walls, etc. all decorated in that same dated feel. service? probably the worst I've received in my life, and I've been to my fair share of bars, restaurants, and lounges with less than stellar service. THE WAITRESS WROTE IN HER OWN TIP BEFORE HANDING US THE BILL. I have never been so offended in my entire life, and think it extraordinarily presumptuous and rude of her to do so. first of all, she stopped by once to take our orders, and once when we flagged her down for a re-order. We waited for 20 minutes trying to flag her down to get our check. Granted, the lounge had started to fill up around 10pm, but that is either her fault for not being able to handle her assigned section or management's fault for not staffing sections accordingly. When she gave us our bill she nonchalantly said ""you just need to sign the copy with the tip written in or leave cash,"" seemingly not to leave us any other choices.The original receipt had ""suggested tip"" in default percentages printed below, which is standard in the business. Our waitress decided to fill in the MERCHANT COPY of the receipt and WRITE IN WITH HER OWN HANDWRITING her desired tip amount (which of course, was the most generous of the three listed amounts). never in my life have I encountered such audacity from someone in the service industry. it is one thing to just charge tip outright, but it is another thing entirely to have it written in for you. I can see how many unknowing tourists can be taken advantage of through her actions and sincerely she got the reality check she needed with the less than pleasant note I left her calling her out on her actions. I brought this to the attention of a hostess, who at first was unwilling to offer an apology (shocker), until I described the events that had occurred to which she did apologize, but also stated ""it probably wasn't personal, so don't take it that way - sometimes the waitresses do that, that's why we leave 3 copies of receipts."" you leave 3 copies of receipts because the first is a bill, the second is a merchang copy, and the third is a customer copy. and I am truly appalled that this might even be a regular occurrence. needless to say, I will NOT be returning to this place, nor will I be recommending my out-of-town friends to visit here. there are SO many better alternatives in NYC than this place.",17,1,0,Diane P.,"New York, NY",145,109,121

We had reservations and were still seated as far away from the windows as you could get. I asked the hostess if there was a table available by the window and she said, ""sure if you want to go wait in line for 30 minutes with everyone else"". Really?? Note to self: against all logic, don't make reservations if you want a good table. So we spent the evening staring at the nice Chinese family and the couple making out, both of whom were between us and the view (which we obviously can't vouch for, but from what we saw, it wasn't that spectacular and DEFINITELY not worth the experience). I honestly can't even remember what we ordered, it was that exciting. I had some sort of chicken that was plain and nondescript. The desserts were not good at all and we had an apple thing that was really weird. Not much of the meal was edible. My husband and I travel pretty often and this is the most money we've spent on a meal for the two of us ever. It was almost $250 for the two of us and we each had I believe maybe one drink each, 1 appetizer, our meals, and each a dessert. Even if the food would have been decent it still would've been too much of a stretch to say the price was worth it, but considering the food was nondescript at best and horrible at worst and the hostess was completely rude, this place was absolutely ridiculous. There's no worse feeling than the feeling that you've been taken....and that's exactly how we felt. It was our first night visiting NYC and it cast a negative tone on our whole trip from there on out. This was by far one of our worst meals ever all around. It inspired my husband's new travel rule to never eat at hotel restaurants.

5.0,10/26/2014,"My wife and I went to get drinks at the View lounge based on the recommendation of close friends. We were not disappointed. The View is located in the Marriott Marquis hotel in Times Square. The hotel was a bit of a maze since we had to find the entrance through the parking garage located behind the Marquis Theater, between 45th and 46th streets. To get to the View, you must go up the escalator and then circle back to the entrance for the lift. The lift for the View is in the very back. The line to the lift took about 10 minutes.  Warning: if you are not a fan of heights, I recommend you face the lift entry since it is a rather high lift! The ride is smooth and fast.Upon arrival, you will be directed left or right based upon if you made a reservation or not. We did not make a reservation and we waited for about 5 minutes in the evening.Once you arrive, you should take note of the view of the city!For drinks: $8 beer. No draft. All bottled. Wine comes in glasses and bottles and ranges in prices from about $13 to $350. (Most glasses are in the $13-$25 range) They should also alert you to an $8/person charge for guests who are not staying at the hotel. My wife and I got a glass of Seven Falls Merlot and a MacMurray Ranch Pinot Noir. Both came in clean red wine glasses. (Just under room temperature, aerated) They also offer liquors, cocktails, and other such drinks expected from a full bar. The servers were friendly and informative, but rather busy.One of the items you will receive when you are seated is a napkin with a 360 degree drawing of the surrounding high rise buildings. (According to my wife, it takes 1 hour to complete one full rotation) This is a great game to indulge in if you don't have better things to talk about.In summary: my wife and I had a delightful adventure going to grab drinks at the View.

Once seated, yes, the view is amazing and the place is very nice.  The buffet is 38$ per person with an additional 8$ cover charge after 8 p.m. but for a special occasion or something you will only do once in a while it was worth it. I thought the buffet was very nice and there was a large selection of desserts. Staff was friendly. You can also order the dessert and cheese option for less money.  You also have the option of a sit down menu in the restaurant which is one flight below the buffet and lounge area.  I would go back for a special occasion.  Enjoyed the place.

3.0,9/4/2014,"We came in on a whim after seeing an ad near the elevators. ATMOSPHERE:It's a revolving restaurant that takes about 1 hour to do a complete rotation.  The views are amazing being on the 47th or so floor of the Marriott Marquis.  There are tables for two along the viewing windows and larger tables on the second and third rows in.  It's dimly lit and decorated with modern cues.  It wasn't crowded at all on a Tuesday night. MENU:Unfortunately it's buffet style eating only.  A bit steep at $38 for maybe 4 different entrees, salad bar, and dessert station.  We passed on food as it looked unimpressive and we're not buffet fans. BEVERAGE:Brooklyn Brewery Lager - Whew $8 a bottle (even for big domestic brands like Bud!?)  Oh well, we had a great time and that's what matters.  Imports are 50-cents more. SERVICE:Our server Pete was very friendly and professional.  TIP:They have an $8 cover charge if you're not a hotel guest, and there is a 1 drink order minimum for everyone.

My friend had the pork belly and it was deliciously salty.   I had the Strip Steak which didn't look that great but boy was it tasty. The sides were intriquing--creamed cabbage and some kind of cooked endive. All yummy.

They were very nice, friendly and always made sure to be on hand should you need anything. Two thumbs up to the service!The food, was OK. Like I said earlier, I am glad we only paid half the price. I had the tortellini as an appetizer and it was a little bland. My boyfriend had the tomato salad, which was tasty.  I had the sea bass which tasted very salty, but the sides made up for the dish. My boyfriend had the flat iron steak which was soo small, I was embarassed of how tiny of a portion it was. The menu also said it came with steak fries. His dish came out with A steak fry. wth?  Finally we got the passion fruit mouse which was ok, and the hazelnut crunch cake which was the better choice.

Restaurant week menu/prices are available year-round which is a huge plus and makes it pretty affordable, not just for special occasions. However, we were kind of tricked into ordering from the regular (expensive) menu, which I didn't like, but because it was a special occasion, didn't mind. Definitely worth it to try.

My first course was tortellini with some type of pesto sauce: it was ok, but I have had much better at other restaurants for a quarter of the price. Plus there were only maybe six noodles. My main course was a flatiron steak with a potato wedge and three carrot sticks. The flatiron was quite small and not nearly tender enough. The potato wedge and carrots were bland and also small portions.

Once in the restaurant we tell them that we have a reservation but are told there is still a half an hour wait and give us a buzzer, kind of annoying, that is why you get a reservation, but we are pretty easy going. We are made to wait in line at the lounge for a seat to wait as well, also annoying. Once seated for dinner we both selected off of the Pre-fixed menu. Our appetizers were OK at best, the crab cakes did not taste fresh or homemade and the cheese with the ravioli had a weird taste in my opinion and I like most cheeses.

The first clue that The View was not going to be great could have been the location. As someone who grew up in NY, I learned pretty quickly that anything within a block of times square is going to be a tourist trap, and The View was no exception. The restaurant was not particularly difficult to find, there are a number of gigantic signs pointing you in the correct direction and a receptionist who's attitude suggested that 99% of their job is point people to the correct elevators. We go up, have a reservation (which was completely unnecessary despite the hostess insisting up on it when we called a week prior). The food was OK, but not what I would have liked for an $84 prix fix. We were offered glasses of water at the beginning of the meal which turned out to mean a $10 bottle of Zico that I'm fairly certain was just filled with tap. Though I'm a big fan of city water, I'm not a fan of paying for it.Without rattling off a list of things I wasn't too into, it's easiest to say that The View is ""tourist fancy"".

We were ready to leave but one of my friends had her heart set on staying there - drinks were just fruit juice! Never Never Never! They need a dress code - I would have done better to find a diner on the streets than this place. Lesson learned you don't always get what you pay for. We did stay in the hotel.

3.0,7/10/2014,I came here for an anniversary of sorts because I had been obsessed with the idea of a spinning dining room with rooftop views of the city. Disappointingly though we had mentioned this was an anniversary they couldn't/wouldn't accommodate us having a window side view regardless not sure if the food suffered on the account of the fact that it was restaurant week (which we didn't participate in) when we came here but for the price - the food was subpar. People (guests) were dressed inappropriately but I must say the service was attentive and friendly.

It was supposed to be a special evening, and when my husband made the reservation he was told they would take care of us. This was a total lie to get us in the restaurant. The entrance to the restaurant was crowded, we had to wait on a long line just to tell the hostess we had dinner reservations. Then once we were called we were sat away from the window so it was hard to see the view. What's the point in coming here and spending money on a very expensive dinner if we can't see the view! I was disgusted at this point and it ruined my night. When i mentioned what was said to my husband they could care less, we were told if we wanted a window seat we would have to wait an extra 40 minutes. There were no other options or apologies given to us, just a shoulder shrug like oh well. This made it even more uncomfortable for me to even stay here. I didn't feel welcomed at all. On the bright side our waiter was very nice and did the best he could to make it a nice night but by then I was already disgusted. To top it all off my dinner was not at all worth the money, not good food at all. My lamb was dry and tough to chew, and my crab cake was mushy and wet in the middle. The cheesecake was nice.

I spoke to the restaurant the day before we came to explain this and asked if they had an alternative dairy free dessert or something they could do for her birthday. They said no problem. I also asked for a window table in a previous phone call over a week in advance when i made the reservation.  We had to wait for the window table and the waitress had no idea it was (a) her birthday and (b) that she was dairy free. It was as if my call never happened.  Every other special occasion dinner we've ever had in NYC, the restaurant remembered she was dairy free when we got there. When you're paying this over priced amount for dinner, the restaurant should remember a fact like that.   Anyway, we got what i expected.

They also stagger your dinner so that it takes about 2.5 hours. You really get to enjoy the atmosphere and experience!We sat at a table on the ""inside"" ring at first and then our server (kindly) moved us to the outer ring by the windows. I have to say that the view by the window was only like 20% better than the other view we had, so don't stress out if you're not on the outside! We talk a lot during our meals, so we didn't spend a lot of time gazing out, but it was a very interesting setting for a romantic date as the views kept changing inside and outside! Honestly, my favorite part of our meal was our cocktails. I had one called American Honey that was SO GOOD! I'm obsessed with honey whiskey, so it really hit the spot for me.

(The cheese, I kid you not, stood alone.)  If this were Sizzler, fine.  But for $34 dollars there better be hot fudge sundaes, cheesecakes, and actual yummy things present.  I had four chocolate covered strawberries and two cream puffs.  Hardly worth the money!I guess the view is OKAY.  This could be because I've grown up in the area and I'm used to seeing New York City on a daily basis.  The room spins and I guess that's kind of cool (and confusing when you go back for seconds at the buffet).  Maybe tourists will truly be in awe and the price is worth it just for that.  This is why I give 2 stars.All that to say, there are better places in New York City to spend your hard-earned cash.  I cannot review the food since I only had dessert, but in passing the regular buffet, it looked just as sad as that lonely cheese.",4,3,2,Linda S.,"New York, NY",129,68,4

4.0,2/1/2014,"I'm kind of confused to see an overall rating of 3 stars when we had an amazing experience. It was actually close to 5-star because I think there wasn't anything that could be done better, we had a great evening. Made a reservation for 5:30pm on a Friday night before seeing a show. They say about 2 hours for the entire experience and they were right. They open at 5:30 so we were basically the first ones there and got a lot of attention. It's a prix fixe menu, app/entree/dessert $84 which is totally reasonable for THAT place, THAT view, the food and the fact you're in NYC. You won't get away with much cheaper than that at any equivalent restaurant. We decided on two glasses of wine (here's the expensive part) and ordered our apps, I had the Octopus (to DIE for) and my Mom ordered the Greens Salad. I'm not sure if I've ever had Octopus cooked like that before (not fried) with marinated mushrooms and blood orange reduction. It was so fantastic. We basically inhaled those while enjoying the 'view'. Waiters would come by every 1/4 turn or so and point out the buildings for us - the cocktail napkin was also a little view map. It was dark so definitely difficult to see. Our main course was up next which I opted for the Venison Tenderloin, my eyes went right to this on the menu and I didn't look anywhere else. It was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection with golden beets and mashed potatoes. My Mom ordered the Filet Mignon and it was some of the most tender steak I have ever had. We went with a lighter fare for dessert, which was some pear and ice cream pairing- but it was still a lot of food! It was a (what seemed to be) a chocolate covered piece of cake, banana, pear and some ice cream. We had a really great evening and couldn't stop talking about how my dad and my hub would have really enjoyed dinner here as well. There's a coat check down at ground level that you must use and you are then directed to elevators F or G which take you up to the 48th floor. You are greeted by a hostess and ordered to go to the left for the Buffet or to the right for dinner reservations. You go down a flight to the reservation level---all while the outside of the restaurant spins. Our waiters were OH so kind and really great.

You will love it!-An experience that you simply will not get anywhere else!The bads:-The waiting time. I personally haven't had any problems with getting a table however the service while sitting at the table is terrible. The waiters and waitresses  are way too undermanned and when you get a chance to order expect a long waiting time to get it to your table. Make sure you have plenty of time here!-The food was poor (the dessert buffet was great though)-Expensive!

3.0,1/25/2014,"I visited this place last year during summer restaurant week. This place sounds fancy. It is located on the very top of a tall building and it is a rotating restaurant. But, the view is just so so. Actually, I went in there before sunset, it did make me feel dizzying. Eating. Eating while the floor is moving, which is not a comfortable experience to me. Food is okay, to me, which means I probably won't go there for a second time without a specific reason. But, food is without much condiment.

2.0,1/14/2014,"There is only one reason to go here, namely the view.  it's the only rotating restaurant in New York City and the view of the city is great.Other than that, the cocktails are just OK, as is the food.  The View Bar has possibly the most ridiculous ""buffet"" I've ever seen.  For a mere $38, you can ""treat"" yourself to Smartie's (you know, those small, compressed, sugar candies that are rolled into a cellophane tube), tootsie pops (no joke), and some extremely sub-par cheese and/or desert pastry.  A single $38 bucks at Costco would cover the cost of everything they offer on the buffet (if you don't count the odd looking chocolate fountain that looks like it was ""lifted"" from someone's birthday party).The restaurant, which is one floor down, is better, but not stellar.  In fact, the only notable part of my dinner was the service, which was very solid.  It's about $150 a person for dinner if you have the wine pairing (two sub-par wines - one for your starter and one for your entree).  Again, way, way, way overpriced, even for Time Square.So, back to why you might want to go - the view.  My recommendation is to go to the bar, order a $17 cocktail (it won't make you gag, but won't tantalize your palate either), enjoy the view, then go somewhere else to eat.  There are plenty of great spots nearby.",7,4,2,David H.,"Happy Valley, OR",11,133,6

2.0,12/26/2013,"Ok. I'll admit, I made this reservation knowing full well that the food would be meh from all the reviews. However, I didn't expect that our view would be mediocre and that our service would be so rude! For one, I made the reservation for seven people two weeks in advance and asked for a table close to the windows since, as tourists, we really wanted to get that New York view. Let's just say, I didn't see anything unless I wanted to break my neck because I had to crane my neck at odd angles since they seated us next to one of the buttresses. That really upset me since I had wanted to give my grandparents' a beautiful view of the city at night. The decor was also a little outdated; that carpeting should go back to the 90's and stay there.Then, the service was just atrocious. We arrived roughly fifteen minutes earlier than our reservation, but still had to wait an additional thirty before we could be seated (which I found ridiculous since the restaurant was only 80% full, at most). Though, that probably wouldn't have bothered me much, to be honest, if the hostesses didn't break a cardinal rule in my book -- they started to smack-talk the diners when they weren't in earshot. Seriously? That's just rude, especially when done within earshot of another diner. It made the initial impression really off-putting. Our waiter was nice enough; he got a little miffed when only half the table ordered wine though. After he got our orders, he practically vanished for the rest of the evening and we were serviced by a secondary waiter for the rest of the night. I feel awful for not getting his name, but the second waiter was great; he was middle-aged, super funny, and friendly -- our glasses were never empty. The food was pretty good too. The menu is a three course prix-fixe at $79 per person. I forgot what everyone ordered, but the general consensus was that it was pretty decent. My lamb was cooked perfectly -- no smell and had great flavor. Dessert was a little disappointing for me though. Somehow, they managed to ruin tiramisu. Served as a glob of cream and topped with a chocolate disk and some flowers, it tasted awful; the flowers made everything taste so bitter that I couldn't even finish it (and I usually LOVE my tiramisu).For $80+ per person that night, I really expected something better. The concept of the restaurant is great and utterly unique, but it's execution and management is atrocious and I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone visiting New York when you can go elsewhere and get your money's worth. The only reason this isn't a one star review is because of the friendly waiter and my lamb. To end this awful review on a funny note, my grandmother got lost going to the restroom because they're located in the center of the restaurant, which doesn't move. So when she came out the same way, the restaurant had completely flipped around. Luckily, my grandfather knew she would get lost and sent me to go get her back. xD Ahh, the joys of being married for 50+ years.Pro-tip: If you get motion sickness easily, I suggest taking precautions.

3.0,11/11/2013,"This is exactly what you would expect.  Tourist/special event location.  Foodies, this is NOT for you.  Budget eaters, NO.  What it is is a revolving restaurant 48 floors above Times Square.  That's it.  So, this is where you go for a memorable view or an event (we did my daughter's birthday for her and her friends).  There is no other restaurant like this in Manhattan any longer.  Make a reservation.  Do not show up and expect a nice table.  Won't happen.  Make the reservation a couple of days in advance and show up 15 minutes early.  In the reserved dining area there are no tables with a bad view.  I have never eaten in the upstairs portion (where they seat you without a reservation).  They have a set menu downstairs.  It's 80$ per person plus drinks and add ons.  Expect about 100 per person (more if you want lots of drinks).  You will see all sorts of things around Manhattan like the Chrysler building, The Empire State Building, etc.  It is very nice.  We saw a proposal.  The service is ok.  The food is way overpriced.  The drinks, overpriced.  I will say, the lamb I had was perfectly cooked and tasty.  The starter was not so great (and was a 10$ upcharge), the desserts ranged from ok, to meh.  So...this is not for the food, ok.  It's for the View.  That's what you are paying for here.   Oh, the elevators... In the Marriott Marquis, you type in the floor you want on the keypad (if you entered like most people you need to go to three and then go to 48 in the special View elevators).  The keypad will tell you which elevator to get in.  Do NOT get in any elevator where the doors open, there are no buttons and you will just have to ride to some other floor and then get off.  Remember, if you don't have a reservation (all the info is on this site to make one easily) you will wait for hours for a table (nothing is worth that).Anyway, if you want a memorable dinner or lunch with a view of Manhattan while you eat, try it.  If you wanted great food, cheap prices, this is not what you are seeking (there is a wide collection of great food being sold by guys from carts (I'm not being sarcastic) where you can get a great meal for 10$ right outside.  This is for special occasions (maybe once or twice in your life).",8,0,0,Doug W.,"Warren, RI",5,121,1

First, our cocktail waitress, who was rude and clearly hated her job, informed me there would be an $8 ""cover charge"" added to our bill. I asked if there was some sort of entertainment that I was not aware of. Nope. It's just a fee automatically tacked on to non-hotel guests visiting the lounge after 8pm. Fine.

Our server, Frank came off a bit standoffish and a man of few words. I didn't think much of it until I saw him rolled his eyes at one of my guests when she couldn't decide what drink to order. I already knew this is going to be a long & dreadful night.A few moments later, one of my other guest heard frank say, ""oh gosh"", when we told him we needed a few more minutes to place our order. That's when I got upset and went to the front desk and ask for the manager. Normally, I would have walked out of the restaurant and make a scene with the waiter for being so rude and obnoxious but since we were with other guests, I had to stay.The manager, Roberto was very kind and he was accommodating once I explained the situation to him. He said he would switched our table and give us a new server. I told him if anything, changing the server was all we needed since we already sat down and had our water.We had new servers, Brian and Reeta and they were both very polite and nice.Would I go back to The View? No. I wouldn't.The service is one of my biggest pet peeves and I wouldn't tolerate anything less especially when gratuity is always included with big groups.

Well, being in the service business, maybe  Frank should think about working at a place where servicing customers is not his top priority.As for the food, the gnocchi & fillet cod was good but it wasn't outstanding.

2.0,8/11/2013,"The only reason why this restaurant is not getting a 1 star review is due to the semi-decent view, its iconic location and the nice waitress we had the night we were there.I took my parents there while they were in town visiting. For $80 per person PRIX-FIXE menu, I was expecting at least semi-decent food. We all got barely chewable food, dessert that probably came from a box and a giant bill to boot. Between the 3 of us, we tried the Hamachi Crudo (tiny portion but the only thing that was semi-edible out of the meal, fish didn't taste that fresh though), Jumbo shrimp (definitely over cooked and barely chewable), Potato Gnocchi (tasted like warmed up frozen food), Filet Mignon (cooked medium, but the meat was so tough that the knife couldn't cut through), Saddle of Lamb (also very tough and took a long time to chew before I could swallow), seared red snapper (salty with no flavor and tasted like cardboard), chocolate tarte (too sweet and not warm enough), cheesecake (definitely tasted like it came from a prepackaged box and Tiramisu (it was gross).I try to operate based on ""if you don't have something nice to say, then don't say nothing at all."" So it's rare that I post such a negative review. Usually, if the restaurant fail to deliver, I just remember not to go back and keep my mouth shut. But in this case, I thought it's fair to post my personal experience online so that other tourists and locals have the information to make the right choices. If you want a great view of the city, go up to the empire state building or the Rockefeller to get the view, take some pictures and go somewhere else for dinner. If you want a great dining experience, make reservation at Jean George, Le Cirque, Daniel, City Lobster or the plethora of other fine restaurant options in New York City. Don't try to combine the 2 experiences by visiting ""The View"".I got coffee to go with my dessert. None of us got drinks and we all had free water. Total damage to my Amex was $320. I don't regret doing it, since a lot of things, good or bad, are worth doing it at least once, but I will never do it again.I have reasonable standards in terms of what a restaurant should serve up to their customers, without the view and the time square location supported mostly by tourism, this restaurant will never survive given its food offerings.

Service HERE was top notch, always filling up water, asking if we were great and all. The view is pretty sweet and honestly, you could spend 38 dollars at worse establishmentsBuffet 2 star review....Now let me start by saying I like buffets, and the food here was alright. Nothing special/great, but not horrible at all. It was actually decent. Vegetables were fresh, most dishes were tasty. It just wasnt worth 60 dollars, not even for the view. I'd say about 50 dollars MAX. But what was the worse thing was our server. Checked on us maybe about once during our 2.5 hour stay there. When time for a check came, I asked her for it and it took her 25 minutes for her to bring it to us, and thats only when we saw her rushing past, she starting giving a hissy fit on how she was busy and slammed the check on the table.Honestly, If we didnt have the gratuity added (table of 6) I wouldn't of tipped her. Servers like her give the restaurant a bad name. I've dealt with customer service before. A simple smile, sincere apology saying i've been busy would of been fine without being snippy.That said, Restauraunt week deal is great check it out. Anything else? Not so sure.",0,0,0,Darryll S.,"Manhattan, NY",201,237,61
2.0,8/6/2013,"My husband and I picked this place for us to go to during restaurant week.  We went a few minutes early for our reservation and was able to get a window seat.  It was still very light out while we were there so the views were not great.  We saw a lot of the sides of buildings and the roofs of some smaller buildings next door.  I felt the waitress we had was a little put off that we were ordering off the restaurant week menu.  She tried to talk us out of it saying that the portions were very small.  Fair warning but we still wanted to order off the restaurant week menu.  I mean why participate in restaurant week if you don't really want people to come?  After that point, she was very aloof with us.  I noticed she was very chatty with her other tables but was noticeably silent with us.  We were very polite with her, saying thank you after she brought us anything and she didn't utter a single ""you're welcome.""As for the food:Appetizer: We both had potato gnocchi with sundried tomatoes and smoked bacon.  It seems the plates were prepared before hand and just sitting waiting to be brought out because it was brought out rather quickly and was cold!  The gnocchi were a little gummy.  However, the portion size was rather large for an appetizer.Entrée: I had the goat cheese ravioli and my husband had the steak.  His steak was cooked perfectly and the portion was indeed small (by my husband's standards!), maybe a 4-6oz with garlic mashed potatoes and some artfully presented roasted carrots and string beans.  That portion was a perfect size meal for me though.  My meal on the other hand was microscopic.  I had exactly 4 small raviolis with some snap peas and spring pea foam.  I think for a dish such as ravioli that the small portion was way too small.Dessert:  Best part of the meal!  I had the molten center chocolate cake and hubby had the cheesecake.  Both were full size portions.  Both were so rich and decadent.  Loved the raspberry sorbet that came with my chocolate cake.  Then we got the bill and found that the gratuity was already added to it!  I'm always a big tipper so I would have given the 18% but it said on the menu that gratuity is only added to the bill when your party has 6 or more people.  Ridiculous practice to add the gratuity for just 2 people!!!  Overall, as most touristy restaurants are, this place is overrated.  There are so many other nicer places in the city to go to.  Don't waste your time.",0,0,0,Andera B.,"SOUTH RICHMOND HILL, NY",2,66,2

So you can see great views of the whole city. Be sure to make a reservation if you want any hope of having a table by the window! The prix-fixe has a lot of great options on it.

Courses were served quickly, which was great because we had tickets to a show. Portions were smaller than normal, probably because of the Restaurant Week promotion, but we did not leave hungry! Dessert was the highlight - strongly recommend the NY cheesecake and the warm chocolate tart - they even gave us a chocolate mousse anniversary cake on the house!

4.0,7/10/2013,"We had an outstanding meal at The View! The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the snotty hostesses at the front seating us. We asked for a different table, even though the whole restaurant is revolving so you would eventually get to see the entire view of NYC, she turned up her nose and didn't speak to us. Just walked us back to the other hostess where she looked annoyed and they discussed the matter like it was some big ass deal and then said to follow her to a different table, which was much better! So for that reason, they lose a star! But, our waitress was pretty good, not great, but not bad. The food is what made up for everything and of course the view. Amazing! My 15 year old daughter was thrilled to be in a restaurant that revolved. It was a great experience for the whole family. I had the filet mignon which was cooked to perfection.

For the price of the 3-course, I expected a jacket minimum, but there was no such. All they needed was a reservation. The buffett upstairs was atleast a third of the price with more options.Having said that, the food was actually pretty good and the options were plenty enough. The server was friendly and the drinks were nice (again, read pricey).

1.0,7/2/2013,"Where do I even begin?Decided to come here for dinner with a friend while we were visiting Manhattan. I guess I should have done more research as we didn't think we would need a reservation. The hostess was actually very rude and told us we wouldn't be able to sit near a window, but shortly after we were seated another pair came in without a reservation and received window seating by another hostess. Should have been our first clue to get up and walk out.Service was really inattentive and the food was less than mediocre. For the $79 prix fixe menu, I chose the jumbo shrimp as my appetizer and I swear to God it was still frozen. Strike one. The filet mignon was GRAY, pretty flavorless, and even lacking in that yummy meaty umami flavor that I love so much. The cheesecake was way too sweet and I couldn't stand more than a few bites. I don't think I've ever met a cheesecake that I didn't like before. So disappointing.For the dinner, one drink each, plus tax & tip we spent over $120/each, which was a HUGE waste of money. We didn't have much of view and the shaking/rocking from the rotation made me slightly nauseous. Both the service and food were also incredibly LACKING. There are so many other, much more fabulous places you could go in Manhattan for a similar price point.

I might take an out-of-towner here for a drink only. But I've been to much better lounges honestly. No offense to this place, but it just didn't ""pop"" for me.* Staff is super friendly & nice.* Yes, it touristy. What do you expect? A bunch of pretentious, depressed NY-ers instead?

Stone rose lounge's cocktails aren't even that much and they are MUCH better & stronger.* Music could be much better. Not old early-mid 90's only...Spot is okay.

1.0,6/3/2013,"Never in my life have I been treated so rudely at a restaurant. Some friends of mine were visiting NYC and we decided to kill some time with a drink before our reservations at Peter Lugars at 9:30 pm. We took the elevator up to the 8th floor to use the restroom, then down to the 3rd floor so we could take the express elevator to the restaurant. As we entered the restaurant at 7:55 pm, the host informed us that we would have to order a drink if we wanted to sit in the restaurant, which was totally fine because we had some time to kill.  There was a large group of tourists standing in front of the reservations desk, so the host walked us behind the desk so we could bypass the group. He sat us at a table, handed us the menus, then walked away.We started looking at the drinks menu - it was pricy, but nothing too outrageous for SF or NYC - maybe $15 for a cocktail?  Five minutes goes by, then ten...  We're still sitting and waiting for out waiter when one of my friends notices the disclaimer printed in the front of the menu that all patrons leaving after 8pm must pay a cover charge of $8 a person unless they are staying at the hotel.I couldn't believe it!  The host hadn't said anything when he seated us, otherwise we definitely wouldn't have gone in.  So then the waiter finally comes over after another couple of minutes and we politely ask if we can have the fee waived since we were planning on ordering cocktails, not to mention the host didn't tell us. The waiter proceeded to argue with us, saying there were three signs on the way into the restaurant and that there was no waiving of the fee ever.We asked for the manager, and while we were waiting for her, one of my friends went to look for these signs and sure enough, it was exactly where the large group of tourists had been standing, blocking it from view.  However, even if we had seen it, the sign was written in very small letters, something that was super easy to miss as part of random signage.The manager came out and we explained the situation - that there had been a large crowd blocking the sign, the host didn't warn us, blah blah blah - but she said it didn't matter. She said it was shown on a rotating video screen down in the elevator banks (when we later checked, it was not) and one other location outside the elevator banks (which we never saw having come down from inside the building on the 8th floor and not from the street).At this point, we were all so angry that they were being unreasonable and that we had to wait almost 15 minutes to speak to a waiter, we didn't want to get a drink anymore.  The manager at this point offered to let us pay only half the cover charge (so generous!), but at this point we were all upset on principle.  It was clear they'd had problems before with people coming up from Times Square, looking at the view for free and then leaving, but then verbally tell people at the door so stuff like this doesn't happen.  Or at least have half a brain to go ask the host if our story about the group blocking the sign was true.  I honestly don't understand how short sighted the Marriott can be.  Isn't it worse for your paying customers to have to keep witnessing these angry scenes than it would be to say institute a 1 drink minimum?  And further, not only did they lose our business that day and probably pissed off the surrounding patrons, I have no intention on staying at a Marriott hotel anytime in the future.  They have lost me as a customer for life over four lousy dollars.  Ridiculous.",2,0,0,Codarus C.,"San Mateo, CA",61,66,14

He then looked at us with surprise like he couldn't fathom we could afford to eat at the restaurant let alone have reservations.  This brief however ignorant encounter left us both with a very bad taste in our mouth.  I'm not sure what his issue with us was but if he did it us I'm sure we aren't the only ones.  It's sad but clearly we still live in a time and place where people make assumptions about you based on the color of your skin.  i",3,1,0,Dianna J.,"Pomona, CA",0,41,8

Since two more people were yet to arrive, we were told to have a seat near the entrance and wait till everyone arrived to be seated. As the two of us were waiting, I was curious to find out if they have the buffet for dinner as well and she told me 'that's at the lounge!' and that we were waiting at the wrong place. Funny because one of their associates or staff directed me here to the restaurant for the buffet prior. Staff here are definitely poorly trained by management that seems non-existent or too drunk to pay attention to details (I was a former restaurant supervisor at the Marriott down in DC for a good 3 years so I KNOW what I'm talking about). So what are the Pros and Cons?_______________________________________________________________Pros:NOTHING. Maybe if you're one of those suburban or rural countrychicks from somewhere like North Dakota or Idaho and want to 'experience' New York by eating at a high-floor restaurant with views of Midtown, this is the place for you.Cons:VIEW: Well, I thought it was going to WOW me like TOKYO Park Hyatt Hotel's NEW YORK GRILL which probably has views that are at least a billion times better than this crappy semi-blocked view of Midtown and the Hudson River/New Jersey. So yeah it's rotating but does it get any better?? NOPE, ABSOFUCKINGLUTELY NOT, the crappy 230 5th rooftop lounge does a better job on this one I swear!ATMOSPHERE:Casual. This place really does rely itself on the backdrop of Midtown and Hudson River and that's about it. NO background music (despite being a lounge) and no decor, no NOTHING. Crowd are mostly TOURISTS, 20 something out-of-towners like those slutty Jersey Shore types, Europeans, Senior Citizens, people speaking French, etc a total chaos? you got it~FOOD: DO NOT GET THE BUFFET!!!!!!! I mean it just DO NOT!!! If you feel like paying $37+$8 mandatory cover charge after 8pm+mandatory 1 drink per person (drinks are around $13-15) for mediocre, overpriced, low-quality food, this is the place for you. Sure, it sounds tempting with three types of meat like Chicken, Beef,  a Pasta Station (it's NOT a Pasta Station where they have Alfredo, Pesto, Marinara sauce out with different types of pastas but just a small station of cold pasta-type salads like Anti-pasti, Macaroni Salad, fake ""Pad Thai"", etc), Cheese station, and Desserts, but it is SO NOT worth it!!! SERVICE:-The self-important pretentious African American hostess both at the restaurant and the lobby lounge didn't know what she was doing. Warm and Friendly Hospitaltiy was basically out this season for her. She was NASTY, COLD, and PRETENTIOUS to ALL the guests and visitors to the restaurant...yeah higher than a Motherfucker (thank you Nicki Minaj)-I NEVER saw the waitress nor did we get water. The only time I saw her was probably when she brought out our drinks. Funny how it's a super touristy and busy place but servers were NOWHERE to be found and there was NO 'How's everything? Do you need anything else?' N.O.T.H.I.N.G.-The probably 'recent college grad' Latino guy dressed in a suit who was literally just  'there' at the entrance of the restaurant. I overheard an mid-aged lady ask him ""what's the easiest way to tell my guest to get up here without them getting lost' and he was like ""Umm, umm, I don't know....umm, tell them to take the elevator up to...um....the VIEW"". WTF seriously??????-Bathroom attendant constantly saying 'Hello sir, how are you? Have a good day sir' with an underlying tone that kind of gives off the 'I poured you soap and gave you a paper towel so give me TIP!!"" No, I don't want to because I have my own hands for that. Thank you VERY MUCH. _______________________________________________________________Overall, if you're a local, DO NOT COME HERE, it was probably the WORST $55 of my life for the crappiest service and mediocre overpriced food. Could've gone to a nicer restaurant downtown but we were too hungry to venture far from Midtown. If you're a tourist, of course you will NOT listen to me and come here because you think TIMES SQUARE is what  'NEW YORK' is really about.

4.0,3/17/2013,"So yes, everyone has mentioned, it is ridiculously expensive. $8 cover (after 8PM or something like that, if you are not a guest of the hotel) plus you are required to purchase something. With a non-alcoholic drink starting at $6 (coke), you're destined to pay at least $14 + tax and tip just for the privledge to sit there. But it really is such a privledge. I took my mother-in-law there recently. She's visiting from north Africa, and it took her breath away. It was priceless. She felt special sitting up there in the dimly lit lounge area, sipping her coke and watching the skyline. Some advice...First, do make sure you get a nice table. For larger parties it is harder. I noticed a party of 6 sitting at a table farthest from the window...and I saw their reaction when the bill came. They'd purchased hot chocolates for the teenagers and the women had each had a drink, but they forgot about the $48 cover charge...the bill must have been easily $100, and the teens spent most of their time laughing and texting on their phones. I don't think any of them actually looked out the window to enjoy the view, which would have been difficult anyway because their seats were crummy. So yes, that family was a little upset/shocked. And this must happen often. Our waitress definitely asked first thing if we knew about the cover charge. Second, consider the dessert buffet. It is $19/person, but it is yummy and special. Third, come for the view/experience. If you're looking for a night out for good drinks and conversation, move on. This really is about the experience. Don't come for the food.

3.0,2/5/2013,"It is with commendable accuracy this restaurant is called ""The View"" and not ""The Food"".  Indeed, though it's not as if we suffered through our three courses. Considering the location, we did find our meal within the reasonable boundaries of our expectations.  We were in New York for a long weekend and wanted to take advantage of restaurant week. In some cases, restaurant week took advantage of us.My wife started with the Potato Gnocchi. It was prepared perfectly, accompanied by a wonderfully flavored sauce. Not too chewy or overdone. Things we're looking up. It turned out to be the best part of the meal. Her entree was Grilled Salmon... not her best choice. Seriously overdone on one end. In retrospect, we should have returned it. I started with the Potato & Leek soup, It was very good with a little drizzle of pesto, nice touch. My entree was the Braised Short Rib. Surprisingly bland. For dessert we shared a slice of cheesecake and a piece of Black Forrest cake. Other than the soup and Gnocchi, the food and plating was marginal and lesser quality than of other establishments offering the same. Prior to seating we had a little dust up with the hostess regarding our table. That's always fun. Well in advance I reserved a table, called to confirm the day of and spoke to someone regarding a window table. No lives were lost, but I was disappointed when we were shuttled to a ""non window table"". I mean, come on - really ? - I realize it's about the timing of other diners as well, but .. I will also elect to mention at this time there were plenty of window tables... hmm.. Our waiter was wonderful and we did finally move to a window table for dessert. In summary, I would think that a restaurant in which the very name depends on the aesthetic would be looking and feeling a little more up to date. You dine 48 floors above the city. The Restaurant revolves. The food wasn't up to snuff, but we expected that. You don't go to Disneyland for the fried chicken. However within the confines of that statement, we enjoyed ourselves.

I see a lot of other reviews complaining about the price etc.  But what do you expect, you are paying for fine dining and an amazing view of NYC skyline 49 stories high.The View has a rotating floor, but the best part is the food.  The filet Mignon I ordered was amazing.  So juicy and tender, easy to cut through and cooked to perfection - medium just the way I like it.

We ordered a side dish of mushrooms but definitely did not finish those between the two of us.   My dirty martini was made perfectly and my glass of water was always full.  The service on a busy Christmas weekend was on point; the waiter did not skip a beat.My only concern about The View, was ""The View"" of the W Hotel Time Square.  I actually stayed at the W Hotel last summer with a group of girlfriends and our only complaint was the silhouette bathrooms - we could literally see the color of each other undies through the walls etc.  Very see through.  So while, having dinner.... yes, the W was across the way and you could see directly into peoples hotel rooms as well as into their ""silhouette"" bathrooms.

2.0,12/28/2012,"On my first trip to NYC I really wanted to experience everything, including dinner on the 48th floor of the Marriott near Time Square. We searched prior to our arrival for a restaurant with fantastic food and a fantastic food, unfortunately we only one of our needs was met.Our first warning sign should have been the pre-fixed meal and the buffet option, however we thought it could be overcome by the restaurants view which rotates to give the diner a 360 view of the Manhattan skyline. Menu options included NY Strip, Filet Mignon, and Kabocha Pumpkin Ravioli for myself (the vegetarian). Each sounded delicious at first glance, so we made a reservation for 8:30 PM and anxiously awaited for Thursday night to arrive.We decided to arrive 20 minutes early to ensure we had the correct location and possibly grab a drink in the bar, however we instead spent the 20 minutes waiting in que similar to a line at Disneyland. A group of 10 in front of us needed to be seated, and the Maitre d could not figure out how to make the party of 10 wait to the side while, not kidding, 6 groups of 2 waited behind them to be seated. We all stood there for 25 minutes plus while the ordeal was straightened out. In addition, the Maitre d gave a table up to another party, and blamed the guest in front of us for the mix up. Lovely.After giving our name we sat down, 5 minutes late, but with a decent table right by the window.  Our drinks were brought out promptly and our dinner options were placed with no hiccups. I ordered the beat salad and my husband ordered the sauteed gnocchi.  The salad was finely presented but lacked the gusto and flavor for the price tag. My husband said the gnocchi was dull and dry, as if pre-made in mass and distributed down the assembly line where it waited under a heat lamp to dry. For the main course, I ordered the Kabocha Pumpkin Ravioli and my husband, the NY Strip.  The Ravoli, again was OK but had the, now, all to familiar hint of mass produced cuisine subjected to a tan courtesy of another Manhattan heat lamp. My husband's steak was the NY Strip, and was presented well but covered in a sauce to mask the poor cut of meat. Additionally, as my husband later recanted, the Swiss chard that accompanied the Strip was wilted and lifeless as if water tortured under a boiling kettle.  Overall, the NY Strip and Ravoli were OK but not spectacular.  Dessert received the same review, well presented but not well received. The strange part of the dessert was the portion sizes, which were large, possibly to compensate the diner for the price, as if presented due to a chef's guilty conscience.The overall theme of our review would be that the food was well presented but over priced, and in the end, the diner will pay for the only view. If I perform a final top down analysis, you have a pre-fixed menu, anchored to a Marriott hotel in Time Square with a rotating venue. This creates a core concept that relies on location alone and will deliver little to the diner in terms of service or food quality. And with an end price tag (including drinks, tax, and tip) that exceeded $200, it would be safe to say that you could save your money, grab pizza and beer on any random Manhattan street, and walk to the top of the Empire State building for a fraction of the cost.",1,0,0,Cristina Q.,"Simi Valley, CA",92,11,8

1.0,11/20/2012,"Customer service gets you absolutely everywhere with me...especially when something goes awry. I am low maintenance almost to a fault. I'm also not one of those people who log onto Yelp simply to leave an unflattering review out of spite or general unhappiness (I've written many a complimentary review). I am simply writing this review in the hopes that the people who run the View Restaurant might learn something about how to treat customers. I will be writing subsequent letters to The Marriott (where the restaurant resides) and to Open Table (where I booked my reservation).Let me set the stage. It was my boyfriend's very first time to Manhattan - an important trip for both of us...as he was meeting my family for the first time. As a photographer, Manhattan was a place that he was excited to see and to photograph and booking a reservation in a restaurant with an incredible view was extremely important to both of us. Given that The View boasted the only rotating dining service in Manhattan I quickly booked the reservation A MONTH PRIOR to ensure we could get a seat by the window. The window, according to Yelp, was the best possible place to sit in order to get the best view.I used to work in the restaurant business (actually for Morton's of Chicago - a 5 star steakhouse that delivers the best customer service you'll find) --- so I am very familiar with restaurant protocol, and reservations made a month in advance provides MORE than enough time to ensure that a request can be honored.Our reservation was for 6:30. We arrived at 6:15. The hostess looked at my reservation and said, ""We don't have a table by a window,"" after reading my reservation request. CLEARLY she never read through the special requests on open table prior to the evening, so she could plan out the special requests accordingly (any high end restaurant will do this). I then respond, ""I made this reservation a month ago."" To which she responds (with zero empathy), ""It will be an hour wait for the window."" MIND YOU, we had arrived before the dinner rush --- the restaurant was NOT packed. Clearly they were honoring the later reservations that had requested window seats because when we WERE actually seated -- guess what??? Window seats WERE available. I also think they treated us poorly because we were younger - and all of the people that got the coveted window seats? Older, white, obviously wealthy people. I noticed this same prejudice by our waiter who also paid far more attention to the older clientele, basically rushing us out the door and taking no time to really -- offer any finesse to our service (but spending copious amounts of time catering to everyone else).I kept hoping throughout the dinner (at our table that was as far from the window as we could get) that someone would come by - the GM, anyone, and apologize for what had happened. An apology alone would have redeemed the mistake. But when no apology came as the waiter handed us the bill, I then hoped perhaps they took off a drink item, anything. Nope. The full bill was around $240-and every single item included. I was floored.In no way was I hoping for them to comp us a meal, or even to give us a discount, but an apology --- absolutely. It was the very least they could have done, especially given how I reiterated in the reservation that it would mean so much to have my boyfriend (whose first time it was in NY) a chance to see the city from the best possible view.Nada. My view on The View, is that they suck. Their food is average but their service - an absolute, total disgrace. My tip is this - go to the Empire State Building for the view and then book a reservation in a more affordable restaurant nearby, where you will likely STILL get better service.",17,0,0,J.

I used to live in NY and whenever I was in the theatre district, I used the bathrooms at the Marriott.  However, i'd never been up to the View restaurant. The prices are outrageous.  It's a one drink minimum, plus an $8 cover charge after 8pm. If you want the buffet, it's another $37.  We went up just to have a drink.  We got there around 6pm so the sun was setting and it was really pretty.  It takes about an hour to spin fully around the top so by the time we got all the way around, it was dark out and the city was all lit up.  It was pretty cool. Drinks prices are also ridiculous.  I had a glass of wine, my boyfriend had a long island.  With tip and everything, it was about $40 total.  The service was fine.  Our waitress was really friendly and she came back to check on us several times.  The place started to get crowded around 7pm. So, you really do just go for the view.  I'm sure there are better places to get better views but we were in Midtown and it was my bf's first trip to NY.  It was worth it :)",2,1,0,Jamie A.,"Hamilton, OH",22,156,23

Honestly, the food was all good -- but nothing spectacular, and definitely not worth the original price of ~$70/80, maybe more ~$40/50. The Potato Gnocchi was a table favorite, but nothing phenomenal. My favorite was the steak -- medium rare -- so tender and delicious. Definitely made the meal worthwhile for me. The dessert was also okay like the soup. Nothing too great though the presentation was beautiful. The cherry flavor was made quite well, not too overwhelming.Normally, if one out of the three dishes impressed me and a fancy ass place like this, I'd give it three stars. But the view bumps it to four. We got a window table and ate from 7-9ish, which means we saw the city change from light to dark and the amazing sunset over the NYC skyline.

3.0,8/5/2012,"Decided to try this place for NY Restaurant Week, more for the novelty of it rather than the food choices they had.The food has its ups and downs, as certain dishes like the potato gnocchi with pulled short ribs and the skirt steak were a little too salty for me, but the daily market catch my friend had was terribly bland. However, I still enjoyed my dishes and the dessert (cheesecake). Service was alright, but not really what I expected for a place that charges that much for food. Being in a tourist area, they like to push their pricier food options onto people, even though I mentioned that we were there for the restaurant week menu. The waiter serving the table next to us was a loud man who talked like a car salesman, so he was quite memorable for me (and not in a good way).Take advantage of the restaurant week prices if you're interested in visiting a rotating restaurant, otherwise I don't feel like it's worth the prices for the food they serve.",2,1,0,Christine L.,"Newport News, VA",25,6,1

1.0,7/4/2012,"I had to write this review immediately because I am still upset over my experience at The View Restaurant & Lounge last night. I should call it my almost experience, because we didn't get to eat. Having traveled to New York for a few days, and having reserved to dine at The View about three weeks prior to arriving, we were excited to finish off a nice evening of Broadway at this restaurant. They gave us reservations at 9:30 pm. We went to see Wicked, and the show ended at about 9:45 pm. Once the curtain went down, we practically jogged through Broadway to get to the Marriott Marquis, which is where The View is located, and on the treck there attempted to call them on the phone to no avail. Dining out very frequently (I write restaurant reviews on my blog: adventuresofthefoodaholi…), we always like to notify a restaurant if we are running late. When we arrived to the hostess on the first floor (you have to check in with her and then she will walk you over to the elevator which will take you to the 48th floor), we told her we had reservations for 9:30, but were running about 20 mins late because of the show. Her name was Renee, and she called up to the restaurant, spoke to someone by the name of Bryan, who told her to let us go up. I thought it was funny how she insisted if he was sure, even telling him ""All-right, but I will not be to blame for this"". She walked us over to the elevator and told us if we had any problems, to let them know she had confirmed with the restaurant and we could go up. So complicated but OK. When we got out of the elevator (48 stories up), we proceeded to the woman immediately outside the elevator.  I'll pause here by saying she was not welcoming at all and rather  rude when I told her we had been sent up to dine and had reservations. Her name was Sandra Berger and her name tag read View Manager. She told us she was sorry but the restaurant was closed. We tried to explain for about 10 minutes how the hostess at the bottom had called up and they had told her we could come in. Still rude, and making us feel as if we were lying, she called someone on the phone, who told her they had no clue what we were talking about. Getting upset, and feeling hungry, we asked her if she could please call the hostess on the ground floor to confirm what we were saying. She refused, said she was sorry, and offered to buy us drinks at the bar. We weren't thirsty we were hungry and had been at this ridiculous episode for 15 minutes now. I asked her to see the manager, and she told me that she was the manager. I asked her if there was anyone else I could speak to because I couldn't understand how this was happening when we were just told to come up. She called another man over, his name was Roberto Hernandez (I guess yet another manager) and he said the kitchen was closed (mind you there were people still eating at the restaurant) and basically closed the topic there. He apologized for the lack of communication, refused to contact his employee who sent us up, and sent us on our merry, (and again, hungry) way. Back in the elevator and going down 48 floors  (now 30 minutes later) we saw the hostess at the ground floor. She asked us what happened and when we told her, she said she couldn't believe it because she had confirmed we could go up...yade yade yade. Moral of the story: Be very cautious with eating at The View.  They have horrible customer service skills and really care nothing about their patrons or the impression they will make. Regardless of being called ""The City That Never Sleeps"", New York actually does - knd of early on the weekdays, regardless of whether there are Broadway shows running or not. If a restaurant pulls something like The View did, you might just have to grab a slice of pizza on the way to your hotel or a meal at McDonalds, because everything else will be closed. We were lucky enough to visit other great establishments during our visit, and I encourage you to visit my page, where I will be writing about my culinary experiences in the Big Apple. (minus the horrible adventure at The View).",4,2,0,Maria S.,"Miami, FL",2,16,0
5.0,6/30/2012,"I thoroughly enjoyed my first experience at The View. It was a Friday night around 11:45pm. The whole presentation was phenomenal. The ride up the glass elevator was exhilarating, as was the ride back down. The maître d' was very polite and welcoming. We were seated right away, at a table for two along the window. The ambiance was dim lighting with candles on the tables. Very relaxing. The buffet smelled delicious, but I did not eat so I can not comment on the food. Our waitress was absolutely lovely and very accommodating. The martini I ordered was the Summer Peach. It was delicious. Not too sweet, perfectly balanced, and packed some serious punch. I only needed one. Even the peach slice in it was perfectly ripe. My friend ordered the Milk Chocolate. It, too, was delectable and strong, served with a large, plump, perfectly ripe strawberry. Even their cocktail napkins are impressive. It maps out the view you see as you slowly rotate. It took me a few minutes to realize we were in fact moving. We did not make it a full rotation but I definitely will return to experience all of the breathtaking sights. There is an $8 cover charge added on to your bill if you are not a guest of the hotel and the martini was $16. We left a nice tip so for each of us it was $34. I do wish they had tapas to order, that would have been a lovely addition. For me, the experience was worth the money for the one martini.

My wife really wanted to go for the view from this 48th floor rotating bar on in the Marriott Marquis and she was not disappointed by the view on Manhatten; however, nothing else was impressive. We each had one drink - we might have had more but the service was so bad my beer sat empty for nearly a half hour and our waiter (Bradley) never came around to ask if I wanted another one. In fact, my son actually had to go find the manager so we could get Bradley to bring us our check. We were there an hour+ and only managed one round of drinks for a $95 tab...yes the drinks our over priced (even for NYC) and there is a $7.45/person cover charge. Add in that the drinks are not very good - my son's Prickly Pear Margarita was barely drinkable at $16 and my wife's Mojito was average at best at $15;  I only got a Brookly n Brewery Lager in the bottle (that is they did not even provide a beer glass for $7.50.

Service?  Well it's ok, but not the kind of service that I would affix to that kind of price tag.

The appetizers were good and there the enjoyment ended. For the breakfast options, there was a constant line of 5-7 people for the only omelette station so I skipped that. I had the eggs benedict, which were dreadful. They were in a warmer, which meant the outside of the muffin was dried out and the middle was disgustingly soggy. The hollandaise sauce that was dried on top was tasteless. The bacon was tasty but chewy - looked like beggin strips. lol. The chicken and apple sausage was too sweet. Homefries were terrible. I didn't have the waffles or french toast. Coffee was awful.The lunch options were uninspired. The carved beef (station) was tasty and nicely roasted). There was no white-meat chicken option - just thighs. I didn't eat the salmon as it looked dry. Salad options were fine. Also good selection of cheeses.The dessert area had a chocolate fountain and rows of desserts that just looked mass-produced. The bread pudding was dry towards the outside of the heating pan and wet in the middle. There was a ganache wafer dessert that was tasty.Having said all that, the service was pleasant (Reeta?).

4.0,2/15/2012,"This place is so cool!I like the novelty of the rotating bar. It's expensive, but there's a buffet, complete with a chocolate fountain.I actually prefer the view from the bar several floors down in the same hotel, because it's right on eye level of all the flashing lights and billboards of Times Square and you can watch cars and people mulling around. But, of course, that one doesn't rotate!This is more of an aerial view. You can see far into the distance and, haha, into the top floors of the surrounding hotels and buildings.The full rotation takes an hour. I have to admit, I don't get motion sickness, but for some reason, when I sat down here, I felt a little unsettled as the place was rotating. It took me a good 25-30 minutes to get over the sensation. While it doesn't rotate quickly, it turns quickly enough that you can see that you're moving. The center of the room stays still.I wasn't drinking and I'm not sure I'd want to here. The bathroom is down a flight of stairs and tucked into a hallway of another restaurant. So, between literally having the spins without drinking, trying to find the bathroom and then determining where your table has gone when you come back upstairs, whoa. I felt drunk while sober!Service was very friendly, lighting was dim, the napkins have a map on them so you can determine what you're looking at as you're rotating.Really cool place and a very fun experience! It's a great date spot, because they won't rush you out. Even if you come in for coffee (which is what I did), the staff is very polite and lets you sit. I guess they expect everyone to want to do the whole loop. Also, I suppose there's the added benefit that after that hour long loop is done if your date isn't going so well,  you have an excuse to leave. Heehee. ;)",4,1,2,S V.,"New York, NY",39,288,34

4.0,2/8/2012,"Hmm so first off, spent $320 for a dinner for two.To be called ""The View,"" it certainly doesn't live up to its name.  Yes, it rotates and catches you off guard when you suddenly decide to look out and it feels like you're somewhere else, BUT the view just isn't that great.  It was so dark outside, can't see much with the exception of this one office building that still had all the lights lit.  I think it may be better to go during a summer night because it'll be brighter out and you can maybe catch a glimpse of the river even.The wait here is also so long. Wait to be seated, wait forever for drinks, wait some more for the menu, wait even longer to order, and wait to have the food come out.BUT when the food comes out, its so worth it.  The gnocchi was good!! and their chilled shrimp is different from your regular shrimp cocktail. They serve two large shrimps that are very fresh and CRUNCHY when you chew on it. If you also order your steak medium rare, it comes medium rare!, unlike other places that tend to overcook the steaks.  The mashed potatoes that come with the steak is sooo smooth! Its so finely mashed that it doesnt feel grainy on your tongue.  and OMG their salmon!.... their salmon just melts in your mouth! I absolutely LOVED the salmon! If I were to go back, it would be for the salmon.So to sum it all up, pricey? yes! looonnnng wait? yes! view? not the best. Decor? nice. Food? yummmm!",3,0,0,Dora L.,"New York, NY",68,5,2
3.0,2/5/2012,"FYI: This is on the 48th floor inside the Marriott Hotel in Times SquareI went here as part of restaurant week, being the smart foodie that I am why not pay $35 for a meal that would originally cost you $80?Yes, you read that correctly $80. On any average night, The View Restaurant has a prixe fixe menu of $80 per person. This includes an appetizer, an entree and a dessert. No bells and whistles for that price. My recommendation, go during restaurant week and MAKE A RESERVATION.The view as you can expect is absolutely stunning. You are revolving as you are eating and by the end of your meal complete a full rotation and view all of New York City. The food on the other hand isn't as excellent. As an appetizer I had gnocchi in a cream sauce with ham. As an entree I had the catch of the day which was a flaky fish, similar to halibut with white beans. For dessert I had a red velvet chocolate bar topped with what tasted like coffee ice cream. The best part of my meal: dessert and wine.

5.0,12/22/2011,"To start this review off I'd like to point out Location-Location-Location. The View Restaurant & Lounge is Located on 48th Floor of the Marriott Marquis in Time Square. The theme behind The View is an Elegant Dinning experience with an added twist. The restaurant uses an extremely slow Rotating Floor  spinning 360 degrees to give you a spectacular view of the NYC Skyline. (Empire State Building, Bridges, Time Square) although window seats can be limited. We were greeted by server Louis who went above and beyond as our waiter. Drinks never going dry, questions about the menu were answered by server not by constantly checking w/ a manager or the chef. Very polite and Courteous catering to every need. Onto food, Appetizer on the PreFix Menu ($80 per). The Duck Salad was tender, not gamey with excellent flavors. The Chilled shrimp only comes with two shrimp but they are the largest shrimp ever seen. They are served over a bed of arugula(see photo posted). Entrees The Scallops with risotto and broccolini were amazing great size on scallops seared perfectly with great flavor. The 12 oz Ribeye Steak was juicy marinated to perfection. ""as always said if a steak needs A1 or any other sauce added after cooked it's not a good steak"". This steak was Grade A+Finally to top of the night the Trio Molten Dessert if there's anything you want to try it is this creation on the menu. The out of this world combinations of Banana Ice Cream Gram Cracker and Molten Fudge Hot Cake, Peanut crushed With chocolate bar and raspberry glaze make this dish to die for.

I coolly stated to the waitress what my intentions were why I asked if water was on the menu.Post it, enjoyed the night life staring outside, while we finished dinner.  Dessert is not part of dinner!  $18 extra for cheese and desserts.  I watched entertained as I understood why most the other patrons came in only for drinks, no buffet.All in all I would do it again~I loved the company and ""the view""!",2,0,0,Erin K.,"Brooklyn, NY",259,50,21

I was blown away by how creative that was whoever who came up with the whole spinning thing.It's better if you make reservation before coming here, because people have to wait in long line since it's a popular place and everyone from the hotel goes there too!

It was simply amazing. Besides the food being spectacular. The price is also a hefty one. So it might not be the best for a first date.

2.0,7/19/2011,"Looked up reviews before coming here for RW2011 dinner. Should've listened to the not-so-stellar reviews but all the hotspots for RW that I had wanted to try were booked up. My friend recommended this place & since I've seen it in the Times Sq Marriott a couple of times, I decided to give it a try. Location is great & touristy, right in the heart of Times Sq & theater district so there's plenty to do & see if you're early for your reservation or if you need to walk off that bloated feeling afterwards. Some things to know:1) The ""smart casual"" dress code isn't strict, I saw patrons in shorts & tshirts2) Although I had read about a drink minimum on Yelp, we didnt have any (maybe cause of RW?)3) The view was disappointing. Maybe better at night,in-restaurant ambiance was lacking as well. For a restaurant that is named THE VIEW, it definitely did not live up to the hype. However, some folks who aren't as picky with their eating environment might not care. It doesn't have that overly pretentious or intimidating feel that some other establishments may have so that could be a plus for some.4) Food was forgettable, could def find a better meal for RW. Now about my PERSONAL EXPERIENCE:SERVICE: Average. The waiter was nice but not exceptionally attentive or gracious. Our orders did not take long. He was courteous without any nose-in-the-air snobbery.CROWD: We went for dinner at 6:30 on a Tuesday. Many tables were empty. It seemed that many of the patrons were hotel guests, a few had children and infants with them.AMBIANCE: As I mentioned before, lacking (in my opinion, but I'm a sucker for atmosphere)FOOD: I had the Potato Gnocchi/Duck Confit for appetizer. Not a super fan of gnocchi, pieces of duck were small and scarce....ehhh...For my entree, I had the Market Fish of the Day which was a Mahi Mahi. Usually I don't order fish so I'm not quite sure how good FISH should taste exactly. But the Mahi Mahi's flavors were underwhelming... The only flavor I could taste were the capers. Only the edges of the fish were flavorful (and by that, I mean salty). I guess this wasn't a good choice for someone who likes bold flavors. (which is why I don't usually get fish).Lastly, I got the Vanilla Creme Brulee and Pear Macaron for dessert. I love creme brulee so I enjoyed that. I also LOOOOOVE macarons, so I was pretty excited for the dessert (CREME BRULEE & MACARONS?! happy dance time!) Unfortunately, the pear macaron was gross. To be fair, I don't usually get fruity macarons (I love green tea and pistachio ones)...but are macarons supposed to taste like BUBBLE GUM?!? Honestly, it tasted like pear and bubble gum. Like the pink bubble gum flavored bubble gum. And I HATE that flavor. Seriously, one of my biggest turn-offs is the smell of pink bubble gum. And here I had nonchalantly bitten off a generous amount of bubble gum parading around pretending to be a pear macaron.... sigh, all I could do was make a face and leave the rest.",2,0,0,Sophia C.,"New York, NY",265,59,24
4.0,7/13/2011,"As a resident NY'er, I've been hesitant to go here whenever friends/family have suggested it. I've always had the impression of it being an crowded, overpriced tourist trap with no real appeal, thinking the view is one I've seen my entire life so what's the point of paying to see it as the room spins?I was wrong. This place is pretty awesome. The elevator ride is a cheap thrill as we zoomed past 40+ floors (was that a Kinect lounge I saw!? MUST SNEAK IN). Every staff member we met was friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be working there. I figured the food would be pretty run-of-the-mill hotel slop, but my low expectations of the food were thankfully surpassed. My salad was full of tasty, tender baby veggies. My steak was perfect perfect perfect (the potatoes on the side were SUPER salty and soggy, though). Dessert was obscenely good - there is some white chocolate MAGIC that they bring on a platter with creme brulee covered in popcorn and vanilla ice cream... I don't know what that white chocolate thing was but HOT DAMN it was good. The creme brulee was pretty tasty too, and who doesn't like popcorn sprinkled on desserts?! We also got the chocolate desserts (I'm not a big fan of chocolate so I'll pass on reviewing these) and a cheesecake with strawberry sticks on them which was tangy & fantastic.Yes, it's pricey and of COURSE you can get a better meal for less elsewhere. People - you're on top of a building in a 2 floor restaurant that SPINS AROUND in the middle of NYC. You're paying for that, so unless you have an appreciate for the mechanics involved and the incredible view, don't bother (and if you don't and you still go, please don't leave negative reviews - didn't you know what you were getting into when you went!? also: triple negative.

Not too impressed.  The server was very nice and accommodating.  Really tried to sell up but still was nice when we didn't. The lounge is a lot more relaxed and offers the same views.  If you enter the lounge before 8.00pm there is no cover charge.  The dinner buffet is $35 a person and is pretty decent though not outstanding. In general: good food, nice view, a bit pricey for most.  You could probably find a better value (food wise or experience wise).  And if you're considering proposing - I was not feeling the romantic vibe a whole lot (just for the record).",4,1,0,Helen S.,"Gilbert, AZ",20,66,76

Therefore Hubby and I have no place in a restaurant with prices like the View, yes? Wrong.It was a little confusing figuring out how to get up there, but once we got to the 2nd floor it got better. Until we got to the coat check. The woman demanded to know, in very broken english, how long we would be because she wanted to go home early.  Seriously? Our bill was $208 at the end of the night, that freaking lady is going to wait until we're ready to get our coats! Needless to say, as we were leaving at 730 a huge group came in with all of their coats. I laughed inside.Once we were on the 48th floor, they informed us that if we were not eating at the buffet, we had to go down a floor... So went went down a floor and got seated. The hostesses were very nice.  Frank came over after we got seated. I had a warm buzz from cocktails at our hotel and since we were walking a lot and going to a show, I didn't want to get tipsy, so I ordered ice water. Hubby got a coke.  He did not show us a wine menu as he did the table behind us. He opens the menu and quickly says, ""Pick an appetizer, entree, and dessert"" and then bluntly says, ""So a coke and a tap water"" and walks away.  Sorry??  My freaking tap water was $5, as DH kindly pointed out after we left. Our actual waiter then came over. He didn't introduce himself and actually thought he was the manager because he was much nicer. Although we didn't get he was our waiter until he took our order, I greatly appreciated dealing with him for the rest of the night.  I ordered braised duck salad for an app. I've never had duck before so I can't compare, but I really enjoyed it. I got a 12 oz ny strip for an entree, and chocolate mousse for a dessert.  The steak was absolutely meh. but the au gratin potatoes were amazing.  The dessert was absolutely delicious. when our waiter found out it was our anniversary, he brought us champagne, but the tune changed when he discovered we didn't intend on buying shots and tequila.  Sorry... but... I can't justify paying that much for alcohol and we were already running short on time.  The actual view was quite nice. I'd rather have seen it at sunset, because at night you just see bunch of ads and lights, but it was still neat. I especially enjoyed when we were facing some condos and I literally watched people in their apartments for 20 minutes. I like to people watch so I was highly entertained. I also actually witnessed a man stripping down to his underwear in his hotel room ato ne point. I felt like such a child sitting there giggling and pointing to my husband.   Oh well. haha  I dont get how people got motion sickness in here... It moved SO SLOWLY I didn't realize we were moving most of the time... If you are the type of person to get dizzy on the walk over, don't go!We waited quite a bit between our entree and dessert and then quite a while for the bill. If you go, allow for more time than 90 minutes.I don't think i'll return on future trips to NYC, but i will remember my visit fondly on the most part. :-D",0,1,1,Heidi K.,"Columbus, OH",115,231,71

But nothing was outstanding or memorable.And perhaps it's a gay thing, but if the bill will be $60 per person at the end of the meal (before tax and tip), I'm expecting at least one complimentary alcoholic beverage with my brunch.

2.0,11/23/2010,"We decided to go here after a Broadway show for the dessert and cheese buffet and cocktails.  First of all, getting to the View Lounge itself can be a little confusing.  You have to get an escalator to the first floor before getting an express lift to the View Lounge - easy when you know how, but with so many people milling around waiting for lifts and obscuring the signs that tell you this, we had no idea where we were supposed to go at first.  Once we finally got there all was well - we asked for a table by the window and they kindly obliged.  Our waiter was very friendly, giving us advice on how to find our way back to the table from the buffet, what we could see from our current point in the revolution, etc.  The view on the night we went was not spectacular, but then it was raining and foggy, which obscured most of the tall buildings - I imagine that by day or on a clear night it would be lovely.  The décor of the Lounge itself was nice - it was a little bigger than I had anticipated which was good as there was plenty of room for everyone to sit near a window.  The buffet itself was pretty good.  There was a decent variety to choose from, with three different cheeses, two types of cracker, pretzel sticks, a lot of different types of cakes and desserts, fruit, marshmallows and a chocolate fountain.  We ate a lot of strawberries!  Everything was nice but inevitably you can only eat so much rich food.  The cocktails were amazing - I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea and the waiter warned me it was kind of strong.  Happily he wasn't wrong and only two of them gave me a nice little buzz!  The only complaint I would have is that it's quite expensive.  We knew in advance that there was a $8 per person cover charge so that didn't bother us, and we knew how much the buffets and drinks would cost from the website, but complete with service charge it all adds up to more than you'd thought somehow.  Also be warned (and to be fair I think they do mention it somewhere on their menu) if you're using a debit card or a pre-paid credit card like us that they will put an hold on some money on your card that, in our case at least, still has not been released a full week after our visit, even though the charge for the total amount for the bill has been finalised for a few days.  I wouldn't necessarily mind if it was only a small amount but in our case it's around $49 that we have on our card but can't spend, so I'm not very happy about that.  Still, all in all, it was an expensive but good experience.  The revolving aspect put a bit of a unique spin on the experience (no pun intended) and it was great fun - it didn't make either of us nauseous at all, as others have complained about.  Definitely a one-off though - we're glad we went but we wouldn't go back.  If you're thinking of going I would recommend ensuring that it's a clear day/evening, be finished by 8pm when the cover charge kicks in and use a credit card to pay if you can.",0,0,0,Nikki C.,"Belfast, United Kingdom",0,20,0

Other people that walked in.... not so much. There's something about spinning in circles while eating that makes people nauseous... can you believe it? The first issue is that you are not moving all that slowly. The second issue is that the middle of the restaurant doesn't move so it's very clear that you're spinning, which makes people uneasy.The food and drinks were excellent. The service was awkward. Our waiter tried to make conversation and started talking about 9/11, pilots crashing planes aaaaaaand... war. First, we're atop the city in this little restaurant, let's not bring up people crashing into towers. Second, we're here to eat and be merry. There are appropriate times to be a downer, and this wasn't the time to talk about any of these things.Overall, between the lack of thought put into building the restaurant, and our waiter, Captain Doom & Gloo , the only thing that was good was the food and the view, and we honestly could have found food just as good for the same price, anywhere else in NYC.It's a nice experience, as long as you don't get sick.

1.0,7/12/2010,"I came thirsty, expecting to pay 20$ for an only OK drink and be annoyed by the Times Square shenanigans, but impressed by the spinning restaurant and spectacular Manhattan views. How foolish of me. First of all, spinning restaurants are not cool, they are nauseating. Second of all, depending on where you are in the spin cycle, you have a wonderful view of the back of a billboard, or the side of the ""W"" from the hotel next door. Like tons of other folks have mentioned there is an 8$ viewing charge for these 'spectacular views' (the nausea is free though!). The food is....expensive...and not very good. I had only the dessert and cheese buffet. For 17.95USD, I expect something a bit classier than cubes of mild cheddar and a forlorn wheel of brie (the cheese stands alone, friends). The cream cheese frosting on the carrot cake was either a. diet or b. not made of cream cheese. Either way- ick. And, personal pet peeve. Buffet food needs labeling. period. Don't put a bunch of ambiguous cakes, cookies and parfait cups and what not out and not tell people what everything is. If you need to use the restroom, be prepared. It is plain at best, maybe a step up from a highway stop restroom at worst. Not quite the experience I anticipated to go with my 16USD drink, 8USD viewing charge, and 17.95USD dessert and cheese buffet. The icing on my overpriced cake was when the bill arrived, our waiter struggled to run the three credit cards that we handed him. He actually requested that one of my friends accompany him to help him remember which card was which and how much should be charged. And it took 30 minutes for him to do it. Thanks anyway, View.

2.0,6/20/2010,"The View is definitely a great tourist attraction of NYC.  Since I am from NYC, it doesn't really amaze me much.  My family ate here last night to celebrate father's day because its a place he's always wanted to go try.  We had the buffet in the lounge so this review goes for that only.  The Lounge is on the 48th floor. You walk into the lobby of the hotel and go up the set of escalators and then through a hostess where she directs you to elevator bank F or G to take to the 48th floor.  You then get off and either make a left or right depending on if you made reservations or if you just wanted Buffet style.   The scenic view was not breathtaking at all because all you saw were tall buildings in the way. You can def get a glimpse of the Empire State Building too but nothing else was that special.  The elevator was the most exhilarating part of the night because it shot you up from the third floor to the 48th floor and when you came back down, it almost felt like a freefall.  The lounge was so dark you can barely see what you were eating, something that i absolutely hated.  It's nice to be in a candlelit setting an all but this place was honestly just way too dark. If you come in groups larger than 2, you would not be sitting near the windows because those tables are solely for pairs.  My family of 8 sat uncomfortably in square tables put together but we would have much preferred a round table or something more comfortable.So the dinner buffet was lacking a LOT of choices. The only seafood they have is small scallops in a cold salad which were decent, large shrimps in another cold salad which were the best thing all night.  Then the only meat they had was the short ribs, which were decent but lacked some taste.  The lemon chicken was okay too.  It was not what you'd go back for.  They had a create your own pasta type thing going on. There were lots of veggies.  I would say in total the entree/dinner buffet consisted of 10 selections? I wasn't too happy with that.  Next, the dessert buffet consisted of a small selection as well. The chocolate fondue was the best by far, with the ability to dip strawberries or marshmallows.  The cakes and cookies tasted stale, and it wasn't to my liking.  I think the only cake that was decent was the cheesecake. There were some cheeses, but I'm not a cheese person so that didn't appeal to me.We got to the lounge after 8pm so there is an automatic $8 cover charge which brings the base buffet price from $33----to  $41/person.  Then in addition, there is a 1 drink minimum per person so we all just had pepsi ($6).  The meal for 8 of us, and drinks + tips/tax came out to $480.  Honestly if you're a tourist and you don't mind the price tag, then $480 isn't bad i assume.  But my family just wanted to show my dad the view of The View so that's why we opted for the buffet option.  We didn't care for the fine dining but even the buffet was subpar.  We could have had a much more fulfilling and satisfactory meal downtown, but it was an experience nonetheless.",2,0,0,Sasha C.,"New York, NY",6,939,497

1.0,4/30/2010,"Almost every major American city has a restaurant like this - one that rotates with excellent panaramic views of the city.  New York's version is literally atop the Marriot Hotel in Times Square and like most Times Square businesses, it's touristy and ridiculously expensive.The views are interesting, though I wouldn't say mind blowing.  At night the buildings are well lit and it becomes harder to see the surrounding areas of Manhattan without a skyscraper in your face.  I imagine during the day time it's a much easier sell though this place does its best business during dinner.Given the Marriot is no budget motel, the restuarant exudes a certain sense of elegant quality in almost everything in the restaurant.  The service is articulate and well spoken, bathrooms are immaculate, the table setting is nice, and the food is all about the presentation.That might be part of the problem.  Food looked great and tasted about as bland as can be.  My NY steak would've tasted better in a George Foreman Grill, but my waiter wasn't buying it.  After adjusting my steak and bringing me a new plate, I realized there just wasn't enough juice / flavor to save the life of my dish.  I ended up making dinner out of trying everyone else's at the table.  Everything was essentially of New American cuisine, with the big winner being their Seared Foie Gras, which is just an appetizer.  Everyone else's main course from the Filet Mignon, Roasted Bass, Duck Breast, Shrimp Pasta were all complete and utter failures in the haute cuisine world.The price is what put us over the edge.  I was somehow very generous in taking my guests out and footed the entire bill.  I think may have put in the equivalent of a mortgage payment or a couple of Apple Powerbooks, but it was enough for me to determine this place is essentially NWI, or Not Worth It.",15,6,10,Jando S.,"Queens, NY",2723,3529,17072

Needless to say I wasn't asked I was TOLD when we come to NYC over April vaca were going here. Sadly this place only rocks in nostalgia because after the trip we took I'm good. It seems that there's an $8 cover after 8pm which is reasonable for those who show up after the alotted time but if you kick it beforehand and want to stay through 8pm you'll be paying the cover as well. I say you and not we because my gf bounced at 8:15 so we didn't have to bother. The sights to behold were gorgeous but the drinks sucked. The long island my lady got was of applbees quality and I just need to come to terms with all bars in NYC just can't make a SoCo sour. Expect a cocktail glass and filler up with sours mix. The waitress let us know of what was going on and we were good. I liked looking out on Times sq but not enough for an extra $16 plus crappy drinks. I did however instruct my gf (who was paying for drinks only because I bought dinner so let's not get any ideas here lol) that even though she had exact change for the bill so have the waitress break some 20's so we could sit a few more moments.

Had I been aware of this we would have gotten there earlier. It used to be as long as you got there before the cover charge time...you were all set.* They have changed the drink menu; the Hampton Iced Tea is now just a Long Island Iced Tea served in a plain Tom Collins style glass and very weak. All the drinks used to come in fancy Hurricane signature glasses...and one Hampton Iced Tea used to give you a warm buzz.Our waitress was nice-ish, and told us it was not a new policy...it was just being strictly enforced. I expressed my disappointment to her and she said she could offer us to stay without the cover until 8:30PM. Mind you we didn't arrive until 7:45PM as I was not expecting any changes. I then asked her that if we decided to have the dessert buffet at $17.95 each, could we have the cover charge waived. She was unwilling to budge so we cashed out after our drinks and spent our money elsewhere. So if you are going to The View, get there way before 8:00PM...and leave by 8:00PM...also order a cheap drink and just enjoy the great view of the city that you do get!

1.0,4/23/2010,"The hubby and I went here a few nights ago to celebrate our 2nd anniversary.  It was, after all, the restaurant at which we ate the night he proposed.  Ahhh, the memories of that lovely night, dining at that lovely, upscale, wonderful restaurant.  Well, the marriage is better than ever.  The restaurant?  It didn't fare so well.  In fact, it didn't fare at all this time around.  What was once a casually upscale, dress as if you're going to a nice dinner place, has now become a tank top and jean wearing overpriced equivalent of Applebee's.  We arrived with a reservation and waited 30 minutes to be seated at a table away from the window, after our reservation specifically stated we would be seated at one.  The attitude-toting hostess corrected that mistake after another 10 minutes of waiting.  BTW, she explained her attitude wasn't with us- she just couldn't stand her co-workers.  We sit and wait another 20 minutes before a waiter comes to our table.  He presents us with the menu then disappears.  He reappears 10 minutes later to take our drink order.  We ask for glasses of water and my husband orders their ""signature"" alcoholic beverage.  We wait another 30 minutes: no waiter, no water, no drink, no bread. But we do have a small plate of melting butter on the table.  After sitting for 35 minutes, during which my husband has already found another restaurant on his iPhone, the waiter comes over with the drink and waters- but still no bread.  My husband politely explains that I am not feeling well (being 6 months pregnant and waiting over an hour for a piece of bread and water will have its effects) and we have opted to leave.  The only nice part about this visit is that the waiter tells him the drink is on the house and he hopes we have a nice evening.  My husband quickly finishes off his watered-down, $20 ""signature"" drink and we head out.  On the elevator ride down we are surrounded by French-speaking, tank top and jean wearing folk who apparently had the meal of a lifetime at New York's finest restaurant (rolling eyes now).  To finish off this long, but brutally honest review, we ended up celebrating our anniversary at Ruth's Chris.  Within moments of being seated we were poured two glasses of ice cold water,  the service was impeccable, the food splendid, and we received a delectable, complimentary dessert at the end of our meal.",2,0,0,C.

4.0,3/12/2010,"As a native New Yorker, I had no idea this place existed.  Actually I had no idea that NY had a revolving restaurant of any kind.  The only other time I had been to one was at the Stratosphere in Las Vegas.My friend was in town for business and was staying at the Marriott Marquis so we decided to check out The View on the 48th Floor of the hotel (the elevators are high tech -- type in the floor number on the keypad and then you'll be directed to an elevator).  It was pretty empty at 5:30pm on a Thursday but filled up pretty quickly.  We sat right up against the window, which was nice although as others have mentioned the view isn't spectacular -- you are going to be looking at a lot of commercial buildings since you are looking from the skyline outwards.  We learned from the waitress that it took 56 minutes for a full revolution so we stayed exactly that long.  The revolution thankfully wasn't too fast but fast enough that when we were on our way out, we still felt like we were moving, kind of like after you get off of a boat.   Service was good, our waitress was attentive and informative.Generally when you buy a ridiculously expensive cocktail, they aren't that strong but the martinis we got were great.  My friend got the champagne martini and I got something called the French (very fruity like fruit punch).  They were both tasty and definitely helped us start off our night.  We were told about the buffett but did not partake.  $33 gets you the dinner buffet or $18 gets you just cheese apps & desserts.  There is a chocolate fountain in the dessert section that looked irresistible.  We were hoping to revolve past that quick enough so as not to be tempted to dig in.Although it was a very touristy thing to do, I had a good experience.  I can see people coming here to celebrate a big night out and the buffett option seems like the best way to go.",0,0,0,Reshma B.,"New York, NY",122,312,6

Lots of anniversary celebrations I'm sure.. Don't bring a first date here, because it looks like you're trying too hard though...It's gimmicky and overpriced, but how can you really resist the amazing views. Smaller parties and couples tend to sit against the windows, while larger booths are towards the center of the revolving disc. The staff is very friendly, especially the overweight man, and is great at answering questions and customizing cocktail orders. There's a buffet with chocolate fountain and lots of cakes/desserts. If you don't order the buffet, it's fairly easy to sneak a couple of pieces of small cake-bites while walking............ or so i hear...Come here fairly dressed up: no t-shirts and slippers at night. Also, be prepared to wait a little bit, although not too long, as the line moves quickly. Summary: overpriced, but with great views.

2.0,10/22/2009,"What's the point of indulging in a spinning restaurant when, even if the place were standing still, the bill would have the same effect on your head? For all those complaining about forking up over a hundred bucks for a few rounds of drinks in the Lounge, take heart - I ate at the Restaurant with my parents and the check  was over five hundred. Of course there are plenty of places in New York City where one can part with five hundred clams covering a meal for four people - but most of them are also exceptional culinary experiences. This place offers a limited-selection menu, and the food is about what you'd expect at any cookie cutter, overpriced Theater District joint where you'd still spend only half what you do here.The point, of course, is that this place rotates. But so does my mother, at just under ninety pounds and after she's had a strong Rob Roy and failed to make it through her plate of just adequately done lamb shanks. The only reason we went to this place was for the ""experience"" .. and the fact that they were staying at the hotel. That said, the fixed-position view from their room on the 42nd floor of the Marriott was equally impressive, and for what we paid they could have stayed an extra night. We ordered pizza in the room the next night, drank a bottle of wine, and enjoyed looking out the window .. you live and you learn. (Just a side note - having a particularly generous pair of parents, this $500 meal cost me nothing, and as Dad pointed out  ""the government is just going to take it all when we're gone, anyway..""  Still, do yourselves a favor and put that money to better use at a cash joint in Brooklyn.

You could quickly steal chocolate fondue, and then before the servers notice, move to a different table and avoid the charge.

While there, I suggested we go up to the rotating bar on the top of the Marriott for a drink and some amazing views of the city. The ride in the glass elevators that take you up to the 48th floor are always a big hit with out of towners as well as the view from The View. We were seated along the wall of windows and was not told about the ridiculous $7.00 per person cover charge until the waitress was there to take our orders. Of course, when they do it that way, you're less likely to refuse to pay it and go somewhere else, so I think it's really bad business protocol for them not to be upfront with you about it when you first enter and ask for a table. I could not believe how overpriced the drinks were. It has been a good 3+ years since I have been there and did not expect to see $18.95 mixed drinks! TOTAL TOURIST TRAP. This place is really screwing the tourists over with bad service and outrageous prices. All that being said, we bit the bullet, ordered drinks and had a nice time talking while enjoying the rotating view.

It wasnt bad...dont take it the wrong way, i just am not into the trough style dining.  I like an experience.  It was still $200 for 2 so you really arent saving much like you may think at a casino buffet in Vegas or Reno.Anyway, worth a look, if only for The View.",0,0,0,Bryan L.,"Reno, NV",47,54,19

I had the pumpkin ravioli, roasted bass, and creme brulee. The dessert was the best part of the meal, then the appetizer, and the entree was my least favorite. The service was actually sub-par and even borderline unprofessional. While serving our entree, our waiter also cleared off the table at the same time and wrestled around our used plates with the dish he was serving.

Getting antsy?Don't get me wrong.  This place is perfect for a drink after a show, or before a show, or for a cocktail before going out and having fun, or if you just need to take a break. But it isn't really good for a meal.  Or for more than 40 minutes (the time it takes to rotate).It is good.  The folks back home will be impressed with your story of a rotating bar 50 stories above Times Square.  But honestly: it isn't good enough to be a destination on its own.  Finish your drink.  Let's get out of here and join the party.",1,1,1,Dan C.,"Pearl River, NY",1,19,0
2.0,11/11/2008,"Want to hear of a real tourist trap?  This place currently tops my list (a list that I hope I will never have to fill.)  Last August, we met up with our friends from France and decided to show the kids sights and sounds of Times Square. They were a family of 7 and we were a family of 4. While the dads looked to see what deals they could find at TKTS (which was moved from the streets and into the Marriott Marquis), the moms tried to contain the kids in one place. French mom suddenly remembered that she and her husband used to enjoy the view from the top of the hotel back in the 90's. She led our whole party inside.  Of course, the kids were enjoying every moment of it-- the escalator, the glass elevator that soars above everything and the whole international ambience.  Before we knew it, we were already being seated and our orders were being taken.I must admit, for the size of our party (and the number of *already-filthy-looking-from-walking-the-streets* kids we had with us), they accommodated us pretty quickly.  But, I think that was part of the trap.  We were a bunch of tired and overwhelmed parents and at that moment, we were just happy to be settled in one place. The receptionist didn't happen to just mention that to be seated, there needed to be a minimum order of one drink each, including kids!  French mom was confused and started to stand up and leave.  My husband and I felt bad because all the kids were already settled so we decided to just treat them.  A Corona costed us $7.50, iced tea $7, and soda $3.95. Of course, the little ones who couldn't have liquor and soda ordered juice and that costed $4.60 each.  Wow!  Oh well, we all enjoyed each other's company and caught up with years gone by.  But all the fun ended when our friends' 12 year old daughter didn't come back from the restroom.  We were all frantic especially that the girl didn't know how to speak English.  After a long time searching, security found her on one of the floors of the hotel.  Apparently, when she headed toward the restroom, she saw a sign with the restroom symbol and right beside it, was an elevator symbol.  So she took the elevator and assumed it was taking her to the restroom.  Poor girl probably freaked out and started punching buttons, bringing herself between floors.  And I wouldn't fault her. I initially thought the same thing also when I visited the restroom.  The sign was really confusing.  It was a horrible experience, one that I'm sure none of us will ever, ever forget.  But, I have to say that the security was steadfast.  So, that's reassuring right?All in all, this place is one tourists should avoid (I'm sure no locals go here unless in a situation like mine).  If hungry, go somewhere else. Food is ordinary here.  With regards to the view, it really isn't spectacular.  Sure, the floor beneath you is rotating but your view is constantly blocked by this and that building.  We came when there was still light outside so maybe the lights of the city at night will change the experience.  Just don't expect the same view you see from ESB or Top of the Rock.  BUT, compared to the admission price for those two buildings, I guess this is one economical way to go especially for a big group and a family with lots of kids.",0,0,0,Mimi S.,"Turlock, CA",32,292,248

The elevators, like the restaurant, has a full glass window where you watch yourselves floating out of and above the city.This is somewhere you go if you don't feel safe in a hot air balloon but would like a romantic/unique night out with your other half-with the feeling that you two are the only ones in the world for those few hours.You're overlooking one of the most bustling/hectic cities in the world (it's a really pretty view) through a full glass window-on seats/tables that rotate around the restaurant....dim lights and mellow music set the tone for a romantic escape from the city.Please don't come here expecting the best meal of your life. Presentation is nice, but I've had better tasting food.They DO get half a star for the olive bread in the bread basket though! My BF tried it for the first time and he liked it too! and he's a little bit of a skeptic when it comes to trying new foods. I LOVE bread, I LOVE olives, and I LOVE him--I think you can put two and two together. The only other places that I've had olive bread in the bread basket was at Alex at Wynn and Nobhill at MGM in Las Vegas.They get a star and a half for the dessert! Even though we were SO FULL (from splurges before dinner...not from dinner-portions are appropriately small) we still couldn't help but finish all of the desserts (see photos). I believe this is the first time the beau had chocolate souffle and I approve of this delicate melt-in-your-mouth goodness being his first. O yeah...the main course and appetizers...not very memorable but I think the Chef changes the menu occasionally so you'll just have to get lucky.3 course Prix Fix: 69.95As the name itself suggests-you're paying for The View...which pretty much set the night for us.If you've got the money for a special occasion, I'd recommend this...or maybe you could just come for a drink and dessert and just enjoy the romance!four stars for the view and experience...if it were based on the food..i'm sad to say it would only warrant a 2 or 3 star...",1,0,1,Sophia V.,"Los Angeles, CA",366,159,337

The people we rode the elevator up god knows how many floors to get to this place acted as though they were the elitist of elite in America. Therefore, I wondered what I was going to feast my eyes upon when the doors actually opened. When they did about 40 floors later, I couldn't help but mumble- You idiots... We were greeted by a girl who should've had a string in her back for someone to yank on when guests arrived here..She was so fake, rehearsed, and used the same 5 words over and over and over.  The pro to that situation- We had 5 people and were immediately seated.. Now, back to the cons.. We waited about 10 minutes for a waitress to show up just to hand us a menu. If that wasn't bad enough, we looked over the menu, decided our drinks and waited another 20 minutes for her to surface again... When she finally did, instead of introducing herself or taking our order, she just blurts ""Ya guys, by the way , covaaaa charge starts in 45 min. 7 bucks per person.""  Well that's one hell of an intro. So we order our drinks which averaged about 20 dollars per drink, and decided to wait another lifetime... Meanwhile, we enjoyed a cool view and the atmosphere in this place is pretty decent.  We contemplated paying something like 30 dollars per person for the dessert bar, but were swayed against it after seeing the actual desserts.. They had TOOTSIE rolls in a jar!!! Granted they were in a jar in the middle of a dessert table full of stuff, but the desserts they offered were certainly not those of a 30 dollar kind.  Next time I entertain guests in the city, I would not choose to return here-  It's not all it's  cracked up to be.",0,1,0,Nicole H.,"Stockholm, Sweden",37,143,12

The food is overpriced however and Id much rather pay a lil more and go to asiate in the mandarin oriental.  The service was quite poor, slow and not unfriendly but not friendly either.  The desserts were pretty good though.. hail the patissier for that. Other than the dessert though its nothing really special I hear the bar is supposed to be nicer but i assume the prices are equally high for average drinks.",1,0,0,Akino T.,"Skillman, NJ",29,48,0
2.0,6/24/2006,"You won't find upscale dining or hard liquor atop the Empire State Building, but the view is better, the air is fresher, and it will cost you considerably less, even if you succumb to buying a tacky bronze replica with a thermometer in its side in the gift shop. Go there instead.",21,16,26,Gourmet G.,"San Francisco, CA",99,2099,2099
3.0,6/23/2006,"Only reviewing the lounge part, not the restaurant part since I haven't eaten here.  It's neat and touristy and semi-romantic and fun and right smack in Times Square. It's a revolving restaurant & lounge that lets you view 360 degrees of Manhattan, with a handy little cocktail napkin mapping out the buildings for you.  One time we were able to just go straight up and get a table with a minimal wait.  Another time, it was prom season and it took something like 45 minutes of waiting in line just to get in the elevator to go up.  Craziness.  But it was already late and we didn't know where else to go.  At least it was fun watching all the hooched out high school girls dragging their dates around, all matchy matchy too. Great place if you don't mind spending $20 or so on a ""specialty"" cocktail.  Well, to be fair, it came with a souvenir glass.  Total bill came out to $!$!$!  Yea, they charge you a fee just for sitting there.  Weird, but whatever.  Where else do you get a view of the city on one side and a view of the buffet on the other? And if you're worried about getting motion sickness from the revolving floor, don't worry about it.  It moves really slow.",2,1,1,spiff e.,"San Francisco, CA",55,462,146
5.0,10/13/2005,"Perched atop the Marriot Marquis, the View is a revolving restaurant and lounge that is sure to satisfy even the most cynical of non-tourists.  Drinks are pricey but very well made.  I enjoyed their hors d'oeurve and dessert buffet with an excellent selection of meats, pastas, salads and cheeses - all finished with an amazing dessert selection featuring an absolutely sinful chocolate fondue fountain.  The service is top-notch.",0,0,0,AC W.,"Phoenix, AZ",77,160,1
