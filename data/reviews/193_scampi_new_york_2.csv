5.0,4/27/2019,"I came back for a second time just for the Mafaldini Scampi pasta - after my first visit, I couldn't stop thinking about it! I actually came back to celebrate my boyfriends promotion, I noted this on my reservation and the lovely hostess brought two glasses champagne for us to enjoy (unfortunately, both of us don't drink, but it's the thought that counts!). Before we ordered, we were also given a complimentary dish from the kitchen - truffle arancini balls - yum! They saw that we liked them so they brought a second serving. How thoughtful We decided to have the chefs menu, which we thought would be a great way to try their top dishes. Definitely recommend this for those who want to do a tasting - we has 2 crudo (mackerel and tuna), 2 pastas (spaghetti with clams and the famous mafaldini), 2 mains (octopus and swordfish, 1 vegetable (asparagus), and we finished off the meal with 2 desserts (budino and cannolis). This was a great experience and we had a fantastic time. The portions were perfect for two and we finished everything. Our favorites were the two pastas, the swordfish, and the desserts!",0,0,0,Tiffany L.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,25,35

5.0,4/20/2019,"Loved their brunch menu - was so hard to decide what to get. My two friends and I ended up getting the spaghetti carbonara to share (only available during brunch and perfectly chewy pasta noodles). Then two of us got the malfadini scampi pasta for our entrees and the other friend got the trout roe toast. My scampi pasta was also perfect, and I added an over easy egg on top for $3 extra to make it even more of a brunch pasta. Good portion sizes, perfectly cooked, fast service as it was pretty empty for Saturday brunch, and good amount of shrimp in the pasta. We also got bloody Mary's with clam juice in them, which were tasty. They have oat milk to go with iced coffee. Overall about $55pp including tip which was reasonable for everything we got. Would definitely recommend for pasta and seafood lovers!",0,0,0,Dana H.,"Manhattan, NY",766,296,1380
5.0,4/19/2019,"I've walked by here too many times and finally made a reservation to go. Upon entering, you're greeted with a big, friendly smile from the host, and we were seated, even though we were missing just one from a complete party (yes!). Our server had just the right amount of attentiveness, and I want to know who their interior designer is, because the decor was welcoming and modern. I had the prima vista and it's a pretty dangerous drink. Dangerous in the ""tastes so good, you'll forget it's a cocktail"" way. For my second, I ordered the rubino and it was also a perfectly balanced cocktail.As for the food, we love love loved the complimentary dip that comes with bread sticks (and asked for more). For the apps we ordered - the red snapper, which was fresh and delicious, the octopus was tender and artichoke was delicious. The beets? I'd skip. For our mains, we shared the scampi and campanelle -- and I'd file the scampi pasta dish (named mafaldini) under ""must eat"" items. I did feel guilty, since we were all catching up after quite awhile and the restaurant emptied. Yet, they never rushed us or asked that we depart (which was so nice). Their music selection was also on point, and we left happy happy diners.",0,0,0,Shu Jin S.,"New York, NY",134,933,5
4.0,4/15/2019,"Scampi was very accommodating for our large party size.  We went there to celebrate 3 birthdays!  Since we had two babies, the extra space was a plus!  Our server was also extremely friendly, helpful, and gave great recommendations on food choices.  The restaurant is nicely decorated - romantic and modern.  However, the lighting was very dim so it is more difficult to read menu.  I particularly liked the chicken - moist and tender.  The ceviche was also delicious.  My favorite was the dessert - chocolate gelato, hazelnuts, and chocolate (very rich).",1,0,0,Jennifer T.,"Oceanside, CA",42,13,0
5.0,4/14/2019,"Scampi just started offering brunch several weeks ago and if dinner deserves 5 stars, then brunch deserves 10. Everything I tried ranged from ""very very good"" to ""out of this world amazing."" Every dish on the menu is unique -- this is not the place for your run if the mill diner style eggs or a standard Benedict, come here for an inventive take on brunch classics. My favorites include the fluke toast, uovo scampi (comes with the best garlic bread I've ever had), and the scampi Mafaldini pasta (also available at dinner). The cannoli French toast and ricotta dishes were also very very good. Service, as always, is excellent. The restaurant is fully wheelchair accessible with an accessible lowered seat at the bar, which is especially exciting to see as this is not an option at 99% of places.",1,0,1,Anna P.,"Manhattan, NY",167,46,20

3.0,3/29/2019,"I had been looking forward to going to Scampi for months after looking food instagrams, and I understand why everyone is obsessed with the Mafaldini - it is actually the most perfectly done dish. I was obsessed! The polenta and other dishes were good as well, although some were much too salty. The interior is so chic and intimate, crisp and professional. I loved the ambiance, design, the professionalism of the staff. However, as much as i enjoyed the food, half of my family (including me) got extremely sick after eating. I believe it was food poisoning from the langoustines - which were overpriced as well. This set me off the rest of my trip at NYC. I wanted to love it, but thats just something I can't get over. The octopus was bland as well. In all, would come back for the Mafaldini, but weary to try the other dishes.",0,0,0,Madeline O.,"Yorba Linda, CA",562,68,87

4.0,3/26/2019,Had a lovely experience last night.  We started with the tuna tartare dish which was excellent and my dinner mate had the chicken while I had to try the namesake scampi.  I was not disappointed.  I would order it again.  The service was very attentive without being overbearing and they were very helpful in selecting wines letting my try several before deciding.  We were having such a great conversation that they brought us complimentary desserts encouraging us to hang out which was a great touch.  They use the handheld cc machines which I am not a huge fan of since it adds a bit of pressure on the tipping as they are standing over you waiting for you to sign but oh well.  They deserved a great tip so it wasn't really an issue.  I'm already looking forward to going back!,0,0,0,Trae F.,"New York, NY",0,5,0
2.0,3/24/2019,"Went there for the first time last night (3/23/19) Was totally put off by the arrogance and disinterest of the hostess.  She tried to seat us a table that was too small for our party of five.  When we insisted on moving to a more comfortable table she said nothing and was not in the least accommodating. The menu was oblique and difficult to decipher.  When the waiter started explaining it to us a number of us could not hear him.  When he asked for a little more volume he ignored us.  The prices were way out of line, however, the food was not bad.  The charge machine did not allow to see a breakdown of the bill. The ambiance was sub-par and the noise eliminated any chance of conversation at the table.  A pretentious experience that we will not repeat or recommend to anyone.",0,0,0,Neil Z.,"New York, NY",0,4,0

All were very good, especially the rib eye dish that came with potatoes (could have used more of those). Ambience and noise level very pleasant, w a Nordic vibe. Will be back soon-- second review.

4.0,2/6/2019,"I saw this place on one of the many food pages I follow on Instagram and decided to give it a shot. It's a really cute spot with a nice ambiance. The day I went, they were hosting a high school reunion in the front open area by the bar, so it seemed to be a bit loud and crowded in that area, and my friend and I also had to wait a little longer than we anticipated for our seats (which is why I took away one star). On to the food - I ordered the famous Mafaldini (the sole reason I came to the restaurant), which are noodles with shrimp, parsley, butter and lemon. Amazing. Perfect. Worth the hype. My friend ordered the branzino and that was cooked to perfection. We also split an order of roasted cauliflower, which was really good. All in all, Scampi was a hit. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was very pleased. The atmosphere was great, the food was excellent and not too heavy. I'll definitely be back!",1,0,0,Kendal F.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",162,91,485

There were a ton fo shrimp and the sauce was almost too good lol. I also ordered the Branzino that comes with leeks and spinach (I do believe). It was also great. The drinks were good and pose a nice kick after dinner (the slow creep is  real). The decor is beautiful and the space is larger than expected. Definitely good for a date or a faux fancy night out. My only issue - a very small one at that - is that there is no actually waiting area or hostess directly at the door.

3.0,1/22/2019,"I came here on a Thursday night--we had a group of 6 people and needed to make a last minute reservation day off and fortunately Scampi had an open table! The restaurant itself is really cute on the inside and has a lot of space around the bar to get drinks while you are waiting for your table. We ordered a little bit of everything to share, so breaking it down by section of the menu: Crudo: Tuna Acqua Pazza--I'm not big on raw fish but this was SO GOOD. It tasted really fresh. The only issue was that for $21 it was mostly tomatoes and not many pieces of fish. Grill: Branzino and Ribeye--both were fine but not that memorable, wouldn't order either againVegetable: Endive, Artichoke, Squash--the Endive was my favorite...it kind of reminded me of a Cesar salad. I didn't get to try the other two because the portions were so small, but the other people in my group said the Artichoke was delicisionPast: Scampi, Campanelle, Mezzaluna--The pastas were the standout for this restaurant. All of them were delicious! We got 2 of the scampi and one of each of the others. The scampi didn't have a ton of shrimp in it...it was mostly just pasta and the Mezzaluna was a very small portion (only a few small raviolis). The Campanelle was the best in my opinion, there was a lot of sausage and it had great flavor. After we ate we went to the bar for two rounds of drinks. The restaurant was closing soon so our bartender gave us our second round for free which he definitely didn't have to do--he could have just kicked us out! Also, I have to mention that in the bathrooms they are fully stocked with Listerine, floss, deodorant, and any other personal hygiene product you might need! Overall, this was a great restaurant to go last minute for a big group. The staff was all really friendly and the ambiance is cute and fun, but I think it was a little overpriced for the quality and size of the food. The pastas were the standout, but if I'm going to pay over $20 for a pasta dish I would rather go to a real authentic Italian place. I'm glad I tried it, but I probably won't go back.",2,0,0,Sarah A.,"New York, NY",1,13,3
4.0,1/13/2019,"So I guess this is a new spot in Flatiron. I really liked it. A buddy of mine wanted to do dinner here, and I was game.We made a reservation for Saturday night around 7:30, and the restaurant was busy, but not packed. We were sat and greeted immediately. Service was excellent from start to finish. The lighting is dim, and ambiance just right. Dress is business casual (though not enforced), and crowd skews late 20's to early 40's.Their menu is diverse, but not overwhelming. With just two of us, we opted for a bottle of red, cauliflower, Campanelle, and the roasted chicken. They brought the cauliflower and bread first, and then sequenced the rest of our meal. Both the chicken and cauliflower were good - not memorable, but tasty, depending on how you like both those dishes to be prepared. The real star of the show, however, was the Campanelle. WOW is all I can say. Make sure you get this dish if you drop by. After our meal, I was full (we finished everything) but not sick, which sometimes tends to happen with Italian spots.All told, bill came out to $100 / pp, which I thought was exceptional for a restaurant of this caliber. We never asked for water, the manager dropped by and asked how our meal was, and they even have a guy solely dedicated to refilling your wine! I was really impressed, and honestly curious as to why it wasn't more packed... According to my friend, I guess Eater or Infatuation or somebody wrote a bad review a few months back which has been turning away business.... sometimes I hate food blogging. This is a GREAT spot, that you should definitely check out! Amazing spot for a date, night out with friends, or visit with the parents, but make sure you leave the kids at home.

3.0,1/13/2019,"Modern and chic restaurant but not sure if I'll be back. I came here for weekend brunch strictly to try the scampi pasta and it did not disappoint. Loved the bread crumbs on the pasta, overall it felt extremely satisfying but heavy due to the amount of butter and cream in the dish. It was good to try once but don't think I'll be craving it anytime soon. My boyfriend got the brunch burger and it was the messiest thing to eat, the English muffin mixed with the runny yolk turned into a slimy mess that was definitely not appealing. One thing that left a bad taste in my mouth was the manager who offered complimentary champagne to this larger party but left mine and another table staring at them cheering and thanking him.

However, as depicted through the photos of my food I tried to capture. Nice vibe inside, excellent service. Very difficult to read the menu in the dim lighting, as I had to bring the menu inches in front of my eyes. I ordered the mushroom hazelnut pasta. Food was just okay, especially given the price. Dessert was better, but nothing spectacular. I may have enjoyed my experience here had I been able to actually see and appreciate what I was eating, rather than squinting and eating what seemed at times blindly. Probably won't be a place I would feel like I ""need"" to come back to.",2,1,2,Yuna H.,"Stony Brook, NY",2,51,104
5.0,1/4/2019,I had crossed this place a few times but did not realize how good it was. We did not want a pre-fix drinking thing for this year's new year so we went low key dinning at Scampi. I was very surprised at how amazing their food and their service was. They also had a champagne toast at 12'o clock! They had really cool decorations and it was perfect! I would 100% recommend this place. Things to try:- The bone marrow polenta - The burrata - The Scampi pasta (OMG! My new favorite Italian place in the city) - The chicken (So good!) - I had the vodka based cocktail (I cannot recall the name) - it was fantastic and also had a lot of espresso's to stay up!

We even add an order of the Scampi pasta after we all finished the first time we went there. The pasta itself is chewy, the whole dish was flavorful with great seasoning and oil and the crunch flakes are the highlight of the dish. Another recommendation was the squid pasta and the octopus, very well seasoned and strong tastes for both dishes.

No pork or cheese was detected.  Oddly, the tomato sauce seemed to have croutons in it.  I think they put them in to substitute for there being no pork.  There was no pork in my pork dish.

4.0,12/11/2018,"Came here for a weekday work lunch - the restaurant wasn't very crowded. On a cold winter day, the bright warm colors inside were very welcoming and relaxing. Feels more like a spa than a restaurant. Very different than the similar restaurants nearby with really dark and dramatic/edgy decor. The food comes in small portions and they recommend getting multiple items to share. The menu is broken up into veggie, fish, meat, and pasta categories so you kind of create your own meal by mixing and matching. This is a fun idea for group dining, but can be limiting if you're on a date or have a food restriction. Definitely not a good place for vegetarian variety. Yes, there are several veggie only dishes, but they are just sides or salads, not a complete meal. The only substantial vegetarian option when I was there seemed to be the cappeletti pasta, which I ended up ordering. The food was amazing - I tried the beets, Brussels sprouts salad, and cappelletti. All three had interesting texture and subtle flavor combos. The beets were particularly clever, paired with tangy goat cheese and tons of cooked dillweed. The strong flavors of these three ingredients balanced each other and calmed down the dish. The Brussels sprouts were decent, basically a simple shredded salad with some other dark leafy greens. Not a standout. The pasta was my favorite. Small size, but it was drenched in butter, cheese, and chewy mushrooms so it was very rich and satisfying.",0,0,0,Natalie H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",232,272,70

4.0,12/1/2018,"When this restaurant first opened, it was sort of difficult to get a reservation. I went the Monday after Thanksgiving and for this, they were dreadfully slow. Still more busy than other restaurants in the area which goes to show how good this place should be. The service is first class, attentive without breathing down your neck, fun and friendly. I love a place that refolds your napkin when you leave your seat, classy. The drinks are delicious. Try the Allora; the taste of fresh cucumbers is strong! The food was pretty good but not fantastic. My favorite dish was the Fluke Crudo. The fish is delicate and supple while the fish roe adds a salty pop, topped with a super crunchy mixture. Their namesake pasta dish was really dissatisfying though....The sauce was too sparse and pooled to the bottom. I had to keep stirring it in order for the dish to have flavor. This would have been forgivable hadn't the shrimps being way over cooked. They smelled like they were over cooked. Me not liking to waste food, I just ate it. I'll consider it due to being an off day. The other two dishes we had were good but not my favorite: artichoke served two ways and the anchovy dish.",0,0,0,Dia Q.,"Queens, NY",134,123,318

4.0,11/2/2018,"Really cute restaurant, went on a Thursday night and it was pretty busy. The waiters and staffs were nice and the food was pretty good. I ordered the ribeye and cucumber lemonade, my friends both ordered the Scampi pasta, and we ordered the cauliflower to share and for dessert we had the chocolate pudding to share. The cucumber lemonade was perfect, not too sour nor sweet, very refreshing. The ribeye was not bad, the cauliflower and the sauce was delicious especially the sauce that came with it! I didn't really like the shrimp in the scampi but the pasta was okay. The chocolate pudding was too bitter/sweet for me, but the ice cream that came with it was delicious! My friend absolutely loved the pudding though. I liked the complimentary breadsticks that they had and my friend said the sauce which was spicy was delicious, perfect match to the breadsticks. I didn't try the sauce but next time I will! Would definitely come back, a very nice spot for some Italian dinner!",0,0,0,Kathy Z.,"New York, NY",211,104,321
5.0,11/1/2018,"This place is so cute, perfect for a date night with girlfriends or your significant other. My friend suggested this place. She's a food blogger so she always knows where to go. They started us off with a glass of rose since there was some misunderstanding earlier and they took longer than expected to seat us. That was a very kind and unexpected gesture. We got the tuna tartare as an appetizer. It was beautifully plated and very fresh. Although I feel like it lacks flavor and wish they serve it with something crispy or bread to eat it with. For entrees we each got a different dish of pasta. One of my friend got the famous scampi and the other, squid spaghetti. I got the clam pesto pasta and it was incredibly  delicious. All 3 dishes was good, very unique in its own way. I can't say one was better than the other, really depends on what kind of pasta you like. My only callout was that my pasta dish was a little undercooked. We ended our meal with a Nutella chocolate pudding. It was the perfect way to end a wonderful dinner. One of the best desserts I've had in a while. We finished every bite. Must get if you're a Nutella fan. You won't be disappointed.",0,0,0,Meiki W.,"New York, NY",283,139,266
5.0,10/28/2018,"One of the best recent restaurant openings in the city, and I won't be surprised if it's hard to get a table here a few months from now. Here's why: 1) phenomenal service. From the hostess, server, busboys and sommelier - they were all so incredibly welcoming and helpful. Also really in rhythm with one another, which makes for a well-rounded experience.  2) spectacular food. I usually like to order a bunch of things and there's always a few dishes that miss the mark - but not here as we LOVED every.single.thing. we ordered.3) great ambience with awesome music and bar scene. Scampi would make for a great go-to for a variety of occasions. Here's the food rundown on what we ordered: 1) appetizers-cauliflower: served with a vibrant and slightly spicy romesco sauce. Really, really good. -artichoke served three ways- fried, raw/pickled, and roasted/sauteed with a bright mint-spiked sauce. Incredibly unique from any other artichoke dish I've ever had. -squash with buratta - caramelized/sweet and nutty squash with a good contrast from the cheese and herb pesto. Delicious.  2) entrees -scampi - the namesake pasta for a reason. Do not miss this. Perfectly al dente, creamy but not heavy due to some added acidity (lemon?), umami from the lobster broth and bright from the added herbs. This dish will blow you away. -capelletti: melt-in-your-mouth, pillowy centers of ricotta with meaty mushrooms that made this a really filling and well executed dish. 3) dessert: We landed on the Budino for dessert, which our server described spot-on as an upscale version of a kit kat bar. It was less pudding-like than I expected, but in a good way. It tasted more like a milk chocolate fudge bar sprinkled with sea salt and it had a great textural contrast from the crisp caoco/espresso nibs and hazelnuts, along with the creamy gelato. Nails the sweet/salty combo and we really, really enjoyed this. As a baseline comparison: L'artusi is usually one of my go-tos for Italian in the city, but I think Scampi may be even better. Glad to have discovered this gem and will be adding this place to my go-to list of restaurants for sure.",0,0,0,Shivani B.,"Manhattan, NY",25,65,53
4.0,10/22/2018,"The reviews here seem to suggest that it's really hard to get a table at Scampi but we were able to get one for 2 by walking in around 6:30pm on a Friday. The atmosphere is intimate with very dimly-lit candles and lights and some tables were empty while we were there, but the restaurant became pretty full and a bit noisier by 8pm. All dishes on the menu are meant to be shared, according to our waiter, but of course some are larger than others. We ordered the grilled octopus and delicata squash to start. Octopus was solid and the squash was surprisingly refreshing (esp with burrata mmmm). We then ordered the scampi pasta (of course) and the campanelle to share as well. Both were super flavorful and cooked to the perfect al-dente-ness. The scampi pasta had a heavier shrimp taste (i.e. seafood taste) than I expected but no one can ever say no to mafaldini! The campanelle had a very liberal amount of parmesan that almost smelled like pecorino, but sausage and parmesan is also a never-fail combination.

It was delicious, very smooth and fresh with a little kick of heat to it. The bartender Jeff was amazing with a great personality. Once we sat at our table we ordered the razor clams, shrimp scampi pasta, the grilled octopus and the sausage parmesan pasta. The razor clams are similar to ceviche, small portions but a good bite. The scampi has a great sauce and pasta was cooked perfectly, although the shrimp was a bit fishy I still enjoyed it. The sausage pasta was simple but tasty, pasta was also cooked perfectly. The grilled octopus was my favorite, small dish but flavor was great. Food was overall really good but the customer service was really what would make me return.

5.0,10/16/2018,"I had such a lovely date night at Scampi with my boyfriend this past Saturday. Tip: Be sure to make a reservation beforehand. The restaurant is very romantic; intimate, dimly lit seating and has a chic, modern layout. We were seated and served some thin, crispy breadsticks with a tomato bruschetta to start (so good!). Then, our server introduced himself and told us that all dishes are meant to be shared - about 2 dishes per person should do the trick. I am a big dessert fan, so my boyfriend and I split 3 dishes + dessert. Additionally, the sommelier stopped by to brief us on the wine menu. She helped us choose a great bottle of red for our meal - definitely a nice touch.Food wise, we shared the artichoke ($17), mafaldini ""scampi"" ($23), and the campanelle ($21) - Everything was delicious. The artichoke was a great start to the meal. It is served cold, and it melts in your mouth like butter! The cripsy breadcrumbs on the house stample (aka scampi) was the highlight of the dish. We also really enjoyed the campanelle - it was super rich, creamy and the sausage added the perfect amount of salt.Lastly, we ordered the budino ($13) for dessert and OMG it was so good. It is a bar of chocolate pudding with a touch of sea salt served with crunchy cocoa nibs and hazelnut gelato, HEAVEN! P.S. if you do/don't order dessert, you get little mascarpone sugar cookies with your check.

4.0,10/13/2018,"Went here with a friend after hearing some good things about this restaurant. We made a reservation the night before and were able to be seated at one of the high top tables right away.After perusing the menu, we decided to split a few dishes:Mafaldini scampi (4.5 stars): This is their namesake dish and it definitely did not disappoint. The pasta was such an interesting shape that really absorbed a lot of the sauce and shrimp flavor. The pasta was also cooked perfectly and definitely created a nice bite with the rest of the dish.Campanelle (4.5 stars): I was also really impressed with this dish. The sausage was super flavorful and really paired nicely with the parmesan and broccoli rabe. Again, the pasta was cooked to perfection and really was a well-rounded dish.Swordfish (3.5 stars): After those pastas, I guess we had high expectations--but it didn't quite hit them with this dish. Though the fish was cooked well, it just did not have the same attention to flavor as the other dishes. It was also a rather small portion.Overall, this spot is definitely a scene and serves up some great food. It is a bit on the pricy side, but the pastas are well-worth it.

Breadsticks were great, but undecided about the sauce.I would not say portions are generous but they are decently sized for most of the dishes ordered. The octopus dish could have had more sides since it wasn't super filling. Though we were advised that sharing was the way to go before ordering! The Mafaldini scampi was really good, the octopus was amazing, and I even enjoyed the branzino (I don't like/eat fish).

I mean there aren't many pasta dishes that when youre done their is still meat left over. I loved it. There was these super crunchy breadcrumbs on top and it adds much needed texture. Its quite literally a perfect interpretation of shrimp scampi. My only wish is that the shrimp were grilled. They put a lot of time into their menu and you can taste it. A lot of their dishes have nuts but everything is available nut-free. Even their pesto, which is completely nut-free to begin with. The restaurant itself is quite beautiful definitely a Manhattan restaurant. Good for fancy lunches or just hanging out at the bar after work.

5.0,7/11/2018,"Apparently, I was not the only one eager to try Scampi, as it was completely packed on the Tuesday evening I visited.  Thankfully we had made a reservation and were able to be seated immediately.  Despite the crowd, all of the tables were reasonably spaced, allowing us to enjoy our meal without feeling smothered by neighboring diners.  While my friend went with a glass of 2015 Montesecondo Sangiovese from Tuscany to start, I opted for the Il Fumo, a blend of mezcal, Carpano Antica, vermouth, Kummel, and orange oil.  Our extremely knowledgeable server had done a perfect job describing the beverage to me, since it tasted exactly like the ""herbaceous old fashioned"" to which he had likened it.  We enjoyed our drinks along with some standard, long breadsticks and an unique, spicy marinara dipping sauce.  Our mouths were tickled with heat, but we stayed focused on the task at-hand - deciding on what to order.  Everything just sounded so alluring!The prices of each dish were fairly similar, making the idea of sharing very appealing.  We decided to start by splitting the Grilled Octopus, which was served over baby zucchini and topped with a bold puttanesca sauce and crunchy pine nuts.  The mollusk tentacles had an ideal sear on the outside and a tender, meaty interior.  Moving on from here, we each just had to order one of their decadent pasta dishes.  My friend selected the namesake Scampi, which was served with curly mafaldini pasta, plump shrimp, and a hefty dose of parsley, butter, and lemon.  A dusting of bread crumbs added a delightful crunch.  Ah, this dish was just so flavorful and delicious!  The portion was also extremely generous and could have been shared...if you would be willing to give up even a noodle, that is.  Speaking of sacrificing a noodle, when I was close to the end of my bowl of Manila Clam Sauce Lumache pasta, I noticed a long black hair that was clearly not mine.  Typically, I would have pushed my plate aside in disgust, but, in this case, I needed to pause and assess whether it was worth disposing of the remainder of my tarragon pesto-infused dish of heaven.  I decided to place the offending noodle and attached hair strand on my side plate and alerted our gracious server.  He apologized profusely and came back with a new bowl of pasta that contained a bit more than the one I had given to him.  I immediately told my friend that there was no way I was going to finish the increased portion, but my stomach, however, proved me wrong...The dish was just too good!!  We were so stuffed from this satisfying meal that we could not bring ourselves to order dessert, which was fine, because Almond Amaretti Cookies were gifted with the check.So, yes, there was that one not-so-pleasant offense, but everything else about my meal at Scampi was divine - from the flavor-packed cuisine to the efficient service to the happening atmosphere.  I just had to give it 5-stars.",5,0,7,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

4.0,6/9/2018,"Highly recommend!!! Came on a Saturday night for dinner at 6:45. Had an OpenTable reservation and it took them a few minutes to get our table prepped but not bad. (By the time we left around 9, every table was full, so be sure to make a reservation for a Sat night.)The reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that the restaurant was super loud. We were seated at a table for 3 in the back room and had trouble hearing each other. That aside, the restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and chic. The food was incredible. They recommend ordering a selection of dishes and sharing, which we did. Shout out to our waiter Xavier who gave us excellent recommendations. Here's what we tried:- Tuna acqua pazza (tuna tartare) - 5 stars- Broccolini - 5 stars- Chicken - 5 stars - Mafaldini Scampi - 5 stars - best thing we had!- Cappelletti - 4 stars - still good but not as outstanding as the other items - Torta - 5 stars - Budino - 5 starsWe'll definitely be back!",0,0,1,Katie S.,"New York, NY",280,277,462
3.0,6/5/2018,"I've heard this place was good from coworkers, so I came here with my friend at around 6:30pm on a wednesday. The venue is pretty big, and there were a decent number of tables open. They said they only had the communal table open, so we sat across each other close to the end instead of getting a table. It only started to get busy and tables started to fill up towards the end of the meal though. For food, we got the broccolini and the scampi pasta, and the clam pasta. I would definitely say if you had to choose between the pastas, go with the scampi! The clam is more lemon-y flavor. Overall, pretty good food - the pastas are a bit on the more oily side. The service however is pretty slow. We were waiting for the waiter several times.",0,0,1,Tiffany W.,"New York, NY",250,306,213

We had razor clams, scampi, spaghetti, lumache, branzino, grilled octopus, and cocktails. Razor clams were a perfect way to start our dinner and every pasta dish was perfectly cooked to al dante.

3.0,5/21/2018,"Frankly, was disappointed by this place which was highly recommended from a friend.  We had made a reservation well in advance and we were looking forward to the experience.  Space is beautiful and a good mix of casual and elegant.   Instead of a table we decided to eat at the bar.  That's where it kind of went sideways.  The bartender was not at all friendly and when asked to suggest a wine by the glass, she suggested a very high-priced one first.  I fully expect the usual $12 glass of wine in NYC, but it would be nice to have a bartender that gives choices and opinions and not just taking money from your pocket. Instead we had 4 $18 glasses of wine with an attitude.  Besides that, she wasn't the friendliest at a bar that was pretty empty at the time (we went early before a show).  Food was solid but not exceptional.  Asparagus and Brussels sprouts are recommended.  Definitely get the mafaldini which was the highlight and very good. We had swordfish and branzino which was pretty forgettable and portion size was small.  Overall, good but didn't live up to expectations.  May give it another try as it could have been an off night, but there are plenty of eating places in NYC that will give you unexceptional food at high prices with attitude.",0,0,0,David L.,"Ann Arbor, MI",0,51,12

They did bring us to be back however which we thought was weird since we had a reservation and it was not packed at all at that time. It was just the two of us and we ended up ordering three dishes. Had to try the scampi pasta, which we really enjoyed! The pasta was long and a bit like the ends of lasagna. There could have been more shrimp but otherwise it was a great dish. We got the swordfish and wow, seasoned so well! Paired nicely with he chickpeas that were garlicky and cucumber slices. The service was also phenomenal. The dishes were a bit small (almost like tapas style) so three were good for the two of us. Also, they give these breadsticks with their own concoction of a dipping sauce. Got a kick to it!

2.0,3/7/2018,"I had saved this place on my list of places to go a while ago. We came at 6pm on a snowstorm day in March and the place was empty. Despite the emptiness, they asked us whether we had a reservation and when we said no, they told us we'd need to be done with our meal by 7:30pm. I was a bit taken aback considering reservation or not, I was positive half of those seats were going to remain empty by the time we left. I was right.We decided to agree for a less than 1.5 hr quick meal and forego the wine list. Our waiter, who was quick to attend to us, considering we were his only table, told us that an order of 4 to 5 plates is recommended for a party of 2 to get full because their plates are small. Despite his suggestion, we decided to go with 3 dishes to avoid breaking the bank.When the dishes arrived, we realized just how vastly we were misled. Each dish was normal sized and very filling. By the time we were done with our second plate, we were already satisfied and could have appreciated not having to pay an extra 30 bucks for a third dish, half of which we were going to need to take home. To his credit, he was very polite and attentive, and we did order a meat dish and 2 pasta dishes, but that should have also been expected from us.Now the dishes. They were not worth the hype. The chicken, which was marinated in herbs and came with a charred lemon, was just like your homemade baked and seared chicken. It was juicy, don't get me wrong, but was definitely not worth the price. Interestingly enough, despite their descriptiveness on the menu, the only ingredient they forgot to mention, the mushrooms, were my favorite in that dish. The pastas. We got Mafaldini (scampi); we figured you can't go wrong with a dish that has the same name as that of the restaurant. I enjoyed the parsley butter lemon sauce, but couldn't help but again wonder how hard it could have possibly been to concoct it. The shrimp was cut into pieces to give the illusion that there was much of it in the dish, which just seemed cheap and unnecessary. The pasta itself was interesting. It reminded me of the ends of a lasagna and absorbed the sauce well. The crunchy ingredient they put on top of the dish was also good for the dish.And I saved the worst for last. The Mezzaluna: braised pork ravioli with pomodoro and guanciale, an Italian cured meat prepared from pork cheeks. This was the dish that taught me I don't like pork cheeks. Experiment done and failed. Setting the guanciale aside, though, the ravioli still was just not good. The pork filling of the ravioli was too mushed to taste like braised. It was just not worth the order.Overall I was disappointed. Had their dishes not been so overpriced and the advice of our server not so misleading, I would have given the place 3 stars, but 2 seems accurate given my experience. I hope they learn to get a bit more innovative with their flavors in the future. For now, I'll stick to Osteria Morini and L'Artusi for my Italian fix.",4,2,0,Beril E.,"New York, NY",167,110,550
2.0,3/4/2018,"We were excited to have dinner at Scampi due to EaterNY's posting on it's hot March restaurants. We walked in and what a pretty restaurant, BUT sadly we walked thru the hip restaurant and into an alternate dining room that looks like one step above a Greyhound bus station waiting room. The lighting is different and much lighter AND you get to watch everyone head for the restroom. We had an early pre-theater reservation so the restaurant was no where near full....but we were segregated back to this room and seated at Scampi's worst table by the waiter stand where all the servers were traipsing throughout our entire dinner grabbing plates and water glasses & carafes. So irritating & the clanking noise was such we couldn't enjoy our dinner due to the scurrying around and behind us. As for the food,the Shrimp Scampi was delicious and the Chocolate Budino was divine but the tomato sauce on the pork pasta tasted canned and the wine list super weak. We were so glad to get out of there. I'm sure we were seated in the ""back of the bus"" due to our southern accents so thank you, but we won't be back.

All of the ingredients went well together in all of the dishes and everything was super flavorful, yet not too salty. The pasta was done perfectly al dante and was very chewy.

1.0,2/15/2018,"For starters, FAKE REVIEW GALORE, click around on the profiles of the posted reviews a bit, which I didn't do before making a reservation on Valentine's Day, so I was DUPED. A majority of the 5 star reviews are from fake accounts. The accounts have no friends and every review they've given is 5-stars which we all know is impossible. I picked Scampi based on raving FAKE reviews and because when I called, I was told the prix fixe menu was optional. Once we got seated, I learned that the only option was the prix fixe menu and told most of the menu options are available as options. Prix fixe menus are meant to set a baseline, a minimum revenue line, forcing each customer to order an appetizer, entrée, and dessert option, which makes sense depending on the occasion. Scampi is financially doing so poorly that they marked up the combination of prix fixe options by almost 30%. Had I ordered the same exact items I was served from the normal menu, my bill would have been 30% less, which is ridiculous. Not a single special or anything out of the ordinary, just Scampi looking to rip off patrons by marking packaging their normal menu at a 30% premium. One would think that this premium would come with a slightly larger portion of food, but that wasn't the case. The portions were non-existent and with the exception of the Mafaldini ""Scampi"" (shrimp pasta), everything was very mediocre. Dinner for 2 with no alcohol cost about $190 before tip.

The server, Xavier, was amazing. He had great suggestions and didn't try to push the most expensive items on the menu. You could tell he was genuinely excited about the food and being part of a new restaurant. Among the 3 of us, we shared a couple of items:1. Razor Clams Crudo2. Brussels Sprouts3. Grilled Octopus4. Spaghetti with Mint, Squid, N'duja, Lemon5. Mezzaluna - Braised Pork Ravioli The razor clam crudo was fantastic. The flavor of the clams was very fresh and along with the prosciutto, made for an awesome combo. The brussels sprouts were also really tasty, shaved raw and tossed with ricotta salata, pepperoncini and tomato. There was also some slivered almonds in there for good measure. My favorite dish was the grilled octopus, super tender, and served with these giant gigante beans. Among the two pasta dishes, I thought the spaghetti was the star of the show. The combination of squid and mint, unheard of before to me, was very tasty and I found my fork twirling more. We finished off the night with a budino (chocolate pudding, hazelnut gelato) at the recommendation of Xavier and it was delicious. The bitter cocoa nibs added a nice touch.

1.0,2/5/2018,"Don't waste your time. The food is mediocre and the service abysmal. My wife and I had an early dinner reservation recently and chose to sit at the bar. The space is beautiful and Tom Petty was playing when we arrived, so we had high hopes. Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there. It took longer than it should have for one of the multiple bartenders to acknowledge us. We ordered drinks and asked for menus, and had another long wait before we were actually able to place our order, despite putting out clear ""we're ready"" vibes (menus stacked and pushed aside, both staring straight ahead trying to make eye contact, you know the drill). We ordered two starters and two pastas. The first starter, yellowtail crudo, came out in a normal amount of time, and it was fine. But then came the wait. Finally, after a lengthy stretch, we saw our delicata squash starter emerge - YAY. Wait, not yay. We proceeded to watch the confused server sail our dish around the restaurant, placing it in front of several (also confused) diners before finally giving up and taking it back into the kitchen. The whole time this was happening, we were watching and saying, ""I think that's ours..."" and trying to make it obvious that the dish belonged to us, but to no avail. Goodbye, delicata squash. A little while later, the bartender serving us came over and put plates down ""for the pasta"" so we realized we apparently weren't ever getting the second starter, and that our server was completely unaware we hadn't received something we had ordered. But then out the squash came, about 10 minutes after the ""whose starter is this?"" debacle. Was it the same dish we had previously watched about 14 other diners breathe on? Was it a fresh preparation after someone in the back realized what happened? Who knows. In any case, it was boring.It was around this time that we noticed everybody dining around us had received breadsticks and some sort of tapenade when they sat down. We had not, so we requested it. Finally, more than an hour after we were seated, the pastas arrived. I'm not sure if the lateness was due to a backup caused by the time spent trying to figure out how to match an order with a diner during the starter round, but needless to say, the pastas were not worth the wait. The mafaldine with shrimp and the spaghetti with squid essentially tasted like the exact same thing, which is to say, barely anything at all. Both were bland, boring, flavorless and each seemed to hold approximately 1 total shrimp or squid, respectively. We didn't get to try the dessert, since we had to rush out due to being late for our evening plans (the total meal took about an hour and a half).

3.0,1/19/2018,"3.5 stars, couldn't get myself to give four despite  the few good bites here and there. Scampi felt like the experience you get eating at the olive garden in the Burbs. Decent environment if you ignore the tacky details and lack of ambiance, food was generally pleasant without anything outstanding, and the service was swift but impersonal. The dining room was so loud that they brought us the wrong bottle of wine and forgot our cauliflower dish (pass on that btw). It didn't help that when we ordered wine they pushed the most expensive bottles on the list.

We split the cauliflower, brussels sprouts, and squash for starters, and the latter two in particular were quite tasty--the burrata went very well with the squash, while the brussels sprouts had a nice kick to them (the cauliflower seemed a bit overcooked and could have used a bit more flavor). For entrees, we split the chicken, the spaghetti, mezzaluna, and the campanelle--the chicken was fine, while I very much enjoyed the flavorful sauces and fresh pastas.

The crudo is a great, light way to start the meal with some surprisingly delicious treats--mackerel, sardines--that I typically avoid at other restaurants. The vegetable section of the menu is not relegated to 'side dishes' like most places. The cauliflower, squash, beets and Brussels sprouts could stand on their own as main courses. The uniquely-shaped pastas range from lighter seafood offerings to heavier pork, beef, and squash/ricotta options but none leave you feeling overly full or guilt-ridden (as other reviewers have noted). And while I don't typically order chicken at a restaurant, the herb-marinated bird is AMAZING!

5.0,12/28/2017,"Excellent meal. Attended on a week night with a mix of uptown/downtown types, everyone was happy with the ambiance. We went big on Crudo, and it was a good decision.  Really nice use of heat/spice on the tuna that complimented and did not overwhelm. Fluke was great too, Castelvetrano olives are the olives that I wish were in every dish that has olives. On a side note, do you like beets?  Get them here. For main courses, the Swordfish was a winner. Well cooked, and nice crunch from the kohlrabi. I also tasted the Scampi pasta. Rich and satisfying. For dessert I was pleased to see that the cannoli came as two, instead of one. So I was able to share without knife and forking it. Why aren't all restaurants doing this?

3.0,12/17/2017,"So I'm a sucker for any restaurants in the Michael White family, or in this case, restaurants where the chef comes from the Michael White tree. I snagged an opening week reservation a little on the later side on Friday night, and we were seated right away. The fact that it was opening week showed with a few things throughout the meal. We ended up ordering one salad, two mains, and two pastas for the two of us, which I think ended up being one dish too many. All of the dishes were a deceivingly large portions. The meal is supposed to start off with some thin breadsticks and tapenade, which never made it out to our table until half way through the pastas, and only because we asked. Make sure your server doesn't forget this, because it's really tasty. The tapenade is picked / roasted tomatoes, peppers, garlic, eggplant, and probably some other magical ingredients. Very tasty.Lumache - this one sounded totally unique with the tarragon pesto, and was highly recommended by our waitress. The large macaroni noodles had a nice chew to them, but the dish was basically specked with a small amount of diced clams. The tarragon pesto is subtle in its flavor. Mafaladini - you'd really hope that the scampi pasta dish, the namesake for the restaurant, would be outstanding. The noodles are kinda like a lasagnette (think of lasagna noodle waves in the outside, but the width of fettuccini). There was something just purely satisfying about the mouthfeel of the noodles themselves. The problem, much like the lumache, is that they basically took one shrimp and diced it into oblivion. No big whole shrimp, or even big chunks. Just tiny little pieces you couldn't even pick up with a fork if you wanted to. At $23 for a bowl of pasta, you can surely put a bit more shrimp in there and have it large enough to pick up with a fork. I'll pause for a moment to further comment on the pastas. While both portions are large, it's all pasta and barely any shrimp or clams. My other issue is eating the two side by side, they have nearly identical flavor profiles. We would have appreciated our waitress giving us a heads up we basically ordered two of the same dish. Branzino - nice crispy skinned piece of fish, served over three large roasted cippolini onions and broccoli rabe. Again, this was another large portion, well balanced, and wholesome. Octopus - three good sized tender tentacles served over a large bean stew with some pork and garlic, with a hint of spice. Very tasty, hearty, and satisfying dish. There's also a little whimsical play with the single raddicchio leaves as they are the same color as the octopus, and have a very similar curl at the end. It's a playful presentation. For both entrees, there was something very wholesome about the preparation of the entrees in that the food was all identifiable. The beans looks like beans and the onions looked like onions. The food you were eating looked like the food it was, which I feel like is a rarity thee days. Brussels Sprout Salad - fresh and just a little salty from the green olives and ricotta salata. The meal ended with a couple of complementary amaretto cookies. The other thing to point out is how slow the service was. From getting menus to the service of dishes, to drinks, everything seemed to take forever, and at the midway point of the meal, the place was half empty (since it was a late reservation). I might understand more if the place was packed and it was 7:30, but this was not the case. Total damage for 2 pastas, two mains, a salad, and two drinks came to just over $150. I might feel more justified at that price if the pastas had a sufficient amount of clams or shrimp, but it felt a lot more like paying $23 for pasta only. Will I come back? Definitely a maybe. I can see the potential for this place to be awesome. I expect the service issues and speed will improve as the restaurant gets in its groove. The pastas are tasty, even if lacking in the proteins included, and mains very wholesome. For now though, I'm going to have to put this a notch below places like Scarpetta, Marea, Osteria Moroni, and Impero Caffe.",14,1,3,Dave F.,"Hoboken, NJ",429,633,1392

The namesake scampi dish was heavily buttered, and despite the waiters claims that the langostines were intentionally mutilated so we could have them in every bite, if felt like a cop out. Way too rich which masked seafood flavor.  Leeks were overpriced and forgettable. The clam lumanche were aggressively al Dente, like unbearably so. Further, the kitchen once again copped out and chopped up the clams. I don't like paying close to 30 dollars for clam pieces that could have come from a can. It's a price saving short cut that I sincerely hope they stop doing. It's insulting and we notice. The only good things that I'd come back for was the well cooked swordfish and the wines that were reasonably priced.",2,2,0,Allie K.,"Los Altos, CA",1,86,24

I had very high expectations because I was told the chef is from Ai fiore my favorite restaurant! We were greeted by a woman who told us that the dinner section of the restaurant is closed out I didn't care because I think their bar sections of restaurant is beautiful next to the big windows as the snow was falling was great! The waitress was cold And didn't really engage I normally love that but she seemed very dismissive. We ordered the tuna crudo a ravioli dish and grilled bronzino. Her exact statement was and that's it? And in a very rude way. The drinks were great! I loved their cocktails I would give them 5 stars for the drinks. The food.. tuna was horrible thick and very fishy, I am very big on tuna and this was horrible. I could barely chew the pieces. On top of that it was over seasoned with vinegar. Then came out the meals... the bronzino was over grilled the presentation was terrible and had no flavor (my husband is on a diet so that's why he chose this dish) I had the ravioli with braised pork. It was by far the worse part of the dinner. The sauce was so watery it was just water and tomato sauce that felt like it was out of a can with bits of sausage fat if I am not mistaken. It was just BAD! Couple next to us was complaining that their pasta was dry. This places lacks in flavor presentation and any creativity. The best part were the drinks.

Not only was the scampi true to the way it should be made (light, not drenched in oil) but the raviolis were ABSOLUTELY delicious. For the mains, most of the team ordered the steak and the serving was massive and perfectly cooked. We finished with a selection of desserts chosen by the pastry chef, Laura, and were delighted with the sweet treats she provided--who eats TWO cannolis??

We started with two delicious cocktails -- the Allora was especially tasty. The Prima Vista and another one that had grapefruit (forget the name) - were both very good as well.For food, we started with one of the crudo plates: Tuna tartare, which was prepared pretty traditionally with cubes formed into a loose mold with tasty bits of refreshing tomato and crunchy cucumber on top of a wonderfully light sauce/vinaigrette with thinly sliced jalapeños as well.Next, we had the signature Mafaldini ""Scampi,"" which was absolutely incredible. The mafalda pasta holds the buttery creamy sauce just right and the small shrimp (couldn't tell if they were baby shrimp or small chunks of larger ones) were a perfect addition. There was a great balance of lemony tang and warm, comforting creaminess. Then, to top it off, the breadcrumbs were a great addition on top. Finally, we had the Octopus dish to finish. Octopus is a very tricky food to get right. You want that tender inside with a nice crispy charred exterior. The Scampi team nailed it! The octopus was laid on a bed of gigante beans and pancetta.All in all, fantastic experience and well done for such a new restaurant.
