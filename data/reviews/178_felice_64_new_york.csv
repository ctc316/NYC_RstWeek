4.0,4/21/2019,"We came here for brunch with a group of 6. Service was excellent I must say and perhaps the reason for the 4 star review more than the food. They truly did not rush our group and let us linger through our meal and length conversation. The food was average, nothing to write home about. We had baked eggs and polenta with coffee and cocktails. But the company was great and we all had a good time.",0,0,0,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",227,1549,2438

It's a little on the dark side, so it can be a little challenging in the front corner, but it's not too large of space so it doesn't get too crowded.There's a nice wine selection, nothing too crazy, but we were happy to find a nice Barolo on the menu.Dinner was lovely: Bolognese, whole grilled fish, carbonara.

5.0,11/26/2018,"Pro tip: Best Brussels sprouts EVER. Their Brussels are pan seared in bacon fat, and it's the most delicious crispy on the outside soft on the inside Brussels I can ever hope to have. Maybe one day I will successfully replicate this in my own kitchen, but for now, I thank the heavens I'm within walking distance to this treasurer. Felice 64 is a popular neighborhood gem that receives some more mature clientele but is a great place to go if you're a wine-o or you would like to impress visiting parents. When it's warm out, they offer al fresco dining. There is a larger long table right smack in the center of the restaurant to accommodate larger parties, and a few medium sized round tables scattered throughout. The menu has excellent selections, including my favorite, the Pappardelle con Salsiccia (a thicker pasta with sweet sausage, porcini mushrooms, endives, and very fragrant truffle oil).  Unfortunately, the Linguine di Mare (seafood linguine) was not as good as I hoped it would be. Though I liked the heavy handed tomato sauce, the seafood itself wasn't super fresh and my clams were quite sandy. Oh, and see above for the best Brussels sprouts you'll ever have.",1,0,0,Rosa C.,"New York, NY",85,320,122

5.0,11/11/2018,"This little neighborhood gem is really experiencing a renaissance. Around for quite a few years, I'd occasionally pop in for lunch (love The panino con pollo) or dinner. Recently, I've found myself spending more time there, in large part due to the fantastic new chef, Adriano, who seasons everything perfectly, the manager, Ervis, whose charm and warm greetings always makes one feel welcome, and the attractive, dynamic staff - particularly Manuel the waiter & Kasey the bartender. Felice is a great place to eat at the bar if dining alone (you usually wind up in great conversations with other people around you) or a wonderful place to meet friends. It's also a place where you might find yourself seated between actress Jennifer Lawrence or NY Met David Wright, both of whom frequent the place (probably because most customers are cool and don't bother them). Some of my favorite dishes: the polpettine appetizer - delicious little flavorful meatballs; the cozze alla livornese - pei mussels in a fabulous broth. For main courses I love the fettuccine alla bolognese, the salmone- truly delicious - and the spezzatino di Vitello. Of course, chef also makes some amazing daily specials that are heavenly - particularly his glorious soups. If you're looking for a great neighborhood spot with terrific food and a charming staff, Felice 64 is the place.",1,0,0,Greg K.,"New York, NY",0,8,0
2.0,11/10/2018,"This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in NYC and it usually merits 5 stars. Last night was very disappointing and I needed to share why. My party of 4 started with an excellent mixed salad but the Branzino main dishes were really awful. Small whole fish, cooked too long, no accompaniment except for some stewed tomatoes ( excellent) served on a bed of Thyme. At any price it was awful. At nearly $40 each it was a crime.  Pastas are wonderful as are the desserts. But we left hungry, dissatisfied and feeling ripped off.",0,0,0,Kevin L.,"Chapel Hill, NC",36,15,5

4.0,8/24/2018,"Bummed about the service here, though the food was so-so and the outdoor seating was lovely. The price of this spot indicates expert service and fresh ingredients, but only the latter was satisfied. Cheese plate (for three, $19) was huuuge and came with a dozen mixed olives, grapes and apples, and 4 pieces of super-toasted bread. Unfortunately, the Reggiano had a musty flavor to it, but the other 2 cheeses (1 soft and the other, Asiago) were grand. Our ravioli ($21) were a wee over cooked but set well in a perfectly aromatic and simple sauce. The gazpacho ($13) was both fresh and rich. I did find it too grainy, though, and I ate the whole thing wanting for salt. Had to flag everyone down for everything: water, wine list, water, drink order, food. Spent most of my long-awaited girl's meal looking out for an employee, and left exhausted. We were rushed out once we'd settled the bill. Ha!",0,1,1,Jolene H.,"New York, NY",16,155,59

2.0,6/8/2018,"Had an embarrassing and unfortunate experience here. We walk by this restaurant on most evenings and have always wanted to stop because the place looked inviting. We made a reservation last night at 8 pm and ended up waiting thirty minutes to sit down at our table. While we waited, we were invited to get drinks at the bar, which we did and were then encouraged to close out our tab at the bar, which we did. We eventually sat down and while the interior is beautiful and inviting, our appetizer and pasta dishes were not good. We were brought a complimentary dessert, which was a treat, but when we received the bill, we noticed two additional drinks were on the bill and notified the waiter. The waiter went to remove the drinks but we were then approached by the waiter and the hostess to ask if we did in fact close out our tab at the bar, because they could not find record in their system. We did not keep the receipt so my boyfriend had to pull up his banking app to show that we did pay. How embarrassing. Even when we left, one of them said ""don't worry, we'll figure this out."" I didn't think that there was anything to figure out since we paid for our drinks and our food. The disappointing food and embarrassing service (embarrassing for them and not for us) are reasons we won't go back, even though we walk by Felice most evenings.",1,0,0,Gillian B.,"New York, NY",0,3,0

We both had the price fixe lunch, I had Crostone Ricotta and the Panino Classico. My father had the Poloettine (veal meatballs) and the mussels. We each had a scoop of gelato as well. The food was great, and our server, Floriana, was sweet, attentive and never made us feel rushed.  The only con I have is that sitting outdoors can be noisy with the First Ave traffic, but that's what you get from NYC.

3.0,2/24/2018,"This restaurant is lovely on the inside, but I was not too impressed with the customer service.  First off, I looked a bit like a student, had a backpack on and my nerd glasses, not exactly looking class, but I would say most science nerds post-work fit this description. I definitely felt like I was being treated like I didn't belong there, which is funny given there were two people in the restaurant on this lovely day.  I had a glass of white wine, which was fairly good, but I should hope so with the price tag of $17 a glass.  Additionally, the pour was a joke; I basically got a sippy-cup of wine in a big glass.  I am going to chalk this up to them wanting me to leave their pretty restaurant.  I took a glance at the menu, and there was some interesting options, but I decided not to eat given the icy customer service. As for the ambiance I would say this place is lovely for a date or business meeting possibly, but make sure you fit the part!  I did really enjoy the interior design.  The seats are comfortable, and would be a cozy place to enjoy a glass of wine, if I felt they didn't mind my nerd ars lingering around.  I would come here again for the right reason and the wine list, but there are other cozy places in the neighborhood I would recommend first.",4,1,3,Lisa E.,"Portland, OR",743,353,1149

There like 25 cameras recording everyone at all times. The pours are precisely measured (i.e.,stingy). Even though you've been going there for a decade, nobody really knows you that well, because the staff has completely turned over three times since you've  been going there. It's owned by the same people that own Casa Lever on Park Avenue, you know, the one with all the Andy Warhols. Good date place.   I like it because I look better under candle light. ;)Update. A glass of barolo here is $30. And even if you are the most regular of regulars, and tip well,  you get a precise pour and they never, ever, ever buy you a drink. I live a half a block away, and I really want this place to be better than it is. But it will never be a family place, where it matters that you spend thousands of dollars a year here.

The second time I had their salad as a meal. It was filling, fresh and full of tasty things. The prices are a bit high for what it is. I'm tempted to give 4 stars.

They had one of the best burrata in the neighborhood and I had it for the last time this evening.  I asked for the burrata starter, which comes with greens,  roasted red peppers, etc., with prosciutto. I told by the blonde bartender the manger refused to serve me this (it used to be a regular special or was on the menu) and I was charged full price for the appetizer but with only the burrata. The cost difference to the restaurant to serve it to me as a full appetizer is negligible. The total lack of customer service I received today, I was a single diner at the bar at 6:15pm, makes this my last trip. I look forward to finding better burrata and much better customer service else where in the neighborhood  recommendations? Please let me know.",0,0,0,alison s.,"New York, NY",1,2,1

Besides the fact that it took 15 minutes to get a drink, it was extremely unprofessional that the new bartender was being treated extremely rude by what looked like a manager. The manager was clearly raising her voice behind the bar and then began complaining to surrounding servers when the new bartender would step into the kitchen. Additionally we had to order our appetizer twice before it was actually put into the system. The food was amazing but again the service remained very poor. It got to a point where we couldn't take it anymore and after only 1 drink each and an appetizer, we left. We were recommended by a friend and had full intentions to stay for a few hours and have dinner at the bar but we couldn't bear listening to what was going on behind the bar any longer so we left.

In any case, service was excellent and the manager did come over a few times to ask how we were doing. The ambience is cozy and pleasant - nothing over the top. It's located on a corner so it's nice and bright. The bread is quite delicious with the olive oil.1. Calamari: I neglected to read that this wasn't fried. It came in a stew form with small pieces of squid. I prefer the large rings! The flavor wasn't bad, but just wasn't what I expected. 2. Duck and foie gras pate with bread: This was delicious. The pate was creamy and sweet. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough bread, and by the time we wanted to ask for more, our entrees had come. I would highly recommend this dish, especially if you have at least 4 people because there's plenty of stuff to dip the bread in.3. Ravioli: The portions aren't huge, but the flavors were good. Overall nothing that special.4. Branzino: This was good, but also not amazing. What I thought was amazing was actually the vegetables that the branzino came on! I liked the orange sauce they had, which went very well with the fish. 5. Coffee and small cookies: A delightful little display to end a meal. The small coin-shaped cookies with the chocolate swirls were awesome.6. Hazelnut cake: Must GET!

Ended up w this Italian restaurant because it both offered filet mignon AND delivery. ATTENTION: Our meal took an HOUR AND A HALF to arrive. No joke. Luckily it wasn't that cold. Still slightly warm. Def not hot. Secondly the baked potatoes we ordered were t with the order. Nada. Charged yes. But not included. Instead there were a few little potato wedges in the box. The sautéed spinach on the side was exactly two bite-fulls and no more. The filet was very good. Gotta hand them that. Damn perfect. Ordered Tiramisu for desert of course. Surprised to find out it was $9! Seriously. None dollars?!? This better be one big delicious tiramisu... But see attached photo... Barely two to three bites in total. Def not enough for two people to share.

The salmon was cooked perfectly (their standard is medium), the asparagus was tender top to bottom and the potatoes had great flavor. The dish came with a thick light mustard sauce that you could use as much or as little as you like. I used it all! My companion had the ravioli and thought it was excellent. It was handmade with spinach and ricotta filling and a sage butter sauce. Very tasty. We ordered the Aracini (sp - rice balls) appetizer, which was fantastic. Crispy outside, creamy risotto-like inside and a light dill dipping sauce. The only downer was the kale side dish. It was flavorful with pine nuts and dried cherries, but the kale was very tough (think chew a long time) - seems like it was sauteed without any prior steaming. Kale needs a bit of steaming.The service was good - the everyone on the staff was attentive and the water glasses were always full. The empty appetizer dishes and bread basket weren't removed until the end with the rest of the dishes, but that's the only recommendation I would make to them.There was a tremendous wine menu, but I we can't drink right now (very disappointing).The people complaining about price should look at the $$$ notation on the place and realize that $$$ in NYC is pretty expensive.

4.0,4/8/2015,"While I'm not often in the neighborhood I was thrilled with a spur of the moment dinner we had there. Not only was the food very delicious and authentically Italian, the service was excellent without being overly solicitous. They served one of the best lamb dishes I've had in a while, a roast shoulder portion that almost melted. Fresh Pasta special with an uncommon twist and good salad with crisp clean dressing - everything we had was top of the line.As expected the wine election was great, of course heavily Italian but including some of my favorite less common types and most at very competitive cost.Overall we a wonderful dinner on a quite evening, but the design is a bit spartan and I can see it may become too crowded and noisy on popular nights.",1,0,0,Elliot J.,"San Diego, CA",3,123,4

Besides the atmosphere and staff being great the food was delicious. Those breadsticks on the bar are the first things to grab!

4.0,1/25/2015,"On a rainy Saturday evening when we had no plans,  my fiancé and I asked another couple who lived nearby if they wanted to stay local and go to Felice 64 for dinner. I hadn't been back to any of the Felice restaurants since my ""1st"" date with Ben and I am glad we decided to visit this place once again! We had gone to the one located in the 80's previously, and I must say that if I had to compare the two locations, I much prefer Felice 64. It is smaller, more intimate, and seems much more rustic Italian. Although, it is unfortunate that they do not accept reservations and are not on Open Table when, the other Felice locations are on Open Table. The charcuterie selection is very mouthwatering and delicious. Each bite of cheese and meat was scrumptious and of superb, fresh quality. The Crostonis on the menu are all very unique and different. There are 5 different kinds to choose from on the menu. Some covered in vegetables and cheese, some covered with meat and cheese, and while one even had swordfish! We selected two Crostonis that looked extremely similar on the plate, but tasted so different from each other! Crostone Burrata Filante Eggplant, zucchini and burrata cheese served on toasted Tuscan bread with mixed greens.The eggplant was very fresh and a great touch that offset the flavor of the burrata. The burrata was extra creamy and melted in your mouth. The bread was nice and crunchy which made it a nice compliment to the burrata.  Crostone RicottaFig jam, ricotta, honey and toasted almonds served on toasted Tuscan bread with mixed greens. The fig jam and honey offset the rich taste of the ricotta. The toasted almonds gave it that nice crunchy texture and nutty flavor. MMM MMM good!Fusilli al Ferretto served with homemade tomato sauce and burrata cheeseAnything with burrata is good! The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was fresh and you could tell it was made in house. Seafood Special with LobsterThis was a great choice from the special menu. It was loaded with seafood, especially lobster! I would order it every time if it was on the regular menu.Felice 64 is definitely a place to return to! It is great for a casual night out in the neighborhood, a romantic date, or even a special occasion.We selected two very Crostonis that looked extremely similar on the plate, but tasted so different from each other!",2,1,2,Carlen M.,"Manhattan, NY",370,97,473

Wood tables with tufted leather chairs. Wrought iron chandeliers. Love. The bread was super tasty and I was glad for it as my meal left more to be desired. I had the mushroom risotto and lacked flavor and was a bit overdone. I would definitely give this place another go as it's so close to home but I was sad that my risotto fantasy was not what I would've imagined.

Not for kids, either.Plenty of options - the meat & cheese plate we tried (small ) was two meats, two cheeses - the meat was great, the olive oil and olives on bread in the center were good, but the cheeses were unimpressive... just salty and no depth of flavor. Bread provided at the start was a bit stale and the single little olive oil dish was uninspired, plain olive oil.The pasta - tried the clam linguine, and was not impressed. Not gritty, but nothing more than a salty bath of oil and noodles with tough and rubbery overcooked clams. Disappointed at the dish. Didn't read the other reviews - homemade pasta must be better.And the candles on the table? Totally get in the way of your eyesight... ""burned"" into my memory, as it were. Too high and tall - they should put shorter ones in to avoid that problem. Service was okay - adequately attentive, but water was not refilled. It was reasonably busy, but I did expect someone to walk around.Very much a place for the romantics, but for a couple of friends just passing through to try the food, it wasn't terribly exciting.",0,0,1,Hank C.,"Jersey City, NJ",1732,2830,1188

Only thing missing was a fire place and some couches to lay on..maybe a business idea...Anywayssss we had a few glasses at the bar before we were seated at the corner table of a very small place. I was happy with the seating and glad I came early. We switched to a bottle of red and ordered the Crostone Prosciutto San Daniele which was served with 18 month aged prosciutto and black olive butter. The group of 4 ordered the Cavatelli al Sugo homemade fresh cavatelli with slowly stewed and shredded pork; the Fusilli al Ferretto with a homemade tomato sauce and burrata cheese; and finally the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese served with a veal ragù. Everyone was pleased and I especially thought my tagliatelle alla Bolognese was incredible. The veal was perfectly cooked without overpowering the other elements of the dish (pasta and sauce). The fact that the pasta is all handmade shows some serious dedication considering there are multiple pasta dishes on the menu. I will admit this, I wasn't starving tonight and I cannot wait to get back to this place to try some of the other dishes.

Now on to the important part - the food! The cheese plate is phenomenal.  I love it when restaurants have cheeses I have never heard of, so I can try new and exciting things.  I was unfamiliar with all but ONE of their cheeses (Humboldt fog - wuddup!) Impressive.  The chef sent a selection that was delicious and well rounded.  A great cheese experience - and we all know, in order to please a Tanya , you have to cheese a Tanya.I have tasted two pasta dishes:1) The fussili is wonderful - you can really taste that handmaded-ness.  Cooked to al-dente perfection.  And here's the kicker - they top it with BURRATTA! Not just regular mozzarella. Talk about a win!2) The tagliatelle with veal ragu - Holy meaty goodness, me likes!  It was rich and heavy - just as it should be.  I shared it with Brian V - and was glad I did so.  The meat to sauce ratio is perfect.

The salad was so small with artichoke hearts which i don't believe we're fresh. ll three dishes we're dramatically smaller than i recall in the past. i will say that the Wait Staff did everything they could by apologizing and replacing the dish.

I stopped in for lunch with my family, but if I ever went back I would hope it's on a date.The service was friendly and attentive, and the food was fresh although slightly lacking in flavor. Three of us ordered paninis while my Dad ordered pasta, and his was the best dish by far so I'm guessing that's their specialty. The next best thing was the coffee. They grind fresh beans for every single cup!One last thing to be conscious of is the price. HOLY EXPENSIVE. Maybe I'm still sticker-shocked since I just moved to NY, but our 4-person lunch cost $150.

Unique candle holders and lit candles on every table; wine bottles lining the walls. Our server, Joe, was so friendly and helpful.  The large cheese and meat platter was delicious! Excellent selection and a platter of that size, for that price, is hard to find in the city. That is where the ""great"" part ends.  The food and wine were not great at all... not even good for that matter.  I had the Linguine Alle Vongole. The sauce was the best part of the dish. I did order the gluten free pasta, and I do understand that the cooking times for this pasta are different, but the pasta was rock hard!! I sent it back and Joe took care of it for me. While I waited, my boyfriend had started his entree, the Milanesine Di Pollo.  I suppose he was just expecting more of an Italian style pounded chicken breast LIGHTLY breaded and pan fried. This dish came out (and even though was chicken) he kept comparing it to fish sticks.  It was hard as a rock and just not good!  I recommend going to this place for the ambiance, service, and the meat and cheese platter.

I had pretty decent vongole and also good gnocchi, but the portions are rather small, and menu items are overpriced. What I mean, is you don't exactly get in your plate the quality you would expect from the setting and the prices. The milanese for instance was a big disappointment for a dish that expensive. So I would recommend to stick with the simple dishes which are good, and avoid the expensive carne.",0,0,0,Nicolas R.,"Manhattan, NY",3,35,0

Our waiter is slow, and barely speaks audible English. VERY Italian here, can I get a translator?We all stare down at the menu, and are not finding any good ""snack"" foods, but then one menu in our pack is different. This menu is better, they have tons of Sandwiches.... Well this is the dinner menu (and for some reason Dinner is cheaper than lunch, makes no sense) and our waiter informs us no we can't do that. I stare up into his Italian eyes, and give him my puppy eyes, and say all four us really prefer this menu, can you please at least ask if we can order off it?Well he comes back 5 minutes later and says NO. He then also has to ask the kitchen if they can sub in items for my friend, or even remove something from one of the sandwiches. To say the least they were very unaccommodating. And to top it all off, they couldn't break my change for me to pay the bill.The Clasico sandwich was pretty good though, but not filling enough.

We asked our waiter for a wine recommendation and while the one we ended up choosing wasn't great on it's own, it paired very well with our food. For our entrees, we ordered the steak and potatoes with salad and the lamb chop with risotto. DELICIOUS. Seriously perfect. We finished it off with some pear and raspberry sorbet, both of which were great and tasted like the fruit itself.

After our experience tonight...I will definitely NOT be going back.We ordered 2 glasses of wine at the bar, and then transferred to a table once everyone was there. At the table, we ordered a bottle of wine. Immediately, we were pressured by both the waitress and MANAGER to order food. Mind you, our tab within the first 15 minutes was already $60.When we told the waitress we were interested in ordering a few appetizers, there was an immediate attitude that we weren't ordering more food. We ordered 3 appetizers, and followed that with a second bottle of wine.As our appetizers were cleared, all four of us were still sitting with at least a half of a glass of wine, PLUS the bottle we ordered was still about half full.  About 10 minutes later, the waitress dropped the check --- without asking if we wanted any dessert, or anything else. A few minutes later, the manager came over and told us that they needed the table and that we had to finish up.When we complained that we were not finished with the wine we'd ordered, the waitress offered to give us the cork, so we could take it with us!!! We spent over $200 before tip. I find it completely unprofessional and rude that we were A) pressured to order more food, and B) asked to finish up before we had even finished our second bottle of wine --- at a WINE BAR.

I live right down the block and pass this place night and day and every night it's packed and the girl guy ratio is probably 3:1  I'll admit I'm not the biggest wine fanatic with very limited knowledge but the people who work here do know their stuff and if you just tell them what you're looking for in your vino they will find you something to satisfy your palate.  The food is excellent and the cheese and meat platters offer a nice mixture of offerings but showing up here on an empty stomach is not a good idea at all as no matter what you order the portions will be way to small.  I could probably scarf down two entrees here and still walk away hungry.I'd give Felice 4 stars if it weren't so pricey.  Bring your credit card as the only person who can afford this place on cash alone is your friendly neighborhood drug dealer,0,0,0,Jack M.,"Manhattan, NY",26,8,0

The decor was dark, cozy, and rustic with a giant communal table in the center of the room.  Loved the installation of empty glass wine jugs above it.  However, long, cover-less candles burning at each of the tables scared me (hello fire hazard?).  Alongside the walls were rows of 2-person tables (the person along the wall sits on a long banquette).  Those tables were super close together, so if you are claustrophobic this may not be the place for you!The food was good but on the pricey side (mid-$20 for fish, teens for pasta).  The olive oil that came out with the bread basket was delicious, but there was something ""missing"" with the bread.  Too dry?  Not enough flavor? Could not put my finger on it.  The pasta was tasty, as was the bread with toppings (part of the appetizer menu).  Recommend the sorbets for dessert (try the pear!).  For those of you who are slightly impatient, I will warn you that service can be s-l-o-w.  For example, it was (or felt like) 10-15 minutes between when I finished the appetizer and when they brought out the entrees.  I'm not sure if this was a function of busy-ness of the evening, but it was annoying.Would I go out of my way - from another neighborhood to eat here? Maybe not, but if I passed by and needed a decent Italian restaurant in the neighborhood I may give it another shot.  If neighborhoods were not an issue, I would choose Spigolo or 'Inoteca over Felice.  If Felicce was not on the expensive side (and it's pricey for the neighborhood where it's located), I would have given it four stars.",0,0,0,Jane S.,"New York, NY",2,99,0

The best meals I have had here have been risotto specials that were not on the menu. I enjoy the crostinis, particularly the aged fossa cheese and honey.

It's the perfect amount of food to feel satisfied without feeling stuffed. But throw in a glass of wine or two and the bill quickly adds up.

The ""Linguine al Pesto con Patate and Fagiolini"" had a perfect balance of basil flavor and a ""creaminess"" texture, that mixed with a cozy décor, a rainy Sunday night and bright glasses of wine, being filled by the attentive service every time that inadvertently the wine reached the bottom of the glass, perfectly blended with a foot note at the end of the menu saying: ""Please refrain from using your cell phone, Grazie""",0,0,0,Diego G.,"New York, NY",1,1,0

5.0,11/3/2009,"Probably some of the most genuinely nice servers you will ever meet in New York.  Went here for a nice glass of wine with a friend and sat outside.  Great late weekday spot with enough traffic/people watching so that it's not boring, but not so much that it's distracting from conversation.  The wine prices were totally reasonable for the high quality, and the staff instantly knew what I wanted from a brief description from me.",0,0,0,Madhu R.,"Washington, DC",96,647,34
3.0,10/19/2009,Only been once for drinks. It was ok i guess. Nice dark lighting theme they have going on.  Hardly any space to stand by the bar without actually impinging on peoples space who were eating dinner...Prob wouldn't be tempted to return to try dinner for that reason alone.,2,1,0,Varun V.,"New York, NY",0,493,4
3.0,7/20/2009,"Felice is a lovely Italian wine bar and restaurant on the UES.  With glass jugs hanging from the ceiling and large wooden banquet tables, the ambiance is classy but chill, perfect for a date, or just to stop by for a glass of wine.They have a nice wine list, and I like the stemless glasses, drinks are served in. However, I have now eaten here twice, and while Felice is beautiful, I really haven't been impressed with their food.I enjoyed the Crostone with aged fossa cheese and honey, which was yummy and decadent, but not over the top.  The pastas are relatively plain and I was most disappointed with the Red Snapper al Vapor con Salsa alla Siciliana.  The cut of fish was very odd.  It was fatty and required a knife to remove from the skin.  The taste was nice, but nothing fabulous and the roasted vegetables served on the side were dripping with oil.We complained about the fish, and the staff were apologetic and removed the dish from the bill.  So, I did think they handled the situation well, but I am concerned that the food is just meh here.  I will probably give Felice another shot, since I do find the decor very appealing.  I just hope to be more wowed next time.",2,0,1,Gretchen W.,"New York, NY",40,121,7
4.0,7/15/2009,"I love Felice. Whether you've had a bad day or want to celebrate, its the perfect place. The staff is nice, the ambiance is cheerful but not overwhelming. The food is SO good. The ravioli de la casa is always a hit, don't be put off by how simple it sounds. My personal favorite is the Strozzapeti al Pesto Genoveze. Some of the best pesto I've ever had in my life -- and I have had a LOT of pesto. As for wine, I'm always a fan of the Pinot Nero. This place is worth it.",1,0,0,Alexandra A.,"New York, NY",0,7,0
5.0,5/19/2009,"This neighborhood restaurant and wine bar has a way of making our small group of friends (especially the Italians) feel right at home. The food is clean, simple, healthy and authentic, for the most part. The chef is Italian, as is the owner, who is almost always there. Jake, one of the servers, will always exceed our expectations for quality of service. The staff is incredibly sweet and friendly. My favorites on the menu are the artichoke salad, octopus salad, the lasagna, the ravioli, and you cant miss the homemade gelato. The decor inside is also very funky and beautiful.",0,0,0,N W.,"New York, NY",279,99,26
4.0,5/14/2009,"Everyone here was so nice! 4 of us came around 8 on Friday night. We waited at the bar for maybe a half hour for a table. The bartender was great in helping us choose a wine - he had very interesting descriptions for each wine. The cheese-plate and pasta dishes were also very good. The ambiance is one of the best parts though, the place looks like it belongs in the west village not midtown/upper east side, dark and candle-lit, glass jars on the ceiling, wood tables...! We stayed till about 1130 just finishing our wine - the place really cleared out around 11. Overall I would say it is a tad on the expensive side for the food, but everyone from the bartender to the person at the door was nice and welcoming.",0,0,0,charlotte G.,"New York, NY",42,91,9
4.0,4/13/2009,"Really good neighborhood wine bar near where I live.  Their charcuterie and cheese plate is HUGE, comes with lots of condiments, and is a good dish to order when you're just here for a few drinks.  Their pastas and risottos are delicious and perfectly al dente, and my favorite salad is the heart of palm and manchego (?) salad.  It gets pretty crowded during the weekend and the place is small, so be prepared to get cozy with strangers.  Oh, one thing...They have these long candles on the tables and I'm always afraid I will knock it over...",2,0,1,Yumi A.,"New York, NY",33,137,15
3.0,3/26/2009,"Work on the food and this place would get a 4.  No one can argue with the cozy cool ambience of Felice with the dark woodfire trattoria design.  They cram you in there but the (lack of) light, candles, ceiling wine glasses lift your soul and add that extra level of confidence to your voice.  Wine list is good.  There's only so much you can do with only Italian wines, but they do it.The food is probably the same as the Foccacia Fiorentina place the owners tore down to make Felice - low/middle class - same as you can find on EVERY SINGLE block in New York City.  It should be improved.The place continues to be packed in its 2nd year after reopening as the wine bar.  This is testament to the fact that atmosphere is everything in a restaurant as 3 other place within the same block have closed in the last 12-18 months.  With a $30 bottle (probably the top of the lowest quartile of their menu), $100 for 2.",3,0,0,Travis H.,"New York, NY",2,23,0

4.0,1/13/2009,"Great wine selection and cheese/deli platters. Typically a younger crowd with busy evenings, but rarely a long wait. Seating can be cramped with almost family style tables. I always begin with the beef carpaccio and arrugalu, hearts of palm, parmesan salad. I recommend the bolognese or pesto when they have it. The atmosphere can be loud, but hip with recent hits being played off their itunes list. Service is friendly and quick, a great place to take visiting friends, first dates, or anyone else that you want to impress, but don't want to more than $150.",1,0,1,Maggie M.,"Houston, TX",6,63,6
4.0,12/1/2008,I will make this review brief as my visit to this establishment was quite brief. Due to the wonders of Internet dating I recently met a early middle-aged honey at this UES wine bar for a first date.  As we were not eating dinner that night and just having what she called a 'chemistry check' we sat at the bar ( the litmus paper did not turn blue and I went home alone). Felice is an attractive place that filled up rather quickly with after work diners.  The bartender who assisted us was friendly.  The lady ordered the house white which very nicely complemented the cheese plate.  OK I am from the Bronx so to me cheese simply means that gooey slab of mozzarella that covers a giant slice at a local pizza joint. The cheese plate at Felice ranged from the sort of  bland to nearly sublime.  The names of the cheeses eluded me as they were an amalgam of French and Italian spoken amid the din of dinner conversation. Felice is a very good place to gain knowledge of a stranger while sipping good wine and stimulating your palate.  I would return to experience their entrees. $50 for 2 glasses of wine and a cheese plate.,0,0,0,Jason B.,"New York, NY",1,25,0
4.0,11/6/2008,"With glass jugs hanging from the ceiling, exposed brick walls, and wine barrels incorporated into its décor, Felice Wine Bar exudes a rustic vibe and provides an ideal venue for a romantic evening or an oenophilic adventure. More of a full-service restaurant than many of the city's ubiquitous wine bars, Felice offers an impressive array of Tuscan wines and Milanese food.  The generously portioned  tri-colored salad with avocado and diced mozzarella makes a nice starter, or share a plate of crostone with a variety of toppings. The pan-seared Mediterranean sea bass marinated in a lemony silmoriglio sauce with fresh vegetables is a light yet satisfying main course that perfectly compliments the Felice wine, a blend of Chardonnay and Vermentino. Another highly recommended wine is the nonpareil Varej, a blend of Barbera and the dessert wine Brachetto, jammy with ripe blackberry, which would transition well from dinner to one of four simple but well-executed cake desserts or twin scoops of gelato.",4,1,5,Lisa D.,"Brooklyn, NY",772,625,1139
4.0,10/28/2008,"Felice is a nice little wine bar, nice ambiance, friendly staff.  It's probably best for a date, but small groups would work as well.  I had the lasagna with a lamb ragu that tasted very homemade in a good way.  The only complaint would be that it was small compared to the other items my friends got.  I wanted MORE. I hate going to Italian restaurants, only to receive pasta that tastes like it was frozen and boiled.  Not the case here, and that's why I recommend it.  The people I was with had artichoke risotto and another vegetarian pasta dish.  Both were okay, but nothing close to the lasagna.",0,0,0,Colin R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,28,0

I don't really remember.I went with my boyfriend's family and his sister's boyfriend made the reservations at what he called a new wine bar on the upper east...which always intrigues me.The place was cute. It's pretty small and cozy. We were seated at the big table in the middle immediately, which is a good thing because there's not much standing room and the place was basically full.The wine we had was great and my dinner was decent. I had the octopus salad as an entree because I wasn't too hungry. Cute place but there are other wine bars with better food on the UES.",2,0,0,Katie H.,"New York, NY",125,106,0

Once, our entrees took a whopping 20 minutes to arrive (I'm being sarcastic here) and the bartender was so apologetic -- although we never complained -- that she gave us free drinks and dessert. Seriously, totally not necessary but still very nice of her.Food is decent. Not great.

4.0,3/17/2008,"OK so I went there last night w/ a friend and we loved the ambiance.  I think it's cute and well designed, plus it was warm (since it was so cold outside!)We asked the maitre'd for wine recos (knew we wanted a bottle of red) and he suggested this really pleasant non-oaky light wine that went really well with our HUGE plate o' italian meat and cheese.  Seriously - the plate was ginormous.  Definitely worth it.  We ended the evening w/ ""pistacchio goodness"" as recommended by our waiter, which was eh.  That could be bc I'm not a huge fan of pistacchios, but the cookies on the plate were the best part.  I can't speak to the rest of the food, but I think we're going to come back here soon to try it w/ our boys.  Overall it was a great two hours, and I'm eager to try the gelato and/or biscotti plate next time too!",0,0,0,Arielle W.,"New York, NY",24,212,0

Wine: A Food: B Atmosphere: C (due to Music - would be a B otherwise) Music : F Service: B My wife and I decided to try the new wine bar in the neighborhood, as we love to seek out exceptional wine bars in the city. You should know that I am from Italy, which means I know what is authentic Italian food and wine. Felice does have an excellent wine selection and good (not exceptional) food however they have very poor taste in loud music (50's bee bop & beach boys). The bad choice in music alone created such a poor atmosphere and unpleasant experience that I would not return based on this alone, well this and the average food.",0,1,0,carlos m.,"New York, NY",0,1,0
4.0,2/18/2008,"Part 2: Dinner for two.Service - good to V good.Wines by the glass - $8-$16, around six white six red, we tried three reds all were good.Apps - Prosciutto Ham with mozzarella mouse - a modest portion of ham with a molded fluffy cheese mouse was very tasty but lacked something...perhaps a drizzle of good oil or balsamic?Entree - Shrimp & crab meat pasta - two large shrimp atop the pasta were tough as old boots but the crab was plentiful and tasty.Veal ragu & tagliatelle  - sauce was delicate and lacking depth, I was hoping for a wow...but it was a let down. I like ragu's for their richness and the ability to coat the pasta with an unctuous  sauce.Puddingtiramisu  - individual portion was nice, plenty of alcohol and flavor, not the best I have had but pleasant enough.Price for two- $150 with 3 glasses of wine (total).Conclusion - I will go back, the place is beautifully fitted out and well run. I'd like them find a signature dish or a WOW to make me remember why I should go....they are not stretching themselves.Firstly it's a great addition to the UES!We had a pit stop visit tonight and enjoyed the wine by the glass, a nice Furore Rosso $45. The main thing here that stood out was a full menu and very friendly staff, we plan to eat here later in the week, I will then amend the review.",2,0,1,Paul C.,"New York, NY",76,446,362
