4.0,4/28/2019,"Helloooooooooo 1000th review, so my ex took me here for my bday in March and there were a lot of things I loved about this place from the decor to the food to the service. They were short staffed the night we went but I really wouldn't have known since the service was still excellent. Fun fact: the restaurant is cash and Amex only, they only accept Amex as a credit card because Amex was the only company that gave the owner a chance to build his credit history, so as a thank you, he only accepts Amex. They opened in 2007 and that rule has not changed since they been in business.The food:Tartelette de Chèvre frais aux Echalotes, Truffes, Raisins confits et Voile de vieux Gruyère- Baked goat cheese tart with shallots, truffles, grape and a veil of Swiss age 180 days. This is one of their signature dishes and it was exceptional. This was my fav dish of the night and I am not even the biggest fan of goat cheese. I loved the goat cheese flavor and the tart portion was executed perfectly. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Pâté de Campagne Maison- Homemade pâté de campagne with pickles and salad. Pate. This was just OK to me, the pate didn't really feel like a pate, it felt more like a sausage and that kinda bugged me. I wasn't crazy about how aggressive the mustard flavor was and the pearl onions made my face pucker because it was so sour. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Tournedos Rossini- Seared filet mignon topped with Foie Gras, shallots, port red wine, truffle sauce. The steak was great, I loved the pairing of a filet with foie but the dish does come off super rich and a tad on the salty side, but still a dish to get. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Gnocchi Parisian au Gratin- With Truffles, Mornay sauce and Swiss cheese. This was good, I enjoyed the flavor and it was really unique how soft the gnocchi was, it was like soft little pillows. This dish, as well, comes off on the rich side but this was rich and creamy. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Carré d'Agneau au Jus de Truffes- Frenched rack of lamb with white wine, rosemary and truffle au jus. I loved the texture and flavor of the lamb, I loved just about everything about this dish except for the fact that it came off salty to me, think it may have been the sauce. For me, the salt level on this dish was very noticeable. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Big Profiteroles- Made with bitter sweet dark chocolate. Nice dish to finish the meal with, it's a pretty big dessert so it's one to share. I enjoyed the dough and vanilla ice cream, the dark choc drizzle tied everything nicely. yelp.com/user_local_phot…",19,8,16,Ben L.,"Queens, NY",978,1001,2785

The tornadoes Rossini steak with foie gras was heavenly. This was my second time here and my husband and I feel like we found a secret.

5.0,3/29/2019,"Heads up: It's an Amex/Cash only place (some sentiments attached there :))I absolutely loved the dinner at La Sirène! It's a cute little place ideal for a date or an intimate dinner. We received a very warm welcome from the hostess and were seated at a corner table for four even though we were just the two of us. The food was delicious - I liked the appetizers better than the entrees. We had the ravioli and goat cheese tart for apps, and the filet mignon and linguine for the main course. The little ravioli had very strong flavors of truffles and the tart was super rich and creamy - I liked it better. The filet mignon was perfect with the foie gras and the sauce adding a lot of flavors, however the linguine could've been better, it was very bland and dry. We also got the Profiteroles for dessert and it was delicious, but I might get something different next time.",0,0,0,Sreerupa N.,"Jersey City, NJ",185,6,14
5.0,3/29/2019,My friends are I came here for restaurant week. We had a 3 course meal served by the young French chef who definitely can cook. I simply died and went to food heaven.

5.0,3/24/2019,"Viens dans ce petit restaurant!I came here and was blown away. For what the restaurant lacks in size it makes up in its authentic French food. First thing we had was the goat cheese tart and it was probably my favorite dish. It was tangy and creamy. Next was the French onion soup. I liked it, the onions were caramelized to perfections and there was a good cheese to bread to onion ratio. Following the appetizers, the cassoulet. It was the authentic rich stew with pieces of seasoned meat. Then the gnocchi, ""The French Mac & Cheese."" The sauce was thick and cheesy and the truffles on top curbed the thick, cheesy taste to a sharper, mature dish. Come to SoHo for this hidden gem!-zm",0,0,0,Zoë M.,"Washington, DC",0,21,41

3.0,3/4/2019,"It was fine, nothing was over the top special.  Beet salad was a lot of beets, but the cold brie added nothing to it.  A good blue cheese would have been much better.  Escargot was good but they seemed small for the size of the shells.  Rabbit again wasn't special, even a touch overcooked.  Filet Mignon was good and rich.  The long plate of sides they brought to the table were a highlight.  Chocolate lava cake barely had lava and tasted a bit bland.",1,1,1,Robin K.,"New York, NY",0,31,0

4.0,2/21/2019,"* AMEX or Cash only. ATM outside. I've had La Sirene on this list for awhile and decided to finally give it a try. The s.o and I made a last minute reservation for a Wednesday evening. The service here was absolutely amazing. I think their names are Stephanie and Fabiano? Very courteous, attentive, and perfect. The server was friendly and welcoming. She checked on our tables at all the right times, kept us in check without being intrusive, and had the perfect amount of personable touch. This restaurant is not that big but they are affiliated with Taureau next door. They offer a good variety of options on the food menu and wine list. I was not loving the atmosphere and vibe in the restaurant. The ruckus was caused by other diners in the restaurant so that sort of ruined my first time experience. Diners at another table were being obnoxiously loud and I was slightly annoyed of it. I kind of was expecting a romantic, dim, fancy dinner upon arriving. Now, for the food. The appetizers were really good. The Escargot comes with actual tools to help you enjoy these snails. I had a lot of bread with this dish and it was so addictively good but I regret that at the end of the meal when I over stuffed myself with bread. My s.o and I agreed to each have an escargot to the face next time, sharing was not enough haha. The truffle ravioli were little ravioli served in a ramekin pot. It was a small portion, but the flavors were impeccable here. My s.o thought the seared foie gras had a little off burnt tase but I thought it was okay. The entrees were very disappointing. Not sure if the appetizers uplifted my expectations or what. The filet mignon was very dry and even all the sauces did not make it taste better. The seafood linguini was very ordinary and bland. Nothing really stood out about this dish and there was either not enough flavors or it was not on the portion I tasted. I only had like two bites of this dish. Either I will skip out on entrees next time or stick to the appetizers. (I find this happening to myself at most French cuisines. The appetizers always wow me then I wish I had skipped entrees.) The Banana Brulee dessert was delicious! I highly recommend you to save room for this dessert as part of your meal.",2,1,2,Carrie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",546,336,2421
5.0,2/20/2019,"Fantastic service. Restaurant was quiet when we went, with only a couple of tables and some french music playing from the speaker. The ravioli appetizer was delicious, we only wish it was larger. The mussels were great too - we got the creole broth, which was salty and flavorful - we sopped up all of it with the bread. The cassoulet was savory, rich, and quite large - might be enough food for two people. The hanger steak was tender and cooked to perfection. The only complaints I would have, regarding the food, is that I would have appreciated if the bread were served warm, and if the steak had been drained a bit of its butter (was quite heavy). But considering how delicious it all was, I would definitely go back.The complementary vegetables (pureed carrots, chayote, grilled cauliflower, butternut squash) were a great surprise.The house Bordeaux was solid. Wished we had room for dessert.",0,0,0,Eric C.,"Manhattan, NY",46,32,0
4.0,2/17/2019,"Had a special night out with my wife last night that started with dinner at La Sirene. I must say, La Sirene did not disappoint. This despite the fact that I always *think* that I don't like French food.The restaurant itself is small and intimate with close seating.  Maybe it's more proper to call it a bistro.  Often the small restaurants are the best ones, aren't they?  More attention to detail.  The service is more personal.  This was certainly true at La Sirene.  Everyone we encountered was friendly, attentive and welcoming.  Throughout, they made sure we always had everything we needed.We started our dinner with cocktails and the beet salad with apples and brie. The salad was a lovely presentation on the plate and tasted just as good. Fresh and bright allowing all the individual flavors to come through.And then... then... then the cassoulet.  The winter cassoulet... Oh my.  What do I say.  A crock full of chewy, velvety, rich, meaty goodness.  A big bowl of heaven. Big enough for two to share if you're light eaters like us.  All the flavors had merged together perfectly.  Smooth and rich on the inside, but crispy crunchy around the rim.  E pluribus nom nom nom.  The combination of taste and texture was transcendent.  The staff was able to recommend a great wine to pair with this magnificent dish, which can be a great help. We ended the meal by sharing the croquembouche. Three choux balls filled with a wonderfully scented pastry cream and covered with a light crunchy coating of blond caramel.If we're ever in this neighborhood again to see a show, we will definitely be back.",0,0,0,Vincent R.,"Bedford, MA",44,113,34

4.0,2/8/2019,"An excellent meal was had by all on this restaurant week lunch. We ordered extra appetizers.  Goat cheese tart, escargot were excellent. But I truly enjoyed the French onion soup. The duck in cranberry sauce was perfect. Perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. Of the four vegetables served on the side, the butternut squash and carrot purée were both ranked highest. Next came chayote and finally the string beans.  Three desserts ended our meal, with the banana Brulé being the best.  Service was impeccable.",0,0,0,Michael C.,"Brooklyn, NY",77,657,5
4.0,2/5/2019,"A friend and I came last night to celebrate her birthday and get in on the restaurant week goodness. We made reservations for 6:30 on a Monday, and were promptly seated at arrival. Our waiter introduced himself and gave us menus a few minutes later. He also brought bread and olive oil, which we enjoyed. Going off the restaurant week menu, I got the French onion soup, roast Cornish hen, and croque caramel. Our appetizers arrived, and much to my dismay, the French onion soup tasted burnt. I thought it was simply the cheese, but tasting just the broth/onions by themselves also had that bitter aftertaste of burnt food. I don't know what happened here. I asked my companion to try (just in case I was crazy) and she confirmed there was also definitely something burnt here. We informed the server, and he replaced it with the pâté, a choice that was well executed, though not memorably exceptional. The Cornish hen was very well done, even the breast was tender and moist. They cut it into 4 pieces to make it easier for the diner to deal with. The stuffing inside was also quite tasty, like a more veggie forward version of the traditional Thanksgiving stuff. The accompanying veggies for 2 were fine, but nothing that stood out. I also really wonder what they'd do for a solo diner, as they stated on the menu the veggies were per 2 people. Dessert met expectations, with my croque caramel being basically an individual portion of a croquembouche. The caramel shell was a bit tacky and the custard could have used more... something, but overall it was well executed. What really stole the show for me was the second dessert- the hostess brought it out after our bill was paid and apologized for not being able to bring our original desserts to wish my friend a happy birthday. The fact they went above and beyond in this way was special, considering we've both been slighted by some much more expensive places. Would I come again? Yeah, and they have mussels, one of my favorite dishes, so I might be back to try those for lunch. Was there one dish that I woke up this morning craving from last night? Sadly, not this round. I also think it'd be a bit more crowded than I'd care to experience on nights like Friday and Saturday, and as others have mentioned, it is quite a small space.",0,0,0,April H.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,301,373
4.0,2/5/2019,"I came here for dinner during restaurant week and ordered off of the restaurant week menu. I had the Ravioles de Royan, the Pan Seared Hanger Steak and the Banana Brûlée. The Ravioles was delicious. They were so cute and tiny and had a great truffle flavor. The hanger steak had a good flavor but could have been much more tender; good but nothing to write home about. The Banana Brûlée was sort of a cross between a crème brûlée and banana pudding. It was rich and flavorful but the caramelizad top was a little bit too sticky and stuck in my teeth which I have not experienced to this degree with any other creme brûlée. The service was excellent and while the restaurant was small it didn't feel crowded - but I wouldn't recommend going during a busy time without a reservation.",0,0,0,Martha H.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,57,89

5.0,1/31/2019,"La Sirene is a wonderful French restaurant. I've been here once with my siblings and then once again last night. Everything from food to service has been excellent! (Also, the people there speak French!)I've only been to 2 places in NYC which serve good French Onion Soup. This is one of them! It's very flavorful, with plenty of onions and melted cheese on top. The Goat Cheese Tart appetizer is also good! (They also have Ravioles de Royan here, which is on my to-try list.) As far as entrees go, both the butter Pan Seared Hanger Steak and Braised Rabbit Dijon a la Creme (from the Restaurant Week menu) were delicious. The steak was melt-in-your-mouth tender and the rabbit was moist with a delicious creamy white wine sauce. All the flavors were great. Their entrees are served with a nice side of assorted veggies for 2. My steak also came with a slice of potato gratin, which they executed very well.

4.0,1/29/2019,"I came here for dinner during restaurant week with my family and had a lovely time. I had the french onion soup, the steak option (flavored with garlic and herbs) served with a vegetable plate, and the banana brûlée. The french onion soup was served in an adorable pot and had a great sweet onion taste. The steak went beyond my expectations- medium rare, lovely texture, favor, and of course taste. The banana brûlée was unique and sweet as expected. In terms of the interior environment, the tables are closely placed to each other and it was quite dim (negative part). The service was ok, but not what I would have expected from a classy restaurant. The price is on the higher end, but the quality of food is up there as well.

3.0,1/28/2019,"TO be fair, food here is made well but service is wack. We got introduced to this restaurant with restaurant week dinner. Came here on Sunday night at 6pm. Party of 2, we got onion soup and mini ravioli with truffle cream for appetizer, hanger steak and baked rabbit for entree, wrapped with banana brulee and profiterolles for dessert. Price is good value for what you get. Taste is more like home cooked french food. Nothing spectacular though. But entire dinner we weren't happy. The waiter came to take our order do not listen to us and make us shout back the things we want. He has issue focusing or something. I asked him what type of veggies are in the veggie dish for 2 to share. He said ""I don't know, whatever they have""in a really casual way like it's not his job to know. He brought some bread and olive oil. We had to ask two waiter twice for some vinegar. After we finish our appetizer dishes it's still not here. And when our entree came I just half joking to him asked ""did you forget something?"" He actually replied to me straight up ""well, vinegar is optional ..."" I am rolling my eyes to the back of my head and try not to show any temper and go on to eat my dinner. Well, after we asked twice at least you can come back to tell us sorry there's no vinegar or sth. But his attitude is killing me. He probably still want his tips, so he said he will bring more bread and vinegar. Vinegar finally came, forgot bread this time, and our dinner is almost done... And what could happen next, he brought wrong dessert too.  and he didn't even apologize and said he will bring my banana brulee too, as if its my advantage I got free extra dessert that I should be thankful. Again his attitude. Way to go!We tried to be more understanding since the restaurant is fully packed, obviously they are very understaffed and weren't ready for the restaurant week hype. Well if he wrote down our order and listen to us when he took order it would helped a little. Banana brulee was bad btw, uncooked sliced banana in very starchy pudding... I just want to get the bill and get out of here. Before we leave I went to bathroom, when I opened the door and came out, the hostess was holding a lot of dishes saw I came out and had to jump in front of me with all dishes slide across my chest. I was so afraid. Thank god I made a full stopped with both hands holding door frame. Otherwise it would be a shit show. She didn't apologize or think twice what she did there and carried on. The whole experience weren't every good. It made us feel they just want our money and get us out of here. The boss need to train their staff better. Homie casual lay back service style is fine. But your customers are not your bff at first encounter. You need to treat them with manner and service standards. Also that night across of our table there was a fat dude sucking face with his girl the entire dinner showing explicit PDA, flashing with his camera blinding our eyes. There were a family table next to us with two little girls screaming crying too. I had to keep rubbing my heads and relax myself not to go crazy. I guess we had bad luck and not very tasteful crowd that night either. If your restaurant is understaffed, don't do restaurant week, it's suicide. Ending note: At least the hanger steak were cooked well, medium rare, tender, they were soaked in a lot of oil in that dish, that bothers me a little. Layered potato wedge was yummy. Both entrees came with some curry powder round the dish rims as a way to spice up your sense before you taste it which is an interesting touch. You smell it but you don't eat it.",1,0,1,Nai W.,"Weehawken, NJ",22,58,17
3.0,1/24/2019,"*solely based on restaurant week experience*The food was ok, prices ok, space ok - hence the 3star. The restaurant was really tight - ie one step beyond cozy. It seemed like there was a lot of demand due to resto week but they packed everyone into two of the dining areas (there are three ""rooms"" of sorts). Kind of uncomfortable to eat when you feel cramped - not to mention all the winter gear everyone is sporting. I got the French onion soup, rabbit, and a banana brulee. The soup was alright, I realized I am not a fan of french onion soup but i think if i was i would have enjoyed. The rabbit was quite good but the portion size was very, very small. And i know its not supposed to be expected but they served it with rice but the portion of rice was literally the smallest i have ever had in my life (think three spoonfuls). The banana brulee was pretty good, kinda banana pudding-y but obviously more creamy. My friend got the pate as an appetizer which i think was a good start and the Cornish Hen which was actually quite good and a large portion to boot.

5.0,1/2/2019,"One of the best kept secrets in town. It's literally a block from the Holland Tunnel and you'd walk on by if you didn't notice the dimly lit glass windows and the door with the ""Only accepts AMEX, Crypto, checks and cash"" accepted here signage.  This cozy French restaurant co-shares a space with a fondue place, so make sure you walk through the right entrance.  (It does connects inside but you can't tell from the doorway). It's neighborhood gem status is totally warranted given by the quality of food and attention to details.  It is quite popular despite the location and the blink and you missed it, facade.  It's back story is probably more known than the restaurant itself.  The chef shares his witty charm and history of how the restaurant came to be ... and do note, bitcoin is accepted but NOT Visa and Mastercard - so hilarious.  The full story is what makes you root for him that much more and I do wish him continued success. Friends, you need to dine here. You just have to!I'm a lover of French cuisine so there were quite a few stand out menu items -- too bad I couldn't try them all!  Some worth mentioning as I saw a few plates floating pass me during my dinner.  The Canard (duck), the escargot, the foie gras, and the steak (any) are a must try.  My favorite foodie friend I dined with started with the Tartelette de Chèvre Frais aux Echalotes, Truffes, Raisins Confits et Voile de Vieux Gruyère (Baked Goat Cheese Tart with Shallots, Truffles, Grapes, and a Veil of Aged Swiss) was excellent!  I sampled a bite as I really wanted to order this but had another appetizer in mind.  The tart was paired with a side salad, simple but balanced out the richness of the tart.  I ordered the Ravioles de Ryan au Comté (Little French Ravioli Stuffed with Comte Cheese in Truffle Cream Sauce). Very good, it was creamy (comte cheese rocks) and light at the same time.  The ravioli's were tiny and visually appealing.For entrees:  my friend had the Magret de Canard (Seared Moulard Duck Breast with Michigan Cranberry Glaze) - also excellent.  The duck was prepared perfectly.  It was accompanied with potatoes au gratin.  I ordered the Tournedos Rossini (Seared Filet Mignon topped with Foie Gras, Shallots, Port Red Wine and Truffle Sauce).  A wonderful combination of flavors.  That foie did not disappoint, it was a sizable piece which was a nice finishing touch on top of a gorgeous filet.  This was accompanied by a side of potatoes, sweet potatoes and a Mexican squash (chayote).  The potatoes were plain, barely worth a mention but i was surprised they served chayote.For dessert, we shared the Tarte Tatin, an upside down caramelized apple tart with vanilla ice cream.  Nothing special but still delicious.  A great dining experience overall.  I would totally return and bring more people - so I can try more dishes.  LOL",13,7,14,Jeannie T.,"Queens, NY",372,532,7611

5.0,11/10/2018,"This place is absolutely wonderful! We started with the mussels. The sauce was quite light and although quite delicious,I thought it could have used a bit more garlic and butter. For main, the tenderloin with foie gras was fantastic. I can't wait to go back just for that. Finally we finished-off with the profiterole's and banana Bruleé... both wonderful! The ambiance is very warm and the service was very attentive/friendly. An added bonus is that they are BYOB all nights except Friday-Sunday.

The duck breast was cooked well and tasted good. The potato sides were also fine. Both desserts weren't good. Apple terrine was too tart and the scoop of ice cream wasnt helping. The dough that was on the bottom was hard and didn't taste good. The profiteroles were just terrible, mostly because of the added chocolate that tasted burnt? unsweetened? Not sure but it was all I could taste and it was bad. (The ice cream inside was fine).Also, the vegetarian options were somewhat limited.

3.0,10/26/2018,"Four girls came to La Sirene for a birthday celebration and really to catch up on life. La Sirene is a French restaurant tucked super west and it was a super friendly staff that walked us through the menu and allowed us to chat the night away. I really came fro the pan fried foiegras which they did not have on the menu that night which made me super sad. Comparing it to the ultimate French menu that I absolutely love and miss from Paris, there were certain things that hit the spot for me which includes the escargot and French onion soup. Escargot garlic and olive oil was best paired with the bread! I wasn't a fan of the steak tartare in terms of the flavor pairing, the chicken was a little dry for my taste, gnocchi was super cheesy which wasn't a bad thing, and the steak was just on par. I would probably still return to have the pan fried foiegras when it comes back on the menu to give the restaurant another shot! The restaurant accepts cash or Amex only (because Amex helped the owner thrive and allowed him to create his business with no credit when relocating the America).

3.0,10/2/2018,"Personally not my favorite French restaurant in New York. I usually judge based on how the escargot, which is probably not the best factor. The escargot was very plain and bland. We had the escargot, ravioli, rabbit, and the tournedos rossini. The ravioli and the filet mignon was really good. Ravioli was delicious and the truffle flavor definitely came through. The filet mignon topped with foie gras seems overly decadent but the flavors are just amazing. Definitely the entrée to get and their most popular dish for a reason. The rabbit was unmemorable.

Where things fell short include that the two red wines by the glass we asked to sample were both really stale, obviously they had been open for a while. We ended up having to order a bottle just to ensure the wine was fresh though neither of us wanted more than a glass. Service was super slow - not sure if that is on purpose but it took an extremely long time to put in our orders and get served. The French onion soup was fine, nothing to rave about.

The flavors were not too irony. The texture was smooth but still robust enough to stick well to the baguette. The accompanying pearl onions and pickles did well to balance the savor of the Paté with a sweet and tangy flavor profile.I should not have ordered the truffle gnocchi. It's really not a French dish. There was no protein. It just wasn't well balanced. For what it was, gnocchi in cheese sauce, it was ok. The bechamel was a bit gritty/broken but still had a nice dairy flavor. The truffle flavor was generic truffle oil, which is to be expected in this setting. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't incredible.

I ordered two glass of house something and 100% melbec(?) -again, I'm not a wine columnist. Amazing.Second was escargot. OMG. Where can you find this taste in the world? (In france). So far, this is the #1 escargot dish in my life. ( I cannot compare with others cuz there is no other) it was perfectly seasoned and cooked. Third, the main. Hanger steak and hen dish. You will easily find on the NYC restaurant week menu. Another world of the steak and chicken cooking. What did I eat before for steak and chicken? Korean BBQ and fried chicken? Yes, still I can give up that heritage, but it was melted in my mouth. (Can't believe it? Try it)Finale, desserts! Did you know that your stomach have another space for dessert? I found it today.

4.0,7/26/2018,"We were here for restaurant week last night. The host was very nice the afternoon of our dinner when I called and he accommodated my request to add one more guest to our four person reservation. The space is very much a bistro - small and fairly narrow. Not a good space for a quiet romantic dinner as it was loud but it was a great environment for our group. Several of us ordered the Ravioles de Royan, tiny raviolis with garlic and truffles in a cream sauce, as our first course. It was heavenly and the portion size was perfect. My husband and his brother got the French onion soup which they were also very happy with. For entrees my BIL and I chose the Oven Roasted Cornish Game Hen - it was so tender and savory in the au jus. My daughter and hub both ordered the Pan Roasted Norwegian Salmon, also a big hit. My SIL got the Braised Rabbit Dijon a la Creme - she said it was OK but did not wax lyrical. The restaurant was extremely generous with its side vegetables - brought three long dishes of a pureed carrot, haricots verts and potatoes(?), all of which were just as good as the entrees and thoughtfully presented. I thought that was nice since restaurants don't typically serve you sides along with your entree during RW. For the last course we shared an assortment of Banana Brulee, Croquants Caramel and Profiteroles - all were outstanding. The only reason gave 4 stars rather than 5 was that it took very long for the server (who was extremely pleasant) to take our order. To be fair he appeared to be one of only two servers in the restaurant. After that, though, the first course was promptly served and the remaining courses were perfectly and appropriately timed. I would definitely return here on my next visit to NYC. In this case, RW served its purpose for La Sirene - to encourage patrons who never would have otherwise known about this little spot to try it out, and come again to try other options after RW has come and gone.

3.0,7/14/2018,"We came in during the French Restaurant Week, however I don't think that's really a factor in this review, as the service was attentive but we were just not impressed by the food itself. I had the escargot (snails), the pollock and the banana brûlée. My bf had the ravioli, hanger steak and sorbet. And tbh, none of the dishes was up to our standard, and all we were looking for was simple authentic French food...(and my bf is French). Overall the entrees were too salty and they all came out with some type of sauces that we were not a big fan of. The appetizers were ok, but again, not impressive. The desserts were another disappointment... the banana brulee was somehow a twist of a traditional crème brûlée, however I think I appreciate the traditional version better as the simpler the better, unless you can be 100% it's a creative triumph. The sorbet was home made according to the menu, but it's a bit doughy. Additionally, the wine glasses were warm, which was not ideal at all though I understand that they might just came out from a dish washer.

1.0,5/7/2018,"This is the worst experience I've ever had in NYC restaurant. The food is ok. But the service is terrible. My friend and I went there for dinner. At the end of the dinner, after my husband paid and signed, he realized the waitress didn't bring his credit card back. As the restaurant is small and dark, it's possible that the card dropped from the folder on the way back. Instead of helping us finding the card immediately, the waitress insisted that she brought it back. It is quite interesting because we have no reason to lie about our credit card missing. Anyway, we've waited for 20 mins; nobody got back to us. We just left. My husband called the credit card company for replacing a card and disputing this charge. One month later, credit card company got back to us, in favored the restaurant side. Because the restaurant claimed that they gave the card back, it is my husband's responsibility that he lost the card. They lied about the whole thing. I am so shocked that a business could be so shameless. The existing of this restaurant is a shame for the entire NYC restaurant business.I've worked with French people. Some of them are super nice.

My favorite was ravioli which has truffle shaved on top. The portion is small, but the flavor profile is massive. For my entree I got the filet with foie gras, cooked medium rare. Wow, this was so tender. The combination of the fillet, foie gras, and sauce was a bite from heaven. Dessert, Big Profiteroles. I was thoroughly surprised on how much I enjoyed this. Light cream with chocolate in a pastry? So good. It's AMEX and cash only, so make sure you have those on hand.

5.0,5/3/2018,"This is my go-to place for dates and double dates. It's a cozy and intimate space that serves up authentic French food in the least pretentious way. Might I add that they also have the most delicious carrot puree? APPS: The little raviolis in truffle cream sauce were amazing; served in the tiniest little pot so everyone only gets a bite if you're sharing. The Baked Goat Cheese tart was surprisingly very good, large portioned, very creamy and savory with a nice bit of jam for sweetness. ENTREES: The pan roasted quail was very juicy and tender, sautéed with a really nice tangy fruit sauce (which can get slightly overwhelming towards the end). The duck breast with cranberry glaze was also made exceptionally well. The rack of lamb was not bad, cooked well but didn't have as much punchy flavor as the others. The Cornish hen dish was pretty standard. The entrees come with a little veggie tray, which is where that carrot puree makes an appearance. It is SO GOOD I asked for a big bowl of it on the side (and I got one!). DESSERT! The strawberry tartlet and tarte tatin (apple tart) were both not bad. For an extra $3 you can flambée your apple tart, which makes quite the entertaining spectacle but doesn't do much for the tart. My favorite is the ""Iles Flottantes au Caramel"", like fluffy marshmallows in a delectable cream sauce with caramel, MMM!The owner seems like quite the character, I love his little commentaries on the menu.

4.0,3/28/2018,"Intimate little French restaurant in Soho that's been a neighborhood staple for years. I first came here in 2011 and had one of the best meals in my life at the time (low bar as I was a poor student), but my recent dinner here reaffirmed that memory.Easily secured day-of dinner reservations for 3 at 7PM. The restaurant was near empty when we were first seated, but filled up through the course of the meal. Started off the meal with a bowl of French onion soup and escargot - both delicious and super rich. I desperately wanted to pour the garlic pesto oil from the escargot into my mouth, but decided using the complimentary bread to soak it up was a more civilized choice. For mains, the three of us split the Cornish hen, filet with foie gras, and roasted rack of lamb. These came with two giant plates of vegetables (mostly squashes prepared in various ways) - definitely overordered, but we gladly finished every bite. My favorites were the Cornish hen, which came on top of a rich stuffing, followed by the filet which was almost too decadent with that amazing foie, and then the rack of lamb.No dinner is complete without dessert, and for that we split another three things - the croquemboche (fine, but nothing special), strawberry tart (enormous and delicious, 100% get this), and sorbets (coconut and mango).This was all paired with a very reasonably priced bottle of red wine that the waiter picked out for us, but I understand that they also do BYOB during the week.Service was not as attentive as I would've liked, but there were only two people serving the entire restaurant so they were understandably busy. Things got noticeably better once the restaurant cleared out a little later.Total for everything, including tax and tip, rang in at under $100PP.

3.0,2/28/2018,"This place is kind of meh. A friend and I came for restaurant week super excited by the great reviews, and were really let down.To start off, the ""restaurant week menu"" pre fix essentially added up to what'd you'd pay if you just ordered a la carte, minus two dollars or so. So we went in feeling a little ripped off, but were nonetheless excited for the excellent food we'd read all about. We went classic french and got french onion soup/pear salad as our appetizers, steak for dinner, and sorbet/profiteroles for dessert.My friend summarized the food well when she said a lot of it ""was like wedding food."" The french onion soup was great but the salad was kind of sad, basically some leaves with mediocre dressing and a lukewarm, mildly flavored pear dropped in the middle. The steak was alright, not so tender and not salty enough. Pretty meh.The profiteroles were excellent and the mango sorbet was fresh. That made us happy, but I kind of wish the sorbet was an assortment of the three options rather than ""one big ball"" as the waiter described. Then there was the service, which was mediocre at best. We felt rushed in and out, the waiters were fairly brusque (read: fairly French), and it just didn't seem professional. The decor was also a little gloomy (not so opulent or elegant), and the candle on the table was fake which bothered me lol. So, if you're reading this Didier, up your game! We could tell that a lot of love had been put into this restaurant, but it didn't shine through.

It's not something I am into (prefer huge modern restaurants) but this will definitely be a charming romantic date spot.Since there were 4 of us, we did manage to try a fair bit of the menu. Service was personable and warm.RW MenuApps:Pate - more used to raw set pate. This was more like a cooked meatloaf. Very salty and aggressively flavored but I love salt and meat. Mini Ravioli in a cream truffle sauce - Yum yum yum. Presentation was super cute in a tiny cocotte and there was 1 teeny slice of actual truffle which I prefer over the bastardized truffle oil.Poached pear with blue cheese - I need to learn how to replicate this. This was ultra simple but the flavors just work. Entrees: Braised rabbit  - this must have been a gigantic rabbit because you get a full leg of rabbit - slightly gamey but closer to the taste of chicken. Hanger steak - this was the 1 miss. Steak was more well done than the middle rare ordered. I don't like it when restaurants slice your steak for you. If it's an individual size portion, I want to slice my own steak so that it stays juicy to the last moment. You want the juices on your plate not on the kitchen's cutting board. Vegetable platter - simple plate of vegetables with loads of butter. Zucchini, green beans and Puréed carrots made me so happy.Desserts: Profiteroles - one of the best I ever had.Banana creme brûlée - Love that they didn't over-torched the sugar and there's a decent layer of custard with a piece of banana hidden in the middle.

The menu was pretty quintessential with a staple of options to try. We went ambitious, heavy on appetizers and just one main course to finish up. For starters, brought in pairs, the Poires rôties au Bleu Fondant (roasted pear topped with crisped Bleu Cheese), accompanied by Steak tartare. The pears were delectable, and balanced. Topped with balsamic, and bleu cheese of all things, who'd have thought, but the French of course, such a complex formula to result in something so enjoyable! For me, a big star in the sea of plates to come. The steak tartare, i'm not as experienced with, but felt it was a solid choice overall. It was a bit intense on the onion side of things with a few large chunks, but the beef was extremely soft and mild. A few more pieces of toast would have been appreciated. Then onto the Escargots à la Bourguignonne and Seared Foie Gras with Balsamic Duck Glaze. No surprise, the escargot were on point, and uniquely served from the shell. Honestly, not much to say there, i've never had a bad order anywhere... butter... garlic... perfect. Foie Gras seared is my favorite way to have it. Came as 4 slivers in a pool of Balsamic glaze, which for me was ok. Spread over toasted bread, was delicious. I didn't go heavy on the glaze as I didn't think it was necessary nor did it add much overall. Finally, the main course of Carré d'Agneau au jus de truffles, or Rack of Lamb w/ rosemary and truffle. Recommended medium cook but came out medium-rare anyway... and was phenomenal. Highly recommended, so tender, melty, and delicately flavored as I come to expect with French preparation. Only knock is that the portion was quite small, just 4 tiny portions... totally craving more! Also just a touch lukewarm, but didn't take away from the experience. This was the highlight of the night, with the Pear, a surprising runner up. Finishing off with a 6th course was the Croquembouche au Caramel, puff pastry. The crisp caramel coating really elevated what can sometimes be a mushy/soggy experience. It was great, but i suspect from that experience that any choice would have been excellent. I've probably gone too long now. To wrap it up, defn hoping to go back and try their Linguine aux fruits de mer, and Kassulet Toulousain de la Maison.

It was fantastic!! The portion might seem super small but the taste is beyond it's size.The raviolis are super tinny, like the size of a piece of rectangular gum, surrounded in this light but very creamy sauce. And then the ravioli just kicks you in the mouth with its awesome flavor! The dish let's you tastes all the individual flavors and how they co-mingle, I loved it.The hanger steak cooked with garlic, lightly seasoned but perfectly paired to mingle with the four veggies...The flavor on the steak is light so those that love salt...You may want to add more. But you'll apparacite the quality of the meat, it didn't have me struggle like pieces of jerky with some bites in other restaurants.The dessert was a mix of the two different cream puffs:  caramel vs dark.chocolate. They were nice enough to let me mix one of each for dessert.Cream puff with vanilla cream filling, hardened caramel topped with powdered sugar... The hardened caramel on top had a hard candy feel that gave it a crunch with every bite.The dark chocolate one, had ice cream for filling and this pairs well with the whipped cream and mint. However, not my favorite...The pastry part of this one felt off.... I'd recommend the other one.And they gave the check with a lollypop lol..That's cute hahaha (watermelon flavor )FYI:*Amex and cash only was said soon as I walked in. *They actually have a wall space next to the hostess to hang your coats.*They check on you and explains the dish rather quickly but tells you everything about it. So listen carefully or ask for a repeat lolCon: If you come early when they first open, they're prepping the onions for the soup; because they have an open kitchen...Your eyes will get very sensitive like mine and tears may emerge besides the stinging discomfort.Side note:I don't know if there's a full moon tonight or cause this place is so close to Chinatown...This place became packed with Asians...

My biggest fear was being cramped in between couples but luckily we were placed in our own intimate two seater. When we were given the menus, our waiter briefly explained the menu... his attitude seemed very nonchalant. He barely smiled and questioned my friend's choice of wine. It was very off putting for me. Aside from our waiter, I ordered the French onion soup, the braised rabbit, and the banana brulee. My friend ordered the pate, salmon, and profiteroles. My French onion soup was amazing! Delicious. The braised rabbit was lacking something, I know rabbit isn't a very meaty animal but it just didn't do much for my flavor palate. It was drizzled with a heavy mushroom sauce that didn't do much to compliment the rabbit. The banana brulee was okay; I always prefer my brulee with warm custard instead of super cold. There was a graham cracker bottom which was surprising since traditionally it isn't really made like this. My friend liked his pate, I didn't really. It was too grainy for me, it reminded me of meatloaf. His salmon was delicious! Amazingly crunchy crust paired with a great mustard sauce. His profiteroles were good but yet again, nothing special. The dishes came with a side dish of carrot pure, cauliflower, and sweet potato. Delicious! Overall, my experience was so/so. There were some things that I liked and disliked.

We did not have reservations at 7pm on a Tuesday but the two waiters/host (I guess they were short staffed?) were very accommodating. I love the first page of the menu - the quirkiness of the chef/owner really made it personable. We had shared the french onion soup (good and cheesy) and mussels creole style (the chorizo helped with nice smokey flavors you don't usually get in a french mussels dish, sauce was very delicious - I contemplated just drinking it straight up but used bread as a vehicle instead - have to stay classy).  We also shared the hangar steak (eat it while its hot!) and the Kassulet Toulousain de la Maison (super hearty, cannot emphasize how perfect it is for a cold winter night - the duck meat was falling off the bone, bacon and sausage gave us the right smokey flavors. It was a little fatty but soo good). The dish came with a side of vegetables. Lastly we were very curious about this Dr. Davidson and why he keeps requesting this dessert with a long name ""Iles Flottantes au Caramel et Anglaise Parfumée au Grand-Marnier"" - who is Dr. Davidson and how did he come to pick a dessert that was so special? This dessert was so light, it was a perfectly sweet way to end our meal. Don't knock the House Bordeaux - really easy to drink and was able to stand up to our hearty meal.

I ordered the hanger steak, which was cooked to perfection (medium rare), but I also tried from everyone else's plates like the filet mignon with fois gras, seafood pasta, and the duck cassoulet. The duck cassoulet was a little much, with so much packed in, but if you're down for that kind of thing, go for it. The seafood pasta was delicious, with a good amount of seafood in it. We had also gotten the muscles, escargot, and steak tartar as apps so I was already getting extremely full from that.

I can't resist.  The filet was perfectly medium rare and the added foie gras on top basically made my eyes roll back.  I usually don't prefer filet mignon, but this one was so flavorful and nicely seasoned on the outside.  That foie gras though...For dessert, we got the ""banana pudding"" which was like a banana creme brulee.  Nice take on banana pudding... they even put a candle in it for me!I'm usually skeptical of French cuisine given I've had some pretty mediocre French food, but La Sirene definitely takes the top spot.  I will be back for that filet/foie combo.",14,3,11,Allene T.,"Manhattan, NY",2170,1311,3573

Then apparently I would expect a French restaurant to serve really good quality mussel with savory sauce so that I could dip my bread in it. However, the mussels weren't fresh and had sand in them. The creole sauce was just okay. Could pair with bread but I would expect more from a Michelin Star place. Regarding the seafood linguine, the overall flavor was too sour and did not blend with the seafood and linguine very well. Also, there was only ONE scallop in the whole dish but too much linguine, which made me doubt whether this place was trying to fill me up with these linguine. Indeed, I would recommend trying their steak/poultry dishes, but leave the mussels and seafood linguine out from your choices.

Otherwise, the snails themselves were cooked well, but not memorable.The house pate was smooth and rich--coppery taste of liver not as strong as I'm used to. The pickles and onions were a good accompaniment, as were the ripe mangoes in the salad.I wasn't impressed with the beets, but ordered it to cut the fat in the other plates (FYI there are complimentary veggie sides for mains). Loved how fresh they tasted, but in the end, it was boring in comparison with everything else ordered.Raviole...:D a little fancier (flower garnish) than how they presented it in Le Village (RIP) but just as amazing as I remembered.

I felt the polenta cake neither added to nor detracted from it.I got the kassulet to compare with the vegan one I had at Le Village--I prefer the meat-free version.

4.0,10/11/2017,"Stopped by for dinner this past weekend, and it was an overall good experience. The servers were attentive and constantly checking on us throughout the meal. We started off with the Sautéed Baby Octopus and Moules Marinieres as appetizers and both were very well prepared. The octopus was still tender and paired nicely with the mixed salad it came onto of. The moules were delicious and we even asked for extra bread to dip in the sauce. For the entree, we split the seared duck breast and the filet mignon with foie gras. The duck breast was nicely done overall, i personally think it was cooked a bit longer than necessary so the meat was a bit tougher than what I was used to. The filet mignon was done perfectly. although my girlfriend thought it was a bit too salty. When ordering, we were wondering why we didn't see any sides, but after our entrees came, the server brought out a plate of various vegetables. It was a nice mix of squash puree(?), broccoli, haricot vert, and potatoes. There should be an indication on the menu about the vegetables because we had almost ordered another appetizer thinking we didn't have enough food. Lastly, we got a complementary dessert of banana brulee due to some mishaps. I wish they had told us about the dessert beforehand because I'm mildly allergic to bananas. After one bite, I realized what it was and couldn't eat anymore of it. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and I would go back to try something else.",1,0,1,Christina Y.,"New York, NY",100,39,31
5.0,10/9/2017,"La Sirene is a very nice, yet relaxed, establishment serving French cuisine. We had dinner here Saturday night.To start, we shared the ravioli. These tiny squares of pasta are delicious. The truffle flavor comes through intensely. I chose the quail for my main. This magnificent dish combines two of my favorite things, fowl and cooked fruit. The skin is crispy and the meat is rich. The apples taste dark and sweet. While the sauce may appear overpowering, it is quite mild. There are some bones in the quail. The tart tatin flambé is dramatic, as it is engulfed in blue flames. Not every drop of the cognac cooks off, so the dessert tastes a tad boozy.The Kwak Belgian ale makes a nice accompaniment to the meal, malty with notes of fruit.",1,1,1,Mike B.,"Washington, DC",24,152,586

The booths are small so just be aware when you sit! First, the menu is really cute. I love the little comments that they have for each meal. We shared the mussels with chorizo and some cream. Really good! And fresh!We ordered the filet mignon, lamb, seafood linguini and rabbit. I would say my favorites were in the same order. The rabbit had more of a gamey taste to it, and even though it's only my 2nd time eating rabbit, I didn't enjoy it. I will say that I LOVED the veggie platters! Thanks to the yelpers I knew we could order more...They had chayote, cauliflower, carrot puree (i need this recipe b/c it was amazing), and our 2nd batch had kale. delicious and buttery veggies. :)Our waiter was super kind and not stuffy as you might think as they serve French food, and service was great!

I can eat that for the rest of my life. They give you bread so you can dip and inhale the garlicky and buttery concoction. We got the French onion soup and a house pate as appetizers, which were pretty good. For entrees, we got the seared pork tenderloin and beef tartar, which were incredibly delicious. Desserts were banana brulee and puff pastry drizzled with caramel.

The portion size on this one is humongous)- Banana brûlée (quite good, not the type that will make you dream about it though. I liked having actual banana slices in the brûlée)- Profiteroles (least favorite actually. The dark chocolate sauce could have been much thicker.

It's a cute little space with nice ambience. The food was fantastic. My mom and I both had the tiny ravioli appetizer to start, which was my favorite thing of the night. It was served in a delightful miniature pot, with top and all. They were decadent and it was a pretty sizeable portion. So good. We split the hanger steak and the salmon for the main course. I would say the salmon was a bit better, but both were good. They were also served with a small plate of various vegetables for the table. Dessert was profiteroles and the banana brulee. I'm not a huge crème brulee fan, but I could eat this banana brulee everyday. It was like banana pudding, with real pieces of banana, covered in a crispy sugar top. What's not to love? To top things off, the wine list was very reasonable. We ordered a bottle of the house white (Pino Grigio, I think) and it was only $35 but surprisingly good.

Feel free to ask for more bread to dip with it!For the entree, we had the seared pork tenderloin with cranberry sauce. The French way of this pork is very tender and juicy! We also selected the steak tartare, which is grind marinated Raw Beef! Huge portion! Certainly a dish not for everyone, but definitely worth a try. For the dessert, since we had four people, we decided to try them all - Banana brûlée, croquants caramel, profiteroles, and coconut ice cream.

5.0,8/7/2017,The hostess was like I will seat you next to the kitchen window so you will enjoy your anniversary date with the cooks. I actively declined the offer. The food was delicious. Escargot needs some work but the portion and the bread are outstanding. I enjoy bread with super soft interior and hard exterior (screw wonder bread). We got a bottle of wine as well which doubled our bill and it's kinda saddening. They do charge a $10 fee for uncorking your own wine and a weird byob rule which is so confusing.

3.0,8/5/2017,"**Restaurant Week Summer 2017 Review**My sister and I made a reservation through Open Table the day before and there were plenty of times available. We came in at 7 on a Wednesday and one of their dining rooms was full. And when I say full, I mean cramped, as in we were pretty much sitting elbow to elbow with strangers. It wasn't until I went to go use the restroom did I discover another dining room, which was almost empty. I guess they did that to make it seem more poppin than it actually was.To start, I had the Pate de Campagne Maison (served with cornichons, dijon, and pearl onions). My sister had the Ravioles de Royan (stuffed comte cheese and garlic little tiny raviolis with cream and truffles). The pate had too much of some type of seasoning - couldn't quite put my finger on what it Waals, but the pearl onions and side salad it came with definitely helped balance it out a bit. On the other hand, the ravioli was amazing. They even had whole pieces of truffle in it. The portion size would was perfect for an appetizer because anymore, and it would have been overkill.For the main, I had the Steak Tartare with Toasted Pugliese Bread, and she had the Pan-Seared Hangar Steak. I enjoyed my steak tartare but after finished about a third of it, it was a little much. I think this would have been better in a smaller portion, as an appetizer instead. The hangar steak was chewy but the flavor was excellent, as they cooked it in a generous amount of fresh garlic.For dessert, I had the scoop of Cranberry Sorbet. It was nice and refreshing after a heavy meal like this. I was only able to eat about half though because it was pretty tart. My sis had the Banana Brûlée (french vanilla custard with fresh sliced bananas and smashed graham crackers), which she loved.Not sure I'd be back, as I'm not a fan of cramped restaurants and I only thought the food was better than okay, and not great.  Tip - a glass of their house Bordeaux was $9, which wasn't bad at all, for its quality.",4,0,0,Mel T.,"New York, NY",444,1319,3267

Thinking that perhaps (given their BYO policy) they were leery of people coming in, ordering one dish and then drinking lots of the wine they'd brought, I explained that would not happen. (My intent had been for each of us to have a glass of the Cremant as an aperitif, give the rest to someone at the next table or to the kitchen, and then have our red Vaucluse at dinner.) With the exception of our waiter, the staff was disdainful. (We are New Yorkers and were wearing business casual.) The reservation had been made through ""open table"" and it's my belief that the bad attitude might have been sussed out by telephoning the restaurant directly, causing me to wonder why one would use ""open table.""  In addition, when my companion had attempted to make a 7:00pm reservation via open table, none were available.  Oddly, when we arrived at 6:45pm the restaurant was empty and remained that way until about 8:15pm.Although this restaurant does not bill itself as major, my hope had been that we would find delicious bistro food on the order of Les Enfants de Boheme or (now sadly passed) La Lunchonette but the rabbit was dry and tasteless, and the bread barely passable.",0,0,0,Cora C.,"Long Island City, New York, NY",0,1,0

And of course, that is almost always the start of terrible downfall. I had the grilled octopus salad (with mushroom and tomatoes) to start and the Seafood Linguini as the main, per the waiter's suggestion. Both are good, but not great. The octopus salad was definitely better than the linguini. While the seafood is actually pretty fresh, the linguini noodle and sauce is actually bitter. I had to remind myself that I should just not bother getting seafood outside of the Pacific NW, because it's surely going to disappoint. The service was good, but given the price, I would not be inspired to go back.--- update ---owner contacted me and gave me a run down of what he thought went wrong back in the kitchen (new line cook, not enough reduction) and offered a refund.

The chef and owner sat me inside their new bar room in a beautiful sunny little spot, and waited on me personally throughout the entire meal. I'm sure it's pretty well known that the food is beyond delicious here. I had the French Onion Soup, Steak Tartare and an assortment of some amazing desserts, and everything was absolutely perfect. However what was perhaps even more admirable was the service. For someone who wasn't all that comfortable sitting by herself for a meal, it was made to be my best dining experience in New York to date.

5.0,12/18/2016,"We went to Paris last night without leaving New York...via La Sirène. What a treasure! We walked in without a reservation and were seated immediately. (This is not something I would recommend as the restaurant became quite crowded later, but we were on the early side, just having left a Sunday matinee performance.) The cozy bistro atmosphere immediately brought about fond memories of trips to Paris. Our server, Jeane, was a jewel, too. After allowing us ample time to choose and discuss our food selections she expertly and patiently helped us with a delicious Bordeaux wine selection. Our first course arrived: beet salad with brie and delicate greens, classic onion soup, and pâté de campagne with Dijon and cornichons. The beet salad was prepared exactly the way I like it; I was able to taste the full flavor of the beets without having them overwhelmed by an excessive amount of dressing or unnecessary adornments. It was simple and delicious. The onion soup was without reproach, and the pâté, pure heaven. Our entrées were roasted Cornish game hens, roast duck, and cassoulet. The hens were succulent and moist and served in a rich broth with pearl onions. The duck was tender and delicious and presented with an intoxicatingly rich, dark reduction sauce. But it was the cassoulet that really transported us to France. It is an extremely rich and flavorful dish with duck, duck fat, sausage, bacon, and white beans in an unbelievably scrumptious broth. This dish alone is worth five stars. Dessert was a beautifully prepared tarte Tatin served with a scoop vanilla ice cream. Even though one in our group felt it was too sweet, there was not a single crumb left on the plate!As I have already mentioned, the service, with many thanks to our very charming and intelligent server, Jeane, was impeccable and made even better by being completely friendly and without any pretensions. The ambiance at La Sirène is lovely for a quiet romantic dinner or invitingly quaint and comfortable for a party of friends.

It was Saturday night so there was no way we were getting in anywhere else at the last minute and we were celebrating a special occasion. Basically every group that walked in was also made to wait over an hour. Their thing is obviously to over book knowing people will have no choice.

4.0,11/28/2016,This lovely romantic French bistro in SoHo is tucked away among the townhouses in the calmer part of this neighborhood. The comfortable but quaint restaurant has seating in the front and in the back. Everything on the menu looked delicious but I settled for the braised rabbit and my friend got the fish. To start we did the watermelon feta salad. The salad was refreshing and summery with the saltiness of the feta. I'd have to say I love this dish and will have to make it during the summer months.  Now we all know French food is all about the sauce and the one that came with the rabbit was velvety smooth with a side of rice. While the portions weren't very big it was enough to ease my hunger. The fish was white flakey. The entrees came with side of vegetables that was also very good. We decided to splurge and get the dessert sampler. It is French so it couldn't be that big right?It wasn't but it was a perfect bit size morsel of goodness enough to satisfy the sweet.

I ordered a rare medium steak and it was cooked perfectly. The sauce was also savory. The French onion soup was also good. Very cheesy and the cognac in it strengthens the strong flavor of the soup. If you go before 6.30 pm, there's a 35 dollars set (too bad the filet mignon was not included). My brother got the French onion soup, duck steak and banana brûlée for the 35 dollars set. The banana brûlée was delicious. But the real winner is the apple tart. We were already full but we ordered a second one after tasting the first apple tart. The vanilla ice cream contrasts perfectly with the sweet and slightly sour warm apple tart. It was that good! Overall, if you want to enjoy some food porn and mouthgasm, come eat here and order French onion soup, filet mignon with fois gras and the apple tart. I'm sure its other dishes are great too so I hope to come back and explore more dishes!",0,0,0,Oranicha J.,"Union Square, San Francisco, CA",338,10,21

At last, with the help of the wonderful waiter, we made a few great choices! The roasted escargot was finger licking delicious. I used the bread to soak up ever bit and pieces of the butter and garlic sauce with no regrets. We also had the curry mussels, which I used to drench my bread in as well. Surprisingly, the curry flavor wasn't overwhelming and the diced apple created an interesting combination.For our entrees, we chose the Seafood linguini with White Wine Saffron Sauce and the Seared Filet Mignon Topped With Foie Gras. The quality of the ingredients and the flavors of all of the food was top notch.I was so full but my friend insisted on ordering dessert. We had the ""Big Profiteroles"", which was big enough to share. They were cream puffs filled with ice cream, surrounded by dark chocolate sauce, and topped with whipped cream. I really enjoyed the dessert since it wasn't overly sweet but I definitely ate too much food today in one sitting!The location is a bit out of the way for me but I will definitely make the extra effort to come back again to try the other items on the menu!",4,2,4,Connie T.,"New York, NY",281,129,308
4.0,11/16/2016,"KenScale: 8.0/10New York City has no shortage of French restaurants but it is surprisingly difficult to find a reliable, unfussy French bistro that cares more about the quality of food than the glitzy atmosphere. In SoHo, Balthazar has been the French bistro everyone knows about, swarming with tourists on a nightly basis, but my experience there this year in terms of food was quite mixed. If you are in SoHo or nearby area and want to explore the French bistro cuisine, I'll give you a hint: go to the western side of SoHo and step into this charming space with the sign ""La Sirène"" on the front. It has had a loyal following since opening almost 10 years ago, but for some reason it has also been hidden quite well under the radar. On a recent Saturday visit with my girlfriend, I had a lot to like about the food coming from the kitchen.The menu at La Sirène is a collection of simple bistro classics. You've probably seen a lot of these and eaten a lot of these already. For bistro food, however, it is not always easy to be successful in execution department, which thankfully this kitchen is doing well. Roasted escargots with butter and garlic sauce had the nice texture without overpowering richness. I haven't seen mussels steamed with curry before, and enjoyed the spicy kick instead of creamy sensation that brought something unique to the table. My girlfriend and I happily dipped the remaining bread to the curry. The best appetizer of the night, however, clearly belonged to baked goat cheese tart with shallots, truffles and grape. It was a sensational dish that my girlfriend couldn't stop raving about, with the silky smooth goat cheese (which I'm not even quite a fan of in the first place) working so beautifully in the tart form for elegant balance in flavor. Tournedos Rossini, a classic meat dish consisting of filet mignon topped with foie gras and red wine truffles sauce, was another winner, with the juicy, tender filet mignon really shining and the foie gras and truffles sauce adding a level of richness that added to the texture (although my girlfriend said she wished the sauce came out a little less heavy). For dessert, we chose and absolutely loved croquembouche au caramel, basically a stuffed choux (a pastry dough) filled with French vanilla cream topped with caramel and sliced toasted almond. It was pure decadence with the delightful mixture of vanilla cream and caramel crust.     Getting a reservation at La Sirène isn't too difficult, but the dining space quickly filled up so I would still recommend booking in advance. The restaurant takes only cash or AMEX credit card, so be aware. It has been long known for a BYOB place from Sunday through Thursday (although now they seem to charge small amounts for corkage fees); I will certainly go back during one of those days in the near future. I was a fan of the cozy, inviting dining space that seems perfect for an intimate date night or casual get together with a group of friends. If you're looking for a satisfying meal with soulful French bistro food, La Sirène is one of the viable options I would be glad to recommend.",5,0,2,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

The escargot was the best we have ever had. delectable. Next time we will get two orders. The soup was delicious full of onions and soaked bread. We ordered the rack of lamb and filet mignon with foie Gras . They also served us a dish of the freshest, wonderfully prepared vegetables. The rack of lamb was truly masterful, tender, flavorful. The filet mignon with foie gras, was rich, full of the best flavors and just truly perfect. My husband was so impressed as he is not one for desserts but when he saw and tried the profiteroles he finished the whole plate and that speaks volumes.

The server was very helpful in recommending wines and letting us taste them before ordering the bottle. We really appreciated that. For an appetizer, we had the grilled octopus salad. The octopus was amazing! It had the perfect taste, not overly grilled. The salad was amazing as well. It had lettuce, tomatoes and mushrooms. The mushrooms were a very nice addition. For my entree, I ordered the Cornish hen. It was delicious. It had a light curry flavor that was very nice. My boyfriend ordered the duck breast rare and omg it was delicious! It was cooked perfectly and had so much flavor. For the table, they gave us some vegetables to share. It included carrot purée, string beans, and butternut squash. They were absolutely delicious.

5.0,11/6/2016,"I was in the mood for French food, so my boyfriend made a reservation at La Sirene to celebrate our one year anniversary. We started off with two appetizers, the escargot and the goat cheese tart. The escargot came drenched in butter and garlic (the waiter came by to tell us to make sure to dip our bread into the sauce, which we happily obliged), but the real star, in my opinion, was the tart. Goat cheese happens to be my favorite, so I might be biased, but I would definitely come back for that tart. For entrees, we ordered the cassoulet and filet mignon with foie gras, which were accompanied by four complimentary veggie sides. The cassoulet was as rich as the menu forewarned and came piping hot. I am sadly prone to burning my tongue, so we started on the filet mignon first. Usually, when I order filet mignon at other restaurants, it comes charred and burnt, but La Sirene's came perfectly cooked. The foie gras also melded very nicely with the steak. Boyfriend said it was one of the best he's had also.Unfortunately, we were too full for dessert, so in retrospect, should probably have only gotten one entree (we ended up taking most of the cassoulet to go).

2.0,11/6/2016,"I went to some trouble to make a reservation for Valentine's Day.  This ended up being the lowpoint of the day.  The place is very small and for whatever reason, they decided we should be seated at the very back, in closest proximity and view to their restroom and garbage bins (in the kitchen).  This was a bit confusing as the place next door apparently has the same owner, and they were seating people that came for La Sirene there.  Finally, I asked to be seated next door like the others, and rather than apologetic words, we got a rather business-like, ""We'll check and see.""  Of course, once we were seated next door, we were placed near the door (it was freezing outside).  Again, while our situation was improved, my girlfriend was pretty unhappy, since clearly the people seated in better locations were basically walk-ins and I had gone to the trouble of making a reservation several weeks in advance.In any case, if the food or service had been great, it might have negated all that, but we felt the food was rather overhyped.  And the service was somewhat subpar for what I would expect from a respectable restaurant in the city.",1,1,0,Chan-Ho S.,"New York, NY",5,14,1

The food didn't necessarily astound us, but I imagine the food during non-restaurant week and perhaps dinner would be outstanding. As it was brunch, my friend and I ordered the pate and French onion soup, gnocchi and croque Monsieur, and had the same dessert of sorbet, banana brûlée, and some sort of cream puff.The good: the croque Monsieur, as recommended, was quite delicious even though I dislike ham. The side of French vegetables was appreciated-- they even gave us a refill! The French onion soup was pretty good too- although how do you mess up onion soup? The portions were large throughout- some restaurants skimp out on restaurant week, but not la sirene.The mediocre: Pate. Nothing special about this.The less-than-mediocre: The side salads- either I couldn't taste the dressing or they were just underdressed? And it was the same salad that came with appetizers and main course. The gnocci was a bit too heavy for a Sunday lunch- we ended up taking it home.

But it turns out to be very disappointed. The appetizers were ok. For the entree, two of us tried the steak(medium well). The meat was almost well done and not juicy at all. My friend also agree with me that the meat is like a chewable rock. The meat was even hard to cut with their steak knife. Although I can tell the flavor for the garlic sauce on top is good. But we were so disappointed about the steak.  We went there for dinner, so the place is packed. The waitress were really busy during dinner. So we don't want to complain about their serving speed, and the waitress were also friendly. The thing is,The server didn't serve the dessert in order, since several tables were waiting at the same time,when they got new dessert coming up, he usually just gave to the table close to the serving window. We almost wait there for nothing for about 30 minutes. They did give us the spoon for dessert 20 minutes before though. Since my friend needed to catch Path train at 9:50, we have to leave at 9:30.(we finished our entrees before 9) we were about to give up waiting for the dessert, just check and leave. Then the dessert came at 9:25. We can only spend less than 5minutes to stuff the dessert. I don't think even for restaurant week, $42 is cheap, you can easily find some other good restaurant for less price. People who can spend $42 will likely to come back in the future if they have good experiences here. My friend has recommended the snail dish and seafood from this restaurant to me before, but now I dare not to come back for those. I hope that the restaurant can keep their during restaurant and maybe have only as many people as they can handle. I have to mention, the banana brûlée is great but we don't even have time to enjoy it.",0,0,0,Shuyu H.,"Flushing, NY",4,4,7
4.0,7/29/2016,"Came here for restaurant week today, been wanting to come here for the longest!  Got seated right away in a nice room inside the back. Atmosphere is very romantic, cozy, jus like the little French cafes and bistros in Paris. I do get an authentic, local, and Parisian feel for this place. Definitely not commercialized or catering to tourists- which is what I like  (although I believe tourists do come here) Now onto the food: the mini Raviolis are outta this world!!! Best pasta I've ever had probably- so chewy, cheesy, creamy and flavorful with the truffle. Brilliantly portioned and minisized in order to not get stuffed and have room for main course. Although I would totally use the bread to sop up all the sauce!! Both the rabbit is tender and the steak is delicious. The dessert sampling of all 3 kinds is awesome- again, brilliantly portioned to not feel stuffed or get heartburn after the heavy meal lol  love the free side veggies! Customer service is also good esp from our waiter and server. Only reason I took out 1 star is because when we first called in to ask if there's available for 2, hostess said no but we found open reservations and availability online right away and walked in. Also, when we came in to get seated, we asked if we can sit at the corner 2 ppl seats and she said its reserved for 4 ppl but a few minutes later, a couple came in and sat in the 2 seats. She looked embarrassed and apologized to us for lying but it was quite unpleasant to be disappointed by the same person on 2 consecutive issues. But of course, this has nothing to do with the food, overall service, and experience- which was all excellent. Highly recommend this place and will come back again with other ppl.",0,0,0,Stella L.,"Manhattan, NY",139,4,0
4.0,7/28/2016,"A wonderful little surprise, right near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel.  My wife, younger daughter and I were looking for a more ""upscale"" dining experience and my wife stumbled across La Sirene in her travels across the internet...so glad she did!Knowing that this spot was BYOB, we headed to a small wine shop just up the street and picked up a nice bottle to accompany our meal.  Upon arrival, the server was gracious and accommodating and took to chilling the wine immediately.Bread soon arrived, and we dipped away (in the olive oil provided) as we studied the menu.  As usual, my wife and I chose to sample several dishes (and share) while my daughter wanted something a bit more ""comforting"" and went for their version of mac-n-cheese.My daughter's gnocchi and cheese was creamy and pillowy...just what she was looking for and it filled her right up.For us, we started with a green salad containing fresh fruit, flowers and a light Vinaigrette dressing...delicious!  Both of us are big fans of Escargot, so we just had to give their version a try.  The snails a traditional French preparation (in shell) with butter, garlic and parsley.  Could not pass up a little ""dip"" with our remaining crusty bread so as to enjoy the remaining garlic butter sauce!  Lastly, we sampled the goat cheese tart served with shallots, truffles, grape and aged Swiss.  The dish was so rich and decadent, a great finish to our meal. A really cute little intimate restaurant serving some great dishes out of that kitchen.  We even got a table side visit from the chef towards the end of our meal, so glad he stopped by to see us!  Thanks for a wonderful evening.",2,0,0,Evan F.,"Strongsville, OH",182,606,1989
4.0,7/28/2016,"I came here for summer restaurant week 2016. The servers and hostess were very welcoming; we were seated immediately. For my appetizer, I had the Ravioles de Royan. They were DELICIOUS! I could have eaten a whole plate of them. Tip: save some bread to dip in the cream. For dinner, I had the Cornish hen. It was presented beautifully and tasted good. We were also served side vegetables for two which consisted of potatoes, butternut squash, green beans, and a carrot purée. All lovely.For dessert, we had the house's dessert plate: banana brûlée, profiterole, and fruits frais chantilly. They were all good, but the banana brûlée was definitely the highlight! All in all, I enjoyed my dinner very much. The restaurant is narrow, which makes it feel very cramped.

4.0,7/22/2016,"I've had my eye on this restaurant for awhile and since it was French restaurant week I decided to check it out. However much alike to the native New Yorker, I understand the scam in restaurant week menus and decided to opt for a la carte. We went for these dishes below: -Escargot - While I am a fan of softer escargot that is on the more buttery side, this dish was a bit different from what I expected. I did like the flavor but a part of me felt like this looked better than it tasted-Ravioli with truffle oil - this dish was tiny! However, it was still packed with creaminess and the truffle oil made it pretty tasty. I enjoyed dipping my bread into the leftover cream sauce-Cassoulet -beans, Garlic Duck Confit, Slab Bacon & Pork sausage- I really liked this dish. I shared it with a friend and it was the perfect portioning. The beans were really flavorful and the topping was crispy. The duck tasted like chicken, but I am guessing it was because of the way it was cooked. -Profiteroles - I love this dessert. If nothing else, I would just get this by myself here and eat it if I am down and my day would be instantaneously better. It was covered in dark chocolate sauce and the large creme puffs were just wonderful. Would definitely come back to try other dishes.",0,0,0,Shushu C.,"Los Angeles, CA",307,462,409

The atmosphere is cozy, low key, and fairly quiet, so its easy to have a conversation.We shared three appetizers: Escargot, beet salad, and tiny ravioli in a creme sauce (described on menu as ""sensuous""!), and all were perfectly prepared and beautifully presented.  Two of us had the fish special, a sea bass fuket, which was delicious -- seared beautifully on the outside and tender on the inside; the others had gnocchi and a seafood liguine, both were perfect.  We will back again and again...",0,0,0,C.

I like the warmth of the wood tables and dark walls.  I'd give another star if the acoustics were a little better.  At the table next to us were two couples who were pretty loud, which it made it difficult to hear at our table.  In truth they weren't that loud but the acoustics are so bad in the restaurant -- there is nothing to muffle sound at all -- that they sounded like shrieking drunks in a brawl.  So the missing star is about the noise.  It is a really delightful, special place though and I'd definitely go back.",0,0,0,wendy r.,"Stamford, CT",0,4,0
5.0,6/14/2016,"I was looking for a low key non-hyped French restaurant with great food to have a birthday dinner. Yelped it, saw the delicious drool-worthy food and we booked it! La Sirene serves up excellent French food with Parisian flair. The waiters and hostess were fluent in French and very knowledgeable about their wine.They were very accommodating when our party of 4 expanded to a party of 6. And the Open Table booking was seamless to use.We ordered their famous escargots, seared foie gras, seafood linguini, tournedos rossini (filet mignon topped with foie gras), rabbit stew, duck breast, and hanger steak. We picked out two wines: one Rose and one red. The Barbanau Rose from Cotes de Provence was a light fruity Rose. Great with the escargots. Probably delicious if we ordered the baby octopus. The Pinot Noir, Henri 2011 was a light acidic-sweet red that was great with the filet mignon. The apps were amazing! Butter, garlic, and parsley stuffed in medium size escargots. This was savory and perfectly cooked! I wanted bigger snails after cooking but the snails were tender and soaking in buttery garlic. So good! K took bread and sopped up the leftover sauce. The seared foie gras was buttery rich and tender. The reduced wine sauce was the perfect sour-sweetness to cut into all the delicious fatty foie gras. K's tournedos Rossini dish was much better than my tender seafood linguini. The linguini was topped with plenty of fresh scallops, shrimp, mussels and clams. But I was in the mood for foie gras. That buttery cool foie gras melted on top of the seared buttery soft filet mignon. Heaven in a bite! K shared but I wish I had ordered my own!I certainly could not finish my seafood linguini after all the foie gras. Thankfully, K helped me out! I really wanted to order the Winter Warrior's dish but I was so glad that I didn't! I have to come back! To try everything else on the menu! Love it!",13,5,10,Doreen L.,"Queens, NY",1214,1020,7030

5.0,6/1/2016,"La Sirene is as delicious as its Yelp star rating is impressive! French food is often inflated and bougey in New York City. It's hard to eat it on anything other than a white tablecloth in a dimly lit restaurant. But La Sirene is different. Its modest interior and charmingly conversational menu is--in my opinion, refreshing. The escargot is good--it might very well be from a can, but it still manages to be delicious and comparable to the escargot I've had in France. So much can be said about a restaurant by its bread--they had to refill ours three times. Needless to say, very fresh bread. We order the torissimo, which is their signature dish--a disk of pate atop a steak with au jus. SO FRENCH--but it was delightful. I would recommend this for anyone who is a fan of pate. I am not, so I wouldn't say it converted me, but I can see the appeal of this dish. I had the seafood linguine, which in my opinion--was the better dish. the seafood was VERY fresh, and the pasta was delicious.For dessert, we had the banana pudding brûlée, which was light and delicious! Though the menu isn't the CHEAPEST meal around, it attests to the quality of the food, and not just for bougey flare.

He kept the exact same tip amount that included the $30 bottle we did not order, which meant the tip was also overcharged by 20% of the $30+NYC taxes. When I asked him to fix this, he came back five minutes later and threw the entire amount in cash back in our face.

This is by far the worst service I have experienced in NYC.When I tried to have a polite conversation with a member of our service staff about the concerns we had (I.e. We did not see our server after she initially took our order, we poured all of our own wine and even had to chase down service for glasses, we were without water for most of the evening, no one checked on how our entrees were - my filet was overdone -, we had no appetizer share plates, none of our courses came with clean silverware, we had to request someone take a coffee order after our dessert had already arrived and been devoured - yum -, etc etc), the somewhat aggressive response was that it was a tip pool, therefore no single server was responsible for the quality of our service.Oh. Well then that excuses everything? P.S. Every tip share I have ever heard of still assigns a point server. I also counted at least five servers on, a number which I have seen attend a dining room double the size at a higher $/head.

This is a cute little place and I'm assuming it gets very packed here but we came on a Thursday night at 1030pm and the place was pretty much to ourselves. Good service and good food. The truffles ravioli appetizer is amazeballs! We were all licking the escargot plates since it was THAT good. A few people had the steak and they all approved.

Oh my god, definitely the best escargot I have tried in the city! It carried a light garlic flavor that mixed perfectly well with the better; however not at all greasy. Both of us opted for the duck breast as main dish - amazing! The cherry sauce and soy sauce made a perfect combo; and not to mention how tender the duck meat...my suggestion here is to go with medium rare, as they tended to overcook a little bit.Will for sure revisit, given their prex-fixe also made my mouth watery!

4.0,3/27/2016,"We were looking for a last minute reservation for dinner. Most places in the area weren't taking reservations, so we took a gamble. It's a bit tucked away hiding behind one of the horrid trump buildings. The decor isn't fancy at all, including the unfinished paneled wall, which I couldn't but help notice, even still, the place was inviting and warm. We were seated quickly and service was prompt. Everyone on staff we encountered was friendly and helpful. The pate and octopus salad were our appetizers and they both were excellent. Lots of delicious little tendrils to savor! For my main dish I had the rack of lamb. It was nicely sliced and a good sized portion. The sides came out for both of us on a single long rectangle plate with 4 different sides. I was very much amused by this, it was a unique presentation. There was just enough food for us, not too little, not too much. Overall, La Sirene exceeded our expectation with only two minor drawbacks. The one strange thing was that they had an excellent wine list and some spirits were available, but only from a limited list, as before or after meal drink. The didn't have simple things like gin or vodka which I found a bit odd considering they had a license to serve alcohol. And one last thing, don't take your Visa or Master Card, they only take Amex.  I've seen this but again, I think it's weird because it's 2016, just suck it up and pay the fee. Anyway.... I started the this review with 4 stars and then when I got to the part about the ""weird things"" I was going to remove a star but the food itself and service were great, I decided it warrants 4 stars which is my highest rating.

5.0,3/21/2016,"One of my favorite restaurants.Always start with the escargot with butter and garlic. Very standard recipe, but executed with perfection. Butter penetrates the meat and chunks of garlic with herbs delivers the extra flavorful hit. Also get the moules rochelaises (Mussels with curry) since ordering it with red or white wine is easy to do anywhere else. The curry is very subtle, the taste is first and foremost seafood then the slight curry and citrus of the apple round it out. The foie gras is some version that's cold, not my thing, still prefer it hot. Pate is also pretty standard pate that I can get elsewhere, but I enjoy the little pickles and tidbits that come with it. Really delicious. Tried the hanger steak and rack of lamb. Both were cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, and presented beautifully. However I feel like you can get equally as great rack of lambs and hanger steaks else where in the city. For all intents and purposes they were seriously awesome dishes that should be described more, however I feel like the standout dish and my regular go to entrée at La Sirene is the kassulet toulousain de la maison. Pretty much a casserole of thick cut bacon, duck, sausages, the starchy veggies all braised in duck fat. Oh so fattening but packed with so much flavor. The best are the starchy veggies I mentioned soaking up all of the fat. I mean all of it. Only have tried the chocolate cake fondue thing for dessert. Supper moist and soft. Very rich and sweet, so steer clear if you're into non-sweet desserts. Use to be totally byob, but now it's only on certain days plus corkage fee. Order a ton of food and they don't charge a corkage fee, at least in my experience.",1,1,1,Leo C.,"Forest Hills, NY",219,304,1491
5.0,3/20/2016,"My fiancé and I have loved going to La Sirene for special occasions and holidays for years. The food is always impeccable and the charming staff and owner always make the dining experience enjoyable.  We found out recently that they are available to host private luncheons, so we inquired with the owner if we could host our engagement party there. The owner was so wonderful to answer all of our detailed questions during the planning of the event, and he made sure that every detail was taken care of for our party.  He wrote up a custom menu with our favorite dishes - pork tenderloin with morels, duck with cherry sauce, rabbit, and pollock.   The staff executed the event seamlessly, and were friendly and accommodating of all of our guests.  Everyone had such a great time, and a month later we are still hearing from friends and family how wonderful the food was (especially the goat cheese tart, pork, rabbit, and duck!)

French style, French waiter and French menu, which isn't that easy to find in the city actually. My wife and I ordered our usual French favorites - french onion soup, escargot, mussels and beef tartare. I would give beef tartar a ""good, but not great"" because I really think it could use a bit more flavor, maybe drop a quail egg on top of it or something..and the rest were all ""excellent"", especially the mussels and the soup.Everybody, any restaurant can make those two dishes, but I bet you can't find many in NYC that does it better than La Sirene. The soup was super hot (you'd be surprised how many others bring over the soup in room temperature), very flavorful, cheese was awesome and the croutons were just perfect. The signature mussels was one of the freshest I've had in a long time, they were tender and crisp, and I loved the curry/apple combo, just hands down awesomeness.

1.0,3/3/2016,"My boyfriend and I were excited to dine at La Sirene for Valentine's Day, but we left disappointed and extremely frustrated by the abhorrent level of service. The evening started out well. Our reservation was around 8 pm and we were seated quickly upon arrival. I started the 4-course meal with a light salad and a rich, goat cheese tart with truffles and melted swiss cheese on top which came highly recommended in other Yelp reviews and was quite good. If the evening had ended here, I would have left a happy customer.Unfortunately, the first fifteen minutes were not representative of the rest of the experience. After the arrival of the 2nd course, we waited nearly two hours for the 3rd course to arrive. It was as if we fell off of the map. At some point, a waiter came and took our water away as if we had finished our meal and they were expecting us to leave. About an hour and a half into the wait, I asked the waiter how much longer it would take for the entree to arrive. He estimated five more minutes. Our food was eventually served to us about half an hour later--over two hours after we had first been seated. I had the Toulousian Cassoulet (recommended by other Yelpers) but found it under-flavored and unremarkable. The course also arrived with a selection of under-seasoned green beans and mashed vegetables. If the evening had ended there, I would have blamed myself for making a poor choice of restaurant and cut my losses. Unfortunately, we still had another course to go and waited another 45 minutes before the dessert arrived. In total, we were stuck waiting in the restaurant for nearly 3 hours for the four courses to be served. It was a painful and frustrating experience to sit and watch the other couples around us be seated, served their meals, and settled their checks before we had received our entree. Someone clearly screwed up, but no one took ownership of the problem or even acknowledged the absurd wait time.The crowning moment was that after my boyfriend paid for the meal (in cash, they don't accept credit cards other than AMEX), the owner came over for what I thought was going to be an apology for the experience. Instead, he wanted to know if my boyfriend was going to leave a tip. We were so flabbergasted by this complete shamelessness that my boyfriend simply shook his head in frustration and we left.That was the moment I decided to leave this review. ==============BOTTOM LINE: Spend your money elsewhere. I expect that our experience was especially egregious, but based on the other reviews, poor service is a regular occurence at La Sirene. A much better experience (in both food and service) can be had for a better price at many other restaurants around the city. PRICE: 4-course Valentine's Day prix fixe of $169 for 2 (base price)FOOD: 3/5 SERVICE: 1/5Other notes: if for some reason you still decide to support this establishment after reading this, note that they don't accept credit cards other than AMEX",5,0,0,T.

4.0,2/17/2016,"Came here for Valentine's Day dinner and the size of restaurant threw us off a bit. Upon arriving we were greeted by the coat check who asked us which restaurant we were going to. We were very confused because he had a thick accent and we didn't know there were two restaurants so he repeated the name of each restaurant at least 5 times but he was very patient with our confusion. When we finally told him la sirène he pointed us to the door.As we got inside the restaurant we were shocked at how small it was. All the tables were full of couples sitting literally next to each other. We had a reservation for 11pm but we arrived half an hr early. The hostess told us to wait a bit because they were full and had 1030 reservations to prepare for. The owner (I assume) saw an empty table in front of us and told the hostess to seat us and as they were debating it their 1030 reservation just arrived. We told them we had no problem waiting in the car but they gave us a table by the door to sit and look at the menu while we waited for another table to open up. Once we sat, the owner came over and offered to help check our coats. In a small place like this coat check was definitely needed. We sat for no more than 10 minutes before we were moved to another table towards the inside. The seating was so tight that the table needed to be pulled out before I could sit inside on the booth. This meant I was not able to use the bathroom unless we moved the table out again but luckily I didn't need the bathroom until the two tables next to us left. Anyways on to the food.. Our salads came pretty quickly. I'm not much of vegetable person so this wasn't something that I enjoyed but it was decent. For the 2nd course we got the escargot and goat cheese tart. The escargot was delicious as expected. The goat cheese tart was a little too strong for our liking. But I am someone who likes to mix things so I dipped some of the free bread we got into my escargot sauce and ate it with the goat cheese tart and it turned out to be a very good combination. We finished both and waited for our entrees. We ordered the seafood linguine and signature filet mignon. The seafood linguine was amazing. There were mussels, scallops, shrimp, octopus, and fish on top a deliciously sauced linguine. I really enjoyed this dish. As for the filet mignon I was expecting better. We asked for it medium rare but it came more on the medium side. We didn't complain because as a restaurantur I know how hectic a kitchen can get on a busy night. So the meat was a bit dry but the sauce that it came with made up for it. It was good but it wasn't great. The side of vegetables that came with the food was interesting. As I mentioned before I'm not much a vegetable person but I really enjoyed the carrot purée (I think that's what it was). We finished all of that and left the other 3 almost untouched. And finally DESSERT.. We were already pretty full but I always have room for dessert! When I read banana brûlée I was very eager to try it and it did not disappointed. One was thicker than the other but I ate both of them because my date didn't really enjoy his. He enjoyed the profiteroles and ate both of ours as I just picked at the delicious ice cream in the middle. The sorbet wasn't bad but it was our least favorite so we left it half eaten. Overall great service and a delicious dinner. We would definitely come back for more escargot and to try other stuff on their regular menu since they gave us a 10$ coupon for our next visit.",1,1,1,Elisa L.,"Manhattan, NY",118,27,1035
4.0,2/16/2016,"I came here for restaurant week this year hoping for something really special, and it was almost that. We came on a Sunday for the lunch menu. They were out of the mussels which was my first choice, so I went with the Cornish hen. The other person ordered the Mac and cheese. Our appetizers of the French onion soup was delicious. It comes with some cheese toast on the side instead of cheese on the soup, but maybe that's more authentic. The entree for me was a little disappointing. I actually laughed when they brought it out because it was so small. There was barely any meat. But the Mac and cheese had a healthy portion, so that helped to fill me up.I really like that they give you a few tastings for desserts. None of those would be things I would pick off a menu, but they actually were pretty good.This is a good place for a fancy French meal, but without restaurant week prices, it definitely wouldn't be worth the splurge for me.",0,0,0,Marleigh S.,"New York, NY",11,168,29

2.0,2/15/2016,"My fiance,  who generally does not make dinner reservations, chose this place for our Valentine's Day dinner based on its outstanding Yelp reviews and knowing that I absolutely love French cuisine. We ordered from the Valentine's Day prefix menu, which consisted of four courses, first course a mixed green salad in a truffle and garlic dressing, second course, a selection of appetizers, third course a selection of entrees, which included two of their signatures dishes, Kassoulet Touloussain de la Maison and Tournedos Rossini, and finally dessert, which was an assortment of house desserts, profiterole with chocolate sauce, banana brule and raspberry sorbet. For appetizer I ordered the escargots and my fiance ordered the baked goat cheese tart, both of which were outstanding, unfortunately, everything was downhill from there on. First, let me say that this restaurant was completely understaffed for  Valentine's Day. The restaurant must have approximately 20 tables and they had two waiters! We waited about 15 mins before someone came to our table to take drink orders.  Our waiter was in such a hurry that he brought us our second course, without ever bringing the first course, the mixed green salad in truffle and garlic dressing, which by the way was pretty bland and underwhelming. I could not taste the truffle and garlic dressing whatsoever. They also forgot to bring us bread, which we finally got after I asked for it. The Tournedos Rossini, seared filet mignon topped with foie gras was good,  but not outstanding. It was actually a bit on the bland side. It could have benefited from a little salt and pepper. Unfortunately, the restaurant was so understaffed, that no one took time out to ask us whether we wanted fresh pepper on our  filet mignon. The desert  was good. In conclusion, judging from how delicious our appetizers were, I can see how this restaurant has garnered such outstanding reviews, unfortunately this did not translate to the rest of our meal and the service was truly lacking.  We spent close to $300 last night and for that kind of money I  really expect better service and  better food.

It's weird that they only accept AMEX for credit cards (they accept cash too), but luckily I had the card, or else it would've been pretty inconvenient. I ordered the French onion soup for my appetizer and it was pretty good; I probably would have preferred a little more bread to soup ratio, because the soup was a little heavy on salt (bread would've been the perfect solution!).

The Classic mussels is always good.  We soaked up the sauce with the great bread.  Now for the entrees.  The Hanger steak was our favorite.  Quite flavorful.  I thought it was better than the  filet mignon I had.  The filet mignon was a bit too salty tonight.  The fish was fresh and perfectly prepared.  We each had a different favorite for the desserts so all good!  In the end we were very happy with our dinner.  I'm not sure about the problems at the start of restaurant week but bravo to the chef and staff for a great dinner tonight.  Keep up the good work.  We will be back.",0,0,0,Nikki C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,0

They seated us wherever we wanted (we chose close to the window, which they cracked open a bit to let in air) in the second room which had close access to the kitchen so food came out readily prepared. At the ring of a bell, the waiter/waitress would deliver it to us. The food was delicious. We both had French onion soup which had a bit of bread with cheese that was toasted and dipped in the soup. Plenty of onions in the soup, all caramelized and scrumptious. They provided as much bread as we needed, even giving us a second basket to dip on olive oil. The inside is really soft and outside was chewy. For entree, I got pollock bc they didn't have mussels on the day we went and my friend got the steak tartare. Despite tartare being raw beef, my friend shared some with me and we both loved it. It's like eating steak but it was really juicy and the texture was chewy but tender like the raw center of steak. What really made the dish was the seasoning, which was savory with herbs and spices (I think?). They gave us a center dish to share which consisted of two different kinds of squash, sliced potato, and carrot purée. My friend said she wished she could make her carrots in the same way. For my dish, the pollock was very juicy if a little bit tough on the exterior but the center was very tender and melt-in-your-mouth texture. The best part was the chef came to introduce himself. He said he made the pollock with less pepper to cater to ""American"" tastes but there was a ring of pepper around the outside of the plate which I could add as I pleased. I think it's great chef is always looking for ways to improve the dish and cater to people's tastes. It came with a little twist of lemon and a (mushroom?) sauce that the chef asked if I wanted extra. For dessert, we both got all 3 served to us on a plate. So we had all 3 each. It was banana brûlée which was a creme brûlée with banana pieces inside all baked and creamy with torched sugar glaze on top like you'd typically  on creme brulees, raspberry sherbert, and a gourmet creme puff that you can tell was hand/home made and not commercial at all. It was like a cream sandwich with puff pastry around. See pictures for all descriptions. All in all, a highly satisfying restaurant week experience. Lunch was delicious, everyone was super friendly, chef introduced himself, very memorable and happy experience despite the rainy day.",0,0,0,Shana J.,"New York, NY",123,46,42
2.0,1/31/2016,"Went for lunch today with my friend. We chose from the Restaurant Week menu and it was a BIG disappointment. I had regular dinner there last year and was very very good. I had french onion soup and hanger steak and they were very authentic. But today's lunch, my friend and I both chose french onion soup, mussels and 1/2 cornish hen. French onion soup was not the same onion soup I had when I ordered from the regular menu. Today's soup was just onion water. Mussels were tasteless and 1/2 cornish hen was a joke. Dessert was decent.If you can not offer the same quality of food during restaurant week, please do not participate. How could you serve unacceptable French Onion Soup and low quality food to your customers from the Restaurant Week Menu? I know you are a much better French Restaurant than what I had experienced today. I spoke with one of the waitresses and possible the owner about the onion water but they did not care. La Sirene was one of my favorite restaurants but not anymore after today's lunch.",0,0,0,Tsui T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0
3.0,1/31/2016,"La Sirene, I really expected better from you. Based on other reviews/reputation, it seems you clearly know how to create authentic French food. So the fact you actively chose not to do so on the Restaurant Week menu is incredibly disappointing.Came in on a weeknight with a friend who'd been raving about it for weeks.We were seated fairly immediately for 7:30pm reservations. The restaurant itself is adorable; small, candlelit and warm, this is definitely a cute date spot. The couple next to us was dining on what looked to be an incredibly cheesy and delicious French onion soup and the beet and brie salad. Since those items were on the Restaurant Week menu, we decided to start with them. Well, clearly that couple had not ordered off the Restaurant Week menu because their appetizers were nothing near what was served to us. My friend's French onion soup had no cheese or bread inside; none baked into the soup, none on the rim. Seriously, none! All that maybe resembled a true French onion soup was the small piece of bread with a smear of melted cheese on the SIDE of the plate. When you look closely at the Restaurant Week menu, it does say the bread and cheese are on the side. But why? How is this okay? My salad was just as absurd; while the Restaurant Week menu, like the regular menu, lists this salad with brie, there was not a single piece of cheese in my salad.Now, I understand Restaurant Week is a deal for customers and thus a bit hard on a restaurant's bottom line. However, it is absolutely unacceptable to leave out ingredients and serve a French onion soup without cheese just because of costs. If those dishes are too expensive to prepare, don't list them on the Restaurant Week menu at all.Onto the entrees. We ordered the Wild Alaskan Pollock in a brandy peppercorn sauce and the pan seared hanger steak. This time, all ingredients were present, but my fish left much to be desired. It was overly peppered -- to the point where the ground black peppercorns actually burned the back of my throat. There is a difference between flavorful and sneeze-worthy fish. This fish unfortunately fell under the latter category. The only thing that saved it was the fact that it was well-cooked.My friend's steak was the far better entree. This cut was really well-prepared; the seasoning was spot on and the steak was perfectly medium rare and juicy. For Restaurant Week dessert, you get a plate of three mini desserts. While the banana pudding and profiteroles were tasty, the apple cake was too dense and dry.Overall, I'm truly disappointed. Looking around La Sirene at the other diners' tables and hearing my friends prior experience here tells me this restaurant is capable of good things. But consistently is key. And La Sirene has failed to provide it.",1,0,0,Shannon G.,"Brooklyn, NY",213,311,69

5.0,1/27/2016,"I finally had the pleasure of trying La Sirene tonight! I've had La Sirene bookmarked on Yelp for over a year now and haven't had the chance to visit. When I noticed that La Sirene was taking part of Restaurant Week, I knew this was the perfect opportunity to try it out. When walking in you can tell that this restaurant had a warm/cozy vibe. The decor is very warm and inviting. It almost felt like I was actually inside a restaurant in France. For the restaurant week menu, so many of the appetizers stood out to me. I decided to go with the french onion soup as that is one of my favorite soups. I loved it! It was very different than some other french onion soups I've had, but it was delicious. I loved that there was a piece of bread with melted cheese that came with the soup. I also tried a bite of my friends ravioli that was offered on the Restaurant Week appetizer menu. It was also excellent! For the main course I ordered the hanger steak as did the two friends I was dining with. We all ordered the steak cooked differently and they were all cooked perfectly! I loved the steak and also really enjoyed the vegetables that were brought for the table to share. In particular, I really enjoyed the cauliflower and the pureed carrots. The desserts were my favorite! For the Restaurant Week menu, each person was brought a sampler plate of three desserts. It came with Banana Brûlée, a Profiterole, and a dense type of banana cake. Each one was tastier than the next, but I do have to say the Banana Brûlée was perfection. It reminded me of a fancier banana pudding. I really loved it and wish I could've had some more! The Restaurant Week menu was the perfect amount of food and everything was excellent. I saw many tables in the restaurant having the fondue, which is something I definitely need to come back and try. It looked amazing. I'm so glad I finally had the chance to visit La Sirene and I can't wait to come back again soon!",2,1,1,Alexa S.,"New York, NY",770,194,206

4.0,1/25/2016,"** Restaurant Week 2016 Review ** La Sirene is another one of those long-time bookmarked restaurants on my list. When my coworker suggested Restaurant Week Lunch at La Sirene, I quickly hopped on OpenTable to reserve us a spot.When we arrived at 12:30PM for our reservation, the restaurant was packed. Almost all the tables were full. We were seated in a table-for-two and given menus to look over. We took this time to sneakily look at our neighbor's dishes to help us make our final decisions - we're both visual eaters.Since it was so cold outside and neither of the salads looked appealing (too cold to eat something cold!), we both opted for the French Onion Soup with roasted bread with Swiss au gratin. It's a different take on your typical French onion soup since the cheese was on the bread instead of the soup. The soup itself was excellent and tasted great soaked up with the bread. I just wish there was more cheese!I opted for the Gnocchis A la Parisienne, or gnocchi in a truffle white sauce with Swiss au gratin. It's basically a French mac and cheese with Swiss cheese and truffle sauce. When the dish was served, it was still bubbling - so definitely be careful! It's super hot! The gnocchi was really good - they were soft and pillowy. It really hit the spot on such a cold day.My coworker had the Steak Tartare, which they grind themselves in-house. I had a few bites of it and enjoyed it. It was perfectly spiced and flavored. Highly recommended if you're in the mood for a good steak tartare!For dessert, La Sirene served up a mini selection of their house desserts - Banana Brulee, Choux Chantilly, and sherbet of the day. My favorite of the bunch was the Choux Chantilly, which was a light choux puff pastry with whipped cream. The puff pastry was soft with a bit of a crunch and the whipped cream was light and airy. The Banana Brulee was interesting take on a classic crème brulee, using banana pudding instead.There were two waiters in my section and they seemed a bit frazzled. I don't know if they numbered the tables wrong or what, but the table next to us got all three-courses wrong. Several other tables also received late or wrong orders - we almost got two rounds of dessert! Perhaps we had just caught them on an off day? Regardless, the food was solid and I'd definitely come back if I'm in the mood for some delicious French.",5,2,3,Michelle T.,"New York, NY",367,1165,1125
5.0,1/24/2016,"Came here for restaurant week. It was definitely the best decision ever. We were running late so we called and he was so thankful we let them know. When we got there we were seated right away and they took our coats for us. For the meal, my first course I got the ravioli because on the menu it said rare find. I'm so glad I did!!!! Literally melted in my mouth and I could taste all the flavors and the truffle kick was amazing!! Main course my friend and I shared the pork tenderloin and hanger steak. There was a slight mishap and he thought I said pollock instead of pork but the waiter corrected it right away and brought my pork in a timely manner. The hanger steak was another mouth-gasm. Perfectly flavored and cooked right. The pork was also so tender and the sauce on it was amazing as well as the morsels. We were also served vegetables on the side and my favorite out of that was the purée thing. Then we got our dessert and omg was that amazing as well. The banana creme brûlée was so bananey, it tasted so good. The ice cream portifello was amazing! The chocolate sauce on it melted in my mouth. My only advice for the future would be to change the apple pound cake. Overall, so glad I came here for restaurant week! Definitely a must come!!!

4.0,1/23/2016,"Came here during restaurant week. It was PACKED as HELL (we sat between two couples and it was very loud and uncomfortable). Food was awesome but the way they cooked the Foie Gras wasn't the way I liked it, it's got a very bitter taste to it. It's cold duck liver if your wondering what it is....pretty nasty tasting without the sweet filling.Got the hanger steak, best tasting steak ever but I felt that it wasn't filling enough. The gf got the chicken and that was good with more portion.So as I said before, you are literally cramped on the tables and it's like your literally sitting next together with other people. The couple on our right the guy was so annoying and kept talking about nerdy stuff. Now what pissed me off was the couple on our left. On this particular night, there were a lot of asians in the restaurant. My gf and I are also asian and we noticed this too. That's fine, whatever. Until the RACIST couple on our left starting talking racist crap. The white woman on our left said ""There's way too many asians in here."", then the white man said ""Yea, I felt like I'm in China or Japan."".It's fine to keep these opinions to yourself, I get it - everyone is racist in some way shape or form but I got pissed because I heard those remarks and because I am asian myself.

3.0,1/21/2016,"Firstly, I was ecstatic to learn that La Sirene was part of NYC restaurant week's repertoire. I've heard/read nothing but rave reviews about this establishment. My boyfriend and I arrived 15 minutes prior to our reservation time, and was immediately and so graciously seated upon arrival by the adorably charming owner(?). Okay, so everything was peachy AT FIRST. We got our complimentary bread, which is always a plus (nothing special, okay bread and literally just plain oil for dipping) Then our appetizers arrived. My man ordered the foie gras and I ordered the ravioles de royans. Both were decent. The ravioles I ordered wasn't a stand-out dish, though it was presented in a cute little cast iron pot. In terms of overall flavor, I couldn't really complain about cheesy pasta (but again, nothing special). Smooth sailing, right? After 30 minutes of waiting for our main course we were getting a bit antsy. But, we refrained from complaining to our waitress because it was a pretty busy night. AFTER ANOTHER 25 minutes (55 minutes in total) our waitress approaches our table to apologize for the wait and informs us that the kitchen was ""backed-up"". I mean, I guess. 15 minutes after that (an hour and 10 minutes in total), we finally received our main courses. By this point my boyfriend and I were justifiably irritated and the waitress didn't seem too apologetic. I understand the kitchen can get busy especially during Restaurant Week, but the fact that our waitress waited so long before informing us about this issue was unacceptable. As for the food, I had the rabbit and my boyfriend had the steak. My dish was really cold, as if it was sitting on the countertop for a while. Everything on my plate was the same temperature, and pretty off-putting. My overall experience with this dish was anticlimactic, considering I've heard so many positive reviews on the rabbit. The side dish (meant to be shared) consisting of roasted veggies was tastier than my main course.The desserts arrived so much quicker than everything else, and to my chagrin the best part of the entire experience.

The patrons around us were also there for the restaurant week menu, but some ladies decided to order some bottles of wine to accompany their meals.I got the house foie gras which was ok. The apple compote/smear/puree overpowered it a bit, but it was sweet and I like sweet.I wanted steak, but I figured I should try the braised rabbit since it was a bit different. If you can handle gamier meat, you'll find this to be pretty good. The rabbit leg sat in a sauce that was pretty good, and with a tiny scoop of white rice, the dish turns into saucy goodness. They also gave a medley of tasty veggies for us to share at the table.I also wanted a red with my rabbit so I got a glass of the House Bordeaux, which I'd define as the quintessential, solid food/wine pairing for $9.The dessert was 3 part: a banana creme brulee, an ice cream with dark chocolate fudge, and a bread-like thing (sorry, too lazy to look up what that last one was). I finished everything except the creme brulee, because the banana taste was a bit off putting.

The entrées alone come in five different types of meat - chicken, pork, beef, fish and rabbit. Each diner also gets all three desserts on the menu - very generous.The Foie Gras was absolutely among the best I've had - buttery, firm, flavorful and not too fat at all - temperature was controlled delicately at a level that cements the flavor just right but also melts instantly on the tongue. Raviolis were also top-notch - the cream/truffles sauce that they are drenched in naturally complement the cheese and the garlic.Braised Rabbit and Pork Tenderloin were both tender, layered and well portioned. Though in hindsight, we would also have liked to try out the steak. All three desserts were wonderful, with the Profiterolle really standing out as some of the best ice cream with melted dark chocolate out there.I loved this restaurant for its taste and decor. From interior design to music selection to the staff, everything and everyone exudes the French essence - laissez faire, class and sophistication without trying too hard.

The soup was very flavorful and not too salty. The escargots were also very good. However, a plate of 6 was hardly enough to satisfy our appetite. If you want something more filling, I recommend you try something else as an appetizer. But if you want to try authentic French escargots then you should definitely get it. They really reminded me of my time in Paris. For the entree we had the duck breast and rack of lamb. We had both made medium and it came out just as we asked. The duck was tender and the sauce was great. I had to ask for more bread to finish the sauce. There was also a nice crispiness to the skin. The lamb was also wonderful and came with 5 chops. While we were eating our entrees, the chef came out to ask us how we were doing. He was very nice and explained to us some of the components of the dish. The entrees came with a polenta cake and a side of 4 vegetables (string beans, pumpkin, sweet potatoes, and some kind of root vegetable). For dessert, we had the banana brûlée and chocolate lava cake. The brûlée was very good. One of the best desserts I've had in a while. The brûlée had bananas and crushed wafers layered inside and a bite of it was a perfect combination of textures and taste. I was worried of getting the lava cake because most places I've been to use a very sweet chocolate syrup. I think the chocolate here was dark chocolate so the sweetness was just right for me.

The host (and I presume owner) was very friendly and pleasant.I think the food, cassoulet and tournedos, were quite good. I would give them 4 stars. But the menu was consistently a little too heavy. The desert was also quite good and the service was pleasant, if a little bit rushed (one of the servers start removing one of our first course plates and about the half the food was still on it).I was also disappointed that I couldn't order a cocktail. It was explained to me that La Sirene is not yet set up to do that. I would have preferred giving this experience 3.5 stars, but Yelp doesn't allow that.",0,0,0,Eric G.,"New York, NY",18,30,0

The decoration is elegant and classy and I like the mosaics on the walls. We ordered escargots, tornados Rossini and the rack of lambs with Pinot Grigio. The escargots are tender and yummy. I love use the garlic sauce remaining on the plate as bread ""butter"". It's just so tasteful. The Rossini is fabulous. Especially the foie gras, so tender and a little bit cold inside makes the taste rich and smooth. The steak itself, however, is not of the best that I have had.

5.0,12/25/2015,"La Sirene has the ambiance of a fancy restaurant in a 90s sitcom establishing shot. And not having a gimmick other than 'nice French place' seems unpretentious nowadays (they don't only serve snails, they aren't rooftop farm to table.) Though the tight seating and explanatory menu intro can be a bit of an interesting gimmick.My friend wanted to satisfy his WASPy longing for chops and bottled wine on his birthday and we did this triumphantly at La Sirene.We were served an excellent bottle of red wine to go with our meat and I began to over-order greedily. The escargot were the best I've had, large, tender, and with a crusty garlic sauce I later sopped up with bread.The ravioli dish, served in a tiny le creuset pot, were bite sized raviolis smothered in delicious cheese.My friend said his lamb chops were the tenderest he had. I enjoyed the subtle rabbit stew. These also came with a delicious vegetable side, I particularly enjoyed the carrot puree. I ordered us...some...desserts because I don't care. My friend loved the lava cake the servers graciously stuck a candle in. I thought the coconut ice cream particularly worked.We both also liked the brulee and profiteroles.

4.0,12/23/2015,"La Sirene means ""mermaid"" in French. A very unassuming place, serving up very decent French food. Last week, I was in the area with some friends and after looking at various places on OpenTable, we ultimately decided on having dinner here. Oh, the paradox of choice. If you're not paying attention, you will miss the entrance to this restaurant, their location is very close to the Holland Tunnel. I've passed by on several occasions, always curious about the place. Service was attentive here. Timely and not obtrusive. For appetizers, we shared the roasted escargot with butter and garlic sauce. Definitely on point here, well executed and not chewy. I highly recommend this dish. The seared pollock with mixed peppercorn and brandy sauce was a bit of a letdown. But then again, pollock isn't the liveliest fish, so I guess I would have to be the one to blame for choosing this dish. Originally, I was interested in the moules, however, the owner is a bit quirky and doesn't serve it with frites, so I passed on this option. My friends enjoyed their meat dishes, I believe it was hangar steak and filet mignon. For dessert, we shared the profiterole, but I am not much a fan of profiterole, so it was just okay for me. And for a dinner with 3 people including 3 glasses of wine, 2 appetizers, 3 entrees, and a desert and w/ a generous tip, the final total came to $200. A very decent place at the bottom of the Island for solid French food with a mature crowd and ambiance.

No fries with moules???? Do not accept Visa/Mastercard??? C'est la vie. There are worse things in life. Being in the company of great people and great food makes it all worth it.I had my first experience here with escargot. I first thought of ""Pretty Woman"" when they came out with the distinct utensils used for capturing those slippery litter suckers. There was so much butter and garlic I could have been eating god knows what and it would have been delicious. The other folks at the table have had escargot before and said that the snails here were way better than their prior experience, so I consider our choice a win. They were tender, not chewy and by the second one, easier to eat. We also ordered the pate which was just ok. And the bread was just ok for a french restaurant.My filet mignon with foie gras was the bomb. I loved the velvety texture of the foie gras with the buttery soft medium rare steak. It was a good portion of foie gras so every bite of my steak was accompanied with the duck liver. Amazing!!! The sauce was like the icing on the cake.

When my boyfriend and I arrived (a little late for our reservation) we were told that there was a tiny wait. Normally I would have been slightly annoyed - but the hostess and the ambiance at La Sirene just makes you feel like it's no big deal. This is what happens in Europe after all! The hostess served us complimentary wine while we waited which was wonderful! She was so kind and checked in on us constantly. When we finally were seated, they brought over a complimentary appetizer to apologize for the wait. So lovely. We then ordered. First was the escargot. La Sirene was the first place I ever tried these and will likely be the last. They are drenched in garlic, butter and herbs and it's so divine. If you don't like escargot, try them here and your life will be changed forever. Next was the filet with foie gras and truffles. I mean - the ingredients themselves speak for this dish. Rich, decadent, perfect. This restaurant is one of my favorites in NYC and I highly highly recommend. Perfect for a date night, and I've also been with my family.

4.0,11/22/2015,"I came here for my birthday dinner and the food was excellent as always. However, a note: the reservation system and overall customer service is a  bit lacking. It was really difficult to get a reservation with all these restrictions on the number of guests as well as what my overall menu of food would be. While it turned out to not matter when I actually got there, it was just a bit stressful to deal with prior to coming. Onto the food: Escargot: Delicious. Can't be missed. Escargot is always fun to eat and this place makes delicious escargot. Not too salty at all! Goat cheese tart: It was ok at best, I would say I was not the biggest fan but it was tasty nevertheless.Seared Foie Gras: MUST GET. Delicious. This was reason #1  that I was so insistent about coming here to eat. Entrees: Filet Mignon topped with Foie Gras: THE main reason why I came to this restaurant. It is deliciously cooked - the texture of the steak ( quite nicely done, not dry at all and very flavorful which is what you want in a steak) along with the creamy texture of the foie gras go together amazingly well. It is a bit indulgent, but well worth it. I don't see a reason not to chose this dish. There was a sauce that came with this, but the steak and the foie gras was so amazing on its own, the additional sauce it came with was unnecessary. Well cooked steak never needs anything if it is done properly, and this place knows how to cook their steak properly.  Chocolate Lava Cake: Great topper and a great way to end my meal. Really nice! I was a bit sad that on Fridays and Saturdays, BYOB is not allowed. However, their menu makes no stipulations; only when making phone reservations do they say we could not BYOB. A tad difficult. Their wine selection is ok, but a bit lacking on the wine-by-the-glass. The service part: The hostess was absolutely lovely. I had been in contact with this restaurant for a few weeks for having a group reservation and each person on the phone gave me quite a difficult time as well as no real answer about what I could or could not order. I was disappointed in their customer service prior to arriving. However, upon arriving, it was a different story. I wish I knew her name, but the hostess was a wonderful energetic woman who made sure we were well taken care of. Our waitress seemed a bit inexperienced and got one of our orders wrong, so we, as a group, waited until everyone had all of their food until we proceeded to eat - most of us ate our entrees cold because of the wrong order. It was ok and certainly I can understand the mix up, but it did put a slight damper to the quality of our food. I have been to this restaurant before and actually my brother had his large party dinner here too a few years back. Back then, I remember we were so well taken care of that I vowed to come back for my own birthday. However, based on the service, I'm a little iffy about that.

The lady was nice and she reminded me that they only took American Express or cold hard cash. They were packed, even around 9:30 pm. They don't rush you which I highly appreciate. The menu continues to be very detailed. There are so many appetizers! My date ordered the wrong wine bottle, but the waiter was cordial about it and gave us the bottle that I wanted. (I'm sorry that happened) The Petit Sirene (second on the red bottle section), was great. We polished the bottle. Btw, I think BYOB is back, but with a $10 cork fee. For starters I got the escargot. It was pipping hot, buttery and to die for. The delicious smell took over the room and guests that were sitting nearby got seriously jealous - yesss. He had the mini ravioli, or as the menu describes it: ""Sensual Little French Ravioli Stuffed with Comte Cheese in Truffle Cream Sauce."" The presentation was lovely. He loved it. I had a bite. It was delicate and I approved, but honestly I was reaaaaally into my escargot.I had the rabbit stew and it was fantastic. Wow, it was so tender it was just falling off the bone. It came with the right amount of rice to soak up all the deliciousness. I must have that again! He had the fillet mignon topped with foie gras. I'm not the biggest fan of foie gras, but that was seriously goood. The entrees come with seasonal veggies and to my surprise chayote was one of them. It's not a common veggie in the US. I was forced to eat it as a child (yup, very common practice amongst Asian moms), but maybe that's what made a foodie out of me. I had to have dessert although I was beyond full. The table next to us was about to leave when we got there and they had some flambé dessert that made me a little jealous, but unfortunately I overlooked it when it was my turn for dessert. I had the choux and it was light, creamy and perfectly sweet. He had the dark chocolate lava cake and was beyond happy.I eat out a lot and this place really impressed me.

5.0,10/8/2015,"Easily one of the best meals I've ever had in NYC.For my final meal before switching coasts for college, my friend brought me to La Sirene to celebrate. Even after changing our reservation time twice, we were still greeted warmly and seated immediately. I liked how they gave us a bottle full of water and our glasses; it pays homage to the typical restaurant experience I had when I was in Paris. We decided to go for an appetizer first. We chose to get a half order of the mussels in the marinieres sauce, but it's worth mentioning that La Sirene has four other sauces to choose from. Even as a half order, it was enough for my friend and me. The mussels come out in a small pot with the herbs still in the broth, showing you just how much they pay attention to the flavor with their dishes. The mussels were perfectly cooked, and with the bread that came, we were able to taste the delicious broth even after they were all gone.Moving onto the entrees, I chose to get the duck while my friend got the filet mignon with foie gras. Having had several variations of duck, I have to say that La Sirene is near the top of the list. It came out exquisitely plated and well cooked to a pristine medium rare. Biting in, it was tender and no where near over or under cooked, and it paired well with the side of vegetables they gave for my friend and me to share. While I'm not a fan of foie gras, I got to try my friend's dish, too. The filet mignon was perfectly cooked as well, and along with the foie gras and sauce, it was an amazing bite. I could totally see myself eating it all the time, if I had the funds to do so.We were too full for dessert, but we were beyond pleased with the meal that we had.

3.0,9/27/2015,"Yelp rarely leads me astray but unfortunately this place did not live up to it's 4.5 rating. My boyfriend took me here on my birthday and after looking at the menu we thought everything looked great. This place is Byob with a $10 cork fee so we brought a red to go with fattier meat options like steak or duck. We started with the steak tartar and special appetizer, duck rillette. The tartar was mustardy and briney which I enjoyed and it wasn't as chunky as most. The rillette, however, was rather bland and also had bones which our server did not warn us about. So appetizers were decent but we thought this place would really shine with the entrees. I love rack of lamb and my mouth was watering when it arrived.  The rosemary and light citrus sauce were incredibly tasty but the dish was completely ruined by over cooked lamb! I asked for medium rare and it was medium well. This was heartbreaking. My boyfriend ordered the duck medium rare--another disappointment when it came out medium well. The lovely cherry sauce it came with was totally wasted on overcooked bird. Usually I'd send a dish back when it is so offensively over cooked but seeing that they were 0 for 2 I figured they couldn't deliver a properly cooked entree.If this place can get a chef who knows how to cook meat, it will be a knock out. I'm hopeful it was either an off night or they will turn it around soon.",1,0,0,Sara W.,"Murray Hill, Manhattan, NY",103,188,14

5.0,9/21/2015,"La Sirene has been bookmarked under my yelp favorites for a long time, but it wasn't until  a visit from my friend that we decided to make a trip to La Sirene. We had driven in to the city that day and conveniently found a spot right outside the restaurant. Free parking in the city is always a plus. The restaurant appeared small when u first enter, but it is actually made up of 4 separate rooms. We were seated in the furthest section/room from the front door. This was the section where tables had electrical burners for those who wanted a taste of their fondue menu. Their wine list was good,  had the basics that one would need at a French restaurant. But if you're here looking for a phone book size wine menu, this is not the place. To make up for it, however the place is BYOB ($10 corkage fee), a point that i missed when reading the reviews. I had the Foie Gros and filet mignon. I requested it to be cooked medium rare and indeed it came out just the way i had wanted it. The foie gras was paired nicely on top and the plate was decadent. I must admit however, that the dish did become a bit too rich for my liking towards the last few bites, but i would order this over and over again.  My bf had the hanger steak, that too was made to perfection - medium rare, done the right way. No complaints there. My friend ordered the duck breast - medium rare, and it too was also made to perfection.  They served ""Complimentary"" vegetables, which were simple and delicious.My experience at La Sirene was more than what I had expected. I would highly recommend coming here for any occasion for a party of 4-6 ppl. The food was amazing and the menu truly reflected that of a French Bistro.

4.0,9/12/2015,"What an adorable place.  The vibe of La Sirene is so comforting and homey once you step in - we had a party of 8, so we got to sit near the back side of the dining area.  Staff were attentive and were helpful at getting our bottles opened up when we did the BYOB.  The menus I wasn't too fond of - too much text of weird descriptions - almost like reading an entire novel of the food (ain't nobody got time for that).  Appetizers: Foie Gras Au Torchon, Recette Maison The foie gras was absolutely out of this world. Perfectly cooked and it made my taste buds jump for joy !!! The sauce with the foie gras was amazing as well, I really wanted to drink it all up.  I dipped the bread in it haha.   Escargots à la Bourguignone The escargot was also super flavorful - with a real punch.  It was really hot to touch, so be careful you don't burn your fingers in trade of amazing taste!  Poires Roties au Bleu Fondant The pear + cheese dish tasted like the texture of a potato!! I've never had a pear like that yummy!!Entree: was actually why this review wasn't a full 5 stars - my duck confit was really only mediocre - I was saddened that my potatoes were almost tasting like home fries (those diner styles) It really wasn't the "" Diced Apple Sautéed Potatoes"".  Nothing much to say about this one  -- I wish I ordered the Seared Filet Mignon Topped With Foie Gras it looked sooo good.. *DroolSome of the sides that we got, were really delicious - especially there was one like a squash mashed -- and the green beans yum!!! Fresh and home-made tasting.  Desserts: Tarte Tatin (flammable) was definitely the show-stopping dessert, but it was not as delicious as the Banana Brulée which was one of my fav desserts of the night.  Lava cake was good too.  The most unique one was Iles Flotantes au Caramel et Anglaise Parfumee au Grand-Marnier - The texture was like eating a cloud.  Not to sure about that one.  Choux Chantilly  was also only ok, because I'm not much of a puff pastry person.Our waiter was also nice enough to take 3 photos of our group for us :)  Thank you for the delightful night and delicious food!!",1,0,0,Pinky C.,"New York, NY",525,490,1155

Also for the appetizers we got the French onion soup and goat cheese tart. AMAZING. Both were fantastical! The french onion soup was done ""well done"" meaning the cheese was browned on top - love it like that. The tart was so tasty too with raisins and cinnamon. We got the Duck and the Flank Steak - the duck was unbelievable. Just enough sweetness, not chewy at all, and the sauce was devine. For just stumbling upon this place, it was a win.

5.0,8/28/2015,"I was completely blown away by this place. Not necessarily because the food was as fantastic as the service, but because a) I had no idea this place even existed and it's the most unassuming little restaurant on the end of a residential block, and b) it manages to produce traditional(esque) French cuisine without being boring.Someone took me here recently for my birthday, and it was really just... so great. The ravioli were so flavorful (they were labeled ""sensuous"" on the menu, I think, probably because you want to do horrible things to them once you taste them), the hangar steak was so tender and juicy, the pork was flavorful and cooked perfectly, and that chocolate lava cake... Let me tell you something about chocolate lava cakes. NO ONE knows how to do it properly. La Sirene does.

5.0,7/7/2015,"The menu at Sirene offers a wide variety of French delicacies and new ways of preparing traditional fare in a more modern flavor. La Sirene offers an extensive wine list, while also welcomes guests to BYOB (one bottle of wine per couple for a $10 corkage fee). You can enjoy your favorite wine alongside a very impressive meal! The sautéed baby octopus appetizer sounded amazing on paper, and was even better in conception! It was served warm with a very good amount of octopus pieces that were cooked and seasoned perfectly. This dish had so many mushrooms in it, that perhaps for most people could be overboard, but I loved it! Since my fiancee, who is allergic to mushrooms was not there,  this was my opportune time to enjoy in a colossal amount of mushrooms. The sauce that this dish sat in was nice and light and full of the garlic flavor. I definitely soaked it all up at the end with bread. If I didn't have bread, I may have considered drinking it!The escargot was served in the shell on a plate with butter and garlic. I can't remember the last time I had escargot in the shell, versus served in the pool of garlic and butter sauce that is standard at most restaurants. I hate to say it, I kind of prefer it without the shells, but  I did not dislike this dish. I love sauce, dips, and garlic, so the other way is more to my liking! The rest of my friends at the table did prefer it served this way with the shell, and liked that the snail was not overly covered in garlic sauce and that you could taste the snail's flavor more. I guess everyone has their preference!The mussels served Creoles style were amazing! These mussels had the most unique flavor of any mussels I have had, and were packed with flavor. The sauce tasted like a dream and had all senses of sweet, spicy, savory, and creamy. The sausage pieces that were served with the mussels were an extremely welcome surprise and were very plentiful. The appetizer portion was very large and my friend could not finish it all! She had to ask for a lot of help from me, which I gladly gave :)The Seared Filet Mignon topped with Foie Gras was by far my favorite dish at the table, and luckily was mine :) The foie gras was extremely creamy and rich and probably one of the best foie gras that I have had! The combination of the foie gras with the steak and the red wine truffle sauce was so divine and heavenly! I had never seen this type of combination before on a menu, and it was exceptional. On top of the foie gras sat a piece of black truffle, which was a nice surprise to this dish and made this dish a home run in every category! The only negative I could mention is that it was a tad bit overcooked, and could have been served a little more pink in the center, but otherwise exceptional!The rack of lamb was cooked perfectly and very tender. The meat was seasoned perfectly and served over a white wine rosemary truffle sauce, which was nice and light and perfect for dipping! The portion of this dish was very good, and perhaps a great one to share around the table!I only had one bite of the cassoulet, but from what I could tell, it was hearty and full of flavor. I loved the crunchy top coating, which kind of reminded me of macaroni and cheese in texture. The bacon and pork sausage were a nice addition to this dish and added so much savory delciousness! This is definitely a man's kind of meal (on a cold winter night) because of the size and heaviness, but definitely delicious!We received two long plates of vegetables for the table to share, that accompany every dish. The assortment on these platters was nice and also healthy. There was one vegetable I am unsure of what it was, but it was tasty. The other vegetables were squash, green beans, and pureed carrot. I appreciated how these were displayed, almost as if it was a vegetable tasting menu!Dessert in a French restaurant cannot be missed since the French definitely know their pastries and their chocolate! I had to order the Dark Lava chocolate cake because that is always my favorite dessert on every menu! This one was one of the best I have ever had because of its richness, airiness, and also its decadent fudgey center! The coconut sherbet that was served alongside this added some freshness to the plate since the rest of the dessert was warm and rich! The whipped cream side was amazing and light and was definitely made in house!",1,0,1,Carlen M.,"Manhattan, NY",370,97,473

And we got a few things.The Foie with the Filet Mignon was just too luxurious, in a good way! Although I thought the Foie would have been seared at least, rather than putting it on top like a pat of butter (maybe searing it would make the dish too rich?).  The Rabbit stew was pretty well made! Very tasty, and lots of thyme.  The meat was tender, which is pretty hard to do with Rabbit, since it's just a tough piece of meat.  Lots of thyme flavor.  Just wish there was more rice... but that's probably just the Chinese in me.Someone else from our party got the rack of lamb - medium rare. I didn't get to try and of it, but from what he said it was great!MUSSELS are a MUST here! We got the Creole style ones.  The manager(or seemed to be?) came over and asked how we liked it! He said it was his new recipe.  I wish we had gotten a larger size... Also wish they served more bread with it, because I just wanted to mop up all that sauce.Service was mediocre unfortunately.  They did a good job with like traditional service such as wiping down the table after each course; however, our server seemed rushed, even though the place wasn't packed.

2.0,6/8/2015,"2.5 stars.I had not paid a visit to this place in 3 years, and boy, what a change... for the worse. They got less attentive to the quality of their dishes, and rather greedy. 1) All dishes were unreasonably much pricier than they used to be. I know, 3 years is a long time, but this time we were not impressed with their dishes, and paid considerably more. Not a gd combo. 2) Now they charge a $10 corkage fee per bottle (it used to be free).3) 1 dish of sides per 2 people (it used to be unlimited).Nonetheless, I was excited to give it another try. I was very happy with them the first time I came, and had high expectations. My partner ordered the hanger steak, which was underwhelming. It was barely warm, and much more rare than she expected. It was tender, but it just didn't taste flavorful. I guess a lot had to do with the temperature of the meat. I got the filet mignon with foie gras, and wasn't that impressed either. Again, the meat wasn't as hot as it should have been, which is crucial for such dish (steak and filet mignon get cold by the minute, so if they come already not hot, you can only enjoy the first couple of bites). The truffle was tasteless. The sides were very plain... they had very little flavor. We didn't get any appetizer of dessert (thank God), and promptly asked for the check. It's sad that a place we thoroughly enjoyed a while ago for the quality of their dishes has lost its magic, but considering 1) the uninspiring food and 2) how much they charge for it, we have no reason to go back.",5,1,1,Giacomo C.,"New York, NY",1774,1258,2821

Then !!  we chose on Tarte Tatin for dessert - but with the extra choice of having it ""Flambe!""  now...you ...(the reader) don't seem to understand ...This is ... ABOUT AS CLOSE TO ORGASM AS YOU CAN GET !(without including physical sex ...  of course...)The apples on the tarte tatin are SOOOoo macerated and the tarte is barely a layer on the bottom, on top there is a ball of delicious ice cream and THEN !They pour and light a light syrup of (I'm not sure) armagnac - or cognac !It glows blue and white for quite a few seconds ... and then you taste it.WoW !!!Anyway...to make a short story longer...We shared a very tiny bottle of Chandon brut champagne,and after dinner I had a double espresso with a sniter of kirsch.We were not disappointed ....(UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE YEAR !!! )   LoL !!!Thank you Didier !!  Vous etes un ""Leonardo Da Vinci"" en cuisine.",0,0,0,Roger L.,"New York, NY",0,31,44

5.0,5/29/2015,"What's more diddy than P-Diddy? Didier:I guess I should say WHO is more diddy than P-Diddy. Okay you're probably confused...Didier is the owner, chef and manager of three excellent NYC French restaurants. I've written a rave review of Le Village from a previous press meal, and now I'm writing one for La Sirene, the popular classical French joint on Broome Street, just east of Varick at the lower edge of Soho.Anyway, Didier is an intense, animated guy who is really passionate about his food. Everything he serves is of superior quality and taste, and made right there in-house. After eating at two of his restaurants, I can safely say that there is nothing that the man can't execute with flawless precision. Every app, entree and dessert I've tasted has ranged from far above average to excellent, with one or two ""best I've ever had"" things in there as well.Didier focuses his energy on classic French dishes, made from family recipes that he has been honing for upwards of 30 years. Some of these dishes are so labor intensive that you wonder how the hell he could be cranking them out seven days a week. Even some of the sauces take days to prepare, all from scratch - from roasted bone stock, reduced with wine, and distilled into just a few ounces of absolute heaven in a bowl.Other French places I have been to will have something like coq au vin or cassoulet on the menu, yet every time you go in and ask for it, they are somehow not able to make it for you. They're ""out"" of cassoulet. And other French joints only serve those crazy, impossible dishes one day a week. ""Monday Dinner Special: Coq au Vin."" Not served any other day of the week. This is not the case at La Sirene. Didier cranks these fucks out like a machine, and they are all amazing, and available every damn day for hundreds of diners. That is quite impressive, to say the least.So let's get right down to business, shall we?La Sirene recently acquired a liquor license (it used to be solely BYOB), so we started with some Spanish wine: Temperanillo (red) and Airen (white). Both were smooth, but I tend to gravitate toward red in general.The table bread is all made in-house, and is a rustic farmhouse style with a crusty outside and a soft, fluffy, absorbent inside that's excellent for dipping into the sauces that come with the mussels.While I got to taste a little bit of everything that each of the five press diners ate, I will try to just focus on the items that my wife and I ordered - really because I ate more of those items than the others.First was the sauteed baby octopus. This was simply tossed with garlic, parsley, tomato, olive oil and mushrooms, and served warm on a bed of mixed greens. The 'pus was perfectly cooked. Nice and tender, with great flavors. Although one doesn't exactly associate this sort of dish with classic French cuisine (it sounds more Mediterranean / Greek-Italian), it was a definite crowd pleaser. Everyone liked it.My wife had the Creole mussels, which were served in a creamy tomato and chorizo broth with herbs. We liked this a whole lot better than the other mussel dish we tried, which was ""Rochelaises"" style, with curry and apples. The chorizo just goes so well with shellfish, and I was sopping up that amazing sauce with bread for a while after the mussels were fully devoured.When in France, do as the French do: Eat snails. These little shits were so damned tasty. Buttery, garlicky, herby and tender. I could easily put down three dozen of these like nothing. Didier's escargot is a must-try, and the best version of the dish that I've ever had.The entrees were spectacular. Until this meal, I had never tried cassoulet. I think I might have just spoiled myself with this first. My expectations and standards on future cassoulet meals are now way too high, thanks to Didier. It's like having a rib eye at Del Frisco's for the first steak of your life. While I have nothing to which to compare Didier's cassoulet, I can safely say that it is amazing. Behold, my new favorite French dish:It was so hearty and packed with flavor. So many different types of meat were happily co-mingling in this rustic dish. It was like a dream-come-true. Inside was a delicious potpourri of cannellini beans, carrots, tomatoes, garlic, duck confit, slab bacon and pork sausage, all braised with duck fat, white wine stock and foie gras jus. Come on... And on top was an array of homemade bread crumbs that were broiled to crispy perfection, so that every bite of this dish had texture versatility as well as flavor variety.It was difficult to pull myself away from that cassolet. It was my wife's dish. I, of course, had steak. At first I was conflicted: should I order the hanger steak, one of Didier's signature items, or the ""Tournedos Rossini,"" a signature filet mignon item? BOTH STEAK and BOTH SIGNATURE DISHES!

4.0,5/12/2015,"If it weren't for the strikingly urban landscape on display outside of the restaurant's large front windows, I would've thought I was enjoying a quiet dinner in a quaint bistro in southern France.*La Sirene doesn't boast highly pretentious, manicured French cooking but much more rustic fare. let you know they don't take themselves too too seriously---except with flavor.We started with steamed mussels in white wine, a deliciously simple dish with each juicy mussel leaving me wanting more. Yum. For my entree, I went with the Seared Rohan Duck Breast, topped with Sweet and Tart Michigan's Cherry Sauce. Again, it was deliciously simple and perfectly cooked. The richness of the cherry sauce paired well with the richness of the duck. Yum x2. Dinner came with a little shared vegetable platter of squash, chayote, celery, and pureed carrots. I'm pretty sure they offered us another platter because it came out a little late (I was on my last 3 slices of duck until I remembered veggies were on the way) but I was actually sufficiently full towards the end of our meal despite the notoriously French portion sizes and declined the 2nd helping (sacré bleu! I know).*Actually, the retro curly font in their menus and mix of Alanis Morissette and the Amelie soundtrack playing in the background may have also given the locale away.",1,0,1,Christina F.,"Brooklyn, NY",95,289,11

Corkage is now expensive so unless you're bringing a incredible bottle just get it there. Service was good but a bit weird in my opinion.

3.0,4/16/2015,"I really wanted to fall in love with this restaurant and had super high expectations after reading all the positive reviews on here, but unfortunately it just fell short. To start, my fiance and I waited for about 20 minutes past our reservation time for a table. Because the restaurant is so small, this waiting had to be done in one of those little winter enclosures outside the door and it was FREEZING. Once we were seated the service was good and the food was good, but nothing was totally outstanding and the portions were on the smaller side. And honestly, the space is just a little bit too claustrophobic for me. I know this is an issue at many Manhattan establishments, but there is a fine line between cozy and too close. I think that one of the reasons the reviews were so great for this restaurant is that it used to be totally BYOB. This is no longer the case, but you are welcome to BYO for a $20 corkage fee. It's a nice option but no longer the spectacular deal it once was. I think La Sirene is overall a solid restaurant, but if you come here expecting a mind blowing experience because of its 4.5 stars then you may be disappointed like I was.",0,0,0,Cynthia S.,"San Francisco, CA",32,209,0
5.0,4/9/2015,"We came here for Valentine's Day dinner, and it was a lovely, lovely meal.Before I say anything else, I have to warn you - bring cash!!!!! La Sirene is CASH ONLY!!Now, onto the experience:Even before we reached the doors of La Sirene, we could smell the buttery goodness inside. It made our mouths water and us supremely excited for the meal that was to come!Inside, the tables are close together, so be prepared to be pretty intimate with whomever is at the tables to your right and left. But the lights are dim, there was a good buzz of conversations, and the atmosphere was very cozy and mellow.Since we came for Valentine's Day dinner, there was a pre-determined menu.For appetizers, we got the Soupe A L'Oignon Gratinée and the Escargots À La Bourguignone. Both were fantastic, especially the escargots, IMO. For entrees, my date got the Kassulet Toulousain De La Maison (Signature), which was very rich and flavourful and filling. And I got the Magret De Canard Gras (Rohan) Montmorency. I have to say, I preferred the kassulet. The duck fat made my dish a bit hard to eat... probably not something that I would get again...

3.0,4/4/2015,"A larger group of us (6 people) came here for dinner the other day. It's a smaller place than any of us anticipated, but it's cute and has a nice ambiance.A few people ordered apps and seemed to be pleased with them. I tried my friend's escargot and it was actually pretty good and not as slimy as I thought it would be (I've never had it before). For an entree I ordered the Coq au Vin since I felt like a soup. It wasn't bad, but it was super salty. It came with 3 chicken legs, a boiled potato (literally a small whole potato) and some mushrooms and carrots mixed in. I'm glad they left the bread on the table so I could dunk it a bit in my stew. I suppose the chicken could have been a little more tender since it didn't all come off the bone as easily as I might have wanted. I did need to take my knife and cut away the meat from the bones. The potato could also have been a little softer, but I like my potatoes pretty mushy so that might just be a personal preference.4 people ordered the steak. I tried someone's butter only steak and it was pretty tasty though you could definitely taste the butter on it. Every 2 entrees also came with a side of vegetables that included a few pieces of cauliflower, butternut squash, string beans and sweet potato puree. They were pretty good, though we definitely could have used more between two people.For dessert we had the banana creme brulee which the menu said was the restaurant's version of banana bread pudding. It had a slight pudding consistency but don't think magnolia pudding in your head. It was tasty though and on the bottom there  was a hard pie-crust like piece?Not a bad spot and they let us sit there a while after we finished and we didn't feel rushed at all.

1.0,3/29/2015,"After having dinner here I almost think the other reviewers went to a totally different restaurant...My out of town friend wanted to eat French and I took him here because of the high ratings. We both got the early bird prix fixe: french onion soup, beet salad, coq au vin and rabbit. The french onion soup is so salty that my friend couldn't finish most of it. The beet salad was good but brie is definitely not the best cheese to put in a beet salad. My coq au vin was so dry and stringy that I wanted no more than a few bites. The boiled potato on top on the other hand was still tough and underdone. The dish came with a spoon but the broth was so salty that I joked to my friend that the chef used his French onion soup to braise my chicken.Granted, the side veggies were cooked very well. I was so intrigued by the carrot puree and so happy to eat chayote which is my favorite vegetable(fruit??) ever.My friend decided to pass on dessert. I got the sherbet and all three scoops tasted either artificial or overly sweet.I really wanted to like this place. Decor is casual and cozy. Service was good. The waitresses really cared about how we felt about the dishes and I feel awful that I just said I wasn't that hungry. I would definitely come back to try the other dishes due to the high ratings or go to Taureau which is right next door.

I wanted to give a a five-star, but there are some other things. For instance, the entrees are kind of pricy ($30+) and the dinning area is little bit crowded. The restaurant does not accept regular Visa and Master debit/credit car. Only cash and Amex cards are good, so I have to walk all the way to an ATM to withdraw some money.

4.0,3/25/2015,"I am a bit torn by La Sirene. My first visit a month ago was an amazing evening filled with some of the best home-style French food in the city and the most gracious and lovely service-- a 5 star experience through and through. My second visit last night was fine, but only just fine and not outstanding like my first visit-- a standard 3 star experience. I averaged the two and gave La Sirene a 4, but I wish I could have given it a 5.In general, we found the entrees to be much tastier than the appetizers at La Sirene. For appetizers, we ordered the Escargots a la Bourguignone which was just okay. It was too salty and the herb flavors didn't compliment the dish. The sauteed baby octopus was better, the octopus was quite tender and not tough to chew at all. For entrees, the seared duck breast was my favorite dish the first time around: the duck was seared perfectly and finished off in the oven and made my partner and I reminisce of the perfectly prepared duck breast we had in Paris. Dreaming about the duck breast, we visited La Sirene again to get another taste of perfection. Unfortunately, the second time I ordered the dish, the duck was just not as well executed. The skin was soggy and the duck wasn't the perfectly medium rare but actually under cooked. We also ordered the the filet mignon topped with foie gras which was an amazingly delicious sounding concept on paper. In actuality however, the dish failed in execution. The steak was overcooked and not seared in the right places.I am wondering why my two experiences were so different from each other. Could it be because the Chef wasn't in the house that night? I saw neither him nor his girlfriend who was the gracious waitress who served us the first time. Perhaps I will have to give La Sirene another try in the future when the Chef is in.

It had all the favorites like escargots, Fillet Mignon etc.. Here is an honest review from a genuine well wisher 1. I commend the restaurant owner on the ambience...vastly improved in every way2. Table service: we missed the personal touch. May be it was the waitress( we missed the one who waited our table back in 2009:). The waitress seemed impatient and frosty.3. I liked the escargot, it lacked in the savory dept... I cannot explain exactly what it is but it was a bit bitter. I remembered it to be more buttery and sweet with a hint of garlic.4. Our entrees were nicely done, it was better than the average but we have a very high expectation from the Chef at La Sirene. 5. The desserts were ordinary to say the least. I was surprised why this section was completely overlooked.4. They had a 4th part , which was salad. honestly there was nothing special or French about it.

The space is very cozy and unpretentious, and each table has a candle, which is always a nice touch.We started with the escargot appetizer - neither of us have had snails before, and thought the dish, coated in a garlic butter sauce, was yummy. For my main, I couldn't pass up on the incredible filet mignon with the fois gras pate. What an amazing, unique dish! I had my steak medium, and it was cooked perfectly, exactly as I wanted it - pink in the center, no blood. The blend of the pate, the meat, and the sauce was unlike anything I've ever tasted. I had eaten excellent steak in the past, but never one with so many different unique flavors. My girlfriend had the gnocchi, which resembled mac and cheese in looks, but tasted delicious.For our dessert, however, we chose to go to Laduree right down the street, which makes incredible macaroons. Dominique Ansel's bakery, famous for the cronut, amongst other inventions - is also around the corner.My only suggestion to the restaurant is this - we were served by at least 3 different waiters (basically, whoever seemed available,) which made ordering and asking for service a little confusing.

5.0,2/4/2015,"The Good, the bad, & the uglyOn a truly bitter cold night (comparable to Minneapolis, where I spend more time than I care to admit), I dined at La Sirene - able to get a reservation only because of the aforementioned bitter cold.  I want to thank the weather.The GoodSmall, cozy, but in no way cramped feeling.  We were made to feel welcome and valued, which can be more important than just good service.  I like to ask the server what is unique or special to the restaurant and if the list is too long (or too short), that is not a good sign.  The list here was perfect and we went with a couple of the recommendation.  Snails (not usually my favorite - grew up back east and we don't eat snails, we eradicate them) were delicious.  The owner/chef came by, probably because my lovely dinner companion was French (well, she still is, but I'm writing this review in mixed tenses) but he made me feel appreciated and special despite my monolingualism.  We discussed several dishes and he highly recommended the cassoulet, which is spelled with a K and several other letters that differ from the usual spelling because the dish is unique to La Sirene.  It comes in a large crock, brimming with all sorts of things from duck to beans to all the other usual ingredients, but let me say that on a cold winter's night, it was perfect.  I believe that on a hot, summer's eve it would also be delicious.  I strongly recommend it.  I will return and try other dishes, but this one stays with me.Acoustics (which matter when you want to hear the other person; which is why married couples often seek restaurants with bad sound design) were good and I could hear every word my companion spoke without having to strain out nearby conversations.The BadThinking hard to come up with something.  Can't.  Dang.The UglySee ""snails"" above.  Delicious, but...Overall, this is a French restaurant with an attitude, but the attitude is pleasant, warm, accommodating, and inviting.  I'll be back.",1,1,0,Steve W.,"Encino, CA",1,13,0

4.0,1/31/2015,"Check out my blog at deja-food.blogspot.com/2….I first came to know about this restaurant when my friend wanted to try it out all the way from Singapore. It wasn't too memorable for me but it left a very good impression with my friend that he insisted to try it again (twice in the same week) before he went back to Singapore. I decided to try again as Groupon was offering a deal $65 for $49 (more detail below).Anyway after much contemplation, we decided to get the same popular dishes that we tried before and oh boy, it was much better this time.Escargots à la BourguignoneRoasted Escargots  - $13.95(1/2 dozen in the Shell) with Butter and Garlic sauceAlthough I don't remember my past experience, the thought of eating escargots was mouth watering enough to tempt us in ordering it again. Indeed, it was a very enjoyable meal. After we were done, seeing that we still want to keep the plate because of the sauce (yes it was buttery good), the waiter offered us some breads which we gladly accepted. We completely wiped out the plate!Tournedos Rossini $36.Seared Filet Mignon Topped With Foie Gras (Pate Style), Shallots, Port and Red Wine Truffles Sauce. Long story short, the filet mignon was ok. It wasn't memorable. It was lukewarm either because (1) I took too long for pictures or (2) cause I saw they completed the dishes before we were done with the escargot (not sure if they attempt to keep it warm while waiting). On another note, the foie gras was really good. I preferred to eat it separately in order to maximize its flavor profile.Kassulet Toulousain de la Maison $32.50The menu describe the dish as follow: ""Cassoulet Toulouse's Style (Cannellini Beans, Carrots, Tomato, Garlic Duck Confit, Slab Bacon and Pork Sausage all Braised with Noble Duck fat, White Stock and Foie Gras Jus) This is a Very Rich Dish which was served for Warriors to defend their Village! Don't take it if you can't bear it.""Interesting caption to describe the dish. I do call myself food warrior, so I must try this dish again. Yes, it was indeed a rich dish cause of all the fat (oh glorious fat!). The dish consisted mainly of beans (70%) so you might have excessive bad gas (aka fart) once you are done. I was a little disappointed with the portion of the bacon as there were probably 2~3 slabs. It wasn't too sinfully fatty as what I hoped, which left me wanting more. The duck confit and sausage was nicely cooked and the crustiness of the top layer made the meal enjoyable, much better than my previous experience. We didn't finish the meal and brought it home. It seemed to taste much better the next day.Final cost of the meal is $85 (tax + tips included), a saving of $16. Next time, we might want to try the $35 three course prefix meal (only in certain time period and for non-signature dishes).Note about Groupon deal: The reservation process through Groupon was a little annoying as the restaurant decided to end the promotion earlier (we weren't informed) and they canceled most of our February reservations without reason. After talking with the owner, we managed to secure our reservation at the end of January. Else, we need to request Groupon for a refund.",1,0,0,Bevano L.,"Jersey City, NJ",86,106,263
5.0,1/18/2015,"My family and I went here on a Wednesday evening after searching online for NYC french restaurants and we are so glad we picked this restaurant. The food is phenomenal and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. It was quiet, the staff were attentive and the pace of the meal was relaxing and enjoyable. The menu has lots of good options from small salads and soups to hefty portions of meat and chicken. I was lucky enough to get a little taste of most of the dishes at the table, which were all good, but I will comment on the ones that stood out to me. For an appetizer, the Tartelette de Chèvre Frais aux Echalottes (baked goat cheese tart) was scrumptious and for anyone who likes goat cheese it is a must get. It was a good size and everyone at the table thought it was the best, though the escargot was a close second with its butter sauce. For a main course our table of four got two plates of vegetables, consisting of pureed carrots, cauliflower, fennel (we couldn't quite figure out what it was) and one that escapes me. These vegetables come with our meals and the two stand outs for me were the Rossini (if you like truffles/mushrooms you will love this) and the Kassulet Toulousain de la Maison. The Kassulet is marked as a signature and it is a lot, as the menu states, but it is one of the better dishes I have tried. The sauce/juices from the meat were absorbed by the beans and every bite of the dish was a treat. I loved it and so did everyone at the table. Even if the rest of the meal was poor which it wasn't at all I would come here solely for the Kassulet and be more than satisfied. We have been lucky enough to visit France and the rivals any dish you can get over there. I needed help to finish it because it was a lot, I wanted to have dessert, and I wanted the chef to see a spotless bowl since I loved it so much. We had to try dessert and had the warm chocolate cake, very good, and the profiteroles which were properly served with ice cream and a lovely chocolate sauce rather than cream and other variations. Get the profiteroles to share with another and you will both be happy. I cannot wait to come back here and this is probably my favorite french restaurant around. The food is spectacular! If I had to pick out a negative then I would probably have to pick out the rather expensive wine/beer selection. There were not many inexpensive options and a beer was quite expensive. If beer is going to be that expensive then maybe a craft beer or two on the menu would be nice, but I am being picky. In conclusion, this is a must visit for anyone that enjoys food. It will make someone like french food and for people that already do it will remind them why they love french food. I hope to be back soon and if you have any doubts on what to get after reading this or the menu then shame on you. The KASSULET! Of course I am sure everything else is good too. They also have a Fixed Price menu which looks good, but we were too late for this. Something to look into though and try sometime.",1,1,0,George S.,"San Francisco, CA",24,67,48

3.0,12/28/2014,"La Sirene is a casual French restaurant that shares a space with Taureau, a French fondue place. The ambiance is interesting, on the night we went we heard lots of classic rock (Doors, Beatles). The decor isn't really what you would expect from reading the menu either. We seemed to be served by no less than 4 different members of the waitstaff, which made ordering both easier and more difficult because we never knew who we were supposed to ask for things, so we asked everyone and everyone responded.The little French ravioli are alright, I'm not sure I'm too into comte cheese (it was my first time having it). It had a very light, sort of sweet flavor. I ordered the Kassulet Toulousain de la Maison ( Cannellini Beans, Carrots, Tomato, Garlic Duck Confit, Slab Bacon and Pork Sausage all Braised with Noble Duck fat, White Stock and Foie Gras Jus). Holy hell, the description that this dish is for warriors is spot on. This is super filling and rich. I wasn't a fan of the bacon, it was extremely tough and chewy. I was also expecting more of a stew-like dish from the description, but the dish is mostly beans. It's cooked in a casserole dish, and the top gets a crunchy crust, in some ways it's almost like a duck fat mac n cheese made with beans instead of macaroni. The duck meat was super tender and I focused on eating that and the sausage as the beans were just too much. My friends duck breast in cherry sauce was overcooked. They had a Belgian beer, Leffe, that was delicious and went really well with the Kassulet. While I left (very) full I can't say that I had a favorite dish.

The filet mignon itself wasn't quite filling enough, especially not for the price, so it missed the mark a bit. However the touch of foie gras and shallots did help bring the dish together.

5.0,12/4/2014,"Made reservations for three at La Sirene, no sweat.  Ran a bit late and called before my reservation to have it pushed back 10 minutes, not an issue.  Ran even later and had to call a second time to push back another ten minutes, no problem.  The staff were friendly and very accommodating to unexpected circumstances; almost makes me want to give them five stars for the service alone.  Good job to the wait staff and hostess for making the evening a pleasant one.  Now, onto the food.  We started the meal with the Escargots a la Bourguignone, Soupe a l'oignon Gratinee (French Onion Soup), and the Foie Gras Au Torchon.  The Escargot was drenched in buttery garlic sauce; needless to say it tasted delicious because of all that butter and garlic.  I felt it did over power the flavor of the snail itself, but still a thumbs-up dish to be eaten.  The French Onion Soup was prepared well with a good layer of cheese and an abundance of caramelized onions.  The Foie Gras was decadently flavored on its own.  The dish would've been memorable already just having the creamy Foir Gras on top of toasted bread, but the addition of the pear and jam really livened up the taste buds.  Every bite was a bit sweet but incredibly savory with a crunch.  For the main entree we ordered the Kassulet Toulousain de la Maison, Cotelette d'Agneau au jus de truffes (rack of lamb) and the Onglet Poele a la Luchonnaise (hanger steak).   First off, the Cotelette d'Agneau au jus de truffes (rack of lamb) was seasoned perfectly with rosemary and had no gaminess whatsoever.  The meat (ordered medium rare) was tender, red but not bloody, and well flavored that it can very well be one of the best lamb dishes I've had in the city.  The Onglet Poele a la Luchonnaise (hanger steak) was ordered medium rare.  It was a good steak, however the sauce really made the meat memorable.  The garlic and parsley sauce made it a different dish than a mere steak.  However the best of the three was the Kassulet Toulousain de la Maison.  A small casserole pot filled to the brim with cannellini beans, garlic duck confit, slab bacon and pork sausage all braised with duck fat, quail stock and Foie Gras jus.  Could you possibly fit anymore into such a pot?  The dish is on the heavier side and will be filling for anyone who decides to eat it.  The beans explode with flavor of the meats and their juices.  The quail stock with the duck fat enriches the dish but doesn't give off an oily taste.After the main entree I was full but my fellow diners were in the mood for some dessert so we decided to get the Big Profiteroles.  The plate was large enough to be shared between three people after the wonderful meal we just had.  Three large scoops of ice cream covered in bitter sweet chocolate.  A nice way to balance out the savory dinner at the end.  I am glad they accept AMEX now and not cash only.  Makes it easier to consider coming back the next time I have a hankering for French food.",2,0,0,Louis N.,"New York, NY",375,218,459

Where can you possibly find good French food that's BYOB in NYC? That was one of their major strong points. However, I came here with a few girlfriends the other night with several bottles of wine only to find out that it would cost us $20 per bottle...what a huge disappointment! As for the service, I feel like the current staff isn't friendly at all. There was only one table besides us in the whole restaurant at 6:30pm. The waiter was extremely rude to us when explaining the corkage fee. Also, throughout the meal there were no courtesy check-ins even though they walked by and looked at us several times. We were quite upset but the staff didn't seem to care.As for the food, I've tried:ESCARGOT--Roasted with butter, pesto and garlic sauce. This was very aromatic and flavorful. GOAT CHEESE TART--The goat cheese was on the heavier side. It tasted as if I was biting into a whole stick of cheese. Wished it had a better texture and was more balanced perhaps with a little less goat cheese and a crunchier tart. MUSSELS--Cooked in white wine & fresh herbs. Use the complimentary bread to soak up the left over sauce! I would skip on this appetizer since I found it more on the bland side.DUCK BREAST--Perfectly seared in a red wine sauce. This was really good all around. The sauce paired really well with the savory meat.FILET MIGNON--My medium-rare filet mignon was topped off with foie gras. The foie gras literally melted in my mouth, it was so good! The steak itself was juicy and tender, basically just cooked to perfection. The dish came with a side of red wine truffle sauce which was super savory when combined with the foie gras & the meat. This tasted absolutely amazing and was the highlight of my meal. Well executed dish, highly recommended! BANANA CREME BRULEE--Crispy, tasty, and filled with its sweet banana flavor. Great choice! Overall, great cozy French bistro with a dim/relaxed atmosphere.

5.0,11/17/2014,"I'm sure my review will be washed among, the many praises other's have mentioned.  This place is the real deal.  I've been searching for French food in the city since my trip to France.  Anyways I'm going to keep it brief, but I don't even remembering why I was venturing this far West side, but I might have told my date to find either a falafel place or French food and this was the clear winner. ""What..1000+ reviews?""  (Plus French food by default usually get's +1 point for a date than a food truck)It was a chilly summer Sunday night, and we stepped right in with a inside window seat.  I barely recall the meal, but I do remember the mussels were REALLY amazing and we had crepes to finish.  If you're still reading, and if I ever leave the east side, I have made a mental note to come back.  As for advice, the bowl/bucket of mussels I'd say a great sharing item for your date.  Prob 2nd-4th date type thing cause the sauce is so delish, you'd be slurping and stuffing the baguette in your soon to be plump belliestres bon!",1,0,0,Phil L.,"Queens, NY",31,22,0

Then they informed me La Sirene would no longer accept Groupons, including those that were already sold to customers.  Not the way to attract customers or build a following - and without even the courtesy to notify customers instead of just repeatedly canceling reservations.  The manner in which you guys do business is an absolute joke.",0,1,0,Rich K.,"Bayside, NY",2,2,0

You can instantly smell the goodness that is coming from the kitchen. The temperature of the dining area is a bit too hot to be comfortable and the restroom is too small (this is coming from someone who is 115lbs) Onto the food...The escargots plate is absolutely delicious. Plenty of garlic and butter. Save the bread for the sauce, not the plain olive oil they serve with the bread. We wanted the sautéed baby octopus but it was sold out (our dinner reservation was 7PM, seriously?) For the entrees, we ordered Coq au Vin (classic stew of chicken) and roasted quail. I had the Coq au Vin and it was blah. The red wine sauce just didn't have a lot of flavor in it. Chicken is blah. Somewhat disappointed because it is something I would make at home with a crockpot, definitely not a $26.75 plate. The roasted quail is really delicious. Skin is crunchy and the meat is very tender with close consistency of a duck. Not too shabby. There was a tray of 4 vegetables to share for a party of two. It is nothing more than a puree carrot, puree cauliflower, diced sautéed eggplants and something not good enough for me to remember. The puree stuff offered me a preview of what living in a nursing home might be like...just awful. Overall, the food is decent for a typical dinner with friends or take someone on a date.

4.0,10/15/2014,"La Sirene (Mermaid in French) or really expensive French restaurant that you only want to go to under a special occasion: Stephanie's Birthday is special enough. I like the cozy atmosphere. I like that its hidden away in Soho and non-descript. I like that it also merges with some kind of Bull Theme. Bulls and Mermaids? Sure. We split two different kinds of wines: I believe one of their Bordeauxs (not sure which one) and their Pinot Grigio, La Contessa 2012. Both bottles priced around $30 (not horrible) and pretty delicate tasting for the fine food we were to be presented with that night. The bread and olive oil and butter (after it was demanded ""WHERE IS THERE BUTTER?!"") (we like butter . . . . lots) were wonderful. Especially when you were starving and not your entire party had arrived yet. For an appetizer I had the Escargots à la Bourguignone in a butter and garlic sauce. I've only had escargot about three times. It wasn't the best I had ever had but it was tasty. Still in the shell. A little bit oddly too salty. I know its swimming in a bath of butter and garlic and salt to begin with but it overwhelmed the taste of the little morsels of snail meat. I also tried a tiny piece of my friend's Ravioles de Royan au Comté: little French ravioli stuffed with comte cheese in a truffle cream sauce  - Very decadent sauce and a winner of a dish. Pretty good portion size as well for being just an appetizer. I sampled one of someone's mussles (they have a variety in either a white wine, curry sauce, or Dijon mustard sauce). I tried the white wine version and have to say that the sauce was reserved for later on bread dipping. For my actual entrée I split it with Miss Finlay to spare some duckets in the bank. I went with the Kassulet Toulousain de la Maison, which is their signature dish. This is complete insanity. Two of us couldn't even finish the entire thing. When they say its a southern French dish meant to feed warrior men, they weren't kidding. It's essentially a deep baking casserole comprised of: cannellini beans, carrots, tomato, garlic duck confit (which is melt in your mouth fatty amazingness), slab bacon (which can possibly turn off some picky meat eaters but its truly delicious), and pork sausage that is all braised in Noble Duck Fat with Quail Stock and Foie Gras Jus and all topped with a giant sprig of Rosemary! Yes, I started capitalizing all of that. There are so many complex layers to it. Every time you dig in, you get a bite of something decadent and new tasting.My other dining companions ordered the seared rohan duck breast, the fish of the day, and the Linguini aux fruits de mer. All dishes received praise and went completely finished. La Sirene has an interesting dining style for their entrees in that they also present you with side dishes to share: a quartet of pureed vegetables - carrot, parsnip, sweet potato, and I believe squash. A welcome accompaniment for tasting with the dishes. Rounded out the night with desert: Fondant au Chocolat Noir - dark lava chocolate cake with home made coconut sherbet. Delicious. Maybe not as epic as I expected. What was more epic than I expected was their ice cream and sherberts made from scratch. One of them was an intense dark chocolate and another raspberry and they played notes of a full symphony together in harmony on the palate. The French know how to do desert well and here they surely have.",3,1,0,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",843,1384,11457

No apology and they charged us for the third bottle we opened to replace the spilled wine.It wound up costing us $60 plus tax just to drink our own wine bc who wants to carry around bottles at a bar afterwards (plus most of their wines are $40+)As far as the food, it has always been good, but rather pricey. However that was fine when it was byob.

2.0,9/26/2014,"Gawd awful food and dining experience at la sirene. They must be paying yelp a lot of money to keep their rating so high.We were seated promptly and brought menus and drinks. Had to ask for the specials after a few minutes since we overheard our waiter telling every other table that came after us. Started with curry mussels and burrata, both decent. Curry was very strong and overpowering- tasty, but not classic French fare. We ordered the ""signature"" with duck confit, sausage, and beans. Also ordered the filet topped with foie torchon and truffle glaze. The filet was a big mistake- came out very overcooked and the texture of the meat was like a baked zucchini. Wouldn't be surprised if it was previously frozen, thrown on the grill, and doused in sauce to cover up the lack of flavor. I sent it back and got the hanger steak instead which was slightly better but not by much. Meat was very rubbery, and covered in so much fried garlic and butter that you couldn't taste anything. The signature dish was essentially stewed duck, beans, and sausage. The duck was a bit dry and flavorless on its own, but having the sauce and beans mixed together helped mask the blandness.The restaurant wasnt crowded at 8pm on Thursday- first red flag. Not sure if it was just an off night but all the patrons dining there were loud and tourist tacky. That contributed to the weird and off-putting atmosphere.  With food quality that wouldn't be passable in most NYC establishments, it was clear that no one dining here appreciates good French food or good food in general.

Foie Gras was so heavenly paired with poached pears or cherry jam on toasted bread.  Sautéed baby octopus with garlic, parsley, olive oil, tomato and mushroom - OMG, the octopus was cooked perfectly.  It was delicate and all the ingredients on this dish was simply wonderful.  Moules Vignerones - this is the best mussels dish I have ever had.  The steamed mussels in red wine, herbs, mushrooms, tomato, onion garlic and bacon was delicious.  The mussels were fresh and extremely tender. Tournedos Rossini - seared filet mignon topped with Foie Gras, shallots, port and red wine truffles sauce; need I say more.  Filet Mignon was medium rare and just melted in my mouth.  It came with scalloped potatoes, green beans, carrot purée, cauliflower purée & eggplants.  Scalloped potatoes were crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  Carrot and cauliflower purée was smooth and buttery.  Green beans and eggplants were seasoned and cooked to perfection.  Kids would love these veggie sides...yum yum yumFondant au chocolat noir - dark lava chocolate cake with coconut sherbet was not overly sweet and the coconut sherbet was refreshing.I have nothing bad to say about the dishes we ordered.  Absolutely scrumptious and exquisite.  So lucky to have come across this restaurant on yelp.  Wish there was a French restaurant like La Sirene that was both delicious and affordable in CA.  Until next time love.",2,1,0,Kelly N.,"Orange County, CA",155,451,2722

The menu isn't extensive (thankfully), but there are plenty of options without being overwhelming. I wanted everything but after a shocked face and some advice from our server, I had the goat cheese tart, the tomato and burrata salad (special), and the Comte stuffed ravioli with cream and truffle sauce. My boyfriend had the filet mignon entrée with fois gras which came with a side of 4 puréed vegetables. I hate being talked out of food and I was slightly annoyed that my server talked me out of the blue cheese pear dish, but she was right- I was stuffed after 3 appetizers. The tomato salad was excellent and VERY filling! It was very light but tasted rich- I could eat that every day. The goat cheese tart was also a large portion and with one side would satisfy anyone. It was very good, but the ravioli stole the show. The taste was comforting and delicious and was the perfect portion. I wish that they would add this to the entrée menu and give you a little more!We decided to skip desert and grab the check to start walking off our food.

There's lots to pick from in the $28-35/range. My starter was a homemade pate de campagne - you can really tell the difference when something like this is made in house. It was perfectly textured and well seasoned but not so much that it overshadowed the meat. It came with a lovely salad or arugula, apples and mango. The Mister had a classic mussels and the 1/2 size was still a giant portion. I'm no mussel fan but the broth...to die for.My main was a braised rabbit which was cooked with carrots, mushrooms and cream. Again, the sauce...classic and rich. The rabbit fell off the bones and was full of flavor. Mister had a flounder special - delicate, flaky and subtly flavored with star anise - delicious. All entrees come with a side of veg - in our case that meant carrot puree (buttery amazing), cauliflower puree (garlicky and wonderful), butternut squash (simple, but delicious) and eggplant (good but nothing special). Desserts were tarte tatin & banana crème brulee. The menu is careful to call out that the crème brulee is their take on banana pudding with a caramelized sugar crust. The tarte tatin had wonderful flavor and the apples weren't mushy but I'm pretty sure they nuke it which meant that the pastry was soggy.

From the moment we walked in the door the staff was super friendly and eager to make our experience a great one. We were seated right away and it was a slow night so we had our pick of where to sit. We sat on the Taureau side of the restaurant (this where they do fondue but we did not participate in that) which was very intimate. When we sat down to order our waitress was very helpful in answering any questions we had about the entrees. She always had a smile on her face and was even chatting with us about the restaurant. Now the food. We started with the french onion soup which was great! The cheese was super melty not crusty, and it seemed to never end haha. I felt it could have used a little more onions but overall one of the best french onion soups i have had. As an entree I ordered the braised rabbit stew and my girlfriend ordered the coq au vin.....neither disappointed us. The rabbit was so moist and tender I barely had to chew it and it was in this creamy mushroom sauce which I honestly would bathe in lol! The coq au vin was amazing as well. The dark meat chicken was cooked perfectly very tender and juicy and the red wine sauce was to die for. The portions were a great size leaving us satisfied but not busting out of our pants. We also had a bottle of red wine which was good and not that expensive (about 35$). We decided not to do dessert but they did have a variety of different things to choose from.

5.0,8/1/2014,"La Sirene makes two dishes which are my absolute favorite and I consider myself a foodie. Unfortunately, my wife is a faster eater than me and loves those two dishes equally as much and so, she sometimes eats my portion! La Sirene is romantic, dimly lit, French, and the service was very attentive and friendly without being overly present, making it a very nice evening for my wife and I. The server went over the menu and explained the dishes deliciously as they came out. My wife and I ordered several dishes, and our two favorites which we dream about are the escargot and cassoulet. cassoulet. mmmm. cassoulet.The menu described the cassoulet as a hearty soulful dish for warriors - naturally, we had to try it. It was amazing from the first bite. Rich, very rich. Hearty, yes, very hearty. My wife and I shared it and kept looking at each other like, ""omg, this is amazing."" And I was looking at her like, ""omg, I hope she gets full so I can eat it all!"" j sort of k. Honestly, it's my favorite dish. The service, ambiance, friendliness, also elevate it all to an incredibly great experience and personal favorite restaurant in NYC. The escargot is another favorite. I love the olive oil and parmesan. Again, my fiance and I had the same look in our eyes. I was sure to use the bread to absorb all the flavor - ""scarpeta"" as the Italians say.To top it off, the complimentary side dish was a variety of pureed vegetables, and they were all perfect.

3.0,6/30/2014,"We first ate here some months ago.   Our feeling was that the BYOB policy helped to offset the somewhat pricey menu.   Based on food alone, we thought La Sirene might earn 4* so we returned last week with two friends and two bottles of good wine.After we sat down, we were unceremoniously told, to the embarrassment of us and our friends, that the BYOB policy had ended and we would pay a $40.00 corkage fee ($20. per bottle), take or leave it because there was no one on the premises who was even authorized to discuss or modify the policy.Given limited options, we chose to stay and pay the fee.  The food was ok  - still 4*; we especially liked the cassoulet and the hanger steak.  But the service at best was mediocre;  the waiters seemed distracted and untrained;  and as noted,  no one was in charge.  3* seems an appropriate overall rating.We see no reason to return.Re: The comment from the restaurant below: A check of the web shows that, in NY, once a restaurant has a liquor license,  the amount of the corkage fee charged, IF ANY, is up to the complete discretion of the restaurant.  La Sirene  could have waved the fee or charged it on only one bottle as we requested and the NYS Liquor Authority wouldn't care.  To quote an old marketing saying:  I believe that you made the sale and lost the customer.",2,0,0,Nora C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,31,0
4.0,6/23/2014,"Great food. Awesome service.Escargot - first time trying escargot and thoroughly enjoyed it because it was full of butter and garlic flavors. Dip the bread they serve in that mixture and it was like garlic bread taken to another level. Eating the snails was as if I was eating baked clams. The goat cheese tart - Delicious. Decadent, creamy, and with complex but complimenting flavors. Mussels with curry, diced apples, and cream sauce - very bold flavor with a hint of heat. Sauce was a bit heavy for my taste but that's OK because I was busy eating the mussels and left the sauce to my date for bread mopping. Kassoulet - had this stew in France and enjoyed. I enjoyed it here as well. It's a hearty dish and the salty crust on top was a good addition. The sausage was delicious and my favorite meat in the stew. The duck meat was so tender. Bacon was a bit salty and I liked that the least. White beans provided the creamy texture and the perfect backdrop to such a hearty stew. This dish was heavy on the garlic. Profiteroles - order it. Soft pastry, cold vanilla ice cream, a lot of melted good quality bittersweet  chocolate. No words were exchanged because it was that good and thoroughly enjoyed. Service was amazing. It could have also been because the restaurant wasn't packed at 6:00 on a Thursday evening. The place is quaint - seats maybe 30? Decorated n a charming way. Felt very comfortable. Romantic setting for couples. We shared all meals. I would come back and try other things on their menu.

For an appetizer we shared the baked goat cheese since everyone recommended it and it was SO worth it. For entrees I had the pork chops which were great and he had the steak which he also liked. The sides were good also- an unlimited! We were so full we weren't able to have refils ha. I really recommend going here for a good date night spot. with the BYOB it really made the meal affordable.

3.0,6/13/2014,"I think I ordered the wrong item here. Maybe it's because I'm a spice fiend that I found the Moules Rochelaises [Steamed Mussels with Curry, Diced Apples and Light Cream (Chef 's Favorites)] to be far too bland and dry for my palate. The mussels were substantial and by the time I did get down to the sauce at the very bottom, I thought it was fairly decent. Which is why I'm giving La Sirene an ""A-OK."" I did try my friend's Kassulet Toulousain de la Maison (Signature), which was absolutely delicious. It was quite the opposite of my light meal. My friend had to get a bag to take the 3/4 of her meal home with her - it was quite a decadent feast, and came along with a veggie side - which included a delicious assortment of pureed veggies - a couple of them a bit exotic :) So her meal was quite the highlight of the evening, as we were both able to try each other's choices.Overall, I'd love to come back to try some other menu items, but I'll stay away from the mussels here for now.",0,0,0,Lydia R.,"Washington, DC",600,566,1152

Not quite sure why this place is so highly rated among the yelping community. Been three times and while the food is very delicious, but in my opinion doesn't quite reach expectational levels.Within Yelp, 4.5 ratings are consistent with the level of food and service encountered at Per Se and Eleven Madison Park. La Sirene is a different animal altogether, so don't expect the same here that you would encounter at other 4.5 yelp starred dining restaurants.There is admittedly a sincerity and humility that pervades this place, and perhaps the lack of prentention contributes to the good feelings customers have for this restaurant.Those who appreciate a quaint environment with nostalgic charms will find this place endearing.Since it's an intimate restaurant with a limited number of seats, it's great for a date with someone special.",0,0,0,Jake J.,"New York, NY",8,46,36

I tried their steamed mussels..I was so disappointed.. extremely salty and barely any broth at all..I ordered the filet mignon with fois gras.. again.. the brown gravy like sauce they had on the steak was so salty.. I literally had a small bite and my date finished my meal.Lucky for us his dinner , the duck was REALLY small so he was still hungry ..I'd say.. if I had the option of asking them to cook me a less salty meal I can definitely see the potential in how great it is.I think the reviews here are VERY misleading..I don't know if I would give them another chance though..the food was extremely expensive..",1,0,1,Soo K.,"Leonia, NJ",424,79,47

5.0,5/19/2014,"After finding out that one of the people in my party recently went to places like Per Se, Le Bernardin, Jean-Georges, and Daniel, I had to choose a really good restaurant. Obviously, this place is not like any of those 4 places I mentioned, but I decided to make some reservations for 4 people at this place after hearing some good things. Walking into this place, and I felt like I walked into a really good French bistro in a better city.We had the Baked Goat Cheese and the Steamed Mussels in white wine, and I thought they were excellent. The flavor and the texture of the cheese were excellent, there was a nice softness and the flavor was not too sweet or overly savory, so it was almost a perfect balance. The flavor of the mussels was also excellent and it made every piece almost addicting to eat. I had the Coq au Vin, which is supposedly one of the most quintessential French dishes. The flavor of the chicken was pretty good, almost like I was eating home cooked chicken, and the flavors were excellent, especially from the red wine. Portions were excellent, the chicken came with some deliciously good and freshly cooked vegetables as side dishes. They complemented the dish really well. Other dishes that were ordered were the Seared Rohan Duck Breast and the Cassoulet Toulouse. Everyone really liked the food here, so dinner was a success. We were very pleased that they are starting to accept American Express credit cards, so it made things a little convenient. The interior has a nice, somewhat comfortable but cosy feel and vibe. Overall, I thought I had one of the tastiest French style dinners for the first time in several months. This is probably one of the best French restaurants I have visited so far, and if you are looking for a great dinner to ""kick-start"" a fun night in New York, this place is a really good choice. Nice and cosy interior, tasty and excellent food, and the prices are not too high, but definitely not cheap.

I ordered mine medium and my wife ordered hers medium well and they were both cooked to perfection. We started with a tasty escargot appetizer. The only negative about it is that they only accept cash. I had to take a walk to the ATM down the street. They did warn me about this when confirming the reservation but I forgot.

5.0,5/5/2014,"This place is a solid 4.5 stars. Despite two minor pas, La Sirene was an AWESOME dining experience.First off, reservations were a breeze. My boyfriend and I had booked our table the night before via OpenTable.There were ample time-slots around the time we were looking to having dinner, but ended up getting what we were hoping for; 7:30 reservations for a Friday night. Now onto the food and drinks. French food calls for wine in my book. And with our courtesy call confirming our reservations earlier that day, the young lady on the phone tells us that they no longer do BYO. --- A whole bottle of Pinot Noir for $35 on the menu? Nobody can be mad at that in New York City and that exactly what we got.For an appetizer we got the BABY OCTOPUS OVER SALAD. It was wonderful. The octopus was so tender so juicy and it was just the right amount of greens. The lemon wedge did just the trick.For our entrees, I had one of their specials for that night; SEARED QUAIL with cherry sauce and a sweet potato cake. My boyfriend had ordered the HANGER STEAK. The quail was seasoned and seared perfectly. The cherry sauce was just enough for all my pieces of meat. Nothing was wasted. I was able to taste hanger steak and it too was tender and cooked perfectly. A medley of vegetables were placed in the middle of the table for us to share. Carrot puree, cauliflower puree, Mexican chayote, and glazed butternut squash. The purees were my favorite.Since the entrees weren't too big we each got a dessert. Choux Chantilly and a strawberry tartlette. Whipped cream heaven! I loved both, although a little drizzle of some chocolate sauce or caramel would have done the trick for the Chantilly... or even a side of fresh raspberries! La Sirene is just your unpretentious French restaurant. It has attentive service, excellent tasting food in an intimate setting. My only minor deductions:1. I got a sense of urgency from the male servers that I didn't particular like2. When our bread basket came out, the server gave us a side of EVOO. I had immediately asked for butter, but sadly our server wasn't able to accommodate my request and didn't say why.

3.0,4/26/2014,"I've been to La Sirene about 10 times over the past 3 years. It's been one of my favorite restaurants in the city and I've referred dozens of people here. I came here with my fiancee the night after I proposed, and bring my family here for special occasions. I believe I reviewed it in the past and gave it 4 or 5 stars. I'm disappointed with how the restaurant has changed recently, for two reasons:- Prices. When they were BYOB, I could understand that the food was a little overpriced and I was happy to pay those prices. They're no longer BYOB but haven't changed the menu prices, and their portions are very small in my opinion. - Service. I don't remember specific servers other than one very nice french lady, but in the past I've felt that La Sirene was a very warm, homey kind of place. The current servers (at least on Friday, 4/25) are less interested in your meal and also less knowledgeable. One couldn't tell me what one of the vegetables was on the vegetable plate. Another confronted me about the BYOB policy because I had La Vid (wine shop around the corner) deliver a bottle of wine ahead of our reservation, which apparently is no longer allowed. You CAN bring your own wine for a $20 corkage fee (which they had already explained to me when they confirmed the res), but you CANNOT have it delivered (no one explained that to me). So the poor delivery guy was waiting outside the restaurant for 15 minutes before I got there, and the server blamed this on me, the customer, saying ""You knew you couldn't do this! We told you!!"". Well..no you didnt, you only told me about the $20 fee. Still a solid meal, but I don't feel like it's a special place anymore, that's all.",1,0,0,Taylor G.,"Manhattan, NY",4,53,2

4.0,4/24/2014,"I knew I was going to like this place as soon as I walked in and inhaled the beautiful aroma of butter.La Sirene was an unpretentious and charming little restaurant, a perfect place for date night. My husband and I were here to celebrate a special occasion which to us means eating with no limits.  Bring on the duck fat and butter.For starters, we ordered the French Onion Soup and The Escargot.   The soup had a nice beefy flavor with the caramelized onions and topped with a generous layer of melted cheese.  Good solid soup.  However, the Escargot was on another level.  A 1/2 dozen in the shell were served in this insanely delicious garlic butter sauce.  Although the snail meat was tiny (I kept digging in the shell looking for more) that sauce compensated for it.  We took every last piece of the bread and dipped it into the sauce.  For our second course, we went with the manager's recommendation and ordered the seared Moulard Duck Breast and the seared Filet Mignon.  He suggested both cooked medium rare but I don't do rare duck so I chose medium.  The duck was served in a cherry, port and red wine sauce which was on the sweet side but the flavors were delicious.  I thought it complemented the duck very well.  The Filet Mignon was a very luxurious dish.  It was topped with Foie Gras and sat in a red wine truffle sauce.  The combination of flavors were wonderful.  We were also provided with a side plate of yummy veggies - pureed carrots, pureed cauliflower, and roasted cauliflower.  To top off our meal, we shared the dark chocolate lava cake.  The menu states it takes 12 minutes to prepare which we didn't mind, since we definitely needed a break.  The cake oozed with this lovely dark chocolate sauce and it was served with homemade coconut sherbet.   It was the perfect decadent dessert to end the meal.The service here was friendly and attentive. It would have been great if they were still BYOB but they do offer a decent wine list.  Also because the restaurant is somewhat in a remote part of town, it was really easy to find street parking.

Their wine list is decent. My boyfriend and I shared the goat cheese tart, which was highly reviewed, and I opted for the filet mignon with foie gras while my boyfriend had the pork tenderloin. I enjoyed the goat cheese tart, which game out in a bigger portion that I expected. My bf, unfortunately, is not a huge fan of goat cheese, so I ended up eating it all myself. Maybe not so unfortunate after all!I do like the idea that the main entrees come out with a side of vegetable purees, and I enjoyed the veggies a lot. Unfortunately, we were both a little disappointed when our food did come out, as the portions did seem a bit on the small side. However, my boyfriend loved his pork tenderloin, and I stole a few bites of it as well and agree with him. The sauce for the pork was super tasty as well. My steak was also very well cooked, and delicious, as was the foie gras (my first time ever trying it!). We ended up not getting dessert, even though we both could still eat more.

I was led to La Sirène by the glowing crowd-sourced reviews and was not disappointed; flawlessly executed food. We began with the octopus appetizer, which was copious and extremely tasty, and followed that with the filet mignon de porc and the hanger steak. The latter was perfectly cooked, generously proportioned, and had a wonderful garlic and pepper side sauce, while the pork was tender and excellent with a sauce that may have been even better than the steak's. The Bordeaux I had by the $9 glass was also very good. Also, the side-plate vegetables that accompany the main dishes, which in many restaurants would be an after-thought, were also quite wonderful: four or five different vegetables (green beans, purées, etc.) that all sang.

Everything was perfect from start to finish and I'm glad I read a bunch of reviews so I came prepared (except for one thing - will expound on this later).I was ready for the cramped space as most Yelpers mentioned. Yes the tables are small and yes the tables are crammed together tightly. Good thing our server was very attentive that we never felt like our dishes were falling off the table, every dish was timed accordingly. We had curry mussels, the baked seafood and the Tournedos Rossini. The mussels could have used some more kick from the curry but everything was rich and flavorful. I loved the Tournedos Rossini and it was everything I hoped it would be based on all the Yelp reviews I read.Unfortunately, we forgot to bring wine! After being reminded about them being BYOB when we made the reservation, we were so mad at ourselves for forgetting one of the best parts about this place. Good thing our server informed us about the wine store they apparently have a partnership with. I called the number she gave me and the wine store staff even helped me pick a bottle.

The goat cheese tart, AHMAZING. Escargot, AHMAZING. Cassoulet, also AHMAZING. We had some left over and we microwaved it the next day and it tasted even better. The beans and meat just absorbed all of the flavor beautifully. Filet Mignon with foie gras was to die for me. And the dessert sampler also YUMMY! We must have been there for three hours. It was just a beautiful night. Great food, good company. Perfect setting. It was cozy and the lights were dimmed just right.

3.0,2/16/2014,"I had great expectation before I came here but it somehow fell short. Like all reviewers said, this is a smaller intimate restaurant. Not my type of date spot though because the decor is lacking and needs to be updated. But, it is more suitable for meeting up with friends and having long conversations over drinks and rich indulgences.  We started with the famous goat cheese tart that everyone raved about. It was very good and not too rich, probably the tastiest dish I had during the entire meal. The escargots were nothing special, so you can save your option for other offerings. My friend had the duck breast and I got the filet mignon topped with foie gras. Can I just say how lacking in presentation you are, La Sirene? French cuisine in particular is supposed to pay special attention to presentation and I didn't observe any of that here. Both our entrees had the same plating, which consists of a square piece of sweet potato gratin on the upper right corner and the filet mignon and duck breast both drowned in a pool of black sauce. Literally, all you see are black piles on our plates each accompanied by a weird orange square. My filet was cooked nicely, so was the foie gras. My friend's duck breast tasted okay too. However, we both agreed that all we could taste is the sauce and not so much the food anymore. Just way too much sauce. This is the same case with the profiteroles that we ordered for dessert. The profiteroles were covered entirely by this intense chocolate sauce. The sauce ruined the whole profiterole experience for me, since I could hardly taste the ice cream in between. The Iles Flottantes was extremely plain, just a plate of overly sweet creme and meringue with caramel. Service was courteous and attentive most of the time. However, when we paid in cash and didn't get any change back, we were very perplexed. Our server never even asked if we needed change back, just took the checkbook and left. Sure, he was nice, but it wasn't a 26% tip kind of nice. We waited for a long time and didn't see him around anymore so we finally flagged down the manager. She listened to our situation and promptly resolved the problem by tracking down the server, giving back our change and apologizing for the inconvenience.

4.0,2/9/2014,"I admit it. I'm a sucker for French restaurants, especially French bistros. I have been to La Sirene twice (just as insurance), so my review stands at four stars.Located on the corner of Canal and Broome Streets, La Sirene gives a deceptively modest appearance. Enter though, and you find a wonderfully decorated room, with well spaced tables, elegant placesets and wine glasses. The location can seat perhaps a little over twenty people, so be sure to make reservations in advance.The menus were humorously done and with a uniquely personal touch, and based off of reviews and prior experience, my friends and I opted to share appetizers and dessert and get our own entrees. To start off the meal: the goat cheese tart is everything it's hyped up to be, especially for those that love this dairy product. The goat cheese is cooked with shallots, truffles, and a grape confit and is topped off with an additional layer of aged Swiss. A salad was also on the side, served with a ring of raspberry vinaigrette encircling the plate, and it's a much appreciated contrast to the tart.I also have nothing but good words about the hangar steak; the beef was cooked to a perfect medium with garlic, parsley, and copious amounts of butter. All entrees also include a side of vegetables. Our table shared a plate that had creamed cauliflower and carrots, squash, and cucumbers. It was a a nice balance to most of the entree dishes, which are quite rich and protein-heavy. A daring member of our group ventured to try the Kassoulet, which is a dish chock full of goodness: duck confit, bacon, sausage, foie gras jus, and cannellini beans... The menu gives you ample warning about this dish, stating that it was ""served for Warriors to defend their village"". Even my friend, well known for his hearty appetite, was pretty much done in by this dish; it's not to be taken lightly.Dessert is a must-have, and it's impossible to go wrong with the profiteroles. Four small scoops of vanilla ice cream sandwiched between profiteroles, topped with melted bittersweet chocolate and a dollop of whipped cream. Can you say perfection? It's a delicious treat for chocolate and ice cream lovers... Be warned though, it's extremely messy and melts rather quick. After my friend and I finished, our plate looked like a swamp of leftover chocolate and ice cream.In sum: Come hungry and bring either cash or AmEx. You'll be guaranteed a lovely meal.",9,4,9,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

My friends and I are wine collectors and always enjoyed going here with some really good bottles that we could not possibly afford in any restaurant in Manhattan   Even though the food is very good the main allure for us was the BYOB policy which sadly no longer exists. I don't understand why they took so many years to get their liquor license but obviously that's their purgative . I know that not everybody cares about drinking expensive and good wine with their meals but most true foodies definitely do and unfortunately I feel they will lose much business do to their new policy. I think it would behoove then to designate one night per week as BYOB as some establishments in NYC already do but again that's their choice . My friends and I will miss this place but I guess its time to move on, The owner and the people who work here are very nice and I wish them well but to have a BYOB policy all these years and then do away with it might be a mistake since everyone I happen to know who ate here told me they will not be back .",0,0,0,William O.,"Astoria, NY",0,22,7

Had the opportunity to do so when I was treating for a birthday dinner.The restaurant is very small, warm, and cozy. The atmosphere was very inviting. Note: They recently got their liquor license, so there is no longer BYOB ($18 corkage fee if you do). We each ordered a glass of wine. For food, we ordered the escargots to share, and he ordered cassoulet while I got the filet mignon. The service was just okay. Our experience wasn't impeccable like others had. We saw servers at other tables were warmly welcoming those patrons, thanking them for dining tonight and then going through a detailed description of  the specials. In short, being smiley and charming.In contrast, our server simply approached our table, looked down at his notepad and asked us if we were ready to order. Huh? That's all?  We also had the unfortunate luck to have a loud and disruptive foursome get seated next to us partway through the dinner, which kind of killed the romantic mood. (Not the restaurant's fault though.)The food, however, was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS . The escargots were soft and tender and smothered in garlic and butter. The cassoulet was rich and hearty and extremely flavorful with the duck fat. We didn't actually know if we'd finish it, but we managed in the end. The filet mignon was the real winner that night. It was juicy, tender, covered in a delicious red wine truffle sauce and topped with a chilled fois gras. Each bite was HEAVENLY. Also enjoyed the vegetables very much, especially the carrot puree. Although we had to ask twice for a refill on the veggies because our server forgot the first time. Another serving ended up taking care of that for us.Despite the small mishaps, the food is so fantastic that I'd go back anyway.",4,3,2,Steph C.,"Brooklyn, NY",478,767,323

I ordered the filet with foie gras and it was so thoroughly enjoyable! the foie melted slowly over the filet, and the flavors (also with the wine reduction sauce) worked together just perfectly. the small plate of complimentary vegetables also tasted great! the pureed carrots and sauteed green beans were my favorite. for dessert we ordered the strawberries and whipped cream.

3.0,1/7/2014,"Took wife over at La Sirene to celebrate our first anniversary on one of the coldest Saturday night, and to add salt to the wound it was the night that NYC got its first biggest snow storm of 2013. I had made reservation ahead of time, and knowing how difficult it would be to travel, we arrived at the restaurant way earlier than planed. We were the first customers to show up at their door steps when the waiters and chiefs were still quietly chatting near the counter. La Sirene was not a spacious restaurant, but cozy, heart warming, and the settings held promise for a night of great dinner and intimacy. Once we were seated, our waitress brought over the menus and also one of the biggest disappointment of the night: they don't serve alcohol. French food with no wine paring! That was like peanut butter without jelly. ""You must had been informed over the phone while making the reservation and we also allow you to bring your own wine at no extra charge. But worry not, there is a liquor store not far from us where you can order over the phone and they deliver for free"", so said the waitress in such a casual way that made me wanted to roll my eyes at her. I wasn't informed, I called the restaurant when I first made the reservation and confirmed with the staffs the day before dinning and both times no one mentioned about not servicing alcohol. And worse I had to confirm with them over the phone to make sure they indeed don't accept credit card. Like the lack of alcohol, this was an inconvenience caused by the restaurant, at least the staffs should have the courtesy to inform the customers.For the night we kicked off with French onion soup, foie gras,escargots, baby octopus. The onion soup was rich and flavorful and we enjoyed it, but the bread topping beneath the cheese was too soggy. At every French restaurant I always order the foie gras. By far this version done by La Sirene was the most fattest ones that I ever tasted. My wife didn't enjoy it as much as I did, as I happily spread layers of the ""light brown stuff"" on my toasts and munched away. As for the escargots, this was our first opportunity tasting the giant snails and we were not very impressed with the taste. Being both Chinese, eating exotic foods weren't foreign to us, especial when it was associated with shells. The escargots were tender, soaked with butter and an emerald green garlic sauce. But the flavor was missing. It was like a piece of gum that had long lost its flavor after chewing it so long. The baby octopus was grilled right, tender, flavorful; the way I loved it.As for the entrees, we had a filet mignon and the oven baked seafood, which many reviewers on Yelp mistakenly thought it was the shepherd pie. I would boldly say the fillet mignon had the worse presentation that I ever encountered in a dish served in a restaurant. On appearance, it was a dark brown medallion of grilled-looking burger, topped with a thick brown slice of foie gras, all drenched in a thick layer of dark brown sauce. The whole thing made me thought a dog had pooped on my plate. But of course you couldn't judge a dish by its appearance alone. Despite its awful look, the filet was cooked perfect, medium rare. To add icing to the cake, the combination of the chilled foie gras was mind blowing awesome. It well complemented the meat and added an even richer taste to the dish. If you are a meat lover this was a must. However, the complaint I had was associated with the heavy use of salt. I would normally call myself a salt lover, but this dish even surpassed my level of tolerance. The baked seafood was sadly mediocre, as all of the ingredients were stuffed together under a thick layer of cheese. It tasted blend and boring as if all the flavor and salt went to the filet, where the seafoods appeared to be like rubber. The whole experience made me wondered how could the two dishes be so unbalanced in terms of quality. As for dessert, we had the banana brulee. It was funny and misleading as the menu specifically said this was a banana pudding and not a creme brulee. Really? I beg different, as at its heart, it was the same custard top layer fired crunchy with alteration of banana slices, crackers and pudding as filling. Who were you trying to fool? The dessert at best was average, nothing noticeable.La Sirene was a small, cozy, and intimate place for a date on good settings and decorations. However, if you are looking for great french food, then this will not be a place suitable for you, at it lacked both on presentation and flavor.",0,0,0,T.K M.,"Jackson Heights, NY",3,66,81

For entrees,  we had the duck breast with cherries and wine sauce,  the lamb chop,  and the cassoulet.  All were wonderfully prepared,  tender,  juicy,  flavorful and well worth the rest of my week's calorie quota ^^ Didn't leave enough room for dessert because we were such gluttons,  but will leave some space next time :)  Can't wait to come back again!",1,0,0,Jenny H.,"New York, NY",66,31,5
4.0,1/4/2014,"OH MY GOD, A RESTAURANT WITH NO CORKAGE FEE IN MANHATTAN.  That alone deserves 15 stars, since a corkage-fee-free BYOB is as common as unicorns and Republicans in this fair city of ours.  However, in addition to the no-corkage-fee, the food is phenomenal.  For a starter, my fiance and I split the beet and brie salad; I'm not a huge beet fan, but the beets were cooked and seasoned well, and I very much enjoyed it.  For the main, I had the filet with foie gras.  Get it; the steak was cooked as I requested (rare), practically melted on contact with the steak knife and the sauce and foie gras complemented the meat perfected.  For dessert, we split the meringue and almond dish.  Delicious.  I felt a bit bad for my fiance; he didn't get his half (more like 25%).  The service here is also great; they're very attentive without being overwhelming.  But one warning - there is a time limit on the tables, even on a Monday night.  They want you out after 90 minutes (hence the 4 stars).",1,1,0,Megan L.,"Manhattan, NY",18,79,0

5.0,1/2/2014,"La Sirene, in one word, is GLORIOUS. I kid you not.I dined here on New Years Eve with the bf for our anniversary and it was a freaking amazing experience. The restaurant is very small (you are less than an arm's length away from the person at the next table) but cozy and intimate. Perfect for date night.Forgot to bring some wine knowing this place is BYOB? No problem! Ask them for a card to the wine shop in the area that delivers. You'll be happily sipping on a glass in 20. Just don't forget to tip the wine guy.We started with the bread basket and cheese plate. Good, but I would've preferred the bread to be warm. Then came the cheese tart and escargot. They were both delicious but the escargot was absolutely DIVINE... Had to hold myself back from literally licking my plate to get every last bit of goodness. Best escargots I have ever had. No lie.Let me just say that I can probably go on and on about the entrees for several paragraphs but I will save you the trouble. My bf orders his meat well done (breaks my heart every time he does) so when his veal chops came out, I expected it to be a hunk of rubber. But boy was I wrong... It was undoubtedly the most tender, well done meat I have ever had. It just melted in my mouth. And do I even need to tell you about the filet mignon topped with foie grais? I'm gonna tell you anyway. Do yourself a favor and make sure you get a bit of the filet, foie grais, and the sweet potato cake thing in every damn bite. You can thank me later.Dessert was on point as well. We had banana ice cream (so fresh), some type of banana pastry, and a profiterole doused in chocolate sauce. AWESOME. The unlimited quad of veggies that night were roasted eggplant, yellow bell pepper, taro puree, and carrot puree. The carrot puree was so so airy with a touch of creaminess, but the taro was my fave.I've already recommended this place to so many friends, and I dined here only two nights ago!

I got the pork tenderloin dish with a mushroom cream sauce (that was do die for!) and my husband got the duck confit. He's very much a wine/food snob and he said the duck was delicious too. While eating, the table next to us had a couple bottles of wine delivered to them from a guy on a bike... Blew our minds!

It is served in a small, black cast iron dish filled with thick, smokey slices of bacon, velvety haricot beans, savory pork sausage, and crispy duck confit (oooo duck fat!), all amalgamated in a decadent, delicious, amazing concoction with a peppery finish. I normally don't care about duck or beans, but I really wanted to hoard the entire dish for myself. But truthfully, it is a good dish for sharing, for A). sharing is caring, and B). this dish is not light and it would be impressive to finish the whole thing alone without your body hating you the next day.Each entree is served with sides of unlimited quad of veggies, whatever is on the market. That night we had spinach, eggplant, taro puree, and carrot puree (I couldn't get enough of this one...what's the addicting spice they put in it?). The unlimited factor made me feel a tad less guilty about stuffing my face with the decadent cassoulet.Then, appetizers - we had the pate and onion soup, which were both divine and a great intro to the standard, quality, and taste of La Sirene's fare, which sums up to one word: impressive.Notice that we did not have desserts. As much as we wanted to, we also knew that our stomachs would literally burst in a cosmic party of deliciousness if we order any more from their menu.Lovely, lovely, lovely.

I felt confident in all the stellar reviews to book it for Valentine's dinner (having never tried it before), which I now regret. I want to put it out there before continuing that I have been in the restaurant business for 12 years, working as a waitress, hostess, maitre d etc... in other words, I  feel like I have a good sense of what your  ""going out"" experience should feel like, whether it's brunch or an intimate dinner.When you arrive, the place is warm and packed... usually a good/welcoming sign. They were definitely extremely busy, given the night, but I don't think that should EVER constitute poor or lackluster service, especially in New York. ... We're all paying a shit ton of money to live here for a reason... one of the reasons should STILL be excellent restaurants with excellent service. La Sirene was neither of those things. My boyfriend and I waited about 10/15 minutes for our reserved table, completely understandable and normal for a busy NY spot. We were squeezed in between two other couples, which I could have totally rolled with, if  the food and service lived up to its ratings. From that moment on, I felt like I had signed up for a $200.00 speed- date- race on crack-- everything was SO rushed. It was overwhelming, distracting, and completely rude. Keep in mind, it was 10pm, not 7:30, 8:00 or 9.After being seated, our first of 3 waitresses immediately came over, and very heavy handedly poured our red wine half into our glasses and half in the middle of the table, slammed the bottle down, and walked away. After I picked my jaw off the floor, I asked a different waitress for some napkins so I could clean up the spill. Cool. I understand that every waiter/waitress has bad nights working in service, but obviously if you're on the other end of things PAYING for what should be GOOD service, this is NOT the way to start. Not more than 30 seconds later, the spiller came back and abruptly asked if we were ready to order. No hello. No how are you. No nothing. Am I in a diner? Should I order eggs and toast with bacon on the side? Um, do you mind if we look at the menu first? She walks away. This went on and on...The noise from the extremely bright kitchen didn't help the failed attempts to have a nice conversation, on top of the very close conversations to the left and right.

I wish the duck would have been cooked a little more rare and sliced thicker, but still very very good. Magret De Canard Gras (Moulard) Sauce Montmorency (Signature) seared moulard duck breast with cherry, port and red wine sauce is the proper description. The cherry sauce is the star and really made the dish.The variety of veggies they give you are sweet potato, carrots, celery root mash, and eggplant. All simply seasoned but satisfying.

BYOB with no corkage fee is great and we were provided with a wine bucket as soon as we sat down. We both shared the escargot which was very buttery and flavorful. My only gripe was that one of the shells was missing its meat. Not a big deal. She had the filet mignon top with foie gras and loved it. I had the seared duck breast. It was probably the best duck I've ever had - and I've eaten a lot of duck in the past! The unlimited veggie dish was excellent and we helped ourselves to second servings. We really wanted the chocolate lava cake for dessert but had to decline because we were too stuffed. It appeared that there were a lot of regulars at other tables which is a positive thing.

I left feeling extremely satisfied in all aspects of life. Ok I digress, let me get into what we had. My best friend and I were catching up in NYC (super jet setter like that) we made reservations on a friday night (a MUST) and brought a bottle of wine and champagne (HELLO BYOB). There isn't a corkage fee either. We started with the mussels and the escargot. then well be went for escargot round two (you will need plenty of bread so soak up the deliciousness and don't pretend to be all carb conscious) and then the duck. They serve it with veggies and they are endless and my best veggies were the carrots and the taro root. I felt so welcomed and respected at this establishment and my best friend and I were able to catch up for hours no pressure. In the end the bill came and we were pleasantly surprised.

5.0,11/9/2013,"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner and we had a wonderful time.  It is very packed and noisy (we were there on a Friday night) but we weren't too bothered by it because we were too occupied with our food.  We simply communicated our food-gasms through our eyes because the food just left us speechless.  We made a reservation for 9PM and we were seated in 15 minutes.  I really liked the decor of La Sirene.  Reading the reviews of the restaurant, I was definitely prepared for a small restaurant that didn't need nice decor to help the restaurant succeed.  So, I was pleasantly surprised by the decor.  It's hard to describe, it's very cozy, intimate but classy? Enough about the decor, I only stared at it for about 5 minutes before the bread was served.  I believe it was sourdough and I would have liked it to be warm but I could definitely tell it was fresh so no major complaints there.  (Also, you don't want to stuff yourself with bread.)We ordered the escargot to start.  It was my first time eating escargot so I have nothing to compare it to  It was delicious though.  Took me a minute to wrap my mind around the fact that I'm eating a snail but after the first one, there was no going back.  My boyfriend had the filet with foie gras (we love foie gras) while I had the hangar steak.  BOTH WERE SPECTACULAR.  The hanger steak was amazing.  It was so good I wanted to just scarf it down and yet slow down so I could just wrap myself in that moment.  My boyfriend's filet was delicious as well.  At first I thought the sauce ruined the steak but I began to like it (and almost miss it) after a couple of minutes.  I started just scooping that dark, thick sauce and eating it without the steak.  The sides included 4 different veggies.  I don't like eggplant and I was pretty indifferent towards the carribean potato and beans but I thought the sweet potato was ethereal.  It was just so smooth, delicious and balanced I just wanted to scoop the whole thing in my mouth and let it coat it all around.  But I was on a nice date so I had to act proper :( One thing that struck me as a bit weird was the paprika(?) that was sprinkled on the rim of the plate.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to run my steak through it (I did but there wasn't enough to really make a difference on my steak), or if it's just there for appearance.  In my opinion, the food is really phenomenal and it really doesn't need the sprinkling but hey, not my restaurant and if the food is this good, the chef can sprinkle the rim of the plate with glitter if they want.  For dessert, my boyfriend got the apple tart (FLAMBE!) while I ordered the profiteroles.  Oh my God, I loved the profiteroles.  The thick chocolate sauce that coats all three LARGE profiteroles generously is just so...sexy.  Deep, dark and just full of secrets.  The pastry itself tasted very fresh and good.  So good that I didn't get to taste much of my boyfriend's dish.  But I'm going to say it was probably really good because he did not offer any to me.  The flambe was really cool, ($3 extra to set your dessert on fire, it's his birthday so I'll indulge)  I am looking forward to coming back to La Sirene.  P.S. My boyfriend really enjoyed the menu.  He thought it was charming and very personal.  Ordering took a while because he was reading the little background information in the back of the menu.",2,2,1,Angela G.,"Bayside, NY",19,22,17

The octopus was okay (still dreaming of the octopus at Toqueville) and the mussels were nothing special. We had to dig through them to get to the sauce at the bottom. The bread was plentiful though and we kept asking for more and more to soak of all the sauces from our various appetizers.For entrees, three of us got the Filet Mignon with foie gras and my boyfriend got the garlic duck confit.

The restaurant is divided into sections, I guess they extended the original restaurant into neighboring storefronts. The lighting is very dim, enough to read the menu but wasn't really able to see the plate of deliciousness I was eating. For this price range, the decor seemed a bit tacky even under the dim light.

The cheese was not as overwhelming as I was expecting. The escargots were rather small, but that's how they generally are, and covered in butter. Loved it. The sauteed baby octopus was delicious, very tender with very rich flavors.The entrees were disappointing but maybe I didn't order the right thing. I had the special, rock bass, and it was good. It's a small portion, which is great for my small stomach, but I couldn't find anything that amazing with it. Flavors were a bit bland. Same with the kassulet, which was certainly rich in ingredients. Both dishes were well-cooked as far as preparation, however, flavor was lacking.Great and efficient staff.

It was a late dinner (probably could have been referred to as supper, as the French do) but quaint and delicious. My bf and I were the first to arrive, 15 minutes before the reservation time. Standing outside the restaurant, we kept smelling all sorts of delicious things wafting from the windows. We couldn't wait to get inside! By the time we were ready to order, we had settled on the escargot, french onion soup, and a full order of mussels (in the white wine/rosemary broth, which was absolutely what we were smelling from outside) to start with. The escargot were smaller than what you'd get in Paris but they did their job. The french onion soup was delicious, as was the mussels and broth. The other side of the table had their own share of mussels in the curry broth, and neither side wanted to share with the other! For entrees, I had the quail, while my bf had the duck breast. The portions were small (as it should be) and we were perfectly content with the size as well as the unlimited sides that come with the meal. The haricot vert were the most popular side, although I actually liked the carrot puree also. Whatever they mixed in with it was delicious :) For dessert we ordered the strawberry tart, and the others had the lava souffle cake, and some ice cream.

4.0,9/9/2013,"La Sirene is a cute little french bistro off the beaten path in the village.  It kind of took a while to find it to be honest, and when I got there, it felt so quiet and hidden, that I thought maybe I wasn't in Manhattan anymore.Furthering adding to my confusion was the lovely and sweet waitress, who was not only welcoming, but made the geekiest joke about running out of gigabytes when she couldn't remember all the ingredients in one of the specials that night.  I would come back just to hang out with her again.  Super endearing.That being said, I kind of wish I liked the food a little bit more.  The watermelon and feta salad was just a little bit too heavy on feta, and it wasn't as refreshing as it could have been.  The seared moulard duck breast was prepared to a medium rare perfection, but the sauce on it was way too heavy and sweet.  It really overpowered the natural fattiness and flavor that duck already has.  I ordered a pan fried fish that I can't even remember anything about, including the type of fish.. ( no bueno ).  There was one dish that I really liked though -  if you like mussels, order the steamed mussels with curry, diced apples and light cream.  It was really the highlight of the whole meal.  Mussels are good, but it's the sauce that really makes the meal.  You know it's good when you want to keep the sauce and dip every available piece of bread into it so that you can soak up all that goodness.  Apples instead of potatoes in curry?  Yes, absolutely.Overall, La Sirene isn't the fanciest French restaurant I've ever been to, nor was it the best.  However, it was one of the nicest dining experiences I've had in a long time.  I think that's worth 4 stars, and definitely worth a visit.",1,1,1,Vicky L.,"Jersey City, NJ",813,975,510

The ravioli as an appetizer and the foie gras and filet mignon as an entree were both to die for.  However, the second time, I had the Cassoulet and, true to the warning on the menu, the dish was very heavy and unspectacular.  It just felt like I was eating a bowl filled with beans and meat, and while the beans and meat were well done and generally pretty flavorful, it was just an unsatisfying meal for me.  However, I am willing to forgive this experience and call it personal preference because the escargot and mussels were very delicious.  Overall, this restaurant has a very homey feel--like your mother's kitchen almost--and generally very delicious.Ambiance is a bit on the loud side, but the quality of the food makes up for it  The restaurant is cash only and also BYOB.

4.0,9/2/2013,"Arrived with my hubby. Something to take note of, bring your wine if youre wine drinkers. Ordered the classic style mussels,  goat cheese tart, and escargots for starters. The tart and escargot were delish. The mussels left much to be desired. They were rather tepid and not too flavorful. The bread, which didnt seem too freshly baked, was the only consolation to the mussel broth, since we used it to dip into the broth and eat. The main course was the duck with a side of veggies. It was perfectly cooked and served, and was very tender and flavorful. The side of veggies had puree of carrots, a dominican version of a potato, brussel sprouts and some kind of cabbage (not a fan). Overall, the experience was great.",0,0,0,Sonya M.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,4,0
5.0,9/1/2013,"4.5 stars.Thanks Yelp for this find, which we never would have known about otherwise.  Excellent French fare + reasonable entree prices + cozy ambiance = big win.My husband had their signature dish, the filet mignon topped with foie gras pate ($34).  He loved it and I had a few bites and agreed it was excellent.  Always a treat for us to get foie since we live in CA where it is banned and this was really good.   I had one of the two fish specials offered that day, the pollack ($28.75) which came in a wonderful, rich mushroom cream sauce and was topped with amazing fried, puffed potatoes.  The fish itself was good but not amazing, but I think I may just not be a huge fan of pollack (I'm not sure I've had it before).   I love what they do for veggies - they bring out a tray with small portions of 4 veggie dishes for both people, but you can get as many refills of the veggie tray as you want.  Nice way of making people feel like they're getting an ""all you can eat"" value that doesn't result in overstuffed patrons too full for dessert (because really how many veggies can you eat?).  For dessert we shared a dark chocolate lava cake for $12.75.  The cake itself was great (VERY rich and dark as advertised, which I love)  but the filling was weird - it had a large solid piece of chocolate that had not melted, so although there was some ""lava"" flowing out of the cake when I first cut into it, most of the interior was solid, slightly melty chocolate that I didn't really like.  Service was very competent and attentive but I felt like it could have been a little warmer - although to be honest, at most restaurants I've eaten at in NYC I've gotten the vibe that the servers think they are a little too cool to be there.  The restaurant is small but this is a case of ""cozy"" actually meaning ""cozy"" as opposed to ""unfomfortabley close together.""   We definitely had our own space and did not feel like we were sitting on our neighbors laps or having their conversations forced down our throats.  As others have said, its BYOB/no corkage fee, and its also cash only, which is surprising (and somewhat annoying) given how much the food costs.   The entree prices are reasonable, given the quality (I think desserts are overpriced) but I'm not sure its the amazing amazing amazing deal others seem to think it is.  It was still $100 for dinner for 2 without any drinks so definitely not a cheap meal, even for NY.  The food is definitely worth it though, and we both agreed this was the third best meal we've had in NYC (behind Ai Fiori and Scarpetta, if you're curious).",3,3,1,A M.,"West Lafayette, IN",856,1301,8

2.0,8/29/2013,"I brought the fiancé here for his birthday because of the near-perfect views on yelp. The service was very good without being too intrusive. The ambience is quite cute as well. Quite romantic, I'd say.We ordered the escargot and goat cheese tart for appetizers, the filet mignon with foie gras and duck as entrees, and the meringue for dessert. Everything was just okay. It wasn't bad, but not exactly delicious IMO. Also, pureed vegetables just does not rub me the right way; they are meant for babies or people with no teeth. I could see how the dessert can easily break the tooth off of someone with poor dentition or low calcium!At the end when the bill came, I can't help but to feel like I was robbed. I don't mind at all to spend the money if the food was actually tasty, especially for a special occasion. If anything, I felt semi-bad that I picked the restaurant!

2.0,8/29/2013,"Seriously, how did this place get 4.5 stars? I've been completely fooled!! Are the reviewers all from Jersey (come right off the Holland tunnel) and think that anything and everything in NY is stunning and delicious? Like I said, this place is right next to the Holland tunnel so you get the hustle and bustle and honking and smoke from all the trailers.The restaurant itself is a decent size, felt kind of home-y. I made reservations for me and the man on a Wednesday at 5:30pm. Come to think of it, I'm not quite sure why I made reservations because we were the only ones there (early bird special?). I had to tell my guy that I rented out the whole restaurant for him. My fault for over hyping this place. geez.We got:appetizers cost about $10-$13 each- watermelon salad- pear and cheeseeach entree was about $30- lamb chops- hanger steakThe dessert ranged from $9-$13- dark choco lava cake- banana bruleeThe appetizers were nothing special. I should have chosen something else because both were fruit and cheese. But it was light and I thought it was promising for the rest of the food to come.The entrees were okay but nothing memorable. I've definitely had better food elsewhere for cheaper. The meat was tender but both entrees were on the saltier side. They also came with 4 vegetables (which was shared) but it's unlimited. It was carrot puree, taro root, butternut squash, and eggplant. While they all sound interesting, we didn't even finish the sides between the two of us.The dessert was okay. The choco lava cake was really dark and the coconut ice cream paired with it was light.The banana brulee is more of a banana pudding with a torched, sweet top. I like magnolia's banana pudding better.Total bill before tip was just under $120.One thing I noticed that they should stop doing is decorate the plate with stupid red powder. It looks unappetizing, ugly, and messy. They did this for every single plate that came out. Uneven red splotches around the perimeter of each plate. WHY? STOP IT. Way to ruin my asian-taking-food-pictures photos.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you're coming straight off the Holland tunnel.. and want something ""bougie"" to eat.

5.0,8/27/2013,"Definitely one of the top French restaurants in the city. We enjoyed the onion soup, the goat cheese tart, and the tournedos. Very heavy but also very delicious food. It is BYOB, however, the prices for the dishes are not marked up to compensate for the revenue from alcohol as it is the case for some other BYOB places. The only minor complaint I have is that they have the French name of the dishes followed by an English explanation on the menu. My wife ordered the Filet Mignon and there is only one dish called Filet Mignon on the menu. Yet, they brought her the tournedos because it says seared filet mignon in the explanation for the tournedos. A staff member than claimed it was her fault because that was the French and not the English name of the dish. First, if you have all the dishes listed in French on the menu and the English explanation always comes second then you cannot complain if your guests call the dishes by their French names when they order (some people in this country also speak French). Second, if their is anything unclear you can always ask a clarifying question. Third, you should never blame it on your guests as long as you are not 100% sure that it was their mistake. I still give the restaurant 5 stars because the food was outstanding, besides the confusion of the order the service was very efficient and impeccable, the staff member in charge of our table immediately apologized when he saw that the other person was arguing with us and the dessert was on the house. Just keep in mind to tell the waiter whether you want pork or beef should you ever order the filet mignon.",1,0,0,Fabian L.,"Manhattan, NY",6,49,1

There is a reason it has a near perfect rating on yelp - the food is absolutely spectacular! I don't even have the words to describe how incredible everything tasted. We had the goat cheese tart and escargot for apps. It was my husband's first time trying escargot, and with him being a picky seafood eater I half expected him to reject it after one bite, but he loved it! I ordered the blackened cod for the main course, and yes it was delicious as well. This place being a BYOB with no cork fee makes it even more dear to me.

3.0,8/13/2013,"I was super excited to try out this place having recently come back from Montreal where the French cuisine there was absolutely divine. We ordered the French onion soup, baby octopus, foie gras and escargot to start. The French onion soup, according to my dad was amazing. He orders this every time we eat out and I have never heard him compliment one before. The escargots were delicious and I wish I had asked for more bread to sop up the garlic sauce. Probably one of the best escargot I have had. The baby octopus was so tender and the mushrooms and sauce paired well with it. Squeezed on a lot of lemon and it was perfection. The foie gras was a disappointment. My family had never tried foie gras before and they were not impressed. I wasn't either, it lacked flavor and I didn't enjoy that it was cold although I knew beforehand that it would be cold. We then ordered the duck breast, flounder, quail and the rib eye. I was very surprised by how small the portions were considering how much I was paying for it. I wasn't expecting it to be humongous but it was certainly petite. Portion size aside, the food was delicious. I enjoyed my duck breast a lot and appreciated that it was cooked medium just the way I had asked for it. The rib eye was juicy and the sauce went very well with it. The quail was juicy and very tasty but there were literally 4 pieces the size of a baby carrot which really did not fill my mom up at all. The flounder was a bit dry and the sauce was a little too heavy. Overall good food but the portions were so small that I didn't feel like it was that worth it. I felt that the appetizers outshined the entrees and were more interesting. Service was good and attentive.",1,0,0,Joyce L.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,287,470

The food was very authentic and flavorful. My favorite food of the evening was the goat cheese tart. It was truffled out and sooooo good!  The escargot was pretty good (it seems like it would be hard to mess that one up though).  I must say that I found my duck breast to be a little too sweet, and the Kassulet Toulousain de la Maison was just not my thing. It was very heavy and very hot. It seemed to have every kind of food thrown in.For dessert, we had the Caramel merangue and the banana brulee. Both were very tasty!

In typical fat ass fashion, I smeared the cauliflower purée over my slices of tender beef and put a piece of squash in the middle of each bite. I loved this little trifecta I had going on.

4.0,7/22/2013,"I had a late dinner with my boyfriend on a Wednesday night. They were pretty empty but had 2-3 occupied tables. We sat right by the window. The restaurant's light were really dim, perfect for a romantic candlelight dinner if that's what you're looking for.The waiter was quick and prompt with the service. A good thing about La Sirene is that it's BYOB with no corkage fee. They even chill your wine for you while you eat which is a nice touch. We were both hungry that night and ordered a table-full of food. Starting with appetizers, we had mussels in curry broth, sauteed calamari and escargot. Everything was really delicious, but the dish that stood out the most for me was the calamari. It could actually be an entree in itself, the sauce was amazing and never hesitate to ask for more bread.For entrees, the boyfriend had what I called the hangover food - Kassulet Toulousain de la Maison, which had beans, carrots, bacon, duck confit, sausage all in duck fat and foie gras juice. Sounds pretty heavy huh? But it all worked, not to mention it's one of their signature dishes. I had their bass special of the night, really good fish they had there. I knew we were a bit behind on our appetizers, especially when you see the waiter and waitress coming by our table to see if we were done with the dishes. At that moment, I had a feeling our entrees were ready for us but we weren't exactly ready for it yet. What surprised me was how moist and tender my fish was even though it was probably sitting on a hotplate the entire time waiting for me.

The space is very limited, but the service is fantastic and the food will not disappoint you. It's BYOB, so look up the menu and decide on what you might like, and pick up a bottle or two from a wine shop beforehand to complement your proposed meal. It goes without saying, but there are no corkage fees or additional charges for having your own bottle. An additional bonus tip for you... make sure somebody in your party goes for the seared duck breast. Don't all get the filet mignon; somebody needs to be the hero and go for the duck breast, and give everyone else a bite.

5.0,7/4/2013,"Agreed with the Yelp consensus: this place is actually worth the hype. Probably some of the best French food I've had, and for reasonable prices as well.The food tends to be on the heavier side of things, but everything we got was delicious. For appetizers, the baby octopus salad, the escargot, and the ""chef's choice"" mussels were all amazing. I got the filet mignon with foie gras after seeing that practically everybody who gave this place 5 stars got that dish, and I will agree that it's incredibly well put-together. Even though the dish was heavy (thanks in part to the addictive truffle/red wine sauce), the portion was sized perfectly to make me feel happily full but not overstuffed by the end.One word of warning though: so many of the dishes come with such addictively delicious sauces that it will be very tempting to stuff your face with bread dipped in said sauces.

4.0,7/2/2013,"Going straight into the food discussion...For appetizer, I had the escargot and octopus, both excellent and highly recommended.  I wanted to be aggressive with the main course and went for the 'Warrior's Dish,' which unfortunately backfired.  It was too rich and had way too many beans - not a big fan.  The desserts more than made up for a lack of a suitable main course.  I had the profiteroles, banana brulee, and fondant au chocolat noir, each of which were some of the best dessert I've had in my life.  Solid, solid dessert selection, and had I chosen a tastier main course, I may have even given this place 5 stars.",1,0,1,Josh Q.,"San Francisco, CA",33,415,0
5.0,7/2/2013,"Loved this place! My tastebuds haven't been this pampered in a while.Ideal for a romantic evening out, or to catch up with an old friend that you haven't met in ages.Restaurant is very supportive of the BYOB policy, they have a wine list from a nearby store which literally delivers tableside (it's a tiny space). Staff treats the wine with the respect it deserves.Excellent service- very sweet yet professional. They really want you to relax and enjoy yourself.The food was super luxurious and plain delicious. App was mussels with curry and apple. If I had encountered this dish at home I would have gulped the liquid straight down and then licked the bowl clean. That good!Entree was the filet mignon with foie gras and shaved black truffles. I was worried that this might be overkill, but the filet was perfectly cooked and the balance was spot on. Tarte tatin (flambe) was also exceptional, as was the espresso.The best part- after we were done with dessert, stomachs bulging and eyes glazing over, the server tells us to relax and take our time to chat over coffee. Did I mention the service was excellent?My only issue - there's no La Sirene San Jose.",0,0,0,Rahul B.,"San Jose, CA",2,40,16

3.0,6/29/2013,"This a complicated review because there was many hits and misses' on my visit there. the food: 4 stars**** superb! goat cheese tart with truffle oil yum, curry mussels, escargot! We didn't try any entree's because my group preferred not to eat meat so we stuck to the appetizers and shared it tapas style. I found it strange there were no sides on the menu (""unlimited veggies"" come with the entrees only)ambience: 2 stars** decor was off, it was more like eating at a friends house were mom doesn't care much for interior design. The back room looked nothing like the front room and besides a few anchors here and there it lacked a common theme. The menus had ""Curlz MT"" font on the header. service: 3 stars***... there were three servers around one girl was very very good and attentive. the others were sometimes hard to get a hold of. value: 5 stars****... BYOB!!!!for $40 per person we ate like kings and each brought our own wine bottle. They can also arrange to have a bottle delivered for you at the table.All in all I had a great time and I definitely recommend for groups or casual date with the BF when you want good food but don't want to break the bank.  Would not bring out of towners here.Would def go back on a weeknight when your craving good food, glass of wine, and a drink with an old friend.

It's basically egg whites floating in a sort of custard and drizzled with caramel sauce.  Not many places serve this dessert and others get it wrong.  The egg whites and caramel were soft and fluffy (not hard and crunchy) and the custard was perfect.And to make a great experience even better, it's BYOW; you call the liquor store from the restaurant and they deliver!  WOW!  This place is definitely on my REPEAT and RECOMMEND list!",0,0,0,Rose S.,"Waltham, MA",1,48,1
2.0,6/26/2013,"Disappointing. I wanted to love this place, but unfortunately that never happened. First off, we were planning to arrive at the restaurant around 10:30 after seeing a musical (Kinky Boots, it was amazing!) So we called before hand and asked if there would be a time issue. The man on the phone was rude, and when we implied that we would go elsewhere if there was an inconvenience, he replied by saying we would be the last customers and they would ""serve us anyways"". Umm..okay thanks...   We arrive around 10:15 and are barely greeted by the hostess who gives us a bad look (probably for keeping her from going home early) We are seated and given menus and in 3 minutes she comes back and asks what we would like to order. Wow, 3 minutes to decide what to order, she was obviously desperate to go home. We order the white wine mussels , my mother orders the duck breast and I order the steak. No drinks, no bread, no smile. The mussels arrive and they are....ehh. Not the best I've had but not the worst. But wait...where's the bread? ""Sorry there's no more left"" are you kidding me? No more bread? I know we are the last of the customers ( there was 3 other groups dining) but shouldn't they keep enough bread to serve the whole night? Okay whatever, she takes our mediocre mussels off the table and we wait for our entrees. And wait. And wait. And still our rude waitress has not offered us drinks! We order some and she reluctantly brings them to us. 30 minutes has gone by and we still have no entrees. Not like the chefs were busy or anything, by this time the last customer is signing his check. Finally we get our entrees, and a plate of vegetable purées that come with it. My mother likes her duck and the vegetables are great, but I'm not thrilled about my dish. Not bad but I definitely expected more from a place with such high status. My steak is too salty(and I love salt) and barely warm, coldish in some places. We finish our food and promptly leave, not even getting a goodbye from the hostess/waitress. Overall the dining experience was lacking and rushed, the food mediocre and the staff (just one waitress/hostess) rude and clearly ill-equipped in her training of how to treat a guest properly.

The filet itself was cooked perfectly, but the the extra bit of heaven on top...Yum. Only disappointment was dessert, which was the Meringue, Caramel and Almond. Not what I'd expected...a bit soggy. But the entree and appetizer MORE than made up for it. Service!BYOBBYOBBYOB. And not just that....the server was so elegant in serving our wine.

Second, for my birthday.Third, for the day before mother's day. For apps, we always order the escargot and mussels with white wine. I hate mussels. Except in this place where they are orgasmic. DIP THE BREAD IN THE ESCARGOT AND MUSSELS SAUCES!Entrees: I've personally had the Filet Mignon, Hanger Steak, and the just recently added Seared Rib Eye with Peppercorn sauce. (Apparently I was, if not the first, one of the first people to actually have it :D) They were the best steaks I've ever had, and the vegetables are just ridiculously good.My mom has had the duck three times, so, well, yeah. She loves it.As for the rest of my family, they have had the lamb, and the Cod fish filet with saffron, also amazing.Okay, while all the apps and entrees are awesome, the desserts do not disappoint either.

NOW.Chocolate Lava with Coconut Sorbet+Raspberry Sauce - *Tear gently rolls down cheek in remembrance of that amazing dessert*Still waiting to try the Choux Chantilly and Meringue dessert, but for now, it's too hard to stray away.Well while the food is great, something has to be said about the impeccable service as well.The first time we came, we were early by 20 minutes.

Very good but a touch salty. 4 - quail. Great sauce but the problem w quail is its a small bird and not the easiest to cut all the meat out - nor can u really pick up like a chicken wing at a French resto. 4 - veggies free unlimited w entree. 3.5 - goat cheese tart - looks like a scrambled egg, and nothing that special imo despite the rave reviews.

5.0,4/8/2013,"We got the Tournedos Rossini (filet mignon with foie gras).  I thought it was really great- my medium rare was done perfectly, and if you like foie gras, it's a really neat touch.  I was actually much more into the side vegis though- the pureed/mashed carrots were addictive, and the brussel sprouts were good too (though both tasted too good to be healthy- probably lots of butter in there).  We also got the Big Profiterolles for dessert which I definitely recommend.  Overall- really good experience, great service, and cute restaurant setting.",0,0,0,Jessica T.,"Manhattan, NY",279,214,551
5.0,4/2/2013,"big fan of la sirene :)  here are the reasons why:1.  b.y.o.b.:  i was the first to arrive in our party and decided to look for a glass of wine to order then i saw ""b.y.o.b. with no corkage fee"" and thought, wait, am i dreaming?!  and wait, where am i going to get my booze?!  luckily my friend's boyfriend came equipped with 2 bottles of wine.  we were good for the rest of dinner :) 2.  unlimited veggies with entree:  i was able to unleash my inner vegetarian and had as many plates of veggies as my little heart desired!  from mashed carrots, brussel sprouts, string beans, and some sort of beet(?).  i was extremely satisfied.  3.  excellent food:  i got the sea bass and it was beautifully presented with light and not overbearing flavor with great sauce.  i tried my friend's filet and foie and it's definitely worth ordering as well (had i not have steak scheduled the following night i would definitely have ordered the steak).  4.  excellent dessert:  lets not mention we ended the dinner with banana creme brulee and sorbet.  the banana creme brulee was a hybrid of banana pudding and creme brulee, definitely devoured this one.  the sorbet assortment (coconut, mango, berries) were excellent!  you can definitely tell they're homemade.  the flavors were excellent :)  5.  reasonable:  with entree, unlimited veggies, bread, and dessert we paid $40/person.  i mean, unheard of in this city that literally rapes my wallet.  i thought i had to pay an arm and a leg for dinner, but nope, not at la sirene.  highly reco this restaurant for an intimate get together/dinner.  i really can't think of anything i can complain about ;)p.s. cash/check only!",6,6,6,Alice C.,"Irvine, CA",2013,1250,651
4.0,4/2/2013,"French, cozy, intimate, romantic are a few words to describe La Sirene. It encapsulates all of this within a small space. If you're looking for a quality French restaurant for a special occasion, with family or a date, consider La Sirene. A French bistro located in a quiet part of the downtown Village area, it's the perfect venue for a special, intimate meal. Dimmed lights, candles, and music provide mood and ambiance. Come prepared though; it is BYO and cash only. Pretentious it may sound and appear, but La Sirene provides a balance of character when it comes to their food and service. It's refined but still keeps it casual and chill. You should expect waits. The space is small and retains a constant flow of customers in/out. My advice is to reserve, especially on certain weeknights/weekends.I was excited to try La Sirene for my wedding anniversary. My husband and I reserved a 7PM dinner for a Monday evening, and while it was quite early in the week, the restaurant was fully occupied. I appreciated the atmosphere. It was minimally decorative, and warm, dim lighting helped create an intimate mood. We brought our own bottle of red; no corkage fee applies. For appetizers, we ordered a half dozen roasted escargots in butter/garlic sauce, and the goat cheese tart with shallots, truffles, grape and 180 year old aged Swiss cheese. The escargot and the cheese tart were amazing, rich in flavors and succulent in every bite. Although they are the perfect portion for sharing, you will indeed fight over that last bite. For main course, I went with the Tournedos Rossini, a seared filet mignon with foie gras while my husband chose the signature seared hanger steak with garlic and parsley sauce. The portion sizes here are smaller than you'd expect; they are certainly French and petite. If you plan to order a steak, don't anticipate a big one. Our entrees were fantastic both in presentation and taste. I have to say the filet mignon was so most moist and soft that my knife just slid through it like butter. With your entrees, they provide you with an unlimited small platter of various vegetable purees; sweet potato, chayote, eggplant, and carrot. These sides were the perfect complement to our meal. We ended up ordering 2 helpings. To top all things off, we had some dessert, namely the Fondant Au Chocolat Noir, a dark lava chocolate cake with coconut sherbet. A glorious and rich dessert this was, and ever since, I have fallen in love with lava cakes.There were a few minor slip-ups. Our waiter accidentally brought us someone else's appetizer at the start, but luckily it was just a mix up. Our bread and vegetable tray came a little late into the meal. We were already 1/3 into our steak when the vegetables arrived. All in all though, La Sirene offers quite an experience, and it was a perfect/excellent choice for a wedding anniversary date. It's not an overstated venue, but it's classy enough for the most special of occasions. I would recommend to anyone, but just be prepared that if you're looking for a wine list and plan to use your flashy credit card, they only take cash and it is BYO.",3,1,1,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",721,552,3545
5.0,4/1/2013,"Had great service and great food!  The BYOB is def a perk but they seem to limit tables to one bottle; we noticed the table next to us milking the seats and the waiter said something about a time limit on tables.  Fortunately, we were a late table and ordered apps, meals and desserts and were able to open two bottles of one.  I work in the industry so was able to notice when the checked the POS tab before coming to open our second bottle which had been on the table for the past 15 minutes with our glasses empty 3/4 of the way through our dinner.",0,0,0,Angela W.,"FRESH MEADOWS, NY",0,3,0

4.0,3/17/2013,"What a fabulous French dining experience!  Didier (aforementioned in many reviews, he is the owner of La Sirene, Taureau next door and Table Verte) was on site to sit with us and helped us choose our meal options.  He explained the origin of each item and helped us pair different items that would likely complement one another.  The goat cheese tart was amazing and each bite was rich, decadent and savory.  I ordered this as an appetizer, but it would have filled me up if this was my main course.  I chose the Seared Hanger Steak for my main meal and also sampled my friend's filet mignon (Tournedos Rossini on the menu).  The Hanger Steak was cooked to perfection and each bite oozed buttery goodness.  I am quite particular to the Hanger Steak VS the Filet Mignon, which was good, but I really liked my Hanger Steak.  Probably shouldn't have eaten dessert since we were so full before we even started the appetizers, but we ordered anyway.  We ended with a creme brulee and 3 different scoops of ice cream flavors.  The vanilla ice cream was extremely memorable and smooth.  I don't recall the other 2 flavors we tried.  I'll definitely be back, even if it is just for that amazing goat cheese tart.  The service was en pointe and everyone we were in contact with had a smile on their face.  The prices are very good and you really get your money's worth in terms of quality.  A fabulous date night option!",0,0,0,Crystine W.,"New York, NY",773,1215,283

Taking constructive criticism and responding shows a care and concern that few restaurants care to do. For that you get 5 stars.

5.0,3/8/2013,"This is one of the few byo places in the city that falls on the fancier side and allows reservations for large parties. I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday  with about 10 people. The place isn't incredibly large, so it was a little crowded for the amount of people in our party. However, the restaurant had a really nice ambiance and the waitstaff was very accommodating all night. For some reason, the thing I remember the most is the bread. We kept on asking for refills because it was really crusty, soft and delicious. I would go back just for the bread basket ha. I also loved the all-you-can-eat veggies and sauces. They were really unique, fresh and delicious. When it came to choosing an entree, true to form, I HAD to opt for the foie gras filet mignon. Just as I expected, it was extremely rich and therefore delicious. I also tried a bite of the baked seafood, which was also quite delicious!!We basically closed out the restaurant but never felt rushed at any point.

Needed an extra fork? Had to ask twice. Refill on waters? Also, had to ask multiple times. The restaurant wasn't overly-crowded to warrant the slow service.I had the tilapia with peppercorn sauce which was bland. The pureed vegetables were not pleasant either.

2.0,3/6/2013,"My fiancée and I went here over the weekend to celebrate our anniversary. We had visited once before and had been to the owner's other restaurant, Taureau, a couple of times as well. These dining experiences had all been wonderful-the food was delicious, the waiting staff friendly, and meeting Didier showed how much he cares about his restaurants. This time, however, the experience prompted me to write this negative review. Unlike the last time we had dined here, there is now a new policy that limits reservations to only 2 hours. Due to circumstances outside of our control, we were about 35 minutes late to our 7:00 pm reservation. While we were notified upon arrival that our reservation was still technically until 9:00pm, we still expected that we would be able to enjoy our meal and be treated with respect even if completing our meal meant going a few minutes over the time limit. We ordered our appetizers and entrées, which understandably took some time to be prepared, and we were not done with our main course until a few minutes before 9:00pm. At this point one of the servers brought us the dessert menu and we were relieved that we would not feel pressured to gulp down the rest of our wine and leave without having one of their great desserts. Then a man whom I thought was a server came over to take our dessert order, waiting until we had ordered one of the menu items to announce that because we had been late for our reservation, we did not have time to eat dessert. He claimed we had been one hour late, which was not only a vast exaggeration but extremely rude. When I asked to see his manager, he proceeded to nastily tell us that he was the manager and that we would not be having any dessert that night. He then grabbed our menus from us and immediately brought us the check, slamming it down on the table without so much of an apology.While the food remains as delicious as we remembered, we were appalled by the way we were treated and left the restaurant with a sour note to our anniversary dinner. As someone who also works in the food industry, I found this behavior completely unacceptable and highly unprofessional. Why give us the dessert menu if ordering was never an option? It makes me wonder if we had not been done with our entrees, would we have been shoved out the door mid-bite? This certainly could have been handled in a more polite and tactful manner.

I take my wife rather than going with two of my buddies2. I order the pork rather than the beefThe atmosphere was ""romantic"" to say the least--very dim, hearts, and cupids on the walls.  While it wasn't my favorite atmosphere for dinner with two other male colleagues from work, I appreciate that it would be a fantastic atmosphere for dinner with my wife.  The food was GREAT.  My favorite dish was the goat cheese tart.  I've never had anything like it before, and I enjoyed every bite.  It had a very rich flavor, but the salad on the side perfectly complemented the cheese tart.  Finally, the filet mignon and the foie gras were wonderfully cooked and seasoned.  The only aspect of the meal that holds me back from giving La Sirene a five-star rating was the sauce.  It wasn't my favorite flavor (although I think it was well made), and I thought there was too much of it.  The sauce dominated the meat at times; I think I would have preferred the meat to dominate and the sauce to complement.  The dish was still great, but I think I would try the pork dish if I ever had the opportunity to come again.",0,0,0,Ben M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",58,111,1

The waiter was kind enough to wait for me to return from the bathroom to bring the flambee out. The biggest negative is that they forgot the ice cream altogether (which would have helped offset the spicy rum) -- we both didn't say anything but this definitely spoiled the dessert!)Overall, just an A-OK experience.

When we sat down we noticed the 2 water glasses and 2 wine glasses were VERY dirty. Not just fingerprints, but dirty fingerprints. Whatever we can just ask for clean ones. Not so easy...So after we sat, there was a huge line at the door of the restaurant, which we were sitting very close to. People kept the doors open so it was FREEZING inside. A couple came in about 15 minutes after us, right when they sat down they got bread and cheese, we didn't. After about 20 minutes of trying to get someones attention, we FINALLY got our glasses switched and our wine bottle open. About 15 minutes later we got the bread and cheese, at this point we've already been at this restaurant for over 30 minutes.After we got the bread/cheese combo we waited another 20 minutes to finally order. For appetizers we order the escargot and goat cheese tart. Both were delicious! These came out within 10 minutes, pretty quick to a very slow day so far. We finished our appetizers pretty quickly, because we were STARVING at this point.Again we waited about 30 minutes for our entree's to come out. I got the Tournedos Rossini, and my wife got some casserole looking dish. Her's was VERY heavy, and not very good, compared to my filet.At this point our wine was finished, because we had already been in the restaurant for around 2 hours. Desserts came out pretty slow again, but were very good.After coming here I realized I shouldn't come here for Valentine's Day ever again, because it was freezing, slower then molasses, dirty, people were getting upset, etc.If you come here make sure you don't wear anything you want to wear again, after being at this restaurant for over 2.5 hours, my jacket smelled like a french ducks butt for about 4-5 days after dinner.

3.0,2/10/2013,"I really wanted to love La Sirene.  In theory, a nice intimate, French, BYO sounds great.  In execution, I was disappointed.They made us order all of our food upfront which I thought was an indication that the food would come very slowly.  Boy, was I wrong.  Our appetizers came extremely quickly and they were piping hot.  Usually, I enjoy my food very temperature hot; however, this time it was TOO much.  The french onion soup burned my tongue pretty badly.  The soup was pretty good--mostly due to the excessive amount of of melted cheese.  The escargots were decent.  We were still in the middle of finishing our appetizers when the entrees arrived.  Suffice it to say, we were stuffed because we had to eat everything in such a short time.   The goat cheese tart was tasty, albeit very heavy.  I could only take very small bites at a time due to how rich it was.  The cassoulet was nice.  Although we were full, we felt the need to try the famed profiteroles.  They were ok.  I was not super impressed.  Overall, the food is fine, the staff is very nice and competent, and the atmosphere is attractive.  I definitely would not go out of my way to come here.",2,0,0,Julie M.,"New York, NY",256,553,27

5.0,2/2/2013,"Although I absolutely love Yelp, I am well aware that ratings can become skewed by single-time reviewers.  Therefore, I remain a bit wary when I visit restaurants with an exceedingly good review. La Sirene's 4.5 star rating, however, is warranted in every way.Two of my friends and I have been dying to try La Sirene for ages.  After several rescheduled attempts, we finally were able to coordinate and came here for dinner on a cold and severely windy Thursday night.  We stopped by Wine Hut, a few blocks away, to pick up a couple nice bottles of vin since La Sirene is byob.  Upon our arrival to the restaurant, we were greeted warmly by our waitress who offered to immediately open our bottles for us.  We started with the chilled bottle of Sauvignon Blanc while we let the Pinot Noir breathe. There was no corkage fee, which wins major brownie points.  After a few moments, we placed our orders.  One of my friends and I had the special of the day, which was a seared black sea bass entree. Our other, more adventurous dining companion had the roasted quail.  All entrees come with the chef's selection of market vegetables and are unlimited.  What a great incentive for someone like me to eat more veggies!  When our food arrived, I was tempted to dig in at once.  But girls being girls, my dates were animatedly complaining about billiards clubs and I didn't want to be rude by starting first.  After what seemed like an eternity, my friend picked up her fork and I breathed a sigh of relief as I got the green light to feast. The sea bass was cooked wonderfully, the meat was tender and flaky.  Accompanied by a slightly tangy beurre blanc sauce and crispy wedges of potato gratin cake, it was the perfect marriage of flavors and textures.  The seasonal vegetables of the night were eggplant, chayote, yellow squash and pureed sweet potato.  Each of them were equally buttery and delicious.My friends and I had such a relaxing time catching up and drinking wine that we stayed there well past midnight.  Our waitress was very engaging and jovial, making small talk with us the whole night.  With the amazing service, food and ambiance, it truly reminded me of some of my favorite meals in Paris.

The recommended this restaurant and we were skeptical at first especially since im not a big heavy French food person. But since yelp said it's 4.5 stars, I knew I had to try it! The place is pretty small but cozy. I ordered the seafood bake and my fiancé ordered the special of the night seared ahi tuna with potato cake. The couple both ordered the steak with foie gras medium rare. We were given bread basket of sour dough. nothing special, wish it was served warm! The food didn't take long and were served with all you can veggie sides! My fav was the carrot purée and butternut squash. I shamelessly asked for 3 refills. I think I actually enjoyed the sides more than my main course. It was good just not memorable. i wish they were better at refilling the sides too since it's all you can eat sides. My fiancé and the couple enjoyed their dishes. We ended our date with apple flambé tart and cheese platter. The apple tart was served fresh from the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

3.0,1/19/2013,"Cozy and dimly lit, La Sirene was a lovely place to enjoy a chilly winter's evening.  Our waitress was attentive and ever pleasant, and the food was comforting and well executed.  Highlights included the tartelette appetizer, which artfully showcased the pungent aromas of goat cheese (not for the faint of palate).  The steamed mussels with curry and diced apples seemed a bit daunting, but the curry was beautifully balanced and added just enough notes of contrast without transforming the mussels into something completely unrecognizable.The mains were satisfying, finding its strength in its simplicity and boldness of flavours.  The seared filet mignon topped with foie gras was executed nicely, with a rich sauce that was able to stand up to the brazenly refreshing piece of fois (yes, ""refreshing"" in a fatty sumptuous goodness sort of way).  I don't think I am the best person to comment on the cassoulet since I already have an pre-existing aversion towards beans (and a good serving of cannellini beans there were!), but at the very least I can say that the beans were cooked properly.  My wife wasn't entirely impressed with the remaining flavour profiles of the proteins, but I thought the one piece of slab bacon she slid over was pretty darn tasty.I think it's funny, though, how the side vegetables was what really caught my attention.  There were two purees that were just so intensely silken and flavourful, that I was not surprised to hear that the secret to making them so was BUTTER.  They are unlimited (score!) but the mains are all so satisfying and the sides so rich, you probably will be fine with just one order.The desserts were well executed, but again, nothing to write home about.  The profiteroles were in my opinion too much ice cream, not enough pastry.  The dark lava chocolate cake had the perfect consistency of molten chocolate oozing out from within, but the coconut sherbet stole the show and is essentially what made that dessert worth ordering.",0,0,0,Dan T.,"New York, NY",111,430,157
5.0,1/17/2013,"BYOB wine and excellent French food? YES PLEASE!!  There's only a few BYOB spots in Manhattan and this place is my absolute favorite.Appetizers:-Escargots a la Bourguignone (Roasted Escargots with Butter and Garlic sauce): I know the idea of eating snails is queasy, but the way that La Sirene cooks the escargots is heavenly.  The butter & garlic sauce isn't so overpowering and there is a delicate taste.  There are many other French restaurants I've been to where the escargots were drenched in butter and garlic that I'm sure I gained 5 lbs and was able to ward off any bloodthirsty vampires (if they existed).-Moules Marinieres(Steamed Mussels in White Wine and Fresh Herbs): Absolutely delicious and plus side: the broth is a great dipping sauce for the bread.Entree:-Magret de Canard Poele Sauce Montmorency (Seared Moulard Duck Breast with Cherry, Port and Red Wine Sauce): AHMAZING. The duck was tender and juicy, and I didn't realize that the sauce would be so delicious.  It is sweet, but definitely not to the point where you feel like you are eating a dessert, not an entree. Same plus side: you can definitely use whatever sauce you have leftover from the duck as a dipping sauce for the bread.  Note:  This place is CASH ONLY so please be sure to go to the ATM beforehand.  Also, not a lot of liquor/wine stores closeby, so plan accordingly.Bon appetit!!",2,0,1,Sarah L.,"Los Angeles, CA",215,176,93

Even past 9pm, there were people waiting for tables.If I could do it all again, I would have just ordered a few appetizers to share with my bf and call it a meal. Our entrees were VERY heavy. We swore off heavy food for about a week and lived off salads and fruits until our stomachs recovered. We typically eat pretty light so this heavy meal was a real punch to the gut.

Then he came back after a minute or two and took my friend's dish as well, saying that it wasn't what he'd ordered, even though it definitely was. He also didn't ask if my friend had eaten any of it, so I hope no one else got it (my friend hadn't touched it, but just on principle). When he came back a while later with the correct food, it was obvious my friend had been served the correct dish to begin with--not sure if he got his same plate back or if it was a new one, but we were very confused as to what had happened. Anyway, I say this because I can see how if this were my first experience it might have colored my opinion of the restaurant after reading all the glowing reviews on yelp, but the food was still awesome as was the overall experience & my friend and I both still enjoyed our meals.

3.0,11/30/2012,"I'm not sure what the big deal is about this place.  First of all, the place is small, which is fine if there were only 10 tables, which I originally thought was the case but I'm not sure if the restaurant recently expanded or just added 10 more tables in an already small space to meet demand.  Secondly, the place needs a better vent.  The entire place smelled like smoke (open kitchen), which in turn made all its diners smell like food upon leaving -- not really what I was hoping for especially if I'm spending more than $100 for the total bill.  If you have asthma or COPD, this may not be the best place to dine.  Third, I took my boyfriend here for his birthday thinking that it was a romantic place where we can chit chat easily, but it was definitely not the case!  Since the tables were about 6 inches apart from each other, we can hear everyone's conversation and it was difficult to converse properly without having to scream or talk loudly!  As for the food, compared to some places I've been to outside of NYC, this was a huge disappointment!  The bread was cold and stale and the dip was boring -- just olive oil with balsamic vinaigrette (c'mon! do something a little more interesting if you're charging so much for the meals!).  We started with the mussels, which were fabulous (probably the only thing worth getting at this place) -- broth was very tasty, we got the ""classic one"" -- white wine with herbs.  Our entrees were the quail and lamb chop.  Quail was good but annoying to eat.  We went for dinner and since the place was already low lit, it was hard for me to cut the meat off of the tiny little bones.  It would have been better and more enjoyable if the meat was already off the bone, that way I didn't have to waste time figuring out if what I'm cutting was the bone or meat.  Lamb chop was tasty but not praise worthy -- it was good but nothing unique and definitely not worth $30!  Might as well make your own lamb chop at home and it will probably taste the same if not better.  Dessert was not bad -- I forgot the name of it but it was the meringue with almonds.  It's tasty and very light, which was great... but again nothing really spectacular.  Unless they do something about that vent or they make the place quieter and relaxing, I will not be returning anytime soon.  Sorry for the bad review.",0,0,0,Anna L.,"Arlington, VA",35,23,0
3.0,11/27/2012,"Pros: cute, cozy, french bistro ambiance, BYOBCons: unimpressive food...Tips: Cash only!I am actually very sad that I am giving 3 stars... The place has a very cute, cozy, romantic ambiance that would work great for any couples. :) The wine delivery was very fast and he was able to suggest the wines that would work well for our meals. The problem was the food; this review is limited to pre-fixe that you can order during Mon - Thurs between 5-6pm for $30. The pre-fixe is a great deal and I purposefully gathered with my friends that could get off work at 5 pm to go to this place. When we got there, it was EMPTY, btw. I had the followings;- Roasted Beets: the portion was really huge... After a couple of bites, you get tired of the mildly sweet beets and there's nothing else to excite my pallette other than the same beet flavor... I did not even finish half of it...- Large Mussels: I mean, you cannot really go wrong with this, can you? They were OK. Nothing impressive. I could've gotten wider selection of flavors to choose from for broth, but they only had three. - Raspberry Sorbet: tasted like raspberry... nothing special... I heard the french onion soup was good actually. You might want to try it... Overall, I did not like the food at all... Maybe I should come back for regular dinner?",2,1,1,Lindsey S.,"Manhattan, NY",228,115,164

5.0,11/26/2012,"Be still my heart. Is this love? I'm still at a loss for words. La Sirene has got me tongue tied even until now. The food is so amazing I can still taste it in my mouth. Can we say unassuming? This little piece of heaven in Tribeca has given me one of the best meals I've had in New York City. You cant even tell that it's there. It's tucked away in a random street that looks just like any other. It's tiny, so simple and straightforward. The food on the other hand, out of this world. I came here for dinner on a busy Saturday night. The tiny restaurant was packed and there were people lined up outside waiting to be seated. Thank god I made reservations! This place is BYOB so I was prepared with a nice bottle of Malbec. We were seated at a small but quaint table near the back. The lovely hostess immedately took our wine and opened it for us. Their menu was fantastic. Everything sounded amazing I could not decide.We ordered the mussels to start our French adventure. It was delectable. The broth was perfection, very light but full of flavor. The mussels big and juicy. I wished that the pot would never run out of mussels. I saw the table next to us had duck confit but I could not resist the steak. I got the hanger steak and my date got the star of the show...  Tournedos Rossini (Seared Filet Mignon over Bread Toasted with Foie Gras Pate-Style, Shallots, Port & Red Wine Truffle).Let's talk about my dish first. I am a huge fan of hanger steaks. This steak is cooked with roasted garlic and parsley sauce with potatoes on the side. The meat was perfect. Melt in your mouth goodness indeed! I loved the sauce, really balanced not too salty but he parsley kicks in a breathe of freshness to the dish. It almost reminded me of Cuban steaks cooked in chimichurri sauce. I thought this steak was good, but I tried my date's steak and it knocked my socks off! Filet with foi gras and red wine reduction and truffle sauce. How can you not love this?! It has all of the ebst things int he entire world put in one plate! The meat was luscious, tender, almost buttery. Perfect with the foi gras drizzled with savory truffle wine sauce. It is seriously orgasmic. Our dinner was so good we did not say a single word to each other until we finished all our food. And after we almost licked out plates off, we sat there looking at each other with our our eyes popping out of our heads in disbelief. We did some ""Oh-My-Gods"" in unison and then laughed because it was so good and we were being a tad bit dramatic. But for very good reason!We still dream about this place and everytime we eat steak, we compare it to La Sirene. Peter Luger's got nothing on them. We also always think about going back. If they had a drive through we would be there everyday and we always joke that we can eat that steak everyday for the rest of our lives. The food is good and extremely reasonably priced.  Eating here was quite an experience. Even though it was a small and simple place the wild ride that their food will take you through will leave you breatheless. If you want an unforgettable dining experience solely because of the food, then make your reservations at La Sirene.",5,3,2,Abby S.,"New York, NY",284,227,1
4.0,11/20/2012,"I must admit that the hype is deserved.  I headed to La Sirene for a casual dinner with fellow wine lovers.  After reading the reviews on Yelp, I was excited but also worried that I'd be disappointed.  In the end, I had no reason to worry.  The food last night was top notch.  I started with the Moules Rochelaises (Steamed Mussels with Curry, Diced Apples and Light Cream), which were fabulous.  The curry was just right and the addition of diced apples added great contrasts.  I fought hard to stop myself from mopping up all the sauce with my bread, but I knew what was coming next.  My entree was the Kassulet Toulousain de la Maison (Cassoulet, Cannellini Beans, tomato, Garlic Duck Confit, Slab Bacon & Pork sausage all Braised with Noble Duck Fat).   I'm a huge fan of Cassoulet and I've eaten my fair share of it; this was not the best I've ever had--but it was easily in my top three and I will return to enjoy it again.  The service was excellent with no rush from the servers, yet always there when we needed them.  The wine service was very good (even though we usually handle our own bottles).  The glasses were smaller than I'd like, but seriously, there's no corkage, so who am I to complain.All in all, I had a great experience and would highly recommend this spot to any fan of French food and wine.

I love that they are BYOB, we came ready with a bottle of red and a bottle of white. We started off with French Onion soup, then sharing 2 orders of escargots and a big pot of Curry mussels.  I am usually not a big fan of French onion soup but really enjoyed this one, the cheese was rich and thick. Escargots - YUM!! The mussels were ok - broth was flavorful but the mussels itself was small. Onto the entrees, I had the tilapia special (loved, loved, loved it!), my husband had filet mignon topped with fioe gras (melts in your mouth!). I didn't get to try my friend's lamb chops but she said it was good. My other friend who ordered Cassoulet Toulouse's Style was disappointed with his entree, he didn't like it.

5.0,10/7/2012,"I heard too many great things about this place and I HAVE TO TRY IT!!! La Sirene came to be the top French restaurant here other than Balthazar.. I am so glad they take reservations and 8.30pm on a Friday night is not a problem..Getting out from the subway station and I was way too confused with all the road at the west side.. Thanks to I phone.. alright.. enough of my story and I will go straight to my review..Starting off with 2 appetizer.. 1) the octopus 2) the mussels (chef recommendation).. The octopus was baked with some greens and mushrooms which made it awesome.. I always love french food because it wasn't that filling and yet good enough to enjoy! and as for the mussels.. There are apples in it which made it slightly different.. The mussels were so fresh.. I think I can see myself keep eating it and will not get sick of it.. The soup goes really nice with the complimentary bread they served..I was kinda full after appetizer.. Thank goodness the entree wasn't that big.. We ordered the specialty (I think it's tilapia.) and duck breast with red wine sauce.. This is probably the best duck breast that was cooked in medium rare, and yet I LOVE IT!!! I usually love my food to be medium well to well done.. just because I feel like eating raw meat kinda gross me out.. but since the chef recommend it medium rare.. I will just go with it.. As for the tilapia.. It's also really fresh and flavorful.. not too salty like most of the restaurants.. Desserts... There's always room for it.. So we ordered the chocolate lava which takes 12 minutes to baked it.. came with home made cream, home-made coconut ice-cream, home-made jam.. I asked something really silly to the waitress.. ""EVERYTHING HOMEMAD??"".. she goes like ""yes... everything was made by us"".. I guess this is what makes La Sirene so special because it's located slightly further from the tourist spot.. It's more cozy and it's not that noisy.. Oh.. The chocolate lava is always good..It's BYOB.. so bring a bottle of wine to enjoy with your food!!!

1.0,10/6/2012,"I'm under the impression that if a reservation is made, it should be honored with an ACCOMMODATING table.  When my husband and I arrived for our reservation time, the hostess showed us to a two-top squished in between two other tables with only 4-6 inches on each side.  Neither of us are overweight people but there's no way even the Olsen twins could have squeezed in there. Assuming people to sit at that table wasn't just unfair to us but would have made for an uncomfortable night for those other tables too - unless they decided they really wanted to turn those romantic dinners into commune-style eating with strangers right on top of them.Shame on you, La Sirene for being greedy and trying to cram more people than you can fit.   ""Very nicely arranged"" - what a crock.  They can take their duck and SHOVE IT...in that tiny space without us - we won't be back.",0,0,0,Michele N.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,33,0

4.0,9/25/2012,"I'd been meaning to come here for some time, chiefly due to their very high marks on Yelp. So when my parents were visiting this past Sunday and we were wandering around SoHo, I took the opportunity, figuring it would be a slow evening. Even at 6 on Sunday, most tables were filled, with a fairly large and boisterous party of Russians taking  up the second room (there are only 25 seats total).We sat by the window in the small and unpretentious (though not cheap-looking) dining room and were attended to by a pleasant waitress who rattled off the info about their seasonal veggies (refillable small plate of pureed carrots, cauliflower, zucchini, and some Mexican parsnip) with the speed of an auctioneer. I ordered baked seafood for my mom and the lamb leg for my dad, who characteristically made sarcastic remarks based on the portion price:size ratio. I didn't try the baked seafood, but I tried my dad's lamb, which was cooked medium but was still bloody delicious.For myself, I took the Kassulet Toulousain de la Maison challenge. Our waitress seemed ecstatic that I was prepared to dig into this hearty mound of peasant favorites: cannellini beans, tomato, and garlic duck confit up top, with slabs of bacon, and pork sausage swimming beneath, all braised with duck fat. I think I had a cassoulet before, but this one is definitely more memorable. I would reserve it for a hungry occasion and a cool night. This is some good  French country eating! That said, the dish fills you up for weeks, so on my next visit I would try something a little less gut-busting.The place is BYOB but I was sick and my dad was driving, so we didn't bring any booze. The waitress was sweet enough to give us some leftover wine they kept in a fridge from a different party. Apparently people routinely bring too much wine, especially on Fri and Sat nights, when there is a 2 or 2.5 hour time limit on tables.Even with the BYOB policy, expect high tabs. Also, expect a long wait. They said 20-25 minutes for entrees but it felt much longer and we didn't get appetizers. I suspect my cassoulet was the culprit. Overall, a very pleasant bistro, though likely overrated due to disappointments with the glut of New York's other French venues. But the chef clearly has good hands, and it comes through in the output.",1,0,1,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2506,1716,229
4.0,9/22/2012,"French bistros are my guilty pleasure. Few categories of restaurants are as generally reliable. Service is usually amiable but unobtrusive. Chances are it will be on the smaller side, and if it's good, there's an even greater likelihood that the regulars who dine there will make having reservations a necessity rather than a luxury. La Sirene labels itself a modern bistro, but the only modern element is the decor. That is not to say there is much decor to speak of: there is not. Rather, what is there tends more towards tastefully appointed than distractingly flamboyant. This incongruity is not meant as a slight, however. I for one couldn't be happier that the label of modern bistro is ill-suited for the venue. Modernity has come to represent incessant faux innovation for the sake of it. Modern French bistros, by extension, are more a misguided distillation of genuine bistros; lacking in comfort, steeped in pretension. La Sirene is a welcome reminder of what a good bistro was, is, and should be.The night Amanda J and I came felt remarkably Parisian. Light summer rain lent a mugginess to the walk over, hindering the glow of the streetlights to a transient, flickering radiance. Even the strangely arranged intersection of Broome and Canal seemed decidedly French. In true bistro fashion, La Sirene is terribly easy to walk past unwittingly. Upon entering, we were welcomed warmly, and seated quickly, though we were actually given a chance to voice our preferences in terms of seating. Fine dining is in a poor state when being asked whether you'd like to be seated nearer the kitchen feels refreshing. Having chosen our seats, I produced the wine I'd chosen, which was promptly whisked away to be uncorked. For free. Yes, La Sirene is bring your own bottle, and yes, it doesn't charge an offensive and ridiculous ""corkage"" fee. When the wine was returned, it was accompanied by the appetizer we had settled on: the poire roti au bleu fondant. The whole pears made sharing a bit unwieldy, though luckily for Amanda J, the gorgonzola overwhelmed the pear a bit too much for my taste, leaving her the lion's share. Unluckily for me, she ordered the far superior of our two entrees. I steadfastly refuse to order cassoulet in restaurants. I have a cast iron dutch oven. I am not a clod in the kitchen. I can confit a duck (or a goose, for that matter, as is traditional) and I can certainly bake the contents of said pot. But the cassoulet at La Sirene is transcendent. I recently had the cassoulet as a portion of wd50's tasting menu, and I immediately reminisced about the few brief, haunting bites I had at La Sirene. In writing this review, I nearly forgot what I had myself ordered. If that does not constitute buyer's remorse, I am not sure what does. I ordered the filet of pork loin. The port based sauce was a moderately clever way of incorporating classic sweetness into a pork dish without resorting to apples, and the morels were another welcome addition, but the ensemble just couldn't measure up to that accursed cassoulet. The limitless vegetables that were presented alongside both our main courses went largely untouched, though it was through no fault of their own. The pureed cauliflower in particular provides a nice, delicate means of cutting through the richness of whatever you're eating. Because, in all honesty, if you order anything save the fish, it will be rich. You'll need the occasional change in texture and flavor to stop yourself from feeling stuffed to the gills. You'll also need to prepare yourself for the largesse known as desserts. We opted for the Iles Flotantes, which both always make me think of The Little Prince, and never disappoint me. It's impossible to go wrong with caramel, meringue, and creme anglaise. Though La Sirene is not perfect(it's inexplicably cash only, its appetizer prices are all over the place, and its cheese assortments occasionally leave something to be desired), it is a charming, eminently pleasing and ultimately, nearly peerless bistro in a city filled with self-aggrandized disappointments.",6,4,6,Jordan S.,"Manhattan, NY",865,273,672

4.0,9/17/2012,"This was where I had my last dinner in NYC. Ah, what a great one it was. I must note that this place does not take credit cards. I won't say cash ONLY, since they do also take checks (thank goodness; another note: make sure to ask who the check should be made out to. It's not La Sirene). It's also BYOB; we brought a bottle of red wine that we purchased on the way here.The venue is smaller than I expected but very nicely arranged. They have large windows in the front which they keep open; it's quite nice to have the breeze but not so great when there's a fly that keeps on buzzing around persistently. The bathroom is small but clean; the service is really good here as well.Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's talk about the food! NH and I both got the Tournedos Rossini, which used to be a special before they put it on the permanent menu: Seared Filet Mignon topped with Foie Gras (that's right, it's not illegal in NY!) Shallots, Port & Red Wine Truffles Sauce. She got hers rare and I got mine medium rare; hers came out perfectly but I think mine was overcooked as it was tough and chewy. It looked medium rare and I was hungry so I devoured it anyway. The entrees came with sweet potato and four vegetable sides: carrot puree, cauliflower puree, some type of Mexican squash, and butternut squash. Although I wasn't happy with my meat, the foie gras was excellent. The sides were all good as well, although I will never like cauliflower.For dessert we shared their Tarte Tatin Flambee au Calvados (classic upside down caramelised apple tart flambee). It came with vanilla ice cream and was delicious! The dinner came out to be a little over $100, so be prepared with either a lot of cash or your checkbook!",2,1,2,Esther K.,"Burbank, CA",327,869,2257
5.0,9/8/2012,"I went there with a date on a rainy Tuesday evening.  There were 3 other couples in the restaurant, it was pretty much like a private restaurant, awesome.Please note, it's a cash only, BYOB restaurant, with limited seating.  Reservations are advised.The menu selection is far from immense, however, the basics of French cuisine is adequately covered.  The food was extremely good, everything that was ordered came out better than expected. The service was average, granted, who could blame the servers from kicking back a bit on a slow night.",0,0,0,Paul T.,"Manhattan, NY",3,3,0
5.0,9/8/2012,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at La Sirene.  I think the tininess only adds character and builds an intimate, homey space.  Love this place, love the french food, I would recommend this place to all of my friends.For a group of 3 we brought a couple of bottles of white wine and started with the mussels.  I'm starting to crave them as I write this... There might be crack in the broth, its rather addicting.  The service was also great.  I guess its hard to go unattended when everything's a foot away but she was always there to refill our wine glasses.  The only con I have about this place are the entrees - the meat options are pretty much just plates of sliced meat.  My lamb was slightly overdone for medium and bland.  I liked my friend's duck.  The dessert was awesome - profiteroles, very good to share.

4.0,9/7/2012,"came here yesterday with 2 of my coworkers. Never heard of the place at all, but saw it had a high rating on yelp so decided to give it a try. We were one of the first guests there at 5:30. As appetizers, we had the escargot, baby octopus and the goat cheese tart. We were all satisfied with each one of them. Although I was not a goat cheese fan, i still thought that tart was really good. Not so popular with the French taste, but fits better with the American taste. The baby octopus was cooked perfectly, very tender. It is too easy to overcook baby octopus, so this was impressive. The escargot was awesome. Juicy and tender. Soak the remaining oil with a bread.As entrees, we had the leg of lamb, steak, and snapper. They were all cooked to proper temperatures. Yummy entrees. The leg of lamb was definitely my favorite. As for desserts, we had the profiterolles and the chocolate lava cake. Amazing. The lava cake takes a bit longer to make, so make sure to order that a few minutes in advance.Great classic French cuisine. Calm ambiance. Friendly service.

4.0,9/2/2012,"Teeny tiny place (and teeny tiny bathroom, but clean) with lovely ambience, but super loud.  My husband and I had trouble hearing each other across the table.  I can't imagine what a larger group would experience.  That said, we had a lovely meal.  Great service from the waitress and the owner (a woman -- which always makes me happy).The bread basket comes with oil & vinegar, which was surprising to me since I think of butter when I think of French restaurants.I had the goat cheese tarte appetizer (served with a small salad on the plate).  It was quite large with a nice crust and a lot of goat cheese.  My husband had the pear and blue cheese appetizer (also served with a small salad on the plate).  His was super delicious!For my main course I had the small portion of the moules mariniere.  I'm glad I had the small, as it was quite a large portion.  I can't imagine what the large must be like.  I was very very disappointed to discover that virtually all the mussels still had their beards.  This is a dish I have had often elsewhere and I can't remember that every being the case.  That said, the broth was lovely.My husband had the cassoulet and enjoyed it very much.  It's quite a heavy dish for summer, but he was very happy with it.For dessert we shared the cheese plate: three cheeses (a soft brie, a semi soft stinky cheese, and a hard waxy cheese) served with soft bread, three slices of apple, and a teaspoon or two of jam.  I did not care for the hard cheese (not enough flavor for me), but the other two were fine.A very nice experience overall.  I would go back.  I strongly recommend making a reservation.FYI: It's BYOB and cash only.",0,0,0,Julie B.,"Boston, MA",2,27,0
5.0,9/2/2012,"A fantastic experience. I made a reservation by phone and the woman (the owner, I'm presuming) was extremely nice and accommodating. She made sure to explain that the restaurant was cash-only and apologized for any inconveniences, which is certainly not the experience we had with other cash only restaurants in NYC.On our way there, we hit a ton of traffic and got lost a couple of times and had to push back the reservation twice. Each time I called, she managed to remember (guess?) exactly who I was by name and was ridiculously easygoing about postponing our reservation. When we walked in, despite the fact that it was extremely busy and we had missed our reservation, she had kept a table open for us and even greeted me by name when I walked in! Seriously, who does that. Needless to say, I was impressed. We were sat/given drinks/had our byob opened immediately/had our orders taken immediately, despite the fact that the restaurant was full to the brim. The owner took our orders herself and gave us personal recommendations for meat temperatures and what to pair with the wine we brought. The food came out promptly and was delicious. We ordered the french onion soup (best french onion soup of my life) and the goat cheese tart to begin and got the duck and the pork tenderloin for the entree. Everything was so delicious and tender and crunchy and soupy that I wanted to cry. The dinner ended up being around $120 including tip and worth every cent. The service, food, ambiance, etc was all super impressive. The only thing is that space is VERY limited and this is not the place to talk about super personal, private matters. It is a bit loud too, but what can you expect? Regardless, I'm not complaining and would totally recommend this place to any french food-/wine-/nice people-loving person.",3,0,2,Mary S.,"Chapel Hill, NC",3,28,3
3.0,9/2/2012,"3.5 stars. This spot was very cozy upon arrival and the staff was welcoming and very quick at accommodating our reservation. We started with the octopus, mussels, and ravioli for appetizer. The seafood dishes were very nice, in portion size and flavor. The ravioli was ok, but portion was small and overall somewhat forgettable. For main dishes we had the filet mignon, seafood au gratin, and duck cassoulet. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly but lacked a bit in seasoning. My mom had the seafood au gratin which she said she enjoyed, but the shrimp I tasted from her dish was undercooked. My husband had the cassoulet which was different from what he had in mind, but overall the flavors were nice despite being somewhat underwhelming. We finished the evening off with the profiteroles which were good, but nothing overly memorable. Overall the spot was very quaint and we loved the fact that we could bring in our own wine without the corkage fee, but the main dishes needed a little extra something to really warrant 4 stars. Service was wonderful however, and ambience was perfect for a night out with friends/family.",0,0,0,Monica B.,"New York, NY",6,159,11

5.0,8/28/2012,"From the opentable reservation to the reception we got from the host/Maitre'd, to the ambience to the food, everything was pretty much spot-on perfect.I made reservations here for my bf's birthday, and when we arrived, the host or Maitre'd told us he had saved us the best seat in the house - and it was! I mean, it was nothing super fancy, but it was in an intimate corner, and by the window, and an extra large table (it looked like a 4-seater, and there were other couples there who all just had regular 1-on-1 tables), and he also doubled the table decor (two candles, two small centerpieces, etc.)! It was super sweet, and looked pretty darn romantic (and I'm not really that romantic, haha).We shared two appetizers, the French onion soup and the steamed mussels with curry, diced apples and light cream. Both were PHENOMENAL.  The sweetness of the soup was perfect, and the cheese had just the right amount of heaviness. The sauce that the mussels were soaked in was out of this world! Who knew diced apples could compliment mussels so well? I certainly didn't - we finished the mussels, then couldn't help soaking up the rest of the sauce with bread until there was barely anything left, haha.The main courses were excellent as well. I had lamb, which is my go-to for traditional French fare, and it was done just right, and bursting with flavor and juiciness. My bf got the duck, which he loves but is always scared to get at French places because so many of them in his experience have made them too dry, and REALLY loved it! He was so happy with it, hahaha, and couldn't stop raving. Mission accomplished!The dessert was the only slightly ""imperfect"" part of the meal. Don't get me wrong, our waiter brought out our profiteroles with a big ol' candle, and it looked BEAUTIFUL. But, I have to say it wasn't as good as it looked - it was still very good, just not comparable to everything else we'd had. It's hard to knock them, though, because then our waiter also brought out a SECOND DESSERT on the house - French crepes!! Again, they were (surprisingly) not as satisfying as either the appetizers or the main courses, but still, I can't justify taking off a star for one slightly underwhelming course. Everything else more than made up for it! A big thanks to La Sirene for making the night another special one for us - I've already recommended it to my coworkers!P.S. Oh, how could I forget?

5.0,8/28/2012,"LOVE LOVE LOVE! I came here with my best friend for her birthday dinner, just me and her, Monday with reservation at 7:30pm on a summer night. There was no wait and was seated immediately. I ordered almost everything that was recommended by yelpers, including their special of the day.For appetizer: Sautéed Baby Octopus with Garlic, Parsley Olive Oil Bread Crumbs, Tomato Mushroom & watermelon with goat cheese salad (special of the day). Goat Cheese Tart with Shallots ,Truffles, Grape and a Veil of 180 days Aged Swiss Cheese-I enjoyed every single bite of all the appetizers! It was delicious, all of it is a must try. As a cheese lover (and lactose) the cheese tart is absolutely delicious, very cheesy, so don't order unless you love cheese. For entree: Kassulet Toulousain de la Maison (Signature) Cassoulet Toulouse's Style ( Cannellini Beans, tomato, Garlic Duck Confit, Slab Bacon & Pork sausage all Braised with Noble Duck Fat : Yummy but Rich !! -PLUS it was a slow night, they added the 4 sides of veggies for us. This delicious dish is very heavy, do not attempt to eat it all by one, unless you love meat and sauce. They put a warning label on it, and I absolutely agree with it! But definitely a great dish to share.For dessert: we ordered the three flavors of home-made sherbet, mango, coconut & raspberry.-Absolute delight! Light & flavorful at the same time! Plus low calories after such a huge meal!This place is also BYOB with no corkage fee. They also work with a wine store that delivers to the restaurant for free with no minimum charge, but only between 3-11pm.  How much more can we ask for?!This is a must try place in NYC, especially if you love French food. It can hold a large party, but I feel it might be more enjoyable with a smaller number of company. It's a very romantic place.We spend around $55 per person. The price is actually pretty fair for its quality of food and vast amount, especially in NYC. I definitely recommend coming here to impress a fancy girl/boy.",2,0,3,Jeanny C.,"Philadelphia, PA",263,105,463

The boy and I made reservations to La Sirene on OpenTable and not only got the time we wanted but was able to be seated when we arrived a little early.  With all the hustle and bustle of the day, I completely forgot that this establishment was BYOB with no cork fee.No alcohol, no problem!!  The restaurant knows a store you can call with what you want and price you were thinking and they will deliver it to you free of delivery charge.  The restaurant is small, cute and intimate and everything on the menu looked tempting.  We decided that we will order a few appetizers and see how we are after that, we might order two more entrees, we might order one entree, we might get more appetizers. . . Oh the possibilities!!Well all those possibilities were halted when the waitress asked me to order my entire meal at once in order to not ""confuse the cooks"".  But I wanted to try the escargot, the goat cheese tart, the foie gras and the mussels!!  Maybe I'll be full with that or maybe I'll want more!!!  Yes I was actually pouting at this time and my bf jokingly but annoyingly told me not to be difficult.  This is my only pet peeve at this restaurant and I will leave it at that.The food was magnificent.  We ended up ordering the escargots and foie gras as appetizers.  The foie gras was home made and served cold with cherry confit and poached apples.  It was creamy deliciousness.  Definitely worth it.  The escargots were excellent, meaty, served in shells with garlic butter sauce.  For my reluctant entree I ordered the seared moulard duck breast with cherry, port and red wine sauce served with sweet potatoes and four vegetables to share (pureed carrots, pureed cauliflower, roasted zuccini and tomatoes and sauteed green beans with garlic).  The four vegetables are endless, you can have as much as you want.  Portion sizes are reasonable meaning that they give the appropriate serving of food - not too much, not too little.  I was comfortably full when I finished my dish.The plus one had the roasted lamb with white wine crème de garlic confit sauce which was the better of the two entrees.  The sauce was droolicious.Cash only.So even though it was an excellent dinner and thinks worked out, I was still a little peeved that I was not allowed to order as I wish.  A little brat I know but I was being reasonable right?!?!",13,9,9,Tanya G.,"Evans Mills, NY",767,147,306

5.0,8/25/2012,"Don't shed tears for Ivo & Lulu, the gem of a neighborhood restaurant which once occupied this space. La Sirène is more than a worthy successor. It's refreshingly unpretentious, lively and atmospheric, and easily my new favorite French in town. BYOB and the absence of a corkage fee also make it incredibly affordable.The menu runs the gamut of French cuisine, with a slant toward seafood, but you won't be sorry limiting yourself to the offerings in the appetizers section. The ravioles au truffe noir, curried octopus salad (a delectable, congruous pairing of ingredients, despite what you may think) and the variations on mussels in broth are all phenomenal. Just make an informed-as-possible wine selection when you go, and be sure to bring cash with you!Oh, and if this is important to you: it is one of the few restaurants, in my view, where everything hits the right notes, from food to service to décor, yet never feels trendy or overly-meditated, as though part of a careful marketing strategy. There are no subway tiles, faux-distressed farm tables or $16 pork belly appetizers in sight.

So it was the perfect storm for a great French dinner.We decided on La Sirene based on extensive Yelp research, and we weren't disappointed. The place has a great vibe; casual without being sloppy, cosmopolitan without being pretentious. It's small, tidy, and not too noisy (although the noise level is just right to create that buzz of excitement). The staff is friendly, attentive, and warm. I love their BYOB policy; we stopped at a wine store in the Meatpacking District and got a nice red from St. Emilion.  We started with the foie gras, which they make themselves. It was very mild; almost too mild for my taste, but I loved it. Eff you, California animal rights activists!I had the cassoulet, which was a little different than the cassoulets I've had before. This was light on the beans, and heavy on the meats. The menu states that it's not for the faint of heart, but I loved it. Very flavorful, rich without being greasy or making me nauseous. My wife had the duck, which was fantastic; cooked perfectly, moist and delicious.We were full by dessert, but ordered the molten chocolate cake.

They were undercooked, and tasted of raw foul mussel.  Their was no broth even to dip some bread.  The entrees fared better. We had the hanger steak and the lamb.  It was not offensive but lacked any real French cooking taste or skill.  The location and decoration I would rate as poor and lacking any ambiance.  In all we were very disappointed in the total dining experience of LaSirene.  Too many reviewers seemed to only let the byob cloud their judgement of decent French cuisine.",0,0,0,Joseph M.,"Bethpage, NY",0,7,0

4.0,7/23/2012,"I was on the quest to find a delicious, melt in your mouth type of restaurant for mine and my boyfriends anniversary. I did my research, and realized that I wanted to try La Sirene, a BYOB French joint I have had my eye on for quite some time now.When I arrived, I was surprsied to find that the restaurant wasn't as cute or quaint as described in previous reviews. I know it has recently been redone, so that could be the reason.Since we had brought our own wine (no corkage fee, which is tough to find in NYC these days) we knew we wanted to get a little crazy with the food. When my boyfriend and I go out to eat, we share everything so we can taste more. We definitely left feeling full and happy. Here is what we got:French Onion Soup:  We started with the french onion soup, even though it was a 100 degree day in NYC, because I had read online that it was the best french onion soup that people have ever had. Since I love french onion soup we ordered it. However, it really just tasted like your run of the mill, normal french onion soup. It was good don't get me wrong, but it definitely wasn't anything special. Probably unnecessary because it filled us up early on in the meal.Tartelette De Chevre Frais Aux Echalotes, Truffles, Raisins Confit Et Voile De Vieux Gruyere goat cheese tart with shallots, truffles, grape and a veil of 180 days aged swiss cheese: This tart was absolutely amazing. I am a sucker for truffle and goat cheese, and who doesn't love a good pastry? I highly reccomend this dish to anyone that goes to La Sirene. It was melt in your mouth delicious, a favorite part of my meal.Tournedos Rossini: Based on Yelp reviews, I knew that the tournedos rossini at La Sirene was a must try. This was my first time tasting fois gras, so I was  a little nervous but it turned out to be amazing. The steak was cooked to perfection and I LOVED the fois gras! I definitely get the hype! Kassulet Toulousain De La Maison cassoulet toulouse's style (cannellini beans, tomato, garlic duck confit, slab bacon & pork sausage all braised with duck fat): My boyfriend and I were both actually pretty disappointed with this dish. Our waitress had warned it would be heavy, but I thought she meant becuase of its fatty succulent goodness. It turned out to be a stew, with not much flavor. I was expecting this to be exploding with flavor, but there was definitely something lacking. I definitely wish we would have gone with something else. Maybe the lamb. I do reccomend La Sirene, although all the dishes weren't my favorite. I definitely recognize quality food when I taste it. I would just avoid the Kassulet, because although the description sounds insanely amazing, it just isn't.",1,0,0,Cara S.,"Manhattan, NY",5,14,1
5.0,7/19/2012,"Oh wow- it's been at least 6 months since my last visit to this place and that's when I started this review - since the memory of that meal was never lost, this review is warranted! If you're a fan of unpretentious, hearty French comfort food WITH BYOB (sans corkage fee and with their kind offers to chill your wine if you desire), topped off by hands down the best duck confit in the city, this is the place for you as it is for us - we've never had a bad experience here. Right in the South Village and worth visiting anytime I'm in New York -even with the cab ride in congestion from Manhattan - upon arrival, we find there's a laid back local crowd that runs amuck here at 7 pm so it's a good idea to eat early or eat late if you don't want to dine with the bigger crowds. The way the restaurant smells as you walk through the front door, is amazing- sort of a mix of chocolate, red meat and thyme - yummy.  The exterior, with that awning out front and a few bistro tables set up outside, looks very unassuming, and quirky. The simple decor continues throughout, and it does somehow add to the authenticity of the experience since it feels like you're eating at a cafe on Rue Montmartre in the heart of Paris.  If you bring your favorite bottle of wine and order your filet or duck (with the filet mignon, make sure to order this a tad rarer than you actually want it served since their radar on medium varies) La Sirene also makes for a more budget friendly spot in NYC for a dinner date especially since they serve really good sized shareable portions - the variety of appetizers or desserts may not be your priority here since it's these damn good entrees themselves that deliver satisfying food coma everytime. It's obvious that the food brings people to line up outside night after night to eat here - for good reason. La Sirene- see you soon... !",0,0,0,Ams D.,"Alhambra, CA",4,2,0
4.0,7/18/2012,"Quickly becoming my favorite restaurant in NYC due to its low key crowd, quaint decor, lovely hostess and great food. Granted they cooked my filet mignon a bit too well done even though I requested medium I'll still come back because their duck is fabulous. Juicy, saucy, delicious! The mussels and escargot are the must-get items so don't leave until you try them. Sadly, their desserts aren't memorable. I tried 3 of them and the only thing that did stick out as amazing was the coconut sherbet that came with the lava cake. Another downside is it's a cash only establishment, which is such an inconvenience because their menu is not cheap and no one really likes to carry large amounts of cash around them. Other than these two gripes I give this place a solid 4 star.",0,0,1,KL Z.,"Manhattan, NY",2,107,42

A special mention to Chef Didier and his team for the special appetizer ""Ravioles with black truffles and cream"" and the amazing hanger steak cooked rare as requested!  It was literally a ""melting in your mouth"" experience - and that's tough enough to achieve with red meat!  Of course, I could also talk about the profiteroles, the amazing ""moules marinieres"" - the best in the city hands down! and the carrot and cauliflower purees probably better than my Mom's...  Last night brought back lots of memories - I felt at home back in Brittany with some great great French quality food!  La Sirene is definitely my go-to French restaurant in the city!

5.0,4/25/2012,"I first visited La Sirene a year ago with 3 of my best friends. We had a memorable night, copious bottles of wine & countess laughs over excellent French food. I returned yesterday with a friend as I thought it'd be a nice way to celebrate him being in town. Let me back up & give a little preface. Due to my recent obsessive Yelping (sorry, I know I dominate many of your ""Friends' Activity"" on a daily basis), I've been introduced to this magical fat kid's dream world that I didn't even know existed until a few months ago. Through my avid reviewing, as I'm sure many of you have experienced, I often have restaurant owners or customer service reach out to me to give thanks for praise or address a negative experience I may have had. As such,  I recently had the honor of making owner Chef Didier's acquaintance through Yelp after my 4-star review of La Sirene. I'm always amazed & somewhat shocked when I'm directly contacted by acclaimed chefs/restaurateurs... and it was no different when Didier messaged me with thanks for my review & graciously acknowledged that though the restaurant was previously ""cramped"", they had expanded. Touched by his sweet message, & well aware of my impending out-of-town visitor, I decided it was time to return to La Sirene. As we were running a little late, I called the restaurant to alert the maitre-d/waiter/jack-of-all-trades, Sean, to my tardiness & he patiently advised me that it was fine & to take my time. Upon arriving at the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised by the upgrades to the dining room - what was once a little hole in the wall, albeit a cute one, has now transformed drastically into a modern setting that exudes both warmth & spaciousness. I was transfixed by the gorgeous mosaic art on the walls & the solid crowd of patrons for a Tuesday night. After Sean seated us, I asked him whether Chef Didier was in tonight & that I'd love to meet him in person. As if he appeared out of thin air, Didier, a sweet, smiling, energetic Frenchman, was at our table in the blink of an eye, & greeted me with a two-kiss embrace. He proceeded to sit next to me at the neighboring table & we discussed everything from his journey in the restaurant biz, to Yelping, to the renovated restaurant, to his sister fondue restaurant Taureau (French for ""Taurus"", the zodiac sign of yours truly). Over the next half an hour, I learned about how he opened a bistro in Paris & ran a one-man show for 13 years where he did everything on his own from waiting on tables, to cooking, to dish-washing & then slept in the restaurant only to wake up the next day and do it all again. He taught me how escargots are cooked, informed me that he responds to each one of his Yelp reviewers & uses Yelp as a reviewer himself, asked for my advice on how to bring back some of the warmth that was inherent in his smaller La Sirene, recommended dishes from the menu & then took our order himself, revealed that he is a Scorpio, & even showed me how to eat escargots (it was my first time), after which he said he wanted to leave us to enjoy the meal, wished us ""bon appetit"", & was out the door. My friend and I then looked at one another & proclaimed how cool that was after which he softly said, ""he came here just to meet you""; which is when I realized that Chef Didier ventured from his other restaurant to this one just to meet little ol' me, 1 in 600+ of his Yelp reviewers. I was so touched, and moreover, astounded by the humble nature of such a commended chef. He is all-at-once animated, funny, hospitable... just a good man down to the core to whom feeding others & being a positive part of someone's day brings pure joy. This interaction alone made my night & I would have looked back on this evening fondly if it had ended right then & there. But then came the food.Every single dish we tried was incroyable! The Escargots a la Bourguignone were simple yet rich & succulent. The Moules Vignerones complemented our red wine nicely and were some of the best mussels I've ever had (the bacon was unreal). And I can't even put into words the deliciousness that was the Tournedos Rossini - seared Filet Mignon topped With Foie Gras in a port & red wine truffle sauce & cooked to a perfect medium rare. I had forgotten how truly life-changing this steak was from my first visit but I will never ever forget again. I'm grateful to Chef Didier for recommending that we split an entree otherwise I would have legit fallen into a food coma... because then we ordered dessert, compliments of the Chef. So at the recommendation of the waitress, we shared the Dark Lava Chocolate Cake with Coconut Sherbet, which was oozing liquid chocolate, & ate every last bite.We left La Sirene, drunk off butter, having had one of the most amazing meals ever. I will undoubtedly be back soon, and be sure to check out Taureau in the coming months as well.",10,2,8,Pia S.,"New York, NY",1036,681,48

Bursting with impeccable flavor and perfectly cooked all around, there's really no point in arguing which was the better dish. Just get both. Best mussels ever. It's worth repeating again.

Fifteen minutes later, with little attention from the waitress, I decided to cut my losses and leave.

The truth was revealed, that the waitress had mixed-up the mussel orders, and the other table had gotten the  curry sauce.

4.0,4/16/2012,"We came here for a Saturday night dinner and had a pleasant experience. The vegetarian options are very few and far between, but I chose to have the goat cheese appetizer as an entree (had filled up on croissants and donuts beforehand). The goat cheese tart was rich, but delicious. Wish it came with more salad, as that would have cut the richness.My friends had the kassulet and the hanger steak. Both enjoyed their meals. The hanger steak also came with ""endless"" vegetables. I think the pureed cauliflower was very good (need to try to make cauliflower like that at home!), as was the zucchini. The pureed carrots were fine (not my fav), and the chayote was actually way too salty.The only downer of our meal was our tarte tatin. The tarte itself was fine, but the flambee on it was sooo gross. It drenched the plate in terrible alcohol flavor, which soaked into the crust and completely ruined the dessert. The vanilla ice cream was also on the icy, crunchy side. Not the smoothest ice cream. We prob should have opted for something else. :(Also, the place was very modern and pleasant. The windows were open, giving us the air of al fresco dining.

4.0,4/4/2012,"So to my surprise, I got contacted by Didier, the owner of La Sirene, personally inviting me to return and give his restaurant another chance.  Considering the many positive reviews of La Sirene, the fact that he troubled to contact me impressed me as he obviously cares that customers leave his restaurant happy.  Therefore, this past Sunday I returned to La Sirene with my husband.On a Sunday evening, the restaurant was filled but perhaps not as crazily busy as Saturday so for those looking for a more intimate (read ""quiet"") experience, you might want to try a Sunday night.  Anyway, like last time, we were immediately seated upon our arrival.  (We also had reservations.)Service was again excellent.  We started with the tartiflette as appetizer.  For those who are unfamiliar, as was I prior to this experience,in the simplest terms, the tartiflette consists of cubed potatoes, with creamy sauce and bits of bacon. Anyway, we both liked it a lot.For entrees, husband had the hanger steak with garlic parsley sauce, medium rare as recommended by our server while I had the tilapia with the peppercorn sauce.  My husband loved his dish and was so impressed with how tender yet flavorful the meat was.  I was equally impressed with my fish... Just to clarify, I am not really a seafood person.  I try to eat fish on occasion for the health benefits. So I was a little wary but... this was delicious!  Fish was nicely cooked and the sauce was delicious - not overwhelmingly creamy or sweet.  Plus, the vegetable purees were tastier this time around.  I could not really put my finger on what made the difference but I especially enjoyed the cauliflower and carrot purees.We were quite satisfied with our meal and very full - probably the tartiflette helped to fill us up.  I am very glad we gave La Sirene another shot.  We will be returning with great anticipation...hopefully we can try a dessert next time.",2,0,0,Michelle C.,"Montvale, NJ",3,17,0
5.0,4/4/2012,"I stopped by La Sirene, with a reservation of course, with 2 of my former roommates to celebrate our new home! It was a warm summer evening and everything was perfect :)We were seated right away and had our bottles popped, ready for a good evening. Our waitress spoke to us in a heavy French accent and I instantly fell in love! We started off with vegetable puree which was absolutely heavenly! My entree was the filet mignon foie gras and though it tasted amazing, it looked kinda scary and was a little too heavy for my palette. A few bites in and I was good! La Sirene is definitely a cozy little romantic restaurant; I recall looking around at the other patrons and seeing a ton of couples enjoying their meals by candlelight ;) Super romantic!",0,0,0,Valerie C.,"New York, NY",307,754,227

5.0,4/3/2012,"This is my very first review, ive decided to write it bc thats how excellent this was. My boyfriend and I decided to come here for our 1 year anniversary last night for dinner.  We really wanted French and after reading through the reviews on yelp, we decided to give it a try!We ordered the popular dishes since it was our  first time.For appetizers, we had the- mussel in curry sauce.  This was the first time I've ever had tender mussels, it was delicious and portions were generous.  The curry sauce wasn't as creamy or flavorful as I had expected considering it was French but overall it was good.  I want to try the white wine sauce next time!  -goat cheese tart- this is a MUST try, it was absolutely delicious.  Very creamy, rich and full of flavor. It came paired with a light arugula salad with some corn and a red tart sauce drizzled around the plate.  Love !-escargot in garlic and butter: we could smell the garlic and butter from the restaurant which made was so pleasant.  The escargot came in the shell along with specific tools to hold and remove the escargot.  The flavor was really good, the escargot was so tender.  We used our bread to soak up every last drop of sauce.  Entrees were the best best best part, probably the best I've ever had.-duck with cherry red wine- this was my first time ordering duck but since it was so raved about, I decided to try it, and boy am I happy!!!!! It was Absolutely delicious. The waitress was super sweet and helpful. She suggested I order med rare And it was perfect.  The meat was tender and the best part was the sauce.  It's one of those dishes you really have to chew slowly to embrace the camplicated layers of favors your taste buds are absorbing. It was excellent. 5/5!!!-my bf had the filet mignon with foie gras and some sort of truffle sauce. I can't decide between which was better, the duck or the steak. They were both heavenly.  I have steak all the time so I didn't expect anything too special but again, their sauce is hands down amazing.  The step was cooked perfectly med rare and we cleaned a, our plates. It was that good.dessert we had the bittersweet chocolate cake, this was okay.  Not as wonderful as I had hoped but still good, I mean it is chocolate and ice cream!  It tasted like a puff and want ad fresh as I had expected.  The service is divine, the chef came out and personally greeted everyone in the restaurant. He takes his food very seriously. The waitress was super sweet as well.  I think this was one of the best services. She hung my jacket, uncorked our wine (byob) and placed it in an ice bucket to keep cold.Overall, this was one of the most delicious dinners I've had.  Next time I would come back and just have entrees be they were the best!  You have to try this place.",0,0,0,Diana G.,"Brooklyn, NY",130,151,93

5.0,4/1/2012,"I have been wanting to come to La Sirene for probably close to three years now and for some reason no one ever wanted to take me.. until Friday! I've read such amazing things about the food and the service here and everything lived up to the hype.  They are a BYOB place, so either come with your favorite bottle of wine or ask them for the number for wine delivery and they will bring you a bottle within 10 minutes of placing the order (you can also have the wine delivered the day before so that you don't need to trek around the city with a bottle in hand).To start we shared the goat cheese tart, which was amazing and creamy, as well as the steamed muscles.  I think I preferred the muscles because after a while I found the goat cheese to be a little too rich for mass consumption.  We are both big on sharing (which rocks because I love to try lots of food) so he ordered the fillet mignon, which I believe was served with port wine cream sauce and I ordered the baked seafood.  Both dishes were really phenomenal in my opinion.  As far as dessert was concerned, we ordered the Dark Lava Cake, which I felt fell a little short.. but whatever.I found the service to be fantastic - the owner (I am assuming) was very attentive, which gave the restaurant a nice personal touch.  I found the atmosphere to be warm and intimate, so it's definitely a great place to take a date or even just to get together with friends.",3,1,1,Julie G.,"London, United Kingdom",677,999,19
5.0,3/28/2012,"Loved this place. Since moving back to the area last month after 4 years in Europe, I've had a hard time readjusting to the Disney World/Epcot Center like scene that is NYC dining. I feel like nearly everywhere in Europe gets it right - great restaurants, decent prices, reasonable wine, and everywhere in NYC is so...unnecessarily over the top. I picked La Sirene because of all the great reviews and was SO happy with my choice. We came here to celebrate my birthday, a fairly large party of 10+. The staff was incredibly polite, helpful, and able to handle our fairly rowdy group. Decor was minimal, simple - not trying soooooo hard to seem super French. Which is incredibly refreshing, to me. The food - hearty and delicious. I had the sea bass, with the octopus as appetizer, and nibbled on other people's food. The cassoulet, from what I tasted, was LOVELY. The escargot were on point, nice and buttery. Since coming back to the states I find it so difficult to find something so simple: good food at a restaurant with good vibes. La Sirene does this so well. Definitely plan on coming back.",0,0,0,Emme L.,"Manhattan, NY",1,48,0
5.0,3/27/2012,"Does it make me a bad person that I originally didn't want to write a review lest too many people learn about La Sirene and it becomes even harder to make a reservation? Alas, too many of my fellow NYC'ers have already spilled the secret!  ;)I came here for dinner with 6 girlfriends on a Thursday night. The restaurant was bumping, but our table was ready exactly when promised. The food was absolutely phenomenal! I struggled with what to order because I wanted EVERYTHING, but finally decided on the following: 1) Moules Rochelaises - steamed mussels with curry, diced apples and light cream, 2) Daily special - Poached pear with walnuts and blue cheese, 3) Onglet Poêlé À La Facon Luchonaise - seared hanger steak, roasted garlic and parsley sauce, and 4) Tarte Tatin Flambee Au Calvados - classic upside down caramelized apple tart flambee.I would order every one of these items again, but especially the hanger steak. Firstly, I never knew hanger steak could be tender. Secondly, why has no one else ever thought to put roasted garlic on steak until now?? The moment the steak hits the table, you can't help but notice the warm, garlicky, meaty aroma. No matter what else you're eating, you will drop it and want to take a bite of this steak. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. It tastes as good as it smells. I will be going back to this restaurant again very soon - in fact, i already have a reservation for this weekend.

3.0,3/27/2012,"My wife and I had plans later in the evening but wanted to try this restaurant with such overwhelming support, so made a 5:30 reservation on a Monday night and were the first ones in the restaurant for the evening.The BYOB aspect is nice though we hadn't had time to pick up a bottle of wine before dinner.  The hostess/waitress gave us the number of a wine shop that delivers, and a few minutes later a bike delivery guy shows up with our wine; pretty cool.  The waitress was great and very attentive.We were brought some bread to start along with a carafe of water (which I really appreciate).  We started with the steamed mussels in curry sauce, which were pretty good.  Very tender mussels which were interesting with the curry sauce.For the main courses, she ordered the tilapia with mango/tomato/peppercorn sauce and I had cornish hens with a mushroom sauce (morel, truffle, and a few others I don't recall) -- the day's special.  The waitress asked to make sure I would be okay with having them cooked medium, as that's how the chef prefers it (described as very tender and succulent); of course that would be great.The cornish hens came as 3 split half-hens; they were seasoned very nicely and the skin was delightful and crispy.  The mushroom sauce was delicious and came with a generous helping of 5-6 morels.  The morels in the sauce were very good, and definitely the best bites of the evening.I tried a few bites of the tilapia, which wasn't very memorable.  The portions of everything were quite generous; none of this fussy 3-bite-entree nonsense you might get at some other higher end places.Unfortunately, I thought our entrees came out somewhat over-done; I found her tilapia to be a bit dry (and tilapia is usually a fairly easy fish to keep moist).  My cornish hens just had the texture of a standard piece of chicken; certainly not succulent or cooked to 'medium'.From the overwhelming number of 5-star reviews here, I expected each course to be a mind-blowingly amazing experience.  It was good and we enjoyed ourselves, but overall I'd only rate the food we had as slightly above middle-of-the-road for a $30/plate restaurant.  3.5/5 stars, if that were an option.",1,0,0,Nick M.,"Durham, NC",40,2,0

The tables are small but they make everything fit and work. Every table in the house was taken and it got a little noisy.

Eating here feels refreshingly honest; they make their money on the food alone.My only complaint are that it can get pretty loud (I've only been here Fridays), seating can be a bit tight (there was an awkward date next to us one time), and it would be nice if they had nicer wine glasses for people who are there as much to drink a special wine they brought as for the food, but that last point is minor.Looking forward to coming back.",1,0,0,Bevan B.,"New York, NY",0,11,0

As the restaurant started to fill up towards the end of our meal, it was a bit difficult to get their attention.

Complimentary Bread is provided. I appreciate that a large glass bottle of water is placed on the table. I drink a lot of water and love this concept. The Goat Cheese Tart had a light and flaky crust. The cheese was smooth, creamy, and extremely flavorful. An explosion of garlic! Yum. The Filet Mignon and Osso Bucco were excellent Entrees. The meat was juicy and seasoned well. The Filet Mignon is topped with Foie Gras, Shallots, Port and Red Wine Truffles Sauce. Your meal also comes with a Complimentary Tray of 4 Vegetables. It's all you can eat. The night we went they offered Squash, String Beans, Cauliflower, and Carrots. The Profiterolles au ""Bitter/Sweet"" Chocolate is perfect for sharing and a lovely way to end a meal. The cool ice cream, light pastry, and warm chocolate were a perfect match.

5.0,2/21/2012,"I'm very happy when I get a chance to write a 5 star review. This was a pretty easy one to call 5stars too.The decor here is great, minimalist I would say. They're not trying to do too much, and it would be hard for them to anyway, because the place only holds 25 people. The way they do the food is very 'diner-esque' as well. You place your order and then your server goes to the kitchen and tells the chef. The cooks in the kitchen prepare your meal, then they ring a bell for the server to come pick it up.The food is quite amazing. I got the Casoulet toulouse style, which, according to the menu, is what they gave warriors to defend the city. I figured, since I was hungry, that would be my best bet. My date got the Filet Mignon. The Casoulet comes out in a bowl (and not a very large bowl at that) so I figured that I would easily tear through this with reckless abandon. Nope. Infact, there's so much stuff in that bowl (bacon, sausage, and of course Duck breast) that I didn't even finish the whole thing! It was SO GOOD though. The sausage and duck and bacon were hidden under the beans, so eating the food was kind of like going on an edible scavenger hunt! it was awesome. This dish definitely requires you using all of the utensils they give you (spoon, knife, fork)...it's like an RPG eating the Casoulet, excuse my nerdy reference.The Filet Mignon was so tender that the steak knife could barely even cut through it. It was amazing, tons of flavor from the sauce (red wine sauce i think?) it was hanging out in. Definitely needed a laser to cut it though!For dessert we decided to split the Apple tart tatin, which happens to be a flambee. Thank God we decided to do that, because that tart is huge. I can't imagine anyone one person ordering that for dessert and eating the whole thing, It was quite good though, and who doesn't love seeing their food engulfed in flames?! Yea, that's what I thought too.All in all amazing experience, and I want to thank all my fellow Yelpers who reviewed this place and recommended it to me, you guys know your stuff.",2,2,0,Clint H.,"Brooklyn, NY",341,479,54

4.0,2/12/2012,"This place had such a high rating on yelp I just had to try it! what did i find? my own sister went and had an awesome time. What kind of family would keep this gem to herself!!!! She's an awful awful person. She's not but I'm too sensitive to forgive her. She and many other reviewers are right the goat cheese tart was amazing. What's even better is that my date isn't too keen on cheese. All mines!     I made a mistake that was at no fault to the restaurant. I have only myself to blame.    Didn't do the BYOB because we were planning on going to a party after wards and as much as I love wine it sure ends the night quicker for me *wink*. My date and I ordered the Goat cheese tart which had spots of cinnamon and grapes in it which was a delight to bite into, the Steam Mussels with curry, He ordered the quail and I ordered the Kassulet Toulousain de la Maison. The last one was such a mistake for me. After the heavy appetizers the last thing i should have order was something super heavy and... god i do not like beans at all. Don't get me wrong from the sausage to the duck this dish was yummy but i don't like beans. I don't like the feel of beans in my mouth.  I definitely would not make such a greedy amateur mistake again. Minus one star for the quail which i felt bad about since my date only ordered it cause he knew i like quail, the meal for him was overly salty and slightly burnt but timing was tight and we had no time to tell the waitress and wait for another entree.",0,0,0,Kei Y W.,"Brooklyn, NY",117,85,55
4.0,2/11/2012,"Not that this place needs another review, but here goes:First of all the place is tiny. Could only get a reservation for 5:30 but the tables are small and seating is cramped. Still it is intimate and cozy. Service was great, waitresses were all adorable. Had the goat cheese tart which was DELICIOUS. I am a vegetarian so I ordered the vegetarian platter option for my entree. Wasn't super impressed with it, especially for how much it was. Also, all the food comes with a side dish of 4 different vegetables, so I had my plate of veggies and then 2 other plates of side veggies from everyone else (we were a party of four) and most of the side dishes were already on my plate. Do you see what I'm saying here? I just wish they would have been a bit more creative. Or I almost wished they had used more butter as none of the vegetables were that exciting. Cold beets. Some eggplant. Green beans. Pile of rice. Some of it was delicious but for being the only non-meat entree option on the menu, don't you think they could have put a bit more effort into it and differentiated from the sides? Just a thought. Everyone else's food was great though and they were satisfied.Dessert was good, had the cream puffs, profiteroles, and the apple tartine thing which was the only disappointing one - it's literally just a bunch of soft apples on top of a crust. They light it on fire and it wasn't working so our waitress doused it with rum so by the time we ate it, it just tasted like....burnt rum. The point is, it was overall great and a charming little spot.",0,0,0,Anna L.,"New York, NY",59,217,1

My duck lacked a really good sear and was a tad chewy but the flavor was dead on.  On most days, I can pass on ice cream, and I probably should have gone with my gut and ordered the chocolate lava cake.

I've tried the goat cheese tart - absolutely divine. Great flavour combination. Escargot - again, absolutely perfect. Bread was awesome to dip into the drippings from the escargot dish. i've had the cassoulet...not my kinda food or dish (too meaty and hearty) BUT does not mean it was a great dish. just not my kind of food. i've had the steak - cooked well, excellent sauce. the veggies that comes along with the entrees were so so good- creamy, light, flavourful. topped it off with profitoles for dessert. awesome good quality chocolate. 5 stars for quality, taste, and service. it does not get any better than this. i almost don't want people to know how good this place is for fear that too many will start to go and will eventually downgrade this place. and with BYOB, c'mon life does not get better. love this place. an absolute hidden gem.",5,0,0,Jules S.,"San Jose, CA",0,21,0

Cash only.  Come prepared and leave happy.The food:Goat Cheese Tart with Shallots, Truffles, Grape and a Veil of 90-days Aged Swiss Cheese was a happy party in my mouth Duck Liver Sauteed, Caramelized Onions, Deglazed with Mustard Vinagrette Over Mesclum, Walnuts, Apple: fabulously rich and light at the same time!Cassoulet Toulouse's Style: we took this on food-warrior style and we conquered. Was it rich? Yes! Was it greasy? Yes! Was it absolutely, finger-lickin', bowl lickin' divine?  A resounding yes!  Seared hanger steak: perfectly cooked, a lighter companion to the cassoulet (who thought I would be saying that about steak).  Chocolate lava cake!

Bold statement, I know.  Here's why I am making it - they add wine to the soup at some point and it opens up the flavors in a way where you can't stop eating.  The cheese stays perfectly gooey for a longer than average time, might be the wine... I'm not sure, but who cares! :)Goat Cheese Tart - get it.  You won't regret it.Cassoulet Toulouse's Style - Super rich, but incredibly good.  You can TASTE the duck fat and eat some of it too!  The menu warns you to only eat this if you have the super human powers to digest highly rich and actually bear it.  Seared Filet Mignon Topped With Foie Gras - absolutely amazing. the flavors are melded together beautifully - Shallots, Port & Red Wine Truffles, Foie Gras and of course the filet mignon.

5.0,1/17/2012,"I am a huge fan of La Sirene for the last 3 years or so and have watched them more than double their size. My congratulations to the owner and the staff as they are still very focused on pleasing their guests. Magda and her fellow waiters are very welcoming and greet us as old friends. The food is consistently well prepared with our favorites being the escargot, beet salad, lamb, duck and occasionally the cassoulet. Get extra bread to soak up that escargot butter. We rarely have room for dessert but the lava cake is awesome. Unfortunately, what used to be a wonderful little secret has become a very busy restaurant. One must definitely make reservations and be prepared to wait if it's a late one.The one thing I should try to do is to set expectations. This is not Bouley, Per Se or Le Bernardin. La Sirene is a homey, friendly, relatively inexpensive very good french restaurant. It will not win Michelin stars and it is not Haute Cuisine. It is unfair to compare La Sirene to something it is not. La Sirene is the best at what it does. In addition to serving excellent food in a great atmosphere, they are BYOB and that allows me to bring a bottle and pair it with the right foods. I love to go into my cellar to choose a great wine for dinner. Last time I was there the waiter said ""This wine is older than me!"" It was a 1982 Bordeaux.  Pros: Best wine list in town (BYOB), great food, great atmosphere, affordableCons: People have discovered it!I understand they are moving Taureau to the old Ivo and Lulu space.

With its cozy,  romantic-candle-lit atmosphere,  It is the premiere date spot in the city and, unlike the Per Se's and L'atelier's of the world, is manageable to go more than once a leap year. Even more, Didier, the chef/owner, is the most accommodating friendly fatherly host you'll meet. He'll ask how your meal is going, offer you wine recommendations (BYOB!!!!), and even top your plate off with extra carbs/veggies if your meat is getting lonely. Highly recommended are the mussels (curried apple is my personal favorite, you  will ask for more bread to dip into that amazing broth), the foie gras/filet mignon ""burger"", and always ask for the specials. If you forget to BYOB, don't fret; they'll hook you up with the number of a nearby store that delivers and chill your whites for you. Cash Only! Use open table or call ahead to reserve.

4.0,12/2/2011,"Hype is a good thing. No matter the opinion is favorable or unfavorable, as long as an opinion is elicited. I offer my sincerest gratitude to the 500+ Yelpers who helped steered me in the direction towards La Sirene on a brisk Winter evening for a spontaneous dinner in the Soho area. The number of reviews was eye-catching for a spot that located at the very end of Broome Street bordering Sixth Avenue. For this French bistro fare fanatic, it was absolutely perfect find.Being lucky enough to score a reservation on last minute notice, I discovered a warm, intimate, and delightful restaurant that serves delicious seafood and steak at very affordable prices. Soupe a l'Oignon Gratinee and Escargots a la Bourguignone were excellent, but the Tournedos Rossini (seared filet mignon topped with fois gras) was just unmatched. Best enjoyed medium-rare, the mignon was juicy and tender while the foie gras was light and smooth as the perfect contrast.  The red wine truffle sauce owns the dish and makes its presence felt with every single bite.While the small space might feel cramped a times, La Sirene is absolutely perfect for parties of two. The waitress had a great sense of humor and could not be friendlier. Would have been the perfect dinner had I brought enough cash (as credit cards are not accepted), so my date would not have to ended up splitting the bill with me. Outside of that little footnote, La Sirene was a wonderful experience worth repeating over and over again.",3,1,7,Nelson W.,"New York, NY",463,564,951
4.0,11/21/2011,"Awesome experience, highly recommended.  Our server Eve was exceptional, catering to our every request and explaining the history and preparation of each menu item.  I think our dinner lasted 3 hours, a testament to authentic French dining.  Apps - Foie Gras and Escargot, both very good.Entrees - Mixed seafood bake with a white cream sauce (excellent), and duck breast (average)Desserts - As other reviewers mentioned, you can skip this.  Not bad, but nothing memorable.  Some whipped cream offering with a burnt crust and the controversial Portofinnos (sp?) (an ice cream sandwich-ish desert that get soupy in minutes).  Ambiance is inviting, but very small, with an exposed kitchen which leads to a noisy dining space.  Not distractingly loud, and after a few drinks your own volume will rise.Total was $120 or something.  For NY, this is not expensive, and actually a good value for the great experience at La Sirene.A huge plus, it is BYOB.  Splurge on two decent bottles of champagne, and you are still out the door for around $200.  Worth every penny.",4,0,3,Sam H.,"San Diego, CA",374,277,20
4.0,11/20/2011,"Delish! I am a huge fan of the sister restaurant Taureau in the east village, so when my boyfriend and I went to La Sirene the other night I was incredibly excited. The food did not disappoint. We had the escargot and the classic mussels as appetizers and both were wonderful. I would have liked the escargot to be a bit more garlic-y, but they were still great. The mussels were perfect, and I would absolutely have them again! For a main dish we had the pork and hanger steak. AMAZING. both were absolutely fantastic and cooked to perfection. The only disappointment were the sides of vegetables, which I personally was not a huge fan of. They give you a plate of purred veggies, which is cute, but I would have preferred something a bit more.... solid.

3.0,11/18/2011,"Overhyped.  3-3.5 stars from me. I would assume that I would fall head over heels over a restaurant with an average rating of 4.5 stars - over 500 reviews. It wasn't way off but a rating of 4.5 stars is too generous. La Sirene offers good (not smack in the face delicious) food that seems expensive due to the portions. What was supposed to be a romantic dinner to celebrate our 4 year anniversary became a family affair. The place wasn't big but not too small. I like cozy but not snug. It is best to either come in a slightly bigger group (4-6) to be seated comfortably with some privacy or request the two small booths right next to the entrance when making a reservation for two. You'll be sharing elbow space with your neighbor otherwise. Wendy G. explains the service quite well - ""eyeing on your wallet and really fake kind of friendly."" It felt a little impolite. Our waitress interrupted us during our conversation to take our order. We were then pressured to place our whole order because the kitchen was busy. A lot of restaurants do this for sure minus accidentally kicking my boyfriend's chair (not apologizing) and taking forever to take away our empty plates. Sure, we did come on what seemed to be a very busy night - at least our side. We couldn't help but to feel underserviced for a 4.5 rated restaurant. Funny because I had a better experience at their sister restaurant, Taureau. As for the food, we started the night off with the roasted escargots and the goat cheese tart as appetizers. For $2+ a piece, the escargots were nothing but average. They do give you a cool gadget to hold the shells though. The goat cheese tart was very tangy.  I couldn't find any of shallot, truffles, and swiss cheese flavors and I personally would have preferred more grapes. We then had two signature main entrees: the seared duck breast and seared filet mignon topped with foie gras. Both were flavored lovely, cooked perfectly and covered with delicious red wine based sauce. The duck dish was light and sweet (with additional salt) while the filet mignon was rich and savory. It would've been even more perfect if each dish were under $30. The complimentary vegetables of pureed cauliflower, pureed carrots, Mexican squash, and butternut squash reminded me of a cross between baby food and a health conscience person's diet food. The pureed cauliflower was the best one out of all four. I think the 4.5 rating has something to do with the BYOB opportunity. Think about it, if two people share one bottle purchased for $14 (usually $30 at a restaurant) = two buzzed/happy people. Happy people = happy reviews. La Sirene's go-to wine store, Hudson Wine & Spirits Inc., does a great job selecting wines.

We had two delicious rounds of the veggies with our meal, which added variety to our meal. Nothing on the menu disappoints.

Third, food - um, again, not good. Mussel appetizer had several mussels that were definitely off (not fresh!)  and made us worry about this place.  The escargot, which appeared nearly instanteously after we ordered them, was too smothered in pesto to discern any real taste.  Although the pesto was good for the bread.  The two entrees were were lamb and steak, yet no steak or sharp knives were provided.  While the hanger steak was cooked fairly close to medium rare, cutting it with a butter knife was a challenge!  I like lamb, but it was.... too lamby.   The sides of vegetables were gross - purueed, lukewarm mush of carrots, cauliflower, squash and something esle - was not at all appetizing.

La Sirene is not white napkin (in fact, the high quality paper napkin is a fair representation of the establishment on the whole). The food is great, with some wonderful countryside dishes; Don't expect the artful, creative and extreme top quality ingredients you would with the true 5 star kitchens in it's category.It is not Daniel or Le Bernadin.. **nor do they try to be**.. it is just worth noting because at a glance on yelp, they can be perceived as direct competitors. Almost a hearty French kitchen with better than average ingredients, though the fairly small portions take the ""hearty"" out of it.. It feels a bit confused imo.I also believe that the BYOB policy leaves diners with a good feeling, and that adds greatly to it's high reviews. In a nut shell; It is excellent French food.. a great place to eat.. unpretentious and comfortable..  Not sure if they want to be mistaken for ""fine dining"" or not, but it is certainly fine dining there.

1.0,11/1/2011,"This place is HORRIBLE!! I would NEVER go here again and I hope this review makes people listen.The SERVERS ARE AWFUL! I have never had such bad service in my life. They are all lazy, stuck-up, selfish foreigners who can barely speak English and do their job. They weren't able to answer my questions as they simply didn't speak the language well enough. All they were interested in was rushing us out and getting their CASH. The servers were  clearly greedy snobbish. The BYOB/CASH ONLY policy was clearly a way for these girls to work under the table and collect as much money as possible. Therefore, they didn't care about the customers AT ALL. They stood behind the host stand all night on the Cell Phones!! Every time I tried to get my servers attention, she was busy texting someone on her cell phone. I saw her go over and do this every few minutes all night. She didn't care about her job at all!I came into this place to spend $$$$ on a very important dinner date, but instead all I got was a big bill and a VERY rude server. They need to hire an American server immediately. It is NOT acceptable to pay that much $ for dinner and not be able to COMMUNICATE. There were NO managers around. No owner. No nothing. It was clear that these girls were running the place and they did a BAD job. It is the owners responsibility... Mr. Pawlicki who I've heard about in reviews... to be RESPONSIBLE with this business and hire competent women and men who can speak English. This is America.

(Big, big plus)Ordered two appetizers: the classic mussels and the goat cheese tart. Mussels were perfectly cooked, in a white wine sauce, and not one mussel was empty. Goat cheese and aged Swiss cheese tart was extremely flavorful and coupled with some mixed greens to calm your mouth down.The quail dish was, again, perfectly cooked and seasoned; a healthy portion as well. The duck breast was also extremely flavorful and the meat was tender and very well prepared. It did seem, to me at least, that the meat was a bit overwhelmed by the sauce it was covered with, not in terms of flavor but quantity. The sauce was a port and red wine sauce. Desert was the Choux puff pastry filled with vanilla whipped cream and fine sugar. I didn't know so I asked what Choux pastry was like and the waitress said ""it's just like a puff pastry"". That was already in the menu but it doesn't really answer my question...I guess the answer I was looking for was: It's a pastry baked without a rising agent. The high moisture content in the dough becomes steam and puffs the pastry during the baking process giving it its light attribute. But it's all good...and so was the espresso.

La Sirene seems to provide every table with an additional special vegetables sides to go with the entree, but I wasn't a big fan of it. I had the big profiterolles for dessert and thought it was good but not something I would want again for dessert.

4.0,10/24/2011,"La Sirène is a charming little restaurant on Broome street practically a stone's throw away from the Holland tunnel. Marseille born chef owner Didier Pawlicki runs the kitchen and somehow manages to find the time to greet and chat with each table. It's a cramped space that seats 25 at most and often times a meal here also means inevitably getting to know the table next to yours. That's part of the charm and Chef Didier's Southern French cooking is certainly worth having to manage in close quarters. The menu varies by the season but the classics such as soupe a l'oignon, pâté, escargots, hanger steak, and roasted leg of lamb are all excellent. The menu may seem a bit on the pricey end for a casual French bistro but the portions are adequate. For dessert the profiteroles are highly recommended. Just don't expect an Americanized overly sweet chocolate sauce. It's French. It's dark chocolate.

TIPS:Many have pointed out, this is BYOB establishment, but there's no corkage fee.  Additionally, reservations are highly recommended in light of their 25-seat capacity.  Lastly, for all the great and wonderful things about La Sirene, on the downside, they only accept cash.  Dinner can be quite pricey, so make sure you visit the ATM before heading over here.  Some guy had to leave his address and work info because he didn't have any cash on hand to pay for his meal and the nearby ATM may not have been working.  So by all means, avoid this embarrassment.  On the other hand though, they do have a $30 pre-fixe menu, so you can still enjoy all things La Sirene but at a cheaper rate:  lasirenenyc.com/menus/la…)This was a really special experience.  What sweetness and enchantment is to be discovered at La Sirene.  I can say I rang in my 20-something birthday in joviality with 'la nourriture excellente' !!!",11,5,11,Jennifer C.,"Elmhurst, NY",559,645,1350

She was very sweet and attentive. Perhaps at times a bit too attentive towards my date, which was fine, because who doesn't want to be with someone who's attractive and wanted by other ladies? The real problem was when I started to have Twilight flashbacks to the scene in the restaurant when Bella gets ignored by the waitress who only has eyes for Edward. By the end of the evening, our waitress began to just ignore my side of the table. We all know that dates can be anxiety-filled , nervous evenings.  And with that in mind, I want the record to show that I suspended all judgment and gave it a good, long mulling over until now. However, there are no if's and's or but's about it...the b*t@h was hittin' on my date! A date's a date. Nothing more, nothing less. I'm not a girl who's about to go marking my territory by peeing at the side of the table, or shootin' dirty looks. And more power to the girl who sees what or who she wants and makes a play for it. But, let's keep it classy, San Diego. Do your job, lady. Since my observation of how this waitress treated my date is hearsay and could be colored through my own insecurities and perceptions, here are the facts: A) She never refilled or asked if I wanted a refill on my side veggies. This would not normally be viewed as anything, but in the light of visiting our table for multiple trips to ""check on us,"" refilling an empty plate seems like it would be a normal part of her duties.B) Towards the end of the evening, even though my water glass was the empty one and sitting near my date's, she proceeded to top off his glass and left mine completely empty.C) About half-way into the main meal, she stopped making eye contact with me and completely ignored my presence at the table.For my part in all this, perhaps being a good sport and just ignoring it wasn't the way to go. Takeaways. I can't say that I am any better prepared to handle a situation like this in the future, but I know not to come here on a date.",2,19,0,Cristina L.,"South Slope, Brooklyn, NY",393,24,2
4.0,10/8/2011,"Quaint, friendly restaurant just a short walk from our hotel. Tiny, but well-spaced seating (acoustics still make it a bit too loud) and warm lighting make it quite romantic. The food is very good as well! We shared the seafood au gratin (beautifully cooked and fresh-tasting seafood) and the hanger steak (garlicy, buttery sauce was addictive!) The sauces are decadent and not exactly low-cal, but the portions are small (read - not Midwest-sized portions), so the guilt is minimal. So minimal that we ended with the ice cream-filled, chocolate sauce covered profiteroles. Delicious! Topping everything off was their byob policy. This is a deal that's hard to beat and makes me wish this place was in my neighborhood. I would definitely be a regular.",0,0,0,Eme L.,"Mountain View, CA",42,606,337

5.0,9/26/2011,"After professing my love for French food one evening to a close friend, he recommended this lovely find.  And to top it all off, it's BYO.  Luckily for me, I have been saving a few bottles of red, just for this kind of occasion.Shortly after learning about this place (i.e. less than a week later), I just had to try it and was thrilled at this discovery.  The food was, in short, spectacular.  Everything, I mean everything, was perfectly seasoned without being too salty...and piping hot straight from the kitchen.  I don't know about you, but I am always happy to have food that's almost too hot.  I enjoy savoring the dinner, and throughout the dinner conversation, it's always nice that the food is still hot at the end of the meal.There were so many delicious-sounding things on the menu, my favorite dinner companion (one of my best girlfriends and fellow self-proclaimed foodie) and I had a difficult time narrowing down our choices.  In fact, we already selected what we're going to order upon our return.  At long last, we ended up going with the Escargots (how could we refuse this dish? It's always a favorite of ours and the way that this was served/prepared did not let us down...as usual, with Escargot...I'm always left wanting more) and the Mussels in Curry Sauce (after reading some of the other Yelp reviews, I had to try it...and again, superb...what a great start to our meal).  For entrees, we decided to try the Cassoulet (another ""must have"" of mine if I ever see it on the menu...again, piping hot, rich, and succulent) and the Filet Mignon with foie gras (swoon-worthy to say the least).  Due to the richness of both dishes (what can I say, we are meat-lovers), we opted to box some of both dishes so we can partake in the desserts.  We sampled the Meringue with Crème Anglaise and the Cake with Crème Anglaise.  (Apparently, we are also Crème Anglaise lovers.)  Both were portioned nicely and not too heavy or rich; a great ending to a wonderful meal.  I look forward to returning again soon.",1,0,0,Nina R.,"New York, NY",22,32,4

This impression continued when we got our apps...I got the goat cheese tart, and she got the mussels in the curry broth and both of us were very happy with our choices. The entrees: I got the filet with the foie gras and I thought it was very good, but it didn't reach my expectations. I was expected to be wowed because of all of the great reviews. My girlfriend got the duck breast and was displeased with it being a little too well done for her liking. The dessert was a very nice ending to an overall nice meal.

Hubby got the Tournedos Rossini (seared filet mignon over bread with foie gras (pate style) shallots, port & red wine truffle sauce). This thing was just as decadent as it sounds. The meat was high quality and the foie gras was the best I've ever tried. I oped for the Kassulet Touloussain De La Maison (cannellini beans, tomato, garlic duck confit, slab bacon & pork sausage all braised with DUCK FAT)! Delicious but very, very heavy.It was a wonderful night with impeccable service, cozy atmosphere, and terrific meal!

4.0,9/12/2011,"This place is great, not just for the food but for the attentive and warm service.  Since Flex Mussels couldn't accommodate a group of 7, I  called La Sirene even though I knew it was small and would probably not be able to accommodate a bigger group on a Saturday night with such short notice.  Instead I found them to be very accommodating with our changing group size as I was firming up the reservation, and they tried their best to fit us in a 2 hour slot on a busy Saturday night.  I've come across many restaurants in the city that can be fairly curt, and La Sirene was nothing but wonderful.  The food was great too.  Entrees are not on the cheap side, but they come with an unlimited spread of veggies on the side that included cauliflower, carrots, pineapple, and roasted turnip.   And, of course, it's BYOB with no corkage fee.  For as many bottles as you want.   This is literally as good as it gets.  My friends who had the filet mignon with foie gras and seared duck breast both enjoyed their dishes.   If you want more flavorful mussels, don't go for the classic.  We ordered the Profiterolles with bittersweet chocolate at the suggestion of the waitress, and while it was good, it wasn't amazing and probably not worth almost $14.  Their other desserts, however, sound delectable and will definitely be sampling those next time.  Overall I was very impressed with the quality of food and the genuine attention to service here.  I've already recommended a colleague looking to take friends to a French spot in the city.  Four stars for now -- I look forward to coming back and trying the other entrees.",0,0,0,Lu H.,"New York, NY",1218,411,1977

First, the waitress did not bring me a salad (everyone at my table could have a complimentary salad as part of a prix fixe).  She said she gave it to someone else at my table, and blamed that person for taking the salad.  Not bringing me the salad - that's ok, she's human, but she blamed someone else, not good. Then, there was a water leak from the ceiling that first poured water all along my left leg, then when I moved over, I had the misfortune of putting my head under another water leak.  The waitress did not handle this professionally at all, and found excuses rather than at least simply saying ""sorry about that"". Then, the waitress brought me the wrong entree.  I ordered the gratin.  There is a big difference between how one pronounces Gratin vs Duck or Canard.  No big deal, right, it's human to make a mistake taking an order.  But then the waitress blames me, and says ""I will bring you YOUR duck anyway"".  Really?Unbelievable.I've been here once before and was quite happy.  I found the appetizers to be very very good (better than the entrees which were good but not outstanding), and BYOW is always nice.  And other than having water pouring on my head, it's a nice setting.  But after the above experience, I want to give this restaurant -10 stars.",0,0,0,Lylan M.,"Manhattan, NY",77,46,1

Holy moley, this was absolutely luscious. My boyfriend is not a big fan of goat cheese, and we practically got into a fork stabbing war for the last few bits of it. Very rich but not overwhelmingly so. A++Entree: Duck breast with cherry and red wine sauce. Cooked perfectly and in such a generous portion. I liked it a lot, but ended up eating more of my boyfriend's dish -- a medium rare veal chop. Ohhh so tender. My carnivorous side was in full effect as we cleaned up those two plates between the two of us.BY THE WAY! With your entree, you get served a plate with four vegetable side dishes on them. I believe they were a cauliflower puree, carrot puree, spinach, and some other light green vegetable I can't recall just now. All of them were deliciously flavorful. Such wonderful compliments to our meat-heavy dishes... we polished those off too.Dessert: Rum flavored cake over creme anglaise. What a wonderful ending to our meal!

I went for my wedding anniversary and had reservations, but waiting for the wife to get dress made us late. We got there and they moved a few reservations around for us but we would have to wait about 30 min for a table. OK? Since, they are BYOB they recommended a wine place a few blocks away. So we walked over and got a bottle, as we got back the lady inside saw us returning with BYOB in hand and came out and got the bottle from us. She later returned with two glasses and served our drinks outside (lucky we were parked right in front). Oh, did I mention it was raining...yes she came out in the rain to serve us curb side in our car. WOW! My wife was really impressed and it made the anniversary dinner even more special...SCORE! Thanks 'La Sirene'.  A short few minutes later, she had the table ready - it was less than the 30 min she had estimated, even better. OK, so we got our seats and it's a bit small of a place. Elbow to elbow seating (plus I'm a big guy)...Service was prompt with excellent recommendations and immediate follow up ALL night to ensure we were OK for everything, from our drinks to the dishes...this while they were at full seating capacity, how they managed that was amazing. Oh, we were told they are moving next door. It's a bigger place so their seating would be better...plus. Also another good thing, they didn't rush us. Even though they were filled and there was a party waiting for our seats they never rushed us. We only got the bill once we requested it. I thank them for that, most places with customers waiting will rush you out and start picking up your dishes before your even finished, they never did that. They let us sit and enjoy the meal. Once again....great service. As the starters came...wow the details to the dishes were excellent / flavor was great - not lacking but not slapping you in the face either.Everything blended just right together. We started with steam clams, and ordered the fish special for the night and steak. Both were great with excellent portions and side dishes great for a date, not too heavy but enough to fill you. We were about to skip on dessert but changed our minds, thank god! It was heaven, I would place their desserts in competition with most dessert cafes in the city. They were on par; seem like they were made fresh in house.....not sure, but still wow!Just writing this review makes me want to go back...So why did they get 4 stars and not 5 stars. One reason, the place they had was small and needed maintenance. The group next to us complained of water leaking from the roof as it was raining. But as I said they were moving next door to a new location. So hopefully this won't be a problem any longer.

She was absolutely charming and a great hostess/server--she engaged and told us about Mr P. and his experience in NY but retreated when we wanted to talk amongst ourselves.  We had the Moules Marinieres and the Escargots a la Bourguignone to start and the Onglet Poêlè a là Facon Luchonaise and Filet Mignon de Porc Poelee Aux Morilles as entrees.  The entrees were outstanding--best hanger steak I have ever had (and it's my favorite cut).  This is a gem--the only draw back is that the location is a bit wonky between Soho and Tribeca but that's great for those of us who are locals!  Bring your own wine and cash.,1,0,0,michael b.,"Elk Rapids, MI",0,64,0

4.0,7/10/2011,"Went here for the first time on Friday for dinner. Before entering you could already smell the deliciousness seeping out of the place. When entering you first notice that it's definitely on the smaller end giving it that cozy atmosphere. Having a light lunch I was eager to order and eager to drink (BYOB). Can't say I paid much attention to the decor, place was lit by candles (kind of dark) and I was probably too hungry to care. With that being said here's the breakdown:Appetizers: 1) Escargot: Prepared in a garlicky butter but not overpowering in flavor. The escargot was cooked just right which left no rubbery texture at all that you might typically get.2) Moules Vignerones: The sauce is definitely good (great dipping for bread) but the mussels were disappointing. It couldve been that we just had a bad batch but it left me scarred and probably wouldn't get it again. You get approx 20-25 mussels in the smaller size, 5 of them arrived unopened (not fresh) and a 1/3 that I had were sandy. I would recommend you skip these and go to flex mussels if that's you're craving.Entrees: 1) Filet Mignon: Must get if you're a steak fan. The only only thing I regret is that it was on the smaller end and therefore wasn't enough. I ordered it medium and it came out more towards the medium rare side which is what I was hoping. Like butter, it just melts in your mouth. I've been to a couple of ""high end"" steakhouses and haven't found a steak quite as tender. Maybe it's the foie gras, maybe it's the sauce, or maybe it's the TLC the chef puts into it? All I know is it's good.2) Hanger Steak: Almost just as tender as the filet mignon, this one comes out already cut for you. Another solid choice for those who aren't  a fan of foie gras.3) Duck: Arrives cut just like the hanger steak. A bit tougher than the steaks, still as enjoyable. Thought the sauce would be more sweet/tart but it was definitely still savory.Dessert: Lava Cake: Decently made, served with whipped cream and a scoop of ice-cream which was a great way to finish the meal. Per the menu it is a dark chocolate lava cake so it's a bit on thte bitter end. If you're not a fan of dark chocolate I'd skip this.Service: Attentive waitresses, wine glass never went empty and didn't feel suffocated or neglected. Very friendly and eager to help with the selections.Overall: Will definitely be back. However, I would recommend you skip out on the appetizers and go for another entree. The entrees are really on point here.",0,0,0,J T.,"Flushing, NY",2,13,16
4.0,7/8/2011,"Firstly hats off to the great accomodating and attentive service. We were in a little bit of a rush to catch a show and the waitress somehow remembered that I had mentioned this over the phone. She got us two seats and hastened our orders. The food was Fantastic, capital fuhreaking ""F"". Baked seafood- delicious sauce/ broth, I soaked up everything with their great tasting sourdough bread. It had fish, scallops, shrimp, octopus, and baked with a crunchy gratin top with a creamy sort of sauce. Leg of lamb - perfectly cooked at medium. Also soaked up the sauce with bread as well. They also give you a variety plate of veggies which you can get more of upon request.CASH ONLY! A little bit on the noisier and slightly cramped side.BYOB, no corkage fee! AND they'll LITERALLY order you a deliverable bottle of wine from a nearby liquor store if you really want one.

5.0,7/6/2011,"A little gem in the South Village with simple and exquisite French fare by Chef Didier Pawlicki. I've been here twice and loved each experience. The first time I came here was years ago it seemed smaller than it is now. The service is still very friendly and accomodating. I recommend making reservations before hand as it tends to get busy. But despite it's popularity, you can be easily whisked away with the ambiance. The space has a very romantic feel and perfect for a special dinner with a special someone. Or you can come with a small group of friends for an intimate dinner. As soon as you walk in,you are immidiately seduced with the aromas from the open kitchen and taken to the South of France. The maitre'd suggests that you bring something to drink as they are BYOB. There is also no corkage fee. What a deal! It's the perfect place to share a special bottle of wine. If you don't happen to have that special bottle, there is a store nearby that delivers to the restaurant for you. How convenient!I am a big fan of duck, and their duck breast is very tasty here. A heaping portion of game with a port and red wine reduction, cooked to your liking ( I recommend medium-rare). What a classic dish. You can then share an small array of sides from mashed cauliflower and sweet potato. All of their dishes are so amazing. Don't skip on their appetizers either. I'm always a fan of the escargot and foie gras, and the mussels are great to share. Dessert is also a must. There's really only two choices I struggle with and that's the Lava chocolate cake or the humungous profiterolles with bittersweet chocolate lovingly drizzled. You can't go wrong either way. You can certainly fall in love at this place. At least fall in love with the food that is. =) I would normally like to keep special gems like this place to myself, but I'll be nice and share it with fellow yelpers this time around.",2,0,1,Dee D.,"San Francisco, CA",34,113,20

5.0,6/25/2011,"This is my favorite neighborhood gem, especially before its expansion into the current much bigger space. Its increasing popularity is well-deserved so I'm happy for the French owner/chef Didier.The menu is simple and authentic French with 6 main entrees. Never actually dared to try its signature Duck confit, slab bacon & pork sausage dish that sounds like what the Vikings ate during one of its conquests instead of a French fare.Escargots are perfectly made, buttery and garlicy but not overwhelmingly so. The other signature ""Magret De Canard"" - duck breast with cherry is my favorite dish here. The port and red wine sauce, which they also use for the steak is out of this world. Only comparable sauce to this I've had was in Florence where I had steak with a blueberry balsamic sauce.The Filet Mignon is my husband's favorite with the best foie gras in the city sitting on top of the steak.The Roasted lamb leg and Pork loin are also fantastic. The best part about dining here (in addition to the aforementioned mouthwatering items) is the variety of sautéed or puréed vegetables that are served complimentary with your entrees.

My first thought was 'What the f*&% did you do to the bread???' and then you take in the flavor of the fruit, foie gras and char together, and you are in heaven.  Quite well done, if it was intentional (more on playing with fire below). For entrees we had the pork tenderloin and the duck, and the sides of pureed cauliflower, squash,etc.   The duck was amazing, but overcooked a bit and heavily loaded with sauce, very much in a french bistro style on the streets of Paris, but a bit too saucy for my taste.  The pork tenderloin was also cooked further than requested but very tasty.  between the toast, pork and duck all showing signs of being exposed to a solar flare or something, I'm thinking perhaps the kitchen had someone with a heavy hand at the broiler and the sauce ladle...The clincher was definitely the staff.

2.0,6/7/2011,"After reading many positive reviews on Yelp I had high expectations for La Sirene.  In my opinion, this restaurant is very overrated.My main complaint about this restaurant is that the prices are quite high relative to the quality of the cooking and the experience.  The cooking here is competent, but nothing special.  The two small dining rooms are clean and decently appointed, but again nothing special.  Even so, appetizers and desserts are $13-$15+ each and mains in the $30+ zone, but the food and experience don't match those price levels.It may sound petty, but when I have a dinner costing $70+ per person (excluding drinks -- no liquor license here) I expect the kitchen fumes to be ventilated to the outside, not to the inside of the restaurant.  I expect attentive service, not average service; cloth napkins, not paper; and good bread that's been warmed rather than very average chewy bread.Noise levels in the restaurant are high -- it's all hard surfaces with a fairly low ceiling.  They do not take credit cards, which is surprising given the aforementioned high prices.This is not a bad restaurant -- but it does not deserve the lavish praise on Yelp or the lavish prices on its menu.",1,0,0,Jon P.,"New York, NY",0,41,0

My mom and I ordered the mussels (classic) and the filet mignon with foie gras. The mussels were AWESOME. If you go to La Sirene, someone in your group HAS to get the mussels. It's a must. The classic is SO good. Some may say simple, but I like it simple. The broth was SO good with the bread. I ate the whole basket. The filet was delicious, but very rich. That sauce and foie gras makes it a very heavy and rich dish. The assorted vegetables that come with it are amazing though. Carrot puree, cauliflower puree, sauteed green beans, and roasted zucchini and tomatoes. SO good. I ate all of my vegetables before I even finished the filet, which is rare. For dessert, we got the meringue. It was light and perfect after the rich filet mignon dish. It was very very good. Perfect ending to a wonderful meal. The service was SO impressive.

4.0,5/7/2011,"Upon first entering La Sirene, I was a little taken aback by the decor. Or, rather, the lack-thereof. Seriously, not a thing on the walls and some very unassuming light fixtures overhead. Talk about taking minimalism to the max. I thought this was supposed to be some bougie, semi-expensive French joint.But, as we've all probably learned the hard way one time or another, looks aren't everything. La Sirene is not about presentation or flashiness or even wall art, apparently. They are about excellent French cuisine. And an empty plate is the only canvas they need.First off, everything on the menu looks tremendous. And, with four choices of mussels, you gotta go with one of these to start off the night right and let me suggest the Moules Rochelaisses (Steamed Mussels with Curry, Diced Apples and Light Cream). I've only seen mollusks bigger in Europe herself, so La Sirene deserves some credit on super-size alone. And while you would think the bread to be excellent, it's honestly nothing special - until you dip it in the curry-cream broth and then we are talking about something different altogether.My entree, the Tournedos Rossini (Seared Filet Mignon over Bread Toasted with Foie Gras Pate-Style, Shallots, Port & Red Wine Truffle), it's safe to say, was like no other steak I've had. And, trust me, I'm quite the carnivore, so I've had my fair share of the good stuff. I've noticed most French restaurants will often cook your steak one level closer to well done than requested, but I took the chance at La Sirene, asked for it medium, and received just that. The final product was one of the most tender, flavorful cuts of filet mignon thine buds have had the pleasure of tasting. The port and red wine truffle sauce, which nearly had the steak submerged, as well as every other inch of the plate, was just fantastic - really, that added component to skyrocket the dish to superstardom. Originally cast in the role of the scene-stealer, the foie gras was quite the luxurious touch, but I can't say it added much else to the dish. The toast upon which the filet mignon sat was so small and soggy, the superior sauce simply rendered it unnecessary. They didn't hurt the dish, but a steak this perfect and a sauce this deliciously complementary doesn't really need the extra help.The seating is a bit tight, which is to be expected in Manhattan. However, the tables themselves were so small that it was quite the balancing act to keep everything on the table at once. The waitress at one point rested the bread basket atop the brim of the water jug because there was just nowhere else to put it. And then there was the one couple's wine bottle that fell off the edge and ended up splashing us, but thankfully, never shattered.And yet I can somehow look past these inconveniences and look back fondly on the exceptional cuisine. Plus, it's BYOB and you don't get enough of those in the city. La Sirene may look like that dining room of the apartment where the house-warming party came a bit too soon, but when the food itself can transport you to the south of France in just one mouthful, well, you can just let your tastebuds do all the talkin'.",6,3,5,Dan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",633,551,148
2.0,5/3/2011,"Monday night and all tables taken. Here's an odd thing: the restaurant is two rooms of equal size. The first room was being used but the second had upturned tables and a tarp over stuff. That was my girlfriend's view from our table. If they are renovating, why not just put up a curtain? No explanation...The goat's cheese tart was burned on top, as was crust on one side. The mussels were nice and the Cassoulet was a winner. So was the skate. Service was pleasant and efficient until we were too full for dessert and and a smarmy comment was made when we declined looking at dessert menu. Which was odd.Pleasant place but cooking wasn't up to par for the $31 mains, although BYOB takes price down. Much better at Nice Matin on UWS or Parigot on Grand.",2,0,0,Gaby F.,"Geneva, IL",9,272,54
5.0,4/28/2011,"Let me tell you, the smell from La Sirene slaps you silly and shakes you crazy until you step foot inside. I stumbled into La Sirene after attempting to visit their neighboring restaurant, Ivo & Lulu. Since I&L was closed, I followed the amazing smell of French buttery goodness like it was a trail to El Dorado and tripped into a seat. The whole menu speaks to the true French person I am. Tartiflette, escargots, goat cheese tartlettes, frog legs, HOLY gruyere; this place is heaven...well...it would be if you could bring your own wine to heaven! BONUS! I asked the sweet waitress for the grilled octopus and mussels marinieres. The quality of food here is unbelievable - I can't believe I've never heard of it! The octopus was tender and cooked in a way I've never had. Tons of different spices with mushrooms. I love when dishes surprise and excite me! I tried to place what region of France the chef was from and I just couldn't. I asked the waitress..she shrugged and said, ""He's French."" Where ever he is from, I'm pretty positive he took a detour to Africa with those crazy spices. They were definitely not from my region, Alsace! The mussels were so delicious and cooked in a broth with a generous portion of butter (not complaining!). Everything that came out of the kitchen smelled amazing. My friend had the lamb which was perfectly cooked - medium rare - in a great sauce! I have to come back and get the tournedos in a foie gras sauce! Oh, you read that right - foie gras sauce! This place is not for the calorie conscious! I cannot rave about this place enough. I rarely rarely find a place where everything is perfection. The decoration, the waitress, the food, the price, the ambiance - I may have found my culinary El Dorado!",2,0,1,Pauline M.,"New York, NY",103,27,60
5.0,4/25/2011,"Awesome food, large portions. I especially enjoy the unlimited veggie side dishes. Everything here is cooked to perfection. I haven't had one disappointing dish. If I had to pick one thing that stands out among others, it is the octopus appetizer. The dish is so much more than just octopus, there's a whole medley of beautifully combined veggies and spices, and the whole thing just comes together perfectly. Compared with many other French places in Manhattan, Le Sirene offers better (and often more) food, at cheaper prices. It's a no brainer choice.One complaint is the seating. The wooden benches against the wall is somewhat uncomfortable. There's a big gap between the bench and the wall, so it's really tricky to balance your bag on the bench without it falling through the gap (it happened a couple of times while I was there). Another complaint is the lack of lighting. I know restaurants are supposed to create ambiance with low lighting, but I think La Sirene has crossed the limit of ambiance and spookiness.  Just a thoughtLooking forward to come again!",0,0,0,Emma T.,"San Francisco, CA",3,81,26
5.0,4/19/2011,"Generally, I'm not the type that would review a restaurant twice unless it merits an encore and here at La Sirene, it surely did. When I came here last night I've discovered that they have just renovated and re-opened two days ago to meta-morph themselves into a very classy, sophisticated yet relaxing and cozy environment for patrons to enjoy both restaurant and food to it's absolute max. After returning twice (before and after it's renovation) I'm still very much impressed with their dishes where taste has not been sacrificed. I ended up ordering their hanger steak and lets just say that one bite will turn your tongue into a spectrum where food are speared into the tongue with a flavor of colors that turns into a rainbow as you'll attempt to figure the complexity, yet simple ingredients that was used to create such harmonious symphony.Overall, I was completely in awe with the restaurant and their service was absolutely splendid with details and attentiveness. I seriously can not recommend this place any further!

5.0,4/16/2011,"I have been to La Sirene before, two years ago. I think it took that long to burn off the calories from my last meal, but so worth it! We came with a bottle of white wine and were corgially greeted by two waitresses, one Irish, one Polish, both super friendly. You get to know people quite well here, since everyone's so squished together! Let's see, for appetizers we ordered the baby octopus salad and the escargot. The baby octopus salad was served warm, and was a little peppery, with tender flavorful octopus, young salad greens, peppers, and lot's of garlic! The escargot was served in the shell, very tender and fresh, with of course, garlic and butter. For dinner I had the Kassoulet, which I can barely describe how fabulous it was, but you had to know how much I loved it due to the fact that all I left in the pot was bare duck leg bones. Very rich, the best part actually was the beans, which had soaked up all the flavors from the meat they were cooked with. My sister had the seafood medely which she liked very much and my mother had a special cooked order of grouper, because of her allergy to onions, which always makes for a chef's challenge in the kitchen! For dessert we had the profiterole's of course, the meringue, and the only think that I wasn't crazy about which was the rum cake. It was this tiny cake, and very airy, it took about three bites to eat it, just not my thing I guess.

5.0,4/2/2011,"found this place on yelp, was excited about coming here, reading the menu online (almost to the point of memorizing it) before I got here.  I LOVE french food. LOVE. LOVE. LOVE CHEESE! , wine, the meat, seafood, way of preparation, herbs, etc etc.. But I don't love over priced and overly-americanized  ""french"" food. This place fits exactly what I like. We order the goat cheese tart, steamed mussels(small size, but actually really big portion) and braised lamb shank. It was a hard decision ordering because I actually wanted to order everything. But I've made the decision to come back until I've had everything on the menu so I just ordered whatever I felt like having at the moment. The tart was creamy and delicious. The plate is bordered with a citrus-y red sauce that goes well with the grapes hiding inside of the tart.. The 90-day aged swiss cheese on top is more amazing, it is sweet and seed-y.. like a cranberry. The tiny crunchy seeds is a good contrast to the soft mushy cheese. But in opinion, the creme of the crop of that dish is the 90 days aged cheese on top of the tart. Mussels were great! They were simmered in wine to perfection. The white wine sauce is brothy and creamy, onion is soft but crispy. Eating just the mussel is very different from sucking the juice from the shell. I personally would suck the juice while grabbing the meat with my teeth from the shell in one motion but to not embarrass my date, I only did it twice. hah. Braised lamb shank I did not eat too much since it wasn't my entree but it was delish. We did order the popular dessert but canceled because we were so full already! Since I did make a goal of having everything on the menu, good things are always worth the wait.

We ordered the filet mignon and vegetable platter. Filet Mignon was exquisite per my Brother's comments and my vegetable platter was lovely. The desert of Profiterole was tres delicieux as well.HIGHLY RECOMMENDCons (although not really a Con)1) Was hoping to meet the charming and famed Chef himself-in addition to the french accented hostess, but to no avail. Maybe I have to come on a Friday or weekend night?2) The location can be good and bad. It's a little ways away from the main restaurants that I'm used to eating in NY, but perhaps this out of place-ness adds to the allure and charm of the place.3) We did wait a little longer for our entrees than I thought was necessary-at least it seemed like a good 30 minute wait. Maybe this was just due to the kitchen aromas smelling so wonderful.Overall, wonderful experience, and I have already recommended to my friends.

So I stared at the menu for a good 10 mins and could not decide what to get? Part of me REALLY want to get their signature Skate Fish again because it was just soooo good, but part of me wanted to try something new. My fiance suggested that I get 2 entrees so I don't have to decide, but then I would feel bad for not being able to finish everything. O trust me, it was such a dilemma! =P Eventually, I decided to try their ""Tournedos Rossini"" and give myself a good reason to come back for that Skate Fish soon! My fiance ordered the Lamb Leg: Steak de Gigot d'Agneau Poêle Crème D'Ail, and we shared the half dozen escargots for appetizer. The escargots are always great and garlic just makes everything better =) Now the lamb leg was excellent excellent! I am not a huge lamb fan but I had more than just a bite of his entree this time; the meat was so tender and flavorful that I could not believe I would actually like lamb so much! Then, I had a bite of my own entree and it was amazing as well. The foie gras melted in my mouth and my medium rare Filet Mignon was done just right. Chilled foie gras coupled with hot steak, it was definitely an interesting/creative combination, and a successful one too. On the side, we were again offered the complimentary veggies/veggie mash; it was a colorful dish with mashed califlower, butternut squash, string beans, and mashed carrots; we liked them all~For dessert, we tried the their homemade ice cream/sorbet; we wanted coconut (sorbet), white chocolate (Ice cream) and dark chocolate (ice cream), but they ran out of coconut, so we had mango (sorbet) instead. I have to say that we both liked their mango sorbet better than the chocolate ice creams. Now we just HAVE to come back for the coconut!Overall, another great experience at La Sirene. I will be back for the Skate Fish and Coconut Sorbet soon! In the meantime, if you get to go before me, don't forget it's BYOB and Cash Only! ENJOY!",2,0,1,Nancy L.,"Bridgewater, NJ",114,309,310

I went to La Sirene based on the high Yelp ratings and I was very disappointed. First of all, this place is not cheap: $32.50 for the duck breast entree. I love duck and have had a lot of good duck dishes in my time. What arrived was a plate with a big thick pool of gloppy, almost black sauce on top of a few thinly sliced pieces of duck. The duck was totally overpowered by this gelatinous overly sweet sauce. I couldn't taste the meat. There was not a shred of nuance in that dish.

If a place doesn't satisfy, there are twenty more down the block.I am pleased to announce that La Sirene is everything but a disappointment. I came here last night, a pretty slow Tuesday at around 7pm. My lady friend and I brought 3 bottles of wine (Champagne, white and red) to enjoy during our heavily anticipated  dinner. You have to take advantage of a BYOB joint with no corkage. Our waitresses were quickly hospitable in taking the wine off our hands and storing it properly, and immediately opened the bubbly for us to begin our evening.We had reviewed the menu online, so we pretty much knew what we wanted to order, but then came the specials. She had me at veal chop, and then had me again at port mushroom sauce. Sold. Since there was so much wine, it seemed in our best interest to course things out a bit, so we began with the Foie Gras and the Moules Vignerones (translates to freaking unbelievable mussels). Mussels done right, I tell you, with red wine, mushrooms, tomato, onion, garlic and bacon. The Foie Gras was a very generous portion and came with grilled bread and some fall spiced jam thing. Great, rich combo that melted with the Champagne. Good call.Next course, Goat Cheese Tart. This chevre chaud had incredible balance, achieving pungency with the goat cheese, savory notes from the shallots, sweetness from the raisins, body and aroma from the truffles, and finally a subtle nuttiness from the aged Swiss. A must have.And for the real hit of the evening, the Veal Chop. Honestly, this is one of the best things I have ever eaten. Perfectly cooked and matched with some sort of port-mushroom sauce. You know something is outstanding when you can't take the time to stop eating when asked if everything is to your liking. On the plate was a sweet potato casserole and there was also plentiful plate of sides for the table: haricot verts, eggplant, cauliflower and carrot purée. My girlfriend's seabass was good, but clearly outshines by this magnificent veal. Thank you, special of the day.Dessert was an easy choice. Profiteroles. Keep them just the way they are, Chef Didier. They're perfect. All this being told, WE WILL BE BACK. This is saying a lot coming from me. Like I said, I'm picky. We will probably check out Taureau in the East Village first, the fondue concept by the same chef. Only suggestion: I wish there were linens instead of paper napkins.

Got seated right away (it was a slower night). Everything was DELICIOUS. Escargot was amazing, but they gave very little of it in the huge shells. (First time trying it) Had the goat cheese tart due to the Yelp recommendation, filet mignon with the foie gras, and the seared duck. The filet with the foie gras was excellent! Topped it off with the Iles Fontantes dessert which was the best part of the meal. Light, and not too sweet. PERFECTION. It was quite the experience. It is so awesome that you can order any beverage from Hudson Wine (e got a 2006 St. Julien, YUM) and it shows up within minutes. And the waitress kept looking out for the person to get here to serve us the wine. That being said, the service was amazing in the beginning and the middle. We were alone after the first wave of diners left around 9 so great service. But after 9:30, a lot of people came in and the service slowed down due to there being only one waitress. She took a while to bring us the check, which is why 1 star is deducted. Would have deducted only .5 for it. But still, it was a great experience for both my parents and me. Would go back anytime but seems like it is much better suited for a date night so next time I will go with a date ;)",0,0,0,Stacey C.,"Denver, CO",43,7,1

The waitress is super nice and easy to talk with. My friend was a vegetarian, he was going to order a veggie dish, but the waitress kindly suggested the goat cheese tart, and it was great, very delicious! I had escargot and lamb legs, they were both good. And i really like the veggie dish that comes with my main course too. They were very flavorful and made me like the vegetables that i normally do not eat. The waitress said they are going to expand the store next door, and the owner of the restaurant also has another French restaurant in east village called Taureau, which is also very well rated on yelp. I went to the restaurant wanting to know more about french food for a tabletop design project i am currently working on, and the waitress kindly tried to answer my questions, and I thought she was the owner of the restaurant. The owner of the restaurant used to have a restaurant in Paris.

3.0,2/14/2011,"Since there are no half stars, I'll round up my rating to a 3. My wife and I visited La Sirene for dinner - wedding anniversary and valentine's day. Appetizer:Goat Cheese Tart - Pretty good but nothing out of this world as described by several other reviewers.Entrees:Seared Hangar Steak - The highlight of our visit. The roasted garlic and parsley sauce was fantastic. This dish beat out the filet mignon I ordered.Seared Filet Mignon - Meh. I've had better. I expected this dish to be a knock out but it failed to deliver an ""absolute luxury"" (the dish's description on the menu) taste or experience. The best part of this dish was the port & red wine truffle sauce. If the sauce wasn't so good, I would've sent the dish back.Dessert:Didn't bother since we weren't impressed with the entrees.Service:Great but nothing extraordinary. I expect to be served with a smile, have a dropped fork replaced and a bottle of wine un corked at a BYOB restaurant.I can't remember where - I read that the owner/chef isn't in on Sundays. Could that be the reason I'm not going crazy over this place like a majority of the yelpers? Even so, owner in or not, I would expect the same taste regardless of which day it is.Will I go back?

After I pulled out my BYOB bottles, she promptly noticed a bottle of beer among them and offered to put it on ice while I waited for the rest of my party. It felt as if she treated me more as a friend than a patron. Combined with the small space of the restaurant, eating at La Sirene feels like going to an old friend's house for dinner -- except your friend can cook some of the best French food in the city.

5.0,1/23/2011,"Based on the raves on Yelp I reserved a table for a late dinner on a Friday night, thinking the crowd may have thinned-out a bit and the noise level would be reasonable.  It's an important consideration when dining with this particular dinner date.   She's a low talker and I usually spend the evening hunched over the table trying to hear what she's saying.No such luck on this night.  At 11 pm it was still packed and noisy as a dog fight at Michael Vick's farm.  Our table wasn't ready when we walked in, but that was forgiven as soon as the friendly waitress began apologizing in her French accent.  (I'm a sucker for pretty women that speak in foreign accents, but I swear this place deserves five stars on it's other merits.)Some recommendations:  As many of the other Yelpers have pointed out, the goat cheese tart is fantastic.  Come here for that alone.  You can order the Filet like everyone else, or step out and be adventurous with the duck or pork tenderloin.    Both seemed more authentic to me and you won't be disappointed with either. As everyone else has pointed out, it's a bring our own wine place.  What they don't point out is it's also a DBYCC (don't bring your credit card) place.  Cash only.  I had to make a little trip to the ATM four blocks away and was pretty peeved when I got back, until the lovely and apologetic hostess started talking in her damn French accent again.",1,2,0,Zorro B.,"Portland, OR",0,5,0

On the side, a nice Lambrusco that the fine people at Hudson wines recommended and duly brought.  The goat cheese tart gets 5 *****s all by itself.  It's great.  The strong goat cheese flavour is perfectly balanced with the crumbliness of the tart crust.My mussels were alright, not overwhelmingly amazing, but still delicious as steamed mussels in a light cream sauce generally are.But the piece de resistance of the night was the bf's filet mignon.  He apportioned each bite to have some of the tender filet, creamy and buttery foie gras, mashed sweet potatoes, and plenty of sweet and tasty sauce; with each bite, his countenance transformed into one of the utterly sublime.  I'm sure I had the same expression with the two bites he allowed me.In all other regards, ambiance, service, etc...

Since I don't drink, this wasn't too much of a perk for me (but I guess it helps the bottom line since the alcohol does tend to increase the tax & tip immensely). This is a really quaint location. She invited a total of about 20 people (after looking at the space, I was seriously wondering why). This wasn't a turn off. After all, we ARE in Manhattan. However with the space, there were only two other patrons in the whole restaurants. I didn't like that we were constantly being hushed by the waitresses. The other patrons weren't complaining and we really weren't making that much noise (Tuesday after work..everyone is too tired). When the food arrived, we were astonished at the portions. The hanger steak about 6 or 7 of us ordered was JUST A BIT too small for an entree. And the side dishes were more for the table to share, and not individual courses.

5.0,12/11/2010,"This evening it was my turn to choose dinner.  I managed to find a review on Le Sirene on yelp, and immediately told el novio to make reservations.  I knew that the place was small and very intimate.  But this is exactly what I had been looking for.  I've been looking for a small intimate French restaurant, with great food, to remind me of my last trip to Paris.  The menu is crafted by Marseille-born chef-owner Didier Pawlicki to reflect the best of South France and the freshest ingredients of the season.When we got to the restaurant, the place was full.  It has about 7-8 tables and you are literally touch your neighbor's shoulders.  I could tell el novio was a little antsy.  He is not a fan of tight spaces.  But then again who is? But the place has that warm, cozy, frenchesque type feel.  This is great, especially in our harsh cold NY winters.I didn't realize that the place was BYOB; with no cork fee...may I add. (Huge plus)  The waitress asked if we had a bottle, and when I responded no, she had this really sad look on her face.  El novio and I felt terrible; we didn't want to disappoint her.  But we were in luck, she mentioned there was a nearby winehouse that could deliver if we ordered via phone.  So, to thwart any more looks of disappointment on our French waitresses we immediately called for a bottle of cab.  In no time we got our wine.  Now for the best part.... The meal.  The menus were quirky; each dish has its own creative description, but none like I've ever seen before.   I felt it gave an honest touch. We both started off with French onion soup.  The only words that could describe the experience of eating the French onion soup is c'est magnifique.  The soup was covered in crusted layer of cheese, almost too too good to even eat.  But we ate it nonetheless.  I honestly was full off of the soup, but then came the mussels (also AMAZING)...and then el novio's steak and my duck.  They weren't as life changing as the soup, but still delicious.  Then for dessert we chose the Big Profiteroles au ""Bittersweet"" Chocolate. Overall, we both enjoyed the warm atmosphere and the great food.  However, be prepared, it's CASH only....",5,4,4,Luarnie B.,"San Francisco, CA",755,143,46
4.0,12/7/2010,"La Sirene is a tiny shrine to butter and meat. You can smell the evidence of such down the whole freaking sidewalk, so if money is an issue just go stand on Broome St. and take a couple deep sniffs. Then walk over to Lombardi's or something. I BYO'd the wine and my extremely attractive date paid the check. Along with every other nerd on here, we consumed one criminally delicious goat cheese tart, accompanied by a bowl of mussels (hers) and some kind of seafood shepherd's pie deal (mine). I had no complaints, but then I'm a real sucker for anything mashed together, layered, and served in a blazing-hot ceramic dish. I would rate both service and atmosphere as very good. It's a hole in the wall & complainers should just learn to embrace the occasional elbow in the rib, which you probably deserve anyway.",1,1,1,Mry Louise P.,"New Orleans, LA",11,9,0

When the restaurant called to confirm my reservation earlier, they reminded us that is was BYOB and Cash Only. We started off (after first having some great fresh bread) with the best escargot I've ever had and a baby octopus salad. For our main course, I had the fillet with fois gras and my husband had a lamb shank special. We skipped dessert to take an earlier train home, but hated to miss out on it.

But other than that, i am not quite sure what other negativity i can bestow upon this place. It was simply wonderful!!We had reservations for around 6pm on a Friday.. for some reason it was not very busy. Our hostess and waitress ( same lady) was a cute tiny french lady with an accent. She was super sweet and explained to us the special of the day & served us some good bread. I ordered the lamb with white wine sauce and my bf got the quail. It's BYOB, but our hostess gave us the phone number of a liquor store they associate with so we could get some wine.. free delivery! Our price range for wine was 30$, he delivered some nice resiling for 15 :) Our food.... wooowww! I am not sure what to say. The lamb and quail were cooked to perfection. Our meal was accompanied by complimentary vegetable plate with pureed veggies like carrots, cauliflower, squash-- the veg plate was bottomless! My bf loves veggies, so the pureed veggies were so unique and such a delight!  The portions were just enough.For dinner we got the profiteroles which were heavenly & well worth the money.

2.0,11/21/2010,"Great appetizer and dessert. Horrible entrees...La Sirene's been on my restaurant list for 2 years now. Finally went there last Friday evening. We had a reservation and were seated promptly, though it was quite difficult to actually get to my seat in this small and overly cramped space. Anyway, the restaurant smelled great, and with all the raves, I was expecting mouth orgasm, but walked away disappointed.For appetizer we had the goat cheese tart. The tart was delicious. The chopped mango on the side however was pretty bad. Now of course that's not the chef's fault because it is not mango season right now. However, I'd expect a place like this to know that and not serve out of season fruits. It just seemed unprofessional and careless. For entree we ordered Pan Seared Skate fish and Rosted Lamb Leg. Both were very unappetizing. The fish was overly oily, and the lamb was very tough and chewy. The texture was also very inconsistent, the center was very pink and barely warm, but the outside was very charred. It didn't have enough lamb flavor either. I like lamb for its unique gaminess, but this I could have easily confused with veal or steak. The toppings that came with the fish and the sauce that was on the lamb were both tasty and complex. But the actual fish and lamb were both unacceptable. The side veggie plate was forgetful. The two purees were somewhat decent, but the other two were very bland with unrefined cuts. Finally for dessert, we shared Meringue, with Caramel and Vanilla Custard. It had an unique texture, great combination of subtle flavors. It was probably the best part of dinner. Unfortunately it wasn't enough to be the saving grace. The ambiance was fine, I'm wasn't fond of the tightness of all the tables. And the service, while extremely friendly and prompt, seems a little contrived...The the end, the bill was $84, $100 including tip, for two people, who brought their own wine, had 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert. Definitely was not worth the price.",6,1,2,QianQian Z.,"New York, NY",4,23,0
1.0,11/16/2010,"A couple of weekends ago me & the date was able to snag a last minute reservations at around 9pm. The table was ready when we arrived & the waitress took our bottle of wine to be chilled. I'm going to get straight to the point here...Escargot ($13) half dozen, arrives in shell & drenched in butter that tastes like the same kind they put in movie theater popcorn. With every bite I felt more of my arteries getting clogged. It's great that it comes in shell, great presentation but how about backing it up with taste?Moules Rochelaises ($15) steamed mussels in curry & diced apples. Though the curry had light cream in it, it was overly liquidy and difficult to soak the complimentary stale bread with. The mussels were teeny & a tad over cooked along with the onions.Tournedos Rossini ($33) the filet mignon comes with foie gras & toast in layers. I ordered it rare which luckily they got it right, not cold in the middle but raw. I did not particularly enjoy the sauce it came swimming in but overly I would say this was the best dish of the night. If I was solely putting a review just on the Tournedos Rossini it would be 2 1/2 stars. All entrees also come with a little platter of vegetable puree which isn't anything to praise about.Not only was the food disappointing, so was the staff. When we first sat down they took the wine away, returned with a cooler & poured for us. As she left to get us menus I requested 2 glasses of water which she responded with a matter-of-fact attitude. This continued throughout the night.One last thing that I was not happy with, I was going to actually celebrate my birthday here but noticed their policy about no parties over 5 on the weekend plastered all over the website. However, in the time I dined here there were actually groups of 6 one after another. Yeah, this place does not have a cork fee but still.

The kitchen is ridiculously tiny and they deserve an award for bringing out such a variety of delectable meals through there. I'm saying this as a good thing...these people are amazing.I went with a girlfriend and we decided to share two appetizers and an entrée. 1. Goat Cheese Tart with Shallots ,Truffles, Grape and a Veil of 90 days Aged Swiss Cheese - really, how can you go wrong with ordering this? It's the perfect amount of creamy paired with a flaky amazing crust. 2. Oven Roasted Fresh Beet Salad, Pistachio, Diced Apple and Brie Cheese - refreshing and delicious. A great accompaniment to the richness of the tart. 3. Entrée - The special for the evening was an incredible Branzino prepared how all good Branzino should be prepared...with butter.

2.0,10/6/2010,"I went to this restaurant based on the overwhelmingly great reviews on Yelp.  How could I not try it?  Maybe I ordered poorly, and I did go on  Monday night, but I was not impressed with the food given what we were paying.  The bread was chewy... definitely a day old baguette. The beet salad was also prefabbed the day before, as it came out and everything on the plate was the same cold temperature, from beets to salad to salad dressing. the beets were entirely limp, either overcooked and refrigerated, or simply canned and refrigerated?  I had the signature duck breast dish which was okay, definitely overcooked for medium rare, but okay nonetheless.  presentation was lackluster.  The side including a pinch of chopped tomatoes sitting forlornly at the edge of the plate, and a sweet potato side that tasted good (it was sweet potato after all), but was also prefabbed, as it was a square carved out of some larger casserole, and placed oddly at another edge of the plate.  the same held true with the meringue for dessert, a square carved out from a larger pan.  I simply had never seen a meringue that was not individualized.  the caramelized sugar on top was also burnt.  this place seems to compensate for its small kitchen by premaking most of their meals in industrialized portions, then repackaging them for individual consumers.  does noone else notice this?the service, although other people seem to love it, consisted of one woman who was very involved with the computer, and could not find time for customers.  at one point, she told me she would be right with me, then sat at the computer for 10 minutes.  this place is small, and there is no way she could have possibly forgotten... i was about two feet away.  i also have to say i thought the menu was tacky... at one point it declared that an entree was greasy, in all caps, as though preemptive declarations are somehow a solution to poor quality entrees.  why not also say that the duck is going to be overcooked in all caps as well?  at least i would have been prepared.In the end, I am not from the area, and feel like these stellar reviews must come from people who are prolific on yelp, dont mind overpaying for everything, and perhaps dont get outside of the lousy service typical of other lower manhattan establishments.  other restaurants definitely offer better service and better food at that price.",2,0,0,lars d.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0

Came here too late in the night to try the prix fixe, but that's alright, since we wanted to try things that weren't on the prix fixe menu anyway!My appetizer was the goat cheese tart and my friend had the pate. My goodness, the goat cheese tart was heaven! It was so creamy and smooth and just bursting with flavor. I do have to warn you though that it is a bit rich, so those who are less tolerant of heavy/creamy dishes might have a little trouble finishing it. I personally have no such weakness and enjoyed every morsel of it =). As for the pate (which I am not particularly fond of in general), my friend found it a little too solid and meaty, rather than the softer more paste-like consistency that she prefers. The goat cheese tart was the clear winner!We decided to share an entree since we were both getting full at this point and still wanted to save room for dessert! We had the duck breast (which came with a side of mashed vegetables which were a nice complement). It was very good, tender and flavorful. I did find something a little lacking in the sauce though. I think it was just a tad too sweet and could have been balanced with some more savory undertones, but overall it was well-done! For dessert, we had the profiteroles.

Yum.  My main was their main : The filet mignon sandwiched between fois gras and hard toast that was swimming (in a good way) in a rich, brown sauce (don't ask me).  Perfecto.  My wife started with the romaine salad (it's actually listed as the mesclun salad - but the waitress waved it off saying they ran out of mesclun - more on the service later) which was about average.  Her main was much better - the Veal Chop special in a wine and cream garlic confit - delish.  We brought our own wine - Qupe - a Syrah that went splendidly with all of our courses.  We finished with their Meringue dessert with caramel and almonds which was different and good, but could've used more almond slivers. Finally, the service was great - other than the romaine moment - the 2 waitresses : Sam and Yulia were attentive, friendly and genuine. But I should warn you, the place is small. The tables are well-spaced but it could get loud.  So if you're not into cacophony, call ahead and see what size crowd they're expecting.  We went on a Tuesday night - 7PM, and it was perfect.   All in all a lovely evening",0,0,0,Hunter M.,"New York, NY",12,34,3
3.0,9/28/2010,"I was in Paris on Sunday night and, 24 hours later, on Monday night I ate here. So, read my review and then either call me jaded or accept that my review oozes with a good dose of reality.First, the BYOB part was what drew us in. Just back from Paris and wanting to share a nice old bottle with a friend who house/cat sat for me while I was gone. La Sirene had great reviews...and it seemed as though I could extend my Paris-vacation-glow a trip a bit longer by having dinner here.BYOB? Yes. They have it. Stemware is actually stemware (not little water glasses that some restaurants are fond of). Tiny seats. Our table was barely large enough to hold our glassware, bread basket, and pate. Lots of little tables along the right wall which is comprised of a padded bench that is not all that comfortable (there's a huge gap between it and the wall which creates an easy way to lose your purse onto the floor, which is exactly what happened to me).OK, the food.Bread. Nice chewey crust. Pate? Horrible texture and it actually needed salt, which was odd. More like a spiced hamburger than pate. I think it's safer to serve a terrine ""IN"" a tiny terrine than to scoop it out, slice it up, and serve it as they did. Also,  ""I"" make better terrine or pate than this on a bad day. They served it with with cornichons (yay), tiny romaine salad, mini pickled onions (sour), and a tiny bit of red pepper relish. Outside of the cornichons, the sides were really odd. Mustard would have been nice, or some thinly sliced onion, or confiture (!), but so would have been a proper pate/terrine. I had the hanger steak with a garlic/parsley sauce. It was really quite bland. Overcooked, too, as I'd ordered it medium and it came out close to well done). The cut of meat didn't look much like hanger steak. It also came out pre-sliced, which was a bit odd for a hanger steak (which is typically sort of flat-ish). This looked like something else to me. Strange little square of yams for a side veggie. More of that odd red pepper relish that we saw with the pate. My friend had a pork tenderloin in a very odd looking pink sauce (pink + pork is always disconcerting!).  Also presliced, but I expect this with pork tenderloin. It didn't have any amazing flavor either. He also had a square of the yams on his plate. For vegetables they served 4 veggies on a platter: pureed carrots, pureed cauliflower, grilled pineapple (so spicy it clashed with everything else it was served with, WTF?), and a strange vegetable (sliced) that was really watery, flavorless, and quite icky. I ate one bite of that and we called it a day. The veggies are ""all you can eat"". My friend liked the cauliflower, but I wasn't hugely impressed.The service was great though - our waitress was on point the entire evening and didn't miss a beat. It's too bad that the food isn't on the same level as her attentiveness. We didn't stay for dessert. Dinner was about $69 plus tip for an appetizer and two dishes. The BYOB part was nice, but sadly the food won't draw me back for a second visit even with the BYOB part. Lastly, it's cash only here. No credit cards at all.

2.0,9/27/2010,"I love the BYOB part; wish more restaurants would do that. But then, how would they make money without the 200% markup?! La Sirene knows. By charging extra for the food, that's how. Well, I am glad they didn't take the opportunity to stiff the customer on both the food AND the booze...Anyway, the food. I got the duck liver appetizer. It was a soupy saute with unidentifiable cubed vegetables slopped on a bed of romaine lettuce. The menu described it as mesclun, but mesclun this wasn't. Maybe they ran out, who knows, but the presentation was absolutely atrocious. And apart from the soupy, watery juice that the stuff was swimming in, there wasn't much in the way of any sort of flavor. The liver itself was fine, but then it's liver, it's hard to mess up. The walnuts promised on the menu were not there. The worst part was that this mess cost $14.My Kassoulet Toulousain was okay, but again really uninteresting.

5.0,9/20/2010,"After living in Philly for 4 years, I've been getting used to stocking up on wine and grabbing a bottle or three to take to any of many cozy, dim byos that serve delicious pastas and meats. New York is just not the same, where most restaurants tragically have liquor licenses. That said, I had been pretty excited about trying La Sirene for a while, as reservations are pretty hard to come by. After seeing the place, I now understand why. The entire establishment is about the size of my living room and the bathroom lends proper meaning to the term water closet. My boyfriend and I ordered the seared filet mignon with foie gras in a shallot, red wine and truffle sauce and the seared duck breast with cherry, port and red wine sauce. Yes, the plates taste just as good as they sound and no, I don't know how many years I just knocked off my life. To wash away the guilt, we helped ourselves to bottomless side orders of pureed cauliflower and carrot, roasted pumpkin and sauteed squash. While the entrees are extremely pricey, ($33.50 for the steak and $31.50 for the duck), they were well-worth the value. And to think of all the money we saved buying cheap champagne, this place really deserves 5 stars!EDIT: Plus the fact that Didier responds to almost all yelp reviews is awesome. :)",0,0,0,Nancy Y.,"San Francisco, CA",234,130,7

5.0,9/5/2010,"Yelp delivered once again, and then some.  Impromptu dinner plans with a friend:  she would drive in from Jersey City, I was to pick the place.  Eek!  So many options, what to do?As we had only a few hours notice I knew better than to waste time calling JG restaurants for a reservation.  It was, after all, the first Friday in September and NYC'ers were back in the city after a summer away.  Getting a table might be tough, and I didn't have a moment to lose.  Time to put yelp to the test.A little bit of browsing and I got the idea for a BYOB dinner.  Having recently returned from CA with lots of wine in tow, what better opportunity to enjoy it AND avoid cooking?  (I'm a genius, I know).  From there it didn't take long to find La Sirene:  the 300+ reviews and notably high average 4.5 star rating made the choice an easy one.Its a nondescript little shop front just east of Varick Street in West Soho, the less-heavily walked and slightly seedier cousin of the fashion mecca next door.  Certainly easy to miss, look for the red awning and park bench out front, as well as hungry-looking folks holding bottles of Bordeaux.And then you enter.  Ahhh...as soon as you step inside La Sirene you are transported to Paris.  Small, crowded, brightly-colored walls with mirrors and mosaics and other eclectic pieces.  Lots of yummy smells wafting from the exposed kitchen in the back, where a cook (is there really only one guy back there??) is busy preparing rich dishes of deliciousness.  Welcoming, friendly Francaise staff...once again confirming that no, you are not in Soho anymore.  Everyone is happy, smiling, relaxed.  How's that for ambiance?While they may not have a wine list, they are more than happy to help you imbibe.  The waitress offered to open our wine, chilled the white wine at the table, and kept our glasses full throughout.  And, lest ye show up sans bottle, the menu lists the name and number of a wine shop nearby that doesn't charge a delivery fee.  Obviously they have a deal worked out, most certainly to the benefit of their patrons.The menu was traditional french fare:  french onion soup, salades, mussels, duck confit, steak frites, etc.  I opted for the steak tartar which was lovely.    The bread provided to the table was perfect:  crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Just like a french baguette should be.We lingered long after eating, catching up and drinking our wine for over two hours.  It was a fabulous meal, one to be remembered, and neither we nor our waitress was in a hurry to bring it to an end.  The evening had the feel of a well-kept secret, but judging by the number of reviews I think the cat's out of the bag.  Thank you, fellow NYC Yelpers.  Once again you proved why Yelp is so great:  what a fabulous little spot I'd never find reading the Times (no offense, NYT).  I heart Yelp...and BYOB french bistros.",4,1,3,CB M.,"New York, NY",122,146,41

For appetizers, we got the escargot - nothing too special but the sauce it came with is good for dipping bread.  But the goat cheese tartlette was soo savory and combined with the salad on the side, it was perfection.  It was a wee bit too salty but my friend thought it was just right.For entreesthe hangar steak - cooked just right and I think they put a lot of parsley on top but it tasted really good.The duck - i LOVED this dish.  It was a good portion and the sauce is ridiculously good. I wish I was eating it right now for lunch!

5.0,8/22/2010,"At first glance, there's nothing striking about the facade of La Sirene. The building looks pretty plain and the interior is very cozy with about a dozen tables. But it's one of the best dining experiences you can have in NYC. The staff is French and delivers good service. Everyone in the restaurant seems to be happy, enjoying their parties' company and the amazing food that this place serves up. It's BYOB and most people appear to bring it (which probably also enhances the experience!). You're not rushed through you're meal and the environment is so warm and relaxing that you won't want to leave.For appetizers, the goat cheese tart is one of their signature dishes and is absolutely amazing, bursting with really great flavor. Also, if you like escargot, the dish is marinated perfectly with butter and garlic and the remaining ""sauce"" is great for dipping bread. For the main course, you can't go wrong with the filet mignon with foie gras. It's definitely not the healthiest thing in the world but the taste is amazing and the meat just melts in your mouth. You've got to try it to really understand how good it is! Also, the duck breast with the cherry-port sauce is a really great dish. The flavors combine so well and the meat is cooked perfectly with no bones to worry about. Duck is one of those things that can be really bad when screwed up, but this restaurant really knows how to prepare the duck! Finally, I don't think there are any bad choices for dessert. I really like the profiteroles though and it's a great dish for sharing because it's huge! And the rum cake is really good, too!Everyone I went with leave feeling completely full but happy.

5.0,8/18/2010,"I can't help but share my experience with others about how fantastic this cozy little restaurant is.  Introducing my friends to this place has definitely struck up a bonding between us like never before.  When food is this delicious, it makes everyone happy, comfortable and get a little closer.  Before the first time I dined here, I had read about how wonderful the food is through Yelp.  It was a little difficult to convince my friends to dine here with me because the menu looks so traditional in a city of wonky and trendy food that people tend to go after.  After having been here a few times, it just goes to show that while it's fun 'n all to try scientific gastronomy or trendy food, you will always go back to a place that feels like home where your tummy is happy.I haven't tried everything yet, but so far, I have not tried anything that isn't superb.   My favorites:  Escargots in garlic and butter sauce, I imagine myself eating this in the presence of no one and licking the artist palette plate clean of all it's butter and garlic sauce.  Moules marinieres,  the mussels are cooked perfectly.  Every time I pick one up, I fill the side of the shell with the mussel in it with sauce and drink the whole thing up.   When there are no more mussels left, the sauce makes your eyes do this (@) (@) when you think about how excellent it would be soaked up in bread.  Goat cheese tartelette, sea shephard's pie, the French cassoulet and the one thing I can't leave here without - the seared hanger steak.  In fact, I don't think anyone should leave this earth without trying these dishes.",4,1,3,J M.,"New York, NY",56,65,167

However, let me start off by saying that the entrees are definitely overpriced compared to similar restaurants in the EV, e.g., 26 Seats, Lucien, etc.. That said, it evens out when you factor in the BYOB. My fiance and I started off with the escargot and the goat cheese tart. The escargot is served in the shell, which I've found to be rare in NYC. It was awesome! I think it was the best escargot I've had in this city. The goat cheese tart was also very, very good. I'm not biggest goat cheese fan, but my fiance was in heaven. For entrees, I had the duck breast in a cherry, port and wine sauce. This was awesome. It's not the best I've ever had, but it sure was up there. (The best I've had is at 26 seats in their raspberry reduction sauce). My fiance had the filet mignon with foie gras. He absolutely loved it. I thought it was delicious too, but I liked mine better.

5.0,8/15/2010,"We went here for our first year anniversary together. The first and only time I've had French food was 13 years ago, while I was in France. This was the first time outside of a croissant or two that I was eating French food in NYC.We ordered the roasted beet salad and soft shell crab as appetizers. I enjoyed the beet salad but thought that the crab tasted more Italian than anything else. I ordered the roasted lamb and my boyfriend ordered the veal. I enjoyed the lamb and the succulent sauce. There was potato au gratin and sides of pureed carrot, cauliflower. There was also a green squash, which I thought was tasty. My boyfriend didn't enjoy his veal very much.Normally, if one of us doesn't enjoy a meal, it automatically means one less star. Well, the service made up for it. The maitre'd thanked him for being honest and truthful and replaced his meal with filet mignon, which was very delicious. She was very attentive and we both appreciated the great service.I ordered a rum infused cake and my boyfriend ordered a custard with caramelized sugar on top. Both were good, but we both agreed that the rum cake was scrumptious!It's BYOB, but the waitress was courteous and chilled our white wine and poured it for us. It's a quaint little place, but actually reminded me of a restaurant I had been to in Paris several years ago.

An appetizer, entree and shared dessert was not enough, because the entrees were small, except for the baked sea shepherd pie. The fish came with just a dollop of rice, and the accompanying ""Tray Of 4 Vegetables"" was for the entire table. A great evening otherwise. Consider your needs before going. Update: Chef Didier nicely responded to my review and suggested I request more veggies. It's a nice thought, but the veggie tray is small, and I would have needed about ten refills to get full.

Literally, they must have shaved 3 small cukes, tossed them around a vat of mayo, dumped it on a plate, cut up 1 olive to put on the edge and served it to me. It was gross. We tried it on a piece of bread and it was still gross. The mussels are what called us to give it a try and it was not spectacular as the reviews made it out to be. I've had better at Landmarc.The place packed so many tables so close together that there were many spills, breakages, and accidents. A lady knocked her champagne flute to the ground while reaching for some food and a man at a different table spilled his water- both times breaking the glassware.I've never seen this at a restaurant before. Both times there were no other customers nearby so it can't be blamed on being pushed or whatnot.

The bathroom, too, is practically in the kitchen, and the sink actually IS in the kitchen & dining room. It's charming. The staff was lovely, too; the waitress made us promise to come visit her again. We had the two-top in the front window, and it felt easily like Paris. Sirene has--hands down--the best mussels I've had anywhere, including Belgium, France, and other NY joints. We finished two orders of bread just sopping up the mariniere sauce-- I've been dreaming about those mussels ever since. We had two entrees: the duck and the ""signature"" skate fish. The skate was delicately cooked with a nice butter-based sauce--it was flakey and sweet and light--but the duck was incredible. Tender duck breast with a crazy-rich cherry & port sauce that felt so indulgent and tasted incredible.

5.0,8/3/2010,"There are bistros and then there are bistros. Let me tell you, there are tons of great restaurants in NYC but this, hands down, must be one of the greatest I have had the pleasure to enjoy.La Sirène is small, and very stringent with its reservation policy. I had dinner at 6pm, right before the crowds, and it definitely was about to fill up by the time we left. You really do need to make a reservation.I went here on a date, and my girlfriend being a devout foodie like myself wanted to split an appetizer. On second thought, I'm glad I didn't. Why? The food is EXTENSIVE. I ordered the Kassoulet, a sort of bean, bacon, sausage, and duck leg casserole in some sort of greasy sauce. I could have ordered a Shephard's pie or any other dish. But the description of the dish being designed for warriors kind of made my decision easy ;)It was pretty darn greasy. But you know what? IT WORKED. The beans tasted of delicious bacon, the sausage was cooked to perfection, the sides had just the right amount of flavor. Such a... ""brute"" dish was prepared so elegantly. My girlfriend enjoyed the veal with an apple and caramelized onion sauce and it too was prepared delicately with just the right amount of flavor. As a slight comment to the Chef I think the presentation would benefit from more but smaller ""veal rolls"" so it doesn't dismember itself when you're trying to make it into a bite sized piece. But that was all wonderful. Sad thing is, the meal seemed like rubbish compared to the dessert we had. And mind you, I thought the meal was absolutely fantastic. You see, the profiteroles at La Sirène are worth a flight to NYC. On the menu they claim that the sauce was changed a while back due to customer complaint. I'm guessing people preferred a very sweet chocolate. But no... the sauce was nice bittersweet chocolate that literally left us moaning. Together the bill came to around $77 (for both of us) which is actually not bad at all considering the incredible quality of the meal.

3.0,7/13/2010,"Summary:  They do their signature dishes Really Well, and everything else, Eh. By Really Well, I mean our entrees were DELICIOUS.I had the ""Roasted Lamb Leg, Sliced With White Wine Crème de Garlic Confit"" with the lamb cooked medium to well, and my mother had the ""Aile de Raie Charlotte"" (Pan Seared Skate fish With Mango, Caper Non Pareilles, Lime). (Yes I just copy-pasted from their website).The capers-and-mango-salsa-type of dressing on her fish was AMAZING. A little bit of tang with the mango and lime, balanced out by the full aromatic flavor of the capers and whatever else was in that sauce. It was very much a spring/summer dish. My lamb was perfectly seared, and juicy, and I couldn't get enough of the flavor. I can't even begin to describe it. Each entree came with a slice of potato au gratin, which was pretty good, and each table came with a side of veggies.As for the veggies: 2 out of 4 veggie items are mashed up like babyfood (the babyfood version of cauliflower, and the babyfood version of ..carrots I think?)...Not so great. The 3rd item was actually grilled pineapple, which was tasty enough, and the last item was sliced cucumber and tomatoes. This last one was, obviously, the tastiest (although compared with cauliflower-as-babyfood I'm not sure that's saying much).We also ordered their special dessert, which was sabayon (zablaiogne). It is essentially a very very light whipped custard that is made with some wine and traditionally served with figs, although at La Sirene it was served with an assortment of fruits (figs, mango, pear, etc). Neither of us were crazy about it. It was too watery, the fruit pieces were just sort of mixed in and didn't go well with the strong flavor of the wine. Kind of disappointing since it was the ""special"" on the dessert menu that day.All in all, our bill came out to a little over $80 including tip. Though the dessert fell flat, and the veggie side was a little strange, my mouth still waters when I think about that seared lamb leg and the capers/mango sauce on that fish. I'm giving 3-stars because it wasn't the whole package, but I wish I could give 3.5 because the entrees really were amazing.

2.0,7/11/2010,"I really wanted to like La Sirene.Maybe it was because we chose the prix fixe meal, but I was really unimpressed by the food. Appetizers were the French onion soup (just OK) and a green salad vinaigrette, which was huge, bland, and underdressed -- and I don't even like salad dressing. We each ordered the same entree, the seafood version of shepherd's pie, because none of the others sounded appealing.  There was fish in there somewhere, I guess, along with a few carrots stranded in the pureed potatoes, and a topping of melted cheese that was burnt black around the edges. Dessert was raspberry sorbet and vanilla ice cream (the only choices on the prix fixe are sorbet or ice cream). The sorbet was fine, but the vanilla ice cream lacked vanilla flavor and the texture was icy and hard, not creamy at all.The service was very friendly and good, both on the phone and in the restaurant. The ambience is nondescript  (it's a tiny restaurant, but they could do a lot more with the decor). It's too bad that the quality of the food doesn't measure up to the fine service, which is lacking in so many other NYC restaurants. Sad to say, won't be going back.EDIT AFTER SEEING RESTAURANT'S RESPONSE: I have never asked for my money back at a restaurant. I couldn't imagine doing that.

The stew was incredibly oversalted to the point where I didn't even want to eat it past the 3rd or 4th bite. The goat cheese/truffle tart was good, but totally overpriced (about $17). I also didn't find the service that friendly.

5.0,7/5/2010,"Wow.  The food in this restaurant is incredible.  A friend was visiting NY for work and we had been picking restaurants for her to try.  French food is something that she doesn't get much of where she's from, and we actually turned to Yelp to help us find a French restaurant.  Well, friends and fans, the ratings this establishment received from Yelp do not lie.  We're talking 288 reviews (at the time of this posting) and 4.5 stars.  That's one of the best ratings I've seen and La Sirene deserves every bit of praise that's been heaped upon it.This place is very nondescript from the outside and you will very much miss it unless you were looking for it.  It was a weekday and we had made a reservation just in case.  Good thing, too, because it was full despite the fact that it was 7pm on a Wednesday.  One thing you will need to know is that this establishment is BYOB, so my friend and I picked up a bottle of red on the way.  Walking into the restaurant, you would notice that every table of patrons did indeed bring their own wine.  We were sat quickly at a table and the waitress immediately opened our wine for us and poured each of us a glass.  While browsing through their menu, our nostrils could not help but be pleasantly accosted by the wonderful aroma that was coming from the kitchen because the space is very small and we sat close to the kitchen.  It took me about a minute of glancing at the appetiser menu to decide that I wanted to have the escargots.  I love it and it had been much too long since I've had it.  It took me a while longer to decide on the main course, however.  I'm always in the mood for steak, but it seemed kind of boring.  I almost decided on the Onglet Poêlé à la Facon Luchonaise, which is a hangar steak, but in the end I went with a much more complicated-sounding dish that I've never had before, the Kassulet Toulousain.  In the words of the menu, it is a French Cassoulet Toulouse's Style, with cannellini beans, tomato, garlic duck confit, slab bacon and pork sausage all braised with noble duck fat.  The menu also added that the dish was ""created for warriors to defend the city"".  Since I am obviously a warrior that often defends the city, this dish was a fitting choice.The escargots were every bit the garlicky-goodness that you could expect.  Tender and greasy, it would be difficult for me to pick another appetiser when I go back to La Sirene again.  The Kassulet Toulousain was a monster of a casserole with all the ingredients listed above being mixed inside.  One bite and you could tell that this was comfort food for warriors.  All the ingredients tasted great, and more importantly, tasted great together.  You gotta give it to the French, they do duck right.  I finished the entire dish despite the relatively big portion.  The waitress was impressed by that and called me a warrior.For dessert, I ordered the Iles Flotantes, and vanilla custard with meringue, caramel and almonds.  This, too, was superb.  It's so easy to mess up a custard by making the top either too crusty or not crusty enough, but they had it just right.Five stars.  I will be going back again, and again, and again.  And it's an excellent restaurant for a date.",4,2,6,Radford T.,"Queens, NY",612,452,159
4.0,7/3/2010,I love the profiteroles!!!!  The fat kid inside of me ate two of the three.  Loved!Great little neighborhood find.  The dining area is tiny but to me it makes it charming and so adorable.  We brought our own bottle of wine because it's byob.  We really had no idea what to expect from this little place.  Our server was perfect she coached us through the menu and we of course horrendously over ordered.I remember two things that we ate and both were stars.  Before I tell you what they were we had loads of food before hand a salad and mussels and other menu items and they were are really good.  I simply can't remember them because the Tournedos Rossini and the Profiterols were the last two things we had before calling it a night and the were fantasmo!!!  Only tiny downside was the noise.  On a Friday night the place was jammed and it's a small dinning room able to seat 25.  So I can't give them a hard time but let's just say it was full of those girls who talk really loud and have those horrible voices and think that the louder they talk the better chance they have of the male species noticing them.  Simple fix - put up some tapestries on the wall it will for sure quiet those broads down.If I wasn't so worried about it being bikini season I would eat here weekly!!  Don't fret La Sirene when winter comes (and I can easily hide the big ass I will surely get from eating the profiteroles)  I promise it's on like donkey kong.La Sirene until the cold weather comes I will miss you but promise to think of you often.  Until the cold weather arrives take care and please whatever you do don't get rid of the profiteroles.,0,1,0,Elizabeth R.,"New York, NY",68,16,5
5.0,7/2/2010,"Let me preface this review by saying that like the (true) New Yorker that I am, I have never written a public review of a restaurant before. I prefer to keep the good restaurants to myself as secret little gems in order to avoid the  incessant overcrowding/tourist attraction that has come to ruin so many great nyc establishments. HOWEVER, I LITERALLY (and I mean literally) created a Yelp account just to speak about La Sirene because it really is the most unbelievable restaurant in nyc. The food is mind blowing and you will come to agree.The place is great- very cute (as previously stated only seats 25) so very small and intimate and one of the reasons (I believe) that the quality of the food is so impeccable. This place isn't your ""mass producing"" theatre-district restaurant. This is only for those who know damn good French cuisine.We started with the mussels in mustard sauce and all I can say is AMAZING. The only thing that I could say while eating these was ""omg, omg, omg."" Words cannot even describe how damn good these mussels are.. the broth is incredible. I wanted to drink it after I was done. Goat cheese came next (also unbelievable beyond words). Creamy and warm with some mango to add a subtle sweet flavor. AND the french onion soup.. soooo good. The filet mignon here is the standout star. Hanger steak also unbelievable. And for dessert the profiterolles- a MUST. LOVE LOVE LOVE the menu and its awesome unapologetic  side notes (ie: for the profiterolles it is noted that this is not ""Hershey's"" and that if you don't like it, don't try it!! I feel like a review just doesn't do this place justice. You need to just go and try the food. It is BYOB and cash only, so be aware of that before you go. But the service is outstanding (waitstaff unbelievably friendly and definitely aiming to please) and the atmosphere quaint and romantic.

5.0,6/19/2010,"Everything positive that has been said about this place is true.I've been meaning to try La Sirene since earlier this year when the crazy good reviews on Yelp initally caught my eye.  I finally got to try it tonight with my boyfriend, and wow!At first, we weren't completely sure how La Sirene would meet our (read: my) expectations.  There was a big birthday party seated right next to us, so the ambience was pretty loud for such a tiny place.  That wasn't such a big deal since it's kinda the luck of the draw, but then our server broke the cork on our fine bottle of wine.  She was super apologetic but our first glass had bits of cork floating in it and we had to fish them out and it still tasted funny.  Not the smoothest start to our dinner!But all doubts were forgotten when our goat cheese tart arrived.  The goat cheese tart alone is rich without being cloying, but what really balanced it out was the cold salad on the side.  That is what elevated the dish from being very good to excellent.Following Yelp reviewers' suggestions, I ordered the hanger steak and my boyfriend got the filet mignon with foie gras.  OMG.  The hanger steak doesn't sound so impressive because it is so simple, but it really is SO GOOD.  No regrets at all.  Every perfectly cooked piece of steak exploded with wonderful garlicky flavor in my mouth.  I also loved that it was already cut into pieces.  I love just being able to spear my food without having to cut it!My boyfriend's filet mignon - okay, let me just put it this way: the look he had upon his first bite, I have NEVER seen it before, it was that orgasmic.  He seemed more annoyed than I was with the whole cork incident but I'm pretty sure that filet mignon wiped his memory of it.  I don't think he was even able to speak any comprehensible language with his first few bites.  It was that good.We finished this incredible meal with the legendary profiteroles.  I almost LOL'd when I saw it on the menu because it echoed Frank Bruni's NYT review (""it's not Hershey's!"").  Mr. P, thank goodness it's not Hershey's!  What a wonderful balance of the bittersweet chocolate with the vanilla ice cream!The icing on the cake?  NO CORKAGE FEE.  When we got the bill, it was a very reasonable $98 pre-tip.We are already wondering when we will be back to try the mussels.  And now I am curious to try Taureau!",4,1,2,J L.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",7,79,6

5.0,4/13/2010,"La Sirène and its family are a rare find in this city. A place where you will be taken care of, treated as family and have a wonderful dining experience. What I really enjoy about La Sirène is the responsiveness of the Chef/Owner, Didier Pawlicki, to his customers. As a preliminary matter, the food is delicious. The ingredients are incredibly fresh, and Didier's recipes are clearly crafted with intuition, care and great taste. But what makes the experience is Didier's passion and his care for his guests. And his staff adopt the same approach to taking care of their customers. Upon entering, you feel like you're in a friend's dining room, over for a dinner party. Didier and the staff takes your mood and your tastes into account when he makes his recommendations from the evening's menu, and your trust of their judgment is rewarded by a meal which will leave you speechless.",1,0,2,David M.,"Houston, TX",11,6,0
2.0,4/9/2010,"Here's another Yelp user that wasn't blown away by La Sirene. We booked for 7pm on Monday night and stayed until 9pm and the restaurant was fairly quiet the whole time, with only 3 other tables occupied - one of which was the entire cast of Ugly Betty!!We ordered 1 starter, 2 main courses and 1 dessert.  The onion soup was absolutely amazing. Unfortunately that's where it ended. The main courses of beef and lamb were mediocre. They were lacking a little in taste. The dessert was nice but not wow. We were also over charged for a dessert we didn't have. Due to the dim lighting we didn't spot this until we got on the metro home!The bill came to $116 inc tax & tip & the over charging. Given that does not include any drinks, it's pretty high for 2 courses per person & no drink. If we had paid $60 then I'd go again but  right now the food quality doesn't match the hefty price tag.",0,0,0,Him P.,"Welwyn Hatfield, United Kingdom",0,7,0
1.0,4/8/2010,"Wow -- I don't understand why this place has such high ratings.  I was suckered into coming here because of the almost 5-star ratings.  Once I arrived, I sat at a tiny table literally rubbing elbows with the person next to me.  We ordered the two most recommended dishes by yelpers - the Filet Migon with Foie Gras and Duck breast in a cherry sauce.  Just a fair warning, they are also the two most expensive items on the menu... We also got escargot for appetizers.   I am used to escargot that comes with a thick sauce at the bottom, but these just had a thin layer of what looked like oil.  Not what I expected for $2/escargot.  As for the main entrees -- The flavors in the steak did not come together.  Personally I felt that the foie gras overpowered the dish. I liked the duck better, but it was a little too sweet.  As for the vegetable puree, I would have preferred whole vegetables or side dishes that have the texture of baby food.Overall, I rate restaurants on a scale of quality vs. price. Maybe I will come back here when I'm a millionaire and can afford as many $2 escargots as I please.",1,0,0,Kathy W.,"New York, NY",36,256,1
4.0,4/5/2010,"When you walk by this restaurant the smells of buttery, garlic goodness hypnotize you. The aroma was enough convincing for my friend to make a reservation and I hopped along for the ride. For appetizers, we tried the fish soup and the sautéed calamari with mixed greens, tomatoes and mushroom. The fish soup was different from ones I've had before - puréed into the broth. The taste was a little sour, not quite right. On the other hand, the calamari was quite tasty! Nice that it wasn't fried and I'm pretty sure the sauce was that buttery goodness we smelled outside. For my main course I had the pan-seared skate, which was delicious! It's a healthier choice but sometimes I think it's hard to season fish. They got this just right though. It was topped with a mango/caper salsa which was a great blend of complementary tastes. Other entrées at the table that I got to try were the rollatini style veal (stuffed w/ caramelized onion) and the roasted lamb leg. If you like meat and cream sauce this is the way to go! Of the two I prefer the veal - it's served over mushroom and apple which adds more flavor to the mix. A nice surprise was the plate of vegetables they gave us as a side - puréed cauliflower, whipped sweet potato, caramelized endive and baked pineapple. YUM! As far as ambiance goes it's a small, charming space. Maybe around 8 tables? Unfortunately, it didn't seem like they were really keeping track of people who had reservations versus walk-ins and we still had to wait a few despite having a reservation. But once we sat down the service was speedy and attentive. While the restaurant is like a neighborhood golden ticket, there isn't really a surrounding neighborhood to account for (right by the Holland Tunnel entrance). It's a dead area and you have to walk a little if you're planning on continuing the festivities after dinner. Other things to keep in mind - it's cash only so come prepared. It's BYOB - go to town!

5.0,4/1/2010,"Anticipating the BYOB, I stopped by the liquor store and picked up a French bottle of red wine that was recommended for the food I was about to enjoy. In the cab on the way to La Sirene I realize I left the bottle at work. Oh well, looks like I'll be having some more French food in the near future... Fortunately though City Winery was around the corner and while they are more restaurant-like, they do sell their own wine. No French, but California will have to do.Honestly, I had pre-picked the dishes I would be savoring this evening. Seeing as goat cheese and foie gras are two of my most favorite foods, I was settled on the goat cheese tart as an appetizer and the filet mignon w/ foie gras as my entrée. We decided to throw in some roasted escargot for good measure. This having been my second time eating escargot, I was equally pleased with them. The goat cheese tart however was amazing. So incredibly rich and soft, I had a tinge of childhood guilt as it felt like I was eating dessert before my dinner. And the filet mignon with foie gras was delectable. I went into this a little pessimistic as I prefer my foie gras seared versus in pate form. But this dish was excellent. The foi gras just melted in my mouth, the filet was perfectly cooked and the sauce that these items were swimming in was divine. The only challenge was trying to make sure that I had all of the dish's components on the fork when taking a bite. I opted out of trying their dessert, but perhaps next time I'll save the goat cheese tart for the end.La Sirene itself is quant and cozy. Tucked away on a quite part of Broome St and nestled next to Ivo & Lulu. What I noticed about the inside seemed a bit nautical themed and there couldn't have been more than a dozen or so tables. A relaxing ambience is encouraged with some softly lit candles, this is a great place to indulge in some big wines, good food and great company. One word of caution is that likely due to its size, it had a tendency of  getting a wee bit loud.",2,0,2,Mark S.,"San Francisco, CA",24,241,18
5.0,3/30/2010,"This was a fantastic meal at a reasonable price. I loved being able to BYOB (no corkage!), we brought two fav bottles of wine. We started with the escargots and curried mussels. I loved both equally, the bf prefered the land based shells (which greatly surprised me given he nornally is not an 'earthy' eater). They snails were cooked deliciously with lots of garlic and parsely in the butter. The mussels were seasoned perfectly and the broth was just wonderful. For me the highlight was the fillet with foie gras. The meat was perfectly cooked, the foie gras was a great counter-point and the sweetness in the sauce balanced it all out wonderfully. Desert was the protiferoles which we shared and both thought was the perfect end to a wonderful meal. La Sirene is my favorite type of restaurant. It's not Per Se or Daniel, but it has rustic, authentic French food prepared with passion and love. The atmosphere was cozy yet not overwhelming. The service was friendly.

4.0,3/16/2010,"This hidden gem is amazing. It's located in SoHo near the Holland Tunnel. Yeah, it kinda is in a sketchy neighborhood because  the teen center, ""The Door"" is right across the street. Caveat this place is freaking SMALL. I will like to say this place can seat like only 25 ppl at a time. I highly recommend making reservations here since it is small. The big plus here is that it is BYOB. There is no corkage fee if you bring in your own bottle of wine. Also, it's a cash only establishment, so leave your plastic at home. For apps,  I had the Escargots a la Bourguignone which is 1/2 dozen oysteres  roasted with butter and garlic sauce. OMG this is the 1st time i tried escargot, and wow i became a fan. It is not tough like cooked mussels/clams. It is soft and it really absorbs the flavor it is cooked in. The butter and garlic sauce was amazing. I scooped up the drippings of the sauce with the complimentary bread that they provided. We also had the Tartelette de Chevre Frais aux Echalottes, Truffes, Raisins, Confit et Voile de Vieux Gruyere, or Goat cheese tart with shallots, truffles, grapes, and a veil of 90 days aged swiss cheese. WOW this was GOOOOOOOOOD. The grape sauce was amazing. The goat cheese tart was cooked to perfect It had a nice toasty outer layer with a melting inner layer. The flavor profile of the cheese with the truffles, grapes and shallots worked perfectly. For entrees, we ordered the Magret de Canard Poele Sauce Montmorency, Seared duck breast with cherry, port, and red wine sauce. The sauce is a bit too sweet for my taste, but it did pair well with the duck that I ordered medium rare. The duck breast was cooked well altho it was med rare in the middle, and cooked well done on the outer slices. The cherries added a nice touch to add sweetness and tartness to the duck. She ordered the Tournedos Rossini, the seared Filet mignon over bread toasted with Foie Gras, shallots, port, and red wine truffle sauce. We ordered this medium rare, but i think they let it rest too long because it was more like medium. You really do have to eat the foie gras, filet and sauce all together to really enjoy this dish. It was AWESOME. The flavors of teh foie gras really balanced well with the filet mignon and the red wine truffle sauce. The entrees also came with a side dishes of 4 veggies: spaghetti squash, baby bokchoy, creamed carrots and creamed cauliflower. All were seasoned well and cooked to perfection.For dessert, we shared the Poire Belle Helene, which is a vanilla ice cream, fresh pear cooked in syrup, topped with bitter dark chocolate and whipped cream. The chocolate was topped with almonds while the whipped cream was topped with pistachios. The pear, with ice cream, and chocolate ,and whip cream worked well, but it was all deconstructed. I didn't like the fact that we had to put it all together. I also think they poured too much of the dark chocolate sauce. It was good but it was overpowering the rest of the dish. Overall this place is awesome. Not perfect, but it was close to perfection.",0,0,0,Thomas A.,"Watertown, MA",329,895,435
5.0,3/10/2010,"We dined here for our 10 year anniversary. I was looking for a quaint, ""affordable"" French bistro and La Sirene defintely fits the bill. My wife and both went Prix Fixe for $29 each. Wife loved the French onion soup and says it's sad that no other French onion soup will ever be this good. I had the pate which was simply complex. I had the curry Mussels and boy did the flavor pack a wallop. The wife loved her Seafood Shepherd's pie. Dessert was a refreshing sherbets. Like everyone else says, BYOB without a corkage fee, puts this place over the top! We strolled in with a small bottle of champagne that they put on ice, a bottle of cab, and a small bottle of port for dessert. Some reviewers don't like the strong aroma coming from the kitchen since it's a small place. I am a foodie and home cook and I loved the smell! You can smell the love they put into the food.

It's not a $300/person joint, but they make some of the best food I have ever tasted, EVER! The service is always friendly and unpretentious and the food is ALWAYS ALWAYS heavenly!Both the Moules Vignerones (Steamed Mussels in Red Wine Herbs Mush., Tomato, Onion, Garlic, Bacon) and the Moules Rochelaises (Steamed Mussels with Curry, Diced Apples and Light Cream) are sensational. The sauces have so much flavour!  We always scoop the sauces with the mussel shells and drink from that. Occasionally when no one is watching we gulp it down straight from the plate.My absolute favourite entree here is the Magret de Canard Poele Sauce Montmorency (Seared Duck Breast with Cherry, Port and Red Wine Sauce). I swear, if heaven had a taste, this is IT!  The duck is done to perfect tenderness and the marriage of the cherry, port, and red wine in the sauce creates a level of complexity that would leave your senses jumping and your taste buds yearning!A couple of close seconds are Tournedos Rossini (Seared Filet Mignon Over Bread Toasted With Foie Gras, Shallots, Port & Red Wine Truffles Sauce) and a Squab dish that I don't see on their menu anymore.  The filet mignon is a true luxury as well.

I believe there was another party taking our place after a couple hours so we left a little hastily and the only other downside is that for all the eagerness with which they took our coats to be helpful, we found that they had all been placed on the benches in the entryway which was weird.

5.0,2/15/2010,"Amazing experience. Absolutely delicious goat cheese tart with caramelized onions on the bottom that really deepen and highlighted the flavor of the goat cheese. It's the kind of dish you'll remember for a very long time. The Filet Mignon (the beef kind, not the French pork tenderloin kind) was amazing. On top of a crouton and topped with fois grais and then drenched in a sauce. All this combined into a melt in your mouth experience. Five star dish. The hanger steak and other cheese appetizer were very good, but not as good as the two dishes above. The carrot puree was the best vegetable that we tried, but the cauliflower and sweet potatoes were also good. I think the profiteroles are a bit overrated. But, it didn't help that I saw them bring up the frozen ones to reheat. The bitter chocolate sauce was delicious, but having been to Jacques Torres for lunch, we had hit our chocolate wall. The waitress was great and even understood my ""What's this"" question when my mouth was full and I could only motion the question. It ended up being sweet potato cake and was very tasty. Be forewarned, it's a small place so the kitchen aromas will be absorbed in your hair and clothes. If you're going out afterwards, bring something that you can spray on yourself!

3.0,2/14/2010,"Came here last night for dinner to celebrate an early Valentine's dinner and was not tremendously impressed... not sure if it was our high expectations based on the incredible reviews. We had been so excited for our reservation.I would have given the restaurant 3 1/2 stars if I could.Service: 5 stars - attentive and niceGoat cheese tart: 5 stars - delicious... this appetizer lived up to the hype.Mussels with curry sauce: 3 stars... I was so excited to try this and was somewhat disappointed. The sauce had a nice spicy kick but there seemed to be something missing.Pan seared skate: 3 stars... tasted good but would have been so much better if it had a crispy sear.Filet mignon with foie gras: 4 1/2 stars... the filet was very tender and the foie gras totally made the dish, melting in the mouth.Iles flotantes: 2 stars... it was heavier than I expected... the Iles flotantes at Chez Catherine in Westfield, NJ was my first ever experience and is so airy and delicious so this one, to me, did not compare.Poire Belle Helene: 1 star... complete disappointment. My first time in France at age 16, I tasted a Poire Belle Helene and thought I was in heaven. So coming here, I was so excited to taste this dessert. The ice cream ruined the dessert... it tasted almost grainy.The pureed carrots on the veggie tray was spectacular... I normally hate cooked carrots but this side was very good.The seating was very cramped. It feels like you are sitting at a communal table... there's no way to have a private conversation. They definitely need better ventilation. You leave smelling like food. It also got very hot and the guy next to us opened the door to let in some air. They turned on the air condition as a result.We were very sad that we didn't love this place... we so badly wanted to.

I recommend taking the mussels (in the traditional sauce) which are not only very tasty but a great value for money (the half size is probably enough as a main dish for one person not very hungry).BYOB without a cork fee makes the place one of my favorite restaurants in the city (they don't sell alcohol so don't forget to bring a bottle with you).",1,1,1,Ron D.,"New York, NY",37,6,0

It was farther away than both my friend and I imagined but it was generally packed so seems people are willing to walk the distance to eat here. We really liked the decoration and especially that you can BYOB! I brought a bottle of sparklies to share with my friend and their employees were very happy and quick to open the bottle for us.The waitress who took care of us was... well, in training. As soon as we sat down she asked us if we could finish our dinner as soon as possible, preferably by 7. We were a bit taken aback but just said we'd try our best. There was a bit of going back and forth regarding what's on the menu and what we can do besides the prix fixe dinner, which was why we went there. We ended up getting 1 prix fixe dinner (with the pate and mussels) and ordered separately an Endive salad and the duck confit casserole. It was solid french food. No complaints, though it didn't blow my mind away. The duck dish was so-so and the mussels were ok. Space is a bit cramped and it does get a bit loud too. Around 7:15, the head waitress came over and said ""let's make a deal. The are people waiting for this table so it would be great if you could finish early so they can have the table. But we want to be fair to you so we're going to offer you free dessert."" Now, the prix fixe only comes with sorbet or ice cream, and their dessert menu had some interesting items.

I just don't think that's gonna be possible!Outstanding, simply outstanding.I made reservations there for a special occasion on my boyfriend's word that it was the best French restaurant in the city. I was immediately surprised about how proud they seem to be by their no-corkage-fee-BYOB policy. Instead of just being an insider's tip or house secret, it's boldly announced on the website, the menu, and in the reservation confirmation message.We arrived early on a cold afternoon and were welcomed inside by the staff, even though they were still setting things up. Everyone at La Sirene, from the owner to the porter, are welcoming and friendly. I felt like we were dining at their home as opposed to a tiny French restaurant in TriBeCa-- that's a mark of truly great service.We started off with the French Onion Soup, the Goat Cheese Tart and the Curried Mussels (I forget the French name). All three were perfect and delicious. The mussels were so good my mom (formerly a bit food-shy) was inspired to taste one, and she declared it ""pretty good"" which is a lot coming from her. The Goat Cheese Tart is not to be missed-- in addition to just being flat out tasty, the texture of creamy goat cheese against the pie-like crust was my favorite part.Entrees were the Hanger Steak, the Pork with Morels and one of the evening's specials, a Turbot with Saffron Sauce. The 4 vegetables on the side were purees of carrot, cauliflower and potato with a few slices of grilled pineapple. All three were deftly prepared and indeed richly sauced (no one was complaining). I sometimes find in NY that chefs/restaurants are not very well rounded; you might be able to get a killer steak but your fish will be overcooked (or the other way around). I really noticed, and thought it commendable, that each different protein we were served was cooked exactly as it should be. Not too much, not too little, but exactly.All three were excellent choices; but after much debate we decided the hanger steak was the best. Tender and juicy and coated in garlic-herb butter. Outstanding!For dessert we got the profiteroles and the iles flotante, a dessert I've never had but always wanted to try. Both were (who's surprised?) awesome and a perfect end to the evening. Total bill for 3 came to $168, which seemed like a bargain. Didier was all over the place-- helping out in the kitchen, on the phone, greeting the tables, seating the door.

I could've had the sides alone and have been a happy customer.Lastly, the service. The place is small, and very intimate. So the servers can seem a little too attentive at times.

2.0,12/12/2009,"Maybe I came with expectations that were too high, or maybe it was an off-night. But when I came with the bf and a bottle of white wine on a Thursday night, the experience was underwhelming. Perhaps the secret to a 5-star experience at La Sirene is the much talked about owner-chef who runs the joint, and who wasn't there when we came to eat? Either way, both the food and the atmosphere left us wanting. The hostess/waitress was overworked. Though she was attentive in the beginning, once the restaurant filled up, she tended to prioritize other tables over our own so it took some time to get dessert menus and the check. Though the restaurant is small, it would have benefited from another FOH person. We started with the moules in curry with apples. Amazing, and by far the best dish of the night. I could not stop dipping the bread into the broth! Generous portion and definitely something I would order again. The sauteed calamari, on the other hand, was rubbery and had no flavor in comparison to the moules.  For entrees, we ordered at the suggestion of the waitress, the skate and the cassoulet. Pass on the skate, which I found to be unappetizing in both taste and presentation. It was an oddly curved, flat piece of white meat that was tough and tasteless. I've never seen skate look this 'sloppy.' The cassoulet was a generous serving, filled with duck, sausage, beans, and bacon. Unfortunately, you also pay for it. At $32, the dish is not cheap and it's size makes it something that is probably better off shared lest it begins to taste boring. Entrees were served with four vegetable purees, which we actually mostly left on the table. They were good, but was I alone in not wanting to eat something with a texture akin to babyfood? I felt like the purees were a little out of place, and I didn't really know how to eat them. Ultimately, the food was not terrible and the bill was just over $100. Entrees are pricier than what I would usually pay but being able to BYOB makes the meal affordable.

5.0,11/30/2009,This tiny byo gem tucked down a side street serves food with a wow factor. This intimate 32 person dining experience is all about the food. Your basically sitting in the kitchen but well worth it. Our party tested everything from the French onion soup to the escargot as well as grilled calamari for appitizers. All were divine! For entree I had the duck breast in cherry sauce and was impressed. I was part of the clean plate club that night. My friends had the steak and shepards pie. Both were pleased. The service could not have been sweeter or more attentive. We wished the ladies waiting tables would pull up a chair and have a glass of wine with us.

2.0,11/23/2009,"After reading the reviews on La Sirene, trying the place for a Friday night date seemed like a no brainer. The great food and cozy atmosphere should have made for a great night, but we both left with bad tastes in our mouths after the way we were treated by our waitress and won't be going back for seconds - she lacked the most basic etiquette. We had just ordered desert and rather than allowing us to enjoy and finish up in peace the waitress decided to bring out the bill with the desert and strongly recommend twice that we hurry up and leave because 'others are waiting.' This came after she on three separate occasions interrupted us to complain about other customers coming in and taking up space without spending enough money. We bought an appetizer, two entrees, and a desert and ate it all in an hour and a half and were treated like we were doing something wrong because we didn't scarf it down like a McDonald's value meal and get on our way. This is the only place in my three years in NYC I have ever been abruptly told to get out so someone else could have our table. INEXCUSABLE. I understand this place is small, but there is no excuse for kicking out a couple who has been there under two hours and ordering that much food. Service quality is just as important as food quality, so while the food gets an A, the service gets an F - 2 stars.",1,0,0,AW J.,"New York, NY",0,2,0

5.0,11/19/2009,"Why, when this place already has +180 reviews, do I need to add another one for La Sirene? It is just that good. My mom was coming into the city for her bday, along with my aunt, and I was torn about where to take them for dinner. I wanted some place that they would not forget, with wonderful food, ambiance, and service. And since they're both big wine drinkers I knew that could get pricey. I could not have picked a better place to take them. It was a late Wednesday night dinner that ended up lasting past midnight, and all they could talk about on the cab to their hotel was how wonderful La Sirene was. The place, as everyone has stated, is small and intimate. I wasn't uncomfortable at all and it was actually bigger than I imagined after reading all the reviews. We walked in and were promptly seated by two delightful servers. The smell coming from the kitchen was wonderful and we couldn't wait to eat! For apps we had French onion soup, escargot, and the mussels in curry sauce. The mussels in curry were TO DIE FOR. My sister and I went through almost three bread bowls soaking up every bit of the sauce because it was so delicious. That is the number one reason I will return, I can't wait to have more. My mother has been eating escargot for 50 years, so if she says they were the best she's ever had, they must have been amazing. My aunt raved about the soup as well. For dinner they both had the goat cheese app since they were already getting full. I didn't try it, I think because I was still working on the curry sauce, but once again, they couldn't stop saying how good it was. I was torn between two fish entrees and Didier recommended the seared pompano fish fillet, a French take on a Floridian recipe. I loved it. The cherry port sauce complimented the fish perfectly, the flavor was not sweet, not too fishy, it was just outstanding. I was thankful for the recommendation. My sister had the seafood shepherds pie since she was especially hungry. Nothing but good things to say about that as well, the vegetables were very fresh and seafood was savory. For dessert we wanted something we could all share since we were stuffed. We had the profiteroles - Didier let us know this was more of a ""fun"" option on the menu. They were sweet but not too sugary, had ice cream inside, topped with chocolate callebaut. We were full and extremely pleased with everything. And the four bottles of wine had us all warm, singing, and smiling ear to ear.Aside from the food, what really made the experience wonderful was the staff and Didier. I was nervous that we would be rushed since we had the latest reservation possible, but we weren't at all, we stayed for hours without ever feeling like they were waiting for us to leave. The waitresses were awesome- we talked with them throughout the night, drank some wine with them, and one even sang some opera- I forget her name but I loved her!! And it really completed the French bistro feel. And Didier- he is the MAN. He simply will not accept a meal below his expectations. If there was anything we weren't happy with, all we needed was to say the word and he let us know it wouldn't be on the bill. But of course we were thrilled with everything. He was so friendly, and when he speaks about food you can see and hear his passion for French cuisine. Yes I'm gushing. But I loved this place. I can't help it. Lastly, one review said this place is mediocre. I think that review is garbage! Take it down!! PS...

BYOB is a major plus, especially since there are so few in the city and even fewer that actually serve great food. No sooner had we sat down the waitress began quickly opening everyone's wine and bringing us wine glasses. The service was very attentive and, despite the small size of the restaurant, they were super welcoming and nice. As for the food, highlights were: goat cheese tart, classic mussels, the skate and the hangar steak. Delicious!

5.0,11/2/2009,"Their filet mignon is what foodies dream of. Even now, a week after I've had my first meal here, I can close my eyes and float myself back into the very small, cozy, utterly delightful atmosphere that is La Sirene...and my taste buds would start to salivate. Their filet mignon comes drizzled with their miracle homemade sauce & foie gras on top. And boy - that combination WORKS. And that's not the only one. Their escargots drenched in garlic was so good that J and I almost got full sopping up the sauce with our bread. Their veal, hanger steak and duck was good too - not wow compared to their filet (I doubt much could've wowed us after our first bite into that steak) but still very good.And yet - that's not all. Service was impeccable, the establishment is BYOB and the ambience is one in which you can imagine coming with your 3 best friends and staying all night, drinking good wine you don't have to go broke afterwards paying for. The place is quite tiny - fits maybe 20 ppl max, but that's part of the charm. Just don't bring too many big bags or more than 3 people with you. And make reservations. My only real complaint is that they aren't open for lunch too. Oh - and no chicken.

5.0,10/28/2009,"In a city where liquors bills are frequently larger then food bills, I am so grateful for the recherché opportunities BYOB affords me. Normally, I would consider a $17 appetizer-sized goat cheese tart depravingly lush for my wallet. But at the rickety table, with my chiller of $7 sauvignon blanc, I allow myself such a scandalous indulgence; and after savoring this tart I would, without hesitation, order this devastatingly delicious tart no matter the cost! The crispy crust cradles a soft blend of goat cheese mingled with grapes and truffles repose under a ""veil of 90 days aged swiss cheese."" The cheese coats the mouth in warm milky affection, while the grape's sweetness flickers like sparkles all over the tongue, as the floral earthiness of the truffle lingers in the background slowly filling the nose with its musty essence... a simple and rare earthly delight.",14,7,12,Kelly B.,"San Diego, CA",233,403,830

We basically got to eat two appetizers for free, since they messed up the order and then took it off the bill. Great service overall - nice people and very accommodating.As for food, the escargot and veggie sides platter were both good. The vanilla icecream in the fresh pear dessert is especially notable. My BF got the filet with foie gras, and really enjoyed it.What Could Have Been BetterMussels (the classic one) were cooked nicely, but a bit underseasoned for me.

3.0,9/28/2009,"A rare BYOB gem in Manhattan, albeit inconsistent.  I've been about half a dozen times or so and its a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde kind of place (no, not like the theme restaurant, like the split personality character).  On one night you can have an amazing duck liver appetizer so flavorful you'll lap up the residual fat from the plate. On another you'll get an overcooked lean and dry heap of unpleasant liver chunks.  Then on another you can get a filet mignon with an incredibly tasty, perfectly slow-cooked torchon of foie gras adorned on top.  The next night, it might be a bland filet mignon adorned with a melting mess of what amounts to no more than glorified pate.  I've had good seafood there including the curry mussels.  And I've also had fish with scales not completely cleaned off. The best thing I ever had there, (I don't think it is on the menu anymore) was the aspic.  The egg was perfectly poached, and upon breaking through the gelatin and egg white, the yolk oozed out wonderfully over the different components of the dish. The combination of textures and tastes from the foie gras, egg yolk, egg white, and jelly proved to be a stellar example of how cooking should be about creating a whole which is greater than the sum of its parts.  In sum, Chef Didier can turn out some really yummy food.  But when he's not there, or when he's having an off day, that small kitchen can't seem to adequately serve decent food to all its diners.  But, BYOB and good service keep me returning and hoping that Jekyll shows up.",3,1,2,andrew c.,"Brooklyn, NY",43,78,0

BYOW, but if you came unprepared, no worries, the restaurant can call and have them delivered by a liquor store nearby. Food: Pate de Campagne Maison had  a meat-loaf texture, different from the smooth pate we are used to, but my husband loved it. Pickles served with the pate reminded me of Paris. Calamards Sautes Provencale - The calamari was cooked perfectly with garlic and mushroom  (a good contrast to what we had at Prune the other night which was very rubbery) Steamed Mussels with Curry - the mussels were plump and juicy, and the sliced apple in the curry was a hit as well. We ate the entire basket of bread after soaking them in the curry cream broth! Lamb- we ordered Medium and were presented with Medium! Lamb was tender, juicy, and covered in the unforgettable buttery sauce (probably was cooked with 3 sticks of butter, but who cares!), accompanied with sweet potatoes.  Entrée also came with a seasonal vegetable plate: butternut squash (my favorite), Mexican squash, carrot puree, and cauliflower puree.  Dessert - 3 Profiteroles covered with LOTS of really good quality bittersweet chocolate.

5.0,9/17/2009,"This is review one of a two part series - the best experience and the worst experience of 2009 (thus far). La Sirene was an absolute surprise in every way to me. I had never heard of the place (shame on me) and my honey took us here for the anniversary of the day we met. First impressions were of a cute (i.e. small), simple bistro overlooking a parking lot and the entrance to the Holland Tunnel. Said bistro did not have a liquor license and only a couple of tables were occupied around 7pm. Our tattooed server seated us at the window table (as my wife requested) and opened the bottle of wine that she had selected for the evening. It's not how I'm used to starting a special occasion meal in NYC but I have an open mind and know that fancy packaging rarely opens to the best treats.As soon as I cracked the menu however my eyes lit up. The choices were amazing, the flavour combinations decadent and the prices excellent. I started with the homemade pate. It's safe to say it was the best pate I had have EVER had at a restaurant in New York. Sublime and perfectly accompanied. From there it was the hanger steak. A generous portion of thinly cut slices (roughly ten or twelve) in a sauce that was deep and delicious. Our main courses were accompanied by a sharable plate of 4 fresh vegetables (the carrot puree infused with butter was particularly excellent). We were told that if we finished the plate (which was large) that they would just bring more. Almost stuffed I still found room for the Islands In The Sea dessert. Creamy caramelized bliss. During our dining experience - very well timed by our server (who was wonderful) - we saw the restaurant fill up. At first a few people walked in seeing many an open table. They were asked if they had a reservation and were turned away without. We thought to ourselves that La Sirene was crazy since tables were open but it filled up (on a Wednesday night). The creme de la creme of the evening was the bill. Three incredible courses that are the equal to the big boys in midtown with tax and tip was around $140. The wine we brought from home was probably about a $25-$30 bottle which would have run close to $80-$90 at a good restaurant.

My friend and I shared a small curry mussel appetizer, which was delicious because it reminds me of thai coconut curry and had a lot of garlic in it! For entree, both of us got the seafood shepards pie. It was decent, but was completely different form what I had imagined. The seafood was chopped up so small that you can't really tell what you're eating, and the mashed potatoes was kind of on the heavy side. Finally, we ended the meal profiteroles, which was okay too. It was drenched it in dark chocolate, which was kind of way over the top for my taste.

5.0,9/11/2009,"Nothing says ""it's my wedding day"" like dining less than 10 inches from a table of 14 mustachioed, middle-aged men from New Jersey.It was packed. It was warm. It was loud. It was a hodgepodge of cheek kisses from dear Didier, toasts from the table of mustaches, spoons clinking on glasses, embarrassed kisses, and six bottles of wine. It was one of the best meals of my life, and worth much more than our bill. Roasted beet and Brie salad. Incredible. Curried mussels. Wow. Bread unabashedly soaked in creamy mussel broth. Someone stop me. Filet mignon on crispy, crusty bread topped with melting foie gras pate and red wine-truffle sauce. Holy hell my heart aches for it, even though my heart really oughtta know better. Sautéed greens. Creamed carrots I want to bathe in. Profiteroles (which were, I might add, not bitter at all.) Something with pears and cream. How was I even breathing at this point? Six bottles of wine - one per person - kept our post-city-hall day-drunkenness going, while a series of congratulatory fill-ups from our very, very generous friends at the neighboring table brought us tottering right near the edge. Leaving, I think I babbled drunken praises at Didier like he'd just delivered my first-born child or saved me from a burning building or something. But I don't care, because he treated us like we were his dearest friends. I wish we really were.",8,8,8,Sara B.,"Tempe, AZ",85,86,0
4.0,9/11/2009,"Lovely little restaurant but all the 5 star reviews set a high expectation for what I thought was more 3.5 star food. The service is very friendly and its BYO which is great in NY. Maybe its cause we ordered off the prix fixe, which is not a bad deal but a la carte seems overpriced to me- large portions but I didn't want such a big serving. I had the extremely cheesy but good french onion soup and tried the pate which was also very good. None of the entrees really impressed me. My sea shepherd's pie was a cheesy goey mess of fish that was tasty but it was pretty heavy and I was glad my friends liked it so they helped me eat it. The roasted trout was simple, but a little too fishy and boring for my taste. The beef stew had a good flavor but was not tender enough. It was a good experience but I'm in no rush to go back. I could be more harsh - having recently indulged in amazing and comparably priced meals in France but maybe that is an unfair comparison.",0,0,0,Lainy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",145,634,8
5.0,9/8/2009,"One of the great ironies about living in New York is that despite the plethora of restaurants, most people end up going back to the same few places they always go to. I can understand the logic... you want to try a new place but are worried that in a sea of unfamiliar restaurants, you may drown before finding the right one.Enter La Sirene. It is everything you could ever want an intimate French bistro on a sleepy SoHo street to be. And then some. We went on a Monday since the chef prepares the food himself on Monday and Tuesday nights. Even before entering, the wonderful aromas that seductively wafted out the front door assured us that we were in for a treat. Based on research I had done (thank you, fellow Yelpers!) we ordered the goat cheese tart (perfect balance of sweetness from the figs, salty creaminess of the goat cheese, and heaven in the form of truffle oil, melted Swiss cheese and a pastry crust), the beet salad (nothing special, but certainly not ""bad""), and the curry mussels (very flavorful! But decidedly more Asian than French. This is really the only non-traditional flavor we had.)For the entrees, my boyfriend ordered the leg of lamb which was tender and superb! His sister and I shared the duck which did not disappoint. For $31, it better not! :) It had a layer of crisp skin that enveloped a soft and richly flavored center. We were initially shy about requesting to share an entree but our friendly waitress quickly said, ""of course you can share! no problem at all.""Entrees arrived with a quartet of vegetables; each lovingly prepared and well seasoned. Desserts were the chocolate lava cake (can't go wrong with molten chocolate!) and the baked crepes which I would only recommend to those who like orange zest. Although the place was full towards the end of our meal, and people had begun to wait outside the door, we were never rushed. We stayed for two hours and felt right at home despite it being our first time. We did make a reservation, which I think is the best way to go.We had a truly wonderful evening at La Sirene and everyone in the restaurant was clearly enjoying themselves, which only heightened an already memorable meal.Thank you La Sirene!

5.0,8/29/2009,"This is the best French restaurant for under $100 for two people. The BYOB has something to do with this, and it helps not to be pressured by the staff to order some extravagantly overpriced bottle of wine.My date and I shared the Soupe a l'Oignon Gratinee, which was slightly sweet, and perfect in the ratio of Gruyere to broth. You'll be hard pressed to find a better French onion soup in town.For our main course I chose the seared duck breast with cherry, port and red wine sauce. My date had a sample of this before trying her entree (veal medallions) and spent the whole evening jealously eying my dish. The sauce is thick, and they don't skimp on it either. I would come here and eat this once a week if I could afford it. The veal entree was great in it's own right, but it paled in flavor to the duck. It did however come with a delicate and sweet side of seasoned pear slices.We were pretty full by the end of the meal and didn't have room for desert. A return trip to the La Sirene is mandatory though.Lastly, our waitress Magdeline was friendly, attentive, and made us feel welcome every step of the way.

The food was good and tasty, but definitely has that home-cooked presentation and flavor to it.  We started with the goat cheese tart and had the cassoulet and duck breast as our entrees.  Our favorite was the cassoulet -- plentiful sausage, bacon, and the white beans soak up the meaty flavors of the stew.  Yum.  For the price it doesn't hold up in quality and ambiance against comparable places like South Park Cafe in SF or BIstro L'Entreponte in Montreal.",0,0,0,Steven Y.,"San Francisco, CA",48,23,1

The service was perfect - I didn't feel rushed through the meal but it also didn't take forever to get our food. My friend and I ordered the curried mussels for an appetizer and they were excellent. I could have gone through two baskets of bread just sopping up the delicious sauce but I had to stop myself. I ordered the Sea Shepherd's pie which was great. I'd never had this dish made with fish before and I was very impressed. It was very flavorful without being too rich and the potatoes were perfect. My friend ordered the veal and she loved it as well. She said it was tender with a rich sauce, complimented by a side of pear slices. They also gave us a dish of 4 veggies to split, each one different and yummy in their own way. The dessert menu looked great but we were way too full to order anything. Maybe next time!

Keep in mind this place is tiny with an open kitchen.  It's cute but while you are enjoying all the smells of the kitchen (and they are great) your clothes will be absorbing all of the odors.  When we got back to our hotel and the doorman opened our cab door he took a step back and exclaimed how we smelled like take out.  Kind of amazing.

5.0,8/22/2009,"It is hard not to fall in love with this little gem of French cuisine in NY. The food is great and the place feels exactly right in every aspect. And that starts with the waitress who was wonderfully friendly, despite us showing up with only half the party we had made reservations for. The restaurant is tiny with the kitchen more or less part of the one room of the restaurant. Initially there was only one other couple in the restaurant (we arrived at 7) but then by eight it was completely full, which i guess is not too hard since it just has a bunch of tables. Despite the size though it was never really loud, it felt very much like having a dinner party at home. and so did the food. while certainly much better than at home it didn't come with the uppidy feeling of restaurant food, it arrived on plain plates, with little decoration on it, or visuals to make it look better on the plate. it was plain and simple. as a started we had the curry mussels (since the waitress was quite insistent that we didn't get the white wine mussels with our red wine) and it was certainly no mistake, the curry mussels were amazing, completely different from other mussel dishes. but the sauce was not too overwhelming to drain out the overall mussel taste. the other starter was the pate which also was really good. nice and chunky with a nice side of pickles. as the main course i had the skirt steak. and this was amazing. cooked quite french ... the medium was still quite bloody ... but the taste was just perfect. what made it so special was the sauce it was served with. the only way i can describe it is similar to the sauce you get escargots in. an olive oil/butter herb and garlic mix. and the mix of this sauce with the steak was a perfect combination. as a desert i had the dish that someone else before me already described, without remembering the name ... same here. i don't recall the name, but it was amazing. it felt like my grandmother made it. it was a soft meringue floating in a vanilla milk sauce with fresh caramel on top ... very good. while i agree that this is the perfectly romantic date restaurant, the food and service will make me come back here even if i am not on a date. it is just great food in a great environment. to sum it up: make a reservation buy some wine to bring with youbring cash to payrelax and enjoy the fantastic food reading all the other reviews i have to say i just feel a little left out since i missed a night when Didier was there, talking and shaking hands ... i guess just all the more reason to come back",3,1,1,Carsten S.,"Washington, DC",46,108,38

She also reminded us that it was BYOB , but since it was a Sunday evening we were not going to try to hunt down a wine shop . They gave us a glass of house wine on the house to hold us down , which I thought was really nice of them to do.

They came with a platter of vegetables consisting of a spicy pineapple ,carrot purée , some type of Mexican vegi. , and eggplant.

Chef Didier came over to say hello and tell us a bit about our food and our lovely waitress brought us more of the carrot side when we mentioned how tasty it was.  The trout with an almondy cream sauce was very tasty, but did lack a bit of salt.  The shrimp entree, was a hit.  Loved the BYOB (there's a wine shop a block or so away, just ask the host) and the waitress kept our wine chilled and our glasses full.  I will be back next time I'm in the city!",2,0,1,Beth L.,"Washington, DC",91,269,104
5.0,8/15/2009,"Bottom line - very good food, very romantic setting, amazing and friendly service + BYOB (booze and soda). GREAT date spot. I'll be back.  The entire experience makes this place worth 5 stars.For those who want a more detailed description- I was able to get a reservation almost at the last minute which really surprised me since it is such a highly rated restaurant. We get there around 9 pm, the cozy restaurant is not crowded and the hostess / waitress is incredibly inviting. She proceeds through the specials and mentions that the restaurant is BYOB and cash only. BYOB doesn't necessarily mean booze - our waitress tells us we could go to the deli nearby and bring soda as well. There is NO corkage fee.Shortly after we ordered, Didier Pawlick came over and enthused over the beautiful meal we were about to have in a short while. The air filled with a mouth watering garlic aroma and before i knew it, I was enjoying a succulent steak. FOOD: Tournedos Rossini - Very very beautiful. The filet is very soft and accompanied by a sauce that is a bit tart. However, the foie gras mixes very well with the entree and suddenly something magical happens. The dish came with a side of 4 vegetables which were quite tasty. The waitress even allowed me to get more vegetables as i devoured 1 set of veggies. I remember having difficulty pulling away from my dish to talk to my date. Vegetable platter: An assortment of fresh vegetables was presented to my finicky date. She loved it. I can not remember the exact components of her dish, but there was a carrot puree, sauteed spinach and mushrooms, spiced pineapples, Mexican cactus to name a few of the veggies. My date LOVED the dish. They even give more vegetables on your dish if you would like. We left the place with no room for dessert, wide smiles and a hand shake from the chef.  He even refilled our vegetable platter again for our doggie bag.  I give 5 stars- the ambiance and the food leave you with an incredibly happy feeling.

Was tempted to order filet mignon but settled for lamb leg as my husband vehemently opposes non-organic meat. It was good, but not mind-blowing. My husband's duck breast with cherries, however, WAS excellent, the only item with which I was totally impressed. Chocolate lava cake was good, if nothing special. The service was very good, and the owner was cordial, but I'm not exactly dying to go back, which is how I tell the difference between three stars and four stars.

5.0,7/19/2009,"La Sirene has that certain je ne sais quoi... DAMN.GOOD.FOOD. Bring your cash and your wine and plan to walk home to work off the calores -- it's so worth it. Overall: 4.5 stars.The place is tiny and quirky and adorable, and the waitstaff even have French accents. And the food...my god, the food. The goat cheese tart is perfection. Do not miss it. The curry mussels -- amazing, a generous portion of fat, juicy mussels in a cream-based sauce with a subtle spicy curry flavor. The shepherd's pie -- light and fluffy, with a spectacular browned crust and moist chunks of pollock and veggies. We also had one of the specials, duck confit. Duck's not typically a fave but holy crap, this was wonderfully tender and juicy and in an incredible red wine sauce with hints of cherry. A quarter star off for the desserts -- we had the first and last items on the dessert menu, some kind of cream-puff ice cream profiterole things -- they were delicious, yes, but I just wasn't as blown away as I was with the rest of the meal. And we felt like both desserts were essentially the same thing, except one had chocolate. Next time I'll try some of the other desserts -- the peach melba sounded yum but I was outvoted.The other quarter star off is for small lags in service -- we felt our waitress's interest in us dwindled as the meal went on. They did get busier, but still -- we had to ask her to open our second bottle of wine, for the dessert menu, for the check, etc. Still very good service overall, though. And the prices are quite reasonable -- a big plus.We will SO be back. And you should SO make sure to check it out, too. Bon appétit!",3,0,2,Malini B.,"New York, NY",2,37,0
5.0,7/16/2009,"I have been dining at La Sirene for the past two years and have no plans of quitting anytime soon!  It is hands down my most favorite restaurant in the city. I've eaten here on many different occasions- for an anniversary celebration, a family outing, Valentine's Day, a surprise birthday dinner for 8, gossip night with the girls- and they have always been so accommodating.  I have contacted Chef Didier a few times about wine recommendations and he's so kind to entertain my questions. He's even offered wine that he happened to have at the restaurant when I didn't bring any with me, just so my dining experience could be complete!   The atmosphere is relaxed, welcoming, albeit cramped.  It's part of the charm.  You won't find any of the pretense here that you normally do at the typical mega restaurants of NYC.  The service is wonderful and provided by two charming waitresses.  Sometimes Chef Didier himself will take your orders which is a treat.  He can be quite bombastic and brash but he'll admit to this himself, saying he is French after all.  Now if that alone doesn't want to make you eat here, I can tell you the food is fantastic.  My order always consists of  curry mussels and hanger steak.  I always gravitate to these two because they are so delicious and savory, not to mention comforting.  The bread basket runs low real quick once the curry mussels come out because I'll sop up every last bit of the broth with bread.  All the good things to say about the food has pretty much been said in previous reviews.  I've tried almost everything else on the menu though through my friends' orders and I haven't found one dish I don't like.    To sum it up, La Sirene is a lovely experience all around.  I didn't even get to say half the things I wanted to rave about the restaurant because then my review would never end.  Honestly I don't have a single complaint and I've eaten at many different restaurants in the city.  I always come back to La Sirene though!  The restaurant has not lost any of the charm and deliciousness it's had since it opened.  Make your reservations ASAP as it is kind of a hole-in-the-wall and don't forget it's BYOB!  No corkage fee!",3,0,0,Jenny Lyn A.,"New York, NY",15,4,2

Learning from previous experience, I made sure to make a reservation well in advance.  Received a call from the restaurant confirming the reservation and reminding me that they are a BYOB. Much appreciated! (And cash only too). We began our meal with the curry mussels and goat cheese tart. Both were flavorful. I found myself wishing that I was eating alone so I could hoard the heavenly flavors of the tart. Mussels were large and well seasoned, the sauce was perfect for dipping the french bread that was provided. Delicious!! Onto the main course: Hanger steak for me which comes with a side of veggies which somehow look/taste healthy but are out of this world. I wanted to pack some and take it home. Esp the sweet potato. Friends got the Filet Mignon de Porc Poelee Aux Morilles, fish special of the day and the cassoulet. Yum. And to top off the meal, Profiteroles. WOW. Good thing to know: If you decide you need more wine during the meal, theres a wine shop near by or you can call Hudson Wines to have some delivered at no charge!

Food and atmosphere.The food: appetizer was the pate, overall ok, it fell apart  too easily, tasted  as much  like a seasoned ground beef as a pressed seasoned pork but not bad. Small pickled pearl onions and cornichons were good..The main dish, a signature offering of skate wing with mango, was poor at best,  the problem seemed to  be way too much time under a heat  lamp or in an warming oven, maybe waiting for the entree of my guest.  The skate wing was swimming in separated butter on a way too hot plate and to my taste, overcooked chopped mango on top.Then to top it all off, the heat near the kitchen was ridiculous, sweating hot. It was not a hot night in the City and there was an overhead fan trying to move some air around but when a guest is not comfortable then all bets are off.BYOB is a nice plus but I would be leery of sending anyone to dine there.",0,0,0,Artiste A.,"Buffalo, NY",0,18,0

The dishes came with veggie sides such as carrot puree, mashed potatoes and some other greens...which didn't really matter because that carrot puree took the cake. When the waitress asked if we wanted any more veggies, I just asked for more of the carrot. I probably would have licked the dish, but decided not to embarrass my friends. My friends got the hanger steak and it was like nothing I've had before. SO GOOD. We all were all completely satisfied with our meals.And Yelpers were not kidding about the size of the place.

4.0,6/3/2009,"A REAL French Bistro, in New York?  W00t!  FTW.  Yes, in fact, there are still places to get reasonably priced, gorgeously prepared and authentic French food in New York.  La Sirene happens to be one of those places, so get it while you can.Does it serve beer/wine/alcohol?  No.  So, BYOB.  That's probably the only strike against this little tucked-away gem in SoHo.  Was there anything on the menu not worth trying?  No.  Was it all delicious and well prepared?  Yes.  What stands out?  Without hesitation, get the ""Hachis Parmentier de la Mer"", which is a seafood shepherd pie.  Oh. My. God.  You'll want to smoke a cigarette after this dish (this coming from someone who doesn't smoke).  Then there's the fresh fish dish - we had skate with mango, et al.  Holy seafood, Batman.  The test of any authentic French bistro is its cassoulet.  Virtually every bar/bistro in France prepares its own, usually months in advance.  Typically, in the U.S., you'll find this dish prepared straight out of a ready-made can.  La Sirene, I'm pleased to say, holds true to its roots and makes their own duck cassoulet, and while a huge dish, is worth every morsel.  Seriously, this place rocks.  It's quaint, cramped, and charming in spite of it all - exactly what you would expect of an authentic French bistro.  Check your prestige at the door, close your eyes, and be transported to France.  Just remember to bring your own bottle of wine.",4,2,3,Nils E.,"San Francisco, CA",154,101,1

She said La Sirene without hesitation, noting that BLA was a bit touristy. She made us a reservation, which we later realized was totally necessary for this very small restaurant.So, my husband had a mussels app and the much-touted cassoulet, which was wonderful - rich and literally dripping with duck fat. I've never seen him defeated by a meal, but he really couldn't eat it all - not because he was full, but because he just couldn't eat another bite of the decadence. I liked it too, but it's not for the faint of heart (or weak of artery).I had the goat cheese tart, which was tasty but I can't say it was the best thing I've ever had. Maybe my expectations were too high after reading some of the other reviews?All in all I really liked the place and want my friends and family to go. It is the kind of ""hidden"" place that you ultimately want the most when you're visiting another city - it's small, intimate, special but not pretentious, not trying to be crazy fancy - just really authentic and doing what it does without unnecessary flourishes.I can't quite give it 5 stars however (though I'll note that I can't think of any place I would give 5 stars to). The service was very pleasant but I did notice that one server was consistently turning away reservation-less customers with a pretty condescending attitude. It's a small thing but it turned me off - I mean, not everyone is going to know how fabulously desirable your restaurant is, so there's no need to act like they're crazy for even trying. Also, it might not bother you, but there's no sink in the ""bathroom"", which is disconcerting but oh well. And finally, I appreciate the byo_ policy but they only have one non-water drink (I believe) - that's diet coke, and the closest liquor store (according to the server) was several blocks away and only sold wine.

(9.2/10) La Sirene definitely is added to the list of ""great things that come in small packages"", lol because despite weekends leaving you with the personal space of sitting in a busy subway car, lol it oddly adds to the ambiance of the whole dining experience (maybe due 2 the sporadic wine sharing sessions & quality cross tables small talk) The 2 female hostesses/waitresses are super cute, super amiable and quite effective in aiding that small kitchen turn out consistently great food in good time. The 2nd time dining there i met the head-chef/owner, He was a funny, young heavy accent having young french guy, I was running late and in a rush 2 get to the Will Ferrel Play that night and i had ordered frog legs but he had recommended for time restraints I'd have the butter pan seared skate entree, i willingly went along and was certainly not disappointed, despite the initial simple presentation it was rich complex & all around quite heavenly, My co-diner had the hangar steak and it was cooked perfectly and quite good. However the dishes that really stood out to me so far &  I recommend immediately were the high quality classic escargot app & mussels & white wine sauce, The awesome borderline orgasmic Filet Mignon w/ Foie Gras, & The Roasted Duck with cherry, port, red wine sauce which was amazingly crispy on the outside & juicy on the inside and the sauce which was sweet & rich yet not over powering. ALL THIS at amazing prices (by Manhattan standards of course) lol & Throw in the Fact That it's BYOB, which by its own saves you the 150 dollars you'd probably spend on a single bottle of Par+ wine in a different french restaurant of similar quality, Or at least even the 20-50$ corkage fee. La Sirene Definitely is a new City Fav & Although as an aspiring Rst Mgmt. student I do want them to due really well and them have many people know how good they are there's a good percentage of me that wanted to give them just a 1 star so i could lower the avg. rating & keep it no more busier than it already is at least just a little bit longer lol But I suppose this Is best Karma Wise.

5.0,4/3/2009,"After eating countless dinners here I've finally decided to (wo)man up and write a review of my favorite restaurant in the city.I can't think of anything wrong with this restaurant.  The service is accommodating and attentive, even though you can tell people are busy beyond belief.  Chef Didier himself plays host sometimes, greeting his diners and taking their coats downstairs himself with the most charming joie de vivre.  And the food, good God, the FOOD is literally PERFECTION.The first time I ever had their hangar steak, I thought I died and went to heaven.  I have never tasted a more perfect medium rare in my life.  The cassoulet is impossibly rich, the filet mignon with foie gras perfectly cooked, the veggie sides delicious complements to the entrees.  Their food really excites me - something I haven't gotten even from fine dining/Michelin restaurants in the city...!  To the point where if someone tells me they don't like this place for whatever reason, I automatically sort of don't like them either.  Yes, that's right.  I'll seriously consider dropping a friendship over this.  The place is small so you'll bump elbows and knees sometimes, plus I'll warn you that you WILL reek of butter and garlic when you leave (which sort of makes it a little tricky to go for drinks anywhere nice after, unless you have time to go home and change/shower).  But the BYOB factor also makes up for that, if the food hasn't already.  Beautiful food, charming chef, intimate/cozy space = a superior evening.  Anyone who hasn't been is seriously missing out on something great.",3,2,3,Erica C.,"New York, NY",47,107,0

We called an hour before the reservation to see if they could squeeze in one other person, and they said yes, no problem!  Mind you, the place is TINY, but they still managed to squeeze in another table for our friend.-Friend came half an hour late, but no complaining or even hint of irritation from the wait staff.-We didn't BYOB, so they gave us 3 glasses of complimentary red wine! -Delicious food that doesn't skimp on portions.  We ordered the duck with cherry sauce, the goat cheese tart, the steak and the fruit sabayon.  I am still dreaming about the GOAT CHEESE TART and the FRUIT SABAYON ( a light not very sweet dessert, perfect because we were stuffed at this point!)! My goodness gracious!  -The 4 side dishes that came complimentary with the entrees were a pleasant surprise!The place literally felt like I was sitting in someone's kitchen in France.  It was so hearty, and made and served with love.  You could tell the owner (who shook our hands as we left and thanked us) really cared about his establishment and making the customer happy.  This was a wonderful introduction to New York.  I will be back in the future!",3,0,2,Jolene M.,"Los Angeles, CA",291,289,439
5.0,3/23/2009,"La Sirene is a dream of a neighborhood bistro:  small enough that you feel like you're known; hidden enough that it feels like a secret find; relaxed enough that you could pop in frequently without tiring of the superb cuisine.  With only a dozen or so tables seating some twenty-odd guests, it's an intimate space -- more rustic than refined with a warm greeting from the owner-chef-host and a welcoming smile for your BYOB bottle of wine, which contributes to a bargain of a night out (though the entree prices themselves are not inexpensive).  The room can get loud with a few large parties crammed in, but that doesn't detract from the charm.  The kitchen is tiny and the wait (for seating or service) may be a tad long, but you should be forgiving for the level of love lavished on the quality ingredients:  this is superlative cooking worth a special trip.  On a recent visit the filet mignon special with foie gras was mouth-watering and perfectly prepared -- the essence of what those items can be with the right (and all-too-rare) touch.  The best chefs of Languedoc would be impressed with La Sirene's magnificent cassoulet, which provides a lesson in the cannelloni bean:  custardy and rich with the flavors of rosemary, garlic and duck.  Don't misunderstand:  this isn't Daniel or Bouley (nor would you want it to be) -- but with the right set of expectations (think tiny neighborhood gem), you're in for a treat.  May La Sirene live long and thrive.",1,0,0,Boston F.,"Boston, MA",0,17,2

As we walked in the door, the owner (or main chef?) came forward and greeted me with my name, ""Bon soir mademoiseille Helena!"" which completely took me by surprise that I forgot how to reply in my limited French (we had a reservation and they remembered my name!). My boyfriend at first thought I knew the owner or something. The place was pretty small but very cute and boutique-y, which gave a very intimate and cozy atmosphere. The food was delicious! For French food in New York, it was really quite reasonably priced, and the wine was BYOB, which really could save quite a bit of money. Did I mention how great the service was?

It reminded me of tiny restaurants in the 'Jordaan' in Amsterdam. You can check out what the chef is doing and there is one server keeping it all under control. I liked the pace of the service.

5.0,3/10/2009,"La Sirene rocked my Friday night.  It was a frigid night, and I was dreading trekking all the way down to Varick street, but I somehow pushed myself into the subway station.  I've been to Ivo & Lulu before, so I had no issues finding La Sirene, but I can imagine it could get pretty challenging for people who are not regular Holland Tunnel commuters!  The place itself is small and very charming, with absolutely no pretenses about it.  The waitress showed us to our table and promptly popped open our giant bottle of red.  The wine made us warmer and the soft french music set the mood for interesting, drunken banter.  The ordering process was seamless as the waitress gave us very honest and pointed recommendations. Dolan (the girlfriend) got the Idaho trout stuffed with brie in a almond butter sauce and I got the goat cheese tart with shallots, truffles, swiss cheese.  When the waitress brought the food, I had a feeling that I was going to remember it forever and MY GOODNESS, I will.  With one bite of the goat cheese tart, it was like I had been plugged into a culinary matrix - I was the king of the parallel universe and I had built a kingdom where everything was edible.  I was walking around with my entourage taking bites off pizza tree barks and diving in spicy green curry pools, and then I caught a glimpse of the newly built goat cheese tart bridge, and warily took a taste.  The flavors were so incredibly rich that I demanded fireworks and immediately sanctioned a city rebuild with only goat cheese tart building mortar! Dolan's fish was really well-seasoned and the bold brie flavor was controlled well by the subtle almond butter sauce.  Knowing her, I am sure she had a dream sequence of her own.  Her dish also came with a side of 4 pureed/mashed vegetables (ranked from awesomely awesome to good): cauliflower, potato, carrot, eggplant.  We ended the meal with the fondant au chocolat noir. The dark chocolate lava made my imagination run wild in a different direction and for the sake of decorum, I will not discuss it.  Overall, it was a delicious meal!  I would definitely recommend La Sirene and I will go back many, many more times to eat that goat cheese tart.",3,1,2,Rahul G.,"New York, NY",101,130,0
5.0,3/2/2009,"Oh La Sirene, how I love your food AND your staff!The staff had a mix up with our reservation. They called me twice and left a voicemail to let me know about it but I didn't notive it until I arrived on a friday night with my party of 6. They explained, apologized, mumbled for a few minutes and then started to re-arrange empty tables. This was a huge deal because the restaurant could only seat 25 patrons and they were expecting a big party coming in.The food was magnificent! I came here once in the summer and once in the fall. The menu items are seasonal so if you're drooling about their Hanger Steak or Roast Lamb Leg, then you may have to wait until then to feast your sharp little teeth into them. The mussels are also a great choice! We felt bad for the staff as the little mix up really did make things hard for them. There was barely enough room for them to get from the kitchen to the other tables but they handled it well. The other highlight of the night was the bill. French comfort food at comfort prices! Gotta love it. Oh don't forget they're cash only so be sure to hit up the ATM.

The navy blue walls provided a perfect backdrop to all those photoshoot-worthy photos you and your gfs will surely be taking after that 4th bottle of bubbly.There is nothing pretentious about this place and provides a shiny beacon of hope for those who have thought proper BYOB places have officially ceased to exist in our great city. Their goat cheese tart alone is enough to make me want to eat nothing else for months on end. It was tangy, creamy and perfectly entrenched with sweet, fresh figs. You could not ask for more perfection in a dish. I had the trout for my entree and it was definitely not disappointing. The fish was flavorful and paired well with the brie it was stuffed with. It even came with four sides of veggies. My favorite being a wonderfully creamy carrot puree. It was like orange, whipped air.  Sounds gross, but I promise it's not. :)Everyone was happy with their entrees and from the mussels to the skate I think we tried almost everything on the menu.

5.0,2/8/2009,"I used Yelp to find La Sirene and selected it because it was the highest rated French Bistro in New York City.  Let me be one of the many to say that Yelp - and all its reviewers for La Sirene - didn't let me down!  The place is amazing!Yes, its a little small, cash only and BYOB... but I never thought twice about it.  In fact, I have to give them props for being cash only; I respect that.  Perhaps not as visually stimulating as some other snooty restaurants in SOHO but once you bite into their food, you forget about any reservations you might have had prior to sitting down.Let's jump to the service review before I reminisce about the food I had the other day... The service we had was great.  The waitresses were very friendly, helpful, patient, and spoke slow enough for us to hear through the conversations next to us and their strong french accents.  I can say I over tipped them because of their thoughtfulness and their attention to my wife and I and it was well deserved.  They don't have starter plates that get replaced with real plates or anything formal but they were right there with the bottle opener, water, dessert menus and anything else we needed at the right time.  I'd go back just for the hospitality even if the food was mediocre... but its not... its awesome!So what brought me to La Sirene was the lure of good French bistro cuisine. Having spent some time in Montreal's solidly French quarters, I remember having the best cassoulet I had ever had.  And I went to La Sirene looking for that same dish... and I found it!  But to start the meal, I had French onion soup - really good.  Its difficult to mess up that type of soup but when you do, it tastes horrible.  You'll have to trust me when I say I thought it was perfect - exactly what I wanted in French onion soup; nothing I didn't want.  The right amount of bread, onion, cheese, & broth that hit the spot on the ridiculously cold night I went to the restaurant.Like I said, I went to La Sirene for the cassoulet - not knowing they had it but simply hoping they served it.  Well, they did.  This dish is not for those faint of heart (the portion is huge) - or with heart problems as its filled with duck meat, duck juices, duck sausage, pork, and cannelloni beans.  Its just dripping with flavor that I've not tasted in years.  The beans, meat, and juices bring your mouth as close to heaven as it will get in this world bite after bite.  I'll be getting this dish again.My wife had dessert and loved it.  I skipped the sweets after having such a rich dinner but she loved it.  I wish I remember what she had, though.I've recommended this place to all the people anyone looking for authentic French bistro style food.  Its worth the price.

We happened to come on one of the nights that they owner was cooking. Calamari - delicious and uniquely prepared. Instead of being caked in breadcrumbs and cheese, the norm, it came lightly covered in a pesto sauce. DELISHH. My date got the filet mignon, rare. I got the rabbit. Our dishes came with a side of veggies including sweet potato, zucchini and two unknowns - all very good. The filet was not the greatest steak in the city, but pretty damn tasty for being $25. My rabbit was good, but, I forgot how tiny a rabbit is. There are a lot of bones on that little guy! So, I left a little hungry, but the meat that I did find and the sauce accompanying the dish were both good.After getting our entrees, the owner personally came over to apologize for the wait.

5.0,12/26/2008,"My review is based on my 2 visits. :D Tip: My best suggestion is to reserve a table away from the door during the winter and go when the owner is there. The experience is vastly different. BYOB with no corkage fee. Cash Only.  1st time: Overall 3.5 out of 5 Service: Owner wasn't there, 2 waitresses. We were sat closest to the door and we were FREEZING. I asked if we could switch seats and the waitress said they were reserved and politely refused. No one showed up and we froze - If they offered halfway through our meal to switch seats it would have made us so happy but they didn't. Other than the seating issue, the service was good. I didn't know it was cash only so we had to go to the ATM and they trusted me to go without leaving an ID or a credit card which we thought was very nice of them.  Food: - App: French Onion Soup - Tasted great but was served lukewarm. I really wanted something pipping hot because I was freezing so I was a bit disappointed. - App: Mussels w/Curry: The MOST AMAZING MUSSELS I HAVE EVER HAD. HEAVENLY. I can eat this everyday for the rest of my life and die happy. My favorite dish on their entire menu. It has a deliciously addictive quality to it too.- Ent: Baked Sea Shepherd Pie: I prefer dishes that have a little more bold flavors. After the incredibly flavorful Mussels w/curry, it was rather lacking.- Ent: Roasted Lamb Leg: Was delicious and I enjoyed every bite but each thinly sliced pieces was a bit dry/hard/overcooked. I'll order it again sometime and give it another chance.  - Des: Sorbet (Raspberry, Coconut, Lime): If you're a sorbet lover this place has fantastic sorbets. If you like citrus def try the lime sorbet. The coconut sorbet tastes like fresh frozen coconut juice. Just absolutely amazing. The raspberry sorbet was great but I prefer the lime and coconut sorbet.  2nd Time: Overall 5 out of 5 Service: Owner was there, 1 waitress. The owner called to confirm my reservation and reassured me I will have a table away from the door which made me really happy. The owner goes ABOVE AND BEYOND to please all his customers. He has such a genuine smile, enthusiasm and passion it's contagious. That alone makes your dining experience special. The waitress was a one woman waiting machine. Extremely attentive, polite, friendly, fast and courteous. If I owned a restaurant, that's the waitress I want to hire. The service on this night was the best I had in a very long time.       Food: Everything was made to perfection and I don't say that often. We ordered 2 Prix Fixe Dinners and it is an amazing deal. The portions are generous and the quality was superb.  - App: Pate: It's homemade, rich and delicious, especially smothered on their bread!! Comes with cornichon, pickled onions and a tiny salad. Was divine. - Ent: Mussels in White Wine: Fantastic! Delicate and incredibly delicious. If you don't like the idea of shellfish with dairy/curry, get this.  - Ent: Mussels w/Curry: See Above.   - Des: Sorbet: See Above. - Additional Des:  Sabayon Chaud aux fruits du moment: My friend and I had a bite and we were left speechless. It is spectacular. A layer of fresh fruits with liquor(?) and topped with whipped egg yolk and then baked. The egg yolk turns into a thin layer of crepe. Every diner should try this desert!!",5,0,4,Itsuko S.,"Bergenfield, NJ",9,55,0
5.0,12/16/2008,"This tiny little bistro tucked away on the West side (almost in Tribecca) was a completely unexpected treat. The Prix Fixe dinner for $25 was an enormous bargain, considering the amount of food we got. The portions were absurdly (and delightfully) generous for New York City French cuisine, and the atmosphere, though cramped, was fun and relaxed. Each reservation seating is given a luxurious two hours for its meal, so there's plenty of time to luxuriate.I had the French Onion soup, which was light and delicious, while my friend started off with a duck liver paté that was quite good. But my excitement didn't really start until our plates of mussels came out. These were succulent and delicious, and soaking in a sauce/soup that was incredible. I had the wine sauce variation, but I regret not getting what my friend did: a light creamy curry sauce. After finishing the muscles we indulged in the soup and every speck of the flavorful ingredients that added to its flavor.The waitress, despite manning the dining room herself, was incredibly attentive, constantly noticing our need for more bread to soak up the sauce. The chef and owner was regularly out and about the dining room, and when I asked the waitress what a particular desert was (its description, in slightly mangled English, wasn't all that helpful) he nudged in excitedly to explain it himself. It turned out to be one of the most spectacular things I've ever eaten, the Sabayon Chaud aux fruits du moment. A hot assortment of liquor fruit compote topped with a frothy egg yoke top, then lightly grilled until the yolk becomes almost a thin layer of crepe. It was an absolutely moving experience that left me near tears.I treasure places like La Sirene. It's tiny, their hours are short, and they are missing amenities like a liquor license and a credit card machine, but they are happy to prove to those that give them a chance that these things are merely secondary, and will dazzle you with an attention to detail and a pure love for their art that is second to none.

5.0,11/9/2008,"My mother, father, and I ate at La Sirene on Saturday night for dinner and had a phenomenal time.  Our waitress, a young woman named Isabel or Isabella--I'm not sure which is correct--was charming, energetic, friendly, and altogether lovely.  She steered us toward some of the most delicious food--a creamy goat cheese appetizer as well as a tangy mussel appetizer dish--both of excellent portion and flavor.  Our duck entrees were like eating dessert--although the dessert menu stands on its own--and we left completely satiated.  An adorable restaurant with a very sweet server.  Thank you!",4,4,2,Bryn T.,"New York, NY",0,5,0
5.0,11/9/2008,"Good things come in small packages...in terms of square footage & portion size. It's an understatement, but don't stop yourself from making a reservation here. The food here is excellent and the BYOB policy is encouraged. This place is very small, but the eclectic decor and friendly bohemian servers are a good distraction if you normally suffer from claustrophobia. Seating is cramped and the tables are placed so close to each other you can hear conversations from neighboring diners. It may feel uncomfortable at first, but once the food arrives...you'll feel so much better!For an appetizer, I recommend the sautéed calamari with garlic, parsley olive oil bread crumbs, tomato and mushroom. The preparation is simple and seasonings are perfectly balanced. I wished it didn't come in such a small portion because I found it to be so addictively tasty.                          For the entree, I had the pan seared skate fish with mango, caper berries and a small clump of rice. The skate itself was light, thin, toasty, and flavorful.For dessert, all four of us shared the dark lava chocolate cake with homemade coconut sherbert. One poke with the spoon, the cake collapsed and melted chocolate leaked all over the plate. I'll definitely come back for dinner during the early bird hour when no other diners are around. 5 stars well deserved!",3,1,1,Wendy C.,"New York, NY",0,303,23

4.0,10/30/2008,"This cute spot is known for great French food, and more specifically, for their mussels.  It's a teeny little place where you literally almost sit on top of the people next to you.  But, the waitstaff do their best to make everyone comfortable.  They are friendly and upbeat and make the whole experience of being there lots of fun.We had the mussels in the wine and garlic sauce, which were excellent.  I also had the goat cheese tart, which was different than what I expected, but was amazing and super tasty.  The boy had the French Onion Soup and it was perfectly prepared.There are only a few things that kept this place from getting 3 stars:1.  cash only.....it's just a pain in the ass, who carries that much cash anymore?2.  BYOB...no alcohol available, which can be a good thing, or be an extra trip to make before trying to make your reservation time3.  reservations made on Opentable.com don't get any points...that's just silly.",3,0,2,Jessica L.,"San Francisco, CA",50,657,0
5.0,10/29/2008,"8:30 PM reservation for four after a Yelp Elite event on a extremely Cold,dreary and rainy Tuesday evening in the last week of October.I have read much about La Sirene from my fellow Yelpers and although I was excited I managed to curb my enthusiasm.  The location of the restaurant is literally a block away from the Holland Tunnel, meaning unless you have heard about this place you most likely will never know of its existence and I must say after having had the opportunity to experience La Sirene, I am glad I am able to share in the knowledge of its existence.Very small place, fits maybe 16+ people, but very comfortable and cozy like a old world cafe.  We were greeted with smiles by the owner Didier and a very cordial hostess, I should've asked for her name.  They kindly checked out coats in for us.After reviewing the menu here is what was ordered.Appetizer:- Escargots a la Bourguignone - Half dozen roasted escargots in butter and garlic sauce- Moules Rochelaises - Mussels cooked with curry, diced apples and light creamThere was also a small appetizer dish with four items, carrot puree, eggplant, squash and au gratin.  Although they were all good, my favorite was definitely the squash followed by the carrot purée.The escargots was very good.  The mussels were fantastic, very balanced taste where the curry wasn't too overpowering as curry usually is.  This is my first experience with a curry dish at a French restaurant and I was impressed.Entrees:- Magret de Canard Poele Sauce Montmorency - Duck breast with Cherry, Port and Red Wine Sauce. - c'est magnifique!- Onglet Poêlé à la Facon Luchonaise (Medium) - Seared Hanger steak thinly sliced covered with a Roasted Garlic and Parsley Sauce.  The steak was so tender, juicy and flavorful.Dessert:- Crème Brulée - One of the best I have ever tasted, light and airy yet flavorful.Although the food was very delicious La Sirene would've garnered a 4 star ranking from me, but with such attention to his customers' satisfaction and happiness that Didier exudes and with such love and passion for what he does, La Sirene is deserving of nothing less than 5 stars.  An experience that highly recommend.Cash only!You can reserve through La Sirene website.Verdict:  As good as it gets!",6,1,4,Billy C.,"Bayonne, NJ",242,242,49

5.0,9/25/2008,"To end the night with this restaurant was more than perfect. Especially after seeing fantastic show ""Arias with a Twist."" The location of the restaurant is one block south of the theater! The restaurant is very French, small, casual, bistro with feeling of if you are eating at someone's home. One of the reviewers wrote, ""This is the way food was meant to be eaten..."" Exactly!! We enjoyed our dinner. Thank you!The two waitresses (German and French) were very relax and easy. French waitress later came to our table and asked us ""Do you care for free wine?"" There were big group (25) of young cute French girls and boys were taking half of the restaurant and adding more French to the restaurant.We started with sautéed duck liver salad. It was amazing! The warm duck had great taste and worked beautifully with salad. Moules Vigneronne was good but I felt that wine and butter were not enough to coat the mussels and I prefer more salt for taste. White sauce veal stew and Filet Mignon De Porc was so tasty. I almost licked the plate...... but I did with my bread....To finish our meal, we had warm Sabayon with seasonal fruits. Lightly baked white form on top with fruits in a baking dish was refreshing. I could enjoy the fruits and Sabayon sauce because it's not a sweet dessert.I had an espresso to end. They were not very strong as I like but not bitter. I will definitely go back. I may try for lunch next time.*Cash only and BYOB.

I have to say, his swordfish was a little better than mine, but it was all very satisfying.We finished off with the profiteroles. When I made the reservation, I had mentioned a birthday but made no definite requests. Somehow, they must've made a note or remembered and they put candles in it! It was a sweet touch. The chocolate had just the right amount of sweetness.

It was quite an experience to be so up close and personal with the chef of our meal (certainly rare for manhattan). He recommended certain dishes, shared his enthusiasm about them and informed us what our wine would accompany. A charming passionate man and a frenchman at that!The food was lovely.

5.0,9/5/2008,"I'm going to say it -- the food here was very good but not 5 stars. However, your dining is about so much more than eating.The restaurant, chef, the server, everything else about it was  awesome so I'm giving it 5 stars. And that means something because this is the first time (in 28 reviews) I've given any place 5 stars.The short of it is this: you should go. Even if you don't love the food, you'll enjoy the experience.The play by play is this:Appetizers - Mussels with curry and diced apples. Good but just didn't do it for me. I did enjoy dipping my bread in there and people who love mussels might find it more enjoyable.- Sauteed Calarmi with garlic, tomatoes. Very good. When I go back, this will be what I order. Like a party in my mouth.Entrees- Filet Mignon (special). Also very good but about halfway through I realized I might not be a huge fan of filet mignon. I'll probably try the monk fish next time.- Duck with foie gras (special). Amazing. Melt in your mouth amazing. I only got a couple nibbles at it but was seriously considering ordering another one after the filet just because it was that good.Desserts- Profiteroles. Amazing... though I can understand why people would expect sweet chocolate. I found the chocolate to go very well with the rest of the dessert but couldn't help but wonder how it would taste with something sweet. In the end, there's no way two people could finish this thing if the chocolate was any sweeter.- Creme Brulee. Top 3 for sure. I know my creme brulee and I love the large surface, shallow dish style (more of the top) and the vanilla bean flavoring was perfect.(In a toss up, I'd get the profiteroles if I had somebody to share it with. Otherwise, I'd stick with the creme brulee.)Afterward, we enjoyed our experience so much we took a photo with the chef who was more than happy to entertain us.",3,0,2,Mathew T.,"Brookline, MA",112,57,0

Tres bon!  Appréciez de vrais aliments français qui n'ont pas dû étouffer à tastebuds Américain!Real french food without the hoytie-toytie service.Just had a fabulous meal at La Sirene - can't sing it's praises enough. The service was professional and casual at the same time.  The food was impeccable.  My group of 4 shared the appetizers:- Duck liver salad- Curry mussels- Squid- EscargotsAll were fabulous and extremely delicious.  The menu notes that the liver salad is NOT fois grois, so I wouldn't recommend if you find liver pate or the like too rich. The escargot are to die for - the garlic butter is delicious over the endless supply of fresh bread and not overwhelmingly garlic-y.  The curry and apple mussels are per other yelp reviews - tasty and very different to the standard American styled mussels - a must try for seafood fans.I had one of the specials for the evening, the swordfish.  I'm normally quite dubious re: this type of fish as it's often dry and overcooked.  Le Sirene cooked it to perfection - moist but not like I was eating a serve of sashimi @ a Japanese restaurant. The caramelized onions and side of seasonal vegetables ensured my entree was tres délicieux!!As per most people, my dessert stomach is an entirely different digestive system; I had the chocolate profiteroles and absolutely loved them.  Bitter, rich chocolate - none of that crappy American, over-sugared chocolate rubbish.  I'm glad to hear the chef hasn't succumb to some of the demanding U.S. clientele who would prefer the Hershey's crAp - good on him I say!!  One of the other people at our table had the Creme Caramel - a standard French dessert that SOOOOOO many restaurants manage to *&*!-up.... La Sirene did it true justice.  It wasn't ice-cold or hot when it came out.  The delicate balance between the cream and the vanilla pod was excellent.  Other guests at our table had the assortment of sorbets and chocolate mousse - again, nothing to fault, so really, when it comes to sweet-toothed people, this is the place for toi!And, per every other Yelp review - this place is BYO and there's no corkage charge!!  Of course, that would mean fair-hearted folks tip a little bit extra, and seriously, for Soho, this is a FABULOUS deal.  It cost roughly $60 per head, and we had 3 courses each.I commend the team at La Sirene - my friends and I had a fabulous evening accompanied with fabulous service.If I could give 6 stars I would.Bien sur!PS - It's a cash only establishment",4,1,3,Deena D.,"New York, NY",2,22,0
5.0,6/26/2008,"We held our Port Wine tasting at La Sirene and had a phenomenal time.  Though the space is small, it creates an intimate atmosphere for patrons to interact and for Chef Didier's crew to service.  Our dinner began with the Escargot (4/5), Calamard (4/5), and the Foie de Canard (untasted).  I found the two I tried to be very good but not earth-stopping.  The kitchen was very conscientious regarding the Filet Mignon preparation for one of my companions, who reported it to be ""just right.""  I was far too engaged in a medium-rare sliced leg of lamb (in garlic sauce) which was spot-on (5/5) and melt-in-your-mouth tender. I also tried the Pork tenderloin in date/coffee/chocolate sauce (reminded us of a mole) and it was also tender with a very robust sauce (5/5).  Our dessert was selected by Didier to match the wines, and he selected quite well.  We had the Fondant, Profiteroles, and Choux Chantilly which were each lovely (5/5) but likely more dessert than we should have eaten!  The Choux Chantilly was my favorite, as it created a crisp counterbalance to the wines we had brought.  The Profiteroles sauce was heavier on the cocoa than the sugar, and I'm grateful for that; it's french cooking not an icecream sunday.Overall, La Sirene is a perfect addition to NYC and one we desperately needed.  French cuisine without the hoopla, the best BYO policy you could hope for, and friendly service.  My apologies to those of you who were subjected to our revelries on 6/20 -- I only hope our enthusiasm was contagious.  Be sure to reserve a table, this place was packed and they have to do several seatings on fridays/saturdays.",2,0,1,J.Y.

Nothing is better, I tell you.But wait - what's better is the leisurely pace and the phenomenal food that followed this lovely start to our meal at La Sirene.  I had the specials - Foie Gras au Torchon (my favorite preparation of this guilt-inducing dish) as an appetizer and the swordfish entree.  I frequently find swordfish dry when out on the town - but risked it and it was worth it - tender, moist and delicious. We also had the profiteroles - which were amazing - I don't know what's wrong w/ the reviewer who didn't like them - but, well, yum.  Pure and simple.Hilariously, when the waitress brought us our last beer, it wasn't a Stella .... whaaaa? we asked.  The chef himself rushed over to apologize - he had drunk our last beer by mistake and so they brought us a substitute.  It made for an enjoyable conversation with the animated gentleman.  Even a ""stolen"" beer added to the overall charm of the evening.  But the point is - the food is spectacular.  Enjoy.",2,0,0,DeDe D.,"New York, NY",18,143,0

The night was rainy but landing at La Sirene was a fine way to stay dry for a couple hours & enjoy an excellent meal. My wife ordered the duck liver salad appetizer which was easily enough for an entree...FOR ME! I ordered the roasted trio of cheese (brie,blue, goat) salad with garlic crouton. The salads were both truly excellent with fresh greens & light dressings. I had the steamed mussels with curry, diced apples and light cream (Moules Rochelaises) as an entree. My wife ordered the sea bass special that evening served with pureed carrots, sauteed zucchinni & potatoe salad in 3 small baking dishes. The mussels were small but the serving abundant...and I still could have eaten more! The broth was terrific with the fresh French bread. Judy's bass was cooked perfectly & had a nice flavor with a hint of garlic (I prefer shallots with fish but no objection here with this dish.)Judy couldn't resist the chocolate lava cake with coconut ice cream & I had the French stlye zabaliogne with mangoes, blackberries & rasberries. I believe I won that contest. I did taste the coconut ice cream though & it was very nice. I look forward to my next visit ...which will be soon!My only objection would be that the space is not particularly conducive to quiet conversation, but that could have been due to the noisy party of 6 next to us that seemed to be talking over one another.NOTE: IT IS A BYOB RESTAURANT SO DON'T FORGET TO BYOB!",0,0,0,Tom F.,"New York, NY",66,45,105

4.0,6/6/2008,"We went for La Sirene for the first time yesterday, June 5, 2008; we had read Frank's review last year and were long planning to go. We are glad we did. It was excellent. The skate was exceptional and for was perfectly and imaginitively executed. The leg of lamb was also perfect.On par with food, the service and the staff could not have been more friendly, warm, engaging and professional. To us, and perhaps to many others, this can be just as important as the food. In fact, the service must be considered 5 star, at least from our observation on this visit.We did have a bit of bad luck in that we were seated next to a six-top of very loud, dressed for work, 20-somethings who were astonishingly loud. A couple of nice ladies from Australia who came in after us (one of whom saio she is very much a regular) actually asked the server to help quiet them down. It didn't really work, as they young people were entirely self possessed and disinterested in the suggestion. From that point on, the loudest and largest of this group loudly referred to this server as ""Mom,"" although the server was not much older than they. Generally, I don't mind groups like this, it's just that I am more expecting to encounter them at a place like ""Brother Jimmy's BBQ"" or Freds rather than La Sirene. In any event, your fellow diners are luck of the draw and on this night we drew poorly. At mid-meal the young crew dispatched a team of two to go forth and purchase more bargain spirits, so in deference to our senses we decided to save desert until our next visit.Make no mistake, this is an excellent restaurant with a talented chef whose talents clearly extend beyond the kitchen.

Upon perusing the review on the wall, we stuck with those dishes:- Roasted Escargots (1/2 dozen in the shell) [with Butter and Garlic sauce] ($11.75) - huge light colored shells, perfectly buttery and savory - better than Le Jardin's, comparable to PARIS! Yes, you read right..AWESOME!!!- Steamed Mussels with Curry, Diced Apples and Light Cream (Chef 's Favorites) ($12.75/$21.75) - we ordered the small one, which was more than enough for two. I still can't get over the diced apples. Light cream was a great touch - not too heavy and perfectly flavored. You can't help but dip your bread into this goodness - AMAZING! Yes, CURRY!- French Cassoulet Toulouse's Style [Cannellini Beans, tomato,Garlic Duck Confit, Slab Bacon & Pork sausage all Braised with Duck Fat Yummy!!] ($26.95) - the duck tasted VELVETY..super smooth texture, the beans were infused w/ duck fat and were so flavorful, the homemade fennel sausage was OK, the homemade bacon was nice and fatty - DELICIOUS!- Seared Hanger Steak [Roasted Garlic and Parsley Sauce Garlic Mashed Potato, Carrot Puree + Veggies du moment & Sauted Spinach] ($24.50) - perhaps the best hangar steak in Manhattan! Slightly pink in the middle, perfectly seared on the outside, thinly sliced and laid out carpaccio style. There was a clump of pureed sweet potato with cream in the middle of the steak plate - FANTASTIC! For the sides, the Carrot Puree was so sweet and buttery! The mashed potatoes were OK, the spinach was very good!- Grand Profiteroles au ""Bittersweet"" Chocolat [This isn't Hershey's Chocolate, but Callebaut! ($12.75) - They weren't kidding when they say Grand! Comes with 3 huge profiteroles and generous drizzle of chocolate sauce! Vanilla ice cream in the middle.

5.0,5/18/2008,"-Gasp-A coveted 5 stars from Jeremy S!Yeah so Frank Bruni beat me to it, dropped in on this little French restaurant and blew up their business (in a good way). Awesome. Chef Pawlicki certainly deserves his recent success. I had the chance of meeting Mr. Pawlicki and it's amusingly clear why he is a winner, he's an endearing obsessive. After learning I was the CEO of Yelp he spoke a mile a minute about how Yelpers are too hard on him and our advertising program is too expensive. Both hilarious in context, he has fantastic reviews and a 4.5 star rating (rare in Yelpland) and he is also a Yelp advertiser (so I guess he doesn't think it's *that* expensive!).So yes Chef Pawlicki is intense, but fortunately he channels most of this energy into his delicious creations. I started with the calamares sautes provencale (sauteed calamari with garlic, parsley olive oil bread crumbs, tomatoes and mushrooms). The calamari was meaty (not overly chewy) and the tomato and mushroom sauce made my tongue sing. For an entree I fell back to my old standby, seared duck breast which was executed perfectly. Since I was on a roll, I couldn't stop without dessert so I ordered the fondant au chocolat noir. I don't even need to describe it, just picture yourself dying and going to chocolate heaven...Our sweet French waitress noticed we didn't BYOB a dessert wine so she surprised us with a wonderful port given gratis (at this point she had no idea we were connected to Yelp). What a nice gesture!So in sum fantastic quality and value (partially due to free corkage/BYOB) paired with caring service.

4.0,5/8/2008,"Well, this one is a tough cookie to crack.Had a lovely rendez-vous with a girl here.  Having been to Ivo and Lulu before (the girl i am dating took me there in 2 mo ago) i was tempted to make a dash for it again, since it's right next door.  But i could not bring myself to have this other girl steal her thunder, so it was La Sirene. I wasn't aiming for something romantic, this was more like a friend date, so La Sirene was ideal (Ivo is def romantic).  No prententiousness either. So far so good.So we start with my wine selection.  This place, as Lulu, is BYO, so I took my time to select something decent. My adventurous spirit didn't pay off.  My wine was not good.  But then the dishes arrive. For the selections we made (pork tenderloins and some sort of duck in cherry)  i was impressed with the promptness of the order. The appetizer, french escargots, also arrived quickly and were tasty. (For those counting, it was 6 snails). They were properly prepared and went well with the bread.  Maybe the conversation was good, but all in all the food arrived faster than i thought.Apparently the chef is a well known french master.  Well, my hat's off to the chef.  The entrees were top-notch. My companion could not stop raving about her dish.  I didn't say much but i knew that my expectations had not been that high.The food is better than Lulu, no doubt.The chef actually came out to converse with the table right next to us, on his way out to go home.  Nice guy. So are the waitresses.  Charming, not pushy, and genuinely interested in us, trying to make conversation.  Nice gesture.La sirene is a great place to take a date, perhaps something informal. I am on the fence on whether this is a first date place, but good for almost any other ocassion.But then i can't give this place 5 stars for 2 reasons.1) Its too expensive. I suppose you pay premium for the food, but i go on so many first dates, i can't really afford to really get to know this place on a consultant salary, especially when some girls expect me to pay. Maybe when i move to a Fund, but not now.   (...and sorry ladies, when you dont pay, that's a big, red flag!  Unless your date is 20+ in years or kilos, its NOT ok. Don't go wondering why some of us who are not fools did not call after sleeping with you... )2) The portions.  Small. For a smaller guy or a girl, portions are ok. For a guy that plays soccer regularly and is extremely active, it won't be enough.Also note that it is difficult to bring a group here. Too small of a place. It therefore kills one of its great allures: Intimacy.All in all, i did love my experience at la sirenne.  I can't give it 4.5 stars, so 4 it must be.",0,0,1,Yelp jumped s.,"New York, NY",0,15,0

For entrees, I had the Magret de Canard and Rob had Seared Hanger Steak.  Both dishes were great.  I think the new craze right now must be carrot puree b/c I've had a lot of it lately.  It's always delicious and I always wonder why I don't eat more carrots.  The duck skin was crispy and delicious enough that I didn't even touch Rob's steak.  We finished with the Fondant au Chocolat Noir.  I wanted to try the Profiteroles but wasn't able to cajole my way into getting Rob to get them so I'll have to go back for them.  I thought the Fondant might be closer to a chocolate molten cake.  Instead, it was just a chocolate cake.  But it was our fault for assuming instead of asking.",3,0,2,Mog C.,"Hoboken, NJ",172,411,92

Everything I've tried on the menu (skate, hanger steak, shepard's pie, escargot, etc.) has been incredible. Celiacs: Be careful of the breadcrumbs in some dishes!BYOB with no corkage fee is also a huge plus.

My boyfriend and friend LOVED the hanger steak. there was nothing left to the plateDESSERT RAMBLINGS: (VERY IMPORTANT, YELPERS)The Clafoutis was dee-licious.  on the menu this is posted as the undiscovered dessert and they were not kidding. the prunes scared off my dining mates, but not to be deterred i went for it and we were not disappointed.  It's made with crepe dough and is pretty much a super bread pudding that is HOT in more ways the one.After an extensive conversation with the chef, who which is ador- AH-BLAY, apparently is very conscientious of his reviews and has taken things off the menu because people were not happy with it and posted it on yelp. so he took off the profiterolesWhy? I asked...curious that he actually took them off...profiteroles are so french...so classic.  He took them off because someone complained that the chocolate was bitter.  AH WHAT?!?  we demanded that the profiteroles be given a second try...they must be placed back on the menu.the profiteroles came out.they were AH-MAY-ZINGThe profiteroles should come back to the menu!Yelpers should be very aware and careful of their words.  otherwise good things will be removed.  Lesson be learned.",3,1,1,Yvonne Y.,"San Francisco, CA",65,174,2
4.0,2/15/2008,"As to be expected, Valentine's Day was a madhouse. I think La Sirene probably shines on a quieter weeknight because the space is si petit! Trop petit, peut-etre. The prix fixe V-day menu was great, though I wasn't terribly impressed with the asparagus and caviar salad to start. Some of the asparagus was a bit too stringy. The lobster bisque was apparently quite good, and I absolutely loved the rock point oysters. You can't go wrong with fresh oysters, citrus, and garlic, really. My baked lobster thermidor dish was phenomenal but the date's filet mignon was drowned in an overpowering cheese sauce that was so strong as to render him a little ill. I agreed. The creme brulee to finish was a nice size but certainly not the best I've ever had. I know it isn't the best night to judge since they were totally slammed, but I felt that for $70 per person, it was good, but not mind-blowing. On the upside: it is totally bring your own bottle and that helps keep the tab down!",1,0,1,Melody H.,"New York, NY",178,286,0
5.0,2/13/2008,"Me and me friends went to La Sirene while I was visitng them in NYC this past Sunday night.  We wanted real french food, and we sure got it.2 of us have been to France, and this is the closest we've been to being back there.  Again, BYO liquor.  They will chill the white wines for you and everything and no corkage fee.  We ordered: The soup of the day (cabbage), the mussels (w/ wine, tomatoes, onion, herbs), escargots, the hangar steak (medium rare, how they serve it), the fish of the day (i think it was a barramundi, an australian fish but farmed in Maine), the duck in dried cherry sauce, the oh-so-French cassoulet, and the order-7-minutes-ahead chocolate lava cake.  ALL were amazing.  This is a copy of the Time Out NY Magazine description, which was what lured us to this restaurant:""Fishing nets and low-rent posters may not entice you into this new downtown French bistro, but the exuberant cooking of Marseille-born chef-owner Didier Pawlicki should. Mussels are lavished with curried cream and apples; garlicky ruby-red slices of rare hanger steak are served with a sensuous trio of sides (a mound of carrot puree, potato gratin in a cheesy veil, and a pot of zucchini flan). A dessert of chestnut cream and chocolate sauce had us moaning--very French indeed. ""Keep in mind that the sides change (our meals offered the carrot puree, sauteed spinach, and some cooked cabbage)The reviews below adequately convey the relaxed and personable environment at the restaurant.  Very pleasant dining experience, they really care about you.Reservations seriously recommended.  As the owner said to us ""this salt shaker is so tiny...much like the restaurant""",3,0,2,Vicky H.,"Fullerton, CA",61,29,0
4.0,1/25/2008,"Love this darling little restaurant! Love Didier!I was in NY for a long weekend celebrating my birthday back in October and insisted on visiting this restaurant while there.  (Based on reviews I had read).Simply delightful.Didier and the hostess whose name escapes me at this moment were absolutely wonderful, warm and welcoming.The food was delicious and portions were quite large. The ambience was perfectly SoHo fringe (what I love and miss about living in NY).I was wistful as our meal progressed...Wishing I still lived in NYC so that I could frequent this little gem.Hugs & Bisous, Didier!;o)p.s. - be sure to bring a bottle of wine or bubbly to enjoy with dinner!",0,0,0,michelle h.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,6
4.0,1/15/2008,"Cet restaurant est trest mignon!C'est tres petit!C'est tres... francais!... I just couldn't give it 5 stars, sorry. I guess this is why the French hate us Americans. The mussels provencales were good, but nothing special. The skate fish was delicious. Oh... la beurre.The French love their butter. I love that the French love their butter.But goodness, I'm pretty sure my fish alone contained a good two sticks of butter over it.Not to say it wasn't tasty. But I'm pretty sure my cholesterol shot up a good hundred points after dinner here. And the profiterole... ah well, I guess this was the most disappointing. I love me my ice cream. Stuffed into a puffed pastry and drenched in chocolate, how could you go wrong you ask? I guess I wasn't expecting the chocolate to be so bitter and the pastry to be so dense. I went home and ate my red bean bun that I picked up from Chinatown before dinner. Oh, and if it's privacy you want, this ain't the place for you. Way too easy to ease-drop on all the surrounding tables. And thanks to our neighbors, we kept on getting interrupted with the guys asking what we had ordered. And I'm pretty sure they were gay, so it wasn't like they were even hitting on us.

4.0,1/10/2008,"I feel almost terrible for being the first to tarnish the 5-star ratings here.  That's not to say I didn't have an excellent experience at La Sirene!  The atmosphere is cute and quaint; we had a reservation for two, which was not necessary at 7PM on a Wednesday.  The crowd picked up later in the night but it was never completely full.  However, La Sirene is tiny, and can't accommodate large parties without prior notice.With five flavor choices, the mussels seem to be a popular appetizer choice.  We opted for the mussels provencal: a simple broth with tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, and bread crumbs.  They were good, but nothing out of the ordinary, though I did enjoy sopping up the juice with bread.  I had the hanger steak and my friend had the skate.  Both entrees were delicious, but the skate was the stronger dish.  Flaky, buttery, tender, umph.  We shared the chocolate puff pastry for dessert; once again it was good, but nothing special.Our server was adorable and helpful and oh-so-French!  I'd definitely love to come back and try the other entrees, which looked extremely appetizing.BYO = awesome.  Good food for about 40$ each = awesome.  La Sirene = awesome.  Just for thoroughness, no American Express cards are accepted.",2,2,2,Deborah H.,"Boston, MA",246,720,0
5.0,1/6/2008,"I finally made it to La Sirene, after literally months of wanting to check it out. We went on a Saturday night (if I remember well) without a reservation, and the place was packed. We got really lucky as a table of four had just become available, so we only had to wait for a couple of minutes. It's really cramped and cozy in there (think Ivo & Lulu, which is just next door), but it was a very pleasant evening. The cuisine is French and mainly seafood. We shared a bunch of things: we started with the moules provencales (steamed mussels with tomatoes, garlic, white wine, etc: very tasty!) together with the sauteed duck liver salad, which was also excellent (and interesting enough it was real duck liver, not pate). We then had the whole roasted fish of the day: sea bass, which indeed came whole with the head and everything else as expected (the best to prepare fish if you ask me): it was great. We also tried the seared duck breast and it was just as good as the rest.Great food, BYOB, very friendly service (Didier, the owner and chef, took the time to come to our table and chat with us), all for very reasonable prices... what more do you need?",8,1,6,David S.,"San Diego, CA",302,653,282
5.0,1/3/2008,"The place f*ing rocked!  After a long day of shopping in SOHO, walk a couple of blocks towards the Spring St station.  We got the last two seats in the place at 6:45pm and was able to order the prixe fix.  For $25, I got an awesome Calamari appetizer, incredible Mussel Provincial,  a great chocolate mousse, and a free half bottle of Sonoma white wine.  For another $25 she got, a nice salad, a dense Lamb stew with white beans, and another great chocolate mousse.The chef/owner came over to check on us and take our plates.  The hostess, Kris made sure that we were always ok.  I'm usually pretty cheap about tipping, but I felt  giving them 30% was fair.Will definitely  go back again with friends since we talked about what a great  meal that was all the way home.",3,1,2,choad x.,"Wasilla, AK",2,139,0
5.0,12/10/2007,"Cute and cozy and a great spot for a small group or for a date.  The $25 prix-fixe deal is awesome - but it's only until 7 pm.  One of the entree choices is mussels in one of five different broths.  We tried 4 of the 5, including one with curry, which was unusual but very delish.The icing on the cake here is the BYOB.  Bring a few bottles, and they're happy to accommodate.That's another thing - service was fantastic - the perfect combination of helpful, friendly and personal without being annoying.  Fun fact - La Sirene is now on OpenTable, a big plus in my book.",1,0,0,Vanessa S.,"New York, NY",12,28,1
5.0,11/26/2007,"This place was great!  Bring your own wine, as they don't carry any at all.  There is no corkage fee.The place is small.  Maybe room for eight groups of 3 or 4 at the most.  We made reservations for 7 o'clock and I'm glad we did because about 30 people showed up after us.  With reservations we sat down right away (the place was already about 80% percent full).  However, even without reservations, the chef and waitress were very accommodating.  The food was just awesome!  It's a seafood restaurant, for the most part.  I went here on Thanksgiving and they had a turkey dish.  Wow! What can I say?  The French know their sauces.With the size of the place and being very busy, the experience could have been pretty bad (I've seen it before).  Luckily, we weren't in any kind of hurry at all and the waitress and the rest of the staff appeared very calm and on top of things the whole time.  Calm, pleasant and very busy.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant, if you bring your own wine.",2,0,1,David D M.,"San Francisco, CA",57,67,27

5.0,9/17/2007,"While visiting from SF a few weekends ago, I heard from a friend about Ivo & Lulu, the quaint but more well known neighbor with the same address.   I was attracted by the no corkage fee at Ivo & Lulu and I wanted to try something I can't get at home in CA, decently priced small French restaurant with good eats.  After a 20 minute subway ride and getting lost on the walk over, we saw that Ivo & Lulu was closed.  I suppose that's the main downside with these tiny joints, they close whenever they feel like it and you're stuck there looking for the next best alternative nearby.  Luckily right next door is La Sirene.  The entire place probably seats 20 at the most.  The owner was extremely friendly and took time to explain the menu and even told us what was good and what wasn't.  I respect it greatly when waiters/waitresses tell you what's not good so we avoid them.  Instead, most end up telling you everything is good when you ask about a particular item.  Not helpful.  Anyways, we ended up going for the prix fixe which is a three courser for $18.  Great value!  I had the mussels and my girlfriend had the seafood shepherd's pie.  They were both off the hinges.  The owner even hooked us up with a free bottle of wine that some customers left there from earlier in the day.  They aren't allowed to sell liquor but BYOB with no corkage more than makes up for that.  Since I'm not from NYC, I don't know much about the French food scene, or the food scene at all, but I have a feeling this will be the next word of mouth place to be.  The owner was telling us they just opened in May so still very new.  I still wanna check out Ivo & Lulu sometime, but this was definitely one of those positives that come from negatives (damn Ivo & Lulu being closed when that was the main restaurant I was looking forward to that trip).",3,0,1,Law C.,"San Francisco, CA",101,129,10
5.0,6/19/2007,"When I ate here, I ate so much I almost threw up.I chose to go with the prixe fix because it had their house specialty, a vegetables and seafood shephard's pie and came with an appetizer and coffee or tea. The pie was awesome--great potato to seafood ratio and the potatoes were super creamy and cheesy. I could only eat half of it, but I had the other half the next day and it was still awesome. As for the crabcakes, I'm not usually into them, but have enjoyed them at times, and I wasn't disappointed by them at all. They reminded me of my mom's Korean cooking (oddly) and were quite yummy. The flavor of the pie was similar to the flavor of the butternut squash at ivo and lulu, but of course different because it had seafood...Anyhow, I was just sad I couldn't eat more. The atmosphere is relaxed and the coffee came in a pot! Didier, the owner and chef, is quite friendly and very helpful in navigating the menu, which is considerably large compared to the restaurants next door.I almost wish I wasn't moving out of NYC for a year.",2,0,1,Erin K.,"New York, NY",12,165,3
5.0,6/16/2007,"my date and i were looking for a BYOB place and came across this pleasant little french seafood bistro near the holland tunnel. we were the first customers on a slow friday and were greeted enthusiastically by Didier, the proprietor. we had heard some good things about the place and were looking forward to a great meal. we had some difficulty deciding on what to eat because so many items on the menu sounded so enticing. Didier was super friendly and helpful in describing the dishes and making recommendations. in the end, we followed his advice and was not disappointed.for appetizers, we started with crab cakes and mussels provencales. the crab cakes were good and the mussels were great. the white wine sauce was delicious and maybe too much so because my date and i wound up dipping countless pieces of bread into it to sop it up. it was so good....for our main course, we went with Didier's recommendation of the sea shepard's pie and the hangar steak. the sea shepard's pie was very good but i was enjoying the hangar steak too much to eat too much of the pie. the steak was tender, cooked medium rare and sprinkled with roasted garlic and parsley. the roasted garlic was perfect, toasted to a nice crunchiness without being burnt. it added a very nice touch to a delicious steak.dessert was also great. strawberries and cream but by then, my date and i were way too stuffed to be able to finish it. i'm not normally a fan of fruit and creme desserts but it was excellent.service was attentive, which was not surprising since we were the only customers for half our meal. the place is very friendly and Didier was a fantastic host. the food was excellent and at very reasonable prices. the prix fixe dinner was only $19.95. hard to beat that price given the quality of the food.if you are looking for a BYOB place or just a nice french bistro with great food at an affordable price, you must try la sirene!",3,0,2,M L.,"New York, NY",26,102,0
