2.0,12/18/2018,I bought some Holiday cards from this store. The cards are very poor quality. They are cut unevenly and not folded properly.

3.0,11/28/2018,"I'm torn about this place. On one hand, it's a diy crafter's dream store  - tons of bits and bobs for a Halloween costume, a sewing project, or random adventure requiring a rainbow assortment of beads, glitter or artificial flowers.  It really is my happy place.  However, their online pickup system needs fine tuning.  The pickup location within the store is not clear (and different from what is stated in the confirmation). Often short staffed (not just this location), store pickup requires several attempts and many minutes for retrieval of the purchased product.  The customer service rep lady asked my name, disappeared into the back, returned and asked me to describe the purchase, and disappeared again.  It was a similar pattern with other customers.  Eventually, I got my package, but i think I may go elsewhere next time.",1,0,1,Kayo N.,"Brooklyn, NY",164,367,139

3.0,11/10/2018,"Deceptively large inside, while not as large as many of its suburban counterparts, this Michael's carries the a good selection of arts and crafts items for your DIY and decorating needs. They have everything from fabric/faux plants, vases and baskets, photo frames and wall decor, various types of paper and scrapbooking items, invitations and cards, wedding decorations, wood crafting yarns, ribbons and felts, beads and jewelry supplies, paints and canvases, assorted bakeware and door decor, and seasonal holiday items, .... the list goes on. Store presentation and layout is pretty good, they generally put all similar types of items together. but there are small pockets of areas where I wished were easier to find, for example the fine tip pens would be easier to find if placed closer to stationary, and in my mind the party supplies (bags and decorations) work better closer to the party signs and invitations. Of course there is some restriction due to how the dimensions of each area are laid out, but those are my thoughts.

So apparently you have to get those from the store on the specific michaels bucks days. Well Edwin located Bruny who then searched the store for one literally in the garbage pail so that i could get my discount. They saved me money, were funny, personable and catering. There customer service and team work were beyond phenomenal.  I even went to the Manager before leaving.  I hope they see my review as i told them i would let everyone know about my awesome experience.

I told her what the guy told me the day before, but she didn't seem to care much. I took my frames elsewhere. Somewhere that honored their quote. Michael's price is ridiculous for a piece of glass.

5.0,5/30/2018,"I love love Michael's!!! I chanced upon this store from hanging out in the area and love the art stuff. It is perfect for buying birthday gifts for kids of all ages, artists, and buying arts and crafts supplies. My kids had a performance and at the last minute, literally the night before, told me they want to do costumes since their friend was going to have one. I called the store and asked them what I need for the costumes and they gave me ideas and a run-down of what they had in the store. So what they didn't have I got from a retail store (hoodie) and went here at 9pm. I found so many many things, and it was amazing that Michael's is one of the few stores that are open late. Anyway, I stocked up and went home, and when one idea didn't work out another one did and my kids woke up to amazing costumes!! I also stocked up on grab & go $1 things to take to restaurants to keep my kids busy while we wait for food. And I found some really cool robot projects. I love love love Michael's and my kids would not have had costumes had it not been for this super helpful store. And they have truly amazing stuff that you just can't find elsewhere.

3.0,5/7/2018,"A tough review to write, but here goes... PRO: You save money.  2 weeks to frame a concert poster. Nothing special. Just frame the sucker. The women I dealt with in the framing department were terrific. One was clearly the manager or supervisor of framing and she was great. But the first woman I spoke to didn't explain the 14 day wait--or the reason for the wait: they do not keep the framing materials on hand. A friend suggested this might be to save space. But this is a huge store and there is a back area devoted entirely to framing. I don't know why they don't keep the frames onsite. Maybe they offer so many options that they would prefer not to buy the materials? I have no idea but it's a mess. CONS: It takes two weeks. See above. But the cons go beyond that.... IT TAKES 20 MINUTES to get to a human  being. I have screen shots of my call log today. The hold time averages 15 minutes. And when you finally do get to a human who knows her stuff, the phone goes dead. It would be quicker to take the F train from 63/Lex to Chelsea and back again than it would be just to find out whether or not your order is ready. Once it's in the store, they will rush it (particularly since I was never informed of this ridiculous lag time). As for cost, 18 x 24 was 157. That would have been 300 or 275 at a mom and pop store. My 8.5 x 11 sheet music would have been 125 but for the 25 off yelp. And that's tiny by comparison to 14 x 24 poster in 18 x 24 frame. The lady on the phone, well, the last one I dealt with was dismissive: ""I'm on the register so I can't take your phone number."" Huh? ""Are you telling me that it's normal to spend hours on the phone just waiting for a human in framing to answer the phone, and that there is not a single human being in the entire facility who is capable of writing down a phone number? Really?"" ""You want to talk to someone else?"" Uh, yeah. Someone else would be better than remaining on the phone with you, who has flat out told me you do not intend to write down my phone number. A guy comes on the phone to tell me he will check on the status of my order. He does. It's finished. (I got a call while at nails but unable to pick up.) I'm grateful that they rushed it. If I'd been content to wait for one of the bigger daily sales, I might have gotten it for 100 not 160. But given the wait time, I'm glad I decided to spend the money. If I were someone to whom an extra 100 or 150 were of no consequence, I'd *never* frame anything here. For one thing, it's a chain and I try to support local business. For another, I like my UES frame shop uptown. I didn't bother to price it up there and they do work with you, particularly if they know you're going to cheap out and go to a chain store. It's competitive, the framing business, because there are so many of these shops in a city where people have money and buy art.

5.0,2/23/2018,"This is my favorite Michael's location. Im currently doing a project so Ive been in a Michaels almost every other day for the last 2 weeks. Each time the staff has been engaging, helpful and amazing...and today was no exception. Latriece saw me wielding a rather large cumbersome frame while trying to manuever the aisles and she approached me and offered her assistance. I'd seen her cheerfully helping various customers locate specific items and she was remarkable. Latriece's knowledge of the store's planogram was impressive. The way she multitasks is both efficient and seemless...and always with a smile. I failed to get the name of the lady who cashed me out on register 5, but she, too, was friendly, engaging and extremely helpful. I was allowed access to a classroom so I could wrap my purchases in an extra layer of protection for my trecherous solo subway ride home with my unwieldly frame. Evan from the frame shop was extremely informative and knowledgeable as well and took the time to answer my many many questions.

1.0,9/24/2017,"Yesterday 9/23/17 was their fall wreathe decor . I was like 10 mins late, when I got there it was only the instructor in there making the demo wreathe so I asked her what should I do? online it says purchase the wreathe and materials are free provided by Michaels. So the instructor told me to buy the wreathe upstairs first and return to the room and we can start. I bought my daughter with me cause it says kids can make a hand print wreathe for free so while I am decorating the wreathe she's busy making her wreathe . More people joined the class they were late but the instructor was nice enough didn't turn them away, I mean like an hour late, not like a few mins late . The instructor is smart,  people who come to the class are buying the wreathe from Michaels that means business for Michaels.My daughter and I enjoyed the class mostly cause the instructor was nice, friendly and helpful. Thumbs up for the instructor that did the ""make a autumn wreathe"" class.Today I asked my daughter if she want to go back to make a floral pumpkin, since we both enjoyed the class from Saturday I figured It will be nice to go to Michaels for the ""make a floral pumpkin "" class. I was WRONG so I was 45 mins late to class because the atlantic ave street fair was held today the whole Atlantic ave was blocked off so I had to walk extra blocks with my 3 year old daughter since the bus didn't stop in front of Michaels. Not knowing today's instructor is Not the same as the one from yesterday, I just hurried and went to purchase the pumpkins, I purchased three, two small ones  and one medium size total $21.00 . When I got to the class room  i asked can I decorate it now I just bought my pumpkins, the instructor was like ""excuse me we started an hour ago"" I was like so I can't decorate it ? Then she goes let me ask my manager if it's ok for u to start now, and the manager said it's ok as long as they finish at 3. I was 45 mins late. The class is from 1:00-3:00. Yesterday a few people walked in at like  2:00 the instructor from yesterday didn't turn anyone away.Todays instructor  told me ok I have to go with u to pick out the flowers upstairs and she asked me how many pumpkins I have so I told her three and I purchased it already,  she said I don't think u have enough time to make three, I am like ok so how many u think I can make in two hours ? She said probably two? She specifically said because Michaels only provide the material for the person who's here making it.Online it doesn't specifically say one per person besides I paid for the pumpkins not like I got it for free it's up to me how much time I need to make each one ? I mean if it's really one per person then please specify it online. When I was decorating the pumpkin I overheard the instructor saying to one of the student about how people come and think it's all free material provided by Michaels so they tell everyone to come like their family, like wtf ?!?! Did I not pay for the pumpkins?? Basically saying cheap people coming here cause they think all this is free. Like she owns the store ? I mean obviously Michaels offer classes like these because it's part of marketing, people come and if they are interested they will buy more to make it at home themselves not to mention I spent $21.00 on fake pumpkins. I also ended up buying a few  arts and crafts items for my daughter yesterday but no not today i went to return one of the pumpkin since it's ""one per person"". When the other students were done making their floral pumpkin, I heard the instructor telling the students to go pay for the pumpkin after they finished making their floral pumpkin. I asked the instructor how does it work should I buy the material first or should I pick it and bring into the class first ? Cause I told her yesterday's instructor told me to buy it first, she goes every instructor is different. Lol I guess since she feel like people can cut and put stuff in the pumpkin before purchasing it? Lol what if some people made it and don't like it and don't pay for it ? And they just walk out ? I mean all the  students did was took the pumpkin's tag and walked out the class room to pay for it at the register and left the pumpkin in the class room ? My daughter and I finished making the floral pumpkin around 2:40. We walked out and said thank you. When I walked by I saw a lady who just started making the pumpkin like wtf it's 2:45 how can she have time to finish and the instructor let her in ? Not to mention the instructor was already cleaning the table and sweeping the floor.Had a real bad experience  at Michaels class today.

When I went back the second time thinking the reframing was ready I spoke to the manager, Carrie Theuring, who was beyond sweet, knowledgeable and understanding. She checked to see when the mattes were being delivered and gave me an ETA when they would be done and that she personally would reframe the 2 photographs for me. Not only did she do a great job but I got a call from her to tell me when she was going to work on them and when the photographs would be ready to be picked up.

I wasn't looking at her at the moment so she made this super annoyed face and said - you! Come! I am sorry, but I find her customer service skills to be very inferior and she does not qualify for this primitive job. More training and supervision needs to be implemented. The lady, who looked like a manager was walking around and even seeing two girls chat and a line of 5 customers, did not make any attempt to fix the situation. Faces are blatant and indifferent! Also, supplies were much more deficient than in other locations. Tags and promos were not advertised appropriately. I believe this store has a good potential, as location is wonderful.

4.0,12/14/2016,This review is LONG over due! -This is a great addition to the downtown area. I love everything about Micheal's and this location is no different. The last visit I came with my friend in order to purchase decorations for her engagement party We had 3 carts of stuff and every coupon you can imagine. We were that obnoxious group of people holding up the line. However our cashier (So sorry I don't remember your name!) was wonderful. He was nice and extremely patient with us. Even after splitting the purchase into multiple purchases ( YES we were doing the absolute most) I really appreciated his humor and general disposition. It is very easy to get frustrated in situations like that with customers like us. Subsequently I have been back since and had much worst service with 1 or 2 items but hey you can't win them all right?,1,1,1,Wanda W.,"Brooklyn, NY",313,284,834
5.0,12/8/2016,"It's a been a few years since this location opened and it has proven to be a go-to for emergency craft projects and terrarium supplies. This location is pretty big as it's in the lower area of a building. I'm a big fan of their baking, glass, and frame sections which all offer a variety of prices. They also surprising have a big candy collection (this is located near the cash register).The baking section which I frequent is separated in its own room, you can buy molds, icing, and decorations. This location also offers creative classes. You have to register for the classes online but the choices are usually painting, and knitting. Oh I forgot to mention the wide variety of adult coloring books. The books here are even cheaper than some sold on Amazon so if you are into that sort of stuff you can come here for the adult coloring books, markers, crayons and whatever other creative supplies you'll need. The staff can be helpful at times but as I do anywhere I research items before going into buy supplies. MICHAEL'S PRO TIP: Sign up for the newsletter. They offer coupons every single week. Once you register for the newsletter you'll receive emails indicating what coupons are available for the week.

After what seemed like an eternity of waiting in line, I approached my cashier. He didn't say hello to me, nothing, as he was too engrossed in his conversation with his coworkers. He rang up my order and after I gave him my coupon, he stood there, still chatting with his buddies. He didn't relay to me the amount due (ie: ""Okay, that'll be $20, cash or card? Okay, swipe your card to the left there, thanks"") so I'm standing there like, um, with my card in my hand. I finally hand it to him, he looks at it and goes, ""over there!""

4.0,11/21/2016,"Craft stores are enrichment centers for me, places where I can browse for things to stimulate my mind and artistic bent. This Michael's, larger than the Chelsea location, has the same chaotic ambience I've noticed at most Michael's. Products always seem to be in slight disarray, and the lines always seem endless and slow. I try to go at off hours whenever possible, so I don't need to read a novel while waiting to buy my goods. If you have an idea what you want, Michaels can be a great place to snag craft supplies. Floor staff here seemed nonexistent when I entered so maybe they were all working the cashiers. Browsing after a while may give you a headache during busy times. Post holidays, the sales can be phenomenal. Sales on seasonal florals are also steep. The two floors enable this store to have more stock than the Manhattan ones, and seem less cluttered. Knitters should note that the yarn and needles they carry will be more pedestrian; nothing wrong with that unless you want to knit only in high end yarns and with Addi Turbos. Coupons tend to be more generous in amount here than at the Manhattan location(Manhattanites are discriminated constantly against at Michaels! Suburban stores have the 50% off coupons.

They also have a crafting space that was in use with a children's party when I got there which is nice to see.I went upstairs and got a couple balls of yarns and some knitting needles. They have nice sales and deals if you look around, definitely worth roaming the aisles to make sure you don't miss anything. And make sure to keep your receipts, they usually provide coupons at checkout.The only flaw was that I arrived on a cloudy Saturday and it was pretty busy.

Little to eye contact was made by them. They weren't busy, and my questions were fairly simple. For example, ""where might I find the drawing books?"".  The whole trip ended at the checkout where a very unpleasant young lady tossed all of my items (over 160$ worth of supplies) into a few bags without any regard for their weight or shape. ""May I use this coupon?"" I asked her. ""No, and I'm not willing to share my coupon either"" she said, whatever that meant. She didn't ask around, she barely glanced at the coupon, and once again, no eye contact was made.I can't understand how, in America, where customer service is valued deeply, this kind of crap can be pulled.

I patiently waited for her to finish. Then, after finishing answering the question of her colleague, she turned and offered her assistance to another customer and walked away in order to help them. I was left standing there, looking confused, as I was a bit surprised that she would walk away from one customer, in the middle of a conversation, to help someone else. After several minutes of me standing there, she returned and I asked her, ""I'm sorry - were you done helping me? Because I'm pretty sure I was here **before** the person you're now helping.""

She suggested I paint it and gave me direction on what supplies to use. I never would have thought of that. She had a lot of knowledge. I was explaining my vision and I got emotional. Now generally, this would be awkward, but she gave me a hug and was a mini counselor for me. I'm so happy and satisfied with all my purchases. When I checked out, the cashier found me a coupon for 40% off. Companies get mad when associates do that but you know what? That's more of an incentive to come back and spend money on top of the brand loyalty I already have.I must have spoken to 6 associates there and they all have exemplary customer service.

I am giving this 5 stars because of one incredible woman who helped me out in the custom framing department back in February. I was having my very first solo exhibition, and I had no idea what I was doing with framing. Brianna, (I believe her name is,) spent about 45 minutes helping me choose frames for a few of my pieces. I received a phone call a few days later that one of my larger paintings was chipping, (I had not sealed it enough,) and I was nothing less than freaking out. I rushed down to Michaels and Brianna took the painting out of the frame, brought it into the back, and put another coat on for me. It needed more than one coat and she told me that I could leave, and that she would continue putting on more coats throughout the day. I couldn't believe it. I had another issue with a painting a few weeks later, and Brianna took it out of the frame and let me take it home to fix it.

4.0,3/24/2015,"Michael's is the suburban arts and craft big box store that has pretty much everything you need for small or generic projects. They have great inventory and layout, and I can happily peruse in here for an hour or two. I find that their pricing is usually a few bucks cheaper than the specialty store and they keep a large and wide inventory of products. However, if you're an expert, the quality of products may be better at college affiliated or specialty stores. Michael's is also the most kid friendly of the art stores, with several aisles dedicated to children's supplies, kits, and characters.I've purchased frames, beads, cake decorations, stationary, sketch pads, play dough, gift wrap, scrapbooking supplies, pencils, and even my Christmas tree here. As long as its a generic item, you should be able to get it here. They also have the long racks of cheap $1 items like fun notepads, pens, cards, containers, soaps, gift bags, cupcake liners, candy, etc, that make awesome/terrible spontaneous purchases.Checkout lines tend to be long here on weeknights after work, although the many cashiers work pretty hard to keep crowds to a minimum. It can be hard to find staff on the floor so be patient if you need help or call before you arrive. But since they keep pretty long hours compared to the specialty stores, its worth it. The worst thing about this location is that it is in the basement, so if you need to have a phone call down here to talk specifics with someone, that may be really hard.

The store layout is horrible. Some aisles are wide while the one right next to it is narrow.

5.0,8/5/2014,"No more trekking up to Columbus Ave for a Michaels store because this one is right in the heart of the Chelsea area. Perfect location for budding artists and designers who populate this area. I think the local favorite Paper Presentation is going to take hit but I have no complains. I can finally afford simple craft items like paper, glue, and ribbons at Michaels that won't cost an arm and a leg that Paper Presentation charges. The only thing I wish Michael sold is crepe tissue paper, which I have been using to make paper flowers.",1,0,0,Rowena Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",480,1179,549
5.0,7/26/2014,Finally a Michaels in lower Manhattan!Super friendly and helpful staff in the custom framing section. They made good recommendations and used awesome tech to give us a visual image on how the finished project would look. They gave us various options that allowed us to get to a price point we were comfortable with. Turn around time for custom framing is about 2 weeks and that's fine with us as we're in no rush. We patiently wait for the final product!,1,0,0,Anna L.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",96,68,70
5.0,7/22/2014,"Thank you Michaels for popping into the Chelsea area! Now I don't have to trek uptown or into the outer boroughs to get my art goodies!!!Just because it's located on the basement level, don't let that fool you. The store is ginormous. And the layout is very organized. Thank thy lord!!!My only complaint would probably be the line for the registers. Apparently you have to get around part of the building structure to get onto a line. Hard to explain but you'll understand it when you see it.",3,0,0,Olivia S.,"New York, NY",656,607,1036
4.0,7/20/2014,"This is the newest Michael's to the city! Today was the Grand Opening and since I am in need of some art supplies, I made my way here before my yoga class. The whole store is housed in the basement. You can find a lot in here. I am trying to make a blue-spirit animal costume and I need to be creative and Michael's helps to fuel that need. I am making a peacock headdress and I was able to find headbands (which you can decorate). I also found that all the plastic flower arrangements will be perfect for the headdress. I got a few that had blue in it and also peacock feathers! In addition, they have every single possible glue guns on sale here. You can find glitter, sequins, jewels, fabric and feathers. I wouldn't come here if you need fabric (go to Garment District). But you can find your basic here, and for reasonable prices. I was able to purchase some blue felt, different color feathers, sequins, glue gun, glue for the gun all for $30. Now my costume is almost done, just need a few more touches and all set. Thanks Michael's for getting the creative juices going!",10,7,9,Vivian H.,"Chinle, AZ",1076,1950,46
