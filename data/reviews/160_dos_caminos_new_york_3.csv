3.0,4/28/2019,"We celebrated a birthday here with a group of 14 people. We did a preset package with premium 2 hour open bar and then ordered taco platters and guacamole. The total with tax and tip came to about $85/person. For the drink service, the waiters left pitchers of the non-premium margaritas on the table. We had paid a good deal extra so that everyone could order any drink off the menu. However, they didn't leave the menus on the table and never took drink orders. Finally, I had to get up and request a few specialty margaritas halfway through dinner. By the way, the standard el Camino margarita really tastes very sweet and sour -like a mix/hangover. That's why we ordered premium.For the food, the guacamole and tacos were good and tasty but everyone left hungry. Maybe we should have ordered more than 3-4 tacos per a person because they are on the smaller side.For the service, this was the worst part. We had open bar so we should have had a waiter dedicated to our table. Waiter service was very spotty and slow. We had to continually request a waiter at our table. I guess slow service is what happens when you have a large group and guarantee 18% gratuity plus 4% service charge, regardless of your experience.In total, I don't recommend Dos Caminos for large groups. We did appreciate that we could go downstairs to Troys after, but the dinner experience was really below the level of service expected. Had anyone asked about my experience from the restaurant I probably wouldn't have left this review, but it seemed nobody cared to follow up.",0,0,0,Kelli D.,"Manhattan, NY",193,21,0
4.0,4/16/2019,"This past Saturday was a day made in heaven in the Meatpacking district... one of the most beautiful spring days I've seen in a long time.. Sunny and 78 degrees with a gentle breeze... the only thing that could make it better was a banging inexpensive meal with my girlfriends (oh and the bottomless mimosas).. And Dos Caminos delivered!When we went to make a reservation online, we were told there were no available seats, but since we were literally right next door at the Gansevoort, we decided to walk over and try our luck. It paid off as we were able to have a seat outside to people watch while we ate!Jessie was very friendly and accommodating. She's of great value to the establishment. We ordered the bottomless drinks with brunch.. I tried the prickly pear margarita which was disappointingly sour and not really good, unfortunately... mimosas had a solid amount of bubbly in it. But, the real hit was the food!!Oh so tasty... great guacamole... empanadas de platanos were divine!! stuffed plantains, guys!! The queso fundidos were just rich and decadently salty... I ordered the smoked salmon and avocado benedict... eggs benedict on cornbread!!!! YES!Literally everything I tasted was a party in my mouth.Can't wait to return!",6,3,4,Latoya G.,"East Brunswick, NJ",344,328,377

We were seated up stairs, where, I think they ""forget"" about you. We sat there for almost 15 mins before our waitress came over. She seemed like she didn't want to be there. She was never around. We had to ask for water, chips and salsa. We ordered. I was not thrilled with my order of enchiladas de queso. When the plate was brought to me, I was kind of shocked at the presentation. The flavor was lacking as well. My husband ordered the naked grilled fish tacos. No one ever filled my water glass.

I really enjoyed it!We got guac and chips and salsa to start for the table and the guac was super fresh and delicious! I got the naked taco which was awesome! Most of us got it and we really enjoyed it. I tried the chicken and the steak and both were delicious.

Ash was our server extraordinaire as we walked in for an early lunch after seeing the Warhol exhibit at the Whitney Museum nearby. We have been Dos Caminos customers for years and have been at all of the NYC locations but this one ! The menu also looked upgraded and the food was delish! We shared a bunch of dishes like the Winter Gem Salad, Cheese enchiladas, street corn and some guac and chips. The adult beverages were also on par as the margaritas were excellent.  If you check in using Yelp you can get a free Prickly Pear shot! I would definitely request Ash as your server. He was very attentive, has a great personality and also made our whole meal that much more enjoyable. Jesus, the manager also came over to say hello and check on our meal. What a well-run restaurant.

So we were standing about in a crowded bar while staff tried to resolve the problem. The solution...was not ideal. They wanted to sit the party in two different tables...yea. Well we crammed in and managed. Fast forward it's been twenty minutes, no water, no chips and salsa. The busser and servers were invisible. Fast forward again we order, the food. Oh boy! Horrible.  The food is dry, lukewarm the dishes sound interesting but the execution was careless and disappointing.Everyone dropped the ball here, host, server, busser, kitchen...Now besides all this mess. This location has a basement bar. Apparently, after we dined at the restaurant if we wished to enter the bar located in the same place, we would then be required to leave enter through a side door and pay a $20 cover!!!What on earth!!??!!  Yea, there are plenty of options in this town, avoid this place.",0,0,0,Paulino F.,"New York, NY",22,21,38

This employee took it way to far and that is all I will say.As we ate, another employee decided to openly mock and harass my bartender about the way he spoke.

1.0,10/7/2018,"Im very surprised at how this staff works. Especially because of its location in the Chelsea Area. Honestly from the moment I walked in i had a bad feeling, me and my friend sat outside and it took a while for the Waitress to even come up to our table to introduce herself. Second The food wasn't even that great and The worst part is when The bill came not only did she take long for us to be able to pay but when we did pay I specifically asked her to split the payment half on card and half cash. I was the one who paid cash the bill was $64 and some change my friend paid with her card and I told The waitress to put 30 on her card and charge the rest to my cash..I gave that waitress a$100 bill !!!! When she finally took our payment it took 15 minutes just to get our receipt!!!!! when she finally came back me and my friend were in such a rush to get out of there i didn't realize she gave me the wrong change. THIS WOMAN GAVE ME BACK $33!!! From the 100 i gave her not realizing that I didn't have the right change till I got home. Now I'm not the greatest at math but I'm pretty sure I should've at least gotten a 50 back....We should've known she would've made a huge mistake when she started making mistakes to the table in front of us. Plus the staff isnt professional and they all seem not to be paying attention to anything. This was the worst I've ever experienced at a restaurant I never thought I would experience something like this especially in the Chelsea area I called the store as soon as I got home the person who answered the phone said she would call me back and never did even if the waitresses box wasn't over at least give me a call to let me know what happened.

I would have taken pics but i just wanted to get out of there. There were two other ladies with me in the bathroom and they complained about the same thing. Someone should be checking on the bathroom because that unacceptable and unsanitary. Literally all 3 stalls had blood on the toilet seats and on the floor. And on the walls. How sway? The walls tho.. and there were 2 dead waterbugs on the floor as well, on of the ladies stepped on it by mistake and the crunch sound made her freak out  it's not funny but better her than me..

I explained what happened and he said, ""oh yeah that's right, that's my fault, I.. i..."" I looked at him and said ""you gave our table away?!"" And he said ""yes and now the wait is 20 minutes.""

Our waitress, Allyson, was awesome and came over right away to take our orders. My sister had a passion fruit margarita which was good but very very sour, and I had a blackberry ginger margarita which I loved - kinda pricey at $17 though. We ordered guac for the table which unfortunately came after our entrees. Our waitress apologized for the lateness and told us there was only one person making them in the back. I would've forgiven that had it not been super bland in flavor. We asked for it medium but it was def. missing a lot of salt, lime and spice. Our entrees were a different story, they were amaaaazing. My sister got the sizzling arrachera which was basically a fajita - included skirt steak, caramelized onions, peppers, guac, rice and tortillas. Even the rice was finger licking good! I got the baja surf and turf tacos which had skirt steak, beer battered shrimp, a chipotle aioli and bacon guac - my steak was a little chewy but they were delicious nonetheless.

Food: My dish was adorned with quinoa, avocado, pickled vegetables, arugula, black beans, and corn. The meal overall was extremely flavorful, and the meat was very tender. My friend's dish came with 2 enchiladas and a bowl of rice and beans. The enchiladas were very flavorful, but I thought the rice and beans were lacking. (I give the rice and beans a 2 out of 5.

Really? I gave him one last chance and said 'so, let me get this straight- you're going to turn down my money and send me off to spend it at another restaurant while you have a ton of available tables and no wait or anything?' He said 'yeah, sorry.'No buddy, you're going to be the sorry one when you go out of business and lose your job for thinking you're too cool for school and can just turn business away.

We arrived early (at 7.45) for an 8pm reservation. That was lucky because it took 15 minutes for anyone to come and take our order once we were finally seated. A waitress arrived instantaneously delivering food we did not order and didn't seem terribly interested that we were baffled. After managing that error, the correct order arrived quite quickly and was delicious but then at 8.28 we were quite rudely advised by the BOSS MAN that we had to leave the table immediately because the next seating was there. We had not been advised prior to sitting down that we only had the table for 28minutes. Surely that would have been a really helpful tidbit of information, In fact so helpful we would have left after 10 minutes of waiting to place a drink order.

Was not impressed with the chorizo -- not sure what I was expecting but it was literally just  a plate of melted cheese. It was really heavy and needed something to balance it out.

You know customary for a restaurant. Instead we got drinks under the assumption we'd be seated soon to only find out the hostess forgot us (despite us sitting in plain sight 6 feet away). Then when we asked her she was surprised as if she had no idea who we were and said ""Oh I'll ask to see if we can find something"" as 10 minutes go by and I see her twiddle her thumbs doing nothing.

I will say I came with a big party (a little over 10), But we had reservations + were on time + seated promptly, so that wasn't really the issue.Ordered multiple guacamole for the table, which took a bit of time to come. Was good and fresh and probably the highlight.Vast majority of us took advantage of the bottomless addition to our entree. I like that you can switch up the drink choices, because I started with sparkling wine and it was absolutely disgusting! A weird sweet tart bitter strange combo. Had a few others try it and they all agreed it belongs in the trash. Went with frozen margarita for the rest of the brunch. That was fine...I got the breakfast quesadilla, which was not even remotely worth 17 bucks. It was fine tasting, but something hungover me could have thrown together earlier that morning with lackluster ingredients. Ultimate reason I deducted so many stars is because service was just horrible. So long to get drink refills, so long to get someone to take our order, so long for the food to be cleared, then so long for the check to come and then so long to bring the card back and omg all in all spent ~4 hours in that damn restaurant from start to finish.

Once with a friend for drinks last December and twice for lunch when it was still warm out.I haven't much to say about the time I got drinks, we got margaritas, some free chips (their salsas are yummy), and maybe an hour later we parted ways.My second visit was pleasant, with minor issues. I was drawn in by the outdoor seating (truthfully speaking, my view was of some construction, but it was still nice lol) and my server was prompt. And tall. And sorta handsome. But, he wasn't very engaging, though there when I needed him. I can't remember much about the steak dish that I ordered besides it coming with a lot of sides (I got rice and beans AND a salad??) on my little table and being overcooked. I got well done and not medium. Tsk tsk. When I got it corrected they accidentally bagged it in a to-go bag. Apparently the server misheard, but it wasn't a big deal. I was kind of disappointed overall, but that outdoor seating called to me again and a third visit happened.The third time was much better! I ended up going during restaurant week so I opted for the pre-fixe. Now these dishes I remember! First up were these delicious mussels. Seasoned well with just a tad of heat that would sneak up on you. And the portion was way larger than expected! It would have made a fine main. My actual main was a chicken fried steak torta with fries. Their fries aren't exactly winners, but the torta was! It was more akin to a southern sandwich than a Mexican one, but it was good all the same. For dessert, I got the sorbet which came with cookies. Nice, smooth treat to top it all off.This time my server was more engaging and everything was right. No issues!

It actually had a jam type flavor which must have been the red wine that I loved! We shared the warm and salty tortilla chips with super fresh guac and a few different salsas that ranged from mild to spicy. It was a nice starter. I ordered the sashimi style tuna Ceviche and my boyfriend ordered the Ceviche sampler which included the tuna, lobster and red snapper. I thought my Ceviche was ok but got too spicy and so I didn't finish all my pieces. My boyfriend didn't like the tuna very much. He says overall the red snapper was the best. He liked the lobster sauce (like it was amazing) but said the actual lobster wasn't very good. After we finished I was still hungry! We ended up ordering a couple sides so I felt more satisfied. We ordered the Mac n Chorizo and the plaintains. These were very good! Still thinking about those plaintains! The bottom line is this: the Ceviche was not worth it, we wish we ordered more of the sides. In the end we paid $110 and like many of the reviews said, it felt like we paid way too much for what we got.

1.0,8/27/2017,"One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. From the very beginning just a disaster. We had a reservation for 4pm this past Saturday. A somewhat slowTime at a restaurant due to being between lunch and dinner. We arrive at the restaurant at 4pm prompt with our full party and are told they are cleaning our table so we proceed to wait 5-10 minutes. They then take us to your table upstairs and it's empty. So what exactly was being cleaned there was no one there and why were we waiting ? So they then proceed to take us to a table for 4, however our reservation was for 6 and there were 6 people present in our party. So the hostess then takes us to another table after a short wait and we are now finally seated. The waiter comes over and he is barely audible no one can hear him. Someone at the table asks for juice as he don't drink alcohol and the waiter tells him they don't have any juice. So we all pause for a moment then someone at the table points out they are a full service bar which serve as cocktails margaritas etc and how could they not have juice. The waiter then states oh I'm sorry yes we have juice and names about 7 different juices. First day on the job? Waiter training 101 ? I mean come on. So at this point some people in the party want to leave but we order drinks and decide to stay as we had a time line we had to adhere too. We realized we only have 2 menus at the table we ask for more and the waiter brings over 1 more. So we now have 3 menus with 6 people . The upstairs of the restaurant was empty so I'm not quite sure why we had to ask 3 more times after that to get enough drink and food menus for the table. At this point everyone is confused and we feel we are on candid camera or some other show being pranked. Nonetheless we stay and hope the food makes up for he abysmal service thus far. We were even more disappointed with that. I order the tacos as my entree and was given three tacos. No sides included at all. No rice and beans ... nothing. This was not explained to me or anyone else at the table that the tacos came with no side dishes. The waiter then proceeds to bring out a very small bowl or rice and beans and states ""this is complementary on the house"" . Are you serious ? You provide a dinner entree with no sides and come to the table with a tiny bowl or rice and beans and state it's on the house complimentary hahahaha . What an insult !!

And after the bougie rooftop bar we went to (with overpriced cocktails), we wanted to be able to order a pitcher of sangria to share. We didn't have reservations and luckily walked in and were seated immediately in the outdoor area, which was ideal. FRIENDLY TIP - if you have the Yelp app, you can check in here and get a free prickly pear Margarita - SOO strong but who doesn't love free alcohol (especially in NYC)... We got guac to share and chose spicy and it was VERY spicy, but I guess we can only blame ourselves? We appreciated that the waiter was honest with portion sizes and didn't try to upsell us. The sangria was really good and we got about 6 glasses out of it. I ordered the Mac n chorizo and street corn sides to share as my entree. The Mac n chorizo pasta was slightly overcooked and there wasn't as much chorizo as would've been ideal. But, the Mexican street corn is half the reason I convinced my friends to come here (to die for) and so I was a happy (and buzzed) diner at the end of this experience.

All I was made aware of was the option of these menus, not any other requirements.  The night before the affair, the Maitre D' emailed me to inform me I had to choose a prefix menu ($47-63 per person) or pay a $45 dollar minimum per person (a ridiculous price for a bunch of young 20 year olds).

Do yourself a favor and order a stone bowl (or two, as we did) which comes with freshly made chips. I'm not a Tostito's girl usually, but the warm chips as Dos Caminos were something else altogether. The naked chicken taco bowl was delicious and filling without making me feel like I was destroying my nutrition goals or skimping on flavor. Really on point if you're not looking for a heavy meal but want all of the flavors and ingredients.Drinks-wise, we ordered a pitcher of red wine sangria (delicious), though you have the option to go white as well. My friends who ordered margs loved theirs as well. Drinks can get pricey even for well drinks, so be careful ordering if you're running low.

We had a large party maybe like 12 of us. My friend had 6 of her friends and my sister had 6 of her friends. We had a reservation and was seated as soon as the whole party arrived. We came during HH so we were suppose to get drinks for I believe two hours and it went terrible! They brought us two pitchers for the large party. In the two hours that we spent there we only received 4 pitchers. We were told we were going to get more pitchers since we had a large party and it never came. We order two orders of double gauc ( one for each end of the table) we only received one. We slowly started to realize our table had no utensils, we tried to get one of our two waitress attention and they both ignored us.  I ordered the chicken quesadilla and they forgot my order, a friend and I waited 20mins after everyone else received their food. When my food finally came it was wrong and greasy. One of my friends decided to speak to a manager and she gave us another hr for drinks and said that the bartender was new and that's why each pitcher took forever to come. We told them we were celebrating two birthdays together, they brought us only one cake and forgot the other ( which to be fair its complementary so I'm not complaining, they shared the cake) they brought the second cake once we were paying our bill.SB: I did the yelp check in when I was there and it didn't work, the waitress told me they do not make the prickly pear drink and I couldn't have something else. I know having a large group is hard however, when I go out with large parties we make sure to consolidate everything, so there's no confusion, we usually ask for everyone to order the same things and make sure that we all get the same drinks and try to make it as easy as possible on the people serving us but lord never again they couldn't get it together and we tried to be patient as possible",0,0,0,Fatima K.,"Teaneck, NJ",11,68,64
4.0,6/15/2017,"You'll notice on my Yelp profile that I believe the best time of day is guac-a-clock. Well, at Dos Caminos, it's always guac-a-clock (at least from 11:30am-11:00pm).I came here with my boyfriend on a sweltering summer day, wondering if there would be a table in the shade that could afford us the pleasure of being outside without roasting in the sun. There was a high-top table for 2 that seemed to fit the bill, but ultimately it was just too hot outside. Hmm..I guess that really wasn't pertinent to the review. I will mention, however, that the air conditioning here works phenomenally.This location is no better or worse than any other Dos Caminos, I'd say they run a pretty tight ship as far as quality control is concerned. Tongue-in-cheek mottos aside, you should most definitely ask for some guacamole the second you sit down. My boyfriend wanted extra spicy but I was looking for something more in the medium range. Having nothing to do with chivalry, we opted for the medium because all chips come with three hot sauces spanning the Scoville scale, and you can simply add a couple of drops to your bite to get the kick you desire.There are a number of ceviches available, all of which are great. They're a bit expensive for how much food you get, but delicious nonetheless. My boyfriend got the Baja tacos - grilled skirt steak, tecate battered rock shrimp, sriracha aioli, bacon guacamole - they were absolutely fantastic. My salad was great too, but the tacos are the way to go.They take reservations and are guaranteed to deliver solid food at somewhat-reasonable prices.",1,1,0,Rachael F.,"Manhattan, NY",93,236,46

My wife's chopped salad had 14,000 ingredients and, while we're both adventurous eaters, we were confused and underwhelmed. The $9.50 she spent on the shrimp, making the salad $22.50 were good, but not worth the price. Basically, this place is probably hit or miss and definitely on the pricier end.

Along with my shot, I had a michelada, which is a spicy beer drink concoction that I truly love.My party of two was seated quickly as we beat the rush of after-work crowd that usually culminates this location.  We ordered the traditional guacamole with medium spice (since my partner is not keen on heat), and of course the order comes with three sauces, which go from mild, medium and hot! I always go for the hottest sauces, because I'm such a masochist lol and love feeling the heat in my mouth.  We decided to order from the bocaditos/street food section which is great for sharing and trying a few items.  We went with the avocado ceasar salad with grilled shrimps, the empanadas de platano and the quesadillas potosinas all of which were delicious and very filling, which by the way some went in a doggy bag :).Must say, their food never disappoints and our server was very much present to ensure we didn't lack anything.Until next time, trying a few new dishes at this very popular spot.",1,0,0,Esmeralda C.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",92,382,5470

I prefer margaritas on the rocks, but I got the prickly pear margarita. All I could taste was tequila. The coffee was not great either. The service was the worst. I ordered the coffee when I ordered my meal. Everything else came, but not my coffee, so I asked again. About 5 minutes later, we asked for the third time and our waiter replied very rudely that he wished he could control the bar. Okay? Teddy, the server, was not on top of things. We asked for a dessert menu and decided to order the sorbet. He came by a little while after dropping off the menus, but didn't take our order.

The only thing I gotta give it though is that the guacamole is still amazing as it was when I had it years ago. The frozen margaritas also are still the same and amazing.

Not to mention, this also comes with 3 different types of salsa which NO one is mad about! The market chopped salad is definitely another good option to start. As for tacos, the vegetable and pollo are my go-to. The skirt steak I found to be quite tough and undercooked.

So it's Cinco de Mayo so why not go to a Mexican spot (my coworker's idea). The bar was packed by 3 pm. Okay no problem. I go to the bar with money in hand and no one asks for my drink order. Almost 10 minutes go by before one of the three bartenders askfor my drink order. I get the margarita on the rocks. It's good and strong. It's $9. Okay no problem. I happen to look at my coworker's check from when he bought drinks 15 minutes ago and he was charged $8. So I finish my drink and go for another and I give my credit card and I'm charged $12 for the same drink.  I ask about the change and the bartender says that they usually have happy hour but they aren't having it today so I was supposed to have been charged $12 for my first margarita not the happy hour rate. No bueno! But I'm still down for my crew so I stay and order another margarita and a Modelo beer for my friend. The female bartender gets an attitude because I ask about it being in a glass when the one he's drinking is in a bottle. She  switches it to a bottle still with an attitude. I don't drink beer and know nothing about it so I was just asking why it was in a glass instead of a bottle. I give her my card to pay and she comes back and asks if I have another card. I ask her why and she says my card isn't swiping. I just paid for drinks with the same card less than 30 minutes ago.

1.0,4/16/2017,"Their food sucks and so does their service. If I could give them zero stars I would. My friends and I decided to go here for a quick bite to eat because we were all starving. We put our name down and we were told that the wait would be 30 minutes. We were about to be seated and then all the sudden one of the managers came up to us and told us that he was unable to seat us because our friend was ""extremely intoxicated"" when all she was doing was just standing there, she was not intoxicated at all. Not only was she wrongly accused but they were treating us like actual garbage. If anything, the staff member that had yelled at us was intoxicated because of how out of line he was.  After arguing with the staff for 15 minutes, they finally let us sit. We decided to order some appetizers. We ordered the guacamole and queso; both appetizers were $14. They were extremely small portions and they were not worth $14 whatsoever. I know what real guacamole tastes like and theirs was far from it. After finally being able to eat and calm down from the situation, my other friend asked for a drink menu to which the waitress responded ""I am not allowed to serve you alcohol."" We were furious. How could you refuse service when there was no problem at all? We were just sitting there eating their crappy food like every other customer. It felt as if they were being prejudice against us. After they refused to give us the drink menu, we paid for the food and then asked to speak to the manager again b/c we felt like we deserved an apology. His reasoning did not even make sense and the staff member that had originally accused us was hiding the entire time in the kitchen. We asked to speak to him but he refused to speak to us, probably because he knew he was wrong. They ruined our entire dinner and night. NEVER again will we come here.

I think for a Spanish restaurant they should definitely know how to make margaritas, my second margarita was a regular margarita and it had too much lime in it. The guacamole needed salt, I would never order that again. We ordered the Cobb salad and a grapefruit avocado salad, which I had to return because it was absolutely horrible (it didn't even have a taste to it, and I even asked the waiter what the dressing was) I liked the Cobb salad so much that I ordered one for myself and returned the other salad.

1.0,3/20/2017,"I had a horrible customer service experience. I work with customers and the way the waitress and manager handled me proves to me they need better training. The last time I went was around February and didn't have any problems. I had my food and drinks. My ID expired on January on my birthday. In February no one said anything about expiration date and the drinks were coming. The next time I went it was a whole different story because Instead of the waitress looking at my ID, i mentioned to her it was expired. On Sunday, march 19th 2017, at around 5-6pm my friends and I went into dos caminos restaurant located at the meat packing district by 14th street. Maybe by looking at the schedule you can tell who was the manager on duty and the waitress. We were a big group so it's not like we weren't going to spend money. Everyone was ordering drinks and I had said before taking my ID out that it expired on January but February it was ok because I was getting drinks. Before I even finished my sentence and took my ID out the waitress was quick to reject me and said she can't serve me drinks. I'm telling her my birthdate is there and it shows I'm over 21 and she said she can't do it because it's invalid. She turned and continue to just take orders from my friends. Now I understand the whole expired ID because at my work place we can't accept expired ID but I know there is a way to bypass it. I asked her for the manager. The manager came over and he was also quick to just reject me. I really don't know what the waitress told him but as soon as I said my ID was expired the explanation he gave me was what upset me. No managers should ever tell a customer that anyone that LOOKS 30 and younger needs to show ID. He said this after I told him I'm 29 so it's like he basically threw a number out there to try to make a point but it failed. Drinking age is 21 so why would he have to ask for ID if you ""look"" 30 and younger? It's like saying I can't serve you because u look gay .... IT'S PREJUDICE!!!!! And he wants to tell me by law he can't serve me. ABSOLUTELY NOT! He can't serve me if I were under age but obviously I'm not!  We just got up and left and will never come back to this location. These people have to get it together !!! I know if I didn't mention the expiration, the waitress wouldn't even reject me but because I had mentioned it, i felt like I just wasn't there. If the workers are following this policy religiously then they really have to look at expiration dates and not just judge me by looks! P.S.

We would not have gotten dessert unless it were free. In my opinion, there should have been a price reduction on the meal (perhaps 20% off??).

As we stood close to the cute building with gimmicky picturesque outdoor dining, my soul cringed when he suggested this touristy Tex Mex place, but since he was paying I conceded. Inside Dos Caminos feels new and like a palm tree shaded Spanish villa night party you want to be at.  It's actually cute despite the throngs of desperate out of Towner's hungry for a ""New York"" experience.

Dos Caminos charms unfortunately didn't help the efforts of my proposer, although it was a good attempt.  (I ended up declining after some thought.  After all my friend Yao said in Chinatown you can get 35k for a citizenship marriage, plus it didn't sound like 4 years of fun, not to mention the legal aspects.)Prices are high but you might feel like you're on vacation.  The place is bustling and lively, with the hysteria of marketable capitalism and vacationing materialists looking for a trinket quench.

4.0,10/5/2016,"I had a great dinner here with my husband, following a bike ride down to the city. We rode from Harlem down to the Meatpacking District, looking for some sustenance before the forty minute ride back North. We were literally at the corner, amidst a slew of restaurants so clearly, I Yelped our options and we chose Dos Caminos. We wanted outdoor seating despite the chill so that we could keep all watchful eye on our bikes. We were seated right away and upon checking in, I noticed a deal for a complimentary Prickly Pear Shot. I received a free flute of what tasted like a Margarita bit I'm not complaining. Our very trendy server took our order and I of course, got the Guac, done spicy. I contemplated get the grasshoppers but since there was no option for leftovers to be brought back with us, I just ordered my super fresh salad so that I could ensure that I'd finish everything. I ordered the Grapefruit, Persimmon and Avo Salad which was perfect. I wish it were summer still because this salad is perfect warm-weather food. There were hazelnuts and pomegranate seeds dotting the salad, lending to the texture and I was quite pleased. I wish I could have added a protein, such as shrimp or fish but I never asked if that was an option and I was full after our meal so it hit the spot. Next visit, though, I will have to inquire about that. My guac was great and definitely did not disappoint with the spice factor. It was served with 3 levels of salsa spiciness, all of which were really good. The tortilla chips were fresh and I was quite pleased with all of my food. Hubby had the Asada Soft Tacos with at came with Rice and Beans. The tacos were very good and spicy as well so, if you don't do so well with spice you might want to ask them to turn the heat down a notch. We both ordered Mexican Coffees that were spiked and warmed us right up. The whipped cream on top was a nice touch.

We got the ceviche sampler to start, which consists of a little bit of all three ceviches they have to offer. It was just mediocre. I would've enjoyed it more if the ceviche was a little bit less cooked. The tuna one was my personal favorite! The size of the sampler was also really small. The skirt steak asada was to die for. Both flavored and cooked to perfection! The green sauce that the steak was topped with was the perfect amount of tangy and savory. The asada tacos were also really good!

The tacos were extremely underwhelming, I only got three tiny tacos with ""fresh tortillas"".

The overall taste of the dish was very confusing and overwhelming.I then volunteered to try my fellow diners Cob Salad.

The host service here is terrible - rude and not friendly at all. Both inside and outside, they act like you're bothering them. They seem to throw out random excessive wait times with no thought put into it at all. It's never accurate. I came here once on an unusually cold late spring night for a date and there was only available seating outside. Everyone around me, including myself, was visibly shivering so I asked if we could turn on one of the space heaters. I was told by one of the waitresses rudely, ""oh... well I need to see if we're even allowed"" and walked away. She seemed to act like it was a huge inconvenience. I much preferred to sit outside on each visit to people watch. However, they do have an inside area. Looks nice inside and the bar area is usually quite crowded. I ate in there once and it was too dark to see my plate. Service from the waiters and waitresses have been mixed, but mostly indifferent. They're definitely better than the hosts but I suppose that's because they're directly responsible for tips. More than once, however, it's felt as though my waitress has disappeared from our table for longer-than-necessary periods of time and we had to flag her down just to place our orders.Lastly, the food. I want to love it here because I love Mexican food. However, the value for the price is not there. Last time I was here, I ordered a Bocadito Trio for $19 which contains two pieces each of: chicken taquitos, lobster tostaditos, plantain empanadas. Sounds exciting except that everything was bite sized - and I mean literally the taquitos for the size of my thumbnail. For $19, you could do MUCH better.

This place consistently gives terrible service, aside from [a few] of the hosts. One time I was here on a Monday evening, not busy at all, and our waitress was completely blase about the fact that she was working. She acted as if we were the ones inconveniencing her by being seated in her section, and made us feel completely bothersome. Mind you, this was on my birthday - when I asked if they do anything for birthdays, she begrudgingly said ""yes"" and brought out some dessert thing. no other comment. Fast forward a few months, I venture back here because, to be honest, their food is kinda decent. KINDA. Their salsas blend extremely well together, and their guac is on fleek. They're got a veggie bowl that's so tasty, as well as their [very] buttery cornbread (but, sadly their veggie tacos are NOT good at all, quite boring, in fact). It took so..... long..... to get, well, basically everything except the food. Water, beer, appetizer.

My usual issue with original eggs Benedict is that the English muffin sometimes takes a bit to tear off a piece without spilling everything everywhere, but the cornbread base in this one solves that problem - and soaks up all the extra hollandaise sauce. I don't care for blended margaritas but it came with a bloody mary, which was decent, and the chips were pretty fresh.

We were so confused.  Even then, our drink order was taken and we had to ask for salsa and chips.Overall, the food was good, ambience was nice, but service was all over the place.

The decor is also interesting/nice, brings some calm compared to the craziness outside in the meatpacking district. We ordered guac and chips, so basic!, for an appetizer; the really spicy one too; it tasted really good, but my taste beds were burning for a long time. I would prob get the mild-med spicy next time, still don't regret trying it; they also add different salsas in addition to guauc, some tasted pretty good with the chips As for my main dish, I ordered the Dos Enchiladas it was pretty good but not very filling to be honest. I ended up,as usual,eating from my friends entrees, one got the chicken quesadilla, really good dish and filling too. The other one got tacos, another pretty tasty dish.

3.0,4/24/2016,"My boyfriend and I were quickly seated outdoors, which was preferred because I realized they had heating lamps along each table. I believe this place could be better service wise. I am a lover of authentic cuisine, for appetizers of course we had the guacamole, it was almost a little bit to mushy for my liking but the taste was really good (I like it more chunky with the avocados.) The dos enchiladas were pretty okay as well but I really didn't like the mole. (Enchiladas with Mexican chocolate.) my boyfriend had the steak which was phenomenal. Highly recommend that option if you're a beef lover. Overall, four stars for the food. For the service two stars. Our waitress was pretty friendly but I had to ask her repeatedly if someone can turn on the heating lamps. She promised me within the 10 minutes the manger would come and turn it on. Never came. Got our food, ate & drank our beers and still the manager never came. Of course if I chose to sit outside that's my own fault but why have the heating lamps if it's going to be such a hassle to turn it on. I couldn't enjoy the time or the food because I had to be in the cold.

Our server arrived, Blake was his name, he took our order and then we never saw him again - literally he never came back to our table - just a food runner to bring food, and our check.

I swear, my stomach had already started eating itself by the time the food arrived. My veggie quesadilla was absolutely amazing. Or was it only so good because I was so hungry? My friend's open-faced quesadilla, on the other hand, was burnt on the bottom! It was so burnt that it wasn't even edible. Unacceptable that they thought this could still be served to a customer. We told our waitress and asked her to cancel the order because we didn't have time to wait for another one. The waitress said it'd only take a couple of minutes and indeed it did. If they could spit out a quesadilla so quickly, I'm confused as to why our food took so long in the first place. Anyway, the manager came out and personally apologized to my friend, which I thought was excellent customer service. I'd never experienced this before. Kudos to you, Dos Caminos! He even offered to get her a drink, on him. Instead, he got the whole table (of 6) free drinks! Score! AND they didn't charge her for the quesadilla! Wow. Good job, Dos Caminos.

My husband and I got tacos but they were just ok really. The dessert we did not like, the salted caramel tres leches cake, not a tres leches at all, very bland and was supposed to have a layer of hazelnut crunch but it was kind of soggy really.

4.0,1/3/2016,"Beautiful restaurant and relaxed atmosphere! There are two floors that are decorated with sweeping branches and twinkle lights. Dos Caminos is a great place to go with friends for some quality Mexican food and margaritas- but only if you're feeling laid back that night and definitely not in a rush. The service is painstakingly slow (and forgetful-- our server forgot to put in several of our drink orders and an entire round of tequila shots). It took about an hour for our meals to come out...but it was Saturday night so we weren't too hard on them. Despite the awful service, the entrees are creative and worth the long wait. I ordered the Dos Enchiladas and they were some of the best I've ever had. There are some interesting margaritas on the menu as well. I've never seen a kale juice margarita on a menu before.

They have a couple of margarita options, but only two for frozen ones- really which there's more than that. And the drinks were a little on the pricy side. $13 or 14- glasses weren't big.We shared the guac and the picked veggies- needed more! The guac isn't too sour which is the kind I enjoy more. They can also make the guac mild or spicy! Tacos- they can make it as normal ones or naked ( no tortillas). Overall nothing too special. And the ceviche sampler: octopus wasn't very fresh/chewy, but love the tuna (sauce was great)!

When I pay $15 for a cocktail, I want it to be so delicious that I spend another $15 for a second. For my entree, I ordered the BBQ Goat. I have had goat several times, usually at Indian restaurants, and really enjoyed it. I figured, why not give Mexican goat a shot? This particular goat was not enjoyable. It was incredibly tough, and the flavors were very gamey. My friend ordered the Baja ""surf and turf"" tacos. The skirt steak was very tough and without flavor, while the shrimp were heavily coated in a greasy breading.This restaurant is in a beautiful location, and I could see myself coming back to get some classic drinks and apps to enjoy outside.

The food was great and this is the problem that I have.  Thee food was fantastic, especially the mac n' chorizo and shrimp Quesidilla.  The food was original and tasty.  The chips were extremely expensive at $24 and definitely not worth it.  I would recommend avoiding this place at lunch because their bar is understocked during this time.  I think it would have a good bar scene and good finger food.",0,0,0,Joseph C.,"Middle Village, NY",0,1,1
2.0,10/14/2015,"I'm still not sure if I would come back here or not. Maybe not to this particular location.. We waited around 15 minutes to be sat outside which wasn't a bad wait. The tables are so close together that any shame you have should be abandoned at the door. Everyone can hear you. My first issue starts with the fact that after receiving the complimentary water I asked for a lemon from the bar and a straw (which servers should have at their waist. I work in a restaurant) and I literally had to ask when my entree came out from the runner for a straw again because my server obviously was not concerned with my simple request. Also, the drink he recommended was disgusting.. Maybe we just have different tastes, but I wanted something sweet and what I got was so far from. We'll chalk that up to my mistake for asking for a suggestion from someone who is supposed to know. Moving on to the food.. We ordered chips & beans with some salsa for an appetizer. I had the salmon for an entree. My date had the chicken tacos without the salsa. Appetizers were delicious. Salmon was good, but it was not an appropriate meal for an adult. I'm just shy of 110 lbs and I was still hungry after that tiny a** plate.The best part?

3.0,10/9/2015,"Poor management skills!!!My wife and I decided to go for dinner and drinks for my birthday. After our 2 favorite places were packed we decided to go to 2 Caminos. There were no tables inside so we decided to sit outside next to a heater. Unfortunately we were not so close to the heater and there was some breeze, 10 mins later i spotted a table that was paying and was next to a heater so we can both sit.The host accommodate to the new table and we started our night, which it went a little sour 10 mins later.We ordered drinks and food, the view was nice, the temperature was just right until a blond woman came and lowered our heater without asking. I asked her politely not to lower the heater, to which she responded shouting ""IS NOT OFF!!"" and just walked away.My wife and I were surprised with the rudeness of this person, so i decided to go inside and request to speak to the manager. The host kindly said he would look for Veronica, a few minutes later to my surprise the same woman that adjusted the heater at our table was the manager.I told her that it would have been nice if she spoke to us before lowering in the heat, I explained to her that this was our second table and I wanted to be comfortable as possible as we were celebrating my birthday. Unfortunately she responded again very rudely that she was trying to accommodate the patrons that were on the next table. I explained to her that it was understandable to accommodate a guest however she could have talked to us before or offer another table. I told her she needs to consider all patrons on this establishment. Her response was just precious ""Well what do you want me to do?"" Not only she responded rude, waiving her arms up but she was not able to come up with a solution. I told her I would speak to my wife to possible move once again if she has an available table inside which is not ideal but I would let her know. After checking back with my wife We decided not to move again and just waited out until the other guests leave so we could possibly get the heater up again. I went back and offer this solution to the manager to which she responded ""Well I can not predict it will not get any colder, so what do you want"" after that last respond i just gave up and went back to my sit.My waitress seen all this mess came to us and move the heater closer to us. Although she said she is not supposed to move the heater this was the best solution unfortunately a few minutes later my waitress got the bad part of it as well. After 5 minutes Veronica the manager went to the table next to us explain to them that she was raising the heat to accommodate us and then came to our table to raise the heat again. The waitress told Veronica she move the heater closer to us, and she responded again shouting ""WELL DONT"" and walked away Surprisingly she didn't raise the heat, she actually turned it off most likely by mistake, who knows! A few minutes later I called my waitress and ask her if she could turn on the heat, she grab another person and turned it ON again to the right temperature. After all this mess our waitress came and apologized for bad experience we were having. I explained to her that is unfortunate that manager who is supposed to cater to all patrons has an attitude and rudeness to the way she proceeds and talks to everybody. The fact that she is rude on her responses including to patrons, she just reacts instead of seen the big picture in this case she turn down the heat without even informing us nor considering how it would affect us and she was not able to come up with a solution upon a patron's request. This really shows  poor people and and management skills. I live in manhattan and of the things i bragged about living in this city if the fact that here we can get the best food experience. I go out on food adventures trying something different just to get taste of the best. Of course not every time I get the best food but certainly the experience will be the  deal breaker. I love the restaurant business so much that I envision to own a restaurant one day, just to give people excellent quality food and the best experience they dream off. I understand how difficult working on this environment can be and i know not everyone is cut for this job.So please to Veronica and other managers that might had a bad day out there, when you go to work on customer oriented business please be consider of your customers.Remember that you are also a customer tied to a phone or cable company, you are also a consumer of the capitalism we lived in, so next time don't react and for a minute think how can you make the best experience for  your customer, think like if you are catering to yourself.As i said a experience will be a deal breaker thankfully our waitress brushed the bad experience away by giving us a great service making sure we were doing ok and on top of it she apologize for the manager's behavior.

4.0,9/29/2015,"If you're looking for a dinner spot with some ""action"", then Dos Caminos is the place for you. It's a dimly lit Mexican restaurant with a great atmosphere that invites you to have fun, talk loudly, drink and eat the night away. There's even a club downstairs that was open when I went (Saturday). The flavors of each dish we had were very strong. (And the drinks were even stronger.) Two standouts among the food frenzy was the corn and the plantain empanadas. I'm pretty sure we ordered a second serving of each.The place is a bit pricey but if you're coming to the Meatpacking District for dinner, that's what you should be expecting. The service was pretty good too. We were even given a dessert on the house which was an unexpected delight.The one thing that struck me as odd though, was two separate times our waiter/another waiter came by and took a plate off our table when there was still food on it. Without even asking too. It's not a huge issue but one that struck me as odd.

2.0,9/14/2015,"Dos Caminos is the ground floor of a building that looks like Flatiron Building. I felt like I expected a lot out of this considering that many of the menu items are a bit pricier than other Mexican joints that may not have the amount of real estate that Dos Caminos has.I made a reservation for 7pm on OpenTable and was glad I did - they were very busy outside (they have outdoor seating btw!) and inside started filling up around 8pm in the bar area.  If you have a reservation, just head inside!  The outdoor hostess was pretty busy and the line is pretty much nonexistent, so don't bother.Inside, it's pretty dark, almost a little too dark... But just enough if you look hard enough, you can see the menu.  We started off with guacamole and chips, with bacon and chicharrones of course.  It was actually really good - probably the best part, but as an appetizer it was very filling for two people.  I would recommend it for more people, or getting one avocado instead of two (a question I have never been asked before about getting guacamole).For the main course, we went with tacos - I had the special they were having that day with pork and pineapples.  The pork was basically a very under-seasoned and extremely dry porkchop, only having the pineapples as moisture.  I also am a bit particular about my tortillas - I love my double tortilla and it was as single, which was slightly disappointing.  My friend had the mar y tierra, and unfortunately, it too was dry and not worth the price.Overall, our meal came out to about $30ish per person, which would have been worth it if the food was just a bit better.  If I had dos caminos, and one was to Dos Caminos and the other to my local Mexican joint, you'd be sure that I'm taking the latter.",1,1,0,Janice F.,"Manhattan, NY",573,503,401

The establishment  is nice, it was pretty empty, so we had a lot of options as far as where we could sit.The first issue we had with our waiter was with one of the drinks ordered, I am not sure if he wrote it incorrectly or if the bartender simply served the wrong drink. However we ordered a Jack Daniel's on the rock and received a Makers Mark instead. Also I asked for a sample of the available Prosecco and when it came time to serve it, he just dropped on the table as he was walking by, no words, nothing. The next issue, or rather annoyance I had with the waiter was when he delivered the guacamole and chips we ordered. There are 3 dips, or rather spices that accompany it. As soon as he put it on the table I said ""We're good, we don't need that"" he looked at me and said "" Well Im going to explain anyway"" Which I thought was unnecessary, as I had just indicated we were not interested in them.When our food was delivered my guest was given the wrong order, so we had to wait an additional time for them to fix that mistake. While we were waiting we ordered another Jack Daniel's on the rock which subsequently never came.Our waiter simply didn't seem to care or even listen.

3.0,8/4/2015,"Sat outdoors and it was very pleasant. Service is pretty good, friendly and attentive. Actually, they were pretty on top of things in a good way. So the skinny is this-food and drinks were ok. We had margaritas, which were good but not the best we had. The guac in medium heat with bacon and chicharron were a bit of a disappointment. It would be better if they used crisper chicharron and bacon, crumbled a healthier serving of both into the guac instead of putting 3 measly chicharron chips and a what felt like a slice of chopped bacon on top. It felt and tasted like it was just kinda thrown together.The corn bread on the skillet was very good but perhaps a little less butter would have been better.. perhaps ask them to put it on the side. We also ordered the mac and cheese chorizo with jalapeños as a side. I liked it but my friend, not so much. Perhaps change the pasta.Last and certainly not least was the tres Leche cake with salt caramel. Again shared, and while serving was a little on the small side - probably for the better since that alone contained my daily caloric limit for the day. #gluttonyI'd go back, service, location and vibe is good and food was good enough to garner a return visit.",0,0,0,Sandee T.,"New York, NY",76,116,117
2.0,8/1/2015,I'm giving 2-stars because the guacamole was pretty good. But the service was underwhelming.  It took nearly 30-minutes to deliver one order of Carnitas tacos. They were okay but no reason to come eat here. The rice and beans were actually the highlight of the dish if that tells you anything. It took another 15-minutes to get our waiter to actually bring our check. Poor service+marginal food=no return business.  There are too many great Mexican places in NYC to come back here.,0,0,0,Kevin K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,28,0

3.0,7/26/2015,"Food is nice, drinks are strong, service isn't great.Came here for a late brunch in the Meatpacking district. Started the table off with guac and chips -- the chips were hot, and the amount of guac that was served was huge (in a good way). The three salsas that were included at the table had a nice mix of smokey and spicy flavors. Tried an entree off their brunch menu, which came with a complimentary drink. I got a frozen traditional margarita, which I thought was actually fairly strong. I got the salmon and avocado benedict, which was served on what tasted like a type of cornbread, as well as with potatoes that were baked in a hashbrown sort of rectangular shape. Thought there could have been a bit more salmon, but for the most part I enjoyed the food. You can also get a free prickly pear ""shot"", which is basically a champagne glass full of margarita. The service was the worst thing about this place. While there wasn't anything that made it horrible in particular, I felt like our table was just not well attended to. Maybe our waiter had a lot of tables to juggle (?), but I feel like that's no excuse for the delay it took him to get to and from our table.

Finally we paid in cash and were waiting for 20 minutes for change as our waiter again never acknowledged it and seemed to be avoiding us.

He said they were backed up because of a party and we'll ""get it when we get it."" Wtf. Who says that when working in customer service?

2.0,7/24/2015,"Last night I went to the Dos Caminos in the Meatpacking district. Service was good. Our server was attentive, pleasant and patient. My friends and I, using our trusty Yelp app, checked in and got a free ""Prickly pear"" drink which was great. The meal was fine. A friend and I shared the tuna tacos--which were really good. We also shared the guac which normally I love, but this time it was missing something and was a little tasteless. My main issue is the the following: My friend, who suffers from allergies, placed her order and asked that she not be given beans (as she is allergic). The waiter went to the kitchen to confirm that this could be done. He came back and said no problem- no beans. When her dish arrived it had the allergy alert on it which clearly stated no beans. Mid way through her meal she began to feel ill. She poked through her dish and found beans!  We called the attention of our server who got manger. Manager came over and was very apologetic and concerned etc etc. He removed her meal from our bill.  I know that mistakes can happen, however what other steps could have been taken to make sure this didn't happen? This could have ended badly. One last thing---the ladies room was DISGUSTING. Clearly had not been cleaned for hours. Paper towels, and toilet tissue everywhere. Dirty toilets.  Just really off putting. This was a disappointing visit to Dos Caminos.",0,0,0,Melissa M.,"New York, NY",70,165,56
1.0,7/22/2015,"I have never left a bad review for a restaurant, but I have never been treated so poorly either.  So this unfortunately will be my first review. I have been to this location every time I've visited NYC for a trade show because simply the Guacamole is amazing and the food doesn't fall short from its reputation.   For the most part the service is great.  HOWEVER, today ""Kyle D"" has shown me what unbelievably poor service looks like, and I've been in customer service industry for a couple of years.It started off with the introduction.   I had asked to see if they had a ""wet burrito"" which in California is most commonly known as a burrito that is covered in red or green sauce quite similar to an enchilada.   The response I got was a silence and an annoyed stare.   A simple ""no"" or suggestion of an enchilada as a substitute would have been suffice instead we were given, discomfort.Soon after, Kyle's return for our drink order came up.   We had decided to not drink because we would be meeting up our friends shortly.   Instead of a polite ""that's fine"" he looked me dead in the eye and said ""REALLY"" in what seemed to be a condescending manner.   Now I may have not understood his humor or intent, but after the rough start it did not sit very well with us.  And to TOP IT ALL OFF during our entire dinner we were not checked up on once, nor did we get a water refill!At the end of it all even though my girlfriend told me not give a tip, I couldn't find it in me to do so.

4.0,7/10/2015,"Ok, first off, I want to say that I am a huge fan of this chain. The food and service at every location has been fantastic. I travel for work and between the Florida and New York locations, every Dos Caminos establishment I've been has been amazing. This time, my girlfriend came along and I knew exactly where to take her. I ordered the Barbacoa de Chivo and she ordered the Shrimp Quesadilla, as well as the guacamole and some margaritas.Everything came out earlier than I could've expected, it all tasted great, and we had a great time with the waiter who was making jokes and being extremely kind to us, even though we're from out of town and were asking a few questions about the location. We were getting dessert, as we were near the back on the second floor,  we were fairly close to the register booths where the servers input orders, which we didn't mind at all, we were quite busy with the food. What we did mind was there was a manager who stormed up from across the room, and before we knew what was happening, he had an outburst on the same server that had given us such amazing service! My wife and I decided to listen in because he came in such a huff, it was pretty ridiculous. He was a portly man, short in stature, and obviously not very bright because we looked around room and he didn't seem to notice that we weren't the only ones watching his outburst. After another minute of just lecturing our server, he cursed under his breath (but not really) and stormed off again. There was a slightly shocked silence and when our server came back, we asked him what the issue was. It didn't make much sense to us, but from what our server made it sound like, the manager was upset about ""guacamole times"" and ""napkins."" We told him that was absolutely ridiculous, we gave him the check and moved on. We had gleaned that the Manager's name was ""Peter,"" tipped the server very well for his troubles and made on with our day.I gave this four stars, and it could've been five stars. The service was amazing, the food was delicious, and the drinks tasted stellar and got the job done right. What was took away the star was Peter at the end of our meal, making a scene.

BUT, my BFF and her girlfriend were visiting from LA and we were on our way to the Whitney Museum, trekking in the afternoon heat and we were parched. We knew that we needed sustenance before 2-3 hrs of museum gazing and guacamole + margaritas sounded perfect. Note, we went on a Monday afternoon - so there was no line, few people and this is probably WHY we had a good experience ;-)Why did we have a good time?1) The Margaritas! Especially the one with the Grilled Grapefruit piece! That was refreshing and spectacular.2) The sauces that come with the Guac and chips. We especially enjoyed the cilantro one.3) The Guacamole was fresh and was VERY tasty and chunky. We ordered the traditional and it was exactly what we needed for sustainable museum gazing energy.4) The server. She was on it, had great recs and was kind (I realize it was also a Monday afternoon).5) The Chino-Latino Tuna Ceviche: WOW. This was an unexpected treat. The tuna is served on pickled seaweed with toasted sesame seed oil. You just have to try it if you enjoy tuna. We were licking the oil sauce with our chips, fingers and tongues. 6) The company. This whole review could be colored by the fact that I was hanging w/ my BFF, who I see 1-2x a year.Why not 5 stars? The chips. They tasted like they were from a bag. They weren't stale, but it would have been nice if they were really fresh.

But this time, the portions seemed much smaller, and the food was way overpriced: $11.50 for a small chopped salad; $18 for fish tacos that only come with one teeny tiny bowl of dry rice and beans for two people to share?  Huh?  We had two servers and the first guy was odd, rambling about internal politics.  Then we were assigned a  second waiter, who was normal, but the whole vibe was strange.  I ordered a glass of Riesling, which was $11 on the menu (bad enough), but when I got the bill it was $12.

Seriously...i can make like 10 of them at home for like $5 lol...and it was just that, enchiladas, nothing else comes with any of the entrees.They do however bring 1 bowl with half rice and half beans in it FOR THE TABLE.The service was ok, she checked on us when she needed to, to take our order and for the check.

Overpriced, both food and drinks.  Dia de los Muertos beer was old, not worth $8, and ordered fish tacos and one was actually chicken.  Sent the last one back and it was returned saying that it was the tail of the fish.  I know the difference between chicken and fish, and your staff should too.  For the price you'd expect a better experience, I won't be coming back.  The table had two orders of tacos, and only one side of beans and rice was brought to the table.  Later we watched the table across from us order one order of tacos and they were delivered the same side order.  Again, disappointed, it's rice and beans!On a side note, we had the actual chicken tacos and they were good, I won't be returning...",0,0,0,Kiel M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0

3.0,5/23/2015,"I've been a fan of Dos Caminos since the first time I stumbled upon the location on Park Ave. While I'm glad that there are multiple locations in the city, the consistency of the food and dining experiences vary from location to location. The location in the Meatpacking District is easy to get to and there are lots of shops nearby as well as the famous Chelsea Market, but I find their services to be slower and less attentive, the restaurant is also not as comfortable as the one on Park Ave. I ordered my usual - guacamole, skirted steak brunch. The fried eggs were the most memorable from that visit, it was perfectly seasoned, with the perfect runny yolk. Guacamole was good. Everything else was okay and nothing to write about. When I leave the location on Park Ave, I usually can't wait to go back there. Whatever I have always turn out to be memorably good and making me crave for more.

In any event, me & my gf were sat at this small table that looked like it folding table. The dim lights I really like about the place so that wasn't the issue it was just comfort-abilities = in my eyes the ability to move comfortably.

1.0,5/18/2015,"As a frequent visitor to the Meatpacking District, I really enjoy a stop at Dos Caminos, as the service, food and ambience has always been great.  I had a high hopes for last night, as we were looking forward to a festive going away meal for friends that were visiting from the UK, however it was tarnished by cold food and disappointing resolutions. We were seated quickly, as we planned ahead and made reservations for 7:15 pm  knowing full well that it was going to be busy, as it was such a nice night to be out and about in NYC. Once seated, the waiter was very nice, took our drinks order and then took our order.  We ordered an appetizer, and guacamole for starters, and 4 entrees.  The guacamole came out fresh, and was delicious, however, the appetizer never appeared.  Then as the time passed, over 50 minutes, the waiter came to apologize and to let us know that the kitchen ""lost"" our ticket with the remaining items of our meal.  We agreed sometimes it happens, and understood that our food would be rushed.  It was not.  The food arrived 20 minutes later and to add to the evening, the food arrived cold.  I for one, at that point wasn't going to wait for another 20 minutes to receive another meal.  I ordered the carnitas tacos, and for $16.50, I was disappointed, as if I had weighed the amount of pork in the tacos, I believe it was only maybe 6 - 8oz of meat for three (3) SMALL tacos.  I understand that they can't be overflowing, but I didn't feel there was enough.  During our meal, the manager appeared to apologize again and let us know that the round of drinks would be removed from the bill and deserts would be sent as apology.  We let him know that they meal was cold, and in his defense, he did ask if we wanted to have new ones delivered, but by that point, it was almost 9pm.  The server said the desserts were going to come out, asked if we had allergies, and we said only thing was bananas.  Now mind you, there were 4 people in our party, and he brought 3 desserts out.  Seemed a bit odd, that a/we couldn't choose what we wanted, and b/why only 3 for a table of 4?

The food was very good but the service was some of the worst I have ever experienced. Our hostess and server were both curt and bothersome. The hostess refused to seat us until the whole party had arrived even though there were many open tables visible. Once we ordered we were told that we only had 45 minutes to sit because not everyone had ordered an entrée (despite people ordering apps and drinks which totaled the same price). About 45 minutes after we sat down our server actually told us that our 45 minutes was up and handed us the bill. Our drinks were half full and our food was not finished. This was unbelievable to me, especially since they took at least 20 minutes to serve us. After handing us the bill the waiter checked back on the table every 2 minutes to see if we had put our credit cards down. He cleared each drink the second they were empty. It was uncomfortable to say the least. I will never return to this location and I suggest you try anywhere else in the neighborhood over this spot.",1,0,0,Alexandra R.,"Manhattan, NY",174,124,11

We were also never asked whether we wanted more drinks, which we did. We complained to the hosts about our service but no remedy was made or offered.The food itself was acceptable but lower quality than I expected from dos caminos.  The octopus cevice while well spiced was chewy.  My fish tacos were overcooked and dull in flavor.I visited the men's restroom, which was a total disgusting mess.Shame on you dos caminos, BRGuest Group and the managers.

Through the years, Dos Caminos was never great, but decent enough to get my Mexican fix. To say it has gone downhill is an understatement. The only reason to go to this establishment, in this location, is for the outdoor seating in the summer to munch on some chips and salsa trio. Beyond that, be prepared for unripened avocados in the guac which rendered it tasteless; greasy, chewy empandas; fatty carne asada with some veggies slopped on the side of the dish- they really call that an entree? Our waiter was slow and forgetful (in his defense, he seemed spread way too thin with a huge section that he couldn't manage), the staff would come by and fill our water as if there was a fire in the glass and a huge no-no was waiting 25 minutes for a margarita that tasted like it was ordered in a dive bar during Spring Break in Cancun.Adios, Dos Caminos!",1,1,0,Rebecca E.,"Manhattan, NY",100,64,1

2.0,2/5/2015,"Gahh! Alright where do I begin? I think I will start with the positives:The guacamole was delicious.I ordered the ribeye and it was excellent!Desserts were scrumptious.You may wonder why the low rating then. Well here is the deal:DISCLAIMER: I am rating this restaurant from the perspective of a guy who was in a rather large party.Many times members of my party asked if the meal can come with a bit of an adjustment (less spicy, more spicy, switch sides, etc) and I felt that whatever you would order is the way it will come - no adjustments available. I found that a little off-putting on behalf of some of the other folks who inquired.The alcohol I received was very strong with tequila- it really cut through the other flavors and therefore not very refreshing. Perhaps if I were at a bar Quintin Tarrantino-style then the drink would be par for the course, but not so here in this situation.There seemed to be no order in terms of ordering...example:Server: Can we start off with something to drink?Person 1: Yes, I'll have an Arnold Palmer.Person 2: I'll have a beer.Person 3: I'll have some water.Server: Great, would you like the Guac?Person 4: Yes I would!Person 5: Can I get the Tuna appetizer?Server: I'll put that in. (walks away)(10 mins later, server returns with Guac, walks away)Person 4, 6, 7: Nom Nom Nom, this Guac is gewd.(5 mins later, server returns with Tuna, walks away)Person 5: This tuna is way too spicy.(10 mins later, server returns...)Server: are you ready for entrees now?Persons 1, 2, 3: ???????The server should always ask if everyone is ready to order drinks, then appetizers, then entrees, rather then not being all too attentive.When the bill came, we had a large party and therefore confusion ensued. Here is the thing: in every restaurant that I have ever been to, I find that the gratuity is included when there is a large party. Well in Dos Caminos, they do not include the large party gratuity in the final price - they have it listed in the fine print below, but not included. Now I completely understand why that is included in most restaurants when it comes to big parties - to avoid confusion and a lengthy process calculating final price at the end of the night. Plus, I learned on this night that tip is calculated from the subtotal, not subtotal + tax! Go figure! Part of why there was so much confusion!Plus, we had to pay a minimum of 45$ per person because we were part of a large party. What?! I don't understand the logic or policy behind this... And, if enough people don't get to the 45$ thresholds, the restaurant gives us enough desserts to get to the 45$ threshold. Therefore a guy in our party who only ordered appetizer ended up paying for our desserts. Can you sense the uneasiness about this system overall? It's almost as if the restaurant doesn't want large parties to appear - feels like bad business.Anyway, the tacos were hit or miss, everything that was spicy was over-spiced and difficult to ingest. Even the guy who enjoys spicy food almost threw it because it was that unpleasant to have. The pork was a bit bland and dry as if it were made yesterday and so was the black beans and yellow rice. The 'ceviche' was displayed as if it was sushi (I thought this was a Mexican restaurant?) and there was nothing special about it except that it was unbearably spicy.Anyway, the place's large party system is seriously flawed, the food, while had few bright spots, was underwhelming and therefore it is overpriced.",1,3,0,David S.,"Garfield, NJ",85,155,36

The people watching is cool too.I had some drinks as well as an order of the guac and some spicy salsa. The guac, which I heard so much about, was good but not amazing. I've had better at a few places, but it was enjoyable. I found the salsa to be really good, slightly sweet almost, with just the right amount of spice.

3.0,1/12/2015,"First of all, it is overrated. If I didn't dine much in Manhattan, particularly Mexican food, I could've called it decent.

5.0,1/10/2015,"I've been to four different Dos Caminos locations and the more I go, the more of a fan I become.  I've never had a bad meal, and the ambience is always lively and fun.  The Meatpacking location, however, has my best review partially because it's my favorite location, partially because of the company I was with, and partially because we had an amazing waiter, Raheem.I had a reservation for myself and three friends for a Friday night.  We got held up and arrived a half hour late but they still sat us, no problem!  The restaurant is two floors, and more intimate-feeling than the others I've been to.  It was already pretty late so my friends and I decided to just order a pitcher of sangria, guac for the table, and several appetizers.  The guac was the best I've had at a Dos Caminos, not sure why or how that happened but it was amazing and I'm not the only one who felt that way.  I also finally tried the empanadas appetizer which was awesome, as was the chorizo mac n cheese (which has been on my Dos Caminos to-try list for a while).I noticed that if you check in on Yelp, you get a free prickly pear shot.  I showed Raheem the deal and he said he'd bring it over.  A few minutes later he came up to me and asked if I wanted the shot now, or after I finished my sangria.  I said now and he asked if the table wanted the prickly pear drink too.  I asked ""is it included?"" and he responded with ""no, but I can make it happen,"" to which I responded with ""well then, I'm not going to pass up that offer!""  And so he returned with a round of drinks for the table!  However, much to my surprise it wasn't a shot but rather a fruity, tropical, frozen margarita-like drink, and it was STRONG!  Thank you Raheem!Great service, strong drinks, good food.  I love you more and more, Dos Caminos.",0,0,0,Jackie S.,"New York, NY",1004,802,3287

It felt like we were kids playing house and feeding each other micro plates of exorbitantly high-priced, tasteless food!! Food was below average for the price!

You can definitely enjoy the hustle and bustle of the city, but the area still feels intimate enough that you can enjoy the company of your other dinner guests. The guacamole here is a bit on the pricey side ($14 for a 2-person serving) and it's served with a hearty side of tortilla chips as well as the house salsa trio. I liked the medium best but even the most spicy one had a very enjoyable kick. You also have the option to add various toppings to your guacamole free of charge (there's also a shrimp option for +$2). We opted for mangos and peppers? and it was delicious. The guac is super creamy and one of the best I've ever had... worth every cent! Our alcoholic drinks were also super strong and delicious - everything on the bar menu looked appetizing so I don't think you can go wrong here. The only complaint I have is that they are a little heavy-handed with the ice. Boyfriend and I decided to go for the ""Tour de Tacos"" which is 2 of the following: mahi mahi, chicken, carnitas, and carne asada steak tacos. They are perfectly portioned so that you can try all the varieties and leave feeling stuffed (we didn't even finish). The carnitas was BY FAR our favorite because of how juicy the pork was.

The summer outdoor dining option is great too (especially if people watching is your thing). Most importantly, the food was so good. I stopped in for brunch and ordered the Mexican french toast. What made me decide to eat here vs at Bagatelle or Sugar Factory for brunch is the fact that their brunch plates come with a drink included. You can get a free frozen traditional or prickly pear margarita, mimosa, or another beverage. Seeing that a margarita costs around $13 normally, a brunch plate for $13 where you get a free one is definitely worth it. Their mexican french toast was the best french toast I've ever had. The warm syrup, caramelized bananas, and flavored whipped cream helped to perfect the dish. It was absolutely wonderful. Plus, they give you a free side of rice and beans also. So, in conclusion, if you enjoy getting a brunch plate, a free drink, PLUS a side bowl of rice and beans for under $15, this is the place to try.

2.0,8/29/2014,"Came here for a friend's birthday on a Saturday evening.While I was waiting for everyone to arrive, I sat at the bar.  I asked for the drink menu and the bartender ignored me.  These 2 women with nasally high pitched annoying voices standing by me didn't ask for the drink menu, but the same bartender gave it to them.  They didn't look at it, so I grabbed it and gave him a look and said, ""Oh, is this the drink menu?"" to which he did not respond.  Needless to say, I never ended up getting a drink while I was waiting to be seated and I'm glad I didn't, because I definitely would not have tipped the tool.  I guess the only way to get attention  is if you're 6'0 tall, wearing caked on make up and have a loud, obnoxious, high pitched valley girl voice.  God, I wanted to wear ear plugs - I don't know why anyone would find that attractive.Next, when everyone arrived, we were seated by a very attractive, petite African American snooty female.  There were about 10 - 12 of us and she sat us at 2 separate tables adjacent to one another.  We asked if we can have the tables placed together and the hostess rolled her eyes and acted as if we asked for her to perform a heart transplant.  Honey, you are not going to get far with that attitude and you will be a hostess forever, that is, if no one else complains about your arrogant behavior.  I don't understand why she's working in that line of service.  Heck, if she can't even work as a hostess, what the hell can she do beyond that?!Our waiter was very friendly and offered suggestions.  The guac is always good. The food was decent, but in my opinion, too pricey.  If you have to have mexican in meatpacking, go somewhere else - or just go to a different restaurant like Spice Market (amazing food & service) or any other restaurant - you definitely have better choices in the area.I would never recommend this location - the service overall is average.  I've been to the midtown location and the service there is excellent and it is more spacious, so I highly recommend going there instead.  Who wants to be cramped with a bunch of stuck up, unhelpful and rude staff members?",2,1,1,Helly K.,"Los Angeles, CA",174,329,46
1.0,8/27/2014,"this location used to have divine food, even back in february when we went the food was delicious. we came here last week and quickly realized that something is extremly if not totally different. first of all they switched the ingredients for the cheese that comes in a skillet- it is no longer even the same cheese but some sort of watery gross mix of cheap cheese with dried up bacon bits--- EW. second of all the food has NO FLAVOR what so ever. it is just disgustingly spicy and well thats all... not sweet, not salty just plain spicy and cold. got the  chicken tacos -  chicken was old and dry with ZERO FLAVOR. my boyfriend got the quesadilla which also had old dried up chicken in it. i don't know what happened to this location.. maybe they switched ownership and decided to use cheap food but keep the same prices? what ever..the food tasted like crap. we will not be going back and we were big fans of this place, been here about 6+ times.",0,0,0,Food C.,"Brooklyn, NY",96,2,0

I shared the white sangria pitcher ($32) with one other person and after finishing the pitcher, I was slightly buzzed at most. I don't think there was much alcohol in the sangria.I ordered the fish tacos and shared the lime chile fries with one other. The fries were pretty good, however the fish tacos ($18) were very small. The order of tacos came with 3, very standard in any Mexican restaurant. The actual tortilla had not been heated beforehand. I'm not sure if they forgot to but it was an unpleasant taco. Without heating the tortilla, the dough had a weird texture, where it wasn't very chewy and just sort of tasted gritty.If I do return to their overpriced food, I will most likely stick to beer as my alcoholic beverage and order a different dish.",0,1,0,Marcus L.,"Tenafly, NJ",3,7,0

4.0,7/22/2014,"Okay, so, when it comes to atmosphere, Dos Caminos in the Meatpacking District is little bit like the Staten Island ferry, plus guacamole. Still, if you can get past the high-heeled women tripping on cobblestones and loud men at bachelor parties trying to out-loud each other on the street, Dos Caminos is actually quite a lovely dining experience. Go on a weekday when it's nice out, and you'll see what I mean. Great guacamole, great prickly pear margaritas, and the Dos enchiladas are nothing short of excellent. (If tacos are more your speed, might I recommend the pesca tacos? So refreshing.) And the fact that you can enjoy it outside, rain or shine, on a summer day? Hey, that's worth the shudder-worthy thumping sound of the club down the block. Now, for as good as the food is, I will admit its overpriced. But Dos Caminos' brunch is a different story. For a $12 stellar entree, you can get a margarita along with it -- cheaper than most brunch in the city. And virtually every option is amazing: The eggs benedict with salmon, the breakfast quesadillas, the chilaquiles... I've had them all, and have enjoyed them all.

4.0,7/14/2014,"Just went here for a party this past weekend which was a $45 pre fixe menu, and it was pretty good.  They give you guac and chips plus salsas, plantain empanadas and taquitos, flank steak, salmon and some chicken enchiladas and a little chocolate cake and some ice cream.  Seems like a good value for the price. We were there for a surprise party and the people before us couldn't seem to take the hint to leave, so we were stuck waiting (and sweating that the guest of honor would arrive before set up), but the manager was very accommodating and comped us some drinks for being patient, which I thought was nice and professional.The waiter was ADORBS and did a great job taking care of everybody.  Only cons about this place for me was that it is DARK....I mean thank the Lord I didn't have to read the menu because I would have needed a grandma flashlight.  It wasn't too crowded up where we were sitting which was nice, and even though it wasn't a private room the other people in the restaurant weren't on top of us so it was fine. Also, while the food is tasty, it is greasy, and I was feeling meh the next day after eating it.  Guac is a must have though....I hate avocados (I know not normal) and I liked this a lot.  I would recommend it overall.",2,1,0,Jacqui B.,"Hamden, CT",65,49,0

3.0,6/21/2014,"IN SHORT: Although the guacamole at Dos Caminos vies for the best in the city, the rest of the menu falls comparatively short, particularly for the price. But with plenty of outdoor seating and a long list of salted margaritas, sometimes a stop at Dos Caminos on a summer night is the perfect idea.THE STORY: I venture to Dos Caminos because 1) I live nearby, and 2) I crave homemade guacamole every other day, and theirs manages to showcase creamy, fresh avocados subtly balanced with salty tomatoes. Fortunately for the restaurant, those two reasons tend to outweigh the otherwise lackluster food and service. Trying to be aloof, the wait staff often just appears confused, and even around 6:30 on a Tuesday night, the food and drinks arrive at the table far later than they should.While an ideal night for me would just involve their nearly impeccable guacamole with a trio of salsas (the menu says that a $14 order serves just 2 people, but honestly the guacamole is the only item on the menu that comes massively portioned and could easily serve a group of 4 to 6), sometimes a full dinner is necessary. In that case, I like to order rounds of the El Camino margarita with Milagro Blanco, triple sec, and fresh lime juice, a bewitching elixir for just $11, and their Pescado tacos, which though overpriced for the quality and quantity, include freshly grilled mahi-mahi, spicy slaw, and guacamole, topped with smoked chile aioli.

Their margaritas are so strong and potent yet still retain the delicious quality of tart to sweet that makes a margarita so amazing and refreshing.

We didn't want to order any more alcoholic beverages, so this was a nice sweet treat. Naturally, we had to get the guacamole. A visit to a Mexican restaurant without it seems like a sad visit!The guac here is great, but not as good as Rosa Mexicano. That place is the BEST. We split two tacos. The Carnitas is slow-roasted pork with green chile salsa and pickled red onion. There was an aggressive amount of onion, so I picked some of it off.

Their margaritas are all delicious, and you can try a ""shot"" of the Prickly Pear frozen margarita for free by checking in on Yelp!I allow myself dairy once a week, so I went with the vegetarian Quesadilla del Mercado, which was fully loaded with cheese, mushrooms, veggies and a creamy dipping sauce. ""Midnight rice and beans"" is served for the table with any specialty entree, which I recommend 100% because it was a great staple for the meal and doesn't violate anybody's diet restrictions!I tried one of the Roasted Plantain Empanadas and fully expected to hate it because I dislike plantains, but it ended up being my favorite appetizer! There's no plantain taste at all, and the filling had serious flavor.One could argue that any restaurant that keeps the alcohol flowing strong and tasty will usually get great reviews, but I really have zero complaints.

1.0,10/14/2013,"Really awful food.  Inedible. The first thing you need to know is, despite the name, this is not Mexican, Latin American, or even South American.  I would describe it as Mexican fusion, but that's not quite it either.  I mean, they have a black bean and plantain empanada on the appetizer menu, and I would consider that Carribean food.  So don't expect burritos, refried beans, fried ice cream, etc.  Or even salsa.  But, I don't rate restaurants based on what they don't have, I rate them on what they do have.  Which is unfortunate for this grotesque play on food. The most offensive part of visiting here is how the waitstaff ask you if you want to start with guacomole.  They ask you as they are handing you the menus.  Before you get a chance to see that it is $14 for 2 people, and $24 for a bowl that serves 4-6.  It has no flavor (just tastes like avocado and tomato, not even salt added to season), and not even necessary because you get free chips and sauces.  Not chips and salsa, chips and sauces.  The chips are too salty (and I like salt), and none of the 3 dipping sauces are any good.  The best was the spicy, which basically tasted like ketchup and hot sauce.  As unispired as they were, these sauces were the most tolerable part of the meal.  Why they just don't give out salsa is beyond me.  You can be creative with salsa if being too ordinary is a concern.  The tacos (I won't even bother to identify which ones), smelled like someone's butt, and didn't taste much better.  Now I have had food that ""wasn't too good"", but I'm not sure I can remember a time where I just couldn't eat the food because it was so awful.  Yeah, I'd say everything was made fresh, but WHO CARES if it tastes awful.  Also, an order of tacos was supposed to come with black beans and rice, but instead they brought a single serving out for the whole table to share (there were multiple taco orders).  Oh, they told us we could ask for more, but that wasn't necessary because the rice was undercooked (still hard) and the black beans tasted like clay.Yup, it was that bad.",3,0,0,Angela S.,"Frederick, MD",1,282,195

4.0,8/26/2013,"Randomly came here for lunch today. For appetizers we got the chips and guacamole. As most people have mentioned the guacamole is fresh and very tasty. The chips were also very warm and fresh. A+ I ordered the chicken quesadilla which was really really good. The chicken was seasoned well and plenty of cheese which was great. A+ The quesadilla came with side orders of yellow rice and black beans. The beans were really good but the rice was tremendously slacking. Certain grains were hard and tasted old. Reason I am not giving it 5 stars is not because of the rice because thats just a small defect but because of the staff. For the most part the staff is very friendly buy our waiter kept disappearing with nowhere to be found so we had to keep getting different waiters for anything we needed. Overall it was a great experience. The food is a bit pricey but it is the city and the seating is very beautiful.

3.0,8/21/2013,"My girlfriend and I went here after a nice date night walk on the Highline.  We had to wait about 30 minutes to get a seat (around 8:30 on a Friday night).  They had a cool way to text you when your table was ready.We were immediately greeted by our server, who gave us chips and salsa (mild to spicy), which were very good.  We also ordered guacamole which I thought was pretty good, but my girl thought was just okay.  Our main dishes were vegetable quesadillas, and fish tacos.  The quesadillas were good, but the fish tacos were just okay.  They had a dressing that over powered them, but I did eat all three of them.We had no intention of ordering dessert, but they had a mix up with our meal, which caused them to be brought out very late.  Before we had a chance to complain, the manager came over and apologized and paid for two of our drinks and bought us dessert (even though we said we didn't want it, because we were full).  The dessert was a tres leches cake, with salty caramel.  Though we were full, we tried to eat it, and finished about half of it.  It was okay, but nothing to go crazy about.Overall, I think the food was okay.  If I were to go back, I'd go back for the friendliness.  The service had the one hiccup, but overall it was pretty good.",0,0,0,Tyrone W.,"Union City, NJ",4,9,7

We came in for a Sunday brunch. Drinks were good and worthy, which is standard for a Mexican restaurant serving margaritas. I ordered the tamales and instead of coming out wrapped in the corn shell, they came out mashed like potatoes and were soggy. I asked the server what the hell was going on and she just said it was an oversight on her part and that they started serving tamales like that as opposed to how they used to serve them.

3.0,8/16/2013,"Dos Caminos is the spot you go to chill with friends over a few drinks and some apps.  If you want to take out visitors to a happening place with a nice atmosphere and vibe, come to Dos Caminos. They are known here for their ambiance, margaritas and guacamole. The guacamole was good, not amazing. The margaritas, on the other hand, were made really well. You can have it on the rocks or frozen. If you're a tequila whimp like me, go with the frozen margaritas. The frozen mango margarita was super yum!Other than that the food was mediocre and could be better. You don't come here for the Mexican food.  The bacon wrapped rib eye skewer was deemed a favorite in the menu. In my opinion, it was alright but could have easily been better. It wasn't bad but it was missing the essentials of a rib-eye. It lacked flavor and the juiciness (I ordered it medium.) The arroz con crema was cooked in too much water so it had a soggy feel to it.  For just ok food, the prices are expensive but it's typical of the Meatpacking District.Now for dessert, surprisingly the dark chocolate tamal cake with roasted banana ice cream was super yummy.  On the other hand, the salted caramel tres leches could have been better. It wasn't dense like most others and lacked the essence of a tres leches cake.Don't expect much from the food here but go here if you want to have a good time over drinks or pregame before a night out! They also have outdoor seats like most of their locations, but come here early to nab an outdoor seat.It's a plus that Dos Caminos is connected to 675 Bar. It is so convenient to go downstairs right after dinner and chill at 675 Bar for more drinks and to shoot some pool.*Make sure to check-in Yelp for a free prickly pear shot!",1,0,0,Caroline C.,"Brooklyn, NY",381,311,298

As for my little side of guacamole, it was nicely fresh and tasteful but certainly not a large enough portion size for one. -Pollo Tacos (grilled citrus-marinated chicken, queso fresco, pinto beans, chicken chicharron, salsa suprema, handmade corn tortillas): these are quite tender and spicy. I'm actually surprised by how flavorful and good they are! Well done. -Refried Beans: these are good and the right consistency of bean to sauce.-Mexican Rice: ehh this seriously lacks in flavor.

Both experiences were nothing to right home about (so I'll write them on here). Dinner: chicken tacos were actually disgusting. Dry, plain, bland, and definitely not meat from the breast (funky). Tuna cerviche was weird, definitely more fit for a Japanese restaurant. We had two servers, both of whom were rude (they made a fuss when we tried to use the yelp check-in for a free shot) and we still couldn't get anyone to bring us a second round of shots. Brunch: food was better, but service was horrible. Had German, who decided straight off the bat, before he even talked to us, that he wasn't going to be pleasant and was rude the entire time we were there.

The drinks are delicious, the food good to very good, service is prompt, informed and attentive, and the atmosphere is usually great.. though I only visit Meatpacking so I can't speak to them.Most recent visit was a date set up by mutual friends last month. We each had three margaritas, her the Cadillac, me the Frozen Blood Orange. They are my go to Margaritas here.. A++.Foodwise, we shared some Spicy Guacamole and Chicken Taquitos. I thought the Guacamole could've been spicier but the Taquitos were the bomb.We both ordered the Carne Asada tacos at the bartenders suggestion and wrapped up with more drinks. Bill-wise, think I dropped $140ish plus taxes and gratuity on six drinks, guacamole, taquitos, two orders of tacos, and I think we had dessert, too.. I can't remember honestly and I lost the receipt.. or threw it out. Dos Caminos is always a good time. If you don't have a good time here, I'd never send you to my other Meatpacking ""go to scenes"" like The Ainsworth, Catch, Abe and Arthurs, MPD, Standard Beer Garden, or STK.

Perfectly tender beef and extra sweet and soft plaintains. The drinks are pretty amazing and strong as well.

I ended up ordering both a Mexican Star with muddled strawberries and prosecco and a Calle Fresca, a cucumber infused tequila cocktail with an ancho salt rim. My friend had frozen margaritas, all of which were delicious. The bartendar happily gave us a free shot of the prickly pear for checking in on yelp and also gave us an on the house margarita that people decided they didn't want on the other end of the bar.

To clarify, I ordered a chicken burrito and soup (the latter being the most ordered item from Dos Caminos on Seamless). The food was OK, despite the fact that the burrito tasted more like a pizza overflowing in marinara sauce wrapped in a tortilla and the soup was super sour.What really annoyed me is that when I showed up, I had to wait by the foyer for a good ten minutes before someone finally came to my service. This was after the fact that I gave them a good 10-15 minute wiggle room from the Seamless upper bound estimate. There were also no utensils included!But despite this first time experience, I'm gonna go back and edit my response because the staff followed up with my response and wholeheartedly mentioned that they are always looking to improve in order to ensure that our guests are always satisfied.

Started out with the traditional guacamole for two. It was delicious. three salsa that accompanied it were very good too and so were the chips. All tasted very fresh and flavorful. next I had the steak tacos, three tacos served on homade corn tortillas. They were just ok. Steak didnt have much flavor, and wasnt too hot, and they didnt put the guacamole on the taco like the menu said. The corn tortillas they were served on didnt have much flavor either and nothing to write home about. My girl had grilled shrimp tacos, which are not on the menu, that they made special for her because of her diet restrictions, which was also very nice of them, looked good, and she enjoyed them.

Perhaps your experience will be better but in my book, 3 strikes and you're out.  This chain has been going downhill in recent years.  I hope they get their gauc together!Bathroom rating 3.5/5",5,5,5,Jae J.,"New York, NY",87,89,28

Probably one of the best restaurant made guacamole I've ever had! Then we ordered some drinks and this crab cheese empanada thing. It was so good, creamy crab goodness.

I tend to avoid chain restaurants, but I'd heard good things about Dos Caminos, so I was totally ready for a good experience. I made reservations online, which was easy, but we were placed at a table right next to the waiter's station, which made for a lot of bumping into our table. Frustrating, but I was still ready to have fun. The complimentary chips and salsa were nice, but nothing amazing. We got the guacamole, which our waitress said was made fresh but tasted like it came from a jar. The margaritas were nice (I had the Calle Fresca and my friend got the El Camino), definitely the right amount of strength, although mine had more cucumber than liquid in it. When our entrees arrived, the food runner insisted on trying to make every single plate fit onto our tiny table, causing my friend's dirty plate to fall into her lap. Classy.I had the Dos Enchiladas (chicken enchiladas with mole). The chicken itself was delicious but the mole tasted like bottled barbecue sauce. I felt like I was eating something from a backyard cookout, not ""Mexican cuisine"". Rice was dry and had no flavor. We finished by splitting the chocolate lava cake with banana ice cream- our cake was less ""lava cake"" and more ""moist chocolate cake"". The lava cakes you can get delivered with your Domino's pizza are better. All in all, the meal was pretty terrible, and definitely not worth the $110 bill. The only real saving grace was our waitress- she was incredibly friendly, attentive, and even came up with a candle for the cake for my friend's birthday. She got a very nice tip. Bottom line?

They have a nice assortment of reasonably priced brunch entrees.  During brunch times, all entrees were served with a complimentary alcoholic beverage (also a nice variety of choices) and coffee/tea. The guacamole (we ordered this separate from the brunch menu) is delicious - the 1-avocado size served 3 hungry eaters. The waitstaff is courteous and very helpful in making menu choices.",0,0,0,Penny K.,"Bethel, CT",0,49,2
5.0,8/31/2012,"I went to this restaurant in Meatpacking before I had even moved to NYC and I remember the margaritas being fabulous.  They are still just a fabulous and just as deadly.  The interior of this place is so fun and our waiter was really hot so I was already having a great time upon arrival.The food just made it better!  We started with the roasted plantain empanadas with cotija cheese, black beans and chipotle aioli.  The empanadas were buttery soft and sweet on the inside with just enough aioli to add some kick.  Very rich though so I suggest sharing!My main dish was the Dos Enchiladas with roasted chicken rolled in corn tortillas, chihuahua cheese, mole poblano and tomatillo verde sauces.  I'm not huge on mole so I requested just tomatillo sauce.  Again delicious and a fairly large sized portion which was nice since this place isn't cheap.And of course I had a Calle Fresca margarita with cazadores blanco, mango, cucumber and an ancho salt rim to top of a great start to a Saturday night!  I will definitely be back.",0,0,0,Laura H.,"Sydney, Australia",412,394,3
3.0,8/28/2012,"Was jonesing for some Mexican fare today and the taste of tequila in my palate. Mind you I just came back from Mexico and yet somehow I did not get my fill of Mexican cuisine, but that's for another story.A quick Yelp check in yielded a free Prickly Pear shot - a nice champagne flute filled with what else, a frozen Prickly Pear margarita. Nice drink, great fruit flavor, and you can taste the tequila. This of course makes me happy. The Calle Fresca was a refreshing mango margarita with cucumber which my wife enjoyed as well.Dos Caminos has a large selection of tequilas and I was very tempted to try one of their tequila flights (blanco, reposado, anejo, staff pick etc) but thought to try this another time when I was feeling in more of a ""flighty"" mood.We ordered guacamole mild, and was perhaps too mild - it's a good thing they had a selection of sauces for the chips which saved it as it needed a little more kick. I ordered their Dos Enchiladas since it was the only entree with Mole sauce. Nice meal, moist chicken love the mole but not crazy about the tomatillo verde sauce. The pollo tacos if eaten without any sauce is quite ordinary, it would have been nice to have some crunch in it (perhaps some pickled fruit or veggies in it instead of the pinto beans) maybe I am just being too picky.For dessert, we tried the salted caramel tres leches cake, nice cake, too sweet on the caramel. I have had better tres leches at Pio Pio 8.All in all, a satisfying experience, good staff service for a slow afternoon. I'll rate it a 4 for the drinks and the wide tequila selection. Love the enchilada with the mole sauce but the rest of the food was a little flat.I'll have to come back for the tequilas another time :)",2,0,1,Jeff C.,"Livingston, NJ",9,66,62

Salsas are great. The guacamole, at $14 an order, was quite disappointing. Its made to order (we ordered mild) and tasted like mashed avocado and tomato. No hint of lime, salt, or anything else. Chips tasted like they were going stale. And after hearing so much about how good their chips and guac were, we were quite disappointed. The Durango was fantastic. A spicy margarita that has a really bold smooth taste. I almost ordered the chicken enchiladas with mole, but saw someone's tacos and decided to go with those. Also very disappointing. $19 for 3 steak tacos that had no real bold or interesting flavor. The presentation was great, but that does not make up for the lack of taste at such a price. What you're really paying for here is location. The outside seating is great, and I'd come back to enjoy another Durango or sit in the fantastic looking bar downstairs, but that would be it.

All the servers and waiters were very friendly though.What was eaten: the fresh guacamole with chips, sopa de lima, red rice, refried beans, mushroom quesadilla, dark chocolate tamal, crepas de cajeta, and the mexican star as a drink.The food was a bit bland. It tasted like food made by a good home cook - not a professional chef. I would honestly take Chipotle or La Esquina over this any day. I just expected MORE.However, what I DID ""LOVEEEEE"" was the atmosphere and the decor. Gorgeous modern decorations and the building is on an triangle island of a block, so it was an interesting shape as well.

Soooo amazing! Comes with 3 with grilled marinated skirt steak, Tecate battered rock shrimp, sriracha aioli, bacon guacamole. All of it together is simply delicious--the sriracha aoili really tops it off.My carne asada tacos were alright, but maybe that was just because they paled in comparison to the mar y tierra tacos.If you go with a group of 2+ more people and order entrees, they only give you one small side of rice and beans for the whole table to share.",0,0,0,Erin F.,"Manhattan, NY",1,15,2

So we go in, and everyone is crowded around the bar. Packed. Yet the restaurant had 90% of its tables open and a few people were still eating. So anyway, 99% of the people were in 20% of the space. I understand if you are not seating anymore due to the kitchen closing or something, but I just didn't get why it wasn't the dining room closed off or why they kept letting people into the bar area? It seemed to have so much potential. The bouncer was telling people to get off the patio, too, so there were a million outside seats that were empty. We could have had such an amazing dance party inside. It just seemed so random and badly organized. And drinks were $15. Which is fine, but make it a drink. With alcohol.

4.0,7/18/2012,"There are a number of reasons to come to Dos Caminos, but it is never the food. For example if an out of town friend would come to me and say ""I want to go to a cool restaurant with good drinks, people watching and a fashionable location"" I would say, ""Maybe we could go to Dos Caminos."" If I had a friend from out of town who said ""I want to try some really excellent Mexican Food,"" Dos Caminos would NEVER be in the running, much less cross my mind.Honestly, I do like this place for a number of different reasons. When you are looking for an al fresco spot in the Meatpacking District it is a great option. It is incredibly convenient and at a significant crossroads on Hudson, so you get really great people watching/outdoor atmosphere. It is also a fun place for a group of friends to kick back and have a few margaritas. The margaritas are pretty good and on par with the pricing of the neighborhood (keep in mind, it is normally a pricier neighborood). The service tends to be pretty ok, and the vibe here is usually pretty positive. The food is inauthentic and unimpressive on the whole. I have been for brunch a few times trying different dishes and tend to be underwhelmed. People really only talk about their guacamole. While it is good, it mostly just fresh ground avocado and spices...nothing really that outstanding.Still this is could be a good option for the reasons mentioned above and the fact that it does tend to be fairly consistent.",4,1,1,Mark J.,"Manhattan, NY",127,120,0

Hey, I told you not to read but thanks for continuing.  And were told to wait at the bar since it had not quite opened and would in 5 minutes. Did I mention it was completely empty. Well 20 minutes later we were still waiting even after watching someone else get a table. I than walked up to the bar  and ask what was wrong in that at this piont we had waited over 20 minutes in an empty Restuarant. No answer, but my wife had had enough so we walked a bit and had a great kindly treated lunch at Moran's. My wife is Asian of course my being white my daughter is mixed. You start to think that because of this you are almost invisible. I wish people at the front would realize that not everyone is built to complain when they have to wait. We are from the Midwest and were not raised to be like the a typical New Yorkers. I have lived here for over forty years. Why do people treat people in such a manner? Does the management not see this going on. The two young ladies at the front desk were just talking away like they were at a party. It was if we did not exist.

3.0,3/27/2012,"I found Dos Cominos to be somewhat of a flash in the pan, tinsel on the tree, lipstick on the pig type of deal; and a pricey one at that. Also, and maybe it is just me, but I found it to have a rather chainy restaurant feel about it. The service was at best rather inattentive when the place was anything but crowded, so I can only surmise it would be next to abysmal if not horrid when crowded. With the place practically empty the whoever or whatever seemed to have such difficulty figuring where to seat me I was simply compelled to forge ahead, setting myself. However, the wait staff does seem well trained with all the correct words and phrases. As for food, nice presentation but overall lackluster with the exception of a very, very good guacamole; nothing I would consider as approaching ""authentic"" but an OK Americanized representation of Mexican. As for drinks, I certainly can't complain as my top shelf margarita was indeed a very good one. Oddly enough, and I didn't think I'd end up having to say this, but the food and more particularly the service I've had at the Dos Cominos in Fort Lauderdale to be superior to this one located in New York City.

The location of this Dos Caminos is key because it's situated on the triangle between 13th and 14th so you're in the middle of it all and it's prime for people watching.

3.0,3/9/2012,"I've been to Dos Caminos several times since my first review ... in fact it's become my go-to place since I tend to stay right down the street from it. Bottom line: Host ALWAYS has an attitude, maybe it's because I'm always dining alone as I tend to come here when I first land in NY and am looking for food and rest before the work week. I have to fight every time to not be seated at a tiny / crowded cocktail table, Having said that, if you stand your ground you'll get a nice table in the main room, or even better, a cozy booth upstairs. The food is way better fresh than take-out. I always get the shrimp tacos, not the best ever but they have their own style and it's quite tasty - spicy with a fruity salsa. The guac is really good - don't bother spending the $4 extra bucks to get the spicy lump crab guac which is supposed  to be spicy (there is NO spice - it's bland and mushy) - I'd suggest sticking with the regular version (already pricy @ $14) but is quite good.They have a couple of really nice hot/spicy margaritas on the menu which are unusual. The last server I had went above and beyond, and even packaged up chips & salsa for me to take  with. She was awesome! Make sure you get the three salsa selection that comes with the tacos - they are all delicious - but I've had some servers ignore the menu which states it comes with the tacos and gotten nothing to munch on prior to taco arrival.This place is fun and tasty if you know what you want, and stand your ground to make sure you get it ... which is kind of a hassle considered the pricing ($17 for 3 shrimp tacos ... I'm sure there's much better in NY for way cheaper and would love to hear about them!)Enjoy!!",0,0,0,Christina M.,"San Francisco, CA",96,11,0
1.0,3/8/2012,"Dos Caminos. I've given you so many shots and frankly you still suck.My parents are drinking outside of Dos Caminos Meatpacking tonight and they invite my friend and I to come have some drinks and food with them. We tell my parents we will be there in 10ish minutes and when we get there we learn that the restaurant had a hard time finding chairs to sit us in at the same table. On our walk to the table we saw that there were chairs that were unoccupied at many tables throughout the restaurant and none of these appeared at our table. Eventually we get two chairs which was nice.My parents ordered some drinks that we on the table and drinks came out fast but when I got there I ordered some food. The food, no joke, took 35 minutes to come out. It was tacos, quesadilla and ceviche. I could have gone to the supermarket, come back and cooked all of those things in 35 minutes. After waiting all of that time the food was JUST mediocre. I don't know how this chain survives in the meatpacking district other than it lets people be seen but really who are you if you think you need to be seen that badly, get over yourself. Much like this restaurant, the appeal is all in the appearance and nothing else, there is no substance.The manager and the waitress both apologized, which we appreciated and offered us rounds on the table and/or desserts but really at that point we were ready to cancel our order and just leave. The food was mediocre at best, go to Mole better food, smaller restaurant but the quality of food is just infinitely better. My dad requests the check and good business practices tell me to comp someone something if they've waited far too long for food, we check the bill and NOTHING was comped. Really? That would have been slightly redeeming because it would have meant that Dos Caminos knows how to treat customers but they really have no idea what they are doing.Please keep in mind that both the waitress and manager were nice people, they just didn't know how to keep their customers happy.Not only will I NEVER walk into another Dos Caminos again but I'm sharing this awful experience, don't go there, waste of your time and way too much money for bad food - go get Chipotle or Calexico or Mole or Arribba Arribba for better food and service.",2,0,0,Alli H.,"New York, NY",172,596,53

They came out in the skillet but already mixed, all you had to do was put into the tortilla. Now this would probably be fine for every other person but for her, she wanted plain grilled chicken and the onions, peppers, sauce, etc on the side to create your own. She told the waiter and he was SO understanding, then the manager came over and apologized. It was really extraordinary how understanding and nice everyone was. Nothing was wrong with the food by any means she just had pictured the dish differently. They brought out the fajitas like 10 minutes later separated how she wanted and was very happy with her meal.

I went for brunch with a few friends, despite being warned by various other yelp reviews. We sat outside, ordered drinks and guacamole with warm freshly made chips and so far I was having a good time. It was all downhill from there.The waiter came over to take our order for four and didn't write anything down. This always makes me nervous. And sure enough, he messed up the order. My medium rare steak and eggs came out bloody. My friends rare burger had only a hint of pink inside. We didn't say anything because I don't mind rare steak and the burger was still juicy. This was the least of our problems. My food itself was just barely decent and came out lukewarm. The steak strips were thin and depressed looking. The beans on the side were a sloppy purée that lacked flavor. The home fries were actually kind of good, as were the fries that came with the burger. The home fries were hot and seasoned nicely and the French fries were also seasoned well with paprika and drizzled with chipotle aioli and cheese. The burger was enjoyed as was an order of chicken tacos. But I noticed the other order of sad steak and eggs was left a bit untouched as well. We picked more at the other dishes and were placated by the second round of drinks, some of which were complementary with brunch dishes. And by the way, two of our three rounds of drinks were dropped by a random waitress(?) who had to auction them off. And when we tried to ask about what types of liquor were served, the waiter had absolutely no clue what types of vodka or bourbon were served in house. In the end, we spent 65 each including tax and tip, and I felt extremely ripped off.As we left, I noticed tables being set with wet glasses and a waitress serving a table while she flashed her midsection because of an ill fitting shirt.

She would literally look at them for 10 minutes before coming back and forcefully questioning us, which is incredibly rude if you ask me. And when one of the IDs was a little worn off, she accused us of having tempered with it, and not serve us drinks. Which was ridiculous at best.Music was terrible, it was like a 15 y o girls iTunes list.Overall, dont go unless there isnt a single other place instead, even McDonals would be better, seriously.Dos Caminos; take a page out of any other NYC restaurants book on serving and showing people a good time, ffs.",1,0,1,Cem Y.,"Manhattan, NY",26,16,1

2.0,10/30/2011,"Friday was my first time at a Dos Caminos- unfortunately, it'll also probably be the last.  I came here after work with coworkers and ordered the red sangria, guacamole trio and queso fundido.  The sangria and the food were fine, but what was not fine is the fact that the server took away the guacamole before we were finished eating it, and without asking.  When I pointed this out, he just kind of stared at me and muttered something that did not sound like an apology.  He also did not offer to bring a new plate out.  Tip to server:  DO NOT take away any plates or glasses without first asking if the customer is finished.  Isn't that like Restaurant Knowledge 101?  If the plate had been empty it might have been excusable, but it was still almost half-full- and it also cost $18 for that fucking tiny guacamole trio!  The other thing I found annoying was that we ordered the plain queso fundido, but when it was brought out it had chorizo on it.  When I told the server we did not want the chorizo (which was an added cost), he said that the dish came with the chorizo on it.  We went ahead and kept it but I just looked at the menu online again and it does say that the chorizo is an optional add-on.  Second tip to server:  learn the freakin menu!  This place is way too overpriced for me to come back when the service sucks that badly.",0,1,0,Sarah K.,"New York, NY",3,37,1
1.0,10/24/2011,"We stopped in for a little lunch today and were really disappointed. We ordered spicy guacamole to start and it was completely bland. It wasn't just mild, it tasted like it wasn't even salted. The vegetable quesadilla was inedible. It tasted like old oil or a dirty grill. In any case, it was awful. The only thing worse than the food was the service. Our waitress carded us harder than a TSA agent. She took our IDs in the back for a few minutes to carefully inspect them... I expected her to come back and ask for our socials. We should have told her to keep the wine at that point. She was sour with us, in stark contest to how happy and animated she was when telling a story to her coworker. She lobbed the check at us in passing, but she did manage to wish us an ""awesome"" day as we left. She could not have been more disinterested or less sincere.

Not good impression especially after you already had a bad experience before.To make it short, we were seated after approximately 20 minutes and Kara, our waitress welcomed us. We asked for a pitcher of red wine sangria but Kara told us that a pitcher is only good for 4 glasses and if we gonna push it it is good for 4.5 glasses. We asked to try one pitcher so she replied mocking"" ok you just want then 4 glasses??"" I didn't like that answer and we accepted to get two pitchers. When the pitchers came, it was clear and very obvious that each pitcher can fill at LEAST 8 glasses which we did. I think that the staff should be knowledgeable of the size of the serving because it is very unprofessional to give wrong info to the customers.The food was served in a timely manner and was very delicious, and I am a big fan of the guacamole.The dessert also was great.My experience would have been much better if the welcoming hostess was nicer and our waitress was less mocking and more knowledgeable.

Anyways, we chose Dos Caminos since there were plenty of seats available outside and the weather today was beautiful. We definitely made the right choice!! Our server was very attentive and explained the specials and how brunch comes with complimentary cold and hot drinks. Really!? In Trendy & Expensive Meatpacking District??  I'M SOLD!!I got the Complimentary Prickly Pear Cocktail ($11 if bought separately) and my gf got the Grapefruit Juice. Both were very good. The server recommended we get some Guacamole which was made fresh in-house. At $14, it might seem expensive for some chips and Guacamole but it is definitely worth it!! We got the Mango, Papaya Habanero Guacamole which was SUPERB along with 3 salsas (Mild, Spicy, Extra Spicy) and a pretty good amount of tortilla chips. For the main brunch course, I had the Mexican Eggs Benedict and gf had the Omelette de Queso Con Chile Verde (Both at $13/ea). Everything was very good but the memorable food item was definitely the Guacamole they serve. To finish off, we had coffee as one of our free complimentary hot drinks. For all that, we paid $45 in total with tips. The server didn't rush us out or anything either despite others waiting in line and served us water constantly. We felt we were very attended and now thats what I call BRUNCH!!

The ambiance is great. Lots of candles and great 80s/90s music. In terms of food I'd give them a solid three. The guacamole had great flavor but I think the avocados were out of season. The carne asada tacos come three to an order. They were really good but in my opinion overpriced at $18. All in all I would go back to Dos Caminos again.

They offered us a table outside since it was a nice night (and this place was packed tight) and said it would be a 20 minute wait. Well we were 30 minutes early, so it works out. We were clearly forgotten about because at 8:30 I asked if our table was ready and the host behind the desk looked at me like he didn't know who I was. He told us our table was ""paying their check now"" and it'll be 5 minutes. 30 min later at 9pm I went back to ask about the table and they told us another 5 min. Finally we sit at 9:15 and I'm a little pissed and pretty drunk. But the guacamole and trio of salsas made up for it. I think we ate so much of those that we each only ordered an app or small main course to fill us up. Plus the Don Julio margaritas were very good too.

Why bother posting your menu on nycgo if you don't even honor it??Our waiter was simply a mess. We literally waited for 10 minutes for someone to at least give us water. It was only after he happily entertained the next table over that he realized we weren't being helped as of yet. He also got our guacamole appetizer wrong. We ordered the trio sampling, but instead got the traditional. Our group spoke pretty clearly, so there was no excuse for that mistake. I would've blew that off, but it took him forever and a day to come back with the right order. Our main dishes already came out by the time he returned. The guacamole was pretty good though.

4.0,7/15/2011,"I went both this location in Meatpacking and the Murray Hill one but found this one more to rave about.I went to Dos Caminos with a friend after work for drinks and had a great experience. We immediately jumped in by getting the guacamole trio (mango habanero, crab, and traditional) which looked small but proved filling and was delicious! Definitely some of the best guac I have had in a long time (and I am from Texas!). For entrees we both got the taquitos which were good but nothing too amazing.We also split a pitcher of sangria which was refreshing, had the right amount of fruit, and most importantly - strong. Great location with outdoor seating, ample room, friendly staff, and awesome ambiance. Only downfall would be price - our bill came out to $78 before tip which I felt was on the steeper side. But would most definitely come back again (to this location)!",1,0,1,David J.,"New York, NY",30,70,14

I had the pollo tacos and partner had the quesidellas. Both were okay but aside from the Mexican rice and bean sides, this would be barely above Chipotle or Qudoba. As for the service, our waitress was good but way over worked. They have several hosts and hostesses working at one time who don't seem to do anything except bitch at the servers and ignore customers because they're too busy wiping and arranging the menus.  I have never seen more useless staff members.  There was one ""host"" with a pink pocket square who was just horrible to the other employees.

But this is a chain restaurant, and you can definitely find good food in NY for cheaper elsewhere.The guac is also $14 for one portion - which they say is for 2-3 people, but honestly, can you really feed 2-3 people with ONE avocado?  $24 for the 4-6 portion.  Damn you Dos Caminos guac for being so tasty...despite my complaints, I know I'll be back.Other things of note: Waiters and hosts were super friendly and the outdoor patio was awesome at this particular location.  In summary, come here for the guacamole and drinks on the patio, but be prepared to lighten your wallet.",0,0,0,Anne L.,"Manhattan, NY",160,70,23

We ended up going for the tacos, fish and carnitas. Both were decent, but quite pricey ($17-$25) for three tacos. um. Sure... it's a sit down restaurant in Manhattan.

Brunch...a whole other better story.BUT, the Meatpacking one is different. I won't use this review to mention how much I miss Vento (why BR Guest did you have to play on your most profitable restaurant and get rid of the one I liked most??!)....but the space here is great. The majority of the tables are outside. And as most of us concur, outdoor tables give a minimum of ONE extra star.Lunch / dinner - The menu isn't bad food (recommend the fish tacos and quesadilla). I personally think it's a bit overpriced. But this is NYC ... and not everybody prefers the authentic Mexican food that I am accustomed to from ladies selling it in tupperware to you straight from their kitchen.Brunch...THEY HAVE THE MOST INCREDIBLE FRENCH TOAST. POSSIBLY EVER.  (YOU MUST LIKE SWEET THINGS TO ENJOY THIS - IT IS A DESSERT) For one, if you go for brunch (both days of the weekend) they offer a breakfast menu ($10 - $15 - I wouldn't rave about anything else on the menu but good enough) and lunch options (regular price) which includes one frozen margarita (no exceptions) and coffee or tea. What a deal!!!!! So, for ~$20 (give or take), you can sit outside in Meatpacking, have a drink, enjoy yourself and be fed.BUT I still haven't explained the french toast. It is life changing. Mexican french toast. Bread in egg and cooked like usual. Covered in rum and bananas. With a cajeta caramel sauce. And the whipped cream on the side is even caramel or dulce de leche flavor.

I went there with a couple of girls on a nice day looking to sit outside. The wait was too long so I agreed to sit indoors. There were 3 vacant tables on the first floor by the windows which would have been just fine. Instead I am brought upstairs which was almost entirely empty except for two large families with babies and little kids. Instead of being sat in a comfortably booth I am sat right next one of the families with screaming little kids. Food was ok but not as good as midtown.

3.0,6/4/2011,"I had a hot date with my GBF here and it was...quite the experience. The thing you have to know here is that I am not a Meatpacking District person. As soon as I realized where we were I was like ""WTF?"" but went with it.This Dos Caminos is enormous. When a place has their managers and hosts wearing walkie-talkies you know that it's a machine.We go in and are told it's going to be 45 minutes for a table. Fine. We go to the bar and have delicious (but overpriced) margaritas. Lo and behold, not even 25 minutes later, we get seated. Funny part was that the host was looking for another party and since he couldn't find them he took us instead. Awesome sauce.We get seated and it takes forever for us to be greeted. Again, the outdoor seating area here is enormous and it was gorgeous outside so I totally understood. Our server finally makes it over to us and I liked him because he obviously just did not give a shit. He was friendly enough but I could tell he was just over that night. I was not mad at him about it. He was very funny but I don't think it was on purpose. I just had to laugh because I totally understood where he was coming from. He was like the Lovable Asshole, if you will. Let's get to the point and nitty gritty here: Everything took...for.ever. Our drinks took a long time, our chips & guac, and our food? Get out of here. We waited close to an hour for our food. The great thing is that the managers came over and did damage control (sure, you can send us a round of drinks!) which was really great and saved this place from getting a 1 or 2 star. Unfortunately, when our food finally arrived one of the plates was cold. Lame. But again, the manager (who we found out was new and on his last day of training) was pretty fierce and, may I confess, very good-looking and charming.All in all, it really could've been worse. But it also could've been better. Hence, the 3 star. Had the managers not have made their presence known, I'd be ripping this restaurant a new one. I won't go out of my way to go there again.

3.0,6/1/2011,"I was sad to see Vento go, but my mourning was short-lived when I learned that Dos Caminos would be moving in. Having gone several times now, though, I can say that this location sits solidly in the middle (which is not as good as my ratings for the other three Dos Caminos locations). If you're going to go, go for brunch and order the Lemon Blueberry Pancakes, which are the most heavenly thing I've ever eaten during brunch. We went with a group of four on that fateful day, all ordering different dishes with the expectation that we would sample each others selections (or maybe that was just in my head). Anyway, our food came and those pancakes looked so good, we all had to try them ... but then we didn't want to stop and when my fork wouldn't budge from the plate, things got awkward.Other than that, the food is ok. The ceviche is delicious, the chips are too salty and the rest of the food is pretty standard (again, very sad, because I LOVE the food at the other Dos Caminos locations). But on a Friday or Saturday night, it is fun to go for a cocktail, listen to some salsa and enjoy a few appetizers while basking in the atmosphere ... and if you find your way downstairs and play your cards right, you might be able to slip into the club/bar that is connected below-street level while the other shmoes wait on line outside.

1.0,5/6/2011,"So the one saving grace of this place is supposed to be the Guacamole... but even that left A LOT to be desired for. If I can make better guacamole than the $14 one being served at Dos Caminos, then we have problems. I went with a friend and sat at the bar on a Monday night. It was a slow night and the bartender was very attentive, and even gave us free drinks when we said our Mexico City Quesadilla was too salty. And by too salty, I mean that it tasted like a block of salt... in empanada form...which is odd considering it's misnomer as a quesadilla. So, he gets an A plus, but even that doesn't make up for the overpriced & truly subpar food. Then I went again with coworkers for Cinco De Mayo and the service was SO slow. The restaurant wasn't packed, but it took so long for our food to arrive that half the people went back to work and had us bring their food to them. And again, the tuna ceviche and side of spinach I ordered was way too salty. How do you mess up a side order of spinach?

Sometimes when you're craving guacamole you head for the closest Mexican spot since, let's be honest, even Chipotle has amazing guacamole.  I went with 6 friends, who were all 30 years old on average, and we'd just come from happy hour at the Standard Beer Garden and decided to have a chill dinner where we could all get seated quickly. After ordering appetizers and drinks, the waitress cards us.  3 of 7 people had US IDs but the other 4 people were German and she said she had to get their IDs approved by the manager.  The manager, who's younger than we are, comes over and says that she can't serve them because the IDs looked different from the one's in her international ID book.  Really? Do you work for NSA, CIA, FBI, DEA, NYPD, TSA, Interpol, Scotland Yard, Homeland Security...no, you work for Dos Caminos.  On top of that, she wouldn't take a second form of ID like the Princeton Faculty ID my friend had or even a business card, which would give her a rough idea that we're not even close to 21 years old.  She would not be reasoned with and kept calling us Ma'm or Sir to which I replied if you think we're 20 years old why feel the need to be so proper unless you've already recognized that we're older than you are.   We walked out and ate at Spice Market, but she should be fired for being an idiot and turning away a 7 top of hungry people.",2,2,0,Suzie C.,"New York, NY",41,78,0

We didn't bring up all the items, but we brought up 3 of them, which equated to 25% of our bill.

A meal which should have taken us at max an hour and a half took just under 4 hours. 25 mins after we were seated and after I had to approach the hostess to ask where our waiter was, he showed up. He took our drinks order, returned about 5 mins later and gave us our drinks and walked off!!!  After flagging him down and obviously inturrupting his conversation with his co worker he took our food order..food arrived pretty promptly and from the time we got our apps until we had finished our entrees and the bus boy had cleared all our plates, we didnt see our waiter!! Not even to see if we wanted another round of drinks. We paid our check and left.So not only did they lose money on us sitting there needlessly for 4 hours, especially as they were turning away people as they had no spare tables, they also lost money as we would have had more rounds of drinks if they waiter had paid attention to our table.

I met my friend for lunch to go over some design ideas for a new business logo. We started with the guac which was the best part of the meal besides my water with lemon. For lunch I chose the tuna ceviche and he got a burger. The tuna ceviche was way too salty. Laden with the flavor of a salty soy sauce, I could only eat the pieces of tuna since the slaw beneath was drenched in it. Bleh. The burger was so big it was the size of his head and he could barely finish 1/2 of it.

Both times were during wonderful weather and I availed myself of the very nice outdoor seating (which was ideal for people watching). If I had stopped after the first time, I would have given Dos Caminos an exuberant five stars. My friend and I came for Friday afternoon coffee on our way to Chelsea Village for some wine shopping. Before the coffee, we were brought water and chips. They serve an interesting three salsas with their chips. It becomes sort of addictive going being the three, trying to pick your perfect taste. While all were good, we were there for late afternoon coffee! We were served by the radiantly beautiful, and friendly, Alex. She recommended the Cajeta cappuccino. It's made with a goat's milk caramel, I believe. There was mild sweetness to the caramel and an earthy flavor overall. It was the best sweet coffee I think that I had ever had. We split a dark chocolate cake that was huge, and out of this world. It was served with a pistachio ice cream that was a perfect compliment to the intensity and richness of the cake. Another very friendly waiter, Andreas, took photos of my friend and me. All taken, it was an amazing dining experience to remember forever. Unfortunately, I tried to recreate the experience. The next time I went during a very busy Sunday afternoon. The service was a shadow of the earlier attentiveness. However, I can forgive that: they were wicked slammed. What was sad is that the same Cajeta cappuccino was sloppy looking, overfilling the mug (dripping on the table), too sweet, and not hot. It was a little embarrassing, as I had talked the experience up to another friend that I brought with me. I still recommend trying Dos Caminos.

You have the option of ordering it with either shrimp or chicken, but I chose to have it as is. I followed it with the black Angus steak, which came with beans and a big tortilla. The concept of the tortillas was to take the steak, which came cut in small pieces, and wrap it with it, but they forgot to cut my tortilla into the more manageable pieces  that it was supposed to come in. Nevertheless the dish was delicious and balanced on taste.

3.0,7/8/2010,"Let me start by saying that I'm not a huge fan of overpriced Mexican food; and knowing Dos Caminos; that's what I thought I was getting... Surprisingly it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. We came here because of my constant thirst for Margaritas this summer. Food was decent. I had the fished tacos and they were a bit to spicy for my taste. The spice overpowered the mahi mahi and other condiments... I did enjoyed the Guacamole; thought it was better than other more traditional places I had it. Drinks were OK too; wished there were less ice in it; felt kind of robed by the amount.... Oh and the service it was the main reason I didn't give it a four stars... the waiter completely forgot our table after we were served. I felt like calling the restaurant and letting them know that I was still inside and needed some assistance. Dumbed as they come, specially when I was trying to get the check and sign for his tip.

Around 4pm, the restaurant was practically empty (common for any restaurant) & the host wouldn't let us sit at the tables to have just drinks & apps. We sat at the high top right next to the host table w/ a baby stroller. How un-hospitable. No server came over for at least 15 minutes. I ordered for my table at the bar all our drinks & appetizers. Food did not show up for about 20 minutes, it was guacamole & chips. Really?!?! The thing I love about NY is the fast pace service especially in an almost empty restaurant. The cook came out and brought the guac and the other appetizers, but no chips. Guac was great like always, but didn't even make it table side. boo!Service was absolutely awful.

We sat outside, that that was awesome.When we arrived, there was a 45 minute wait but I didn't mind too much because there was a big bar and plenty of catching up to do. I love me a spicy margarita (tequila infused with tequila) and theirs was great. I had two...Despite the drinks and the great conversation, the wait got a bit tedious.Some dude dude named Lars had a list and a clipboard and kept walking around finding people when it was ""their turn.""

We were looking for good food and good drink and the outdoor crowd looked like they were enjoying just that.We waited for an outdoor table on a gorgeous May evening; the vibe was cool, relaxed, and very accessible. Started with a house margarita (rocks, natch) and was convinced that we done good with our selection.Ah yes, the guacamole. I only started eating guac a few years ago, and I have to say that this is the best I've tasted. Creamy-smooth, mild-flavorful, can't-describe-goodness. I stopped at the hostess stand and grabbed a magnet with the recipe. I hope to acheive its greatness in my own somewhat capable hands.Ordered the skirt steak and enjoyed it very much, though I sampled the bacon-hugged ribeye. Woah. Amazing!

4.0,5/17/2010,"No one was more surprised than I was upon my insistence in having Saturday brunch at Dos Caminos' newest outpost in the Meatpacking District.  I'll be the first to admit that I slammed the Mexican mini-chain for wedging its way in to Vento's, an Italian restaurant, former space.  My big gripe was that, if it were up to me, a smaller-scaled eatery would have made 675 Hudson its home.  But who am I kidding? The rent at this specific address isn't exactly cheap, so at the end of the day, who better to maintain the neighborhood's most famous flatiron building than B.R. Guest Restaurants? Deidre and I met one another on the corner of 20-something Street and 6th Avenue.  We leisurely strolled to the restaurant, arriving promptly for our 12pm reservation.  Although DC's (Dos Caminos) interior space had, in fact, been successfully transformed from an Italian restaurant in to a Mexican eatery, we opted to dine al-fresco. Deidre and I were seated at an ample four-top table with a prime view, perfect for people watching, of the Meatpacking District. Our friendly waiter handed us brunch menus, filled our glasses with ice-water, and, in true DC upselling fashion, asked if we wanted to begin our meal with hand-smashed guacamole.  After quickly glancing at the menu for a price check (A bowl of DC's guac costs $12!  And that only serves 2!), Deidre and I decided that the chips and salsa basket, which would only set us back $5, would suffice.  And what better way to chase down a spicy dip and begin a Saturday morning than with a free, ice-cold, frozen margarita (or bloody mary, screwdriver, mimosa, champagne, orange or grapefruit juice, and coffee or tea), that accompanies all brunch entrees?     Not only did I find that the employees were friendly and courteous, but the service we received at DC was perfectly paced.  Our entrees arrived approximately 20-minutes after we received our drinks and basket of chips.  While Deidre chose the Wild Mushroom and Huitlacoche  Omelette, I ordered the Chilaquiles.  Messily constructed layers of red chile sauce-soaked tortilla chips were sprinkled with salty Chihuahua cheese and cubes of ripe avocado.  Two fried eggs and a spoonful of pico-de-gallo (salsa) topped the chilaquiles.I could hardly wait to pierce the gently-cooked egg yolks with my fork, allowing their creamy liquid centers to encapsulate every exposed crevice of the chilaquiles.  In composition, the tortilla chips revealed the perfect balance of crunchy and moist.  Compatibly, it was almost as if, during the baking process, the pores of each ingredient in the chilaquiles expanded to allow for the inhalation of mingled flavors. Aside from the overall fact that the entree wasn't as oven-hot as I would have liked, I was thoroughly pleased with my meal.For someone who had previously turned up her nose to the thought of ""Dos Caminos Meatpacking District,"" I have to admit that I was more than pleasantly surprised.  From the gracious interaction with the employees and perfectly-paced service, to the quality and value of our meal, I would recommend brunch at DC to anyone, foodie or non-foodie.",1,0,0,Lindsay F.,"New York, NY",376,277,184

4.0,4/29/2010,"Decor/Seating: I would love to have sat outside as it was a lovely sunny day but it was too bloody windy so we opted for indoors. As per most NYC restaurants, seating is tight but back to back rather than elbows so at least you can converse in relative privacy. A lot of dark wood and colourful seating creates a nice ambience. The restaurant is triangular with the bar at the widest end and two tops at the narrow end. The tables are on the small side for all that goes along with a Mexican spread.Service: I was very impressed. Our waitress was great and had no problem with the fact that we only wanted to order drinks and guacamole even though it was a fairly busy lunch time. There was an elderly gentleman with reduced mobility dining close by and I noticed that the waitresses were particularly attentive and went out of their way to make him more comfortable. That was nice to see.Drinks: Something to suit most people. I had a glass of the red sangria which was nice and my fiance had a good old Brooklyn Summer Ale.Food: As I mentioned already we only really came here to try out the guacamole. Like the other locations they make it to order. I asked for medium. Think I would try the spicy next time as there wasn't much of a kick in the medium. It was delicious however. The chips were nice but I prefer the more plain, pale ones. There was also a dusting of salt over them which I would ask them to hold off on in the future. They serve it up with three salsas on the side but we pretty much ignored these as the guac was so nice. I was kind of embarrassed at how well we'd cleaned the bowl - we just stopped short of licking it.I'll definitely come back to try some of the food in the future and will hopefully get to sit outside as it's well positioned for some great people watching.",0,1,0,Molly G.,"London, United Kingdom",1,22,0

The new location opened on Monday the 19th, and I was there with a group of 10 on the 20th. I called my excursion ""Brunch"" because, well, for us it WAS. We didn't have access to their specific brunch menu but we made what was available work. Double order's of the ridiculous Guacamole for the table made everyone happy. I grabbed an order of the Queso Fundido (which came with chorizo and roasted potatoe skewers) and made the entire table groan while hating me just a little bit.""I was on a diet...up until right now..."" replied a now slightly annoyed but incredibly happy friend. I don't remember what everyone had, but glorious reviews of the fish tacos were definitely heard. I had some sort of awesome beef/bacon concoction that i just tried to Google to find the name (and failed) which made me happy. The wait staff were all incredibly cheerful and very polite.
