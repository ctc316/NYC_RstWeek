1.0,4/29/2019,Went here for lunch with me and a friend. We both walked away with stomach cramps and just a couple of hours later we were both in so much pain and had the worst food poising.Wanted to give this place a try because it looked good on insta. They also charged $24 for an OVERRATED steak salad with soggy lettuce. My friend had ceviche that was sour and barely editable. Would strongly recommend against going to this place.,0,0,0,Kate F.,"Civic Center, San Francisco, CA",58,3,0
4.0,4/15/2019,"Such a cute little spot - a little pricey but would definitely recommend sitting at the bar for Happy Hour pricing for a casual yet intimate dinner!The Salsas de Valiente is a good starter - my preference is the salsa verde. The pork belly taco was succulent but on the smaller side. The duck flautitos are small as well and a pass compared to other dishes. The Papas a la Mexicans were a great side to complement the rest of the items, but the churros are a MUST order - some of the best I've ever had.Staff was very friendly and attentive, and they made celebrating my friend's birthday very special.

1.0,4/7/2019,"The terrible New York combination of mediocre food, tiny portions, terrible service, AND high ish prices. We ordered the guacamole starter ($20) and got  1/2 a cup of fine guacamole and some watery dips. Our cocktails were pretty good but they took over 20 mins. Our food (we all had the fajitas, not exactly hard to make) took over an hour and was so sub par that I didn't finish it. To make up for all of this, the manager sent over another round of drinks and forced tequila shots on us. We quite literally did not want to spend another minute in this restaurant so we barely touched the drinks and left. For the manager: when you have unhappy customers, don't send over MORE free drinks. Just comp the ones we already bought. Not everyone wants to leave their dinner blackout so they forget how bad it was.",1,0,0,Jack L.,"New York, NY",0,18,0
5.0,3/25/2019,"Will be back! Ordered the veggie quesadilla and added chicken. Even though we went a bit off-menu, this was our favorite dish! Rivaled by the tuna bites, which I could eat for days... We also had two drinks (mine was a smoky mescal mix take on a mule and his was the El Pino, which had a nice spice to it). The theme is fun - centered around a lottery game that's been played in Mexico since Colonial times. I walked away with a few pretty postcards.",0,0,0,Jackie K.,"Manhattan, NY",268,21,41

3.0,2/12/2019,"Came here thinking it was another place, which turned out to be right around the corner. I had made a reservation through Open Table, and when I was seated by the host, they asked if we wanted to be in the bar for Happy Hour menu or the main dinning area for the full menu. We chose the Happy Hour menu, but then they wouldn't verify my reservation for the points, which was kinda wonky tbh. The Happy Hour was fine prices for the neighborhood. It's an upscale taco place. Definitely splurge on the chips and salsas. The three kinds are truly delicious and they'll bring you more chips at no additional charge, which was a fortunate surprise. I got the pollo taco, which was good, not amazing, but pretty tasty. We also got the duck confit app which was super small for the price, but also tasty, so toss up on value there. It didn't get very busy on a Tuesday night. There are tables in the bar area for Happy Hour along with plenty of bar seating, and a large dining area for the full menu. I would recommend if you are interested in trying many different kinds of tacos that you do the Happy Hour where you pay per single taco and can mix and match, instead of on the full menu where you get two tacos per order and cannot mix and match those two.",1,0,0,Sarah B.,"New York, NY",103,159,40
3.0,2/10/2019,"This place have very good food. The service however, not good. The music was playing extremely loud. We requested to have the music turned down a bit so we could talk with each other. The water guy ended up spilling the water on my friend across the table from me. He was brand new so that is not a particular negative for me, as I understand learning can be bumpy.

4.0,2/2/2019,"Restaurant week lunch menu review:We went to la loteria on a weekday to a pretty empty restaurant. So we got to sit at the choicest corner. The space is very cute with motifs and unique decor.The restaurant week menu is quite expansive, unlike other places- so there is a lot to choose from. There were a lot of vegetarian choices as well, as is with all Mexican restaurants.We selected corn on the cob, empanadas and a queso dip as starters. Our mains were chicken & veggie tacos. The food was delicious and so loved the queso dip! The only issue we had was that open table had a $29 menu for lunch which included dessert but the restaurant had $26 menu which did not include dessert. But Our server was so sweet to bring us  a plate of churros on the house! This was an absolute steal at $26 per person!!",0,0,1,Garima K.,"Jersey City, NJ",159,138,150
5.0,1/30/2019,"Ok, so we came here yesterday for a friend's birthday. It was his 30th. There were 7 of us. The service was beyond outstanding. They let us come in early and decorate a little corner of the place by our table. They brought out our home made cake with candles, and then cut it and served it to us. They were super attentive in terms of refilling drinks, taking orders and bring the food out in a timely manner and I accidentally got a free wine. Didn't mind that at all. ;) [update: apparently they did charge for it, according to my friend. Oh well, still good!]In terms of the food, we started off with the guac and chips, and let me just say the guacamole was P E R F E C T. I'm not of Hispanic or Latin descent, but I am very picky about my guac. It needs to be seasoned to perfection, have right amount of lime, cilantro and onion. The avocado has to be fresh and the right color. This guac was all of that and beyond. I was starving when it arrived but it was just so fresh and yummy, I ate it like a maniac. Almost got full. Almost. If only it were so easy for me to get full. Oh, and it came with three little salsas. One was peanuty, almost Thai flavored. The second (my favorite) was cilantro and much like an Indian chutni. The third was tomatoey salsa. That one was ok. I had my standard Pinot Noir, while everyone else had cocktails and margaritas, so my glass got passed around the table for a ""smelling"" and everyone agreed it was going to EFF me up. And eff me up it did. Long story short, good wine. And everyone else loved their drinks as well. They have some fun margarita flavors like Hibiscus and Tamarind. Finally, the most important part. Food. The reason we chose this place is because they have so many great vegetarian options, and the birthday boy is vegetarian. I noticed on their menu that they also offer loads of gluten free options for Celiac peeps, which is nice. I had the Steak casadilla, suggested by the lovely waiter. My friends had the shrimp casadilla, the vegetable fajitas, the vegetable casadilla, the creamy rice and chicken and vegetable empanadas. All the food was very, very, good. All three varieties of casadillas were presented differently, which was cute, and there was no confusion as to which was whose. I only have two little comments. One is that the habanero hot sauce I requested was not spicy. At all. My spice tolerance is very high though, so factor that in. The second is that the empanadas are bit overpriced for what they are. I took a bite of each one, and for the price and the small size (pictured), I didn't find them exciting enough. Still, this place earned its 5 stars with excellent food, wine, and unmatched service.",0,0,1,Sophia H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,19,9

If you aren't sold yet, maybe there is no hope. La Loteria was a splendid experience; from the relaxed ambiance to the intricately crafted food and drinks.

5.0,1/27/2019,"There is no way anyone can call this ""average Mexican food"". Enchiladas with mole topped with grilled salmon; Vegetable Quesadilla with spinach, zucchini, squash blossoms, carrots, peas, beans with a delicate lacing of cheese and complex flavors; De Fideo Tacos filled with bird's nest pasta, avocado, cotija cheese, and whatever else; Tostatidas which are 5 light crispy disks almost like Mexican rice crackers topped with Mexican style chile-rubbed, pan-seared tuna, sesame oil, guacamole, chipotle aioli, mango salsa.Now come on: if that's ""average"", I want to live in YOUR Mexico. Outstanding service, outstanding food, outstanding dining experience. A bit pricey but can't wait to go back. I'd give it 10 stars if I couldUPDATE: We went back on the first Sunday night they had live music and although the food was just as delicious, the experience was enough to lose your appetite. Unless you know the musicians, DON'T GO. The volume level was that for a concert. The service was horrendously slow - after 75 minutes still no appetizers. Management please decide if you want to be a concert venue or a restaurant because you ruined our dining experience.

2.0,1/27/2019,"Note: this review is for Restaurant Week Brunch. been here before for regular service and the fish tacos are amazing, service on point, and lovely location.So came here for the restaurant week brunch, and was disappointed to hear the advertised deal was quite as expected (both online and the handed out menus were different than the deal we received). Picked this place for the 1 app + 1 brunch entree + 1 dessert option for $29 but was notified dessert was extra. Now don't get me wrong, I understand things change, but without this deal, I felt like we overpaid for the food we ordered. I mean $60 for a brunch is a bit much, especially with the mediocre French toast and smaller than average chorizo and egg burrito (though the latter was delicious). They were nice in explaining the menu change, but no adjustment to the price means avoid this place for the Restaurant Week Brunch.",0,0,0,Max M.,"New York, NY",391,33,20

2.0,12/14/2018,"My husband and I stopped in last weekend in the evening for some drinks and an appetizer. It was our first time here and I had been wanting to go after seeing the menu online. The place has a nice ambience-- dim lighting, nice decor and good music. I ordered the tamarind margarita to start with and it was pretty good. Our server was great at first but then never really came back to check on us for drink refills or to ask how the appetizer was. We could see our server chatting with the bartender and other employees and using her cellphone. We were able to get the bus boy to come over to the table and asked him if he could get our server so we could order more drinks. After several minutes our server came back. I ordered a michelada and while I'm normally a fan of them, it tasted like the bartender had dumped a whole bottle of Worcestershire sauce into the mug.  We ordered the empanadas and it came with 2 small ones for $19. While the flavor was okay, I can't say I'd ever go back to eat them again. If we ever come back I think we'll sit at the bar top to avoid being ignored by a server and stick to the margaritas.",0,0,0,Lindsey B.,"Indianapolis, IN",1,34,28

3.0,11/27/2018,6/10 La Loteria has a great location in the West Village. I met a few friends here for a drink and dinner. I ordered fajitas which I found to be pretty average.

I order the prix fixe lunch of the chicken tacos, salad and elotes as the side. I also ordered their classic guacamole and a blackberry margarita. First, the guacamole-amazing. You'll want to lick the stone bowl once you're out of chips. Second, the house salad has all kinds of little treats on top and a sweet yet spicy dressing. Third, the chicken was a crispy chicharrone and had guacamole and a wonderful sauce on top. The tortilla had literally been made to my order. The corn was wonderful. Lastly-the blackberry margaritas was extremely satisfying. The wait staff is friendly and lovely, and for the area the prices were more than fair.

4.0,9/10/2018,"Came here for Happy Hour around 5.30pm. It runs until 7pm at the bar with an extensive food menu. We enjoyed $8 margaritas (a good-size tumbler!) and $7 trio of salsas which were unique (one had peanut flavor!) but almost puréed, rather than the chunky style I realised I prefer. The chips were so-so (bland, not much texture) but a generous portion. My boyfriend ordered a few tacos which were two-bite size ($5-6 each from memory) - the fish was excellent he said while the one with angel hair pasta was 'interesting'. He was underwhelmed by the actual taco, but also, he's been to Mexico. I had some seasonal vegetables ($7) which arrived as a sautéed medley of corn, peppers, mushrooms and greens. It was much tastier than I'd expected, especially when I topped it with some salsa! The interior was really nice too, cool and modern without being sterile. Staff were friendly and attentive too without being overly intrusive. The only thing missing was guacamole... but based on our good but average food experiences, I'd probably check somewhere else out before returning here.

It was relatively quiet when we came, so we had a pretty nice chat over some tapas. Ceviche de Pescado ($7)- 4/5 This ceviche is based on their daily catch of the day. I believe it was sea bass and it was quite tasty. A little sour since it's cured in a green citrus base and has tomatillo, pickled cucumber, avocado, corn tostada, but I enjoyed it with the chips! And the portion was good for 2 people to share. Tostaditas de Atun ($7)- 4/5 This comes with three of these bite sized Mexican style pan-seared tuna with guacamole, mango salsa and flour tostadas. They're really small but delicious and have a great mix of texture (crunchy from the tostadas) and soft and juicy from the other ingredients! I could have easily ate several of these. De Pescado Baja Style ($6)-4/5 Mexican beer-battered catch of the day- the fish was fresh and came out nice and hot. They give you two pieces of fish.I like how they wrapped it so the ingredients don't fall out from one end, like many tacos. This comes with a green sauce as well, which was tasty.

We waited for almost 10 minutes on the table and since no one came we moved to the bar area. The $14 guac was average tasting with no salt and the drinks as I mentioned earlier was expensive.

4.0,5/4/2018,"A tad skeptical about this restaurant given the high prices. However, Tuesday afternoon, this was the easiest place to get dinner outside that wasn't too packed. After first getting the menus, took a little while for our order to get taken (still a lot of people considering the nice day outside). Settled on the Salmon Tacos (2 for $15) and a Skinny Margarita ($14). Again, the prices make my wallet hurt, but was hoping for the best. Skinny Margarita comes out first - refreshing with bits of cucumber inside; just not as strong as I'd like. Tacos come out next - two well presented tortillas wrapping a filet of salmon, guac, and several fruit sauces/accompaniments. Gotta hand it to them, the taste is outstanding - wonderful combination of fruity spice on top of the fish. The side of hot sauce provides a great kick and is addicting.Service picked up towards the end and water was refilled periodically. The tacos here are really good, plus the guacamole looks amazing.

The chicken tacos were pretty dry according to my friend too and the barboca tacos were good but not great. Seating is a bit crammed in here and it can get loud.

Dish Ordered: My partner and I used the Restaurant Week 2018 Brunch menu. We ordered unlimited mimosas as well. I ordered Esquites, Huevos Rancheros, and Flan. He ordered an empanada, chorizo burrito, and churros. My food was flavorful and delicious. Probably the best Mexican food I've tasted without feeling heavy or overloaded. My partner commented that this was the best he's tasted in terms of quality.Service: Everyone was extremely attentive. We ordered unlimited mimosas and had our glasses constantly refilled for the next hour. Was neither too pushy nor too distant.

I went for restaurant week and loved that they had a lot of vegetarian options; what I didn't love was that the appetizer that I got had the same vegetables as the entree like there are no more vegetables in the world? The other reason why I don't give it five stars is that the service was very good but the waiter seemed to forget about us from time to time.

5.0,1/29/2018,"Best Mexican restaurant in NYC!  I go to ""La Loteria"" almost every week.  The food is truly exceptional. Chef Julieta Ballesteros elevates traditional Mexican dishes using French techniques as a way to enhance flavors and aromas.  I like to think of La Loteria as ""elevated Mexican"". To start you must have the guacamole combo. The delicious guacamole can be topped with different meats such as tuna tartare, pork cracklings or rib eye.  It also comes with a trio of totally unique salsas: Chile de Arbol, tomatillo and, my favorite, spicy peanuts. The margaritas are to die for, especially the tamarind one. Not too sweet and slightly tart. Make sure you ask for the spicy salt on the rim. The duck confit flautas is one of many signature appetizers, they are served with mole sauce, a traditional Mexican spicy chocolate sauce.  If you decide to have tacos La Loteria is famous for its fish tacos made of lightly fried sea bass. It comes with a delicious cole slaw and a cilantro based salsa.  If you are on a diet you can ask them to grill the fish instead. The barbacoa taco made of braised beef cheek is super juicy and literally melts in your mouth. It comes with a smoky salsa. Yum!My absolute favorite entree is the sea scallops. They are always seared to perfection and accompanied with huitlacoche mushrooms (Mexican truffles) and pan de camote (Mexican corn bread).  For desert, well it's a toss up between the churros filled with gooey deliciousness or the silky Mexican flan. Just have both!!!",1,0,0,Pascal A.,"Sunnyside, NY",185,4,0

The veg fideo taco, while having nice flavor, I didn't really understand. I guess noodle tacos are a thing somewhere. Carb bomb--perhaps ideal if you are planning to run long distance the next day.- Guac with fried pork belly was very good though pork belly needs to be even crisper--it also loses crisp as it sits in the guac.- Ceviche was quite average--not up to the creative standards of the other dishes.- We didn't order but saw the enchiladas going out and they looked amazing.Great service though room is loud at night and seating is pretty cramped.  Lunch menu has many fewer items than dinner menu though if you ask nicely they may do dinner items for you for lunch.",0,0,0,Cd S.,"New York, NY",15,136,3

The interior is casual, sort of quick in and out type of place.The menu is quite diverse with all the favs from Mexico. I really liked the variety of guac options with a number of meat mixes. From wanting everything on the menu we decided on ceviche, fish tacos, and braised beef tacos. There are two pieces each which was a little concerned about but when they came out they were really large! There's only one way to say this, fantastic! The food has a very clean taste while not taking away from the authentic flavor profiles. The sauces are excellent too. The green one is very much like an Indian chutney!

4.0,11/16/2017,"When my friend asked me to get together for a taco dinner, I mentioned how I had been curious about the Mexican fare at La Loteria, and we agreed to check it out.  Our experience began with addictive, salty tortilla chips and the Traditional Guacamole, which we both found too watery, due to an over-zealous about of lime juice.  I also ordered the La Rosa cocktail, because what chip-and-dip combo would be complete without a cocktail pairing!  The tart and smoky drink included tequila, mescal, and fresh blueberries.  It was so delicious that I actually wound up indulging in two of them.Then, it came time for our taco extravaganza; since each order came with either 2 or 4 tacos, and we wanted 3 each, we decided to get 3 of the 2 tacos portions and share them.  The De Barbacoa contained tender, but slightly dry, beer-braised beef cheek, though its flavor was enhanced by the addition of caramelized onions and cilantro.  The De Fideo tacos were like nothing I had ever had before.  I knew that fideo was similar to a paella, but using small pieces of pasta in place of rice, however, I had never seen that noodle dish stuffed into a soft taco shell!  The pasta was topped with a tomato-jalapeño cumin paste, avocado, cotija cheese, and a Mexican cream.  Plus, we added sautéed mushrooms and spinach for substance.  Lastly, the De Pescado Baja Style variety included Mexican beer-battered catch of the day, jicama coleslaw, guacamole, and a valentina aioli that added a brightness to the fried fish and caused them to surprisingly be my favorite of the trio.La Loteria definitely satisfied our taco needs, but, just so you set your expectations, it did so at a price more in-line with a high-end Mexican restaurant than a taco joint.",6,1,4,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

5.0,11/2/2017,"Great Mexican with a modern taste. We stopped in during our walk from lower Manhattan to Penn Station on a random Thursday night. The place had a decent amount of people eating, which gave it a busy vibe, but we were seated promptly inside since the sidewalk seating was open during an unseasonably warm autumn evening.  The hostess originally tried to seat us at a tiny round table for two in the center of the dining room, but we asked to be seated at one of the many rectangular tables along the window, which were more suitable for dinner. This was my only gripe - plenty of empty tables and the hostess kept trying to seat patrons at the least desirable tiny round tables. We ordered our wine from a limited, but quality, wine menu and ordered the traditional guacamole. Very fresh and tasty; the red onion and creamy avocado mixed perfectly with the generous portion of tortilla chips. For our meal, we ordered the most delicious sea-bass tacos, which were beer battered and fried, served in a soft taco shell with savory coke slaw and spicy aioli. Despite being deep fried, they retained a light fresh taste. We also shared a small plate of Tostaditas de Antun, which was chili seasoned seared tuna poké (my description, not theirs) with mango salsa and spicy aoli. Delicious. Everything was seasoned in a balanced way with the fish complimenting the creamy aioli and spices in both dishes. The service was good as well. Our waiter was attentive but left us to enjoy our meal.

Nice decor, outdoor seating is offered.  Started with a margarita, v.basic and didn't seem made to order - not sure if it was part of a bulk made ""brunch"" batch or if this is the regular margarita. Salsa trio & guac - guac was delicious salsa trio we only liked the green one.  At $19 a little spendy with a small bucket of chips (we asked for more).Chicken & fish tacos - all were delicious and ample portions.  If you can ask for the cilantro sauce that comes with the fish tacos  to go with the chicken tacos it goes really well with them too :)Huevos rancheros were FABULOUS but if you are giving me a side of beans I would prefer to have the option to choose rice with them rather than homefries. I have had huevos rancheros a lot and these were very well prepared.Waiter was fine but was very focused on working it with the table of lovely young lady brunchers next to us.  Not sure if his charm overload worked but it kept our table of teen girls entertained.  Will be back - hopefully for the dinner menu next time!",0,0,0,Deb E.,"Guilford, CT",8,168,302

We started with some sangria and chorizo fundido. Both were on point. I especially like the chorizo fundido. Then we ordered our mains. 2 of us got the chorizo tacos and shared a side of rice and beans. The tacos and beans were amazing. The rice I could've done without. Also, the tacos are tiny, but they are extremely filling! My friend got the enchiladas. She said it was really good and she especially liked the potatoes that came on the side.

We went for Happy hour/dinner as it was an awkward time where the restaurant was open but the kitchen was closed so had a cocktail and waited till they started serving food. The margaritas were okay for the happy hour price. We had the ceviche which was flavorless and empanadas which had a weird seasoning and were cold inside.

No coincidence that it's Cinco de Mayo or was it tumtumtum lol.The place was definitely packed. Wasn't sure if I was able to get a table but, I knew I still had a little force in me left from yesterday to especially convince the host to give me a table (Star Wars pun; May 4th) lol.Tonight's menu was dedicated especially for Cinco de Mayo. Got myself the guacamole with fried skirt steak as add on, the fish ceviche, and lastly; there wouldn't be a celebration without a margarita (opt for the tamarin flavor instead of the traditional). Service was absolutely wonderful. Considering how busy they were, I was impress with my server. Didn't get her name but two thumbs up to her. The guacomole was wonderful, the flavor was on point and the skirt steak had a nice crisp on the outside and very tender on the inside. The ceviche, another wonderful dish. Had a great balance of acidity and saltiness.  Lastly the margarita was pretty good. I don't often drink mix drinks, but when I do; I can definitely tell a good drink from a bad one. This one was not just good; it was pretty good. Don't just believe what you're reading, go experience it yourself is my say. Cheers!",2,1,0,Sattra C.,"Baltimore, MD",72,115,375
1.0,5/5/2017,"My husband and I live nearby, and we've been here a number of times for dinner. We're respectful patrons - we're polite, we order a lot, we tip well. We've brought several of our friends. I tried to go this Thursday on my own for lunch - no activity at the bar, and the dining area was half empty. I walked in and another woman walked into the restaurant right after me. The server, a young woman, saw us come in and asked if we wanted a table for two. I told the server we weren't together, and then the woman behind me walked past me further into the restaurant - I think that woman wanted to see a friend or colleague who worked there. The server tended to that woman - the server tried to make a phone call, presumably to the woman's friend who was working there? - and then a man came out from the kitchen area (another server? the host?) and he began chatting happily with that woman. They began chatting back near the kitchen. Meanwhile...I'm still waiting to be seated. I've come here enough times to know that you don't just plop yourself down just anywhere without any direction. I'm hoping a host or that server will get to me next - instead, the server brushes *right* past me, not saying a word, and starts wiping down tables in the dining area. In the half empty restaurant. She had acknowledged me when I walked in, but was now ignoring me - I've said nothing other than ""no, I'm not with that other woman"" -- so what do I do now...start waving my hands, begging these people to seat me? I was flabbergasted - I was a server for years, and I would never consider treating anyone that way. I am standing there, awkwardly, still by the door, as some customers finish and leave. The server says goodbye to the customers leaving, but still not a word to me. One customer who was leaving seemed sympathetic - he had been watching and the situation was SO awkward -- I mean, what restaurant openly ignores a customer waiting to be seated? In front of other customers? What restaurant tends to some people walking into a restaurant, but not others?  The customer leaving the restaurant hesitated as he opened the door to leave, perhaps pondering whether he should keep the door open for me because it was obvious I was wondering whether to leave or not. I finally took that as a sign to leave. I thanked the other customer for opening the door for me - I was grateful to get a little kindness from a stranger after that experience.",0,0,0,Rea D.,"Manhattan, NY",8,107,13

It was perfectly crowded, not too many people swarmig around us. The music was loud enough to create an ambiance. We ordered the queso flameado with mushrooms. BOMB. So cheesy and rich in flavor, in a small skillet. Ofcourse we had to get the guacamole with chicken since one of my friends doesn't eat pork. Also super delish. Our third dish was the ceviche de pescado. Excellent and light,   great for the spring!!  && but obviously margaritas to pair our Mexican dish.

4.0,2/1/2017,"Came here with the bf for dinner during restaurant week and had a great experience. Ambiance: Small restaurant overall and isles near tables were pretty tight but the decor of the restaurant gave it a very chill and comfortable vibe. There were some interesting displays of art on the walls and around the restaurant that had me scratching my head but no big deal. There was also a bar with seats, which had happy hour until 7. I tried a passion fruit margarita which was delicious and definitely had its share of tequila. Food: Let me start with the BEST part of the night. The duck confit flautas were the highlight of the entire meal, and I wish they were made as an entree instead of appetizer. Perfectly crisp, a good portion of duck in each bite, and covered in a sauce that had me scraping the plate. I mean, who doesn't like duck and flautas? So paired together, it as a match made in Duck heaven. Me and the bf both ordered the fish tacos as our entree and while he seemed to enjoy them, I couldn't get through 1 whole taco. The slaw they put on it had a weird taste and the fish itself tasted bland, as if it hadn't been seasoned. Dessert was also meh, but possibly because I'm not a big fan of flan or churros. I would definitely go back to La Loteria simply for the duck flautas and because the server I had was very professional and really made the night a special one. Next time, I may opt to sit at the bar for the delicious happy hour margaritas and my duck. Quack!",19,11,14,Robin T.,"New York, NY",294,321,668
5.0,1/30/2017,"To be honest, I swung by here because I needed a quick/local restaurant week lunch after 2 pm, and on review I noticed a free margarita was included :). I am glad that I made an appearance, as this may go down as my favorite recent Mexican meal in the village, and definitely my best restaurant week meal in some time.It wasn't that busy as I strolled in wtih my brother and friend, but I enjoyed the decor which reminded me of Mexico City with all the funky skulls and day of the dead ornaments. The restaurant week menu included a margarita or beer to start (curious what they'd offer if you wanted something non-alcoholic). The margarita was quite good and on the stronger side, but I had nowhere to be afterward. They really did have quite a few choices for restaurant week on the appetizers and main dish. For the appetizer I wnet with the Empanada filled with  Calabaza y Huitlacoche Squash. Inside the fried bread was plenty of chihuahua cheese and bell peppers, this was a great juicy start to the meal! For the entree I got the chicken tacos.  I thoroughly enjoyed the sauces and extras put on them. It was two well sized tacos with guac, cotja cheese, and grilled pineapple. The chipolte aioli added just the right spice to it.Finally, I ended with a very soft baked flan, for once a restaurant week desert was normal size :).The waiter was nice and very patient as one of my friends asked a million questions, and they even made his fish tacos grilled on request.  To me this is what restaurant week is about, finding a spot in your own hood that you may not normally try for whatever reason and have a reason to come back.",5,5,4,Alan B.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",302,453,12

My dad was visiting so wanted to take him somewhere a bit different than our usual go-to Italian meal. Arriving at 5:30 on a Sunday evening, we were the only ones for quite a while - so needless to say, the service was great.The food, on the other hand, wasn't my favorite. The menu was a bit different than your typical mexican restaurant, which was fine by us. We started with the Guacamole Combo, which was guac and a trio of salsas. The guac was decent, but the salsas all had a similar taste, and seemed to be cream-based. I tend to like my salsa more fresh and tomato-y. The peanut one was interesting, but didn't feel like I could have (nor did I want) more than a few bites of each - too rich. We then shared a bunch of items from the menu: The Wheatberry & Veggie Salad (not enough veggies in my opinion, but flavorful, although had a creamy dressing), the Vegetariano Taco and sides of the Refried Black Beans & Rice with Fideos. Maybe we didn't order right, but all of the food just seemed too rich to me. I felt like they all had some sort of creamy base or similar mystery ingredient. After the salsas, I needed something on the lighter side. I told my dad my favorite part of the meal was the tasty soft corn taco shell!I understand I was at a mexican restaurant, which typically isn't a ""lighter"" cuisine, but mexican food is one of my favorites, and unfortunately La Loteria just didn't sit right with me.",0,0,0,Danielle P.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",1,11,0

We started with passionfruit Mojitos and varying flavors of margaritas. The drinks were all pretty good... Although some of them didn't come out on time. Which leads me to my next point: the service was pretty terrible. It took my husband exactly 1 hour to receive his drink--and when we brought it up to the waiter he didn't really seem phased. We ordered guacamole for the table and a trio of salsa with chips... They were all very tasty-highly recommend them. As far as the entrées, I ordered the shrimp quesadilla which was good but not the most amazing thing I've ever had and some of my fellow diners ordered fish tacos and chicken enchiladas. The fish tacos was alright but not vey flavorful--the sauce made it better. Overall, it's Mexican food... It's kind of hard to screw up. If you're in the area definitely check this place out.

Food wise, everything was great! I am a huge avocado fan, and I personally was slightly disappointed by the guacamole.

The Guac is absolutely delicious but it's the salsa trio that blew my mind. They had a peanut variety which was my favorite. They have a super spicy one and a green one which were all flavorful and tasted like nothing I have had before.  We also had  the ceviche and veggie empanadas, which were both fantastic. The tacos at this place are where it's yet ! We didn't have a taco we didn't like. They serve their tacos in 2s and 4s. We tried the Baja fish, pork and veggie tacos. All the tacos were FANTASTIC ! I cannot remember the last time I had such tasty veggie tacos. We also tried the veggie enchiladas ! They were good too. We had a couple of sides as well, corn on the cob and the Mexican fries. The Mexican fries are so different from regular fries, doused in some kinda amazing sauce and they look like stubbier versions of the potato finger. You have got to try it. For dessert we had the churros and a sponge cake soaked in some delicious condensed milk kinda liquid, I forget the name.  The sponge cake was my fav dessert of the night. They served it with pecans and strawberries and it was the bomb.

4.0,9/29/2016,"My boyfriend and I decided to give this place a try last weekend. Perhaps it's because I'm not super familiar with the West Village but it was pretty tricky to find and was not located on 7th Ave where it appeared on google maps. Anyway, after the directional debacle we finally made it there, and I was impressed instantly with the ambiance. It was a warm day, and all the large windows in the front where open letting in a lovely breeze and showcasing the warm, dimly lit romantic inside of the restaurant. We decided to sit inside, but the outdoor seating was ample and looked great as well. We started with cocktails, the Hibiscus Margarita for me and the El Catrin ( Maker, ginger, agave and lemon) for him. His cocktail was pretty average and mine was too tart, not sweet at all. I mentioned this to the waiter, who happily added more agave, and it was awesome on return!  We had the guacamole for an appetizer, which was good and a very ample portion ( little guac appetizer portions are a pet peeve!). We weren't super hungry to we shared the shrimp tacos ( sans bacon for him) and also shared the sauteed scallops. We wanted to try the lobster ceviche, but sadly they were out. We added a side of plantain that came with a very unique dipping cream. Everything was awesome! We ordered the smaller size for the tacos and the scallops, so we didn't leave super stuffed, but it was just enough. For hungrier parties I'd suggest ordering the larger sizes. We didn't opt for dessert, but the menu looked awesome, so I'd love to try it next time. All in all a solid spot, with great service and a lovely ambiance.

Came here for a bottomless brunch with another couple. $25 bottomless margaritas for an hour (with entree) or $20-25 (with entree) for bloody mary's = a great Sunday afternoon.. not to mention that the drinks were delicious.Everything was delicious actually.. We had the guac and salsas combo as a starter and everyone really enjoyed it. Followed by fish tacos - they added an extra taco for us without an extra charge (SO AWESOME - tacos comes in 3s and there were 4 of us). Our waited was absolutely amazing. He was very attentive, sweet and funny. He gave delicious suggestions and helped us make all the right choices to enjoy our meal. I had the eggs benedict which were cooked to perfection. Although next time I come I think i really want to try the french toast (I am still thinking about how delicious it sounded).

Shhh, I didn't tell you about this place. They even have a happy hour menu with quality options and for a bargain!My friends already were seated and I joined them easily at a high 4-top table next to the bar. I ordered a margarita ($6), which was refreshing and well made. Throughout the night, I had two more to help cool me off from the warm weather (finally!) and to wash down the yummy snacks we ordered. Guacamole is excellent here ($5) but the portion was a bit small, so we ordered two servings. It comes with plenty of tortilla chips, which was way more than necessary for the amount of guac we ordered. We also ordered the tostaditos de atun, ceviche de pescado and a side of yuca fries (all $5 each). Tostaditos were tasty especially the atun and loved the accompanying chipotle aioli. I would pass on the ceviche as it didn't taste that fresh to me and it was quite hot the day we came here. So just be cognizant of ceviche on warm summer days. And you can't mess up yuca fries ever and the habanero aioli gave everything a nice kick! My friends also ordered some fish tacos ($5 each) and they both loved it.

The margaritas are delicious and this place is definitely worth stopping in for a drink if you're in the neighborhood. ($6 margs at happy hour). With that said, there were some misses on the food for me. The guacamole is far too creamy/whipped- it was mixed to death to be frank. Keep chunks of avocado in your guac!! I got the fish tacos as my entree. They were good- not great. An authentic tortilla would be nice rather than that generic store brought tortilla you can buy in your local grocery store. My boyfriend got the chicken enchiladas and thought it was a little odd that the chicken was not inside the enchilada-- there were just tiny strips on top. We got an order of the plantains on the side. I thought they were extremely tasty, however there is no need for powdered sugar on top- they are sweet as is. Our waiter was extremely nice, approachable, etc. The service was just way. too. fast. We were barely half way through our guacamole and salsa when our entrees were served-- and I was half way done with my one drink I ordered by the time we finished eating.

1.0,4/13/2016,"Hubs and I ducked in here for a late dinner. Both of us having grown up in Houston, if there's one thing we know well it's Mexican food; and hubs can never get enough of it. Mexican food should never ever be pretentious; it's a humble food prepared with love, and simple ingredients. A Taqueria should be the least pretentious of Mexican eateries. The closer to the border you get, the more divey they get. Jokingly, the quality of a Taqueria can be judged by its colorful vinyl chairs, jukebox blasting festive norteño mariachi, your inability to communicate with your waitress due to a language barrier, and menu selections made by their picture. Chips & Salsa are ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS bottomless and complimentary. I can tell you having grown up in a state that was once part of Mexico that not being greeted by a bottomless bowl of chips and salsa is unheard of and may be taken as sheer heresy. We ordered drinks. Hubs a sangria, and I a beer. I popped for a Negra Modelo, a well known favorite to Mexicans, and a decent beer. We ordered the guacamole as an appetizer. The guac was spot on, a massive portion but the $14 charge isn't even in the realm of reasonable, its borders on extortion. The profit markup on a $14 order of guacamole is insane! Hubs ordered chicken tacos of some sort, and I the barbacoa. Barbacoa... Another beloved delicacy enjoyed in my home state usually on weekends. Most New Yorkers wouldn't touch the stuff if they knew what traditional barbacoa was made of, or the manner in which it is prepared; but the ensuing result is typically ethereal. Barbacoa is usually served unassuming on a warm corn tortilla with little more than a few diced onion, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime... Perhaps a bowl of menudo too if you've got a hangover to cure. This barbacoa tasted like nothing more than pot roast. A real disappointment. When I was handed the bill, I nearly had a stroke. I can honestly say this was a life's-first for me. Never in my life have I ever had to fork over $50 for four tacos, an order of guacamole, and two drinks. No self respecting Mexican would ever pay anywhere near that. I can assure you as I am standing here that I could easily get that same amount of food from a taco truck for less than $10 and of much better quality. This was a lesson learned in two ways: If I want good Mexican food now that I live in NYC, it's going to have to come from my own kitchen, and secondly I got ripped off big time.",1,7,0,Clayton H.,"Queens, NY",26,89,13

4.0,3/21/2016,I stumbled upon this place as part of search for locales near West fourth. I was surprised to see an upscale Mexican restaurant a block down from the popular Caliente Cab. That being said...Loteria has a following and if you're going on a Friday or Saturday night.... Make a reservation. The decor hints at Mexican culture rather than immerse you in it. It's ambience is more hipster modern than ethnic. (Still a pretty place though) It is VERY small so be mindful if travelling in large groups and the space can get loud... The more crowded it gets.The food was wonderful. Beautifully presented and portioned well. The mole sauce made here is key. I had the enchiladas with skirt steak and I was very satisfied. Steak was cooked perfectly and the dish was very well flavored. Their signature cocktails are great. Be sure to try one ( or two). Service was friendly and ticket times were reasonable. Loteria is a little pricey if you're looking for a laid back food experience. But if you're in the market for a fresh spin on great Mexican food...

What we got:A lot of different margaritas. these were fine. decently strong. but nothing much better than you'd get anywhere else. the fruit flavored ones were just using fruit juices from a box instead of muddled fruit which you see sometimes (and usually has a fresher taste). Tacos:Shrimp. They were made with baby shrimp. that's right, baby shrimp. like the kind you would see in crappy hole in the wall chinese take out fried rice. I don't even remember what they tasted like b/c I was so blown away by this use of cheap ingredients.""rib eye"" - so they say. these tacos had meat diced so finely and basically stirfried with onions and peppers it resembled a filling of a philly cheese steak without the cheese. needless to say not impressed.fish - these were ok but the battering on the fish was really thick and i just thought they felt too greasy and heavy. they were at least generous with the amount of fish in them, but maybe i was fooled by the sizes of the fish b/c they were so thickly encrusted with batter. Dessert sampler - average quality selection of mexican desserts. the churros had an elegant drizzle of hershey's syrup, like the one you get from the supermarket. Do you honestly think I'm going to think a thin, watery artificially chocolate tasting drizzle is anything else? come on.Service was very friendly but the food was really phoned in.

The food was out of this world -- the chicharron was cooked to crispy perfection, the fish was lightly battered and delicious, and the toppings on each taco were fresh and tasty. The presentation of the food was also very nice.We weren't sure how big the portions would be so the 3 of us ordered two small (2 tacos each) and one large plate (4 tacos), and let me tell you it was FILLING. Everyone was stuffed at the end. Now, the main point of writing this review was to give a special thanks to the man (not sure if he was a waiter or another staff member) who came by to check how everything was. Earlier in the night we had actually moved tables because the corner we were in was too noisy to hear each other speak, and the seating was a little awkward. We moved to another spot, but later in the night a group of people at the bar started really getting loud, and it got hard to ignore them. The staff member saw us, brought us a dessert of churros on the house (also excellent!) and was just SO nice and apologetic.

I was worried about the size of the aforementioned $5 fish taco but the thing is huge and it's fried so it's super filling.

As we sat down we ordered from the pre fixed menu (which had a lot of options!) and the food was served to us promptly. For starters we got the Mexican style corn- which was so flavourful and juicy, along with the baked cheese with chorizo. Everything was seasoned perfectly and tasted great. Loved the extra stringy cheese!!

Instead of featuring a slew of traditional Mexican cusine (nachos, burritos, etc.), La Loteria has an eclectic twist on your favorites: fish tacos, squash and truffle empanadas and home fries, for example. The drinks are equally fun -- though I would recommend the blackberry margarita over the skinny iteration any day.

I love that policy and it's much appreciated. The guac is above average but the waiter kept trying to take our mostly eaten bowl away. There was a ""solid $4 worth of guac left"" as my friend described, so that was a bit upsetting. Sadly we did not get any complimentary salsa for the table.I ordered the beet salad which was a good size portion and a nice lighter balance to the heavier chips. A couple of my friends ordered the fish tacos and raved about them. They were beatifully presented, almost like mini burritos. The menu is not clear but you can order either 2 or 4 tacos. I would suggest the restaurant offer 2 or 3, as these tacos were generously sized. Minus one star because for our large group, a 20% tip was automatically added. This was a bit steep given the guac controversy, so please consider reverting to the standard 18% tip.",0,0,0,Mina S.,"Manhattan, NY",21,37,2

When we ordered the bottomless drinks- it took 20 minutes to get out first round. We ordered an appetizer.....one hour later it was still not there. We were finally the last people in the restaurant- and we still had no food. I asked the waitress for an ETA, she gave me an annoyed look and then finally went into the kitchen. Finally our food was ready (this was over an hour after ordering).I think she had forgotten about our food. Mine was cold entirely. I wanted to ask them to pop it into the microwave or something, but decided that it would take another hour to get it back.

The salsa de cachuate enchilado (peanut) was a pleasant surprise. My dining companion enjoyed her guava flavored traditional margarita. The reason I am only rating my experience at 3 stars is because of the execution of my entree; I ordered the Enchiladas Callejeras and my companion the Tacos de Pescado Baja style. The entrees came out within 5 minutes of our order which seems a little fast and made me question how pre-made our entrees were. In my dish, the mole sauce was excellent but the panela cheese in the enchiladas was tepid and flavorless. I believe the plain enchiladas were made well ahead of time hence lacking an opportunity to absorb the flavors of the mole. I was underwhelmed by a dish that seemed to have a lot of promise.

It makes things easier for people with food allergies or sensitivities.I had 2 starters:Guacamole Combo: it's the Guacamole traditional served in a stone bowl and chips, with a trio of specialty salsas - de cacahuate enchilado (mild), salsa verde cruda (spicy), roasted chile de arbol (very spicy). The cacahuate enchilado is made with peanuts, chilies. It's the most pleasant to eat because it's mild. The verde cruda is made of raw tomatillos, cilantro, jalapeno, garlic. The chile de arbol is made with tomatoes, arbol chilies, cilantro, onions. The guacamole is a good complement to the spicy salsas. La Loteria Crudite: fresh cut jicama, cucumber and carrots topped with special chili powder blend, served with lime sauce and cream. The jicama is crunchy and juicy like an Asian pear.  The dipping sauce is sweet and tangy.

We were seated right away at a cute booth along the wall. Our service was OK but with a mandatory 20% already tacked on I'm not sure how above and beyond the guy went, see wine faux pas above. We ended up ordering WAY too much food to the point that we cancelled some of our entrees because we were getting so full. It turned out to be the way to go because the entrees are definitely the weak link. We started with the trio of salsas and both the regular guacamole and the guac with chicken added. The salsas were very tasty and the quac with chicken was an interesting change. We ordered the ceviche de pescado which was fabulous and I'm not a ceviche fan. We also had a few orders of empanadas, both the de papa con chorizo, ab fab, and the de flor de calabaza huitacoche also very good, well made with a bunch of great flavors.

2.0,6/6/2015,"I really like La Loteria. It's a very welcome addition to the neighborhood, and in a city with very inconsistent Mexican good, this place does it right. The food is consistently delicious and the service is very good. The reason I gave this phase a 2 star review is because I was very disappointed the other night when I went there on a date. It was a Friday night and not too busy when I got there, but filled up over the course of dinner. As usual, the food was delicious and the service was great. After we finished with all of the food we ate, we were sitting for no more than 5 or so minutes when a hostess (I believe she was a hostess), gave us one of those, ""I'm so sorry but we have people waiting and need you to leave."" There was at least one open table and no one was waiting at the door, just at the bar. My date and I got up and left, but we were there from start to finish for just over and hour, and I thought this was rude. If we had been lounging for 30 minutes or something and showed no signs of leaving, I get that, but this is really bad customer service. For a place charging an average of $15 for two smaller sized tacos, I'm very disappointed. I have raved about this place to friends, but now question if I will return. I'm sorry, La Loteria, but this is just not acceptable in my opinion!",1,0,0,Jake R.,"Manhattan, NY",134,7,0

3.0,5/25/2015,"3 1/2 stars. La loteria is good in a sea of some either pretty bad or overpriced Mexican food in the west village area. But it is not without it's problems. Pros: the happy hour. Great prices. $6 margs (+2 for flavors like guava and blackberry) $5 stone bowl guacamole. Guac was creamy, fresh, with a good kick of spice to it. The rest of the good options, fish tacos, tuna tostadas, sea bass ceviche, elote, all delicious. Restaurant has a cool relaxed vibe with windows open on nice days (I was told outside seating is on its way!) Presentation of all was beautiful and the fish tacos were really really good.Cons: why are individual tacos $5? That's steep. Anywhere. On happy hour that's ridiculous. The classic margarita was a strong pour of tequila which is great, but it looked more like a screwdriver or a mimosa than a margarita. Their mix was so heavy on the orange juice we were drinking pulp with tequila and that I didn't like. The ceviche while tasty had such few pieces of sea bass in it it felt incomplete. Definitely lacking. Service was attentive and friendly, yet a bit lost. They couldn't answer simple questions, didn't know what bourbons were behind their bar, and brought out silverware as we were getting our meal. Not a big deal, just a bit disjointed. Overall: delicious food with great presentation. $5 stone bowl guacamole is a steal!! Skip the classic marg and go for a flavor or the sangria.",2,2,1,A Z.,"New York, NY",62,404,26
5.0,5/24/2015,I have lived in LA and NYC and this is the best fine Mexican food I have ever had! I am still dreaming about it. I've been here twice now- once for brunch and once for dinner. Hands down best brunch ever. Period. For dinner- The squash blossom empanadas were delicious as well as the main course scallop dish. I had a jalapeño margarita...ok maybe 2... That was perfectly spicy and flavorful. Not too sweet. I think the bartender said the tequila is infused with jalapeño in house! Our bartenders were friendly and attentive and I love the atmosphere. Kind of modern rustic with some great black and white gorgeous floor tile. i just can't believe this place is in my neighborhood and doesn't have a line out the door.,0,0,0,Joolee T.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,20,11

4.0,4/10/2015,"I went to La Loteria for the first time last night - it is not in the best/busiest location of the West Village, and could be easily missed. I'm glad that I stopped in, and will definitely tell my friends about it so that they can try it too!We started off with cocktails: the El Soldado Magarita (a jalapeno margarita) and the El Cottoro (a Gin/Rosemary/Lime/Basil drink). Both drinks were very good, but had way too much ice and seemed a little watered down. Next time, I will ask for less ice to see if that solves the problem.We split one small plate as an appetizer: the Tostaditas de Atun. I loved this dish, and highly recommend it. It is tuna, sesame oil, chipotle aioli and mango salsa on corn tostadas, served over little dollops of guacamole. There were only 5 tostadas on the plate though, so keep that in mind when ordering.We did not get any guacamole, but the table next to us ordered the Guacamole de Puerco Enchilado (served with pork belly and chile ancho dust), and it looked incredible. It was also a very big serving.I got the Pork Belly Enchiladas as an entree. I thought that it was great -- at first, I thought the way that it was served was pretty odd - the cheese enchiladas were served over potatoes and peas, with the pork belly on top of the enchiladas (as opposed to inside). However, once everything was cut up, it went together very well. I would recommend this dish, and the only complaint is that I think the potatoes were too filling for the dish - I would have preferred to have them on the side.We ordered a side of the Yuca Fries, but they were nothing special - I probably would get the plantains next time.I definitely plan to come back to La Loteria in the future.",0,0,0,Kristen H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,21,0

After ordering our carefully crafted cocktails, we glanced over the menu and wanted to order everything in sight! Partly because we didnt want to over do it, we opted for the finger-licking-good Guac (with pork belly chunks), the over-sized Empanadas, the Barbacoa Tacos, and the lobster filled Quesadillas...not to mention the grilled corn and cinnamon and sugar dusted plantains for sides. What can I say, it was a feast to say the least.For dessert, we ordered the Churros, the Flan and the Guava mini cheesecakes - we were not disappointed by anything!!

3.0,3/15/2015,"To start with the critique I gotta say it bothered me that the pork belly pieces in the tacos were literally all fat, to the point we thought they were diced potatoes. I get that that makes for great flavor and texture but I'd like to eat more than just cubes of lard. A little more protein in there please. The corn side was an absolute star, I'd dare anyone to find better. Perfectly seasoned and charred.The flautas were delicious though the masa could have been a bit thinner like the authentic kind. The different salsas were amazing. The jalapeño infused margarita was excellent though not hot enough. I got very little kick from mine which is really the point of this margarita.

I cannot wait to go back and get them again. I would give this place a five if it weren't for the fact that there was a slight mess up with our order that left us short a few tacos but I think it was just extra busy and also there were changes to the menu that weekend so that probably was the reason for the slip up.

The food was all well prepared and the portions were generous. The issue here is the service. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas right when we sat down. The margaritas were average tasting, being a bit too sweet for my taste. However, we finished the pitcher while having the appetizers and were never offered any additional drinks. The servers never checked on us to see how we were doing, so we never had a chance to order anything more to drink. At $60/pitcher, this is a huge miss for the restaurant, since drinks are where they make all their margin.

5.0,2/15/2015,"The other night I went to La Loteria for the sixth time since it opened.  With so many options in the Village alone, I could easily go somewhere else, but the food so good, we wanted to go back and try almost everything.While I have been here before, I am glad that I held off on doing a review until now because while the food has always been top-notch, they recently finished putting the finishing touches on the restaurant and the setting is now just as good as the food.  Since my last visit textured wood was added to two walls and mirrors with an antique finish were put up near the bar.  Between the Mexican artwork and overall design, the finished result is a beautiful spot to enjoy some excellent food.On our most recent visits, we enjoyed the guacamole, which is served in a traditional molcajete, which seems to be made from volcanic rock.  So many places serve this Mexican favorite, but many miss the mark.  Thankfully, Loteria's version is perfect and just the right start to a meal.Speaking of starting a meal, the cocktails are another treat here.  Often, I steer clear of the cocktail list because the drinks sound so good and then usually disappoint.  The Alacran, made with Tamarind infused vodka and triple sec, was definitely not a disappointment. La Dama was another great cocktail. On to the main event.... far and away my favorite entree is the scallop dish, which is truly amazing.  It is called Callo de hacha al huitlacoche negro, which is diver sea scallops served atop huitlacoche, which I learned is a Mexican delicacy, a truffle that grows on the corn. It's velvety smooth and I think the ingredient that makes this dish so delicious.  Under the scallops and the huitlacoche is a sweet potato goat cheese corn bread, which pulls everything together.  So, definitely make sure you try this when you go to Loteria.Another hit in my book is the lobster quesadilla. In addition to lobster, this dish also includes black beans and chihuahua cheese and a guava-morita chile paste.  The paste adds a bit of sweetness that's a different touch, but it is definitely another great dish.After all that, Loteria's desserts are also exceptional.  I got a friend who usually skips dessert to join me for the crepas and I heard no complaints. That dulce de leche was so good with a touch of salt!  And there's flan, which is another perfect ending.  I liked that it was not the gelatinous type of dessert that flan can be, but actually had a firmer texture somewhere between flan from Spain and cheesecake.  Two thumbs way up for Loteria's version!As I've already said, Loteria does not disappoint in the food department.  I am happy to report that the same holds true on the service front.  The staff is very helpful and efficient.  I also enjoyed a couple of meals at the bar where the bartenders were very helpful with drink and dinner suggestions.  Even when there might be a slight slip-up, Loteria is quick to remedy the situation.  Shortly after their opening, there was a very small mixup and the chef came out to apologize and gave us her card and said to let her know if we came back.  I thought this was very classy.  Another time it was a busy night and the food took just a little longer and the bartender came over to say he would go back and check.  Such service is a mark of excellence at a restaurant and Loteria gets it right.While the West Village has added a number of restaurants recently, I would definitely recommend a visit to Loteria.  And then maybe a couple more...

Didn't enjoy getting elbowed in the back every two second. Cons- weak drinks. Definitely do not order the sangria.- wait time to get the guac was about half an hour for each order..not that hard to make fresh guac.- taco orders are VERY small. Appetizer size really. Two tiny tacos for an entree price. The thin, soggy tortilla reminds me of a store bought one. I much prefer homemade tortillas.- don't get the beet salad. It was overcooked and dull. It's also again a very small salad.- enchiladas missed the mark. Covering it in mole sauce didn't help either.- quesadillas were average.- HORRENDOUS customer service. There's a way to communicate the wait time to your customers. If you say it's half an hour, it should never be TWO hours. I HATE when restaurants lie about the wait time to get you to spend more at the bar. - the wait time continued to be unacceptably long once we sat down. We came in at 7:30p. Didn't eat until close to 11/11:30.- the manager needs to learn how to be gracious when she's wrong.

All staff and servers were extremely friendly and attentive. I came with a party of four on a Friday at 7pm for dinner. I had made a reservation just in case it was crowded. When we arrived a 7, it wasn't too packed but closer to about 8:30pm it was full. I definitely recommend making a reservation. The food is excellent. I tried the De Fiedeo Vegetarian tacos, which were two tacos with thin pasta and tomato-jalapeno cumin sauce, sautéed mushrooms, spinach, avocado, cotija cheese, and crema. It was certainly one of the more unique selections on the menu, as I've never had thin pasta on a taco before. It was delicious! My friends tried the pork belly tacos, fish tacos, and the Flautitas de Pato. They loved their dishes and raved about the pork belly tacos. We also received an espresso sized cup of black bean soup to try on the house.  The drinks were also delicious! Between the 4 of us we tried the traditional margarita, jalapeño margarita, and the Michelada. They were all super tasty.  I will definitely return to La Loteria!",3,0,0,Kaitlin B.,"Manhattan, NY",77,139,0
5.0,1/28/2015,"Two thumbs up!! To quote the random guy sitting next to me at the bar "" This place is definitely going to be my new local!""The drinks are great. My favorite was the jalapeño margarita. Just enough of a kick. The bartender Dustin definitely makes the best ones in my opinion. Plus, he was very attentive and super friendly. The food was also great. I couldn't get enough of their queso fundido. What's better than a gooey bowl of melty delicious cheese? And they use the real stuff, not that terrible yellow/orange ""cheese"" so many places use. They also provide fresh homemade corn tortillas. Their pork belly tacos are also great. I can't wait to go back and check out the rest of their menu. Definitely worth checking out.",3,0,1,Denise O.,"Astoria, NY",71,14,40
5.0,1/24/2015,"Mexican food at its finest with exceptional customer service. Extremely impressed for a new establishment. Ok, I'll admit to the the potential for a bias review here, hell, I know the owners and one is actually my neighbor and a friend. But he also knows I along with my posse are all picky eaters and never one to hold back. So, I've been following his journey to finally getting his first eatery off the ground for close to two years now, so figured I'd give him at least a month after opening before paying a visit. And boy oh boy, why did I wait so long! Just an incredible experience from the time we arrived until we left.Being a Thursday night with a full restaurant was a first good sign for new restaurant. It's a great location in the west village and the interior and design layout present a modern chic laid back Mexican feel.  Airy with big windows that when open will make for an even greater vibe in spring and summer. But enough with the aesthetics, for when venturing out to a restaurant, what really matters is the food! And happy to say, La Loteria delivers here hands down!We were offered a few margaritas to get the party started and they were on point! If you're into Margaritas you wont be disappointed. Menu consists of starters, small plates, tacos, entrees and sides. We started with the Guacamole tradicional, which came with warm chips, this has to be some of the best guacamole i've ever tasted in a restaurant. Soon to follow were Empanadas/De flor de Calabaza y Huitlacoche, light perfectly cooked and delicioso! Next up was the Ceviche de Pescado but we had it with Shrimp instead, another winner. As a follow up, soon to arrive was the De Pescado Baja style, its an incredible delicious taco with Mexican beer battered fish and just oooh sooooo good! And the final act, out came the Quesadilla de langost estilo Rosarito, this is sauteed lobster with other ingredients packed into a a flour tortilla which was one of my favorites. After dinner drinks were a few shots of some of the finest tequila this side of the border. And all the above reasonably priced with exceptional service. Everyone in my party thoroughly enjoyed themselves and were totally impressed. Can't wait for a return visit to try out more of the menu! Truly is a great find and next time you're looking for some great Mexican food in a very cool spot in the West Village, La Loteria should be your only choice. I'd be sure to make reservations because once the word gets out, I foresee difficulty in easily getting a table here. Hopefully me knowing the owner will help! Hey, don't hate, we all use those connections when we have too! :)",2,0,0,Anre G.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",8,50,77
5.0,1/22/2015,"Great customer service. Came here for lunch. Was pleasantly surprised at how tasty the food was. Excellent customer service. Our margaritas were a little tart but we enjoyed the food so much we didn't mention it. Then the waitress brought us two on the house. Maybe she read our minds? Either way great experience. Between the two of us we had sent plantain, creamed spinach and poblano soup, queso  with chorizo and queso with mushrooms. We also had guacamole. Corn and Mexican rice on the sides. The rice was the only thing that could have been better",2,0,1,Chantelle W.,"New York, NY",105,22,19
5.0,1/20/2015,"This place is amazing! Its my favorite new spot. I went there for dinner the other day and the food was out of this world, my favorite was the duck flauta...so i went back again on Saturday, this time for brunch and everyone of my friends was crazy about it too. I tried the guacamole with ribeye (delish!!) and the chilaquiles, incredible!! Also, their churros are to die for!... The service was so nice and attentive i will definitely become a regular!   Love love love it!",1,0,0,Vanessa V.,"Brooklyn, NY",46,15,4
5.0,1/11/2015,"Wow, I was pretty impressed, my first visit, and I'm a local west village foodie.  The guacamole is a must, I recommend the chicken guac.  The tacos were delicious; I had the shrimp, and the sangria was great.  Look, there are a ton of Mexican good places in the neighborhood, however this is one of the only ones that not only felt authentic, but caters to the picky foodie's of nyc.  It's only a matter of time before the world finds out about this place; but its affordable, creative, and good vibe will surely be a hit!  I only hope it doesn't get impossible to get a seat post the grand opening.- foodie Paul",4,0,0,Paul H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0
