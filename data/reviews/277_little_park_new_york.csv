3.0,3/24/2019,"My friend made a reservation for 8ppl on a Friday evening.  The hostesses were warm & friendly and the waitstaff was great being professional and on top of everything with the orders, keeping water glasses full, and drinks flowing. The restaurant has a lovely warm & contemporary look and feel.  I read some reviews prior to dining here and the bad ones were true.  Portions are small.  My husband & I ordered 3 apps and 2 entrees to share.  Although delicious we were still hungry after dinner that we munched on leftovers when we got home.  It was a pretty pricey dinner for the portion size.  Also there was a long lag time from the apps to the entrees.  My friends said that brunch is great, so I might try that some day, but I wouldn't go back  for dinner.",0,0,0,Brian P.,"New York, NY",4,72,4
5.0,3/23/2019,"This place is amazing! The perfect farm to table restaurant serving delicious cocktails in a beautiful/nature like ambiance. Loved the food though portions are not big (as expected) for the price. The presentation is outstanding (with flower pedals in our desserts!). This is exactly what I was looking for when making a reservation for a date night with my husband. We also got one of the best seats in the restaurant that was a corner booth (so neither one of us stared at a wall, we both looked at the beautiful restaurant).

The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because although the food was perfectly fine, I just didn't think it was worth the pricing. I understand that this is an upscale restaurant, but even so - I didn't leave feeling sure that I would recommend it to other people.I went for lunch on a Friday and got the Sullivan County Chicken.It was $36 for 3 pieces of chicken.

5.0,2/3/2019,"Solid spot. My first time dining was back in 2015 and I remember the food being great, so when I saw an open reservation spot for Friday night, I decided to check it out again even though I typically try to explore different restaurants as opposed to going back to the same one. The ambience is great for both date night and group dinners.I didn't realize that it was Restaurant Week, so it was a 3 course meal for around $45 + $12 for wine. We both decided to opt for the prix fixe. We ordered the salad and squash soup to start. Salad was a good portion and had anchovies. Soup had ginger in it, so it was spicier than I had expected, but good for a cold day. For our mains, we had the sunchoke risotto and the fish (I believe it was sea bream). Both were excellent, and the risotto was very filling despite the smaller portion. The desserts were decent but nothing to rave about. One was a parsnip cake and the other was an adffogato. Overall, a great meal.",0,1,0,Rebecca L.,"Manhattan, NY",23,50,29
5.0,1/31/2019,"Space - very pretty, warm and cozy (esp on a brrr NYC night).Service - hostess warm and sweet. With reservations, seated us right away. Our waiter was spot-on efficient. Had an incorrect charge, thanked us for noticing and took care of it right away. Other wait staff excellent in clearing dishes, refreshing water. Really excellent service all around.Food - Obviously this is why you go to a restaurant, and meal was SPOT ON. Friend and I took advantage of their Restaurant Week menu. I take advantage of many a NYC RWs...and this was one of the BEST.First, the presentation of each and every course was exceptional. Truly gorgeous works of art.With all the great reviews, we had to have the roasted brussel sprouts - and yes, the masses spoke, and we right - so yum! ""crispy brussels sprouts with smoked parsnip, apple cider, currants"". Roasted to perfection with nice size portion to share. So good that you want to eat it all, but save room! There is still more yum to come. (We wished we only ate 1/2 and saved it as a gift to ourselves for the next day!)From the Restaurant Week menu, for starters, I had the squash soup with peanut, turnip, curry leaf. My friend had the heirloom beet with ancho chili, avocado, beet chicharron. Everything was so fresh, with an glorious combination of unique tastes.For the main course, I had the sunchoke risotto with mushrooms taleggio vin cotto, a type of wine sauce. My friend had the ""Sullivan County chicken  thumbelina carrot, salsify, swiss chard"" (look up sullivancountyfarms website - nice!) Again, can't stress the gorgeous presentation enough (pictures next time!). But the tastes...omg...really so much thoughtfulness by the chef on each ingredient coming together, complementing each other.For the dessert, we both had the parsnip cake with carrot, rum raisin, and cream cheese ice cream. Again, beautifully prepared, and the cream cheese ice cream beautifully complimented the carrot cake (don't fear the parsnip ;-)""Foodgasm"" as my friend told the lovely hostess upon our departure!",0,0,0,T L.,"New York, NY",4,27,0
5.0,1/17/2019,First to note -- service. Which is FANTASTIC. Our waitress made our experience amazing. I took the squash soup and beet salad. Perfect flavor. Perfect amount.

4.0,1/14/2019,"Food: Probably the best part about my experience. I tried the beet salad to start which was simple, maybe a little fancier than it needed to be, but delicious. Fresh with avocado purée. My entree was the veal tortellini which was served in some type of beef broth sauce. Definitely a little different, but enjoyable. Light. The brussel sprouts might be my new favorite of all time. Roasted with some sweet tangy awesomeness. They're a must. The burrata is very unique. Served in a squash with pomegranate seeds and more. I probably prefer a more traditional burrata, but this one was very nice. I should also add everyone else I was there with ordered the ""pork for two"" and they all loved it.Atmosphere: Inside a hotel which I generally punt on, but this was fine. Elegant, quiet, softly lit, comfortable.Service: The service was definitely not bad, but unfortunately there is some room for improvement. On the plus side, the folks were mostly attentive, generally polite and educated on the menu.

4.0,8/23/2018,"Food: 4/5Service: 3.5/5Ambiance: 4/5Value: 3.5/5Easily got a table at this hotel restaurant, based on solid yelp reviews and as a fan of Andrew Carmellini. I do appreciate the fresh ingredients and seasonality. The razor clams were interestingly dressed with pink peppercorns and yuzu; the spiralized kohlrabi salad was refreshingly crunchy with an addictively good dressing. The green fettuccine and the chicken were fine, can't fault the cooking but neither were amazing. Overall it was a nice dinner but the bill was a little shocking, and it wasn't memorable. There was also an issue with the kitchen and we had to wait about 45 min between our appetizers and entree.As far as a hotel restaurant goes, Little Park is a good one, but I found it to be pricey.

2.0,8/8/2018,"Perhaps I have been spoiled by other Manhattan upscale restaurants, but I was far from impressed by Little Park. It's rather mediocre, and the staff leaves a lot to be desired. Came here on a Saturday night for a late night dinner at 9:30 pm. The restaurant itself was dead. The hostess tried to sit us at a corner table crammed right by the front, and I wasn't having it. My idea of fun is not to feel the hostess stand right behind me the whole time I eat. I will admit the next table was very nice, more towards the middle of the restaurant and spread out. The hostess didn't give us menus, and we had to wait for our server to hand them to us. The menu was tired and trite ""high-end"" cuisine. I ordered chicken, very unexceptional. You could've given it to me in a to-go box and told me it was from Whole Foods hot bar and I would've believed you. We also got our entrees before we got our sparkling water. I'm not sure if our waiter was new or tired or preoccupied, but he kept pausing when asking us questions and it took like 47 minutes for each task. Like, bringing water or silverware. My friend had the halibut, which apparently was the redeeming part of this experience and was cooked well. It took another 67 years to get our bill. I'm going to go ahead and assume we won't be returning.",2,1,1,Marie S.,"New York, NY",297,143,289
3.0,7/30/2018,"Stopped here for brunch on a weekend with friends visiting from out of town. It seems like lunch and dinner might be their strength, not brunch.

4.0,7/30/2018,"I can't help but feel that most high-end restaurants begrudgingly put out a Restaurant Week menu, only to hope that most diners don't actually order off it. Which is beyond me, as I would consider $40-45 for a dinner to be still pretty expensive. I've heard of places that won't offer the house bread to people who order off the RW menu and I've been to a fair share where the RW dish is about half the portion size of the regular dish. That's a long-winded way of saying I don't think Little Park falls in that category. We got our bread (a nice, chewy multi-grain that I helped myself blissfully to two pieces of) with some peppered butter. And the food, while in smaller portions that I'd prefer, was delicious but, as appropriate for a RW menu, a tad generic. The most adventurous dish on the table was probably the basil panna cotta with strawberries and some kind of honey-crisp cracker, though my friend's popcorn sundae took second place. What can I say - I have a massive sweet tooth. I really enjoyed the gazpacho and rainbow trout - the soup had these nice bits of cucumber and tomato to break up the texture, and the trout was really well-cooked. Just wish there had been a little more of it.Our waitress was fine, though I did notice that another waiter brought out all of our dishes. He also had the rather thankless task of running through the ingredients on our plates when all I really wanted to do was to start eating. All in all, there was enough here to make me want to come back and try the regular menu.",6,2,5,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1203,824,173
4.0,7/22/2018,"Little Park, in the Smyth Hotel, offers a seasonal menu creatively compiled with a mix of sweet and savory.  Service was excellent, and our waiter was very enthusiastic.  For appetizers I had the heirloom tomato tart with cheese (our server's recommendation), which was fresh and delicious.  My friend had a squid salad, which was prepared well, but didn't have enough squid for her liking.  Main dishes were good, my friend enjoyed her trout.  I had the sopresini which was a pasta in a corn sauce, that started out on the sweet side with a hit of pepper following.  I would recommend this dish.  Dessert was unusual--a sweet corn sundae with carmelized popcorn, honey and blueberries a hint of savory spice in it.  Cocktails were good, but on the expensive side ($17-20).  Overall, the restaurant is a good value for the neighborhood, featuring unique food offerings.",0,0,0,Laura B.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,20,2
5.0,6/18/2018,"Perfection.  Such love and care into each dish celebrating the season, time and care, culinary aesthetics, procurement and presentation. The heirloom tomato tart will transport you to summer afternoons in your grandmother's vegetable garden. A quiet, refreshingly understated approach to harvested, crafted farm-to-table dishes. The green fettuccini - fresh, springtime pasta, peas to please! And a proper poached egg, smoked mushrooms balancing out those bright flavors with a sultry umami.

5.0,6/17/2018,"I have been to Little Park twice in the last two weeks, the first time with a friend from out of town, and the second with girlfriends for a birthday celebration. Honestly I added Little Park to my list of favorite restaurants! I love love the ambiance -- the waiters are friendly and welcoming and the vibe is exceptionally cool and chill.Try the spring pea soup as your appetizer if you happen to be there in the summer, it is simply delish. For main course I highly recommend the sullivan county chicken especially if your hungry, as this is a very large portion. On the lighter side is the sirloin steak or the stripped bass -- just sumptuous!!Finally I just want to compliment the chef on such an excellent menu of choices and your specials.

2.0,5/30/2018,"Little Park is a much-hyped restaurant in Tribeca, the latest in chef Andrew Carmellini's uncreatively named ""NoHo Hospitality"" (blech) empire. As a connoisseur of Peking duck, I'd heard about Little Park's off-menu offering and wanted to try it after reading a lot of laudatory reviews from various city ""restaurant hype artists."" It's a break-the-bank dish that will run you 2x more than any other Peking duck in the city ($145), and you absolutely need to come with a group to keep costs reasonable.Unfortunately, the duck is not worth that price tag at all, and I question whether it even deserves the Peking duck label. For one, most of the skin isn't even crispy, but crispy sliced-off skins are a major component of the dish. This makes this more of a roast duck. The lack of crispy sliced-off skins also means you're going to be eating gross clumps of duck fat that at other places would have been skillfully thinned out, typically in the form of a film on the crispy skins. There's no hoisin sauce, cucumber, or green onion but instead a random clump of lettuce. I did think the vegetable wraps were really creative and a nice deviation from the usual buns/wraps. The duck meat is also tender and tasty, but it's no different from any other roast duck you can get elsewhere for 1/5th of the price. It's also not sliced compactly like Peking duck, so have fun wrestling with a fatty duck thigh.A wise mentor in graduate school once said to me: ""Don't just say what's wrong with a book. Think first about what's right about it and how it adds to your understanding of a topic."" But if the book were $145 and massively hyped, I might reconsider. That's why the overall tenor of this review is the way it is. In closing, I'd recently been thinking about an unsettling paradox: the best Peking duck in NYC is served at restaurants not run by Asians. How do I make sense of this as someone who loves the dish but feels instinctively (though perhaps wrongly) unnerved by what some might crassly describe as ""cultural theft'? I'm still trying to work this out, but maybe the premise is faulty to begin with given how short Little Park's Peking duck came up.",5,5,4,Merlin C.,"Manhattan, NY",274,608,74
4.0,5/30/2018,"What a cute lunch spot! I loved all the plants and light that came through the windows. And the food was delicious. I had the Big Eye Tuna and Green Fettuccine. The tuna itself was yummy and plentiful. I didn't love the bread that it came with, but the first round of general bread was good. The Green Fettuccine was oh so very good. The egg was perfectly yolky and tasted amazing mixed in with that delicious fettuccine. The mushrooms and peas added a nice touch. The food looked simple and light, but I was happily full at the end of the meal and just loved how well all the flavors worked together. Service was nice, but a little absent-minded.

I live rather closely and have often passed Little Park on my weekly treks to Whole Foods. I wrote the restaurant off as a generic, earthy Tribeca cafe for the local milfs who brunch daily and only order egg white frittatas. Yet again my too-quick-to-judge mind has failed me. Because this place is beyond delicious and the food is truly creative, modern and elevated. Their menu is vegetable focused, but in a way that pleases the biggest of meat eaters (me). You must order the crispy Brussels sprouts! Easily top 20 things I've ever put in my mouth. Get them or I will find you and shame you. The tuna carpaccio is also amazing although I think I lapped it up in 10 seconds, so the memory is fuzzy. Oh and the free bread and butter rocks - I would know I had an entire loaf. The night I went, they had a special vegetarian carbonara with house made pea fettuccine. I was hesitant to order this because of the word 'vegetarian' but ultimately entrusted my palette and belly to our server. He was right of course.

My Squid Ink pasta was good but nothing mind blowing.  The beetroot risotto, that was mind blowing.  So much so that I want to go back there again just for that.  The mixture of the beetroot and goat cheese, it was outstanding.Service: We were at the bar so it was fine.  However, one thing that does bother me is I wanted to order a dish to take home to my husband and they said they wouldn't do takeout but they would pack up my  food.  So then I asked if I could just get the food ordered in front of me and I'll take a bite and then pack it up, and the waiter said no!  Seriously folks, whats the big deal?Price: it's pricey and its NYC, but the food quality and execution are all good.Decor: We were at the bar and it was nice.  The place looks fine, just generic Tribeca looking.  But the food is the main focus, not the restaurant.Notable Extras: Did I already mention how good the beetroot risotto is?",0,0,0,Reena B.,"Jersey City, NJ",137,308,400

FRENCH TOAST ($19): Brioche bread with apricots and nuts.  A perfect dish.  Definitely more 'traditional' than the pancakes, but extremely well-made and definitely not a letdown.  Get these!  Total came to about $90 including my brother's meal; I found that to be reasonable given the portion sizes and quality.  Other notes: CINNAMON TOAST CRUNCH ICE CREAM: Have been here for dessert on other occasions; their cinnamon toast ice cream is a flashback to childhood.  COCKTAILS: There is a bar in the front of the restaurant which is a cute spot for drinks or snacks.  All in all: Little Park is an impressive restaurant to keep in mind if you're down in Tribeca.  It's upscale without completely breaking the bank, and now that it's been around for a couple of years, reservations are much easier to come by.",0,0,0,Jenn P.,"Manhattan, NY",285,134,933

Special ""compliments"" go to our server, the most emotionless and cold person I've met, we were clearly bothering him with silly questions about the menu, all his responses were abrupt and he would  turn his head away immediately to  avoid any further interrogation. We also celebrated a birthday that day, I called ahead to notify the hostess asking kindly if we order a dessert to add a candle and in case we don't - serve us smth simple like a scoop of gelato w/candle, to which she firmly said it's not going to happen and we absolutely must order a dessert to see a candle.

This place off of West Broadway and the southern end of Tribeca is a L-shaped restaurant that features typical new American fare. There is no theme. They have burgers, risotto, pasta, and fish to name a few. The apps are brussel sprouts, tuna, and scallops. No dominating theme. Instead, the dominating theme is more about the ingredients and the presentation. You can taste the freshness in their food, locally sourced for most of them. The presentation is often colorful but not tacky.The taste can feel a bit bland, so if you are into more dynamic tastes like spicy food or salty food, you may not like it here. Even chips or burgers felt flat a little. But you'd feel refreshed even after eating a large meal, so certainly worth a try.",5,0,2,Jae R.,"Manhattan, NY",320,220,797

I can say that the tomato risotto offers a unique flavorful and rich taste which I have not come across often, but as far as the rest of the experience I was not blown away by any particular dish or by the service especially when taking the price into consideration. As a matter of fact, the portions were smaller than I expected, and even the wait staff recommended that our table of three diners order nine dishes. At an average price of $25 or $30 per dish, I thought that was surprising since this restaurant is not a tapas bar. We ate here on a Sunday evening and probably only 20% of the tables were full.

For appetizers, we shared the kohlrabi, big eye tuna, and crispy garlic scapes. The tuna was probably my favorite. The fish itself was thin-sliced and flat, kind of like a pancake, with a scattering of sliced veggies on top. The scapes kind of looked like green French fries and came with three different dipping sauces. The kohlrabi looked spiralized, kind of like a pasta, and had a nutty sauce (layered at the bottom so make sure to stir).For an entree, I ordered the rainbow trout. The fish was cooked perfectly.

4.0,7/4/2017,"In this carnivorous city, it's rare to find a restaurant that cooks vegetables in a thoughtful way and makes them the star of a dish as opposed to a supporting role. At Little Park, vegetables take the main stage. One of the favorite dishes here is the kohlrabi salad - it's spiralized strands of kohlrabi mixed with other ingredients that vary depending on the season. The most recent iteration we had consisted of pomegranates (one of my faves), hazelnut and roasted garlic. Every time we've had this, the combination of flavors and textures has been spot on. Another highlight on the menu that must be pretty popular as it's been on the menu perennially is the carrot risotto. A very creative use of carrot but the dish ends up being a very homey with familiar flavors.But meat-lovers need not fret; there are plenty of meat entrees here as well. For example, the Aged Long Island Duck I had the other night was delicious - duck breast was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and the skin was fried to a golden crisp, just how I like it.

I'll start talking about the Spent Grain Bread and Cultured butter, which they serve upon request. I thought it was great. I then ordered the Kohirabi with black fig, and hazelnut. The Kohirabi doesn't have a lot of taste to it, but with the pomegranate seeds and dressing, it was a nice salad. It didn't blow me away, but I also prefer more traditional salads with green lettuce, so keep that in mind. For my main dish I ordered Black Bass, which was fantastic. Lastly, I ordered the cinnamon toast ice cream, which I thought was great. However, I ordered the goats milk cheesecake to go, and it was not that good. There was spiced marcona nuts in it, which was out of place. I didn't like the combination at all. Basically, I think it's a good restaurant especially if you like to eat clean healthy meals. My only issue is that I don't love the menu, but the quality of the food is very very good. Lastly, being a dessert connoisseur, I think they should work on their dessert menu. The cheese cake needs to be changed. Since there was not a huge dessert selection, I think they should focus on maybe changing them, although keep in mind I didn't try the Lemon Fluff or dark chocolate cake, which I will review next time.

Great for people like me who are anti food lines and hype but very much pro food.Definitely trendier than Lafayette and Locanda Verde, with a focus on vegetables and seasonal ingredients. My date and I split the mushroom pasta (not actually a pasta, but still delicious) and brussels sprouts to start (definitely get that one as well, these were the perfect amount of crispy). I had the duck for my main, while he had the steak - after trying both, I'd say duck is the way to go. Dessert was a pear fluff, which we ordered partly because of the name, but it turned out to be a very average sorbet/ice cream dish.I loved the drinks that I had, but the Hot Tin Roof lived up to its name in spiciness - my lips got number with every sip.

4.0,3/21/2017,"My friend raved about her brunch experience here, so we decided to check out the lunch fare together. To start off, we requested for the spent grain bread and cultured butter (it's free, but only served upon request). For the appetiser, our server recommended the kohlrabi and the crispy brussel sprouts (which is highly raved on Yelp). My friend and I had not had kohlrabi before, so we tried that. It is actually a root vegetable salad with black fig, hazelnut, roasted garlic. It was a good appetiser to start off with as it was light and refreshing. I particularly liked the crunchy textures too! For our mains, we split the crab vermicelli with basil, chilies & fresh bay as well as the sullivan county chicken with grilled flatbread, lentils & barley. The crab vermicelli was cooked al dente and had good chunks of crab. I didn't find it spicy despite the chilies. It was good but I preferred the chicken. The lentils & barley were tossed in a very tasty dressing - I'm not sure what it was, but it was delicious - both on its own, or with the grilled flatbread! The chicken was cooked just right, not dry at all. As we enjoyed all the items we ordered, we caved in and decided to get desserts and coffee to finish off our meal. The cinnamon toast ice cream was very simple - just literally ice cream that tasted like cinnamon toast (so make sure you like cinnamon if you order this!) with brioche crumbs. The dark chocolate rum cake, on the other hand, is what you should order if you plan to get just one dessert. It was plated like a deconstructed dessert - very pretty - served with caramel ice cream, almond chunks and rum-soaked cherries. Decadent, but well worth the calories!",1,1,2,Rachel L.,"New York, NY",21,153,411

The dishes would have been perfect as part of a tasting menu, but not as part of an a la carte menu (at almost $20 per portion).   There are also few true starters on the menu other than salads (which are priced similar to mains) which makes putting together a complete meal somewhat difficult.

4.0,12/19/2016,Our party of 7 came here on a Sunday evening for a birthday dinner. It was quiet when we got there at 6 but the dining room filed up pretty quickly shortly afterwards. The menu is a fun mix of raw options and creative spins on veggies for appies. We ordered some raw stuff like the scallops and the mackerel for starters. Clean and unique play on taste that complimented the seafood well.  Our server did a great job explaining the menu. We tried a whole wheat pasta that was similar to soba but was actually quite good since whole wheat pasta usually comes out tasting like crap. This was not the case. We had a few of the pastas and they were all quite good. Onto the meats. Few of us had the duck and that was done exceptionally well! Hunter decided to be different and had the black chicken. Also done very well. We had the bottles of the same wine. Don't remember the name of the wine though. Only remember it being a really good wine that was full bodied from Italy. They suggested decanting the wine for optimal taste and that we did! Onto desserts..we had the entire dessert menu minus one thing. The desserts were very good as well.

3.0,12/12/2016,"My partner and I have been here three times.  The lesson from this:  don't go on Sunday.  We did that twice, and had so/so service and food.  One Saturday, it was superlative.  This review has to do with the most recent Sunday meal. We arrived on time, and when we did arrive, the restaurant was half empty.  Yet, we were jammed into a small table, between two other couples, with so little room that I immediately knocked over someone's water glass. So we take care of that, and order drinks - except they don't have Bombay gin that night. So we order a different gin for martinis.  The bartender gets it wrong:  ""Dry"" does not mean ""dirty.""  We call over the waiter who says ""Gee, it shouldn't be cloudy.""  No, it shouldn't.  They go back - and he brings two more cloudy ones.  Time to give up and order food.  Tip number two:  don't order what you want to: ask.  There are highs, and there are lows.  Unfortunately, we ordered all the lows. Escarole salad, so loaded with vinegar my teeth ached.  The squash appetizer tasted good, but was hard to cut.  The chicken main course, with black garlic, had so much garlic on it that you couldn't taste the chicken - it was like eating smoke. It was SUPPOSED to come with persimmons. Guess they forgot.  Grilled scallops were cooked but tasted off. So did the rutubaga with them.The restaurant makes a big deal about their bread, and the Saturday we were there, rightly so.  On Sunday, not so much.  We didn't ask for the bread, but we were offered it.  We said yes. Then we had to ask three times to get it.  For two slices. And so it went: wine brought when the main courses are almost finished.  Our server, poor man, seemed to know the restaurant was off.  He told us  ""well, we've been hit hard by special events.""  I get that.  But it's not my fault. When we got to dessert we DID follow his recommendations.  The pumpkin cake sounds ridiculously expensive at 16.00, but it's huge.  Some would say it was burnt.  It may have been, to balance the smokiness in the wonderful scotch ice cream. The cheese plate was good too, but marred by stale bread. Our server brought us blood orange sorbet on the house ""to try to make up for things.""  Nice try.  it was good.  So, go, but proceed with care.",0,0,0,Norman H.,"New York, NY",101,75,0

5.0,9/29/2016,"Our recent Sunday night dinner here was a total delight. We made same day reservations on a whim and really our only criteria was that it was walkable from FiDi. This is inventive New American with creative vegetarian options. They focus on local and seasonal food and ingredient combinations.We started with the raw big eye tuna, which came out thin and flattened (int he shape of a tiny flatbread) and was covered in vinegary onions, fresno peppers, micro greens, thin radish slices, and fresh herbs and olive oil. It was a perfect combination of flavors and the olive oil cut the vinegar of the pickled onions. It was chilled, fresh and inventive. And for me, the highlight was the seared watermelon steak. Truly - this is one of the most creative dishes I've tried in awhile! Can't say I've ever seen it on a menu anywhere else either. The watermelon is first desiccated and then through the searing process is rehydrated again but it maintains a different texture than you would expect. It truly is a fantastic vegetarian option that imitates steak as much as possible for a summer fruit - and notable was the bean salad on the side - quite mild and creamy, a good juxtaposition in flavor and texture. Side note: I sent a photo to friends, and most thought it truly was steak!For our entrees we shared the mackerel, it was done very simply and was perfectly natural and delicious. A bit more of a salty and fishy (it's necessarily a very mild fish) - it went well with the vegetables and plum slices - the added sweet was a good touch. And the Long Island duck - delicious! The fatty outside was a bit crisp but the cuts of duck were seared perfectly on the inside - juicy and flavorful. The concord grape was a great and unexpected condiment, the salty and fatty duck goes well with the sweet grape. I did not necessarily get much of a lavender taste - but the small lavender buds were sprinkled over the dish.Dessert: the blueberry cake was like an A+ muffin - completely enjoyed it and the popcorn ice-cream was another creative twist on this menu - the sweet and salty - YES! And lastly - thanks to the sommelier we had a delicious chenin that was mild yet still mineraly and went well with all of our dishes, just a perfect compliment and even held up the duck which was the strongest of all of our selections. And a big thanks to our server who was extremely knowledgeable of the menu - she was attentive, professional and friendly and we enjoyed her recommendations and expertise.I would definitely come here again to try more menu items, you wouldn't need to get ""all dressed up"" because the vibe is casual, the interior is modern yet slightly rustic.

3.0,7/9/2016,"Good drinks, interesting but uneven food, mediocre service. My partner and I came for dinner on a Friday night at 8:30, and the restaurant, while tastefully decorated, was only 60% full. We were seated promptly. Our servers slightly rushed our drink orders--wonderful Sauvignon blanc--but gave us more time with ordering food. We split house-made bread (free but you have to ask for it) a charred cucumber gazpacho to start. The bread was delicious, although seemed to have dried out a bit with sitting. The gazpacho resembled an Andalucían gazpacho blanco, with grapes, cucumber, and almonds. This one also had cherries and mint. All of the flavors were there, and it was enjoyable until you bit into a cucumber that tasted only of burnt garlic. The bitterness was overwhelming in some bites. I minded less than my parter. For mains we got the wagyu steak and the watermelon steak, at the recommendation of the server. Both were delicious. The watermelon was charred and paired beautifully with barbecue dry rub and some sort of aioli. The wagyu was cooked to a perfect medium rare and served with delicious shishito chimichurri. We were about to end on a pleasant note, but our server aggressively tried to get our credit card to pay the bill. There were plenty of tables open, but still the two of is needed to be rushed out? Overall, a nice night. I'd come back for drinks and snacks at the bar. Maybe nice for a business lunch.",1,0,0,Rebecca F.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,15,3
5.0,7/7/2016,"I've eaten here twice for dinner within the past few months and have been extremely impressed with the food both times. On my first visit, I had the green spaghetti (walnut, fennel, and ricotta) along with some fresh bread with delicious butter. I washed it down with a little tonic (their version of a g & t with lime, honey, and cucumber). Everything was amazing, and I knew I needed to come back soon.On my second visit, I ended up having a 3-course meal even though I didn't intend to. The food was just that good. I started with the fava greens salad (strawberry, goat cheese, poppy seed), which was tangy and had a nice kick to it, and followed that with the soft-shelled crab (spiced tomato, yogurt), which was lightly fried. I'm a huge soft-shelled crab fan, but dislike when the taste is disguised by too much batter. This preparation was perfect and delicious. I finished the meal with the cinnamon toast ice cream, which was seriously one of the best desserts I've had in a while--simple but excellent.If I had to complain about anything here, it would be the price of the cocktails. 18 bucks for even a fancy g & t is a bit much, but it certainly won't deter me from coming back. I just wouldn't drink a lot here. It does tend to get crowded on the early side, so I recommend getting here around 5:30 or 6 if you don't have a reservation. I work within walking distance, so I plan to make Little Park a regular dinner spot when I want a nice meal.",0,0,0,Leslie G.,"Brooklyn, NY",129,278,28

As I am sure everyone has stated the menu is seasonal, I have dined here during Spring and Winter and had two completely different experiences. I did prefer the Spring menu over the Winter. If I recall correctly there was a divine watermelon salad that my guest and I couldn't stop raving about. The Spring dishes were/are very colorful, well presented, and well prepared. Actually, I can't recall any dishes not being delicious and standing well on its own. Its hard to compare because each dish stands well on its own.

However, restaurant was not even half full and we asked for a table. They informed us that they had reservations coming in and were completely booked. Wa asked to sit at the bar and they said no problem. Unfortunately, the bar was not set up yet, so while we were eating, the bartender was clattering around preparing the bar, which made for a rather unpleasant dining experience. Every dish was good. We had the grapefruit brûlée, egg white frittata and burger. When we were leaving the restaurant was still more than half empty.

Definitely a nice place to grab a drink/hang out before or after dinner.  Now, on to the FOOD! Their menu changes seasonally so this review is for their SPRING menu. What we ordered: Asparagus special - small portion.  Presentation and taste were excellent.  Asparagus nice and crispy, with this decadent mayo/egg sauce great for dipping if you have some extra bread left over. Scallops - also small portion.  Came out on a bed of fresh greens and a similar sauce as the asparagus.  Absolutely delicious! Duck Ragu - more of a generous portion.  GET THIS! Pasta al dente, duck cooked oh so well and packed with flavor.  Can't wait to come back to get this again. Cinnamon Toast Crunch Ice cream - can't remember the actual name of the desert but this is basically what it tasted like.  What makes this desert stand out are the crunchy add-ons.   Had a hard time making a reservation here so we decided to walk -in which was incredibly easy.  This would be the route to go if you are grabbing dinner on a weekday.",2,0,0,Anu K.,"Manhattan, NY",341,227,407

The menu range is small, but I suspect because this is due to the chef basing dishes on seasonal ingredients. Everything indeed is very fresh and is authentically farm to table, with clean flavours and unfussy plating. Good options for vegeterians. Also finally a non-fine dining restaurant that serves normal portions that humans should eat, you can order lots of little plates to share.

However, I'm still a fan because a) I was eating by myself, ordered only an appetizer and a glass of wine and the service was flawless (also I came in at 2 pm, and they closer at 2:30, but no one said a word about the time) and b) the tasty raddichio and apple salad (I think - it's no longer on the menu) plus the delicious spent grain bread and cured butter served compris, made for a light and filling meal (since I had a giant indulgent feast planner for later on, natch). Served with a crisp glass of Sauvignon Blanc, it was a great way to treat yo' self. Would I come back if it wasn't a special occasion or someone else wasn't picking up the tab? Probably not, only because if I'm going to eat healthy, vegetable-forward dishes I can honestly make those myself - I'd rather splurge with a more indulgent meal.

4.0,4/3/2016,"What better way to spend a Sunday than over brunch with a close friend? Today, I went to Little Park with Frank and had a wonderful time!  To start our dining experience, we each got an ""Improved"" Mimosa. It was made with Rum, Aperol, Sparking Wine, Orange and Honey. The drink was very refreshing and a great way to kick off the meal! The vibe of the restaurant was incredibly inviting and the service was top-notch, a lot of attention to detail and constant refills of coffee - who doesn't love that?For our entrees, we both went with egg dishes, always a safe move for brunch. I got the ""Eggs Your Way"" with potatoes and toast. I decided to get them scrambled with cheddar cheese. Frank got the Garden Herb Omelette with mushrooms, goat cheese and a small side salad. He also got a chocolate + tea scone. Both of our entrees were delicious! The potatoes with the eggs were very flavorful and they served a great room temperate whipped butter for the toast. Don't you hate when the butter is too cold? Frank's scone was super yummy, it tasted like a chocolate chip cookie. For dessert, we got cinnamon toast ice cream with brioche crumbs. IT WAS SO GOOD! It tasted exactly like the cereal milk after having cinnamon toast crunch cereal. It really reminded me of the cereal milk ice cream at Momofuku Milk Bar. This one was a bit sweeter though.

The menu is small as they change it regularly to fit what produce is available seasonally.Our waitress was attentive without being overbearing, quick to offer us water, take our order, and was spot on for recommendations - she highly recommended the pressed pineapple over the beet juice and the crispy brussel sprouts! The freshly squeezed orange was also delicious. We ordered the popular brussel sprouts to share - I could honestly say I never liked them until now! These were crispy and dressed with tangy pickled onions and crispy panko crumbs. We ordered the black tagliatelle with squid, lamache (shell pasta) with ragu and the wagyu steak with onions three ways. The mains were filling but not oversized. All were beautifully flavoured. The pasta dishes were excellent and you could taste the freshness of the pasta itself. I had the black tagliatelle myself and I would definitely recommend that! I tried some of the steak and it was okay and I tried the ragu and that was also very very tasty.

5.0,3/30/2016,"I don't give a star sweep lightly. That being said, LP earned it resoundingly. The interiors are clean, refined and marked with special moments (i.e. exposed Edison bulbs, a counter lined in succulents, varied lighting emittance to induce different spatial experiences throughout the dining room), much like the menu. Our server was a warm fella who had great presence and knowledge when we called upon him, and otherwise did not helicopter unnecessarily. The table was dressed similarly - relatively spare yet warm and personal with a small bouquet and a richly textured cloth napkin. We started with a glass of the 2013 Finger Lakes Reisling and the 2014 Carignan from the Languedoc region. Both hit the note for myself and my husband, respectively, listed in the manner of full bodiness, to match our particular desires that night. We held off on the spent grain bread and cultured butter while waiting for our starters, which is served only upon request. I appreciated this ability to opt-in as dining should be more deliberate. We later did ask for it as the dishes we were tasting were amazing that we wanted more engagement w the offerings. Needless to say, it did not disappoint.    Our appetizers (we were advised that all dishes were meant to be shared) were the beetroot tartare, and the mushroom spaghetti. Both were the most interesting sounding items on the menu, and really delivered. The first was an elegant mini cake of shining purple w ground rye bits sprinkled around and throughout contrasting wonderfully w the smoky trout roe. The horseradish really sang to our Jewish souls. Next up was the mushroom spaghetti which was a real revelation. I have since purchased a spiralizer in an effort to recreate the perfectly julienned mushroom pasta. Breaking the poached egg and mixing it up w the crispy shallots gave it a gooey, unctious sauce that felt so satisfying while remaining light. The mains then came - creamy carrot risotto was bright with orange and coriander notes and bits of feta, and the arctic char was by far the best I've ever had. The char's skin was gorgeously shiny as it was crispy, and the meat beneath the most delicate treatment I've had the pleasure of experiencing. The pink foretold a prep that was thoughtful as it was precise. It came beside sorrels in oyster vinaigrette that together was a truly outstanding dish. We topped off w the sorbet grapefruit that came in a whimsical vintage cocktail glass rimmed in bruleed citrus and fused w old tom gin. This is the type of place that I would be happy to recommend to anyone that will listen. The price is right, the service is on point, and the food is as memorable as they come.

When they served the ""chicken"" I had to ask the waitress if that was the entire meal. The size of the chicken portion looked roughly 2-3 oz. For $24, I was expecting something respectable. When I called the ""Manager"" over, she had no sense of how the customer was feeling, and simply explained it is a ""tapas"" restaurant and ""small share plates"".

That being said, the food was the most disappointing part of my experience! I ordered the Crispy Brussel Sprouts which appeared to be burnt-on-purpose brussel sprouts. They were really salty and lacked that creaminess that perfectly cooked brussel sprouts are supposed to have.I moved onto the Hanger Steak which I ordered medium and came out full on pink. What was weirder was that the outside was pinker than the inside. The last piece I cut into was quite red on the outside (but not bleeding) and entirely brown on the inside. Think of a sear, and have the colors be reversed. It was paired with some extremely tart vegetables that didn't help any. I actually left half the plate. Also, the quantity of brussel sprouts app greatly shadowed the quantity that was on my entree plate - did not understand that.Finally, the Apple Cinnamon Donut. This is the menu item I was most excited about, and it was so utterly disappointing. They serve it in a manner that you can't pick up and just bite into, but the dough is textured so you can't split it with a spoon or fork. On top of it all is a generous sprinkling of ground coffee, so much so that I couldn't taste anything else.The service was nice and the busboy was probably the best since he came to refill my water multiple times.

On top of the extremely poor service, the bartender didn't ask us at any point if we were ok she refilled our water cups after a long time of being empty. It took forever to get our bill when the bar was completely empty. We were one group of two set of customers at the bar. Once we did receive our bill, we couldn't believe our eyes. We had just spent $70 on four mediocre drinks; one of them being a $15 mimosa. I repeat--a $15 MIMOSA. It was the cheapest brut ever made and super pulpy juice. What a waste.

1.0,1/2/2016,I have been to a lot of restaurants in NYC as I go out weekly and this by far was the worst food I have ever had. I am actually in a state of shock and feeling a bit confused by how unappetizing it was. I went with 3 other people and we all had fish dishes and an appetizer. One dish was the scallops that came out smelling very fishy and I immediately knew there was something wrong. I really think they went bad and I hope my friend does not get sick.  On top of being spoiled they were so chewy and overcooked.  I had the monkfish and it was so disgusting that I actually had to spit it out and send it back. My other friend had the trout and it was so salty that tasting it made you choke. It was so disappointing especially considering the price. The waiter was so upset that I sent my dish back that he was giving us attitude. It took us so long to get our food and the restaurant was 1/2 empty. We all felt very upset after leaving this restaurant.  I really hope that we receive an apology and an explanation. And for the restaurant's sake I hope that had a fill in chef,0,0,0,Christine D.,"Manhattan, NY",113,2,0

I wish they would change the decor because I find it utterly bizarre. The lobby and basement bar of the Smyth Hotel are so well decorated and have great vibes. I have NO clue why they decided to make Little Park feel like a standard Marriott breakfast room. The environment is sterile and the light fixtures are rather horrendous...I sort of cringe whenever we come... I have so many problems with the dinner food here. We didnt like one thing we ordered last time and everything was so forgettable. Whats the deal with your boring pasta dishes? The only decent items are the brussel sprouts which I used to order for brunch UNTIL THEY REMOVED THEM FROM THE BRUNCH MENU. Please bring them back, they are epic. Which brings me to my next order of business: We don't like anything on the brunch menu except the pancakes, and we've tried everything..but the pancakes are a force to be reckoned with.

Don't expect for it to stuff you (it's not supposed to), but the fatty texture and flavor was very very well done.

We had a group of 5 people but only two of us showed up on time at 6pm and they seated us without any problem, which is rare at popular NYC establishments. Only a handful tables were taken at 6pm and it wasn't busy at all. The place was full by 7.30pm so get there before if you don't have a reservation. Now onto the food...it is heaven. We had several appetizers, I tried charred brocolli which was very tasty. They serve a lot of seasonal vegetable appetizers and had several autumn inspired options. For entree I had a Long Island duck, the best duck I have ever had! Every time I order duck at other places it comes on the dry side. So I always thought it was just the texture of the duck meat, that it wasn't very tender. Boy was I wrong. The duck at the Little Park, which I ordered medium, was very tender and juicy. They made the dish interesting by adding two small pieces of teriyaki marinated duck to the dish which was creative and delicious. The plate also had some sort of green sauce over which the duck was served. I'm not exactly sure what the sauce was made of, but to be honest, I could care less. It was yummy! Dipping my duck into that sauce...will never forget the experience. For desserts, we ordered four and they were all big portions so good to share between two people. My favorites were pumpkin pie with vanilla ice cream and cinnamon toast ice cream - very autumn inspired!The only downside is that they had only one kind of Cabernet that they serve by glass. It was very expensive, $25 per glass. I ordered anyway as I prefer Cab but they could add one or two more less expensive options to fit everyone's budget.

4.0,10/20/2015,"KenScale: 8.5/10Brunch is always a tricky proposition, with seemingly redundant menus with little room to have creativity from the kitchen. I've been to several places from chef Andrew Carmellini for brunch (The Dutch, Locanda Verde and Lafayette), and had very solid experiences, though. What the kitchen from these restaurants may lack in flare due to inherent limitations of brunch, the food has always been consistently well-executed. Little Park, the newest project from chef Carmellini that I visited earlier this year and really fell in love with, is no exception.The brunch menu at Little Park can't get more typical than what you would normally expect from a boring brunch restaurant. Yet, I can't stop thinking about the yogurt that came with granola, dried fruit and honey. I loved the clean flavor of yogurt that mixes beautifully with the crunchy texture of granola and dried fruit. I would certainly eat bruleed Florida grapefruit every day for breakfast, with fresh grapefruit and delightful crust on top working harmoniously. Pancakes with blueberries and vanilla are made with coconut and spelt, and the silky smooth texture was addictive without overpowering sweetness to it. I also loved baked eggs that came with artichoke and lamb chorizo. Another seemingly typical egg dish? It looks that way, but the aromatic flavor of the dish would make for a pleasant brunch anytime.The restaurant still seems to be going strong; although I had no problem getting a reservation, it was soon packed with handsome young people during the course of my meal. I typically recommend people to go to a restaurant for dinner to truly explore the full range of flavor and texture from the kitchen; if you're inclined to go to a brunch, however, you can't go wrong with Little Park.",6,1,3,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

There are so many delicious sounding items in the menu it was hard to choose, nick again was helpful explaining and guiding our choices. I started with cold squash soup. Delicious smoky flavor with incredible pickled tart flavors. It was outstanding, why can't I have this in a vat. So rich and flavorful. The watermelon steak literally tasted like steak. Smoky and meaty with a BBQ rub. This dish blew our minds. It was accompanied by crispy fresh heirloom beans, both green and a type of white bean. It's a fruit but tastes like meat. How does a fruit do that?  All of dinner was fantastic, however note that the portions are small, I should have ordered another vegetable plate. Who doesn't love a sommelier who suggests that you can have your delicious, full bodied Gruner by the half glass. Yes please.Let's talk about desert. Pumpkin cake taste exactly how fall should taste, spicy and true to the flavors of fall. Served as a long, fragrant, slice of moist cake accompanied by sweet, plump raisins and crunchy pumpkin seeds.

HOWEVER (and this is why I'm giving an overall score of poor) the staff and service was AWFUL. So awful I was compelled to write this review (which I also never do). I had made a reservation for 8 for 6 about 2 weeks in advance saying it was for a birthday mentioning we would be bringing our own cake. I called the evening of to make sure the reservation was confirmed and we arrived on time. We were still made to wait 10 minutes, which, if the rest of the evening wasn't as terrible as it was, wouldn't have been a big deal in itself. However, our service was slow and unnattentive. The waiter made us feel uncomfortable asking questions about the dishes. But really what sealed the deal was once the meal was finished (around a $300 total cost) a woman came out (claiming to be the manager however I doubt it seeing how young and unprofessional she behaved after the matter) to inform us that there was a $6 PER PERSON ""cake cutting"" fee for the cake that we had brought in for the birthday. I was NEVER informed of this fee- not when I called to book the reservation, or to confirm the reservation the day of, OR WHEN I HANDED THE CAKE OVER TO THE STAFF. I would've been fine paying some sort of holding fee for the cake but what does the number of members of the party even have to do with handing over a cake at this point. We all had coffee plates and left over silverware in front of us. We would have essentially had to pay $36 more dollars on top of the $300 dinner to eat the cake WE ALREADY PAID FOR.

The service was top notch and our waiter was very knowledgeable about any dish I asked about and had great recommendations of dishes he likes a lot on the menu. I ended up taking his recommendations. We had The Strawberries & Barrata to start - the strawberries were really fresh and the Barrata itself was really flavorful and went great with the strawberries.Next was the Fried Avocado Squash. This was a really interesting dish. The squash was really fresh and not too fried - somehow it ended up being pretty light. The dish had a creamy sauce with various spices on the side of the plate that was super tasty to dip the squash in. We then had the Girandole but substituted out the bacon to make the dish vegeterian - the waiter was very accommodating with dish substitutions to meet our needs. The pasta and veggies in it was really fresh - freshness is pretty much a theme with the food at this restaurant. The zucchini was great and went well with the pasta, and the dish had a really light marinara sauce that perfectly balanced everything in it. I then got the Long Island Duck cooked medium rare. This was by far my favorite dish from here. The duck was extremely juicy and flavorful and the skin was perfectly crispy. There was an amazing creamy sauce to dip the duck in. I highly recommend getting this dish if you enjoy duck. For dessert we got the Cinnamon Toast Ice Cream. The cinnamon toast were small bite size pieces spread out in the ice cream. Man was this ice cream good. Overall really refreshing, and just the right amount of sweet. In total we got 2 vegetable plates, 1 pasta plate, 1 meat dish, and 1 dessert.

1.0,8/22/2015,"This was one of the WORST restaurant experiences we've ever had. Found it on Yelp and after seeing fairly decent reviews, and knowing it's at a Thompson hotel which has great rep, we decided to give a try.The decor was quaint but nothing makes your jaw drop. It took no less than 3 minutes before someone approached us. My boyfriend actually saw the group of wait staff gathering and debating who should take our table.Saw someone's earlier review and mentioned their bread and butter was awesome---well it's not. Bread is cold and butter is not special, I was starving yet couldn't finish the bread because it was so bad.Ordered the scallop from the ""raw"" section of the menu, the duck, and the crab spaghetti. Funny story, another waiter came by and asked if we had questions about the menu, naturally we wondered how the duck was cooked""smoked"" was all he said---you'd think he was going to follow that up with some juicy description of the dish, but nope, just awkward silence. ""how about the bass? how's that done?""""steamed""---same if not even more awkward silence followed. We had to probe him to sell the dishes to us, a SwissChalet waiter would've had more to say about their rotisserie chicken!So the scallop turned out to be the most disgusting thing --4 thinly sliced pieces arrived in a pool of algae like liquid with some white spots floating on top, it reminded me of my high school science project of growing bacteria in a petri dish. Tasted bland and salty. That was $22 a pop if I remember correctly. Duck and the pasta were passable in taste but portion was tiny. Overall the service was so awkwardly comical we thought we were in a skit. throughout the meal no less than 4 staff came to serve with no consistency nor flow, no one really asked how the food was, one of which gave us a clown like smile and quickly walked away.Do not go there unless you find any of the above intriguing and rather experience it for yourself. p.s.

It was served with a puree of turnips, and side of chard + cherries with duck sausage.  I can't recommend this dish enough.  Easily the best duck I've had.Saying that, I also had the STRAWBERRIES + BURRATA with summer herbs.  It was refreshing and complimentary, but also sorta basic.  I've definitely had better burrata before. The FROZEN LEMON VERBENA FLUFF with PLUM SORBET was just alright.

1.0,8/10/2015,"We are locals to the area, and were looking for a lighter eat on a Saturday night. Decided to try Little Park but were seriously underwhelmed and disappointed. I have to adamantly disagree with Phil G - the bread and butter were the first indicators that the food was going to be subpar. We ordered the scallops, and two NY Strip steaks (pretty safe bets at any American restaurant) - all of the food was lukewarm. The Strip steak portion was very small, very COLD, and the medium was medium rare. The menu said it would be accompanied by mixed greens and braised leek - it was literally just wilted lettuce leaves. The scallops were supposed to be grilled but had obviously just been thrown on the grill with the black burn marks. They came with whole blueberries (what??) and the smallest fingerling potatoes. It was as if a random trainee chef was asked to prepare our food, without flavor or any sense of love. The only redeeming factor was my Little Park (gin based cocktail).",0,0,0,Jessica T.,"New York, NY",0,3,0

3.0,7/7/2015,"IN SHORT: A relative newcomer to the downtown dining scene that promises idyllic, yet inventive, farm-focused food in an ethereal, woodsy, and thoughtfully trend-aware setting.THE STORY: There is a little note that hangs by my coworker's desk that outlines something called ""The Creative Process."" It goes like this:1. This is awesome2. This is tricky3. This is shit4. I am shit5. This might be ok6. This is awesomeAfter a recent dinner at Little Park, I imagine that Andrew Carmellini's process in crafting the high-level seasonal and sustainable menu may have looked a lot like that. The local, vegetal concept is the great idea we have all heard a dozen times before, but the challenge facing Mr. Carmellini is in creating food that defies our preconceived notions of this common idea.I won't pause to consider what the shit iterations of some of these dishes may have looked like because, fortunately, Mr. Carmellini has a great deal of imagination, and his food at Little Park, while not without its imperfections, is exceedingly fresh and unique. Mr. Carmellini is taking risks in his cooking to avoid the tired and the ordinary, and while some resulting dishes are still stuck at just ""ok,"" many are, in fact, awesome.I yearned for a greater depth of flavor in the Big Eye Tuna, whose red fresno peppers brought a little too much heat to the delicacy of the tartare, which was also served a little too close to room temperature. The pickled heads of the white beech mushrooms deftly punctuated the dish, though, the vinegar a welcome addition to the fresh radishes and herbs sprinkling the plate.Better was the Mushroom Carpaccio, an elegant plate of thinly sliced royal trumpet mushrooms marinated in a rich, meaty ragu with cured egg yolks. Here, Mr. Carmellini knows that providing a handsomely carnivorous foil to a plate can make a vegetable an even stronger star, and indeed, the best bites were towards the center of the dish where the mushrooms had had a chance to marinate even more deeply in the juices.And while the idea of strawberries in a salad recalls for me the soggy salad bar at a Souplantation, the Strawberries and Burrata with arugula and summer herbs was creamy, peppery, and sweet in all the right places. The strawberries themselves were small, tender, and without a note of acidity or bitterness, which could have decimated the plate, instead only highlighting phenomenal quality burrata that would certainly impress any connoisseur.Mr. Carmellini's food here pays special attention to the vegetable notes and accents across plates, even in the mains like the Scallops with chanterelles, brown butter, and nettle, and the Long Island Duck with turnips and tangy grapes. Rounds of dark duck sausage take on the same texture and sweetness as the grapes and olives beside it, an exceedingly democratic approach to the dish that biases neither the meat nor the vegetables supporting it.In many ways my entire meal here is a part of the creative process, the restaurant simply a step in the evolution of seasonal, farm-to-table cooking, and in many ways Little Park is truly a young descendant of restaurants like Blue Hill. It's still an exciting, creative, adventurous work in progress, and the young, downtown-based diners looking for a power lunch or a dinner date will intuitively accept the dishes that occasionally swing and miss because of the ingenuity and inventiveness upon which the cooking is founded.",1,0,0,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245

He was so unaware of his lack of professionalism and manners that we thought we were being punked. He told us we should order between 8-12 dishes for the entire table of 4. Thankfully we did not listen to him because that would have been way too much food. He also removed all our flatware and replaced in them with spoons for each of us after we ordered our food yet none of the dishes ordered required a spoon. So that meant, when the food arrived, he again removed the spoons and replaced them with forks and knives. He couldn't reach me or my friend who was across from me, so he lightly tossed the knife and fork at us! Seriously the kid had no clue what he was doing and should not be in the services industry whatsoever. He also had someone shadowing him who just seemed to stare blankly and his presence was never mentioned/explained. It was like he was a ghost except everyone could see him.

The appetizers were delicious, a summer squash special and the asparagus, which has a nice range of textures. I was a little disappointed with the entrees. The artic charge was pretty good, the scallops were good, but the portion was really small with three sliver of mushrooms. The sea bass was a total fail. It tasted fishy and the sauce was pretty gross (I never really describe food that way). The whole dish just didn't work in my opinion. We had a show to catch, so didn't have time to get dessert because the entrees took forever to come out. The service was pretty good, and they kept apologizing for the slowness (we went early so it wasn't that packed yet), but they didn't really seem that concerned (they knew we had a show) or offer to compensate with a quick app or dessert.Overall I don't think I would come back here, maybe grab a drink at the bar and get an app, but found the portions to be a little small for what you get.

3.0,6/21/2015,"We came in with high expectations given it's by Andrew Carmellini. I wouldn't say Little Park is bad, and I understand the cuisine is different, but compared to Locanda Verde, this place is VERY average. We arrived at 8:45pm on a Saturday night, the restaurant was very busy, but we were seated right away. Decor was modern and bright, servers were nice and attentive. Food portion here is not big, so everything is meant to share. We ordered oysters (one from the raw section and one is grilled and it's the night's special), wild salmon, asparagus, fried broccoli, ravioli, sea bass, and duck breast. - Oysters plates, one raw and one grilled, both were $16 for four oysters, could arguably be the most over-priced oysters I've put in my mouth. Raw oysters were good, but grilled ones were too over-powered by tomato sauced on top. - Wild salmon and fried broccoli were average, nothing wow, nothing bad. For Asparagus, other than the Thai chili flavor in the sauce which gave it some extra flavor, nothing else was special. - Sea bass was a complete failure. It looked pretty, and I liked the English peas on the plate, but the fish itself basically lacked flavor and it seemed out of place on the plate. - Ravioli and duck were definitely the two favorites of the night, especially the duck breast. It was cooked perfectly medium rare and skin was caramelized perfectly crispy, with extra flavors from turnip and kick from peppercorn in the thin slice of sausages. Everything considered, Little Park is in an awkward place. It wants to be farm to table, so the subtle flavors in plates should compliment the main ingredient and enable it to shine. Instead, other than the ravioli and duck, everything was bland, and I don't think the ingredients were fresh or high quality enough to be tasted without any additional flavors.",4,0,4,Lu H.,"New York, NY",294,570,1967

1.0,6/16/2015,"So the one star I can give to this place is for the decor that uses very warm colors, lots of wood & nice lighting. Nearly everything else was bad.This was one of the worst dining experiences I have had in my years of living in NYC. They serve fairly small plates that are meant to be shared which is great because my husband & I love being able to try many different items on the menu. I think that their intention was to have each plate come out as an individual course which would have worked fine except for the fact that the service was painfully slow. We were seated at 8:30 and by 9:45 we had received exactly 2 pieces of very hearty healthy-tasting pieces of bread and one vegetable course (fried cauliflower - it was only ok.) We were so hungry and tired at this point that we asked our server (actually not our server who never really stopped by our table again - we had to flag down another waiter) to bring out the courses as they were ready, even if that meant all at once. Then, after 10 minutes, all our courses arrived to the table. The worst part was that they were all lukewarm as if they had been sitting for a while. The gentleman who served us our food then proceeded to tell me rudely that they had been waiting for me to return from the restroom (I left the table for 5 min after already waiting an hour for our food.) To top it off, each of these barely warm dishes spanned from completely mediocre to bad. The kale ravioli that we had read about on all the reviews was not on the menu so we ordered the butternut squash ravioli (eh), the beetroot risotto (risotto was hard - not al dente hard but stuck in your teeth hard) and the sea bass did not taste (or smell) fresh.We finished the meal with the cinnamon toast ice cream. Ice cream was rich & decadent topped with a couple of croutons. Um, ok. But wait, no... the real finale of the meal were 2 small squares of chocolate that tasted exactly like an Andes mint candy combined with a burnt girl scout cookie.

3.0,6/9/2015,"I want to give this restaurant a 3.5, because there are some things I really liked about the restaurant, and others that I thought were just okay. Setting: The restaurant is modern and has a cool lay out, which was fine. I don't understand their reservation policy thought--half the tables in the reserved section were empty, and the diners who were present all ate in a tiny section, which she seemed silly. Food: I love that they put so much emphasis on vegetables, and they try to make their food creative. And I really enjoy how each dish is served one at a time, so it's like a tasting. That said, the dishes were overpriced for their size, and not all of them were tasty. Here is my breakdown:Mushroom carpaccio: This was extremely light, but very tasty. Probably one of my favorite things we tried.Heirloom carrots: These were pretty good, but definitely not worth the price.Butterball potato ravioli: Very small portion, but very good. And, despite the ""butterball"" title, it was very light and airy. Beetroot risotto: Not a fan of this dish. The first bite was interesting, but the flavors were too strong, and not in a good way. Duck: DELICIOUS. Really nice, meaty cut of duck, and the kebab was more of a sausage. Cinnamon ice cream: Really good, not worth $8 for a tiny scoop. BOTTOM LINE: Great concept, but there are other restaurants that do this better. If they brought down the price, it would be worth it.

2.0,6/8/2015,"I went to Little Park for lunch several weeks ago and loved it -- good food, nice service and a quiet atmosphere.  Perhaps my only complaint was that the tables and chairs seem made for 100 pound, super petite adults.  I'm not a big guy, but I kept kicking my dining partner under the table on accident...So with a vendor coming from out of town (who is a ""foodie"") I booked a table for dinner at Little Park. Man, was I disappointed!  The same table problem existed, although more pronounced, as there were three of us - and my vendor was obviously uncomfortable for most of the meal.  The service was quiet strange, as we had a head waiter and basically a ""team"" approach, where each dish was served by somebody else.  It was odd and uncomfortable, being that as we had issues throughout our meal, we basically had no idea who to talk with.In the end, the food was OK, 2 of the dishes were a total miss (I think one was plainly  undercooked and we had to send it back) but some others had really nice presentation and flavor.However, overall, the service is what killed this meal.  We got served the wrong beer and had to argue about it for a while (until the manager tried it and agreed, he was very nice and knowledgeable), my vendor's drink glass was chipped while refilling water and not noticed, and generally I couldn't tell if the lead waiter was making fun of us, being obtuse or just had a really bad sense of humor.  Several times when we complained about something, he thought we were joking and left, only to come back a few minutes later and apologize.  Weird.Anyways, won't be going here again!",0,0,0,Zachary S.,"New York, NY",0,10,5

I would do this sampling again- I left full without finishing everything and with a good meal of simply cooked and flavorful veggies. My hubby had the hanger steak- and I don't know it was dead cow. I guess it was good, but it wasn't out of this world. Nice server but a little slow a few times, we didn't mind we weren't in a rush. Personally I love the vegetable focus here and would return if we lived here- not excellent enough to merit a special trip every time we are in town.This place was even better this time. With a reservation we were seated quickly and had excellent service. We got so many delicious veggies! (Kohlrabi, Brussels, broccoli), good bread, delicious pasta for me and scallops for Hubby.  No deserts looked great but we had a fine cheese course. Again those cocktails are the bomb. This is a place to keep coming back to!",0,0,0,Jennifer H.,"Dayton, OH",6,81,14

As a native New Yorker who eats out constantly I've had my share of bad meals, misrepresented experiences, poor service and bad value yet I've never been moved to take the time to warn others and post a complaint.The ups and downs of the service and ambience are inconsequential to the ill conceived, absurd menu and the actual food. As examples,The ravioli, 6,  were literally postage stamp size and had nothing on Chef Boy-R- Dee.There was no opportunity to get a side vegetable with our entrees! Even though we offered to pay extra. We were told they were already 'pre-portioned' out.....This despite the fact there was no appetizer section (save 4 ""cured'' or raw fish offerings)  to the menu, only a vegetable section. Cant make it up.The avocado in the 'Mackerel & Avocado' was a smear of thin green paste across the plate. No exaggeration what so ever.The Arctic char was gold fish sized and frozen, not fresh.The half lobster had no claw!!! Seriously.And the lamb porterhouse, $34., was one small loin chop pre-cut...Our concerns were met with a ready fawning, slack jawed apologetic 'don't blame me' attitude which suggests an endemic condition.Do not go to this restaurant.",0,0,0,peter s.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0
3.0,5/8/2015,"Stopped in for a snack here while riding bikes a few weeks ago. We had a tea and shared the Banana flax bread and the beet root tartare. I must say that both of these items were superb. The Banana bread  was moist and had a nice extra crunch from the flaxseed. The beet root tartare was served with rye bread crumbs, trout roe, and horseradish. It was light, and very unique. It had a great combination of flavors and textures.Their barista must've been having trouble, as it took almost a half an hour to get our tea and coffee drinks. As it was early on a Sunday morning, the place was full of young families and little kids. If I return I will go later in the afternoon.

The dish looked so good that I couldn't wait to start eating and completely forgot to take my food picture for Yelp! My friend ordered the egg white frittata and she liked it as well. On the website for this restaurant, it states that the chef uses ingredients like ""organic vegetables, free-range poultry, grass-fed meats, line-caught fish, and heirloom grains.""

Having lived and eaten my way through NYC for the past 5 years, my experience today was the one that made me join Yelp solely to write a review about my terrible time I had at brunch today.We were seated without a reservation at a table by the bar area. It was fairly busy but there were open tables so inattentive service due to being slammed couldn't have been an excuse. Had to flag the waitress down to take our order with zero enthusiasm then didn't see her at all until she grabbed my credit card for payment at the end without saying a word.  Had to ask every other waitress/bus boy I could get the attention of for flatware, more water, a side of bread and the check. Food and drinks also took abnormally long to arrive. The only upside of the experience was that the 2 of us were seated at a 4 top which allowed table space for me to stack our own appetizer, bread plates, flatware and empty coffee and juice glasses out of the way to make room for our entrees that came without our table being cleared which multiple members of the wait staff (including what looked like managers) just stared at and kept walking.Again, despite the food being pretty good the service was so abysmal  that I certainly wouldn't recommend  going here to anyone - too many great restaurants in the neighborhood with great ambiance, food and service to waste your time here.",0,0,0,Andrea P.,"New York, NY",0,1,0

Very creative and interesting but the flavors were not there. The idea is great but not executed well. Would not order again. Dessert arrived and it's usually the course I look forward to the most. I had the chocolate cake which was very dry and very disappointing. My friend ordered a citrus sorbert. I could look up what it was exactly but what's the point- it was a citrus dessert that is not worth mentioning except to only tell you it's unimpressive.

We event showed up 45 mins early for our reservation to either try out luck at getting an earlier table or eating at the bar and there was plenty of space for both. We started with the tuna from the raw+cured section. It was awesome. It came up in this giant circular shape that looked like it had been rolled thin like a pie crust. It had white beech mushrooms and chilies on it to give it a kick. Then we ordered the heirloom carrots and cauliflower. Both were fantastic. The heirloom carrots had a ton of flavoring from the different garnishes. The cauliflower was ever so slightly fried but it wasn't too heavy or unhealthy.Then we split the kale ravioli in a butternut squash sauce and the chicken. Everything was cooked to perfection.

3.0,3/10/2015,"The meal started off well. Little Park is a beautiful restaurant located in the corner of the Smyth Hotel. We went for lunch on a Tuesday. The menu is interesting - we had a very hard time deciding what to order and as we are huge Carmellini fans, we knew everything would be delicious. Unfortunately, we only had one hour for lunch, which we were aware was cutting it close. But we hoped that without dessert we would be fine. For appetizers, we ordered the red snapper crudo and the endive salad. Both came out quickly and were delicious, particularly the endive salad, which was crisp and tangy dressed in a walnut vinaigrette with pear, walnuts, cheese shavings and celery. Things went downhill after that. We had ordered the black shell pasta (squid ink shells with scallops and squid and pickled pepper sauce) and the roasted beet and egg sandwich. Our appetizer plates were cleared away and then ten minutes went by and then twenty and then thirty...no one came over to tell us what was going on. Thirty five minutes and eventually we flagged down our waitress who let us know that something had gone wrong in the kitchen but that she wasn't sure what had happened. By this point, we had ten minutes left before we needed to leave and still no entrees had arrived. We were so desperate that we even tried to cancel the order completely.It was the hostess who truly saved the day. She was lovely and very helpful. She brought us the entrees packed up to go, gave us the meal on the house, and asked us to please come back and give Little Park another chance.

5.0,2/28/2015,"Food: There were no clear winners because everything was so good. The four of us had different favorites amongst all of the dishes, which attests to the quality of the menu. The theme of the night was ""I don't even like _____, but this is the best I've ever had!"" (see in particular: beetroot risotto and duck)Service: We were pains and asked for extra communal utensils for literally every plate; our friend was recovering from a cold and we didn't want to risk it. They obliged willingly! We also had so much fun here, laughed what we thought was too loudly, and nobody shut us up or rushed us. Major points.What we got:They recommend 2-3 plates per person. We got 8 for the 4 of us but it was on the brink of too much. Dishes were served in rounds based on the section of the menu they were in:Winter veggies:~ Roasted sunchokes ($13) - You know, I will give this a ~ (neutral) due to a variety of opinions at the table. I personally liked it though.+ Crispy brussel sprouts - I will go along with everyone else who thinks these are amazing, because they are.+ Beetroot tartare ($15) - As someone generally ambivalent to vegetables masquerading as their meat tartare counterparts, this one was complex in taste and texture enough that it was worth it. It was plated beautifully with functional accompaniments (crumbled rye, horseradish cream, roe).Pasta + whole grain:~ Black kale ravioli ($15) - The pasta ravioli shell was just shy of being fully cooked. However, kale has never tasted that good.Fish + seafood:~ Spiced shellfish ragu ($15) - Unless I'm mistaken what a ragu is, this did not seem like one. It was more of a slightly brothy seafood stew.Sad. On its own, the seafood was good but didn't stand out.+ Steamed black bass ($24) - Everyone was a fan of the (beluga, ha!) lentils in the dish, but the bass itself was cooked excellently.Fire-roasted meats (vs. roasted with what?):+ Dry-aged duck and kebab ($19) - We were all like, is that a sausage? I guess it's called a kebab, but man was it delicious. More of that, please.+ Grass-fed hangar steak (22) - Yes. We were particularly excited to feed our friend who doesn't eat much red meat this piece of steak, and we succeeded. End of story.+ Cinnamon toast ice cream ($8) - tastes just like the cereal (don't you just love high brow-low brow), but a very good one.- Chocolate - rye cake ($12) - kind of dry, had to drench it in the caramel sauce they serve on the side. Additionally, the hazelnuts (appreciate that they gave us a ton of toasted hazelnuts) were kind of overdone.+ Drinks - I got a delicious rye/apple/ginger beer cocktail ($15)+ Spent grain bread they serve - hearty, served with a salty ""cultured"" butter. i ate too many of these. Definitely a bread from the earth. I don't know what that means, I just feel it.+ Petit four when you pay the check - mint chocolate cube of joyAll in all, though everything was not 100% perfect, this place is creative, does wonders with vegetables, attentive, and just generally makes me feel good about living.P.S.

4.0,2/27/2015,"I have to admit, I was torn upon hearing the announcement of Little Park's opening in the Smyth Hotel. First, TriBeCa isn't exactly known for its wealth of quality bars and eateries (aside from the Michelin-starred Jungsik and atera just around the corner), and a lesser ornamented restaurant would certainly be a welcomed addition. On the other hand, it was a clear dive into the ongoing dining trends, another hotel-situated restaurant promising seasonal small plates, a vegetable-focused menu, and a curated wine and beverage list, all backed by Andrew Carmellini, an established chef with a strong track record in NYC.Sometimes though, if you can't beat them, it's better to join them.The interior of Little Park is another strong point, featuring mellowed down wood, candlelit tables, and a lengthy bar area, which makes it ideal for either an off-chance drink or a multi-course dinner. We were promptly seated, despite not having a reservation the night of, and after going through the wine list, I opted to start off with a glass of Riesling (Gewurtztraminer, 2012) which the sommelier was adept enough to let me taste before agreeing to a full pour. It gave us enough time to go through the  menu and decide on the rest of our meal.There have been plenty of accolades given to Little Park for their vegetable-centric dishes, but I'll add in my own two cents. The Sunchokes are a solid starter, and ideal for sharing. I was hoping, perhaps, for something that would rival All'Onda's brown butter and soy iteration, but these were served with black trumpet mushrooms and a sauce thickened with hazelnuts. The Kale Ravioli, however, was the dish that stood out. The filling in each of these was remarkably smooth and fragrant, and paired with a sweet-savory fall squash sauce, caramelized onions, and a handful of toasted pine nuts, it quickly disappeared from the table.For my main, I went with the Dry Aged Duck Breast, which was also a decision I didn't regret. The dish features three generous slices of duck breast plated with a duck ""kebab"", a serving of red quinoa, mashed turnips, and a concord grape reduction. The duck was cooked to a perfect medium with the fat expertly rendered, leaving a crisp skin on the exterior. A little tang and sweetness from the grapes melded with the turnips, and although quinoa would not have been my grain of choice, it provided a smart textural contrast to the dish.For those with a sweet tooth, it will be difficult to leave without getting the Cinnamon Toast Ice Cream, a two-scoop masterpiece that's topped off with cinnamon sugar-dusted croutons. The ice cream is on the richer and sweeter end of the spectrum, but the punch of cinnamon in each bite should be enough incentive to finish the entire bowl.As much as I don't want to admit to it, I've joined the bandwagon... but in my opinion, it's entirely justified. There's not much opposition one can have against thoughtfully plated, well-executed dishes served in a less-than-pretentious atmosphere. For those looking to make a visit, do your best to secure a reservation in advance; it's one of the few negative externalities of going to a well-received venue in New York City.",20,5,10,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

I've been to all of Andrew Carmellini's restaurants now, and I think his Italian restaurants are the best. I had the Atlantic trout salad, the hangar steak, and the chocolate rye cake. The salad was the most interesting and fresh, with brussel sprout leaves worked into the greens and an amazingly fruity dressing. The Viognier/Sauvignon Blanc Italian wine had a lovely minerality that made me want to buy a case immediately.

Unassuming from the outside. Walking inside reveals an extremely spacious calm, neutral toned dining room. Ambiance was wonderful and service was on point. My friends and I ordered from the Restaurant Week Menu:Appetizer Atlantic Sea Trout crunchy relish, amagansett sea salt - great flavors, sweet and vinegary and olive oil dressing, with slices of smoked fish and apples. A eclectic and exotic bunch of greens spiced up the dish. Fried Local Cauliflower pistachio, herbs - flavorful and very lightly fried. Had a great selection of different types of cauliflower, including purple. A nice choice if you like fried foods, but don't like the heaviness. Main Lobster sandwich - very soft and fresh lobster with cucumber slices. House potato chips were thinly sliced, lightly fried and very fresh. However, disappointed with the small amount of lobster in the sandwich. Grass fed hanger steak - 4 slices of steak with 2 strands of broccoli rabe. The steak was cooked perfectly, very soft, but not as flavorful as I had hoped. DessertFrozen Lemon Fluff with lemon sorbet - paired with clementines and other citrus fruits. Very, very tasty dessert. Fresh and had a spectrum of flavors. I would definitely recommend to get this if you will be dining for restaurant week.

Vegetarians must be loved here because that beet tartare was perhaps my favorite dish. I don't recommend sharing because you'll certainly want each plate all to yourself.

For dessert, I ordered the chocolate-rye cake with hazel nut ice cream, the cake was ok but the hazel nut ice cream was so good!  The service staff were attentive and accommodating.  We were a group of 5 and we gave 4 credit cards with one credit card for two heads.  Without hesitation, they accepted our request.The atmosphere was also great -- it was a perfect lunch with great food and even greater company.  I will definitely come back!",0,0,1,MJ B.,"Hoboken, NJ",1,160,2

The decorations are simple and cozy with comfortable seating and mellow background music. Even as the restaurant filled up, the noise was absorbed so well that I was never feeling like I had to talk over the background noise.The food was simple and delicious, but every dish had its own unique flavor. They are smaller plates and they recommend sharing (and I agree!). We had a hard time deciding because everything looked so good so we each picked 2 or 3 dishes and we were definitely very satisfied at the end of our meal (there was 3 of us).

5.0,1/11/2015,"Wow! What a find. My boyfriend and I dined here last night. We entered from the west broadway entrance, which led us into the hotel, but the hotel associate was so kind as to not just point us in the right direction but walk us to the restaurant door when she rightly figured we were a little lost.The restaurant itself is very beautiful. It boasts perfect lighting, perfect furniture, clean and modern design, etc. Super warm and cozy!The goodness isn't just superficial though. Our waitress was so sweet, knowledgeable and attentive. Excellent service! Our water glasses were quickly refilled and they offered my boyfriend so much bread he had to finally decline from getting stuffed. (some places are uber stingy with the bread!)On to the food: I got the pan fried brussels sprouts with the apple balsamic sauce, pickled black currants, and crispy bits on top. There was also some type of butter sauce on the bottom of the dish. It was in fact love at first bite!Lots of places are doing the caramelized brussels sprouts thing (and most of the time the sprouts are too oily and just plain) but Little Park definitely kicks this dish up a billion notches!I also ordered the beet risotto and that dish was great too. So colorful and flavorful. It was a little bit on the small side, but since I had the sprouts I was definitely satisfied at the end of my meal.My boyfriend ordered the duck and says it was one of the best he's ever tasted. He even ate the fatty part, which he normally doesn't do. That came with cous cous. He did note that the dish was very small, but since he had feasted on all that bread I mentioned earlier he was also left satisfied.We decided to skip the dessert because it seemed uninspired (I hate just getting ice cream at a restaurant), but now reading the reviews I think we'll have to go back to try that and the chocolate cake. The only thing is the rye cake now seems to come with white wine sorbet instead of ice cream? which is a shame! The menu is seasonal and changes from time to time so the delicious dish you have isn't guaranteed to be exactly the same the next time around :(We definitely will be returning and would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone we know!",1,0,0,Camille H.,"Brooklyn, NY",167,486,390

WHOLE WHEAT SPAGHETTI--semi-light semi-rich BOWL OF HEAVEN. Not too thick al dente fresh spaghetti with micro cubes of flavorful pork and subtle cabbage that looked like cheese.DRY-AGED DUCK AND KEBAB--STAR OF THE NIGHT. Medium rare, TENDER, FAT attached duck which reminded of Chinese country duck. Red quinoa added a fun, crunchy texture and concord grapes were juicy pockets of sugar. The kebab is duck SAUSAGE which was fatty DELICIOUSNESS. CHOCO RYE CAKE--perfect ending to a perfect meal. This is the most POPULAR DESSERT. The choco rye was a cross between semi-hard cake and a brownie. It contrasted well with the cold and rich hazelnut ice cream. The hazelnuts gave it a great crunch.Our waitress, Erika, was an absolute doll.

You step inside and the hostesses are actually helpful, the decor is insanely cool, and the service and food are both absolutely on point. This is definitely one of the best new restaurants in NYC right now.Ok first of all, even before my food came out I was reading a book and the manger out of nowhere brought over an extra candle so I could see better. That is service on a whole other level than most spots.And even if that didn't happen this would still be a 5-star review because the food was craaazy:1) Crispy Brussels Sprouts: Fried and dipped in a sweet/savory/sour sauce and served upon yummy little parsnip ribbons. So amazing.tie for 1) Kale Ravioli: Jeeze, these were as good as any pasta dish I have eaten at the equally amazing Bar Primi, which focuses on pasta. I believe these ravioli are seasonal so get them while you can. They have little bits of pickled onion alongside the rich ravioli which work really well together.2) Cinnamon Toast Ice Cream: As Mike C. mentioned, this is like the cereal milk ice cream at the Milk Bar but 100 times better. Served with crunchy strudel topping and tasting deeply of the namesake cereal, this is one of the best desserts in the city right now.3) Spiced Shellfish Ragu: This was good. I don't really dig duck but, for your main, you should probably go with the duck. However, if you are like me and just think duck tastes like weird chicken, this is a great second place.Honestly, Carmellini has mastered the art of opening great restaurants. The farm-to-table fare here is really inventive and really tasty and the service is unbelievably good. I think Locanda Verde is still better for straight up pasta, but if you are with a date who doesn't love carb-heavy meals or want to impress some friends from out of town, this is a solid bet.",6,0,0,Paul A.,"New York, NY",270,403,462

I am not sure if i just got unlucky, or if they are working out some kinks in the kitchen last night. The place itself is very nice and reminded me of being in someones kitchen. the service was amazing as well, maybe a little too over the top, but I kinda of expect that since they just opened.My waitress was wonderful and super knowledgeable about the menu which i appreciated.We started off the with Sunchokes which were amazing!! off to a good start. They tasted similar to potatoes but with a little more bitterness that i loved. For the main dishes, my bf got the spaghetti with pork, and I got the special for the night which was spaghetti with uni, egg, and bacon breadcrumbs. Both dishes sounded, and looked amazing...until the first bite. they were unbelievably salty. I get that uni, and the bacon breadcrumbs could add a saltyness to the dish but this was overwhelming. When our waitress asked us how we were enjoying our meals, we couldn't hide our dissatisfaction for them. She gracefully apologized and asked us what else she can get us. We decided to share the Kale Ravioli since that sounded delicious.and it was.... until i found a hair in the dish...ughhhhh ... really one thing after another. She immediately took away the dish. at this point, we were done. our waitress said she was going to send out a bunch of desserts for us which was very kind, and of course i couldnt refuse. She already knew which ones i had my eyes on. the desserts here were delicious, the saving grace. We shared the Chocolate rye cake, which was the winner, the Lemon fluff, and the Cinnamon toast crunch icecream which was also awesome.   all in all, i want to give them the benefit of the doubt.. however, my bf and i were celebrating our anniversary and it was a shame to have to send 3 dishes back to the kitchen. the app, dessert, and great service deserve 3 stars.you can check out my pics here instagram.com/p/vYR5oxkH…",6,2,3,Jessica H.,"Manhattan, NY",348,331,55
5.0,11/13/2014,"So happy to have Little Park in the TriBeCa neighborhood. Cozy/cute/relaxing ambiance. Attentive service. And most importantly, delicious food. The only average note in the meal was the fluke crudo, which was nothing special and could have used a touch more salt + acid. Other than that, everything was amazing. The crispy brussels sprouts were scrumptious and probably some of the best brussels sprouts I've ever had. The spatchcock chicken was so juicy and tender that I'm hoping the spatchcock cooking technique, which I'd never heard of before, becomes more mainstream. Cinnamon toast ice cream, which fulfilled the promise of its name and tasted like my favorite childhood cereal, was a perfect end to the meal. Everything was reasonably priced as well, especially considering the location and quality of food. Can't wait to go back.",3,1,1,Mili G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,0
5.0,11/12/2014,"Yet another new restaurant from Andrew Carmellini, and it happens to be one of the best of the several great spots he now has dominating lower NYC.Located pretty close to his first restaurant in NYC, Locanda Verde, this is another beautiful place to eat located in a hotel. There is a bustling bar up front, which was the site of most of the activity tonight, while the nice booths and larger tables remained comparatively quiet, though it did fill up as the night went on. I hear there is an excellent burger available at night at the bar, so that might explain some of the crowding over there. Instead, we had a very relaxing, perfect meal at a cozy booth, ordering plenty of stuff from the great menu:- Crispy Brussels Sprouts ($14)Starting off with a few vegetables (instead of appetizers or sides, the smaller section of the menu includes ""Raw & Cured"" and ""Autumn Vegetables""), this was an excellent start. The sprouts were really crispy, and went well with the sweetness of the also crispy apples. These were some of the better brussels sprouts I've had recently, which are often run of the mill, but these rose above that.- Fried Cauliflower ($12)More fried veggies, this was even better than the brussels sprouts. As beautifully plated as it was delicious, this is another great choice for one of the smaller vegetable plates.- Whole Wheat Spaghetti ($17)On to the carbs, this pasta dish was really incredible. Even better than the ones at his pasta-focused Bar Primi, this piping hot, sizable bowl of spaghetti was mixed with plenty of juicy pork and cabbage. With a perfectly al dente snap and a ton of flavor from the red waddle pork, this is a must order and the best of the larger dishes we tried.- Beetroot Risotto ($15)With a startlingly bright, pinkish-red appearance, this was another great dish. The risotto was delicious, especially combined with the salty, crumbled goat cheese sprinkled on top.- Steamed Black Bass ($24)This was a delicious piece of fish, but nothing particularly out of the ordinary. There were a ton of lentils completing the dish, which went well with the buttery soft fish.- Dry-Aged Duck & Kebab ($18)The better of the proteins we tried, this consisted of four amazing pieces of duck, with a thin, crispy strip of delicious fat on top, and a little piece of spicy kebab that also excellent. At $6 cheaper too, this is a definite no-brainer over the fish.- Cinnamon Toast Ice Cream ($8)The dessert here was some of the best I've had at a restaurant all year. I usually don't order ice cream at a restaurant, as it seems like a boring choice, but this one was definitely worth it. Kind of like Cinnamon Toast Crunch in ice cream form, it was so good, and everything you would hope Cereal Milk Ice Cream should taste like.- Chocolate Rye Cake ($12)This was really incredible. Arriving to the table with three little slices of the chocolate cake alongside some hazelnut ice cream and some peanuts scattered on the plate, it also comes with a little portion of chocolate sauce that is poured over the cake. Get a bite of that chocolatey cake soaked in that sauce, combined with some crunchy peanuts and the creamy hazelnut ice cream and it is perfection. Also, go ahead and pour the rest of the chocolate sauce left in the little cup over the cake, since it's so incredibly good.This ended up being a pricey meal, but only because we ordered so much. In fact, it's a rather reasonably priced place, considering the name attached to it, the TriBeCa hotel location, and the perfect service and atmosphere. The most expensive item tops out at just $24, with most of the rest of medium to large entrees at $14 - $20. I guess they kind of do get you by making all of the vegetable dishes pricier than normal ($12 - $18), but you can make a very solid meal here with extremely high quality food for a decent price.I would definitely return to try the rest of the menu since everything we tried was excellent. I would also like to try the burger at the bar, but will need to prepare to fight off the crowds.",24,11,12,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
4.0,11/11/2014,"Yay! First to review :)Little Park, Andrew Carmellini's new restaurant, sister restaurant to Bar Primi, Lafayette, the Dutch and Locanda verde. I dropped by this one week old restaurant at random on Tuesday night. On entering the restaurant, I immediately fell in love with the vibe - dim lit, warm and cozy; feels like inside a cabin. I picked a seat at the bar and bar tender timely handed over wine list. Well curated and extended; mostly old world wine segmented into ""coast"", ""island"" and ""river valley"" section. Onto the food. I had the Island Creek oyster from MA, fresh and briny. Exactly what I expected. The highlight tonight is the beetroot tartare.  Not your regular boring looking beet salad! It is seasoned with rye crumbs, dill and horseradish dressing, topped with smoked trout roe. Very in season. Love the slightly crunch texture mixing trout roe and chopped beets. The rye crumbs adds to the nutty, earthy taste. For main, I got the spiced shellfish ragu which is made of razor clams, cherry stone clams and mussels, simply seasoned with olive oil, fried garlic. Light yet packed with flavor. Overall very good experiences. Good food, good services and wine list. Located inside the Smyth Hotel, Little Park is a welcomed addition to the Tribeca food scene.Definitely come back and try out the brunch soon!",9,1,1,Nomad M.,"New York, NY",126,298,1138
