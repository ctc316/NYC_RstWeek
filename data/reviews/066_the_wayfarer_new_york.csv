4.0,3/30/2019,4 people one of whom has a handicap and uses a wheelchair. Why mention that ? Service with a smile. We had reservations which is a must for a Friday night. If you come in about 6:30 you will be faced with slower serving time as this place is popular with the pre theatre group. They arranged a table to fit us all comfortably taking care of the needs of our friend. Because of the crowd our drink order was taking a little longer than normal so the assistant manager jumped in and helped make the drinks and told us that round was complementary. Service with a smile. Food was also very good but sometimes a great dining experience is not just about the food.,2,0,0,Dan M.,"Old Bethpage, NY",112,477,133

1.0,3/17/2019,"Meh,  two stars because the food and service were fine, neither memorable nor remarkable. I would give management zero stars as they split the tab incorrectly and charged me twice which I am sure was an honest mistake. However, contacted them three times over the course of a week to have it corrected and although the assistant manager assured me each time it would be taken care of, it never was fixed. I had to call my credit card company myself and charge back half the bill. I emailed both the owner and GM, neither responded. Guess they don't care about their customer or their reputation. Very shabby.PS..a customer reported the same issue on 1/2/19...double billed, charged $360 instead of $90. CHECK YOUR CREDIT CARD STATEMENT!",0,0,0,Dave R.,"Rockville Centre, NY",0,2,0

We started with sushi that was fresh and tasty, along with the tater tots with caviar. We ordered one dessert for the table, but they gave us 2 more, all ended up being on the house, which was very kind of them. Those chocolate cookies are to die for!

3.0,1/5/2019,"My first dinner here was when they first opened and my meal was spectacular in every way, food, cocktails and outstanding service.My second dinner was not, so I never went back until September 2018 when I decided to try again.I ordered the octopus appetizer and the ribeye main course. Literally the best ribeye I have ever eaten and the octopus was spectacular as well. Outstanding service and great cocktails!I had dinner last week and eveything was just ok. Same octopus and ribeye dinner however the octopus was skimpy, same great flavor and outstanding potatoes but I was disappointed. The ribeye had the same great flavor and dipping sauce but the cut seemed thin and a third of the meat was chewy which I left on my plate. The steak was cooked rare instead of medium as I had requested. The waiter was ok at first however his disposition and service improved greatly as the meal progressed. The management is always outstanding!My three stars are about my inconsistent experiences at this restaurant.  I do like the decor though and since I live in the neighborhood it's convenient.  I may go back at some point because the employees are polite and they work very hard which I appreciate and admire.",0,0,0,Tommy S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0

4.0,1/3/2019,"I have to agree with other Yelpers who say this place is a little overpriced, but I will also admit that for some reason, I like it a lot.   It's also a five minute walk from my apartment, so that might have something to do with it.  But it's also a very relaxing place, with great drinks and very good food.Alp and I have been here for dinner a couple of times because it's so convenient and walking to 6th Avenue for dinner seems a little more refined than walking to some place on 9th Avenue.   Service tends to be a bit all over the place but usually ends up being pretty good when they see we are going to eat, drink and then eat and drink some more!Over the course of our meals, we have had chicken dumplings, fried cheese curds with olives (curds are amazing) and buffalo meatballs (seriously mouthwateringly good) and short rib mac and cheese (a bit much for me) for starters.  For sides, I've had the fries and the saffron mashed potatoes. Loved the fries but the saffron overpowered the taters so I was not a fan.   For entrees, I have had the NY Strip as well as the ribeye steak.  Both were good, but the ribeye was much better.  Apparently they have seafood too, but I like my meat with feet!For desserts, the apple tart was good but the chocolate hazelnut cake was super delicious.  This feels to me like a nice local spot to have a laid back dinner, although I've never gotten out of there for less than $300 on dinner for two.  But, what the heck, I'm worth it and so is my baby.",26,12,23,Bill T.,"New York, NY",1361,2290,9300
1.0,1/2/2019,"My family and I went to Wayfarer right after Christmas. There were 7 of us, including 2 minor children. The service was excellent, food was also great. And then we got our check. We split it in 2, 50/50 between 2 families. The check was about $180, so our part was about $90. We made sure that the tip was not included in the bill and left a generous amount for the waitress who took care of us. Once we left the restaurant I got a notification from my credit card company that there were 2 charges made - for the original amount we paid and another $70+, which didn't make sense. So I called the credit card company and asked them to monitor both until they got cleared. I also called the restaurant and asked them to clarify those charges. A few days later - our part of the bill was nulled, and $160 charge was posted. I called my brother-in-law who was splitting the check with us, and it turned out they were charged the same amount. So they charged us $320 while the check was only $180, which is outrageous. Given that it happened to both of us I can't help but find myself suspicious of a scam. I'd like to know if anyone else had a similar experience in this establishment, especially since there were a lot of family parties that day, probably 3 or 4 parties of 7 walked in while we were waiting for our table.",1,0,0,Zhanna A.,"Manhattan, NY",13,1,0

2.0,12/25/2018,"Came here for Christmas dinner and ordered from their Christmas menu. Had reservations. Pros: Nice ambiance with a variety of seating arrangements. There were a lot of people but we weren't squished together. The hostess was friendly and our water was refilled promptly. We didn't have to wait long to be seated. Cons: Aside from water being refilled promptly, the service was poor. The waitress and servers were all fairly unhappy or indifferent. When we paid, we were asked if we needed change and when we said no, the waitress walked away without so much as a good night or smile. Neither appetizer was warm or hot, although they should have been. The steak was cold. Both the macorni and cheese, and steak were too salty (especially the macaroni and cheese). Although our appetizers and main courses arrived in a reasonable amount of time, our desserts took quite a while despite coffee being served. The mousse on our dessert had spread/melted, which means our desserts probably sat out for a while. All in all, it was, unfortunately, a lousy meal that was nowhere near worth the cost ($122 for two people, no alcoholic drinks and only one coffee).",0,0,0,Jo R.,"Montreal, Canada",0,5,0

1.0,11/22/2018,"My family and I made reservations at this restaurant for Thanksgiving dinner. We went into the meal with lowered expectations, understanding that on such a busy day service may be a bit slower due to increased customers. Even with our low expectations in mind, the experience was abysmal. We were seated right away yet it took 20-30 minutes just to place our drink order - even though during this period of time several staff members stopped by our table to refill our water glasses. Our appointed server was much too busy to be concerned with taking our order that he instructed another staff member to do so right in front of our table. Most of our party ordered the traditional turkey entree and were shocked to receive a plate of cold food. This was likely due to the fact that our entrees were brought out while our first courses were still on the table. The staff was eager to fix the situation, however it took at least another 20 minutes for hot meal replacements to be brought out. The half of our party who received meals at an appropriate temperature had to eat while the other half had to sit and wait for the situation to be corrected - this is not how any of us envisioned our Thanksgiving meal. To top it off, once we were completely finished with the meal we waited another 20 minutes for our server (who was in sight of our table but just standing around) to acknowledge our motions indicating that we had concluded our meal. We went into this restaurant hoping for an enjoyable family dinner and instead spent over two hours irritated and unhappy at an establishment that we intend to never visit again.

I got myself a cappuccino to start with, which comes in quite big a size and very strong! Just the way I like it. My husband got the salmon Benedict which comes with sides of potato and salad. He really loved his dish. The Salmon is topped with egg, so it's definitely very filling and perfect for brunch. I ordered the risotto which is cooked with truffle oil and cauliflower. Omg I am not a bit risotto fan but this was something. You won't be able to resist just with the smell as it's places in front of you. So so good!

It was really light and perfect for the 92 degree day. I would've loved a bit more cardamom, because I could barely taste it. Everyone loved their drinks.For my meal I ordered the smoked salmon platter (salmon, onion, tomato, capers, cucumber, served with a bagel). I had the choice of plain or everything bagel, and chose everything. They brought it out with vegetable cream cheese and the salmon was delicious. I wish they would've asked if/how I like the bagel toasted (I didn't think of it either). It was fine, but if I were making this at home, I would've toasted it juuuust a bit more. And some people don't like their bagels toasted at all. The meal was nice, and our waiter was super friendly and attentive. My husband enjoyed his burger, and the truffle fries were amaaaazing.

The bartenders are great (and consistent). They'll remember you if you're a regular. I love the ambiance of the Wayfarer it has high ceilings and big, open windows which is nice during the spring and summer.  My favorite drink of all time was the Wisteria, which had shishito pepper infused gin, lavender, honey, and peach bitters, which is no longer on the menu but the fact that they came up with it, I mean, come on. My second favorite drink is the gypsy which is cucumber infused vodka, strawberry yuzu, and chili  delicious! And I believe that's still on the menu. I just went here for lunch with co workers the other day and everything was great. I had the steak salad with Burrata. The burrata was so creamy and the steak was perfectly charred on the edges yet still medium rare. I shared a yellow tail sushi roll with a colleague, which was also great. You have to try the bread with their home made olive spread - it's out of this world even if you don't like olives. Great service. Great food. Great drinks.

The main course... the New York style steak was just a big chunk of meat, no flavor but the rip eye was okay. On top of all the service was just as dry as everything else. We found it hilarious when we just couldn't get the ice water we requested four times but just room temp water. We gave up calling the server again because by then we felt like we were being nuisance to him or something. Slightly over a half hr with over $200 bill - not the best spent time and the money.

I went in on a Thursday night to grab a bite and they were active, but I certainly wouldn't say they were slammed. I got a glass of water from what I assume was a busser, and a menu have to be by a guy that could have been a waiter, but since he didn't work to be I can't be sure. I know a one top isn't your idea of fun, but I tip well, and eat fairly quickly. Plus I waited tables in high school so I'm pretty lenient on service. But I had time to call around and find another restaurant and leave. The only person who noticed was the hostess who was literally the only person in the restaurant to acknowledge me. Since there are literally thousands of restaurants in midtown I hope this was anomaly because this was truly awful. Will never attempt to eat here again.",0,0,0,Joshua H.,"The Colony, TX",17,2,0
1.0,4/8/2018,I heard good reviews about this place and ordered the Amish Chicken without the sauce (I'm allergic to onions) and I get literally a plain piece of chicken. And No sides. I ordered some fries and other sides and literally got chicken which they charged me FULL PRICE for $29 to be exact. Horrible. When I called to complain- the manager never called me back. I called 3 times! I even emailed. I will tell others about how bad the customer service is here.,0,2,0,Elise B.,"Burbank, CA",131,26,2

They offer a full and extremely well-stocked bar with a professional bartender on duty at 9 AM.  Alert and at attention, even though the orders for his services were sparse. Love that.We came in Wednesday morning. Had a ham and cheese omelette, pancakes, waffle and eggs benedict. All were really really good. The benedict was made with real hollandaise, made from scratch.  Yummy. Just the right amount of lemon. And the eggs were perfectly poached. This dish is tricky and easy to do poorly if you cut corners.  It was great here.  Plus plenty of good coffee and good service.

I really enjoyed the Amish chicken breast on their dinner menu. The chicken was very well cooked and juicy, and came with a pickled cranberry sauce and a side of bread pudding. It reminded me of a nice Thanksgiving meal. The pork chop was also good, but I definitely preferred the chicken. The main courses are a bit on the pricey side, but nothing out of the ordinary for this area. For dessert we got the apple tart which had an amazing croissant like crust, and came with some vanilla ice cream. Would definitely recommend!",0,0,0,Audrey T.,"New York, NY",4,219,4

3.0,3/23/2018,I'd probably enjoy my meal more if the staff didn't suck. The 3 stars is definitely for the food. The oysters were fresh and super cold. Cleaned very well. Just the way it should be. I felt the cheese and charcuterie board was not worth it and didn't have any good choices. The crab cake was delicious and the slaw that accompanied it was basically cole slaw. The tuna poke was good however i felt the uneven cuts of tuna made it hard to eat and to share. The gruyere whipped potatoes definitely needed some salt and also the steak. The burger was great. And it was nice of them to cut it in half when they knew my guests were sharing it. My only complaint would be the server. He was not attentive. We had to ask for things several times as well as repeat ourself. The hostess in front was also a bit cold. I think the manager (one in glasses and suit) was overall the best along with the bus boy.

At the back, they had nice table seating with interesting artworks and decor on the wall. They also had fully stacked bar with beautiful marble counter. They have complimentary bread that was not the usual complimentary bread. It looked more like croissants, but then I found out it is their homemade popovers, comes with olive spread. I am not a big fan of olive, but for olive lovers, this is certainly a nice treat.We started off with a couple of cocktails. They were good and strong, nice flavor and elegant. Not too sweet but good amount of sweetness to it.For appetizer, we ordered Lobster & Corn Chowder, Roasted Mushroom & Chorizo, and Charred Octopus. The soup was a bit too salty but tasty. Others were good too. For the main, we had Spice Crusted Big Eye Tuna, Black Sea Bass, and Short Rib & Mac N' Cheese. The tuna was too spicy to the point it overpowered the tuna. Sea bass was was a bit dry... The only dish that was great was the Mac N' Cheese, it was really awesome! We had some desserts, which were all nice but the only one I really enjoyed was Profiterole Sundae, which was a fun dessert. We had a nice dinner here, relaxing and comforting. The food was not amazing, but mostly a-ok. I say there is a hit-and-miss at this restaurant.

She ordered the burger and their whipped scallop potatoes which are definitely worth substituting for the fries. I ordered the short rib Mac and cheese which is so good you don't even care about the about of calories you've just consumed!

3.0,2/5/2018,So I went to this restaurant for lunch I ordered the raw bar for 1 which is  basically like an appetizer. I don't complain in any restaurant when my food  is brought out especially when it comes to seafood because in the winter in NYC you really can't expect a lot.  Upon receiving my meal I noticed that the clams and the oysters were barely visible on the plate. Meaning they were extremely small. Now I know I only went for lunch but I inquired and was told that it was the only size that they had available. The owner did bring me a substitute but I was disturbed that the menus didn't indicate what size clams or oysters were being served. I inquired before I purchased and my waitress lacked the knowledge of what was even on the menus mentioning that it was new. she and the manager  looked at me crazy when I asked questions as if I wasn't supposed to know the little neck clams were not the only type of clams.

My waiter was also very attentive and sweet. He had me fill out a comment card at the end of my meal which asked for my birthday. I put ""Today!""

Our package included breakfast at the attached Wayfarer.  I was anxious to eat there as I read good reviews and wanted to purchase a gift card for my friend's birthday next month.  We are used to getting and needing our coffee in a timely fashion.  After waiting 15 minutes I asked the bus girl walking near us if we could have two coffees.  No expression whatsoever on her face even though she looked at me.  Once again, no coffee.  Then finally when our waiter came we asked again. This time we received our coffee without spoons. Bus girl walked by again and I asked her for 2 spoons.  Finally, another waiter walked by and fulfilled our request.  I feel sorry for the Manager as all complaints will fall on them.  You just have one rude bus girl and this will cost you business.

The potatoes that came with the steak and eggs entree was also very crispy. Aside from being overlooked, everything was extremely bland.

I arrived on foot, sans sunglasses, to a restaurant that thankfully had plenty of seating on a Monday night, unlike my first choice in the neighborhood. I've had drinks here before but felt the need for some light nourishment so a corner table it was, perfect for people watching and observation.The space is indeed large with plenty of room for gatherings of all sorts of sizes. I can easily see corporate parties co-mingling with tourists here.The ""snacks"" section of the menu had my name on it and I gravitated towards the cheese and charcuterie board like a moth to a light bulb.The cocktail menu is split up into two sections: signature cocktails and arctic chillers. The ""Nomad"" seemed appropriate, given the name of the restaurant and key ingredients of camapri and Bulleit rye. Cocktails are priced at $15.The star of the charcuterie board was neither meat nor cheese but rather the cherry mostarda. I could apply this spreadable delight to just about anything and embrace the emerging taste. It's like a magical paint that can transform a bland, dull existence into a colorful room of fun.All other charcuterie components were in line with expectations.The service, however, was far too slow and negligent for a not so busy evening.

A lot of people were ordering the burger which seemed like a big hit. We got a sushi platter and some rolls. Nothing to write home about - the food was overpriced but understandable given the location. The 2 stars is because we received sub-par service and ate just okay food - examples here are waiting around 10 minutes each for a menu after being seated and for a bill to come out. I would understand if they were really busy but they seemed well staffed just a bit chaotic. Maybe we caught them on an off night because other reviewers rave about their service.

Try to make a reservation in advance because its a bit of a hot spot and is usually crowded. The staff is welcoming, friendly and wants to ensure that you have a great experience. It's a large, beautifully decorated restaurant with the bottom floor as the main dining room and the top floor being for private dining/events. It is a rather expensive restaurant but it's worth the price. The restaurant serves classic american fare and ranges from sushi, to filet mignon, to diver scallops. They change certain menu items depending on the season which speaks to the love and care that they put into the menu. The last time I went for dinner, I started off with The Vagabond cocktail which is basically a spicy mezcal, tequila margarita and it's delicious! I'm always one to opt for a spicy marg. I had the fried cheese & olives as an app, the short rib mac & cheese as entree and the pumpkin cheesecake as dessert. This was pretty much the meal of my dreams (don't count the calories.) I make sure I go every Fall to get the pumpkin cheesecake with vanilla whipped cream and ginger snap crust. Its my favorite item on the menu and I would even recommend going there just for dessert.

4.0,8/19/2017,"I came here with a friend for a NYC restaurant week dinner. Although it was a good deal for restaurant week, the food was not stellar enough for me to justify the exorbitant cost of returning, except maybe for very special occasions. To be clear, the food was delicious and the portion sizes were surprisingly decent-- just not amazing enough.To start, my friend and I shared the fried green tomatoes and seared salmon sushi. The bacon bits, roast corn and green onion bits on top of the fried green tomatoes paired superbly with the sauce and were delightfully crisp. The green tomato itself was also fried very well, though I couldn't really taste the tomato itself. The sushi was good-- a delicate layer of finely vinegared rice wrapped around very fresh asparagus and topped with finely sliced salmon. For our entrees, my friend and I had the asparagus & vegetable rissoto and the salmon. The rissoto was a great mix of textures and flavors-- the perfectly chewy and creamy rissoto was great with the fresh vegetables and occasional saltiness of the pecorino. There was a bit of an odd sour back-of-the-throat taste though at the end. The salmon was very well cooked (medium rare is the way to go!) and delicately flaked off with a touch of our forks. The soba noodles were also delicious and innovative. For dessert, we had the chocolate pudding and the polenta shortcake. I only had a bite of the chocolate pudding, but it was just dark enough to be great and the cream on top was fantastic. I won't comment on the polenta shortcake, because I was trying it for the first time and I think I just might not like polenta shortcake. But I disliked how sweet the cherry compote was-- tasted too closely to cherry-flavored candies.Finally, some comments on service and ambience. Our waiter was friendly and courteous. As for ambience, the low lit chandeliers, which created a cozy, intimate and upscale atmosphere. Then I peered closer at the lights to find that they were incandescent, which is a majorly inefficient energy source and highly harmful to the environment.

My only complaint is that the tomatoes were a bit hard. Perhaps just a bit under cooked?2nd course - mushroom tagliatelle pasta - Very good. It was mixed with a light cream sauce, mushrooms and carrots. Unfortunately it was a little heavy and I took half of it back to the office for lunch the next day!3rd course - chocolate pudding - This was really rich and decadent. Amazing flavors. It came with whipped cream, a cookie wafer and chocolate shavings on top. It was definitely too rich to finish but was good.I would recommend coming here, especially for restaurant week.",1,1,1,Katharine S.,"Arlington, VA",378,656,518

Ever even met a manager ( I'm in the hospitality business) and have never had a comped during much less a comp tab. Keep in mind the 2 girls have never been here b4 as they had mo idea where the bathrooms were.

The sauce that came with was decent and I soaked it up with the bread. We also ordered the burrata which was a tiny piece of cheese surrounded wiht some limp vegetables. We ordered a tuna roll mostly because I was craving sushi but I don't recommend it. Don't order sushi from a place that also serves burrata. My entree was the kale and chicken salad. kale was limp.

We also ordered a shrimp cocktail, pretty standard and no frills here.For lunch, i had a shrimp and lobster burger, which was really satisfying. I'm not really a fry snob, but the french fries that came with it were really delicious.

We got in and out and had a nice ""grown up"" dinner before he got fidgety. The NY Stripe was very good and I really enjoyed the Charred Brussels Sprouts.

Really?  I thought taste was subjective. It was completely inappropriate to tell us he was right and we were wrong. The manager brought out our next selection, this time a 2015 that was listed as a 2013. He then proceeded to take it away from the table. Five minutes later we asked our very competent waiter where our wine was. He said oh it will be right here. The manager came back with the bottle already opened and poured it. We suspect he poured the first bottle into the second just to prove a point. We should have rejected the bottle that was not opened in front of us but we didn't want to get into a fight with the guy.

Wandered around checking out various restaurants 4 and 5 star, menus generally the same and nothing that looked particularly appetizing. Not so here. Several interesting starters and entrees got me in the door, ended up having a very tough time making decisions - multiple small dishes or appetizer and one of several tempting entrees. Adventuresome menu and well executed. Really really tasty. I had the deviled eggs with chicken something (spiced fried chicken skin) and salmon eggs on rye toasts. Great flavors ! After inquiring further about several items on the menu, had the steak tartare roll, which is a sushi roll of steak tartare, with egg soft poached in miso or similar sauce on the side as the dip. Loved it. Didn't add wasabi because I wanted to taste the tartare and egg, but probably also a great flavor / heat impact.Had to splurge, everything was too awesome not to. Went for a yellowtail jalapeño sushi roll. Again, great combinations of flavors! Waitstaff very knowledgeable and good at explaining. Definitely coming back, and would highly recommend.

4.0,11/28/2016,My husband and I found this restaurant by doing a yelp search. It had decent reviews so we made a reservation for Monday night at 8pm. Its located on a corner with tons of windows so you're able to watch everyone passing by. When we arrived it wasn't very busy. Maybe 3-4 tables full. We were sat in the middle of the restaurant. The noise level isn't too bad. They had music playing lightly over the speakers. Our waiter was very kind but he seemed like was really busy. I think one of the tables was taking up a lot of his time and energy. To start my husband and I ordered the dragon roll. Most of their appetizers are not gluten free so you're best option is to get sushi. The dragon roll was awesome. The eel practically melted in your mouth. For my meal I ordered the scallops with pork belly. It came with a quail egg. The scallops weren't seared as much as I'd care for. They still had a chewy texture to them. The pork belly however was cooked perfectly. It had a caramelized flavor to it. My husband got the grilled pork chop. It came with a twice baked potato and asparagus. He said his meal was very good. I tried the twice baked potato and it was great. Overall the food was very good. The only hiccup was the time to which we got our food. I think the kitchen may have forgotten about our order because we watched people who sat after us get their food before us. Our wait time for food was almost 30 minutes after ordering. Our waiter was very kind though and apologized for the long wait. Attire is nice/casual. I wore a nice black fur top with jeans and boots. My husband wore a button down top and jeans. I wouldn't recommend wearing a t-shirt and hole-y jeans here but you can definitely dress semi casual.I would definitely recommend stopping in here if visiting NYC or if you're local!,4,1,2,Stefanie L.,"Dallas, TX",2519,1043,1868

The person who ordered the apple pie loved it but I was too full myself so I can't vouch.  The wine list was good but NY pricey.  I skipped the fancy cocktail list but couldn't resist an Irish coffee at the end and it was made like a real Irish coffee.  Great night!,1,0,1,Amy O.,"Glencoe, IL",182,337,382

I didn't  try the tartar but it looked absolutely delicious.   The steak looked like it was mixed with onions and other veges.  It came with two toasts and salad  greens. I had the skillet fried bronzino (filet) over mushrooms.   The fish was delicious with skin crispy the way I like.   There is no sauce served with the dish,  but as the ingredients are fresh,  none was needed.   That being said,  as much as I liked the dish,  I preferred the bronzino dish from the Lure Fishbar.   I also ordered two sides (string beans with crispy onions and truffle fries) which I split with another coworker.  The string beans were actually haricot verts and were delicious.   I loved that it wasn't drenched in butter but instead were sautéed with olive oil and salted. Yum.   The truffle fries are amazing.  One of the better truffle fries I've had. The portions here are large.  I normally get the app and main,  but I was so stuffed just with the main dish and shared sides. The drinks here are pretty amazing.   I'm not a big drinker but the wayfarer cocktail was quite tasty with a spicy kick. The service was amazing.   Our server definitely took particular attention to our table  (maybe bc we were a big party of 8).

The food at Wayfarer is good, though pricey, and the service is very good. This is a semi-upscale restaurant where folks go after work for a drink at the lovely bar, or have a meeting or bring a date. At night there are groups of people and couples having dinner.  One thing that consistently makes this place a non-favorite is the music track that's played. A few nights ago it was 80's music: Madonna, Boy George, etc. I asked the waiter if any other patrons questioned the music selections and they told me that it happens often, and folks complain. So why they haven't changed it to something more appropriate (soft jazz, lounge) is a mystery. A few months ago I went in for a nice Sunday brunch, only to hear Beyonce. Sorry, but that's not the kind of music I want with my brunch, and therefore we think twice about going the Wayfarer.

When I made the reservation I told them that my boyfriend was a large person and would require a larger table (try feeding a NFL offensive lineman) there's A LOT on the table. It was kind of them to accommodate us at a later table. The front door staff was very sweet. We asked for tea and coffee. It took them two times around to give us honey that we asked for.  We ordered avocado toast to start, it was really good (my favorite). My boyfriend ordered salmon Benedict and I had the steak and eggs. They forgot to put the hollandaise sauce on his sandwich and they gave me the wrong style eggs. I hate complaining when it comes to food but it was a little too much. Our food was cold by the time they came back with the sauce and my eggs. They didn't even take our entree anyway, which most places with brunch prices as theirs would do. My boyfriend was a little upset, but I've work in a Tom Colicchio restaurant and know what goes on when the kitchen is backed up. The manager came to the table and apologized and gave us complimentary chocolate chip cookies. That was kind of him. However, The dining area was beautiful!

5.0,12/23/2015,"The Wayfarer is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC, which is saying a lot considering that there are so many places to eat and munch. But, I love their menu. From sushi to steak tartare as appetizers to entrees the size of my head, each meal is flavor packed. I often vacillate between what I want versus what I can actually eat (my eyes are definitely too big for my stomach), and it takes me a few minutes to order. I want it all! The bread with that olive spread is major. Once you take a bite of that, you know you're in for a decadent meal. One of the things I look for when dining is the pacing of the meal and every time I've eaten here, the pacing is on point. Tonight, we shared the steak tartare, the pork chops and the prime rib, because we're clearly on a diet. We also ordered the apple pie as dessert, which you simply must. It comes out pipping hot, crunchy and flaky on the outside, apple-y gooey on the inside. I also got to meet David Burke, which made my night! I'm a huge fan of his and he was so sweet, I could tell that his culinary skills were definitely passed on to the executive chef. Will I come back here? Is my name not Soo Jin Kim? Yes friends, I'll be back.",3,2,2,Soo Jin K.,"Oakland, CA",590,389,558

4.0,12/20/2015,"Fabulous.My self, my brother in law and his fiance, all stopped in here for lunch recently while out doing some shopping nearby; and was quite thankful we chose this place to accommodate us for lunch this afternoon, for we were all greatly impressed with our experience.The ambiance is lively, open and well designed. It was about a 20 min wait to get a table, which lead us to the bar area to wait. While waiting, we were able to peruse the delectably appealing menu they offer. Everything sounded outstanding, which lead us all to be a bit indecisive.We were then taken to our table. We had all by now decided upon what we wanted. For drinks, I went with their "" Green Drink"" which consisted of : cucumber, kale, pear, lemon, and some additional greens($8.00). They ordered Iced Tea. For food, I went with their Lobster Cobb Salad that comes with a Basil Ranch Dressing.I believe my fellow companions went with some sort of steak salads, but I cannot honestly recall, because I was quite anxious to get my lobster on :)The Green Drink turned out fantastic tasting - fresh, invigorating, along with just a settle amount of sweetness from the pear. Now for my salad, not only did it arrive exquisitely appealing, it turned out to be utterly, superbly delicious!!! Each component that made up the salad, was perfect in every way : fresh ripe avocados, perfectly crisp bacon, vibrantly colored tomato's along with the rich succulent pieces of lobster- oh, and the basil ranch dressing? Heaven! This was one of the most enjoyable salads I have had in a long time. And, it was well worth the slightly steeper price. Everyone else loved their dishes as well.

2.0,12/15/2015,I expected this place to blow me away based on their social media presence and being inside the Quin hotel. The menu looked good and it was close by so we went around 4 pm on a Saturday. We were given the brunch menu which was disappointing because we were looking for heartier options and were very limited. The steak salad I got was great but I wanted more to choose from. Service was pretty terrible with our server coming over maybe twice during the meal. I had coffee which is something you look to refill and I had to ask a couple of times. That kind of devalues the whole walrus coffee mug thing they do. Unfortunately it kind of turned us off and we probably won't be back.,0,0,0,Nicole G.,"New York, NY",112,54,32

5.0,11/22/2015,"After what had been quite a day for us all in our own right, my best friends and I walked in to The Wayfarer to unwind over a cocktail. Now I say this having been in the industry for quite some time now- BUT, this was without a doubt one of the best experiences I've had in New York in all of the years I've lived here. First of all, the atmosphere is just stunning- the lighting couldn't be more perfect, the music was on point, and the libations were all so incredible, it was truly hard to choose what direction to head in. Second of all, Alanna and Richard- the two magicians behind the bar- were absolute artists not just in their creative concoctions, but in their presentation of them and in their delivery. They both could not have been more gracious, kind, and just absolute fun to be around. It's a lost art these days- the art behind a beautiful cocktail, the genuine nature of those behind the creation of said cocktail, and the compassion and warm energy of both the environment and the people within it. That art though is nowhere near lost, but can actually be found at The Wayfarer. Thank you, especially Alanna and Richard, for such a wonderful, uplifting evening.

4.0,11/22/2015,"We stopped in at The Wayfarer for a drink before a show at City Center. We sat at the bar. It's a nice, classic-feeling bar. The bartenders were friendly and attentive.My wife ordered wine and I ordered The Gadabout, a drink in their specialty cocktails menu. The menu says it's made with gin, Campari, passion fruit, and angostura bitters. When I asked the bar tender about the drink, he said it also has lime juice. I was expecting something fairly bitter because of the Campari, like a Negroni. It was actually pretty sweet due to the passion fruit. It was a very nice drink.We also ordered some sushi roll appetizers. I wasn't sure we should be ordering sushi in a restaurant like this but we wanted something light and sushi seemed the best fit. We ordered the spicy tuna roll. It was very good! It wasn't particularly spicy but it had a good amount of very fresh tasting tuna. We were encouraged to order another roll, this time a dragon roll. Again, it was very good. The menu says it's made with 'BBQ Sea Eel,' which you probably know as unagi, that was lightly cooked with a good sauce. The only minor nit we had was the wasabi. It was pretty dry and crumbly, making it difficult to eat. Luckily, the flavor was ok.At $14 for the Gadabout, $12 for the wine and $16 and $21 for the sushi, it ended up being pretty expensive (almost $100 with a second round of drinks and tip). No complaints, as we thoroughly enjoyed the drinks and sushi, but it was pretty expensive for not a lot of food.

It was really a great experience. Girlfriend ended up showing up, so instead of getting meals we just ordered a bunch of different appetizers, drinks, and dessert. It was delicious. The oysters were so fresh and exactly what we wanted. The drinks were delicious, the service was good, and the steak tartare was unbelievable.

5.0,9/28/2015,"Wayfarer is located few blocks away from my office so one day I took my mommy there for a quick drink and desserts-ladies night. Really nice looking spot which pleases eyes from entrance- I loved their elegant contemporary design with dash of American luxuriousness. Dark wood tables, suede silver and beige booth and chairs,lots of lights and mirrors-great spot to be be seen and for people watching.Mom and I stopped by for a quick drink and ordered a cocktail and banana split- both very yummy. I loved the presentation of the split-looked like a yellow canoe swimming in deliciousness. My cocktail was yummy, lovely hostesses were complimenting on my fancy jewelry, manager with her hot looking high heels stopped by to check on us-so I felt good, I was thinking ""Hm, I guess I am important!"".So next steps was to take my boyfriend there to show him how what a big shot VIP I was. I got there this Sunday for a lazy brunch and had a lovely table right at the center was waiting for us just like I wanted. Place was almost full yet atmosphere was relaxing since everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves and generally having a good time. Ambiance is very important for my digestive system so I liked it.  Bf ordered chicken paillard and loved it even though he is not usually a big fan of chicken dishes. I decided to play it safe this time and ordered omelette with goat cheese, mushroom and spinach-but got to say, they did an amazing job with it. It was delicious and you could actually feel the flavors. So you would say-""it is omelette, its easy to make"" but not so fast-it is not easy to make it with goat cheese since a lot of places do not know how to manage the strong and salted flavor of goat cheese. I need one paragraph to write about sushi though. So I decided to balance safe with risky dish and ordered Fried chicken sushi-I know, fried and sushi cannot go together. However, OMG-it was so freaking good. I typically hate fried chicken and guess what? I ate it all-without wasabi or anything. Please do yourself a favor and order the rolls if they have it as a special of the day. Very delicate flavors and texture yet so fresh and perfectly balanced combination.To die for!Once we were done, I started chatting with Anna, who is one of the managers in her killer heels and Walid (one of the manager who has the best last name which translate to Diamond) and were given a tour of the upstairs since I saw it from outside twice but never been too. I went there and saw Man Men'esque really cool lounge for a after work drinks.

2.0,6/21/2015,"Ate brunch at the bar on Saturday June 20th.  Wayfarer has a lot of potential, but misses the mark.THE GOOD...Chicken Club was good.  Friend had lobster salad,  which was really tasty.  I also had the house rum cocktail.  Cocktail was tasty & well made.  Friend enjoyed a decent Cotes de Provence rosé offering from VieVite.  The dining room is very attractive.   Bar seating is comfy. THE BAD...Bartender was nice,  but in the weeds. Her bar area was pretty busy.  Two managers on duty - a tall bearded guy with a top knot hairstyle and a little brunette Hispanic guy - were comfortably seated in a booth near the bar.  They were of no help.  Both were focused on their cell phones instead of the guests or staff.   The few moments not spent staring into the phones were dedicated to making small talk with the hostess.   Never once saw them interact with a guest or assist the staff.  These two should've seen that the bartender was busy and helped out by taking guest orders and completing drink tickets at the service bar.  Do something,  please.   There was a barback, but he was tasked to bar prep like juicing limes and cutting garnishes...which he did without gloves or washing hands.  The bartender was really on her own, so service was slow and clunky.  Not her fault.  Took a long time to get menus.  Took a long time to place the order.  Food arrived well before our rolled-up flatware and napkins, so we sat waiting with our meals in front of us.  My biggest critique of the bartender was that she was handling everything bare handed,  from the POS system to dirty dishes to drink garnishes to ice and to the unwrapped straw that went in my cocktail...and she did it all without ever stopping to wash her hands.  Right before serving my rum cocktail she actually stirred it with the straw I was supposed to drink from, and she did it with her dirty thumb and forefinger on top of my straw.   She seemed a little confused when I immediately asked for a new straw.  Don't think she even realized that I didn't want to taste her fingers.   She proceeded to bare-hand offer me another unwrapped straw.   I decided to drink directly from the glass.  Some other things that detracted from the experience: my meal was under attack by a lot of bar fruit flies; an ill dining room server - big brunette guy with a trimmed beard - was coughing into his hands then handling drinks at the service bar; lots of loud bickering/arguing between the dining room server staff and the bartender at the service bar; freshly washed glassware was transported into the bar area in their racks, while dripping all over the ice and prep area of the oyster shucker.  Just a little more manager oversight would really help improve the Wayfarer.",0,1,1,Patrick F.,"New York, NY",92,47,46

We were given some excuse regarding that the coffee guys in back were making coffee as fast as they could, but with the restaurant maybe 1/3 full, I'm not sure as to what that meant. We also were never offered refills of coffee and when we did ask for some, they were promised, but never delivered. While I might come back again as the food was good, I'll be sure to avoid our waiter. And probably bring a bottle of water just in case.",1,0,0,Dan F.,"New York, NY",8,46,0

The quality is there, always arriving that touch above what you'd get elsewhere.Drink menu was great, I had an old fashion, which was well prepared.

5.0,3/20/2015,"So, we're walking through the city, on the way uptown, and it's late Sunday morning and hunger strikes. We happen to be on the corner of the Wayfarer, look at the menu - pricey, but some good choices, so let's do this!Once we sit, we get handed a card, and the hostess is talking up how they got voted in something or other for best bloody mary bar. So this is how it works, there's a card with a checklist and you get to build your own bloody mary. This is fun, I'm sold. You pick your base, rim, alcohol, and 3 garnishes. Not here to toot my own horn, but my combo came out pretty good (except the fried pork rind- don't be fooled, its actually just a soggy piece of foam). I would've loved another but it was the end of the weekend and I could no longer afford another, so I sipped reallll slow.So this brings us to the food. I got chicken and waffle. A MAZING. Chive waffles with a perfectly crisp chicken fried in a spicy sauce served with GRAVY. So good so good so good. I was surprised how large the portion was to, I couldn't finish (though I tried my best to). My boyfriend got the huevos rancheros which was over easy egg served on a tortilla smothered in black beans, served with avocado and all the Mexican goodnesses that come with huevos rancheros. I wish I could eat that over again every week. It was such a pleasant little impromtu pick to end the weekend.My only complaint was that service was a little slow, and they messed up our garnishes on our bloody marys, but it wouldn't stop me from going back.",5,0,4,Kaitlin M.,"Babylon, NY",210,172,189

The burgers were good, but nothing to shout about. The fries were very good. We were impressed enough with this place that we returned for breakfast on Monday morning. I had the eggs benedict and my wife had the French toast. Both portions were very large. The eggs were poached perfectly, and the hollandaise sauce was just right. The French toast was good, but was a little too sweet in my opinion. We had a side of bacon, and that was average.

For $18.00 they give you the smallest portion with barely any lobster. I ordered the gigantic prawns and for $35.00 my prawns were not giant at all. They are actually really small and lacked taste. My boyfriend ordered a 29.00 chicken dish which was plain and boring. We also ordered the Cobb salad for starters and it was small and also tasteless.The entire menu is just out of touch. As far as drinks, definitely to high. The cocktails are about 17-20 bucks which is high for that area. Glass of house wine is about 17!

We waited for her to get the menus and water. At this point, our son whose birthday we were celebrating, wanted to leave. He had asked to dine here based on a previous visit with his dad who dines out often for business. What a disappointment! I had to talk him into staying, but I wish I had listened and walked out. Our server was the rudest we have ever had. Clearly she hates her job. She never came by the table to see if we needed anything. The server helping her was almost equally rude.

There is something for every taste.The cocktails are equally creative with concoctions like The Wayfarer - ZU Bison Grass Vodka, lime, agave, baked apple bitters, celery bitters, dusted black cardamom. Sexy Beest - Bombay Sapphire Gin, benedectine, cardamom honey, yuzu, all spice dram, fresh ginger, finished with cinnamon. I thoroughly enjoyed the Man About Town - Maker's Mark, green chartreuse, Carpano antica, Averna, Smokey Scottish Rinse.With all of your friends and family visiting this holiday season, The Lounge at The Wayfarer is the perfect place to kick off the festivities.

5.0,11/15/2014,"Frankly, the review is strictly for the male host, Joel and our waiter, Jermaine. From the second we walked in, the Joel was super exuberant and set the tone of what we could expect. He greeted us with a warm smile and immediately sat us at our table. He made us feel very welcomed and wished us  great evening. We were already hooked by then.Then, follows our extraordinaire waiter, Jermaine. He was simply marvelous. He is sweet, funny but, never lost sight of his work and kept a very professional demeanor. He was very courteous and professional and made us feel as though we've known him forever. The food: SIMPLY DELICIOUS. We had a table of 4 but ate for 8. Everything that came from the seafood tower, the octopus entrée, the prawns, the champagnes served by a sommelier was on point. We were very happy by our experience but honestly, I believe the wait staffs are who to give kudos to. We will be returning as well as referring many people.",2,0,0,Leila A.,"NY, NY",129,30,19
3.0,11/14/2014,Nice decor but the food a bit pretentious and overly precious. But it was tasty enough but definitely not worth the price tag. Their seafood was actually done well and very fresh.

My mom ordered the lobster roll and the hand cut French fries and she thoroughly enjoyed her meal.The place has a cool, laid back lounge kind of vibe. We went on a Monday night; there was a great little jazz band taking requests. They played renditions of everything from Rihanna to old show tunes type songs like ""summertime"" and the ""girl from ipanema"".I had a great wine, the Sancerre. My mom also wants me to throw in that she had an amazing Bloody Mary. The place was a little pricey but given that the food and drinks were quality that can be overlooked. However, at points the service was a little slow. Our waitress took too long at points and forgot my drink at one point. However, overall it was an excellent experience and I suggest you go.

4.0,11/7/2014,"Had a 11pm dinning experience here last night, and the food was AMAZING!   Of course, all that good food came at a hefty price, but the service was excellent, the ambiance nice, and everything about the dinning experience justified the high prices.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna, which was cooked perfectly.  My friend had the Filet Mignon, which was easily a double portion... Gigantic, and yet she managed to finish it.   There was a bit of confusion in the drink order, cause mainly by the change of drink choice that one of our table mates made.  But, the staff quickly corrected and even gave us an extra glass of wine (which was not intended to be ordered, but the other table mate was happy to have a second glass as a result).

My friend had the ahi tuna, i had the NY strip, he started with the bisque and I started with a tomato salad. all fantastic. we added broccolini and fries as sides and they too were cooked beautifully. I thought it was a nice touch that i got a side of bone marrow with my strip. My friend ordered a specialty drink and enjoyed that too.

4.0,10/18/2014,I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant since I typically don't have high hopes for flashy places in this area of the city but my dinner companions talked me into it.  We got seated right away on a Saturday night with no reservations.Pros - salads are wonderful and plentiful portions which was a surprise as the rest of their portions were just right.  The salmon and duck entrees were both excellent and the creamed spinach side was lighter than most but still very tasty.  Are server was really great as well.Cons - the waitstaff was a little too eager to clear plates away which is just a small thing but can make a difference. It is expensive and it seems like I was paying more for the ambience and hip furniture than I was for the excellent food.  They also push an extremely expensive raw bar but being from Houston paying upwards of $3.50 for one small northern oyster is just plain silly.  I'd say skip the raw bar and enjoy their other seafood options.Overall a surprisingly good experience and meal in an area of the city that can be full of tourist traps.,1,1,1,Denee P.,"Syracuse, NY",9,23,2

1.0,10/6/2014,"I'm writing this review based on a recent brunch experience I had there. It's obvious that someone invested a lot of money in this place and if I were an owner, chef or investor, I would want to hear the good, the bad and the ugly. The location is great, the restaurant is beautiful and the menu is creative, not the usual. So we had high hopes.  Upon entering, on an extremely warm Sunday afternoon (9/28), they had the windows open and the restaurant was sweltering. I asked the Manager nicely if they had the air on, (as it was beyond uncomfortable and I believe as a result of it the restaurant on one of the busiest corners in NYC was empty) and in a very condescending tone, he told me that it was on but that the windows were open and that it was very warm outside. I felt like I was in the twilight zone and I wanted to tell him to close the windows and adjust the air.  I also called in the morning to change our reservation from 6 to 7 people and when we arrived, it hadn't been changed. Not a problem, but again the Manager who looked at us as if we made a mistake and as if he was doing us a favor, changed our table to accomodate the additional person (when I let them know hours before our arrival). My Mother JUST had surgery on her knee, it was her first outing since and her comfort level was my top priority, but the ARROGANT manager didn't seem to care about the customers whatsoever. We almost left to go across the way to Rue 57 where the AC was pumping and they are generally nice to customers.  The food was just ok. The waiter who was very amateurish recommended their ""signature"" omelette, which was not memorable and the pancakes had no taste and were kind of dry. There were some standouts on our table like a salad and the chicken apple sausage. The service really lacked as the dishes long after we were finished eating were not cleared away. The waiter forgot a couple of the sides we ordered and dessert was served without utensils and it repeatedly took forever for us to track someone down for various things such as drinks refills. One of our guests was leaving directly from the restaurant to catch a flight and at times it seemed like things were so slow & unattentive that she wasn't going to make it. Considering how the restaurant industy has gone in NYC, overall, things here weren't terrible, but the one thing that wouldn't allow me to go back was the Manager on duty for Sunday brunch and had our circumstances been different we wouldn't have stayed. With so many restaurant options in NYC, they should know how to treat their guests and be more professional overall.",3,0,0,Las S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0

Both were exquisitely delicious and I highly recommend, I live in SF so I'm no seafood novice.

First, I should start by saying I was staying at the Quin and my mother and I came here several times throughout our stay for drinks (almost every night for the 5 nights we were there).When we sat in the bar, the service was great! We ate french fries and I got the same drink every time and paid, $18 a piece.The big problem I have is that we decided to eat dinner here one night and the service was awful. Our waiter was, at best, attempting to be professional, but he came off cold, and he didn't have a personality which came off quite rude. Being that we were staying at the hotel, we noticed on our room service had a different menu than when we arrived at the restaurant. My mom being a picky eater, asked the waiter if she could have the sandwich she saw on our room service menu and his response was, ""That's our lunch menu, this is dinner"" and that was it. (slightly understandable, but most restaurants have better customer service than this) My mother literally ate french fries (nothing else) for dinner.I ordered the steak, the menu price read $39. I also ordered my usual drink. When the bill came, my steak was $44 and my drink was $16. I'm not really sure why there's a discrepancy and it wasn't large enough to make a scene about, but its very unprofessional.

They showed me and my family to our table, and they gave us a small circular table which was weird because there were dozens of open tables (and this was a Saturday night). I asked if we could get a bigger table because three people couldn't have a full dinner on one small circle table. They suggested putting two circle tables together which was kind of stupid on their part because two circles don't simply go together like that. Then they moved us to a bigger table. They brought us the bread and when I took a bite into it, there was a hair in it. I told the waitress that and she just said, ""oh it's probably just an herb."" It was obviously a hair and it wasn't from anyone in my family because it was black hair and my hair is light brown and my family has blond hair. I ordered a medium well NY strip stake with no sauce. 20 minutes later, they came back with a medium well steak doused in sauce. I told them that I didn't want the sauce and they said that they'd take care of it. They came back with a burnt steak with no sauce. It tasted like they set it on fire for 5 minutes, blew it out, and brought it over. I reported that to the manager and she took the steak away and I asked for another steak. They brought it over and it was burnt again!!! I forced it down my throat and I just said that it was fine to get the staff out of my face.

Very yummy and perfect garnishes.  I was very impressed with the soups, the lobster bisque and clam chowder are a must.  What a fabulous presentation of bringing two elements together.  Pure flavor.  Had some cocktails, quite yummy. The service was awesome, we sat and chatted with the staff. I loved how they compliment the food, that's what makes a restaurant I feel, if your waiter can appreciate and share what they are serving.   Overall we had a great time here, food and service was a plus.",1,0,0,Lucy S.,"Sacramento, CA",155,39,20
4.0,3/6/2014,"The food is absolutely delicious. Yes portions are small and rather pricey, but isn't that the case with all hotel attached restaurants.  Service could have been improved. We were one of a half dozen tables, yet our lunch time meal took nearly 2 hours. Branzino was definitely a must have. Desserts are tasty, but textures were much to be desired.",0,0,1,Macy T.,"Tarrytown, NY",37,177,145
5.0,2/28/2014,"Guess I'll be the first to review this new gem in midtown manhattan!Pros:Waitstaff SUPER friendly and attentive. I usually judge my servers based on how often my water is empty because I tend to drink a lot of water and my glass was never empty here.Food was Amazing. Everything tasted fantastic. I forget the names of all our dishes but we had the ecuadorian shrimp, chicken breast, scallops and salmon. Everything was just amazing there's really no other way to put it. Everything was cooked perfectly, full of flavor and just overall great food experience.The bread is just an experience in itself. They bring out freshly baked bread that is one again amazing. They started by bringing only 4 pieces out, which we quickly finished and then to our delight they said we could have as much as we wanted which we quickly took advantage of!Cons:It is a bit pricey, but it is one of the few pricey places I've been to where the food was totally worth it so as much as I wish the prices were lower they are pretty justified. Portion sizes are a bit small and leaves you wanting more and more mainly because the food is just so good.",0,0,0,Aneet K.,"Manhattan, NY",5,10,1
