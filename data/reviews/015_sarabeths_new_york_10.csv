4.0,5/2/2019,"I lived out my Gossip Girl and SATC dreams with breakfast here. My husband and I walked in without a reservation this morning and we were sat within a few minutes. The crab cake eggs Benedict ($30) was perfectly cooked. Bacon was plentiful (as it should be for $12) and the coffee was delicious. All in all, we were in and out pretty quickly but the servers refilled our waters and coffee often. Tables are very crowded and close together and service isn't super personable but everyone is efficient. I expect a ton of tourists come here so they probably don't expect a lot of repeat customers which may lend to that.",0,0,0,Linda A.,"Las Vegas, NV",64,30,127
4.0,4/28/2019,"Pros: Really great food, like wow. Fancy looking place too. Cons: Service was soooooooo slow here. We got here at 5:45 and they took a long time to take our order.food didnt come out till 7:15, also portions are small so you might not get full First thing I noticed was the assorted bread basket, theres rolls, sticks and slices of different sorts of bread, which was really nice. The roll was soft and fluffy and the slices were nice and crispy on the edges. The first course of seared scallops were PHENOMENAL!!! It was my first time trying sweet corn flan, the tarragon sauce and trout caviar was perfect !!!! I would love to have more of this any day.The half lobster was , classic. I love lobster so you almost can't go wrong here with this one. The creme brulee was also delicious!!! Like probably the best I have ever had and topped with raspberries. If you willing to splurge a bit, this is a great place to go.",0,0,0,Taylor K.,"Portland, OR",500,178,1110
3.0,4/27/2019,"Non-offensive brunch food with a pretty steep price tag.The fat and fluffy french toast had a great crunchy crust to it. The lemon and ricotta pancakes had a cloud-like texture, but not too much that it retained a cakey bite. Would definitely pass on the side of sausage that came on top of a bed of syrupy applesauce and the incredibly sub-par $11 side of homefries. With just the above, the bill came to $100 for 2 people. At the end of the day, the food is not outstanding to justify for that price. And while it is convenient to Central Park, it is certainly not a foodie brunch destination to travel for and would try to recommend another brunch spot to out-of-town visitors.",0,0,0,R.

1.0,4/22/2019,I was not super impressed.  Service was lacking.  We asked for French toast without powdered sugar. It was served with powdered sugar.  No big deal but server walked away and did not come back to check on us so we could put another order in.  We just dusted the powdered sugar off as we were starving. Clam chowder was runny and horribly flavored. When you think of clam chowder....  that is definitely not it...  I won't be revisiting.,0,0,0,Andrea T.,"Las Vegas, NV",139,2,0
5.0,4/19/2019,One of my favorite places on S Central Park.  Very convenient and delicious food.  We went for brunch and had a flat iron steak and a mushroom and cheese omelet- split was the way to go!  Truffle fries were also awesome.  We kept the pitchers of sangria and Bloody Mary flowing.  Got up and really didn't know what hit us. Highly recommended for larger groups.  Kids were easily accommodated and were welcome.  Strollers were even easily folded up and stored for us.  Would definitely recommend.,0,0,0,Jennifer G.,"Haworth, NJ",179,58,8

It's right around the corner from the main entrance to the Plaza.The location is prime and the setting is upscale. Service was very good and the food was OK. Nothing to get excited about, but nice.We went for brunch and had the following: Goldie Lox eggs, Garden omelette, Eggs Benedict and steel cut oats with apples. I asked for no raisins, but the apples came with raisins. Our beverages included orange juice and coffee.We were happy with our meal, but I must admit that it was a little pricey.  Nice, but not rushing back the next time I am in NYC.

2.0,3/8/2019,I'm very confused why this place only has two $$ signs because it should really have three. The average entree plates were $30 at least and the portions were very very small.

I tried the tomato soup and cheese and salmon eggs Benedict; bother weren't worth the price tag in my opinion. The good: However, my almond french toast with raspberry sauce was exceptional. It's the best tasting breakfast I had. I'd come back to spoil myself just for that. Coffee was below average and the cappuccino was $6 but ok.

2.0,2/25/2019,"Pros:Beautiful location, nice walk getting to and from the restaurant, servers actually knew what they were doing (stay tuned), friendly and warm interaction with the hostess.Cons:FOOD. Boyfriend got classic eggs Benedict and they were fine. When I saw there was lemon ricotta pancakes on the menu, my heart fluttered. One of my favourite breakfast dishes from every place I have ever tried, but I was beyond disappointed. They were dry, cakey, no sign of lemon or ricotta. The only thing I could taste was nutmeg??? Ew. Halfway through I explained to the server that I really dislike nutmeg and there was a very overwhelming nutmeg taste in the pancakes, wondering if I could just have some jam to put on them. The server definitely gave good service, but did not have a friendly demeanour or good attitude. After asking for the jam, there was no apology or concern, just an eye roll and a small cup of jam on the table 10ish minutes later. Prices are a bordering on ridiculous for what you get here. I am fine paying $25 (USD!!!!!!) for a few pancakes if they are so good that I remember them for months to come and if the restaurant had a nicer atmosphere. Don't feel great paying that much for food served in an crowded and not nicely decorated place. It is clean and nice open area and natural light, but not cute or special to be in. I mean, there is freaking paper on top of the table cloths. It is so pretentious and the servers were so cold that I did not feel comfortable expressing my concern with the food, that is not fair.

If you're a local, like myself, you'll probably visit occasionally because there are 100% more unique, and cheaper brunch spots in the city. But with that being said, a meal at Sarabeth's will never disappoint! There food is incredibly delicious and fresh. I've had their omelettes which comes w/ a scone and their iconic apricot jam. It is really a wholesome and filling meal that will you keep you full for hours. This location felt a little a more cramped and smaller than their UES location -- probably because it's more touristy area of the city but it was fun to different type of people dining.  I would recommend this spot to those visiting nyc more so than locals.",3,1,4,Sanjna S.,"Paramus, NJ",94,223,981

4.0,2/2/2019,"Upon entry the establishment felt small and crowded (Mid Jan), but once you start walking through open doors  you realize just how big Sarabeth's is! Food: Crab cake Benedict was an absolute delight and the crab cakes were thick and tasty.  Eggs done to perfection.  The greens that came with had a very pleasant (but subtle) dressing on them. The side breakfast sausage came out with a very hot plate, but very cold sausage - didn't end up eating more than 1 bite and sent back.  The coffee seemed quite tasteless (daily coffee drinker, black coffee only). Atmosphere:  Sat in the back room. Lively (brunch) with a diverse group of patrols spread throughout. There seem to be multiple rooms, not sure but this place is much bigger than expected. They seem to have 1 staff member to every 3 guests - but the service doesn't necessarily feel as such (not that is was bad).",2,0,0,Keegan S.,"University, Denver, CO",2,27,26
4.0,1/30/2019,"If this place was not waaay overpriced it would probably be worthy of 5 stars. However I did pay $23 for French toast (no sides) which is probably nothing to most of the customers that dine here. The host at the front was not the most friendly and told us our wait would be lengthy (I believe he said 45 minutes) however we were sat in less than 5. Our server on the other hand was more than friendly, and extremely informative of the menu.I ordered French toast which had just the right amount of sweetness and a side of potatoes. My friend ordered the eggs Benedict which was also tasty. I ordered a mimosa (or 2) that definitely did its job.

3.0,1/29/2019,"Sarabeth's is a New York brunch powerhouse. With multiple locations around the city and a connection to Gossip Girl, everyone seems to have been here or at least heard of it. I was excited to give Sarabeth's after some rave reviews from friends, but my experience was left quite wanting. Ambiance and Service: The interior resembles a high-end hotel restaurant. The place is clean cut and large but isn't particularly cute or special. Our service was on point from arrival until after our meal. Everyone from the hostesses to our server to the bus boys was kind and attentive. Food: What we came for! The first thing you will notice when opening up the menu is the prices, ouch. Putting aside money, I decided to study the menu and see what I could enjoy. I even asked the waiter for favorites and recommendations. Nothing stood out. I ended up getting the eggs benedict. A classic and safe but delicious choice. I was underwhelmed. At that price point, I would hope my eggs at least come with potatoes on the side! The meal was rather small and didn't leave me stuffed. My sister ordered the avocado toast. I have to say, that was yummy. One piece of toast came with a fried egg on top and the other came with a blob of cheese. But really, how could anywhere mess that up. I won't be recommending this place to friends!

1.0,1/13/2019,Absolute Garbage.. what a waste of money and the service was horrendous. Ordered a goat cheese omelette and what I got was an uninspired egg spread with cream cheese for 20 dollars without even a hash brown included. First of all this makes me wonder whether they scammed me with cream cheese or someone made the decision to use cream cheese like goat cheese in favor of a harder chevre. Either way it certainly didnt taste like goat cheese.  Next the prices are  a bit of the scam because each dish here is pretty much incomplete breakfast and have to order each piece of your meal separately.  Finally the waitstaff was completely inept and spilled coffee all over the table without the sense of any apology.Total tourist trap.. terrible,0,0,0,Julius C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0

5.0,12/15/2018,"My daughter and I really enjoyed the Classic Eggs Benedict.  The quality of the ingredients really comes through in this dish.  The eggs had yellow-orange colored yolks, darker than most commercially sold eggs, that were full of flavor.  The English muffins were more ""muffiny"" than others I have encountered (a good thing), but retained a true English muffin flavor.  The side salad was light and refreshing with a citrus vinaigrette and just the right amount of bitterness in the greens.  I can see why this place has a line out the door at breakfast.",0,0,1,Brad S.,"Bloomington, IN",6,20,100

4.0,11/30/2018,"I visited Sarabeth's on a whim, and it the food was delicious! A friend of mine wanted to grab brunch before exploring the city, and I'll say it was a good choice. Located on the south end of Central Park, we sat out side despite it being a little chilly, low 50s, because the indoor seating was going to take an hour. Patio seating only took us about 15minutes, but keep in mind there were no outdoor heaters, so after some time of chatting it did get cold. Food was way better than I thought it would be, it was flavorful and I'd definitely stop by in the future. I ordered the Steak and Eggs, the steak was surprisingly REALLY tender and FULL of FLAVOR! I'm not even kidding! It also came with Pumpkin muffin, which was also surprisingly delicious! I normally do not like pumpkin flavored food, but this is a definite exception. My meal was worth the money, but my friend ordered the waffle, which I thought was basic and overpriced for what it was. Service wasn't too bad. Not the strongest, at least for the patio section. It took some time for my coffee to be refilled, but nonetheless it was done.

4.0,11/26/2018,This place came recommended as a good place to eat after our Central Park excursions. We recommend making reservations on Open Table for the time you want to eat. We had reservations for 11:30 and had options from the breakfast and lunch menu. Everything came out looking and smelling amazing! My friends and I shared a muffin basket with local preservatives ($16) and it did not disappoint. The table favorite was the banana bread muffin and scone but all five muffins satisfied the carb lover in us. I had the Salmon Eggs Benedict ($26)  which was was the perfect blend of runny egg with hollandaise sauce and slight crunch from the toasted English muffin underneath. I loved the dish and would eat it again. I did admire the look and smell of the cream of tomato soup that passed and really would want to try that in the future.

A recurring nightmare I often face in restaurants is having soupy, undercooked eggs or dried out nuked eggs. Also, I could taste that the eggs were cooked in real butter, not oil or margarine, butter!! Hallelujah! The eggs came over kale and market veggies, which were Brussel sprouts and some butternut squash, but the pieces of squash were far and few between - delicious nevertheless!

The eggs benedict with salmon was quite delicious.  The portions are more than friendly and the food tasted as high quality as the appearance of Sarabeth's itself.

3.0,11/15/2018,"If you're in east midtown and don't know where to go for breakfast or brunch head over to Sarabeth's! Whether you're a tourist or local, the food and drink options will hit the spot while definitely burning a hole in your wallet (latter does not apply to real Upper East Siders who use Balenciaga bags as everyday gym tote bags). This venue is first come first serve, so if you don't have the patience to wait for a table you can eat and drink at the bar. But be quick as the bar only has 5 seats! The entrance is quite small, so a few people are piled up in groups waiting for their names to be called. Meanwhile, the folks who arrived early are comfortably seated in tables that offer a lovely view of Central Park and all the carriage drawn horses. Larger tables are in the back and are chic, plush white booths that offer views looking more at the interior of the venue which doesn't offer too much of a personality (except for a touch of farm-to-table visuals where their marvelous raspberry strawberry jam is displayed).   Regardless of where you sit, you know you came here for one reason: to eat! The menu has classic staples with a high-end twist: juices called Four Flowers Juice (orange/pineapple/pomegranate/banana) for $11.50, steelcut oats/granola (available only until noon!) for $12-14, and sweet breakfast options like buttermilk, lemon & ricotta pancakes, French toast and pumpkin waffles all for the low price of $23.00.  While everything is essentially overly priced I have to say the food really hits the spot and is well made! A friend and I shared two items: the garden omelet (eggs with peas, zucchini, mushroom and cheddar cheese) and the sirloin burger with gruyere cheese (that cheese cost an extra ~$1.75) and fries. The omelet came with toast and happily enough, a side of their homemade jam that's actually for sale! It was the perfect portion for one, hungry person but also perfect to share and still feel full. The burger was cooked medium-well and even though I'm on team medium-rare it tasted great, especially with the cheese, fresh lettuce, onions and tomato. Washed these all down with the Four Flowers Juice which had I made at home, would've paired nicely with prosecco. One call out is that we actually sat at the bar and had gotten lucky since the wait was 20 minutes but seats had opened up. It was definitely cozy and my friend was stuck with a seat that wasn't too ideal as it was next to the line for the bathroom and the swinging bar door for waiters to pass through. Though we were deep into conversation and food, so it genuinely didn't matter. In the end, the venue gets a solid three stars for great food, drinks and service though it loses a star because pancakes should not lose $23 (and everything else is very overpriced).",1,0,0,Anna F.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",262,241,2188

2.0,8/29/2018,This restaurant is super convenient because it's close to the park. However you are paying to be close to the park. It is exceedingly expensive for what you get. The menu isn't that great. The Orange juice is $10.50 and the side of bacon is $11.00 and super greasy. They don't do any substitutions on the weekend so you become more limited. Not worth it.

I ordered the eggs Benedict delightful but the muffin was a bit hard even to cut. Tables are a bit close together, my fiancé nearly took out the table trying to get around to go to the bathroom. The cappuccino was a bit bland. Wonderful waiter, beautiful atmosphere. Quick on refills and did not interrupt our conversation just to check if we needed anything.

I really wanted to enjoy this place because I heard really great things, especially about brunch, but unfortunately I will not be returning back.

My mom and I decided to give it a try. SERVICE: The boy out front was rude and the men inside seemed to have a ""holier than thou"" attitude. Our waitress wasn't very welcoming or too much of a people person but she got us in and out in 30 minutes for us to catch our flight. (They have a place by the hostess stand to check your luggage, it's free). I would say the friendliness of the place gets a 2.5 only due to our waitress adding some positive vibes. FOOD: I heard amazing reviews about their hot chocolate..... let's just say, save your money, go to the store and buy the Swiss packets. It's much better. I got the French Toast with strawberry's and Mom got the Pancakes. They were very very good. Our bill at the end was $69.35.... I'd say yes overpriced but honestly that's about the price of every meal we had on this trip.  The portions are large you could easily split them!

While the atmosphere itself is nice and the food decent neither is good enough to out way the over all attitude of the place not to mention the expense. The staff is a luff and in attentive seems like they/'d rather be doing anything but wait on you. They hardly make eye contact and even though they are standing around watching you still have to latterly flag them down to get just about anything including coffee refills. The only thing they seem to be interested in refilling is the water. Strange. They are just incredibly unfriendly and disinterested. Additionally out right saying on your menu that you will make no substations even for something as simple as egg whites is rude, inconsiderate, arrogant, and lazy. What happens if someone has allergies, or dietary issues? Oh also, the restaurant is completely not wheel chair excess able which I'm pretty sure is against the law. I think the only reason people come here is because it's so close to hotels. As for the food it's just basic diner food, nothing all that special, certainly nothing good enough to make up for rude service and obnoxious policies. The prices are over blown too.

We were seated inside, it is a beautiful restaurant and the staff members are kind and friendly. I ordered the morning fruit bowl ($13), bro got the eggs Benedict ($24) and sis got a granola bowl ($13). The food came out fast enough since the restaurant was quite busy. My fruit bowl came with peeled and sliced banana, strawberry, grapefruit and orange. The fruit was fresh but the portion was small. Bro's eggs Benedict was tasty but definitely overpriced and not worth $24, maybe $17 maximum. Sis was disappointed in her meal since it was just milk and granola, nothing special and pretty pricy. A bowl of fruit, eggs Benedict and granola costed us $60 after tip, which was way more expensive than what we imagined.

No smile or welcome, all very serious and inhospitable. The gentleman that led us to a table at least lightened the mood somewhat by acknowledging my sons Spider-Man shirt and saying he loved Spider-Man too. The waiter arrived and promptly took our drink order after which two other staff offered water. Another waiter walked by with plates in his hands after clearing a table and dropped some ramekins: one with ketchup, one with jam and one with syrup. The lady across from us was affected and some even got in her hair. No apology from the waiter. Staff came by to clean and possibly a manager apologized. Food arrived quickly and was tasty. Goat cheese and spinach omelette for me and salmon Benedict or him. The food was the saving grace of this place. The staff besides the bussers had an air of 'I can't be bothered to provide pleasant service today'. I understand what it's like working weekend brunch in nyc: I did it for 4 years, but the staff I did it with had a lot more camaraderie than this place. Hosts and maitre'd need help. Management needs to work on cycle of service and be a little more pleasant. We spent $130 on brunch today no alcohol, if I had known the service would be so stuck up we would have gone elsewhere where they understand the importance of friendly service.

Had to ask for them to be brought again. Throughout the meal the coffee was not even refilled or attended to. The food was just ok. Simple omelettes that anyone could make. Nothing special. Our server seemed to have little interest in us. Even to the point where it almost looked like he didn't want to be there based on his expression and mannerisms. He shuffled and dragged his feet as he walked around. Really odd. I wouldn't come back, especially for the crazy upscale pricing.

That is SO pricey for bacon, but they are giving you 8-9 thick and long slices that will fill you up! The eggs were pillow-like and yummy! I also had mimosas which were fantastic as well with a hint of grapefruit (2). My total was about 80-90 dollars. My friend got a chicken caesar salad and fries, which also looked very yummy!

I started to pick them out and then I gave up on the salad, I should have ordered fries. I finished the eggs benedict because I don't like to waste food.

Coffee was pretty good/ standard. Not too excessively strong. Just right. Whatever coffee they use is pretty great.The Bellini was tasty. You don't taste the booze but it's highly refreshing. The three pepper home fries was very very nice. We asked for hot sauce and our server got two. The Valentina one (apparently from Australia) was AMAZING. Ordering it when I get home. Pork sausage comes on an apricot spread :) very nice flavors. Crab cake Benedict was done right. Did not expect anything less though. However I wouldn't mind if te crab cake was a tad thicker ;) It comes with a very refreshing salad. We went pretty late so croissants and scones were all gone. Try their blueberry corn muffin- you won't regret. The sourdough tasted a bit like sourdough but did not look like one lol. Wonder how they did that;)Farmers omlet was the star of our meal. Beautiful flavors, complimenting ingredients all come together perfectly. A slight let down was our vegetable frittata. Very bland, never tasted the gruyere, and it was also low on salt. :( :( :( *there were stains on the coffee mugs and saucers. Letdown for a place like this.

We wanted something nice but not fussy, and we wanted something close to Central Park because my wife wanted to do a carriage ride. It turns out this is right across the street, so it checked all of the boxes.Service was fantastic. Our server was attentive and paced the meal well so we didn't feel rushed.

Had hanger steak special, was fine.  Wife had salmon. Also good.  There were only three other parties in the restaurant at 8pm Saturday night. We asked for a table, not a booth,  hostess indicated none were available while multiple sat vacant during our dinner. Had to ask for silverware multiple times. Staff was busy setting and resetting tables while the few actual customers were waiting for their attention.

For appetizer: I chose the smoked eggplant puree similar to hummus, and my friend chose the escarole salad. The puree was not good, but that's my own fault for not reading ""SMOKED"" right in the description. Otherwise, it was a generous portion. For Entrees: We each chose an option. I had the cod which was DELICIOUS! It was crispy, great seasoning, but a small portion. The sides that came with it were ehhh, but it was already chosen and weren't allowed to substitute. The chicken option was good, and came with tasty rice. The 3rd option was prime rib which looked great! I just wish we could have subbed out the sides for something different, would have made the entrees much better.For Dessert: We all chose the smores in a jar. Very good!The reason for 2 stars is price (even though we chose the restaurant week option, the guacamole was $20 and NOT worth it!), the inability to substitute sides, and the service. Our waiter had a bit of an attitude as soon as we sat down and wasn't very attentive or helpful in menu options.

3.0,11/4/2017,"Stopped in for brunch today and had a fairly mediocre experience.  While we knew it wouldn't be cheap, I think $22 for just a plate of pancakes or French toast with no sides or anything is kind of ridiculous.  Who wants to eat only something sweet for their meal?  It'd be great if they could add some eggs or something with that.  I ordered the eggs Benedict, which is listed under the section on the menu that says ""includes a choice of muffin (English, corn, bran, etc), scone, or toast"".  However when I ordered my eggs Benedict with a scone, I was told that since it's made with an English muffin, that's the one that it includes and you don't actually get a choice.  I find this kind of ridiculous, that because a dish listed under this section is made with an English muffin as a primary ingredient that it isn't included in the ""includes choice of"" statement on the menu.  They either need to add a little star or something next to it or take it out of that section on the menu.  I was happy I could order a scone a la carte, but it was super cold and dry.  The French toast was pretty yummy and the eggs benedict were awesome, I just felt like I was being nickel and dimed here and not getting a decent enough variety of dishes out of it.  Other than this, the restaurant was clean, service was a bit cold, but the location is great for a nice stroll in the park afterwards.  Had a decent experience but probably won't be returning any time soon.",0,0,0,Sarah D.,"New York, NY",4,182,13

I made a reservation online ahead of time and I'm glad I did because the place was busy. We got seated right away but our table wasn't in the best location in the restaurant. We were seated right in the main path for people to walk up and down the restaurant. It was pretty loud and our stuff was bumped a few times by people walking by. Our server came over almost immediately to take our drinks ordered but spoke so quietly we could hardly hear him over the noise of the restaurant. After seeing that most of the drinks were at least $10, we decided to stick with water. The menu had a lot of great choices but everything was pricy. We waited about 5 minutes to place our food order and I chose the Short Rib Hash and my husband got the Green and White egg dish. I like that we each got to choose a bread item to accompany our entrees and I got the pumpkin muffin. We waited about 10 minutes for our food and when everything came out, it was hot and tasted great. It wasn't the best brunch I've ever had but the food was high quality and tasty. We didn't see our waiter again after ordering our food until he came by to give us the check. I'm glad there was other wait staff around to refill our waters. The restaurant itself is nicely kept and pretty for a brunch spot on Central Park but I personally didn't think the food was worth $20+ per person. We spend $60 on brunch for 2 entrees and tip- no drinks, apps, or sides. We also didn't have any views of the park from where we were sitting.

Definitely one of those days you would hope you made a reservation. But I did notice some parties were seated pretty quickly! I definitely noticed it's a touristy spot, especially because I went in the summertime. The ambiance was very classy and lively! Everyone seemed to be having a great time. The servers were very polite. I would give service a 10/10. They were attentive and actually quite fancy! I ordered a four flower mimosa and the Goldie lox with a pumpkin muffin. The mimosa honestly just tasted like a regular mimosa, but it costed me $14. Probably the alcohol they used was high quality, but I was disappointed that their four flowers juice didn't have a unique taste. The omelette was so good, but got extremely heavy after a while. The smoked salmon was delicious and the eggs were so fluffy. The cream cheese is what put it over the top for me. It was too much in there and unequally distributed. I got random large chunks of the cream cheese, then sometimes none. The muffin was sooo good and it came with their famous preserves. I wish I could have taken some home with me but I was stuffed after my meal. Although I loved the ambiance and service, the food didn't seem worth it's price to me.

Our server (she never told us her name) was very nice when she was around but service was not great. We ordered the two kids food first as they were starving and ordered the grown ups atleast 10/15 min after. Of course, the adults food shows up first, and kid pancakes and eggs are no where in sight. Bill is hefty, which everywhere is in NYC, but if the service is great I don't necessarily complain of the cost, I understand real estate etc etc. I had tomato soup and grilled cheese it was very good. My husband had the same. Kids had pancakes, French toast and eggs. Good is good, but service and the rude staff (besides server) lost us. We wouldn't return.

The dish has great flavor though; the remoulade sauce made the meal. The pancakes had a,nice light lemony flavor, but my friends and I all agreed that they were a bit dry. The drinks (mimosa and bloody marys) were expensive for a tourist, so we avoided those. Service was good and the atmosphere was bubbly. The dishes were all a bit overpriced though.

We were seated in the back, and if you have Sprint, that area of Sarabeth's doesn't fare well for reception. The crowd was a bit mixed, with businessmen and tourists grabbing some breakfast. I did feel like the ambiance there took itself a bit more seriously than how a lot of the tourists were dressed, if that makes sense.The Crab Cake Benedict was my choice, and it was really rich and had a really good salad included.

4.0,4/5/2017,Surprisingly.  This is my first time at sarabeths. Across from Central Park. Located at 40 Central Park south. I am familiar with sarabeths but have never thought of eating here. Passed this location a few times in the past. I was looking for a place close by. I said a few places out loud close to the park. She said sarabeths. Omg haven't been there in awhile. Let's go. So we didSo we came for the brunch. I called to make reservations. Apparently they don't take resers. So I asked how many seats they had left and the hostess said I would be fine if I came in the next 30 mins. We arrived. We were sat promptly. The staff was accommodating. Gave us a area that was nice. On the outside sarabeths looks like you would have to be more business attire. But when we were seated there was everyone from suit and ties. To a family of 4 with there kids. One of which was a baby. FOODOur waiter was very nice. He knew the menu off the top of his head. This was for brunch. Most of the ingredients was from local farms or from farms upstate. I liked that. Organic was listed whenever possible. We asked for a recommendation. My cousin dident know if she wanted pancakes or French toast. He was like def French toast. She was going to order some sides and the waiter saved us from ordering too much food. I ordered the eggs Benedict. For $22 it was good. I asked for regular bacon instead of Canadian. He said no problem. I could tell the holiness sauce was made from scratch. The eggs were cooked perfectly. The bacon was good. Was from Sullivan county upstate. As all of you know I'm a tea snob. I ordered English breakfast tea. It was harney and sons English breakfast. That's what I drink everyday at home. So it was a nice touch. Good cuppa. The only complaint. If we had one. Waiters kept walking by. I don't know if our table was in a lane where the staff carys dishes out. But it was constant. The kid was crying but you can't do anything about that it's life. Overall. My first time at Sara Beth's was good. It's close to everything located at 40 Central Park south. I would come here again for breakfast or brunch maybe try another location tho. Might not be as touristy or loud.

4.0,2/16/2017,"Across from Central Park so this locale feels super chic and elite. Not to mention the pretty people at lunch time sitting outside on the sidewalk dining area. I ventured here on a Wednesday night after work to sample their Winter restaurant week menu. The choices like many NYC RW menus had a salad, a protein entree, and two limited choice desserts to choose from. However, their choice offerings were just the tickle I was looking for to get me in the door. Knowing full well this place is usually pricey, RW is a good time to try it.I ordered the scallop carpacio as my appetizer (RW menu). The citrus and vinegary top notes opened my appetite for dinner so I must say it was a great starter option. The scallops were large in size, no chinzy small portions here. And I had eight pieces to boot, great for sharing. It was beautifully plated with radiccio slices and baby green sprouts. The sprouts have a bitter sweet taste that paired well with the citrus and orange zest. The scallops themselves rested on top of larger slices of radishes, almost palm sized medallions. They looked like delicate flowers with it's pretty purple coloring.My party ordered the crab meat guacamole & chips to share as their appetizer.  I stole a bite here and there, the large chunks of crab meat and hint of lime juice was refreshing. I hesitated trying this because of the cilantro and jalapeno (as I don't like cilantro and was worried about the heat in the jalapeno) but it enhanced the flavors of the dish and made it all work.My entree was a 10 oz. Ribeye steak (from the RW menu) - ordered it medium rare.  Was a little more medium and less rare than I wanted but it was fine.  You could taste the grain of the beef and it had it's natural juices coming out when I cut into it.  It was very good.  No complaints.  It was accompanied by a side of roasted veggies but I was aiming for the meat - wrapped my veggie to go.  LOLSince I ordered off the RW menu, my third course was dessert - of which I ordered the ""S'mores"".  It was awesome...even had that burnt/campfire toasted smell to it.  They browned the marshmallows on the top to give it that campfire look.  The layers of melted, gooey marshmallows, chocolate pudding, and graham cracker pieces...oh so yummy.  If I wasn't stuffed already, I probably would've dogged the whole thing.  It was served in a glass container - each ingredient, layer upon layer.  It's a must try if you see it on the menu.",2,1,1,Jeannie T.,"Queens, NY",372,532,7625

Also the wait staff was very fast and they were very attentive. So another plus. The one negative was the two people who got burgers at our table. One was ordered medium rare while the other was ordered well done. When the order hit the table the burgers were switched. And it was only realized once they had both taken bites of it.(Although I have to say this- the person who originally ordered the well done said she will only ever order medium now so that's a plus!)

4.0,1/22/2017,"Sarabeth's usually takes reservations but not on weekends, so I was surprised that the wait at 11 am on a Sunday was only 25-30 minutes. We ordered a short rib hash with English muffin, almond-crusted French toast with strawberry-raspberry sauce, lemon ricotta pancakes, and buttermilk pancakes. The short rib hash was solid but I'm not sure what we got could be considered an English muffin. It was more like a round piece of bread rolled in a few specks of cornmeal. Either way, not my favorite. The spicy green tomatillo sauce was delicious, though. The almond-crusted French toast would've benefitted from crushing the almonds instead of slicing them. The portion size was wonderfully large, but other than that the sauce was minimal. The best part of our meal was undoubtedly the pancakes. Nice and fluffy with just enough sweetness without being overly sweet. Plus a stack of five pancakes is a nice serving. My main qualm with Sarabeth's is that everything is overpriced. The pancakes and French toast were each $20, and the juices (which we decided not to order) were $9.50!

3.0,1/7/2017,"Sarabeth's offers one of the most typical New York City brunch experiences. Prime location and a somewhat famous name means they are often quite busy. We came here with some of our guests and while we left satisfied, no one was overly impressed.We were a group of nine for brunch on a Sunday morning. We got there and put our names down and were told to wait for forty minutes, which was fair but ended up taking a bit longer than that. One of the hostesses had some serious attitude though. We went to check on the state of our table and she acted like our name was nowhere on the list, and then gave us a vague estimate of remaining time with a bogus reason. Thankfully that was the last we had to see of herOnce ready, we were led inside. The place is huge, and we could not have guessed how big it was looking at it from the outside. The decor is bright and traditional, but seemed a bit dated and old. Our server was super friendly and nice, and made sure we were well taken care of.For food, we got the salmon benedict which was quite tasty and the salmon was good, but the hollandaise was a bit bland the egg was overdone. Lemon ricotta pancakes were not very tasty and slightly dry. The regular pancakes were a lot better. We also got a couple of veggie omlettes and the waffle. All were okay as such, nothing was particularly memorable. The coffee here is good though.Overall a strictly okay experience.

I dont know how they make it so perfectly crisp but not so crispy that you can't eat it! As for the rest of my meal - I ordered the lemon and ricotta pancakes and a bloody mary. My husband ordered a jalapeno cheddar omelette. Of which I thought were all quite delicious. In general I'm just not a brunch person but I'd say I left quite satisfied.

Our server was competent but did not speak English that well, it was difficult to understand him. Inappropriate service for the environment. We arrived at 12+ noon and was not given a bread basket until we asked. Apparently it's their policy to not offer until asked. Cheap much?* The Tomato Soup came within 2 minutes of ordering. It tasted like it came from a can, and the cheese topping with was regular packaged mozzarella. High sodium canned soup taste.* The Salmon was overcooked and dry, it came skin side DOWN. It was accompanied with potato purée, roasted cauliflower, almond flakes and raisins (wtf?). I have a long day ahead and in great need of the protein, but this was such an ordeal to finish.

Took a while to get our drinks & in the 40 minutes we sat waiting for food, we were never offered bread (i had to ask a random person for it who told our waitress & then 10 minutes later I had to ask the waitress again), our drinks (water included) were refilled once during the hour &  a half we sat at the table.

If she wasn't running around she could be found at the computer station. Entrees were dropped by a food runner & our server came over once during the meal to ask how things were - fine. I ended up doing the restaurant week menu but my boyfriend ordered from the regular menu. 15 minutes after we finished eating our plates were cleared by someone other than our server & then she came over to ask if I was ready for dessert. (just me, no acknowledgement to my boyfriend) We were never offered coffee & my boyfriend wasn't even offered a dessert menu. When the dessert came I then had to wait to separately find the server again & ask for a spoon.

Very delicate for a dish that can be quite heavy. The English muffins were amazing, about 2"" high with a bit of corn meal on the crust. My husband had the Farmer's omelette. It was a light fluffy omelette, no dryness or rubbery texture. The veggies were perfectly balanced and fresh. We ate here two mornings in a row.

The four flower juice tastes pretty good and it wasn't diluted with ice. However,  it is pretty  expensive for just a cup of juice. I came here craving for egg benedict but thought the salmon egg benedict tasted mediocre. The eggs were overcooked so the yolks didn't flow out nicely. The almond crust French toast on the other hand tasted amazing. It had almond slices all over the French toast but it wasn't overwhelming.

Needed to add salt and pepper, but they were soft scrambled just how I like them. I got a croissant on the side, which was actually surprisingly from somewhere that doesn't claim to be a bakery. The jam was delicious too. I had to get a bowl of berries to join my breakfast to round everything off-but at 14.50 for a small bowl, I just felt ripped off.  This is a nice place to bring visitors, if you're willing to pay for it.

Fortunately, the taste made up for the poor presentation. The salmon was absolutely exquisite and so smooth across the tongue, and the eggs had the perfect texture and temperature. Although the cream cheese wasn't distributed evenly, I enjoyed every bite of the omelette. On the other hand, the muffin was average: it tasted fine but it was nothing special.

3.0,6/13/2016,"Of course I had to try Sarabeth's and I can't believe I hadn't tried it already being that I come to NY often.  My husband and I went for brunch this past Sunday at 1:30pm and we only had to wait 10 minutes before being seated, which wasn't bad at all being that this location doesn't take reservations.Unfortunately, we were seated in what must have been the worst possible table in the entire restaurant.  We were in the walkway, right next to the kitchen doorway, and there was a glass that separated us from the next table that was basically sitting right next to us, so we didn't have any type of privacy at our own table.  The table next to us were in our faces the entire time, which was annoying.Everything here is expensive and I am one to spend whatever on food because I love food so much.  But, my super small cappuccino was almost $6 and it was so very small.  One teacup sized black coffee is $4.50 with no free refills!  It's insane with how high they charge for coffee and cappuccinos that are mediocre.We decided to start off with a kid's portion of the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes.  The pancakes had a delicious flavor, but I've definitely had better.  They weren't as fluffy as I would have liked them, but they were still really good.For my entrée, I built my own omelette, and once I got to the center of the omelette I realized it was full of cream cheese.  The reason why I didn't order the Smoked Salmon Scramble is because of the cream cheese and the waitress knew I didn't want cream cheese at all.  She did send the entrée back even though I told her not to worry about it because I had already picked a lot of it out trying to eat around it, but she insisted.  Regardless to the fact, the omelette needed salt and pepper, as it was very bland.Along with the omelette that I built, I chose the corn muffin as my bread and it was dry and pretty tasteless, even with the blueberries that were baked in it.I got to try some of the Short Rib Hash and it was good.  The portion size was pretty big, which I guess is supposed to make up for the high price on the entrée.  I also had a bite of the banana muffin and it left a lot to be desired.Overall, I am glad to say I finally tried Sarabeth's, but I have no intent on ever coming back.  The food isn't justified by its overpriced menu items.",9,0,1,Lily M.,"Dallas, TX",621,875,1389

If you want more coffee you need to pray for divine intervention, because apparently the law is that none other than your own server can get you a refill. Since the disappearance of the tasty and unique Red Omelette from the menu, the remaining options pale in comparison. And if you ask for apricot and orange preserves you'll get raspberry, and if you persist you'll eventually (eventually) get what you asked for.

My parents also shared a bowl of oatmeal. My dad said his pancakes were good, but you could definitely tell they were made a while ago and placed under the warmer until they were ordered. However, the worst part is that both my moms and my eggs Benedict were room temperature. I'm not sure if you've ever eaten a poached egg that is cool, but it's not very good. I just dealt with it and ate it but my mom politely told the waiter. She was very nice and the waiter seemed very concerned and the manager came over and asked how they could fix it. Now, we are from Texas and are polite and my mom was not about to ask for it for free or another one or whatever. So the manager did nothing. On top of all that, the oatmeal was room temperature at best. When I took my parents here on Mother's Day when it was their first time in NYC, I was expecting better quality food. We ended up paying $140 I believe for the meal, which was mediocre at best due to the temperature. The food itself tasted great, but it was evident they were made at least an hour before hand and just kept under the warmer, except in the case of the eggs Benedict they were just kept in the back it seems like. Overall, it was a disappointing experience and I would have expected the manager to offer to comp the eggs Benedict at they very least. I mean how can you charge a mom, on Mother's Day, for eggs Benedict that were cold...? It's just poor customer service if you ask me.",7,0,0,Jared N.,"New York, NY",0,2,0

The apricot pork sausage was amaaazing, highly recommend these! The chicken Apple were a bit dry. However, both of our Benedicts were superb.

2.0,4/4/2016,"Let me start by stating that I came here for Sunday brunch......bad idea. Busy is an understatement; I waited 20 minutes in  the overly crowded front area of the restaurant. 20 minutes isn't horrible its the fact that there is literally no where to stand while you wait. The service once you are seated is great, you are pretty much in and out. The dining area is open and spacious. one thing I wasn't crazy about is their seating by a glass wall. I felt as if I were dining with the couple on the other side of the wall because the tables are lined up. I guess this wouldn't be such a big deal if you are seated by people who can keep their focus on their own company but this was not my case. The food was a bit bland. I ordered the classic eggs benedict and was not pleased at all. I also tried the crab meat guac and chips which was delicious, I recommend this dish.

I would've given four stars, but I found a hair in my eggs benedict when I was halfway into my second one. I'm not the type to return my food, and we were also on a schedule.

I was coming to NYC and a friend of mine happened to be in the area and suggested we go since my hotel was nearby. It was around 4 pm on a Sunday afternoon.I arrived and the front dining area was pretty full. There was one party of two waiting and I was going to ask for a table. This is the first issue. There are two hosts- the gentleman was on the phone taking reservations so he asked me to wait. I had no problem with that. However, there was a female hostess who basically stood there, haughtily looking off into the distance like how dare I even try to look at her. Do your job and take that stick out of your ass, honey. So the gentleman was polite enough once he got off the phone and he told me it would be a 5-10 minute wait. Okay, no problem. Ms. Stick in Her Ass takes me to the back part of the restaurant and literally sits me next to the drafty door to the patio. There are dozens of open seats because the back part of the restaurant was nearly empty. It was rude!!! A gentleman comes over and I order coffee while I wait for my friend to arrive. The coffee is like mud. I don't normally drink it with much cream but I put more cream in than normal and it didn't even change color. My friend arrives and the waiter comes back, she orders water and when he returns, we haven't really looked at the menu yet. She asks him to give us a minute and I kid you not, he literally turned around, took one step, and then turned back to us and said ""are you ready yet?"" It was almost comical. I kind of gave him a look because at this point my patience was wearing thin and he didn't come back, a female server came to take our orders and finish up our service. I got the cinnamon apple French toast with a side of bacon. The portions were really big but I didn't seen any cinnamon and the ""apple butter"" was a lump of too sweet jelly. It tasted okay but honestly, I could cook a better French toast. The bacon was too crispy for my taste, almost to the point of burnt.

3.0,1/17/2016,"Extremely underwhelming experience. For the price point, it makes no sense. $10 for a side of chewy bacon? The freshly squeezed grapefruit juice was the best part of my meal. My muffin was cold and I had to ask for it to be warmed. My companion ordered a drink and it was weak. She ordered another and requested it be actually made with a discernable amount of alcohol....to no avail. We ordered the side of bacon with the meal and had to ask for it twice. It came out after they warmed up our pastries. My kale salad and eggs were ok, but the brussel sprouts could have been cooked longer as this vegetable can be a bit firm for an accompaniment to eggs..

4.0,1/16/2016,"Prior to my brunch visit today, I'd only been to the location on the Upper West Side.Here I arrived at around 12:15 to meet a friend. There was a line outside but as she had already entered our names, there was minimal wait (there are no reservations on weekends and parties aren't seated until everyone is present).Service was pretty attentive but not overbearing, which was great. UWS was a little laggy. There was never a point at which we had to search or wait for assistance. It's not too large so it felt intimate but we weren't crowded.Generally in New York, waiters typically forget or do not return to the table to refill my water until I flag them down; at Sarabeth's, whenever I got below a third of a glass, my water was refilled.I ordered an Apple Cinnamon French toast and a Bowl of Berries to split. The bowl was definitely big enough to split as a side though the fruit was oddly a little warm. The french toast was really good. The presentation was appealing but not too fussy which for me is ideal (I hate to feel like I shouldn't mess up my meal).I was slightly surprised by the ticket but it's Midtown Manhattan between Fifth and Sixth; one has to expect a few extra dollars thrown in.I definitely plan to return",0,0,0,Mikelle S.,"Manhattan, NY",3,1,1

2.0,1/10/2016,"By far the most overrated brunch place in town. I like going here with friends on occasion, to treat them to an elegant, NYC brunch, and am without fail disappointed with the service every time. We went again this morning when my cousin was in town, and our server tipped the scale for me-I'm never coming back here. Our server was slow, and hostile. He resented whenever we asked him for things, sighing loudly and grumbling, and was quick to tell us they couldn't do something or didn't have it. Objectively, we were nothing but patient and kind. But when I pay $15 for oatmeal, and request the apple be diced on top, it shouldn't be a problem. For any other restaurant of that tier in any part of town it wouldn't have been a problem. My server told me they didn't have diced apple, so I asked for slices, and I had to sit and dice the apple with my butter knife to put into my $15 oatmeal. I would've asked for cinnamon too, but at that point I just wasn't going to bother. My fiancé and my cousin both ordered scrambled eggs, but instead of a standard price for scrambled eggs and a side, he charged everything as a side, so scrambled eggs with toast and fruit was $27, with coffee it was $30. An omelette with coffee would be $10 less, and include toast. There are some good dishes, the omelettes and eggs Benedict, but it's simply not worth what it costs. I don't mind sassy New York servers, but when I'm paying $15 for oatmeal, you can at least try to be nice and professional. If you want a decent brunch in that neighborhood go to Marlin Bar, it's delicious.",1,0,0,Frances B.,"New York, NY",226,228,4
2.0,1/7/2016,This place really isn't worth the price. My girlfriend and I ordered the classic and the smoked salmon eggs benedict and it was nothing special- the bread was a little too hard. The white* sangria wasn't out of this world also. We barely touched it and tried to gulp down half of it before leaving. It tasted too strongly of rosemary more than anything. Also ordered a side of fries (big mistake it was $9 and it was like McDonald's fries) and the sausage with apricot sauce. The sausage with apricot sauce was the ONLY the thing worth ordering from here. We ended up with a bill of $96 for brunch for mediocre food.

Turns out they had double charged me for my dinner and claimed that there was nothing they could do but that the money would probably reappear within 3-5 days.

4.0,12/30/2015,"Generally I enjoyed my experience here, although it wasn't perfect for a couple of reasons.To start, this place is very popular for brunch and I've heard lots of good things about it on that front.  We opted for dinner and had a chance to try out a lot of their dishes.  For starters I was impressed by their tuna tartare.  The flavor was solid and the tuna itself was fresh and satisfying.  The calimari was pretty straightforward and nothing memorable.  The crab guacamole appetizer was big and can easily feed several people.  The flavor itself was pleasant and it is a good item to order if your'e looking to share something.As for the entrees, I tried the seafood couscous which was fine.  The seafood was flavorful and all in all it was a relatively tasty entree.  I ordered the evening's special, which was a skirt steak paired with kale salad and potatoes.  The steak itself was average and lacked flavor.  I think the meat to sauce ratio was slightly off and that may have played a role in the lack of anything memorable about the dish.  In terms of dessert, we tried the ice cream sandwich sampler, which was good.  The only issue was that the item was deceptively heavy and if you're feeling full by the time you reach dessert, I would not recommend ordering this unless you are planning to share it with several other people.  As expected given the use of their gelato, the dessert is rich and pretty heavy.  Thankfully I ordered a scoop of lemon sorbet which helped offset some of that heaviness.Overall I think the dining experience was slightly above average.  I'm not sure if the food itself was worth the price tag but at least the service was good and the ambiance of the restaurant was pleasant (if you sat in the front near the entrance).  It's always nice to have a view of the park and do a little people watching while you wait for your food.  All in all this was a solid four start experience.  Good, but far from perfect and some may also feel the price to food equation is slightly off.",5,0,1,Kevin W.,"Manhattan, NY",1288,747,1080

Ok we are not from China or a Saudi prince perhaps we are not your preferred clientele but to wait an hour and a half for a table of 6  as you sit every deuce and four top that walks in after us Is ridiculous. Friends had recommended this place and I will try it again on my own. But you need a better hostess in place who understands the room.

4.0,12/17/2015,"I had seen Sarabeth teaching people how to make eggs Benedict (one of my all-time favorites) on ""Worst Cooks in America"" and thought it would be fun to try her restaurant out on a visit to NYC my wife and I went on. I put a reservation in on Open Table and we were seated a few minutes after we arrived. It was pretty late in the morning on a Wednesday, and they were doing some good business. Our waiter greeted us and was extremely pleasant and professional throughout the meal. I had already perused the menu days before we got there and knew where I was going to make my play: Crab Cake Eggs Benedict! My wife ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and we got a plate of the home fries to share.Food was flat out excellent all the way around. My dish came with a nice salad on the side, which I hadn't seen done before. I would definitely eat there again to try a few other things, maybe their lunch menu, which looked like it had some interesting things. The older couple that set next to us got up to leave and the woman leaned down to my wife and told her they had been discussing what lovely skin she had! Not really something the restaurant did, but that really just put the cherry on top of our very nice experience there! Why not five stars? Just a little pricey. It is a block or two from the Waldorf, so you're paying for location, too. Like I said, I would go back and I don't mind spending money on good food, but when it really starts getting up there, it can be hard to justify the price.

But, the food was only fair. The pumpkin muffin was fairly dry, and the admittedly large $10 side of bacon was inconsistent. Some underdone, some overdone. The latte was very good, but don't think for a second that you are going to sit on the patio and have coffee. I briefly contemplated that move after I was seated, and was quickly told by two of the staff that I could not stay on the patio if I was only going to have coffee. So I ordered a muffin. I was then told that that was not enough of a food order to stay on the patio. I said good grief, fine, I'll take bacon too, even though I'm not hungry. The host was not friendly at all, and it was quite obvious at that point that they want you in and out as quickly as possible. Further, the indoor decor is extremely dated and boring.

Our waiter came around and right off the bat, my 13-year-old cousin mentioned his attitude-completely unenthusiastic and kind of rude. He was very slow getting around to our table, and the way he acted all night was unprofessional-especially when we asked for refills. Instead of just informing us that it would cost extra, he rudely stated that ""they don't do refills."" Our food took a while to come out, and we grew impatient. One of us at our table jokingly said that we should just go to McDonald's, and one of the other waiters must have heard and went back to check on our food-I think that all of the workers caught on that we were upset with the service and tried to help out.     Service aside, the food was good-I liked the variety of bread in the bread basket (although the butter could have been softened!), my cousins loved their steak, and my Grown Up Grilled Cheese was pretty good.

The crab eggs Benedict was good.  I didn't expect the crab to be fried but have to say it was the highlight of the dish.  The ricotta lemon pancakes, served with fresh blackberries were excellent as were the banana apple pancakes.

We got seated right away with no wait. Our waiter took our order. It took a while to get our food. Let me just say I have never ordered a $20 Waffle and I was kind of excited to try because I expected it to be fluffy, mouth watering and just amazing. The food came and the presentation was exceptional. Everything went downhill when I took the first bite. I got the Toasted Coconut waffle let me just say it tasted like a flavorless dry biscuit (no kidding) needed lots of water to take it down. I also got a side of eggs again no flavor just basic eggs. My friend got a Lemon Ricotta Pancake again we tasted no lemon. We also tried Fat and Fluffy french toast which wasn't so bad only the outside was soaked and cooked the inside was just bread no extra flavors its still not worth the $19. I really wish I would've taken the time to read the Yelp reviews before I stepped foot into this place. I give the two star for scenery and presentation. But they lost me in flavor.

Slices of avocado also makes the dish even better. Salad veggies are very fresh and dices of bacon just make my day usually. I have been here for brunch lunch and dinner. Ambience is great with no doubt and is not packed if u come on weekdays no matter for lunch or dinner. Another dish I would recommend is guacamole with chips and crab meats!

Fifteen minutes later, an hour after we arrived... our appetizer and some bread arrived (half the amount of the bread that was in the basket which they then brought us in the middle of our meal). And the water (which was all that was brought to our table for an hour) was $3/bottle... for NYC tap water... I'm happy to pay for a good product, this was not even close to worth it.

4.0,10/3/2015,"We came in, mainly because the location was next door to our hotel, the Park Lane and we had had a day of walking around NYC in the rain and wind of pre-Hurricane Joachin. The restaurant is a jewel of a place with efficient greeters who seat you (with a reservation) quickly. There were no empty seats and everyone seemed to be having a good time, with the exception of a young woman who entered this boutique-sized place with an enormous stroller occupied by a child of about six months of age. Her party was discretely placed in a private side area and we did not hear any of the protestations of her child, although the hour had to be past his bedtime and she spent much of the time standing and toddling him. Been there.Our server, Andreas was very informative, giving honest opinions of the food choices, when asked, and working his several tables with panache devoid of pomposity and replete with charm and information. We were treated to snippets on the history of the proprietress, the food choices at different times of the day and the advisability of being patient if we planned to come for brunch. Apparently brunch processes literally 1000 people a day, but does it efficiently!We ordered the crab and guacamole dip, which never came, but the daily special of grouper on seafood couscous and salmon with herb mushroom fries did so promptly, so we didn't notice until the next day!  I had never had grouper before, and found it just another tasteless white fish that would have been better put in a highly-seasoned taco. Putting that aside after a couple of unimproving bites, I turned to the bed of seafood couscous  upon which it lay. What a revelation! It was as though I were having risotto with delicious, generous bites of lobster, shrimp and crab cooked to tender perfection. I should have ordered this as my entree (it was available as such). My husband's salmon was presented medium rare, swimming in melted butter and he enjoyed it, if his heart did not.We treated ourselves to the pot de creme and ice cream sandwich trays, on Andreas' recommendation. The former was adequate, if not as rich as expected and the latter included the new fad of sea-salted caramel ice cream sandwiched between oatmeal cookies, vanilla with chocolate cookies and some other choice which was too forgettable to recall, all sitting on artistic swirls of sweet sauces, sufficiently there for effect, if not enough to taste. I gained new respect for the traditional ice cream sandwich, when the cookies, having been chilled, seemed thick and relatively tasteless. I must admit that I am not a fan of salted caramel, whether by sea salt or quarry salt (which, I suspect, are ultimately from the same geological source, right?)

We were right, but were assured that the wait for an inside table was less than 20 minutes. We asked if we could wait outside given the sheer number of people crowded around the hostess stand and were assured that yes, they would call for us both inside and out.Sadly, they did not and we waited approximately 30 minutes before realizing that we had likely missed them calling us. My husband went back inside and we were assured that we would be seated next.They placed us at a table for 2 in a small room that accommodated 6 tables. Clearly, no one was assigned to our table as we again were subjected to another wait while new parties were seated around us and immediately tended to. My husband got up after 15 minutes and asked one of the waiters to please check on us. Apparently, it was not his section. Instead of graciously addressing us and alerting the proper member of the waitstaff to our neglect, he very rudely and curtly took our order and stomped off. I've never been treated with such disrespect by someone in the service industry and find this completely unacceptable. We would have requested to speak with a manager, but no one came back to check on us. Ever. The food was dropped off unceremoniously by a runner who quickly disappeared. We ate the fat and fluffy French toast (I'll begrudgingly admit that this was excellent) and the coconut-topped waffle (very dry, very hard texture) in disbelief.

However, we were willing to sit anywhere and they were able to sit us immediately at the bar. I ordered a ""Goldie Lox"", a smoked salmon, scrambled eggs and cream cheese mix with a side of toast. 7/10 for the meal. Delicious lox but too much cream cheese for the amount of eggs. $19Also had a morning classic mimosa which was fine and dandy but cost $14.

She wasn't so keen being so close to the smelly horses outside so we chose inside. The restaurant is filled with light and it was much larger than I expected. We were sat out the back near a skylight. I was surprised at how pricey it is, but they do offer a fixed prix menu for lunch at $32. Between us we ordered 1 fixed prix menu & an additional main course. I chose traditional eggs benedict which was delicious. My friend had the shrimp Mac & cheese, I didn't ask what she thought, but she left a lot of the shrimp. For the fixed menu we ordered the market salad and chocolate cake for dessert. The market salad was mainly leaves with some dressing, it would have been ok as a side dish but was a lot of leaf for an appetizer! The chocolate cake was enjoyable, but I thought it was on the small side. Our water was consistently refilled, but service wasn't always on hand, but that didn't bother us so much as we were just chatting and catching up.

The rude service (both times I have been to this location) is uncalled for (as my friends and I tend to be the mellow type that don't really make servers go out of their way to get anything beyond putting what we order on the table).The food was also only just average (just like any other you could get at a brunch place in Astoria, and for less money too).Coffee (unlimited refill): pretty good.Fat & Fluffy French Toast - pretty fresh and generous portion. I would order this again if I ever decide to return.Salmon Eggs Benedict: Good, but you could get the same thing somewhere else for less. Applewood Smoked Bacon (a side): really good. Could really try if you are in the mood for something naughty for brunch.Garden Omelet: not something I would recommend since it's not anything ordinary.

To be fair, I was with a large group that did a mass order so perhaps it would have been better if I had just ordered individual dishes, but overall I was very underwhelmed.

We somehow found our way down to the concierge desk,  but not before guzzling two vital ice waters to restabilize our vision.  I asked the concierge for a delicious,  but not too expensive brunch recommendation and he sent us on our way. The concierge clearly had a different idea of what 'cheap'  was,  but nevertheless,  we sat down across from central park at a swanky looking ristorante. We chose the street side seats so as to get the real feeling of New York in my last few hours before I flew out to iceland. It felt like we had been transported to a brunch scene of a Hollywood movie.  The waiter was extremely well mannered and formal, remembering to fill our waters at the first sign of depletion. The eggs Benedict screamed my name,  and I screamed back it's as I ordered them from our waiter. As we waited for the meal to arrive, a couple accompanied by their young daughter ferociously exited a cab.  It was evident that the submissive female partner had done something to extremely upset the male.  He aggressively forced a takeaway box filled with food in to her face and stormed away.  Onlookers from the street stood by in shocked silence. The female partner chased him down the street pleading with him as the ignored daughter trudged behind them whining to herself as to indicate that it's not an uncommon occurrence for them to publicly battle so heatedly.  I smelled something and turned back to the table to find two perfectly poached eggs laying in front of me, drizzled with glistening hollandaise sauce.  My mouth began to water and I instantly forgot about the domestic street dispute and dug my knife in to the white fluffy exterior of my egg.  The yolk spilled out and spread across the plate creating a yolky moat around the English muffin it had been sitting on. I took my first bite and the tantalising hollandaisy tang that I had been craving hit every taste bud in my mouth.  From beginning to end my satisfaction was as high as the top of the rock.  My friend and I were foreign and had both spent a bit of time in america,  but still struggled to agree over a suitable tip.  We threw down what I thought could be considered an insult.. We had already stood up and it was too late to turn back because the waiter was heading to collect payment. We bolted and didn't look back as if the most horrific crime you can commit in the states is to give 10% to a server..

5.0,6/27/2015,"This is a very busy location. I came here for breakfast on a Friday morning and it was packed. I was 10 minutes late for my reservation, but I didn't have to wait very long to be seated. The waiter that we had was very friendly and attentive. I had the four flowers juice. It was very good, a little thick but good. I also had the classic eggs Benedict with a side of bacon. The eggs Benedict were amazing. So good. The bacon was good as well. It was a little over cooked though. My friend got the omelet with cream chess and scallions. The eggs tasted so fresh. The whole experience at this restaurant was amazing. I might consider going to one of their other locations to see if they are as busy as this one. It's next to the plaza hotel, so I'm guessing a lot of guests that stay there try to get a table.

The chicken salad was not an entree portion and pretty bland. I have been here several times and have never really loved it, but the location is convenient. This time will be my LAST.

After asking for my food, they brought the exact same presentation out. I asked where the ricotta was, explained the pancakes were dry and the manager said the ricotta was in the batter.

The hostess said it was freshly squeezed but they brought it in from another location.  We sat down and our server who had zero personality took our order.  The food was average at best.  My daughter ordered eggs Benedict and the English muffin was burned on the bottom.  We make eggs Benedict at home and it's better.  My eggs were tasteless, the bacon came swimming in bacon grease, and the toast tasted like cardboard.  My 10 year old makes a better breakfast.  Save your money.

The salad was amazing - tons of lobster and crab, a few shrimp, bacon, blue cheese, etc. A really nice amount of food without being a totally ridiculous portion size. The muffin basket was also really good - it came with a fresh scone, pumpkin muffin, blueberry muffin and something else I can't remember. The blueberry was the best of the bunch, in my opinion. I also got the Five Flowers mimosa, which was amazing! It has five different kinds of fresh fruit juices, St. Germain and Prosecco.

3.0,4/24/2015,"My cousin gave us a gift card to try this place out so while in New York we tried it out. We came to the one right in front of Central Park. It looked like it was a little fancy and upscale but my cousin recommended it so we gave it a try. The staff was all wearing white shirts and ties, just looked very clean and crisp. We sat down and ordered what my cousin recommended. My wife and I shared the smoked salmon eggs Benedict and the lemon ricotta pancakes. We also ordered the guacamole toast which by the way was my favorite thing I ate there that day. Just so fresh and delicious. The eggs Benedict, not so much. We came to realize we are not a fan of eggs cooked that way. The pancakes were good. They did have this lemon taste to them that was good but they seemed a little cold and hard and not so much warm and fluffy. To top it all off when it came time to pay we couldn't use our gift card and they wouldn't take it. Apparently we had to use it at one of there other four locations which made no sense what's so ever.

We have come for both brunch and lunch and loved it! Great location next to Central Park. It's pretty busy on the weekend but the wait is not usually too bad!Start with the four flowers juice, such an invigorating start to your morning! They have it with champagne too but unfortunately I haven't been drinking any of the times I visited.Some of my favorites are the avocado toast with feta - literally outstanding, so full of flavor! It's really filling though so great to share. Their apple cinnamon French Toast was wonderful too (with bananas and apple butter - heaven) if you're looking for something sweet. Savory choices - omelettes are a great size and some with a choice of bread with butter and fruit compote. My sister got the goat cheese and spinach which was amazing and had lots of cheese, exactly what I look for in an omelette.The sides are large and definitely plenty to share! Breakfasts there have really taken the cake for us and I would highly recommend Saturday or Sunday brunch here!As far as lunch, our faves are the roasted chicken salad (all chicken and veggies with a light vinaigrette) or the seafood Cobb salad which gives you a great amount of crab, lobster, and shrimp!

My sister got the Garden Omelette, she said it lacked seasoning. Food during my second visit early in the morning was OK. Service lacked in the morning. The waiters were pushing off my bag that was behind my chair on the floor and not even once did they say sorry or picked it up. Like I said, New Yorkers aren't morning people. I get it, but jeez.

3.0,4/16/2015,"Came here specifically for a late breakfast/brunch & was really looking forward to some french toast & eggs Benedict; the pics online looked amazing. Location right across from Central Park is great. Restaurant set-up was a little crowded but okay. A little old-school European in decor & style.  We got lucky & only had to wait under 5 minutes for our table. We actually waited longer at the table to get water than we waited to be sat. Our experience with our server was kind of interesting; he never smiled & seemed very serious. We put our order in & the food did come out in a timely matter. There was a mix-up with our fruit bowl which they fixed.  Breakfast is pricey but I think pretty in line with NYC eateries such as Sarabeths. My Goldie Lox plate was good & so was the scone & jam. My friends fluffy French toast was sweet & light & actually tasted like donuts! The salmon eggs Benedict was good as well. Our bacon was cooked perfectly with the perfect amount of crisp. Nothing really stood out as exceptional, especially considering the price of our breakfast. I'd say that this place is likely overhyped. We didn't try any of their specialty juices ($9 a glass -- yikes!) but their Four Flowers juice seemed popular. Overall.. Good breakfast but nothing great for the price.

2.0,4/5/2015,"Went there for a bachelorette party dinner on a Friday night. This place is usually packed for brunch, so we picked dinner instead. The food was good, great atmosphere and nice wine selection. When we visited the restaurant they were going through construction so the seating situation was a little weird, which was fine. I have heard a lot of things about this place so I had my expectation up. We ordered 3 entrees and 1 appetizer (we sort of are before so I shared an entree and appetizer with my friend). The bill came down to about $45 per person. The restaurant wasn't busy at all on the night we went, so we spent about 2 hours chatting and sipping the wine at the table. Towards the end of the night, I noticed our waiter kept looking into our direction and making awkward eye contacts. I thought he just wanted to get us there asap. When we finally paid and signed our check, the waiter felt the need to open the check holder, and was like, ""just wanna make sure I have all 4 signed copies..."" And he picked out all the copies and laid them on the table and started counting them, ""1..2...3..4.."". Brah, you already swiped our card and is that really necessary? My friends and I looked at each each, and was like, what is he doing...I felt like he was making sure we...tipped? Regardless, we still tipped pretty well given the substandard service we receive from our waiter, not mentioning being hustled out by his gaze throughout the night and the weird I-cant-tell-4-receipts-without-counting-them-out-loud scheme toward the end.

Too much horseradish-gave it a dirty, earthy taste. The pickled veggies that topped the Bloody Mary were delicious! Also shared a salad with my friend as a starter-that was great!! Perfectly dressed.

Make a reservation or come prepared with lots of witty conversation and maybe a good novel to while away the seemingly hour-long wait.

Once  that got us a seat by the window in the hallway near the kitchen with all the wait staff rushing by us. I've learned from that experience! Now I'm much more savvy and ask for specific windows. The food itself is good...solidly good. They have both brunch and lunch items, but I invariably stick to brunch.  Service while friendly and helpful, can feel a bit rushed.

4.0,2/26/2015,"I ordered the Four Flowers Juice which was a mixture of orange, pineapple, banana and pomegranate. It was very good: Fresh, full, fruit flavor as well as wonderfully sweet.As for my meal, I had a hard time deciding but finally picked the Farmer's Omelette, filled with leeks, ham (substituted with chicken sausage), chunks of potato and gruyere cheese. The omelette was delicious- Cooked to perfection and all the flavors came together so that I could especially taste the gruyere cheese with potato and sausage. It also came with my choice of muffin, scone or toast and I decided to get the pumpkin muffin. I didn't even get a chance to taste my muffin until later because I was so full from the omelette. The muffin was speckled with sunflower seeds on top and I enjoyed the strong, sweet taste of pumpkin.The person that I was dining with ordered Fat & Fluffy French Toast with strawberries, which he graciously shared. The French toast was simply divine: Huge, thick slices of sweet caramelized breading with powdered sugar, syrup and sugared strawberries. The French toast truly was fat and fluffy, as well as slightly crispy on the outside and perfectly fluffy inside.We also ordered a side of chicken sausage with apple compote. I really enjoyed the apple flavor, so much that I had some of the apple compote by itself. It was a delightful meal at Sarabeth's with great service.

1.0,2/24/2015,"I called for delivery at 9:30 am and was informed that deliveries don't start until 11:30 am so I waited and called back about 11:35 and my receipt shows my order was put in by 11:55 am. I asked the young lady how much it would be and she told me she didn't know because a bartender had to ring it up (after she had taken my order) at which time I also gave her full instructions as to where the delivery guy should bring the order. That should have been a red flag. I waited an hour for my food before I called to check up on it. When I called back another young lady answered the phone and I notified her that my order had not arrived and she put me on hold for a manager. A real live hold with music and everything. I waited and waited and waited before the line was cut and this happened about 2 more times in that order before I actually spoke with a manager. I told the manager my order had not arrived and she simply told me that all orders had been sent out. By this time it was after 1 pm and I told her I ordered around 11:35 am then she put me o  hold again. She came back and said something about comping one part of my order but that she didn't know how that would work because the delivery person would not believe me if I told him that I was instructed to only pay for 2 portions. Second red flag but I brushed that off as well because I was trying to be patience and I was really a excited about this food I would be trying for the first time because I always order from ""Stage Star"" and want something different. She basically said that she would check it out and call me back. When she called back she said the delivery guy was back at the resturant and she had canceled my order because she didn't think I wanted it anymore. I told her I still wanted my order and she said that she would send him back out. Needless to say once he finally arrived it was 2:30 pm with a $35 ticket where my waffle was $18. WTF?!!! Nothing had been comped. And to add injury to insult the food wasn't even recooked. It was the same food from 11:35 am. I was sooooooo disappointed to say the least because I waited and waited and was so excited to end up with this shitty service and old cold food they wanted me to pay $35 for a waffle, sausage, and home fries. I thought of calling the manager back but I could see myself cursing her out and I just didn't want to be pulled out of character.

3.0,2/24/2015,"Solid breakfast/brunch spot on one of the cutest streets in NYC.  We enjoyed an almost too-quick breakfast at Sarabeth's.  Food and service was fine, but a few things could have made our experience a bit better.- No major complaints on the service, but I felt like there were a bunch of waiters just running around and expediting food, it was a bit of a whirlwind to watch and we definitely didn't get that warm friendly service.  Our food came out less than 10 minutes after ordering, but then it took forever to get our check.- Food was good but presentation as lacking. I loved the homemade english muffins, but the plates were uninspired and a bit sterile looking. My eggs benedict was pretty bland, and honestly, some potatoes or fruit would have been a better side than mixed greens. - Super packed - maybe they just need to do some rearranging.

They take reservations, but will not seat you until the entire party has arrived even if there are many empty tables and no wait. This is annoying when you have to wait by the door on a very cold day. The menu is very nice, but very pricy. We started with coffee which was not hot. We ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes, the spinach and goat cheese omelet and the classic eggs Benedict. The pancakes were not hot, the omelet was not cooked in the middle and the eggs Benedict were lukewarm. The omelet was taken back and they made a new one which did come out hot. We also ordered a fruit bowl which was basically one sliced banana, 1 cut up strawberry and some orange and grapefruit sections- ridiculous for $12! The waiter service was very good which is why I gave the two stars, but I will not go back to this restaurant for just the service.

Get the sensation....yes, they are that good). But today's review is dedicated to their manager Shirley, who went above and beyond the call of duty to rescue my NYC visit.   After two failed attempts at both fedex and staples to print a concert ticket, I sat drinking my win-osa contemplating my dilemma.   Why is it this difficult to print one page in manhattan?!   Cue the trumpets:  Shirley graciously agreed to print my ticket in their back office.   Minor thing, yes.  But I've learned that in the grand scheme of things, it's the little things in life that often mean the most.  The staff here is consistently polite and polished...now having seen Shirley in action, it's evident why.    Five stars!",1,0,0,Monique M.,"Washington, DC",173,261,345
1.0,1/22/2015,"**Avoid During ConstructionLet's start with the coffee;""Here's Cream and Sugar for the Coffee"". So I add a little sugar and then cream but my coffee never changes colors so I ask if it's milk or cream. The waiter says milk so I ask then for cream. Not a huge thing, but to a coffee drinker there is a difference. Looking over the BREAKFAST menu, I look over the several egg dishes and settle on one that ended up only resembling the description. Eggs and Kale with Roasted Veggies. This turned out to be a salad topped with sunny side up eggs. The roasted vegetable were ice cold. Now there was a lunch menu with a list of salads, yet this fell under the list of omelettes and scrambled eggs. Our very polite waiter removed this from the bill since I didn't actually have more than a couple of bites. **Now, the worst of it all and the reason for one star; CONSTRUCTION inside of the restaurant. I mean, so loud it cleared an entire dining room of patrons. This noise occurred through 80% of our meal. It started just after placing our order so we were stuck. No warning when making the reservation or when being seated that we would endure this noise that was so loud conversation between the three of us was not possible most of the time.

Service- not only did I not really feel taken care of, the staff had their ""family meal"" literally right next to our table and were also loudly counting tills.

Pro tip: if you are staying at a hotel get your concierge to call in for your brunch reservation. This courtesy allowed us to be seated in 10 minutes despite massive crowds.  The decor is traditional and cheery. It feels vintage like a Wes Anderson movie but feels modern enough to seem casual and not stuffy. Ie: nice crown moldings but no white tablecloths. We started with the avocado toast with feta, which I found underwhelming. They used guacamole vs avocado slices and white baguette bread vs wheat. The almond crusted French toast was outstanding. The lemon ricotta pancakes were a huge hit. I usually don't like pancakes, but these had a great texture and flavor so they didn't need a preponderance of syrup.  This is a great place for a fancier family brunch, because it's fairly fast service.  On the other hand it's not an ideal place for a long brunch with your girlfriends as its a high turnover restaurant and any more than 1 drink would make it a very pricey experience.",2,0,1,Erica G.,"Washington, DC",122,194,6

We visited for breakfast/brunch and I would recommend starting with a basket of their breads. All home made with outstanding jellies, it's a good way to start your journey because it's not a fast meal - get comfy you are going to be there a while. The coffee is strong but good (although it's served in tiny cups that really aren't reasonable for that busy of a resturant - the server literally has to come by to fill every 5 mins to keep up with a normal person and that's not the frequency with which we saw our server). The waffles/french toast/pancake items are like pure donuts on a plate. Sugar sweet and satifying. The omlette (goat and spiniach) was one of the best I have ever had. Toast, butter, scones, muffins - all wonderful and filling. We were probably there 2 hours (not counting the wait). The back room is warmer (winter) than the front and you don't have the hoards of people waiting watching your every bite. No one is rushed - they seem to be there for the long-haul and the experience.

We decided to sit at the bar for faster service because there wasn't a wait. Service was what you would expect from sitting at the bar. Not much going on. The menu is a bit limited but my experience is the smaller then menu, the better the food because they should really NAIL everything. I ordered the traditional Eggs Benedict partly, because its one of my favorites and also because its what they are known to do best. The pictures on yelp look SO GOOD! We must have come on an off day because our food was served under 3 minutes which made me question how fresh everything is. My biscuits were really hard and my yolk was damn near fully cooked! UGH. Everything about an Benedict that is supposed to be right, went completely wrong. The salad served on the side was over dressed and unappealing. I later looked at the menu and saw that there are other options but when I ordered the waiter did not ask which side I preferred. My date got the french toast, which was good but basic. You can't mess french toast up too bad can you?

Beyond that, we had to ask for a spoon because it wasn't brought out with the soup, even after giving the waitress time to notice on her own and bring it.  Had to ask for a steak knife when the steak frites were delivered.

1.0,12/5/2014,"Good food, but extremely disappointed with the service. First of all, the waiter always approached us with a dissatisfied, annoyed look on his face, as if serving Asian tourists, particularly those not from the United States, was extremely displeasing to him. While I initially attributed this to the possibility that the waiter may have been having an unpleasant day and thought nothing else of it, my thoughts turned to a different direction when I received the check with the ""Gratuity is Not Included"" portion circled and starred, as if I was not aware that tip needed to be included since my guests were international tourists. When I observed the waiter's interactions with other non-Asian customers, I also realized he was very amiable and smiling when interacting with others but not with us. I could only conclude then that our waiter may be racist towards Asians, which coupled with the manner in which my party had been attended to made my experiences there extremely unpleasant.Keep in mind though, that my experiences are only with this particular waiter and most likely not representative of the entire store. The place is very efficient in finding you a seat and serving its customers; however, its speed may sometimes backfire in the form of glasses that are not well washed. I had to ask for a new one for my guest, and the replacement glass still contained multiple bits of pulp presumably from a previous guest's drink.If you are an international tourist, particularly Asian, dining at this location, I hope your experiences are far better than what I have experienced.

Knowing brunch is New York's unofficial Olympic sport, we decided to walk in on a Tuesday before the lunch rush. We were able to get seated straightaway, at Table 78. This was not a good table (well, aside from the 2-top by the restroom--I imagine that's the worst seat in the house). It was directly in front of the bar and as expected, lots of hustle and bustle. I didn't mind that so much, but there is a loose floorboard by our table. My seat was facing the bar. Whenever the staff walked by our table, the floor would dip and squeak and my chair would move along with it. Our table was very close to another couple, so I couldn't move my chair without blocking the path for the staff. I asked my boyfriend if he experienced this but he said he didn't notice. Your mileage may vary.We ordered eggs benedict, morning crunch granola, freshly squeezed juice and coffee. The food came out very quickly and was good. Eggs were perfectly poached, but the bread was a tad hard. My boyfriend ordered the granola but regretted it because it was a small portion for him. (He really should have ordered the pancakes.) The service was polite and efficient. The experience didn't feel like one of those places where you are encouraged to linger and chat. I think we were in and out in about 45 minutes.

An $8 side of bacon is about eight slices of crispy delicious bacon, so we all shared. My wife ordered the eggs Benedict and then came out perfect. However the side salad that came with it was unnecessary and should've been potatoes for hash. My daughter ordered the pancakes and she enjoyed those. The jalapeno cheese omelette has chopped up fresh poppers so it is really hot. That was the one thing that was a little over-the-top.

At first, We were OK with the price because we expected our food to be reasonable portions and delicious. Unfortunately, they were not!! I ordered tomato soup to be my appetizer, I can say that this soup was the most delicious dish of the meal. However, the portion was very small so it's not worth $10 at all. Our first main dish was egg Benedict. It was just very 2 small eggs and mediocre taste. The worse thing was that it said in the menu that we can choose side order for main dish, but the waitress said it will be served with muffin only so we didn't need to choose. We were OK with that because We thought We will get muffin as a side order, but We ended up finding that the muffin were below the eggs. From my experience eating egg Benedict from many places, the bread is usually the part of the egg Benedict dish and we also get the other side order we choose so We didn't get the point why they indicated in the menu that we can choose side order. The worst thing of this dish was that 85%of my egg Benedict dish was vegetable so this dish shouldn't be priced 19$ at all!!! ( from what we got, it shouldn't be more than $10). Second main dish we ordered was French toast, which was just so so taste like the taste you can eat at Ihop or any other restaurant at 1/3 or half of this restaurant's price. For the drink, I ordered mixed fruit juice (I can't remember the name), the taste was mediocre and the portion was small. Again, my drink was not worth $8 at all!!  (This is my fault that I didn't notice the price when I ordered this drink). For the service, our waitress was not rude, but she seems to rush us to order and when I asked for the check, I had to asked 2 times. This unpleasant brunch costed us 70$ (for 2pp) and I can say that the food can fulfill only half of our stomaches. It likes we can eat 1 more meal immediately after eating these food.To sum up, this is a tourist-trap restaurant and everything seems to be overpriced. I won't recommend this place. By the way, I posted the photo of my food on my IG and wrote the description that The food were overpriced and the taste was just so so .

3.0,10/19/2014,"Breakfast (or brunch) is my favorite meal of the day, as I've mentioned many times before, so naturally, my first proper meal this time in NYC was exactly that!  Where is my first, and unfortunately, only real brunch/lunch stop?  Sarabeth's, of course!  I say of course because if you know me, I'm secretly (or not so secretly) a huge fan of Gossip Girl, and this is one of their favorite destinations.I had my usual latte to start, then finally decided to go all out and order the Crab Cake Benedict (24).  The latte was strong, with lots of fluffy foam (not the usual American latte foam), but nothing too spectacular in my opinion.  While the crab cakes were good, they seemed like they weren't as fresh as they could be.  The flavor was decent and not fishy, and of course it was real crab meat (for $24 one would hope so), but the crust was just stale.  The eggs were a little overcooked for my taste, and the muffins were very stale, but the salad was quite refreshing.  My friend had the Eggs & Kale (17), two eggs over a bed of delicious kale with some almonds.  The almonds were delicious and the dish fresh, but for what you're paying for?  Maybe a tad bit much.  Overall, I wasn't too impressed by my plate, but I'm still glad I came here for the experience.I feel like I must add that the service is quite good, but the wait for food is long and they only have one bathroom stall.  Maybe this is the New York way - I've noticed many restaurants only have one-toilet bathrooms.

All they care about is turning tables and getting people in and out as fast as they can. Our waiter was very abrupt and disinterested in what we had to say. The food was fine. I got the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict, which was ok. The eggs were cooked well so I have to give it to the chef who looks like he probably turns out similar quality food every time. It was just nothing to write home about. Andddd it was 20 dollars for a freaking Benedict. It felt like such a rip off! I didn't even get a choice of muffin- it came with all dishes but the Benedicts. C'mon people if I'm paying 20 bucks please give me a scone or something. Kind of disappointing but the decor is nice.

It didn't have as much flavor as I thought it would with the gruyere and ham, but it was still pretty good. The scone I got was a raisin scone with butter and raspberry jam.

2.0,9/4/2014,"I will admit that this place has a lot of space in the back, so their ability to seat people in a timely fashion and deal with the redic crowds is impressive. They've got good service, and good frontmen.That's pretty much all I can say is impressive.Overall, Sarabeth might be one of the most overrated NYC brunch establishments I've ever been to. I lived in Manhattan for 2 years and never came here once because there were SO MANY other great places to go without the tourism and pesky crowds. But in the spirit of fueling a friend's nostalgia, we went. I ate. I wasn't impressed.First of all, the food here is insanely overpriced. I paid $17 for (essentially) a western omelette and then another $8 for a side of home fries. That's $25 for an omelette and home fries. Frankly, when Egg (in Williamsburg) has a markedly elevated omelette and home fries for $10 less, I'd rather spend my 30 minutes of waiting time on the subway trekking over to Brooklyn.My husband got the short ribs hash, which I'll admit, tasted pretty good. But at $21 for a small plate of hash, it better be the best freaking hash I've ever had in my life. It was not. My ultimate moral of the story: there are SO MANY glorious brunch places in NYC. Why waste an hour+ to sit in a crowded tourism trap that costs TWICE as much as every other brunch place in town for mediocre brunch!? It just makes no sense to me at all.

I thought maybe they mistook my order and got me orange juice instead of freshly squeezed orange juice, so I asked them if mine was freshly squeezed explaining that it could be normal orange juice. He assured me that it was freshly squeezed... I was not fully convinced though. Anyways, I was still expecting the food to be amazing.

Ryt opp central patk, busy streets filled with tourists and mutiple restaurangs in a row, all with outdoor seating. So u can imagine a pretty scene. Anyway, we say down ryt away surprisingly. I ordered their 4 flower mimosa, i must say it was best part of my meal. So delicious. My friends liked to stick with coffee, prolly coz brunch drinks were $15 each. I won't blame them though, who would like to pay that much for a brunch drink when a million places in the city offer bottomless brunches at the same price. Anyway, we ordered food. I ordered french toast, and my friends ordered pancakes and omlettes. I have to say i had way higher expectations from this place, but i guess what they say is right. More locations u open, worse u get. My french toast was dry. Pancakes were just okay and omlette was bland. And on top of it our server was totally expressionless. It was like he was instructed to have a small talk with all the customers but actually had no interest in it. He asked us where are we from and before my friend who was visitng from Californa, could finish her reply. I thought it was rude. This happened every time he came by. And did I mention he did not care to smile even once or show any emotion in his voice. And on top of it, there was a bunch of servers having a full blown conversation ryt behind our table and so were bartenders on the bar which was ryt next to our table. In all i think the only reason i gave this place 3 stars are coz of the location, no wait time and the drink.

5.0,7/20/2014,"This is by far the best place to go In NYC if you are looking for a good breakfast, brunch or lunch. In the morning, the lemon ricotta pancakes are a must and well known by many. For lunch, I prefer the tomato mozzarella sandwich. The ambiance is very classic NY where you will see everyone from business people in suit and tie to tourists in their shopping attire in the winter and in shorts in the summertime. If it is a nice day out, they also have an outside area on the sidewalk directly across from the southern entrance to Central Park where you can people watch or sit after a nice long run through the park.

3.0,7/19/2014,"SaraBeth's is very much a traditional american brunch venue, opened with a sunny smile and friendly wait-staff.  Decor is bright and cheerful, and the fare that delicate balance between healthy and heavy; enough of the good stuff to keep the palate engaged, but not too much that you feel laden with culinary sins.Whether for brunch or lunch, fair weather or foul, it's a consistent spot to eat.",1,0,0,Ferdinand H.,"Baltimore, MD",1289,652,2
3.0,7/18/2014,"Kinda knew it would be hype but I wanted to take my grandma somewhere nice by Central Park so I figured I'd give it a go anyway.  As soon as I arrive I get that feeling of ""oh no...so many tourists here, should I turn back now..."" but I give it the benefit of the doubt.Bottom line is it's just ok, typical pricey pancakes etc. but it's average $ for NYC brunch spots.  Service is great though, tentative and friendly.  I'm sure most of it's popularity can be greatly attributed to it's ideal location and longstanding history.If you want details on the ""ok""...I ordered the talked up lemon ricotta pancakes.  I mean, yea I love some good lemon flavor in my pancakes, but really? To me that alone does not make an amazing pancake, and I think this idea is what gets people carried away.  Yes they were soft and fluffy, but I also expect my pancakes to be moist, and personally with a little more texture.  Disappointing and I guess others have lower pancake standards than I.French toast however was good, the thick slices with crispy edges and sugar is how I like it. It just doesn't seem worth such a wait - I mean I only waited 5 min for a table inside but this was a weekday morning, and still so many people crowding around by the entrance which is not an optimal atmosphere if you're sitting in the front.  Would never fight the weekend brunch crowds for it.  Perhaps this is where complaints about their service comes in.  But if I were dealing with the weekend brunch crowds, I'd be pretty irritable too. Not that it's an excuse.  Just sayin'.",2,1,0,Sabrina P.,"New York, NY",29,41,4

3.0,7/15/2014,"Perhaps my expectations were a bit too high...but...Sarabeth's didn't wow me like I had hoped it would. My husband and I came here during a return-to-NYC anniversary weekend, and I thought the combination of location (he proposed in Central Park) and amazing food (especially their so-called ""legendary"" baked goods and preserves) would make this place a winner. When I made the reservation, I noted that it was our anniversary, just in case that would give us an edge on preferential treatment or seating. Sadly, we were seated late and squished into a little corner table. (This is nit-picky, but every table around us had a vase with a little flower in it - except for ours!) I get it - I know to expect tight spaces in restaurants in the city, but we were uncomfortably close to the next table, and for me to get out from the booth seat required the other table to do some moving of their own. Our waiter was nice but not that attentive. He never came back to check on us and inquire as to how we were enjoying our meal (I did note another server doing this for her table, though, so perhaps our guy was just having an off day). Also, we had to ask two separate times for the check. For the food - it was good, but nothing really above 3 stars. I got the farmer's omelet, which included leeks, potatoes, ham, and gruyere cheese. I was hoping the potato chunks would be a bit more substantial but they were pretty mini. Overall, good flavor and a nice fluffy appearance, but not quite worth $16. It came with a baked good of my choice, so I got the pumpkin muffin which seemed to have pretty good reviews. I don't know why people rave about their baked goods - the muffin was so dry and crumbly. The preserves were quite good but I was disappointed in the muffin. My husband had the fat and fluffy french toast with strawberries. I'm not typically a french toast fan but I really enjoyed these! Coffee is really good - $4.50 per person but you get refills. The breakfast drinks are pretty pricey but are freshly squeezed so you get really high quality (oj and grapefruit juice are $8 each - an extra $4 or so will make it a mimosa).In all, the food is fine but I don't think it is special enough that I'd come back.",3,0,1,Juliet A.,"Washington, DC",1033,1069,1106
4.0,7/14/2014,"It was Friday morning in Manhattan and my husband and I were in search of food before heading over to the Central Park Zoo.  I quickly pulled out Yelp! to search for good breakfast options (other than Dunkin Donuts) and found Sarabeth's.  Reservations were recommended, but the first available per Open Table was not for a few hours and I was hungry now.  So we walked over and took a chance.  We first saw the patio hostess who told us if we wanted first available that we needed to go inside and speak to the main hostess.  Made me wonder why there was two hostesses - very confusing.When we went inside we were a little overwhelmed by how packed the place was, but the hostess told us the wait was only twenty minutes, so we decided to give it a try.  I was looking around the front room and I saw some jars of preserves with labels that looked familiar, but it really didn't click with me that I was in fact at the famous Sarabeth's known for amazing preserves.  I can't even tell you for sure where I have seen her products before, but I will be in search of them in the near future.After twenty or so minutes we were escorted back to our table and I think my husband and I both felt we were in a Tardis as the restaurant was ten times larger than it had appeared from the outside and the lobby.  The ambiance was a classic New York restaurant that you would see in Sex and the City, probably because the girls ate there once.The first thing I noticed on the menu was the 26 ounce Bloody Mary. Three and a quarter cups of tomato vodka heaven.  And the pickled vegetables on top were perfectly pickled and nice variety ranging from carrots and bell peppers to jicama.  I was determined to finish the whole thing, while still having at least one cup of coffee, and I was successful.  Lucky children at the zoo since I was blitzed.  Can I get more of those veggies?My husband selected the Farmer's Omelette and chose a corn muffin for his side.  The corn muffin was what you would expect - a simple corn muffin.  But the preserves made it amazing.  And the omelette was very tasty as well. It should be noted that the choices of sides were muffins (English, corn, bran, banana, pumpkin), croissant, scone or toast, all served with housemade preserves.I wanted to go with the short rib hash, as I was feeling carnivorous.  The eggs were perfectly cooked and the meat and potatoes were good, but not amazing.  I should have saved such an entree for more of a diner-style restaurant rather than a place like Sarabeth's, but it was by no means not good, just not great.But it was my side that made the whole experience simple amazing.  And so my one piece of advice would be for any visitor to Sarabeth's to simply skip all of the other breakfast selections and simply choose the Basket of Sarabeth's Muffins & Legendary Preserves.  This scone was the most amazing scone I have ever had before.  It was buttery, bu not overly flaky.  It was dense like a cake, but yet moist.  And once I added even the smallest amount of the most amazing preserves on Earth, it was literally heaven.  I wanted to take some to go, not that I knew when I would be able to eat it or that I had earned the right to experience more of its high-caloric goodness, but I just didn't want to say goodbye to it.If you're looking for breakfast while in New York, I highly recommend Sarabeth's.  Make a reservation and get the pastries.  Oh, and don't forget the Bloody Mary.More reviews at count4food.blogspot.com",1,0,0,Kyle R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,21,0

Came with a side of a muffin (or your choice of bread) The food's good but too ""perfect"", ""cookie cutter"", and ""consistent"" for me. I like my pancakes to have a little character.

We were seated by the wine closet (and the restaurant was not full), and promised that we would not be disturbed. Several times someone squeezed by to get in and out for wine. We started with crab guacamole, which we imagined would be some interesting twist on the traditional. Nope. It was guac with crab on top, studded with stale potato chips. We ordered a couple of glasses of wine, and twice were brought dripping wet glasses; when we asked for dry glasses it was taken as an extremely odd request. When our entrees arrived and I attempted to sprinkle pepper on my pot pie, the entire contents of the pepper flowed out due to a lid that was not screwed on. We've worked in restaurants before, and checking the lids is a basic tenet of turning a table. They brought me a new one, which took a while of course, with a couple of sincere apologies but NO mention whatsoever of comping a glass of wine, dessert, etc. Our server was terrific (don't remember name), but the bus staff was woefully inept, and needed to be given basic instructions by the server several times.

However we were told 30 minutes tops, and after 45 minutes I went to inquire as to what was taking so long. The hostess was not very friendly with me and told me we were next to be sat.

Even though every tourist and their dog will line up outside this place on a weekend day (due to its premier location on Central Park South between luxe hotels), and the price point may be slightly high ($20-25/entree), it's not one to be missed by locals.  The wait is never more than 20-30 minutes as the restaurant is massive and the service can be quick (when the waiters choose to move people in an out).  The reason you come here is for the food and the ability to tell your grandmother that Joan Rivers has her own table in the corner.The semi-legendary lemon ricotta pancakes are ridiculously good-eating and likely what 50% of patrons order.  You should do it too.  Just ask for extra syrup.Of the other items on the menu that I've tried (the Benedict, fritattas, omelets), all are above average NYC brunch offerings, which is hard to do.  The back room can get really loud (I mean LOUD), so the definite preference is to sit in the middle section of the restaurant.  The waiters also skimp on the coffee pours and can disappear for what seems like eternity, so stay on them.Bottomline, if I were looking for a non ""boozy brunch"" themed brunch that has excellent food and would be a safe spot to bring family and out of town guests, then Sarabeth's is a very solid option.",0,1,0,Mark A.,"Denver, CO",172,258,60

We knew that we'd have to wait for a table being that it was a holiday, but it was nice out so we figured why not. After waiting for 45 minutes the only 4 person table freed up and the hostess sat another group who'd been waiting less than us at the table. We confronted her about the situation and she didn't even try to apologize or correct the problem she had made. Finally after we made a scene of the situation she pushed two other tables together for us. Had she done her job correctly and looked at the list in front of her she would have seen that our reservation was next. The food was decent, but for the price we paid the service should have been the same. It was not up to par...",0,0,0,Katie B.,"Annapolis, MD",274,45,66
3.0,5/26/2014,"We stopped by here on a Sunday morning, and were very excited to try this place--as a brunch lover, I've heard nothing but praise for Sarabeth's! Our excitement only became amped when we got to experience a Lady Gaga (!!!) sighting as we walked into the restaurant. Apparently her apartment is right next to the restaurant!Upon sitting at a great table by the window, we ordered drinks. BF ordered a bloody mary and I ordered the five flowers mimosa. The bloody mary was HUGE, and was stacked with peppers, tomato and olives. It even came which a piece of shrimp, which was served awkwardly on a plate (not sure why it didn't just come with the drink?). The five flowers mimosa was DELICIOUS! Very light and a refreshing detour from the traditional plain OJ & champagne mimosa.The food was a different story, however. I ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict, which the menu stated would come with peppers and capers. BF ordered the regular eggs benedict. When they delivered our food, there were some discrepancies (mostly with mine, womp womp). My poached eggs didn't have that shiny, slightly wobbly, pearlescent nature of fresh poached eggs. Rather, they looked like they had been cooked or baked en masse. I understand this, since Sarabeth's must be serving 100+ poached eggs a day, but I would have hoped that they maintain quality despite this. Upon cutting into the egg, it was vastly overcooked. The yolk barely ran. Super, super disappointing. I then noticed that the plate looked somewhat lacking--no peppers or capers, as the menu stated. When I told our waitress about issue, she made a face and said that the dish didn't come with peppers and capers. She then offered to bring some instead. That interaction was kind of annoying--the last thing a customer wants is for the waitress to be making faces when they are just stating what is supposed to be included on the menu.In all, the meal was kind of a flop. I was hoping for the eggs benedict to be the ""eggs benedict of the gods"" that everyone says it is, but unfortunately it was overcooked and underwhelming. At least the mimosa was good. And it was cool to see Lady Gaga. But in all honesty, I'd rather just go downtown for brunch next time.",3,2,2,Anisha C.,"San Francisco, CA",405,159,33

I think they only offer tea service from 4 to 5 pm - but it is a great deal at ($30 including a glass of champagne) and people watching on Central Park South. The highlights were the savory dishes, but the desserts and scones were pretty tasty as well.

4.0,5/10/2014,"Charming little place right off of Central Park.  I went on a Friday morning and they were packed.  Luckily, as a solo diner, I was able to get a seat at the bar without a wait.  My seat was a little wobbly, which surprised me in a place that attracts a somewhat upscale clientele, but I made it work.  I also made the bathroom work - they are tiiiny and the doors swing outwards, so try not to take anyone out.  Minor inconveniences.Now on to the important part- the food.  I admit to not being a huge pancake fan, but I had heard so much about the lemon ricotta ones that I had to give it a shot - and they were some of the best I've had anywhere.  Light and fluffy with just the right amount of sweetness.  The side of bacon I ordered was perfectly crispy and delicious.  Too bad I had so much left over.  The portions are HUGE and I wish half orders had been an option - carrying leftovers around all day wasn't practical for me, so I had to leave some behind. Prices were on par with some of my favorite Atlanta brunch places - and I got more food here - so the sticker shock wasn't too bad.  The service was fine, but they are super busy, so figure out what you want and try not to waste their time.  ;)  I would go back for a couple of pancakes and maybe a hot chocolate.",0,0,0,Lauren R.,"Decatur, GA",11,68,0

The four flowers juice is amazing and I need to start making it at home.One of my companions ordered the eggs benedict and they were happy to sub avocado in place of the meat.

3.0,5/3/2014,"Sarabeth's Central Park South is known for its quintessental NYC brunch, for better or for worse. The mob outside every Sunday is frightening, and I would expect a long wait even with a reservation. That said, I think the Sarabeth's dinner is actually the better deal. The food is good and, while expensive, is more in line with what you would expect for a nice NYC dinner. The seafood cobb salad is particularly good. When I asked to split it with another member of my party, the chef expertly split all of the ingredients into two plates for no extra charge! The delicious biscuits that come with the meal are good as well. The good - seafood cobb salad (so good!) and tomato soup/grilled cheese combo (cheap and delicious).The bad - (1) The cookie plate, which is expensive and not remarkable in any way - in fact, the cookies are rather hard and dry. (2) The deviled eggs, which were actually bland and just not good. I didn't bother eating more than one.In short - nice location, pretty good food, but the brunch just isn't worth it in my opinion.

5.0,5/2/2014,"Amazing in everyway! The eggs benedict was to die for, and I would know because I grew up with a father who was a known San Diego chef. He would make us eggs benedict at home only once a year and it was melt in your mouth good. I compare all of the benedict I try to his, and since I just had his for our wedding brunch its fresh on my palette. Sarabeth's traditional eggs bene was fantastic, almost a 99%, just cant give it that 100% bc it didn't come from my dad! Also have the big and fluffy French toast and they were sooo good. split an order with my sister and we couldn't finish it but they were heavenly! Also the Four Flower juice, incredible! well worth the splurge for brunch. Fair warning brunch here is not cheap, but it very worth it for a special occasion! Would recommend this place to anyone.Only thing: our server started out very nice, very rush rush but nice. we had sat down and within seconds she was there asking us for our order and we told her we would need a couple of minutes. Within mins she was back, and once again we hadn't even looked at the menu so had to ask her to come back. Now let me set the stage... my sister and I were meeting for the first time in 29 years (that is my whole life) and a good chunk of hers, and we were taking each other in and asking a million questions. we didn't have time to look at the menu, we needed at least 10 mins to get ourselves together! I explained to our server the situation and she looked at us impatiently (welcome to NYC), I told her we would be there a while (we had photo albums to go through). We stayed for 2 hours and you could tell she was getting very irritated that we were HOGGING this table, although we were still ordering bubbly drink after bubbly drink. you would think she would be happy to make more money since each drink cost about as much as an entrée. but whatever! that's my only complain. This 5 star had nothing to do with that impatient server and everything to do with the food and atmosphere.

It was somewhat crowded (obviously bc New Yorkers love their brunch AND it's a tourist spot) but surprisingly still felt sunny and spacious inside. We made reservations and were seated right away.I ordered the gruyere cheese omelette and scone. It was simply perfection. I devoured that scone slathered with strawberry jam and clotted cream, no regrets. Their menu is great, hard to choose from. Next time I'm getting the lemon ricotta pancakes.The coffee was lukewarm. Only downside. Everything else was lovely. The atmosphere is crisp, inviting, and bright.

My friend ordered Jumbo Lump Crab Cake Sandwich which was also SO DELICIOUS!

The restaurant doesn't have much waiting space, but a small bar keeps you entertained. The restaurant is quite vast and has lots of seating, making wait time seem relatively shorter than at other restaurants. Being strategic, the three of us split three items. The spinach omelette was tasty, but not so different from other places. The stars of our meal were the almond crusted french toast and the eggs benedict . The benedict was pretty savory and melted together with the biscuit and hollandaise as expected. The almond crusted french toast was well worth it! Not too sweet, not two strong - perfectly balanced with nuts, fruit, powdered sugar with a dip of syrup. This is the brunch item to purchase. If you're looking for a nice combo for brunch, get the almond crusted french toast with a side of eggs. Coffee is pretty tasty - drink up.

I was bothered by the demeanor of the staff, but in their defense, they were overwhelmed by the early week, holiday weekend tourist crowd. Last time I dined at Sarabeth's (albeit a different location), I remember the menu being more expansive. This was not the case here. I was challenged to find something that sounded good. I opted for a fruit salad and the beet and burrata salad. The burrata was certainly the highlight. Each bite was like culinary cloud nine. The fruit salad was a bit tired, but that's no fault on the presentation so much as it is a reflection on the types of fruit they chose to serve. Bananas, strawberries, and citrus segments are fine and good, but I honestly wanted a greater variety of berries, or maybe some mellon for the price paid. Adam was happy with his caesar salad, and I nibbled on a crouton or two, and can at least attest to their deliciousness.",1,0,0,Alexandra K.,"NY, NY",307,917,57

My friend and I enjoyed our meals, though we felt rushed. Our server was nice and helpful, but my problem was that the food arrived what seemed like one minute after we ordered it.

My vegetable frittata was tasty, but it was served on a chilled plate as was my friend's poached egg.We both asked for the pumpkin muffin which was served cold. Very odd at such a pricey restaurant, but when we asked the waiter to heat them he seemed displeased and told us they don't serve their muffins warm. He then gave in and said he would try to heat them and returned shortly after cleverly finding a way to heat muffins in a restaurant. Not sure how he managed this task, but they were delicious.

4.0,2/7/2014,"I love brunch. A lot. So when my girlfriends and I were planning a trip to NYC for a bachelorette party, I had to suggest brunch at Sarabeth's. I had already heard great things about it, and it was recommended to me by some other friends as well.Unfortunately, they do not take reservations on weekends, so we had to put our name on a waiting list when we arrived. I can't vouch for if it was a hassle to get our name on the list because another girl decided to take charge of it while we waited to the side. Surprisingly, it only took us about 20-30 minutes to get our party of 8 seated - not too bad considering it was prime brunch time on a Saturday. We did happen to see a very handsome celebrity chef waiting in line as well - pretty cool! I ordered the Spinach and Goat Cheese Omelette (amazing) and their coffee (even more amazing). I got the pumpkin muffin with my meal, but it was just okay. But I didn't really mind because my omelette was just THAT good that I didn't even need the silly muffin. The cost does end up being a little pricey if you get a meal, coffee, and a mimosa (or two). The next time I visit, I am definitely going to try their pancakes. They looked awesome.The ambiance and decor is cozy and simple. We had a pretty good table in the house, so no complaints there. Overall, the service was good, prompt, and the waitress was there whenever we needed her. Our waitress also didn't mind taking pictures for us, even though the place was packed. One thing I do remember was that the bathroom wait was really, really long the entire time we were there.

We started off with the crabmeat guacamole which was an interesting twist but could have used more seasoning. My cucumber viper was light and refreshing. Other interesting specialty cocktails on the menu included the Sarah Palmer with my favorite sweet tea vodka and Salty Caramel. I had the scallops which were only four scallops that were not well seasoned with a mound of mashed potatoes which really overpowered the dish. I was particularly excited by the idea of braised leeks and fennel but couldn't really taste this because of the potatoes. I thought the dish lacked texture, crunch and a little acid to really elevate it. The ice cream sandwich dessert was nice way to end the meal, with flavones such as caramel and pistachio to satisfy anyone's sweet tooth. One negative was that though the restaurant was not that busy our meal was rushed by the waitstaff.

The food was good, but I was disappointed with their service. Here is what happened.... I checked my bank statement a few days after my visit I found the restaurant took $20 more than I intended to pay. They took sixty something dollars. I called the restaurant and asked for the manager. The manager asked for my name, last four digits of my credit card number, the time I visited the restaurant, and etc. She said she was going to investigate and get back to me. However, a couple days passed, no one from the restaurant contacted me. I went to Sarabeths website and wrote my complaint on the contact form, and then I got their Service Director's call the next day. It took at least 10 minutes for her to understand what happened. Afterwards, she emailed me the scan of the original signed copy of my receipt, and said the waiter mistakenly read my signature 4 as a 6, and then refunded 20 dollars. I am not pleased by the fact that it took more than a week to resolve this.

It's a very cute restaurant with a plain but inviting decor. It's well lit and not too noisy and perfect for brunch.I love that the tables were not pushed in tightly and we couldn't hear other table's conversions (a common issue at or regular brunch favorites). Our waitress was obviously very busy but also incredibly friendly and checked in on us regularly. She also made great recommendations.I had a Goldie Lox with a Pumpkin Seed muffin with preserves. I can't stress this enough: I would have waited two hours in that snow storm and it still would have been worth it. That's just how good it was. My other dinners would agree. The eggs were rich and fluffy anf the lox was not overpoweringly salty. The muffin was moist and the preserves, oh the preserves. One of my companions ended up purchasing a few jars to take home and gift after our meal.The meal was not cheap, but honestly not that overpriced for the quality. I'd definitely go back again and plan to.If you get the chance and aren't starving, this is definitely worth trying at least once.I took away a star for the fact that they don't implement any kind of system that notifies you when you're table is ready.

You can tell the restaurant gets a lot of traffic because it's in Midtown and it's right across the street from Central Park. This kind of thing transforms restaurant into ""bad service"" mode because there's really not much incentive to provide good service (or they think). Places like this get foot traffic regardless of how well they take care of their customers. I didn't necessarily get bad service, but asking for things (even asking where the bathrooms were) warrant an annoyed response. You know...that ""Man, you're really inconveniencing me"" attitude, even though it's their job to serve you.The food was pretty mediocre. I had the Farmer's Omelette and it wasn't done very well. The omelette didn't have a lot of flavor and the meal was lackluster. The prices don't reflect the quality of the food and were pretty high.Like I said, I haven't been to the West location, but if you're table to make the trek, I would try that location instead.

I think you can have a private party here because they have a private room.. When i was there i saw a large baby shower party ending.  So i came here at 3pm on a Sunday and we actually got a table really quick.  I got or mimosas and ordered our food. I ordered the popeye's eggs which is scrambled eggs on an english muffin, with Black Forest ham, and spinach.  This dish was ok, it wasn't too special,  and I was not wowed by this dish.  My friend ordered the Salmon Eggs benedict. This is a dish i would normally order but this time i didn't.  The eggs were ok, it wasn't as running as i normally like it and the salmon was really salty.  My other friend had the almond crusted french toast. I was disappointed in this dish because it didn't have much flavor to it and it was a little dry.  I would come back to this place mainly because i love the decor of this place and it's right next to central park.  It's a great place to come with your girlfriends on the weekends and the serve here is pretty good.  Def. will give this place a try the next time I'm back!",0,0,0,Belinda C.,"Millbrae, CA",279,800,3769

For another, Central Park South smells like horse poop and if you look close enough, you can see the sad looking horses dropping their load. Not exactly the thing to rev up my appetite. I can just imagine the smell, snaking through the air (cartoon like), seeping through the walls of the restaurant, before making it's final stop on my dish. Yes, I am prone to theatrics at times. This was a birthday dinner for a good friend so I had no choice in the matter. Barring the location, I did enjoy my slightly over-priced french toast. The rest of the girls also enjoyed their meal.

We were easily able to accommodate 10 people and the back room was quiet enough where for once I was able to speak with everyone at the birthday dinner. We started with the Tuna, Guacamole, and Calamari as appetizers. The seared tuna was my favorite and I loved how it was served with Terra chips. Guacamole is always a fan favorite, but their chips were far too delicate to arrange them in the dip, better served around the dip!As for the entrees, I think everyone was impressed. We were all served at the same time and everyone had a hot meal.

5.0,8/15/2013,"I think I am in love; apparently, the stars were aligned for my visit to Sarabeth's in NYC.  My friend and I arrived without a reservation around 10:00 AM on a beautiful Sunday summer morning, and yet we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table outside!  It was kismet.  We got a chance to check out the inside while we were waiting for our table.  The inside decor is really cool and upscale, but on such a beautiful day, our outside table was more than we could have asked for.Service was fine, except that our server spoke in such a quiet voice we couldn't really understand him and had to ask him to repeat himself several times.  I ordered the apple cinnamon French toast, which I will tell you now is the best French toast I have ever had EVER.  The title of the dish is a bit of a misnomer - while there were a few apples in the toast itself, most of the apples came in the form of apple preserves served alongside the bread.  No matter, it was absolutely delicious.  Now, the French toast was perfect by itself - with its crispy, buttery exterior and soft interior, I could have eaten it plain.  Add some of those apple preserves as well as the butter and maple syrup served on the side and you've got pure heaven.  The dish also had sliced banana on top, which seemed sort of out of place, but no complaints, as I like banana and just gobbled up the pieces by themselves.  At first glance, I was worried I'd be hungry (only 4 pieces of toast - 2 slices of bread cut in half - what can I say, I'm a breakfast glutton), but was totally satisfied upon eating every single last bite of that amazing plate.My friend had eggs scrambled with salmon and a croissant on the side.  She also got the drink special - some kind of champagne and fruit mimosa-like thing.  I didn't get a clear read on whether she loved her meal as much as I did mine, but I know we both really enjoyed our experience here.  When the hostess saw us trying to snap a picture of the two of us, she kindly offered to take a picture, indicating this was her ""favorite part of her job.""  Did I mention this place is right below Central Park?  Sunday brunch and a stroll in the park?  Can't be beat.",0,0,0,Jackie L.,"Everett, MA",45,55,1

The omelettes and french toast did look good, but I wasn't in the mood to spend $20 on breakfast on a random week day before work. I'm sorry. I can go to a diner or sbux and get the works for half the price. Also, it didn't open until 8am.

1.0,5/9/2013,"Jan 14th, 2012Officially my first disappointing pancake-review.While visiting family and friends in New York City this week, I decided to review pancakes at Sarabeth's on Central Park South. Having gone to Sarabeth's several times over the years -mainly for dinner - I figured it would be a great stop for my first NYC pancake review. Well, unfortunately, I was wrong.Sarabeth's is officially my first review of disappointing pancakes. While the menu itself has cute names for dishes, including the ""Baby Bear,"" ""Mama Bear,"" and ""Papa Bear,"" the creativity with its pancakes is for sure lacking.If you're only going to have two types of pancakes, both options HAVE to be amazing. While the dish looked pretty, its taste was abysmal.If I were blindfolded and had Eggo pancakes on one side, and Sarabeth's pancakes on the other, it's unfortunate to say that I wouldn't be able to tell them apart. If you're going to spend $15 for a pancake-breakfast, by no means should the food taste microwavable. Now, only because I've had dinner at Sarabeth's, I do not actually believe these are microwaveable pancakes - but they sure taste like 'em. There was no creativity whatsoever in this dish, except for the way they were stacked on the plate. My only positive comment is the strawberries tasted exceptionally fresh.And while this is not in reference to the pancakes, I found the staff to be quite stand-offish and snooty. Sarabeth's: my advice is to be a bit nicer to patrons paying these prices for underwhelming meals, and skip the sanctimonious attitude towards the girl who grew up down the street from your Central Park South location, and is blogging about your services.All in all this is, unfortunately, a pancake breakfast you can skip - unless of course you crave the memory of ready-made pancakes back from when you were a kid running late for school.",2,0,0,Vanessa F.,"Los Angeles, CA",302,73,98

We had 5:30 reservations ... 5:30!!! I often finish brunch around 5:30 so I must emphasize how uncrowded this restaurant was . We ordered a bottle of wine to dink over the next hour or so, salads, and a turkey burger to split. The turkey burger was actually quite delicious.However 1/4 of the bottle of wine gone and 3/4 of the french fries left, the waitress comes and puts here hands on the plate to take it. Excuse me ... I am not the type of girl who leaves a fry on a plate. You will know when I am done because there is nothing on the plate. The waitress could have at least asked, ""are you finished?"" before putting her fingers on my plate. Then, I kid you not, a bus boy came four times and the waitress another two to try and take the plate. Never asking, just presumptively putting their hands on the plate.  The ironic thing was, never did the waitress come and poor more wine in our glasses- we had to do it ourselves.

2.0,5/1/2013,"As I recount my latest experience at Sarabeth's Central Park South branch, all I can think is: ""What the heck happened?!"".  I'm a huge fan of Sarabeth's Tribeca branch, and the last time I was at this one (albeit, over a year ago) everything was fantastic.  The food, the service etc.  The only thing that this Sarabeth's had in common with the one I visited a year ago was the decor, which is upscale, beautiful and welcoming.To be fair, the hostess was able to seat a party of 7 on a busy Sunday within 25 minutes, which is a noteworthy achievement.  Our waiter seemed very nice (if not completely beleaguered) so this trip had that going for it.But man oh man...everything else was a mess.First the service was slow.  We had put in drink orders and an order of chips and guac before our regular food so we could have something to munch on.  It never came out until we inquired about it, and by that time our food had almost arrived.  We ate it quickly mostly because we were starving.  It was ""okay"", very middle of the road.Our food arrived and we all began to dive in greedily.  Then at one critical point, a waitress completely lost her mind and slammed open the kitchen door, *screamed* at someone in the kitchen, then slammed the door again and walked out with literally a look of ""I shall kill you"" written all over her face.  It was...intense to say the least.Amazingly, a half hour later she was still on duty serving tables, but looking like she was ready to take someone's eyeball out with a spoon.  It was unsettling.While most of us were eating, one of our friends noticed her pancakes hadn't arrived.  They came eventually, after most of us were halfway done with our dishes.  Very odd given that we all put our orders in at the same time.When the bill arrived, our collective eyes widened and brains exploded as we realized one of our friends had been charged $9 for two eggs.  Seriously.  Not an omelette, just the eggs themselves.  Pure highway robbery if you consider an omelette with something inside plus a scone (or muffin) is right under $18-19 in most cases.This was simply a thoroughly unpleasant experience.  It makes me sad because my previous time here had been so great.   I also think the price they charge for one lone egg is ridiculous.  I don't plan on dragging my friends back here any time soon.",3,0,1,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",393,1300,917

The omelet was even better with tabasco and ketchup. The muffin was likewise very good; while it looked dry, it was light and relatively moist, but had a very slight pumpkin flavor.  The muffin contained raisins and had flax seeds on top. Not usually a raisin and flax seed person, but the raisins worked well and the flax seeds added a nice crunch.2) farmers omelet (no cheese) and 7 grain toast - omelet came with ham, leeks, and potato pieces, and was quite delicious.  The toast was also tasty.While the food was great, however, the waiter was really rude and lowered our rating of the restaurant.  After seating us, the waiter asked us what kind of water we wanted and became very impatient and cocky when weren't able to answer him immediately. We also felt rushed to eat, as the servers and hostesses (understandably) seemed intent on turning the tables as quickly as possible to serve the other customers, so we didn't have a chance to really enjoy the brunch.  Nevertheless, decent place to eat a more gourmet (and somewhat pricier) brunch.",1,0,1,Marci C.,"Honolulu, HI",274,145,330

Here is a quick overview of my experiences:FOOD- The Split pea soup is phenomenal but the portion is way too small. I literally had to order two. - The almond crusted french toast is just ok (even though I salivated just reading it). It was a bummer because I love almonds AND french toast. The batter could have been slightly more sweetened. Tasted a little too eggy.- My friend loved the Cobb Salad.- Grapefruit mimosa was pretty good although I would have liked a little more champagne :-) Wouldn't kill them to have some kind of mimosa special either. SERVICE- Good. Nothing super personal or friendly but efficient. It gets pretty packed in there so I guess they are more focused on getting everyone fed than making anyone smile.GENERAL- It's a great place to go in that area since most places there are overpriced or stuffy. - Great location across the street from Central Park so tourists esp. love it.

3.0,1/22/2013,"Pricey brunches like Sarabeth's don't get much more touristy than this Central Park locale. The weekend crowds are going to consist of park visitors, people lining up for a photo op of the awning, guests of the nearby Ritz Carlton, or any of the old money New Yorkers who can afford to have a property facing CP.It's not all in the name - while I would prefer the UES / UWS locations, this CP sister location can hold its own. The small quaint interior gives off homey vibe and the seating isn't as cramped as it looks. Groups might have a tough time here, especially with the wait time. Dinner may be have more feasible options (If it's the latter, reservations are recommended).A classic eggs benedict with hollandaise will go for nearly $19. It comes with a choice of a (delicious) muffin or a scone or a crossaint. Want potatoes or and some type of breakfast meat with that? It'll only run you for another $15. A fully loaded breakfast is close to $35 and for some people, that's just absurd. If it is me, I'm always going for my mainstay of the goldie lox ($16), a whipped eggy concoction of cream cheese, smoked salmon, and a touch of scallion. It is creamy, airy, and consistently tasty. While I might debate the price tag and lack of quality sides, I can certainly vouch for its fluffy texture and notable presentation.Vegetable frittatas ($15) is my next best bet. They're almost pie-like, in the sense they don't exhibit the same brick like shape that plague most brunch frittatas. The combination of the asparagus, peppers, and chives are melted together by a blanket of gruyere that would make most cheese heads stir crazy.Ever paid $18 for pancakes or French toast? Not for buttermilk or lemon ricotta. Even the organic maple syrup and their pumpkin waffle feels right. It's all tasty, but not like Clinton Street or notable breakfast food from the boroughs. I typically see the children in the restaurant wolfing these down like no tomorrow. Do the kids really know the difference between these high priced flapjacks and stuffed French toast? Highly unlikely.And while price only says so much, it is the service that has lead to my dismay with this location. While I probably wouldn't be the friendliest man in the world having to deal with annoying tourists, I also know that establishments like this pride themselves in being able to provide the ultimate experience that keeps NYC a desirable destination for all. The eye rolling from order taking or the deep sighs from people asking about their place in line can probably be handled a little bit better (i.e. differently).Lastly, for anyone who decides to take on their outdoor seating during the better weather months, more power to you.

The highlights for me were the apricot preserves that i had to ask for (thanks fellow Yelpers for the heads up)  and the banana nut muffin. The food itself was nothing special and i thought the texture of the omelet was kind of weird.

You get a huge portion of burrata (fresh mozzarella cheese basically). The menu doesn't mention this but there are olives in it, too. The chicken duo consisted of a huge portion of chicken cooked to perfection. The roasted sweet potatoes on the side were fine. We also had the lobster roll. This was outstanding with lots and lots of lobster. I highly recommend this. The house made chips were good as was the cole slaw on the side. We had some OK wine by the glass; nothing to write home about. The wait staff was excellent. We had reservations and got to sit at a table right next to the front window.

3.0,12/12/2012,"This nice and clean midtown restaurant was ""nice and clean"", but nothing to rave about.  I came here for brunch.  The atmosphere was casual and sweet, but not too casual (I wouldn't go in sweat pants and a sweater unless it was early in the morning).  We sat down at about 12pm and got pretty busy around 1pm (something to be aware of if you're going for brunch).We came in, gave our reservation, and sat down.  Easy.  We looked at the menu, ordered a drink (hot apple cider, which was okay), and ordered our food:  Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict, Apple-wood Smoked Bacon, One Great Burger.Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict (Irish smoked salmon, Hollandaise sauce, chives):The Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict was not too shabby.  It was a pouched egg (which was cooked perfectly), on top of a reasonably sliced piece of smoked salmon, all of which placed nicely on a homemade English muffin/biscuit covered, but not smothered in Hollandaise sauce with a side of salad.  The smoked salmon and the pouched egg was a delicious combination, but not memorable.  You can definitely taste the smoked salmon.Apple-wood Smoked Bacon:The Apple-wood Smoked Bacon was not the best, but not the worst.  It was crispy, greasy, and bit overcooked.  I prefer my bacon to be thick, in between crispy and chewy, and perfectly cooked. One Great Burger (freshly ground turkey or sirloin, tomato, guacamole, grilled onions, brioche bun, and French fries):The One Great Burger was just another burger, but with better meat and bun.  I ordered the sirloin (medium-done).  The sirloin burger was nicely cooked and juicy, but smaller than you would expect a burger to be (about the size of a small grapefruit).  The french fries was golden (clean oil), crispy, and fresh.It was an expensive brunch (30-40pp), but overall it had a pleasant atmosphere.  Great for catching a light meal with friends, family and foes during the day.  I would come again to try other foods though.  I would recommend the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict.",0,0,0,Jonathan C.,"New York, NY",39,27,1

Let me preamble this by saying that this was the best brunch I've ever had. Though pricey yes, the food is superb. The eggs benedict dishes really didn't have to come with greens, but the bread they used for them was something spectacular, not your usual English muffin: soft and slightly chewy on the outside. The pumpkin waffle would have been even better with a tad more moisture, but surprisingly you can actually taste the pumpkin. My personal favorite was the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. I couldn't taste the Ricotta as much as the lemon, but oh soo fluffy! In addition to being very, very tasty, everything was presented tastefully. :) Service Review: Nothing in particular about the service. Venue Review: The restaurant itself is adorable.

Food-wise, everything was lukewarm and had clearly been prepared, plated and sat under a heat lamp until we ordered it. Our turkey was extremely dry. The courses came out quickly but many were incomplete, i.e. no bread after I asked several times for it, no coffee with dessert, and then no utensils to eat it with. I had to ask for things from kitchen staff cleaning up tables, as our two arguing waiters were no where to be found. Also, we had to let the staff know we weren't finished eating several times as they continuously tried to take our plates away. We felt extremely uncomfortable and rushed. Our waitress only came back to our table at the end of the meal to smile and let us know that our gratuity wasn't included.

Everything here is very overpriced. My Peach Mimosa was delicious, but at $12 I wasn't going to have more than 1. A simple glass of OJ will run you $7, so I do suggest at least putting some champagne in it for a few bucks more.I decided on the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes from all the rave reviews. They were good, but could have been better. I enjoyed the lemon flavor but didn't think the ricotta added anything to it. You couldn't taste it, and it just made the pancake a dense, almost raw-like texture that wasn't fluffy at all. The syrup was delicious, however. Other menu choices include simple offerings like omelets, eggs benedict, etc. all for around $15-$17.

Healthy servings of protein heavy breakfasts (for those ladies who have men who need big breakfasts). Yet, I was able to get a more modest sized plate as well. I ordered the Goldie Lox, which was scrambled/omelet style eggs with cream cheese and smoked salmon. I also had the choice of a bread item - I chose the pumpkin muffin (which was disappointing, because it was stale). They also gave a basket of sliced bread which was tasty with my omelet.Overall, everyone really enjoyed their egg breakfasts because it was a huge plate and they were made really well. However, the only turn off was the service, as they neglect you for pretty most of the breakfast since the restaurant is so big, it seems that all the workers are just running around like mad. So I felt like I was hailing a cab all the time to stop them to refill my drinks. Also, this restaurant is very pretty and girly, with a mint green touch all around the restaurant.

4.0,7/29/2012,"Taking my boyfriend (""The Guy"") around my old haunts from my time in NYC, brunch at Sarabeth's was pretty much mandatory. Usually I go to the one on the Upper West Side, but my review for this location would apply to that one as well. I don't know if we got particularly lucky this time around or if it's always been like this, but the service was so friendly and attentive, I almost thought the Guy had paid someone off. We barely had to wait for a table (we did go around 12:30pm, which is a bit early for a NYC brunch maybe), got a lovely table outside with a great view of Central Park South and the adorable foot traffic. Brunch itself was excellent--eggs benedict for me, apple cinnamon french toast for the Guy, basket of muffins to share. It was clearly too much food, but we were thinking with our stomachs, not our heads. One star off for my possibly irrational anger at the prices--I don't remember the eggs benedict being $18...yes, it's delicious, but I still thought the prices verged on absurd. It's a tough call, and I'd still pay it but it does add a little side-eye to the bill.",0,0,0,Darjeeling T.,"Washington, DC",2,81,1

We brought this to the servers attention, there was no genuine concern with a cosmetic apology thrown our way. Disgusted we left midway through the meal with complete loss of appetite.

1.0,7/14/2012,"July 7th 2012- A quick summary- poor service, rude wait staff, bland food, poor presentation. We came here 2 minutes before early dinner knowing that it is what we would like to order. By the time anybody came over, it was almost 10 minutes after we had been seated. When I asked for the early dinner menu, the waiter rolled his eyes saying it was too early. I pointed out the time, another eye. When he returned with the menus, he took our drink order. Another 10 minutes later, a server asked us if he could take our drink order. We told him we had already given it to our waiter and were waiting on drinks. He looked confused, said he would be right back, then returned saying he would now be our server. Never did find out what happened or see our original waiter again.  The food was nothing special. I ordered a seafood cobb salad that I was very exicted about after reading the menu- nothing to write home about, and the presentation was poorly done. The sandwich we ordered was also disappointing and poorly presented. For two people eating with only 1 alcoholic beverage and 2 pastries ordered, early dinner was $100.00. The pastries we ordered to bring back to our hotel were dry and flavorless (this place is supposedly known for pastries). We would not return and do not recommend this place to anyone- stick to other places nearby or nearby hotel restaurants which we had better experiences at and were closely matched in price-  including the Plaza Hotel.",1,0,0,Lola S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,150,19

Yes.The little garden in the middle of the restaurant is great ambiance and decor for the restaurant. The food is spectacular. From coffee to the pastries and everything in between. Coffee came out hot and freshly roasted with a strong coffee bean taste which i love. Omlettes were light, fluffy, french style. Start off with some home made granola with fresh fruit and berries and milk. Eggs Benedict came out with the perfect poached eggs and a tasty hollandaise sauce.

Unfortunately it fell short in the taste dept and I only ended up eating half. The pancakes were on the dry side and there was ZERO lemon taste. One would think the addition of ricotta would result in moist and fluffy pancakes but it did not happen with mine.  Anyhow the hubs ended up ordering a Papa Bear cereal/hot porridge. It came with some freshly cut fruit toppings and some honey which he finished up quickly. Not something I'd order however he really enjoyed it rather than ordering his usual Eggs Benedict type dish.The restaurant consisted of suits at lunch meetings discussing business deals, NY fashion girls, some tourists and lunching mothers and their privileged private school attending daughters with their Chanel-clad grandmama from an affluent neighborhood all brunching harmoniously under one roof.

I struggle between giving it 4 or 5 stars however I think it leans towards 5 unless they fail me when we revisit. Service: We made a reservation and were maybe 15 minutes early. Had to wait for our table for about 5 minutes which I found reasonable. We weren't especially demanding to be honest but in any case the wait staff was helpful. Food: Because we wanted to be healthy and walked over 20 blocks to this restaurants and were going for another walk in Central Park afterwards, we decided to award ourselves with a bottle of Proseco, which was awesome. The bottle wasn't chilled enough when it was first served but the ice bucket helped. I had the lox scramble with pumpkin muffin and my husband an omelette (I forgot what) with rye bread. I didn't know eggs could be sooo good. My lox scramble was beautifully done, perhaps cream cheese is the secret. His omelette was also good though I preferred my scramble. The pumpkin muffin was out of the world - I need to find that recipe.

Without a fuss, her mother took her plate and showed it to her server. The server brought over a new plate, but obviously she didn't have an appetite after a huge bug crawled out of her food.

The broccoli was also finely ground it seemed. So it only had specs of broccoli as opposed to chunks. The pumpkin muffin had less flavor than the pumpkin loaf you can find at your local Starbucks.

It is a  very large restaurant yet still manages to be jam packed on a typical Sunday morning, but on a Wednesday morning, it isn't crowded at all. I am not sure if the menu had changed, but I remember getting cinnamon French toast, and they did not have it on the menu. I really am not a fan of this menu today. They have good ideas for food, but then they add either cheese or sour cream, which really doesn't go with a breakfast. I ended up going with the classic fat and fluffy French toast with strawberries, which was delectable. They were incredibly fluffy, and combined with their maple syrup, it was to die for. I do however wish there was another flavor on top of the syrup, and the taste eventually got old by the end of the meal. Maybe if they added apples to the dish, it would have gotten that zing of an Apple taste, in addition to the nice taste of French toast.

3.0,12/13/2011,"I decided to have breakfast at Sarabeth's at the recommendation of a friend who, quite frequently, finds herself in the city on business. My decision to try Sarabeth's was also influenced by the fact that I was staying at the Essex House,  mere steps away from its location. Extremely convenient.In the beginning of September, Central Park is stunning, and sitting on the front outside patio--located right on Central Park South-- to behold the gorgeous view was a no-brainer. We were promptly seated around 11am, provided menus and served good, strong cups of coffee. The coffee really hit the spot, and the wait staff ensured throughout our entire visit that our cups remained filled. Under their menu header ""Extraordinary Eggs and Omeletes,"" I opted to try the Vegetable Frittata. The frittata contained asparagus, red and yellow peppers, chives and gruyere cheese. It also came with a choice of bread, and I happened to be in the mood for a bran muffin. Unfortunately, the frittata was bland and unmemorable. For almost $16, I was expecting a kick-ass frittata; instead, I received something that was very sad and that was lacking personality. For the four of us at the table, the check came close to $100. While the service was efficient and attentive, the food itself was nowhere near worth the amount of money we spent.

My only regret is that I can't oder everything on the menu - I'm always so torn between what to eat. With that said, here are some of my absolute favorites:- Smoked Salmon Benedict - an absolute favorite and a must have for me. The hollandaise sauce goes great with the delicious lox and beautifully poached egg.- Buttermilk Pancakes :) I love pancakes and these hit the spot for me. A little bit of putter and syrup and some of the fresh strawberries on top yumm.- Lemon and Ricotta Pancakes - I was always intrigued by this dish and finally got the chance to order it and wasn't disappointed. The hint of lemon is a great addition to the already flavorful pancakes - definitely a must try.- French toast (both versions) - French toast to me is the ultimate breakfast. Its a great combination of flavors. To me it's like eggs and pancakes (bread) got married and formed this delicious food. You then top it with great quality syrup, fresh berries and bananas (if they have) and let's not forget the addition of nuts .... right there is the ultimate breakfast in my opinion. - Tomato Soup - I have yet to find a tomato soup that tastes better than this one. Some have come close but never has anything been equal or topped the deliciousness of this soup. There have been plenty time when I ordered this soup, knowing I wouldn't come close to finishing it, just to get a spoonful.The dishes are a bit pricey but what would you expect given the location.

Having been here years ago for brunch, I remembered the long long wait and delicious baked goods and was very excited to try something more savory.The wait for dinner outside was 10 minutes (there was no wait for the inside) around 7PM on a sunday- not bad. I was very excited to try the Chicken Pot Pie and to get some cool summer breeze in the outdoor dining area. My boyfriend got the proscuitto pizza. I would have to say that the food fell below my expectations, although it didn't necessarily mean it was bad. Tasty and refreshing, the pot pie and pizza was satisfying (yet overpriced- eh that's Manhattan for ya) My pot pie was creamy and hearty while my bf's pizza was light and refreshing (although there were only specks of proscuitto- not very much at all)We got a strawberry shortcake dessert to end the night- it too was OK- it didn't blow me away.I would say three stars would be pretty accurate in terms of price, food and service. The servers are very sporadic with their attentiveness (we felt rushed for a bit when my bf had not even finished his pizza and was asked twice if his plate could be taken away and then we were ignored when we were ready to pay and leave) and the food is tasty but nothing too spectacular.I'd stick with the brunch!",1,0,0,Melissa L.,"Jacksonville, FL",306,109,0

The table I was seated at was loud and when asked to move locations she was unaccommodating and unaware.

We ordered the almond crusted French toast and Farmer's omelette with a pumpkin muffin. The French toast was good, but definitely nothing special. The omelette was also ok but have had better. The reason I give no stars for food is because I'm convinced the food was not prepared fresh or to order. We sat down, were given 2 minutes to order before brunch ends (4pm) and our food came out 5 minutes later, no joke! One plate was ""warm"" while the other was cold. Now I'm no physicist but I don't believe food can be prepared/cooked/appear in such time and with varying plate temperatures without something fishy going on.

But the waiter on the other hand....I arrived with one friend this past saturday and was seated promptly. Everyone from the hostess to the busboys were courteous and helpful with a positive attitude. Our waiter, however, came over to the table, interrupted our conversation, announced the special mimosa of the day or whatever, and said simply ""Will you be having that today?"" Umm, no.I ordered my soup along with a 'five flowers juice.' He felt the need to correct me with 'four flowers' as if I were an insolent schoolchild, without even looking me in the eye. Next he moves on to my friend, who orders an omelette and asks if it is possible to get whole wheat toast. He does not answer, does not look her in the eye, and simply barks the words 'seven grain'. Then he disappears, brings back coffee which she ordered, and when he moves towards my cup and I try to remind him that I did not order coffee he barks ""I know"" before removing the cup (when he was clearly about to pour it). As my friend asks whether the container on the table holds milk or cream, he simply ignores her and walks off. He does not return until the end of our meal. We have to flag down another waiter (who actually seemed quite kind and professional), to ask for a refill of her coffee.At the end of the meal he returns, smiles, and asks if everything was good with our meal. What was he smoking?  We left him a 10% tip and left. Such a shame. I will repeat that the rest of their staff was just lovely. But owning a service business myself, I cannot abide that kind of treatment. And I feel compelled to yelp about it, because as a business owner I would hope that my own customers would do the same.

I stick with ice water and black coffee, which is filled and refilled very quickly and often. In fact, the service provided by our waiter and other runners from the kitchen is unparalleled. Sarabeth's gave us the best service of all the restaurants we visit over the weekend, and that's saying something.Eggs sound good, so I opt for the Green and White: scrambled eggs with scallions and cream cheese. They come out in a simple, lumpy mass of pale yellow and green. The scallions are pretty mild, which I appreciate, and the cream cheese is used sparsely but proportioned well to add a luxurious mouth feel and sweetness. It's nice, but nothing fancy.On the side, I order the Banana Nut Muffin, which is large and not too dry. It tastes a bit more savory than I expect. Again, nothing to write home about; I've had better. The coffee helps wash it down. Of particular note, however, are the pork sausages with apricot. Judging from the menu, we expect the apricot to be inside the pork sausage. Instead, the links arrive in a pool of apricot jam...which is perfectly fine by me. The fatty meat goes very well with the slightly tart but sweet fruit. I'm definitely trying this at home!Despite crying kids and tiresome business types in discussion nearby, the experience is solid. Service is fantastic. Food is good but maybe too simple? I'm not particularly impressed with their Sunday brunch offerings; it all feels like I've eaten it before elsewhere, and perhaps prepared with more inspiration. A quick glance at their online lunch and dinner menus reveals dishes that look a bit more creative. Maybe we'll hit Sarabeth's for a different meal next time?Don't take my word for it, though.

After all, you're inside and can't see the park or anything. I could have been anywhere by a train station and had the same thing.I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and my cousin did too. The served 4 or 5 (I don't remember which) palm-side pancakes, fairly thick. The photo from someone else is a good representation. A few berries, some powered sugar, some syrup and flavorless butter. So for $16, that comes to $4 or so per pancake. Honestly, totally not worth it. I barely tasted any lemon or had the feeling of ricotta. I really felt like the syrup was just any old thing, and the butter was standard fare with no particular flavor. I really felt I could have gotten the same experience from any other diner. Maybe not Denny's, but just about anywhere else.The waitstaff was nice and let us chill even though there were people waiting. That's nicer than they had to be.But really. This food does not seem worth it. And I left hungry. I bought 4 slices of pizza afterward and felt pretty good with an average of $20 for 4 pancakes and 4 slices of pizza.

The young bartender was very friendly and he and other members of the staff chatted me up about a lot of great restaurants to try. They were very helpful. The world is tiny. A young lady server mentioned that she'd just moved to New York from Chicago and recommended some great Indian food not far away.  I settled in and ordered the Red Omelette with egg whites, topped with chives and sour cream along with a bran muffin and cup of decaf black coffee.  The food was decent and came quick, which was great in helping me stay on schedule.

Lobster roll -  Mmmmm...huge pieces of lobster on delicious bread, with some yummy coleslaw on the side. Mac and cheese - Hearty goodness.

4.0,12/24/2010,"I am not a fan of walking... ever, but after seeing/hearing good reviews for SB, I was stoked to go. We made a reservation for brunch which I recommend that you do since it can get pretty packed. I absolutely love the decor of SB. Its baby blues, white, zebra prints,and shabby chic furniture made me fall in love with SB. It took quite a bit of time for our server to come back for us. We ordered the Goldie Lox and French toast. The Goldie Lox ($14.50) is a blend of eggs, salmon, and cream cheese. That combo is pretty amazing, but I wished that they had blended the cream cheese more throughout the eggs. There were chunks of cream cheese in more places than others. I can't handle that much cream cheese in one bite. The French toast ($16) was pretty awesome. It was light, crunchy in the right places,and very flavorful without syrup. I'm not sure it's worth the $16 price tag. I'm sure there are cheaper options for French toast around the area. Our server took awhile to deliver us the check, and when she did drop it off, she didn't acknowledge us or anything. Rude with a capital R. Overall, I dig SB.

And it's deep on the list as far as dinner places to try (and that list is amazingly long, considering how long we've lived here). So, as noted - this is based on weekend brunch. Be prepared to wait as it's usually packed on the weekend at least. In nice weather there is outdoor seating, and they maintain two lists so you need to decide if you'd rather eat in or out. No first table open. There is also a small 5 or 6 seat bar that you can eat at. We've done outside and the bar. Oddly, we had the same waiter both times. Excellent, though. Very attentive and personable. Can't remember his name unfortunately. But it's nice (and probably as you should expect from someone behind a bar) to have someone that can work quickly and still engage the customers in small talk. Excellent service and quick turnaround. Constantly refilled the juice at the bar, which was unexpected as they didn't charge extra. You know how that usually goes. I've tried the pancakes as well as the scrambled eggs and ham on an english muffin. Both meals were outstanding. Eggs were made perfectly. Fluffy but not TOO fluffy. Not buttery at all. Ham was wonderfully flavored, and as you'd hope, it was a REAL English muffin not Thomas' (which are good mind you, but not what a nice establishment should be serving).

To say it was delicious is an understatement. Amazing pumpkin salad with goat cheese, Spanish onion and figs (insert drool here). The unexpected crunch of pumpkin seeds only served to improved the dish. At the end of that wild ride, I figured they couldn't really top this. Then they brought out the triple threat - aka the triple dip. Pumpkin, white bean, and beetroot. 3 piles of color and health just waiting to be spread on . . .  a homemade potato chip?

I think our weight was about an hour long since someone had some come early and put their name down. The menu and cocktail menu looked great. I think next time I would try a cocktail. I had a hard time deciding whether I wanted to eat breakfast or eat lunch for brunch. Since some people were ordering the breakfast items I was thinking about, I decided to order lunch and go with the crab cake sandwich with a side salad and fries. The sandwich was SO good. The crab cake was really meaty and didn't seem to have any fillers in their crab cake which a lot of people do. The fries were hot, crispy, and had just enough salt. I snuck some bites of the pumpkin waffle and the lemon ricotta pancake and those were both absolutely delicious. The pumpkin waffle was really flavorful and the lemon ricotta pancakes were so fully, and had just enough lemon flavoring to them.

5.0,6/17/2010,"i still say with strong conviction that Sarabeth's has the best eggs benedict in new york, out of the places i've tried thus far, which is quite a few. this particular location is definitely a tourist trap, given the price and its location, but each time i've gone, i never leave disappointed but rather grinning from having enjoyed a perfect brunch. it's solid and it's a place where you're guaranteed a good meal. the wait doesn't seem too bad because you can wait around the bar drinking their fantastic bloody mary's. the decor is feminine and their ambiance is vibrant, perhaps because it's 75% tourist. it's definitely not cheap and may not be worth the wait if these two components matter, but otherwise, it's a staple new york brunch spot that deserves a visit!",0,0,0,Jasmine L.,"New York, NY",62,62,2

3.0,5/24/2010,"I know this review was long-due and I probably ordered the wrong stuff while I was there, because while I normally don't order crab cake for breakfast nor brunch, this time I did. I came here about a month ago and somehow I probably was in the mood for some seafood at brunch hour. The normal me would order omelette or something with egg, but somehow I managed to say jumbo crab cake instead.I must say, the crab cake was fried too long, because the crumbs were so hard. The fries were fine, but the crab cake just made me lose my appetite, I barely could eat it. My friends' orders of Classic egg benedict and Popeye Omelette even looked better. I just wished I had ordered those instead of my crab cake. Oh well...I had reserved for 11am, however, we didn't get seated until 11.30ish, so that was a bit of a bummer. Table service were pretty good, very attentive. Would I come back here? Not so sure, I probably want to try some other brunch places nearby.

3.0,2/25/2010,"A few years back, a friend suggested Sarabeth's for Sunday brunch. My friends and I didn't wind up going that time, but the name stuck in my head as someplace I'd eventually like to visit for breakfast/brunch. So, on a late Monday morning, knowing we'd likely miss the weekend craziness I've read about, we set out for a nice little breakfast there.The space is deceivingly large - or maybe 'long' is the best description. It looks tiny from the outside but it keeps going and going and going as you walk through it. It has a certain charm, but not a very comforting one, to be honest. Despite the hyper-pleasant staff, we didn't feel particularly welcome there at all.Despite that, we started with two coffees and ordered the Popeye Eggs (scrambled eggs with spinach and ham on an english muffin) and a bowl of 'Papa Bear' porridge (with bananas, raisins, cream and honey) to share. Both were very tasty. One of my pet peeves is overcooked eggs, but they were cooked near perfectly. The porridge was hearty and the honey and cream served with it were perfect compliments to it. The portions were relative to the prices, which is always good in NYC. The $4.50 cup of coffee was a bit crazy though.Here's my problem with the place. Relating back to that feeling of not being quite comfortable, the check came and 18% gratuity was already added on. I normally have no problem with this, so long as it's a large party. But there were two of us and on the menu it says that 18% will be added for parties of six or more. So naturally, I was kind of offended by this. First off, I've worked in the restaurant industry for 8 years. I may not be wearing Chanel (as the salary of a bartender and English teacher doesn't lend itself to that), but I know how to tip. I often overtip by a lot. Mediocre service gets 20%.Let me clarify that it wasn't that I didn't think that we got 18% worth of service - our server was attentive, pleasant, and quick. It was just the act of assuming we wouldn't tip that made me feel judged, as if the waiter was going to squeak as much out of my Target-wearing ass as possible. I considered not giving him the extra to reach 20%, but my pride got the best of me. I wanted to prove a point, so I tacked a few more dollars on. The funny thing is that he probably would have gotten even more if he didn't add it on. Maybe it's a policy that I missed, but if so, it should be stated on the menu instead of what they have on there now. I felt rather patronized.All in all, decent food and good service marred by a haughty, slightly sterile, hotel-esque atmosphere. I doubt I'll be returning.",0,0,0,Ian S.,"Port Jervis, NY",37,163,1

It was packed for brunch and we were crammed in at one of those two tops stacked between other diners. Service was quick and they were timely with coffee refills and turning over tables. I had the farmer's omelet with ham, leeks, potatoes and Gruyere. My wife had the garden omelet with egg whites, broccoli, corn, carrots and goat cheese. They were both good, but not spectacular. We had a side of the three pepper home fries, which were great. The English muffin was really good and they have a nice raspberry/strawberry jam that went well with it. I had my brekkie fix satisfied. But, the price was quite steep for not having any bloodies or mimosas. When lunch with a pitcher of brews is less expensive, something is wrong.

The lemon ricotta pancakes are light and fluffy. They use lemon zest to flavor them and there is no need for syrup as they are plenty sweet without being overwhelming.Probably my favorite thing on the breakfast menu is the garden omelet. The veggies are finely diced and the cheese is oozing out the center. It is rather large so sharing is always a good idea. Most of the breakfast items come with some kind of pastry, which can leave something to be desired. What makes it so much better are the preserves. Sarabeth's preserves are delicious. My favorite is the raspberry. It could probably make an old sock appetizing. To top it all off, have a mimosa.

3.0,11/16/2009,"This was for a brunch on Saturday.Crazy.  The line was out the door, despite having a waiting area up front. No reservations accepted. The hostess was polite and busy... they wouldn't seat us (a group of three) unless we were all there. A little annoying, but not bad. Bigger space than you think, although only one small unisex bathroom in the back... a sealed garden area for light for the above apartments, too.  Outside seating can be spotty in the rain, even with a covering. That being said, once being seated, there's the brunch menu and the drinks that people order... all kinds of juice colors with alcohol, basically, although they do still serve tea and coffee.The crowd here is slightly up-scale, midtown kind of folk. You won't find the lower crust of Manhattan here... prices are too high for a simple brunch for that.   That being said, for anyone who can afford living in Manhattan's midtown, this isn't an expensive brunch (around $25-30 a person after drinks).Food here is good, though.The Popeyes is a wonderful ham, egg, and cheese sandwich, and the Salmon Benedict is a tasty mix of greens & artery-clogging buttery Hollandaise sauce over eggs on English muffin. The french toast also looked delicious, but didn't get a chance to try that, or the other information.Service was spottier than normal... probably due to the busy morning? They tried to clear my plate three times before I finished my eggs.Portions are a decent size, though.  It's cozy... small space, and forget about it if you're in a wheel chair.

In fact, I was pleased to see several families with children- granted they were all ""j-crewish families"", but nevertheless, some of the men wore jeans, and i got by with sneakers. Despite the reviews on having ""long waits"", my friend and I were seated immediately. Our waitress was really down-to-earth and friendly. What I love most about Sarabeth's is that they offer their traditional brunch menu EVERYDAY from 8am till 3.00pm. The prices are quite reasonable as well- expect to spend about $20 including tax and tip. Execution is almost flawless for all the brunch items that i've tried- from the eggs benedict to the sweet breakfasts. Portions are large- and you will leave feeling stuffed from just having one dish. I would have given this place 5 stars...but my only disappointment is that they do not serve freshly squeezed juice. I don't think this place is over-rated at all- it depends on the occasion. This certainly isn't a casual, ""roll out of bed"" with friends hungover brunch spot, but it's cute and cozy - ideal for a date or when the family is in town.",2,0,0,Annabel A.,"New York, NY",47,161,0

It's equally as good when prepared at home and is a nice reminder of a good experience at Sarabeth's.  The lemon ricotta pancakes had lots of lemon flavor and were perfectly fluffy without being too dry. The pumpkin muffin studded with raisins and topped with sunflower seeds could have been a hearty meal in itself.

I swore to my companion that the next one to do that was going to feel my wrath.Ooops....nothing to do with the restaurant...sorry.A nice relaxing cup of tea and a sweet would be just perfect but where to find that in the midtown area that is not overly noisy and crowded and Starbuckish. Lovely on Central Park South (how chic am I?) is Sarabeth's. We were so nicely greeted and seated with a charming young waiter. And yes, he said, we could just have a cup of tea althought they serve a full afternoon tea with an assortment of tiny tea sandwiches and sweets, My eye surveyed the dessert menu and settled for cheesecake with my tea.  Tea is tea...and nicely served in short period of time. The cheesecake,, while nicely presented was just about ordinary.Now I know it is Central Park but since when does one piece of cheesecake and two cups of tea come to $20? Hmmm....But then again, other places in the area charge more. I know that these places have a big rent...but honestly....tea is hot water and a tea bag. Nothing exotic as served in Japanese tea houses. Earl Gray  tea...earl gray...hmmm...I wonder how much they would charge for Lipton's.

Everything sounds great but not perfect, and, disappointingly, what comes on the plate isn't anything more scrumptious than it sounds on the menu. I believe Sarabeth's keeps their entrance crowded on purpose. When we were seated, the host was still telling other couples it would be a 40 minute wait.

I was also intrigued by their four flowers juice - basically a special blend of orange, pineapple, banana and pomegranate but that wasn't anything too fantastic. I think I was just curious.They have a strict reservation policy and were incapable of accomodating group size changes. We needed to add seats to the pre-assigned table but they were pretty unaccomodating about that. Not sure if it's because they do not have spare chairs or were just plain unhelpful. I imagine every restaurant ALWAYS has spare chairs and tables where not all chairs are in use. We were able to fix the issue after quite a wait.

Often there is a long wait for brunch on the weekends between 10 am and 2 pm. Brunch food is terrific. The Apple-Cinnamon French Toast with Bananas is very very good, and not too rich to finish the whole thing. The Lemon Ricotta pancakes melt in your mouth, but probably a little rich to finish the whole plate. The basket of muffins that you can order to share with others is a great idea and they serve it with preserves and jam. Very tasty. Thumbs up from friends who have had the eggs benedict (served on an english muffin-style muffin that is very thick), as well as the ""porridge"", which is oatmeal. Atmosphere is very nice and beautiful decor. Old fashioned black and white large photographs on the walls and lovely place settings. Not a place to wear shorts and a tee-shirt. Cost was pretty reasonable for a delicious brunch but was ~$30/person (entree, share of muffins and glass of OJ or coffee). So the food is great. Why 4 star and not 5 star? The service could be better (one time we waited for forever to order and receive our meal and our waiter hardly ever came by; the other time, she was pretty prompt and apologetic but didn't ""think ahead"" as to what we might need - like having the water person refill our glasses more frequently). Secondly, the wait is frustrating as they do not take reservations. However, we went for brunch with 5 people on a Sunday at about 11:15 and only had to wait a brief time (~15min) and when our entire party arrived we were seated immediately.

Also: bus boy spilled water all over the table, partially on my mom, obtaining coffee refills was like pulling teeth, dad had to wait entirely too long for Tabasco sauce after the waitress forgot to bring it with his omelet, the place is uber-touristy and too large for a decent brunch place (feels like a major tourist attraction), the bathrooms are inadequate (2 stalls for a large restaurant) and there is nowhere to wait for them without being continually elbowed and pushed by staff.My goat cheese and spinach omelet was actually pretty OK; they definitely didn't skimp with the omelet add-ins. The omelet itself was huge; for an extra $2.50 you can make it an all-egg-white omelet (which I forgot to ask for but didn't mind too much because yolks are sort of delicious, if slightly less healthy).

1.0,7/1/2008,"I ate here last night and it was one of the poorest meals I have ever experienced. I've been a vegetarian for over 20 years and in that time I can hardly ever remember a restaurant which made less effort to accommodate my (not particularly unusual) diet.There were two main dishes on last night which I could potentially have eaten; risotto, which I don't like, and pasta, which I wasn't in the mood for. What else, I asked the waiter, was available? ""Nothing, just what's on the menu"". Interesting response, and not one I associate with a quality restaurant. I had the mushroom soup, which was nothing special, and a spinach salad which was covered in a dressing so cloyingly sweet as to make it inedible, to my palate at least.I decided not to risk a dessert when I heard the waiter tell another diner that none of the desserts were prepared on the premises but were all bought in. To add amusement to the end of the meal, the Glenfiddich I ordered instead came in a champagne flute instead of the proper glass. All in all, not a very good experience. There is something about coming away from a restaurant hungry (having only eaten a plate of soup) that seems an almost unique sort of insult. I haven't experienced such poor eating for many years. It's unlikely I personally will ever be back, but it may be that  I can spare other diners the waste of time and resources that I experienced last night.After I complained to the management by email I received an apology; it appears there are vegetarian dishes and we were unlucky to get a waiter who did not tell us of this. Hats off to the management for responding quickly to the complaint, but even so, my one star review of this place still stands.",2,2,0,John M.,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",4,83,0
2.0,5/15/2008,"This is one of those atrocious places intended specifically for people that talk about work over their meal and expense it: they don't need to taste a thing, and don't care what they pay.The creme brulee is mickey mouse: a kid's porridge with a thick caramelized coating. What's more, the waiter was terrible. Stocky blond guy. He never once met eyes with me and always set my food down on the other side of the table (I was alone). Even when I reached my hand out to take something -- a glass, a menu -- he'd set it down across from me and walk quickly away.It's the first time I ever tipped exactly zero.The wine selection is decent if you don't mind buying by the bottle.

2.0,4/19/2008,We went there for brunch. The food was overpriced and nothing really special. The place was packed. Distance between tables was very close and we could barely walk in to our table.

3.0,4/14/2008,"I've been to the Sarabeth's on the UES, and I like that one better purely because there's usually not much of a wait.  I waited about an hour this time, and my party of 5 was seated in a cute little nook that was slightly separated from the rest of the restaurant.I ordered coffee (which came with lots of grinds) and the salmon eggs benedict.  They were ultra-speedy - we had our food within 10 minutes of ordering.  My dish was ok, with the only thing special about it being the extraordinarily thick ""english muffin"" that the eggs was perched on.  The dish came with salad instead of home fries - better for my health, but I would have preferred the potatoes.  My table also split the lemon ricotta pancakes which where fluffy and zesty.Overall, a decent brunch place.  I think that it's a little expensive though - I understand that it's Central Park South, but seriously, $8.50 for tomato soup?",1,0,1,Sonia C.,"Jupiter, FL",408,864,61

3.0,2/28/2008,"This place is tourist central on the weekends, which is the only time I ever make it, so that alone pretty much ruins it for me. If you want to enjoy the fabulous brunch sans tourists, head to the location on Amsterdam--all locals and the food is much better, in my opinion.This location is always a brunch scene with families, socialites and of course, said tourists. I love the granola and yogurt (it's huge) and their omlettes are always delish, but a bit pricey for something that you can get anywhere else. Their mimosas are liquid cocaine--i dont know what else they put in them besides champagne and O.J., but they are intoxicating to the second power. I always leave Sarabeths and go run about 20 errands I am so wound up. Atypical after brunch behavior, if I say so myself. Overall, I love this place but I will still to my Sarabeths on the UWS.

4.0,2/4/2008,"I'm more often than not disappointed by brunch places.  Just how special can you make eggs and toast and potatoes?  Not very, unless you're talking about Jane.But, Sarabeth's is all about the non-egg things.  Take the Almond Crusted French Toast.  Fat hunks of artisan bread dipped in eggy goodness, generously coated in crunchy sliced almonds, pan-fried to a delicious golden hue, and drizzled with raspberry sauce.  It's served with maple syrup that seems like it's not sweet enough until you realize the purposely subtle flavor enhances the dish's textures and lets you enjoy the carby wonder for what it is.My party of six arrived at 10AM on a Sunday, waited about 25-30 minutes, and was treated fairly horribly by our server.  Granted we were rather disheveled and far more underdressed than the rest of the clientele since we had just run a race in Central Park, but the rudeness was still undeserved.  We each made out with an entree and a juice for about 25$.Despite the poor service, I'd return for the French Toast.  It's been awhile since I've been so enamored with a food item...",1,0,0,Deborah H.,"Boston, MA",246,720,0

2.0,1/17/2008,"This used to be my favorite Brunch place. I loved the Pumpkin Waffles and the Sausage with Apple Sauce. Of course, the central Central Park South location is surely icing on the cake. However, something must have shifted because my recent visits have been disappointing.1. My all time favorite Pumpkin Waffle was served colder than room temperature, which really ruined it for me. 2. I made the mistake to order the Turkey Burger which was not only dry, but unbelievably flavorless. Most $7.99 diner burgers can beat it.3. FLIES - however cute or cozy a place it, flies will kill it. Did I mention I was seated indoor? 4. When a friend of mine asked for a little more raspberry sauce for her french toast (she really enjoyed the french toast by the way), the waiter said they do not have the sauce in small cups or dishes. How lazy does a waiter have to be if he is not willing to lift up a bottle of raspberry sauce and pour it into a little dish? For the prices they charge, you really deserve much better service.5. The place is getting old. I thought it was chic but now it's just dingy. They need to clean, repaint, and re-upholster the furniture. I know we're going into recession but still.....I would only go back if I ever have a severe physical craving for the pumpkin waffles and the apple sauce sausages.",2,0,0,Nina S.,"New York, NY",0,20,0
4.0,12/10/2007,great little brunch spot. i've heard its always crowded which i guess you have to expect from a place that serves yummy food. so come prepared to wait for a bit. and if the weather sucks...the wait could really suck...it appeared that most of the waiting is done out in the street. however the staff was very accomodating. they immediately recognized that we were going to go into withdrawal if they didn't serve us a drink promptly. they catered to our medicinally required need for alcohol and let us stand next to the bar inside while we waited for food. once we sat down we were treated to fantastic eggs benedict w/ PERFECTLY prepared eggs. the dish was a real treat. perfectly runny eggs. hollandaise that was out of this world. the apricot sausage was very tasty. and while the drinks were expensive...that and we drank a lot. the brunch prices were reasonable $10-$15. i'll be back...,1,0,1,ben h.,"Austin, TX",15,130,0

Armed with my recommendation from the fab Melissa W., I am sure it will not take that long, and I manage to convince my hubs to wait it out. Sure enough, we were seated in about 35 minutes. Our table was way in the back, so we didn't have to fight for elbow space with all the folks still waiting for their tables. I had the Goldilocks: scrambled eggs with smoked salmon and cream cheese, and a pumpkin muffin. I think it was a 5-egg scramble it was so big, and I couldn't even finish it! Yum.

1.0,11/21/2007,"I mean... why? Why would you eat here?My frittata was not frittata. It was pale scrambled eggs with little tiny bits of things chopped up in it. Like they had been food processed into a fine dice. Aren't frittati rustic? Shouldn't the veggies have had a rougher dice/slice? And the eggs had this kind of microwaved (or perhaps convection oven-ed?) feel to them. Not at all like a pan-fried, broiler finished frittata.My server was nice, but he couldn't hear a word I said over the tourists giggling about going to the MoSex after they finished shopping and the babies who were screaming because they were with their mothers and not their nannies this weekend, and they think their nannies are their mothers because they spend so much more time with them.I liked my marmalade.

4.0,7/2/2007,"Sarabeth's has been on my list to try for a while now since it's so hyped up. I always seem skeptical about the hyped up places. First of all, the hostess annoyed me. Her eye makeup was way too smudged and dark and it looked like she got trampled over the night before and stumbled into work. She was snippy and snooty and rude. We had a table of 5, and after 1 hour of waiting, we were ready, however our 2 friends were about 5 min away, literally. She insisted that we give our spot away, and said ""Sorry, too bad. you just have to wait"". I wanted to shake her. She pissed me off.After that ordeal, we got seated finally and proceeded to have a pretty good experience. I was told that this location is less crowded than the one on the west side, which is good.  I really enjoyed the food.Goldilocks- scrambled eggs with smoked salmon and cream cheese.. it was delicious. The crab cakes were also very decadent on thick english muffins. The apple Cinnamon french toast was unmemorable, and the farmer's omelet was decent at its best. Scones were dry and Pumpkin Muffin was gross.  The juice was overpriced ($5.50 for OJ) and Coffee was $3.50.  What really saved them was the impeccable service believe it or not. The waitress was always very helpful friendly and efficient. Food came out quickly and with a smile.

When I pointed out that he spilled half of it, he replaced the other half with WATER. So I flagged over another waitress and asked for a replacement. It still didn't taste like the original ... they did however, leave it off the bill.

I was still getting over the fact that we didn't have to wait when the Perkiest Waitress Ever (PWE for short) came over to give us our menus. I am definitely a fan of prompt service, but I needed some coffee in order to handle this girl. Thankfully, she quickly brought over a pot. I love brunch because plenty of breakfast food by definition is gluten-free, and it is extremely hard to screw up eggs. That is, unless you are IHOP, and you put PANCAKE BATTER in the omelettes. Seriously?Anyway, PWE listened intently to my dietary restrictions, smiling and saying ""great! super!"" a lot, but I should really change that nickname to Most Competent Waitress Ever because she totally understood. With that, I ordered a cheese omelette, substituting greens for the side of toast. My friend and I also split a fruit bowl. Everything was great. They did not screw up the eggs.

3.0,11/11/2005,"The decor is a bit of a misfire - zebra prints, chandeliers, and wall sconces suggest the designer was schizophrenic - and prices, in keeping with the Central Park South location, are considerably higher than at the other locations, but the high quality for which this mini-chain is known is very much in evidence. Whether or not it's worth the price tag it carries remains to be seen. The menu is filled with old favorites like chicken pot pie, grilled salmon, braised short ribs, and rack of lamb, but there's no more on your plate here than at Sarabeth's West, yet - depending upon what you order - your tab could be $20 per person higher, if not more. The way I see it, comfort food should be comfortably priced, and I'm willing to travel uptown for the same food if it's going to cost me that much less. In deference to the swanky surroundings, the bakery - with all its tempting take-out goodies - has been displaced by a bar, and if you'd rather indulge your sweet tooth than have a drink, that's another good reason to go to West 80th Street instead.",5,3,4,Gourmet G.,"San Francisco, CA",99,2099,2099
