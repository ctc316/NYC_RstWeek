3.0,3/29/2019,"We anticipated a fabulous and authentic Italian meal, and it was almost that - the service was very good, selections unique, wine very good (a northern Italian white) - BUT, 2 of my 3 friends were served a completely different entree than they ordered.  We were on a short timeline due to an evening engagement and when we brought it to the attention of the server, he seemed to just hope we would accept it as is.  I insisted on a compensation of some kind, such as another bottle of wine; after consulting the Mgr we did receive same.   It's in an old hotel, beautiful decor, murals of naked nymphs and flowers all over.  Definitely old school on Central Park.",0,0,0,Nancy D.,"East Lansing, MI",0,5,0
1.0,3/11/2019,"When I lived in the UWS 5 years ago, my husband and I used to come here regularly. It's the perfect little date spot - beautiful atmosphere, great drinks, nice food, and wonderful service. It's also conveniently located 3 blocks away from Lincoln Center, so we'd often come here right before a show. Last night, we went back for the first time in a while, and we were excited to revisit our favorite place before catching an opera. The hostess was lovely and took our coats, and we were seated at a quaint table in the back which was very private and perfect for a romantic evening. Perhaps our expectations were too high, but it all went downhill from there.We each ordered Manhattans to start. While the drink was lovely, it had bright red maraschino cherries. This is an upscale Italian restaurant, where are the amarena or luxardo cherries in my $17 cocktail?A server brought us a light bite to start - fried risotto balls with peas and something mysterious. These were basically bland fried balls that weren't worth the calories. My husband ordered the citrus fennel salad and lamb ragu pappardelle, both of which were specials. His salad was fine, the ingredients were fresh and the grapefruit wedges were a nice touch. The lamb ragu was a very sad dish; a plastic looking noodle situation with bits of lamb that honestly looked (and tasted?) like dog food. Very beige and unappetizing, and so, so bland. I ordered the grilled octopus salad and the bucatini with sardines.  The octopus was tender and beautifully presented over ribbons of celery. It tasted like nothing. The bucatini was cooked perfectly al dente, but was covered in bread crumbs and tasted like it had been cooked in bad fish oil. Again, bland! No one offered fresh pepper for the entrees and there was none on the table. Also, our spoons were replaced with knives before our pasta came, and I had to struggle to eat the long noodles without splattering all over my white dress. Sigh. If we didn't have to rush out for our opera, I would have asked the waitress to bring a spoon. She, however, did not check on us once the food was brought to our table. I finally flagged her down to pay the check, and she seemed both shocked and offended that we were rushing out. As she took the check away, it was the bartender who approached and noticed that we were struggling to enjoy our meal. He patiently explained the Sicilian way of cooking that involves less garlic. Okay, duly noted. That said, I'm not the first person on this forum to tell you that your food is bland. They should probably read some of these more recent reviews that concur. As we were apologized to multiple times on our way out, they also suggested we come back another time to give them another chance. There really is no incentive to spend money here because they did nothing to fix the problem in the present moment. Apologies and underwhelming promises to be better in the future are a sad way to run a business.",0,0,0,Nadine C.,"Washington, DC",33,157,154

2.0,2/10/2019,"This place was terribly underwhelming. The food was sub par, which was disappointing, I mean it is hard to do a bad job with pasta... but man. Overpriced for what we ordered. Our waiter seemed to be in a big hurry and we felt rushed overall- which was really unnecessary given the number of empty tables around us. This place gets two stars because the dessert we ordered was pretty good. The nutella mouse with banana gelato. The ambience was fair with one guy playing the jazz guitar.

2.0,2/7/2019,Not so bad that it was painful but overall disappointing. Had the same experience a few years ago but thought I would give it a try again given I live next door. Nice ambience but that's it. Service not great and food underwhelming. The pasta dishes were too heavy and lacked flavor. Everything had the aftertaste of bad oil. Nothing to do with authentic Italian cuisine. Prices are too high for the quality. I am sure there are neighborhood places that serve better food at half the price.,0,0,0,Joe H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0

1.0,2/4/2019,"Decided to give the much talked about winter restaurant week a try at New York over the weekend! ..@theleopardnycWell, we're mighty disappointed at the quantity of the portion given to us but I guess that's what these dollar restaurants normally do. Reduce the portion size and call it a ""restaurant week"". We had to infact fill our tummies with two whole donuts from a really good donut place nearby coz guess what ""dessert"" ain't included in the pre-fixed restaurant week menu or as they call it ""NYCRW"". ..Highly recommend not to try this place out; guys, spend your money elsewhere and you would have a lesser hole in your pocket and tummies happier. Yes, you would expect the food to be delicious when the restaurant is highly recommended but what we had was absolutely flavourless and stale..Also, the presentation was a huge turnoff, I mean this is not what we expect from restaurants that are highly rated on ""Yelp"" or whatever they may call it. .The place was extremely crowded and cramped up and noisy and not worthy to be a called a 4 star place .Thanks for giving us a slap on the face in the name of ""restaurant week"" and treating us like people who have come for free food. ..To top it off, they also asked us to leave as soon as we finished when we were just booking our Uber but we were asked to vacate our seats. Do not expect this highly rude behavior from a top class restaurant as this one. .Thanks for treating us this way. We are definitely not coming back and also not recommending this place to anyone. .#whatashame #nycrestaurantweek #italian #restaurantweek #winterrestaurantweek #winter #slapintheface #badfood #bad #leopard #njfoodblogger #nycfoodblogger #bad #slapintheface #expensive #foodblogger #provemewrongP.C: the live jazz person took more breaks than he was playing so it seemed like the sad atmosphere of the place also got to him.

1.0,12/25/2018,"Priced for superlatives but delivering tuxedoed mediocrity.  Crab cakes were fried hockey pucks.  Lobster ravioli - ringing in the New Year at $35 - were flavorless and desiccated - perhaps inspired by the ""Best of the Dead Sea"" recipe book.  This was of course the beloved destination cultivated by George Lang.  He died of Alzheimer's and tonight's experience is better off similarly forgotten.",0,0,0,Adam H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,2,0
4.0,12/2/2018,"A friend of mine was in town for her birthday to come see an opera with me at The Met and we decided we should do this whole thing RIGHT and get a fancy dinner beforehand. After some brief Yelp-research, we landed on The Leopard as exactly the right choice for all of that - though, not gonna lie, the clincher was absolutely their dessert menu.We made a reservation and managed to be about a half hour late because the MTA hates America but I called them in a moment of cell signal to give them a heads up and they were very nice about holding our place. By the time we arrived I think the only table left was out back by the bathrooms, which was a bummer in as much as we didn't get to see much of 'des Artistes' (the place is covered in rather pretty murals of nude ladies hangin' out) but it was intimate and still a nice dining area. Service was excellent, we had more than enough time to spare for our opera (arrived around 6:30, opera at 8) and even without informing them of our plans the food came out quickly and with time to spare (we skipped appetizers). The food itself was nice, we got a veal ragu special and the bucatini ""alle Sarde"" (with sardines, wild fennel, red pepper, garlic, pine nuts and raisins), both of which were tasty but, gotta be honest, I've had better at a lower price point. But I get that you're paying for the atmosphere and whatnot so it was fine. However the real standouts here, and what I would come for again in a heartbeat, were the drinks and the desserts. For dessert we got the ""Tropical symphony"" (crumbled praline layered with cream, mango and passion fruit) which was light, airy and delicious, as well as the nutella chocolate mousse with hazelnut crunch and banana gelato - the later of which was far heavier and HEAVENLY. That banana gelato tho... goddamn. Then for drinks we got were outstanding too but I can't seem to find a drink menu on here so they will have to go nameless cause I can't remember the darn names off the top of my head. Sorry Yelp, I failed you. BUT ALL OF THAT SAID, if I could see a menu again I'd remember in an instance cause they were amazingly good.

That's when I realized that the two $15 glasses of Nero d'Avola that I ordered with my entré were instead served as two $32 glasses of Barbaresco. So basically this place tries to ""trick"" you to squeeze some money out of the unsuspecting. I'm not too concerned since I took the extra cost right out of the tip. Way to run a business folks.

4.0,4/24/2018,"I came to The Leopard on Saturday night with my husband. We had reservations and were delighted to learn that our table was ready as soon as we came in despite the restaurant obviously being very busy.  The staff was incredibly courteous and the restaurant is absolutely beautiful. The manager even told us the story of the paintings of the restaurant. Our dinner was delicious and the drink I ordered was very strong. It also came out very fast which was lucky for us since we had tickets to the opera that night.Unfortunately I can't give the restaurant five stars. This is an expensive restaurant. We paid almost $200 for two people and that was not including wine.  The reason I removed one star is because when I order a special for $60 I expect the plating to be superb. I expect to have a plate that looks as good as it tastes. Although the food tasted absolutely delicious, was very filling, and the portion sizes were surprisingly large, the plating was not beautiful. I've plated prettier plates at home. I was sad about that since the aesthetic charm is part of why I go out to eat.  However, I would definitely dine here again and definitely recommend it.",2,0,1,Tal D.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,51,8
4.0,4/15/2018,"3rd time, & have enjoyed each time with some warnings. there is definitely a pecking order, so if not known, will be seated at a cramped table, regulars get the better tables. prices are, in many cases, unjustifiably high. i personally think $17/martini, $14 for a flute of a simple ""trevisol"" prosecco is ridiculous; as is $80 for a 2013 la Giribaldina Barbera d'Asti Superiore Nizza Cala Delle Mandrie DOCG, available RETAIL $28 - this IS a barbera, not a barolo or a barbaresco = ~ 3x mark-up over retail - v. - the norm 3x restaurant mark-up over WHOLESALE, of course that may no longer be the case, due to many restaurants taking advantage - buyer beware.   $24 for the ""special"" appetizer of burrata on 2 small radicchio leaves + some ""heirloom"" (?) grape tomatoes ridiculous! main course, the 24-or-32oz (?) ribeye with rosemary french fries & tomato/basil tart $104 - high, but not as bad as the appetizer special, or the wine/cocktail prices.in conclusion, i enjoy this restaurant, but wish their prices were less egregious! i do GET IT - the murals, the upscale clientele, Hotel des Artistes, but......",1,0,1,Jay G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0

We generally try restaurants during restaurant week looking for places we can add to our usual rotation. This has been the case on countless occasions but at the Leopard our experience confirmed that this restaurant won't make the cut. The food was okay, however, it was really the service that sealed the deal. Once the waiter found out we were ordering from the Restaurant Week menu, he treated us as though we had leprosy. We ordered drinks and a bottle wine, but I guess that wasn't good enough. The topper was when the coat check girl brought our coats to the table to encourage us to leave.

1.0,12/14/2017,"My wife and I decide to try this restaurant for our special anniversary dinner given the high ratings. We were there with our 2 year old son and had a very unpleasant experience on two accounts: i) While we were having dinner, the Maitre'd came up and told us that our son is making too much noise and others are getting bothered by it. I thought this was rude since there was equal if not more noise emanating from loud conversations from other tables as well. Although in all fairness, the Maitre'd mentioned this in a respectable manner but nevertheless, I think it was rude to say this in the first place.ii) The Maitre'd placed the check on the table as soon as I had taken the last bite from my dinner entree, and my wife had not even finished dinner and was trying to put our son to sleep! I had not even asked for the check and to place the check on the table without even offering desserts  was quite disrespectful!! This led to a very bad and humiliating end to an evening that me and my wife wanted to actually celebrate!The food was ok, and in fact we were quite happy with the service as well, the waitstaff was nice and respectful until these shocking incidents!!. These incidents I think are unimaginable in hospitality business and especially at a reasonably upscale restaurant. These were not nice and left us feeling disrespected and humiliated on an evening we wanted to just go out and celebrate. I hope the restaurant looks into this issue and does not act in such disrespectful manner towards other customers.

3.0,12/3/2017,"I've long awaited and highly anticipated my visit to the Leopard at des Artistes. It makes me sad to give it less than a stellar review.Let's start with the positives. Amazing staff and service. Polite, professional and attentive. From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed and well taken care of. The interior is elegant with warm woods, streamlined furniture and decor, and beautiful murals. There's live music for weekend brunch and a guitarist was playing soft, soothing music - love that the music was low enough that you could still have a conversation and not even have to raise your voice. Loved our round table that seated the seven of us.The one and only glaring negative - the food. I realize that you sometimes cannot judge a restaurant by its brunch - but brunch is easy and if you can't get brunch right, then there's no incentive for me to come back and try dinner. I ordered the simplest of things - the eggs Benedict. When the plate came, I had to stop myself from saying ""that's it?"" It was tiny - as in microscopic. As in there were two poached egg yolks - no whites - just the yolks - on a sliver of prosciutto and tiny piece of bread (the kind you would use to make Bruschetta) - it was practically a wafer, so small you couldn't even see it under the yolk. I've been ordering eggs Benedict for a long time and it is almost always served on two hearty pieces of an English muffin. Hollandaise sauce was disappointing and it was all served a bit too cold. Four tiny pieces of overly salted and overly herbed potato completed this dish. It should be served as an appetizer, not as a $17 breakfast plate. Water served for my tea was also not hot enough. It's too bad the food didn't match the other positive aspects of the restaurant - I had had high hopes for it.",6,1,3,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",992,902,770

I have rarely had such a good experience dining out in New York. The wine list is extensive and has some very well priced options. My friend and I had a wonderful Barbera d'Asti for only $80.On to the food... it is fantastic. My friend and I split a lobster risotto which was excellent. I had a grilled branzino which was excellently grilled. My friend had a duck breast which was one of the most decadent, yet delicious dishes I have ever tried. For dessert, you must have the beignets stuff with hazelnut custard and glass of port. Trust me. You won't be disappointed. The waitstaff is also super helpful and knowledgeable about the dishes. We had one of the best, funniest waiters I have ever met in New York.The one downside is that when you make a reservation you still have to wait upwards of half an hour for a table to actually open up.

3.0,8/15/2017,"Came here for restaurant week but ended up ordering a la carte because none of the RW courses looked appetizing.We got the meat and cheese platter, carbonara pasta and one other pasta I can't remember the name of (but it was a simple meat based sauce). The meat and cheese platter was delicious, but both pastas were undercooked -- at least a few minutes before al dente so the noodles were still hard. I could've gotten past that, but my main issue was the overloaded salt in both dishes. Neither of us could finish more than half because it was so salty. We opted against dessert and left pretty quickly after that.I would really give this place 2 stars based on the food, but giving an extra star for the great service.

5.0,7/12/2017,"About a year ago, I became interested in dry aged beef. I voraciously read everything I could find on the subject. Knowledge is power, or so they say. During my tutorial, so to speak, I came across a series of slideshows under the heading Steakcraft. In those slideshows, Nick Solares, a New York Magazine journalist, went to various New York restaurants, not necessarily Steakhouses and photographed chefs, fabricating dry aged steaks and ultimately preparing them in various ways. One slideshow documented his visit to the Leopard. Based on what I saw, I was determined to go, so on my wife's birthday this year, the three of us, son included, paid the Leopard a visit.I must say that our family has a long history with where the Leopard can be found. The space housed my parent's favorite restaurant Cafe des Artistes. They were treated like royalty there and were loyal patrons for thirty plus years. It was in that space that I learned a great deal of what I know about fine dining and hospitality. It was a grand, opulent setting that made you feel good to be alive. Well executed food, wine and service in a beautiful space can do that. My parents were crushed when the old place closed.We arrived for a six pm reservation. Greeted cordially, we were led to a very private table in the back of the restaurant near a very cozy bar. Gone is the opulent splendor of Cafe. But the nude murals remain and the restaurant felt very comfortable. We ordered a Barbaresco Riserva 2011 San Giuliano, which was very fairly priced. The three of us split the meat and cheese board. A variety of cured meats. Cheese. I depise cheese. But we all found something to our liking.Service was wonderful. No one was snooty, our needs were taken care of in fine fashion.Enough fooling around. My son and I split the 32 oz or so dry aged ribeye. The steak was brought out whole on a wooden cutting board and presented to the table. It was then sliced tableside into thick slices. The bone got its own plate! Respect. A magnificent presentation. The steak was served with frites and a basil tomato tart. The ribeye was as wonderful as I hoped it would be. A great crust and deep character due to aging. The frites and tart were great accompaniments.My wife had a traditional Sicilian couscous with shellfish ragout, served in a skillet. She loved every bite of it. Very thoughtfully prepared, loaded with fine seafood redolent of saffron. Who could ask for more?We found some room for dessert. Nutella chocolate mousse and Limoncello semifreddo. Very tasty with good coffee and double espresso.Like I say, all great meals must end eventually. But we'll be back to this gem. Until then..",4,2,2,David B.,"Berkeley Heights, NJ",62,446,326
4.0,7/6/2017,"Bit pricey, but great spot to splurge a bit on decadent Italian.Came here as a date night with my best friend, and she had suggested we come here.Venue: quite cozy interior, though a little dark for my liking (they dimmed the lights further later in the evening).  Luckily we had a spot near the main room l such that we didn't feel so isolated (like some seats near the kitchen / bathroom) but not so close that it was too busy.  Loved the murals on the walls since they gave the restaurant a more antique feel to it.Service: very impressed by how attentive the staff were.  They would walk by to see when we were finished with our dishes before coming up and asking if we wanted to clear them.  I liked that they didn't rush things (maybe because my friend and I were having a much needed catch-up), but we didn't feel like service was slow either.  They would explain the dishes again as they were served.  Their recommendations were pretty good menu-wise, especially since they asked a lot of questions on what you were feeling like having (how hungry you are, how diverse range of food you wanted to try, what you should order as a main if you order one thing as an appetizer).  I also did a wine pairing with my meal ($30) and the GM was very good at picking whites and a red to match the food we ordered.Food: not a lot of fru-fru, but lot of flavors going on.  Note that my friend asked to share everything and the staff split the portions in half for us.-- Grilled octopus with heart of escarole salad, celery, olives, pickled onions, extra virgin olive oil and lemon dressing ($19) - octopus was cooked right (thank god), and the salad was quite light.  Good clean and refreshing course to start with given our somewhat heavy dishes later on-- ""Grano Saraceno"" (wild buckwheat) fettucine with cherry tomatoes and basil sauce ($28) - one of two recommendations in terms of pasta (besides the Busiate Trapanesi); I love how the buckwheat gives the pasta a bit of bite and texture.  Tomato sauce was simple but flavorful.  Even a half sized portion was a bit on the larger size for my liking, but maybe I just have a smaller stomach-- Traditional Sicilian couscous with shellfish ragout, served in a skillet ($36) - another highly recommended dish, the couscous wasn't dry and seafood was cooked well.  The shellfish ragout was quite delicious and wish there were more of it!-- Pan-seared duck breast ""porchetta"" with fennel pollen, cipollini with aged balsamic vinegar, pickled raisins and vegetable caponata ($42) - had to cut some of the extra fat from the duck (not the biggest fan of fat) but juicy and tender nevertheless.  The balsamic vinegar reduction married well with the rich duck, and the raisins gave the a touch of sweetness.  A bit rich of a dish; not sure if I would have been able to eat a whole portion of it even without appetizers.-- Lemon and limoncello semifreddo ($15) - light and creamy with a great hit of acid to refresh the palette after a heavy dinner.  This was recommended out of all non-chocolate desserts.Excluding drinks, the meal came out to around $70 per person, more than I expected.  Not pulling-a-tooth-out-of-this-world expensive, but enough that it might take you by surprise.  Love the food, ambiance, and service here, but definitely need to go in knowing I'm gonna splurge a bit when I visit next!",2,2,3,Audrey H.,"San Francisco, CA",367,194,612

2.0,5/4/2017,"UPDATE:  Discovered through my research that the Maitre D' in question was actually the GM.  Very Disappointing.Visited The Leopard yesterday evening for a later dinner with my love. Was running a bit behind from the gym so he waited at the bar until I arrived. Upon arrival I encountered the Maître D', said good evening and asked him to direct me to the bar. Although this has been a longtime favorite of my guy, this was my first time dining there and I didn't know where the bar was. Without saying good evening to me, the Maître D' demanded to know if I had a reservation, to which I replied yes but that my partner was already seated at the bar awaiting my arrival. Instead of directing me to the bar, he then asked what was the name on the reservation. I told him, and it was then that he waved lazily to his left, I'm assuming in an effort to ""direct"" me towards the bar. Luckily, there were many servers up the short steps towards the bar so I was pointed in the right direction. The exchange earlier left me to be believe that perhaps reservations necessary to be seated in the bar area, otherwise I'm not sure why asking if I had reservations was more important that greeting me politely.All that aside, met my man at the bar and we traversed back to the front to get our table. Encountered the Maître D' again who asked my man if he wanted to check his laptop bag into coat check, yet neglected to ask me the same for my gym bag. We were seated and went thru the wine selection while the MaÎtre D' hovered to suggest a bottle for us. Meanwhile, my duffle was in plain sight and still he did not ask if I wanted to place it in coat check. That said, I found his ""service"" exclusionary, which is VERY off putting.Our server was great, and took the time to go thru the specials and answered any questions we had regarding the menu. We decided to start with the minestrone soup, and for our main course my man had the ravioli, while I had the risotto with mussels and caviar. I must say, the food was delicious, though my encounter with the Maître D' marred the overall experience and we weren't able to fully enjoy which was disappointing.Suggestion: treat all of your guests with the same courtesy regardless of age, gender, race, perceived socioeconomic status, etc. No one should ever have to wonder if they are or aren't being treated in a certain fashion due to who they are. Lastly, I must know; are reservations required to be seated at the bar?",1,0,0,Tamika M.,"Manhattan, NY",42,9,0

I can say without doubt that the quality, consistency, incredibly romantic ambiance, innovative food and amazing service leaves nothing to be desired.  Not often we find a restaurant can provide those consistent levels of service year after year! We were warmly greeted the evening of our anniversary, which fell on a cold snowy day on the Upper West Side.  Our waiter, Valentino,  guided us through the menu and was very helpful in providing us just the right amount of detail to insure our  dining experience was exceptional    The beet salad and warm octopus salads were phenomenal starters   The lamb chops and pasta carbonara are not to be missed as entrées    There is an impressive wine selection and the wine  we chose, Cala dele Mandre - 2012 Barbera D'asti,  was  a delight and paired well with our meals.  As the desert my wife ordered the  Zabaglione with fresh berries  that was prepared tableside.   The zabaglione rested on a plate that had the words ""Happy Anniversary"" written in chocolate on the rim.  The manager, George,  checked with us throughout the meal to ensure we had everything we needed at any moment we might need it,  without being intrusive.  The staff genuinely seems proud of their restaurant and the fine Italian cuisine they are preparing.   This is one of our favorite restaurants in the country and we do not hesitate on recommending it to anyone whether they be a permanent New York resident or just visiting New York for one day  Look forward to our next return to New York City and our next meal at the Leopard.

5.0,2/12/2017,"I want to preface this by reminding everyone of The First Rule of Restaurant Week: Never judge the restaurant based on Restaurant Week. Let's be real-- Restaurant Week is for college students (I know this because as a college student, I freakin' loved it.) Restaurant Week means more crowded dining rooms, ruder patrons, worse service, worse menus, and poorer experiences overall. This is scientific fact, people. If you are thinking about trying out The Leopard for your next romantic meal (NOT during Restaurant Week), please, please PLEASE do it. Obviously make sure your wallet can handle it.. prices are not for the faint of heart. But if you're looking for a special experience, this place will not disappoint.My husband and I came here after a matinee show at The Met. We loved the setting and the context-- the restaurant is located in an old, historic apartment building overlooking Central Park called Des Artistes that was originally built as a co-op for -- you guessed it! -- artists. Norman Rockwell lived here once upon a time! Coolness factor = 10/10. Upon entering the dining room, you immediately notice the gorgeous murals of naked nymphs frolicking all over the walls. This is not a collection of pretty prints-- this is ORIGINAL artwork made for this space some 80-90-odd years ago. Incredible right?We received impeccable service from the moment we stepped in. Pleasant, knowledgeable, unintrusive wait staff are weirdly hard to come by these days and much appreciated! We ordered a bottle of red and let the ambiance swallow us whole. (One quick note about the crowd that so many others cared to comment on-- yes, we were probably the youngest people in there by about 20-25 years, but WHO CARES? Nobody was obnoxious... shouldn't that matter more?) Everything we ordered was delicious and cooked properly-- the burrata special, the grilled octopus, the ravioli special, the flat pasta dish with wild game and mushrooms-- all phenomenal. For dessert we got gelato that was just average as far as gelato goes, but then again, even average gelato is scrumptious. My double espresso shot was pulled correctly and had a nice thick crema upon arrival... a good indicator of attention to detail in the kitchen.Despite all of this, it's hard to say we'll be back anytime soon... it was, after all, an extremely expensive meal.

3.0,2/12/2017,"As others have written, we thought the  gorgeous murals were the best thing about The Leopard. The service was very good.At first we were a little insulted to be seated all the way in the back of the 1st level corridor, next to the kitchen exit.  But later we were relieved to be sitting there because when we went through the more beautiful part of the place on the 2nd level, we found that it was terribly overheated, crowded and very noisy. We went during restaurant week.  While the menu sounded very interesting,  the food was certainly OK but we had hoped to be wowed. There were some interesting flavors and textures, but all the dishes seemed to lack a spark of seasoning.Don't give any credibility to  the reviewer who wrote: ""Restaurant Week means more crowded dining rooms, ruder patrons, worse service, worse menus, and poorer experiences overall.

The first course was good, artichoke salad and delicious bruschette over greens. She had the orecchiette, which left something to be desired. The pasta was fresh and firm, very nice, but the overall taste of the dish was somewhat bland. I had the cuttlefish stuffed with mussels and bread crumbs, which I enjoyed. Fish was very tender and less chewy than it often is. Desserts were probably the highlight of the night - gelati and fresh donuts were spectacular.

The best thing about it arethe wonderful murals of nude wood nymphs by Howard Chandler Christy that still grace the walls.  The restaurant opened in 1917, designed for the residents of the Hotel des Artistes, since the apartments lacked kitchens. Artists such as Marcel Duchamp, Norman Rockwell, Isadora Duncan and Rudolph Valentino were patrons. The food we chose was a Restaurant Week menu featuring food from Puglia. Touching the bread which was not even room temperature, it was REFRIGERATOR COLD was a bad introduction.  I had a chickpea and pasta soup, quite nice and my husband had the salad with (supposedly) artichokes over frisée and garnished with pecorino cheese. Except the artichokes were MIA. He eventually found two slivers that were 1/4 inch thick. We both had the roasted leg of lamb in red wine reduction. Very tasty but one slice and it was 1/8 of an inch thick. A nice $46. Montelpulciano went well with our food. Service was Ok, felt rushed at the beginning, then we had trouble getting the check.  Table next to us inquired about the cuttlefish and the waiter said he could not explain what it was and proceeded to give her the word in Spanish, not helpful to the poor woman.Ambience noise: high Not a great experience, but hey, you get what you pay for.",0,1,0,Yvonne C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,31,0

I was in town for my daughter's conservatory auditions, and we had tickets for her first opera at the Met...so it was a special evening. We got our tickets last minute so we were in a rush to find a restaurant that could accommodate us on a Friday night when there were MANY events going on in the area. The Leopard at des Artistes popped up on Yelp and we decided to give it a try...and it was a wonderful choice. The interior is a bit old-time classy but the impeccable service was also ""old-time"" (i.e. polished yet unobtrusive). They made us feel classy and comfortable at the same time. The waiter suggested a lovely prosecco for me, and a fresh Italian soda for her, since we were celebrating the completion of my daughter's auditions. These were the perfect mood bubbly way to start our evening. I have a garlic allergy, yet I really enjoy Italian food and many northern Italian dishes are not garlic-centric. After asking the type of food I like, the waiter made suggestions for what could be made without the garlic and when unsure on one item, asked the chef. All the dishes we ordered were fabulous. We shared the arugula and radicchio salad, and it was refreshing and a perfect starter--the shaved cheese adding just the right depth of flavor. My daughter's risotto (not garlic free, of course), was creamy and flavorful without being cloying in its richness. They prepared the pork dish for me and I don't usually order pork but this was tender and delicious, with perfectly toasted potatoes and broccoli rabe.

4.0,8/20/2016,"Tucked away inside an old apartment lobby of sorts. Located on a quiet street a few blocks north east of Lincoln center. They stay open later than most places of this caliber and this side of town. I decided to come here after a talk at Lincoln center. I was in a reflective mood and needed comforting. The previous evening, I had studied their menu and decided to covertly eat here before deciding it was a worthy place to take others.This review could have easily been five stars based on the food alone. It was delicious. When I ate here, they had a bottagra pasta on their menu. My favorite. It was excellent, but the best dish of the meal, was the lemon-verbena panna cotta with blueberries. It came with a fried twig of rosemary sprinkled with sugar crystals. This frying brought out the oils of rosemary without being overwhelming, like we all know rosemary can be. I was inspired, and have since enjoyed frying twigs of rosemary and herbs in my own cooking. That's an extra bonus when you take a chance on a new place, you learn something new. The one star removal is because, I was seated in the worst possible seat in the house. A lone table directly facing the bathroom. Grant it, it's down a long hallway, but anytime someone came to use the facilities, they would look in my direction before looking to their left, the actually direction of the bathroom. This was the most distracting thing to have to sit through and endure while I tried to enjoy my delicious and expensive meal. For this reason, I have not returned. This seat was clearly designed and reserved for the restaurant owner's worst enemies! What did I do to deserve this seat? I am not going to answer that question, it was stated for rhetorical purposes. To all the restaurateurs reading, never ever have a seat in your dining room that is in any way facing a bathroom. Why restaurants even have tables near their bathrooms is a sign they're willing to sacrifice their reputation to squeeze in a few more dollars. Let me tell you right now, it is not worth it.

The table setting and other interior design were kept simple, as to not fight against the artworks on the walls. So, where does the ""Artistes"" part comes in, other than these mural paintings?  Well, it sits inside the Hotel Des Artistes, which was designed and built as an artist's apartment building in 1917, for artists like Norman Rockwell. The food that we ordered from the special Restaurant Week was really nice. The Region of this particuar weekend was Campania, so we got to taste some of their cuisine, starting with Campania soup called Stracciatella, Baccalá ""mantecato"", Uova all'Amatriciana"" and Scramble eggs with Italian sweet sausage. They were flavorful, comforting, and some more interesting  than others. I must confess, I loved the restaurant itself better than the food, I wish if I could give 3.5 stars...

So this wasn't a case of a RW participant giving sub-par food to bargain-seekers. It was just inexplicably mediocre and a bit of a ripoff. Too bad, because the setting's gorgeous and the service tops.I had a $19 appetizer consisting of char-grilled octopus over romaine, olives and peppers. What arrived was five slices of octopus on a few meager leaves, two fragments of olive (yes, I counted) and tiny specks of red pepper. The octopus was tender. It was the only tasty thing I ate that night. My main meal was a $26 pasta with sardines, fennel and raisins and honest to God, I think the kitchen must sliver everything up and use tweezers to carefully insert a few tiny shreds of each ingredient. The pasta was tasteless. That's shocking in New York.My friend's food wasn't any better -- mushy melon and fennel with oily dressing and then a different kind of flavor-free pasta.

Ask the server's advice -- ask which wines he would recommend with your dish, and what his favorite dishes are. Every suggestion he made proved to be an excellent choice. We had three other waiters who appeared throughout the meal, and they were equally nice and helpful.We were a group of non-bread eaters, but the bread basket they put out at the beginning looked wonderful. They also brought out a plate with four very small amuse-bouches that were polenta flavored with what we think was fennel. A nice little surprise.Appetizers: One person got the lentil soup (which is vegan) and said it was perfect. Someone else got the Caponata and enjoyed it, and the third person and I shared the mozzarella and tomatoes. Excellent, creamy, bufala mozzarella. Their olive oil is also delicious.Main courses: Two in our party got the special fish for the evening, and it was brought out and deboned in front of us; it was like watching a surgeon in action -- except he took the bones out, in one piece, using a SPOON. Dude. A spoon. Once he had finished, two other waiters appeared with the other two dishes, and we were all served at the same time.The other person had a pasta dish with a Milanese bolognese sauce, made with veal -- a white sauce, that gets much of its flavor from the copious amount of onions used in it. I had the roasted chicken -- simple, straightforward, yet cooked perfectly and exquisitely. The chef is truly to be commended.I did not have any dessert, but the coffee was wonderful -- one person in our party had the cannolis -- two small come on a dish, and small is most welcome after a meal so that it's not overwhelming. The other person had the Baba, which came with fresh berries.We did not feel rushed at all -- we were there on a weeknight, and it was certainly full. When we left, we were given our correct coats (remember, no coat checks?). I asked about whether they had private parties there, and the Maitre D' showed me a small, private room that is across the lobby hallway of 1 West 67th. It's like a small salon -- one large table, with bookshelves filled with books. I plan to book an event there in the fall, and will report on how that goes.For the Upper West Side, and Manhattan in general, the price was not outrageous -- under $100/person, including wine. I would definitely return and highly recommend it to others.",3,0,0,Elizabeth S.,"Montclair, NJ",139,301,174

Really cozy feel and elegant place. Service was attentive but not in a lowkey-giving-my-waiter-the-sideeye-cause-i-can't-converse-with-my-friends kind of way. I LOVED the ricotta berry pancakes, the smoked swordfish salad was a new one but totally delish and the chickpea soup was savory and totally hit the spot. My shakshuka (it was labeled something else) came and while it was great my eggs were fully cooked so that was a bit of a bummer. However i decided to get fancy and have the chocolate eggplant mousse (how daring of me) and it was REALLY DELICIOUS.

3.0,1/31/2016,"We went to Leopard on a weekend in the evening for their restaurant week special.  We were greeted promptly at check in and they took our jackets - they don't give you a coat check ticket and they remember your face, which is cool.The restaurant is very pretty inside.  The tables in the front are standard, but in the back by the bar they're sectioned off in little alcoves, which give you privacy from other diners but makes for a close situation with the other table in the alcove with you.I ordered a glass of champagne and then we ordered our meal.  We got:APPETIZERS:Smoked trout - This was served with green apples and radicchio.  The smoked trout itself was nice, but the whole dish had a sour component that made it hard to consume.  I think that this could have benefitted from less radicchio and perhaps another ingredient?  We did not finish this dish.  Bresaola and caprino cheese ""bocconcini"" - VERY interesting dish, did not look like I would have expected at all.  Bresaola stuffed to look like little flowers with a soft cheese that almost reminded me of a cross between a goat cheese and a refreshing tzatziki.  The pickled vegetables with this were delicious.  Dining partner did not like this, I loved it.ENTREES:Risotto - This was a nicely prepared risotto dish with sage and butter, topped with toasted almonds and served in a butternut squash sauce.  This was perfectly cooked and hearty.  We liked it.Branzino - A nice piece of fish served in a very light, fresh tomato sauce with thinly sliced small potatoes and some olives.  We finished this one quickly.DESSERTS:""Bonet"" semifreddo - Recommended by our server.  This was alright.  Extremely chocolatey.Hot canederli - Little Italian style ""dumplings"" stuffed with apricot and served with a little flavorful apricot yogurt ice cream on the side.  Interesting dish.  Desserts were OK overall.We would come back to try the main menu.  The place were this restaurant was lacking a little was with the service.  Our server never came to check on us after we received our dishes and he took away my champagne glass without offering me another drink.  Additionally, at the end, he dropped our check off without asking us if we wanted anything else.  While he was knowledgable about the dishes and was nice in general, it felt like we were being rushed out and the normal nice touches of premium dining weren't hitting the mark.  All in all, a nice meal that we did not regret.",2,0,1,Jenn P.,"Manhattan, NY",285,134,933

When we went they were not fully booked. Yes, we were kind of big group but there was still big tables available whole the time we were there. Waitperson tries to take the dish away immediately, they brought check right away, come to pick up our check 3times within 10min, gave us little  souvenir(cookie) for us and try to get our check which we haven't even touched yet. Ok. These facts are already bad impressions, but I won't call that the rudest.They brought our jackets and costs out from coat check which we didn't ask. Basically telling us to leave and that is RUDE!!!I've never experienced such a thing! What did we do to deserve this kind of service? We were shocked. So one of us asked reception person before exit, if there was another reservations, so that we were rushed out.Receptionist told her ""there is no reservations, but we saw you had your bags and purses ready so we brought your coats out. You are more than welcome to stay"" she said we already up n out so we will just leave.

How can you say such things??? Second of all, sorry but we were late for our reservations about 15-20mins so we only stayed maybe little less 2hours!!!

I would definitely recommend reservations as the restaurant fills up fast!My biggest compliment to this restaurant was the service. I cannot believe how attentive the wait staff was during our meal for the pricepoint! I dropped a knife off the table at one point and within about 10 seconds it was replaced. We received great recommendations on the food from our waiter, and our glasses were never empty!All of our food was incredibly delicious and thoughtful. For the quality of food at this restaurant, I would have happily paid twice the amount. Everything we ate here was balanced in flavor and texture. I loved that there was always something ""crispy"" on the plate. We had the ""Gnudi"" appetizer which was three large ricotta gnocci accompanied by a field mushroom ragu. I don't like mushrooms and I thought these were outstanding! We split a pasta course (they split it for us in the kitchen which was awesome), the ""Ziti alla Norcina."" With its homemade sausage, it was also fantastic. For our main courses, I had the lamb and my boyfriend had the duck. Both were beautifully plated and tasted just as good as they looked!

I think we made a mistake with ordering as well - stay away from burgers etc. (bland, unimpressive) and stick to the Italian food, which is what they do best. We came for Saturday brunch and I absolutely loved it. I honestly can't stop talking about it. The food was fantastic - started with bread and great quality oil, then I had the carbonara which was cooked and seasoned to perfection - just the right bite to the pasta, rich but not too rich, with wonderful tasting cheese. My husband had something which was sort of like an Italian croque monseuir - toasted rustic bread with melted buffalo mozzarella and Parma ham with a side of tomatoes and red onions which were in this great oil and garlic dressing. Everything tasted SO GOOD. Fresh and simple good quality ingredients put together really well. We also had a couple of mimosas each which tasted amazing (proper champagne and fresh juice, not sugary rubbish). We were too full for dessert but they gave complementary mini fresh cookies which is always such a nice touch.Service was great and the atmosphere was perfect, quite posh but still relaxed and welcoming. The final happy surprise was the price. Entrees and drinks were around $14, $5 less than most overpriced chains in the area charge.I cannot wait to go back for brunch again and for dinner.

The first time I went, it had just opened and  I had a lovely evening with two friends. I went back with my husband and they were running behind so we had to wait for 45 minutes for a table as did the couple next to us at the bar. The difference was they obviously knew someone because they were treated to drinks and appetizers while they waited and we got nothing. We live in the neighborhood and really hoped to make this ""our neighborhood restaurant"". They were quite snooty and condescending because they assumed for some reason that we were from out of town. So we did not return for years. Last night, we returned at my sister's insistence because her husband knows the owner. There were 7 of us. The service was incredible slow. Tables came in after us and left before us. When we said something they reported that the kitchen was busy but they did nothing to make it up to us. When we finally mentioned the owner who was not there they apologized and even said they hoped we would report good things but they did not seem to care. I go out to dinner at least twice a week and I never feel as blown off or insignificant as I have at the Leopard.

4.0,10/16/2015,"In Manhattan, zip codes are everything...Unless, of course, you're one of the lucky Upper East/West Side residents worthy enough of claiming a ""One East/West...Street"" home address.  For those of you who aren't familiar, the ""One"" designates a building's proximity to Central Park (read: a ""One"" means virtually *ON* the Park).  Case in point: The Hotel des Artistes, a grand apartment building and home to tony Italian restaurant, The Leopard at des Artistes, located at, you guessed it, ""ONE W. 67th Street.""Upon entering the restaurant from the picturesque tree-lined sidewalk, I immediately ""buttoned up,"" if you will: I adjusted my shirt collar, ran my hands along the top of my hair to calm any fly-aways, and corrected my posture from slightly slouched to upright.  Not that the restaurant was overly-stuffy or ""black tie"" fancy, but this has traditionally been my knee-jerk reaction upon finding myself in more, shall we say, high-end locations/venues.  Kind of like when I used to visit my aunt and uncle at their fabulous apartment (filled with museum-worthy art and an incredible amount of ""breakables"") located just across the Park from the restaurant.  To make a long story short, I wanted to look the part and be on my best ""grown up"" behavior for my brunch at The Leopard. ""Because of the many ateliers and studios built especially for artists and musicians on West 67th Street, this particular block was often referred to as 'Artists Row.'  Designed by the architect, George Mort Pollard, the Hotel des Artistes has been home to many of the famed and illustrious, including Noel Coward, Isadora Duncan, writer Fannie Hurst, New York City Mayor John V. Lindsay, Alexander Woollcott, and Norman Rockwell.""  In an ode to its colorful history, the restaurant's walls are adorned with ""fanciful murals of frolicking nudes painted by Howard Chandler Christy, an early resident"" of the building.Moments after I was seated and two-sips in to my coffee, my girlfriend, Elena, arrived to join me for brunch.  In an ode to sample as many starters and entrees as possible, we decided to split a handful of dishes.  To begin (and in a strategic effort to soak up the alcohol from the previous evening's shenanigans), we selected the bakery basket filled with homemade muffins, scones, Danish, and coffee cake.  House-made jam and sweet butter were served alongside as accompaniments.  While each morsel was every bit soft and delicious, the scones were particularly transcendent.  I wonder if they could be ordered on their own?Because brunch shouldn't solely be all eggs and waffles, Elena and I ordered two salads.  As if our sweet bread basket didn't contain enough carbs (god help me, I sound so ""LA!""), we also received a savory version - accompanied by olive oil - in anticipation of and to pair with our saltier fare.Pollo al LimoneThe Pollo al Limone (loosely translated to ""lemon chicken"") salad featured hand-pulled, roasted free-range chicken breast that was served atop a green bouquet of arugula and frisee leaves, thick tendrils of fragrant fennel, celery, Castelvetrano olives, and finished with a tangy lemon dressing.CapreseTaking center stage on the plate, a fluffy white cloud of burrata (mozzarella cheese with a creamy, molten-like center) could have been a doppelganger for the clusters that form just beyond your airplane window at 30k feet.  As if that wasn't righteous enough on its own, the cheese was lightly drizzled with olive oil and accompanied by chunks of tomato and sprigs of fragrant basil.  What a treat! For our main course, Elena and I chose one pasta dish plus a familiar breakfast entree.Spaghetti ""all carbonara""Pungent Pecorino Romano (cheese), egg yolk, and black pepper came together to create a creamy trinity in which al-dente spaghetti noodles were tossed, coated, and then served in an artful tangle.  Salty guanciale (strips of thick-cut Italian bacon) crowned the dish.Des Artistes Eggs BenedictChef Brogioni ""Italianized"" this traditionally American brunch entree by substituting San Daniele prosciutto for overly-processed Canadian bacon and serving it atop a buttery, toasted slice of country bread.  The salty ham ribbon was crowned with a perfectly-poached egg and topped with a dollop of Hollandaise.  Herbed breakfast potatoes (...Were they twice or thrice fried?) were crunchy and well-oiled/salted, revealing a fluffy-soft interior.What - you think we'd leave without sampling at least one dessert?  Never...Nutella Chocolate MoussePlated atop a bed of hazelnut ""crunch"" that acted as a pseudo crust, the nutty Nutella-hinted chocolate mousse revealed a refreshingly-dense texture with a flavor subtly reminiscent of a dark chocolate Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.  Finished with a gooey layer of ganache icing and a scoop of banana gelato, this was one of my and Elena's favorite dishes - and presentations - of our meal.",1,0,1,Lindsay F.,"New York, NY",376,277,184

The service was excellent and they even let us taste the 2 different glasses of wine we ordered to make sure we liked them. My only gripe was our reservation was for 10:30 as we had a show at Lincoln Center. When they called to confirm I told them I might be a few minutes late as I was coming from the show. I was told they would not seat past 10:45. The show let out at 10:40 so we had to make a mad dash. When we arrived we were told the kitchen closed at 11:00 but they did seat us. We had to order right away. Another couple came in a few minutes after us and were rushed just the same. The mood of being there and being rushed like that was disappointing. If you wan to close the kitchen at 11:00 on Saturday night knowing there are performances going on don't take 10:30 reservations....that is my only gripe.I will definitely like to go back and try different things and not be so hurried next time.

4.0,4/11/2015,"Classy restaurant with DELICIOUS food and excellent service. Everything we ate was amazing (see pictures below). They start you off with a gigantamous basket of bread. Appetizer: ""Gnudi"" - ricotta gnocchi in a white sauce, topped with spinachEntrees: Pappardelle with lamb (on their specials for the night)Vegetarian options available and I highly recommend the ravioli with artichoke and burrata cheese in a tomato sauce. Dessert: Profitteroli with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. Unlike other high end restaurants in the city that bring out just a pinch of dessert (where you find yourself asking - is that it?!), this place gives you a huge portion that can easily be shared. Food and service were both great, but the ambiance is slightly dull/boring/serious - maybe that was because we were here on a weekday evening.

We usually ate at the bar, which has changed a little, but was very lively.It was a pleasant surprise to see my old friend Henry from a now closed Flatiron restaurant has been promoted to maitre d' at the Leopard. I saw some other familiar faces on the floor and felt immediately at home for a flawless and eminently enjoyable meal.Make sure you don't fill up on the bread basket, as tempting as that might be. The long skinny breadsticks will encourage you to drink your face off.I had the cinnamon french toast with panna cotta and limoncello soaked berries before eggs in purgatory. My husband had a green salad and the burger. We shared a semifredo of Sangiovese grape dessert wine.The french toast was light as air, and the eggs were perfectly poached in tomato sauce in a cast iron skillet with a piece of bread to get every last bite. The fries with the burger were awesome, even more so dipped in the eggs' tomato sauce. The burger was perfectly medium rare on a brioche bun with caramelized onions. We started with mimosas and moved on to martinis, and the drinks were great. Service flowed, and I must congratulate them on an ace team from FOH to the kitchen.

5.0,2/28/2015,"I came here again for Sunday brunch during Restaurant Week. DEFINITELY make a reservation! This place is BUSY, and rightly so. Brunch was absolutely amazing. COFFEE/DRINKS: They serve you an entire carafe of coffee when you order a cup - that is amazing. They also have a full wine menu, not just your usual crappy house champagne or mimosa. APPETIZER: My husband ordered the swordfish carpaccio with blood orange. Holy cow, he absolutely loved it. MAIN COURSE: I ordered the traditional eggs benedict and it was perfectly done with an excellent hollandaise sauce and thinly sliced prosciutto. My husband enjoyed eggs in a skillet with a cherry tomato reduction. DESSERT: Here is where you SHOULD NOT skimp! Normally, I'm not a big dessert person, especially for breakfast, but I am SOOOO glad I tried dessert. I ordered the NUTELLA MOUSSE WITH HAZELNUT CRUNCH AND BANANA GELATO. WOW!!! It was absolutely heavenly!  I want to come back to the The Leopard just to get this dessert again.

3.0,12/12/2014,"We were not looking good forward to prepping and hosting a Thanksgiving meal, so we decided to forgo the shopping, the logistics, the cooking, and the cleaning and just headed down to the Leopard for an easy holiday experience. The dining room is as beautiful and as comfortable as ever. The Leopard js a very charming place to have a meal, in particular if you have alot of people in your party. Every table feels spacious and there's no crowding like you see at many Manhattan restaurants.Service was refined as always and the staff was very helpful to us as well, going out of their way to ensure that we were well situated and that the kids were taken care of. The staff was also genuinely sweet with the little ones, stopping by to play or give them a quick word. I haven't been at Des Artistes since we moved out of the city, and my last memories of the food were very positive. This time around, I liked a few of the dishes but also had a few reservations about the quality and the presentation of others. We got quite a few items off the menu and I got to try the butternut squash and ricotta ravioli, the Thanksgiving turkey plate, the vegetable platter, the beet salad, and the bucatini with sardines.Service was fast. Everything was served promptly but immediately I noticed that a few of the dishes looked a bit ""Mom-ish"", basically like thoughtless plops of food were dropped on the plate. Not a huge deal of course, but when your paying $30 for turkey and stuffing it would have been nice to see something a bit more refined. As for the quality, I thought the pastas were very well done. The bucatini was great, with very strong sardine and fennel flavors in every bite. I'd imagine this dish is not for everyone because it was quite pungent but damn it was good.  I also thought the ravioli was excellent though a tad too sweet for my taste. I get that's it's an autumny/holiday dish but it was still a little too sugary especially with the candied pecans. On the negative side, the vegetable platter stunk to high heaven. They stated in the menu that it came with Sicilian chick pea fritters, but there was just one on the plate. FritterS means multiple pieces not 1 little itty bitty one. Since this was the only decent item on the plate it was a major downer. Also, the rest of the veg was unremarkable, just sauteed, basic greens and what seems to be steamed carrots. My one year old like that, but not me. Oh yeah, the fennel was drastically undercooked. All in all, at $29, this was an overpriced and unsatisfactory disaster. The Thanksgiving plate was also a mess. Plating was amateurish and the turkey was dry. You guys make the Thanksgiving meal 1 day a year and you can't get it to be moist? Jesus. Dry turkey, eww. Needless to say when I got my $200 check I was a bit displeased. That's a lotta cash for a very hit and miss meal. But hey, it's the holiday season.

3.0,5/13/2014,"The origins of The Leopard at des Artistes can be attributed to the original Cafe, a restaurant that emerged as a necessity for the tenants who lived in the Hotel des Artistes. It was later reborn as ""The Leopard"", and with Executive Chef Vito Gnazzo (who formerly worked at three-Michelin starred Antica Osteria del Ponte as well as Il Gattopardo) has become one of the best recognized restaurants in the Upper West Side, a fact which can be partially credited to the nine oil-on-canvas murals displayed throughout the restaurant.A group of friends and I met here for a weekend Restaurant Week lunch, curious to to see what would come out of the kitchens at des Artistes. We all arrived promptly on a Saturday afternoon, and were seated at a circular table near the entrance. The first few minutes were spent trying to figure out the layout of the dining area, which consisted of several rooms and elevated areas, as well as taking in the myriad of murals displayed on the walls. In due time, however, our attention was turned to the menu, which, for Restaurant Week, consisted of several options per each of the three courses.To begin: The Stracciatella alla romana, otherwise known as ""roman-style egg drop soup"" was served steaming hot in a wide bowl. Whisked eggs are mixed in with spinach and grated Parmigiano, and lightly stirred into a soup base to produce the stracciatelle of egg in the soup. The version at The Leopard at Des Artistes stayed true to its roots, utilizing a light guinea fowl stock as the base, which highlighted the simple flavors of the spinach and Parmigiano, with a dash of nutmeg. While simple, it was a comforting bowl for a winter day.For the main course, my friend was willing to split the two dishes that I was torn between. First, the Uovo all' Amatriciana was a dish consisting of two poached eggs submerged in a rich tomato sauce. The addition of guanciale and onion added some much needed richness and a slight sweetness to the dish, and mixing in the still-soft egg yolk was the perfect concoction to put onto the toasted bread halves. The second dish that we shared was the Beef Burger, which is topped with caramelized red onions and served with a side of fries. The patty, a rather petite serving of ground beef, lacked the juiciness and flavor I was hoping for; it was a dry, underseasoned serving of meat that was enveloped by the two brioche buns. I was similarly disappointed with the fries, which had been cooked too long and lacked the crispness they should have maintained.And for dessert, we all opted for the Pear Strudel, a modest presentation of baked bartlett pairs wrapped in thin layers of pastry dough. It came with a side of Meyer lemon sorbet, an appropriate pairing for a light dessert, and the flecks of cinnamon and golden raisins were much appreciated additions. While I wouldn't make a return trip to The Leopard at des Artistes, I am glad that I made the initial visit; it's as much a dining destination as it is a piece of NYC's history. While the food wasn't particularly memorable, it's a not a bad option for those in the area or a pre-theater meal; certainly, you could do much worse.",7,4,5,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

It was lightly grilled and seasoned enough so that you still feel like you're eating octopus and not just the seasoning.Then we had a pasta with tubular noodles. I forgot the name. The noodles were lightly breaded with anchovies, clams and a variety of other things in it.I had the lamb stew type dish and my boyfriend had the cod. The portion sizes were all rather generous so we did not finish. I thought the lamb was well flavored but could have been more tender. The cod was good, but on the bland side.For dessert, had the pistacio semifreddo. The flavor was good..not sure about the creaminess. Overall it was an enjoyable meal minus the feeling of being rushed.The whole meal took 1 hour, 20 min..which is pretty fast considering the number of courses.It got packed right away basically right after we got there.

5.0,7/9/2013,"I love this place. The decor is wonderful, it has a series of gorgeous semi-nude (or just nude) females frolicking around in various paintings around the place. You can sit on the bottom part, a semi-elevated area (up 2-3 steps), or in a backroom where there is more seating or you can sit at the bar. Their food is amazing. I've gotten steak here, scallops, their soups are good, and oh my- their caprese salad with prosciutto was delicious! Their wines are also delicious- my mother got a rose and I got a white Palagrello. Quite good. The staff is really nice too. We were sitting at the bar, but it was a bit breezy and cold. We asked if we could be reseated to a table right across from the bar, but still have the bartender as our server. He told us yes, but offered to just turn down the aircon to solve the problem. This was done quickly, and it was quite nice being able to  continue sitting at the bar, appreciating the atmosphere of the place with the paintings from that perspective.I would definitely return here, and plan to many times. BONUS-- they participate regularly in discounted menus for Restaurant Week events- the one in March and the Italian one in June (possibly others, but those are the two I know about).",3,0,0,Lauren D.,"New York, NY",44,184,86

It has a great ambiance and interior which fit the occasion perfectly. The place was chic, without being stuffy and pretentious. My family and I very much enjoyed our dinner. We had the Trofie pasta, artichoke ravioli, and the rigatoni alla norma. Each dish had great flavor, just the right portion size, and delightful presentation. I can't give the Leopard 5 stars because of the service. I was expecting top notch service for such an expensive restaurant. We arrived on time for our 8 pm dinner reservation on a Tuesday and were taken to the bar because our table was not ready. However, the place was not full and we did not request any type of special seating. I also thought service was quite slow.

5.0,4/2/2013,"Came here with the family on Easter Sunday for an afternoon dinner after going to church. We arrived early but were seated immediately. I particularly liked the layout of the wine list, sorted by northern, central, and southern regions of Italy. The waiter recommended the Nero D'avola ""Feudi del Pisciotto"" and we very much enjoyed it. We split the Italian meats and cheese plate; tasted like high quality and was a reminder that not all Italian restaurants can do this appetizer correctly! Expectations were exceeded. For entrees, everyone ordered lamb, so we were glad they were offering both the regular menu roasted lamb, and the special Easter menu lamb chops. We licked our plates clean. Entrees were small but appropriate portions, which gave you room for something sweet... We really splurged on dessert and ordered the special Italian spongecake, the cheesecake, and the profiteroles. All three were fantastic! It was nice we never felt rushed during our meal, since the four of us were there for over 2.5 hours, even though there were many people in the restaurant for the entirety of our meal. When time came for the check, we realized they accidentally charged us for a cocktail we hadn't ordered. No questions asked, the waiter swiftly printed out a revised check.

Again, I would have been okay with that if our waiter (Adrian) had not been curt, inattentive, and slow. He seemed put out to be serving us.

As for the food, mist of our dishes were ok. The appetizer was basically an omelet with spinach and ricotta. I was surprised by the generous size. For my main, I got the burger, which was very good... The highlight of my meal. Frankly, I don't remember what I got for dessert because it just wasn't memorable. I do remember that my friend ordered the fruit plate, and it was literally came with five berries on what looked like a ginormous plate. If you're going to give her such a meager serving, at least present it in a tiny bowl or something... The worst part of the lunch was the service. The tables around us had already been cleared and we were still waiting for our entrees to be cleared. My friend had to hail down someone who looked like the manager to clear our entrees, so the waiter would get our desserts.

Get the gelato and a reasonably priced bottle of wine.My bf had the cod asparagus fennel salad for appetizer, and each component ""tasted really good and fresh."" I had the soup of the day - lentil - for appetizer, we both liked it. As a matter of fact, I'd like to get the recipe. He had the meatloaf for main course, and wishes he had the seafood stew instead. Similarly, my ravioli was uninspired. I had the gelato for dessert, it was very tasty; the flavors were very inventive and nuanced. My bf had the pannacotta, which was remarkably creamy but otherwise not outstanding. We had a nice bottle of Nero d'Avola with dinner. I liked that they had bottles of wine as cheap as $28, very reasonable for the setting. We also had cognac after dinner, and they brought us these delicious biscotti (I usually can't stand those dry cookie things) for free. They have a full bar there, but no one around us was drinking cocktails. My bf had an espresso which was ""good"".  All of the portions were reasonable; we didn't have any leftovers but we were quite full by the end. I suppose if you have a big appetite you could just stuff yourself with homemade bread.The service was impeccable, although the Italian waiter could not seem to hear or understand what I was saying. There was a whole service TEAM at this place - one guy goes around with the water pitcher, one guy sets the flatware, one guy sets the stemware, one guy brings around the pepper grinder, and then there are guys running and busing of course, too. And probably a bar back or two. Tipping out there must be somewhat of a drain on the waiters. Everything was brought out smoothly and in a timely way.

The croissant was buttery and flaky, while the mini muffin was fluffy and studded with plump blueberries. The coffe cake, topped with a cinnamon sugar crumb, was least impressive as it was a bit dry. The scone was a cranberry scone that was fluffy with a good crumb. It tasted as though it had a hint of citrus to it. This was definitely my favorite part of the meal.For my next course I ordered the Eggs Benedict which consisted of perfectly poached eggs resting on thin layers of prosciutto and crusty bread. A good dish, though pretty standard. The side of potatoes were well seasoned. For my final course I had the seasonal fruit plate. This plate contained strawberries, blackberries, cape gooseberries, pineapple, and melon. The melon was so sweet and juicy, as were the blackberries.

5.0,7/30/2012,"Simply sublime!  Came on a Restaurant Week ""deal"", but no deal's needed to get us to go back again (and again and again!!!).  Great food and service as good as it gets - refined and attentive but not overbearing.  First, you can't say enough about the space -- the old Cafe des Artistes, cleaned up and better than ever.  We were a party of six celebrating my daughter-in-law's birthday, so we tried a wide variety of appetizers and entrees, and they were all fabulous (and even before the appetizers, the bread is so good you've got to watch yourself to make sure you don't overdo it and leave room for the great meal ahead!).  The ravioli app is a star, and the swordfish, meatloaf and risotto entrees still have us raving,  This is our new Lincoln Center go-to restaurant - waay better than the Lincoln Restorante.",0,0,0,Martin B.,"New York, NY",0,81,0
4.0,6/20/2012,"Brunch and nudity: Two things that I would have never thought went well together at a restaurant. Before you get the wrong idea, this is a bit of a classy place and the giant murals on the walls depict Spanish explorers discovering an island paradise full of naked wood nymphs. I'm sure even Ponce De Leon had wet dreams. No worries here about gawking because it's art. It's meant to be admired. The most important thing to be admired here is the food. We came here for brunch on a Saturday at noon and despite having reservations, the place was empty. Very surprising since the food was top notch. I ordered the spaghetti carbonara and it was prepared to near perfection. Carbonara can be very tough to get right. Some places make it too eggy or use poor quality meat. Every ingredient in this dish complimented each other in tasty harmony. I just wish the portion size would have been a tad bigger. I also tried the scrambled eggs mixed with italian sweet sausage and it was pretty delicious as well. They put some sort of flakey coating on the hash browns that really made the dish sing. It's the little details that this establishment adds that makes this quite a dining experience. As expected, it was a little on the pricey side but I knew that going in. Central Park West near Lincoln Center is no cheap area. You get what you pay for but in a good way. The waiters here were almost too attentive. I'm definitely coming back here and I may just have to give it the full five stars on the next visit.",2,2,0,Evan M.,"Manhattan, NY",96,320,158
4.0,6/20/2012,"This is a lovely lovely little spot. I've been twice now- which says a lot considering the fact that we live in a mecca of amazing restaurants to enjoy. Both times I've been were for brunch- once with friends, once with family. The menu is great- it appealed to real NYC foodies and hometown Midwesterners alike. I enjoyed it too. My one HUGE complaint is regarding the orange juice which was made from concentrate. I'd actually prefer not to order it at all that way- especially paired with high quality good. It was a sharp contrast. Not a big deal to me, but the service slowed waaaay down by the end our meals. Both times I've been- I've waited quite a long time for the check. Otherwise the service was very good- friendly waiters eager to please. Go- enjoy- don't order orange juice.",1,0,1,Sarah O.,"Oakland, CA",2,33,1
5.0,6/14/2012,"This is a really special gem on the Upper West Side located on the north side of 67th street, just west of Central Park and Columbus Avenue. My husband's father's wife took us here during her visit from out of town for a drink before heading back to Texas where she resides. Although the building is now mostly converted into a hotel, apparently her mom and dad once owned a unit in the 1940's and 50's. The naked murals that are painted on the walls of the bar were once considered extremely risque and controversial. Now they are cherished as tasteful and historical artifacts. The cozy, classy decor of The Leopard is surprising compared to the old, dated, musky look of the front hotel entrance. While I cannot yet comment on the quality of the food first hand, I can definitely testify that the drinks are carefully concocted and delicious. Additionally, our bar tender, Nessim (his name means ""miracles""; yes, plural...I asked), was a refreshing conversationalist. He added a lot of fun to our cocktail hour and came up with a few creative ""mocktails"" for me since I was the pregnant person in our group.

4.0,4/17/2012,"The ambiance is lovely with the great murals from the previous restaurant, Cafe des Artistes.  Respectable noise level with no music making conversation pleasurable.  The menu is lovely.  Two of us had the beet salad and two shared a pasta as an appetizer--the rigatoni Norma.  The salads drew praise and the pasta was tasty, but it was a VERY skimpy portion and I can't understand why.  I did not count the rigatoni in my bowl, but  I would say we each had about 12 rigatoni.  Now, really, I thought it was just silly to serve like this.  It was tasty, absolutely al dente and the eggplant and sauce very good.  But the restaurant can do better than that.  I've had split pastas for appetizers in many places, and never have I seen such a measly portion.  For the main courses, the Branzino was very well prepared.  Perfectly cooked with lovely herbs and a side vegetable.  I had the turbot which was fantastic and deboned at the table by a very skillful waiter.  My husband had the Berkshire pork chop which was very tender.  All entrees had lovely vegetable side accompaniments.  For dessert, the ice cream was good but not special.  Seeing a cannoli on the menu, I decided I must have it.  It looked beautiful when presented on the table, but it disappointed.  The shell was not crispy and the filling not sweet as they usually are.  It even had a slight sour taste to it.  I should have sent it back and ordered something else, but did not.  I'll have to try another dessert next time.All in all, I liked it very much.  The service is very professional and attentive.  I had a lovely white glass of wine--a Trebbiano, I believe.  I forgot to look at the wine label as I wanted to see if I could purchase it on my own.I recommend The Leopard at Cafe des Artistes.",1,0,0,Carolyn K.,"Manhattan, NY",3,9,0
5.0,4/8/2012,"A well-earned five star review.  I went to Cafe des Artistes as a kid and had an exceptional Waldorf chicken salad.  Given that I was in middle school at the time and I still remember it, you can tell it was clearly a stand-out.Today, I came to Leopard at des Artistes with my parents and sister for Easter brunch.  Coming from a small family, we tend to go to restaurants on holidays and splurge a little.  It was interesting to see the new evolution of Cafe des Artistes, now Leopard at des Artistes.  The food wasn't brunch standards as my mom expected.  The food was Italian and quite good.  While most of the people dining were closer to my parents age (if not a bit older) than that of my sister and I, it was still fairly lively.  The waiter brought out these rice balls with veal and mozzarella to start.  They reminded me of the rice balls at Tanuki Tavern in a good way.  I wish I had known those would be coming out or I wouldn't have ordered the risotto, but the risotto was fabulous--far too rich to finish, but truly excellent.My sister and I noticed a VIP nook on the way to the bathroom.  I wonder who's eaten there?  I would highly recommend Leopard for a special occasion.",2,1,1,Caroline B.,"New York, NY",457,1247,36

4.0,2/14/2012,"I read reviews with caution.  The reason is that, more often than not, I find them to be quite over-inflated, positively.  It's understandable; you spend a lot of money for a night out and you convince yourself and others it was great when, in fact, it was mediocre.  To those who do this, please stop.  You're not doing anyone a favor (other than possibly the restaurant) by artificially inflating reviews, positively.  We are all here to decide if we should spend our money at the Leopard des Artistes, or somewhere else.   For my part, I ate at the Leopard des Artistes this past Saturday, Jan 28th, 2012 pre-Met opera.  The Leopard was surprisingly good.  The fennel salad with oranges and olives, while uninspired, was light and refreshing.  The Dover Sole (you have to ask for it) was simply broiled but was as good as any I've ever had in the UK.  My partner had the mahi-mahi (called Dorado on the menu) which was not as fresh as it should have been but it was still better than most fish dishes at non ""all seafood"" restaurants.  My biggest criticisms were the ultra-snug fit on the armchairs, the  over-intimate, crowded seating configuration, and the coffee, which was diner-quality at best.  Overall, I liked it.  If you're into good quality ingredients, assembled without fanfare and alchemy, this is a solid restaurant worth the money.",1,0,1,Justin K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0
4.0,12/31/2011,"Review #300!I was totally nervous to try out the new restaurant in the old Cafe des Artistes spot: My then-boyfriend/now-husband and I have come here every year for our anniversary since we were 16. I capital-letters LOVED Cafe (yelp.com/biz/cafe-des-ar…). I may or may not have cried (just a little) the day it closed. Still, The Leopard has gotten a decent write-up pretty much everywhere, from Yelp to the New Yorker, and they kept the murals, so we figured we'd give it a shot for our 2 yr/13 yr anniversary last week. They've definitely changed the space, opting for a more open, airy and modern look. I did miss the ""old New York"" feeling, but the murals are still amazing. That said, everything else was pretty much perfect. The service was phenomenal; we joked that if an award was given for most-frequently-filled water glasses, this place had it in the bag. Our waiter was happy to offer recommendations, and his suggestions were on point. Speaking of, the food was delectable from apps to desserts (go for the berries & Zabaione -- they prepare it tableside which only adds to its yumminess). This is absolutely an acceptable anniversary-restaurant replacement.",4,0,0,Marisa F.,"Mamaroneck, NY",96,452,50

4.0,11/14/2011,"We went there for brunch last Saturday before a fall foliage-peeping walk in the Central Park. I've never been to the previous Cafe des Artistes, but dining in The Leopard at des Artistes was a very pleasant experience for me. We arrived around 12:30 pm and the restaurant was only half full. I was very excited to see the famous murals of nudes! The ordering and food-serving process was a bit slow, but I guess in here you were expected to take it slow. The complimentary bread basket was very delicious! I finished all the bread and all bread sticks, and soaked up all the olive oil on the plate.I order Porchetta panino. The ingredients of this Porchetta were a bit different from what I had in Italy, but it was still delicious and relatively healthy (with broccoli rabe and pesto sauce).My husband order broiled branzino. It came in a small plate and the plating of the fish looked kind of average to me, but my husband said the fish tasted good.We also shared a dessert of warm apple costata. It was a small apple pie with caramel sauce and vanilla gelato. It was perfect ending to our meal!!This place did offer a unique ambiance. The other diners I saw last Saturday were mostly elegant-looking old ladies. It was a world by itself. I noticed that there was a couple who just popped in and walked around the restaurant to have a look at the murals (I don't know how they were allowed in). After we walked out of the door, there was also a few people peeping through the windows to gaze at the murals.",1,0,0,Tina Y.,"New York, NY",0,196,0

4.0,8/23/2011,"Welcome to cougartown, boys and girls. Please keep all arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times.This reinvention of the famed Cafe des Artistes does not disappoint. The same vibe -- of perfumey, silk and cashmere clad grandmas and grandpas, cougars and their young prey and good ol' boys dining out -- pervades. I loved Cafe des Artistes, but the new southern Italian menu really impresses not only with its nods to the traditional but in the choices available; there's something for everyone.The chef sends out a tasty amuse bouche of croqettes with a pepper risotto, that along with the torrential downpour outside, whet my appetite for something warm and savory.We started with the Sardinian ""fregula"" with clams, mussels and shellfish broth ($14) which looked like a bowl of Minestrone with oysters/clams but was actually really good. Looks can be deceiving.The trofie with pistachio, almonds and pecorino cheese pesto was freshly homemade pasta ($19) but I'd pass on this pasta for the one I picked right away and had to make a strong case for (but I won in the end) -- the homemade pappardelle with roasted rabbit and seasonal mushrooms ($22). This was amazing, warm notes from the mushrooms working with the melt in your mouth rabbit and buttery pasta. The only let down was the lightly breaded grilled swordfish with salmoriglio sauce and caponata ghiotta ($34), which, for that price, should not have been partially raw on the inside.We had realllllly slow service, but it is so hard to get mad at older gentlemen with Italian accents.Good cocktails provided a lot of options, depending on your spirit of choice. With dinner, I enjoyed a glass of the Montepulciano ""Dama"" 2009 Marramiero ($12) that was jammy and accompanied the rabbit well.
