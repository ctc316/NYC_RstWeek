5.0,1/27/2019,I absolutely love this restaurant! Let's start off with the ambience on Friday or Saturday nights... There's a mixture of old-school hip-hop songs that set the perfect mood for a great night with friends. The food is absolutely amazing there is it one thing on the menu that I haven't tried. It's a great place to go with a group of friends were going to try different types of food... Basically it's all shareable. It's the first place I go to for dinner every time I'm in the city.,0,0,1,Stella G.,"Los Angeles, CA",185,12,13
1.0,12/29/2018,If your going to throw down $150 for a dinner for two it better be bomb. THE FOOD SHOULD BE UP TO PAR. Pierogis were probably the best thing we ordered. Vegan pickled mushroom tacos were nothing to rave about along with the caprese ravioli which were mushy and gross. The vegan burger was okay but for $9 I would never get it again. Deserts are very similar to beauty and Essex and with the price you are better off going there and having better food. French onion soup dumplings are SO OVERRATED WASTE OF MONEY. Not to mention it was my birthday they did nothing despite me putting it on the reservation. The manager was too busy catering to an ex employee dinning there and continued to bring free food to her table instead of asking us how the meals going. Spend your money at Scarpetta.,1,0,0,Marlena K.,"Brooklyn, NY",209,586,1507

4.0,12/24/2018,"I was going to a local lounge nearby for a friends birthday and we decided to come here for dinner. They took us upstairs which was more of a lounge and it was really cool. We didn't know they menu is tapas but it worked out great. We ordered the pulled chicken arepas, octopus salad, scallops, chorizo Mac & cheese and French onion soup dumplings. Everything was delicious and the services are bigger than we thought. I can't picked a favorite since I really enjoyed each dish in its own way. I will definitely be coming back.",4,3,6,Isabel J.,"Sunnyside, NY",867,1528,1388
5.0,12/23/2018,"Great ambiance and good food.  You have to try the French onion bites.  If you enjoy French onion soup, this dish is a must.  I wasn't blown away by the Bloody Mary.  It was just okay.  We tried a few different dishes, but the French onion bites stood out the most.  The only negative thing about our meal was our server.  He was not friendly and was impatient.  As this was our first time here, we took our time ordering and had questions about the menu.  Mr. Rude didn't seem to want to be bothered.  The people who brought our food to the table were extremely helpful and pleasant.  I'd go again and ask for another server.",1,0,0,Jadene P.,"Cincinnati, OH",83,78,60
5.0,12/19/2018,"First of all, our dinner reservation was for 6:45 PM, I received a phone call from the manager requesting to move my reservation to 7:00 due to a private event. In return for changing the reservation, the manager provided our party with complimentary Prosecco. Our meal was on par with one of the best meals I've ever eaten in my life! The wait staff and bar staff are top notch! At the end of the meal, we received a complimentary dessert for changing our reservation time. These gestures are greatly appreciated and have added to an already wonderful experience in New York. We were sad to find out that The Stanton Social will be closing at the end of the year.

2.0,12/10/2018,"Can't say I'd come back here. Took my boyfriend here for his birthday. Was super excited because they had vegan and vegetarian options. Food: Needless to say we both brought our appetites as we were excited for the menu. They serve the food family style so everything is shared. Each item costs at minimum $10 and is SUPER tiny. Now I don't mind if the bite is amazing but is was SUBPAR. Our bill ended up being a little over $200 for two of us. And we were STILL hungry afterwards. Sorry but for over $200 I need to be full. My slightly annoying experience: We arrived there and they sat us in this extremely tight area and when I asked to be moved to the table next to ours they told us we couldn't move there because it was a table for four people. Five minutes later the waitress sits a couple (2 people) at that ""4 person"" table. I pointed that out and the manager came and moved us with no issue",0,0,0,Danielle F.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1,12,4
4.0,12/10/2018,"Had my friends take me here for birthday dinner and I have to say I really liked the whole experience.We were a party of 8 and were seated right in front of the entrance which wasn't ideal due to the cold draft coming in every time the door opened. But the food more than made up for it. We ordered two of each of the following:Beet Salad - So refreshing. That crispy goat cheese really pairs well with the beets. Delightful start of the meal!Old School Meatballs - Juicy and savory without being too salty, great choice to rev up those palates while silently filling you up.French Onion Soup Dumplings - This was obligatory since every other pic on yelp seemed to be this one, but honestly, for the portion and price this was my least favorite. It was decent, but too small of a bite.Chicken & Waffle Slider - This had better quantity going for it and though it appears slightly dry, it wasn't bad at all! Mac & Cheese - Crowdpleaser. Had bites of spicy jalapeno to make it more fun to eat.Pan Seared Scallops - The MVP of the night. More than few of my friends commented how perfectly cooked the scallops were. Delightful to eat with that risotto base. Also more filling than usual scallop appetizer.Service was pretty good, though we had to try and flag our server a few times. They also had nice drink options and my friend had the Notorious F.I.G. which may appeal to sweet-lovers as it was a tad bit too sweet for me. I had Lost in Polanco which came with a large pickled pepper and it was refreshing compliment to the plates. For dessert, they got me the Pink Velvet birthday milkshake shot which I gulped down in one swoop. It was SO good! And we shared Pumpkin Pie Panna Cotta (heavenly!), Chocolate Ganache (for all you dark chocolate lovers) and the Doughnuts. Doughnuts were fun to share as they give you choice of 3 sauces to dip into and they come in good portion to share. Atmosphere is quite nice - chic and cozy, so it was the perfect place for my birthday celebration. I can see myself coming back to try some of their other non-tapas dishes like the branzino. Highly recommended!",0,0,1,Eric K.,"Fort Lee, NJ",260,203,547

2.0,12/6/2018,"Don't book a large group or holiday party here.We brought 30-ish people in for a fixed, multi-course dinner. The portions were tiny, the wait between plates was long, the family-style platters were sparse, and you only got a few bites of each course. We were seated for 90 minutes and still hadn't been served our ""mains.""

3.0,12/2/2018,"Stanton Social, I comment you for being open all of these years and still being quite the popular place. I do feel some of the lackluster may unfortunately be lost though...Ambiance - beautiful ; Upstairs bar- very nice and quaint. I enjoyed being up here the most. Our table - right by the entrance. 3 Crowds of 10ish people all came in at about the same time. They were basically sitting with us.We had 8 of us which was a good size crowd. Here is what we ordered/shared and my husband and my take on each of it:1) Perogi with Onions- super yummy, great flavor and cooked well2) Tuna Tacos - CROWD pleaser and absolutely divine. This was high grade tuna and fresh and flavorful. If I could have only eaten this, I'd be happy3) Arepas - meh. OK. Could have gotten better off the street4) Taquitos - surprisingly well cooked and good. It was friend so hard to really go wrong, but def. the flavor was on point5) Cauliflower - very good, but could have been more tender. This prob. depends on the chef there that nigh6) Meatballs - also a winner in my book - saucy and juicy7) Chicken and Waffles - fail...took one small bite and was like thank you, next8) Mac and Cheese - this was good but WAY too much jalepeno...honestly jalelepno is not even needed. Please remove it9) Fries - crowd pleaser, we loved them10) French Onion Soup dumplings - they were ahhhlright. Nothing too special. This was once the draw of the place and now I just feel like it's commonplace.I've frequented this place many times over the years, and I think after this birthday party for my friend it's time to say goodbye.

5.0,10/21/2018,"I met a girlfriend here for drinks and dinner on a Friday night. Stanton Social did not disappoint! We made an 8:15 reservation but first grabbed a drink at the upstairs bar. The space is beautiful and has great ambiance. Downstairs has high ceilings. The upstairs bar isn't huge -- it felt intimate without feeling too crammed. There's also a lounge area and some tables where folks were eating up there. There was a happy hour happening ($9 red wine and a special cocktail) but I needed something a little stuffed and had an overpriced Manhattan instead ($18). The bartender gave us recommendations on the food so we were ready when it was time to eat! When we went downstairs for our table, our server was warm and friendly (and easy on the eyes!). We shared four of the small plates and couldn't even finish it all. The salmon ceviche is incredible. I could toss back two orders of those babies. The French onion dumplings were unique and tasty but I wasn't as blown away as other reviews have raved. The meatballs also really hit the spot! Get them!!! We also had the chicken and waffles sliders, which were just okay. It was a little dry. Maybe it needed a drizzle of maple syrup (not sure there was anything on there besides just literally chicken and waffle). The chicken had good flavor though and was cooked well.I highly recommend this spot. I can't wait to go back!",1,0,0,Kim M.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,80,47

Our reservation was at 9 but we were not seated until 9:30. Just stood around in a very tight spot even though all 8 of us arrived on time. My favorite thing was the drink called strawberry field.

5.0,10/12/2018,"Visiting from Chicago, this place is exactly what I would have pictured for a typical NYC dinner restaurant. It has a sexy and sophisticated interior and has incredibly flavorful mix of shared plates. The menu is a hodgepodge of different types of items, from pierogies to chicken n waffles to the famous french onion soup dumplings (a must try here!). I went with a group of friends and our eyes were definitely larger than our stomachs and we ended up with too much food. So good luck trying to settle on just a few items because everything legit sounded amazing and it was!They course the plates out for you. We got started with the Beef & Broccoli-one of my favorite things we had. It was a sticky rice cake, covered in the most flavorful braised short rib and a broccoli puree. YUM!My other absolute favorite was the French Onion Soup Dumplings. This is a MUST TRY when you come here. I think I saw every single table had ordered this and with good reason. They come in a mini crock pot type style dish covered in melted cheeses. They are a little tricky to get out but worth the trouble. Absolutely fantastic and love that it is a twist you won't see anywhere else. The Social Mac & Cheese was fantastic as well. Crazy cheesy and covered in bread crumbs with a kick in it as well. We also tried some of the sliders and also the meatballs (good and flavorful but other things were much more intriguing).Overall, a beautiful restaurant with great service and an amazing selection of fun foods with a twist that you most likely won't see anywhere else. Next visit back to New York, this place will definitely be on my list!Tip: You should definitely make reservations to ensure you can get in.

5.0,9/15/2018,"Incredibly unique brunch experience. Instead of each person ordering their own dish like in traditional brunch, people share small breakfast dishes (like tapas), both sweet and savory. It is very affordable relative to other brunch spots in New York City.For dishes, we split the Potato and Goat Cheese Pierogies, the bruschetta, the doughnuts, the oreo pancakes, and the vegetarian slider. the pierogies were easily the best dish with the goat cheese being extremely rich. The bruschetta was also really good with great tomato sauce and a great serving of scrambled eggs. The vegetarian slider was pretty standard - kind of overpriced considering you only get one. The best dish was easily the oreo pancakes (we actually got two of them). The pancake itself is really good - very sweet and rich with a great light oreo taste. Then you mix in the cream and little oreo pieces and syrup (just a little though) and it is like you are walking on air.Would definitely recommend coming here in the future and hopefully I can try to come here next time I visit NYC.",0,1,0,Sampath D.,"San Francisco, CA",382,141,303

The tuna tacos were amazinggggg as well as the fish tacos. I enjoyed the French onion dumplings, I think the concept is cool, but I personally don't like the flavor of French onion soup although I still think this is a special dish and everyone should try it once.

1.0,9/3/2018,"The food I will honestly say was delicious and I would definitely go for the soup dumplings at another sister restaurant. However, the service was incredibly disappointing and the reason why I would not return for any group event due to multiple incidents. First, upon making a reservation we were not informed that it was expected that with large groups they would like us to do a pre-fixe menu. After we were seated and had drinks ordered, this was told. Naturally, 14 girls out to celebrate a birthday did not want to have a four course meal suddenly. This took over a half hour to sort out with the waiter going back and forth with the manager and the manager never taking a second to personally speak with us. Second, multiple people ordered drinks and had to ask repeated times for the drink to still not receive it. For example, I asked for this prior to the meals arriving and did not receive it till much after the food was over. People ultimately started going upstairs at the bar for drinks personally. Third, nearly an extra hundred dollars was added accidentally to our bill. One or two items is understandable on a busy holiday weekend, but 6 items is unacceptable and very unprofessional. Fourth, after several unprofessional incidents, the server had the nerve to pull aside the birthday girl to say that 15% tip was not enough. That is very rude and uncomfortable for her when we clearly were paying for her and the experience was terrible. This was meant to be an enjoyable experience to celebrate a birthday and instead was unnecessarily stressful. With multiple unprofessional incidents, the manager did not even take the time to speak with us.

2.0,8/30/2018,"This review is based on tonight's experience (08/30/2018). When you go to a happy hour you expect to pay less than the original price, that's what happy hour mean right? I saw the big sign outside of the restaurant says happy hour from 5-12 and also quote from one of the hosts ""there is a bar area upstairs and we have happy hours all night long."" We went to upstairs and get seated, the tricky thing is the cocktail server did not mention anything about happy hours menu, we just ordered few drinks from the drink menu, in some cases, you order drinks from regular menu and you pay a different price. Or the server should've warned you or bring you a special happy hours menu. I had learned that they only have margaritas on happy hour's list. Seriously? They expecting me to pay full price for the drinks we should've paid for less. If I want to pay full price which was $16 dollars each , the I would go to somewhere else. It's kind of misleading people, no wonder why it was no busy at all. I think the drinks were pretty good, but I wish someone could've warned me about it, and my friend did.

4.0,8/15/2018,"Bit conflicted about Stanton Social. It's been on the list for so long for those french onion soup dumplings but I wasn't that impressed. It's rather difficult to pull out with just the toothpick and had to use my fork. The cheese hardens quickly. Don't get me wrong - I like french onion soup but it really didn't blow me away. Nice to try though. Chicken taquitos did not win me over either. I should have realized when the waiter thought I wanted tacos instead. Mac and cheese was ok but I probably wouldn't get it again. What I did like though were the pierogis. They were yummy, especially the sauce that came with it. My favorite part of Stanton Social would be the lounge/bar upstairs. Amazing happy hour upstairs Sunday to Friday from 5PM until close. $5 beer, $7 wine, $10 cocktail of the month (mango margarita atm) and $4 snacks/sliders. I'll probably be back here for the happy hour. Another thing important to note - the portions are relatively small. So if you have a big appetite, then don't be surprised by the larger bill.",2,0,2,Manna C.,"New York, NY",319,140,449
5.0,8/13/2018,"Chicken and waffles. Yawn. Chicken and blue corn waffles stuffed with blue cheese? #KaPow! Maybe it's the neighborhood, maybe it was the Restaurant Week thing, or maybe it was the extremely fantastic food that made this one of the best meals I've had in NYC in awhile. We started with goat cheese pirogues, beet salad and fish tacos. All three were great. Seriously large portions. Would have any of them again in a heartbeat.Then we moved to the baby back ribs, salmon and the previously mentioned chicken and waffles. Again, excellent portions and amazing flavor. Finally, the orange creamsicle shot, lemon panna cotta and les doughnuts. I never order panda cotta--and now I definitely won't order it...any where else. It was so good I know I'll just be disappointed anywhere else. The Stanton Social ruined me for panna cotta. The doughnuts were as good as they sound and the orange creamsicle shot was tasty and novel. Service was solid, atmosphere was fun. Not a single negative part of the entire experience. Rare.

4.0,8/13/2018,"So glad i chose this place for celebrating my husand's birthday. the upstairs bar area was quite empty as it was a Tuesday evening and we, being a big group decided to sit there in one of the couches as we also get the happy hour menu till close time there(not in the main dining area downstairs). $5 beers, $7 wines, $4 small bites, its perfect!Our server was the most accommodating lady. She smilingly took our orders and brought out drinks and food quickly. Most of the food  items we tried were pretty good. We went through a whole lot of fries and the chicken and waffle! You definitely shouldn't miss them. Didn't like the shrimp slider as much, but the salmon ceviche and fish taco was really good. The $1 oysters didn't feel to fresh but we still found them decent and ordered quite a few of them. The mini burgers, mac n cheese were also pretty good. I think more than dining this place is perfect if you have a big group. The food items offered are perfect for comfort food and even taste good.

4.0,8/9/2018,"Invite your mom, dad, neighbor, supervisor, your poker buddies, the homeless guy from the train; the more the merrier. This place is not only made for large groups it's encouraged. The menu is based on creative, American style tapas to share amongst the group. We had a group of 8 for restaurant week so we got the fixated menu as well other popular items and cocktails. You such a family feel - you passing plates around the table, taking which one you enjoy, yada yada yada. I assumed because they were tapas if wouldn't be filling but they were surprisingly a lot of leftover. The only tapas i could careless for is the blue cheese waffle which came with the Nashville fried chicken (super dope!) but the waffle tasted sour. I feel probably get shunned by Stanton Socialist but the French Onion soup dumplings were too sweet and concentrated. The hard shell tacos, taquitos and Nashville chicken was by far my favorite bites. The doughnut holes are the perfect way to end a meal.",1,0,0,Johnny G.,"New York, NY",228,267,298
4.0,8/5/2018,"So Chris Santos is one of my favorite celebrity chefs from food network. Whenever I see Chopped After Hours, I just like his style of cooking. It's always comfort with a flare. So when I saw his restaurant on Best Things I Ever Ate, I was sold and had to go. The restaurant has a good flow of guest, so definitely advise bigger parties to get a reservation. We just decided to go upstairs to the bar for their happy hour special even though we had a reservation. I LOVE the bar area, it's definitely more of a lounge with wrap around couches, cool intimate lighting, and also great music selection. We ordered a few things and drinks to start. First, the drinks were meh. I would have expected better flavors, but it seemed watered down. So disappointing there, but the food was awesome. We had the French Onion Soup Dumplings, the Beet Salad, the Salmon Ceviche, Raw Oysters, Meatball Sliders, and Grilled Shrimp Sliders. I would say the best items were the Shrimp Sliders, the Meatball Sliders, and the Beet Salad took the win. But overall, all the dishes were delish. Everything is served like tapas style, so the concept encourages little bites and socializing.

5.0,7/5/2018,"I came here to celebrate my birthday and I must say I had a great time.  It was a last minute decision and I was able to score a table for two at 7pm. As soon as we arrived we were seated at a booth where I could view the entire restaurant. The lights are dimly set and the appearance of this place screams sexy. Our waiter Joe was 5*. He was extremely polite, attentive and gave great suggestions and was able to answer our questions. To say the least he was simply amazing. We were offered an amuse-bouche that was a cold watermelon gazpacho. It was very refreshing and had little pieces of cucumbers. Very goodCocktails:1. Sage Advice- the sage was present in this drink. With the sweetness of the mango2. Mi Gente- for the mezcal lovers. This was refreshing with the use of cucumbers.3. Strawberry Fields- more on the sweet side. Almost like a strawberry daiquiri. It was good and not overpowering. 4  Lost In Polanco- hope you like jalapenos because this is a spicy drink and also really good. As you can tell I love spicy things. The food is mainly served family style which is great so you can get a taste of everything.Food:1. Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos- the tuna was so refreshing. The wontons were crispy. The mango and avocado gave it a sweet and savory  taste. I would get this again.2. French Onion Soup Dumplings- if you love French Onion soup you will love this dish. The dumplings are filled with the onion soup. And topped with baked gruyere cheese and  skewered baked croutons on top. It was good nice and cheese with a pop of the dumpling in your mouth releasing the onion soup onto your taste buds. I wouldn't order it again but I did enjoy it.3. East and West Coast Oysters- very fresh. There was a tequila ice like topping, a mignonette with the regulars. It was really good. I will definitely reorder4. Hand Pulled Chicken Arepas- this dish made my taste buds do the happy dance. The chicken was seasoned to perfection. The avocado and the jalapeno were so good. I didn't think it was overly spicy. It was just right. I would order this again in a heartbeat.5. Spiced Sesame Salmon- this was made to your desired specifications and it was cooked to perfection. The flavors were great. Unfortunately, the radish and cucumber were a bit salty underneath. I'm not a salmon fan but it was good and I would recommend it.I definitely enjoyed this place. The atmosphere, food, drinks and service were all on point. We were given a drink on the house due to the saltiness in my salmon dish.

2.0,6/18/2018,"I guess I standby ""trendy"" or ""once trendy"" places as being a hard pass after going here. The service was very good. The soup dumplings tasty....the arepa was amazing per my BF, but the rest was a little underwhelming. The cocktails were delish...probably better than the food, IMO. At $16/pop, be aware. I don't mind paying for quality, but not when it feels pedestrian. To add, the decor is painfully outdated, too. In the LES....you can def. do better than Stanton Social. Breakdown:Arepa, tacos, cheesburger slider, veggie slider, caprese ravioli, cauilflower with ghost chili ( not even close to being spicy, BTW), chicken and waffles, onion soup dumplings.

Honestly, every bite of every dish was so packed with flavor, but my favorite were the Korean tacos. I have never had a bite of food that combined taste and texture so well.

2.0,5/29/2018,"When Stanton Social opened a few years ago, it was among the trendiest in the city. The crowd was young, attractive and affluent. The food was creative and trendy. Reservations where hard to come by. Alas, those days are over and Socal has fallen into the eventual abyss of older, not so attractive and still affluent clientele. The food is creative but varies between dishes in quality and the trendiness? Gone. The signature Tuna poke was good as were the French onion soup dumplings. Those are the most common items ordered on their menu and they're still still solid and fun. The Korean tacos were also good with a defined kimchi flavor, good. The charred octopus was awful, we left most on the plate. It was  overwhelmed with discordant flavors including a lamb and lime flavor. Not good. The chicken (fried) & waffles had a mushy layer of breading that was nothing more than a mask for overcooked meat and further mushy waffle. While the service was good and the server was young, fun & beautiful, I can no longer recommend this LES/SoHo classic.

The small plates-style menu is supremely appetizing, and expertly executed.  The hardest part about going to Stanton Social is winnowing down your choices from a menu where EVERYTHING sounds so good.  And the wait staff couldn't be nicer, and more pleasant.  Everyone is friendly and welcoming. I've had an amazing, Friday night dinner here. Where the atmosphere is stylish and sexy, up on the third floor where the music plays loud enough where you have to lean in and get close to talk, and the incandescent lighting lends itself to a modern romantic atmosphere. And each craft cocktail tastes better than the last. I've also had a lovely, leisurely brunch where sunlight fills the main floor dining room, while delicious dishes like the croque monsieur satays and pillowy goat cheese pierogies fill my belly.  From the high-brow taquitos to the sherry-tinged French onion soup dumplings, each dish impresses without pretension.  It's food that most everyone would want to eat, done with the level of precision that stuffier restaurants boast, in an atmosphere that is young and fun.

I'm a huge french onion soup fan and these did not disappoint. The ratio of cheese, croutons, onion, and broth was perfect. I have been dreaming of them since. That was the best dish by far. Other than that, the dishes weren't anything incredible. The tuna tartare tacos were pretty good but I've had better tuna tartare. The popcorn shrimp was fun but again, not the best I've had. Lost a star for the cramped atmosphere. We got lucky with our own booth, but it seems, in general, the seating is pretty cramped. I guess such is typical for the LES, but I'd still be wary if coming here for a formal date night or special occasion.

4.0,5/1/2018,"Planned a weeknight work event here a few weeks ago in their semi private upstairs room, which is a wine balcony. Had a good experience working with the planner for the space, I was tasked with planning an event for Wednesday the Monday before, and she was super accommodating and responsive and we figured everything out easily even though it was pretty last minute. The fixed menu for groups is a pretty great deal, and everyone will leave full of delicious food. Some highlights were the ahi tuna taco's, the french onion soup dumplings, and the philly cheesesteaks, but honestly everything we got was delicious, fresh, and largely portioned! The cocktail menu is also great, and they had a nice wine selection, so everyone was happy with the drinks. My one frustration and reason for removing a star was that we had one waitress for a group of 15, and there were multiple times where she seemed unable to handle the amount of stuff going on. Not her fault at all, and there were a few people who helped her serve a couple times, but as we were an active and lively bunch, I felt at least having an assistant waiter assigned to assist her regularly would have been helpful. There were a few times where we had to wait a slightly annoying amount of time for drinks, to order drinks, or for plates to be cleared, and when spending a couple thousand at a restaurant you reserved an event space in I expect more.

We settled on 5: the beef wellington, chicken arepas, salmon ceviche, lolli-popcorn shrimp, and brussels sprout ravioli. Everything was delicious. I came because I wanted to try the beef wellington, which was top notch, but I especially loved the ravioli. Portions are small but the quality of food is great. We are big eaters so 6 plates would have probably been better. The lighting is quite dim, so dim people at the tables next to us were using their phones to shine light on the food to see what they were eating. At a place that so values its high quality ingredients and presentation, you think they'd turn the dimmer up slightly so patrons can see the food! The only other observation I'd make is where these plates are meant to be shared it would be helpful to know how many of each item are coming. Some came with four on each plate and others three. Hard to know how to share food in odd and even numbered groups. Also, I've read a lot of reviews here that say the service is poor.

I came with a party of 5 and was advised to order about 10 dishes. We did, then got more and it was way too much food, but it was fun and delicious all the same.The SPOT:When I walked in at 6:30, it was totally empty, but by the end of the meal the place was totally packed. The location is great and the interior is super trendy.The SERVICE: Our waitress was awesome, super helpful with suggestions and attentive. The only real issue we had with the service was that they attempted to switch out our plates for fresh ones in the middle of one of the courses. We declined, but allowed them to do it before the next course started. They cleared our plates, but then the food was dropped off and we still had to wait for our new, clean plates. Womp womp. Also, our waiter had a trainee waiter following behind her. I assumed that was the story, but some of the people in my party would've really appreciated an explanation earlier in the meal. Oh well.The FOOD:1. Potato & Goat Cheese - what could be bad about these? Plus the truffle creme fraiche it's served with was delicious and I totally used it on my lolli-popcorn shrimp. (See # 8)2. House Salad - The avocado green goddess was herby and fun. (On a personal note, the beet salad sounded way more interesting, but others at the table don't eat beets,) but overall it was a nice salad with great depth of flavor.3. French Onion Soup Dumplings - They warn you these are hot. You should listen. I didn't and it burnt my tongue, but being the birthday girl I got to have the leftover dumpling and have a redo. They're really yummy. (Much preferred to the Beauty & Essex sister restaurant version of the tomato soup with grilled cheese croutons.)4. Crispy Barrio-Style Chicken Taquitos - I didn't have high expectations for this dish, but it wound up being one of my favorites. They look like they're sitting in a pool of sriracha, but it's actually a very mild red sauce. The avocado and crema on top really compliment the dish.5. Hand Pulled Chicken Arepas - As someone dating a Venezuelan, I have high standards for arepas, which I suppose on second thought isn't super fair of me. But these weren't at all what I was expecting. These were more like tacos. I liked them, but they totally aren't mini-arepas.6. Korean Tacos - these have a very subtle kick. Everyone was worried about the heat from the kimchi, but again the kimchi was super mild. But these have a nice sweet tang to them. I enjoyed it immensely.7. Beef & Broccoli - this was one of my favorites of the evening. The broccoli puree is barely noticeable. And the short rib is super tasty.8. Lolli-Popcorn Shrimp - definitely my least favorite dish, but they weren't terrible. The shrimp was just a bit tough to chomp on. I also wasn't crazy about the different dipping sauces, but that truffle creme fraiche was bomb and I was very happy to still have it on my plate.9. Old School Meatballs - These were so yummy. So, so, so yummy. I haven't had a meatball that compares to these in a very long time.10. Chicken n' Waffles - The chicken is spicy. It does say that it's Nashville hot fried chicken on the menu, so maybe we should've been prepared, but as it was not drenched in hot sauce like I am used to, I wasn't totally prepared for it, but it was yummy. The waffles were soft and tasty, but my favorite part was the pickle garnish, heheh.Now, without realizing this, I had made a reservation at a restaurant that one of my dining companions had a familial connection to. What a lucky coincidence! He sent over two more dishes (and dessert!)11. Brussels Sprout Ravioli - I looooovveee brussels sprouts and cranberries. These were excellent, but very rich.12. Social Mac & Cheese - This was excellent, but definitely rich and a bit spicy too. Plus mac n cheese topped with breadcrumbs seems like a wasted opportunity for cheesy goodness, but I still liked this dish a lot. It's nice to hide veggies in. And if this was more of a traditional resto I probably would have ordered this as a side to what we were eating, but when there're so many other goodies...Dessert was super fun, I had to get the birthdy cake milkshake shot, which is lined with birthday sprinkles. Fun! Cute! Boozy!They brought me a birthday cupcake, which didn't look like anything exciting, but the cake was so decadent and it had key lime icing. YUMMMMM!They brought out two chocolate panna cottas, super delightful and rich!And the LES doughnuts!!! Yummy. Plus the waitress made me feel vindicated when she said everyone winds up eating the accompanying sauces with a spoon when they run out of donuts.Overall, super fun night.

1.0,3/1/2018,"Great food, cool atmosphere, but boy do they have no idea how to treat their customers. This is obviously a super popular place because it was extremely busy when we went on a Saturday night recently. I went there  with five friends (six of us total). We had made a reservation for 9 PM a few weeks in advance. We got there at 8 PM and went upstairs for some drinks. 9 PM rolls around and we hear nothing from the hostess. After 10-15 minutes we went downstairs and they didn't really tell us anything, just that they would text us when the table was ready. Fast-forward to 9:45 PM and we are still upstairs and we still haven't heard anything from the hostess. We were finally seated around 10 PM an hour after our reservation.This normally wouldn't bother me too much as long as the hostess/server were gracious and apologetic but they were not apologetic whatsoever. They gave us each a shot glass full of carrot soup on the house but it was brought out by a bus boy and there was no acknowledgement of the fact that they had kept us waiting for an hour. I could be wrong but I think making a guest wait for an hour deserves a bottle of champagne. If they had done something like that I would never be writing this.There were also some other issue. After all of that the table that they sat us at was at the very front of the restaurant. The restaurant was packed so it felt like there was a crowd standing around us for most of the meal. It was also so near the door that it was constantly cold as people went in and out (this was in February so it was in the 30s outside).Between the six of us we ended up spending $250 on drinks upstairs and another $550 on the meal. With that kind of cost I expect more.",0,0,0,Sky K.,"San Francisco, CA",238,2,0

I had a vodka martini (extra dirty, of course), the scallops (which were out of this world!), the salmon filets, and one other dish that wasn't too memorable.Although they are tapas style/small plates, they were pretty generous in portions in comparison to other similar restaurants.

Now let me preface the review with the fact that it isnt inexpensive but you have to pay for quality and in my opinion is well worth it.We tried a whole bunch of stuff. The cheeseburger sliders were ridiculous. The tuna tacos incredible. The korean tacos were probably my favorite item. I also liked the buffalo cauliflower because they had the great buffalo flavor as well as a nice crunch. Food was insane. Thats all I can say.  The only thing I did not care for was the flatbread. It had a little bit of a funky taste to it. The drinks were not up to par to be honest. I ordered an old fashioned and it was NOT made correctly. I switched to a regular mixed drink after that. The people I was with liked the cocktails they ordered off the menu but seems like if you steer away from the menu they struggle.Overall, this was a great experience.

5.0,2/19/2018,This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city! The complementary carrot soup is really good. The chicken and waffles were spicy but really good. The fish tacos were also very good as well. The beet salad was just ok. The house salad was good. The pierogis were some of the best I ever had ! The chicken arepas were very good but the chicken taquitos weren't anything special. The Korean tacos were a little spicy but very good. The Mac and cheese was a heavy disappointment it could have used more cheese on top. The green beans were good. The cauliflower was crispy it was my favorite side. The Philly cheesesteak sliders were on point. My favorite dishes were the ahi tuna poke tacos which had a nice crunchy shell and the cheesey French onion soup dumplings!

You may still have to wait a little, but it is definitely worth the wait. Came for an early dinner, later dinner and drinks - both food and drinks are amazing. Loved the lobster roll, kobe beef sliders and pierogies. Super romantic location which is perfect for date night, girls night out and a small group get together.

They honored our reservation, but I didn't understand why they even had that time slot open. They never rushes us and the service was excellent but we felt bad keeping the entire staff there as we finished eating, the only remaining patrons too. It was awkward but thank goodness the food was beyond amazing. Everything we has was next level good and the table set up with high booth was really a great experience.

I have to give two stars however because we were seated an hour and 15 minutes AFTER our reservation. The hostess, although she was clearly being pulled in 10 different directions, was very rude to us. We kept  being told we would be seated shortly every 20 minutes and told to wait upstairs because it was too busy downstairs. Well it was too busy upstairs as well and the drinks that we begrudgingly bought during our wait were very expensive. My guess is that management knows exactly what theyre doing, in that forcing people to wait and buy expensive drinks and order more food once seated because of the additional hunger.I would definitely not go back on a weekend. I would consider a Monday night only because the food was good but I will not stay longer than 15 minutes past my reservation.",0,0,0,Aaron B.,"Rockville, MD",0,4,0
1.0,2/11/2018,"This place is a DISASTER! I made dinner reservations for my friend's birthday and it was also winter restaurant week. We were 15 minutes late. So they decided to seat us by the freezing entrance area. I specifically told the waiter that it was a friend's birthday (from opentable too) and that I wanted a candle on her dessert. They COMPLETELY FORGOT. HUGE embarrassing moment when we had to get up and tell the waiter that he forgot. So he brought out an extra cupcake WHILE we were eating dessert WITH THE CHECK. who in the right mind does that?I was furious. He kept rushing us to finish and we didn't even get a proper celebration. First course:- Chicken taquitos: Boring. - Potato & goat cheese pierogies: My favorite but I love cheese and potato. My friends hated it. You could barely taste the truffle as described. - Fish tacos: Missing the ""creamy avocado"" Fish was like a puree. Couldn't tell. It tasted decent. Second course: - Fried chicken & waffles: Chicken was nicely fried and spicy. The waffles were very dry.. no one touched it. - Brussel sprouts ravioli: PLEASE DO NOT GET. It came in 3 tiny pieces. I felt that it was undercooked. I love brussel sprouts and this dish just didn't work. - Sesame spiced salmon: The seasoning they had on top was extremely salty and the fish itself was bland. The sprouts did not help and the sauce tasted like big mac......Third course:- Chocolate panna cotta: Tasted exactly like jello's chocolate pudding. - Guinesss toffee cake: The baileys ice cream was very good. The toffee cake was spongy and sweet. - Les doughnuts: What is the hype about this?

I wouldn't get this again.-beef and broccoli: cool concept but the beef was way too salty. We weren't able to eat the whole dish-French onion soup dumplings*: these were great. They're a little hot at first but the caramelized onions and cheese are a perfect combo.Beef Wellington: it is definitely a hard dish to make and the beef was cooked well but the dough was still a little raw on the inside. Also the sauce and mushrooms were very salty-crab cake slider: nothing special about it, bacon tasted like it was caramelized and didn't go well with the dish -birthday shot: cool concept, don't think I would get it again-doughnuts: amazingWe also really enjoyed the drinks (strawberry fields, mulled wine, old fashioned) although a little pricey",0,0,0,Melissa P.,"New York, NY",131,354,692

To start off, we ordered the Crispy Hard Shell Fish Tacos and my brother opted for the Crispy Barrio Style Chicken Taquitos. I didn't try it (it's one taquito sliced into 4 pieces) but the tacos were out of this world. Super crispy indeed and so delicious! Definitely recommend.For the main course I had the 'Chicken and Waffles'. The presentation was beautiful, definitely not what you'd expect but still so yummy. The chicken was juicy and the waffles complimented them well. I wasn't a big fan of the blue cheese on the bottom but it didn't ruin the dish whatsoever. My parents ordered the Sesame Spiced Salmon which had me wishing I had ordered it myself -- unbelievably tasty! Only thing I'd say about that is don't expect for it to be filling, as the side is some sort of veggie noodle type of thing that was no more than a spoonful. Finally, for dessert I had ""Les Doughnuts"" which were so soft, warm and went perfectly with the 3 dipping sauces. My parents got the Guinness Toffee Cake which tasted like a super chocolatey brownie (aka divine).

But we really wanted to try this place so we got a cozy booth and asked our waiter for his opinions on what we order. He told us we could split 3 or 4 things between the two of us and that would be enough. So we ordered three things to split between us (we each got a slider, the croquet monsieur and the French onion soup bites). We also both got drinks, I order the mimosa and my friend got a coffee drink.Her coffee drink was incredible and I would highly recommend, but I didn't care for my mimosa (gasp...I know...right?). The little ham and cheese sandwiches and my burger slider were also phenomenal, but I wasn't a fan of the French onion soup - but that is just a preference. Because our food took so long to come out they also brought us some small potato pancakes which were perfect and crispy.Overall I thought this place was cute, but nothing to rave about for lunch.

2.0,1/29/2018,"Given the hype around this place I came in with very high expectations. Unfortunately I left pretty disappointed.Went on a Sunday night for dinner. Made a reservation but didn't seem to need one as the place was about half full. Nice atmosphere and decor, and all the staff was friendly, attentive and overall above average from a service perspective.Now for the food. As it is a 'small plates' style place we went for 4 plates and dessert. We got the Korean style tacos, the french onion soup dumplings, the chicken arepas and the goat cheese pierogies.Far and away the best dish was the goat cheese pierogies. These were phenomenal and came with a truffle dipping sauce which was spectacular. Unfortunately, after the pierogies which came out first, the dishes were downhill from there. The chicken arepas are a pulled chicken with a green salsa and a jalapeno. Outside of the hot pepper, these seemed to lack flavor and was a tiny portion for the $15 price point. The korean tacos weren't bad by any means, however the steak didn't have a very noticeable marinade or flavor, so the steak was somewhat overpowered by the kimchi. And for the french onion soup dumplings, this is a really cool concept and looks awesome. I just didn't think that the actual taste matches up anywhere near the visual aspects of the dish. What I personally enjoy about soup dumplings (the typical kind) is the explosion of broth when you take a bite. These soup dumplings are breaded so the broth is mostly absorbed by the bread, so it doesn't feel too much like a ""soup"" at all. Also the cheese was mostly burned to the point of being hard, so it also lacked the gooey gruyere aspect of french onion soup that I love. Overall, I think that this dish is super unique, but unfortunately from a taste perspective it just wasn't there for me. This place is undeniably unique, and the service / attention to detail is well above average. In my experience, however, the food simply did not match up to the price point and reputation of the restaurant.",1,0,0,Mike N.,"New York, NY",144,283,75

From the moment we walked in and were greeted by the especially nasty hostess, who informed us that we would need to start ordering ""right away,"" (in spite of having a reservation), to the waitress who was nice enough, but could not get our orders straight (bringing Kobe burgers instead of vegetarian burgers, among other flubs such as forgetting to bring a drink altogether), this restaurant engendered nothing but irritation from all 7 of us. Granted we were a crew who is accustomed to very good dining experiences, and we had a few vegetarians in our crowd, but I cannot recall another evening where 3 people at the table were so hungry and hated the food so much that they GOT UP TO DOWN THE STREET TO GET PIZZA during the meal. The confusing menu was probably meant to be eclectic, but was just weird-(sort of a mish mash/Americanized version of Tapas, or tasting plates), (most unorganized menu ever)- no one felt adequately fed, and while the restaurant touts the ""music"" as being a perk, trying to have a conversation over Michael Jackson and Prince at full volume (much as I love those musicians) was futile and frustrating. I have been to many restaurants in that neighborhood and would pick even a good hole in the wall over this hot mess. It tries hard to be a hip, young, vibrant NYC restaurant, and falls flat in every important way.",0,0,0,Lori L.,"Lodi, NJ",0,2,0
4.0,1/8/2018,"One of my favorite restaurants in New York! I usually suffer from debilitating indecisiveness when presented with a menu, and thus small plates restaurants like Stanton Social, where you can try a little bit of everything, are ideal for me. I also tend to love anything created by executive chef Chris Santos, who has an incredible gift when it comes to combining flavors. I've been here countless times and tried most of the vegetarian items on the menu, plus some of the non-vegetarian items modified (for example, you can get the mac and cheese without the Italian sausage). My absolute favorite thing on the menu, which I get every single time without fail, are the pierogies. They come with a truffle creme fraiche that is delicious beyond words, and are a definite must-try. Other favorites include the french onion soup dumplings (I was skeptical towards these and didn't try them until my third time here, only to regret waiting so long!) and the ravioli (especially the Mexican street corn ravioli, as they tend to rotate the flavors depending on the season). For dessert, I have the birthday cake shot every single time, though the other desserts also look amazing. I've heard people complain that this place is pretentious and 'sceney', and though I personally don't find it that way, they do play the music quite loud which makes it a little difficult to carry a conversation. I've also had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table on several occasions in spite of being on-time for my reservation, which is annoying only because they make you wait upstairs in the bar area and I'm not a huge fan of traipsing up and down precariously steep stairs in high heels. However, at the end of the day, the food is so good that it's more than worth tolerating the overly loud music and potential wait time for.",0,0,0,Linn G.,"New York, NY",23,6,7

I could have eaten five orders (4-5 dumplings each) by myself. Next best was the brussels sprouts ravioli which were absolutely delicious. The crispy hard shell fish tacos were very standard; you could get these anywhere. Same goes for the shrimp tempura sticks that came with three dipping sauces- very standard nothing outstanding. Although, the server never explained what the sauces were. As for the dessert portion of the meal, the cookies were soooo delicious. I wish I brought some home with me!

3.0,1/3/2018,"This a pretty nice place to have a date or hang with a group. The atmosphere and decor gave off an elegant appearance without being too trendy. The Tao Group usually does a great job ambiance. Good service from the staff. As far as the food, it may be more for those with an acquired taste. I like to try new and different meals but my girlfriend is a very picky eater, so the way the food was prepared didn't quite meet her likings even though she still enjoyed the experience. I ordered the ""Rhode Island Lobster Roll w/ fries"", ""The Staton Social Beef Wellington"", ""Social Mac & Cheese"", while my girlfriend had the ""Dry Rubbed Barbeque Heritage Baby Back Ribs"". For dessert we had ""Birthday Cake Milkshake Shots"" and Oreo Yodels (which I believe is no longer on the menu). Even though I enjoyed the food, I didn't care for how the beef Wellington is prepared. It pastry seemed to have too much space between. I'm accustomed to the pastry wrapping being ""tightly"" baked around the steak filet. So I ultimately just broke the pastry from around the steak and ate. The barberque ribs were very tender and would fall off the bone. I thought that they were good but my girlfriend (the picky eater) thought that the texture was too soft and kinda grossed her out. I still ate it!!!!...LOL...With that being said it's just best to know what you'd DEFINITELY enjoy eating and how it should be prepared.

4.0,12/14/2017,"Four stars rather than five:- You know the feeling when you walk into a restaurant and it feels like that restaurant and its staff take themselves very seriously? Stanton Social positions itself as a fancy dining establishment, but that posture felt a little fake/contrived.- You really and truly cannot get a healthy dish in this place. I have to eat out a lot when I'm in NYC, so I try to eat pretty clean -- soups, salads -- to avoid the inevitable ongoing feeling of Oh-my-god-I-can't-believe-I'm-still-full-from-last-night's-meal. At SS, I ordered anything that sounded vaguely like a plate of healthy veggies. What I actually got was either deep-fried, or packed inside of little donutty pastries, or covered in cheese. If you are trying to not overeat, go somewhere else.- Holy heck does it get loud. We arrived on the early side, right when they opened. By the time we left, the place was completely packed and we were shouting at each other to be heard. If you need to have an intimate conversation, go early and leave early. If you don't care, then go have fun.Those are the drawbacks. On the positive side, man is the food good. Everything we ordered was better than expected.

4.0,11/28/2017,"Some of the tastiest food I've eaten in NYC, hands down. After searching far and wide for the perfect restaurant, I took my girlfriend here for her birthday dinner earlier this month. They've got a lot of space with multiple floors, but even on a Wednesday night this place packed out, so I was happy I made a reservation. KEEP IN MIND: portions here are small, especially for the price. They recommended that we order four dishes for two people.The Stanton Social is the product of Chef / Owner Chris Santos, who some may recognize as one of the judges on the Food Network show Chopped. The food is creative and consists of small plates that are meant for sharing.My girlfriend and I decided we would do things a little different and started with the "" Birthday Cake Milkshake Shots"", which consisted of birthday cake ice cream and Maker's Mark bourbon in a tall shot glass, topped with sprinkles. They were tasty, unique, and got things started on the right foot.For our mains, we went with the French Onion Soup Dumplings, Old School Meatballs, and the Beef Wellington. Everything was fantastic - the French Onion Soup Dumplings were steaming hot, topped with melted cheese, and were basically flavor bombs once you bit into them. The Meatballs, in my opinion, were the least remarkable. They were certainly tasty, but there was nothing too special about them. The Beef Wellington was far and away the favorite of both my girlfriend and I. The flavor was astounding and it was made perfectly. I hesitantly accept that The Stanton Social has made me a huge fan of Beef Wellington, while also acknowledging that I won't be able to find it often and when I do, it'll be expensive.This would definitely be five stars if not for the price. I completely understand that it comes with the territory - a popular Manhattan restaurant run by a celebrity chef. That's why we saved it for a special occasion. I know the dishes are meant to be shareable, but they're expensive for the portion sizes. I will know that I've made it in life when I can charge $16 for two meatballs.

1.0,11/20/2017,"Let me preface this by saying that I never write reviews- but the experience my friends/family and I had here made me almost forced to write one. Firstly, I called the restaurant and visited them earlier that day to drop off a cake for that evening. It was a friend's birthday and I told the hostess that it was a special occasion. She said she would mark that in her notes and would be sure to ""make it special."" Our party of six arrived at 9:20pm for our 9:30pm reservation. The hostess said that our table wasn't ready yet, but to go upstairs to the bar and she would text me when the table was ready. At around 10:10pm, I still had not received a text, so I decided I should go down and ask the hostess how long she thought until we got seated. However, the bouncer quite rudely wouldn't allow me back into the main restaurant area without proof of a text that said my table was ready, and when I told him we had been waiting over 45 minutes for our table, he shrugged and said, ""You just gotta keep waiting."" Not until 10:45 did we receive a text, and we were basically stuck at the very crowded bar not able to leave until the confirmation of our table being ready allowed us back into the restaurant. When we finally were seated (again, we had waited over an hour and 15 minutes to get our table), it took over 40 minutes for our food to come once we had placed our orders. When I went up to the waiter privately to ask him about the cake that I had brought earlier that day (to which the hostess had said she would let the waiter know about it), he was very confused and thought that the cake was lost. Finally, he brought out the cake, but that was after 30 minutes of us being done with dinner and just sitting at the table. If they had been more accommodating to us, or even been nicer about us waiting so long for a table, I wouldn't have written a review. It was the absolute hostility of everyone in the restaurant, and the clear sense that they were better then us when we were paying a good amount of money to eat there was just ridiculous.

I'm easy going, but I've read other reviews and that seems to be an ongoing issue, the seating staff needs to get their ishhh together. Now for the negative! One word: desert. We ordered Oreo pops, milk shake shot, and doughnuts. I don't even want to delve too far into it, because it was such a disappointment to a perfect dinner. But Oreo pops tasted like they were premade, refrigerated, and dropped on your plate for $16 for 3. Literally can't believe they serve these here. Doughnuts were just pieces of friend dough. Some chocolate and caramel dipping sauce. Common guys! Where's the flavor and creativity! This is not Stanton social. Milk shake shots were a weird combo of whisky and milk shake - they didn't work. Overall a strong 4 stars, this place rocks.",0,0,0,Jon L.,"Brooklyn, NY",182,144,350

4.0,10/2/2017,"Saturday night w reservation for 8pm, sat about 8:40. Inside is a cool hip place. Initially quite warm and we asked them to make it cooler, which they actually did, which was pretty amazing. Server was good. Started w a bottle of Forever Young wine, suggested by the server, which we enjoyed. Tapas: -Tuna poke tacos: crunchy, flavorful, tasty-Salmon ceviche: on a spoon, fairly creamy, fine but blander than I expected -French Onion Soup Dumplings: unhealthily delicious - you can see why everyone gets these -Reuben quesadillas: flavorful, crispy, quite tasty-Kobe beef sliders: first, I think Kobe beef is overrated nonsense, second, these were quite good - not worth $8 for a single slider, but tasty-Meatballs: okay, surprisingly a bit bland-Chorizo Mac & Cheese: crunchy, a bit spicy, quite niceFood was great",1,0,0,Corey L.,"Manchester-by-the-Sea, MA",61,799,19
4.0,9/28/2017,"The beef and broccoli will blow your mind, thank me later. I've been here twice and never have left disappointed, the food/bites are incredibly delicious and full of flavor and texture. The food is meant to be shared, and it's one of those places where you'll have your bite/small serving and instantly regret not having more to eat. For example, the salmon ceviche in coconut milk - served in large spoons - it's like a little bit of you deflates when your spoon is empty. This ceviche is inventive and nothing like what you'll get at traditional Mexican or Peruvian restaurants, it's all it's own. Get it.The cobb salad bites in little mini bacon bowls, wow, get them. Again, all the flavors are so rich and you just get a few bites and it's rather tortuous. We also ordered the BLT flatbread that comes with lamb bacon and arugula for the lettuce. It was maybe the only menu item we had that was a bit lacking, as to what, I'd say some sort of creamy sauce, like perhaps a twist on a tzaziki sauce would have been a nice a touch. It just needed a little more pizzazz to stand up to the other items. Oh and back to the beef and broccoli - this is absolutely delectable. The beef (braised short rib) is so tender and melt-in-your-mouth quality, the broccoli is pureed and then the rice is shaped into little chewy discs as the conduit. Okay and lastly, the pierogis are so rich, like you feel as though the center is a thick buttery cheese filling, which it essentially is.For drinks - I'm sorry I don't have much to tell you, have only had glasses of wine that are suitable and fine. I'd say get a cocktail which I'm sure are better than the glasses of wine because they will be crafted in a similar manner to the unique menu items.One thing I can't figure out is, why on a Friday night at 10 you can just walk-in and get seated but the majority of the other restaurants in busy LES have long waits. That's a mystery to me, after my second time going I'm surprised. Perhaps it's the shareable menu and the items are tapa-sized? Lots of different cuisines packed into an inventive menu, can't go wrong, I think you should go. Shoutout to whoever makes the playlists too, love the mix of tunes, even heard Despacito.",0,0,0,Emily R.,"Brooklyn, NY",26,16,3

Called the restaurant explained to them our situation and was informed to just get there when we could. Finally arrived at 8:30 and the hostess was nothing but amazing. Not only were they super understanding about the traffic but they also sat us within five minutes. Once we were seated that's when the fun began. The food here is hands down some of the best I've had. I'm a huge fan of tapas style food because I like to try a little bit of everything so coming here was perfect for me and my group. We ordered the chicken and waffles, French onion soup dumplings, beef and broccoli, social mac n' cheese, and the chicken taquitos. I can't say out of all that food one thing was bad. One thing was better than the next. My personal favorite was the mac n' cheese and the chicken and waffles. I probably talked about this place for a solid month after my dining experience here.

The time between each food was brought out was either very well planned or they got lucky. We had a wonderful time eating and chatting. What disappointed me was that they did nothing to fix one of our wobbly tables. In addition, the cocktails were horrendous. We sent back the one that tasted like Red Bull with cough syrup. I'm sorry but when you are a decent place and charge 15 for a drink make it well. Don't just throw something together and expect people to drink it for the sake of it. The food is just yumm! So is their coffee. The donuts with fudge sauce were warm and delicious and their sugar on top was just the right amount. Their banana pancakes were delicious. I loved their beef burgers (more like sliders). Nice flavors and good bun and meat. There was a breakfast bruschetta as well. I mean you cannot go wrong with this right! Nice eggs on top, nice seasoning, tomatoes on a toasted bread. We did order some dessert. None of them wow-ed me really. Except maybe for the chocolate souffle. I personally don't like oreo cake pops so won't comment. The almond spice cake was extremely cinnamon-y. Will I go back here? Just for food, definitely.

4.0,9/2/2017,"Small plates and brunch doesn't seem like an amicable combo, but Stanton Social definitely lives up to the expectation. We went for bottomless brunch and loved the number of unique mimosa-esque options that were available to be chosen. It sucks that they don't refill your cup whenever your empty and instead have to flag down the waiter every time you need a new glass. The coffee was my favorite of the bottomless cocktails. The food was great. Unfortunately the French Onion Soup Dumplings weren't vegetarian because I think I saw that in every single review of this place. We settled for the Oreo pancakes which were amazing. We went with 4 people and having 5 pancakes was not ideal but we made it work. Definitely get the pancakes when you are here along with the dumplings if you aren't vegetarian.We also got the cinnamon sticks and the goat cheese pierogies. The pierogies were also absolutely great. A bit hot at first but once it cools down, they are amazing. Finally, to at least fill ourselves up, we ordered the Smoked Tomato Pizzeta and the two meat-eaters in our group ordered another pizzeta. The pizzeta is perfect to split with one other person and gets you full. Ordering at tapas places is hard and with 4 people, 3 small plates and two pizzetas seemed to be enough food. There is still a lot left to explore on the brunch menu, but being a little pricey, I don't know how many times I will be back.

Quick notes:- They serve their meals family style.- They require a $400 minimum for large parties reserving a table in the upstairs lounge. - For a $15 drink, their house whiskey was trash. - They serve sliders individually. WEIRD. However, I had the lobster roll slider and was impressed with how stuffed the roll was. It also came with chips that were seasoned with what tasted like Old Bay seasoning. It was $11, and I think that price was comparable to full sized lobster rolls. - I tried that infamous fig cocktail and thought it was pretty good.

I was scouring the restaurant week website, looked through menus, and not just looked through the menu for restaurant week, but on my phone, checked out the yelp reviews for the place. I aint going anywhere that my yelpers don't approve of. Hell no.  Settled on The Stanton Social  (duh). Ooh.. the place is faaaancy. I was seated right away. Since we wanted to try food that wasn't on the restaurant week menu. we chose that we did 1 of restaurant week menu, and then ordered stuff off the regular menu.What we had: - Cobb Salad Bites: A little bit of yumminess that had bleu cheese, bacon, avocado.. ahhh.- Tuna Tartare tacos - Loved them! The fish was really fresh, and this was one of my favorite dishes. I want one NOW.- Chicken and waffles. Sounds so simple that I didn't want to order it. Although after reading reviews, I tried it. Best chicken and waffles ever. This is not like drumsticks and those typical waffles. This is chicken breast, on top of a delicious corn spread, on top of waffle yumminess. It was so balanced. A bigger portion than the other foods, ooh, I want one of that too like right now. - Beef wellington - The outside was perfectly crispy pastry dough, and the mushrooms inside were so good with the perfectly tender meat, cooked medium rare.- French Onion Soup Dumplings. Again, Dumplings are my thang, but never have I had dumplings like these. They come in a little bowl with 6 holes in them. I'd think it was made for deviled eggs or something. With dumplings filled with onions cooked for hours. They can be really hot, so be careful. This is something special. A must order!- Doughnuts with dipping sauce for dessert. So good. If I wasn't so full, I'd just dip my fingers in the sauce and finish it even when I was done with the donuts. The donuts were soft and delicious. Oh, and of course, Drinks. I had the Lost in Polanco - a spicy choice. It is Jalapeño-infused Maestro Dobel, blood orange juice, fresh lime, Cointreau and Smoke Signal, which is also spicy and acidic. So good. Ok.

3.0,8/11/2017,"When I booked this place, I had such high hopes from all the reviews. Sadly, I think the hype far outweighed the reality. To start, we showed up on time for our dinner, only to be told that our table was not ready. When I asked how long it would be, I was told that there is no definite time. To make matters worse, there was a private party at the bar upstairs, and we couldn't even get drinks or food up there. When I asked what we can do about food, as it was already late with several of us hungry, the hostess suggested going somewhere else to grab a bite until she texted me to signal our table being ready. WHAT?We decided to tough it out for 30 minutes for the upstairs bar to clear the private party. 45 minutes later, the security guard let us up, but even though we were the first ones going up the front stairs, the bar was not empty (curious). The music was not just loud--it was oppressive. When I explained our conundrum to the lead waitress, she appeared sympathetic and stated we can order but didn't offer us a table to sit down. In the meantime, the music got LOUDER, much more than in a club, but our orders of appetizers did show up, along with drinks. A while afterwards, the music level went back to the initial level, and our table was ready. We sat in a plush cozy half-circle couch of a table. The music level in the main dining room was more bearable, but still loud. We still had to raise our voices to be heard across the table. The food, while innovative in concept, was often poor in execution. Our waitress also forgot about our drink orders in the middle of the meal for well over 30 minutes. Here is a rundown on the food:Lobster slider: taste ok, found two shells in the roll. We let the lead waitress know.  No response. Goat cheese pierogi: this was a good dish. Very tasty. French onion dumplings: innovative presentation, not special in taste Kobe beef sliders: couldn't taste the quality, came out medium rare Korean tacos: neat concept, spicy and good Chicken arepas: spicy and very good, but the portions were literally bite-sized for each of us fourBeef Wellington: had high expectations and was very disappointed. Ordered medium rare as recommended, came out medium well and tough Social mac and cheese: slightly spicy, good but not special Oreo cake pops: slightly better than StarbucksOverall, there was so much promise, as another friend (not one in this party) was so impressed and said we can now boast of having been here.  Even though the concept was sexy, both in terms of the setup and the food, the actual experience was disappointing for us. In summary, this place is for you if you:-don't mind waiting with a reservation -like the idea of eating in a dance club-don't mind shouting across the table to talk to your friends-enjoy mostly average food in small portions I guess I am too old to be hip and would prefer a more traditional fine dining experience.",1,0,1,Thomas L.,"Victorville, CA",13,103,133

After we were seated at a bit over 9PM, we ordered the beef Wellington, ceviche, potato fries, pasta and branzino. Overall the food is good but I am unsure if it tasted good because it was really good or it was because we were extremely hungry.

It was either her first day or she just couldn't be bothered to do her job properly. Her attitude was more suited to a Chilli's than fine dining. She couldn't seem to get our cocktail orders correct, then when we ordered our wine for dinner, she said, ""I guess it's good for the price."" (With an eye roll) Ouch. Lets get to the food : the $50 skirt steak, no. It was a good cut of beef but the flavor was destroyed by over use of butter, cream and BBQ sauce.

I liked the fish tacos better then my friend 's chicken taquitos. For the main course we both had the chicken waffles which was really good. The chicken wasn't too greasy/fried and was really juicy and the combination of the blue corn waffle really made it. The dish had a little spice which I liked. Definitely never had a spin on chicken and waffles like this. And that is what you expect at a tapas place like this, small plates with a spin on the conventional.

The one star was for the food which was yum, but  took some time to come out. We had a prefixed 10 course meal. The service was tremendously atrocious. It was very disappointing to experience since we have heard so much about this place and all the yelp reviews we have read. The biggest upset was when the check came and they handed the check to the Bachelorette!!! WTF! When looking at the check, they charged extra for champagne that was not ordered. Because it was a bachelorette party, it almost seemed like they probably thought we would not notice. Upon speaking with the manager, she was not at all helpful and was not understanding with no customer service. Of course, not wanting to ruin the Bachelorette's night, we end up paying and move on. We thought this would be an experience for the Bachelorette dining at a well known restaurant. We also thought that when we have a large group eating with a special occasion being celebrated, we would've been taken care of considering the amount of money and gratuities we were paying for.

Ambiance, food, drinks and service all get 5 stars, but knocking off one because every time I have gone the check-in process is a zoo. The entrance is always packed, and each time I'm told it will be a wait of about 30 minutes past my reservation time and that I should go upstairs and have a drink at the bar. But is always a treat to come here. This past time my best friend and boyfriend were in town from Boston and we wanted to show them a solid NYC night out.  We had some great cocktails, my favorite being the Notorious FIG with bourbon, fig, pear- cinnamon syrup and fresh lemon. We were 4 people, and we were more than full with 7 plates + dessert. The waitress recommended 8-12 for a group of our size, but being veterans we knew that was a bit much.The standout was the potato & goat cheese pierogis - they were to die for! And I don't even really love goat cheese! The French onion soup dumplings are what they are known for, and they were superb.Another interesting standout was the Korean tacos - so good!! We also had the smoked tomato pizzeria (great), meatballs (good) and the taqutos (nothing special).

My friend ordered the Mac & Cheese and I ordered French onion soup dumplings. We also ordered 2 Vietnamese coffee at the same time. For the slow time in the restaurant, we waited quite for a long time.For the food, I would give five stars. I tasted my friend's mac & cheese and it was one of the best I have ever had. The crunchy texture on the top goes well with the creamy mac & cheese in the middle. It was rich and smooth. My French onion soup dumplings took longer time to be served, but they were fantastic. Soft onion soup texture was covered in crispy dumplings with cheese on the top.For the service, I would give one star. The drinks that we ordered did not come out for a long time and when we asked about the status, it turned out the server forgot to get them ready. He came back with only one drink when we clearly specified that we ordered two. He probably suffers from short term memory loss. He went back to the bar one more time to bring another one. It was not even busy in the restaurant. He also constantly talked to one particular customer at the corner. It looked like they knew each other or he felt the need to pay special attention to that customer, while the service at my table was suffering.

Great flavors.Lobster rolls (5/5): keep in mind that these are 1 per order.

Pieces of strawberry at the bottom could be stuck in the straw, which was kind of annoyingOthers:-French Onion Soup Dumplings (3/5): while these are supposed to be the signature dish here, I didn't find them particularly amazing.

For example, we ordered the bucatini, and received 3 plates of pasta. We did not need 3 plates of pasta and actually ended up taking most of it home, so it was discouraging.

Here's what we had:+ French onion soup dumplings (duh)+ Cobb salad bites+ Crispy fish tacos + House cut fries+ Baby back ribs with mango slaw+ Wild mushroom ravioli + DoughnutsThe dumplings are a must. Cobb bites were good but not too exciting. Tacos were excellent but left me wanting - super small bites. The fries were great, the texture was tougher than usual which I know isn't a great way to explain it, but it was like they were fried more - anyway, it worked. Ribs and ravioli were amazing and the doughnuts were out of this world. Edit 5/2017:As amazing as my first time. Had a boss tweed gimlet and strawberry fields for my cocktails (both amazing), and shared the beef Wellington, French onion soup dumplings and potato and goat cheese pierogies. That beef was pure perfection, and of course you've got to get the dumplings. The pierogies were awesome, too.

When we asked what was going on, a waiter did not apologize, but gave a poor excuse for what the hold up was. We had about 3 different waiters and waitresses through out our meal and not once, did someone come to check on us or asked if we needed anything else. Every time we wanted to order other plate or drink, we had to find and physically ""tap"" on someone is get their attention.

The day of the reservation at around 3pm I found out one of my friends that was coming for dinner was going to be running late, since I knew this place was strict about only seating full parties I called them to let them know and see if it was alright. The lady on the phone was incredibly nice and said it will be absolutely no problem. I show up with 5 people at 845pm and they will not seat us. Shocking. The hostess said no one should have told me that over the phone and that she can't do anything for us. After this happen, I've now quickly noticed that there are numerous parties angrily awaiting their tables and continue to ask the hostess how much longer it will be. There are no tables available for anyone waiting. This was a bad sign and I should have left then. After 10-15 minutes, my final member of the party arrives and we approach the hostess stand to seat us. She said our table is not ready and does not know when it will be done. We proceed to wait another 30 minutes for our table and the hostess has not sat one party in the 45 minutes I had been standing there. I asked her a couple times for an update and she RUDELY kept saying ""Sorry, I have no idea."" How are you a hostess and a restaurant with numerous reservations and have no idea how to seat them? Finally, my hungry friends decide to ditch the place. I walk up the hostess stand for the last time asking what the wait time was looking at, and to get the same answer. I respond with that we will be going to dinner somewhere else, and to cancel my reservation. She looked at me like I was crazy, and said ""Are you sure you want to do that?"" It felt like she was threatening me that for some crazy reason I didn't want to wait over an hour for a reservation I made.

1.0,5/14/2017,"Have you ever had just a couple tiny bites and then gotten a 400$ bill? That's kinda what eating at the Stanton social is like. If you are hungry and don't feel like spending hundreds, avoid this place. When you order eggs Benedict for $22, you don't expect to get literally two bites of egg. When you order chicken and waffles for $24, you don't expect to get 4 bites of chicken with a tiny dry waffle piece underneath. Overall very deceptive with the portions and prices. I came with a group of 8. We basically had appetizers for 400 dollars. Everyone left hungry. Worst of all, the first server had a serious attitude problem. He immediately was very short tempered, condescending and rude when we asked one question about one of the menu items. We had to go speak to the manager to get a different waitress. The second server we got was perfectly nice, but I don't want to have to complain just to get a server with common decency and manners. The ambiance is very nice- dark and chic. So if you're looking for an upscale meal and don't mind dropping some serious dough, you could consider coming here. The food was tasty, but nothing out of this world.

I expected a little snotty behavior, this being a high end place, but it was not the case. The meals came fairly quick and the drinks were average.Menu (0.5): The menu was good. But as expansive as other tapas places and definitely not risky. It's a safe bet you'll know most things on here. I would put it as your normal restaurant-esque dishes but miniature as opposed to it being new creations. With that being said, the food is good. Great execution, lack of imagination.Pricing (0.5): High end usually means, high prices and... this is certainly the case here. Your dishes will range well over $15 each and the drinks (cocktails) range about the same. You would think the dishes would be a lot more creative for the price tag. Sadly not.Presentation/Atmosphere (1 star): It's a beautiful restaurant. The layout is modern and trendy with a high ceiling open space interior. There is a small, few tables, second floor but it's not as pretty as the main floor. The bar is small and wine selection is small and limited which isn't a dealer breaker but severely needs an upgrade. The ambiance creates a proper high end feel and staff's attire also resonants that message. Taste (1 star): Superb, albeit, no creativity. The plating is great and the overall clean and svelte approach helps to enjoy the simple dishes. Bill: $120 (20% gratuity - on my own discretion) on two individuals during dinner. About 4-5 plates and two drinks.Enjoy!",0,0,0,Rey S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,30,71
5.0,5/12/2017,"The Stanton Social has such an amazing feel to it. From the atmosphere to the service and of course the food, everything was very nice. I came her for an anniversary dinner and we made a 7pm reservation and were seated right away. We sat upstairs and the ambiance is very pleasant, I especially loved the stairs which is also a wine rack. We came here primarily because we wanted tapas and to try different dishes and people RAVED about the french onion soup dumplings. Food: We got Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos (3 tacos), French Onion Soup Dumplings (6 dumplings), Hand Pulled Chicken Arepas (3 arepas) and the Chicken N' Waffles (4 pieces). The server recommended that we get 4-6 dishes for two people. All four dishes were amazing and slightly different. The French Onion Soup Dumplings definitely lived up to the hype and I could definitely have an order to myself. The chicken arepas had to be my second favorite as they had so much flavor in such a tiny bite. The Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos had to be my next favorite, they were very good and the tuna tasted so fresh and flavorful. Lastly, the Chicken N' Waffles, although they are last on my list, this hardly means anything. The only criticism I would have is that there could've been more sauce. Overall I though the food was extremely delicious and tasty. The food is a little pricey and the servings are a bit uneven (there were 3 arepas and 3 tacos) which made it difficult which to split up between 2 people. Service: The waiter was very friendly and helpful. We asked for his suggestions and he had no issue telling us his opinions. The food did take quite a bit to come out but because it was so fresh and tasty, it didn't even matter. All the staff was friendly as well. Overall, I loved this restaurant. Is it a place I would come to all the time? definitely not mainly because with 2 people it is so easy to rack up a $100+ bill including drinks. But for special occasions or a treat here and there, it is perfect!",0,1,0,Daniella F.,"New York, NY",210,37,11
2.0,5/12/2017,"My rating is based on the service experience not so much the fool. I had been once before and really enjoyed it but this past Wednesday 5/10 our experience was pretty bad. Overall the food was good, we ate well, and had a good bottle of wine. The bill would have been $200 before tip. At the end of our meal one of our plates had a bug on it, we were eating up in the lounge and I alerted the bar tenders who quickly cleaned off the living bug at this time I told them to make sure to let our server know what had happened. Our server was Michelle who later on appeared to a be a manager. The bar tender came to our table and offered us dessert or some Rose, we declined because we were a little grossed out by the bug. The bartender then returned with our check which had 0 discount on it. I brought this to the bartenders attention to which he said,""I offered you a dessert or wine"" so I asked for him to speak to his manager. He came back with a 10% discount approved by Michelle. I still did not think this was satisfactory (the bartender did apologize) and I asked to speak with Michelle. She did not apologize for what happened and ultimately offered us 40% off, again I wasn't overly satisfied by this but I was annoyed that we had to discuss this at least 3 times. I also had a Blackboard Eats coupon so ultimately the bill was discounted to about $85 w/o tip. I was incredibly disappointed that at the very least they didn't just offer to comp the food and I would have been happy to pay for the wine, but I'm also aware that most restaurants would comp the whole meal for something like this considering at the time I was calm and didn't make any kind of a scene.

5.0,5/7/2017,"One of my favorite places in Manhattan. The scene is electric, the food is extremely innovative/delicious and you never know who you'll be sitting beside. There are a lot of must-try's at this restaurant. The potato & goat cheese pierogies and french onion soup dumplings surely lead the way. Additionally, the kobe beef burger sliders, wild mushroom ravioli, and hard shell tofu tacos are amazing. Be sure to try to the cocktails as well - plenty of great options. Keep in mind that even with reservations (which are hard to come by themselves), you'll likely have to wait once you arrive. Thankfully, there is bar upstairs that you can grab a drink at (and even eat) while you wait.

2.0,4/24/2017,"Food: 3/5Ambiance: 4.5/5Service: 1/5Value: 3/5Note: I really downgraded my rating for this place because of the poor service. Came here for a birthday brunch with a group of 10. I picked this place bc it was one of the few that actually allowed group reservations without a prix fixe, which was much appreciated!! The restaurant is dimly lit and has a super fun going-out-y vibe even for brunch, and it reminded me like a toned down version of Beauty & Essex for those of you familiar with that. Overall the food was decent, but the portions were definitely small.. we had the Mac and cheese, huevos rancheros, fish tacos, fries, Oreo pancakes, cinnamon sticks, french onion soup dumplings, fries, and a few other things. Oreo pancakes and fish tacos were the highlights; everything else was good but nothing special. I was just incredibly disappointed by the service... our waitress was incredibly haughty and un-friendly, and when two dishes came out that we definitely did not order, she just seemed really disgruntled and angry with us when it was obviously not our fault the kitchen sent out wrong dishes. Also, we had some gluten-free members of the party who ordered specific dishes which NEVER CAME OUT! When we pointed this out to our waitress, she wasn't accommodating at all, didn't offer to send out the dish, and seemed to blame us. Also, brunch cocktails were $15, which was just so overpriced. Some of us wanted to do the bottomless 1.5 hours for $25 but that's only allowed if the whole table participates :( our drinks also came out SUPER slowly. I understand that a big party is tough to serve, but I was just really disappointed in the attitude along with the poor service.",0,1,0,Lillian Z.,"New York, NY",814,173,56

I was excited to taste the lobster roll, curious about the chicken and waffles and my friend wanted potato latkes, bacon and croque monsieur satays. Food was good but not wowing as anticipated.

This is the main reason I'd want to come back here!- Drinks: The drinks were good here, I mostly had the Moscow Mule (~$16) which was delicious and my friends had other mixed drinks that they said were good as well. - Atmosphere: The bar/ lounge area was much smaller than I expected, and with the table section blocked off for a party the place was tiny! Still had a nice laid back vibe to it where you can still have conversations with friends and the music isn't too overbearing or loud. Overall, had a fun time and glad that this was our first stop.

Being that my husband and I have a pretty hectic life with our jobs and 2 children, we were ready to take advantage of the night... The décor was nice. On the trendy side which I liked. The waitress was nice. Nothing out this world. Food took a while to come out. We ordered multiple tapas. My husband loved the short ribs, however I order the chicken and waffles dish. I guess I was expecting a crispy peace of chicken on nice fluffy waffle. Not exactly what I got... I got some grilled chicken on pieces of waffles. I guess it was healthier but not what I anticipated... lol Whatever... It was my husband's birthday so I didn't want to be b@#$... Lol At the end of dinner our waitress brought out a complimentary cupcake but I guess I was expecting a little more fuss. Many like everyone coming together singing happy birthday or something. She literally just placed the cup cake and walked away... Soooo it was still early and we were looking forward to dancing the night away.

3.0,3/26/2017,"Well... I guess we'll do the pros first:* The food is tasty * Unlimited drinks come out rather quickly * The decor is pretty The end. Now for the juicy stuff (aka the cons): * The prices. What the f**k! Every single thing on the menu is overpriced. Cocktails average to about $15 each so obviously paying $25 for the unlimited feature makes more sense. The food ranged between about $14-$25ish for literally the smallest portions. Understandably, seafood is pricier than anything else, but the Lobster Benedict came with two little things of eggs for $22. The chicken taquitos were a few dollars less but came with like 4 bite size pieces... I'm still so confused by their pricing system. * The drinks. The bottomless drinks option for 1.5 hours was cute but the drinks themselves weren't that great. You're given a limited selection of drinks and like 75% of them were sh*t. The ""bittersweet"" mimosa was pretty much just bitter and we had to chug it just to get rid of it. The Bloody Mary was just awful; we had to send it back. The Bellini was decent (but I feel like anything would've tasted good after that damn Bloody Mary). The coffee cocktail was probably the best one and I really liked that they put actual coffee in it. * The service was neither here nor there. The hostess and our waitress were friendly for the most part. However going around our party of eight, she took everyone's order except for mine and was ready to start collecting the menus... so there's that. I was worried that it would've been a struggle to flag her down to refill our drinks before our 1.5 hours were up, but she was pretty good about it. The food took quite a while but taking into consideration how busy it was and how pretty our plates were, I wasn't mad about it. So I guess this is more of a 3.5 star review.

1.0,3/26/2017,"I haven't written a Yelp review in quite some time, but the subpar service, mediocre food, cramped seating area, and outrageous prices I experienced at the Stanton Social this afternoon prompted me to do so. Our server was unattentive - my friend had to flag her down every time he wanted a refill of his Bloody Mary (which wasn't very good, by the way) as part of the bottomless drink option he spent $25 on. She also charged him for each Bloody Mary individually at the end of the meal, and we had to wait 10 minutes for her to correct the bill at the end after we pointed it out, as she claimed she ""didn't hear him ask for it."" This was very well likely, as the decibel level in the restaurant was practically deafening for brunch, and the dimmed lighting and crowded floor didn't make the ambiance any better. Here's the setup: booths on both sides of a narrow room, with giant tables seating 5-10 people in the center of the room. This means that there were about two inches from the back of my chair and the booth behind me. Not ideal.Besides the uncomfortable arrangement and lack of lighting in the restaurant, the food was mediocre at best, and the dishes were extremely expensive. I understand that the Stanton Social is a tapas restaurant, but it is absolutely outrageous to charge $14 for an eggs Benedict that contains two soggy pieces of bread the size of a half-dollar and two tiny poached eggs on top, along with miniature rounds of Canadian bacon - seriously, it looked like dollhouse-sized food meant for Barbie and Ken. I can get a normal sized eggs Benedict at other nice brunch places in the city for $14. More importantly, my friend said the eggs Benedict was the worst she's ever had. (Also of note: they were unwilling to make ANY substitutions for Canadian bacon for my vegetarian friend.)The huevos rancheros were served in soft tacos and tasted fine, but I could've made them easily myself, and worst of all, there were only four tiny tacos in the $15 dish. Furthermore, all five people in my party ordered separate dishes, and it was crystal-clear to the waitress that we were ordering dishes separately and not to share, but three separate orders of huevos rancheros came out on two plates, with six tacos each skewered together. This means that the three of us who ordered the dish were forced to unassemble both dishes and create a third plate. This was annoying, especially since the tacos were served with sauce that was doled out in drizzle form right on the plate. The best part of brunch? The waitress did let three of my friends split the bill on their credit cards. Maybe she recognized that the outrageous bill would have been far too much for one of us to front by ourselves.

4.0,3/15/2017,"The Stanton Social is definitely a place to dine if you feeling bougie. The atmosphere makes you feel fancayyy and luxurious, but the food can be a miss at times. Came here with my parents and we ordered a few dishes ranging from their most popular options, to some items we thought sounded 'exciting' and 'new': The Charred Octopus Salad, Thai Style Salmon Ceviche, Rhode Island Lobster Roll, Charred Kobe Beef Burger, 'Beef and Broccoli,' and the much-raved French Onion Soup Dumplings. While this may sound like an insane amount of food, each dish is fairly small since they're tapas and meant to be shared. All the dishes were well executed, however, majority didn't have me raving. The Thai Style Salmon Ceviche was really unique with the slight sweetness from the coconut milk, and refreshing kick from the lemongrass. I'd recommend this dish if you're looking for something different than your typical spicy-salmon-on-top-of-fried-rice-balls option. The stand out were the French Onion Soup Dumplings. These babies are no hype--literally an explosion of comforting soup encased around a thin wrapper, served with a charred crouton on the toothpick and smothered in glorious melted cheese. Truly heaven. But the most memorable of all the dishes was the dessert. Specifically the Warm Doughnuts. These aren't just your run-of-the-mill Dunkin Donuts. They're perfectly fried and crispy on the outside, but incredibly fluffy on the inside. And I kid you not when I say you can eat like 5 of these and not feel weighed down--the lightest of all doughnuts I've ever eaten. They come served with 3 dipping sauces: caramel, chocolate, and berry. Divine. Would I come here again just for the doughnuts? You bet. So I'll be back, not just to satisfy my sweet tooth but to also try their several other tapas options.

So the restaurant was pretty empty, which worked out for us because we received undivided attention from the servers. We ended up ordering a couple of things to share - the taquitos and the social mac & cheese. Both were equally scrumptious. We also opted for the cocktails open bar and drank to our heart's content. I stuck to ordering the peach bellini & stanton sunrise and drank enough to give myself a sweet buzz.

And the pastrami reuben quesadillas were fantastic! The restaurant gets packed, so make sure you make a reservation. The reservations weren't too difficult to get either. ...especially after deciding to go back for late night snacks at 11pm.

The deal did not mention a time limit and simply said you were guaranteed five drinks with no caveats. Not to mention at this point we hadn't received the dessert we ordered as part of the deal.

I really enjoyed the fact that each dish came out one at a time.  That way your able to pace yourself and really enjoy the flavors of each dish.

So I'm sitting at the table and we've just ordered, when all of a sudden, I feel something crawling on my arm. As I look down, there is a huge COCKROACH  that has made its way up and is now sitting on my chest. Now I've seen cockroaches before, but this one didn't compare and was at least the size of my palm. I start freaking out (as one would if there's a cockroach on them) and finally it jumps off of me and starts running around the floor. Everyone within the vicinity is freaking out and it takes the wait staff a good 10 minutes to handle the situation as the cockroach is running about. Finally, a manager comes over and says that they have a ""water bug"" problem (ahahah yeah okay... that definitely wasn't a water bug....) and he offers to move us to the ""VIP"" section and comp our dinner. I mean, great, a free dinner, but that sure does not make up for the TRAUMA I endured as there was literally the biggest cockroach probably in existence (excuse the hyperbole) literally poached on top of my chest. Definitely won't come back until the health department does a little check up on this place. Cockroaches are one thing, but when one is SITTING ON YOUR CHEST, that's another story.

2.0,2/19/2017,"My friends and I came to Stanton Social for a birthday brunch and we were extremely disappointed in the service and overall experience. Service started off good at the hostess stand but then went down hill. We did the bottomless brunch for an hour and a half and the time it took to get each set of drinks was incredibly long. We started ordering rounds of drinks half way into drinks because we knew it would be at least 20 minutes before they actually came. The food was fine, but not as great as expected for the price. Also note, it is encouraged to do family style instead of people ordering their own entree. Portions for the dishes varied - some  were a good size for sharing and some were not at all. I also asked for a birthday cake shot that everyone posts and they did not have these for brunch - so I asked for a different kind of shot and the bartender didn't know how to make it so then they gave my friend a shot of champagne and charged us $17 for that.

I had the chicken (over cooked), the octopus salad (not much octopus) and the salmon, which was uninspiring. I was similarly uninspired to drink any more than two cocktails, so for that at least I am thankful. The staff seemed to be going through the motions; the interior is getting a bit shabby.

I go talk to the hosts as  I have invited my 4 guest to dine there, and explain nicely that our waitress seems to need a little help and could he please have her bring a bottle of champagne to our table  to celebrate one of my guest's recent promotions.  Next I thing I know she shows up at the table and says in front of my guest - ""So someone wanted to order Champagne""- i'm then thinking are you kidding me, go back to working at Buffalo Wild Wings !!! I quietly pull her aside and explain which was received with a blank stare.

Half the orders we good the other half were horrible.  Deducting 1 point for the loud music.  If the waiter cant hear the customers orders then you need to turn the music down.  Deducting another point because this place looks clean in the dark but is DIRTY.  I made the mistake of putting my hand down on the seat and could feel the crumbs that were left on it.  And there was a lot of it.Would not come back here.",1,0,0,Mike E.,"Edison, NJ",0,19,4

4.0,2/4/2017,"I was mentally writing my 1-star review while waiting for our table, as I'd made a reservation for my birthday dinner but had to wait an hour. Upon checking in five minutes early, the hostess informed us that they were running 15 minutes late and they would text me when our table was ready - we went upstairs to the bar to wait. 45 minutes later, no text, and came downstairs to investigate - pretty sure the hostess simply forgot but she didn't even apologize. Instead she said that they were getting our table ready (at this point it was 9:30 PM on a Monday, and tables were emptying anyway). I was FUMING and hungry. They must've noticed because two dishes came on the house, which was a nice gesture. The first dish was unremarkable, but the second was a crispy shell fish taco-type dish that had some delicious raw fish. My partner and I ordered the restaurant week menu, plus the french onion soup dumplings, and all combined it was a TON of food. We left perfectly satisfied, somewhat forgetting the beginning of our evening, as a result of our great waitress, good seats (we got to sit in a circular booth for just the two of us), and decent food. Not a huge fan of the french onion soup dumplings or ravioli, but my partner seemed to enjoy his food. I loved the Oreo cake pops and the birthday cupcake though!

4.0,1/31/2017,"Just be forewarned that even if you make a reservation, you will wait. I should've seen this earlier through the reviews. I was pretty hangry, but putting aside my bitterness this place has delicious food. So I'll give it the rating it deserves. So two must do's: 1) Make a reservation, and 2) Make the reservation for a time thirty minutes before you actually want to eat. Then grab a drink upstairs at the bar and chill in the dim and loud ambiance.Atmosphere: Restaurant Week, Winter 2017. My birthday always falls during these weeks so I use it as an excuse to treat myself to a nice but still relatively affordable meal. Made reservations for a Monday night at 7:30. Get there on time, am told they're backed up and it'll be 15 minutes. Go upstairs to hang out in the bar, come back down 15 minutes later. Still waiting...and waiting. I made an agreement with my boyfriend that if they don't seat us within 45 minutes of our scheduled reservation, we're dipping and indulging in pancakes at Clinton Street. 43 minutes later...we have our booth. You almost lost us, Stanton Social (Clinton street, I'm coming back for you soon). The place is dim, packed, loud and tiny. But the lighting and the decor is awesome. Food: Here's where this place makes up for my hangriness. It's all tapas style sharing. Our restaurant week choices were as follows: Potato and goat cheese pierogis: probably my favorite food out of all the ones I ate that night. The goat cheese was light and creamy, the creme sauce was an added delight, and the damn caramelized onions provided a sweet overlay on top of the pierogis. Just really, freaking, delicious. Fish tacos: three mini hard shell tacos, filled to the brim with fish and other fixings. Had a delightful citrusy and mango-ish kick to it. Chicken and waffles: That balsamic spiked maple syrup though ugh, it needed to be drizzled all over that is. I also wish the chicken could be a little crispier and fried, but the waffles were yummy and soft in the inside and crisp on the outside.Torchio Bolognese: pasta is pretty dense and heavy. If you like lamb, you'll love this. A little too lamby for my taste though. But that ricotta salata and mint was a delicious touch to the dish.Warm doughnuts: the donuts are standard and fluffy/warm sugar doughnuts. What makes up for it are the three sauces that complement the dish: chocolate, caramel, raspberry. The raspberry by far was my favorite, as it was rich in flavor and tart. The chocolate was really dense and strong in cocoa and the caramel was standard but albeit delicious. Guinness toffee cake: my word, I had a moment the first time i bit into this. The cake in itself is so moist, has a crunch around the edges, and was perfectly complemented by the cold ice cream. Bits of toffee explode your taste buds and the Guinness sauce on the side is addicting. It was so good I didn't even realize I spilled some on my shirt. I'm an embarrassment. They also gave us complimentary falafel crostinis which were tiny and tasted like fresh hummus on a cracker. And they also gave us a decently sized portion of salmon ceviche (on four Asian noodle soup spoons). The salmon ceviche was filled with fresh salmon and a lot of ginger. It was dope. Payed about 54 per person in total. A decent price for the amount of yummy and creative food provided. Restaurant week gives me life! In any other event I think each dish ranges from $17-30 so we def saved some cashé.Service: despite the long wait, the service is friendly, quick, and accommodating.

Pretty much everything on the menu sounded fantastic. Some of the items we got truly were outstanding. The French onion soup dumplings and the perogies were out of this world. The service was odd. The actual server seemed only semi-present. His communication skills were poor, he couldn't care less about giving suggestions, had limited knowledge about the wine menu, and tried pouring beer into my friend's water glass twice. The guys bringing the food out and clearing the tables seemed better-equipped to be waiters. The beer menu was awful. Barely better than what you'd find at a baseball game with nothing on tap. My biggest issue by far with this place was the price relative to the serving size. They have this little speech about plates being ""meant for sharing"". Ok fine, I can share as much as the next guy, BUT please give us enough to share. Thanks for adding the third normal sized meatball to our two meatballs for $8 extra. That's right, $24 for 3 small mediocre meatballs. The ""sliders"" is ONE slider for $9 and is TINY. Seriously?  We could have eaten three orders of the dumplings.

1.0,12/26/2016,"It's been awhile since I've been so utterly aghast and disappointed in a dining experience. I've had Stanton Social bookmarked for a couple of years, and I was thrilled that I was finally going to get to experience it with friends. Unfortunately, nearly $200 later, we all left there unimpressed and hungry. First of all, the restaurant itself is beautiful. It's dark and chic, and has the perfect playful ambiance for an evening out. It has three levels to the space, with a 2nd bar on the 3rd level. Stunning layout.When we first arrived I had to use the restroom, so I began to approach an employee. Seemingly knowing what I was going to ask him, he pointed upwards as if to signify that the restroom was upstairs on one of the other levels. So, I made my way upstairs and still could not locate the restroom on my own. I then approached one of the employees near the upper bar area and asked for assistance in finding the restroom. Without saying a word, he pointed towards a corner of the room. I guess Stanton Social employees are too good to be bothered with basic customer service interactions.To start, we ordered the following:Hand Pulled Chicken Arepas ($15) - These were tasty, but the portion size was outrageously unacceptable! The total circumference of each ""arepa"" was less than the size of a half dollar piece. Moreover, these were NOT traditional arepas; rather, they were more like a deconstructed version. Basically, each one of these cylindrical bites cost $5. Pastrami Reuben Quesadilla ($16) - Again, these had great flavor, but the portion was shameful. French Onion Soup Dumplings ($17) - These were very good. Served piping hot, as soon as you bite into them you get an explosion of French onion soup in your mouth. Albeit very tasty, they are still woefully overpriced.Our friends ordered the Veggie Burger which had to be sent back because the flavor was offensive to everyone at the table. They also ordered the Lobster Roll and Goat Cheese Pierogies ($14). Again, portions were small.I realize Stanton Social is tapas style, but when your table orders 6-7 plates, drops $200, and everyone leaves starving something is dreadfully wrong.",8,4,4,Gary R.,"San Diego, CA",826,721,1896

2.0,12/8/2016,"The Wait: We were a small group of 4 with a reservation for 8:45 pm. We were there by 8:40 pm. Stanton Social (SS) informed us that they were running a few minutes late and suggested we go upstairs and get a drink. Sure! No problem. We went upstairs, ordered some cocktails and waited at the bar. No news from the folks downstairs. We went downstairs at 9:15 and asked about the table. SS told us that the table assigned to us just paid their bill, so it will be a couple of minutes for the table to clear. No problem. We wait downstairs this time, standing at the entrance area. We see other folks being seated, we ask again about our table. Oh! Our table just ordered dessert, so another 15-20 mins. Wait... what? At this point, we get a little upset and tell them we've been waiting for an hour for our table. 3 minutes later, we are magically given a table.The moral of the story is that we shouldn't have been polite. The Dinner Wait: Our waiter introduces us to the tapas concept and recommends 8-10 dishes for the 4 of us. We were starving by then, so picked out 7 things from the menu immediately and were ready to order. The waiter asks us to hold on and disappears. 10 minutes later, she comes back for our order. This became a theme for the rest of the evening. Everything involves a wait and every plate has tiny portions. The first plate arrived about half an hour later. We were ravenous and devoured the tiny tacos in two seconds. Then we have another 10-15 minutes wait. The next plate arrived and we devoured it in two seconds and so on. The Food: The food itself was average. The only spectacular thing on the menu was the hard shell vegan tacos. Everything else was underwhelming. 1. Hard shell vegan Tacos: Really fantastic and the only worthwhile dish we had all evening. It was a burst of flavor and texture. Sadly, only 3 in a plate, so one person didn't get to try it. 2. Vegan Sliders:  Each plate comes with one tiny slider - so we ordered a couple. These were inedible - my cousin actually spat it out because it had raw tamarind in it. She started coughing because it was incredibly dry. 3. Pierogies: Average. Tiny. 4. Wild mushroom & goat cheese ravioli: Again, 3 on the plate, so one person couldn't eat it. This was decent. Had some flavor but was a bit too chewy for my taste. 4. Roasted tomato pizette: This was the only decent sized dish, was not bad. The crust tasted a bit burnt but on the whole edible. 5. Shrimp lolipops with popcorn: The shrimp was a tad cold but not bad. The popcorn was literally just some popcorn in the glass with some cayenne pepper on it. Not even salt. I don't remember the other dishes we had. Overall, we're not likely to return. The ambiance is upscale and the service is not bad.  My advice is to eat something substantial elsewhere prior to going or plan to eat something substantial elsewhere after the dinner.

We came here last night with a group of 15 people and we were squeezed in a small table in the corner of the restaurant. Despite making reservations weeks in advanced and having a prefixed menu, it took us an hour to actually get our first dish. The dishes came out in 30-40 minute intervals which there was absolutely no reason for considering everyone had one bite sized portion that was finished within seconds.. You can imagine most of our night was sitting around waiting for food. Have friendly conversation? Forget about it! The music choice was good and just the right volume-- if we were at a club event-- not for a pleasant dinner. At one point, you just get tired of screaming over the table to speak to each other. We had to constantly tag our waitress down for drinks the entire night since food was no where to be found. The steak finnalllly decided to arrive about 2 hours later. I was taken back by the mouthful of salt I got with my piece of semi-cold steak (which I guess makes up for the lack of salt on the rims of my margaritas).What we had originally planned to be a 2 hour dinner, turned out to be 3 hours. Most of us couldn't wait that long and had to leave to go home without finishing our entire menu.

Service was fine, nothing to complain about, nor write home about. My girlfriend and I shared the following dishes:- ""Corn Dog"" Crab Cakes - Was so excited by this concept, expected a very crispy crab cake. What we received was a mushy crab cake on a stick that was almost completely devoid of any flavor.- French Onion Soup Dumplings - This was by far the best dish we tried. It was incredibly flavorful, but bordered on being too pungent. All things considered, it was a good-not-great, creative dish.- Chicken & Waffles - I don't even know why I ordered this considering I'm usually underwhelmed by chicken & waffles. These were arguably the worst I've encountered after trying probably 8-10 different varieties in restaurants ranging from soul-food spots in Harlem, to very upscale eateries. The waffles were plain mushy, not really sweet or savory and the chicken was grilled instead of fried, like I was hoping for and expected. - Baby Back Ribs - I have never once in my life sent back a dish to the kitchen. Not once in hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands of restaurants. This changed at The Stanton Social. These were simply inedible. I sat there and thought to myself ""how can somebody try this dish and decide it was a good idea to put on the menu?"" It's a shame because the ribs themselves looked beautiful, incredibly meaty and falling off the bone.- Ice Cream Sundae - How do you screw up an ice cream sundae?

2.0,10/31/2016,The food was OK at best.  It was so overpriced I could not believe it.  I don't mind paying for good food as long as it is good.  There were 7 of us the bill came to over $300 and we all left hungry and unsatisfied.    It was so overcrowded that people were bumping into each other all night.  We had to keep moving our seats ( we were forces to squish ourselves up against the table) so people can get buy.  Maybe round tables in the middle of the restaurant are not a good idea.

4.0,10/30/2016,"This is a very good option for bunch on the lower east side. It was easy to get a reservation for 12:30 on a Saturday as late as 11pm the night before. One of the aspects of Stanton Social that makes it unique is its tapas-like approach to brunch.We shared four dishes - the cinnamon roll sticks, the caramelized banana pancakes, the french onion soup dumplings, and the smoked tomato pizzetta.The only one of these dishes that wasn't excellent was the cinnamon roll sticks, and this mainly stemmed from the fact that we had different expectations as to what this dish would be. We thought they would have a consistency more similar to cinnamon rolls when in fact they are more flaky and crunchy. They weren't bad in their own right, just slightly disappointing.Otherwise, the food was very delicious. The French Onion Soup Dumplings in particular were amazing, and we devoured the pizzetta. The service was also quick and very friendly, and the ambiance was pleasant. They did have a slight problem with clean glasses for tap water, but they were very nice about it. We would definitely come back again, if only to try out some of the other small-plate options that they offer.

3.0,10/29/2016,"3.5 stars. Maybe my expectations were too high for Stanton Social. The number of reviews, the incessant hype, the seemingly creative menu...I thought we were in for a treat. As it turns out--and this is the moral of many, many stories--looking pretty on the outside is not enough. If execution falls flat, the buildup all seems pretty silly. All in all, Stanton Social is a fun venue with tons of energy with solid cocktails but overpriced, underwhelming food. Reminded me of Beauty & Essex (in vibe, presentation) but significantly inferior. Came here at 8:15pm on a Friday night. As expected, the place was loud and bustling. The decor here is gorgeous--glamorous and creative, beautiful lighting fixtures, sleek design overall. This is definitely a good spot (in theory) for a girl's night out or a big group dinner. Would definitely recommend making a reservation beforehand, especially if you're a large party. This place is busy 24/7.Stanton Social boasts a pretty intriguing cocktail menu--I actually found the drink execution to be much better, as a whole, than that of the food. To kick off the night, I opted for the Sage Advice (Botanist gin, mango, shredded sage, lemon), which I'd definitely recommend as a starter drink. Though it's listed under the ""Savory"" heading, it's actually quite sweet. Heavy on the mango, but I have zero issues with that. Huge mango fan and don't see it enough in mixed drinks. Be careful though--though you can't really taste the gin here, I assure you, it exists. My second drink won the night though (both in taste and in name)--the Notorious F.I.G. (Bulleit bourbon, fig, pear-cinnamon syrup, fresh lemon). Now here's something that's worth the hype. My bf typically doesn't like whiskey and even he agreed that this drink was a winner. Cobb Salad Bites: shaved brussels sprouts, bacon, blue cheese, quail egg, avocado (B+/A-)These were *almost* fantastic. Something was just a smidge off with the flavor and I still can't really place it. Still, these were fun, inventive and a great first dish of the night. The creamy avocado on the inside held all of the other goodness together and not surprisingly, paired wonderfully with the bacon. That combo isn't really a stretch, though (the ingredients of a Cobb Salad aren't exactly a secret). I'm not a huge blue cheese fan, so that might've been the issue for me. Overall, these were Willy Wonka-esque and definitely woke the palette up. Nori-Spiced Tuna Poke Wonton: cilantro, avocado, crushed wasabi peas (A-)One of our better dishes of the night, and very reminiscent of my meal and Beauty & Essex a number of months ago. Three wontons (WHY MUST THESE PLACES ALL SERVE THEIR APPS IN TRIOS?? The Cobb Salad Bites also came as a group of three.) topped with bountiful avocado (think your dish needs more but coming to a standstill on how to make it better? Put an avo on it!) and those yummy wasabi peas. The poke craze has made it to New York and we're all going crazy for it. You're dining as a duo, someone's gotta take the high road and concede the third wonton. French Onion Soup Dumplings: B-These are apparently the ""signature"" at Stanton Social. I've never been a fan of French onion soup, but our waiter raved and raved about these babies so we gave into the pressure. We needed one more dish. Unfortunately, these were collectively the least favorite dish of the night. It's entirely possible that this just isn't a food that I like. Simple as that. It's perturbing to me given my love for just about every food out there, but ya can't have it all, I guess. Just can't get behind these. Maryland Crab Cake Corndog: AWe seemed to be confronting a visual theme of general brown-ness across presentations. These were cute/creative/actually really tasty, but at this point we were tiring of breaded-this and battered-that. Just a small gripe. The flavors were fantastic, though. I will never tire of crab cakes/literally any dish featuring crab, and these didn't disappoint. Again, we were only served three! At least these are a bit easier to split (relatively). House-Brined ""Pastrami Reuben"" Quesadilla: swiss cheese, sauerkraut, mustard aioli (A-)Pastrami reubens carry a lot of nostalgia for me. Cold cuts with the Jewish fam every Sunday was a big tradition in my house growing up. Though I enjoyed the flavor profile of the dish (pretty hard not to if you like reubens), these felt a bit too dainty for me. Reubens are supposed to be falling apart at the seams with pastrami and these were a bit too weak for my taste. But when you're looking for this type of style (light, easily shareable), these are a great take on the reuben that don't require as much commitment as a Katz's sandwich does. Our total for the night was something like $140. Considering the quantity and the qualify of the food we received, that's simply too much. I get that a person comes here for the experience more than anything, but I was still disappointed. At least the service was great?",3,1,1,Molly T.,"New York, NY",887,464,1480

3.0,10/22/2016,"Three stars for the food, which was delicious through and through, and the service, which met our expectations. I'm hesitant to blame servers for bad experiences (unless the server is outright rude) because I worked in the industry and know that much of what happens in restaurants is beyond the servers' control.The menu explains that the dishes are designed ""for sharing among friends"" and ""are brought to the table steadily and continuously throughout the meal."" We ordered 4 dishes for 2 of us, but since my sister is a vegetarian we only picked one with meat. We got the meat dish and a small bruschetta plate first - both delicious, but my sister wasn't eating the meat dish, so she only had a piece or two of bruschetta while waiting for the rest of the food. An hour after we ordered we were still waiting on the rest of the food.  At first we were hesitant to ask about it because of the menu disclaimer, but at a certain point there was nothing ""steady"" or ""continuous"" about the meal. We finally asked the server about the other food, he apologized and told us it was coming. A few minutes later a different server brought us a complimentary plate of potato and goat cheese dumplings and apologized for the delay and thanked us for being so patient - but this was confusing because one of the two dishes we were waiting on was just a side of fries, which I can't imagine is a more complicated dish to make than dumplings. It was also frustrating because while the dumplings were tasty, we didn't order them, and had to resist eating them lest we fill up before the rest of our food came. The food finally came about 10 minutes later and was delicious, as all of the food had been, but we had to wrap it up because we were basically full from the dumplings, and also had planned to do things other than just eat brunch that day and it was getting late. Seems like they are having problems with management or kitchen organization, the table next to us was having a similar experience (and even tried to cancel the food they were waiting for because they were also full from the dumplings).

4.0,10/21/2016,"We loved our dinner at Stanton Social Club. Friends suggested that we make early dinner reservations because the restaurant gets loud, which we did. The restaurant serves family style small plates, which we loved.  We ordered their signature French Onion Soup Dumplings, Spicy Mac & Cheese, Chicken Taquitos and the Spiced Sesame Salmon.  The chicken taquitos were served first and were excellent. In fact, he wished we had ordered a second one.  Next, the mac & cheese arrived. It was baked in the oven with Panko bread crumbs, which added a nice crunch, but I was disappointed with how mild cayenne was. Heck - I put more cayenne in my scrambled eggs at home.  I asked the waiter for heat and he brought a dish of hot sauce which I added. The hot sauce definitely helped add heat to the mac & cheese.  The French Onion Soup Dumplings are an inventive small plate and they're covered in melted parmesan. However, I found the dumplings a little too sweet for my taste, as the melted parmesan didn't add enough salt to counter the sweet onion inside the dumplings. I added hot sauce to a dumpling, which helped, but was too strong for the dumpling. We both liked the spiced sesame salmon very much.We had a great waiter and enjoyed both the food and wine very much.

Courses I could have skipped were the egg ""taco"" things (basically hard-to-eat breakfast burritos) and the flatbread (fine, but nothing special). The food was pretty decent, but the service was SO slow and unexceptional. We were there for a full three hours. Now, I've had 2.5-3 hour meals before at some restaurants, but for some reason because of how small the portion sizes were at The Stanton Social, we finished our bites in about 10 seconds and then had a LOT of sitting around time waiting. Didn't really like the vibe for brunch. There was a DJ upstairs playing pretty loud music, which was kinda bizarre to have in the background while a table of girls sat and chatted. I DID like the whole ""social"" concept, though, in that I liked the tiny, shareable bites with ample drinks and kinda a communal-casual feel to the tables.

We skipped the cocktail menu, even though the drinks looked intriguing and creative.

2.0,9/9/2016,"Second time coming to this restaurant. The first time was for brunch and the food was amazing. Tonight I came for dinner and it was absolutely awful. First of all, everyone's dish came out and then unfortunately, they gave me the wrong order. I didn't mind at first, until it took 25 minutes for them to bring out the correct dish. The 9 other people at the table were polite and waited for my dish, while theirs got cold- very unpleasant start. The waiter was very rude and didn't even apologize for the mistake. The food finally came out and it was just awful. The tuna was mixed with a watermelon base and it just didn't not mix well with the sauce. I then ordered a cobb salad recommended by the manager. Again was not appetizing, but was hungry and couldn't wait any longer. And after all the shenanigans, the waiter left the tuna dish I returned on the bill!

2.0,9/4/2016,"I must say I was so completely disappointed with this restaurant. I heard and read so many rave reviews, that I was totally confused with how bad our food was. I really wanted this to be an amazing experience, but what we got instead was a mediocre yet really expensive dinner. We ordered the chicken taquitos (ok) the spicy salmon (ok-) the scallops (almost ok) and the green beans (not ok at all). The green beans were as dry as rhe Sahara Desert in summer, and were tasteless to boot. For dessert we ordered the strawberry short cake that was plain awful. I wish  I ordered the doughnuts that everyone is raving about, but we clearly made the wrong choice...a really sad choice. I hope for The Stanton Social that they just had an off day.

3.0,9/4/2016,"Hello All- So I came to The Staton Social with already confirmed reservations on what I assumed would be a busy Saturday night. Showed up 10 minutes before the start of my reservation and immediately checked in with the hostess, notifying her of my party's arrival. It seemed to be booming in the downstairs dining area so I would have been pleasantly surprised if our table was ready. Sadly, I was not pleasantly surprised, which was not a big deal (again we ensured we came early for this reason). The hosted notified us that the party currently dining in our assigned seating was on their dessert course therefore we would have a short wait. She stated she would send me a text message once our table was ready and directed us to the upstairs lounge area where we took our pre- dinner thirst. Upon arriving upstairs, the bartender (bearded gentleman) was extremely pleasant and accommodating. I was told the cocktail he made was flawless as well. Kudos to you sir! The cocktail waitresses seemed very attentive upstairs as well. After waiting 20 minutes beyond our confirmed reservation time, I chatted with the staff upstairs about possibly bringing our reservation upstairs but was informed that there was a private party scheduled. The DJ had just arrived and it's seemed like upstairs was going to be the place to be. Fortunately the same music is played in both areas. After waiting 30 minutes, I went back to the hostess to inquire as to our table. She then told me to hang tight because we were about to be seated. I wish she informed me of this via text message as promised but was relived nonetheless.As we walked to our table, there were groups of birthdays, celebrations and other beautiful people dining just because. I felt at home. Our waiter came to our table shortly after being seated and was great. Explained the menu very well and was very patience with my group. His name escapes me. To Share- -Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies- Great dish to share. Came with about 5 pierogie bites with a goat cheese spread. Very good share item.-French Onion Soup Dumplings- I wasn't overly impressed with this item. I know it is a favorite but seemed to be a bit salty. I tend to be particular with my salt/sugar intake so that my have attributed. =/-Chicken Arepa- Probably my favorite share item. Perfect size for each of us.-Quesadilla- Was okay. There was an obvious difference from normal quesadilla with its size but the flavor was also good.We ordered 4 share items between the 3 of us and it seemed to be enough. They came out in two's in great time. With how busy it was, the kitchen was on fire! Thank you for your attention.For Myself-The Herbed Fries- pretty good side order but I've def had better fries for less.The Glazed Ribs- Probably the black sheep of the group or items ordered. Was not to fond of the sauce but the meat slide off the bone which was great.Overall positive experience due to our server, the bartender upstairs and the quality and speed up most of the food. I know it can be tough accommodating all arrivals with a busy night on the books but I think this place could benefit from regular check in's with patrons on the queue list informing them of the status of their table. I would have appreciated to know my table was almost ready 30 minutes after my reservation instead of having to check in with the hostess. I plan on returning.",0,0,0,Will A.,"Montclair, NJ",64,84,211
2.0,9/1/2016,"The food itself was good. The chicken/waffles were a miss, but the food really was overall very good. We loved the donuts, huevos rancheros tacos, and several other dishes. (except the Bloody Mary... they were weird/terrible)The experience was just so dampened by the service. It was a group of 10 for my 40th birthday. There with me were my parents and closest friends. The waiter, Matthew, was so atrociously bad and rude that I was embarrassed. It was a really special occasion. I was excited about my 40th birthday brunch, and honestly, Matthew had us all uncomfortable. He didn't even greet us in a friendly way. The whole time he was sour he had to be there. He might have even asked if it was our first time there or celebrating anything. I might have even been okay with that if he were efficient. You gotta be lovely or efficient, but if neither, a problem we have. Several in my group have been in the service industry. Besides being a large group, which naturally means wanting more overall, we weren't at all difficult. The place was busy. We get it. It would have made it easier to have seated us upstairs vs. in the way of everyone on the downstairs floor. We get that's not Matthew's fault. It certainly is on him that he didn't even come to the table for a full 15 minutes, though. He also then took another 20 to bring coffees. We had 11:30 reservations, which is when they open. We were on-time. How were other tables getting food before anyone at our table even got their coffee? And knowing we had to make reservations through their ""events team"", I was surprised a Manager never stopped by the table. Had that happened, maybe this could have been resolved. I'm not the type to demand a Manager, so there wasn't a natural opportunity to get things running better. I get being busy. I even get honestly simply not being very good at the job or making mistakes. My issue is that Matthew acted burdened by having to do his job. I got the $25 deal for unlimited select drinks within 90 minutes. First round took about 20 minutes. When he brought it I asked if that's when the clock was starting. That hardly seemed like an unreasonable question given the 90 minute limit. Instead of apologizing for it being late or just politely telling me that of course he'll start it from when I actually receive my first drink, Matthew went on for literally nearly a minute about how they are very busy, and are doing the best they can, and we'll have to be patient. Dude! I wasn't rude in how I asked. No need for the lecture. And never did he make it the least bit about me. It was about him and how he was busy.I took care of the tab and did tip about 22% because while Matthew didn't the least bit deserve it, I didn't want to be a jerk and also did want to make sure that the lovely young woman helping him would get something nice from us. It's rare I take to Yelp, but I've called the Stanton Social a few times and no one saw fit to call me back.

5.0,8/26/2016,The food was great and the drinks were a little too sweet. Our server was excellent but what really kicked it was the 90s hip hop.

I'll admit I had pretty low expectations; you just never know what to expect when a restaurant is known foremost as a ~place to be seen.~ But the food actually lived up to the hype!We ordered the pierogies, mac and cheese, beef wellington, pea-crusted salmon, and several cocktails.The pierogies were incredible -- this may have been the most memorable dish for me. I loved how the pesto and warm onions combined to create a crazy complex bite. The Mac and cheese was awesome too, and I'd 100% order that beef Wellington again. I have no idea how they managed to make the meat so tender without sacrificing the texture of the dough. Ugh, so good. The pea-crusted salmon was tasty, nothing to write home about.I enjoyed how each dish was divided into shareable mini portions. And for all that food, the bill was shockingly doable (heaven bless the East Village!) The service was OK. The wait staff was clearly overwhelmed but they did their best.

They had me at french onion soup dumplings. In the end I took the leap of faith. My husband and I choose the french onion soup dumplings, the beef and broccoli, the chicken arepas, the social mac and cheese, and the pierogies. The beef and broccoli and the dumplings were by far my favorite!! The beef and broccoli was tremendous. I almost took an elbow to my husband to get the last bite.

2.0,8/17/2016,"This review is based on my Restaurant Week experience, but I feel like it can apply to the overall experience of the place. Stanton Social does not live up to the hype it's gotten here.I'm honestly shocked that this place has such good reviews. It has a fun atmosphere with upbeat music, but the food was inconsistent, underwhelming and overpriced.I came here with two other people, so we were able to try almost everything on the restaurant week menu.For appetizers, we ordered the coconut curry samosas, nori spiced tuna poke wonton, and crispy barrio-style chicken taquitos. The coconut curry samosas were subpar, with an overpowering curry flavor and absolutely no hint of coconut. We enjoyed the nori spiced tuna poke wonton. It was light and refreshing. The taquitos were easily forgettable.For main course, we ordered the 'mexican street corn' ravioli, mango-jagermeister glazed baby back ribs, and wasabi pea custed salmon. The ravioli pieces probably only had three kernels in each piece. I felt like I was just eating dough. It was also pretty tasteless. The baby back ribs were actually pretty good. The meat fell off the bones and was very tender. The salmon was very disappointing. It lacked flavor, was not slightly crispy on the outside, and was just really bland overall. It was lukewarm when we got it, and there was way too much pesto.For dessert, we got all three. Lemon meringue twinkie, warm doughnuts, and chocolate peanut butter cake pops. All three was just okay. The doughnuts came with three different dipping sauces. The cake pops were too heavy and sticky.We also ordered the french onion soup dumplings per our waitress' recommendation because she said it's their most popular item. They were pretty disappointing. I love the smell of french onion soup, but this dish did not have the typical smell. It was actually kind of pungent. The only good thing about this dish was the cheese on top. Everything else was pretty tasteless.I think the whole restaurant week experience was severely thrown off because of all the different mixtures of cuisines. Eating the ribs after the salmon confused our taste palette, certain dishes were excellent while others really lacked in flavor. I feel like if Stanton Social focused on one type of cuisine, their dishes would be way better.",0,0,0,Elain T.,"New York, NY",631,169,121
2.0,8/16/2016,"I almost want to give this one star because the service was so awful, but the food redeemed this spot. I heard about this restaurant after seeing the Head Chef on Chopped. I was excited to see this as an option for Restaurant Week and my girlfriends and I were really looking forward to our meal here. The service rendered this meal unenjoyable and rubbed us all the wrong way from start to finish. Definitely not what we expected from a $$$$ restaurant. The whole place had a flippant club vibe of 'we don't really care if you're here'1. The waitress told my friend and I 2 different things about what was on the happy hour menu (Only west coast oysters, not the east coast). If she was new, she could have mentioned this beforehand. She also thought that we needed to close out at the bar before moving to our meal - which was rectified by the hostess.2. The hostesses were uppity and not friendly. Our bad not explaining that we were going to be short one person for dinner, so we started later. She was absolutely unapologetic about having to kick us out at 8:15. (Original reservation for 6:30, we told her we were all ready at 6:50, no one came to check on us in between)3. Following up on this... 1) our check arrived while we were eating dessert; 2) a busboy was wiping the table while we were paying the bill and got crumbs on my friends lap in his hurried sweeping motions.4. The waiter wasn't knowledgeable, wasn't aware of the ingredients for the pesto. And frankly being Asian - I am a little offended by an item named 'asian pesto' because it has fish sauce in it. I will end on a good note, the food was good, definitely above average though the service made it less memorable. I recommend the poke tacos, samosas, and ""Asian"" salmon.

I wish they had the option to add a piece if the group of people is 5 just so that everyone at the table can at least taste what they are paying for. The waiter told us that the most favored dish was the french onion soup dumplings. We ordered this and no one liked it. It had an odd smell and taste to it and there was no soup in the dumplings... The chicken and waffles was very average and I've definitely had better in the city. We thought the mac and cheese and the breakfast bruchetta were decent, but nothing spectacular.

4.0,7/20/2016,"I went to the Stanton Social with two friends for brunch on my birthday. Wonderful ambiance, friendly service and delicious tapas. I would definitely recommend ordering several dishes, due to the fact that the tapas are small in portion size. We ordered the following: Caramelized Banana Pancakes - The pancakes were smaller than I expected, but the smoky flavor of the buttery syrup truly made the dish special. I would have preferred more caramelized bananas. Goat Cheese Pierogies - These were absolutely delicious. The goat cheese was perfectly tart, and they were paired with an onion/garlic cream. French Onion Soup Dumplings - These were a must try. The dumplings were nice and hot, bursting with sweet onion flavor and covered in melted cheese. Fish Tacos - The battered fish was perfectly seasoned, topped with a refreshing cabbage slaw. However, instead of placing a tiny dab of aioli on the side, perhaps a sauce to finish the fish tacos would add that needed flavor. Warm Doughnuts w/ Fudge sauce - Soft, fried pillows of doughnuts with cinnamon sugar and bittersweet chocolate was a perfect finish to a lovely brunch. Overall, the Stanton Social was a lovely restaurant with great dishes to share. However, if you dislike tiny portions, this is not the place for you.",0,0,0,Heather O.,"Philadelphia, PA",129,65,146

My original tip was about 20%, so it's super disheartening to have them try to charge me more than the tip of me and my friend combined.

2.0,7/14/2016,"You know...it's such a disappointment that I have to write this review. I dined there in March and the reason for my review NOW, three months later, is because I still haven't heard back from management about my experience. I emailed someone named Michelle to explain but since they disregarded me via email and in person, I felt a review was necessary. My cousin came into town to celebrate a mini bachelorette weekend with me before getting married. She wanted to have a really fun night out in the city and so she made reservations at Stanton Social for a Friday evening at 9pm. Of course, as most places in NYC are, it was jam packed! Understandable. We were sent to the top bar and checked in every 20 minutes to see how long til we could sit. The hostess was incredibly rude each time we checked. Now, I know it's annoying to her that people check in on a table time but also, that is her job. At one point she told another customer and myself to ""calm down, it's NYC and you should know we're packed"" when we got upset after an hour of waiting and she said there was still 7 tables waiting to pay and leave. Astonishing. Anyway, we were finally told we could sit after an hour and 25 minutes. With very full drinks in hand, the person who sat us didn't bring them to the table, didn't offer a round of drinks, didn't apologize for the ridiculous wait, etc. I was not looking for anything free at all, I understand how the industry works, but Stanton Social didn't care in the least that they made us wait so long with a reservation and didn't bother to try to rectify any situation. What makes it ALL WORSE, is that I tried to email in to explain my experience before having to tell the world with a review and never received a response. The food was delicious. It's a shame because I'll NEVER be back and have made sure all my friends as well know about the crap experience we had. I understand wait times, but show some respect to your customers. Not everyone cares about the scene at your restaurant - you should care about people coming back time and again and you've lost me as a customer for life.",0,0,0,Sam R.,"New York, NY",0,14,0

The food was quite good. If this review was based on food alone I would give it 4/5. We had French onion soup dumplings, sliders, fish tacos, and Cobb salad - everything was quite good.

5.0,7/11/2016,"My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on Friday, and it lived up to all of our expectations! It was smaller than we thought and busy when we got there for our 8pm reservation. We were seated quickly, but it was very loud and hard to hear each other across the table at first, which was annoying. But once we started drinking and eating we were too consumed with our meal to care. This place is a must if you're in NYC!Drinks: First, I had the Grapefruit Herringbone which was delicious. Pretty sweet but also strong, which I liked. For my second drink I had the Strawberry Fields, which was also really good. There were crushed strawberries at the bottom which at first seemed weird, but were a good addition and very fresh to enjoy with the drink. This drink was sweeter than the first one. My boyfriend had whiskey on the rocks.Food: Everything on the menu is small plates and meant to be shared, so we shared 5 items and then dessert. Tuna poke wontons: very much a SMALL plate. There were three very miniature tuna tacos (like the size of my thumb), but they were really good. The crushed wasabi peas on top was more of a paste, and was not hot like straight wasabi. Oysters: came with a few sauces. They were fresh and very tasty, nothing different than any other good oyster out there. Kobe beef slider and crab cake slider: They were each a good size and well cooked. The kobe beef was my favorite, and my boyfriend loved the crab cake. They both had either aioli or another sauce on it, which went well with each. They both came with a few chips that were also a good side addition.Lamb gyros: These were good, but not great. The tzaziki was really good on top, and there was nothing wrong with these, just not our favorite. These were also pretty miniature, comes with three of them.Beef and broccoli: This was short rib on a sticky rice cake with pureed broccoli. The sticky rice was really good, and the short rib was fine, but nothing special compared to other items. I would skip this one next time. The broccoli was also fine.  Dessert: Do not skip dessert here. It is 100% worth it. We got two birthday cake milkshake shots that had whiskey with birthday cake ice cream in them. We felt like we had to try them at $4 each, because I love birthday cake flavored anything. Although I would expect a different type of alcohol other than whiskey to be in them, they were pretty good. They whiskey aftertaste was a little much for me mixed with birthday cake flavor, but they were pretty good for a shot sized treat. We also had the warm doughnuts that come with chocolate, caramel and berry dipping sauce. These might have been the best doughnut bites I've ever had. They were covered in sugar and warm and doughy on the inside. I loved the chocolate and caramel sauces but didn't care for the berry, but my boyfriend liked it. These were seriously to die for and you have to get them if you come here. SO good, and a good size portion too, I think there was 6 of them.",0,0,0,Molly F.,"New York, NY",0,17,6

3.0,7/9/2016,"My friend and I came here on a Thursday night. A very popular place it seems. There is a doorman checking IDs for anyone wishing to enter the upstairs bar/semi lounge area.The ambiance is low lighting, but still with an open friendly atmosphere. The whole back wall is a huge wine rack, which I thought was a nice, unique touch.The waitress was kind enough to explain how the menu works, mainly appetizers to share, though it is rather small appetizers, so I would suggest at least 2, probably 3 per a group of 2.We ordered the French Onion Soup Dumplings that everyone seemed so keen about. Neither my friend, nor I was much impressed with them. The way they were displayed in the bowl was cute and different, but the taste just wasn't there. It had the remnants of a french onion soup taste, but with a lack of luster.The potato & goat cheese pierogies were of another world! So much flavor, and the truffle creme served on the side as the ""dipping sauce"" was divine! They could probably open a little shop right next to it and make a killing off the sales. DELICIOUS! We were tempted to just scoop it up and eat it (seriously that good).Red snapper tacos were okay. They were 3 mini tacos, about 2 bites with a piece of lightly fried fish inside. I don't think they were worth the $14 price tag.Side note: be forewarned, the sliders are tricky the way they are worded - it is only ONE slider that comes per order.

We eventually find it, have drinks, and are presently someone else's bill. We get our bill but our credit card was forgotten. During dinner, one surly server spills the beer on one of our party, does not apologize, takes one of our napkins to clean it up, and purposefully clanks and makes noise removing the plate of beer. Mind you, the server spilt the beer. A new napkin is never brought. After all this, who cares what the food tastes like? Yeah, it was cute, clever tapas. Very sweet veggie burger slider. Overly sweet coconut curry samosas. Scalding hot French Onion Soup dumplings. No oreo pancakes on the menu.

Gazpachos to start weren't announced, and were unevenly filled, and they took away one of our two sets of silverware and didn't really acknowledge the oversight when we asked for the second. The 30% off helped with the bill for what wasn't much food, as did the Citi extra perk of one complimentary specialty cocktail per person (the Off the Cuff was strong but lacking character). Their widely-renowned french onion soup dumplings were a bit of a letdown; we definitely preferred the goat cheese pierogies. The red snapper tacos were messy and not great.

4.0,5/9/2016,"The location in my opinion is not ideal, but I'd probably still go back here because the food is outstanding. You'll need about 8-10 options for a party of 5 if you're doing the brunch, but all of the ones we had were excellent. Pricing was fairly reasonable as well. Our bill came out to under $300 and that included three cocktails and dessert. The caramelized pancakes and the pirogies are as good as advertised. I could eat an entire plate by myself, but unfortunately I had to share. Service is pretty solid as well, we never had to wait too long for our server even though it was pretty busy when we arrived. The interior is very nice and has an upscale feel to it, but the place is very cramped. You kind of have to snake your way through the tables and even the seating itself feels tight if you're in the booths, but the food more than makes up for it. Probably not the best place for a big group, though 4-5 people is doable.",1,0,0,Devin B.,"New York, NY",458,125,10
4.0,5/8/2016,"So I headed the warnings from other Yelpers that they don't seat you at the time of your reservation and send you to the upstairs lounge first for drinks and knew beforehand that the wait could be anywhere from a half hour to an hour before we were seated. I think it's great as long as you make your reservation earlier than the time you actually want to eat. I enjoyed the opportunity to experience both spaces. The lounge upstairs is charming and a great place to start off the night with drinks. The downstairs seating area is a different vibe (little more noisy) but also nice decor. The only thing that was a minus was that there was only one bathroom downstairs- a single private unisex bathroom, so the wait is long. The food was good. I loved the chicken arepas, which I almost did not order because I didn't think they sounded exciting enough and boy, was I wrong. They were delicious and ended up being my favorite thing. The scallops are also very good. My guest and I were not a fans of the goat cheese pierogies but I think it's one of those love-hate items. We also had some sort of tuna tartar taco starter that was also quite delicious.",0,0,0,Annie L.,"Manhattan, NY",17,88,195

Their rudeness was an affront and I hope that they get the same level of customer service that they dish out. Besides that the French onion dumplings are the thing that foodie dreams are made of.

4.0,5/1/2016,"We went here for brunch and were generally very happy about the place. The best part was the tapas style servings to be shared which allows you to try a lot of different things. The downside is that the portion sizes are so small that you need to order atleast 8 things between 4 people, making it a tad bit more expensive than a typical brunch. Everything we ordered was delicious and my favorites here were the Oreo pancakes, chicken taquitos and the crab cake sliders.  The cocktails were great and I would definitely recommend the Vietnamese coffee.The ambience is great and we had no complaints with the service.

Also, they say it's all small plates, but they're pretty decent portion sizes, which is nice.

3.0,5/1/2016,"I decided to come here due to the great Yelp reviews on the French Onion Soup Dumplings.  It seemed everyone was raving about them.  Our waiter recommended ordering 5 to 6 ""tapas"" to share for dinner.  As someone that frequents Spanish tapas bars, I trusted his judgment.  This proved to be a very daunting task, as the 'Chicken n' Waffles' alone could have been my whole meal (and trust, I can eat).Here is what we ordered (and how I graded):--- 'Chicken n' Waffles' - C+... The flavor was lacking in this dish, but it was creative--- Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies - A... I hate goat cheese, but YUM--- French Onion Soup Dumplings - B+... My friend loved them; I thought they were pretty good--- House Brined 'Pastrami Reuben' - C... No wow factor, but not a terrible choice--- Old School Meatballs - B...

4.0,4/30/2016,"Stanton Social has very typical goods and bads. Goods: solid tapas plates, decent cocktail choices. Bads: too noisy, almost impossible to make conversations, mediocre service.Good*1: Basically if you read Yelp carefully and step-by-step follow suggestions, you would not end up with wrong dishes. French onion soup dumpling, red snapper taco, scallop risotto were musts. Believe they spent lots of time recreating traditional western dishes and adding new elements into it. Good*2: many fruity drinks that were suitable for girls - my friend and I loved our strawberry/grapefruit cocktails.Bad*1: oh my. I think about 90% time when I was trying to communicate, I had to shout really hard to make sure that my friend could hear me. Very unorganized. Bad*2: no one came to us during our dinner and checked on our food and stuff, really felt like we were being left alone.To be honest I don't really care about service, so long as food itself could justify its fame. In this case, I took away one star from the originally five-star rating, for everything that I did not quite enjoy.",16,8,15,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1221,1748,5633
2.0,4/29/2016,The food was alright but nothing special especially for the portions and price. Fun to check off the list but never going back. Multiple groups around us were squeezed into tables and constantly had waiters bumping into dinners.

5.0,4/29/2016,"This is one of my favorite places!They make sharing food with the people you're with so much easier.Lots of great ""tapas"" and they even accommodate for the amount of people you're with, so if you order something that only comes with 4 pieces, they will let you order 5 pieces instead, amazing!My favorite thing to share are the FRENCH ONION SOUP DUMPLINGS....they come in the cutest little dumpling ceramic dish with a nice thick layer of cheese crusted on top of the dumplings.  Don't let them take that dish away without peeling off and eating all the cheese crusted on the ceramic, you might need to fight over the pieces of dangling, crusted cheese like I did the last time I was there, haha.Other great items: Pastrami Reuben Quesadilla, Mini Lamb Gyro, Chicken and Waffles.But guys, the last time I went, the group wanted to each get their own thing so I begrudgingly obliged and ordered SARAH'S BIG SEXY BURGER and my mind was blown away.One of THE BEST burgers I've had ever.  The meat was cooked perfectly medium, perfectly pink in the middle with the most delicious bacon jam.  and this comes with a DOUBLE PATTY, but it's really thin so it wasn't too meaty.I can NOT wait to come back for the burger!",1,0,0,Sheila C.,"Manhattan, NY",144,215,45

The other waiter we had maybe came by twice to see if we needed anything and that's it. The staff was polite but nothing to make you feel special or attended to. The dessert : sucked. We had the ""Bird's Nest."" It tasted like store-bought whipped cream and not even the good one. The food was presented nicely but it's nothing special. We had chicken and waffles and the chicken had no flavor whatsoever. The only good thing here are the drinks. If you're here for drinks, they were on point.

5.0,4/22/2016,"It was so incredibly delicious! One of things I didn't realize until getting there was that it is actually a Tapas Bar and therefore all of dishes are essentially the size of an appetizer (3/4 pieces per ""entree""), and every dish costs from $10-$50. This place is not cheap, but it was definitely delicious. Everything that we ordered was perfectly made. We ordered about 6/7 dishes to share amongst 3 people and dessert.

3.0,4/21/2016,"I've been to the lounge upstairs for drinks a few times over the years but had dinner in the restaurant for the first time this week. I wish the lounge and restaurant could have separate ratings.I would give the lounge 4 stars as a great place to have drinks and a night out. Great ambiance and decor, good cocktails. Had some food as snacks but nothing memorable.For dinner in the restaurant, I give 3 stars. Friends wanted to try the famed French onion soup dumplings. I never heard of them from anyone or anywhere until my friend said it a week ago. Not knowing anything about them, the only expectation I had was from it's name. My friend who tried it first immediately said ""overrated"" and I have to agree. When the dish was brought to the table, the runner warned us that it was very hot and suggested that we wait a few moments before digging in. We maybe gave it a minute. Because the dish has ""soup dumpling"" in its name, I thought of Asian soup dumplings and was anticipating a similar experience. However, we were sadly disappointed that there was no soup to drink inside the dumpling or drip down our chins. The filling was a bunch of soft caramelized onions and no liquid soup. Just calling them French onion dumplings (omit ""soup"") or caramelized onion dumplings would be more appropriate. The generous melted cheese topping mimics French onion soup, but the flavor of the filling was just okay. The dumpling skin also had a slightly plasticky texture.Our waiter suggested 6-7 plates for 3 people to share. The dishes were served 2 at a time and we did end up feeling full with the last dishes. The rest of the dishes were seasoned well, some with okay flavors, and others that were a little better. But nothing stood out where I'd suggest the restaurant for dinner.Chicken Taquitos - the menu should say taquito (singular) because it was one taquito cut up into 4 bite size pieces. The chicken didn't stand out and it's an okay dish.Charred Octopus - this was one of the better dishes. Well seasoned, tender octopus, and some nice spicy heat from the harissa.Beef Wellington - this is a larger or main dish. Size is what I'd expect for beef Wellington and rich with fois gras. It was tasty and the filet mignon was tender. We ordered medium temperature but the beef was cooked to medium rare.Chicken & waffles - small piece of chicken on one small waffle. Tasty but would have liked the waffle to be crispier. Also well seasonedSocial Mac & Cheese - menu says Italian sausage but the sausage used tasted more like a chorizo to me. Not bad just a bolder flavor than expected.",0,0,0,Nicole D.,"New York, NY",20,346,225
3.0,4/20/2016,"Food is a 10, amazing, small dishes that make everybody happy.  Price was clearly high but still excellent.  The only problem is they cleared our plates away before we were finished, and had the next table stand over us until we left.  When we complained that they took wine and food away their response was, ""we are busy.""  No manager available.  I will go back for the food, and at the same time be more aggressive when they try to take food away.",0,0,0,Jake L.,"New Rochelle, NY",0,8,0

They are definitely more dumpling that soup which is disappointing and threw off the flavor. All of the other bites range from above average to delicious but you won't be missing out if you pass on the dumplings. The best thing here, hands down, is the goat cheese pierogie. My friend and I could not believe how incredibly flavorful and well done they were. You HAVE to try it.The vibes are really what Stanton Social are known for. It's a trendy place with a good place list. The crowd is younger and it's fun to kick it with your friends in this very New York, LES spot. The service varies depending on the night. But that Notorious FIG - one of the best cocktails that I've had in Manhattan. I recommend stopping in to try it. Also, the birthday cake shots are wonderful.

I understand that the price point is expected for Manhattan, but paying about $20 for each small plate to be shared with at max 2 people is a bit much. All and all, I enjoyed everything I sampled (Kobe beef slider, rigatoni bolognese, butternut squash ravioli,herb dusted fries, and mushrooms). My Strawberry Fields cocktail was just ok, very small. The place was super crowded on a Saturday night, and the tables are jam-packed close together.  I had to shout over the loud music to have a conversation with the person I went there with. I would not recommend this place for an intimate date, but it's definitely worth checking out for food.... if you're feeling overly pretentious  and don't mind spending a lot of money for a few bites of grub.

1.0,3/27/2016,"I've been to Stanton Social twice, and both times (spaced a full year apart) their treatment of their customers was abysmal.First time: We had a 6 pm reservation on a Saturday.  Four out of five girls arrived on time, and the fifth was stuck on a disabled train.  (Not much you can do about that.)  The dining room was 90% empty but they refused to seat us and forced us to give up our reservation. We went to the lounge and had drinks and small plates.  Food was fine, drinks were fine, but they should've just seated us and let us order without our fifth person (as we said we'd do). Not a great experience, but I figured that maybe they were just sticklers for reservation times.  Oh, how wrong I was...The second time I went, we had a reservation for 6 at 9:30 pm on a Saturday.  Remembering last time, we arrived at 9:10 to be safe and went upstairs for drinks in the lounge.  Once we got up to the lounge, it was so packed you truly could not move - let alone get to the bar.  Moreover, everyone around us was in large groups, saying they were still waiting for reservations from 8:30 and earlier.  We probably should've left then, but we were overly optimistic and stayed to wait for our table.  9:30 rolled around and we checked in again - no table.  We checked in at 10 - no table.  We checked in at 10:30, *a full hour after our reservation,* and still no table.  At that point, we left and tried to figure out where to eat on a Saturday in the LES at 10:30 pm, with a large party.  (Hint:  this is hard.)  Finally, at 11 pm, we got a text from Stanton Social that our table was ready.  At that point, it was NINETY MINUTES after our reservation time.  Ninety minutes!  That's an insane delay, especially without any apology or courteousness or even - gasp - comped drinks from the bar.  Obviously, we did not go back for the food.Anyway, those are my two experiences here.  First-world frustrations for sure, but I'd wholeheartedly advise you to spend your money elsewhere.  This place is miserable.",4,0,0,Bridget B.,"Manhattan, NY",194,23,0

They were all very good for sharing among the three of us. For entrees, two of us has ribs and the other had a burger.The ribs were OK - they weren't bad, but I've definitely had better ones at other restaurants and I think the Stanton Social does a decent job on hyping up the dish, but it was just alright. The burger looked alright - I don't know if I would have wanted to spend so much money on a burger here though - I feel like there wasn't any other allure for the burger other than it's ""big and sexy"" name (and it wasn't even that big tbh, lol).The desserts were alright - the chocolate dessert definitely tasted better than all the other options we had.Would I come back?

I would come back to pregame a night out in a comfortable, classy environment.Also, it's fine to only serve sliders, but they were distinctly, differently named and yet the same size as my ""big sexy"" thang. Drinks were strong, mac and cheese looked scrumptious, but I didn't try it. I did try one cousin's samosas, which were interesting, but everything here is tiny and the tables don't really allow room for your plates AND your drinks. That's troubling in a place like this. Nice spot, underwhelming food, fun atmosphere for a nice time out with your friends. The movie theater sundae is amazing, and I'd probably pay $14 for it again, but I can just make my own- with a better kind of brownie- at home.",5,2,1,Chloe C.,"Manhattan, NY",229,199,1033

You look like you're from Wisconsin.""Me: ""oh...."" smile fading.4.5 stars...I really liked this place!  A dark, apparently 3 story slightly unassuming LES building houses this restaurant/bar that is owned by a chef of ""Chopped"" fame (I can't tell you more about that because I spend my money at places like this, and thus, no cable.). There was a darkish more formal dining room on the first floor. We asked about the bar and were directed to a long staircase through a door to the left to ascend to the second story bar - apparently there's a third floor too? (My Milwaukee brethren will take note this place reminded me of a darker Eve back when it first opened and served food.) Upstairs, we found a bar, more seating and a sunken loungy area where we were able to luckily snag one of the brown leather coaches that offered table service for food and drinks. There were small larger groups (many ladies and some dudes) celebrating/birthdays and whatever else even early in the evening (7-8ish).Drinks - I ordered something called ""The Social Tea"" & it was just perfect. I tried a friends jalapeño margarita and it was pretty good. Other fun names: The Notorious F.I.G., Dead Presidents, Sage advice.They also had (it looked like) bottle service.Food: its mainly tapas but it looked like they had a few bigger dishes.

There's a bar upstairs with a little lounge as well while the restaurant dining is downstairs. The decor is really neat, and the dim lighting adds to the ambience. My three friends and I reserved this place for 9:15 and we were seated right away! They gave us a free little appetizer which was nice. I've been to their sister restaurant Beauty and Essex so I was able to see a little bit of the similarities. Their French onion soup dumplings were good, but not as delicious as we hoped they would be. Be careful they are hot! LOVED THE RAVIOLI!!! Our favorite for sure and the individual flavors were ah-Mazing. The fluke was good but not memorable. Definitely fresh though! The veggie sliders I think were one of the best I have ever had- I think my friend and I enjoyed it more than we would with meat!!! I really want to know what's inside their veggie patty because it really was something. YUMMMM!!!The Kobe slider was very delicious too! My friend definitely enjoyed it and ate it all up in a matter of minutes! The side chips were a great pair with the sliders and added a great kick! The Greek custard was the PERFECT ENDING. Light and sweet but not over bearing. They look like little bird nests!! Haha so cute and the presentations were well done :)Servers were all very kind and attentive.

2.0,3/11/2016,"Glad we tried.....but would not go back. Found it loud, dimly lit, overcrowded and over priced. Too bad because we read a lot of good reviews on Stanton Social (which I am really surprised by) but they certainly did not live up to them for our group.Our reservation was for 7 PM, but when we got there on time, the table wasn't ready. That's not too uncommon so we waited patiently for our table. The hostess directed us to the bar upstairs until our table was ready. The bar upstairs was extremely loud, crowded, and HOT. I was dying - I would have rather waited outside in the rain, but thankfully our table was ready in 30 minutes. We went back downstairs to the main area excited to be seated and away from the crowded bar. The hostess proceeded to take us to the back of the restaurant, up 3 more flights of stairs - where we admire the beautiful décor of the restaurant from above, but to our surprise.... we just ended up back in the bar area. Just why? Disappointed cannot even begin to describe what I was feeling. The atmosphere upstairs was a bit unpleasant for a good dining experience. It was too dark, even to see the menu, and too loud to have a conversation. We literally had to use the light from our iphones in order to read anything off the menu. The server recommended 2 -3 tapas per person and we found the food to be inconsistent. A few of the small plates were great - including the Red Snapper Tacos ($11) and Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies ($10), but the others were less than stellar. Their signature dish of French Onion Soup Dumplings ($14) ended up being cold, heavy and lumpy - we didn't see what was so ""signature"" about this dish was. The Rigatoni Bolognese ($18) was a complete miss as well - it was completely bland and had a strange mint taste to it. Wasn't a fan. Overall, portions were tiny and food was way too expensive for what it's worth. I didn't find the dishes to be good enough for the cost and didn't enjoy being crammed in an extremely loud and dark room.",3,1,1,Syyu C.,"Manhattan, NY",567,274,1485

Drinks were ok. I got the strawberry field, which was slightly sweet but tolerable.

My boyfriend ordered the notorious FIG and even though I don't like bourbon, I thought this drink was very well made.  We ended up being seated an hour after our original reservation time.  Needless to say a few of us were very hungry.If you're reading this and you haven't gone yet do not believe what the waitress recommends. We were a party of 7 and she suggested we order 8 dishes as they are meant to be shared.  If she had recommend 16 - 18 dishes this would have been more appropriate.  Our table ended ordering 14 dishes and most of us left feeling hungry. Portions are small and really meant to be shared between 2 - 3 people at most.  The tacos were amazing and had great favor.  If you have a little bit of a sweet tooth the donuts are a must try. I also tried the perogis and samosas, not my favorite flavor profiles but def above average.The atmosphere after you're able to squeeze passed the crowded awkward entrance is gorgeous.  However the chaos on the coat check and general mass of people by the door as well as the door opening into the dining area/ hitting you if you and the door opener are not paying attention was weird.I loved the idea and ambitions of SS but I hoped for a better experience.",0,0,0,Gui Bin Z.,"New York, NY",61,279,8
3.0,2/9/2016,"Stanton Social was a pleasant dining experience. I went there on a double date during restaurant week to take advantage of their menu. My gf and I arrived early so we headed up to the bar to have a couple drinks while we waited. My gf ordered the Notorious F I G and liked it enough to order a second one when we went down to the restaurant. The lobby is extremely small and was cramping all the people waiting for tables. The awkward doors and hallways there don't make the situation any better. We got seated on the second floor right near the edge so we could look down and see the entire restaurant. Originally, we were planning to do Restaurant Week orders, but changed our minds when most of us said that we were not hungry. One person ordered the poke tacos, the ribs, and the smores cake off the RW menu, but the rest of us ordered a la carte. The tacos were tiny, but delicious (not sure if they are worth the price though). The ribs were a bigger portion than I thought (5 or 6 large pieces) and were cooked perfectly, meat falling right off the bone. The French Onion Soup Dumplings sound and look better than they taste - I meant, they were fine, but I was expecting more.  I ordered the skirt steak which was cooked at a nice medium rare. Again, nothing special here and it felt a tad bit bland. My gf had the scallops and was good, but not memorable. We ended the night with the Birthday Cake Ice Cream shots which, again, theme-of-the-night, were good but not worth the tag.

We were less than 6 inches away from the other patrons. Between the music & being so close to the other tables, I could barely hear the waitress & had to almost yell to my friend across the table. If you have a party size larger than 2 you might luck out and get a booth. PRO: Service was well paced & professional. My cocktail was yummy & strong. Mixed Bag: Foods was hit or miss: The ribs & chicken (from the chicken-n-waffles) were both dry. Desserts (donuts & tiramisu) were delicious. French onion soup dumplings ARE amazing.

5.0,2/4/2016,"My mind would have never dreamed up to fill a dumpling with French Onion soup and cover it in a crispy shell of Gruyere, but this is one of many reasons why I crush Chris Santos' cuisine so hard. On a bleak and rainy Wednesday evening I sought comfort from the wind and lack of umbrella etiquette in those very dumplings. Waiting at the bar upstairs, I ordered the Hemingway - a gin based drink that tasted like perfume with a refreshing after glow of grapefruit. I seriously would have made out with strangers just to share the experience with them. The table gods were kind and after a few minutes of sipping upstairs we were led to a booth on the lower level with plenty of space to order to our hearts delight, which we OBVIOUSLY did! Dumplings aside, the mac and cheese with spicy sausage was more comfort in a small tureen, as were the charred octopus salad with bits of feta and the crispy chicken taquitos. Another round of Hemingways and intense ""girl talk"" led us to order the final comfort food of the evening, the Warm Doughnuts with three kinds of dipping sauces. I was tipsy and dopamined out of my mind when suddenly a birthday cupcake appeared with a single lit candle. Oh, Chris, you shouldn't have!!!

Props to them for that.Everyone had a lot to drink the other night so coffee was the only drink ordered. We started off having the granola, which was surprisingly really creamy and delicious, it was called berry granola, it had just strawberries but the home made granola more than made up for the lack of berry variety. We had the red snapper tacos, which weren't my favorite honestly. The breakfast bruschetta was probably my favorite dish at brunch, perfectly scrambled with yummy Asiago and the crunch that the toast gives made it fantastic. We also tried the veggie slider and the pizetta, they were both very tasty. 5 dishes for 3 people was more than we could handle. So unfortunately we didn't try desserts.The service was great from start to finish. Without drinks our total I think was about 60$, really reasonable.

He interacted with us and made personal recommendations, he was a pleasure.  We had the red snapper tacos, empanadas, mac and cheese, perogies, beef and broccoli, French onion balls (those were just ok) and the Steak inside the puff pastry and everything was delish!  I love the concept of the restaurant that everything comes out when ready and the table shares, definitely good for groups.  For dessert we ordered the greek dessert and the donuts w the dipping sauce... though these weren't bad, I wasn't exactly wowed as with the dinner.  I don't eat chocolate otherwise I would've had the Sundae with popcorn which looked great every time it passed by me, which was a lot... it seems to be the popular item.  I would def recommend this restaurant but more for a special occasion or special group night, it's pricy.  It was two of us and the bill was $200+.  But it was definitely worth it.  I think I've been to all the Chopped judges' restaurants and this one is leading the pack!

This place is small plates and we order everything from the RW menu and overall from appetizers to dessert was good. But i wasn't comfy eating in a booth where i am squished among my friends. they make you sit in a small booth with like 6-7 people, with jackets and your purses it was impossible. Honestly this place lost its stars because of the ridic charge fee they have... whyyyyyyyyy i really dont understand why restaurants charge people cutting fees per person when they are bringing in their own cake and still ordering from your damn menu.... whatever fee is fine, $5 per person almost cost just as much as the cake. so yeah just really upset about the fee and the comfort-ness. :X",0,0,0,Kaitlyn Y.,"New York, NY",40,300,132

They were able to accommodate me on short notice. Every time I had to change the party size, Amanda was super sweet and helpful. They were even able to make separate meals for one of my guests who was gluten free. Everything was set up and ready when we got there. We had a cool table right in the middle of the restaurant.

5.0,1/31/2016,"You get what you pay for.This is probably one of the swankiest spots on the LES. The servers recommend that each person order 3 tapas each (to share, or not) for a full meal. Each tapa runs around $15. So dinner for 2 would be like $90 without drinks, desserts, etc. It adds up fast! That being said, I had a great time dining there and loved the creative menu! The French Onion Soup Dumplings are very popular and inventive, but I would not say it was the best thing I tried there. The stand outs to me were the potato and goat cheese pierogies, coconut curry samosas, and the pastrami reuben quesadilla.  There are many other things I want to try but simply did not have the stomach capacity to handle :DA lot of the desserts looked really interesting, but I only had room for the birthday cake milkshake shots that have a little bourbon in them. It definitely does NOT have to be your birthday to enjoy those -- they were stronger than I expected!I definitely want to come back some time when I want to impress someone or feel like I'm in the ""treat yo'self"" mindset.

I was disappointed when I first arrived and they had pushed our reservation back by about a half hour as they were very behind on reservations. They directed us to their upstairs bar which was very crowded and took 20 minutes to get the bartender's attention for a menu. I was debating just leaving but I am so glad I waited!!For the meal, my boyfriend and I were tempted to go with the regular menu but ended up sticking with the restaurant week menu.Appetizers: tuna poke wontons and the barrio chicken taquitos. Both were very good, we ended up liking the tuna better because of the differing textures although both were deliciousEntrees: wasabi pea crusted salmon with soba noodles and the braised ribs. Between these two I would say both were great choices but the ribs won out for me, they were so flavorful and fell right off the bone. Although the salmon was very good too, nice crust and spice from the wasabi.Dessert: smores brownie and warm doughnuts. The warms doughnuts were SO good!

3.0,1/30/2016,Came here for my birthday with some friends and we ordered 6 tapas to share. The restaurant looked beautiful inside with the lighting and chandeliers. We started with drinks and and all of them tasted good. I can't remember the names but mine had figs in it and it was a nice balance of alcohol and sweetness. However the food was a bit disappointing. The only standout dishes were the scallop with risotto and steak with fries. But the fries were really salty. We had the beef Wellington but the puff pastry was soggy and it was mixed with a weird flavor that was not appealing. The other dishes were only mediocre.

But as a ""small plates"" restaurant, the dishes are...well, small. You'll definitely need several, which means the price of the meal creeps up quickly.Our biggest complaint was that the tables are REALLY close together. As in, chairs touching back-to-back, and about 8 inches between tables along the walls. I honestly don't know how the wait staff navigates the dining room. If you go, go in a party of 3.

Only thing is, after looking at the rest of the menu, we didn't even end up taking advantage of the price fix special. Not quite enough for 4 stars, though.This is not your typical restaurant, considering the dishes are designed to share and continue to come out throughout your experience here. We skipped out on the $15.00 cocktails and opted to share the following:1. French onion soup dumplings - The'yre known for this, but I honestly thought they would be better. The flavor was really good, but too dry and not really what I expected.2. Tuna Poke Wontons - More like tuna tacos. If you like tuna rolls and wasabi peas, you need to try this dish!3. Chicken and Waffles - Really good mix of flavors, but very small portion for what we thought would be a larger plate. 4. Burger (not the sliders) - Kind of underwhelming. The bun wasn't toasted, and the burger lacked flavor besides the bacon jam spread. For $19.00, you would expect more of a specialty gourmet burger. The fries that came with it, though, were amazing - super crunchy and perfectly seasoned.The chef also offered us a complimentary bite at the beginning of our meal that was delicious - the lentil puree was so, so good.While the portion and quality of certain dishes were less than I expected, the atmosphere of this space is warm, trendy and tasteful. The service was also what you would expect of upscale dining.

It's also difficult to find something exactly healthy on the brunch menu for a vegetarian. The potato and goat cheese pierogies are delicious, but also very heavy. The black truffle creme fraiche was a nice touch, though. Many have also raved about the French onion soup dumplings and they look like they're drenched in cheese. The burgers are mini-sized but command the price of that of a regular one.I haven't tried the sweet options on the menu yet, but they look amazing.

We had the Oreo pancakes, French onion dumpling, Mac and cheese and frites. They suggest 6 dishes for 2 but we struggled with the 4.The pancakes were great, man and cheese not so much. The French onion dumplings was not what I was expecting but the taste was good. Be warned there is no soup per say. The soup is inside the dumplings. In all, would I return?

3.0,1/21/2016,"I'm a huge fan of the small plates, because who doesn't wanna try multiple items on the menu in one sitting?! I had 10 o'clock reservations on a Friday night and our group of 3 had to wait a little bit even though we got there a bit early. We headed upstairs for a drink and slipped into a spot at the bar rather quickly. The atmosphere was upbeat and roaring. I ordered the Sage Advice (gin, mango, sage, lime), which I was a fan of. It was a stiff drink but had the right amount of sweetness. My cousins had the Blood-Orange Jalapeno Marg and Ruby Jack. Both were fans. Once we were seated, our waiter came to introduce himself and since it was our first time, he advised us that typically a group of our size shares about 6 plates. We thought that was a lot so we started out with 4, then ended up ordering 1 more for good measure: French Onion Soup Dumplings, which are a must, Chicken & Waffles, Cast Iron Shrimp, Timmy's Stuffed Bell Peppers + Social Mac and Cheese French Onion Soup Dumplings: I was expecting these to come out soupier, for lack of a better word, and hotter. My cheese pull was all off! You could tell it had been sitting there for a couple minutes before it got to our table. Nonetheless, it was delicious. My taste buds were pretty happy. Chicken N Waffles: Good, but nothing to rave about. When I imagine a dish like this, I see fried chicken and this was grilled so I wasn't enthralled. There was too much similarity in textures. Cast Iron Shrimp: Looking back this was probably my favorite of the night. Jumbo shrimp sitting on a crispy cake of paella. Great flavors here!Timmy's Stuffed Bell Peppers: I don't even remember so that says enough about thatSocial Mac & Cheese: I'm not sure what it is about mac & cheese, but I haven't had one that says ""wow, that is amazing"" and this one is no different. The addition of sausage and peppers added a good quick but still didn't exactly tickle my fancy. I think the ""social"" in the name gives clear a indication as to what this place is all about. It's more of a lounge where you can get a couple drinks and share a few plates with a group of friends or even for a date. The music gives a really good vibe (I was loving the 90s throwbacks), and overall I had a great time. Is this a ""foodie"" spot, I don't think so.

The cocktails were good and strong as you would expect. The atmosphere was great. But I felt the food let it down a bit... Granted, some things were incredible - the french onion soup dumplings are just as amazing as everyone says they are, so flavourful and tasty. We also loved the chicken arepas and the brussel sprouts side was the best I've ever tasted. However we actually found the meatballs inedible - the cheese tasted really not nice (I hate to say it but my husband and I both independently thought it tasted of vomit). The ribs were fine - not amazing, we didn't finish them. We had the donuts and twinkies for dessert - donuts were good (just plain balls with dipping sauce so hard to go wrong) but the twinkies were just a bit strange and bland. They were meant to be cookie dough but just tasted sugary and creamy. We had a nice enough evening but I would choose Beauty and Essex every time.

I thought most bar tenders are supposed to be charming, isn't that how you get tips? Anyways, the drinks were very nice. I had the watermelon strawberry margarita, strong enough to knock your socks off but not too strong to block the flavor of the fruits. The waitress was very patient as we were a big group of people and we were seated right away. If you are worried that you are a big group and you will have to order multiple dishes of each, never fear they are very accommodating. Since we were such a big group we requested their be at least two bites of every tapas for each person. The ambience was romantic yet busy but also perfect for socializing. Its very swanky and it kind of reminds you of a place that the cast of sex & the city would have a couple of drinks chatting away about some escapade they had. Now onto the food! The main event for us had to be between the potato pierogies and the infamous french onion soup dumplings. We basically ordered everything that was on the menu and literally everything they put before us was pure HEAVEN. It was the perfect balance of flavors and all in one perfect bite. I recommend getting the beef wellington as well, take it from someone that is not too keen on the red meats...this was outstanding.

The waitress (who was sweet, but we at times had to get her attention) suggested we get at least 5 apps b/c they were very small portions. We ordered 6.

Anyway at the end of our meal, we ordered cappuccinos & l was looking forward to the ""S'mores Molten Cake"" since l love s'mores! Well it was a let down, completely dry! I'm a HUGE dessert fan so l was disappointed to end on a ""sucky note"". With the word ""molten"" in it, you'd expect something to ooze out of it, NOTHING came out, l think some smoke came out as l cut into it with my fork b/c it was so dry..lol ok not really but it really was so bad l didn't even finish it. Whaaa?! ME not finish dessert?! Yup, unheard of but true. Oh and where was the marshmellow part of that s'mores dessert?? Anyway, the Cappuccino wasn't even great. It tasted burnt. How can you screw that up?? The people right next to our table seemed either know Chris Santos (co-owner & chef) or know of him, from overhearing their convo.

Anyway they saw me unenthusiastically eating the cake & said ""you're not into that dessert are you?"" I responded ""Sadly, no, it's disappointingly dry & there's nothing great about it"" ..then she said ""the desserts here are horrible, ya gotta go to 'beauty & essex', they have better desserts"". We shall see, l have high standards with desserts especially.So we proceeded to the lounge area. We ordered our drinks, we were meeting a couple more people there. My 2nd drink l took 2 sips; still a full glass. l got up to walk over to greet a friend, had to be less than 5 seconds..sit back down, drink was gone. I asked what happened to my drink the female bartender took it. Why?? I wasn't finished nor was it empty! What's funny is l've read other reviews about drinks being taken away prematurely. What's up with that, Stanton Social??! So l told her l wasn't finished with it, she made another but it was sloppy.

Some of our favorites were:- The Mac and cheese without the meat- Coconut curry Samosa- potato and goat cheese periogiosWe also had the Bloody Mary and Ruby Jack cocktails.The place has the ambience of a speakeasy bar and a fabulous place to go with a medium to a large group!,0,0,0,Ajay L.,"Pittsburgh, PA",8,3,0

We literally couldn't find the place because its a hole in the wall and therefore we got there a few minutes late so we didn't have a table (even though we had a reservation) so they told us to go upstairs to the bar and grab some drinks, which we did. The drinks were sooo good. Our wait was only about 15 mins and we were then told to come downstairs where we were seated. Luckily I had dressed up extra nice, the place is pretty trendy and everyone is dressed on point. Service was great and we got a bunch of appetizers and drinks. Fav drinks included the swashbuckler and the blood orange jalapeno margarita, they were really great! I loved that there were so many yummy things to share (and great veg options!!) and we got the edamame, curry coconut samosas, potato and goat cheese pierogies, veggie sliders, mac n cheese and a bunch of other things all which I highly recommend.

5.0,12/8/2015,"I really really like this place. I've never been to a Tapas restaurant and now I realize I love the idea of sharing plates because you get to try a variety of tastes. Atmosphere: Very hip, casual, and classy. You ask how all three... Well, I'm not entirely sure but I'll try to make sense of it. The decor is appealing paired with dim lighting making it intimate and you add the R&B classics you have all three! Drinks: They have a large cocktail menu which is on the pricey side averaging around $15 a cocktail. I got the Jalapeno Margarita which didn't impress me. Going around the table no one was entirely impressed with their drinks. Maybe wine and beer is the move because of the price.Service: Great. Don't need anymore detail than that. Food: OH MY GOD. Mini plates of mouth watering goodness. MWG...I'm going to coin that. Anyways, we probably got 50% of the menu as we were a big group.Highly Recommend - Mac & Cheese - French Onion Soup Dumplings: Melts in your mouth- Cocunut Curry Samosa: Perfect with the dipping sauce - Red Snapper Fish Tacos- Potato Pierogies: I don't remember why I liked these so much but they were great- Oysters: Any because I love oysters - Doughnuts: Can't mess donuts up for dessert Good but not great- Ravioli: It had a very sweet taste to it. Maybe best for the end of the meal. It was good but I was surprised by the sweet taste.- Chicken & Waffles: Chicken isn't friend...enuf said.- Smores Cake - Little too dark chocolately for my liking. I bet most people would like this though. Overall, I think this is perfect for groups or a date. If you like family style sharing this is a must try.

4.0,12/4/2015,"The Stanton Social embodies a risqué environment, which makes it perfect for dates! ;) My first visit was with my girlfriend on a early Friday evening. The tapas were so savory and full of flavor! I made a second visit the following week with my boyfriend on a Saturday evening to show him the goods.On both visits, service was on point and the servers were very attentive and informative. Also, mini complimentary cups of daily soups. 4-6 tapas are recommend for a party of 2. *not including dessert* :PThe tapas all come out together to be shared as family style.  The look of our faces were like kids in a candy store. Very excited to stuff our faces!! We kept our cool though. Food game:~ French onion soup dumplings {2.5/5} - This was the first item our server recommended (during both visits) their most popular well known tapa. Also seems to be a favorite of all the fellow foodies here, however this dish did not really ""wow"" my gf & I. The dumplings were way too overpowering in flavor and too cheesy for my liking. ~ Coconut curry samosa {4/5} - A very fantastic savory blend of both curry and coconut stuffed in a puffy pastry. The curry was very rich in flavor with hints of lingering coconut, heavenly. Love the yogurt sauce! ~ Red snapper fish tacos {5/5} - I fell in love at this point! Very fresh and delicious, I love the blend of creamy avocados and spicy mango slaw! The red snapper was very well seasoned. All slammed into a mini crispy taco shell. ~ Potato & goat cheese pierogies {3.5} - I liked it, but didn't love it. Fluffy truffle truffle crème fraiche on the side. ~ Mexican street corn ravioli {5/5} - I really loved this dish! This is such an awesome fusion of Mexican street food meets pasta. Excellent pairing. ~ Pastrami Reuben Quesadilla {4/5} - House brined pastrami, rich in flavor. ~ Korean short rib tacos {0/5} - This was a MAJOR disappointment for 3 mini tacos and a very heavy price tag attached. The short ribs were not marinated Korean style at all.. They were SOOOOOO SALTY. My boyfriend and I were not impressed with this dish. PLEASE STAY AWAY.

Me, I think about CBGBs and Kim's Video (RIP), and all the crazy times I've had running around Tompkins Square Park. But hey, I'm an old fart. Things have changed. Punk is dead. So are video stores.The East Village is still alive though and has lots of great places to visit. One in particular has been around since 2005, and my girlfriend and our Alphabet City friend had a chance to check it out recently.The Stanton Social is a sexy restaurant and lounge run by one of New York's hottest teams of restaurant creators, Celebrity Chef/Owner Chris Santos (also owner of Beauty & Essex), TAO and LAVO owner Richard Wolf, and Peter Kane of Happy Ending.Chef Santos' trend setting multi-ethnic share plate menu is designed to offer guests a chance to experience multiple dishes and flavors throughout their meal. And that's exactly what we did.We started out however with a few designer cocktails. The Watermelon-Strawberry Margarita was sweet and flavorful and the Social Tea (Ketel One Citroen, Gunpowder green tea, & orange-honey marmalade) was nice as well, but the real winner was the Basil-Lime Gimlet. So good that I had two of them! We followed the drinks by ordering just about everything on the menu. The Nori Spiced Tuna Poke Wonton was exceptional, with cilantro, avocado, and crushed wasabi peas to give it some bite. The Red Snapper Tacos were snappin', with creamy avocado and spicy mango.I also liked the mini Lamb Gyros and Maryland Style Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes, but our hands-down favorite were the Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies. Although I ain't Polish, I know my way around a Pierogi, and these were the best damn ones I've ever tasted. Worth the trip downtown just for this alone, we truly enjoyed everything we tried, including the Chicken n'Waffles.More drinks were in order so I tried the Strawberry Fields (Grey Goose Citron, muddled fresh strawberries, lemon syrup, fresh lemon, & a Riesling floater), and my girlfriend took the Blood Orange-Jalapeño Margarita, a Jalapeño-infused Maestro Dobel with blood orange juice, fresh lime and Cointreau. As usual, she picked the winner, as her drink rocked!To finish our feast we ended with some sweets. Their Key Lime 'Twinkie' was interesting and different, but I wasn't a big fan. However, their Movie Theater Sundae was, well, words can't describe it, other than to say yum, Yum, YUM!! It is a brownie, along with peanut butter pretzels, popcorn ice cream, and brown butter caramel. Need I say more?Last but not least we had their signature Warm Doughnuts, which came with three delicious dipping sauces. Better than any Dunkin' D I've ever had.Next time you wanna go out in the East Village you should Definitely check out The Stanton. It's well worth it.

These would be the only two items I would reorder.Cons--The pierogies were okay. The goat cheese flavor wasn't apparent which was needed to lighten up and balance the potato. They were also oddly garlicky. The French onion soup dumplings squirted out the soup which wasn't expected or visually appealing. The dumplings' flavors needed to be simpler as well.

The person who answered our call said that they wont hold the table for more than 15mins but will seat us when we arrive as soon as possible. A normal person would assume this would be in less than an hour of arrival. However, when we arrived, the hostess told us that they wont seat us until 10:45. Our reservation was for 6.45 and we reached there at 7.05-7.10. Does that remotely make sense? When you have a reservation and call in to inform them of the delay, isn't is good service to hold the table for the party? Even if you don't hold the table, could you not inform of a 3 hour waiting time so that we don't bother coming if we are late?

The edamame, brussel sprouts, and onion soup dumplings were awesome. The fish tacos were disappointing. Unfortunately our 'dining experience' was brought down by some of the worst service I've ever had. Our waiter could not have been ruder, and the service staff were just as bad. The waiter had a huge attitude, which from the moment we sat down suggested his job was to get us in and out as fast as possible. He was annoyed when we did not want to order all our dishes at once, but first order drinks and appetizers. He never even came back to ask for another round of drinks.

I've been here on 3 separate occasions and each time it has been exceptional! Food: Stanton Social is a tapas bar with a menu that reflects a tour of multiple mouthwatering flavors.  It was a must for me to order new items after my first visit.  Tuna Poke Wantons, Red Snapper Tacos, Chicken Taquitos, Old School Meatballs, Kobe Beef Burger, Mac & Cheese and last but never least, Chicken & Waffles.  These are some items I can hands-down testify to their culinary perfection.  Every dish was beautifully plated and with the taste to match.  I really can say that I thoroughly enjoyed every dish.  Of course everyone has different preferences but for this place if I had to absolutely pick must-haves, they would be: the chicken & waffles (magic without the syrup), the tuna poke wantons & the old school meatballs.Drinks:  The menu has an array of specialty cocktails.  All are mixed with top shelf alcohol and certainly justify the price.  My go-to is the Strawberry Fields.  It has just enough sweetness to mask the alcohol taste and yet strong enough to supply you with a nice buzz.  I've also had the Dead Presidente and the Grapefruit Hemingway; both great.Dessert:  To be honest, I know I've seen a few desserts on the menu but my ONLY interest have been the Warm Doughnuts! They are paired with three dipping sauces, chocolate, a berry & caramel. Total life changer after indulging in their dulcet taste.   A girlfriend of mine and I often reminisce - all that needs to be said is ""Dem Doughnuts"" they're orgasmic.

Trendy spot, very crowded but attractive, and a rather unfortunate smell, but that seems to be truffle oil or something from one of their popular dishes. There was a second floor which seemed to be a bit more spacious.  We were stuck in city traffic and were 15 minutes late to our reservation but did have one person already there at the restaurant to let the staff know. When the rest of our party entered, we were greeted by the hostess telling us that we had to leave by 9:00. Speaking to the manager didn't help either. We were never told that we could have a cutoff time when making our reservation and that really put us off. It's poor form and poor customer service in any case. Regardless, we got to our table and enjoyed a variety of really delicious small plates. I recommend the pierogies as well as the meatballs with manicotti. Everyone else at my table loved the sliders (I didn't try them). After we finished our food, our server came over TO REMIND US that we had to clear our table by 9:00. That really sucked and took away from our enjoyment. We also couldn't help but notice quite a few empty tables which wasn't helping the case. An expensive evening especially considering they are small plates, so I wouldn't really recommend it for a large party. I would return based on how much I enjoyed the food, but only with a group of 2-3 people total so we could get one of their booths which appear to be at less risk of getting hit by others. ...and I definitely won't be even a minute late if I return.",0,0,0,Megan H.,"Long Island, NY",66,87,87

3.0,11/6/2015,"This place blast their music. You literally have to scream to get a conversation going. I came here for my sisters birthday. We were a party of 7 and had reservation. Once we got to the restaurant we were seated right away (which was a huge plus).  We had this round table right in front of the entrance. The table was extremely small for 7 people. We were pretty much stuffed onto a table. There wasn't much chair room. I had to move my chair about 10 times for people to past by behind me. Onto the food. I wouldn't say it was bad but it wasn't great either. It was not worth the amount of money I paid. Our table ordered French onion dumplings, tuna wanton, quesadilla, Mac and cheese, Caprice pizza, lamb gyro, chicken and waffle. I believe that was it. The french onion dumpling came out extremely cold. Couldnt event take it off the plate because the cheese got all dried up.... The bill came out to 400$. We all left a bit hungry. I wouldn't recommend this for a big group. Maybe a date night with a friend or two. Not worth the hype.",1,1,1,Cindy C.,"Flushing, NY",76,59,154

3.0,11/1/2015,"The Stanton Social for brunch is *much* different from Stanton Social in the dinner or late evenings.  Whereas, dinner/late evenings is more of a deafening ""scene"", the brunch is just your average and surprisingly quiet brunch.  This is not a party brunch with girls in dresses and leering guys hitting this place up before they go out, but just locals catching up for brunch.  Like you could take your parents here for brunch.  That otherwise rowdy second floor is empty on the weekends.  That said, the dinner is better than the brunch.  The ambience, food and crowd is just much better in the evenings.I still regret not having gotten the oreo pancakes.  I had the chance and I missed it even if I only was going to take one damn bite, I still should have ordered it.  Instead, true to my boring brunch tastes, I had the Eggs Benedict and the Latka pancakes with sour cream.  My friend ordered the breakfast burritos.  Now given what we had ordered, I thought they would be entrees.  But like dinner, even these usually entree-like brunch entrees came tapas style (like on long horizontal plates and several in mini-style).  Everything was good, but uneventful.  I think I ate almost everything myself as my friend does not eat much when we go out I noticed.  Service was a bit rushed and I couldn't understand why.  The ""are you finished with that?""  ""Here is your check.""  ""Can I take this check now?""  ""Is there anything else you ladies need?""  It hadn't even been crowded when we left.  They were polite, just it seemed trained to get people out asap.  They managed to get us out after 1.5 hours.  I should have endlessly ordered cups of tea and coffee after the meal just to drive them insane.  Don't rush me at brunch.",1,0,0,Christine N.,"Manhattan, NY",138,374,294

Yes, they are the most juiciest and tastiest I've ever had! The drinks are amazing! The other must-haves are the coconut curry samosas and potato and goat cheese pierogies. I had to try their chicken and waffles, and it was melt in your mouth good. Of course, to wash them all down, my friends and I ordered the Basil-lime gimlet, made to perfection. The only thing that was kind of disappointing was the fact that after a certain time, you and your friends are yelling at each other, because the overhead music starts to get louder and louder. So, its a good thing we're full and happy with our drinks at that point, that it was time for us to save our larynx, pay the bill and go somewhere else for a good cup of coffee, dessert and actual conversation.

5.0,10/27/2015,"FBdfdsDJHBsdfdgHSBGHSFSBFhbdhfbdshfbdsfvghfhsbfsv!!! OMG IT'S THAT GOOD.I remember coming to Stanton Social when I was literally 17 years old. I know I don't look 100 years old, but I'm a lot older than 17. This place is like an ancient gold-mine for Manhattan standards. I have some really fond memories here as this place was such a huge ""scene"" to go to over the years. I've been here for literally any type of event that you could think of.Ambiance: Trendy. Great music (all were Kygo remixes). I like to go to these trendy type places a few times in a short span of time as I know how these type of restaurants can be hit or miss sometimes. I went to Stanton Social as I was getting my hair done near the restaurant and it popped up on Yelp as being close by. We opted for the tasting menu which they offer on some days (can't remember which days but I assume weekdays?)Tasting menu:+++ Crispy Barrio-Style Chicken Taquitos with roasted guajillo sauce, avocado, creme - I was confused by the description as to exactly what this dish is but it's basically these balls filled with chicken, sauce that's a bit spicy, and avocado (drizzled with some creme). These are gherbfhjsbfbfhjbhbsdd good! So so so so so tasty. One of the best things on the menu, for sure.+++ Chicken and waffles - I don't think I've ever had grilled chicken with waffles. I've only had the fried stuff which makes me feel like I'm going to have a heart attack shortly after. I believe that Stanton Social used to offer this dish fried but times are changing my friends! They offer chicken and waffles with brick GRILLED chicken. They don't overdo it on the sauce (maple syrup with a hint of balsamic) and this dish is absolute perfection. If you plan on having this dish,BEPREPARED.You will literally come back two more times within the same week to eat this heavenly dish again (true story, happened to me). I literally ate at Stanton Social three times in one week because I was so obsessed with this dish (and I'm going there this week again). I just can't get enough of it!!!! Someone please help me! Is there a chicken and waffles Stanton Social rehab?+++ Warm donuts with various dipping sauces - Self explanatory. If you need me to explain how good this dish is, please stop reading Yelp reviews.+++ Lobster roll - Amazing. Usually lobster rolls are drenched with tartar sauce and/or mayo. Yuck. Who wants anything drenched in sauce? Not me. This is a perfect blend of lobster and sauce. It's seriously delish! + Red snapper tacos - I've tried these before and thought they were meh. I've had some pretty awesome tacos in the same style before and I just didn't feel like this was a really strong dish on the menu. It's not that these aren't good, it's just that they aren't the best thing on the menu.Service:Hit or miss. I came here the first two times and the service was great. On the third time it was absolutely terrible. My only suggestion would be for them to just get their service together a bit more.All & all, a solid place. Definitely also a place that I would recommend to people visiting from out of town.

Fast forward ONE long hour...we were seated at 10:30 even though we made a reservation!! That's not a restaurant that values our business and is totally unacceptable. I would've rather they told us that they couldn't seat us at 9:30. We expressed our dissatisfaction to the hostess who got the manager.

3.0,8/28/2015,"Made reservations here on a Saturday night for 9:45pm. They sat us right away in a cute little circular booth on the first floor. The ambience was great and trendy. Loved the decor, music, and atmosphere in general. As for the food, it was nothing special. Ordered the infamous french onion soup dumplings. It seemed to be a ball of grilled onions topped with melted cheese. However by the time I ate them at the table the cheese had hardened and was no longer the melty goodness I suspect it should have been. Also ordered the korean short rib tacos (3 to an order) and they were just so-so. Lastly tried the scallops on a bed of risotto which was good but not great. The drink I ordered was mango puree with gin. It was pretty strong which was good but the mango was so thick I could barely drink it. Overall the small plates are okay.

It's half off wines and they're 14$ each so it's totally worth it to go up and get a drink before dinner. Dinner was ammmmazzzzingggg! I'm still thinking about how delicious everything was. We had Korean tacos, the Pizzette with mozzarella and arugula, the big sexy burger, and rigatoni bolognese with ricotta and mint. Our server suggested getting 5-6 items but with these four we were so full we didn't have any room for dessert (although it looked delicious!) The ambiance is very dim and chic.

2.0,8/23/2015,"After hearing such great things about this place aka seeing numerous Instagrams of the french onion soup dumpings on my feed, I decided to make reservations for 2 on a Thursday night. As expected for NYC Restaurant Week, it was packed and we were asked to ""hang out for a little bit by the bar until our table was ready"". Well that hour long ""hang out"" turned out to be very hangry groups of people around us comparing reservation times. I don't think it was the wait that people minded or at least I can speak for myself. It's the fact that two very persistent girls next to us got seated before the couple that had been waiting for over an hour. I just felt like our reservation was pointless since the hostess was doing her own thing. It seems to be a common occurrence according to nymag.com. I was happy to be seated on the third level since it's less crowded up there. At this point we were so hungry we ordered a bunch of plates to share but the hand pulled chicken arepas (a little spicy) and the warm donuts with the 3 dipping sauces (the caramel one was my fav) were the only ones worth raving about. I mean the vibe is great so I would recommend checking it out with a friend or two one of these days but no rush...literally.",2,0,0,Katherine C.,"Weehawken, NJ",148,206,87

4.0,8/20/2015,"The vibe is great, and the staff were very helpful. We began with the amazing cocktails, I recommend the notorious f.i.g and the blood orange spicy margarita. Then our server told us to get five plates and while that doesn't sound like a lot trust me it absolutely is holy cow I'm writing this review the morning after and I am still stuffffffed. We started with the lamb gyros which were excellent, they have an awesome beet-feta purée that now j wish every kebab place had. The periogies with goat cheese and crime fraiche were also fantastic and I noticed had the largest portion. Well the French onion soup dumplings was a large portion too, and delicious, and super hot so be careful. For dessert we got the birthday cake shots, birthday cake batter with makers mark, um BOMB. Wow so amazing. And they aren't shy about alcohol either. It's very reminiscent of the shots you get at beauty and essex. Then we got the movie theater sundae. Oh. My. God. It was fantastic! It would be my favorite Sunday of all time if they lost the brownie. Or at least had made a better batch, because ours was so terribly dry and we were content with the caramel sauce, the amazingly delicate and delicious popcorn flavored ice cream, and the chocolate covered pretzels. Chocolate covered pretzels have a way of getting soggy in ice cream but there's were still very crunchy!

4.0,8/17/2015,"Came here on a Monday evening for a date night with the boyfriend because we saw it was listed for NYC Restaurant week and because for years I've wanted to visit this place. Once we got to Stanton Social we opted out of Restaurant Week and chose to eat from the regular menu because in the end you weren't saving much (Which is what Restaurant Week is supposed to be for, upscale restaurants that regular Joe's/Jane's can't afford).   Anyways, Stanton Social is an upscale restaurant where Chef/Part-Owner Chris Santos created tapas style diverse unique small plates, case in point one, one of the appetizers we got was the French Onion Soup Dumplings and O-M-G it was AMAZING. I'm already obsessed with French Onion soup and having the taste of a soup in a dumpling it just took it to whole new level. Another favorite of mine was the Mexican Street Corn Ravioli, tasted just like the Mexican corn and I wanted more. So sad that for three pieces of raviolis it cost $18. We both got the Strawberry Fields, tasted same as the ones I made when I bartended at the bars of JetBlue at JFK Airport. Overall I loved this place, the food was amazing but it's best to just come for a big occasion not just a regular night.",5,1,4,Lisa R.,"Queens, NY",455,214,335

Dont kid yourself it is pricey for a regular joe but for a anniversary or big celebration very good option.  My favorite drink is their Strawberry Fields.  One of their signature dishes is the French Onion Soup, i was a little disapointed with their lobster roll this time around i think they replaced sum lobster with pickles which i wasnt a fan of but still very good.  They always tweek their menu so you can have something new everytime, this time i had the Ravioli which was amazing.  I tried going for resturant week deal but it really isnt worth it for what your gonna pay they just force things on menu you may not have so keep that in mind",5,0,1,Manny R.,"Queens, NY",331,77,282
4.0,8/14/2015,"I worked with the Stanton Social for two big group dinners this year, and both of them went swimmingly. They sent over a limited menu for me to choose four courses, but the options were all great and included some of their popular items such as French onion soup dumplings and their delicious sliders. The staff for the most part was very easy to get a hold of and responsive. And I like that they're able to add fun touches, like a personalized menu printed to welcome your group. These little things really make these kinds of dinners feel special. Once there, the service was hit or miss. The first time, we were seated in the mezzanine and seated right away. The service was spectacular. The second time, as with the first, they said they couldn't guarantee our group the mezzanine but that they'd try their best. We didn't get that preferred area this time, and we were told to wait upstairs in their weirdly bright bar upstairs (at least it was at about 7pm). Food, always a hit. It's a bunch of really fun, creative dishes that get people excited. Honestly there really wasn't a miss in either of the meals. Favorites included the aforementioned dumplings and kobe beef sliders, and people loved the warm doughnuts and inside out chocolate chip cookies for dessert. What really really impressed me was that they created unique options both times for the vegans in our group. Not many places will do that, but they were happy to accommodate. The cocktails are also really fun, though pretty pricey. As for the ambiance, there's a reason why this has been a NYC go-to for so many years. It's a fun, energetic scene and though it's lively it's still possible to hear each other in conversation. The decor is dark and sexy, but the servers are still chipper and unpretentious. It's not an easy feat to make a large group dinner go smoothly not once but twice, so for that bravo!",7,7,9,Christina P.,"Culver City, CA",4723,2090,4060

Food was great, meat slid right off ribs and mixed well with cole slaw but service was not great. Kind of pretentious.

Due to the size of our party, we had to pick from their pre-fixe menu, which had most of their signature dishes and generous portions - $64 per person and we were completely stuffed!!!The Kobe Beef sliders, Lamb Gyros, Chicken and Waffles, Fried Dough, Potato and Goat Cheese stuffed Pierogies, and Reverse Chip Cookies were absolutely divine! BTW, I even took the left over reverse chip cookies home - I could eat them ALL DAY :) The French Onion soup dumplings were good, but maybe my expectations were set too high from reading the reviews or the fact that I am just not a big fan of French Onion Soup or maybe both, it was just OK to me. Though, I loved the cheese crust and pretty much ate all the leftover cheese! The scallops were my least favorite, in fact, most of us did NOT like them at all! I'm not a picky eater by any means, but they were SO FISHY - yuck! Aside from that, all the other dishes were awesome (even the fries and kale chip - YUM!).The staff was nice, but I did feel like we were treated a bit like a production line (could be because we're a large group and they already know our orders). it was just collect empty plates, gather the leftovers onto one plate to make room, and bring the next round of food. I don't think anyone came around to ask how our food was, if we needed anything (besides drinks), or our experience... Would given them 5 stars if they did.

It was good but really the flavors were nothing new or particularly interesting to me. My favorite dish was the arepas and then probably the pierogies but neither blew my socks off.

In order for a person to move we would have to separate tables and make it uncomfortable. We asked the manger as we sat down to see if we can take the 8 top table next to us in order to free up more room. Plausible in my mind but not in his. He then proceeded to explain to me that he could not based on the layout. Don't believe this excuse.

They say you should choose around seven dishes because there small but we had 8!  We ordered the quesadillas, arepas, onion soup dumplings, ravioli, Bolognese, red snapper tacos, chicken and waffles, (potatoes things i don't remember). To give you a run down of what to get, get the onion soup dumplings, the potato and goat cheese dish we had And the chicken and waffles are an absolute must!!! They were so good there was a battle at the table. The red snapper tacos were cute yet tasted a little too fishy for our taste buds. The quesadillas, arepas and Bolognese were great as well. In terms of service I couldn't have asked for anything better. Serving five girls can be difficult especially when it's my group of friends. They were always checking in on us and because it was my friends birthday thy gave us on the house birthday shots that consisted of whisky and cream. It tasted like heaven in my mouth. We didn't even taste the whisky and thought we were drinking a milkshake. All in all this place is a must and half!!!!

Stanton Social is a truly awesome place- great atmosphere - trendy and really yummy food. Yes it's expensive but I would think most people know that going in- it's just one of those places. It's all tapas / share plates style. For two people you need at least 4-5 things and would still have room for dessert. We got fried artichokes, red snapper tacos and meatballs with ricotta all of which were superb - absolutely delicious. We got a little pushed into ordering the French onion soup dumplings - even though I stated I didn't really like French onion soup- but the server kind of wouldn't let it go so we ordered them. No surprise if you don't love French onion soup these won't be your favorite. We finished with skirt steak and chimichuri which was very good but not as amazing as the first three dishes. I have to say the French fries were weird. May sound strange to complain about French fries but they just were not good. They tasted almost like yuca or some other vegetable and were cooked to a weird gummy consistency. That was really the only thing that wasn't delicious. For dessert we finished with lime sorbet- so yummy and tart and donuts. An almost perfect meal- with 2 glasses of wine and a mock tail it ran us 150.

Server made sure to ask if we have any dietary restrictions right off the bat (I'm vegetarian so this was a plus for me). Lots of vegetarian items, including crispy fries and veggie burger sliders made with avocado. Food is served in very small portions, designed so as more keeps being brought out throughout the meal. Three of my friends got the chicken and waffles (good portion size-took leftovers home). They also brought out  complimentary potato ravioli drizzled with caramelized onion and creamy dip. Desserts are EXQUISITE. We had a sundae with caramel and popcorn, doughnuts with three dipping sauces (caramel, chocolate, dark chocolate), and these key lime pie filled Twinkies. We also were lucky enough to get a kitchen tour-the entire team works so hard cohesively.This restaurant is owned by Chef Chris Santos from Food Network's ""Chopped,"" and let me tell you it lives up to its hype.

But you know where the LES is heading now that the Village has moved to Brooklyn. I kid. Yeah, the downstairs is nice as well. But you feel like you're in Midtown upstairs here without that Midtown mania. And odd thought. It was a bright afternoon, so I'm standing there as two women become three, so I'm invisible. And I'm appreciating the lighting. Above the skylight someone placed a bunch of reeds in a way that makes you look up and think of a field. It's that kind of detail that is in the decor and cuisine.The food is just awesome. Just ""awesome"". Yeah we had the dumplings covered in cheese. I had the octopus appetizer, delicious. As well as the little lamb gyro. The other five orders looked amazing as well, but I unfortunately didn't bring my appetite. I'll know better next time.

5.0,6/4/2015,"Definitely one of my new spots in New York. Small plates, all done with style!Came here with a party of about 8 for brunch, which made things slightly complicated in terms of ordering. They recommend about 1-2 plates per person at the table, and so we ended up ordering a good number of dishes with the concern that we may not have enough food or may have too much food. However, the waitresses were all very helpful in recommending the best food options for our table.What's awesome is that I got to try so many of the dishes here because of the small plates dining style.-Goat Cheese Pierogies: My favorite of the brunch. So creamy and indulgent with the stuffed cheese, and the dough tasted fresh.-Vegetarian Sliders: I always hate that I never get to have sliders usually (I don't eat beef) so when I saw this on the menu I was beyond excited. It lived up to the hype! Avocado, veggies...-Granola: Tasty, but nothing to rave about. A good healthy option to add into the mix.-Oreo Cookie Pancakes: a MUST order. Deliciously fluffy. -French Onion Soup Dumplings: looked AMAZING when it came to our table, and I dove right in. Taste did not meet expectations, but was still tasty nonetheless!I came to celebrate my birthday with my sister, and at the end of the meal they brought out two mini cupcakes with candles for us to celebrate with. Cute gesture!The place is trendy, and the small plates style ends up creating a slightly more expensive brunch experience that I think you would have anticipated.

4.0,6/3/2015,"The food was good but I do think it's overhyped. Because it is tapas after all, the portions are very small but is quite delicious. I highly recommend the red snapper tacos and the French onion soup dumplings(unless you don't like salty foods). My favorite part of my experience here was drinking the strawberry fields cocktail (YOU MUST TRY!!) and their old fashioned donuts were to DIE for. I personally think it is very overpriced for the portion/ food quality although the atmospheres pretty classy and easy going. 4 stars for the drinks, dessert, service and atmosphere (not for the food). *** ALSO, that Asian server by the lounge upstairs is absolutely rude. My bf and I came upstairs to sit by the bar (without reservation) and she was NOT willing to help us. Stood around for a while waiting to get seated or some kind of help even after having eye contact with the lounge server. She wasn't doing much and still chose to ignore us. I asked her if there were any seats for us and she answered back by cutting me short in a bitchy manner. Being a waitress myself, I was super turned off and annoyed that we left. There are nicer ways to go about ""sorry there are no available seats by the bar"". Clearly, she shouldn't be dealing with any sort of customer service. Not going to take off a star because the waitress who served us was very attentive and friendly on our 2nd time coming back (with reservation).

It's not unreasonably expensive and I'd seriously recommend the pizza, as it actually came out on a large dish and could satiate everyone at the table. Skip the fish tacos, the shell is very, very heavy and greasy. The Social Tea is an incredible cocktail, and for fifteen dollars you won't find a much larger drink in the city.

It's only the second restaurant EVER that I've visited IN MY LIFE that is owned by a Food Network celebrity chef (I went to the awesome Jose Garces restaurant Garces Trading Company a few times).  Unfortunately, Chris Santos was not the chef of the night when the ladies and I ate dinner there, but that didn't deter me from totally loving the experience and food!!! It was nice enough that our server went to the kitchen to ask where Chris Santos was! But anyway, I don't know why I don't remember all of the tapas dishes we had (there were at least 5 dinner plates!), but I do remember the most delicious ones - French onion soup dumplings, fried 'chicken n'waffles', and Social Mac&Cheese. The ladies will agree that these three dishes were so enjoyable to eat, without a doubt! However, it was the DESSERT plates that transported me to paradise. We all shared the warm doughnuts and the movie theatre sundaes. Ahhhh, where have these doughnuts been all my life?!?! And the movie theater sundae was scrumptious and dangerous!

They literally just put gochujang (Korean red pepper paste) on top and, consequently, called it Korean. The kimchi that was used didn't even taste like Korean kimchi so I don't know what they were doing with that -- I do not recommend.The ambience/decor of the restaurant makes it seem pretty fancy, but it's not as stuffy and bourgeois as it comes off as.

You can stay right there at Stanton Social, listen to great music and sample a wide variety of perfectly prepared food items that will satisfy your need for almost anything, from a gourmet styled street taco to a delicious Kobe beef burger.Price?  That's a choice we make when we decide what it is we are looking for when we go out. In my opinion it's not too pricey and the total experience is worth a lot more than they charge, that's for sure.  It's more than worth every penny.  Highly recommended.  Thanks Stanton Social!",0,0,0,Ken M.,"Union City, NJ",0,8,5

3.0,5/8/2015,Overrated. Food was pretty good but they add fees depending on how many people are there and don't tell you. So you can order a $16 plate of food to share and then they add $8 and don't tell you unless you ask. And they gave us attitude when we didn't want to order everything at once. They told us for 4 people we would want to order 8-10 dishes. We ended up ordering 5 and that was plenty and we all left full.,0,0,0,Ashley W.,"Syracuse, NY",3,7,2
3.0,5/8/2015,"Hmmm the food is good but be aware of the prices!! The food is served tapas style so you will probably want at least 5 dishes to share amongst 2 people.

3.0,4/28/2015,"Mmm Stanton Social, how I loved you in 2010. Your tapas twist on classic American faves (hello french onion soup dumplings) spoke directly to my belly in more ways than one. And coming back in 2015, I couldn't wait to see how you've evolved in mind-blowing ways. But for whatever reason, you just didn't speak to me in the same ways. The chicken and waffles, my once favorite dish, was still fun and tasty, but just didn't hit the mark. The salad was over dressed. And the soup dumplings, okay fine, who am I kidding? The soup dumplings were incredible. But now for some real talk: super disappointing cocktails. I could see that the menu was all fruit-based, but I assumed that going off menu and ordering a manhattan wouldn't yield the cheek-achingly sweet cocktails that I tasted around the table. Unfortunately it wasn't the case. Next time I'll stick with wine.And that's the thing: there will definitely be a next time. Even with the above, I still love, love, love this restaurant and will heartily recommend it.

5.0,4/23/2015,"Totally. Blown. Away. Stanton Social has long been on my ""must try"" list pretty much since it opened and I finally had the opportunity to try it out the other night with my colleagues.As is common for large groups like ours, there was a special menu in place for our dinner. The waitress immediately came over to me and noted that the chef was making me vegan courses that would be arriving at the same time as everyone else's. I have heard from friends that the chef here is not only extremely accommodating to vegans, but actually thrives on the challenge. This is important because there is a difference between merely accommodating a dietary restriction (often begrudgingly) and celebrating one (ie, strive on making specialty dishes that are just as awesome as other dishes on the menu). So...  five stars for you, Stanton Social! Dish after dish of *creative* vegan small plates exceeded even my loftiest expectations! Not a single boring butternut squash soup (rather, a curried coconut amuse bouche), nor pedestrian grilled pepper and mushroom to be had, friends! Instead, there was a scrumptious small beet burger, three tiny incredible street tacos stuffed with decadent rice/protein (tofu, I think?) & veggies, an OMG-this-is-crazy-amazing vegan quesadilla (if I had to venture a guess, Chao cheese is involved) and a wasabi-encrusted tofu steak. The tofu steak was my least favorite, mainly because I thought the tofu should have been of the firm/pressed variety (improves the texture and taste) and I'm not the biggest fan of wasabi. But I appreciated it regardless! They even served me dessert, which was also unexpected (and appreciated). I was glad to be privy to a trio of very light sorbets (a sour grapefruit, sweet blueberry and my favorite, a refreshing peach mixed with vanilla - don't quote me on that, but it has another flavor besides peach).Decor is right up my alley, with its restrained 1920s posh dark appeal (next time I hope to sit in one of those gorgeous semi-circular booths). Secrets should be shared here, however it is extremely loud (ah, NYC acoustics).",7,4,7,Joi B.,"Hudson Valley, NY",3982,1796,1305

Once your table is ready your buzzer will ring and the feast begins. I recommend the French onion soup dumplings, the kale salad, the pulled pork tacos, and the Ruben.

4.0,4/15/2015,"Came here for a birthday brunch and was very impressed! The restaurant style is small plates, so they recommend ordering 1-2 small plates per person and sharing at the table. The thing I liked most was that if you have a party bigger than lets say 4-5, which is what some of the portion sizes are for things like pancakes, they can easily accommodate and give you __ more pieces. No hassle / issues of deciding between ordering one FULL more order or not.Things I LOVED: +Goat cheese pierogies- i've never had pierogies but these were a great first time. So delicious, cheesy and rich. +Egg bruschetta - wow how is this not a thing? The bruschetta bread was crispy on the outside but warm and soft on the inside, and topped with an abundance of eggs, onions and herbs. Delicious! +Vegetarian Slider - I think it was a beet burger topped with avocado, tomatoes and the works. So unique and tasty, wish I didn't share my other half...Overall, definitely a great brunch spot. A little pricey, but that's what you get I think for hitting up a hot spot.

5.0,4/14/2015,Hands down one of my all time favorites in NYC. Stanton Social is a must for every New Yorker! The waiters are pretty well in tuned to how much food your group will need. For small plates I highly recommend the pierogies and French onion soup dumplings. If you pick two dishes those are the two to eat. The fried chicken and waffles are also one of my favorites - that hot sauce butter is like the perfect combination of butter and franks. So delicious. We've also tried the tacos - both the red snapper and short rib are worth trying. Atmosphere is fun but no matter your reservation time you'll probably always wait a bit. Not a problem though - there's a fun bar upstairs. Try the Social Tea - yummy. And you must finish off with the warm doughnuts or you just must hate desserts.

5.0,4/12/2015,"Went with a friend for dinner at around 7:00 on a Friday. It was definitely busy and appeared to be a popular weekend spot for us ""youths"". The space is very modern and hip; definitely a bit tight but I always feel that's a good sign (and hey, it's New York, tight is how we do).Our server was very friendly and attentive (and tall!) despite it being so busy. My friend ordered a couple of margaritas and I ordered off the cocktail menu - the Sage Advice ($14). It was a gin cocktail with mango - very unusual but very tasty! I think I had three...The food was very good as well. I am a vegetarian and there was a good assortment of things I could order; some places you go to have at most two or three uninteresting things on the menu, but there was a really nice variety here that I appreciated. Our server recommended 5 dishes for the two of us to share, so we ordered: the edamame, the pierogies, the street corn ravioli and some haricot verts. Only four dishes and that was plenty for us! The edamame were really nice and charred, something you can't get just anywhere. The pierogies were wonderful, not too heavy, and the ravioli was very tasty but maybe a little too sweet (also only three for $17, seemed a bit of a stretch). We did not order dessert, but there were some good looking treats.For an LES hotspot I was not at all disappointed. As an NYC restaurant it was about what I expected for pricing of menu items and drinks, and the noise level, although loud, was fine.

3.0,4/9/2015,"After hearing so much about The Stanton Social the last few years and seeing Chris Santos on Chopped more times that I probably need, I finally decided to give it a try and came here for Restaurant Week Winter 2015. Once I walked in for dinner, my immediate first impressions were that it was very dark and loud! Throughout dinner I had to yell to my tablemate who was only across a small table. In addition, it was quite cramped between tables. They definitely could've done without a few of the tables, but unfortunately the restaurant suffers from ""squeeze as many customers in"" syndrome. The service was excellent though.As for what we ordered:Red Snapper Tacos - creamy avocado, spicy mango- Fresh, crunchy and filled to the brim with stuffingCrispy Barrio-Style Chicken Taquitos - roasted guajillo sauce, avocado, crema - It was served in little bite sizes. I probably could've devoured 100 of these!Fried 'Chicken n' Waffles' - maple cheddar waffle, Louisiana hot sauce butter- Definitely not your standard chicken and waffles. It sort of looked like 3 chicken fingers served on a few small waffles. I wasn't a huge fan of it, but it wasn't half bad either.'Big Sexy' Burger - dry aged prime rib eye patties, caramelized onions, fancy sauce, herb dusted frites- The burger was juicy and huge! I loved the ""fancy"" sauce on it as it added some additional flavor.Warm Doughnuts - caramel, chocolate & berry dipping sauces- Of the 2 desserts, I absolutely preferred this one. It was very simple and who doesn't love warm doughnuts accompanied by dipping sauces?S'mores Panna Cotta - house made graham cracker, chocolate ganache- Definitely a downer! The Panna Cotta was way too sweet and very difficult to mix together.Overall, the Stanton Social was a letdown.

We had heard so much about them that we couldn't wait to try them out. Sadly though this journey would end in disappointment. I'll start with the positives. AMAZING DESSERT, without a doubt one of the best donuts and syrup plates I've had before,  totally light donut with a good sweetness and perfect for dipping in the chocolate, caramel and raspberry sauces. The French Onion Soup Dumplings were great as well,  while not personally a fan everyone else at the table loved them. The Tuna Poke (sp?) was delicious as well but lacked any hint of spice or wasabi, and you really had to use the lime to add some flavor. While great samples from the meal they don't tell the whole story. The bad side of our meal really shows the downfalls of this place. This place is WAY overpriced for the size of the portions, I understand this place is a tapa location but there's a difference between tapas and sample size which is what they served half our meal as, this was especially true of the taquitoes which I felt was nearly a crime for what they dare served for that price. The other big issue was the lack of flavor, I understand people have different tastes but to just make everything bland pleases no one, almost everything was just lacking in any spice or defining flavors. While the concept is amazing for many of the menu items and the presentation was nice  it couldn't make up for being overpriced and lacking in flavor.

4.0,4/2/2015,"This is the place to be for happy hour. Given the name, Stanton Social, you can safely assume their food is designed to allow you to be more communicatively engaged with your party. I recommend making reservations because the place does get packed and when you arrive to make sure everyone in your party is already here otherwise they will not seat you. Their dishes are tapas style, basically finger foods meant for sharing. They recommend 6 - 7 dishes for parties of 3 but we decided to go for four instead and boy are we glad we did. I was stuffed like I just had a Thanksgiving meal. French onion soup dumplings, red snapper tacos, Crispy Barrio-Style Chicken Taquitos and Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies. While we waited for the food, we were given complimentary shots of carrot and ginger soup with crème fraîche. It was super yummy, I'd rather have it served without the crème fraîche. I liked this over the usual bread that restaurants give people prior to their food arriving. As for the tapas, my favorite was the french onion soup dumplings. Props to them for the creativity, but eat carefully because it's broiling hot. It was kind of hard to scoop out without breaking the soup. My least favorites were the taquitos and the red snapper tacos. The tacos are good but red snapper wasn't really my kind of fish. All the dishes were rich in flavor but some were not my cup of tea. For dessert, we did shots of Spicy Mezcal Hot Chocolate and Birthday Cake Milkshake and movie popcorn sundae. The shots were absolutely delicious!! Both were great but if I had to choose I'd say the spicy mezcal hot chocolate was better. I didn't really taste much alcohol in it but in the birthday cake milkshake you can taste some of the rum. The presentation was adorable. As for the movie popcorn sundae, it seriously tastes like movie popcorn. The caramel pieces and peanuts brings me back to the theaters, perfectly executed.

3.0,4/1/2015,"Tucked on the same block where my weed guy lived in the 90s, I had a flashback coming here for brunch. Sometimes, remembering what once was can really kill a moment; there's something so strange about dining in the lower east side, looking up and the people around you look like Hoboken. Eating here was like a bad Hollywood movie where the hero (played by your boy) realizes he was here before...before he acquired his secret powers, before the midwest of Amerika moved in and priced the OGs out and before weed could be smoked in wax form. That means one of two things: I'm old and... I'm really fucking old. The basil gimlet is perfecto... how's that for a transition. I would have stabbed my own damn self, if those words came out of my mouth while chill'n here in the 90s, but that's the truth, Ruth. The Bloody Mary was on point (ask for extra spice, cuz it's nice), the ""French Onion"" soup dumplings were OK, but the name is misleading in the sense that when you bite into it, theres a lack of actual soup (oh, and the dumplings were crazy thick and chewy). Still, it has cheese on it, so it's not a total waste. The lob'stah Benedict was good and the same could be said for the lamb tacos. I'd skip the wedge salad, because who the hell eats white lettuce anymore other then basic bitches, your female friends from Dallas (same thing) and your parents? They serve tapas style and everything was meant to be shared. It got packed later then earlier. This is a second or third option joint. Eat on the third floor if you can, because the first floor is just a zoo.The bathrooms on the third floor are dope. There's something to be said about windows at waist level cracked open while the wind from the alley cools the boys off and you're getting rid of some excess bloat. Brilliant. Service: professional, friendly and on point. $140 tab for dos during brunch was a tad steep considering we just rolled out of bed and wanted to grab something. Dear Jerome, you use YELP to talk shit about a lot of stuff, next time, you might want to actually read a review before saying, ""ok"" you douche. Or, you should take your sunglasses off and look at your surroundings and realize that this isn't Bereket. Or, never blindly follow a girl who says, "" Oh my gawd, the food here is soooo goooood"". Be prepared for an expensive brunch and a small wait. If you aren't feeling nice by your second drank, don't order another round, because these drinks were strong and $18 for a weak ass drink is dumbtard. The food choices overall are fusion...shocker. Asian, latin, Mediterranean, Kardashian, and douche' all hook up on the menu. It's not mind-blowing like when you first discovered wax, but it's mos def better then the dirt weed I used to smoke around here back in the 90's.

4.0,3/17/2015,"2000th review, yay! Boyfriend and I went to The Stanton Social for our five year anniversary. The restaurant was very crowded (as expected) and our table practically touched our neighbor's table. We ordered the following dishes, and we thought everything was really delicious. The only problem was that each dish contained some kind of cheese, and we got full really quickly. My favorite dish was the French Onion Soup Dumplings, and the mac & cheese is pretty high on my list too. As for the cocktails, I liked The Swatchbuckler more than Notorious F.I.G.

3.0,3/16/2015,"Unfortunately, my 2nd time here was not as stellar as my first. Pros:* One of the few NYC restaurants that take reservations for weekend brunch! They call you the day before to confirm* A winning dish to add to my previous review: French Toast Sticks $10 (nutella, vanilla crème fraiche, strawberries)- lightly buttery toasted goodness on the outside and soft and eggy on the inside. Cons:* I don't see why people rave about the French Onion Soup Dumplings, as they were pretty mediocre: the dumplings were chewy and there was no soup inside * Because The Stanton Social is so jam packed the noise level gets so high that I end up having to shout at times to carry a conversation (especially when seated in the semi-private mezzanine area) and the staff is spread very thin...so service was very slow (but friendly nonetheless). * There's only one bathroom on the first floor so it became gross and messy. During my entire time there the toilet paper was never replaced. If you find yourself waiting for the bathroom with 2 patrons before you, run to the 3rd floor- chances are it's empty and it's really pretty up there!* The Stanton Social is on the pricey side (a small but addicting slider goes for $8/each!) where total per person for a standard number of filling appetizers (with no cocktails) was $40 including tax and tip.",2,0,0,Ann L.,"Brooklyn, NY",1030,424,2247

The food- so we had the periogies, French onion soup dumplings, mimi lamb gyros and the red snapper tacos. I must say in terms of flavor- everything was amazing. The only draw back was the portion size. Yes- Stanton Social prides itself on small plates and sharing rather that individual appetizers/entree but at least give me enough on the plate so I don't have to stop at McDonalds on my way home because I was still hungry!!! (Yes it really happened). There were, on average, 4 pieces of each selection on the plate. I was able to hold the morsel of food with two fingers because it was that small. No utensils needed. The prices weren't too bad but you can easily spend a lot more because there isn't enough food on the plate. I will definitely come back because I want to try other things on the menu but will only come with my sister who likes to go out but doesn't like to eat. The service was pretty good too.

The ambiance made me think I was getting dinner at a fancy tapa restaurant.Other than the face my waiter took a while to fill my coffee, I was pleased with the service. I forgot to get the dumpling but, I made sure I ordered the French toast sticks because my friend who was telling me to come here was raving about these sticks. She actually said she got it for the appetizer and dessert in the same seating. These were definitely good. They were very sweet to start my morning though, so I would actually get them for dessert the next time I come.The spicy lobster benedict were great. You'll be enjoying the chunks of soft lobster if you get this. The arugula salad placed in between the two English muffins freshens your palate (I wish it had less dressing). We also ordered the red snapper tacos. You get3 small tacos-about 4 bites-that are well packed with the inner ingredients of avocado and mango sauce. These were good but I would want to try something else next time. The Bloody Mary my friend got looked like some grapefruit-cranberry juice but said it was delicious. The food is very good, but did not blow my mind. But the Stanton Social is definitely a place to have a good time with anyone. If you're looking for a good vibe you should come. If you're hunting for a new brunch spot with mind-blowing food, maybe you shouldn't.

4.0,3/2/2015,"Tried Stanton Social for the first time last night for Restaurant Week with my boyfriend. The Restaurant Week menu was incredible, all of the best pieces from the regular menu. We each got the 1 app, 1 entree, and 1 dessert for $38, and then we each got a drink (about $13 each, I got a glass of wine and he got a cocktail), and then we got one more app for the table. The food was excellent. There's so much detail put into every single dish, and even every piece of decor.The service was good, but the only reason I didn't give 5 stars. The coat check woman, the hostess, and the waiter were all great. However, there were 2 bus boys there who were VERY quick about cleaning up empty plates, pouring water, etc. However, they took my almost full dish of Penne Bolognese (I was already pretty full from the appetizers and wanted to save room for dessert ;)) and when he asked if he could wrap it for me, I said ""yes, please"" and then never saw the dish again. :( Really loved the dish and was hoping I would be able to have the leftovers.

2.0,3/1/2015,"I've been coming to Stanton Social for a few years now. I go once or twice a year for special occasions. They have an interesting drink and food menu. On paper. Over my times coming here, the more things I've branched out and tried, the less enticing the dishes become. The lobster roll is good, but you can walk 3 blocks to two different places and get a bigger and better one, for a fraction of the price. The French onion soup dumplings and the red snapper tacos are a staple here for sure. Everything else ordered was below average and the mussels and the ribs were sent back as neither was served warm or correctly. Which brings me to the value. I know it's trendy, and I know it's shared plates. But the price for what you get is honestly quite insane. Two of us split a bill for six people and I would've expected to pay what I paid for everyone. We all left hungry and unsatisfied and got a quick bite of food nearby (and it was better). Once you take away the fact that it's cool and there are (wannabe) models all around you acing like they are eating lots of food because they ordered two small entrees, this place will leave you feeling pretty empty.

For starters my boyfriend and I received a complimentary shot of carrot ginger soup. My first sip was heaven. The best part about this soup was its layers, varying textures and complex flavors. The foam on top was airy yet creamy and rich and the soup found below was sweet and fragrant with a hint of spice. This was the perfect appetizer while we waited for our main dishes. We ordered several dishes but the most memorable were the Beef Wellington, which was wrapped in a delicate layer of puff pastry and foie gras mousse; the Pirogies, which were filled with potatoes and Goat Cheese and came with an exquisite side of truffle crème fraîche;  and the Chicken and Waffles, which were breaded and seasoned to perfection on top of a moist waffle bottom with a side of maple syrup.

Also got the Mac n cheese and ricotta meatballs- very good as well. I also liked how the plate came out as they were made or in little shifts...

4.0,2/26/2015,"Came here with a group of 8 for dinner on Tuesday night and we had an awesome experience. My boyfriend was in town, and since this place serves their dishes tapas style, I figured it would be a good idea to do for a big group - and it was! A few of us arrived early so we grabbed a round upstairs. I tried the Notorious F.I.G. ($14) while the bf had the Blood Orange Jalapeno Margarita ($14). I'm a sucker for spicy drinks, and the margarita was perfectly spiced, but not overpowering and not too sweet. However I'm a whiskey lady so I preferred my drink over the bf's. We were originally going to do the Restaurant Week menu but since there were 8 of us... copious amounts of the same desserts/entrees just didn't sound appealing to us. So we made a game-time decision and decided to order everything a la carte, especially since the tuna poke wontons and the infamous French onion soup dumplings weren't even on the RW menu. Food:Cobb Salad Bites ($10) - these one-biters were tasty! They did a great job of encompassing all the flavors you know of a classic cobb salad into one little bite. Would recommend.French Onion Soup Dumplings ($14) - SO this restaurant is known for these bad boys... but I was sadly underwhelmed. We placed 2 orders of this and to start, I'm not sure why they've named these 'soup dumplings' if there technically isn't soup inside of them. The filling inside was just the caramelized onions. Presentation was good as it's served in the escargot dishes with melted swiss cheese on top, but they weren't anything to write home about. I LOVE French onion soup, but there wasn't much of the soup part that I love so much in this dish. I think just recently coming back from Paris and crushing French onion soups there might have pushed my standards a lot higher, but either way, it was just OK.Potato and Goat Cheese Pierogies ($10) - THESE WERE AMAZING. I mean, who doesn't like all three of the words all into one dish?!  These pierogies are served with a side of truffle crème fraiche that paired perfectly well. The filling was creamy, but the shell was still crunchy, and the crème fraiche sauce just tied everything together.Nori Spiced Tuna Poke Wonton ($15) - if these are the closest things I can get to having poke of any sort without having to go to Hawaii, then I'll take it! It's literally tuna poke inside a fried wonton shaped like a taco, and they're damn addicting - HIGHLY recommendRed Snapper Tacos ($11) - these were GOOD, but not amazing. The table had mixed reviews about this one - some liked  it, some thought it was a tad bit on the fishy side. I'd say this is almost similar to the tuna poke wontons, and between the two... I'd definitely go with the tuna poke wontons over these.Social Mac and Cheese ($14) - Okay so our group went a little crazy on this one as we asked for 3 orders of these things. MAC AND CHEESE OVERLOAD. I wasn't a huge fan of this... perhaps it's because this was the last order that was brought out and we were all already stuffed to the brim? I'm not sure, but I thought it was okay.Warm Doughnuts ($10) - this was a good dessert and the sauces were good. Donuts were still nice and warm and the sauces weren't too sweet. Really enjoyed this.We had about 3 bottles of wine throughout the dinner...so the total came out to be ~$70pp +tip.Service was attentive, friendly and not pushy. I loved that they seated us in a large round table as it's always difficult to have one main conversation going with a group of 8 people, so that made our experience so much better. This place is a lot of fun if you're with a big group, but make sure to book reservations ahead of time. I'll definitely be back!",2,2,1,Kerry P.,"Manhattan, NY",136,132,124

The atmosphere is nice and intimate, decor is on point and trendy and the food (for the most part) is really good. Here's what we got:Red Snapper tacos - 3 mini tacos on basically a wonton, with red snapper ceviche and masa. Tuna Tacos - same story as above, 3 mini 'tacos' of tuna sashimi served simply with green onion and a light dressing. French Onion Soup Dumpling - an interesting take on FOS. Essentially 6 little soup dumpling stuffed with onion and baked. They were alright. Not sure why they're so popular.  I would have rather had a bowl of soup frankly. Cast Iron Shrimp - it was so so. Slightly spicy, though not hot. Shrimp was well cooked and good quality. Chicken & Waffles - I didn't indulge but my group did and they liked them. Waffle was soft, but crispy and fried chicken was nicely proportioned. Not sure what all the fuss is about but it's a cool place that's nice for a casual dinner.

The service was efficient but since they were so busy we had more than one wait staff member.

Also the waffles in the chicken and waffles dish were great. The chicken left much to be desired.

I think the food lacks real flavoring from the natural flavors of ingredients. Instead, there is flavor but it is only enhanced by the addition of too much salt. In addition we drank German Riesling but it was too grapey and did not compliment our heavy tapas. Id say at the price we paid it was only worth half the cost.

The music was far too loud (I had to shout across the table) and the servers were almost impossible to find during the meal.

At our third try she seated us as we were about to go elsewhere. Really? The place was still empty at 7pmon a Monday nite.  Anyway our waitress greeted us but was real cold and snooty so that set the tone of the nite. The servers and bus boys were real friendly though. The food was nothing special or unique. Chicken and waffles was just glorified chicken fingers. Their signature dish of French onion soup w dumplings was not really soup but rather a small square of bread w some sautéed onion housed in an escargot dish.  So you can figure how much  ""soup"" you really got. Ribs were tasteless and dry. Mac n cheese was heavy and ordinary. Definitely not restaurant worthy. Only good thing we had were the cider steamed mussels and pulled chicken arrepas.

3.0,1/10/2015,"Came here on a Friday night, and it was packed. I had been here for drinks a couple times, but not for the food. I had a reservation for 2 on OpenTable for 7:30pm, but the hostess said our table wasn't ready. About half an hour later, we were still waiting and then I asked the hostess how much longer it would be, and she said she didn't know, and that she was ""sorry"" in the most feeble way possible. Not great. It was a cold night outside, so they were blasting the heat by the door, which made it a bit uncomfortable to wait inside.Finally, a few minutes later, we were seated upstairs, wedged between two people on an uncomfortable date, and a group of women having girl's night. Hoookay. The decor is pretty modern and trendy, as well as the music. The music was actually almost deafening when we sat down, and even one of the Mexican waiters was like, ""can we turn the f%$#ing music down, por favor?"" Sí, podemos y debemos, my good man. After glancing at the menu, the dishes looked fairly creative and sounded good, albeit way overpriced. $9 for a side of fries and $19 for 4 small chicken fingers and a waffle seemed just a bit exorbitant, wouldn't you think? But that's New York, I guess. Nonetheless, we opted for the mac & cheese, octopus, chicken and waffles, french onion soup dumplings, and an order of fries. The meal started off with a complimentary shot of carrot and ginger soup with crème fraîche. Pretty tasty. The waiters actually came out with the dishes at a pretty meticulous pace, and we kept getting new dishes just as we were finishing up our previous ones. The mac & cheese was standard but delicious, the octopus tender and well-seasoned, the soup dumplings were very creative and juicy, and the chicken and waffles were actually done well, despite my previous decrying of the price tag.All the dishes were well-executed and the waiters were actually pretty attentive and friendly. The only things are that the value isn't good and this type of establishment isn't for everyone.

2.0,1/10/2015,"The Stanton Social basically affirms my belief that tapas-type places under restaurant direction lacking an all-encompassing, specific cuisine are generally not that great. Sure, the place has a few noteworthy items, but they aren't good enough to fill out the rest of the fluff on the menu.In the least creepy way possible, I often look around restaurants seeing if I could be friends with my fellow diners. I've never considered, nor (now after brief consideration) desired going around introducing myself to strangers sitting around me eating, but, I will say, a restaurant's crowd is usually a good measure of a place's overall worth.Along with food quality, ambience, etc., I try to analyze enough of a crowd so that I can properly crunch numbers in order to delivery an accurate rating to Yelp and its varied constituents. There's a method to the madness and a lot of behind the scenes advanced metrics that go into these reviews. To add some depth... sometimes, I'll be super excited to try out a new place, but, upon walking in, I'll make uncomfortable eye contact with the wrong person and subsequently decide that I wouldn't be composed and impartial enough to sit through a meal in his/her presence.Now that everyone's caught up, I wanted nothing to do with the groups situated around my table at The Stanton Social.  Between the painfully lonely, single women brunching and the double dates of couples cheers-ing overpriced mimosas, I could only wish that #BlackBrunchNYC would storm in and protest.  Not that I agree with anything remotely related to their misguided demonstrations, but I merely wished that everyone sitting around me was made to feel as uncomfortable and dispirited as I was throughout my entire meal.",2,2,1,Matt S.,"New York, NY",153,88,3

We also all shared the red snapper tacos (fresh, a bit spicy in the best way), lamb gyros, cobb salad bites, the DELICIOUS mac n cheese, and the scallops.

4.0,12/1/2014,"Stanton Social was a pleasant surprise. I came here for a double date on a cold Saturday night and all I really knew going in was that the food was tapas style. I was happy to learn that they were American tapas instead of the normal Latin food you would see on such a menu. This was especially a fun experience for a double date because we got to sample different foods and discuss what we each liked.Between the 4 of us I think we ordered about 10 things? I was stuffed by the end and I think we could have been comfortable with a little less food, but no regrets. My favorite items were the french onion soup dumplings and tuna tacos. The kale caesar salad was excellent as well. Also I LOVED the birthday cake shot at the end - it was one of the best tasting ""desserts"" I've had in ages and I wish every meal ended with one. Only two minor complaints. First, we had asked for the chorizo on the side for our mac and cheese (had a veggie in our group) but our dish came without it, and we had to wait a bit to get the side of meat. Not a big deal. Second, the girl who was sitting behind me at another table had no concept of personal space and kept banging into my seat when I had no room. Obnoxious but not the restaurant's fault really (unless they could have rearranged the seating a bit).Definitely a fun place to come with a small group or a date.

The waiter came by and explained how the menu works for brunch and suggested 4-6 plates to get the full experience. We decided on 4 since prices seem decent but they will not fill you up.Ordered the oreo cookie pancakes and as a good waiter, asked us if we wanted that at first or at the end of our meal. we said at the end since you want to keep the sweets at the end so they don't cloud the palate for the rest of the food.Also ordered the eggs benedict and the egg tacos. The benedict was great, it came with a salda in between the eggs and it contrasted well with the bechamel sauce that came with the eggs. The tacos, were a bit small and just plain.Drinks here tend to be fancy and for around $13 each you must at least get one.The decoration is trendy, flashy and so nice for a nice date or two.",2,0,0,Juan T.,"Manhattan, NY",329,486,563

The beef wellington was super rich, cooked perfectly and definitely worth ordering if you like steak and/or foie gras. I still have dreams about it. Chicken and waffles were buttery, perfectly sweet and delicious. This was my first time trying chicken and waffles and I doubt I will find anywhere else that compares.

Food however, although original in conception is very average in execution/flavor and establishment is crowded. Price was not justified by value in my opinion.Food: french onion soup dumplings are a cool concept, but the dumplings themselves are overrated. I'm actually not sure how people can possibly like them so much, unless our order was a one time preparation miss. Our serving was too dry, had small portioned fillings, and just weren't that tasty. The perogies were the best dish, but still very average. French toast sticks were good but not satisfying due to small plate portions (again, not the restaurant's fault, but not good value for the price)Service: wonderful. attentive and knowledgeable servers. what you'd expect and more from a restaurant like thisAmbiance: A+ minus the crowdedness",0,1,1,Amy G.,"San Francisco, CA",451,340,14
4.0,11/6/2014,"Ok, let's see...what have I had here that wasn't good. Oh, that's right, nothing. I've been here a bunch of times and without fail it's always on point. The food is just great. Notable dishes: The ever famous French onion soup dumplings. Believe the hype, they're that good. Red snapper tacos were delicious. The snapper was fresh and the avocado and spicy mango complimented not overpowered the fish. Spicy lamb souvlaki. Just order it, you'll thank me. Braised short rib tacos...what could be bad about braised short rib? It was tender, juicy and a taco. They took a pedestrian dish like tacos and stepped it up to gourmet. Spanakopita is one of my absolute favorite greek dishes. I love the combo of feta with spinach. I liked the lemon aioli but still prefer my spanakopita with tzatziki. Kobe beef sliders - for once a slider that wasn't dry and disappointing. They're great but if I can make it at home I'm not inclined to eat it at a place like this. This dish, along with the herb dusted frites is a solid choice for the picky eater friend. You can't go wrong. The beef Wellington. Awesome. Who is turning down filet mignon with foie gras and mushrooms all wrapped in puff pastry? Who? Only a fool, that's who. The filet is cooked to perfection as is the puff pastry. If you're not too full and can swing dessert get the donuts. Actually order two orders because you won't want to share them. Light and sweet these babies are delicious. My favorite sauce was the raspberry. It's not too heavy like the chocolate and caramel. The red velvet twinkles...well it's a Twinkie and it's red velvet.

It's akin to a tourist trap.Reservations need to be made a few weeks in advance for Friday and Saturday nights if you want to eat at any decent time. Sure, many restaurants work that way, but this one is not worth it at all.Nothing we ordered was every worth ordering again. Red Snapper Tacos - too salty, everything is chopped up so finely I don't taste fish or mango or avocado. The flavors are akin to red snapper tacos you could order at an Appleby's.Fresh Onion Soup Dumplings - great concept, but not great execution. 6 deflated dumplings made with caramalized onions inside, topped with a vat of melted crispy cheese and a crouton in each one. Way too sweet and I don't even know why. Flavor is ok and that's about that. Greasy.Spanakopita - this was probably the best thing we ate. Not everyone liked it, but I did. Does not take the shape of traditional spanakopita, but is essentially 2 egg roll shapes cut into four pieces total. These egg rolls are fried and stuffed with feta and spinach cheese. Didn't like the egg roll wrapper, just ate the inside.Meatballs with manicotti - no one liked this one. Why are all of these dishes sweet I don't get it? The manicotti stuffed with ricotta in particular was just so blah. It seemed like store bought pasta with store bought ricotta and store bought sauce.Oreo Twinkie - small, not enough for one person, not really oreo at all, barely any chocolate, and super sweet.The best part was the complimentary teeny tiny parsnip soup they served in the beginning.Ambiance isn't great, way too loud, way too crowded, way too expensive.

I understand that it was busy at the time and maybe, just maybe, the bartender didn't see me. If this was the case in a bar this size, perhaps there should have been a second bartender on duty (Or at least a bar back who knows how to greet customers). Despite the great atmosphere and music I decided to leave. I would return to try dinner in the downstairs dining room, but I will not return to the upstairs bar. There are so many other places in town to get a good drink AND good service.I'm sure a restaurant/bar with such a great reputation can do better than this.Side note: There were at least 15 people standing in line for the bathroom, and people are going in 2 (or more) at a time for about 10-20 minutes each.

4.0,10/1/2014,"This is hands down my favorite restaurant in all of NYC. I love the ambiance. Whether you're looking for a date spot or a place to meet the girls, this place is it. It's super trendy, so be prepared for the snootiness you usually find in the Meatpacking District. You must have a reservation or expect to wait forever. Also, friendly note, if you do have a reservation and you're running late, they will only hold your table for 15 minutes, and then you'll be debased like Lindsay Lohan trying to get into the newest club. Seriously though, they don't care who you are, if you're late, you lose. This happened to me ON MY BIRTHDAY and I'm still giving this place 4 stars, which is saying something. The food is spectacular. They can't do anything wrong. The french onion soup dumplings are their signature dish and cannot be missed. Their beef wellington is also uh-mazing. Really, you can't go wrong with anything on this menu. My favorite part is that every item is a small plate, so you can order a bunch and try a little of everything. And trust me, you'll want to.",1,0,0,Chantal G.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,10,0

4.0,9/29/2014,"Food was very very good and creative. French onion dumplings A+, scallops and tuna tacos great, several of the other tacos were very nice too. Lamb gyros and sliders average. Ambiance was chick and modern w a lounge feel to it... I really liked it.  Drinks were average although I didn't order anything from their special drink menu. Service was a bit substandard and the reason why I'm giving it 1 less star... Probably a 3.5 would be warranted but bc the food and ambiance was so good I'll give them a pass. I just think they should pay more attention to detail. I mean it's not like the place is cheap and we aren't paying premium price for the food. Our waiter was kinda slow and lacked charisma nor ability to keep us attended without us having to waive at him for more water or drinks. Also, some of the other workers that pass along the table to grab dishes and bring others should be better trained in this type of establishment. They literally handed us some of the plates instead of putting them on the table... And we had to pass them the used dishes too. I mean who does that on a high end restaurant. I know the place was full but still attention to detail is imperative in this sort of place so for now 4 stars... I'll give them another chance and update my review hopefully to bring them up to 5 instead if bringing them down to 3 or worse",0,0,0,Jaime F.,"Albany, NY",1,21,13

They sat us at a lovely booth. The food was fantastic and the service was great.  The portions are small b/c the restaurant's menu is all appetizers meant for sharing but I guarantee that you will enjoy everything that you order.  We chose several dishes and shared and we loved everything.

2.0,9/22/2014,"What's the rave about??? Sorely disappointed with this place.  First, the hostess and manager.  We arrived promptly at 6 for our reso. We were a group of 6 but one person in our party was running a few minutes behind. They refused to seat us and wanted us to go upstairs to the bar. Had to throw a little fit - place was empty when we arrived. The manager explained that it throws off the kitchen because they would have to ""start a meal"" when he arrived.  Does he know this is a tapas restaurant? He then went on to explain that they had a reso behind us at 8:30?? Serious??  I said all the more reason to seat us now.  With a nasty attitude the hostess said ""well alright then, let's go.""  Not a good first impression.  Second, the food.  It wasn't that it tasted bad. It was just teeny tiny and not inexpensive.  So you need a lot to feel like you had a meal = $$$.  Several of us ordered the big sexy burger hoping that would be enough to fill us. We expected big and sexy (as it was named) and got small and tasteless - nothing sexy about it.  $18. Tacos were basically bite at ~$3 a piece.  You get about 5 ribs for nearly $20.  Insane to me. The only really yummy item was the soup dumpling.  Everything else was fairly generic.  Nothing special and definitely not worth what we paid - just over $500 and we went a few blocks and had to get more food at San Gennaro.   The highlight was our waitress - she was patient and helpful with the menu.  I know it's NY and I don't mind paying up but really? Plenty of good vibe places in NYC with real people size food.",0,0,0,Jack R.,"New York, NY",10,164,230
5.0,9/22/2014,"The Stanton Social is one of the best restaurants in New York by far. After ambling around SoHo all day, I was eager to sit down and eat at Chris Santos' esteemed restaurant. To my family and I's dismay, there was an hour wait. So, we went up to the lounge where we enjoyed a few cocktails and the DELICIOUS French onion soup dumplings. The dumplings were French onions stuffed with bread, with a thick French onion soup gravy poured on top. They were absolutely amazing. Chris Santos then came up to our table and talked to us for fifteen minutes. I was ecstatic since I'm an avid Chopped fan. Chris Santos was the most genuine guy and he had us seated right away. He then brought us complimentary gazpacho which was amazing. We then ordered an assortment of food. I liked how the restaurant's menu was all appetizers meant for sharing. It really brought a family aspect to the very chic restaurant. We ordered tuna tacos, a Philly cheesesteak, a dozen oysters, the summer squash ravioli, the red snapper tacos, and miso glazes mushrooms. First, the tuna tacos were delicious. Individually wrapped in a crispy wonton, stuffed with fresh ahi tuna, and topped off with avocado, cilantro, and wasabi peas. They were amazing. Next we had a dozen oysters and topped with the mango chutney, they were the best oysters I've ever had. The Philly Cheesesteak wasn't my favorite thing on the menu but it was still pretty tasty with a twist of truffle and goat cheese fondue. Some things are just meant to be kept classic. The Summer Squash Ravioli was amazing. It had the perfect balance of flavors between the doughy ravioli, crunchy squash blossoms, creamy ricotta, rich buerre blanc, and bitter basil. The red snapper tacos were recommended to us by the waiter and they were amazing. The creamy avocado complimented the spicy mango perfectly on top of the red snapper. Lastly, for a side we had the Miso glazed mushrooms. As an avid mushroom fan, I was very excited. The mushrooms were delicious and very rich complimented with the miso and mint. Overall the Stanton Social was a success. Their amazing appetizer style menu really brought a family element to the chic ambiance.

Anyway, it felt a little different than before. Granted this time I was here for brunch instead of dinner, but still, the crowd was very different than what I was used to seeing here. I can also say that the food felt different. While the drinks still remained VERY good at $14 a pop, the food all left something more to be desired. The lobster roll slider was ok. The Red Snapper Tacos were actually very delicious and very light, but their so called ""signature French Onion Soup Dumplings were a messy miss. Anyone that has ever had a real soup dumpling would be appalled by anyone calling what they serve here a soup dumpling because it really isn't at all.

The food is very creative and given the portions,  its great for sharing.  We tried the following:- French onion soup dumplings which were a fav all around and not overly salty,- pierogies - decent but my Oma's are better- French fries - solid, comparable to the Meat Ball Shop- meat balls - nice presentation and a good sauce- s'more creamer brûlée - not good, it lacked any resemblance to either of its namesakes- donuts - the dipping sauces were great and the donuts are made to order, a huge plus!I would go back for a special occasion and with a large group, but for a quiet night out, this is not the place to be.  Definitely make a reservation!",0,0,0,Nikita K.,"New York, NY",31,224,34

My bf was supposed to be out of town but ended up being around so we had to change the reservation but surprisingly, could only get a 6 pm res. I mean, I get it, it was only a few hours prior. Little did I know how PACKED the place was already going to be that early. I was really surprised. I had looked that menu online prior to coming but wasn't really sure what to expect.

They are fried to perfection and the goat cheese inside melts in your mouth.Baked spanakopita: also yummy. Loved the aioli sauce that came with it. Grilled caprese style pizzette: Also good, but my least favorite out of everything.Skate wing fish & chips: Fried to perfection. The ""chips"" are actually like a hash brown under the fish. Unusual but really tasty.Summer Squash ravioli: Also not my favorite, but still very good. For dessert we got the s'mores creme brûlée. VERY sweet but so so good. There were luckily 3 little individual ones..just enough sweetness for each of us.On top of the good food, the service was great. Very attentive and fast. The food came out pretty quick, too.

5.0,8/24/2014,"While in town on business, I met up with an eternally hip friend who moved to the city a couple years back. She suggested Stanton Social, and even just by its general profile -- small plates, intended for sharing -- I had what were likely overly lofty expectations. Arrival was simple, though the hostess did give us a brusque ""Give me a minute"" when we tried to check in on our reservation. Tucked away in LES, the inside was effortlessly cool in contrast to its cramped entryway. We sat at our table about 4-5 minutes after we initially checked in with the hostess. While the table was small, it was comfortable. And lord, those menus... Here's what you need to know:FRENCH ONION SOUP DUMPLINGS: if you just go for one item, this must be your choice. Crispy dough balls filled with the soup (what?) smothered in Gruyere and topped with crunchy croutons. The first bite was hot hot hot, but at any temperature these are phenomenal and are the sole contributing factor to my overlooking any element of anything less than stellar. BAKED SPANIKOPITA: ya know, I'm not the biggest fan normally, but damn. They weren't very greek/Mediterranean, but they were delicious and satisfying. Buttery, flaky, cheesy AND flavorful (the last descriptor generally being the missing element). Well done. POTATO & GOAT CHEESE PIEROGIS: also not normally something I seek out, but I liked these more than the spanikopita. The creamy goat cheese is always a recipe for success, especially in this plate. AHI POKE WONTON TACOS: the least impressive. This was the item I wanted the most, being an Angeleno who loves fish. Generally I've found that raw fish in New York is not as good as on the west coast (don't smite me, east coasters!)OLD SCHOOL MEATBALLS: the surprise hit of the evening. Second to the French onion soup dumplings, these were the favorite. Tender, juicy, savory and creamy. I expected dried out IKEA meatballs, but damn. There were only two sadly -- my only complaint. Trust me on these, they are a delight. Get them. WARM DOUGHNUTS: as an avid donut seeker who has tried everything (including the newest Wow-Nut, aka waffle donut), these were more churro balls than donuts. That being said, they are so worth it. They come with three sauces: raspberry, caramel, chocolate. The caramel was best and most churro-complimentary; raspberry was a fun tart coating; chocolate was not made for these donuts.

You are able to make a reservation at a cool location in the LES almost the same day. However, given the neighborhood you are in,when you actually venture to the LES, there are so many other places you can go that are better. The food here  tastes like it was thawed out from a sysco truck.In summary, this place is so passé and they know it. Go someplace where the people are down to earth and treat you well.

My friends ordered cocktails: cucumber/vodka, basil/vodka and jalapano while my friend and i split a bottle of Malbec. We ordered the following dishes: kale salad, red snapper tacos, beef and broccoli, mac and cheese, perogies, mini gyros, scallops and risoto, mini lobster rolls. Everything was fanatic and full of flavor. Each of the plates came in 7 small pieces so it was perfect for everyone to try everything. I would 100% go back.

1.0,8/21/2014,"I am not understanding how this place has such a high rating. I highly regret going here for dinner. First of all, it's very hard to find. There's no sign outside and it doesn't stand out. The decor is very nice, I'll give them that. Once seated, they told us that they recommend a table of 2 to get 5-6 small plates to share. We weren't that hungry so we got 3: The hand-pulled chicken arepas, chicken taquitos, and the braised short rib soft tacos. Each dish had 3 bites on it (literally each piece was one bite. Not 2 or 3 bites. ONE bite). Along with 2 cocktails, the bill came out to 90 dollars. WHAT? For 9 pieces of hors d'oeuvres? One of the dishes, the arepas, was just garnishes on a ritz cracker. I am not exaggerating here. They also took 30 minutes with my credit card. I saw it just hanging out on the counter. We had to go ask for it so I could sign and leave.

4.0,8/18/2014,"#TrendyThat's the perfect description of the Stanton Social and all that is has to offer.  We walked in and the place was jam packed.  Women in dresses, men dressed to the nines.  I, of course, was rocking sleeveless and comfy jeans, but really didn't feel underdressed at all.  The Stanton Social has a very warm and inviting atmosphere.We sat down, and per usual, it was a tight squeeze.  Not a complaint, but just a little side note.Let's get right to the food shall we?Kale Caesar Salad: I'm completely on the fence with this one; between like and love.  There was a smokey flavor on the salad that I loved, BUT the salad was blatantly underdressed.  Chicken Arepas:  Beautiful presentation and nice flavor.  The dish was spicy, but not overwhelmingly to the point that I didn't enjoy each bite.Fish and Chips: This was my favorite dish...1) because it's fried and 2) Because all of the flavors worked very well together.  The dish consisted of fried chunks of skate and sat upon perfectly fried ""adult tater tots"".  Adult simply meaning they were much larger than average tater tot.  They were topped with a homemade tartar sauce, and it all just worked.Beef Wellington: My only complaint; I wish this dish had been served on it's own.  By the time we had a chance to get to it, it was already a little cold.  BUT this dish is shining star.  Perfectly, and I mean perfectly cooked and exceptional flavor.  I would highly recommend.Dessert: This fried little donut bites. Clearly it was my cheat day from my normally impeccable eating habits....totally worth it on every level.  The donuts came with a raspberry, caramel, and chocolate dipping sauce selection.  All were packed with flavor and the perfect complement.I would happily come back here, but be forewarned, a speciality cocktail will run you $20 a pop.",0,0,0,Leslie C.,"ASTORIA, NY",231,148,30

4.0,8/15/2014,"So, I've been to the Stanton Social a few times in the past but all before 2009. While I've always loved the actual venue and ambience, I found the food to be kind of overrated. I dined here last night with some girlfriends, and I was pleasantly surprised. This time around (and based off of Yelp reviews), I ordered differently, and have to say I really enjoyed the food as compared to the past.You can't be seated until your entire party arrives just FYI. But they have a nice bar upstairs where you can wait in the mean time. Our reservation was for 8:30pm but the rest of my party didn't show until well after 9pm. The place was super busy but they accommodated us without hesitation. We were seated at around 9:30pm at a cute table right by the window. The place gets pretty loud but our spot was nice + cozy. There were 4 of us and we ordered French onion soup dumplings (kind of amazing), red snapper tacos (tiny, cute, and delicious -- although a tad fishy), beef & broccoli (couldn't spot the broccoli but interesting + pretty good), California style veggie burger (I loved these but some of my non-veggie loving friends weren't the biggest fans), Philly cheesesteak (so good), the Social mac n' cheese with the chorizo on the side (I'm a huge mac n' cheese lover so while this was good, I didn't think it was amazing; it's also really heavy), and the grilled summer squash ravioli (yummy). I wanted to try the fried chicken + waffles...but I think I was the only one ha. I'll try them next time. I would def order the French onion soup dumplings, the veggie burger, and the Philly cheesesteak again. Also, we were stuffed by the end of our meal but my friend ordered the S'mores Creme Brulee -- 3 come in one order, which we ended up sharing anyway. I wouldn't have ordered it on my own but they were SO good. Def recommend.Our server, Danny, was great -- he was attentive and friendly. He offered to adjust our plates to include 4 of everything bec most plates came in quantities of 3. Food came out pretty quickly -- usually 2-3 plates at a time.

I also really enjoyed the s'mores creme brûlée, cute shots of chocolate and a toasted marshmallow topping.

5.0,8/6/2014,"My husband and I got married at Stanton Social less than two weeks ago. We were supposed to get married at reBar but it closed abruptly in May, 2014, leaving us little time and money to plan another wedding. I was devastated that we lost our money and wedding venue and the thought that we may not have a wedding at all. After a week of feeling utterly miserable and sick, my husband and I began to look for another wedding venue.Upon hearing of the closure of reBar, Stanton Social immediately attempted to help the effected couples by offering to host weddings at a greatly discounted rate. I had been to Stanton Social on several prior occasions and loved it. I was overjoyed when I learned they were offering to host weddings at discounted rates. My husband had never been so we decided to check it out together.We met with Stanton Social to discuss possibilities for our upcoming wedding. From the start, they were incredible--so incredible that we literally did not believe it was even possible that people could be so helpful and generous, particularly after what we had been through with reBar.  I kept saying it was too good to be true and that something was bound to go wrong.  Stanton Social kept reassuring me that, while it may seem to good to be true, it really was true.  After our first meeting, my husband and I decided to book our wedding at Stanton Social--the venue were great, the food and drinks were delicious, the staff was full of energy, and they were more than willing to work within our limited budget. They were so responsive to all my questions and their organization was such a relief that I, a control freak, felt totally comfortable letting them coordinate the details.The event coordinator, Natalie, and the manager were so eager to ensure that our wedding would be special and fabulous. It was so apparent that they genuinely cared and wanted to make things right for us.  As we planned the details of the wedding and worked with Stanton Social, they continued to go above and beyond what we expected. They not only gave us an extremely discounted rate but also added complementary food and drinks options. Again, it just seemed too good to be true.The wedding day was completely flawless! The ceremony was beautiful and the reception was so, so perfect. The staff was absolutely amazing.  They worked so hard and many of our guests told us how impeccable the service was throughout the night. The food and drinks were excellent and the staff made sure that my husband and I had food and drinks throughout the evening. We literally could not have asked for a better or more perfect wedding.Since our wedding, my husband and I have already returned to Stanton Social for dinner and we will surely be back again soon. It's a fabulous place with wonderful service and food and people who truly care.  It's also been rated one of the top restaurants in New York.   You should totally visit this place--you are sure to have a wonderful experience!",0,0,0,Dawn O.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0
4.0,8/6/2014,"Love, love, love this place. Came here initially on someone's recommendation of the French Onion Soup Dumplings on a cold Sunday night. The dumplings lived up to the hype, as did every other tapas style dish we tried. Each dumpling is an explosion of deliciousness in your mouth! After my first experience here, I've come back to this restaurant using a GiltCity voucher and on several other occasions simply for drinks and a few small dishes at the bar. The first time I came here, the waiter recommended we have about 6 plates among the two of us (two girls), so the bill definitely adds up, but every dish I've tried here is incredible and worth the money. The Kobe Beef Burger may have been one of the best I've had. The old school meatballs are very good as well. I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese, but the Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies are still one of my favorite dishes on the menu. The presentation of the food is fantastic, the atmosphere is very chic -- dim lights and loud music. Perfect date spot, or to simply go and hang with friends. It gets very crowded at night, so I recommend a reservation. Even when I came here on a Sunday evening around 7pm, there wasn't an empty table in the place.

3.0,7/18/2014,"3 1/2 stars. First dinner spot in NY after my arrival from LA. Originally had reservations to ABC kitchen but did not work out so made reservations last min at Stanton. The inside is real nice, dim and glamorous but casual. There is also a small upper area for more lounging and grabbing a few drinks at the bar upstairs. Since we did not have reservations we did not get to sit in the main dining room but was fortunate enough to be seated more in a quaint corner near the door. The girl hostess were not that friendly and the service was pretty bad. Especially since we were tucked in the corner it was hard to get some service. The pictures and reviews looked great, but sadly our experience for the first night was disappointing and unpleasant. The food is tapas style, and let me say tapas in NY is way smaller than tapas in LA!_Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies ($10). Caramelized onions, truffle creme fraiche. A popular dish and I can say it was well deserved. Comes in 4 small sizes of lightly fried potato balls with gooey and warm goat cheese inside. A bit on the heavy side but great to share with a person or 2. The truffle creme fraiche though!! was the highlight. You can taste the truffle creme, light and airy and the caramelized onions add a nice sweetness to it. _Red Snapper Tacos ($10). Creamy avocado, spicy mango. Comes in 3 small crunchy shell tacos. Generous amount of red snapper. The flavors were well balanced and refreshing. The spicy mango added a nice kick to it and did not take away from the red snapper. We ordered 2 of these since they were the best dish that night. _Kobe Beef Burger ($8). One small slider of a burger. Came with a few chips that were not even necessary. The meat itself was juicy and tasty but it was real salty! the bun was warm and the good amount of cheese. That's about all I can say for this small $8.00 slider._Old School Meatballs ($14). Basil & ricotta 'manicotti'. This was the most disappointing. 2 meatballs that were good but texture was mushy and overall dish reminded me of Chef Boyardee instant food. Very plain the small pasta underneath was overly cooked and tasted mushy as well. $14 for this dish made me want to cry. What a waste!I did not even want to stay for dessert.

3.0,7/14/2014,"Recently took some out-of-town guests to the Stanton Social for some great food.  Have loved this place in the past but was incredibly disappointed this trip.  I think it has better food than it's sister property, Beauty and Essex, though I prefer the ambience at Beauty.  Stanton was MUCH louder and more crowded than I recall. We were seated promptly and at a good table.  When the waitress arrived I wanted to order only two items to start so as to pace the meal.  She specifically stated that we should order everything at once because their chefs would absolutely parse it out.  No sooner did we order than two plates arrived, followed immediately by two more.  We had four plates taking up the whole table after I especially asked not to be rushed.  Then the last two entrees arrived.  We ordered wine and drinks, as well as dessert.  While I was eating desert, literally a spoon in my mouth, a manager came by and dropped the check  on the table. Hadn't asked for it and hadn't even been asked by the waitress if we wanted anything further. Check was practically flung on the table. Upon paying the bill i wrote a comment on the card about the service/experience.  To their credit, a manager came over to discuss.  While he apologized, it didn't particularly seem sincere - especially given that when he offered to buy us a drink to end the evening on a positive note, he did not want us taking the table any longer and asked to buy us a drink in the ridiculously crowded (read fire marshall capacity), standing room only, bar upstairs.  I've been to a lot of restaurants in NYC and on a friday night no less.  I have never been as rushed as I was at Stanton.  It obvious how badly they were trying to turn over guests.  The table of two sitting next to us had paid their bill and were having a quiet chat whilel finishing their wine.  The manager came up to them and ""encouraged"" them to leave as well by inquiring what further he could do for them. It was just such a blatant push the whole evening.  Incredibly disappointed if this is the new standard for the Stanton.  Not sure I'll be back.",1,0,0,Cynthia P.,"Manhattan, NY",55,2,1

I would suggest arriving on time for this place (especially on a Saturday night). From what I can tell you would still have to wait, just not quite as long. Also, your entire party has to be there to be seated. Once seated, both the service and the food were amazing!  The food is all served family style, and if you have more people than each order comes with, you can add extra serving a la carte on many of the dishes. The french onion dumplings were so good! They are served in little trays usually reserved for escargot, and I could eat more right this second! Also something that stood out was the shrimp and grits. They are individual with two shrimp and a grit patty underneath. Definitely a treat. while the atmosphere of this place is charming it is also fairly loud.

And our waiter was probably one of the sweetest waiters I've had to date. She was attentive, gave us great suggestions on drinks, and was very accommodating. The food:1. Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies: If you come to stanton and you don't order these, you are seriously missing out. We could've eaten these for the rest of the night and been just as content with our meal. 2. French Onion Soup dumplings: while i understand this is what stanton is famous for, I thought these were good but they have better options on their menu. they definitely didn't live up to the expectation after reading all the yelp reviews. 3. Chicken Taquitos: also good but not great. 4. Sliders: We got the veggie, lobster roll, and kobe beef. the veggie and lobster roll were okay but the kobe beef was out of this world amazing.5. Chicken n Waffles: amazing!! i loved that they came in 4 small portions and i loved the taste of the syrup along with the louisiana hot sauce butter, great sweet and savory combo!The drinks we got were the strawberry fields, blood orange jalapeno margarita, and basil-lime gimlet.

3.0,6/6/2014,"Good food but way too rich and heavy that leaves you breathless for few hours, the service is too aggressive. Overall, not the most pleasant experience. One of our starters were snapper tacos that had a drop of a sauce on the side. I wanted to deep my taco into this sauce to have a full experience of the dish the way it was served, but as soon as we picked up tacos from the main serving plate, the stuff just grabbed this plate because I assume they thought we were finished with it. There was another little dish on our table I wasn't finished with and the stuff came to us 4 times asking, ""Are finished?"" I was still chewing my food when they came up and it bothered me because I was thinking to myself why would they ask me that if I was still chewing my food and my mouth was full to even respond? I couldn't relax and enjoy because I had to constantly protect the plates from being cleaned off the table too fast. When you spend roughly $80-$100 per person, the last thing you want is to be rushed. The food was good, but not amazing. I would give 5 stars on the presentation and 4 stars on the flavors and quality. We shared 5 dishes among 2 people + a desert and everything was so rich and heavy that we had a hard time digesting it after. My husband asked me to give him some kombucha to help with digestion, haha!The ambiance was nice and the vibe was great. Maybe because we had an early dinner, the music wasn't as loud as later. If only we were allowed to enjoy our dishes, I would've been much more happier and probably would've given 5 stars to this place.

5.0,5/28/2014,"I had read the reviews that the Stanton Social was a loud restaurant, and boy were they right. The minute we stepped inside, the place was bumpin'. It was a flurry of activity with people gabbing away at their tables and music pumpin' through the three floor space. Luckily for me, we were seated on the third floor which is a lot quieter, which suited me much better. The space definitely has a vibe and a life to it that you are not gonna get at home.To start, we ordered some Red Snapper Tacos and the Hand Pulled Chicken Arepas. They are known for the Red Snapper Tacos, and while they were good, I prefered the chicken arepas myself, which is why we ordered another round of those later. The dice on the vegetable and fruit on the red snapper tacos was so tiny and a real treat. I thought it brought a nice textural element, but the texture of the hand pulled chicken was out of control good. That little pile of chicken just melted in my mouth.We also tried another dish they are known for, the French Onion Soup Dumplings. I must agree with a previous reviewers when they said that they taste better than they smell. The smell is definitely a little off putting... must be the cheese. Though they are tasty. They weren't my favourite thing there, but they were definitely the most unique and creative.For our main we had the Fried Chicken and Maple Cheddar Waffles with louisana hot sauce butter. Because this was a main and a little more money it was a bigger bite, and you got four servings instead of three like some of the others. So don't be oftput by the price differences as you will get more bang for your buck. I thought putting the maple inside the waffle instead of syrup was a smart idea. And they were so delicious when you wiped some of that hot sauce butter on it.My favourite part of the meal though, and the best dessert I had in New York, and one of my favourites ever was the S'mores Creme Brulee. I haven't been so surprised by a plate of food in a long time. The creme brulee was cold which was surprise #1. Surprise #2 was the liquid bitter espresso like chocolate underneath. The sweetness came from the marshmellow, but the bitter came from this, and they mixed perfectly. And the textures were quite different with the marshmellow, and the liquid chocolate and the creme brulee. This is a dessert not to be missed!",0,0,0,Paul E.,"Toronto, Canada",92,311,357

However, if there's a wait for a table, I'd suggest waiting no more than 10 minutes because you're in the LES and there's plenty of places in this hood. I especially loved their crab cakes there.  Also, what's quite dangerous is when you arrive with a party of 5 (or more), the waiter can adjust each dish so that everyone gets their own portion.

3.0,5/18/2014,"On food alone, this place gets 5 stars. But overall review, I take off a few for icy hostess and ridiculously loud obnoxious music. We were a party of 8 on Saturday evening. Half our party was late for the reservation and half sent up to the bar. When the late party arrived we weren't seated until our friends came down from the bar, the hostess was adamant we all had to be present to be seated. Okay, I get it, I do. But they were squaring a check and on their way down. And we were staring at our set table that obviously was for us (the place is pretty small) and we couldn't sit down why? It just seemed weird. So when our friends finally came down the hostess then asked us if we would be finished dinner by 7:45, presumably because that's when that table was next reserved. Ummmm, I guess it depends how fast your kitchen cooks the food--wth kind of question is that? Like you're not sending that party up to the bar first?? I mean, just weird. Thankfully when we were seated we had a very friendly waitress. She also recommended a number of dishes based on the number of people at our table and at first this sounded like a lot but once you get rolling (and eating) everything is delicious and you'll gladly order more. Everything we had was delicious--everything. No low notes here. Even the boring sounding spinach salad was to die for. Drinks were STRONG! Very nice, especially for what they cost. Most of us were too full for dessert but we had the donuts and they were good but the red velvet ""twinkie"" was a bit of a disappointment. Otherwise the food was good and we would go back based on food (and drinks!) alone. The music is crazy loud. Why do trendy places insist on loud music? If I want to go to the club I'll go after dinner. I mean, seriously? You can barely hear the person next to you. One woman in our group barely talked, she didn't even bother, till we hit a bar later.

1.0,5/17/2014,"So, let me preface with: I should have known better.I should have known better than to:A.) Make a reservation a this place for a Friday nightB.) Be surprised that my table wasn't ready at said reservation time (that it would be at least 30 minutes before we'd be seated) C.) That there would be a place for my party and I to stand while we waited for our table to be ready (besides out in the rain)And D.) Expect that the service would be professional and friendlySo here's how it actually went down. A friend from out of town was visiting and we decided at 3pm on a Friday that we wanted to go somewhere good for dinner with another friend. This dinner was doomed from the beginning (and maybe this is another thing I should have known), as it was just too good to be true that there were a ton of reservations available for this place on open table. I had dined here before and the food (while a bit overhyped) was good and had lots of variety (good for our mixed group of carnivores and vegetarians) and was super surprised but very happy to snag one for 9:30 for the three of us. So, I arrive at the restaurant first and it was an absolute madhouse. The whole place was squished with people like an over-packed club. I shrug it off, it's a Friday, maybe these people are just here for drinks so I wait in line to let the hostess know that I was there. Super icy vibe from her from the beginning. Instead on making a note that I was there she tells me to come back when my party is all here. Fine. I know the drill, everyone needs to be there to be seated. She's way nicer to the dude next to me who is early with his party of 11 for their 945 seating. Maybe she knew him? She doesn't ask if his party is all there.My friends arrive two minutes later.I go back in to tell the hostess that we were all there she looks at me and says ""name? Reservation time?"" Like we hadn't spoke literally two minutes ago. Fine. Whatever. I tell her again and she says ""ok you can go have a drink up at the bar, it'll be 15-20 minutes"".So, we try to go to the bar upstairs which is literally SO packed I bet the fire department would have shut it down if they saw how many people were in there. It was crazy. We couldn't get near the bar. Instead we go back outside to wait but it's raining and, at this point I start to feel pretty terrible that this was the place I made a reservation for my friend for her Friday night in New York. At 9:45 we decide that if our table isn't in the process of being cleared, we'll find somewhere else in the area to go and start looking for alternativesSo at 9:50, I go back to the hostess and ask how much longer it will be. Again she pretends like she didn't  remember me and proceeds to tell me that the table has the check but there's no way she can know how long it's going to be. Yea, I've played this game before. That's codeword for at least another 15-20 minutes (Btw forgot to mention that the dude with the reservation for 11 was seated 5 minutes after he got in) and there wasn't even a hint of an apologetic tone in her voice. So I say thanks but there's no place for us to wait and it's raining outside so we're going to go somewhere else and start to leave. The lady actually tries to argue with me about me leaving!! She starts telling me that I only told her 10 minutes ago that I was there (false) and that we can wait inside if we want to (false) and just won't let it goI'm sorry but that's ridiculous. I get it that these restaurants build in a buffer for people to drink at the bar before there meal but if that is not possible, I'm facing a 30 minute wait for my reservation AND there's no place for me and my party to stand except in the rain why on earth would you argue with me about my deciding to go somewhere else where my party and I can actually eat/drink???? How could you be anything but apologetic about the fact that you cannot honor my reservation in the first place??? SO unprofessional.we finally left went to a casa fox down the street and were treated like actual human beings and had a great dinner.So yea tl;dr: this place is way over hyped, unprofessional and super scene-y.

4.0,5/13/2014,"I really liked this place.We went here for a bachelorette party dinner, and I think the atmosphere was perfect.  When we first arrived, we had a reservation, but were asked to wait upstairs at the bar area until our table was ready.  This was the only real problem I saw with the setup, as the bar area was very tiny and crowded and the bouncer kept pushing through and asking everyone to move to the side.  There was barely any ""side"" to move to, so we stood in a corner holding our ground for 20 minutes or so until the hostess came up to tell us our table was ready.The food was random but delicious.  Highlights of the meal were the pork belly tacos, the chicken and waffles, and the donuts and s'mores creme brulee for dessert.  I wasn't really crazy about the ""famous"" french onion soup dumplings; they lacked flavor and just didn't blow me away.Big props to the DJ for rocking an excellent mix of mid-2000s hip hop/dance music all night.  He really played to the early 30s crowd and we were singing along to all our old college jams.  Good place for a fun and lively dinner out.",2,1,1,Alana M.,"Falls Church, VA",0,23,0
3.0,5/13/2014,"My husband and I heard so many things about the Stanton Social so we decided to give it a try one night recently. At first impression, seemed like a cool, fun, trendy place with bumpin music. We arrived ~10 minutes prior to our reservation so we were told to wait at the bar upstairs and the hostess would come get us. Took them almost 45 minutes for them to get us seated, which I was quite disappointed about - what's the point of making a reservation if you can't get seated on time or at least near the time of the reservation. It also seemed as if the hostesses would pay more attention to the douchey guys trying to flirt with them who came in after us - who we saw get seated before us! At that point - after already waiting for my table for 45 minutes, I don't care who you are, you can wait to be seated.Once we sat down, the service was very good and fast. Our waiter suggested some of the small plates from the menu and we went with most of the suggestions. The food quality was pretty good, but have had better tapa style food elsewhere. I felt as if most of the items we ordered were ordinary, nothing spectacular that would make me go back for that one particular item.We had the french onion dumplings (very good - prob the only outstanding item we had), meatballs (good, but pretty regular), red snapper tacos (pretty good, but seemed as if they were pre-prepped and not fresh),  goat cheese pierogies (pretty good). For dessert we had the mini s'mores shots which were quite delicious but nothing ""different"" compared to what I've had before.Overall, pretty decent place if you're looking to bring someone to look cool in front of but in terms of having top notch small plates/tapas cuisine, this ain't it.",3,0,0,Ceida P.,"New York, NY",361,57,82
5.0,5/13/2014,"Been dying for years to go to the Stanton Social. No tables were available so we went to the lounge area, we got a nice seat up there. Unlike the dining area the lounge area has loud music playing and a beautiful bar right up the stairs. So if you're looking for a quiet dinner the lounge may not be the best place to eat. The lounge ended up being perfect for us, we were four people. We pretty much ordered everything on the menu but some of the best were the French onion soup dumplings, spareribs, mac & cheese.

4.0,5/12/2014,"I've been here on two separate occasions, five years apart. My first visit left a positive impression, and the most recent one was this past weekend. I'm happy to say that while there have been menu and ambiance updates, quality is still up there. Quarters can be a bit close - often, you have to move tables to be able to sit, and it gets very crowded. We waited for our table in the upper bar area, which is cozy and a fun place to meet for drinks. I don't make decisions well, so I didn't do any of the ordering. There were mushrooms and carrots, fish and chips, a taquito, oysters, some other things I can't remember...the beauty of a tapas place is that there is a lot to order and eat, without being ridiculously full. The drink menu is creative (albeit a bit complicated for my simple tastes), and everything comes out in a progressive fashion that is not rushed, nor overwhelming. It was all quite good, and service was attentive without being overbearing.

If you like truffles then the goat cheese perogies are a must. The Mac n cheese was a bit spicy since they add peppers and chorizo but it's so good! I love the miso mushrooms as they are a bit sweet. The salmon is a good size to share between 2 people. And of course, their signature item are the dumplings, they are a must try!

5.0,5/4/2014,"Well well well, it's about time we've met. I've been looking for you for some time now. If you know anything about me, you know that I'm a sucker for a good cooking competition show. Food Network, Bravo, you name it, I'm probably watching it. So when I see Chris Santos as the judge on Chopped and they talk about his restaurant on the Lower East Side, you know that I've had it bookmarked for a while. Finally, we should up last night to see what all the hype was about. I made a reservation through opentable a few weeks before as this was the destination I had picked for my fiancés birthday dinner. We were seated right away and there seemed to be 3 men who were upper management walking along the restaurant checking in on everything constantly. Nice touch. Our waiter was very nice. We didn't see much of him as the bussers brought over our food but when he did check in he was cordial and went over the menu with us and told us about some highlights. He insisted we order the potato and goat cheese pierogis and the French onion soup dumplings. Obviously I've been scoping out the menu for quite some time so of course those were at the top of my list. Here is what we ordered: 3 oysters: 2 west coast and one east coast. My fiancé loved them. They came with 5 accompaniments. His favorite was the marinated orange segments. Potato and goat cheese pierogis with truffled crème fraiche: Oh my god. Fried perfectly and the crème fraiche was incredible. The cracked black pepper on top was a great touch and those caramelized onions were heavenly. French onion soup dumplings: Holy crap. Excuse my profanity but holy living crap. These were PERFECTION. The French onion soup was so rich and tasted heavily of wine and the cheese was crispy and melted. The bread-vessel was delicious and I just loved them so much. If there are 4 people definitely order two orders. 3 for myself made me happy. Shrimp and ""grits"": What an incredible dish. For $22 you get 6 perfectly cooked shrimp over 3 delicious cheesy grit cakes with the most amazing creole sauce I've ever had. The shrimp were so tender it was like cutting into a scallop. I was obsessed with the little grit cake. Crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. Delicious. Big sexy burger: One of the best burgers I've ever had. Gooey cheese, perfectly cooked patties, delicious sauce, crazy good caramelized onion, on a soft roll. Served with BACON AND BLUE CHEESE FRIES. Need I say more? Brussels sprouts: Acidic sauce that made them sweet with pancetta that made them savory and crispy leaves with grated parmesan. I don't think I'd order these again but my fiancé loved them.Red velvet Twinkie: I kind of regret ordering this instead of the suggested donuts. I saw pictures of this Twinkie and knew I had to have it but it was very dry. Between the two of us we barely got through half of one. I'm glad we only ordered one. Spiked milk shake shot: Tasty! You could definitely taste the bourbon. Fun end to the meal. Only negative was the food was spaced out at weird times. We'd get two dishes and wait like 20 minutes for the next few dishes to come after they cleared our plates.

5.0,5/1/2014,"This is my ""ideal"" type of restaurant.

I don't exactly remember all the things that we ordered, but I do remember the chicken/waffles and their scallops.  Both of them were great.  There wasn't something that we ordered which we regretted ordering.After downing literally every single cocktail on the list (i started from the top, she started from the bottom and we met each other half way) we decided to try the whiskey chocolate molten cake.  We weren't expecting it to be the best we ever had, and it wasn't....but it was still pretty dam good....Then we spent about 4 hours trying to find our car. :).",1,0,0,Biru S.,"Mamaroneck, NY",333,671,153
5.0,4/30/2014,"After reading reviews on here before trying Stanton Social, I was a bit nervous. Many reviewers felt the service sucked, so I was basically expecting the waiter/waitress to be snobby, be pissed that I was using a Gilt voucher, and effectively ruin my experience - buttttt BOY was I wrong! The Stanton Social was a fabulous experience - delish food, great great great service!!!!! (A++++) and beautiful atmosphere. I had made reservations about a month in advance (as the Gilt Voucher tells you to do) and I was delighted that my table was ready immediately at 8PM on a Sunday. I know the city is always busy, but for some reason I thought the restaurant may be quiet on Sunday...again, I was wrong about this place. The place was buzzing, a very cool hipsterish vibe (conveniently located in up and coming gentrified LES.) It has very dim lighting, super romantic and chic. Great date place for sure, but also accommodating many large groups for bigger parties. Now, onto the service, our waiter was a young guy, maybe in his late 20's, early 30's who was a DOLLLLLL. He didn't flinch when I mentioned we have a Gilt voucher and didn't even ask to see it until we were paying our bill. He put in the pre-fix orders right away, slowly went over the drink menu (I'm a bit picky and wasnt sure what to get hehe..) and recommended what we should order. We added a few additional menu items (Kobe sliders - just do it!!) and we tried to snapper tacos, meatballs, pizza, french onion soup dumplings, chicken arepas, and probably some other items I can't remember but the tapas are all freaking amazing. In particular I looooved the arepas and the french onion soup dumplings (duh, you have to get those, theyre practically famous)  We ended our meal with warm doughtnuts which were delicious - if you can realistically eat 85 tapas and then have dessert. Our server was attentive the entire time, but not overly in our space. The bus boys did a great job of cleaning up in between each course, and our drinks were quickly refilled as we enjoyed them. Overall, the Stanton Social was a great experience. The mood is very cool, food was amazing, drinks amazing, and service, despite what others have experience, also very good!

Of course, we had to wait for a table which was fine, I wanted to check out the bar upstairs. One bad thing is that the place is SMALL, for the amount of people that go there.

It seems like they didn't want to serve us from the very beginning. When I first gave my name for my reservation I was told there was no reservation under my name. I pulled out my phone and showed them my reservation confirmation from Open Tables. I was told that e-mail was not from them and they didn't have a reservation for me. Finally, I guess they realized they couldn't continue with that lie, so they suddenly found my reservation. I was then told I couldn't sit because my entire party was not there. They were parking and arrived 2 minutes later. One person was running a little late so I asked if we could sit and he could join us when he arrived. They told us he would not be able to sit with us. I really didn't believe them. So we got a table but were told we only have until 8pm to eat. I do not understand how you give people a time limit at a restaurant. So we sat and ordered drinks. The last member of our party arrived maybe 20 minutes later. A member of the staff escorted him up and we were told he was not able to stay. We asked if he could pull up a chair. They refused. We told them we would make space in the booth we had. They refused. For people that are in the hospitality business, they did not try to ACCOMMODATE us at all. So we decided to leave.

It cost $103 pp (w/o tax and tip) for a prix fixe dinner (of a ton of food) and open bar for 2.5 hours (one drink at a time and no shots). This was one of the best deals we found for such a large group dinner at short notice.Apps: red snapper tacos, french onion soup dumplings, potato & goat cheese pierogies, grilled cheese quesadilla.

The dumplings were definitely interesting but more of a novelty dish for me- try once and never again.Entrees: Chicken n waffles, kobe beef sliders and pea crusted salmon.

The sliders were great though and hit the spot.SIdes: Herb frites were crazy addictive and I loved pairing them with the mayo dip. Mushrooms were very tasty as well.Desserts: Warm doughnuts, reverse chip cookies. I wish I could have enjoyed these more but I was so stuffed at this point.

Once seated, we decided to order 3 items on the menu to share. I picked the scallops, and fish and chips. My boyfriend picked the chicken taquitos. The highlight for me was the scallops served with risotto. The fish and chips was pretty good, as well. The taquitos were good, but not on the same level as the other two dishes.

But within 30  minutes, the place became packed and I mean, packed like sardines in a can. In order to get up and use the bathroom, we had to invoke tetris skills and move and shift everyone around in order to have enough room to get up and go.The food was very good. Some dishes come with just 3 pieces and some came with 4 pieces.  We had 6 in our group so they were able to add al la carte so that each person in the group got to try every tapas. I am not sure how the al la carte pricing goes but by the end of the night, the bill was about $290...with tips, it was $110/couple and we did not even get drinks.Here is the breakdown of the food that we ordered:Red Snapper Tacos (just alright. Perhaps we had a bad batch. Snapper tasted very fishy and not too fresh)Spicy tuna (this was one of my favorites)meatballs (Very good. I recommend)Beef wellington (Excellent. I approve)Sliders (Good. We asked for medium well and it came out medium rare with bits of ground beef squirting out with each bite which makes me gag a little)Ribs (just ok. I could leave it the next time I go)Mini Lobster roll (just ok. Lobster didn't have too much flavor)Pulled pork (Very good. Recommend)French onion dumplings (french onion part was good. But the wonton/dumpling in the middle was just mediocre. Taste was reminiscent of frozen shumai that you could get at an asian grocers)DESSERTS:Rootbeer Milkshake Shot (good. A bit on the sweet side for my asian tastebuds. Non-asian folks may enjoy it)Red velvet twinkies (These were TDF!!!! Hands down, THE BEST ITEM that I had all night.

4.0,4/13/2014,"Went here for my Birthday in March on a Sunday. It was loud and busy, I really loved the atmosphere. The decor is perfect. We waited upstairs in the lounge and ordered a few cocktails until the rest of my party arrived. I forgot what I ordered but it was something peachy, strong & sweet. Worth the price. I knew the concept of this restaurant prior to coming here and was excited and open to it but my friends- not so much. Needless to say I enjoyed it the most, and it was my birthday so I didn't care. The French onion soup dumplings weren't as amazing as I thought they would be based on all the reviews. The red snapper tacos were really good, but the highlight of the meal was the shrimp & grits, hands down! Our waiter recommend them and I couldn't have thanked him more. They were delicious & a little spicy, which I loved, I ate all three.

5.0,4/10/2014,"My brother and I went relatively early (between 5:30 and 6) on a Sunday night, but it got very busy not long after we arrived.  Definitely order the French onion soup dumplings --they were amazing, same with the pierogies.  The meat just fell off the bone of the cider & bourbon baby back ribs. They were succulent and very flavorful.  Just thinking about them makes my mouth water. I didn't taste the mango in the red snapper tacos, and they definitely have a delicate fish taste. If you don't like strong flavors that might be up your alley. For dessert we had warm donuts and the s'mores brûlée.  I would say the donuts are overrated, but the s'mores were scrumptious!! So yummy.  Service was great--absolutely professional.

We all loved the French Onion Soup dumplings - they taste better than they smell - and the Tuna tacos and Chicken and Waffles are great as well. Our waitress was very nice and recommended 8 small plates for the 6 of us. We got 7 small plates and 2 lobster rolls, and then mid-way through got nervous it wouldn't be enough and ordered 2 more. It ended up that our original order would have been fine, because by the end we were more than full!",0,0,0,Lauren D.,"Manhattan, NY",6,21,0
4.0,4/9/2014,"3.5 stars - delicious but way overpriced for the amount of food we got. My fiance and his brother had to have a second dinner soon after. Our waiter did recommend 6-8 dishes for the 3 of us. We thought he was just overestimating (like most restaurants/servers do). So instead we went with just 5 main dishes and saved room for dessertsRed Snapper Taco - I was expecting red snapper sashimi/poke in these tacos. Nevertheless, loved the combo of guac, mango, spicy mayo. Very similar to the tacos we got in Zengo. French onion soup dumplings - their signature dish - each order came with 6 in a escargot plate- delicious but wished the cheese was melted - it was somewhat lukewarm by the time it was served.Beef Wellington - the puff pastry was buttery and rich, the filet mignon + foie gras mousse however - lack of seasoning and no sign of the mousse.  Salmon - This was my favorite dish - I loved the pesto, sriracha crust - lots of unique flavor + texture, along with the cold soba noodle salad - was very refreshing. Surprised this wasn't a more popular dish. I really wished we had just ordered 5 of this dish.Scallop - my fav seafood on a bed of creamy risotto - can never go wrong. Loved the pan seared + seasoning. Might be close to one of the best scallop/risotto I've had.  Warm donuts - came with 3 dipping sauces - airy, very much like beignet - instead of being coated by powdered sugar, they were coated with white sugar. Each order came with 6 - definitely worth trying. Red Velvet Twinkie - red velvet anything is always amazing. Also worth trying - it's only $4 per twinkie! Service was on point, place + servers were gorgeous. The only thing that is deterring us from returning is the steep $. When I'm a ballin professional, will definitely return to check out their brunch menu.",2,0,2,Wing C.,"Pasadena, CA",213,1497,10231

3.0,4/7/2014,"I feel like I was hoodwinked by The Stanton Social. The menu looked really reasonable and definitely delicious when we were trying to decide where we would enjoy our last NYC meal. The Stanton Social fit the bill. However, it wasn't until we sat down that we were told the menu was small plates and that a table of four (us) should order 9-11 plates. Uh... what? I've never had to order ELEVEN small plates to feed four people. But we did as we were told and got ten plates, because service was really slow and the restaurant was full and we didn't want to have to wait forever we decided we wanted more. It ended up being a really pricey meal. If I had loved everything I had tasted, that would have been fine. But some items were not a crowd favorite.From best to worst:'Chicken n' Waffles' - $19brick pressed chicken, aged cheddar waffle,corn pudding, balsamic spiked maple syrup- These were very very good. Potato Latkessour cream, apple sauce $6- Traditional, flavorful, very nice.

Like none. And it was a hot mess. French Onion Soup Dumplings $12- Just... no. They were difficult to get out their little pots, they were extremely potent (think of the smell of rotten onions) and they were quite soggy. If you have a texture thing, this dish is not for you.Red Snapper Tacos -creamy avocado, spicy mango $10- The fish genuinely smelled spoiled. I couldn't eat half of my taco. The waitress was great enough to add on extra portions of items that came in three's, or guide us toward what we would like, but over all I was not overly impressed with a lot of the food.",6,1,1,Sarah V.,"Chicago, IL",774,432,164

It was a fun atmosphere - great for a date as long as you can handle the noise.The service was great, however, the food was really sub par.

2.0,4/3/2014,"Came to dinner here with 7 friends. It was on our bucket list of restaurants so we were excited to get a reservation with short notice. This place operates in a two-wave manner - one round of reservations early, the other late, therefore they would not budge when we asked to push back our reservation by 30 minutes - annoying. Anyway, we were seated right away in a cozy booth. Within 30 seconds of sitting down a lifeless waiter came to take our drink orders (hadn't even taken off my coat), and he seemed annoyed when we said we needed a few minutes to look at the menu... We quickly realized that this restaurant tries to get everyone in and out in under 30 minutes. Sorry, but if I'm shelling out money for overpriced drinks and dishes ($14 cocktails, $18-$25 small plates), do NOT rush me.

4.0,3/31/2014,"What a chic place!  I rarely venture to the LES, but I'm glad I did last Saturday on a rainy night to check out Stanton Social.  The space was definitely trendy, like a combination of industrial (brick walls) with a touch of refinement (gold embellishments).  It was obviously a popular place, but I did manage to secure a reservation for Saturday night on Saturday morning.  The menu is tapas style which is intended for people to share together.  We had (the renowned) French onion soup dumplings, little-neck clams, veggie burger, and brussel sprouts with pancetta.  All were very well done, and some included interesting little extras.  For example, the clams included unique garnishes beyond the usual cocktail sauce and fresh lemon wedges.  Even the desserts, like the mini doughnuts, included additional sauces like hot fudge, raspberry sauce, and caramel for dunking the doughnuts.  I thought these little touches made a big difference.  It is important to note that a lot of the items on the menu were on the spicy side and heavy on the cheese, so I felt some of my options were limited.  The service was very attentive and efficient, which I found impressive to be able to do on a busy Saturday night.  My one complaint would be the noise level.  Not only was it packed, the music was a little too loud, and it became difficult to hold a conversation at times.  We ate on the first floor, but there was also a bar upstairs.  The layout was open, so those upstairs could view down below.

I don't know if this sets a pretense with the staff that they automatically give you lesser service (even though we still tip on the full bill), but I was so put off by this place. 1. Our places were not set and our plates were literally tossed on our table to the side (not even placed in front of us). It was so abrupt it startled me mid conversation. 2. The waiter never came by and when he finally did, he took our drink orders and our menus and walked away without a smile. Well 1 - I didn't actually order a drink I asked for a recommendation. He tried to put in three cocktail orders for two people? Please just listen to me. 3. Food was mediocre and was again thrown on our table with deliberate force. The waiter aggressively moved our plates aside as we were still working on our food to put our next plates up. May times tried to take plates away that clearly weren't finished. 4. The dessert came with the bill unprompted. The whole experience made us feel rushed. Which obviously in turn made us inclined to tip less than we normally do at the 20% range.

Something told me 3 or 4 would be suffice. I saw most people who were leaving walking away with doggie bags.  Chances are the waitstaff are told to suggest nothing less than 5 (for a table of two people) so the bill can be set to a minimum.  I think they should let people decide what they want to order based on hit items.  And so we did, we ordered what we wanted.Anyhooo....on to the FOUR (not FIVE; yet filling) dishes.  We ordered:- Red Snapper Tacos - very tasty and yummy!- French Onion Soup Dumplings - not the hype we expected, it was just ok!- Social Mac and Cheese - yummy but I had enough after a while- Chicken and Waffles - yummy; perfect for splittingI was full.  So was my boyfriend.  Realizing we were told to order nothing less than 5 dishes, we were happy that we stuck with just 4, especially when it came to our ""pockets"", even though we were there for a fundraiser.I did want to pop my head into the kitchen and see if Chris Santos was available, just to give feedback and offer my thanks on holding this fundraising and matching the numbers to give back to the school, but it was crowded, we were tired, our bellies were full, and it was a weekday evening and yet had to get ready for another day.  Until next time...",0,0,0,Angie S.,"Bronx, NY",32,30,7

1.0,3/2/2014,"After a lot  of hype I have heard about this place, I decided to give this place on a Friday night to try.We were late for our reservations but they were nice to seat us after about less than 10 minutes of a wait which was good.  The ambiance is very hip, great music and a great mix of crowd.Food was just okay. The best I had was the Pork belly tacos and the carbonara spagettini which has pork belly with crispy skin on top of noodels and small raw egg on top. This was probably the best I had. My favorite too. The rest of the dishes were okay like the chicken and waffles, pea crusted salmon and crab cake corn dogs. We also ordered red velvet twinkies which was very dry and the cream cheese icing was super salty.  My friend said the donuts were good and worth ordering.I gave this place a 1 star because I think our server = who was the super tall white guy with shaggy straight hair ( Friday night, Feb 28th shift)was playing favoritism and a RACIST.. First of all he suggested for us to get 5 dishes to try which I think was too much because I barely ate my share of the chicken waffles and the salmon. I sincerely thintk that he TOOK ADVANTAGE of us once he found out it was our first time here.  He barely checked up on us on how we were doing and if our dishes tasted good. And I think he was playing favoritism. There were two ladies next to us who did not order drinks and ordered only 2 dishes and 2 desserts which he only charged them for one because I overheard him say that if you don't like the first dessert I give you, just take one bite and if you don't like it, I will take it off your tab and give you a different dessert. WELL, we didnt like the red velvet twinkies and he didn't even bother to ask us if we liked it or not. He just charged us anyway. Is this because we were ASIANS and the two laides next to us where WHITE??? This is completey unfair. I didnt say anything at that time, because I did not want my experience here to ruin my beautiful Friday night.Chris Santos, if you're reading this, please take care of this. This is a CLEAR example of how this server is a complete A**. Please read my review about QUALITY MEATS and read about LOUIS our server.

The cheese had congealed on the top and we had to perform some dumpling surgery to extract them. The squash ravioli and pierogies were elite and I'd order doubles of those next time. The ribs were falling off the bone (and were the most generous portion of the night) but the sauce was a little heavy and sweet for me. Both tacos were solid but not something I'd order again.

This dish was amazing, and, if you're in similar shoes to mine (which are usually a pair of Dr. Martens), it makes for a perfect portion for a solo entree. The salmon is delicate and light, but really jumps to another level with the crusting which gives it a really nice texture and flavor contrast. It's a bit more sweet than spicy, but definitely delicious.

4.0,1/26/2014,"Stanton Social is so very close to being a 5-star review for me, but there were a couple aspects that irked me.The menu is all tapas and it's recommended to order 5-6 for a table of 2. My boyfriend and I had 6, with room for dessert, and we were comfortably full for the rest of the night.Must haves:- French onion soup dumplings. Not much soup but still so rich and delicious. The concept itself is worth ordering.- Tuna poke wontons. These were presented in mini fried taco shells but the tuna was absolutely amazing. I don't think I've had tastier marinated raw tuna anywhere. - Sriracha and pea-crusted salmon. Very light and the beet and cold salad pairing was refreshing.- Spaghettini carbonara. So cute! Little individual mounds of spaghetti topped with pork belly and a quail egg. Absolutely delicious.Just OK:- Crabcake corn dogs. Awesome to try because I love crab cakes (yay Maryland) and corn dogs separately but these weren't mind blowing.- Beef Wellington. My first time trying anything with foie gras and I just don't think it was meant for me :/ the beef was cooked perfectly though. As for dessert, definitely get the bourbon hot chocolate shooters. We heard great things about the donuts but opted for salted caramel mousse with popcorn (!!) flavored ice cream. It was amazing and so unique.Cocktails: the ones with whiskey were SUPER STRONG and I loved my Strawberry Fields drink with citron Grey Goose. Worth the $13 per drink. Only complaint is that they really pack you in - we were literally inches from the tables next to us. Thankfully, there is loud music playing to mask conversations but it really only makes you talk louder... also we had the waiter's butt in our faces a few times, which wasn't too fun (no offense). The downstairs seemed WAY louder and chaotic than upstairs and there's a definite lounge vibe here. All in all, the food here is delightful and memorable. Would definitely come again!

I never imagined French onion soup turned into a dumpling, but they did it, and it's an awesome little bite of soup in your mouth. It kind of reminds me of shanghai dumplings.

So when an eclectic group of friends, head to the city on a Sunday, we had one thing in mind. Good Eats!. I was biased to Stanton since I love Chef Chris from my favorite show Chopped. So I knew I was in for a great ride of culinary treats. I have to say, I was happy they were able to seat us quickly, considering we were running late So the 5 of us shared a booth, which allowed for this tapas style brunch invasion. The waiter informed us to order at least 2 dishes per person at the table, and we somewhat followed the rule. ok, no we didn't, and ended up having to order a few more dishes. I have to start with the drinks, I ordered the strawberry fields, it contained the only two types of alcohol I actually like, grey goose and Riesling together? with strawberries? Yum oh Yum... I was already happy and not one tapa hit the table. One of my friends had the proseco Bellini, and the guys settled on beer and black magic which consisted of Guinness with champagne.

Well for someone who enjoys going out to clubs, bars, concerts, etc,...it was about as loud as going to a club.  It was hard to have a conversation with someone 2 feet away from me.  Sure, if this was a bar or club...I'd be fine with it.  But for me, a guy eating several tapas courses...the music could have been just a bit lower.  I did enjoy the music they were playing though, and found it hilarious that some people there were dancing in their seats.  Next onto the food, I found it very overrated.  For the prices and portions, it just wasn't that good.  Sure, none of the food was horrible....but for the swankiness and high expectations I had for this place...my experience came nothing close.  The only thing I say is worth coming for is the french onion soup wontons.  Do yourself a favor and get a table near the bar upstairs, order a few drinks and get an order of these wontons per person.  They are unique and delicious and well worth the hype.",0,1,0,Seth T.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",47,65,4

There was a live DJ that made things festive too.The only negative thing I'd say about this place is that there are only 2 bathrooms (I think?) so lines were super long. Not enough of an issue to knock down a star because the food was just so memorable.,1,1,1,Jessica S.,"Hidden Hills, CA",4,37,1
5.0,1/6/2014,"The food and the atmosphere was great! You must order the French onion soup dumplings & the ravioli, & the creme brulee. The salmon and brussel sprouts were really good too. And we saw Candace Cameron eating at the table next to us. :)",0,0,0,Leah L.,"Savannah, GA",0,26,14
2.0,1/4/2014,"I've given this two stars, because the food is amazing and creative. The service is pretty good. But picture being trapped on a slave ship. Packed in like sardines. A table for seven, according to them, is a table for four. Picture being fed a drop of luxury for the moments you are trapped in between people. If you are lucky enough to get to the bathroom, there is only one stall. If you are caustrophobic do not come here. If you like being packed in as a sardine than do. My God you couldn't pay me enough to go back here again even for the good food. Good luck.",1,1,0,Liz B.,"Floral Park, NY",24,32,6

3.0,1/4/2014,"Prior to having brunch here, I would have given this place 4 stars. This is really more of a 3.5. Overall the food is decent, some interesting things on the menu. But it's OK, nothing amazing. The ambience is good, and can be 'fun'. Generally reservations are easy to make and you get seated promptly. The dinner is much better than the brunch. Don't go for the brunch. The french soup dumplings are different, but very salty and heavy. The Spaghettini Carbonara was pretty good otherwise nothing really stood out. For dessert, the donuts are pretty damn good. The dessert shot that was had was really yummy. Loved the smores creme brulee. For brunch, the banana pancakes were pretty good, and the lobster benedict. The taquitos were OK. The chicken and waffles are really nothing special. They tell you to over order, suggesting 2-3 dishes per person. Depending on what you order, this can be really way too much food. We ordered 1.5 pp for dinner it was perfect. We ordered 2pp for brunch and it was too much. Especially if you order the more expensive items, count those as 2.",3,0,0,Nancy H.,"New York, NY",48,121,135

The service was attentive, but not intrusive.Our server suggested 2-3 plates per person.  We ordered a total of 4 plates for two of us - and that was just the right amount.  Everything was delicious!-- Potato and Goat Cheese Pierogies - Tastes like a regular pierogie when you bite, until you start chewing and it hits your palate - then a burst of unusual tart flavor of the goat cheese.  It works well with the softy, gooey, carmelized onions.-- French Onion Soup Dumplings - Incredibly creative.  Who could ever think of this?  A dumpling - filled with french onion soup - covered with melted cheese!  -- Kobe Beef Burger - The meat melted in mouth, seriously.-- Butternut Squash Ravioli - Having a mild obsession with butternut squash ravioli (seriously), I give this an ""okay"" rating.  Definitely not the best I've had, but good.  If you want to choose between this and something else - don't feel like you are losing out if you pick something else.",0,0,0,Jenn A.,"New York, NY",73,459,122
4.0,12/31/2013,"I wouldn't say everything was good but some of the good stuff was great and the variety was impressive.Let's get out the problems first. Also these problems aren't fatal and I think could be fixed with a little thinking.French Onion Soup Dumplings - very cool idea but there has to be someway to make sure the soup does't leak out. Like XLB, the best part is the splash of the soup in your mouth but most of our dumplings leaked. Maybe bake them on top of spoons or something? The toothpick through them, while looking cool probably doesn't help either.Kobe beef slider - tastes good b/c the ingredients are good but I'm not sure where the value added was.Things I liked: Crabcake corndogs! These suckers had a lot of crab in them and not cheap tasting crab either. Very sweet.Pierogis are very solid, great dipping sauce.Beef Wellington - little foie for your face and it's great.

5.0,12/29/2013,"I'll be honest, knowing that the Chef Santos grew up in the next town over from me, I wanted to like The Stanton Social. Well, I loved it.  One definitely knows that they are dining in NY when they are here, with the gorgeous room, fun music and the throngs of beautiful people, albeit not as pretentious as one might expect.  Servers know their stuff, but are cool as heck.  No phony smiles, no noses in the air.  Drinks were great, with a lot of love put into the cocktail menu.  I'm a sucker for a good ginger beer/lemon cocktail and the Brooklyn Lemonade did not disappoint.  But how about the food you ask?  Let me start a new paragraph to touch on that.Dining with a friend who adores The Stanton Social, we started with the French Onion Soup Dumplings.  Not a fan of French onion soup, I shuddered, but she shot me a nowing look as I took my first bite and WOW!  Red snapper tacos were absolutely flawless.  Don't get me started on the Maryland crab cake corn dogs...awesome!  Entree selection killed me as there was a lot that tempted me, but I finally settled on the 'Chicken n Waffles' and they rocked.  The balsamic maple syrup was the show stealer of the plate.  On my next trip to NYC, this will be my first stop, and maybe my second, but definitely my last.",1,1,1,Jorge C.,"Dallas, TX",382,98,18

5.0,12/24/2013,"I can't believe I've never written a review about Stanton Social since it's been one of my favorite restaurants since I moved to the city in 2006.  Whenever I have to pick a place for a small group, Stanton Social is usually on the top of my list and it always ends up scoring points with everyone.  It's exactly what people look for from a NYC restaurant.  Here's why:Location: LES is now chic and gives the grimy NYC factor that people long for from the days of old.Vibe: Trendy to the max.  Loud music, mood lighting and beautiful people.  Not pompous but you'll know you are either in NYC, Miami or LA when dining here.Service: Knowledgeable, attentive, cool.Bar: Speakeasy quality drinks.  The upstairs bar kind of feels like a speakeasy with the heavy steel door.  Cool lounge seating for casual drinks and snacks.  Food: Excellent.  Quality ingredients expertly and ingeniously prepared offering plentiful options for even the pickiest of eaters.  Tapas style which is my favorite because you get to try multiple dishes.Value: Not great but not over the top.  You are certainly getting what you pay for here.  Best thing on the menu are the pierogies with the truffle cream.  Don't miss these!  You can't go wrong with anything though.  I guarantee a fantastic dining experience from start to finish.",2,0,1,John D.,"San Francisco, CA",127,218,34
4.0,12/22/2013,"Came here to take a birthday boy out for dinner. It's a really nice place for birthdays, date nights and even an engagement. A guy proposed to his girlfriend and the whole restaurant cheered him on! Woohoo! One thing that I noticed during the night was that the person at the next table was literally sitting 5 inches next to me. You don't really get privacy and you basically know everyone's business (Didn't really bother me much, but I know it might be annoying for others). However, it's a small place so I get that they're trying to pack as many table in as possible. The upstair lounge area was a lot less crowded and quieter. I suggest you head up there if you're only going for a drinks. Now on to the food:1) We started off with some cocktails and wine. I ordered a Selbach German Riesling (which was delicious) and he ordered the Summer Centennial (and they did not cheap out on the whiskey). 2) We had complimentary celery root soup. I'm not a fan of celery, so it was a bit off for me. 3) Red Snapper Tacos were amazing! They sprinkled avocado and mango salsa on top. Just FYI: The next table told us that the Braised Short Rib Soft Tacos was not a very good option. (Like I mentioned, everyone knew each other's business...haha)4) Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies were DELICIOUS! The truffle creme fraiche really made my day! It had a cool and refreshing taste to it. I wanted to dip that sauce in everything. 5) Butternut Squash Ravioli was probably the best dish of the night. The butternut squash puree had so much flavor to it. 6) Kobe Beef Burger was cooked medium rare was very juicy and tender. But for $8 for a single mini burger was ridiculously priced. 7) Same goes for the Rhode Island Lobster Roll was $10 for a little roll. Although it was delicious, I could have gone to Luke's Lobster and gotten a gigantic roll (with 4x the lobster meat) for $15. 8) Spaghettini Carbonara was okay. The pork belly was very crispy and flavorful and the quail egg was really adorable on the dish. However, pasta is just pasta at the end of the day. They were sticking to each other like glue. I think if they used spaghetti squash it would have been more unique.9) Chicken n' Waffles was decent. The waffle was made with a thick and heavily dense dough. It was fluffy and I wanted a lighter batch, but that's all based on preference. Parts of the chicken was dry and bland and the other part was salty. 10) Cider & Bourbon Heritage: This was probably my least favorite dish. I felt like the sauce overpowered the taste of the spare ribs. Last but not least, DESSERTS! I had asked the waiter if he could put a little candle on our dessert since it was a birthday surprise. As he was taking our order for dessert, I looked up to stare at him (as a reminder for the candle) and he just winked back at me letting me know everything was taken care of (cutest waiter ever!!!!!). 11) Milk Chocolate Salted Caramel Mousse was not bad. It felt more like a chocolate sandwich, but the salted caramel popcorn they used were delicious. I would have been satisfied with the popcorn itself. Everyone else was ordering the Warm Doughnuts and that looked AWESOME! 12) Our lovely waiter sent the birthday boy a chocolate cupcake with a little candle (just like I asked for) and that just ended our night beautifully! I was happy with the result. **Just a note: Overall, the dinner was amazing and I wouldn't have changed it one bit. However, just a note, I came here a month ago to make reservations and this asian hostess gave me the nastiest attitude when making reservations. Also, you have to make reservations in advance. I originally wanted a dinner reservations for 2 at 7pm on Thursday, Dec 19 and they were all full and only had a 10:30pm opening (and this was a month in advance. I didn't think thursday was such a hot night).",2,1,1,Win C.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",325,623,3078
5.0,12/21/2013,"My friend treated me to an early birthday celebration. Yayy!!!My friend made reservations, but we still had to wait a few minutes before we got a table. This place is really gorgeous. A beautiful candle lit environment. A little loud, but a Good place for a date night, family dinner, or a group gathering. Apparently this is also a good place to purpose to your love one. Saw a man purpose to his girlfriend next to our table. This is a tapas place. In terms of ordering, I'd say go with your gut feeling. 1. I ordered the Centennial- pineapple infused Stranahan's, Colorado Whiskey, fresh pineapple, coriander syrup, fresh lemon. Lots of Whiskey is all I have to say. 2. To start, they gave us a complementary Celery Root soup. I like celery, but this was an okay soup. 3. Red Snapper Tacos with creamy avocado and spicy mango. Good flavor. I like the kick from spicy mango. 4. Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies- caramelized onions, truffle creme fraiche. A great dish. I definitely like this one a lot. Dip the pierogies in the truffle creme fraiche and its oh so good. 5. Kobe Beef Burger (medium rare)- Juicy and delicious tasting burger. 6. Rhode Island Lobster Roll- I like lobster, so I was curious what this would this was like. It was okay, maybe above average tasting Lobster Roll. 7. Cider & Bourbon Heritage Baby Back Ribs- my friend said it was burnt, but it tasted alright. Not crazy about this dish. 8. Chicken and Waffles- brick pressed chicken, aged cheddar waffle,corn pudding, balsamic spiked maple syrup. The Chicken tasted good, but the waffle was definitely the best part of this dish. 9. Butternut Squash Ravioli- vanilla brown butter, crispy sage,toasted squash seeds. A delicious sweet ravioli. Best part of my meal. Absolutely enjoyed this dish the most. 10. Spaghettini Carbonara- braised pork belly, sunny-side up quail egg. Not bad. If they could have done something with the spaghetti or use something else, it probably would have tasted better. Dessert time.11. Milk Chocolate Salted Caramel Mousse- brownie, caramel popcorn, popcorn ice cream. A little too sweet is all I have to say. Too much milk chocolate, in my opinion. 12. My friend and Stanton Social surprised me with special Birthday Cupcake. Yayy!!! What do you get when add all those up. MAJOR FOOD COMA!!! I definitely OD when I ordered.My favorite dishes were the Butternut Squash Ravioli, Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies, Kobe Beef Burger, the Red Snapper Tacos, and of course my surprise birthday cupcake. The food was 4 stars, but since my friend and Stanton Social made my birthday extra special I will give them a 1/2 star. Oh wait, you can't give 1/2 stars. Ok 5 stars it is. Service was really great.

5.0,12/21/2013,"My expectations for The Stanton Social were both high and low...the legend of this restaurant, and the outstanding Yelp reviews got me really excited for my book club holiday party. But at the same time, how can a restaurant really live up to all this hype, years after opening?Well, The Stanton Social exceeded even my highest expectations! Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I knew that the space overall would be pretty small and that we'd be sitting pretty much on top of each other, as well as our neighboring tables. This was indeed the case...we were packed in like sardines, but somehow it was OK. The two story high ceilings really open up the space, and the low lighting and banquet tables make things feel intimate. Though a few from our group of seven had been to the restaurant before, a couple of us, myself included, were newbies. So the waitress took us through the menu and explained how everything is small plates. She also said that though some dishes come with just 4 or 5 items, she could make sure that we got 7 of each thing so we could all taste every dish. What a brilliant policy!We started with some yummy cocktails...I loved the Strawberry Fields ($13) cocktail of Grey Goose Citron and strawberries. Then we dove into the menu ordering the following:--French Onion Soup Dumplings (AMAZING!)--Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies --Old School Meatballs --Butternut Squash Ravioli--Chicken and Waffles (my fave of the night)--Crabcake Corn Dogs--Mac & Cheese with Chorizo--Tuna Poke Wonton TacosEverything was delicious, unique and fun! The whole meal was well-paced, since the dishes are served as they become available. I absolutely loved the French Onion Soup Dumplings and the Chicken and Waffles. And I had three helpings of the Mac & Cheese. After dinner, we did our gift exchange and samples the Warm Donuts with Dipping Sauces (chocolate, caramel, strawberry). So good!And if you can believe it...our bill came to just $60 a person...this is a great place for a group of fun people who like good food, good drinks and good conversation!

The dishes are a creative spin on classics. They are delicious and flavorful and make you want just a bite more...My friends and I all loved their cocktails. They were all very strong and not too sweet. I loved their gin based drinks!I was very disappointed in the service the last time I went to Stanton Social. My party of 3 made reservations for 730. One of us were running about 5 minutes late and they refused to seat us until the whole party was there. When my friend arrived, we were told we would need to wait longer for the next available table. We were seated 15 minutes later. Our waiter was attentive at first, graciously taking our drink and then our dinner orders. However, once the food started arriving, he was nowhere to be found. We wanted another round of drinks and to order an additional dish (after seeing it served to the table next to us). We had to ask another waiter to flag him down. When we wanted to order dessert, our waiter was again nowhere to be found. Another waiter ended up giving us dessert menus and our waiter seemed reluctant to take our dessert orders. He was, however, very prompt with dropping off the check (before we even asked for it). He dropped it off immediately after our dessert came (before we could even take a bite of it). He came back several times while we were eating out dessert to check to see if we had looked at the check yet. He was very obvious he wanted to turn over the table even though we had only been there for an hour at that point. One of the busboys started taking our drinks away even though we were not finished with them yet, and we had to tell him to put them back. The host even came over to tell us he needed the table.

The favorites were the pierogies, the muffins, and the buttermilk biscuit sliders. The pierogies were soft little pillows of love served with sweet caramelized onions, sweet and savory. The buttermilk biscuit sliders, were buttermilk biscuits with scrambled eggs and thick cut bacon. The biscuits were fluffy and crumbly, the scrambled eggs soft and perfectly cooked, and the bacon was smoky and delicious. The mini muffins were not too sweet, perfect little pumpkiny bites, with a tender crumb.  I didn't try any of the lobster dishes, not because I didn't want to, but because I was actually eating with other people and trying to restrain myself. I heard they were all good, and that the lobster was very fresh and tender. The red snapper tacos were a disappointment, as the fish was chopped up very small so that it hardly tasted like fish anymore. They were also incredibly bland. The chicken taquitos tasted like standard taquitos. They were good, but nothing to phone home about. The pork tostones we actually got on the house, which was really nice. The shredded pork was served atop a cracker like plantain. I thought the pork was a bit dry, but it was still a nice gesture.

Food was brought to us in 5 mins, which you would think that was sign of good service.  Well, no! We ordered three dishes and they were brought out at once.  Of course it didn't take us too long to finish up.  Then our waitress came by asking us if we wanted any dessert.  Hello! we are still having our drink!  You can't ask customer to go straight to dessert while they are only here for 20 mins!  Then after 5 mins another waiter came by and tried to take away our plates. We told him that we were good for now but may order some more later.  But he seems more like okay you guys either to order now or leave.  Can't we just have some quiet moment to enjoy some drink?  I feel like they really want to rush ppl out of door if you are not ordering enough food.  Hey, it was just 6pm and so many tables were still empty! We went to Beauty and Essex before and enjoyed it much more than staton social.  Staton Social fell way under our expectation from different perspectives-  the decor, crowd and service.  Maybe it is the time to move onto somewhere more fun and welcoming.

4.0,11/26/2013,"I've been here many, many times over the years and Stanton Social has not lost its luster, and people seem to know it. The place is still incredibly popular, especially for large groups. Dining here on a normal evening is fantastic, but I do want to highlight their amazing group deals (for parties). You will notice that bachelorette or birthday parties seem to be VERY popular here. That is because they offer an incredible deal - especially this being NYC--they allow you to pick a bunch of menu items and offer a fixed price all-you-can-drink deal for large parties for about $130 a head maybe AFTER tip-- which I think in our case was only because we were paying for the guest of honor. When I say it was incredible amounts of food, it was almost criminal how much we left behind. SO much food- it never seemed to stop coming. And unlimited cocktails? YES PLEASE! They didn't try to skimp, either. The waitress dedicated to our table (actually, many people seemed to be dedicated to serving us) constantly checked in to make sure we had plenty of drinks in hand, and didn't need anything else. So hard to do with a large party. And the food itself? Creative and inspired. The French onion soup bites are a must, as are the donuts at the end. Also love their tacos---and that Mac n Cheese? Sinful but delish! Also be aware this is a shared plate kind of place, so be prepared to forego selfish plate domination behaviors ;-). Or order two! Another note: be sure to make reservations way ahead of time for weekend evenings. At least 7-10 days in advance but call the morning of if you don't like your reservation time. In many cases, they get day-of cancellations during their busy/popular hours (7:30-9:30).",1,0,1,Stephanie H.,"Mount Pleasant, SC",279,339,328

1.0,11/25/2013,"I've eaten here many times and always had a good experience. This past Saturday night was by far the most absurd and deplorable experience I have had at any restaurant by far.Long story short, the host/manager was verbally abusive to all of the customers, including the 8 members in my party.  He threatened one person in my party that he was going to be extremely rude to him if he didn't step away from the host desk. He refused to seat us; kept telling us he'd prefer to seat other parties because we were pissing him off. This is after an hour-they made us wait an hour for our table and then threatened not to seat us because we were asking when our table would be ready? One member of my party had enough and screamed at him for his attitude and incorrigible client service. The host was terrified of this kid and brought a bouncer over to protect him. After we pleaded to be seated, he still refused to seat us and kicked us all out---rather, he had his bouncer/protector escort us out because he was terrified that someone was going to hurt him. I've eaten at the finest restaurants in the city--even McDonalds, never have I experienced anything like this. Isn't the job of the host or restaurant manager to please his customers and apologize for long waits? Apparently not. Apparently this man felt that verbally abusing his patrons was the correct way to ensure superior client service. The food at Stanton Social is usually great--this is not fine dining.

We went with 5 savory and then had the carmelized banana pancakes come out at the end as ""dessert,"" which worked perfectly.Unfortunately, the restaurant is just a little too loud and crowded, and the service is a bit slow, which makes the restaurant a 4-star instead of a 5-star.

1.0,11/5/2013,"I rarely ever write negative Yelp reviews, but The Stanton Social still stands out in the worst ways months after my attempted visit... so I think it deserves a review. Disclaimer: this place is more like a rowdy, snobby club (at least on a Friday night) than it is a fine-dining restaurant or a cute tapas bar. So don't come here expecting an intimate type of setting -- unless by ""intimate"" you mean literally pushing, squeezing, and shoving the huge crowd gathered around the front of the restaurant to find the over stressed and overwhelmed, yet careless and snotty hostess. Let me explain: Not one, but at least two or three different waitresses and hostesses gathered upfront at different times over almost a two hour period, who only acknowledged European white boys or to a lesser extent, club-attired (i.e. revealing clothed) white girls (so yes, dress fancy or at least, non-conservative)...everyone else, you'll have a particularly hard time getting her attention to enter -- even if you've made a reservation. She condescendingly eyed me, stared me down, with a curt, snappy retort and acted as if I was the impatient rude one when I've been politely standing next to her for at least 30 minutes while she ignored me (among some others). I am not exaggerating, and the moment the friend who I was meeting up with went inside to see if she could be more effective (as in, finally get her attention or whatnot), she realized what I meant, and we left. A LOT of girls and couples were leaving, especially once they realized how rude the workers were...some of us just glancing each other in misery before leaving. Honestly, reservations mean NOTHING here...they'll call you beforehand to confirm, and tell you to be on time, and you'll think oh wow, this must mean they will actually take into account a reservation and go by it...but NO, once you finally get a hold of the hostess and yell over the noise, you realize she's sending you upstairs to the dingy (and yes, crowded to the brim so that you're dangling off the stairs) bar. What's the point of a reservation if you overbook and make would-be customers wait for over an hour? It's a really flawed, frustrating system.Anyway, I was really excited to try this place after my mom had seen it on TV and wanted me to take photos of the tiny dishes...but that's not something I'll be doing any time soon...in fact, don't bother attempting photos during dinner because it is again, like a club, dark inside.",0,0,0,Tiffany L.,"Oakland, CA",25,183,14

Okay, maybe not that far, but I did walk here all the way from the upper east side just to try the famed French Onion Soup dumplings. I also waited outside for about 45 minutes until they opened just to try the famed French Onion Soup dumplings. I hoped these stinkin' dumplings were worth the effort. Spoiler alert: they were. I got inside and the decor was absolutely stunning. It's totally the upscale-looking place I would take my wife to enjoy dinner and drinks, or sit around having cocktails with friends. Unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity to explore the menu. I ordered one cocktail, which was tasty, and those dumplings. I sat at the bar. Everyone was getting ready for a major party downstairs in the lounge/restaurant area, but the upstairs bar was open for business. At 5 p.m. on a Thursday, I was the only person there, and not really concerned about it. I was on a mission and dumplings was its name. The bartender was friendly, and knew I was a little out of place. This isn't the place you really hang out by yourself, and my clothes didn't really match the upscale chic look of the establishment either. I was in grubby tourst mode and don't even want to tell you what I had on. The dumplings took about 15 minutes to come out, which gave me time to relax and catch my breath. Bubbling with hot melted cheese, each one explodes in your mouth with delicious flavor. They aren't soupy, tho. They're just the right combination of liquid and texture. The saltiness mixes well with the sweetness of the onions. In a word? Delicious. I would absolutely return, bring friends, and nicer clothes. I am certain the rest of the menu is equally delicious as those dumplings.",4,2,2,Grant P.,"Downers Grove, IL",279,539,244

2.0,10/21/2013,"Nothing that I am going to write here is probably going to sway anyone's opinion about this place.  However, it really is not what it used to be.Upon arriving at the restaurant, my party and I were greeted by a hostess with a ton of attitude.  One I guess has to expect this type of nonsense from ""hip"" (insert sarcasm) restaurants like the Stanton Social, but I wanted to simply beat the young woman with the stick that was lodged up her......well I digress.Despite having arrived promptly with a reservation, my party and I were seated upstairs.  A warning to anyone making a reservation here, you do NOT want to sit upstairs.  Downstairs is a beautiful space, but the upstairs is a loud, crowded, dank bar (picture Dante's 9th ring of hell), which is nothing like the downstairs dining room at all. It's a space filled with wannabees or those waiting for a table in the real restaurant.  If your name is Tony and you're looking for an easy time with a gal with low self esteem and daddy issues, then hit this bar up!Now back to my dining experience.  My party (a table for four) was packed like sardines into a table more adequate for a party of two.  There were two very loud bachelorette parties going on in our same area (at least two tables of ten ladies.....I use that term very loosely).  From the looks of them, I would say that they hailed from Jersey.  Yes....this place reeked of bridge and tunnel.  Despite the horrific setting, we were there for the food....right?  Ugggh.  The much hailed french onion soup dumplings were salty and downright unpleasant.  In fact, all of the food was overly salted.  We also had the mac and cheese (yawn), the meatballs (not bad), the ribs (decent), and the shrimp with grits (a miss).  We had a couple of other dishes, but they were not memorable enough to describe here.In terms of service, our server was very pleasant, which was probably one of the only nice things that I can share about this restaurant.  However, the bus staff were pretty abrupt, slamming into our chairs constantly as they tried to maneuver through the maze of packed tables.  One bus boy actually spilled the dessert from another table on one of my guests while he was clearing the table next to us.  He did not even apologize.  Nice.When our dinner was over, the manager asked us to vacate our table as he said someone else was waiting for it.  Normally, I would have told him to go pound sand, but I really wanted to get the hell out this place as it was so awful.  That being said, he did offer us a round of free drinks at the bar.  Against my better judgment we stayed a while longer.  The bar area was filled with big hair, cheap perfume, spandex, and loud voices peppered with accents from the outer boroughs.  It all just became too much, and we decided to finally head to our next destination.This place is living off of a reputation that it deservedly earned many moons ago.  Now it is simply milking those stupid enough to actually spend their time and money here.  Seriously, try some place else.....any other place would be better than the Stanton Social..YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!!",0,1,0,Tim S.,"New York, NY",3,100,0

The whole i'm-too-cool LES vibe wasn't doing it for me - i mean after all, they are known for their food, right?eh.french onion soup dumplings were clearly just put into the oven for a long time. The crouton was soggy, and the texture of the dumpling was hard, chewy, and just not that good. Goat cheese and potato pierogies were pretty good. Without the goat cheese dip, the dish would've been mediocre. But good thing I dig goat cheese, I guess.Chicken N Waffles - it was whatever. They did a play on this dish by serving roasted chicken with reduced balsamic (i think) and cut pieces of waffles. Waffle was too chewy, and I don't think you can really mess up the chicken thighs at this level of culinary. ( or shouldn't at least)Red snapper tacos - it's just fish tacos. except they give you three tiny bite sized tacos. They even took the plate right away before we got the chance to try the sauce that came with it. Great job!Stanton mac n cheese- by far the best dish of the night. no complaints. great texture and well cooked. But it's mac n cheese. seriously?drinks were strong and fairly tasty, but with a hefty price of $13. Tapas are supposed to be fun for sharing and trying out many signature dishes in smaller sizes.

After running down the streets and talking to other cabbies to try and get in touch with ours, it was a lost cause. We had to push back our ressi because of this, so I guess the hostess had notified the manager of our predicament, because the second we sat down, he came over with champagne and appetizers for our whole table. He apologized for what had happened to us and hoped this may help turn the night around. CLASSY PLACE!!!! and they weren't the cheap apps either - red snapper tacos and the goat cheese pierogis that are one of the highest selling dishes. We couldn't get over how sweet that was of them, and it certainly helped the very sour mood we were all in. We ordered many other dishes and all of them were fabulous.

Request a booth seat if you're making reservations! Service was fine except it took them a long time to get us water but maybe it just felt long because I was dying of thirst. Also our waitress came by and asked if we were still waiting for more food after only receiving 2 of our 5 dishes. Umm shouldn't she know? We ordered the salad (it didn't list any meat on it but I think there was bacon in the dressing!!! they should note stuff like this), ahi tacos, red snapper tacos, french onion soup dumplings, and miso mushrooms. I THINK that was all of it. The salad was amazing, the tacos were both very similar to each other and nothing special. The soup dumplings were very unique! I was so full already though and couldn't eat more than one. They are super heavy! The mushrooms are solid but not worth the $8.

What was good but not great was the spaghetti carbonara (though it did come in cute little single serve ""nests"" which was cool) and the pizza (not much flavor here) Everything excpt the burgers came with just enough portions for the number of people at your table so you never had to fight anyone for the last anything.

On a Wednesday night around 6:30, I took my Mother and two friends to the Stanton Social for dinner. It was completely empty, and we were seated pretty much immediately. Our waiter come over to take our drink orders - at the time we were still waiting for one of my friends to show up, but were looking at the menu and trying to have a conversation. The music was extremely loud, and even though we were sitting at a small table, we could barely hear each other. We placed our drink orders, and asked the waiter if he could please ask the manager to turn the music down a bit since it was so loud. As we waited for our drinks, my other friend showed up. The waiter came back to ask for her drink order. My mother mentioned to him that it seemed like the music had not be turned down, and had he happened to mention the request yet to the manager. His reply was ""Yes, but I am not going to bother him/ask again, as he has gone into his office and closed the door."" In a tone that was kind of snippy.We all kind of looked at each other in surprise. I don't think I have ever been spoken to like that at a restaurant, or had a manager pretty much ignore a customer's request. Especially since the place was empty, and we were pretty much the only party there. (I have worked in the food industry, and I know that any manager that I have worked for would have turned down the music a little bit had there been a request to do so)My Mother politely asked him if he could ask again, as it really was difficult to hold a conversation. He went off to ask, and shortly came back with this reply - ""He said that he was not going to turn down the music as it was going to get busy soon and then it would just get loud again."" We were all surprised at that comment, and were kind of looking at each other in amazement. We started to wonder if we should just get drinks and then go have dinner elsewhere. The waiter was still standing at the table, and said in a bit of a condescending tone "" Are you sure you still want your drinks?"". Well, after that, we just pretty much looked at him, looked at each other, and then said NO. Actually. We do not.

5.0,9/26/2013,We had my wife's 40th I mean.....30th birthday here.  The place is wonderful.  I wish the staff at every restaurant was as accommodating as they are at the Stanton.  We had a two hour open bar in the upstairs lounge with passed hors d'oeuvres.At first they were a little understaffed for the wave of people coming in for the party.  One comment to the manager and they added a bus person and a bartender and things started to flow wonderfully.  They even added a half hour to our open bar for the inconvenience.  The apps were great.  My favorite was the ahi tuna poke and the sliders.  My wife loved the french onion soup dumplings.  They never stopped passing the apps and everyone was stuffed.  It was a very good time and my wife enjoyed her party immensely. I can't wait to come back for dinner.,2,1,2,Marc N.,"East Brunswick, NJ",150,219,151
5.0,9/26/2013,I really liked this place and it was really hyped up for me both food and drink hype and it lived up to the hype. We had fos dumplings which is what first made me aware of this place and they truly were awesome. Also arepas served in bite size portions clams and snapper tacos which were also both delicious. We stuck with simple drinks but apparently they're specialty drinks are pretty interesting as well. We got there just as the doors were opening on a Tuesday literally the first customers so we really got a good look at the place. We went upstairs as well and sat at the bar.  The bartender was very nice and accommodating as well. I will definitely be back when I'm on the LES.,1,0,0,Scott P.,"Belmar, NJ",5,116,28

5.0,9/19/2013,"Went with a friend as a first proper dinner outing when I moved to NYC. Here are the deets:- Location: Chic yet low key ambiance done by the fantastic design group AvroKO, with more of a darker masculine feel. Excellent for dates. Table's are ridiculously close to each other, but once you start to converse with your dinner partner(s), you completely forget about those around you.- Service: Our waiter was nice, informative, and to the point with everything. No lingering, but no lack of service; everything was just right.- Food: Since this is more of a small plate tasting kind of restaurant (read: ""tapas"" style), we got: the French Onion Soup Dumplings [so different and so good, awesome comfort food], Spicy Lamb Souvlakis [great taste, but nothing different from any other good Greek spot], Fava Bean & Ricotta Ravioli [clean, earthy, and scrumptiously neutralizing after the lamb], and finally, the winner of them all - the Sriracha Pea Crusted Salmon [a ballad of eclectically savory tastes without any fishy after taste] We topped it off with the Bourbon Peach Cobbler sundae, which was one of the best desserts I've ever had!- Summation: The beauty of small plate tasting places is that you can dabble in so many different flavors, and that's exactly what was awesome about Stanton Social.

For 6, they recommend around 8 tapas dishes. We ended up getting 11 plates and 4 us of us got drinks and still the price came out so reasonable for such amazing flavors for every single dish!We ordered:*Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies- dipped in truffle creme fresh, one of the more popular dishes. the creme fresh just dissolves in your mouth, like a marshmallow, flavor is superb.*Smoked Duck and Baby Kale Salad- came with truffle-goat cheese croutons, which were pretty much just fried goat cheese balls, but nevertheless delicious*Red Snapper Tacos- not blown away, order this if you're still hungry at the end.*Mushroom & Fontina Quesadilla - with jalapeno avocado dip, quite small but w/ a sumptuous burst of flavor*lobster roll - very mediocre as far as lobster rolls go.. I'd suggest other slider choices.*social mac n cheese- so rich but still delicious, just don't eat the whole thing or you definitely will be rolling out of the restaurant later.*tomato pizetta with roasted garlic and chili oil- I love everything with garlic, and this definitely went beyond your typical flatbread pizza. Great garlic burst of flavor!*miso glazed mushrooms - we needed to add some more veggies, so got this yummy side of mushrooms. The glaze was a bit oily, but still delicious.For drink, I got the basil-lime gimlet. A great refreshing drink that didn't overpower any of the dishes.

This restaurant is tapas style, which is great; a little bit of everything. So that means YAY you can order half the menu! But 9 out of the 10 items I ordered wasn't good. It was overly salty.

We couldn't move due it being busy.That said, we sucked it up and ordered a shitload of tapas.Kobe beef sliders- good but not awesome. Expected better but damn good. Edamame- good taste, pretty good. Loved the glaze.Potato and goat cheese pierogies- the best item of the night. Ordered an additional order. Amazingly light which is atypical of pierogies.French Onion Soup dumplings- a little disappointing. The dumpling was thick and doughy and there wasn't much French onion broth.

Sign that you got to go :( best that I would appreciate a better experience next time we go. Food wise is really good. Well I can't really comment much as tapa isn't really what I eat in general. Beside the fact it was served in order and never together with the previous dish make this experience unique. Portion is really small for the price but hey that class I guess. Again, this place has 2 section.

Everything was delicious and we of course tried a couple of their signature mimosas which were also delicious. The plates were shared amongst three and it was the perfect amount. I didn't feel too stuffed or hungry when I left. Service was phenomenal and great atmosphere. I would suggest making a reservation here.

4.0,9/7/2013,"When my friends and I were thinking where to go for one of their birthdays, I offered up Stanton as a possible option. Stanton stands out as one of the new luxe establishments popping up across the formerly grungy areas of the Lower East Side. A bilevel restaurant-bar-lounge, it's sleek and sexy. For our victuals, we ordered the spicy lobster benedict, chicken n' waffles, chicken taquitos, french onion soup dumplings, lamb souvlakis, ricotta fritters, and caramelized banana pancakes. I will start by saying that one must prepare themselves to order a good chunk of the brunch menu if they seek physical fulfillment from Stanton; the portions are quite small. The benedict was delicious (especially the accompanying spinach); the lobster was fresh and perfectly prepared. The chicken n' waffles was just ok; the flavors were all there waiting to let out cries of exuberance that were, unfortunately, stifled by the lack of texture as both the chicken and the waffle were far too soggy. The ""taquitos"" should be renamed to ""one long taquito."" I thought it was far too ridiculous what Stanton charges for something that could be put in the microwave and cut up into five bits to be shared. Admittedly, the flavors were better than a market brand alternative, but for $12 I think it would have been only far to AT LEAST serve two taquitos to make the dish worthy of its name. The dumplings were amazing and I'm not even a huge fan of french onion soup; the deliciously moist bread dumpling mixed with the sweetness of the broth and the savory cheese globs makes this dish a decadent luxury. The lamb souvlaki was the star of the meal; though one of the more simpler dishes that Stanton offers, it is one of THE best plates of lamb I have ever had. For our ""dessert,"" we enjoyed the zesty lemon-flavored ricotta fritters which, although tasty, were a bit more battered than expected. The pancakes were also delicious, especially when you consume them with the candied blackberries that join the flapjacks! Employing the use of intimately dark incandescent lighting, low-lit candles, bronze leather booths, and dark wood tables all amidst stark white brick walls, Stanton offers a cavernous, yet sumptuous, atmosphere that makes ravaging the tapas selections and day drinking perfectly permissible, if not a bit mischievous.",0,0,0,Jonathan L.,"New York, NY",166,118,95

The food is tapas style so you order small plates to share with your group. Keep in mind, some of the orders come in 3's or 6's which makes being in a group of 4 a bit awkward. However, they do offer to add another item so there is one per person charged ""a la carte"". Have the Pierogies. They are to die for. For dessert: don't skip the Creme brûlée. It is DELICIOUS. It is obvious that everything about every single item on the plate has been well-thought-out. Which I appreciate. There's definitely a lot of meticulous care that goes into the food, which is part of what makes it so enjoyable. The service was good however I felt strange tipping our waitress, when another man was bringing all the dishes. All our waitress had really done was explain the menu, take our order and ask how everything was going. I hope they share their tips. Be prepared to spend a bit. My party of 4 totaled a bill of $144.

Could be worse for the price of $13 I supposeWe tried to get a little bit of everything for our tapas, and they really ranged:Duck & Kale Salad (5/5): really refreshing, an explosion of different flavors that all worked very well together--great as a starter. I usually hate kaleKobe Beef Sliders (4/5): we ordered them rare, but they were medium rare #carnivoreproblems. but very flavorful and meat was tenderFrench Onion Soup Dumplings  (3/5): the biggest disappointment of the bunch--having had real xiaolongbao many times, we were expecting much more soup in the dumpling. they were dry and also were difficult to get out of the holderChicken n Waffles (3/5): I didn't even realize these were the chicken and waffles until I was counting off everything we had ordered. nothing too memorable about it; waffle was a bit too doughy and not crispy enough. chicken was lightly seasoned, and it had a syrupy sauceRibs (4.5/5): meat is pertty much coming off the bone tender, and the salad on top helps cleanse your palate and balances out the flavor nicely. I thought it could've been a tad bit lighter on the sauce though.90 Proof Milkshake Shot (5/5): not too sweet, quite rich, but not too creamy, and just a hint of the bourbon taste, and tastes more of the caramel.

If we were not as skinny as we are we wouldn't have been able to access our table! I took the seat on the sofa and despite my long skinny legs I had trouble seating! Drinks: I ordered the 1940s Champagne Julep. $13 for a champagne glass halfway full of ice? No thank you! It had nothing special or good to remember.

I was thinking that I should've ordered the Basil-Lime Gimlet, which most people were having, but hey we got free shots.

Kobe Beef Burger: (B+) Nothing memorable. Chicken and waffles: (A) good flavor and tender chicken. Desserts:S'mores Crème Brulèe. (A) It comes in tree different cups. Great for sharing.

It's incredible smooth and just fabulous. We were considering ordering a second round of this!2. Chicken arepas: 3.75/5: Pretty good. A good heap of shredded chicken that was flavorful but not out of this world good. 3. Crab Cake Corn Dogs: 2/5: Disappointment! There was so much potential here, but unfortunately, it tasted mostly like the corn cake and not much crab. definitely could pass on this. 4. Lamb soulvakis: 4.25/5: Surprisingly good! Didn't think it would be as good as it was. Almost like a taco with a good amount of meat that's nicely flavored and spiced. I would definitely recommend this, especially if you like lamb!5. Ahi Tuna Poke: 4/5: This was really good. Chopped up pieces of ahi tuna on a crispy wonton. Would def get this again. 6. Popcorn Shrimp: 3/5: You get a good amount of shrimp, but unfortunately, they were a tad salty on the outside. Otherwise, they were very crispy. I would have preferred a spicier dipping sauce, though. 7. Chicken n Waffles: 1/5: YES YOU READ THAT CORRECTLY! 1/5! THIS WAS THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE NIGHT. The chicken wasn't fried. And it was almost crunchy in a way you don't want chicken to be because its borderline raw. And the waffle was totally soggy and didn't have any flavor. The sauce was also equally depressing. do not get this!!!!8. Herbed Fries: 4/5: but then again, can you really mess up fried potatoes? I would suggest getting this earlier in the night, though.9. baked spanikopita: 3/5: i could've passed on this dish, but maybe its because i am not the biggest spanikopita fan. I thought it lacked salt, but it may have been because the shrimp I was also eating at the time were too salty. 10. Doughnuts: 4/5: We were so stuffed but still managed to sneak in room for dessert. They're fluffy and light and made for the perfect ending to our meal. I'm a huge chocolate fan, but thought the caramal dipping sauce was the best. Overall, we all had  great impression of this place. We ordered 5-6 drinks and paid roughly $65/person. Definitely on the pricier side, however, it was nice place to celebrate something special! Plus coming with 4+ people really allows you to sample the menu!",1,0,1,Asmita J.,"Philadelphia, PA",235,567,2
4.0,8/16/2013,"So I've been here 4-5 times, I think Chef Chris Stantos has done a great job with this place. It's always packed and there is always a wait, but it's always worth it. Yes this place is loud, also the decor is very modern and trendy. Best way to describe the meal, it's basically global Tapas.The Food:Chicken N' Waffles- Brick pressed chicken, aged cheddar waffle, corn pudding, balsamic spiked maple syrup. This is not what you normally think of when you think of Chicken and waffles, but I really like the one here. I really enjoyed the chicken, it was so moist and flavorful, the corn was a weird/good addition but the balsamic takes it over the top for me.The Stanton Social Beef Wellington- Grilled Filet Mignon, Foie Gras Mousse and mushrooms wrapped in puff pastry. This is another great dish but some might find the slight livery taste to be off putting. I like this dish so much since I love every element of the dish. The filet, the foie gras, mushroom and puff pastry all work to make a great dish. yelp.com/user_local_phot… French Onion Soup Dumplings- This dish is very unique and I enjoyed the flavor. Also, it is so freakin hot when it's served, so wait a few minutes, it's served on those escargots dishes. It's a dumpling with french onion soup with a crouton on top with melted cheese covering the entire dish. The soup is nice and hearty and has a touch of sweetness, the cheese that blankets the top is excellent, it's like a really chewy Swiss cheese. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Kobe Philly- I don't know why I liked this dish so much, it was also barely the size of a hot dog bun, so don't expect to get full. The truffle and goat cheese fondue are excellent with the beef, it's only a few bites but they are a very good few bites.Red Snapper Tacos- Creamy avocado, spicy mango. I was kinda surprised how much I liked this dish. The Snapper had a nice pronounced flavor and the avo and mango paired well, my only issue was the dish was extremely small.Warm Doughnuts- This dish, depending who you ask, is either good or wet dream good. I think it's just good, it's fresh made doughnuts with sprinkled sugar and caramel sauce, raspberry sauce and chocolate dipping sauce.",2,2,2,Ben L.,"Queens, NY",978,1001,2785
4.0,8/16/2013,"The restaurant is situated in the popular Lower East Side neighborhood and pretty easy to find. It's generally considered a ""hot spot"" and gets pretty busy after 7. The downside is that there have been occassions where my meal has felt rushed; they definitely like to move things along. The bar scene is generally okay, but not as impressive as one might think. The crowd tends to be younger-- 20s and early 30s.The menu consists of small plates, basically tapas, that two people can share. Their menu is expansive-- examples include fish tacos, their iconic french soup dumplings (excellent), duck salad, sliders, chorizo and poblano mac and cheese (excellent as well), arepas with pulled chicken and a sun-dried tomato pizette. The quality of their food is very good. Overall, a good choice; I would suggest capping dinner off with tasty ice cream from the Big Gay Ice Cream shop.",0,0,0,Jennifer B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,87,3

Somehow, we ended up being too full for dessert (pretty remarkable considering the size of tapas) so the dumplings were our most awaited dish. I just didn't like the combination of the sweet sauteed onions and the gruyere. Unpopular opinion here, sorry.As for the other dishes, I am a native New England-er and the lobster rolls were miniature sized disappointments. I felt like I was doing my background a disservice by ordering a single tiny, itty bitty roll for the price of a full one at home. Even worse, it was filled with mayo, celery, and other seasonings that do NOT belong on lobster rolls.Potato and goat cheese pierogi... also nothing to write home about. I actually forgot we even tried it when writing this review!The restaurant is beautifully decorated if that means anything. At the beginning of our meal they also gave us some white gazpacho on the house. A great touch but I'm not crazy about gazpacho in the first place. Overall, I'd save my money.

1.0,8/10/2013,"I came here for my sister's birthday with a group of her friends.  Every time we asked about the reservation, the hostesses told us the table was being prepared for us, which was clearly a lie.  They also said that they could not give us an estimated time of seating. Finally, after waiting forty-five minutes for a table, we asked for the manager, who was incredibly rude and condescending. If management budgeted more time per reservation (e.g. assumed that each party would take one and a half hours instead of one hour), this backlog could be easily averted without adversely affecting business. Maybe it is a purposeful move to make the restaurant appear busier or more exclusive than it actually is.

3.0,7/25/2013,"Rather disappointing after all the hype about this place.1) lady at the front wouldn't seat us until everyone in the party arrived- wtf? That is just plain rude when you've made a reservation already, not to mention that we also said that we will start ordering appetizers and drinks immediately. But no. Personally I find that one of the most unreasonable policies especially for a restaurant that's more of a place for socializing than eating. It is meant for groups, and as common sense and logic dictate, the bigger the group is the more likely it is that people won't be arriving at the same time. Had to wait for 20 min until friend arrived and consequently got seated. 2) I am not a misogynist but this place srsly has way too many women. It should be called Sorority Palace or something.. no joke. It might have been just that particular Friday me and my (female- ha!) friends went, but I am pretty sure 80% of the clientele consisted of groups of girls. 3) Food was okay. I liked the shareable approach of the menu, but the food themselves were really just very ordinary. We had a group of 6 people and thus could pretty much get a small taste of everything. Nothing was bad, nor extraordinary. Place was also too loud for any real culinary experience/revelation to happen.The only upside is that they make great cocktails, and gives you a good opportunity to dress up as everyone in there looked great.",0,1,0,Jasmine C.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",72,60,53

The place was PACKED and the probably the noisiest restaurant I've ever been in in my life--seriously.  Wouldn't have been a big deal except for the fact that we were meeting a friend that we hadn't seen in years.  So it was going to be a big talking dinner.  Not the kind of place you want to catch up with an old friend.  Last time I came here, it was like a 5:00 PM reservation, I remember it was quiet and subdued.  A much nicer memory.  I must be getting old.Here's what we ordered.PEROGIES--Nice.  Filled with potatoes and goat cheese.  Recommended.TUNA TARTAR--Tiny but tasty. Recommended.PHILLY SLIDER--They were out of the big seller, the Kobe Beef Slider.  But the Philly was still decent, but go with the Kobe Beef Slider.FRENCH ONION SLIDERS--The signature dish of this place.  This dish was featured on the Food TV show ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate"".  If you come here, you really *have* to order this.

We ended up ordering 12 dishes and boy were we stuffed!French Onion Soup Dumplings - I was excited to try this out since everyone recommended it on  yelp but when I had it, it wasn't what I expected. It was too salty and I did not enjoy it one bit.Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogi - DISGUSTING! Again, I ordered this because of the rave on yelp and because our waitress told us it was one of their most popular dishes. I'm sorry but I couldn't take a second bite of this. I took one bite of this and had to rinse my mouth with water/cocktail and the taste of the goat cheese was still there. So if you're not a fan of goat cheese, do not order this! :(Chicken & Waffles - Comes in an order of 4 or 8. I didn't get to try this out because i was too stuffed by the time it came. I'm assuming it was good because it was gone in 2 minutes! Red Snapper Tacos - I liked this but couldn't really taste the fish.Spinach & Corn Salad - I liked this very much. Their dressing was delicious and that bit of spiciness to it definitely helped. Kobe Sliders & Lobster Slider - I liked the kobe slider, it was cooked very nicely and my friends enjoyed it as well. As for the lobster roll, I did not like it one bit. The lobster were  under dressed and it was bland. Popcorn Shrimp - Shrimp was cripsy and delicious. The spicy mayo dipping sauce was delicious as well. Mac & Cheese - YUMMY! We finished the whole dish within 5 minutes and this was when we were so full that our belles are about to pop!Ribs - Comes in an order of 5-6 Ribs. The meat was tender and the flavor was good. We couldn't finish it though because we were stuffed so we took the rest to go.Meatballs - HUGE meatballs on top of ravioli.

We ordered the Essex Street Pickles, Red Snapper Tacos, and Herb-dusted Frites from the gluten-free menu. Our waitress came back a few minutes later, saying that it was probably not safe for our friend to eat the Red Snapper Tacos and frites because they were fried in the same fryer as other items not listed on the special menu. So, pretty much, their gluten-free menu was pointless. They replaced her items with a salmon salad, but still charged us for it.

I'll keep it simple:The Amuse Bouche - Cucumber Gazpacho was awesome and I'm going to try to recreate it very soon. Lovely shot of cooling cucumber with a slightly spicy kick. Our menu selections: 1. Smoked Duck & Kale Salad 5/5 --- Unexpectedly fabulous. The little goat cheese croutons and roasted beets were positively delicious. The only way this could be better would have been a little more duck.  2. French Onion Soup Dumplings 4/5 --- Gooey cheese, braised onions stuffed into a wrapper and baked. What could go wrong? Well, they were a little difficult to eat. Might have worked better if they were baked in individual spoons.3. Miso/Pea Salmon 5/5 - Best salmon I've ever had. Ever.4. Short Rib Tacos 3/5 - Found them to be a little boring. Little bland. 5. Spaghetti Carbonara 2/5 - Sigh. My heart breaks writing this. I wanted to love it but the pasta was woefully overcooked, sticky, and cold. The quail egg was overcooked as well. The pork belly was delicious and it's only saving grace.The service excellent, environment, stellar. The pricing was fair and pretty reasonable, all things considered. It was a little bit ""sceney"" but what do you expect? I'll be back... we didn't get the kobe beef sliders and I'm sure there's one with my name on it.",0,0,0,Tara C.,"New Westminster, Canada",46,316,16
5.0,7/3/2013,"The best meal I have had in a long time. I absolutely loved every single thing we ordered. I made reservations at 8.30 to meet a couple of friends who were visiting from California. Due to the crappy weather, we only made it there by 9:00. The host just ignored us for about a couple of minutes but was nice enough to offer us a table in 30 minutes while we waited at the bar upstairs. The drinks are decent, a little too sweet for my liking. Watermelon margarita is very refreshing and the Jalapeno in the blood orange Margarita makes its presence felt.    Now coming to my favorite part of the night ""FOOD"". I had a quick roll to eat after work so was planning on keeping it light ( Which was tossed out of the window as soon as I saw the menu) The red snapper tacos  were probably my least favorite of the night. They were good but I didn't like the distinctive fishy smell  that lingered. The french onion dumpling soup  is out of this world. I could eat it all day long. Spicy lamb souvlakis were yummy, crisp and accompanied with some fantastic sauce. How can anyone make potato and cheese this good? Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies is the other must eat here. Weirdly enough, I mentioned SS to a friend who lived in the city 4 years ago and she still remembered these Pierogies very fondly (I admire consistency) .The Mushroom & Fontina Quesadilla  and Pizetta were mainly for a vegetarian friend who really enjoyed it.Desert time. Did I mention earlier that I wanted to keep the dinner light? We just wanted to take a quick peak at the menu and not get anything. ( Who am i kidding?) We ended up ordering warm donuts which was highly recommended by our host. It was accompanied by caramel, chocolate and raspberry sauce .It was good( raspberry sauce was my least favorite)  but what blew me was the creme brulee. Yummy yummy yummy. It comes in three little cups, perfect for three of us. I am definitely coming back here .......soon.",0,0,0,Deepti N.,"New York, NY",3,49,0

4.0,6/30/2013,"The bee's hive of Lower East Side chic, The Stanton Social (yes, for a place like this, the ""the"" is indispensable) is just too hip to not seem a bit pretentious. I came here on two very different occasions. The first time was a Friday night dinner with the BF. Reservations were easy enough to make and I had no trouble changing the time of my reservation even a few hours beforehand, but we still ended up waiting about 45 minutes after our 10:30 reservation for our table to be ready. The waiting area is the upstairs bar. I say ""bar"" but it's more like a club/lounge - excessively loud music and scantily dressed girls with fancy cocktails in hand. On the weekends, the upstairs area is probably perfect for a ladies' night out, but it's not really my type of scene so I was glad when we were finally ushered downstairs.The dining style is small plates so the waitress recommended about 2-3 items per person. I ordered the red snapper tacos and lobster roll. The tacos were amazing - the fish itself was cooked just right, and the spicy mango and avocado created a wonderful mixture that went really well with the fish. The lobster roll was also delicious. The sauce that the lobster was mixed with was perfect, and the roll managed to be crispy and buttery - amazing!The BF is a vegetarian and unfortunately, there aren't that many vegetarian options on the menu. He ordered the potato & goat cheese pierogies, the baked spanakopita, and the grilled ovendried tomato pizzeta. He doesn't eat anything that's been cooked in a meat broth either so that ruled out the French onion soup dumplings. I had a few bites of his food, and they didn't seem nearly as good as what I had ordered, although he seemed to have enjoyed his meal very much.We also each ordered a cocktail. I had the strawberry fields, which was a tad too sweet for my taste. The BF had the blood orange-jalapeno margarita, which seemed like a daring choice, but it turned out to be pretty good!The second time I was here was for a social event for work. It was a Monday evening so there weren't many people. We sat on the couches in the upstairs lounge area, which was comparably much more pleasant in atmosphere than the Friday night scene. We ordered an assortment of dishes to share and all were good. I finally got to try the French onion soup dumplings that so many Yelpers have recommended and it was indeed quite delicious. We also had these amazing donuts for dessert, and it came with three types of dip - chocolate, caramel, and raspberry. I think the donuts were by consensus the best items of the night.Overall, I'd give 3 stars for my Friday night experience and 5 stars for my Monday evening experience.",0,0,0,Honghui Y.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",84,190,84

TIP: The bar/lounge area also serves the full restaurant menu. Food: Underwhelming. We ordered a bunch of items to share such as the philly cheese sliders, kobe sliders, chicken and waffle, crab cake corn dogs, warm donuts - nothing was memorable. I do want to emphasize my review on the signature French Onion Soup Dumplings, since that was the only thing I thought was interesting on the menu. The dumpling tasted like a giant piece of rubbery dough with french onion soup flavor. Great idea, execution fail.Honestly, I really wish the chef/kitchen puts more thoughts into the food.

4.0,6/25/2013,"While loitering in front of the restaurant, I saw at least six different groups of reasonably attractive to extremely hot girls make their way into Stanton Social in high heels and short party dresses.  When my party arrived, I summarily proclaimed to them that I was a genius in selecting this venue for a joint birthday venture.  Of course, at the time of this declaration, my long suffering girlfriend was around the corner buying Pepcid AC in preparation for a long night of carousing - which was unfortunately abbreviated by my Irish exit at VU bar around midnight - but that is neither here nor there.Similar to its sister property, Beauty and Essex, Stanton Social is a posh representative of glam Manhattan replete with dark, gothic interiors and requisite good looking gay host at the front desk.  In addition, the wait staff was attentive, drinks were stiff but toothsome and the food was solid.  This was especially impressive as we were drawing off of a mandatory large party menu which was more than reasonably priced.  I think in the end, everyone left stuffed and tipsy for $95 per person all in, which in a high cost-of-living area like NYC is perfectly acceptable.I'm wondering what the LA equivalent would be...",1,2,1,John S.,"Buena Park, CA",1399,543,43
2.0,6/25/2013,"As you can see from researching the rest of their reviews and their website, they serve small plates or tapas. Service is great.The atmosphere is somewhat upscale and trendy. It seems like a nice place to bring a group of friends to have a girls/guys night out over some drinks/food and have playful banter.  Its definitely not quiet but its not overwhelmingly obnoxious where you can't carry a conversation with each other.The food was as expected and nothing more or less.  Some could call the things a gimmick and others would say its the best thing they've ever tried.  In honesty, every item is what it is.  They're small plates to be shared, and the menu descriptions are fittingly so.Chicken and waffles, are exactly that.  Waffles aren't crispy, fluffly or going to blow your mind, nor will the chicken, but its cooked well and the waffles taste like waffles.  The french onion dumplings were a ""fun"" dish, but sometimes I want more soup in the dumpling which would probably create a more ""blow your mind"" sensation but this wasnt the case.  The taste was on point though and its a refreshing interpretation and deconstruction of a familiar dish.Kale & duck salad was good but again, it was just exactly that.  It tasted fine but again it was not ground breaking.  Anyway, you get the idea here with my review.

4.0,6/18/2013,"A friend recommended this tapas restaurant for dinner, so I made reservations for us for my birthday dinner. We arrived a bit early for the 7:15 reservation and were promptly seated upstairs, near the bar area. The server recommended we choose about two dishes per person, but we stuck with five because six or seven dishes would have been way too much.We got:- Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies: caramelized onions, truffle creme fraiche ($9)- Ahi Tuna Poke: crispy wonton, avocado, fresno chili ($15)- Hand Pulled Chicken Arepas: jalapeno salsa verde ($10)- Maryland Jumbo Lump Crabcake 'Corn Dogs' ($13)- 'Chicken n' Waffles': brick pressed chicken, aged cheddar waffle, corn pudding, balsamic spiked maple syrup ($19)The pierogies were deep fried, which was interesting. I thought pierogies are normally boiled potato dumplings. I loved it though. The ahi tuna poke was also delicious. Little mounds of tuna tartare placed upon wonton chips with a slice of chili pepper and a bit of avocado to glue the morsel to the plate. The arepas were also good, though tricky to eat. There was a pile of hand pulled chicken on each arepa, so I essentially started eating half the chicken by itself so the pile wasn't so high. The crabcake corn dogs were probably my least favorite. I didn't see anything that special about them and the corn meal covering was soft and not crispy like a traditional corn dog. The chicken n' waffles were good, though that was my second to least favorite. The chicken alone was not that flavorful -- you definitely needed to coat it a bit with the balsamic syrup. The waffle definitely had the corn taste, but I didn't get too much aged cheddar from it. Service was incredibly fast. I think we were in and out of the place in 35 minutes. Pretty impressive for a restaurant like that. I later found out that we were part of the early dining crew.

3.0,6/16/2013,"Came on a Friday night with 9:30 reservations. As with what seemed to be everyone else, we were told to head upstairs to the bar and grab a drink until our table was ready. A little after 10:00, we managed to get seated. From other reviews here, I guess this is just their practice to send people to the bar and squeeze more out of them, so come with the right set of mind. Beyond that, I can't complain about the service level. Everything was served promptly, and our waitress was pretty regular in checking in on us and being patient. The Stanton features great, trendy decor and fantastic music, the atmosphere is borderline nightclub so I don't recommend this place for an intimate, quiet night out at all. From what I could see all around me, this is the place to be for groups of women having girls' night out. The food is a mixed bag, I'd rate it a 3-3.5 Yelp-wise. We went with the French Onion Soup Dumplings, the Crab Cake Corndogs, the Mac and Cheese, the Chicken and Waffles and the Souvkali. Soup Dumpings - Overhyped;; Loved the cheese melted all over them, but otherwise I don't love French Onion soup anyhow and the chewy texture was not my thing, but I could see people loving it. The Macaroni and Cheese was out of this world, excellent crunchy texture and seasoning and of course rich and served in a small cast iron pan - delicious! The Souvlaki was also excellent, the cuts of lamb were perfect even if the portion size was quite small for this one. The Crab Cake Corn Dogs were a unique twist and I also highly recommend these as part of your tapas picks. The big disappointment was the Chicken and Waffles. The chicken could have been any generic grilled chicken, and it was served on top of soggy, not-so-tasty waffle pieces. This one was a major fail - I'd steer clear of it. Bottom line, this is a great place for a girls' night out where the goal isn't the finest food ever but just some small and creative small plates to get the night started in a trendy atmosphere.",0,0,0,Rahul P.,"Jersey City, NJ",12,115,0

1.0,6/10/2013,"Unimpressed to say the least. Admittedly had high expectations given the multiple star rating on Yelp. When we arrived, three out of six people in our party were present for the reservation so the host sent us to the bar upstairs to wait for the other 3 people. He told us he would come upstairs and get us when our table was ready. Well later we learned he told the remaining members of our party that they should go upstairs too but that we should all come down when we were ready to be seated. So which one is  it mr. Host?  How about you do what you say you are going to do? Particularly do what you say you will to the person that thought this was a good place to eat and made the reservation (me). Furthermore, upon going downstairs to be seated he warned us that another party was set to arrive at 9:15 (which was almost 2 hours after our seating time) and that we would have to leave early potentially in order to accommodate that next party. We took a chance because we figured it could not possibly take more than two hours to eat there. But who does that? Hello? So we ate many small dishes.Many of the food items were delicious! The chef is no doubt good.However, the host put a bad taste in our mouth to start out the evening. Furthermore the wait staff pulled a plate out from underneath me while I was in the middle of chewing on some food off of it. I looked down and the plate was gone.

3.0,5/21/2013,"With a menu and atmosphere you can find in a hundred NYC establishments, The Stanton Social has some amazing dishes and some just short of bad.  It is somewhat pretentious and far less innovative than they probably think they are, so they can't back up the 'tude.  That, combined with the trendy, loud ambiance and mediocre service net out as 3 stars.  Lets start with the good... The best dish has to be the Goat Cheese Pierogies, served crispy and ready to dip in a Truffle Creme Freche.  You have to be careful with truffle oil, and these guys nailed it!The French Onion Soup Dumplings were tasty, but they have an unpleasant aroma that makes the entire place smell like an ice hockey locker room. They more than make up for the aroma in taste and presentation, so if you can get past the smell you're good to go.The Snapper Tacos were tasty. Full of fixing and a good amount of fish, this makes a great start to your meal.  The snapper itself was mild (as snapper should be), so this was light and enjoyable.The Edamame was deeeeelcioso!  It's covered in a fish oil, but don't let that fool you, it does not taste like fish on the least.  It tastes like grilled heaven trapped in a pea pod!But from here, it gets worse.Chicken and Waffles were a nice idea but I found this dish to be poorly executed.  Anyone can fry a chicken wing and put it on top of an Eggo waffle, which is essentially what this was. The Kobe Beef Sliders were good if not run of the mill.  They tasted like any one of a million burgers with nothing to make it stand out.  Boring ingredients, boring presentation, served with boring fries.  The deserts were all overly sweet.  The mousse, the doughnuts, the cookies... None of it was balanced so I can't say I would recommend any of it.  In fact, the doughnuts came with caramel dipping sauce, in case two tablespoons of sugar wasn't sweet enough... You're better off walking up to Little Italy for desert.To elaborate on the ""mediocre service"", we were left waiting for drinks countless times.  It would take 15 minutes to get a beer, and at one point we went to the bar, ordered drinks, brought them back to the table, and finished... BEFORE the waitress brought the round we ordered through her!  Management seemed to care less when we complained, typical of this type of restaurant that cares more about being hip than their service.",1,0,0,Mike F.,"Bridgeport, CT",371,189,14

4.0,5/15/2013,"Came here for dinner before a show at Bowery Ballroom. I actually wasn't expecting much. I thought it was more of a trendy / sceney place vs. a place with really good food. I was pleasantly surprised. The bar upstairs is interesting in that it's pretty separate from the restaurant area. But the space is really nice, and the cocktails are strong and yummy. They were really nice about letting us take our drinks down, but teetering on heels with my martini glass in hand while walking down the stairs into the main restaurant area was probably not the smartest decision on my part.We were a bit squeezed into our booth in the back, but that was our fault - last minute additional person. Atmosphere is fun and lively...a bit noisy, but that's to be expected. I can't remember everything we had, but here's the overview of what stood out and why:French onion soup dumplings - Everyone seems to love these...including me :)Potato & goat cheese pierogies - The truffle creme fraiche is divineButternut squash ravioli - The whole flavor profile was a bit too sweet for me, but I tend to not like sweets. My friends loved it though.Red snapper tacos - Others really enjoyed this, but I found them to be a bit dry.hand pulled chicken arepas - I thought these were amazingBeef Wellington - I wouldn't order this again. But in general, I tend to like a bunch of small plates versus the main dishes. I didn't find this dish to be anything special.The restaurant was full, but not packed...probably because we were there mid-week. I can see this place being uncomfortably full for a weekend dinner though.",1,0,0,Christine C.,"Manhattan, NY",105,184,8

She suggested we make all of our choices immediately so the kitchen could properly time the deliveries. We did so. The deliveries were uneven. One came out immediately. At times, 3 came out together. Delivered last were the carpaccio (definitely on the appetizer side of the menu) and the asparagus.  Didn't feel like proper timing. Food was delivered by runners so we didn't see the waitress often.

2.0,5/11/2013,"Had a rather disappointing and even upsetting dining experience there last night.To start with the upsetting part: We had just gotten our dessert and were starting to eat when our waitress brought us the check. We hadn't asked for it yet, and so we were flabbergasted. I asked her why and she said: ""Well that's just the flow of the restaurant"", whatever that was supposed to mean. I told her it feels to us like we were being pushed out, and she said something like ""No no no, sorry, that's not at all what I mean."" Yeah, right! I understand restaurants want to fill their seats as often as possible, but there are more gracious ways to go about it, and this was downright rude. And we hadn't even been lingering. We ordered our food ten minutes after we arrived, and we ordered desserts pretty much as soon as we finished our mains. That alone is a reason to never go back.But the other one is the food. It's just mediocre overall, and for that it's really overpriced. A few dishes like the lamb souvlaki and the pierogi were excellent. But the French onion soup dumplings, one of their signature dishes, were a disappointment: Dry and not very flavorful. And some of the dishes were simply terrible: The fish tacos tasted very, very fishy and were also almost comically small. The crab cake corn dogs had basically no flavor at all. Pretty good fries, but very boring mac&cheese. Overall definitely not worth the 100 Dollars plus each of us paid in the end for our food and drinks.",3,0,0,Roland L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,16,2

5.0,5/7/2013,"I had been waiting and waiting and waiting to go to the Stanton Social ever since I saw the french onion dumplings on an episode of ""Best Thing I Ever Ate"". French Onion is one of the greatest things ever created, so to imagine it in a dumpling - what could be better?!?!Since 2010 I have waited patiently, so very very patiently for these dumplings and finally this past February I had the chance to go and finally taste this culinary delight. Of course I also sampled other offerings as well. Since it is tapas style, you can easily order many different items and sample small bits with friends, and boy oh boy did we ever. Some of the highlights of our meal was the kobe slider, short rib tacos, obviously the french onion dumplings and beef wellington. The slider - perfectly juicy - out of the park, enough said - try it. The short rib tacos - the short ribs were so tender and well sauced and I loved every bite. The French Onion dumplings - HOLY COW!!! talk about a perfect bite. The onion was sweet, the cheese perfectly tangy and amazing, and then theres the crouton - just thinking about it gives me fond memories. The beef wellington was also wonderful, so wonderful we ordered a second one afterwards. The crust was perfectly crusty and the meat very tender and nice and pink inside just the way I like it.Dessert was not quite up to the same caliber as the meal, but still quite good. We had a cookie platter, the guiness cake, and so many other things that I can't keep track cause our table was so full! No one dessert really stole the show though, and did not compare to the precision and expertise of the entree and apps. All in all, service is great, drinks delicious and unique, food - spot on!

It seems like it would taste AMAZING because their menu is interesting and innovative, however when you try it, it's just ok, taste like a million other places in the city.

4.0,4/28/2013,"The Stanton Social is a fun and trendy restaurant in the LES with a full raw bar and tapas style small plates. The restaurant's three level gorgeous space displays a glowing wine wall showcasing 2,000 bottles of wine, and a menu that is designed to offer different flavors and dishes brought steadily and continuously throughout your meal. I've been on a dumpling kick lately (Buddakan, Huong Viet and Veselka (counting pierogies as a form of  dumpling), and The Stanton Social fits right in with that theme. They are known for their French Onion Soup Dumplings. I first heard about these on The Best Thing I Ever Ate. Like Claire Robinson says in the video, this appetizer ""rocks the appetizer WORLD"". With each bite, you get the crispy texture of the dumpling, filled with french onion soup made with four types of onions caramelized in butter, red wine, chicken and beef broth that simmers for hours, that is then topped and baked with nutty gruyere cheese and a garlic crouton. B A M. The Kobe Beef Burger, Grilled Cheddar Jalapeño and Bacon Slider, and Eggplant Parmesan are among a few of my favorite dishes here. They also offer a mouth-watering, bangin' looking brunch and lots of cocktail and wine choices. No matter what, save room for dessert. The Warm Doughnuts served with caramel, chocolate and raspberry dipping sauces are delish. Not quite as good as the one's at Flex Mussels, but still awesome. And if doughnuts aren't your thing, their entire Dessert menu looks incredible from the S'Mores Creme Brulee... to the Blueberry Olive Oil Cake... to the Mocha Sundae with coffee ice cream, brownies and espresso meringue.

1.0,4/18/2013,"oh dear. Let me start by saying that I only review if somewhere is stellar or very bad. This place falls into the second category. Started well with a friendly cocktail bar dude upstairs, but quickly descended to the depths of rudeness and astonishingly poor service. After much (obnoxious) questioning about the size of our group, we were seated in a cramped booth, probably to teach us a lesson for not being grateful for the chance to eat in such a decorated venue. Well, it was once famous for being a first mover in the area, but sadly the place has clearly fallen from grace. You should know that this isn't sour grapes. Credit where credit is due... the food and those who prepared it, deserves honest praise. Well thought out dishes that looked and tasted superb. But the service, oh the service... This server (and it felt like he was indicative opf the venue's whole attitude) was one of those ""I'll clear the plates from those who've finished, and then hover over the rest of you to intimidate you into finishing your last bite"" kind of guys. Even after we raised this with him, he insisted on continuing to harry us and be incredibly rude (huffing and puffing audibly).Turns out he just wanted us to pay before his shift ended, which is annoying because all he had to do was say, so that we could tip him and carry on enjoying our meal under the more relaxed service of the next server.We eren't the only people to be disappointed and annoyed.

I didn't really know what to expect before trying the food, but everything was really delicious: The  best was :1) The Kobe slider-- slider was so juicy and covered in caramelized onions and gruyere cheese. Although they only sell sliders by 1 a piece, it was definitely worth it.2) crab cake corndogs--- I love crab cake, and I love corndogs- combined together was heavenly. 3) the  chicken Arepas-- this was super tasty with  a bite of jalapeno to balance the sweetness of the corn and saltiness from the pork. 4) chipotle Ribs-- falls right off the bone so delicious.5)  Red snapper tacos  and the Popcorn shrimp were pretty standard and delicious.the not so good:   the  French onion soup dumplings- not really my liking- really salty and the cheese had such a strong pungent smell. we ended the night with an Icecream and whisky shot- sounds kinda gross - but the result is super tasty.I am drooling as I am writing this, remembering all the Tapas I had, would love to come back here again and again.",0,0,0,Arlene Y.,"New York, NY",551,285,347

The onion soup dumplings (a must have from what I read) were pretty good.. If they had been a little more moist, it would have been out of this world.. The banana pancakes were all mini sized, easy to share, and had excellent flavor. Really everything we ate was pretty good: Country Style Eggs Benedict, profiteroles, Croque Monsieur 'Satays', etc.. So just order what you like..  For 4 people we ordered 7 dishes.. It was just the right amount of food to get the day started..  If you are going for stuffed, order more.. Service is pretty fast, so you can always order more as needed..So the only reason I didn't give the place 5 stars was the lighting. I'm very happy we were seated upstairs. The downstairs dining area was kinda dim and not bright and happy feeling for a noon time brunch. Upstairs, on the other hand, had some decent sky lighting that did brighten up the room a bit.

4.0,4/6/2013,I went here for my 30th birthday in February and really enjoyed my food. I'm not a fan of large dinners so ordering small plates and trying different things on the menu was so fun and great tasting. The Philly Cheese was awesome. The Kobe sliders were good but nothing special. I ordered a Strawberry Fields drink and I didn't care for that at all. But then I ordered the Basil Lime Martini and that was amazing. It's a very small crowded seating area but you get so caught up in all the food and trying everything you don't notice after awhile.

The people from the hostess, to the coat check girl to our server were very nice. We got several different items but the one's that stick out are: 1.Pierogies (the truffle sauce they come with is AMAZING) 2.Crab cake ""corn dogs"" (these were unbelievable) 3.Beef Wellington - a little salty but still really great 4.French onion soup dumplings - the presentation of these is so cute and they use the right amount of cheese5.Popcorn shrimp - fried to perfection 6.Pumpkin Ravioli - I wasn't a huge fan, but this is more because I don't really like Pumpkin ravioli, other people seemed to enjoy it7. Red snapper tacos - these tasted a little too ""fishy"" I would probably not order them next time, but they were still above average 8.

The waitress immediately gives us a dirty look and walks to the bartender and he comes over to us with an attitude and says ""glad you helped yourself to coffee"".  At this point not only am I mortified but how dare you patronize me and learn some manners.  He walks back to the waitress and they stand at the left hand corner of the bar staring and giggling at my friend and I.  They treated us like we were low class individuals.  I had two sips of the coffee and I pushed it away and the bartender comes back to my friend and I and he says ""oh all done? no more?""  Who says that to paying customers.  Thankfully my friends arrived in time because I would have called him out on his ill mannered behavior.  My advice to Stanton Social - learn to hire staff with manners, and know how to grin and bear it.",0,0,0,BiggestFoodie Y.,"Manhattan, NY",0,18,1

We went for brunch and the food was all absolutely delicious, beautifully plated and served in a timely manner. Our waitress was very nice and we never had a dirty plate for too long because there was always someone there to give us a new one without us having to ask. We had the Goat Cheese & Potato Perogis (AMAZING with the truffle sauce), the red snapper tacos, the french onion soup dumplings, scrambled egg bruschetta, chicken and waffles (my least favorite) and the chilequiles along with the pomegranate peach bellini which was fantastic. We also had the donuts for dessert and they were perfect and fluffy! The vibe of the restaurant is very soothing and chic and the music is just the right volume that you can talk to each other across the table without yelling.

Some things were really tasty: the banana pancakes and huevos rancheros (in the form of mini soft tacos) in particular. I'd pass on the sliders (I had the kobe beef and the bacon, egg and cheese buttermilk biscuit), red snapper tacos (was expecting it to be amazing but wasn't anything special in taste), and french onion soup dumplings (over-laden with cheese), Music is really loud and makes you feel like you're in a dance club... which works for some people, but doesn't work for me for weekend brunch. You should definitely make a reservation bc it's a madhouse, at least for brunch! If you don't make a reservation though, consider going upstairs to the bar which is a smaller, more low-key space, and has a lounge area with comfortable couches and tables you can eat at.

When we left at 8:30 it was packed! A bit loud but otherwise a nice atmosphere.The Food: *Snapper Tacos: Easily the best thing we ordered. So good we ordered them twice!*Arroz con Pollo: I don't recommend this dish. The rice was undercooked.*Cauliflower: Could have been cooked a bit more and needed salt but decent.*The Veggie Slider: Really tasty. I don't understand why one tiny slider costs $6 though? *Pizzette: I think this was $12 if I remember correctly? Nothing special. Especially not for the price. I would definitely avoid this one.We were too full for dessert but the donuts looked rather tasty.The Service: Waitress was very nice, pretty, and on top of things.

3.0,3/26/2013,"Despite the fact that the first thing that comes to mind when you use the phrase ""restaurant"" is food, food isn't the only thing on the menu. Take Stanton Social -- it's a perfect example of how food isn't the only thing on which a restaurant can and should be judged.First, mad props to Chris Santos for the food -- we'd been hearing how wonderful the food is at Stanton and once we were seated and got a chance to sample the eats, we were impressed from top to bottom. Some of the higher points were those French Onion Soup dumplings -- I don't care what anyone says, if you like French onion soup and you like perfectly-caramelized onions, cheese and uber-flavor, you need these things in your life -- as well as the Huevos Rancheros, the Croque Monsier, etc. Foodwise I think our only criticism was the Chicken and Waffles which was simply (albeit definitely) above-average.Can't speak to the impressive cocktails -- we knocked back champagne and straight vodka tonics so that didn't come into play, but the drink menu is varied and creative and worth a peek or three.The real problem at Stanton isn't the food -- it's the 45-minute wait for a table despite having a reservation. It's the ear-splitting disco dance party that invades your personal and aural space while you're trying to decide what to order from the small plates tasting menu.It's the overflowing upstairs bathroom that requires bleach and janitorial services while you're enjoying an otherwise tasty, odor-free brunch.We really enjoyed brunch -- despite the silly wait and the sillier noise -- and we might even go back. But while the food is on our Top Ten, the restaurant doesn't crack our Top 25 if only because there is great food elsewhere that doesn't necessitate an hour's wait or ear-plugs.With just a few minor changes and some tweaking this could very well be our favorite restaurant.

Thai Spiced Baby Back Ribs - tender and falls off the bone. yum!Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  For tapas, it's moderately priced but it adds quickly if you're hungry and swiftly devouring the small portions.  I had two gripes about this place - music was way too LOUD and makes it difficult for conversation.  Secondly, the tables are tucked together too closely.  I got annoyed of having to adjust my chair, several times throughout night, to let another patron and servers pass through.  (I probably burned off all the food I ate doing that!)  The great food really saved me from giving Stanton Social three stars.  I'll assume the chair incident was a fluke and I'm willing to return and try the other dishes on the menu.  Final thoughts:+ Delicious food, good service, trendy and nice decor-  Music is too loud, can get pricey",1,2,0,Wai L.,"New York, NY",22,29,2

Get them (They are one of the main reasons Stanton is a 4 and not a 3!!).  Covered in cheese, they're served on what resembles an escargot platter (6 pc).  The spaghetti carbonara is also delicious it's very rich, and served with egg on top.  The tuna tartar, to me, was decent, nothing special. I would suggest eating something light before coming, unless you plan to go somewhere after. I was a little disappointed by the drinks.  They were either very light and juice-ish, or so strong that you kind of lost the subtle flavors listed on the drinks menu.  Service is great and they're pretty attentive about refilling your water.  There is coat check, if you need.

3.0,3/1/2013,"This is one of the trendiest restaurants I have been to in the city. It is a ""family style"" restaurant, where you order several dishes to share amongst everyone. For some dishes, such as the sliders, they give you the sliders based on the number of people you have. I came here for my friend's 21st birthday party, and the restaurant was VERY strict on the number of people he could have for reservation. Only 10 people were allowed to be seated and an additional person would cost more money to seat. He also had to pay money to reserve a seat for 10 people, which was ridiculous. We wanted to bring a cake for his birthday but there was ANOTHER surchage if we wanted to do that. Basically, this place charges you for whatever they can. Pretty annoying. We had a good time here though, being the obnoxious group and ordering ample amount of beers, wines, and cocktails. We also ordered several of the small dishes, including the chicken and waffles (these were sub-par), the sliders (yummy, minus the pickles which I hate), and some others. The drinks were what really racked up the bill. Each person paid $75 (10 people so $750 after tips and taxes) which was RIDICULOUS! I am pretty sure that they added a bunch of random charges we didn't know about since the receipt was probably really long.

We sat as soon as she got there.Great decor. A bit crowded with the proximity of the tables, but I never felt like I was in anyone else's conversation like I have in other places. I had the Champagne Julep and it was good. My friend had the Jack and Pom drink which was good, and I don't really like Jack. Wine prices were a little higher than expected, but I guess the prices overall were a little steep...but that's tapas. We got french onion soup dumplings, duck and beet salad, thai spiced baby back ribs and the wasabi pea crusted salmon. All of it was delicious, but I was left slightly disappointed with the salmon. It said it was crusted with wasabi peas, but there was no wasabi spiciness, but all of the rock hard crunch associated with stale wasabi peas you can buy in the grocery store. A little too crunchy for my liking, but the pesto and salmon were good by itself.I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the plates. There was much more food on them than I was expecting.

3.0,2/23/2013,"I loved almost everything here.  I had the onion soup dumplings, the carbonera, the oysters, the beef wellington and the smores creme brulle.  I LOVED THE OYSTERS.  They were perfection.  Shucked perfectly and the different sauces were truly amazing. The onion soup dumplings were fun and delicious.  I was scared of the Carbonera at first but enjoyed every single bite of my share.The smores creme brulle was orgasmic to say the least. The taste and display of all these dishes were nothing short of a masterpiece.Now to the problem.  Beef Wellington.  OMG HORRIBLE.  I was so sad because it was my most anticipated plate.  It tasted like someone poured lighter fluid all over it.  I didn't want to be a bum and complain.  I had 4 of my friends taste it and they concurred with it tasting off.  Overall an awesome tapas type restaurant just don't order the wellington!Can't wait to try the chef's other location.",0,0,0,Toni D.,"Montclair, NJ",181,290,82

I have also been back for birthday dinners and it never fails to disappoint. I love the tapas style of food and chef Chris Santos makes unusual flavor combinations that work really well together. My favorite dishes are French Onion Soup Dumplings (of course), the pierogies, and the warm bruschetta. The Strawberries Field is a refreshing cocktail too.

4.0,2/19/2013,"I came here for my birthday last week. I wasn't sure what to expect but a friend recommended it. Although the bill at the end was a LOT more than I expected (especially for the minuscule sizes of the food), it all tasted exquisite. Especially the Arepas. The red snapper tacos were adorable but lacked real taste. The ribs were also very delicious. Additionally it was all beautifully presented and the waitress was super nice and knowledgeable. We arrived late for our reservation but they were very accommodating and patient. They warned us that they needed the table by 9:30 so they hurried us out as soon as we paid (by persuading us with drinks on the house).The dessert: Michter bourbon hot chocolate shots were DELICIOUS. As was the creme brulee. I even got a birthday cupcake. We were pretty full, but like I said, the portions were so small that we had to order and reorder, racking up the bill. The music got louder as the night went on and it was VERY dark (impossible to read menus without iphone flashlight!) but it was a very cute spot with great ambiance. All in all, a great experience.

One person was missing from our party so I totally understood we probably couldnt be sat, the place (which is kind of small) was jam packed.Half an hour later I go to check and they still cant sit us. Half an hour later after that I decide my bday has been ruined. As I had left my credit card for the reservation I went to the front to cancel my reservation. I had my pout on. My friends had their coats.Within 3 minutes of telling the guy that I was cancelling my reservation (and then muttering under my breath that my birthday was ruined) we were sat at a table where an adorable waitress opened up a bottle of veuve cliquot for us. Two appetizers were then brought out very quickly. Way to turn my frown upside down!The rest of the night we had great service, great food, great drinks, great ambiance.

Breakfast Bruschetta was to die for. Eggs scrambled to perfection with flavor of Asiago cheese infused and slight tang.. perfectly balanced for such a simple dish. Other hit was the Grilled Cheese. We ordered a whole bunch of others - goat cheese parogies, Grilled Pizzetta etc. I think the only not so gread dish was the Mac n cheese (which I remember was awesome last time we visited).

My friend and I ordered a bunch off the menu: potato and goat cheese pierogies, french onion soup dumplings, green beans, pizza flatbread, butternut squash ravioli, spinach and cheese puff pastries, etc. They were all so damn good! Great tapas to choose from.Drinks: I had a cucumber martini and it was really good. My friend ordered the margarita but it had this spiciness to it that I didn't care for. But if you like spicy then I'm sure you'd enjoy it.Ambiance: I like how it's dimly lit, the decor of the place was great. What I didn't like is how close we were sitting to the other tables. We were practically having dinner with the people next to us. Surely they can afford to put a little bit more room between the tables. It was very off-putting.Service: We made reservations, and they wanted to seat us at a crappy table in the corner. We refused, and had to wait an extra half hour for our table. I know it was our fault for not wanting to accept the table they had for us, but I've worked as a hostess before and if someone makes reservations you better give them a good table!Overall, it was a good experience.",1,1,1,Mona A.,"Cleveland, OH",57,47,0

I tried fries at pommes near saint mark (NY) and I always thought their fries were good but this is my #1 favorite now! Their red chili mayo sauce was pretty good, the fries taste good even without the sauce but I think if they made the same mango chutney sauce pommes does than it'd be the best combination.

Kind of annoying, no?Eventually we were seated in the tiny dining area where everyone is packed like sardines.  It's very loud, so it's difficult to hear your dining companions speak. Food-wise, I would say it's pretty good.  We got the red snapper tacos, cauliflower, brie/apple quesadillas, and the spanikopita.  The only stand-out here would be the spanokopita: they are baked, not fried, and are packed with so much delicious flavor. Had a wonderful texture as well.  We debated getting another order!As far as cocktails are concerned, I got the Social Tea and my friend got the drink that has jalapeño infused alcohol.  I was underwhelmed by my tea; I wished that it had had a stronger green tea flavor.  My friend was in LOVE with her drink, so I would recommend that if you are able to handle spicy things.

1.0,1/23/2013,"Monumental overpriced crap.This restaurant single handedly ruined New York City dining for me.I can honestly say that ""tapas"" is the biggest sham sold upon the American public since Crystal Pepsi.If you're going to charge outrageous amounts of money for tiny portions, than at least make a concerted effort to make them GOOD.I get it, going out for tapas is the new ""hip"" way of dining, but because the portions are small and usually only enough for a few bites, then the ingredients need to be fresh, inventive and full of flavor.  Stanton served mediocre plates of food that I could have easily purchased in the frozen food aisle and heated up in my oven.Let's start with the seating arrangements.  My husband and I were crammed into a 2-top between two other couples, with about 4 inches of space on either side of our table. If I wanted to go out with another couple that night, I would've invited friends.  This restaurant has no lack of space, so I am not sure why they choose to squeeze 5 ""2-tops"" into a space meant for 2 or 3 tables at most.  Oh wait, I forgot, this isn't about giving your guests an incredible dining experience it's about making MORE money.Aside from the atrocious table arrangement, we were also seated under a blaring stereo speaker.  Between that and the obnoxious loud-mouth blabbing to her husband next to me, I could barely carry on a conversation.The food...oh the food.  Where do I begin?  Lobster croquettes - clearly frozen, and fried - I'll leave it at that.  Kobe Philly Cheesesteaks - $9 EACH.  That's right, $9 for Steakums on a little dinner roll with some melted cheese and truffle oil.  We ordered 2, and instead should've thrown 10 bucks worth of gas in the car and drove to Philly for a REAL cheesesteak.Thai spice baby back ribs - $15 worth of bland, tasteless pork dressed up in fancy coleslaw.    ""Old School Meatballs"" my husband's relatives from the old country were rolling in their graves - I couldn't even identify the meat they used in this dish because it had absolutely NO TASTE.  Veal? Pork? Beef?  It's anyone's guess.  Take your $13 and go the Meatball Shop.  The only edible item on the menu isn't even made in house - It's from the ""Pickle Guy"" over at Essex Street Pickles.  Save yourself the aggravation and walk directly past the Stanton, make a right on Essex street and go straight to Pickle Guy.When I spend $100+ dollars on a meal, I want to leave feeling satisfied.  Instead I was annoyed and hungry.  We walked over to Crif Dogs afterward and had real dinner.",0,1,0,Ryann R.,"Montclair, NJ",0,4,0
4.0,1/22/2013,"I recently had brunch here with a friend of mine after wanting to eat here for several months. We went on an early Saturday afternoon and were seated right away.The decor was upscale and trendy. The seating very comfortable too. The music might have been a bit too loud but it did not bother conversation at all.The service was about average. Nothing that's gonna blow you away.We each had a drink, I had a bellini which was average at best. My friend however had the strawberry fields cocktail and it was absolutely amazing.The dishes are all small and meant to be shared. We split 5 dishes between us and left stuffed. We had the baby waffles and doughnuts to start. The waffles, 5 of them I believe, were with candied blackberries and blackberry maple butter I believe. They were probably the best waffles I've ever had in my life. I would get about 5 orders of them next time and be happy.The doughnuts were high quality zeppoles with a chocolate sauce. Very good. Not greasy at all which surprised me.I had the eggs Benedict with jalapeno bacon and goat cheese corn bread. The Hollandaise was about average in my opinion, nothing that really stood out. The bacon was quite a surprise though, a nice little bit of heat from the jalapeno and of course the classic salty bacon flavor. That went really well together. The corn bread was corn bread, I certainly did not taste goat cheese in it. It was also served with home fries that were good, perfectly good and with a bit of heat to with them too.My friend had the pizzetta, a flat bread pizza of a sort. I tried a piece, very average is really the best way to say it.Finally we shared some french fries that were good but again nothing spectacular. Nice and crisp with nice herb flavoring. The red chile mayo was a good accompaniment.This place gets 4 stars from me mostly because of the waffles, the strawberry fields cocktail and the jalapeno bacon. Everything else was 3 stars. Get the waffles, you will not regret it. Our bill with 1 drink a piece including tax and tip was a little less than $100.Update (07/07/14) - I was informed by my friend that the fantastic waffles are no longer offered here.

1.0,1/15/2013,"This may have been one of the absolute worst NYC dining experiences of my life.  Where to begin, we were seated RIGHT in front of the restaurant, right next to the door and the hostess's station.  We (because we were not insane) requested a table away from the crowd and away from the freezing cold.  The manager claimed that he advised us of the location of the table, which was a complete fallacy.  In fact, all we were told was that the table was at the front of the restaurant, conveniently leaving out the part that the table was right next to the door, would be heavily trafficked, and that the temperature of our table would be a few degrees warmer than the freezing temperatures of outside.  The manager told us that the table was ""the best table in the house"" and that if it were him, he would prefer that table.  (He said this with a straight face.)  When we further pointed out the throngs of people milling about the table, he promised us that the crowd would disperse during our meal.  Oh and p.s., there was a couple seated at the end of our table, who he promised would soon be gone as ""they are eating dessert.""  When we further tried to plead our case, he told us, ""you really don't have to eat here.""  Clearly not having a choice since, at this point, it's almost 11PM on New Year's Eve and we were quite limited in choice of restaurants able to seat a group of seven, we agree to take the table.  To say that our dining area is beyond freezing would be an understatement, and we end up eating our dinner in winter coats.  Side note.  We were not seated at our table till a bit after 10:45, despite a 10PM reservation and arriving at the restaurant over an hour early (we did the waiting at the bar upstairs.)  When we first checked in with the host, he advised us that our table had paid and that he would come get us when the table was ready.  15 minutes pass and no host.  We head back to the host's stand, we discover that a party was seated at our table and the host promises he would clear them out and shall get us when the table was ready, all the while agreeing to speak to the manager about moving us to a less terrible table.  It was not until much later that we were finally seated. Bypassing the dismal service received during the dinner, when we received the dinner cheque, we noticed the bill included a 20% gratuity.  Considering the horrible experience that was the dinner, I addressed this issue to the manager, advised him our dining party should choose whether or not to tip.  The manager got frustrated and proceeded to speak with us rudely, informing us that he was tired of trying to accommodate our party, and that we had signed a contract mandating a 20% gratuity (NB:  the contract does not mandate any such gratuity.)  When a member of the party informed him that there is no way such a contract would have been signed based on the profession of certain party members, the manager, rudely stated that he did not care what we did for a living. (P.s., dude, you actually should care because you have absolutely no clue who your guests are apparently.)  I tried to point out to the manager that we were not making up our experiences that night- we wore (and were still wearing!) winter coats during our dinner (I even had to find a guy to borrow a bulky one from him), we were seated over 45 minutes past our reservation time, we were seated right next to the door (which, at one point, the ""bouncer"" held open for nearly five minutes), a blanket served as the wall next to us, serving as a boundary between the coat check area and our dining area, we were STILL eating dinner at past 1AM (even as we discussed the check with the manager), and we were excluded and isolated from the New Year's eve revelry- the whole point of dining at Stanton Social anyway.  The manager angrily agreed to take off the gratuity from the bill and advised us not to return to Stanton Social.  Also, while modifying the bill, he proceeded to complain loudly about us to one of his staff members within earshot!! He could have at least had the decency to wait until we were out of earshot to do the complaining.This was objectively the absolute worst New Year's eve experience any of us ever had.  During one of the manager's outbursts at our ""unreasonable"" demands, he mentioned that this was New Year's eve and essentially that we were ruining it for him.  Nope, not asinine at all.  On the contrary, we were paying to the Stanton Social establishment (a not small sum of money) to provide US with a memorable New Year's eve celebration.  That he was okay to ruin every last bit of our New Year's eve, while complaining about his celebration remains quite shocking to everyone.  And when some of the members of our dining party dared complain on yelp, they receive the a form email from their ""Social Media Director"" saying that we should let them know if we need help making a reservation.

My brother and I came here to celebrate my birthday, we're not from New York but heard great things about Stanton Social, so I made a reservation. Upon our arrival, there was a bottle of sparkling waiting for us. My friends had called the restaurant and got us a bottle of sparking. We thought that was were it stopped. Our server, Maggie, was excellent. She immediately took great care of us and was amazingly friendly. She had great knowledge and wonderful recommendations. We tried about everything we could on their menu, and yes, the French Onion Soup Dumplings were great. We also tried the pierogies, which I really enjoyed, had some sliders, fish tacos and a bunch of other stuff. Once we finished our bottle of Sparkling, way too soon for our liking, we ordered another bottle of wine based on Maggie's recommendation (it was amazing). We finished off our meal with some Mexican Hot Choco, which was some kind of winter special and super tasty (not too sweet, as I don't like sweet). Then they also brought me a cupcake for my birthday (very thoughtful, but I was unfortunately too full to eat).As we finished, Maggie came over and told us that the bill was taken care off. Apparently my friends had pre-arranged to pay for our entire meal, which was a great surprise. With this knowledge, Maggie could have just been slacking on our table, as the tip was already included on that bill. But no, she took wonderful care of us and definitely made our night!

4.0,1/10/2013,"I visited this restaraunt with a group of 5 and we shared like 8-10 of the small plates. Some were good and some not so much but overall this place is most definitely worth a try.Duck Salad- To me this is arguably one of the best dishes on the menu next to the sliders. Even though I never imagined I'd say this about salad, this duck salad was great. If you come here please try it.The French Onion Dip dish- Not so good. The general consensus for this dish around my table was that it just wasn't very tasty and not worth it. It just tasted weird.Chedder Bacon Slider- Amazing...seriously. I had to get another one. This was my favorite part of the dinner.Beef Wellington- Ok...this beef wellington was incredibly bad. For the price tag I would not recommend anyone to even try this dish. It didn't taste good at all...I've had frozen beef wellington that was far better than the one served at this restaurant. Pretty disappointing to say the least. (this alone cost the experience a full star deduction).There were some other dishes that didn't really stand out much like the tacos...I thought they were ok.

Special, the second word escapes my memory but there are muddled strawberries in it that change everything for me!!  I'm completely in love.  But I will say occasionally they get stuck in your straw so just blow like you're making a bubble and keep it moving :) Now on to the good stuff, the Stanton does small plates, we had a party of five.  We ordered 8-9 small plates all to share, don't worry ill go into detail with each.We had a complimentary cauliflower soup which was surprisingly nice.Lamb souvlakis, fish tacos, duck salad = round 1Duck salad- superb... Wow it was good completely went up in flames at my table, goat cheese croutons !!! Whuuuut lol greatThe lamb taco was... Eh problem was I didn't really care for the sauce, then again in not a humongous fan of lamb so there is also that. But one of the member of my party is a huge fan if lamb and still wasn't a huge fan of the lamb ""taco"".Red snapper tacos, were good not great but good.Round two- french onion soup dumplings O M G dang that was one great bite!!! Full of awesome flavor.  Burst of flavor not overpowering at all, perfectly complimentary to each other.Round 3- sliders & Mac n cheeseMan o manSo I gotThe Kobe Philly with cheese and trufflesIt is so delectablePerfectly seasoned and I loved every last drop of that slider, my goodness it was by far the best I've ever hadMac n cheese please!- smokey flavor, it's actually sort of spicy which makes it unique.  There's a really great crust on it that I was In love with.  I will say its perfect to share because the smokiness would be too much for me to consume in a large quantity.Round 4- meat balls & beef Wellington Wow the meat balls melt in your mouth, they are cheesy and moist.  Really good marinara sauce.Beef Wellington aka my favorite dish in the entire world - FYI they don't give you many to share, only one for the table.I was disappointed, it was under seasoned if seasoned at all.  I really don't know what was up with the beef, it was blah.  Thank goodness we all split the one in five because we were about to order two more, I think at $22 for each baby Wellington, someone could spring for salt and pepper in the kitchen. I felt sooo let down since it was a house special.  Frozen ones from Bjs were better.  Hence the one star deduction because it really was just that badRound 5- ribs ( baby back) very good Thai sauce with a cole slaw.Dessert: I opted for the chocolate sampler which consisted of s'mores (which won me over), panna cotta, Stanton candy bar, peppermint patties, and chocolate peanut buffer swirl ice cream.Honestly I got so full when I got to it I could only get to the ice cream & s'more which was good and the s'more was a cute twist.I shared the cookie a peppermint pattie which went over well the rest was packed away for laterAll and all ill certainly return!!!

4.0,1/7/2013,"4 words: French Onion Soup Dumplings.  Translates to another 4 words: Heaven in a dumpling.  My fiance and I had a Saturday night dinner while we were visiting NYC and it was a very enjoyable experience, start to finish.  There were definitely highlights and not so highlights, but overall, a very solid restaurant, and a very delicious meal.We were seated right on time for our 8:15pm reservation and were taken upstairs to a trendy bar and sitting area.  The music was good and loud but not too loud.  The servers all looked like models, which is the general expectation of a trendy NYC restaurant, so I marked that off the checklist.  The menu is exciting and different, which was why we chose this place to begin with.  Everything is served in a sharing style and the variety expands through many cuisine types, so I'll rate each item individually.Wok Charred Edamame: 3 stars.  I was excited about this dish since I love testing the different varieties of serving edamame that seems to be all the rage these days, but the miso glaze did not seem to blend well with the edamame flavor and left it kind of bland.French Onion Soup Dumplings: 5 stars+++.  Quite honestly, these dumplings are every bit as good as the hype and are reason enough alone to go to this restaurant.  The dumplings come as fried little balls with a crouton on top connected by a toothpick.  Then the tray of 6 dumplings have a melted layer of cheese over them, just as the soup is served.  You take one bite into the dumpling and heavenly soup just floods down your throat followed by a perfect little crouton.Kobe Philly Slider: 4 stars.  My fiance had this and said it was deliciously full of truffle and very tasty.Veggie Slider: 2 stars.  I normally love a good veggie slider, but found this one to be a little bland and very disappointing in flavor.Red Snapper Tacos: 4 stars.  Delicious!  The snapper was cooked perfectly and seasoned well - all minced up and blended great with the avocado and mango.Tempura Shrimp: 3 stars.  Nothing special about this dish, but nothing offensive either.  Solid tempura shrimp with a creamy dipping sauce that was a little heavy.  I think it would have been better served with a ponzu esque dip to lighten it up a bit.Butternut Squash Ravioli: 5 stars.  Absolutely delicious.  We were full after the previous dishes, but decided to try one more thing and I'm so glad we ordered this.  Seasoned perfectly, with a great blend of sweetness and savory.Cocktails were nothing special - I had the Cucumber Vanilla Cosmo and he had the Centennial.  In hindsight, wine might have been the way to go.  Service was excellent - our waitress was very helpful and friendly despite her 6 foot model appearance.Lastly, the bathroom situation upstairs is annoying.  Only 2 unisex stalls available and there was pretty much a line along the back wall at all times.  Not an ideal situation but just a recommendation to use the restroom before you arrive.All in all, a wonderful experience, great food, and I can see myself coming back here next time I'm in NYC.",0,0,0,Amoli P.,"Chicago, IL",82,337,336

What followed was two hours of being ignored by the staff and basically being segregated from the rest of the event because we were in the coat room next to the credit card machine. Most wonderfully, when we indicated that the service did not deserve a 20% gratuity, the manager was disgustingly unprofessional and rude, telling us that he was ""tired of dealing with you people.""  The absolute lack of courtesy, attentiveness and professionalism completely ruined our night.  This was easily one of the worst dining experiences any of us had the displeasure of suffering through.",0,0,0,Nino S.,"Washington, DC",0,12,0

We had a reservation and arrived beforehand, but still, there was a little bit of a wait to be seated. This place is crowded and loud, this is not particularly a complaint and was to be expected - Although, the seating arrangements do not make sense, the tables and chairs are too close together and it is obnoxious to have fellow guests and wait staff knocking into you every few minutes. Nonetheless, the waiter was a real dear, as was the hostess. The food is prepared for sharing and they were even able to provide us with 8 of everything that we wanted to try, so this establishment is great for groups.

But most importantly, the food was pretty amazing, we were impressed.For dinner:French onion soup dumplings, oysters, kobe beef burger sliders, Rhode Island style lobster rolls, chicken & waffles, Creekstone Farms braised short rib soft tacos and the Essex Street pickles. Everything was delicious. Honestly, no complaints concerning the food. It's definitely the main reason I'd ever return here. Yum!For dessert: The menu on the website seems to have changed since I visited, probably because there's a unique winter dessert menu that I was lucky enough to experience, so I'll list what I can remember - We had the warm doughnuts, the chocolate tasting, gingerbread twinkie (filled with pumpkin cream cheese), some sort of chocolate creme brulee, assorted ice creams/sorbets, some sort of mocha ice cream sundae and bourbon hot chocolate shots.

The only caveat was that they'd need our table by 10 pm, so we weren't able to take our time at the end of the meal. We all felt that we were being hurried along by about ten minutes til 10, but we were late for the reservation, so I can't blame them entirely.I am huge fan of Chef Santos's food (I go to Beauty & Essex about once a month), and I had been to Stanton Social for drinks before taking my friends here last weekend. Our meal started shakily because 3 dishes arrived before any of our drinks, without any apology from our server. Also, we didn't do the typical group ordering--a couple of us ordered our own things, and then a couple were sharing between them. We made this clear to our server, but when the food came out, 2 of us didn't have any of the food we ordered, so we weren't eating with anyone else. We were done with the first dishes by the time our drinks came to the table. I would have much preferred waiting longer for the food, so we could have at least had a few sips of our cocktails before eating. When I eat at places like this, I expect the service to be impeccable. I wouldn't be so harsh if this were a diner or some place more casual. But at $16 a drink, things should be brought out in the right order.Every dish we ordered was fantastic. Exactly what I've come to expect and love about Santos's food. We ended up having to order more food, but our waitress didn't come back until long after we finished our first cocktail, so we had to down them as they shooed us out of our table at precisely 10 pm.

Both times were pretty consistent: really great food/drinks and really shotty service. It's not that it's terrible service, it's that they are a busy restaurant and so the waiters rush you (which is my biggest pet peeve!). I think dropping a hundred bucks entitles me to an hour and a half long brunch with my friend SO QUIT BOTHERING US. This is just a bad American habit that really pisses me off. The food, however, is fantastic. Definitely get the pancakes! I think those were my fav. And the pierogies were also great.

Service: Disappointing. I felt incredibly rushed, and I hate long dinners so I know it was bad. Our food came fast, which was great. However, we'd barely finish a dish on our table when a bus person would come and grab the plate and rush off with it. Our server wouldn't split up our check even though each person at my table ordered separately. (We just split it evenly and all paid with our own credit cards.) My friend asked to use the restroom and when she did, an employee came and knocked on the door and told her to hurry.

4.0,12/3/2012,"Had dinner at Stanton Social with two girlfriends on Saturday evening.  We went early (8:15) because we had a later reservation at Beauty & Essex.  At 8pm, Stanton Social was already jammed.  Quite a nice space, and the staff was kind and inviting from the get go.We had some good drinks (the strawberry fields was particularly yummy) and we ordered seven plates to share. The onion soup dumplings are not to be missed. Ditto for the braised ribbed tacos.  Pierogies and red snapper tacos were also standouts.  The other three dishes (salmon, spinach salad, shrimp) were fine.  Not bad in any sense, but not particularly remarkable.  Bear in mind that these are SMALL plates. Think two or three items per order, so plan accordingly.  The staff does warn you about this, though, and they recommend an appropriate amount of food.  Our waitress was quite good - attentive but not overbearing. She didn't try to rush us, and we felt that we could have sat and sipped as long as we wanted. We also had her split the check amongst two credit cards and cash, which I'm sure was annoying. She was cheerful and didn't seem to mind at all.  Yay - Stanton Social!Two final thoughts: 1) make your reservation in advance. We called on Thursday for Saturday night, and with a bit of begging, they were able to accommodate us, but we were seated right near the door, next to the coat racks in the vestibule, which was quite crowded with people waiting for their tables.  While it's a bit irritating having people hovering over your table, it was even more irritating when people started SITTING DOWN at our table.  Yes - turning the two empty chairs around and plopping down, as if this is normal.  (Note: I don't blame SS for the rudeness of its clientele.  In fact, the maitre d hustled over each of the three times it happened to remove these individuals from our table.  Still annoying though, and probably avoidable if you book early and get a table in the main dining room).  2) it's in the East Village, which I personally loathe going to.  It's a pain in the neck to get to with all the road closures, and you're literally assaulted with pan handlers whilst walking to and from.  I am generally very sympathetic to people down on their luck, but after the fifth person asked me for money (aggressively) I'd had enough.  Just something else to bear in mind, as it made me uncomfortable, particularly when I was standing outside alone.Other than that, carry on!

5.0,11/13/2012,"Best meal I have had in a long time. Given, I have been displaced by hurricane Sandy for the last two weeks, which means I have been on the hurricane diet (starve yourself for 22 hours then eat 2 apps, 2 entrees and 2 desserts plus bread basket) but that shouldn't abate your trust in my review. All caveats and tomfoolery aside, we ordered french onion soup dumplings which I'd actually had someplace else - maybe WD50 but these were phenomenal. The plating is also very cool as they are in a french onion crock but you eat them off little toothpicks that you scoop out of the crock that, similar to french onion soup of the non-dumpling variety, is covered in melted Gruyere cheese. Next was the duck salad. Delicious smoked duck and outstanding kale. Very good salad. The pirogues are also phenomenal and a great dish to start with. I liked the fish tacos and thai ribs but they weren't  my favorite. Lastly, I got the Spaghetti Carbonara with quail egg and pork belly that was outta control good. The flavor profiles, especially for this dish, were exquisite as there was such painstaking attention to detail. Unfortunately I was too full to have dessert and I think 4-5 dishes would be perfect as opposed to 6-7 for two. I would come back here for some fabulous small plates although not inexpensive. That said, to me the perfect tastes in small portions are every bit as worth it when compared to simply okay tastes that leave you feeling stuffed.

I guess I didn't read the menu closely enough because I expected fried chicken but we got baked chicken which was dry and the dish was very sweet. We did not enjoy this dish. The main con of this place is the seating. The tables are way too close to each other.

3.0,10/30/2012,"3 stars seems about right for this place.  While I wasn't blown away from the taste of the food, I do give them a thumbs up for being unique and creative about their dishes.  Dishes we tried include:French Onion Soup Dumpling $12 - Creative...but it tastes just like how it sounds, french onion soup in dumpling form.  Maybe I was expecting something totally out of the ordinary.Kobe Philly $9 - The meat had good flavor and the dish smelled really good from the truffles.  However, when you bite into it, the truffle flavor disappears like a magic trick.  I wanted some more punch from the truffles!!  Rhode Island Lobster Roll $9 - Packed full of meat, this lobster roll doesn't consist of any fillers.  However, don't be fooled when I say it's packed full of meat, this is still tapa-sized items.Old School Meatballs $13 - Although the meat was tender and cooked pretty well, all you get is two meatballs.  That's $6.50 per meatball.  WOW.  Also, I usually don't say this but...the meatballs had to much cheese in it which kind of turned the texture into ""mush"" .  Imagine that...me saying ""LESS"" cheese.Spaghetti Carbonara with Pancetta $22 (I think)- This dish looked real nice but it didn't really blow me away.  The pancetta was really good although used too sparingly.Herb Dusted Frites $7 - Standard medium sized fries.  NYC is getting pricey!  Drinks - Social Tea and Pineapple 75 Martini.  They were decent drinks at $13 each.I had a decent experience here as the waitress was pretty nice.  I do wish they would turn down the music as it made everyone in the restaurant relegated to screaming at each other.  This is a restaurant, not a lounge/club!  Would I come again?  Probably not especially since everything was really expensive for items that really weren't up to par in terms of flavor.   Decent experience and pricey food pretty much sum up the experience.",0,0,0,Kelvin C.,"Brea, CA",176,1162,1147

They kept telling us that they were waiting on a table to get up for us, but we ended up sitting at a table that had been open for 20 minutes. Then, they tried to put us in a small corner. Where we basically had to crawl under the table to sit down. Once we got to a new table, my sister and I ordered two totally different beers that tasted like water.

It provides an intimate ambiance that makes it comfortable to enjoy your meal and conversation. Our server was very polite and friendly. Made a lot of good suggestions for us to try. The way the menu is set up is that everything is tapas styled ( I love tapas.)! We tried the French Onion Soup Dumplings. If you really like French Onion Soup (I do) you need to order this, it's one of their best sellers. They come out on dishes that look like escargot dishes with about 6 pieces. We also had the Red Snapper Tacos which were very fresh. The Baby Spinach Salad was a nice zesty break in our meal. It was a good portion and easy to split. The salad had little pieces of corn to make it sweeter. Lastly, the Hudson Valley Foie Gras came out. I really like Foie Gras, so these bite sized morsels left me wanting more. To finish off a nice meal, we ordered the warm doughnuts with various dipping sauce. These were a nice touch, as they were warm, soft, and sugary without being too sweet.

We were there a bit early, so we got to hang out and get some cocktails. There was just a minor hiccup, since one of my friends was a few minutes late. They told us that we could sit down at our table, but that we must be out an hour and a half later if they sat us right away. We were pretty annoyed, since we made reservations. But once we sat down, no one else mentioned that, and we ended up staying there for 2 hours without a problem. Very strange. After we sat down, our server was so nice and helpful. Anyway, the food was AMAZING. One of my friends keeps kosher and eats only fish and vegetarian food at restaurants, so we tried more of the vegetarian dishes. We found that even though you share most dishes, this was a great place for people who have different diets. We loved the brie and apple quesadillas (they happily gave us the bacon on the side), pierogies, french onion soup dumplings (not vegetarian, there is a meat base to the soup).  The sliders were delicious, but the pizette was pretty forgettable.

5.0,10/9/2012,"The Stanton Social was an  ""experience."" I hadn't been to New York City proper since 1987, so this was my introduction to a ""Night Out,"" New York-style. I had figured this place would be hip, but that was the understatement of the year. Owned by bad-boy chef Chris Santos of ""Chopped"" fame, this is the quintessential ""scene.""  Holy crap, everyone was dressed to kill - this was one of the most attractive crowds I've ever seen, anywhere. These people take going out quite seriously. We arrived for our 9:30 reservation, and the place was just heaving, nearly bursting at the seams. Even though we had a reservation, we had to wait for some time. The hostess suggested we go upstairs and have a cocktail, which I gladly would have done, but for the fact that upon reaching the top of the stairwell, the bar area was packed, to the point of inducing claustrophobia. We headed back downstairs and informed the people up front we'd be waiting outside. The minutes pass. We look at the menu and decide what we want. More minutes pass. Uh-oh. This was not looking good. Am I too ugly to eat at this lounge/restaurant/nightclub? Nah, have faith. Finally, they came outside to get us, and led us back up the stairs to a row of small tables across from the bar. It needs to be said, this place is loud. The music, an excellent eclectic mix of indie, hip-hop, even micro-house, pumps from the speakers. If you want a chill, quiet dinner, this is so not the best option. Come prepared to get swept away with the madness. We had to squeeze into our table, with the tables left and right close enough for me to jab a fork over and grab someone else's food. I didn't, but trust me, I wanted to, because the plates here are well-presented and very tasty. Chef Santos is known for his whimsical, fun approach to tasty ""small plates""-style dining, and that was in evidence on our visit, the kitchen having executed each dish to near-perfection. Our server told us that we should probably order anywhere from 4-6 plates - and she was accurate. We ordered 4, figuring we could always order more. As it turned out, 4 was enough. Just a quick note about the service - I was a little worried that it'd be snooty, but no, once we were seated, it was efficient and friendly all the way. They started us off with an amuse-bouche - that always puts me in a good mood. We first ordered red snapper tacos with avocado. Bright and flavorful, these were a great start, the briny snapper matching perfectly with the avocado and a splash of lime. Crab cake corn dogs were equally enjoyable, the classic carnival treat given the gourmet treatment with succulent crab. While those two plates were excellent, it was the French Onion Soup Dumplings that threw the meal over the top. The experience of eating these dumplings was quite literally like taking ""bites"" of French onion soup, drenched with cheese. Really good French onion soup.....and I don't even typically like it all that much. Eating these dumplings is almost pornographic - take a bite, and the soup just kinda bursts onto your palate with massive flavor. Another item I don't usually order at restaurants is chicken & waffles, but here they sounded too good to resist, with an aged cheddar waffle, corn pudding, and balsamic maple syrup. Many iterations of this dish are on the sweet side, but this was all savory, with perfectly cooked chicken and the cheddar waffles with just the right amount of salt - this could have easily gone in an overly salty direction, but it was kept under control. The balsamic maple syrup was awesome - both intensely tart and sweet at the same time. My ONLY criticism here - really my only criticism of the whole meal - was that I could have stood just a little bit more of the syrup. Admittedly, this stuff *is* potent, so I understand the restraint - but I would have liked to soak the waffles with a tiny bit more. I should also mention the cocktails. We only ordered one apiece, in an attempt to keep the bill under control. I ordered a variant of an Old Fashioned, ""fashioned"" with tequila and blueberry. Very interesting, layered cocktail. It came as no surprise that the cocktails here are well-crafted. I could have easily enjoyed cocktails, but then again, I was trying to minimize the damage somewhat. Dessert was Guinness toffee cake with toffee sauce and Bailey's ice cream. That was decadent. A cake made from Guinness plus ice cream made from Bailey's? Are you kidding me? Sold. It was every bit as great as it sounds - not the least bit ham-handed as some rich desserts like this can be. Oh, and we also had to have a gingerbread Twinkie with pumpkin cream cheese filling. It tasted like fall - and again, by no means overbearing and cloying as one would expect of a ""Twinkie."" In summary, be prepared to party, and eat great food. Based on what I saw, while I'm not sure if a reservation is theoretically necessary - if you want to come here on a Friday night, I'd strongly recommend making one.",10,8,9,Patrick L.,"Miami, FL",935,815,337

The atmosphere would be a four, the food definitely a four, the noise level on a good day a three, and the speed of the meal not so great.  It is definitely a trendy spot. You walk in to a dimly lit atmosphere, surrounded by candles and good looking people. Right off the bat they introduce the type of service, continually bringing out each course, plate by plate. What they don't tell you is they are serving gourmet food at the speed of a fast food restaurant. Everything is delicious... The goat cheese perogies, the French onion soup dumplings, the red snapper tacos, the sliders, and the warm donuts....each and every plate offering exciting and new flavors.  The only problem is there rushing the next course down your throat right as your savoring the flavors of the previous course.

2.0,9/19/2012,"What a horrible experience!! My husband & I along with 2 other couples, came here about 3-4 weeks ago over Labor Day weekend. We had been trying to get reservations for weeks & figured on a slower NYC weekend, while everyone was out of town, we would be able to get a table. We had 10pm reservations. We arrived at 9:45pm. Our party was 2 people short than the original reservation. When we originally called the day before to book a table, we were told it would be better to say we were more people as it is easier to remove people from a table than add. When I arrived, I let the male host know that our party was here in full & we were two people short. Prior to my arrival, our friend also let him know we would be 2 short. We were told to go upstairs to the bar & the table would be ready shortly & someone would come get us. About 45 minutes later, my husband went downstairs to see why we had not been seated. We were told that we never checked in so they gave our table away. When I came downstairs see what was going on & the host realized I did check in he said we were not here in full so they were waiting for the other 2 people to arrive. He had a very bad attitude, basically making us feel like we were nobody special & since this is the ""it"" restaurant of the moment, he didn't care. After a little bit of arguing, he told us our table would be ready soon. Another 30 minutes passed with no table. Finally another hostess came out to seat us apologizing for the mess & as soon as we were seated, a manager came over with 2 appetizers for us to eat - she apologized for the miscommunication & said she could imagine how hungry we were. We were squeezed into a table that was obviously meant for 4 people, even though we were 6. The restaurant was insanely packed & the tables are so close together that the waiters have to maneuver through the chairs to serve each table. We ordered about 10 different dishes off the menu along with drinks. The food was okay. Nothing FANTASTIC. Our friends & I travel to the city frequently to dine at all types of restaurants. We had heard rave reviews about the food here. Maybe it was just the bad experience with the hosts that left a bad taste in our mouth. We will never come back here.

My recommendations being the french onion soup dumplings (which makes me only the billionth person to suggest it), the perogies (also not a shocker), and last but not least, the Kobe sliders with truffle cheese fondue (crazy good, and I believe a road less traveled).Also good was the Foie Gras.Things to skip IMO, the crab cakes.

When we arrived we were seated outside of the main dining room next to the hostess stand by the front door. They insisted that this area was part of the main room. Throughout the meal they continuously tried to clear plates that still had food on them without even asking us if we were finished. The servers came over multiple times while we were still eating/drinking to ask if we had settled the bill.

3.0,9/8/2012,"I really wanted to like Stanton Social. It had been bookmarked on my To Try list ever since I had moved to NY. Praised as one of the hot spots with its unique small plates creations, delicious cocktails and beautiful decor, I was eager to soak it all in.I finally made reservations for myself and three of my girlfriends on a Tuesday night. We didn't want to deal with waiting for a table so we made the reservation for 7pm. Having worked close by, N. and I got there early and we were directed to their upstairs bar where we assumed we would wait until the rest of our party arrived. The upstairs dining area isn't nearly as nice as the downstairs so if possible, try to get a table downstairs! We decided to order some cocktails at the bar while we waited. We decided on the Manhattan sidecar and the Basil lime gimlet. Low and behold, they were hardly memorable. The bartender barely spent any time making the drinks. I guess I was expecting a drink that is over $12 to be made with a lil more TLC. Should I ever go back, I'll stick with the beer and wine. We ended up being seated upstairs. Ugh. Perhaps that added to our average experience. So on to the food. One of my friends had heard a lot about their french onion soup dumplings which sounded very interesting. The server suggested that we each choose 2 items in order to be satisfied. A few of us were still skeptical about the food so we told him we would each order one item first. I think he was a little offended but still graciously accepted the fact that we had disregarded his recommendation. We ordered the french onion soup dumplings, grilled apple and brie quesadilla, Hudson valley foie gras and the potato and goat cheese pierogies. The only thing we fully enjoyed were the pierogies but that was mostly due to the truffle creme fraiche. You really can't screw up a dish when you have creme fraiche that tastes like truffles. I literally covered my pierogi in the heavenly creme and would have done the same with all the other items but one of the servers came and whisked it away when it looked empty. Clearly, he did not understand the joys of life. The presentation of the french onion soup dumplings was very clever. I appreciated that much. They were placed in a bowl similar to the ones used to present escargot but in this case, the entire top of the bowl was covered in stinky gruyere cheese. I think it was gruyere, since that is the cheese typically found in french onion soup. Anyway, one of my girlfriends thought it smelled awful and looked very annoyed. *shrug* The rest of us being cheese lovers, we made sure that was all out of her sight in no time. The soup dumplings themselves were nothing fantastic. I think it was more of a concept that sounds ingenious but once executed, falls short of expectations. And the foie gras? The foie gras tasted like butter. Not quite the taste I had in mind and probably would never order it here again. Do I need to talk about the quesadilla? It's a frikken quesadilla. We all know what that tastes like. Sadly, none of us were excited to order a second round of plates. We all sat there staring at the menu for what seemed like eternity (the server came by twice). Finally, after a lot of beating around the bush, we all agreed that we were no longer hungry and asked the poor server for the check. The plus side was that I was expecting to spend $$$$ on dinner but ended up only spending $15 haha I guess that is a good feeling...Note:: Why does it say that Stanton Social has a happy hour? I asked a server if they indeed do have HH and she replied in the negative.",4,3,2,Sue K.,"Los Angeles, CA",215,99,65

4.0,9/4/2012,"A solid dining experience to start off a 3 month jaunt in NYC. My husband and I had dinner at Chris Santos' famous small bites restaurant this past weekend. The ambiance has a cool vibe, dim lighting, but not overly trendy. Some may say the music is too loud, but I thought noise level was moderate for the feel they're going for.Service was on par, waitress was attentive, gave suggestions of staff favorites, and the food came at a nice pace. And speaking of the food, here is what we ordered:Thai noodle salad- hands down the best I've had. Small nuggets of lightly fried tofu, just the right amount of flat egg noodles, crunchy veggies added great texture and dressing was a blend of tang, sweetness, and saltiness. My favorite dish of the night.Chicken and waffles- While the chicken was done to perfection- white meat, very thick and juicy, lightly seared with a crispy skin (not battered and fried like most chicken and waffle dishes)- the waffles themselves were too dense for me. Also, I think the dish could have overall used a little more sweetness, perhaps more of the sauce.Snapper tacos- Good, not great. The snapper was blended in with avo crema, and even though the taco had a nice crunch, I though the snapper blend tasted quite ""meaty"" and filling. Shrimp and grits- if shrimp and grits are on the menu, you can bet your last dollar that I'm going to order it. I love shrimp and grits and try it if it pops up on the menu at any respectable looking restaurant. (The best I've had are still at Hattie's in Dallas, creamy grits, a wonderful tang from small dollops of goat cheese, raw green onions for some colors, and a semi smoky, spicy red sauce... But I digress.) This dish had a kick in it, and the portion of shrimp (6 large ones) was good. The grits had a polenta like texture and were a bit thick and dry for my taste. Curried cauliflower- Sorry, but very disappointing, especially compared to the rest of our dishes. Portion was tiny, cauliflower (white and green) were too al dente, and there was definitely the curry flavor, but nothing special. Side note- we arrived 20 mins early for our reservations but got seated promptly. Overall I give the food and dining experience 4 stars and it lived up to my expectations. And being Chris Santos' restaurant, my expectations were higher than usual. :)",3,0,0,Debbie K.,"Dallas, TX",1,15,1

The french onion soup dumpling was not what I expected, in a good way.

I finally decided to go the old fashioned route and make a reservation. I arrived at 9:45pm for a 9:30pm reservation. They were ready to seat us but unfortunately since our whole party wasn't there, wouldn't. (Keep this policy in mind if you come with a large group!) We also increased our party by one so they said we would have to wait while they found a larger table for us. This was understandable so we went upstairs to the bar for some drinks. The upstairs lounge was crowded as usual. We got cocktails. How can you not coming here? I got the Strawberry Fields drink (Grey Goose Citron, fresh strawberries, and a Riesling floater). I'm addicted! It was just what I wanted. I ended up having three of them throughout the night. We were finally seated around 10:30pm. We got the french onion dumplings, kobe sliders, meatballs, tuna tartar. My favorite was the sliders. Everything else was alright. If I could sum this place up in one word it would be: overrated. Maybe it was my experience at a tapas bar in Denver with much better food at lower prices (I know I'm not in Denver I'm in Manhattan!) but everything was just alright. Also, this place is loud. Be prepared to not be able to have a conversation with anyone at your table without shouting across the room. That was annoying. Our service was fine.

However, that was not the case at all - we had a really pleasant host and waitress. Food took a little longer to come out than expected and sometimes our water glasses ran dry, but for the most part, it was a really great experience.

I googled to see what restaurants were good for groups and the stanton social seemed promising. I had made a reservation for 7PM but my entire group didn't show up until 15 minutes later. GIven that it was a saturday night, I feared that they would cancel my reservation. However, as it turned out, the hostess was kind enough to honor the reservation and seated us promptly. We didn't have the best table in the house since we were right near the front, but at least we were  able to see all the beautiful people that were streaming into the restaurant :). And yes, this place is beautiful given the dim lighting and dark leather and wood furnishings.  The patrons here certainly would make the cut at any of the trendy meat packing district clubs. Given top notch cocktails, excellent interior design, and well regarded small plates, who wouldn't want to be here? Ultimately, we came for the food. Our waitress was wonderful and soon after we received the menus, we were greeted with a round of gazpacho tequila shots. That was a nice touch. We ordered about 5 small plates and they were brought to the table at a nice and steady clip. I really enjoyed the pierogies with the truffle cream (the carmelized onions put it over the top for me), thai baby back ribs (tangy and fall off the bone), and maryland crab cake corn dogs (very creative). I also liked the red snapper tacos, but they were tiny and only come in a set of 3. However, they were tightly packed with goodness. The chicken and waffles were rather forgettable since the chicken was dry. I was somewhat disappointed with the french onion soup dumplings. The cheese was already dried/stale by the time we got it (which indicates that it was way overheated or left out for a while). I don't believe that it is meant to be like this and it certainly would have been better if it were nice and gooey. Overall, the tapas were fun to share and enjoyable.

4.0,8/12/2012,"The Stanton Social: Special Brunch EditionWe first decided we'd try The Stanton Social for brunch after hearing that Chris Santos was the brain behind it (you know, one of the judges on Food Network's Chopped?). We figure if he's good enough to be a regular judge, then his own restaurant should live up to its popularity. Bottom line: we weren't disappointed (although we were jealous of some of the tables next to us).Spicy Lobster Benedict [$13] -- Overall, delicious. A big, juicy piece of lobster meat on each mini English muffin half with wilted spinach, a quail egg, and chipotle hollandaise. The small spinach salad with a light vinaigrette helped to cut the fattiness of the dish, but was definitely only there for texture. The spice in the hollandaise with the texture of the lobster absolutely made this dish.Croque Monsieur Satays [$9] -- As good as any croque monsieur I've ever tasted (can you go that wrong with ham, gruyere, bechamel, and toast?), but here's the problem: making one huge ooey, gooey, cheesy, melty sandwich into four 1 inch x 1 inch squares (with 3 slices of bread, mind you) didn't make it any better. The flavor was there, but if you're going to put these itty bitty squares on a stick, shouldn't it taste even better than the original? Our advice- if you're craving it, get it. Otherwise, order something more innovative and interesting flavor wise.French Onion Soup Dumplings [$12] -- If you read any of the reviews on Yelp, you'll notice right away that this is one of the Stanton Social's claims to fame. It lives up to its reputation. In the words of Rachael Ray, YUM. O. Nuff said.Kobe Beef Burger/Slider [$7] -- Yes, this was delicious, with some sort of sweet barbecue-like sauce with a little bit of cooked onion, but way too small for $7. Really? One slider? I mean, I know it's Kobe Beef, but even the Cheesecake factory down in Jersey is giving them away for 10 bucks and it's adult sized. Skip this one and try something else on this eclectic menu.Chicken and Waffles [$18] -- So so good... We were hesitant about the balsamic maple drizzle, but the chicken was juicy and the skin was crispy, and the corn waffle underneath was great. There was also what we think was a corn puree underneath the chicken, which had great flavor.  Our only unfulfilled desire was this: a crispy waffle! It's possible this was done on purpose, but every waffle I've ever had was crispy on the outside and pillow soft on the inside. Worth $18? Probably not, but it's worth trying.If we could have sampled these small, almost tapas like plates ahead of time, we would have nixed the Kobe burger and Croque monsieur satays right away for taste and value. But the 2 tables next to us had the right idea. They had both ordered the Huevos Rancheros [$12] and Red Snapper Tacos [$10]. The smell of these mini tacos wafted their way to our table from both sides (it was almost cruel)- not to mention they both were popular dishes throughout the restaurant.  The tables next to us seemed VERY happy with their choices. If we come back in the near future, we would try these in addition to the Potato Latkes with sour cream and apple sauce [3 per order for $6] in a heartbeat.We're saving this comment for last because we didn't want it to interfere with your first impression of the food, but it needs to be said. We find that no one on the internet has commented on this, maybe because it's embraced or appreciated? Or maybe because people thought they were imagining it? Or maybe because it's not that big of a deal? But there was... a strong smell of... cheese!  It's pretty smelly cheese. It's DAMN GOOD, especially in the soup dumplings, but if you're not a super duper cheese lover or you stray away from the cheese counter at Whole Foods because the smell suffocates you, just be prepared. It caught us off guard at first, but it shouldn't interfere with your dining experience.Great space, great atmosphere, and ORDER 5-6 DISHES for 2 people. Otherwise, you definitely won't leave full.Well done, Chris Santos. Next- Jeffrey Zakarian (JK-maybe later)!",4,0,1,Rachel S.,"Greenwich, CT",35,157,93

1.0,8/10/2012,"This was my first visit to Stanton Social in a couple of years, having eaten here many times prior to this trip. I have to say the place has changed so much that I probably won't go back. The one major change is the attitude of the staff particularly in the upstairs bar. There is now a girl covering the seating area who is quite possibly one of the rudest people I have ever met in New York. Her attitude absolutely stinks, I've met some arsey people in my time but her attitude to my partner and I was appalling, we politely asked for a seat as we had booked a table in the restaurant, the bar was completely rammed and it was uncomfortable being shoved about the bar. You would think we had asked her if we could take a dump on one of the table as she was so unbelievably rude to my partner talking a lot of nonsense to him about the area being full even when we could clearly see it was empty whilst the bar was full. She sashayed away from us like she was working this seasons catwalk, like she was some hot thing with the power to say yes or no. To be honest neither my partner nor I were desperate for a seat so I told her to shove it.

2.0,8/7/2012,"I really don't understand the glowing reviews of this place.  If you're judging it on its scene then, sure, I guess its alright.  Not really my kind of place but to each their own.  Judging it mostly as a restaurant as opposed to a place to see lots of pretty people--not so much.  Pros:  I'll start with the pros since there really weren't all that many.  Both the bartender we dealt with and our waitress were awesome.  Both were helpful and very nice.  The space is actually impressive.  I tend not to care too much about that (so long as the restaurant is clean) but if that matters to you then SS will work.  The desserts--red velvet  cake and the warm donuts were both quite good. In betweens: The food.  I am not going to bother listing and reviewing each item we ordered.  I'll just say this:  We ordered around 10 dishes.  Of those, the beef wellington, french onion soup dumplings and the beef carpaccio were excellent, everything else ranged from merely ok to not so good.  Given the cost (relative to the small--even for tapas--portions), I thought the food was a little underwhelming.  Not bad by any means but I certainly wouldn't go back for the food. Cons:  The wait despite having a 9:30 reservation.  We show up on time and check in.  Are told that there's a wait and we should grab drinks upstairs at the bar and someone will get us when our table is ready.  ""Sure, but can you give us an idea of how long before we'll be seated?""  To which the unnecessarily smug host responds, ""Sir, someone will come get you when the table is ready.""   Let me translate that from prick to English:  I really have no idea when your table is going to be ready, we don't take reservation times one bit seriously now move the fuck along so I can condescend to the people waiting behind you.""  We wound up waiting almost an hour for our table.  And we weren't the only ones.  I noticed people complaining to the host about their wait time and overheard a few people bitching about it at the bar.  Come on SS!  You're not a nightclub; you're not a lounge.  What the hell kind of restaurant routinely fails to sit people within a few minutes of their reservation times?  If the food had been amazing and offered something that I couldn't easily get elsewhere I'd say be prepared for an annoying wait even if you have a reservation but you'll be rewarded with a great meal for your patience.  But nope.  Food's ok.  You can do much better; especially in that neighborhood.",1,1,0,Amit N.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,3,0
3.0,8/4/2012,"It's a pretty place - especially in the LES. However, I didn't appreciate having made a reservation and still having to wait 40+ minutes despite having gotten there early.

1.0,8/4/2012,"Terrible service and mediocre food. There is no excuse for a rude and unaccommodating host. I suggest that the management strongly re-considers who greets guests at the door because the snobby, rude host who refused to answer any of my polite questions and made me wait for 1 hour for my reservation spoiled my entire night. Frankly, I can take my money and my time somewhere else where I will be treated with respect. When we finally sat down to eat, the food was just mediocre: 1) If those french onion soup dumplings are ""the best thing they have on the menu"", then the menu needs to be re-vamped. They were good, but nothing outstanding. 2) The beef wellington tasted very unpleasant. The beef was stale and bland, and the puff pastry was soggy. Its really hard to mess up beef wrapped in puff pastry so I was very dissapointed. 3) The beef short rib tacos were the best thing we ate. It was tasty. 4) The red snapper tacos were completely bland. The mayo on the side didn't even save it. 5) Kobe beef burger: good. The beef could have been more juicy, it was a little dry. 6) Kobe philly: the bread was doughy. Average 7) Red velvet twinkie: TERRIBLE. Couldnt taste the red velvet, and the cream cheese was runny. The WORST way to end the meal. To drink: 1) Basil gimlet - the basil is too overwhelming. I felt like I was eating pasta. 2) Brooklyn lemonade - much too sweet 3) Californian carbernet - average, descent wine.",0,0,0,Phil M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0

It's not quite as 'foodie' of a place as it is 'sceny' - but I love it none the less. A few thoughts on what to order:-French Onion Soup Dumplings. Buttery, warm soup dumplings filled with french onion soup and dusted in melted cheese. VERY tasty!! They were served in an escargot-like dish, which was quite a clever presentation.-Red Snapper Tacos. Light and flavorful fish with some good salsa going. -Beef Wellington. I usually don't get excited about anything in puff pastry, but this was very good.-Chicken Arepas. I'm a sucker for anything arepas, and these did not disappoint.-Mac and Cheese. Upscale comfort food. At a trendy bar. On the LES. I'm sold. -Kobe and Pulled Pork Sliders. YUM!Know before you go1) Stanton Social is good for dates - very scenery and sexy and lots of sharing involved - but it's LOUD. 2) They do a good job with corporate dinners too. Took a bunch of clients here for dinner and drinks and had a blast. Sat upstairs with about 10-12 people, ordered a bunch of stuff, and we were very well attended-to.  3) They really won't seat you until your whole party is there. Really.

5.0,7/28/2012,"Ironically, my girlfriend and I had set out to come here on our own because of the French Onion Dumplings that we saw on the Best Thing I Ever Ate, but some NY friends of ours prematurely suggested it for dinner our first night in town. We arrived a bit early for our reservation, so we headed upstairs for a drink.David, the upstairs bartender, was a delight. Let him know what you like, what you don't like, and he will please your taste buds and satisfy your craving for a good cocktail. I honestly have no idea what he gave me, but he made magic happen and I sucked it down fast.When we were seated I immediately noticed that this place was staffed with beautiful people, all of which were really nice and accommodating. We had a friend who was, unfortunately, on a strict dietary regimen assigned by her doctor trying to find out what kind of food allergy she had.

Everyone else was friendly too.  The highlight is the doughnuts.  Simple, yet rich with sugar and those dipping sauces...I can't even...just get them, they are simply put, perfect. The atmosphere was a very relaxed one, we felt comfortable there and even though we were close to others, it didn't impact the dinner.  The music was great too, if you get there early you'll hear most of it, but when more people come, expect to hear it a lot less.  The price of the meal adds up of course when you by that many, but you know something, for a special occasion, it's absolutely worth.  So for a great relaxed dinner, check this place out, you won't be disappointed.",0,0,0,Max G.,"Melrose, MA",193,32,5

The ingredients, preparations, & menu descriptions titillated the three of us, but in the end, the taste only fetches three stars.-- French onion soup dumplings: sitting in a dish made for escargot, these toothpick-skewered 'dumplings' are covered by an unpleasantly potent-smelling cheese. Not very soupy but what little broth there was was overwhelmingly salty. -- potato & goat cheese perogies: I didn't anticipate liking these, but I did (good pick, Wonder Twin!) Creme fraiche added a coolness to the hot pockets. A little heavy, but quite tasty. -- red snapper tacos: too fishy. -- beef Wellington: did not try.-- crab cake corndogs: sounded interesting, but ultimately, this dish reinforced that what I like best is a crab cake with very little breading. -- lobster mac & cheese: just a ploy to charge more for a traditionally simple, cheap-to-make dish.

5.0,7/11/2012,"My absolute favorite restaurant in the city.  I bring as many of my friends here as possible.  The atmosphere is very New York and it's always fun to have that swanky, trendy feel for your night out.  I've managed to try at least 2/3 of the menu over the course of my visits and I'm yet to be disappointed.  While this place is certainly not cheap, it's extremely reasonably priced for the quality of the food and the atmosphere.  My boyfriend and I came here for a date night and shared 5 of the dishes, 2 desserts, I had a cocktail, and he had a beer, and we only spent $110 before tip, not bad for a very nice, very delicious night out.Highlights:Cucumber vanilla cosmopolitanThai BBQ ribsChicken and WafflesKobe slidersGuinness cake with toffee sauce and Bailey's ice cream (which I recently found out is only available in the winter, so I'll be back as soon as it's cold)",2,0,1,Michelle G.,"Hoboken, NJ",6,15,1

5.0,7/10/2012,"I've been here twice now for dinner and once for drinks. The drinks are solid and the lounge area has a great vibe, although as my friends and I discussed it is more trendy than romantic. The food has been excellent both times that I've eaten there, but as a warning it is expensive and hard to leave full if you go in a big group and order family style. On my second visit, I came with a Giltcity deal for a 4-person tasting menu. For $35 a person, we had 9 courses including dessert. It was a ton of food and we left more than satisfied. I would definitely recommend coming in a smaller group of 4 or 5, as most of the dishes are easily split between that number of people. If you come with a larger group, however, it can become a bit of a free for all.",0,0,0,Rebecca K.,"New York, NY",0,74,2

5.0,7/10/2012,"I am so glad my friend chose to come here for dinner one night.  We had a late reservation on Saturday night, so we decided to come a little early and have drinks at the bar upstairs.  The bar area is small for the amount of people that were there, but the drinks were so worth being in such a confined area.   I had a few Strawberry Fields, without the lemon syrup.  It was an extremely flavorful drink that I only wish I could have consumed more of.This place is all about sharing.  I will list in order of what I thought was the best and so on....and I must say that this was hard to do because everything was glorious.Red Snapper Tacos - 3 tacos filled with delicious red snapper, avocado, and mango sauce.  It was the best taco I've ever had.Kobe Beef Burger - I don't eat beef, but my friend assured me that it would be worth trying, and it sure was.  The beef was so tender and juicy.  The best part of this was the BBQ sauce that drizzled over the succulent meat.Crabcake 'Corn Dogs' - I love corn dogs.  I love crab cakes.  Have them together and it's astounding!  I recommend they make the corn dogs bigger so that my taste buds can remain happy for a longer period of time.French Onion Soup Dumplings - I think I was told that I wasn't allowed to come to this place without ordering the dumplings.  I wasn't blown away, and that's probably because I am not a French onion soup lover; however, my friend loved them and they looked marvelous if nothing else.There are only two restrooms upstairs, so the line can get really long.  With as many people that dine at this place, they should look into renovating at least one more.I am definitely coming back here and I recommend it to anyone interested in having a fun night at a trendy restaurant while eating good food and sipping tasty cocktails!",0,0,0,Lily M.,"Dallas, TX",621,875,1389

4.0,7/8/2012,"Had a dinner reservation at 6pm and was seated at a comfy table. We were served by a welcoming waitress. She explained the menu to us. I felt very comforting until they changed our server and gave us a waiter who doesn't show any facial expression. It made me don't even want to stay for dessert. So we ordered the red snapper taco, Kobe sliders, Philly sliders, soup dumpling, beef Wellington. The meals comes in small portion to share. Everything tasted delicious. I would say I will go ahead and order another one of those Philly sliders, the fat incorporate in the beef is so juicy. The dumplings was okay, not a huge fan of onions with cheese.Afterwards we decided to order dessert. We ordered the Twinkie and the milkshake shots. The milkshake tasted different, basically alcohol mixed with ice cream. I will pass on the Twinkie.

3.0,7/7/2012,"Oh, yes, Stanton Social is hot this summer... and not just popular-hot, but also uncomfortably warm, sticky, and not too different from the unbearable weather right outside. Come here in July in a tight strapless dress like most of the diners here, and you'll still be shvitzing all over the place. Sure, the food and cocktails are delicious, but it'd all be even more appetizing if you didn't have to stare at people's back sweat and pit stains while sipping your $13 cocktail tinged with your own salty upper lip sweat. However, the place is trendy-hot for a reason: the food. Here's my take:- French onion dumplings: yes, they're worth the hype. Try 'em. If you're health conscious, try a little of 'em. Very creative dish you can't find elsewhere, and the cheesy, french onion flavor is spot-on.- Red snapper tacos: really good. These crunchy baby tacos are packed to the rim with really flavorful fish and fresh mango (that's not spicy, despite the description). Loved that the ""miso mayo"" is on the side.- Pierogies: recommended by many people (and the staff) for a reason - they're packed with deliciousness. Not the light, boiled/steamed variety, but the richness makes them great for sharing.- Tuna sashimi: fuggedaboudit. I ordered this because I wanted at least one healthy, light dish, but not worth it. Fresh, but completely passable and overpriced at $15.- Kobe beef and Philly cheesesteak sliders: flavorful and not skimpy on the meat. Philly's the one to go with here - mostly beef with only a light drizzle of white cheese and not your typical greasy, tough cheesesteak.- Zucchini and goat cheese pizzette: not very memorable or necessarily any better than similar dishes served elsewhere, but definitely tasty and a good balance to many of the other menu options.- Complimentary tequila gazpacho shots: AMAZING!!!! These were brought to our table by another waitress without a word, so we're not entirely sure they were meant for us, but dayamn - they were refreshing and unique.-  Strawberry Fields: great cocktail - the strawberries are actually ""real"" and not some sugary, syrupy compote. Perfect summer drink. FYI: the graham cracker rimmed glass is no more.The arrival of all of the dishes was timed very well - we never waited long, and we weren't overwhelmed by too many dishes at once. Yes, it's loud, and it does get packed with a lot of young (think early 20's/college) people dressed up for a night out, and waiting at the bar upstairs can be annoying and uncomfortably crowded, especially with the lack of decent a/c. Once seated, the food makes it all worth the effort, though. Solid dining experience.

3.0,7/7/2012,a chic and posh place to have drinks and small bites. their tapas are definitely on the smaller side compared to other tapas restaurants. of course get the french onion soup dumplings (pretty innovative). their sliders are good too. the place is very dark (i couldn't see what i was eating) and very loud (i could barely hear my friends). stanton social's location is the major plus side since you can continue the night and bar hop in LES afterwards,1,0,0,Wenky W.,"Manhattan, NY",91,64,3800
3.0,7/6/2012,"Very swanky atmosphere, kind of like a lounge/club environment w/ top 40 hits playing...the restaurant is borderline meatpacking feel, but not w/ the same type of crowd.All of the appetizers were either a hit or miss for me.  Some things were really delicious and others were just gross...I even gave up some of my pieces b/c I couldn't bear to eat the less appetizing food (meatballs were a no go and so was the mushroom ravioli).  The grilled octopus was also kind of disgusting...the octopus itself was cooked nicely but the sauce was too heavy.  I'm a big fan of desserts but nothing on the menu was very impressive...the doughnuts just tasted like heated sugar donuts w/ dipping sauces.  The vanilla panna cotta was too soft and didn't seem like it finished being set, and the ratio of sauce to panna cotta was too high.  Another con about the place - 1 restroom for the whole restaurant for men & women...maybe there was another one upstairs, but the wait for the downstairs one was annoying.  My favorites were the crab cake corn dogs & the hand pulled chicken arepas, but other than that everything else was just bleh.  Expected better food for the ambiance of the place & price ($40ish dollars per person for a group of 6 w/o drinks).",1,0,0,Chinh T.,"Irvine, CA",87,266,220

We had the Baby Benedict, Lobster Benedict and the French Onion Soup Dumplings. We also had the cranberry margarita special which was AWESOME. We clinked glasses, took a sip and it was pretty much straight up tequila, yum!! When you're paying that much money for a drink, you bet your bottom dollar there should be muy alcohol in it. Bonus points on that one!Everything was delicious but both Benedict's were tiny. Now I know this is a tapas type of place, but they were seriously one bite each. I asked our waiter for some toast to mop up all of the goodness from the eggs and hollandaise, but he said that the chef could not make that happen. Who doesn't have bread?

For example, you are not going to get a rack of lamb when you order ""lamb"". Two of my friends were dumb enough (or smart enough, depending on whose point of view) to attend the Googa Mooga festival before dinner, so they weren't THAT hungry. It's great, because that means there's more food for me!2) Food Recommendations - I remember the mushroom ravioli as being fantastically delicious, but then again, I'm biased because I'm a mushroom ravioli fanatic. Seriously, everything I had was mouth watering so just go with whatever dish catches your fancy.3) Cocktail recommendations - at $13 per glass, have everyone order something different and trade drinks. I'm a huge fan of the Pineapple Martini and the Social Tea.4) Dress Code - I saw a few tables in jeans & a tshirt, but this is a perfect place to get dressed up for a date or for a dinner with your friends.This place makes my list for romantic & cuddly date spots.

My friend never moved from her chair and someone passed by and took the purse from the back of the chair. It was dark and crowded so she never noticed until the end of our dinner (which was quite good by the way).We called the manager to tell him what happened and he was very rude to my friend and told her that she was the only one responsable for her purse and that the restaurant  couldn't do anything. My friend asked to see the video and he said that the camera's angle didn't cover exactly where she was sitting as it was pointing to another side. The main problem was the attitude of the male manager. The purse was no longer likely to be in the restaurant and  instead of taking a positive attitude and offering help, he ""washed his hands"" and had the waiter bring us the check. We were not expecting a discount or a free dinner, but dismissing us and saying that my friend might be lying and that she might not had brought her purse with her to the restaurant was unbelievable and uncalled for. It seems that for this Stanton Social manager, the customer is not always right, but is always a liar.  So if you go there, be careful and never stop paying attention to your belongings because you can be robbed.P.S.

First let me start with the french onion dumpling sound. The cheese is gooey and melty and delicious. The soup itself comes out extremely hot, and the flavor is out of this world.

The fois  gras mousse (I'm sure it was a mousse) with delicious mushrooms all surrounded by a delicious pastry make me want to book a flight just for dinner here.The sliders are all delicious.

There are also some great bars around to grab a nightcap,0,0,0,Julia R.,"Pleasantville, NY",0,50,0
1.0,5/31/2012,"I would never go back. Today was my 29th birthday and I wanted to get a group of good friend to go out to dinner. So I made a reservation for 10 people. I had to put my credit card down in case less than 10 showed up and I would get charged $15 a head. I should have known. Our table was ready and we were set right away. Then when we were told it was a sharing menu. Well not everyone was that great of friends with eachother, so not everyone wanted to share. I explained this to our waitress who seemed very nice and told her the situation. She seemed kind of ticked that we wouldn't be ordering tons of food to share, but I just left it as is. All of a sudden after we have ordered lots of food to actually share, and lots of drinks the manager/party planner comes over to me and asks me if I want to move tables and go to the lounge area, hint, you are not ordering as much food as we want, so I want you to get up and move. She left it as we want to accommodate you better, but it was just plain rude. I told her we were fine and we stayed put. She left us alone but she stared at us the entire meal like I can't wait for you to get up so we can get another table here. We actually ordered quite a bit of food, drinks, deserts and while the food was really good, and the server was actually quite nice, they treated us like shit. When I left I said something to the manager about how rude she was and I didn't appreciate the terrible service on my birthday and I was highly disappointed. She didn't really have a good explanation for it at all. Needless to say, this place has the shittiest service I have ever come across so far in Manhattan, and I won't go back. It's definitely the spend your money here and leave as soon as possible so we can get another table as fast as possible kind of place, and if you don't spend a lot, we won't treat you nice.

The waiters are great at making recommendations. I find that my tastes are typically different than others, but the dish that everyone can agree on are the french onion soup dumplings. One of my favorite things I have ever eaten! Sometimes I order things that are not what I've expected so I've learned to value to the waiter's input. If they tell you something is better, it is.

2.0,5/22/2012,"Pretty disappointing... For all the hype around this ""celebrity chef"" helmed establishment I felt the meal came up short, especially considering the price. The staff was quite friendly, but the service itself was very rushed. I was advised by the waitress to order 5-6 dishes for two (which I did), and was told that the service would be staggered. Not so, all 5 dishes were served within a 15 period, and dishes 1-2 & 3-4 came out simultaneously. If you really have your heart set on this place my advice would be order each dish individually. The big disappointment was the chicken & waffles. The waffle itself was disgusting, a doughy mushy mess. It actually represented the exact opposite of what a good waffle should be - a crisp exterior with a light fluffy interior. Eggo does a better job! The chicken was on the dry side and had soggy skin. Now I am not a chef nor a professional food critic, but if you can't put out a passable waffle and piece of chicken in the first place, you have no business reinventing a classic.

2.0,5/21/2012,"I've been wanting to come to this place for a while because of the rave reviews. I felt it was hyped up and the food was pretty mediocre. Service was really good and attentive. Came by to refill my water quite often. Then again it was 6pm, but still a huge crowd/filled restaurant. Music wasn't loud at all. I was able to carry on a conversation with my friends comfortably. Delivery of food could be a little faster. Came out to around $130 for 4 people. My friends and I ordered:-the ""highly recommended"" French Onion Soup Dumplings - not worth the hype. tasted strange. -Bistro Salad - grape tomatoes were very fresh and sweet. -Red Snapper Tacos- had no depth. no better than any taco joint. -Grilled Apple and Brie Quesadilla- the worst dish. mushy with no balance of flavors.tasted like a really sweet, mushy cheese quesadilla. -Spicy Lamb Souvlaki- it was moist. that's it. -Kobe Beef slider- cooked well. it won't blow your socks off. it was ok. the side of vinegar and salt chips were pretty good and helped bring the dish together. -Lobster Roll-Arroz con Pollo - not great. wouldn't recommend it. -Calamari - the only dish that we liked. so we ordered another towards the end. the tangy mayo dip that comes with it tasted really good. Overall, most of the dishes were unmemorable. Nothing really stood out. Maybe we ordered the wrong things, but with all those misses I don't think we'll be coming back.

Could have eaten the whole thing myself :-)- Chicken n Waffles - Both me & my BF were disappointed. The chicken  n Waffles were a bit dry. - Thai Calamari  - Very good. Liked the kicked up Thai dipping sauce.- Thai Spiced Baby Back Ribs - Borderline loved. My second favorite. Packed with flavor and so tender they were literally falling off the bone.- Warm Donuts - Good, but I have had better. They were not as doughy as I like them.- Peanut Butter Bon Bons - Wasn't really a fan. Could have passed on ordering these.Third - They knew it was my BF's birthday (well I told them) and they brought him out a complimentary cupcake.

And yes those go together....really well, might I add.Anyhow, the food was so amazing every dish I had was a knock out.  We literally had 13 dishes come out.  I had to eat everyone even though I was stuffed after the 9th one.french onion soup dumplingsPerogieskobe beef sliderspulled pork sliderschicken and waffleswasabi salmonravoli'sshort rib taco'smeat balllsmack and cheesespring rollschipotle shrimpoctopusgrilled asparagusAs I said this place was great. loved all of it.",2,1,3,Sheenon O.,"Venice, CA",328,138,12

Get two rounds even. I've been here twice now. Once for dinner for a Gilt City deal and once for brunch. Highlights for me for dinner were the pierogies and chicken arepas. The rest was good, but not sure if I would be willing to pay the price for it without the deal. The famed French Onion Soup Dumplings were not that soupy. I was expecting it to be Asian dumplings style. But the gruyere on top was yummy. For brunch, we were recommended the banana pancakes, which were delicious. I also loved the lobster benedict, which had a huge chunk of lobster. They did not skimp.  Attire is fairly casual and the ambiance is laid back. You would feel comfortable here in jeans. Just like with Beauty and Essex, they are REALLY quick with bussing the tables. I guess this moves the diners along more? For brunch we got seated by the bar area in the highest floor, which was great because that is really the only part of the restaurant that gets good light, and the day we went was a beautiful day.

4.0,5/6/2012,"I'm not usually a swanky gal, I tend to like hole-in-the-wall places and this place is a paradox to my existence, but when the food is this good, you just have to surrender. I check my morals at the door. I met a friend here for dinner and at 7pm, the place is still filled with people enjoying happy hour. We took two seats at the bar and immediately ordered up some cocktails. This is a cocktail kind of place, so order a COCKTAIL. We started off with a few blood-orange jalapeno margaritas and they were perfect. Strong drinks with a bit of a kick. This was the beginning of an interesting Monday evening. For food, we ordered a few different tapas. I was FLEXI-VEGAN that night (read: I was willing to eat some dairy and egg).  My friend wanted to get the french onion dumplings and I was OK with that. We also ordered some herb dusted frites, an order of fried calamari (which I didn't eat), a tofu dish (can't remember the name), and mushroom ravioli. Everything I ate was well-made, flavorful, and really, I can't complain about any of the food. What I will complain about is the sulky, sultry waitress. She seemed entirely disinterested to be there, and really didn't seem to want to serve us at all.  She was absolutely gorgeous, but because she was such a bitch, she actually looked less hot. Personality really makes up for a lot. In any case, we had to deal with her all night. Could someone please take the pole out of her ass?I had no idea this place was so hopping on a Monday night, it was like a night club.

It's one of those places that always comes to mind almost immediately when I am thinking of good places for group dinners and I have come here again and again for tapas. This review is for dinner only.The ambiance is great. It's dimly lit and well-decorated, and has a great energy about it. There's a bar upstairs that your group can grab drinks at before you sit down for dinner. There's a great selection, and the Strawberry Fields is really REALLY good!The tapas come with a set number of items, but the kitchen usually tries to work with your group so that the numbers work out with the size of your group. I love tapas because you get to try some of everything.I've set up dinners here for large groups of 10+ people and it's always been great to work with the staff. When you have a large group, you can do a pre-fixe for $48/person (not including beverages, tax, and gratuity). Your group gets to try 11 different items - 7 tapas, 2 sides, and 2 desserts -  that you select from a set menu that includes many of their most popular items. If you also wanted to include a seated premium open bar for 2.5, the price goes up to $96/person (not including tax and gratuity). Here's an example of a pre-fixe menu I've chosen before in the past, which I think is a great deal considering how much food you get to try!Example pre-fixe dinner menu ($48/person)- French Onion Soup Dumplings (DELICIOUS. MY FAVORITE. 5 Stars)- Potato and Goat Cheese Pierogies (I don't really like goat cheese but other people like these. 2 stars)- Red Snapper Tacos (Pretty good, but not out of this world amazing. 3 stars)- Grilled Apple & Brie Quesadillas (I love brie, so this gets 4 stars)- Braised Short Rib Soft Tacos (3 stars)- Chicken n' Waffles (2 stars. Was slightly soggy)- Kobe Beef Burgers (4 stars. Yum)- Herb Dusted Frites (4 stars. Whatever they put on it was addictive)- Miso Glazed Mushrooms (4 stars)- Warm Doughnuts (5++++ stars. These were like crack! Comes with 3 dipping sauces)- Jaime's Cookies (5 stars. Delicious!)Other things on the menu I've tried:- Mac & Cheese (3 stars, decent but I think their take on it changes since I've never tried the chorizo one they currently offer)- Crab cake corn dogs (5 STARS!! One of my favorites and a great twist on corn cogs)- Chocolate tasting (3 stars. Great variety but got too sweet for me)- Strawberry Shortcake Sundae (4 stars, YUM.

Petite small slices with a well-balanced banana flavor and each patty had a slice of banana that was caramelized to perfection! 2) The place was surprisingly pretty empty for saturday brunch at 12:303) Price was not justified...except for the banana pancakes and drinks",3,1,0,Sumito A.,"Brooklyn, NY",297,421,1043
4.0,4/13/2012,"The decor screams ""New York."" It's chic, trendy, lounge-y, loud, and expensive. But you didn't just come for the decor right- you came for the food also. Like all things NY, food comes in small portions with big price tags.  Make no mistake about it, these are Tapas.  But, what it lacks in quantity makes up for quality.  While this place can handle bigger groups, I say the smaller the party, the better your tasting experience.  I'd say 2-4 people is the ideal number.  Any more and 1 plate will not be enough; you will be eating the scraps off the bones. I'm not kidding, you will.Everyone keeps talking about the French onion soup dumpling, covered with Gruyere. A modern twist to the traditional asian-style soup dumplings. I dig it and it's worth trying.  The shrimp and grits? My favorite dish in terms of taste. Functionally though, it's a messy dish. Foregoing that, the shrimp was juicy and the grits had a nice spicy kick to it. I devoured this quickly.Thai Spiced Baby Back Ribs : Sweet and Savory. The meat falls off the bone nicely and for a tapas dish, it's surprisingly a large dish.Skillet Roast Octopus with chorizo, garlic, and sherry vinegar:  One of my other favorites.  The octopus was grilled nicely and was seasoned really well. No fishy aftertaste which is always a plus.Come here for the loud and trendy atmosphere. Having good food here is a plus too.  Just make sure to have your wallet loaded a bit; prices will add up.

3.0,4/12/2012,"I dined at Stanton Social on my latest trip to NYC. I'm a huge Food Network fan and picked this restaurant after watching Chris Santos as a judge on Chopped. Checked out the menu before hand and was pretty stoked! I was really anticipating a different atmosphere though, and that was a big push on knocking my review down to a three star. Here's the breakdown:Food: Was absolutely delicious. We got quite a spread - the pierogies, french onion dumplings, sashimi, quesadillas, bruschetta, snapper tacos, mac n cheese, philly slider, kobe beef slider, pulled pork slider, donuts, red velvet twinkie, and milkshake shot. Favorites: pierogies, french onion dumplings, and philly slider. I would pass on the red velvet twinkie, bruschetta, and fish tacos. They weren't bad, but to me they just weren't as great as the other choices. Booze: Skip the wine - the pours seemed so small - not worth $12. Get a beer instead, or if you're going to spend $12, get a cocktail, I'm sure it's a better value.Atmosphere: Holy smokes - the other reviews weren't kidding when they said it was loud in there. I thought people were exaggerating, but oh boy they weren't. It was difficult to maintain a conversation without practically yelling at each other. I felt very out of place for the crowd that was there. I feel like the population was mostly 20s and 30s, which is okay there, but it felt like one huge glorified cocktail party and such a big party scene. I'm not saying that's bad - I just wasn't expecting it for this restaurant, and it didn't match the experience I was having with my food.Service: We had an 11pm reservation, got seated about 11:10pm, so not too bad. Our server was friendly - nothing memorable, but we got our food in a timely manner.Would I go back - with all of the choices for incredible food in NYC, I would say not by first choice. Although the food was tasty, the portions were small and the the atmosphere was a little too crazy for me.",1,0,0,Jenna G.,"Chicago, IL",2,47,16

5.0,4/11/2012,"I came here to celebrate by 29th birthday on Friday, April 6th and all I can say is that is I had the best time! My only issue is that because my entire party was not here at the time of the reservations we had to wait to be seated which made us have to wait an additional 30 mins. That was the only downside but thats a rule most restaurants have, however i wish they would do away with it.While we waited we went to the lounge upstairs and had a few drinks. I had the Cucumber Vanilla Cosmo which was very good, and refreshing tasting. Once we were finally seated and that's when all the fun began. Our waitress was extremely helpful, I wish I remembered her name, but she was excellent and pointing out how we should order for a group of 9. Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious and I'll give you a list because I recommend everything. We ordered the oysters, miso edamame, French onion dumplings because in so many reviews people said they were great and they were, goat cheese and potato pierogies, Thai spiced ribs so tender it was ridiculous, chicken and cheddar waffles, this was something we were't completely sure about but the outcome was amazing, the star of the night by though were the shrimp and grits, the table devoured these in silence. And of course we ended with the warm donuts for dessert, the dips weren't even needed. There were a few items we didn't try that I def. Want to make sure I hit the next time like the social max and crab cake corn dogs.And I forgot to mention the best supporting actress of the night, the music. I'm not sure if there was a dj or what, but the music made the perfect atmosphere for great food and convo and hyping us up to party a few blocks over at The Delancey after dinner.All in all I highly recommend!",1,1,1,Natasha C.,"Bala Cynwyd, PA",34,28,10

4.0,4/9/2012,"Nestled in the Lower East Side is a plethora of local community restaurants. Deciding where to go can be difficult, tastebuds can vary, but Stanton Social is one place where you can whet your appetite with a varied selection of tapas. The scene is small and cozy, tables slightly squished, decor is classy and hip. White painted brick walls, half-circled booth tables, dark wood-lacquered furniture, black tablecloth napkins. It's a great place to celebrate with a group of friends. If your group is large enough, there is a private room that you can reserve.I recently celebrated my surprise birthday party here. And I was treated to a very tasty selection of dishes:- Warm Doughnuts - These warm doughnuts were served fresh without a hint of staleness to it. Biting into all that airy and sugary goodness was delicious, but the caramel dipping sauce definitely heightened the sweet flavor just enough to make it a very enjoyable dish. - Croque Monsieur 'Satays' - definitely one of the better dishes of the bunch, maybe even my favorite. Inside these little bite-sized brioche bites were country ham, gruyere and meunster cheese, each served on a toothpick. It was almost like a gourmet grilled cheese sandwich, cheese nice and melty, ham warm and salty along with a subtle crunchy bread. Yum!- Potato Latkes with sour cream and apple sauce - These little fried fritters were crispy on the outside, potatoey on the inside. It was perfectly fried at the right temperature so oil was not absorbed into it. Light and flavorful with a healthy dollop of sour cream sauce and apple sauce made it almost refreshing. Fried food refreshing? Go figure, but definitely a crowd pleaser. It sort of reminds me of a tater tot.- Huevos Rancheros Soft Tacos - scrambled chorizo & eggs, black beans, 'salsa fresca', aged cheddar. It was a solid taco but fell short of amazing. It made for some sloppy eating as the ingredients kept falling out. There was a little too much egg in each taco, which overpowered the scant portions of chorizo. It could have also used some more salsa to give it a refreshing flavor. But, overall, an enjoyable dish but probably one of my least favorites.- Kobe Beef Burgers - These bite-sized slider type burgers filled with a plump and juicy kobe beef patty. Very pink on the inside cooked to about medium-rare, topped with a melty cheese (that I cannot recall). The bread bun was slightly buttered, making for a very tasty beef burger that I wouldn't mind eating a few of these. The side of salt & vinegar chips definitely helped to give the burger some crunchy texture.- Chicken n' Waffles - brick pressed chicken, aged cheddar waffle, corn pudding, and balsamic spiked maple syrup. I wasn't too particularly fond of this dish, maybe because this was the last dish and my stomach was about to burst. The white meat chicken was tender though could have been juicier by using the darker meat variation. The waffle was subpar, not really adding much to the dish, making it feel more like an afterthought, rather than a compliment to the chicken and sweet syrup.Stanton Social does, for the most part, serve some delicious dishes. The ambiance and good food make for a very enjoyable dining experience. I will definitely be back with my friends.",0,0,0,Jason P.,"Forest Hills, NY",545,1119,3574

The pierogies are excellent too. Those are my two favorite dishes - although there are few other dishes that I don't like (of the veggie options). The service was fine, nothing to write home about.

I confirmed the waiter knew - and he did. Next thing we know, the table is clear and they bring out plates and the donuts. We were never offered dessert so it was weird.

I gave the hostess a P.O.M.M. and expected retaliatory spit in my food, but I was drunk at that point on some spicy margarita concoctions, so what did I care? They gave us a free appetizer of French onion soup dumplings to make up for our wait, and they had me at ""Here are some"". The rest of the food was pretty good, and of course we ate too much. Then, they gave us a free dessert, it being our engagement. I really loved the hot chocolate, it was like soup.

Definitely come here then because it isn't crowded, you can actually hear the people you're with, and the service is pretty good. Between two people, we ordered 6 plates, and we were STUFFED. We had the red snapper tacos, arepas, pierogis, french onion dumplings, social mac, and the doughnuts for dessert. My favorites were definitely the red snapper tacos and the arepas (surprisingly good). Pierogis and social mac (a rather large portion) were solid as well. My least favorite were the soup dumplings. they were doughy and the cheese started to get cold because the waiter neglected to tell us these are best eaten immediately :( The doughnuts, however, were AMAZING! So airy and wen so well with the caramel and raspberry sauces. Drinks were pretty good - probably sounded better on paper than they tasted though. I got the Vanilla Cosmo and my friend got strawberry fields. The ambiance was quite hip, although i didn't like how dark it was. I could barely see the person I was with and the food. All in all, I don't have much to complain about here. For two girls splitting 6 dishes and two drinks, we spent about $50 each. Would I come back?

What annoyed me in this situation, is that they argued that we had changed the number of people when we did not, I think they were just buying time. They then said we would have to squeeze into a table commonly reserved for 8 when we were a party of 10. The service manager was pushy, and unapologetic. The place was packed and there was nowhere for us to even stand and wait. It was total of 2 HOURS after our reservation, that we actually got to sit down and eat.

Thank goodness we made a reservation for 7, because by 7:15, it already had a crowded feel. First of all, the tables are way too closely packed together, and I was given about six inches of space to get to my seat. Then our table was tilted, and all our dishes kept sliding down to my friend. The night started out with jazzy music but somehow and soon it transitioned into more clubby-music, making it so that we had to shout and strain to hear each other, given that the next party sat about a foot away from us. I'd have to say that my biggest problem is with the terrible ambience.But with that out of the way, the food was pretty good. I think the french onion soup dumplings are overhyped, because (1) they smell gross, (2) the cheese is too hard, and (3) they're not so much soup dumplings as vesicles for caramelized and therefore soggy onions. Red snapper tacos weren't that impressive either. On the other hand, the tuna tartare rolls were amazing! I didn't know what to expect but I expected wrong and was delighted - it's raw tuna wrapped with a puff pastry-like dough, and flavored/seasoned/done whatever to to make it delicious! Def get the chicken arepas too. They're about 1/10th of the size of the arepas you'll get at Caracas Arepa because they're small (read: lilliputian) plates and look nothing alike, but they are delicious and you should get them and actually smell like good food.tl;dr - Decently good food, good flavors & way too loud and crowded.",0,0,0,C C.,"Boston, MA",2,53,23

After staring at the menu for a few minutes, we scratched everything and decided to have dinner ... even though we weren't the hungriest girls on the planet. I'm so glad we changed our minds! We ordered several dishes but the stand out for me was the Octopus. So many times I've gone to places and it's been overcooked, but at Stanton it was done perfectly. The broth was spiced and not too salty, the chorizo in there was like icing on the deliciousness happening in the little plate. Dessert was excellent as well. Yes, the warm doughnuts are okay but the Mascarpone cheesecake with blueberry compote was where I sighed into my spoon. The ambiance was cute, although the tables were WAY too close together, as was proven by the woman sliding in beside me who spilled a drink that was on the table to the other side of her. Our waitress was lovely, helpful and attentive. She had suggestions and recommendations so that was nice. However, several times when others would come by they poured water with such urgency that it spilled all over our food, and they dropped plates so quickly they almost slid off the table. I'm going to attribute that to it being St. Patrick's Day though, and give The Stanton Social a solid 4-star.I'd come here on a date, with friends, and with my parents so it's kind of awesome.",0,0,0,Al L.,"Brooklyn, NY",128,46,23
4.0,3/16/2012,No matter how many times I go- I always have fun- the food is always good- love the french onion soup dumplings- love the kobe beef sliders- love all the small plates. Service is always descent.  Music can be funky early but tends to get better.  Always tip the girls good and somehow a loung table opens up faster than you expect.  Love the hot chocolate bourbon shots-  If you get one thing only there- get the warm doughnuts with the dipping sauce.

I don't think the food is everything its cracked up to be, but they do have some good dishes. Its tapas style, so it gets expensive. Luckily I have a cool boss who is a foodie and likes to go other places other than steakhouses every time he comes to town. And lets face it I am a lush and will not pass up free food or booze ... Here is what we got last timeStanton Social Plateau - The lobster was huge, but who serves lobster without lobster crackers? We had to have the kitchen crack them open. Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies - These were very good and everyone liked them.French Onion Soup Dumplings - This dish was awful and smelled like feet...gross.Red Snapper Tacos - Solid. Good flavor and well cooked fishCrabcake Corn Dogs - Interesting, but just didn't do it for me. It looks like a corn dog, but tastes like a crabcake...Chicken n' Waffles -  They were fine, I just don't understand this combination.Shrimp & Grits - WINNER! Good flavor, spicy, get it.We also got dessert which was the absolute highlight of the meal, other than the shrimp and grits:Hot Chocolate Shot - who can pass up chocolate and bourbon?Donuts - Awesome.The Mint Sundae - Delicious, you can taste the real mint.The sliders look and smell amazing.

Exposed brick, dim lighting...very cool. I like the small plate idea. You can keep ordering small apps according to how hungry you are. We were three people and had 8 different plates in all which was the perfect amount of food! Loved the fish tacos, the potato/goat cheese pierogies and the Nori tuna roll. Really everything we tasted was great. Their cocktails are NYC priced at $13/drink. Not shocking since it is NYC but they are very good. Plenty of liquor in them. The Manhattan Sidecar was great!!

I recommend never coming here without a reservation.After giving our names to the hostess, she asks up to wait at the bar upstairs. I walk up to the bouncer who seems to have just refused two rather unfortunate looking people. Inside, the bar is even more crowded than downstairs. Getting a drink is a challenge, but we do so. Their signature gimlet is amazing. It takes about a half hour for one of the hostesses to get you your table.The dining area of SS is loud, dark, and fabulous. Though there are lots of people, it's easy to focus on your company. The menu is sort of tapas style, where you get a little bit of everything. I recommend the following dishes: yellow fin tuna with avocado was to die for; oysters, spicy lamb souvlaki, the beef wellington, and the fries. Also, their entire dessert list is amazing.

4.0,3/9/2012,"This is definitely one of those places that's hard to rate on a one-dimensional scale.  So you can kinda ignore the 4-star rating, as the devil's in the details.This is a late-night hangout place, and so as people go out to just be out and have fun, this is one of those places where you can't help BUT to have fun.  There's a lot of positive energy, and so as far as that goes, it's a 5.  It also serves food until relatively late, which is also a major plus.The food itself varies.  I'm more of an entree person, but sometimes the tapas-style works for me, and you do get to try out a bunch of things.  Lots of great vegetarian options too, when I'm in that mood.  Flavors and presentation, again, are 4.5 stars.Still, because it gets so packed, there's a lot of nonsense sometimes just getting a table.  I had a res and was there on time, but still had to wait over 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, there were a bunch of tables that were empty.  Seemed a bit inefficient.If you ever know you'll be down on the LES, then I strongly advise making a reservation, rather than showing up there trying to get a table.  Lots of tables, but lots more demand.  Prices are fair for what you get, and lots of variety.  My real rating is a 4.5, but Yelp doesn't do half-stars.  Apple and Brie Quesadilla is amazing.  Homemade doughnuts will make you wonder how Dunkin Doughnuts stays in business.",1,0,0,Dave B.,"Manhattan, NY",4,96,0

3.0,3/5/2012,"We stopped by Stanton Social to grab a drinks between drinking destinations (because we didn't want to be out of practice). Overall SS is good at what it does. They just need to card their patrons.The upstairs bar seems like the place where a guy in a black suit with no neck is hired just to check ID and turn away the unattractive. It has a dark, tight speakeasy vibe that puts you in the mood for a drink. The staff is clearly rushed and hurried, but the level of service doesn't suffer for it. The waitresses are small, quick and have very good balance. They are like cocktail ninjas. The bartender served our drink in less than 2 minutes (which is light speed in a craft cocktail lounge) and it was good. I figured they make it by the batch to save time, but I'm not complaining.The main downside of SS is the crowd. The lack of age was staggering. There are boys hanging out there that seem like they would be more comfortable in a sports bar or drinking in their parents basement. There are girls who couldn't even walk in their heels, teetering with every step and threatening to run into the cocktail ninja. Everyone was behaving themselves more or less so I guess it was fine, but I'm pretty sure someone should have been checking someone's ID before drinks were served. SS is a good place to grab a drink.

I see the french onion soup dumplings get good reviews, but the real show stopper was the artichoke fritters! We ordered 3 portions because they were so irresistable.

I had a group of 11 and sat right near the entrance where other patrons were coming in and out, and our table was right near coat check. We felt cramped and kept getting hit with the cold draft as the door kept opening. I would've expected better seating considering I called a month in advance for this reservation.

But the other desert that we ordered was just great - Its not on the online menu but it was a toffee cake with vanilla ice cream and the consistency, sweetness and the hot-cold play in this desert was just perfect.

While the dining experience is pleasant, coming for a drink on a Saturday night is less enjoyable -- barely any breathing room at the tiny bar upstairs and really not much of a scene. But... back to the food! First of all, the Brooklyn Lemonade is delicious -- subtly sweet with ginger and cucumber infusion. The French onion soup dumplings really do live up to the hype, as do the potato goat cheese pierogies... the truffle creme fraiche is so good that I would easily eat it on its own! The warm piquillo pepper bruschetta is delicious.. thanks to the generous dollop of roasted garlic goat cheese (and what really isn't delicious with a dollop of goat cheese?) The Beef Wellington had a perfectly soft and flaky pastry. The only real disappointment was the pumpkin ravioli with a vanilla sauce that was exceedingly sweet and made it taste more like a dessert than tapas. Finally... dessert is worth the wait.

The standing bar area was packed when we got there at 7:30pm and stay packed until the time we left at around 10:30pm. So it is important to make reservations if you want to sit down. The music is pretty loud - not loud enough so you have to speak directly into people's ears but loud enough that you have to lean forward and raise your voice - in all fine for our big group who are all in a celebratory mood and getting ready to go to a club afterwards but probably not great otherwise. The food is pretty decent, each portion I'd say is pretty substantial for tapas standard.  (The women in the group were happily stuffed but the guys can still go for more food after). We had the pierogies, souvlaki, tacos, shrimp, kobe beef sliders, quesadilla, lobster roll and a fig foie gras thing which might be a bday speical since i don't see it on the regular menu. All of these items are very nicely presented on dish, all tasted good but a bit too strongly seasoned. Of the bunch I'd say my favorites are the kobe beef sliders and the quesadilla. The items that made the most impression at the end of the night are the cocktails and the dessert. I had the strawberry fields and basil-lime gimlet and would have gone for another of the basil-lime gimlet. I was surprised that muddled basil can taste so good and refreshing in a cocktail without being to overpowering - highly recommend you to try it. I think about half of the group ended up ordering this drink. We had the donuts and Jaime's cookies for dessert and oh my gosh both were really delicious. The donuts were warm and the taste and texture reminded me of a Chinese dessert ( sa yung) I love growing up. The cookies were chewy and warm and was just a really great way to end the meal. Each of of ended up putting in about 100 bucks for the meal. I had a great time, but wouldn't have come here if it wasn't for the birthday celebration because of the price, loud music, and how crowded it was.",0,0,0,Yvonne T.,"Baltimore, MD",273,36,4
3.0,2/19/2012,"Okay so I came to this place with some friends after it was recommended to me by some coworkers and it was not what I thought it would be.  1st  off the music was way too loud for a restaurant setting, I felt more like I was in a dance club than sitting down for a meal and could not hear most of the conversation despite being seated at a relatively small table. Also it was extremely overpriced. We were 7 people and the bill came out to over $300. That being said I thought the food was pretty good. I liked 6 out of the 8 dishes we ordered and thought it was cool how it was served in appetizer format meant for everyone to share. Honestly if they lowered the music and made it a more suitable atmosphere for a dinner I may eat there again on a special occasion but its way to expensive for me to enjoy on a regular basis.",0,0,0,Perri S.,"Stamford, CT",31,12,3

3.0,2/17/2012,"I came here on Valentine's Day for a Girls-date-night-out and all of us absolutely loved the food!It's tapas style, hence not a place to really EAT, but rather a place to drink and foster great conversation. Most people order 2-3 plates per person and it'll quickly add up, considering that Stanton Social is a classy, dim-lit, romantic restaurant that serves only quality food.Every dish is almost like an original artistic piece. We ordered:Warm piquillo pepper bruschetta- comes with roasted garlic goat cheese. It's INCREDIBLY creamy, so it's good that they only served it in small quantities, which also keeps you wanting more. Taste: 4/5Red snapper tacos- comes with avocado and spicy mango. One of my personal favorites out of everything that I ordered! Too bad the portions are only bite sized! Taste: 5/5 French onion soup dumplings- also one of my favorites! there's a REASON why all the other yelpers have recommended this! It's smothered with cheese all over the top; definitely not like your average dumpling in which all the goodies are wrapped on the inside. Advice: eat the dumpling WHOLE. That way you can get a taste of all the juices inside, which is one of the best part! Taste: 5/5.Butternut squash and sweet potato ravioli- topped with vanilla brown butter and candied pecans, so don't be fooled, this ravioli is SWEET! More like a warm dessert rather than a savory dinner-type dish. Probably a reason why they served this dish last. Taste: 3/5.Foie gras- on top of toasted brioche topped with pistachios and spiced kumquat jam. I would have liked it better withOUT the kumquat jam. The tangy zing from the jam tasted like sweet, sour orange peels. But on top of my savory foie gras, it just didn't go well together. I praise their creativity and boldness, but taste: 3/5.Crabcake slider- with BBQed onion & mango slaw. The onion taste may have been a bit overbearing on the crabcake, but overall taste: 4/5Lobster roll- like a hot dog but instead of a wiener in the middle, you have savory bits of lobster in creamy form. Okok, ALSO one of my favorites. Taste: 5/5.  Note: these dishes ranged from $7-$14 each. Super pricey!Lastly, if you like fruity drinks, definitely get the pineapple martini! In fact, all their drinks are beautifully made. I could understand why they were $13 each!The service wasn't incredibly good. The waiter lacked eye contact, as if his mind was always elsewhere. Hence, we didn't get the warm, attentive server that I would have expected at a place like this. The loud, house music added to the bougy club scene.

Been meaning to come here for so long but kept being lazy about making a far in advance reservation and kept getting stuck with either a 5 PM or 10 PM which I could never make. Finally made it here on a Thursday night though and it definitely lived up to the hype! First we went upstairs to the lounge area to wait for our table to be ready and had a drink. I think you can order food upstairs as well so if you can't get a res, you can try your luck at trying to snag a seat upstairs. Anyway, there were so many choices and I was so impressed by everything we ordered. If you need some guidance on what to get here's what we had:-French Onion Soup Dumplings- What a genius idea and tasty spin on soup dumplings. This was so delicious we had to order a second round! (must order this)-Beef Carpaccio- this was good but you can get this at a lot of places I would order something more exciting off such an eclectic menu!-Red Snapper Tacos- Come in hardshell tacos and they're stuffed, but a little small. Still tasty and I'd definitely order this again -Grilled Apple & Brie Quesadillas- Apple and brie went really went together and inside a quesadilla it was even better-Maryland Jumbo Lump Crabcake Corndogs- These were good but not amazing. I love corn dogs and I'm from Maryland and by default love crabcake but at the end of the day I guess it's essentially a fried crab cake. -Thai Spiced Baby Back Ribs- Ribs were pretty tender and loved the sweet salty thai spin on the sauce -Chicken n' waffles- These were okay. Definitely not the best chicken and waffles I've ever had but this fatty combo is always goodWe were a party of 4 girls and 8 dishes was definitely enough. As some have mentioned before it is a bit pricey, but you don't eat a place like this everyday. Also, it does get a bit noisy just because it's so packed, but it's not unbearable.

As far as the restuarant downstairs.  The best is to try a few tapas and share. Everything is fantastic. But I didn't like the French onion dumplings everyone raved about. The chocolate sampling dessert is more than enough to share and delicious (note it is heavy). Also got the chocolate shots and it's pretty good. I like chocolate but I don't crave and love and desire it like many so I maybe not the best to review the chocolate desserts. So if you made reservations, you will still wait about 20minutes.

And the waitstaff was friendly Those were the ONLY good things.The bad.The bill killed our wallets. It was 7 of us and the bill was about $300 or more (I believe we had to pay at LEAST $60 each, maybe $80). I also had a drink that was $11, and it wasn't even a decent size and it was too watery. On top of that, the music was WAY TOO LOUD!!!! Like we were at a club. I couldn't have a decent conversation because I couldn't even hear anyone. Loud music is for clubs when you have a few drinks and to get up and dance, not when you are sitting down for dinner.Two stars because the food and service was good. I wouldn't go back, though.

If you eat six, more power to you but get some gum because that's a lot of onion. Also be warned, it is hot when it first comes out. My date burnt her tongue for sure. That kind of makes the rest of the menu a tad less enjoyable. But she trooped on and had two more. Although she did make me try them first to see if they were hot and then said that if she burnt her to tongue again I would have to eat a whole raw onion. Girls. SMH. Only complaint was the dessert. It's a tapa joint so just opt for one more tapa instead of the dessert. Trust. We ordered the red velvet Twinkie and the filling was way too sweet and the red velvet cake was dry. The only thing we didn't finish. The bourbon something something shot we also lacking. Not enough bourbon and the marshmallows were too small and not warm enough. But the shot was 3 dollars each so can't complain too much about that. This meal will deny the wallet but your tummy will thank you. Hopefully your date thanks you too I guess. Happy eating, suckers.",1,0,1,Chris M.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",243,176,7
2.0,1/11/2012,The Stanton Social has given a whole new meaning to small plates. I came here with several co-workers and I walked away starving. I stopped and got a couple slices of pizza on my way home. Granted the food was good but the plates were beyond small even for Tapas and their menu is not cheap. I felt cheated. Every plate that came out I was asking myself where is the food?Not a fan and will definitely not be back.,2,1,0,Gary O.,"Bozeman, MT",45,132,1

This weekend they had candied blackberry waffles on the menu which were ridiculous, with sugar-coated berries, blackberry syrup and perfectly cooked waffles.Savory dishes are also good but the highlight is definitely sweets; bacon, egg, and cheese biscuits are great with salt and vinegar chips, various egg benedict options and fish tacos are all solid choices.Brunch cocktails are good and strong; the mimosas are a perfect complement vs. a stronger cocktail which might compete with some of the more delicate flavors.Don't expect giant portions; for the waffles you get 3 tiny (but adorable) waffles but they are packed with flavor.  Come here for the cute bites, decadent sweet dishes and to have a fabulous NYC experience.  Make a reservation in advance for brunch on Open Table if you can or you may end up waiting.",0,0,0,Jenn E.,"Seattle, WA",250,369,140

1.0,1/8/2012,"Stopped in at about 12:30 for Brunch today. Place was busy so even with a reservation we had to wait...So how brunch, you ask? In a word... AWFUL. They must have had the backup squad in the kitchen as the service was slow and the menu was executed terribly. 1. Ricotta Fritters - These were fried in oil that was way too hot, the outside of the fritters were burnt and the inside was somewhat raw. We ate 3 out of the 6 in the order and then pushed them aside awaiting the rest of our plates. In hindsight we should have sent these back. (1 Star)2. Spicy Lobster Benedict - Best dish we had, poached eggs and lobster were cooked correctly, however it was very bland and screaming for some seasoning. (3 Stars)3. French Onion Soup Dumplings - I've had these before at Stanton and normally they are awesome. Today they were chewy and the cheese that is supposed to be melted and gooey on top was like a cheese crust. You could tell the dumplings were not fresh and that the dish had been sitting under a hot plate for a while before service. I literally had to cut the cheese with a knife to get the dumpling out of the dish. Again we at 3 out of the 6 and left the rest. (1 Star)4. Grilled Apple and Brie Quesadilla - This came along with our sliders which are discussed below. Again these must have been sitting under a hot plate for a while. The Quesadilla was overcooked, yet not crispy at all, and the Brie was the consistency of cheese that had been melted and then left to coagulate. It was not gooey it was rubbery. We sent this back after one bite along with the sliders... (1 Star)5. Bacon Egg & Cheese and Grilled Cheese Jalapeno Slider - We ordered one of each. The BEC is served on a biscuit, which was undercooked. It was barely browned and the middle was still doughy. The egg and cheese were again rubbery and not melted (another case of sitting under a hot plate too long) and the sandwich was barely lukewarm in the middle. The grilled cheese was even worse. The bread was like a giant oily crouton, and the cheese was again like a rubberized glue holding it together. We sent both dishes back after one bite, and asked for the check... (1 Star)Service was slow and we noticed other tables near us either picking at their food or sending food back, so clearly they had issues in the kitchen. 1 dish out of 6 was prepared properly, the rest were a complete mess. I dont know how the expediter let these out of the kitchen to begin with. He should be fired.I'm not sure if this was an issue today only or if this is the new norm at Stanton Social, but after my experience today I won't be back to find out.

4.0,1/6/2012,"My mind is boggled. I've found myself guiltily wandering to Bisous ciao so many times in the past but never noticed that the famous Stanton Social was right next door. Don't let the unassuming exterior fool you though, the restaurant stretches deep within its lot and has three levels of fanciful, glamorous seating space. After hearing all the raves about this locale, I was expecting lavishness full to the brim - excesses possibly not unlike those at Beauty & Essex. Turns out the interior is not quite as bejeweled, nor gimmicky at all, but in fact very tasteful and very classy. Glass-tube lights suspend from the ceiling and dim yellow cake shaped lamps hang on thin rods against a whitewashed brick wall - the whole place was very intimate despite a noticeable air of sophistication, without the help of chandeliers! Firstly, I loved the drinks here. I got a mint-grapefruit martini, which was a) delicious and b) solidly heady. Food was 4 stars. Definitely delish, but not mind blowing. - Red snapper tacos (4 stars - bold flavor, loved that fresh corn tortilla taste, needed more focus on the snapper)- Tuna sashimi (3 stars - meh)- Potato and goat cheese pierogies with creme fraiche (my friend remarked that this was really good sour cream and I wagged my finger no no its 'creme fraiche'. Turns out creme fraiche  is basically sour cream. Oop. Wikipedia tells me its 28% butterfat with a pH of 4.5, and that it's even more fattening than sour cream. Fascinating. (5 stars - these were my favorite of the night. Pierogies were delicious and the coat of caramelized onions topped it all off)) - Kobe truffle philly (4 stars - it was good and full of flavor, can't remember much about it, and don't remember experiencing the lingering truffle oils on my palate. Random thought since this dish came with salt and vinegar chips: why doesn't anyone sell ketchup chips, EH? They were all the rave back in Canada.)- French onion soup dumplings (3 stars - as the signature dish, I really expected much more. There was no soup in the soup dumpling (blasphemy) and the entire plate just seemed very hastily put together)- Chocolate tasting (4.5 stars - this was amazing. chocolate ice cream with chili spice, mint chocolates, chocolate panna cotta, strawberry truffles, some tart, and some mousse pops)The Stanton Social definitely lives up to its hype, but for the price and for good wine, I'd still go to Alta any day!There you go, a nice, detailed review to kickstart 2012 yelp elite badge day :) woohoo!!",1,0,0,Nancy Y.,"San Francisco, CA",234,130,7

We ordered the doughnuts for dessert. These were really good, very light and fluffy--but I wouldnt go back for it. I am OK having dense doughnuts elsewhere. The drinks are watered down. I mean if you are charging $13 a pop atleast make a decent drink! we know ice has been discovered--you dont have to pound the table on it. Overall for the prices the serving size is abysmal.

4.0,1/5/2012,"Made our way to the lower east side for a Thursday night early dinner for two plus a baby. I'll admit that we were lured here thanks to a bit on the food network about the french onion soup dumplings, which we ordered. While they're novel and tasty, it was not the top menu item of the evening. ""Go forth to Stanton Social and order Beef Wellington,"" God said to Moses, but Moses decided to leave off the 11th commandment to keep the secret for himself. Seriously, go here, order the Beef Wellington, win.Though the portions are pricier, it's definitely worth the money for an occasional night out. We ordered and enjoyed all of the following, in order of preference (excluding dessert): beef wellington, wasabi encrusted salmon, red snapper tacos, french onion soup dumplings, shrimp and grits, braised spare rib tacos. For dessert, we had fried donuts, which were uh-mazing. I'd recommend getting these, but if you don't want to be stuffed only order 2 plates of food per. Otherwise prepare for a leisurely meal and don't wear anything too snug. The second dessert was the pumpkin pie sundae, which was as rich and decadent as it sounds. Overall, service was excellent, and we were pleased that they didn't fuss over seating us with our son (in a stroller).

The caramel was a nice touch and although they didn't need it. Fish tacos, breakfast costini and lamb souvlaki were also good, but not memorable. What was memorable was the french onion soup dumplings... mostly because none of us knew what to expect.. we thought they'd be dumplings in soup!

Then we had the french onion soup dumplings, which were like cheese-encrusted bites of french onion soup. it was good, but not mind blowing. great presentation, with the croutons on skewers poked into the individual dumplings. we finished off with the beef wellington (overly-flavored for my taste, but this was my bf's fave) and the oven-roasted beets (if they coulda added feta cheese i think this would've been stellar).Service was top knotch.

The batter on the outside dips headfirst into a creamy sauce in the serving bowl when it comes out, making your first bite really soggy.  Crabmeat is oddly... ambiguous. I'd pass and try something else.Kobe beef slider - wow, for $7, this is like a slider bite. Super tiny. And not so tasty.Butternut squash and sweet potato ravioli - now, THIS was the standout dish of the night and lived up to the good things I'd heard said about Stanton.  Delicious sweet filling, with candied nuts sprinkled on top and a sauce that really goes well with the sweet.  Three ravioli pieces only for $15 though was steep.Ambience was really nice, staff was great, but for what you pay, I really don't think it was worth it.

I had previously been here with family, for a birthday party, on a date, and now added a night out with friends to the list. First lets get the grievances out of the way: the music in this restaurant is too damned loud. Sitting at my 5 person circular table, I could really only hear the people on either side of me, and that often proved a struggle. Its not because my friends have problems enunciating, its because the music in this place is too damned loud. I get that they are trying to create a vibe, and I thought their song selection was actually great. I like music as much as the next guy going for dinner and drinks, but there is a happy middle ground which Stanton Social WAY overshot. The music level is totally fine at Tao and Lavo, so I dont know who made the decisions here.On to the positives: the food! I had mediocre memories from past visits, but thought everything yesterday was great:-octopus salad: my favorite dish there. Octopus cooked perfectly and good flavors-seared foie gras: probably not my favorite example of SFG, but this dish is hard to mess up. delicious-west coast oysters: a little pricey but very good, and a great selection of dipping sauces -miso glazed mushrooms: warming and tasty-espresso marshmallow whiskey shot: great. even my sister who hates alcohol enjoyed it.Conclusion: 4*, but could be at 5 so very easily if they just turned the damned music down",0,0,0,Ashwin T.,"New York, NY",166,217,108

Maybe I am getting older and have no patience for waiting in lines nor fond of crowds; nevertheless I was anticipating good food. Was it good food? I'd say, food for 'show' but not for the 'soul'. Hey, that rhymes.Yes I know what I was in for. Tapas, aka small plates. I know. 2 out of the 8 tapas are actually worth commending.Warm Piquillo Pepper 'Bruschetta' stuffed with roasted garlic-goat cheese $7. Two pieces of sad bread. Sad? The foundation of Bruschetta (to me) comes from quality bread with great texture and density. Plus, a crunchy bite. It was dabbled with garlic-goat cheese and whole roasted red pepper. My taste buds weren't dazzled from the combination.Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies with caramelized onions & truffle creme fraiche $9. This dish consist of three pierogies that was recommended by our server. A fried outer shelf filled with creamy cheese. I enjoyed this and was content. And I'm not big on pierogies.Beef Carpaccio- pickled shallot, fried capers, wholegrain mustard-crème fraiche $13. Thinly sliced beef and overly salted. Pickled shallot, capers and sea salt; all in one dish is asking for your blood pressure to please go up higher. Nevertheless it was nicely presently, and the plate was cleaned up in minutes.Sweet & Sour Chicken & Cashew Spring Rolls $9. Four rolls for 9 bucks, REALLY? Not the most memorable and least tastiest. Served piping hot, wrappers weren't as crunchy as I would liked and filling was not bold as I hoped. Sprinkled with lots of bits of cashews.Nori Spiced Tuna Tartare Roll $13. Can you go wrong with Tartare? Nicely executed dish. Seasoned tuna wrapped in a light crispy nori. Enjoyable.Social Mac & Cheese - chorizo, ovendried tomato $12. Literally a serving cup of mac and cheese. Nicely plated. Well done crusty cheese and creamy cheese center. But not for $12. That's just robbery.Grilled Ovendried Tomato Pizzetta fresh mozzarella, grana, roasted garlic, chile oil $14. The most expensive tapas and biggest dish turned out to be the most ridiculously disappointing. Mama Celeste will be so proud, she might jump out of the box and kill this dish. The Pizzetta has an ultra thin crust without the consistency of a pizza dough but very similar to a large stale cracker. The toppings didn't shine, with mediocre ingredients. For me, pizza is about the dough and fresh ingredients. Neither were executed properly. Thumbs down. Super down.Rhode Island Style Lobster Roll $9. One lobster roll, and the server makes it very clear. Miniature bun in refreshing blend of celery and spices. (If you're willing to dish a little more money out for a lobster roll, I recommend Pearl Oyster Bar, yes its pricey but if you got yourself a couple more of these minis, it'd cost you more and be a big mistake. Trust me.Out of respect for food blogging, I mentioned all 8. There are many more dishes on the menu. I'm sure there are great ones but in conclusion I'd opt out on this place if I was famished and impatient. I am most of the time. These are tapas, so definitely don't hope to be stuffed if you're willing to pay a big premium. Very Appropriate to go with friends to catch up and have drinks and people watch. If you don't mind the crowd and noise, give this a try. Decor is invitingly trendy and busy.After dinner, we had to stop at a Thai restaurant for some more grub...

5.0,12/13/2011,The Stanton Social was very social. The restaurant is an A+ in my book. It is an upscale tapas place with great variety of food. It was reasonably priced and portions were small because of the tapas style. I went with my girlfriend and shared 5 plates. I heard of the Stanton Social from Food Network the judge Chris Santos from Chopped is co-owner. One of his dishes has been highlighted on Food Network the French Onion Soup Dumplings and now know why it was highlighted. The dumplings were amazing. Another amazing dish was the social MacNCheese. The service was wonderful the waitress was very helpful and attentive not overly attentive but enough to have our dishes out in a timely order.

5.0,12/12/2011,"Far and away my favorite brunch place in the city.  After my first visit, I went again a week later and again two weeks after that.  Great place to take out-of-town guests for an impressive, memorable experience they won't be able to replicate elsewhere.  It's hard to go wrong on the menu--the items range from the unforgettable to the very, very good--but for my money you can't pass up the Warm Doughnuts with Caramel Sauce, which arrive hot and fluffy and are an instant crowd-pleaser, the Red Snapper Tacos, which are light and have a delightful crunch, the Kobe Philly Slider with Truffle and Goat Cheese Fondue, which is exactly as rich and luxuriant as it sounds, and the Spicy Lobster Benedict, a decadent twist on a brunch classic.  Ordering can be tricky and it's easy to spend more here than you plan to, but the staff is friendly, if a bit overwhelmed, and happy to explain how tapas ordering works.  (For instance, an order of sliders is ONE slider).  The small portions are plated adorably and the food arrives in waves which gives the meal a lovely, relaxed pace.  Just as you're done ooh-ing and aah-ing over one dish, another arrives and the ooh-ing and aah-ing can begin all over again.  And the tapas style is perfect for dates or other social occasions.  Since everyone's having the same thing, you all instantly have something in common to talk about.   And talk about it you will.Can't recommend it highly enough.  Go.",0,0,0,Nate W.,"Long Island City, NY",1,3,1

ONE slider?  To top it off, we got the sliders with cheese and jalapeno bacon, and they were just a grilled cheese with jalapeno bacon...No actual burger to be seen.  Tasty, but at $7 a piece, no way I would repeat that order. Sorry for the slider rant, but anyways, she was nice and attentive enough, but just not that waitress you just love.  The food was pretty good, but not exceptional.  We shared the short rib tacos, wild mushroom pizzette, butternut squash ravioli, chipotle shrimp.  It was a tasty meal but overall, not exceptional.

You eat with your eyes first right?!Anyway, we ordered 4 dishes; snapper tacos (which were TEEENY TINY) - be warned!, the dumplings, chorizo mac & cheese and chicken and waffles.I have to say I think the mac and chicken were my faves, the snapper my least fave and the dumplings in the middle.  These are sharing plates so be prepared. The mac and chicken were a bit more substantial.  Overall the food was pretty good. I don't think I'll be running to go back.  I've been told I was there once for brunch and it seems familar looking at some menu items; but this review is based on my dinner, so no comment on anything else.",0,0,0,Jen G.,"Orlando, FL",37,171,64

We got the french onion soup dumplings that everyone and their mother said were amazing and they were good but the truth is that the other things on the menu were even better.

The red snapper tacos were tasty but overall didn't leave a lasting impression. The piquillo pepper bruschetta was average, barely memorable.  The potato & goat cheese pierogies had too much goat cheese.   The biggest disappointment of the group was the french onion soup dumplings which were too doughy with barely any soup.  Service is as pretentiousness as the food.  For my next visit to the Lower East Side, I'll make sure to skip The Stanton Social.",6,7,5,Gloria G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",81,216,109

3.0,10/24/2011,"My husband and I had dinner on Saturday night at The Stanton Social while in town for the weekend. This was actually 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding down because nothing really just jumped out at us to make it four star worthy. Everything about our dinner experience was fine, but nothing really wowed us.For drinks, my husband had the Strawberry Fields which I tried and enjoyed. He liked the fresh muddled strawberries in it. I had the 1940s Champagne Julip which was also good, although it had a little too much basil. For food we had caesar salad crostini (amuse bouche), chicken arepas, green apple and brie quesadilla, chipotle grilled shrimp, chicken and waffles, butternut squash and sweet potato ravoli, and the herb fries. Our favorite dish was the chicken arepas (it was definitely the standout of the night) with the chicken and waffles also being good, although it needed a touch more maple syrup. The ravoli was my least favorite dish by far so I left that to my husband to eat. The husband was disappointed in the shrimp dish (he felt it needed more heat), but I thought it was fine. We both felt the quesadilla needed more brie. We skipped dessert as none really stood out on the menu. For our two drinks, the food, tax and tip, our bill came to $130The atmosphere is definitely trendy with music playing, so make sure to speak up if you want your dining companion to hear you. The bathrooms are on the third level (along with more seating and the bar) with only two unisex stalls available, so be prepared to wait a little.Overall it was a fine experience, but I won't be running back on my next NYC visit.",0,0,0,Melissa H.,"Washington, DC",325,464,0

I brought some friends here on Sunday night that were from LA as well because I was raving about the french onion soup dumplings. Reservations were easy to get the same day - made a reservation for 8:30pm for 6 guests (we were coming from an industry function earlier). It did take us a little longer than anticipated to arrive at the restaurant - so we ended up being 15 minutes late. Upon arrival, I gave my name to the hostess and she said, ""yes I know your name and you are late. Your table is not available, they are having dessert, so you can wait upstairs at the bar"". Okay fine.. well, considering we were a little late, we're fine with waiting a bit. 30 minutes later, I went back down to ask the hostess if our table was ready yet, and she said no, but they're paying. Ughh! 45 minutes later, I asked our server to check again because I said even though we were late, it doesn't mean you make us wait 45 minutes for our table again! The server was really rude, and said.. well, this is not something I normally do, but I'll go check. Then she comes back to say, well you were late, so they had to wait for another table. Yes people, we know we were late, but this is ridiculous! My other friend overheard how rude the server was being to me, so she personally went down to speak with the manager. The mgr checked the time of our reservation, and was totally appalled and how long we had been waiting, and immediately arranged to sit us down. Hmmm.. what happened to the no available table?! Well, the mgr though did salvage the night by giving us a round of champagne and some appetizers to apologize to us for the wait.

I've been there twice and both times my party was extremely happy with the food, the timeliness of serving, the drinks, the whole package.But I will throw in that this past Saturday night, we were greeted by the most pretentious host I have ever come into contact with. He won't look/talk to you if he's fidgeting around on his computer, and will completely ignore you if you speak with him before he gives you the time of day. He asked me what my name was 3 times when I told him we'd be sitting by the bar, in case he called. I know it's hard for them to keeping everyone in mind, but for some reason, no host in my experience has ever been that terrible with remembering names. And if his one-worded answers aren't enough for you, beware the rolling of the eyes.And don't forget your ID at home, this will make morose doorman very angry and watchful once you're seated for dinner. He stalked my sister to make sure she wasn't having a drink with her dinner. Now, with this aside. Our waitress was wonderful, attentive, informed. We tried almost everything on the menu. The highlights were:Nori Spiced Tuna Tartare Roll: Small bites of wonderful, meaty, tuna flavorThe spicy miso glazed edamame: I know it's just edamame, but I don't think I've ever sucked dry the peel to get every single ounce of sauce onto my tastebuds. My sister and I wondered why nobody ever thought of dressing edamame with more than just salt and lime before.Beef wellington: Doughy, cooked juuust right, tender and flavorfulFrench Onion Soup Dumplings: Don't. Miss. This.And please, for the sake of your sweet tooth, please try the doughnuts.

Salty, cheesy, creatively constructed - they're everyone's favorite.  We also tried:Red Snapper TacosChicken ArepasShort Rib Soft TacosVegetarian Ravioliand Lobster RollsThere really wasn't anything I disliked.  Red snapper tacos and lobster rolls were probably the crowd favorites.  For dessert, the fresh cookies are INSANE, and the warm doughnuts with chocolate, raspberry and caramel dipping sauces are fun too.The service wasn't the best I've ever had - the waiter forgot my drink order completely - but we did have a huge group of 15 people with a variety of drink demands.  Come with a big group for a special occasion, and everyone will have a good time and be able to easily find something they like.",0,0,0,Emily R.,"Manhattan, NY",452,361,4

4.0,10/11/2011,"I had been wanting to try Stanton Social for a while and I finally made it to brunch there recently.  It was definitely worth the wait.  Some favorites:1) Kobe Philly - don't think, order, it's the best thing on the menu.  I was skeptical of the goat cheese (I like it in general, but on a Philly?), but it was absolutely fantastic.2) Short rib arepas - these were unreal, tons of flavor, but all perfectly balanced.  Word to the wise - eat it in one bite or it will fall apart all over the table and you will be sad that you didn't get more of it.3) Banana pancakes - exactly sweet enough, these pancakes are fluffy and wonderful.4) Breakfast bruschetta - I'm not a picky eater, but I am picky about eggs, and these were perfect.I was also a big fan of the pierogies, red snapper tacos, mac & cheese, and, of course, the famous French onion soup dumplings.  The drinks are also highly delicious and they have creative concoctions that will hit the spot, no matter what kind of mood you're in (I recommend the cranberry fizz).  The one miss were the chicken & waffles - not a fan at all, it was a highly average piece of chicken on a below average ""waffle"" (it was more like a weird blob of cooked dough than an actual waffle).Stanton Social is a great brunch spot, I can't wait to go back!",0,0,0,Annette M.,"New York, NY",228,263,0

5.0,10/8/2011,"Another win. Came with a buddy from out of town and another friend, living here but has never been.We only got seated around 10:45 but the place was still packed so it didn't feel like a late dinner at all. Putting ambiance, service, lighting, music aside, let's get to the food:French onion soup dumplings: Always a winner, but this was my third time here and third time having them. I'm getting over it slowly.Arepas: Not sure how these are considered arepas, but they are damn good. Nice spicy sauce and lots happening.Octopus: We thoroughly enjoyed it, but I suspect that we liked it more because it was our first dish and we were ravenous. Looking back, it was just alright.Meatballs: Probably prefer the meatball factory (of course) but these monstrous balls of deliciousness were definitely super.Kobe philly slider: the winner. Get it. You'll be happy you did.Beets: sweet, grilled very well, really nice light compliment to heavy, rich tapas.Chocolate tasting: Not sure why three of us dudes got this, definitely overkill, but that's the name of the game at Stanton Social. The chocolate ice cream has a wicked spice to it, that only kicks in after you've finished the ice cream. Really cool. The peanut butter on a stick was a bit rich for me (yet I finished it...) the mint chocolate was a nice touch and the coconut balls with more chocolate was so good. By the time we got to the pudding and warm chocolate cake, I was ready to explode. There was more (we have 3 dishes each), but that will suffice for this review. To recap: Food is amazing, service is good, music is good (although they repeated a couple of songs, and were generally not very creative with their selection - kind of chose obvious tunes/remixes), price is a touch on the steep side (which is expected) but as a treat once in a while, I highly recommend this place.",1,1,1,Ilan M.,"Manhattan, NY",8,94,0

Crabcake Corn Dogs were something I immediately regretted ordering as soon as I said it (think mealy bits of crab encrusted in a sad non-crisp cornbread batter) and the Chicken Arepas were just like a dried taco filling on top of a tiny dry cake of cornmeal.

3.0,9/27/2011,"I was a bit disappointed when I came here last weekend. First, we were seated upstairs which I don't think is as nicely decorated as the bottom floor. We asked the waitress how many tapas we should order per person and she told us 2-3. HOWEVER, once the food came out, we definitely knew we had to order more. THE PICTURES ARE DECEIVING. The food here is TINY. I think that was all of our reactions when the food started rolling out. The tacos are literally an inch and a half wide and the philly cheesesteak can be finished off in two bites. The dessert however was amazing! The pumpkin pie sundae and the chocolate tasting are must-haves! But overall, definitely think this place is overrated.I'm not sure if I would come here again but I would definitely recommend the french onion dumplings, chicken and waffles, pumpkin pie sundae and chocolate tasting for first-timers!",0,0,1,Erica S.,"Manhattan, NY",318,212,26
3.0,9/27/2011,"I'll start off by saying that the food is unbelievably delicious. My girl friend and I must have ordered one of half the menu. I wish they had larger portions but I get the order of things.My one problem with this place was the professionalism. When we first got upstairs, we were told that we can sit somewhere temporarily until a more comfortable spot opens. Eventually, one spot opened and the waitress tells us that we can move into the booth only to come back two minutes later and advise us that there is another party coming in and they need the booth. It's not really a booth but it's the easiest way for me to describe it. Not only were we told to move but it was even into to a spot that was even more uncomfortable than the first. Who wants to be uncomfortable while eating?There are two reasons why they get three stars. First, because the food was flawless. Second, when my girl friend and I were about to leave, the waitress with long blond hair stopped us from leaving. The place was packed and she made sure that we got a spot that was nice and comfortable. She saved the day.",0,0,1,L C.,"Elmhurst, NY",12,26,11

I could guzzle down 10 or so, if they weren't $13 a pop.Some of the stand-outs were the pierogies with truffle creme fraiche, short rib tacos, octopus, and the bacon/apple/brie quesadilla. The flavors were great with those dishes. A side note about the octopus too: I generally don't eat octopus. I think it's too chewy and fishy, personally. However, this octopus was cooked properly, and with a nice savory sauce.Service was attentive, and they swapped out the plates halfway through so that all the flavors from the many small plates wouldn't run together.

I guess we were lucky because it was not too packed and we were able to sit down without any hassle in one of the two couch areas. The lounge area upstairs is small and lively. The vibe is sexy and upbeat--dark and candlelit, decorated with mirrored panels and a pretty red blossom design, there's a good mix of music old and new and totally loud, and dancing is in full effect. The cocktails ($14) are AMAZING, superbly thought out and very well prepared. Loved the Social Tea, Strawberry Fields, and Brooklyn Lemonade. Another great night here.

The french onion soup dumplings are delectable, i found myself shamelessly scraping the melted Gruyere cheese off the sides of the plate; undoing my previous attempt at elegance. The four chipotle grilled shrimps were excellent and perfectly flavored. We shared one of the kobe beef burgers, which was cooked to perfection. We decided we were still hungry so we shared a mac & cheese to finish off and all I could say was ""OH YUM"". Oh... we also had grilled asparagus, it was as good as asparagus can be.Don't judge us, the plates are small and our lovely waitress even asked us if we wanted any more food, so some people order more than us apparently.

I am so glad I headed in for my first visit with some great friends during our spring break trip.My latest outing there was just a few evenings ago with 3 friends who had never been to Stanton Social before. I had raved about it so much that I really hoped that it wouldn't disappoint.... of course it didn't!Every single dish we ordered was fantastic and there was not a single morsel left on any plate! (Word of note - i truly likes EVERY single thing we ordered!)Ordered:**Edamame - loved the unique preparation!

Divine!** Maryland Jumbo Lump Crabcake ""Corn dogs"" - fun and very tasty!** Chicken & Waffles - the idea of the 2 together still makes me chuckle                         but my taste buds love it!** Thai spiced baby back ribsThe service was excellent. Our waitress was very attentive and very helpful in making suggestions of options we might want to consider trying. Everything she recommended that we tried was right on the mark!

(39). But the food more than made up for the negatives. We ordered a lot. We had the pirogues, which were my favorite. Hollah! Also the french onion soup dumplings were delicious. Jovanie and Rich both loved the red snapper tacos. We were none of crazy about the crab cake corn dog. It was a little too dense for me.Or maybe i just don't like any type of corn dog ,period. The lamb souvlakis was also a shining star in our book. I licked (literally) that plate clean. The mac and cheese was good but i was so full that by the time it came out,i could barely finish half of it. And to think that i had also drunkenly tried to order a trio of sliders.

5.0,8/18/2011,"After a long time of debating this establishment , I finally was able to go for a family birthday celebration. First of all finding this place is a bit difficult because the name is so small and barely seen.its right int he middle of the block. Upon arrival we were greeted by the hostess and we were promptly seated in a small but cozy booth in the corner. It was 3 of us and we fit comfortably and with pIenty  was all very dimly lit with both lamps and candle all around the dining area. The waitress came over and took our drink orders and the drinks promptly arrived a few minutes later. The staff overall was excellent . They were uber friendly and attentive is an understatement between each serving of the various plates a waitres came over and gave us new clean plates. Someone was constantly cleanin or clearing our plates as we finished or filling our water or folding our unsused napkins. The french onion soup dumplings are a MUST try!! They have to be one of your plates. Sometimes I debate just ordering 4 plates of the dumplings because they are just that fantastic. Everything else is pretty good too. It is all seasoned well, well-cooked  and tastes fresh.  I have tried  the red snapper tacos, the Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies, Sweet & Sour Chicken & Cashew Spring Roll, hand pulled chicken arepas,Maryland Jumbo Lump Crabcake 'Corn Dogs,Chipotle Grilled Shrimp  - tomatillo & feta relish, and the Spicy Lamb Souvlakis - tzatziki, lime, harissa aioli. Out of all those my least favorite were the pierogies only because I did not realized they were fried and I don't really like them fried. They are a bit too oily. The hand pulled arepas are so small they are very crispy but none the less delicious. I had the warm donuts and the Strawberry shortcake sundae for dessert. Both were pretty good but I preferred the sundae. I recommend making reservations because it gets pretty packed regardless of the night. I have not tried he drinks but they looked pretty good. They have full bar and wine selections. Its a nice place that you might just past by and not even notice because the only sign is really small and on the door. This is definitely a must go to place in NYC.  So good its been featured on the Food Network. I am a big foodie and always goes to places featured on the Food Network shows and they have yet to fail me. Do not hesitate to try this place you will not regret it.   Remember people this is a tapas bar so everything is extremely small you will need several plates. And my only other complaint is that several of the plates come in 3's of whatever the food is, which does not make much sense if it's only 2 people sharing. There are plates that come in 4's. Besides that just go so you can understand why this is so amazing!!",2,0,1,Eileen R.,"Ridgewood, NY",7,12,16
5.0,8/18/2011,"This place concocts interesting tapas covering a plethora of tastes... four of us ordered eight plates and we were stuffed. I especially liked the Kobe Philly with truffle & goat cheese fondue ~ the goat cheese adds a kick but pairs nicely with the meat slices. The famous French Onion Soup Dumplings were also delish with hot soup enclosed within the dumpling shell all smothered with cheese and herbs. Even the simple Skillet Roast Octopus consisted of very tender octopus pieces drizzled with garlic, sherry vinegar, and pieces of chorizo. Maybe I was slightly underwhelmed by the Kobe Beef Burgers and the Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies, but they were still good, just didn't taste too special.

4.0,8/16/2011,"Rating: 3.75, Date Dined: 7/21/2011We were a group of five ladies celebrating a birthday. I'm wincing in giving this restaurant close to four stars because the service here is brusque and unwelcoming. The food on the other hand is surprisingly delicious. I've dined at Stanton Social 3-4 times over the past 6 years or so. The menu is largely unchanged but the execution of the food this visit was outstanding. I was frankly surprised at how much we liked it.Service & AtmosphereLet's get the downer out of the way. Yes this place is dark with a vibrant, sexy vibe. I have been upstairs for drinks before, which is also a great spot. However, they pack the entire restaurant to the gills. I think it's a fire hazard. You can barely move as they have table upon table of large group dinners. It's also deafeningly loud and hard to even hear someone across the table from you. 4 out of the 5 of us arrived within 10 minutes of the reservation and they said we could be seated if we started ordering immediately. I appreciate that as I'm sure most people have that one friend who is always running 30-45 minutes late. Our waitress was such a turnoff. She would approach, then when we didn't know within 10 seconds what we wanted to order she would promptly pivot and rush away. This happened several times and was annoying as it was impossible to wave her down through the throng of diners. When she finally returned, I ordered everything in one shot so that we could just go about enjoying our birthday dinner. Our waitress also barely cracked a smile and actually looked pained throughout the meal except when we started ordering more drinks and a second bottle of wine. She probably felt better that there was a bigger tip coming out of our table. But honestly her sourpuss did put a damper on the meal.Food & DrinksAs this is a small plates format, I'll group the foods into general categories. The only dish I did not enjoy was the red snapper tacos. I've had these before here and they were not good this time around as the fish was neither hot nor cold and it did not taste fresh. The dishes that were solid were the East and West coast oysters, the amuse bouche of ceasar salad on a crostini, the foie gras, the beef wellington and the lobster roll. The other ladies loved the skillet roast octopus, soaking up the sauce with pieces of bread. I thought it was only ok, having had much better (more tender) octopus the weekend before at Craftbar. The outstanding dishes really made the meal memorable. The French onion soup dumplings were amazing. I've had these on two other occasions before and thought they were always dry and lacking. This time around they were soupy, cheesy and very flavorful. The kobe beef slider (not cheap at $7 a pop) was juicy and intense. Lastly, the Thai spiced baby back ribs are something I'll be thinking about for a while. The sauce was mildly spicy, mildly sweet and the meat fell off the bone and melted in your mouth. Wow. I would go back just to eat the ribs again. We also had 2 bottles of sauvignon blanc and 4 mixed drinks. By the time dessert came, we were very full. We had a strawberry shortcake sundae and the warm doughnuts. Both were objectively amazing but our enthusiasm was somewhat muted by the fact that we had already eaten so much delicious food.While the small plates seem reasonably priced on the menu, each plate only comes with 2-3 portions, which had to be ""upsized"" to 5 portions for our group. This quickly added up and our bill including all of the alcohol came out to $92 per person if we had split it evenly. The consistently delectable food is what made this meal enjoyable. The service and atmosphere is really a matter of one's tolerance level and preference for a specific type of scene.",1,0,0,Nancy B.,"New York, NY",13,18,12

4.0,8/9/2011,"RECOMMEND:Crab cake ""corn dogs"" - Amazing!! My favorite of the tapas we tried.French onion soup dumplings - Delicious. Tastes just like good French onion soup.Kobe beer burger - Tiny but deliciousChocolate Tasting - So many decadent desserts! The best value order.Doughnuts - Yummy! And they come with three dipping sauces to make them even yummier.Mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwich - Very small, but those few tiny bites were enjoyable. It's a crunchy chocolate shortbread wafer, not a soft cookie.Strawberry shortcake sundae - Pretty good, but you could get this anywhere.JUST OK:QuesadillasRed snapper tacosMac & cheeseThe birthday dessert is a cheap cupcake that looks very unappetizing compared to the desserts we ordered. It's kind of not worth it to tell the server if it's someone in your party's birthday.Stanton Social seems really pricey but all this split among 5 people (with no drinks though) was $28 including tax and tip.

3.0,8/8/2011,"2 words: STICKER SHOCK!!!whoever crafted this menu is not only a masterchef but a master marketer!! I'm sure Chris Santos is off on his yacht somewhere enjoying his fortunes. =)Everything we had here was decent to great!! and then there was the UGLY!!! If you've eaten here, you know what that UGLY is....so let's start off with the...The Great!!-red snapper tacos (1st place) bite size, flavorful and delicious, 3 to an order, too bad they were made for smurfs and not humans. =D-wok seared lobster pasta (close runner-up) (best value dish on menu)-crab cake corn dogs (3rd place) (nice twist on crab cakes, had good flavor but stingy with the crab meat, 3 to an order)- french onion dumplings (4th place) a bit overrated, a good dish to try but not the ""best cheese"" dish I ever ate...The decent but forgettable!! -kobe beef sliders (was way too salty) -wasabi crusted salmon (lacked pizzazz, crust has too hard)-chicken & waffles (basically they cut up a piece of chicken breast and a waffle and served it 8 ""bite"" size ways, nothing special, worst value dish on menu)-braised ribs. (fall off the bone tender but too salty again)-herb dusted fries (too salty and a total rip off $7 for a rice bowl amt )common theme: the kitchen loves to toss the SALT around!!!so here comes The UGLY:Since there were 7 of us, they ""proportion"" the plate so each of us can have one. I thought this was nice of the waitress so we all get to try one.By the end of the night, we had gorged up a $500+ food bill for 7 peeps and we didn't even drink. 13 sliders alone was $91. We thought maybe the slider came in an order of 2-3 but NOPE it was $7 each!!!same for other items...so BEWARE, small plates aren't really small plates, The menu doesnt tell you how many items come in each ""small plate"" and neither do the waitress. Cleverly Deceptive!! They really should just price everything per item. Since it's almost billed that way. I can't recommend this place due to the high price/small portion ratio, but if you do decide to go, just stick to the ""GREAT"" items listed above.",2,0,0,David C.,"New York, NY",9,88,4

4.0,7/28/2011,"My two cousins brought me here to try their French Onion Soup Dumplings.  The rest, as they say, is history.A few words on the execution of the plating: it is all very inventive and experimental.  The food is masterfully crafted with a rich blend of flavors and textures that I have not found any place else.  Each dish we tried was more than just food; it was an exercise in creativity, in intellectualism, in art and technique and craft.  It was surprising and sublime and tasteful.  I have never been so amazed at a restaurant.  At least, never pleasantly so.  I found myself waiting to see what the next dish would look like, how the chef would blend flavors and shapes and techniques.  Some of the food tasted exemplary; others were merely satisfying.  But the effort on the part of execution - that was flawless.A few words on the decor: the restaurant had a lovely distressed look to it.  The wine room was upstairs, which also had additional seating. The place is a bit dim, but it is very cozy.  The music is not too loud, the waiters don't get in the way but are always available, so it's a good spot to go with friends if you are interested in talking to them and actually hearing their responses.  The bathroom was weird.  It was sexier than most bedrooms.  Votive candles, very nice napkins,  dark walls, etc..  I was looking around for a masseuse and a bed.  Flushing made me feel almost guilty.What we had: Potato and Goat Cheese Pierogies with Truffle Creme Fraiche:  Egads, there is a God.  Order more than one plate.  Fight for every piece.  Trust me on this one.French Onion Soup Dumplings: These place is evidently famous for this dish.  Although it was good, I did not drop dead from surprise. It was good, but not great.Chicken & Waffles: a surprising meeting of sweet and savory.  Usually I'm not a big fan of this sort of thing, but these knocked my socks off.  The chicken was cook to perfection - tender, juicy, perfectly seasoned.  the waffle was everything a waffle should be.  And the balsamic spiked maple syrup that comes on top of it was able to tie everything together just so...tastefully.  :)  Crab cake corn dogs: Ah, the chef tripped over his laces on this one.  It was a fun dish but lacked flavor and the cornmeal completely dominated the crab.  The only saving grace was the cool skewer it came on and the very thinly shredded turnips in the corn sauce.Enjoy!",3,1,2,Jamal K.,"Houston, TX",73,15,0
1.0,7/27/2011,"Are you a celebrity?  A glutton for punishment?  Do you use drugs that quell your appetite?  Were you not able to get a reservation at a ""restaurant"" in the Meatpacking District tonight?  Are you nine feet tall with a ten foot wingspan such that you can reach over a mob of slick New Jerseyans to grab a drink from a bar?  If you answered 'yes' to any of these questions, The Stanton Social is your place.  AWESOME, BRO!WAIT!  I know what you're thinking: ""Oh, he had one bad experience, he's a holier-than-thou hipster, he's just a player hater, he must be POOR.""  Before you stop reading, hear me out.  I had never heard of The Stanton Social before going, and I went with an open mind.  I should have known from the bouncer at the door that this restaurant wasn't for me, but venture in I did.  After gaining admittance, my poor ugly face was quickly whisked to a dark corner of the already un-lit upstairs and I was seated on what appeared to be an ottoman for midgets.  Once I positioned myself on the midget ottoman in the only way that wouldn't cut off my circulation, I readied myself to order a drink. This proved to be an exercise in futility as the waitstaff was far too cool to take orders, a reasonable disposition considering they had probably never met someone in whose gelled-up hair they couldn't see their reflection.  They likely passed me off as a homeless drifter who was setting up camp for the night in a dark corner of their trendy 'nightspot.'  Fortunately, I soon discovered that I could navigate my way to the bar by crawling under the bridges of the sequined 30-inch heels worn by the hoard of tweens forming a mosh-pit at the bar.  Delightful.  Aghast at the very concept of ordering a glow-in-the-dark cocktail mixed by some wannabe model, I ordered an overpriced Bud Light and a shot.  When it finally came time to order my meal, I craned my neck up at what millions years of evolution have deemed the perfect female prototype.  I didn't bother asking any questions about the menu as (a.) I couldn't read the menu in the dark, and (b.) it was clear our waitress had never eaten anything in her life and would only regurgitate whatever description was already written on the menu just like she had regurgitated everything else that may have accidentally wound up in her mouth over her precious twenty years of hating her father.  I got the damn dumplings and some pizza. The Stanton Social does have a few things going for it. They play bumpin' club music with killer bass and (probably) have some self-loathing, tattooed celebrity chef manning the kitchen, hating the fact that his bite-sized creations become frat-boy upchuck hours after being made.  If that's your thing, this is your place.

We found out why once we were seated, but more on that later. A few of us arrived early and were directed upstairs to the bar/lounge area. Initial observations:1. the music was WAY to loud2. The bartender was incredibly rude (hey, I get it, bartending is a tough job, but when asked for a beer, he replied ""Yeah, everybody wants something."" and then walked away. Beer then showed up at a glacial pace. I was too scared to ask for water after that.)Once we were seated, it was quite clear why the hostess expressed some concern over large mammals. The table was tiny. It was like trying to fit the population of China in a shoebox. On top of that, the music in the main dining area was even louder than in the lounge. And it was bad euro-trance. It felt like we were eating in the middle of a club. Prior reviews regarding the bathroom were quite on point; there is only one, so expect to wait if it's busy.The food was actually quite good. That was the only plus. Moral of the story: if you live in Brooklyn, and/or are over the age of 30, and/or aren't interested in being surrounded by meathead frat-boys in a psuedo-club that happens to serve food, find somewhere else to eat.

If it was less expensive, it'd be easier to like, but for the price, I can't justify it. It should be better and it's not. For the price, there should be more depth of flavor, a more layered approach to flavors. Instead, the food's mostly one note w/ some other flavors thrown in that don't offend, but don't stand out enough for you to figure them out.

3.0,7/11/2011,"Alrite, I'll preface my review by stating i'm not local to NYC, but that I was merely visiting a family member when i decided to go to the Stanton Social. I had heard great things about it, so I figured I'd take my bf and see what the hype was all about. My sister even mentioned that a reservation should be made days or weeks in advance. How could something that exclusive be bad? Right?!?! hmm???I went on a Saturday evening with my bf.where we both decided, because of the restaurant's hype to dress up for dinner. Unfortunately I don't think everyone else that was at the restaurant got the hint that the restaurant was a little less casual than a TGI Fridays...That got me a little irritated. It's always great to see people in a t-shirt and sweats, or whatever the case may be, at a place like the Stanton Social.Nevertheless, as I was distracted by the casual diners, I also was distracted by the fact that the food was just average. The menu definitely was great for vegetarians, but it didn't have that wow factor I thought it would. We had the gnocchi, asparagus, sliders and some other dishes, finishing off with the massive chocolate plate. My bf seems to think the best thing we had that night was the variety chocolate plate, I disagree, but, whatever. I like the ambiance of the place, however, if you're looking to have a chat with the people you're dining with, that might be tough. It can get loud and it is dark, but that's not too bad.

4.0,7/11/2011,"So until last week I felt pretty left out. How come everyone gets to try the Stanton Social but me? I finally made it there for a hot date with Theo since I had been begging to go for some time. Since this place is ever-popular, I was surprised Theo got us a rezzie for a Thursday night, prime time. Turns out AMEX concierge services helped him out. I guess that's for another review. In any event, we sauntered (yes, I sauntered) inside, we were directed upstairs to the bar for a cocktail or two before dindin. I ordered the Manhattan Sidecar  and sipped it while trying to look sexy (not for Theo, but to match the crowd) and enjoyed it very, very much. Someone came and got us at some point and I followed her (while doing my very best to saunter) to our table downstairs. My my, this place is like the definition of swank and sex. Exposed beams, pretty wallpaper, snuggly tables, low lighting, mmm mmm good. We heard from the waiter that these dishes were meant to share. We perused the menu, I ordered another Manhattan Sidecar and we were off to the races. Theo and I rarely agree on dishes to share, but finally chose four that would make us both happy:1. French Onion Soup Dumplings - These were at the suggestion of our waiter, and he was right, they are incredible.2. Sweet & Sour Chicken and Cashew Spring Rolls - Not my favorite, but pretty good anyway, I would eat them again.3. Zucchini Tempura - YES PLEASE. Probably the best zucchini anything I have ever eaten. Yep, ever. 4. Spicy Lamb Souvlakis - I saved the best for last. How do you fit so much goodness in one tiny lamb bite? Clever chefs, always leave me wanting more. After licking my fingers clean (again, trying to be sexy...but I just don't think I am very good at that) and ordering another Sidecar, I was full and happy and frankly very tired. The excitement really got to me. Well, the excitement and the noise. Stanton Social had only one negative that I can see - it was crazy, headache inducing, ballpark-after-a-homerun-loud. I could barely hear Theo across our tiny table and when I did, I was keeping the conversation light, since I didn't want to scream personal information to him since the tables on either side of us were packed in really close.Once we left and my full and no longer sexy self dropped into a cab for the ride back to the UES, Theo and I agreed that The Stanton Social is perfect for girls night out, but a hot date? We will try something a little quieter next time, but hopefully the food is equally good. Stanton Street Win.",8,4,5,Lauren B.,"New York, NY",485,391,60
5.0,7/10/2011,"Went in on a Saturday night as a party of 4 without a reservation (crazy, huh). They were very accommodating and managed to get us a table upstairs in the bar/lounge area. We had to wait about 2 hours at the bar (which wasn't a problem since their drinks are soooo good), and it was a tight squeeze on our small table; but when you show up at a place like this without a reservation you take whatever you can get. I think we literally ordered 1 of almost everything on the menu. I don't eat red meat or fish, so I can't speak for those, but my personal fav's were the french onion dumplings and edamame. The chicken & waffles almost made me throw up in my mouth a little, although the guys at our table loved it.  Definitely an awesome place overall.

We came here around midnight, but the staff was still gracious and sat us right away in a really comfortable booth near the front.Our server was awesome -- I don't remember his name, but he had that aloof yet friendly hipster air about him. I ordered the Strawberry Fields cocktail, which was really refreshing and delicious. My boyfriend wasn't as big a fan of his Brooklyn Lemonade.They brought us a complimentary taster of a new dish, caesar salad bites, while we waited for our food. They were good, but not even big enough for one satisfying bite (and not worth the $7 or $8 they'd probably charge for it). We ordered:French Onion Soup Dumplings: Not as impressive as I'd hoped. I was thinking this might be actual french onion soup with dumplings in it, but instead the dish consisted of several dumplings smothered in onions and cheese on toothpicks. Interesting concept and not bad in execution, but I wouldn't say I'd go out of my way to eat this again.Red Snapper Tacos: Incredible. Three tiny tacos with so much flavour packed into them. I could've eaten three more plates of these.Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies: Pretty good, but too heavy on the cream. Not sure why it's considered one of their signature dishes.Grilled Pizzetta: We technically didn't order this. We meant to order the bruschetta, but they brought this out to us instead, and we didn't realise it until we got our check (although I did wonder the whole time while our bruschetta was more like flatbread). It was your standard cheese pizza with a spicy kick. Definitely the most filling thing we ate.We'd expected to order more than four dishes, but we were stuffed despite the small portions.

If I could have talked, the entire meal would have been devoured by my table and I would have been left with nothing.Yay for vague generalities. Instead of bombarding you with details get the following and you too will be left speechless:1. French Onion Soup Dumplings: It's French Onion Soup. Umami heaven in dumpling form. Soup as bread. Fantastic effing idea. The melted cheese on top is so perfectly seasoned with an almost-crusty mozzarella texture and soft Parmesan bite that I not-so-discretely ate the remnants off the dish. 2. Yeah...Miss Manners can go drink a liter of vodka for that one...or a few legitmate Black Velvets. Guinness and champagne? Yes.3. Everything else on the menu.4. The Chocolate Tasting: This feels like an explosion of cacao in your mouth. The panna cotta was okay...the peppermint patties were not quite as explosive as Thin Mints...but that CHOCOLATE DULCE DE LECHE ICE CREAM was as smooth as any caramel sauce and as solidly ice cream as real gelato.

Lets just start it off with the fact that EVERYTHIGN was good and full of flavor. While the kobe beef burger was good, it didn't wow me as much as everything else and I'd recommend passing on this and getting something else. The pulled pork was a little better and served on a biscuit. The one thing that was absolutely the best was the nori tuna. It was the BEST tuna I've ever had and just thinking about it makes my mouth water. This is a MUST have and the next time I go, I'm ordering two.

It was everything you want in a Beef Wellington plus more! The Foie was a nice touch and didn't overwhelm the dish. When you cut into the pastry the wonderful smell of Truffle fills the air.Their cocktails are really delicious as well; a bit pricey (in fact more pricey than a majority of the small plates that we ordered).As far as the atmosphere, it was blasting music like I was in a gay nightclub, and it was really loud where it makes it hard to have any conversation (which is ironic because it's the Stanton ""Social"").

4.0,6/19/2011,"The Stanton Social is a really cool place.  Typical New York, unassuming from the outside and stunning on the inside.  The layout of the restaurant was really inventive, they have 3 floors but really only 2.5 because the 2nd floor only had space for two large tables.  The top floor is a bar and the bottom floor is the main dining area.The 'Social' is considered a Tapas bar.  So we ordered a bunch of small dishes and everyone shared, it's sort of a fun way to have dinner!  As others have noted, the service was very very good and the restaurant seemed very well staffed, even the bathroom was spotless!  Please note that I said bathroom, they just have one and with the copious consumption of alcohol by it's patrons there is a possibility of a lineup.The food here was more than palatable, even bordering on divine.  The frequency of the food delivery was that of a well oiled machine.  It always seemed like there was a new plate arriving and we capped off our dinner with the Kobe beef sliders.  The sliders seemed like one of the more popular dishes as they were constantly being delivered to other tables.  Our meal ended with the presentation of the bill.  Yes, it was rather expensive for a group of 7 people but it was well worth it.  From the food to the service to the 'scenery,' I would definitely return.The Stanton Social, you get 4 stars because I can't give out a half star and feel like rounding down.",3,0,0,Adam K.,"New York, NY",61,106,0

2.0,6/18/2011,"I absolutely do not understand how this place has 4 stars. The food is by no means bad (If this was not a global review, food standing alone would get 3 stars), but for the price and the service it gets no more than 2.The music is so loud, you can barely speak to the person next to you. The place is packed, I get it, but when I'm paying $100 per person, I expect better service than TGI Friday's. The waiter did not come to check on anything and would take away platters with food still on them.. The bus boys were literally taking my plate from under me while my fork was in hand and I was chewing. On to the food.. 1. Goat cheese potato perogies- They are OK. There is a creamy sauce on them that is probably made with truffle oil that helps makes this dish very very tasty. 2. Kobe Beef Sliders- Also pretty good, but I have had wayyy better sliders.3. Snapper Tacos- Absolutely nothing special, not very flavorful, which I was surprised about bc people rave about them.4, Apple Quesadillas- Nothing special. 5. Meat Balls- Terribleeeee!!!! I couldn't get over how the sauce they were in tasted exactly like my school lunch back in JHS.I also had some chicken arepas, steak,  and donuts- all of them ehh.

They also switched out our app plates and de-crumbed our table between dishes. They were so attentive I was shocked!All items are served tapas style, so you have to order A LOT in order to be full. This resulted in a very large bill for 3 people, which is why I probably won't be back anytime soon.

4.0,6/11/2011,"My friend and I lovedddd this place!! We came here at 6pm on a Friday night which was good because it was not crowded and previous reviews have mentioned that tables of 2 are usually on top of each other. We left at about 7:30 and the restaurant was beginning to fill up. So come here early!The waitress was nice and helpful. She asked if it was our first time there and let us know that they recommend 2-3 plates per person. A bus boy then came with a complementary tasting of the caesar salad bites. A single, minuscule bite of caesar salad sandwiched between 2 circular pieces of crouton. If this was ever offered on the full menu, it'd be the biggest rip off ever! But we appreciated the free tasting because who doesn't love free stuff??We ordered to french onion soup dumplings, crab cake corn dogs, thai baby back ribs, and the red snapper tacos. Despite all the talk about the soup dumplings, they were just ALRIGHT. I was expecting more ""soup"" in them, like with xiao long baos. The star of the show were the red snapper tacos (each consisting of about 1.5 bites) but were absolutely amazing! The thai baby back ribs were surprisingly yummy. The meat was falling off the bone and extremely tender and juicy. The crab cake corn dogs sounded very innovative but upon tasting, the flavors were not as interested as they sounded. So my recommendations - red snapper fish tacos and thai baby back ribs!!! We ordered the warm doughnuts for dessert. These sugar coated fried doughs of perfection came 6 to an order, and with chocolate, raspberry and caramel dipping sauces. An excellent way to end your meal :]The meal was $120 including tip for 2 drinks, 4 plates, 1 dessert and 2 dessert shots.

The vibe is very lively, although with that comes a significantly loud noise level that I did not particularly enjoy.The food however, is the important thing, and I enjoyed a select number of dishes we ordered, particularly the potato & goat cheese pierogies and red snapper tacos - both delicious. Each small place is about $10 - $15, which I actually think is relatively decent for NYC tapas restaurant prices (which are never cheap to begin with). I was in a party of three and the waiter recommended we order 6-8 dishes, but we found 5 to be more than sufficient. I would recommend ordering less and adding more later on if need be.

Really, how could you not try something like that? Well, the place lived up to our expectations. We sampled a few different dishes, truly exploiting the meaning of the word brunch. We had french onion soup dumplings, goat cheese and potato perogis, bacon egg and cheese sliders and their waffles. We were honestly very impressed with all of them, with the dumplings taking home the prize. Yes, they were worth the hype. Each dish was carefully prepared and beautifully presented. We washed it all down with bloody marys - which were extra spicy and delicious. Unfortunately, no drinks are included for brunch here. The ambiance was as portrayed in the other reviews. Despite being the middle of the afternoon - it was so dark inside. They have an upper level with a decent amount of space overall, but if you are a party of 2, be prepared for your typical Manhattan row table. They have some nice round booths for larger parties. I can definitely see how this place must get super loud during dinner, but for brunch it was okay. The pricing was alittle steep for the amount of food you got. We were by no means hungry when we left, but keep in mind we went for brunch. I can definitely see how the tab would add up very quickly if you come for dinner. I would say 2-3 dishes per person to be enough for dinner. (Its tapas style) Overall, highly recommended for sure!

4.0,5/12/2011,"This restaurant is the ideal L.E.S. restaurant.  It's trendy, hip, and too cool for anywhere else in the city.  Inside you'll be amazed by the large glowing wine wall in a herringbone pattern, plush retro booths, fine lizard skin banquettes, fringe walls and modern chandeliers.  The dolled up patrons here makes it a perfect spot for people watching.  A great in-between pit-stop prior to bar hopping in the area.I made reservations for two.  The hostess asked us to wait in their bar/lounge, located on the top floor.  As we walk upstairs we could hear the music thumping.  The scene was young and vibrant.  Sleek leather couches/tables, square cocktail tables, and woodland/floral motif wallpaper instantly captures my eye.  Took us awhile to snake through the bar and order some drinks.  After 15 minutes of waiting, I was worried our hostess wouldn't be able to find us.  There was a mob of people upstairs.  We descended downstairs and just waited.  It didn't matter, we weren't seated until another 15 minutes had elapsed.    The place is so dark, I had to use my blackberry in order to see the menu.  Menu was varied, multi-ethnic and experimental.  There's something for everyone.  Prices ranging from $7 - $18 seems to be a great deal.  Until you find out the portions are no bigger than tapas sizes.  The idea here is shared plates, ideal for the non-committed.  You create your own meal and get a little sample of everything.  That can quickly add up.The order: 1) Goat cheese Perogies w/ caramelized onions and truffle creme fraiche.  Perogies (fried dumplings of unleavened dough) filled w/ herb infused goat cheese was delectable.  I'm no connoisseur of this Russian dish, but I like it.  Crispy fried outershell and creamy cheese worked perfectly together with just a dab of the smooth dipping sauce (truffle creme fraiche).2) Crabcake corndogs.  Juicy, lump crabmeat from Maryland encased in a blue corn meal batter, and skewered into wooden sticks.  It's a fun dish.  Nicely fried, the batter was hot and fluffy.  The interior is a flavorful mixture of crabmeat, Tabasco, chives and panko.  There's a corn-spiked dip to add a little more kick.3) Kobe Philly: thinly sliced kobe beef with truffle and goat cheese fondue.  This dish was yummy and gooey.  Only two bites worth.  The meat was very tender, while the truffle oil resonated through the cheesy sauce.  You can smell it.4) Rhode Island Style Lobster Roll:  Chunks of lobster w/ celery and mayo on a small brioche roll.  Another two bite roll.  It was light on the mayonnaise, but just too much celery for my liking.  It kinda dulled out the sweetness from the lobster meat.5) French Onion Soup Dumplings:  Their signature dish, this was our favorite of the night.  It has also appeared on an episode of ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate"".  Served in a escargot tray, each dumpling was like a spoonful of soup.  Tooth-picked in a buttery dough, the stewed onions generally found at the bottom of the soup was captured in this fried dough.  Nice balance of sweetness from the caramelized onions and savoriness from the beef broth.  The baked Gruyere and Parmesan formed a beautiful crust on top.  Once you hoist that sucker and place it in your mouth... the explosion of flavors is wonderful.  They really nailed the French Onion soup flavor!I have to deduct a star for the long wait and the background music... it was loud, maybe too loud.  You can't really have a conversation without shouting to the other person.  Other than that the whimsical, innovative, and fun offerings truly make this place unique.  With sex appeal oozing inside, this place will always be a draw with the young crowd.  It never fails to see groups of girls dining here on Weekends.  I admit, I sneaked quick glances at several tables... checking out the ""hot dishes"" not produced from Stanton's Kitchen.  Sorry Honey!",5,4,5,Jimmy N.,"Houston, TX",221,190,94

I understand that restaurants have this policy, but it was a birthday dinner and my friends are always tragically late.The apple and brie quesadillas are the most disappointing thing I've eaten here.

She heard about their French Onion soup dumplings through Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate. I'm a pretty avid watcher of teh show, so I was surprised that I did not see that episode. But again, this is why I love Manhattan; There's just so many places to try and visitors introduce me to some good eats! We only had time to try their French Onion Soup Dumplings and Red Snapper Tacos. The soup dumplings came out really cute in an escargot dish. The soup was a little too tangy; The little crouton on top helped a bit. But I would rather eat Xiao Long Bao soup dumplings (probably because I need meat). I enjoyed the Red Snapper Tacos more, but there was only 3 small bite-size tacos, so we each only had one small bite. Not to mention $9 for those 3 small one-bite tacos. You do the math. I don't mind the price, just make each at least 2 small bites worthDespite expensive for decent food, I would come back to try their dessert donuts that everyone is raving about.

2.0,5/5/2011,"My co-worker highly recommended this place after a visit two weeks ago, so I went ahead and booked a table for two. Here's how I would describe this place:Crowded - so much so I actually bumped elbows with the girl at the next table several times.Deafening - I was shouting at my boyfriend because the noise was so loud. And the restaurant kept turning the volume up, which didn't help matters in the slightest.Average - the food was just not that good. I started with the blood orange jalapeno cocktail which was much too sweet. If you're looking for a fantastic jalapeno cocktail go to Sunita instead. The sweet & sour chicken and cashew spring rolls were okay but nothing you couldn't get at a dozen other restaurants. My ravioli was actually cold, which is not how I prefer to eat my pasta, believe it or not.Expensive - now I knew we were heading out for tapas before we came here, but even for tapas the portions were small. We had to keep ordering food because after four small plates we were still gagging for food! At The Stanton Social, $15 gets you three or four bites. Annoying - the wait staff was relentless when it came to clearing plates. The moment my fork hit the plate someone would try to take it from me. Funny enough, we had to ask for more silverware because though they didn't expect you to eat off the same plate, they certainly thought you should use the same knife and fork.I wouldn't recommend this place - I think New York has better offerings.",2,0,0,Leslie S.,"Geneva, IL",12,322,256

Very friendly staff and waitress. Helps if you have had a gastric bypass as the portions for the $ really add up. Tuna Tartare was nice but not stellar, Mushroom Ravioli for $15 had me still hungry. Ketchup drowned the tiny Kobe burger. Lamb Souvlaki were very nice in a raita. Cocktails were good and wines by glass decent. BUT $150 without dessert (went to Dessert Truck on Clinton for Value For Money and quality) was too expensive. The second (and I mean that second) our plates looked vaguely done they were whipped away. So much so that I had to physically cling onto my plate to still use the dipping sauces and swat away bus boys.

Most of the plates come in multiples of three, so if you have a party of four, either order an extra serving or things will be a little awkward. Servings are rather small -- the tacos and arepas are TINY, and I actually wasn't super impressed by the chicken arepa. It was cold and too much guacamole made it mushy.

Who knew cucumbers and vanilla could be such best friends? FOOD: Kobe Philly Slider- this was a winner! The truffle flavor and goat cheese creaminess was pure heaven!! Pan Roasted Day Boat Scallops - Nice big scallops over a bed of enoki mushrooms in a coconut curry sauce. This was alright, nothing special. Chicken N' Waffles - who can resist fried chicken and waffles? This mouthwatering version was slightly different with an aged cheddar waffle and balsamic maple syrup, yum! Braised Short Rib Soft Tacos- exquisite poblano crème made this for me. Grilled Asparagus - with sea salt and lemon, this was cooked to perfection! I don't think I have had better asparagus EVER.

By far both of us favored this plate!!- Baby spinach salad: Very enjoyable dish... the corn must have had a little bit of chili powder because there was a bit of a kick to it... very tasty!- Red snapper tacos: Neither of us had tried red snapper before.. was good, but a bit fishy for both of our tastes. - Pizzetta: Very good; tasted like bruschetta on flat bread... fairly standard. Small wine menu, but the pinot grigiot was very good (and dry).The dislikes: VERY loud atmosphere.... you need to speak up a bit to hear over the loud music... and the 2-seater tables were very close together so you can hear other tables' conversations.On the whole, would definitely return for another meal....

2.0,4/24/2011,"I often refer to the Lower East Side as the more pretentious sibling of Williamsburg.  Let me explain.  Williamsburg is undisputedly the Mecca for hipsters: a land of bizzare sights and sounds.  The LES also attracts a good portion of hipsters, but the hipsters in the LES are more of your trust fund variety.  That is not to say that trust fund hipsters don't exist in Williamsburg; they're just more concentrated in the LES.With that said, the food at Stanton Social is equally pretentious and overpriced.  The ""tapas"" are mediocre at best and the food is highly overrated, as is the restaurant.  Sure, they have some standout dishes, like the kobe sliders and the french onion soup, but the rest of the menu falls flat.  Don't expect any type of spanish cuisine here; the menu is akin to an overpiced TGIF appetizers menu.The reason Stanton Social is so popular is because this is THE place where the trust fund hipsters dine out in the LES.  From the fews times that I've reluctantly came here, there was a good amount of plaid shirts and skinny jeans to be seen.  The service was inattentive, slow and mediocre at best.I suppose if you're part of the above-mentioned group, Stanton Social would be another great way to burn your parent's money.  Otherwise, I recommend trying out Casa Mono, which serves better tapas at a reasonable price and without the pretentious atmosphere.",3,2,0,Molly E.,"Manhattan, NY",2,10,385

Actually scratch that my 4yr old niece could have killed everything we ordered and still have been hungry. I honestly thought Ashton Kutcher was going to pop out and say we had been punk'd. $7 for 1 Kobe beef slider the size of a silver dollar? It would take at least 6 to make one regular size burger. That's now a $42 burger? Also this burger came with Ketchup!!!!! I hate Ketchup I despise Ketchup! I know 99% of the world likes ketchup on their burger but DO NOT sauce my shit without disclosing it. No restaurant should, you can't just serve things with sauces on them without notice.

We both showed up about 10 minutes before our reservation and were seated right away. The staff was friendly and courteous, even when we took 20 minutes before ordering because we were too busy catching up to pay any attention to the menu. Unlike many of the other reviewers, I didn't find the prices bad at all. We had 3 plates, plus dessert and drinks for $82.

The Mini Doughnuts with dipping sauces were amazing.* Tasty drinks -- both the Social Tea and Strawberry Fields were delish.* Attentive staff* Plenty of vegetarian optionsMinuses:* Single unisex bathroom, which you have to wait for in a cramped space next to a table. * A little loud -- don't go here on a first date.* The two-person tables are very close together -- you'll become great friends with the couple next door.Altogether, this was a fun place to come with a friend.

1.0,4/17/2011,"Completely overrated, which I'm sure most New Yorkers know by now. Despite living here for many years, I had not been to Stanton Social, and thought it might be a safe place to go for my birthday. BAD IDEA.Went on a Saturday night, with reservations. One member of the party was 10 mins late, but we were not seated for another 30 minutes, despite a table of 8 being empty. It was broken down to accommodate other guests just after our last friend arrived (we watched as our full party was present). I found it completely unacceptable since we clearly had reservations and were told to wait at the bar. But we were NEVER informed that our table was being given away until we re-approached the hostess ourselves, and found out the empty table we were staring at was supposed to be ours. I've found a 5-10 min grace period common with other places in the city, so I'm not clear why this place would be an exception. Not to mention the hostess was clearly snide and made no attempt to be apologetic or even feign an attempt at helping us.We were waiting around in the crowded coat check area 45 mins after our original reservation time, and finally escorted to a tiny booth that typically accommodates 6, and asked to squeeze in. (Yes, many of my friends and I are small, but we are still adults, and it felt quite insulting!) One of my friends was seated by the hostess in the aisle, blocking the poor waiters the whole night.The food was passable, but definitely not as hyped. The french onion soup dumpling were way too salty. Tacos small, pretty tasty but not satisfying. A few other forgettable dishes. I'll just conclude by saying the table next to us was a group of high school girls celebrating some event or another and I realized that reflected the entire experience.

Eating there isn't about eating good food, it's about being seen while eating food.Typical of restaurants like this, you get a few things:  diners who look like they're ready to walk the runway, overpriced food, a long wait and a birthday party at the table next to you. I went to Stanton Social last week with a group of 6. When the check comes, and it reads $400-500, you'd assume you enjoyed a wonderful meal and you're full/ready for a nap. However, we got the bill and just were not satisfied.  The food we ordered was delicious - pretty much everything we got was great.  Yet, we weren't satisfied. We had to order 3 orders of the meatballs so everyone could taste one.  3 at $14 each = $42 for each person to have one meatball.  Just not that great of a place for groups because it winds up being super expensive.

2.0,4/12/2011,"Let me start by saying that I thought the food at this establishment was great. Yet when I spend $60 dollars on a meal I expect to be somewhat filled. Instead I have one french onion soup dumpling, one red snapper taco, one mushroom risotto cake, one crab cake corn dog, and well you get the point. And this being a small plate establishment, everything was the size of a quarter. Okay, I'm exaggerating. More like a silver dollar. Not a good place to go for a group of six. Better for a intimate dinner for 2.We ate at the lounge. A note for Stanton Social. You are a small plate, tapas like restaurant. You want people to order multiple plates. Yet you have these teeny tiny stepping stools being passed for tables. And you wonder how one of the drinks on the table ended up crashing onto the floor. The music is incredibly loud that having a conversation is beyond impossible.Their cocktail menu is catered more to the party girl taste if you ask me. I asked the bartender if he had anything a little more dark and bitter to no avail. Instead I just opted for a scotch on the rocks.This is one of those places where people just go to be seen, and say that they've eaten there. To me it's the kind of place that shows what's wrong with the LES these days, which is a shame since the food is excellent.

For some reason I thought the place had just opened as we stood in the tiny lobby area for about 10 minutes before others got seated and then us.The server was great by asking if we'd ever been there and the concept of the place. We ended up over ordering and couldn't finish it all. We had the warm doughnuts - delish, snapper tacos - great but seriously could feed a barbie, perogi's - great but not work the price and some sides. I will say I'm a sucker for eating small little bite, which is why this was my first time coming for brunch but not dinner. It all looks cute however I do think it's a bit pricey for what you get if you don't over order.

We had a cramped table next to the wall towards the back of the second floor.Food was certainly tasty but I wished that some of the portions were a bit larger. The most delicious were definitely the:* red snapper tacos - bold flavors! the avocado and mango sauce was creamy and decadent (but they only served 3 tiny ones and I definitely wanted more!)* potato & goat cheese pierogies - surprisingly good. the caramelized onions and truffle creme fraiche sealed the deal with this one!* thai spiced baby back ribs - meaty, juicy and fell right off the bone. marinade was sweet and tangyWe also got the BBQ duck confit/black bean empanada because it sounded interesting but the duck was almost nowhere to be found. The apple and brie quesadilla needed more ingredients and some punch to elevate the flavors.Service was attentive, but maybe almost TOO attentive. Although they brought food out rather promptly, the waitstaff kept eyeing our tables and started taking away plates before we were even finished taking the rest of our food...

Just mmmm. Simple yet satisfying.--Baby spinach salad. It's always nice i think to have at least one 'fresh' dish on the table--the greens and nuts were a perfect palette cleanser and the fresh spinach cut the heavier, more oily dishes abound.--Piquillo pepper bruschetta was fantastic. A perfect combination of textures and a play on warm and cool; it was assertive without being overwhelming. Delicious.--Soup Dumplings. I don't need to say a thing about these babies...we ordered 2 and they're hefty enough to leave you pregnant-bellied and happy. They are mortal opposites of Anita Lo's delicate foie gras dumpling, but they're density is delicious...and also accounts for the lingering scent of onions and truffles that hangs in the air of the dimly lit three story restaurant. --Red snapper tacos. One of the favorites. Sweet meets sour meets a delicate understated fish. Mmmm.Spicy lamb souvlakis. A bit overcooked and I have to say the harissa aoli was a bit over-spiced, but the plate was still cleaned!Chipotle Grilled Shrimp w feta and tomatillo. Simple. Delicious. We wanted more. Grilled shrimp is a staple and while this dish didn't blow us away, it was a great fresh meaty (in so far as shrimp has a pleasant mouthfeel and lets you know it's there) accompaniment to the other players on the table.-Hudson Valley foie gras. A. MAZE. BALLS. sorry, scuse my french but holy hell this was divine. Again, it's not that hard to mess up foie but this was like foie donning a sequined party dress. Mmmmm.--Grilled eggplant parm. So So So good. Like, I could be a vegetarian if this was what I was 'made' to eat. Not over oily in the least and was perfectly filling and kept our forks poking. --KObe sliders. OMFG. I could've had 12 of these. Perfectly cooked, with or without cheese you can't lose. The best mini burger I've ever had, hands down.--Social mac and cheese was pretty standard. It was god don't get me wrong, i mean it is mac and cheese, but it pales in comparison with Cafeteria's mac attack.--Pierogies. &. Short rib tacos. My least favorites of the evening. The pierogies were far too dense in an unappealing way--the potato and pastry crust ratio was a bit off. With the tacos, they were just very eeh. There were far more appealing options on the table.I am dying to try the octopus, tuna sashimi, crusted salmon, scallops, meatballs...droolingnowall over myselfIt was truly a memorable evening..not only because i was surrounded by amazing company, but the food really was an event in itself and along with strong and plentiful cocktails...Stanton Social gets a bonafide A+ and I will be back...often",2,0,3,Victoria G.,"New York, NY",34,136,21

3.0,3/20/2011,"I Dont know what possessed my older sister to decide to come here on a saturday night WITHOUT  reservation- and yet convince me and other parties we were with, that it would be A-ok. As I write this still slightly hungover yet trying to improve my yelpisms, The Stanton Social was the first stop in our very epic night last night. So, Boyfriend and I walk in about 8pm hoping to meet older sis and others, only to find out they were late and were heading over. Pissed because we didnt have a reservation the obnoxious host, who was wearing a dress 2 sizes too small mockingly informed me that the wait would be 2.5 hours for a table. I realize the idea was stupid, ms.hostess, but dont need to be so mean about it!DONT COME HERE WITHOUT A RESERVATION!We decided to venture upstairs to the loungey area where there is a section where there is no need to make a reservation, so people can mingle and eat. We arrive and its super packed (expected). We walk over to loungey area and waitress wearing shape-up like shoes told us that while the lounge area isnt reservation required- the WHOLE lounge was reserved for a party, except for ONE table. So we put name on waiting list and hang out.Great. I got a drink called strawberry fields, that was ok. Ambiance was nice, there was a bunch of trendy people- cool. Finally the rest of our party arrives and I inform sister the situation. She walks over to sketcher girl and comes back saying "" we got a table"". woo! I guess she has more magical powers than I do. We sit and begin to order more drinks, ( I'm on drink 3 at this time) and order food. This was my first time at the stanton, so I did research and was prepared to order the typical ""popular"" dishes. Waitress was attentive and super friendly in the BEGINNING. The food arrived rather quickly ( good for me as I was starving).we had the following:The kobe beef burger sider- YUMMMYYYY Maryland Jumbo Crabcake Corn dogs- This wasnt my favorite. The corn dog tasted like it was lathered in cooking oil *blegh*Red Snapper tacos- as good as everyone says!French onion soup dumpling- why is it called a soup dumpling if it wasnt in soup? How did everyone disregard the smell? I know it has Onion in the name but it smelled like cheetos and old feet. Nevertheless I ate it because everyone RAVED about it. It was ok, but not as delectable as i had imagined it would be. We also had some spring roll thing- it was good.chipotle shrimp- TO. DIE. FOR. Potato Ravioli- Gooddonuts- warm little munchkins of goodnessAnd some other things I cant remember. Overall the food was good, But most of the really popular dishes disappointed me. It must have been around 1030/11 pm and within 40 mins all the food was consumed. Considering I havent eaten anything all day, The amount of food we consumed at the stanton left me pretty full.It became insanely busy, and maybe thats why our waitress had forgotten about us? We were ready for more drinks, and finding the waitress or summoning her was incredibly difficult. The lounge was SO loud. Conversation was near impossible! That could also be because the over the top stevie nicks/madonna/ montell jordan that was blasting on the speakers or someones 36th birthday party was happening behind us...Waitress came FINALLY after one of us had to physically get up and find her, we ordered final round of drinks. First stop of the night, with drinks and food for 3 people= $400 dollars.Wishing we had a reservation and perhaps getting better service and steering clear of the rowdy party group/music?= priceless.For everything else theres- other places.  a-ok for a first time experience.",4,4,0,Ivana R.,"New York, NY",29,15,4

3.0,3/15/2011,"The Bad- Expensive for the small portion you get- Need to order about 4-5 tapas to get full (for one person)- Chocolate sampler for dessert (I didn't like about 3/4 of the samples and I love chocolate....)- Maryland Jumbo Lump Crabcake Corn Dogs (interesting idea...but tastes more like corn dogs than crab--not a fan)The Good- Free mini appetizer- Mac and cheese is good (surprisingly, even if I don't like mac and cheese)- French onion soup dumpling (don't burn yourself!! be careful--full of goodness inside)- Chipotle Grilled Shrimp (nothing special but it's good)- Wild Mushroom Riosotto Cakes (i think the mushroom chips is the highlight of this dish)- Red snapper tacos (nothing memorable.....i think they need to put more spicy mango to make it taste better)The Bottomline- Good place to go to if you enjoy tapas. Better to go in groups so if it doesn't taste good, then maybe someone else will like it. It's really crowded here so don't expect an intimate date.

At the restaurant to celebrate a friend's bachelorette party, the 9 of us girls were comfortably seated in the wine loft. Despite our friendly & helpful waitress and the tasty tapas, our experience was completely tainted due to the rude manager, Jose. After only having sat at the table for about an hour and a half, not to mention $750 worth of food & drinks later,  Jose interrupted our conversation by brusquely informing us he needed the table for the next party, & the bar, where we could pay for more drinks, was located upstairs. Needing to move tables along, especially on a Saturday night is completely understandable however there is an appropriate & professional way to do it. Sadly, Jose's tactics were neither, making our overall experience less than stellar.",2,0,0,Elly M.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,0
5.0,3/13/2011,"I was drawn to this place when walking around with my wife; something about the facade sparked my interest.  I had a feeling that it wouldn't be my kind of place at night, but maybe while the sun was up...We did a little research and decided to get a reservation for brunch on Sunday.  We were there pretty early, maybe 11, and the restaurant wasn't nearly as crowded as I had expected.  The downstairs area looked to be buzzing a bit, but upstairs where we were seated only had a couple tables.  There was also probably 10-15 bar seats open as well - so go early if crowds aren't your thing.The service was good, but don't let them push you over the top in regards to small plates per person; we split 5 items and left stuffed.  When you hear about this places its probably due to the french onion soup dumplings and yes, they are as good as everyone says.  Do not go to this place without trying them.  They are exactly what you would imagine - dumplings smothered in gooey cheese that burst with french onion soup as it punctured in your mouth.  Heaven.The spicy lobster benedict was great as well and came with a very large serving of lobster.  I expected the dish to have about a quarter the amount of lobster and for $13 it was very reasonable.  The ""grilled cheese,"" with jalapeno bacon, fried green tomato, & lemon aioli was another standout dish.  Again, don't let them tell you this is a small portion.  The grilled apple & brie quesadilla was pretty good as were the huevos rancheros soft tacos, just paled in comparison to the other dishes we had.  A new favorite in the LES that I will return to the next time I'm in town.",5,1,1,Perry H.,"Philadelphia, PA",16,451,1

Each dish that we ordered was better than the next, crowd favorites included the red snapper tacos (lots of fish and good mixture of toppings), the ribs (the meat was so tender it fell off the bone when we grabbed it), and the beef carpaccio accompanied with a refreshing salad. The beef wellington was the least satisfactory, and would not order that again. It was disappointing that it came out last. We also enjoyed the chocolate sampler, eat bite better than the next.

4.0,3/1/2011,"Members of the old DC Yelp crew gathered at Stanton Social over slushpocalypse weekend to celebrate a birthday of a very prolific (former-NYC, now in London) yelper. The place just oozed swank as we were led through the restaurant and up the back stairs to a cozy booth for eight. I enjoyed the candles, low-lighting and the decor upstairs with the hand mirrors.  It definitely proved to be the perfect joint for a group gathering (like a birthday or a bachelor/ette party), date (especially if you snagged a spot in the lounge-y area by the upstairs bar) or a business type dinner. As we glanced over the menu, we made what-some-might-find-to-be-inappropriate-sounds while we considered what dishes to get. And that was -before- we ate them. You can only imagine the audio that occurred while we ate the potato & goat cheese pierogies, French onion soup dumplings, yellowfin tuna sashimi, red snapper tacos, spicy lamb souvlaki, Thai-spiced baby back ribs, chicken 'n waffles and the pan roasted day boat scallops. Since we were heading to Apothéke afterward, I chose not to sample any of the cocktails here. Because let's face it...if you know me, you know it takes at most 2.5 drinks to get me silly-drunk. But I have to say, of my dining companions who did drink, they looked very tasty.I can't actually pinpoint a favorite dish of the night because they were all so good which I think is just a testament to the fact that you can't go wrong with any of the dishes here. My highlights, however, were the truffled crème fraiche that accompanied the pierogies -heavenly. They should consider selling it by the pint. The red snapper tacos were also outstanding. There was a nice crunch to the taco shell and the fish filling was perfectly paired with creamy avocado and spicy mango but didn't feel mushy. The tuna sashimi was incredibly light and fresh; a nice change from the heaviness/richness of the soup dumplings, ribs and chicken/waffles.We were able to find room to share some dessert. The donuts were hot-and-fresh-from-the-fryer-but-not-too-heavy and topped with sugar. Paired with chocolate, caramel and raspberry dipping sauces - they were pretty much like crack to a dessert whore. All in all, it was an amazing meal with great service. For all that we ate in our party of eight, I believe with tax and tip included we paid $50 each.

Im not usually a fan of the EV but I had wanted to try the Meatball Shop for some time. We showed up at 830 on a Sunday night and to my dismay at the the time there was a 90 minute wait.... So i pulled out my handy Yelp app on my phone and searched for near by restaurants. As I scrolled down the list I saw Stanton Social. I had heard of the SS before, but didnt know anything about it.I was immediately impressed with the decor and ambiance of SS. When I spoke to the hostess she asked if we had a reservation, we didnt, but they sat us immediately in the dinning room. Our waiter was rather helpful walking us through the menu and suggesting dishes that sounded amazing. OBetween three people we ended up settling on 7 dishes: Wok Charred Edamame Spicy Miso Glaze (added amazing flavor to a usually bland dish), Warm Piquillo Pepper 'Bruschetta (Stuffed with garlic goat cheese), Red Snapper Tacos (came garnished with a creamy avacado sauce and had a sweet mango glaze),  Maryland Jumbo Lump Crabcake 'Corn Dogs' (a simple yet new twist to spice up a boring crab cake), Chipotle Grilled Shrimp (absolutely divine), Grilled Apple & Brie Quesadilla ( stuffed with mustard maple syrup sauce and bacon bits) and finally Old School Meatballs (because I was craving meatballs all day).Although all the dishes were small i felt like I had consumed a 4 course meal! After our meal the waiter came by with the dessert menu. I thought I had nothing left but as soon as I saw the Hot Chocolate Mudslide Shot i knew I could never turn down a shot especially one that came with Patron, Baileys and a homemade marshmallow! Once it hit the table the warm chocolate and tequila warmed my core and got me ready for the rest of the night.The finally bill for the night was $142 that we split three ways.

Always had a good time but the food didn't make an impression (probably because we went to snack and drink rather than to eat properly). However, this time around, we went for a proper meal and were pleasantly surprised. We ordered 8-9 small plates and shared (among 5 women). The dishes more than satisfied our hunger pangs so you could probably order less to start with. I'm vegetarian so I only partook in a few dishes - the pierogis, french onion soup stuffed dumplings, spinach salad and goat-cheese stuffed piquillo peppers were particularly delightful!  The other girls loved the sliders as well. The food seemed varied, unique and tasty.Despite the food, I can't give it 4 stars as (ok, I'm being finicky) I wasn't digging the atmosphere.

You will order and order, eat and eat, like a leviathan at a feast for leprechauns. Finally, you will be full and call for the check. When you see the bill, you will be transported back to reality, and realize that you are just another average sized person in the big city. For real review: Food is pretty good, although the portions are tiny, even for tapas (if you didn't get that in the top portion). The service was hit or miss - terrible at the front, pretty good at the bar upstairs, and about average while dining.",3,7,1,Beth + Raja G.,"Roswell, GA",7,26,0
4.0,1/19/2011,"El novio and I are huge fans of The Stanton Social, especially after our dinner last Monday.  El novio choose the place, based on the Food Network and Yelp reviews. Located right off of Ludlow, the place has a great dimmed ambiance to it.  We had an early dinner around 6pm, so we were able to beat the crowd.  The dress code is ""elegant casual"".    But other than the convoluted oxymoron of a dress code, everything else about the whole experience was pretty good, for lack of a better word.  So yes, this dinner proved to be quite memorable.The Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies were one of my favorites (if not my fav dish of the night), not to mention the TRUFFLE crème fraiche.  El novio and I opted for two plates of the French Onion Soup Dumplings, they did not disappoint...as expected.  The Barbeque Duck Confit & Black Bean Empanadas were scrumptious.  They then brought out the Pan Roasted Day Boat Scallops and Red Snapper Tacos, which were both divine.  I personally enjoyed the coconut curry sauce of the scallops and spicy mango of the Tacos.  Sadly, we were a little underwhelmed with the Chicken n' Waffles; however, desert definitely made up for it.  El novio and I ordered their red velvet twinkie and the Chocolate tour---both very good.In summary, we both enjoyed.    *note: The Social Tea, is quite tasty.",6,0,3,Luarnie B.,"San Francisco, CA",755,143,46
1.0,1/17/2011,"I don't write Yelp reviews, but thought this place warranted one, especially with the propensity towards four stars it receives.I walked in here on Friday night kind of late, around 10:30, and I could almost hear the waitstaff let out a collective ""Noooo"". We were seated upstairs and the first thing I noticed was that the tables are set up so you are sitting about three feet away from your dining partner. Don't bring a date here unless you actually don't care about what they are saying or don't really want to be on a date with them, in which case you can sidle up to the random dude at the table next to you in the booth.The waitress came over friendly enough, and we ordered food. About 8 minutes later (no exaggeration, 8 minutes) the food came out. To be honest I don't know if I could tell you what I was eating, and not only because I didn't order the food. Everything had obviously been nuked to death in a microwave. I think I was served some scallops, but the consistency was more like jello. There were some other fried soggy things, and oh yeah, a sickly sweet amuse bouche of pumpkin and maple syrup. Felt like someone had poured Karo into my mouth.The place was packed, and I couldn't help wondering if everyone there was too drunk or it was just too dark to realize what they were being served.Oh yeah also when the food came out, the server slipped with a plate and a couple of dumplings ran down my fellow diner's back. And then the server just left. Without picking them up, or apologizing. Hmmm...Icing on the cake? The waitress trying to shove us out the door. At one point, (no, not one point, pretty sure it was the eighth time in a half hour) you need to stop asking us if we need anything else. We weren't even the last two in there, and you could just see the girl itching to get us the check so she could cash out for the night.So why do I give this place a star at all? I don' t know, maybe it's because the door guy and the coat check girl were hilarious, and I had a good cocktail. But in two words: Absolute shitshow.",2,2,0,Elizabeth S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,19,0
3.0,1/17/2011,"I'm sad to give this place 3 stars (I would give it 3.5 if I could), but alas, my boyfriend and I weren't that impressed with our dinner here.First off, the place has kind of a smell when you walk in (which I would later discover why). Besides that, though, the place is gorgeous! It has a very cool vibe: modern, sleek, and sexy. It's a great place to get a little dressed up for and go out with girlfriends or a date. The music is definitely loud, though, so it doesn't really promote intimate conversation.Once we were sat, our waitress explained that we should order 2-3 dishes for each of us, and she recommended a few things. Based on other yelp reviews, we had a few in mind anyway.We ordered the goat cheese pirogies (the best dish of the night), the red snapper tacos (also really good), the French onion soup dumplings (disgusting), the Kobe beef sliders (pretty good, but a little disappointing), and the Thai-spiced baby back ribs (excellent).The French onion soup dumplings kind of ruined the night, and we were so excited for them after seeing ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate."" That smell I was talking about earlier is thanks to these guys, which are covered in VERY stinky cheese. The couple next to us literally started gagging and make faces when the dish arrived at our table, and I apologized to them because it was bad even for me! Despite the smell, I still wanted to eat them because I love French onion soup. They were too hot, so each one was kind of a struggle to eat with the hot soup exploding in your mouth. And the flavor tasted so strongly like alcohol, I had a hard time even swallowing. Honestly, I couldn't believe how bad they were. We didn't even want to finish them, which is not something we've ever done in a tapas restaurant before.I would want to go back to try some other things on the menu that sounded good, but with so many good restaurants in New York, it's hard to justify returning to a place where you had a mediocre experience. I would say try it, but avoid the French onion soup dumplings. The menu is very extensive, so you can find some other great options, I'm sure!",4,2,2,Lindsay L.,"New York, NY",37,136,1

3.0,1/15/2011,"This place is pretty trendy and chic, with a very interesting and appealing cocktail menu and small plates to share. I came here for dinner last Saturday with my boyfriend, and apparently this place gets packed, even at 6pm for dinner! The seating is pretty crammed, and the tables were so close that they had to be moved every single time one of us needed to get out of our seats. Main highlights on the menu:-mac and cheese - my boyfriend says it is the best he has had.-French onion soup dumplings - pretty inventive, and I love the cheese. It's a bit on the stinky side, but the good kind of stinky.-spinach and goat cheese pierogies - creamy and delicious with a truffles creme fraiche-Philly cheese kobe slider - good flavors but a bit on the small side.-Chai creme brûlée - came with unfortune cookies - unique flavor for creme brûlée, but I think the creme could have been silkier. Another thing to note is that although the service was very attentive, you could tell they wanted you in and out of there as soon as possible to let the next parties in. As I was taking the last bite of the philly slider, the waiter was already asking if we would like to see the dessert menu. My mouth was full, but I said okay anyway. That was not very nice.

3.0,1/11/2011,"My friend and I came here for dinner and left knowing that we had tried it, but probably would not be returning. The atmosphere was trendy and the crowd was young-ish; they also had an impressive collection of wine bottles that lined the upstairs dining room. That being said, I could not help but notice this weird smell.-Baby spinach salad: very flavorful, light, refreshing. The goat cheese was barely noticeable but the spices in the cashews mixed with the roasted corn made for a delightful bite.-French onion soup dumplings: to put it simply...meh. The caramelized onions with stock was overly salty. While the concept is clever in theory, the servings were difficult to enjoy in person. When first served, the dumplings were too hot and burnt my tongue. After I had allowed them to cool a bit, the gruyere topping had hardened (I personally hate hardened cold cheese).-Kobe beef burgers: these sliders were ok but the quality of the beef was definitely lacking.-Red snapper tacos: first piece of advice, don't squeeze too much lime on the tacos or else it will overpower all the flavor. Not a very memorable dish but my friend seemed to enjoy it. Perhaps I'm just not a fan of the texture of red snapper.Overall, the atmosphere was great (minus the smell) but the food was lacking.",1,0,1,QQ T.,"New York, NY",7,22,0
2.0,1/10/2011,"This is the email I sent to the restaurant:I have two seperate complaints that I would like to bring to your attention.I tried to come in and dine in September. It was a Saturday night, and I walked up to the hostess stand while my two friends waited outside. The area was pretty packed with people waiting for their tables, but there is no excuse as to what happened next.  I stood at the stand with the hostess right in front of me and she ignored me while i waited for 15 minutes.  Granted, I am a petite girl in my early 20's and probably look like I am 18, but that is no way to treat a guest. She had no clue if I had a reservation or not; she never bothered to ask. She never bothered to greet me. She proceeded to speak to two other guests about their tables and continued to ignore me.  I had only stopped in on a whim as we passed the restaurant.  If we had a reservation, I would have been absolutely livid that someone was so rude to me and would have insisted to speak to a manager.  Instead, I was just pissed off enough to take my business elsewhere. I dined on Sunday, January 9th. I came here on the recommendation of a few friends about the amazing food.  My fiance and I walked in around 6pm, and the hostess asked if we had a reservation. We did not, and she informed us that she would seat us, BUT she needed the table back in an hour and 20 minutes.  I did not appreciate the way she worded it  with the tone of voice she used.  It gave the impression that the restaurant didn't really want our business. My sister is a reservationist at a restaurant in Manhattan, and she later told me the way that she words the same idea to her patrons.  She showed me that it is possible to word the scenerio in an acceptable manner.  Perhaps, the management should think about how the impression that the hostess makes on the patron since it is the first person they meet when they walk in the door.---------------------------------------------We ordered three dishes - french onion soup dumplings, kobe philly steak, and the mac & cheese. We came for the french onion soup dumplings based on a rave review from a friend, but we really didn't like them. They tasted super boozy. We only tried one and left the others alone. The other two dishes were amazing. I am not sure if I am willing to come again, but my fiance would love to come back and try some other dishes.",2,0,1,Stephanie A.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0

We ordered the ""lobster pizzeta"" and i must say it's not a pizzeta but a ""pizzetita"" (even smaller) with 5 slices and thin as a kleenex tissue. The pizzeta has a fried radish on top that leaves your mouth without the ability to taste the lobster and even the bacon . We also ordered the red snapper ""tacos"" which i must say were disappointing and the smallest I have ever seen in my life. The only thing that was very good were the kobe beef sliders at $7 a pop.

4.0,1/6/2011,"I first heard of The Stanton Social from Food Network's The Best Thing I Ever Ate.  The menu item that was featured was their French Onion Soup Dumplings.  Okay, let me repeat myself.  French. Onion. Soup. Dumplings.  Yes, that's right.  A traditional Asian-style dumpling filled with deeply caramelized onions fortified with stock and seasonings to taste like soup without being overly brothy (that would make it much more difficult to eat).  These dumplings are served in an escargots dish, topped with melted Gruyere cheese and skewered with croutons.  It's the complete French onion soup experience in the form of a dumpling!  This is the main reason for going to The Stanton Social.  But let me share a few more reasons... It's fun and hip, in the too-cool-for-school Lower East Side.  I hear it's great for birthdays and bachelorette parties, and I can totally see why!  It's hard to find (no big sign), which means it must be good, right?  It has a room filled with vodka bottles, and lots of other fun alcohol bottles in the upstairs dining area lining the walls.  Service was impeccable, our empty dishes were cleared almost instantly, making room for more food!  Our waiter was cute.  Very cute ;-) The other foods we ate were delicious too, and so were our drinks!  I honestly think I may plan my next birthday here :)The Stanton Social features small plates intended for sharing, much like tapas.  I appreciate the variety, as I get to eat many different things.  This makes Victoria happy.  Another thing that makes Victoria happy is free food.  Free food like these complimentary pumpkin puree and ricotta crostini.  They were lightly sweet and creamy with a delicately crisp round of bread beneath.  Me likey.We each selected a cocktail to compliment our meal.  I chose the Pineapple 75 Martini (Pineapple infused Ketel One, pineapple juice, lemon syrup, splash of Chambord) while my sister had the Strawberry Fields (Grey Goose Citron, muddled fresh strawberries, lemon syrup, fresh lemon and a Riesling floater).  Both drinks were refreshing, perfectly balanced, and just strong enough without tasting like straight alcohol. Mine was topped with a dehydrated pineapple chip, while the Strawberry Fields was garnished with a lemon crisp.The first of our plates to arrive were the Red Snapper Tacos and the Potato and Goat Cheese Pierogies.  The tacos were served with mango and avocado, and a lime wedge and small dollop of spicy sauce by each mini taco.  I love how each taco came with its own accompaniments directly alongside, so no one would have to share their lime wedge, and no taco would feel neglected or unloved.  These were good, but my fish tacos are in a league of their own :) Meanwhile, the potato and goat cheese pierogies were my second favorite dish we tried!  They were tiny little packages filled with the traditional mashed potato component and replacing the more common farmer's or cottage cheese with their tangier cousin... goat cheese.  Topped with caramelized onions and accompanied by truffle creme fraiche, these were simply crescent-shaped bits of Heaven.  Highly recommend!The next wave of dishes included Barbecue Duck Confit and Black Bean Empanadas with Smoked Tomato and Blood Orange Jam, and of course the main event, the heavyweight champion of the world, the French Onion Soup Dumplings.  The empanadas each sat in their own little compartment, resting atop a spoonful of sauce, while the dish was served with a bowl of extra sauce.  The sauce alone tasted like bacon.  That is to say, it was very smoky.  Alone, the smoky flavor overpowered the other flavors in the sauce, but along with the empanadas, the sauce worked much better (though you could have fooled me about the contents of blood orange, as I didn't note any citrus flavors).  The filling was tender, juicy, and flavorful, with a spicy veil.  These were fun, and I'd enjoy having them again.The French Onion Soup dumplings were everything I thought they'd be.  I'm really glad I finally got to try them myself, because I really imagined the filling would be more soupy.  It was more like really wet fortified caramelized onions.  I had wanted to create this dish in my own kitchen for a long time, and definitely have a better perspective on the dish now.  I loved the combination of chewy dumpling dough, sweet and meaty melt-in-your-mouth onions, nutty and gooey melted Gruyere, and finally the crunchy crouton to top it all off.  These are a must have!  Even if I hadn't seen the episode of The Best Thing I Ever Ate, or had these personally recommended to me by a former co-worker, or just happened to love French Onion Soup, our waiter made a point to suggest them to us.  I'm sure every person who walks through these doors will LOOOOOVE this dish.",9,4,4,Victoria K.,"Cranston, RI",579,664,2519

Halibut tacos - perfectly grilled fish with mango salsa paired with just enough citrus all in a light and crunchy taco shell.  One of our favorites. 2. Grilled octopus - well cooked but a bit heavy handed on the sauce. 3/4. French onion soup dumplings and Mac n' cheese-both were tasty but too heavy (cheese and cream) for us.

2.0,12/27/2010,"Given that great atmosphere, food, and drinks are the trifecta for a good night out, Stanton Social barely passes muster.   If darkness equates to a sexy vibe than Stanton Social is home to the barebacking-est power orgy the likes of which would make a Roman blush.  While there's candlelight at each table, they could afford to light another candle because it would be nice to be able to read the menu without having to bust out my Flashlight app.  The upside of the dim lighting is that you could get up to some shenanigans under the table without being seen or duck out of a bad blind date without having to look the other person in the eye.  A couple lumens of light would do wonders for enhancing patron visibility without taking away from the romantic vibe.  The restaurant is spread over two floors, with an open floor plan and dark, sleek furniture.  The space is coldly beautiful but the open floor plan and dim lighting are at odds with the vibe of the place; whereas the setting seems to be good for couples, the music and volume of patrons preclude any notions of romance.  Since the music's loud, the diners also have to be loud to be heard so it'd be great if the DJ could turn it down to something manageable.  We only had five people at our table but because of the music I couldn't talk to anyone who wasn't next to me without leaning over and screaming in their ear.  I think it would be great for a group, so long as its within the appropriate age group to not be put off by the decibel level and everyone is properly soused to not care.The service is thoughtful.  Our server explained that their tapas, though they're priced on the menu, the portions can be adjusted to accommodate your group so each person has a portion.  Our server also had great timing, coming back to clear the table and take our orders without us having to call him over.Food is OK but doesn't rock my world.  Out of the rounds of tapas we ordered, I had expected at least one dish to be crave-worthy, something so tasty that I'd have to lick my plate but alas no.  The famous French onion soup dumplings (kissing cousin to Chinese xiao long bao soup dumplings) are interesting because it's a fusion dish with a different vehicle for the soup (the dumplings set in an escargot dish) but with the familiar sweet onion, rich burgundy-infused beef broth, and cheese of classic French onion soup. The disappointing thing is that, well, its just gussied up French onion soup. I also think its better to serve these hot puppies in individual spoons so you can easily break the dumpling in the spoon and slurp up the contents; with the cheese coating the top of each pocket in the escargot dish, it's a challenge to keep your toothpick-poked dumpling intact while extricating it from the blanket of cheese.  My friends and I are from California so we abide by the rule of not eating Mexican food north of Santa Barbara or East of Texas but Kelly ordered the red snapper tacos and what a surprise, they were unexpectedly delicious!   I've had great seafood tacos and their red snapper tacos are up there with my faves - tasty, the fish was moist and not overdone, and the avocado and mango was a nice counterpoint.  Unfortunately there were no other standouts from the rest of our order (8 tapas plates, 1 dessert), which is really unfortunate because they've got some interesting combinations of textures and flavors on their menu that just don't live up to the description.  I do appreciate that their menu is reasonably priced, especially for what you would expect given that its New York and the decor just screams bougie.   The tapas menu also makes it easy to share with your table without getting too full.   I also appreciate that though their menu is fusion, is doesn't draw from just one type of cuisine but rather from many so there are opportunities to satisfy the tastes of everyone in your party; the caveat is that their menu lacks cohesiveness and can seem like a mishmash of different dishes.  Stanton Social suffers from trying to be all things to all people.   If they focused their efforts to augment their strengths and downplay their weaknesses, it could be a much better experience.  Technically I could do a 3 star on this joint but given that the expectations are so high when come on, this is New York so I expected better especially given that they've got so many 5 star reviews. I couldn't do any better with good conscience so I'm downgrading them to a 2.5 with the disclaimer to other diners to manage your expectations.",3,0,0,C C.,"San Diego, CA",207,159,15

Service - server was knowledgeable and helpful and very nice.With that said, it remains to say that this restaurant is misleading about the prices of their dishes. The server does not tell you ahead of time that when you order a dish, they are going to multiply the number of orders according to the people in your party. For example, the meatballs were listed at $13 but when we got the bill, it came to $52 because 2 meatballs come per order, so they brought out 4 orders for the 8 of us. Although this is a good idea for a tapas/shared place, we should have been informed of this before they did it. We expected to pay $13  for the meatball dish...not $52.

Vibe/Decor - This place is amazing looking and the design is absolutely impeccable.  I really enjoy the bar in the upstairs room.  Great design and the light fixtures are awesome.  I have to say the music is too loud to speak to the people you are eating with, probably a good thing if you are on a first date, but that wasn't the case with us.  They lose one star for the music, no salt and pepper on the table (This trend is really starting to piss me off), and when I asked for a Corona the waiter says, of course pretentiously, ""We only have Sol.""  Great, another restaurant that only has Sol.  Does it really make your restaurant ""cooler"" if you carry a more obscure brand that tastes worse and is more expensive than its more popular sibling?  I guess to some people, but not to me.",1,1,0,TJ G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,20,0

4.0,10/30/2010,"Socially Delish! Came here with another Mrs. T on a weeknight. We got here at 6:15 and it was empty which was lovely because we got to enjoy the serene ambiance. Hard to see dim lighting and candles is the setting. We got a booth at the back of the restaurant which gave a 180 degree awesome view of the restaurant. The downside of being seated of this this booth was being close to the only restroom which happens to be unisex, eeww. We ordered way much tapas for just two people! The tapas summary: -potato and goat cheese perogies, very delish. If u love cheese get this, goat cheese is very creamy fill. This is a must try. -french onion soup dumplings, as the other yelpers noted, this is overrated. The other Mrs. T liked the crouton better that came with the dumpling. The dumpling was delish, good amount of onions in a bite size dumpling. The melted cheese that coated the top was very stiff, chewy texture and no longer warm as we ate it. The idea of a soup dumpling may sound creative, but the soup is better being served in a bowl. -Crab corn dogs: delish. This concept I like, crab meat in a corn dog. -Kobe beef burger: very good, meat is very tender. This burger is not a must have, even if it is Kobe beef, not worth the $7 per slider. -Chicken n waffles: this was good, but forgettable. There are four pieces. This one was also a not must have. -Mac n cheese with chorizo, ""can I have some more, sir?!"" There was a top layer of panko bread crumbs that were sprinkled generously all over mac and cheese in mini little pan. The panko bread crumbs and chorizo gave this mac and cheese a more unique twist. This was our favorite as it was the winner. -dessert: the chocolate tasting. It came with chocolate ice cream, mini peppermint patties, chocolate mousse, mini oreos, and panna cotta. Ice cream, peppermint patties, are oreos are very delish for that chocolate addict. The mousse is good, had that bittersweet flavor. The panna cotta looked like it had chocolate flavor but it did not taste like chocolate and had a lemon flavor to it. We enjoyed our evening here. Service here is attentive. Plates cleared right away and provide new plates for you after receiving new tapas. The one little mishap was the waitress spilled hot water from our teacups as she was setting down. She was very apologetic. The wait staff cleaned it up right away. The serene atmosphere turned into a loud and lively social event. The music is blasting into your ears over you from the hanging speakers. Where I was sitting, my ears were protected under the overhead that housed the loft like bar area. It wasn't til I was walking through the restaurant that I felt I was in a concert. You have to shout at the person sitting next to you. As we left, the long line for the bathroom was similar to the long line at the DMV. As noted earlier, only one restroom for all. Me thinks they should invest in separate restrooms that have at least two stalls. They are making lots of $$$ off the $7/sliders and $13/cocktail. I would come here again to have a socially good time and try other tapas. This place is great with a group of friends. Come very early if you and your date want to talk in an intimate setting and enjoy the place to yourselves. And there would be no line to use the restroom.",2,0,3,M T.,"New York, NY",108,220,766
4.0,10/26/2010,"I was wavering between 3 and 4 stars but 4 won out because I decided I would definitely go back again.2 of us arrived around 6:30 on a Friday night without reservations, and the place was already pretty busy.  The hostess said she could accommodate us in 20 minutes or so and we could wait at the upstairs bar.  Well 20 turned into about 40 minutes but since we were enjoying our cocktails upstairs, it wasn't too annoying.  The Strawberry Fields cocktail was quite tasty.Finally seated we decided to order the goat cheese pierogies, the french onion soup dumplings, and the chicken & waffles.  The pierogies were excellent, I could have eaten 10 more, the dumplings were ok, and the chicken and waffles were good.  Normally we would have ordered a few more dishes but 1- we were saving room for dessert and 2- we were going out drinking after and didn't want to be too full.  For dessert we ordered the warm donuts- excellent- and the cookies and milk- good.Where we were seated was practically on top of the tables next to us, which made it really annoying when someone against the wall needed to get out. It did, however, provide me with an opportunity for some close up inspection of some of the other offerings- many of which looked tasty as well.Despite the long wait, once seated service was friendly and prompt.  I don't find myself over that way often but I would make an effort to go back, and make sure i had a reservation next time.",2,0,1,M N.,"New York, NY",67,156,1

Every bit was amazing.- French Onion Soup Dumpling - Definitely an interesting spin on your traditional French Onion Soup and quite savory.- Yellowtail Sashimi - Meh.

3.0,10/24/2010,"I decided to go to The Stanton Social for my 2 year anniversary with the boyfriend. I sum it up to my intrigue to try with French Onion soup dumplings and beef Wellington. We had a 6:15PM reservation, but arrived around 5:30PM and we were able to be seated right away to a booth. Since the boyfriend made the reservation online, he had let the restaurant know I'm advance it was our anniversary...we surprised and pleased that the manager came out with 2 flutes of champagne and congratulated us. So enough of the back story and sappy crap,on to the main reason I'm writing this, the food lol. :pWe received our free Caesar Salad bites that we gobbled up instantly. I was tempted to see if we could order those because they were refreshingly yummy, and I normally don't like Caesar salads.The rest of the meal:French Onion soup dumplings aka ""little pockets of mouth happiness"": The large amount of hype was true. These ARE a must to order. Granted, my excitement to try the dumplings nearly had me burn my mouth because of the hot, tasty, burgundy brothed onion soup (yea, I do know how to eat soup dumplings..I had a hard time slurping the broth so I slowly bit into it...um dumb move on my part) so..pro-tip: Hot onion soup balls in your mouth all at once =BAD. Eat with tasty caution.Grilled Cheese Sliders: YUCK, do not want. The lemon and green tomato aioli was gross..add cilantro to the mix and you have a icky combination with what could have been good if they stuck with just the plain aged cheddar and jalapeno bacon. It tasted slimy, gooey (in a non good way) and gross. We ended up picking out the bacon and eating it separately.RI Lobster Roll: I'm from Rhode Island...I know Lobster Rolls. It tasted like a regular lobster roll to me minus overly mayoed ickness some lobster rolls are. It was good..not sure if it means the Lobster is from Rhode Island or they picked Rhode Island because it's the coolest state in New England lol. Chicken 'n Waffles: My new moto is Balsamic Maple Syrup makes everything better! The cheddar waffle was a little soggy from too much corn pudding and syrup, but it was edible and tasty. The corn pudding was creamy and sweet. The rosemary pressed chicken was juicy, tender, and flavorful. Overall, I liked it.The Stanton Social Beef Wellington: Ah, the 2nd main reason I chose Stanton Social as my anniversary dinner location. I'm a Hell's Kitchen fan and after years of listening to Gordon Ramsay scream at aspiring head chefs for f****ing up Beef Wellingtons, I have always had an interest of eating one.The filet was cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth along with the foie gras  mushroom filling. The pastry was golden brown and flaky and everything was tied together with a delicious red wine reduction glaze. Love, Love Love...best dish of the night.Honey Glazed and Rosemary Parsnips: They were good..nothing to write home about. It's a basic side dish to me.Hot Chocolate shots: Mmmm....rich hot chocolate with Patron, Bailey's and homemade marshmallow. I had 2..I should have had more.Apple Pie Sundae: It tasted like the apples were brandied..mixed with caramel, it was a great take on a classic. It was creamy sticky apple goodness.Red Velvet Twinkie:...a very sad disappointment due to dry cake. Dry cake is yucky. The creme fraiche filling was perfect, but ruined by dry, tasteless red velvet cake. If the cake was moist and had some flavor, it would have been perfect.I defiantly would come back to try other things I wanted to try on  the menu and eat the things I gave good reviews for. My advice is make reservations if you go on a Saturday because this place gets slammed fast. Avoid the Twinkies and Grilled Cheese Sliders. Dry cake is yucky cake and some things can ruin a good grilled cheese.3 out of 5 stars: The red velvet twinkie massacre and slimy grilled cheese slider killed 2 stars. The service was good, not outstanding, but good. The manager was very pleasant. :) I won't write The Stanton Social off though..I mean this is my first visit and I had some very amazing tasty things. I will have a follow up when I visit again and maybe it will go up a star. Always think positive. :)",0,2,0,Robin V.,"Brooklyn, NY",165,35,1
1.0,10/24/2010,"This place is the most over-hyped, overpriced place I've been to in years. One star may seem a harsh, but ""Eek! Methinks not"" is a pretty good way to sum it up. If you are reading reviews to help you decide whether to go or not, I'd strongly recommend you read the low star reviews and take note, because they hit the nail on the head. I was floored to see that so many people have rated this place so highly on Yelp -- they must be impressed with the scene more than the food. The best thing I can say is that some of the food was tasty (but nothing memorable,) and clearly it's a trendy place where people come to see and be seen. If you are coming for the food or for the overall dining experience, save yourself a wad of cash and go elsewhere. Why? The food is uber expensive and the portions are so small (even the items that are around $20!) that you basically need tweezers instead of a fork. My favorite quote from another Yelper: ""I felt like my little niece was serving us play food from her Barbie oven.  I love Tapas but these were hors d'oeurves at best!""  So do not to go there hungry, and know that you will not leave full, even if you spend $50 each. My friend was really enthusiastic about trying this place and made a reservation. I have to admit, I didn't like the vibe or the decor from the moment we arrived. We went for lunch and although it was a beautiful, sunny day outside, the restaurant was dark and dimly lit, making it seem like it was nighttime. Not only that, but the music was definitely ""night"" as well - some sort of loud and annoying techno lounge music. We waited about 20 minutes after we were seated for a waiter to appear. He finally showed after we told the busboy we wanted to order. After that, the service was perfunctory and not at all personal. The food was just OK - some was pretty good, but nothing was memorable. The menu looked like it had a lot of creative dishes but I can honestly say that it was a lot better on paper than on the plate. Chicken with waffles - meh. Lobster Eggs Benedict - tiny (as in two pieces that were 2 bites each) and needed salt (but none to be found on the table.) We asked for bread -- tiny!   The couple next to us ordered the croque monsieur satay (there's a photo posted if you want to see) and it was literally 4 small cubes, each about the size of a piece of Russell Stover's chocolate, or maybe a walnut. And they let the busboy clear 2 of them, as well as some waffles - I would have eaten them!  That's how hungry I was, and not looking forward to dropping another $5 per bite!! My friend said the Bloody Mary was spicy and good, but my pomegranate champagne cocktail was just so so. I was dying when we walked around the 'hood and saw all the great looking places advertising $15 (and less) prix fixe brunches.  Do yourself a favor and check them out. You could treat a group of 6 to a satisfying, filling meal for what we paid for the two of us, and I left hungry.",3,0,1,Elizabeth B.,"Washington, DC",36,142,5
4.0,10/23/2010,"I like this place. I'm giving it four stars because their ribs were so freaking tasty, I wanted to lick the plate. Whenever I write that in a review, know that it's getting four stars. My friend and I got there early, apparently this is the place to be and so we couldn't get reservations between 6 and 9, and really enjoyed ourselves. The food was solid. If sharing, not so expensive. We definitely left full. We had the mushroom risotto, the french onion soup dumplings, chipotle grilled shrimp, thai spiced ribs and the mac and cheese. Everything was good. We did have dessert. We shared the Apple pie thingy that was divine. Seriously. I think it contained cinnamon ice cream which is a fast way to this gals heart. My friend also had the mudslide shot, which she really enjoyed. I just stuck with coffee. Oh and lastly, with my meal I had one of their cocktails--the champagne julep. It was delicious. Quite refreshing and light. I highly recommend this place. Not for a date, or for a dinner where you need to talk, but for when you're hanging with the girls, or having a fun date night (where you've been on several dates before).  I would also note that this is trendy and the place is really dark. The candles on the table do not help to see anything. Maybe it's because it's hiding the trendy factor? Not sure. Either way, take note that the place is bumping after 6 and there's almost a different feel from relaxed and empty restaurant at 5:30/5:45 to busy (can't move within the space), and loud restaurant, especially within the 15 minute window it all goes down in.",2,0,0,Sara S.,"New York, NY",60,105,0

3.0,10/17/2010,"This restaurant has both strong points and some weak points. On the plus side, it is a high energy restaurant, with a very cool decor. They were able to incorporate the original architecture and update it with a modern touch. Service was very good, and very efficient. Plates were removed within seconds after completion. Water refilled often, etc. The food was very good. Had the corn dogs, which I would recomend. The short rib tacos were OK, but not worth the price. Best dish was the chicken waffle. YUM! grill chesse sliders were good as well. Drinks were nothing special. had the spicy marguerita. Not worth $13. And speaking of price..alas, the problem with this restaurant..its way too expensive for what you are served. Total for 2 was $150 with tip for 5 dishes and 3 drinks. For that much money, there are many better alternatives elsewhere. Plus, did I mention the energy of the restaurant. way too loud. way too cramped. you will for sure make new friends, as the tables are in close quarters.

The best dish was the french onion soup dumplings, very tasty and different.  Even though the portions were small, we were still full at the end of our meal.  A couple of negative marks....the coffee was cold and we had 3 different waiters during our meal, partly because we were there between shifts.  Other than that it was a nice spot for a small group to have a good meal.",1,0,0,Jonalen C.,"Jersey City, NJ",4,10,1

'I didn't know humans like you existed before I met you,' you're left thinking. 'Now, thanks to you, my mind and my heart are open and evolved.'The Stanton Social is that rare and wonderful ex: while our best times are in the past, I continue to hold it in high regard. After all, its concept -well-rendered, delicious, not-atrociously-priced share plates for groups- transformed me into the type of girl who could discover and adore my current paramour, Traif (with the metaphysical ecstasy that I do). Don't let that early-millennium, Sex-and-the-City aesthetic that's a bit dated (but no less fascinating for out-of-towners) turn you off: the food is delicious. Unpretentious high-brow renderings of familiar favorites (e.g.: red snapper tacos, the droolsy French onion soup-dumplings, truffle-laced goat-cheese pierogies) are served at the palatable rate of one per diner, allowing you to custom-create a tasting menu of French-ish brunch or dinner for your party. The cocktail menu is accordingly SingleFabulousFemale-tastic, which is to say it's going to exasperate and bore some, but really, really appeal to the type that's been excited about commercial New York before.

The only problem is that the bouncers were standing in the hallway right by the stairs where it is very cramped - shouldn't they be outside? It wasn't that cold out and they were just causing traffic indoors. The meal was amazing: 1. French onion soup dumplings - simply the most amazing thing ever.

Mac and cheese - good but I don't need chorizo although it was still delicious Honestly we probably ordered more but I can't remember. The biggest complaint was that every time we ordered cocktails we literally waited for a good 15 minutes until they came. On 2 separate occasions we asked our waitress if she had an update.

The meat was definitely tender.  But instead of the little cherry tomatoes I would have much preferred some diced onions and some cilantro.  They definitely had interesting cocktails as well.  I had the Black Magic.  I don't know if I thought it was good cause I love Guinness but I liked it... We also tried the Watermelon-Ginger Margarita.  Not bad... more watermelon than anything... couldn't really taste the ginger...  Bea's Gin-Lemon Mojito was also pretty decent.Overall, I loved this place.  It is definitely one of my favorite places now.  I love this place even more since it has an added bonus of it being like 1 block away from Katz's...  :P",4,3,0,David K.,"Paramus, NJ",44,80,30
4.0,9/24/2010,"Stanton is an American take on tapas. I always enjoy most of their tapas but the only one that really stands out to me are the pierogies. The pierogies alone are reason enough to go to Stanton. And the truffle creme fraiche dip is drool worthy. I often try to hoard the creme fraiche so that I can dip my fries in it later. That reminds me the fries are good along with the philly sliders (note one order of the sliders will get you just that - one slider). Everything else is good and I experiment with different plates but I always have to get the pierogies, fries and philly slider. The service isn't the greatest and they can be pretty aggressive trying to clear plates (which is less than ideal when I'm trying to hoard the creme fraiche on my plate and they've already taken it and put another plate on top of it before I can say anything).",1,0,0,Funaek A.,"Falls Church, VA",3,31,179

4.0,9/24/2010,"The Stanton Social is a scene. Especially on Saturdays. I think it must be where all the cool people hang out. You know, the people that are with it.*Like all such spots, the food is a bit overpriced, you might wait a 1/2 hour past your reservation to be seated, and the bachelorette party next to you will absolutely be loud and screechy. And there is no chance you'd ever find me there on a Saturday night if it wasn't for two things:1. The food is damn good.2. There might not be a better restaurant for big groups in all of Manhattan.**At your average group dinner, eight people order eight dishes, and everyone eats their own food. Which means I only get to try one entree. Well, two, because my girlfriend is a small woman and I can overpower her easily. My favorite thing about the experience here is that they essentially demand that we dine exactly the way I want to dine. Eight people order eight dishes, and they adjust the pricing so that everyone gets to try a bit of everything. Like a family. A wealthy, wealthy family that eats very well.In terms of ordering, I would go with your gut. There's a lot of variety on the menu, and if you can't find something that sounds good to you then I'm convinced you don't like food. But assuming you care what I think (since you made it to the end of this review)...if I were you, I'd get the Beef Wellington.__________*I used to be with it, but then they changed what ""it"" was.

The best thing about ordering with a group is that I want to eat every single item on that menu. The highlights were the short rib tacos, goat cheese stuffed peppers, and of course the french onion soup dumplings -- it's worth a trip for those alone!

Our waitress was super helpful, attentive and willing to answer any questions we had. I'm a fan of small plates--the variety of tastes always pleases my palate!So here we go...Caesar Salad Crostini? - This one was a freebie--kinda like a caesar salad bite. Simple and yummy.Grilled Cheese Sliders - These looked like perfect little triangular stacks of goodness. Unfortunately I didn't have this because of the bacon. My friends said it was awesome.Duck Confit w/ Black Bean Empanadas - Again, I didn't have this one, but it was described as great bbq duck flavor, with the black beans offsetting the richness of the duck confit.Red Snapper Tacos - These were AMAZINGLY yummy. Avocado cream with bits of mango round out these itty-bitty taco bites.Dusted Frites - Their rendition of pomme frites. Simple execution done well--potatoes perfectly fried and crispy, dusted with spice and herbs. Ketchup and alioli were a nice touch as dipping options.Wild Mushroom Risotto Cakes - This was probably my favorite of the small dishes. Balanced flavors, nice textures with the wild mushrooms and the crispy mushrooms on the top. The parmesan cheese gave a nice subtle saltiness and tang.Grilled Tomato Pizetta - Like a slice of pizza refined. This was very simple--fresh mozzarella, grilled tomatoes, garlic and chile oil. Warm Doughnuts - Warm, fluffy, perfectly fried and rolled in cinnamon and sugar. What more do you want?... Well, how about chocolate, caramel and raspberry dipping sauces? OH HELL YES.Chocolate Tasting - The perfect ending to an awesome meal. I'm surprised we had room left in our stomachs. Chocolate malt ice cream with chocolate crunchies, chocolate panna cotta, mousse, molten s'mores cake, mini sandwich cookies and homemade mini peppermint patties. So there... will I come back?

5.0,8/21/2010,"The last thing the Stanton Social needs is another review, but my past two dining experiences at this restaurant have inspired me to sing its praises. Let me begin by saying this: generally speaking, restaurants that earn more than two money signs ($$) are usually not my friends. Truth be told, they're above my station...but after seeing a Food Network special that made the famed french onion soup dumplings seem like G-d's gift to the culinary world, I made a reservation and waddled to the Lower East Side. The dishes I had and their relative deliciousness (spread over two visits...I'm not quite obese enough to eat these in one sitting. Not quite.  Additionally, I was with people.  So I'm not quite so disgusting.): French Onion Soup Dumplings - So delish. The Gruyere cheese and the red wine based beef broth made this a revelatory experience. One of the few hyped dishes that I've eaten that earned their reputation. Potato and Goat Cheese Pierogies with Black Truffle Creme Fraiche - Oh...my...gah. Crispy potato dumplings with tangy goat cheese served with the absolute best creme fraiche. The star of the meal. Chicken and Waffles - Boo yah. Perfection on a plate. The corn and balsamic vinegar sauce really took this dish to another level. Kobe Beef Slider - Very good. Not great. Good beef, but slightly underwhelming considering the cost ($7 for a slider...). Brie and Apple Quesadilla - Absolutely scrumptious. Crispy and tangy - bar food perfected. Spinach and Goat Cheese Ravioli - Thin, tender ravioli casing containing a truly perfect filling. So good. Old Fashioned Meatballs - Tasty, but slightly rare for my liking. Strawberry Shortcake - Delicious as expected. Red Velvet Twinkie - Slightly dry and overly sweet. The one misstep in the meal. Sugared Donuts - Reminiscent of Chinese take-out donuts. In other words: the bomb. Stanton Social - I love your food. However, I strongly dislike the amount of money I'm spending as a result of loving your food.

All in a great neighborhood for eating and drinking.We had reservations for three and were sit at the booth at the back of the restaurant, secluded, surrounded by racks of wine bottles with the best view in the house. The highlights of the night were the kobe sliders and the chocolate tasting. Both were memorable. They did a great job of pairing red with our tastes and the food.

3.0,8/12/2010,"I decided to check out Stanton Social with a friend after reading all the reviews raving about it on Yelp.  We met there at about 6pm midweek, for a light dinner before heading out to the New Museum (I picked this place because it was close to the museum).  The hostess refused to seat us downstairs because we didn't make a reservation--even though the place looked really empty.  She suggested we go up to the lounge.  While, I liked the decor of the lounge, being rejected by the hostess didn't leave a good first impression with us. I have to admit that the French Onion Soup Dumplings are even more amazing than I had imagined!  I would be giving this place 5-Stars if I had only the dumpings and the drinks (my Strawberry Fields cocktail was shockingly good).  But, the rest of the stuff we ordered was just ""ok"".  The philly cheesestake slider was pretty good, but so small that we each barely got a bite.  The kobe slider was just as small and totally tasteless.  The fries were meh.  We were hoping that 4 dishes would fill us up because we're small girls... but they didn't.  So we went ahead and ordered the fish tacos, which were tastey, but nothing special.If you go, don't bother with the sliders.  For the same price, you can get a better full-sized burger anywhere else.  Which brings me to my next point: Don't come here if you're hungry.If you're willing to dish out $13 for good drinks and share a snack with friends, it's a lovely scene... but don't expect ""a meal"" for less than $40-$50 a person.",2,0,0,polina g.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,1

Our drinks came quickly and all were delicious.  I don't normally order two drinks but the watermelon ginger margarita was so delicious I couldn't resist - it had real bits of watermelon in it!  Yum!3. We received complimentary caesar salad crustinis to start off the meal.4. We ordered ample food and kept the food coming.  {I'm really confused with all of the other reviewers who note the small portion sizes.  It's a tapas restaurant, which means the portions are going to be quite small.... but in all honesty, the portions at TSS were bigger than I've received at most tapas joints I've frequented}5. EVERYTHING was delicious.  My two favorites were the french onion soup dumplings and the waffles and chicken.  If I could learn how to make those two dishes I'd be a very happy gal!6. The only part of the meal I wasn't head over heels in love with was dessert.  I tried the red velvet twinkie, which was just ""eh.""  Not phenomenal but not bad either.  One of my friends had the chai creme brulee and that was quite tasty.I would definitely go back to The Stanton Social again!  We had so much fun and ended up trying at least half the menu with no complaints.",1,0,1,Lisa K.,"Chicago, IL",67,103,5
4.0,8/8/2010,"This review is for a Sunday dinner approx. 6:30pmWe made reservations online and called in to confirm. This process itself was actually pretty smooth.Past Reviews: I read a bunch of reviews of this place and the common denominator was the small portion sizes, high price, and rushed service.Service: The waiter seemed to know his stuff but we went in there knowing pretty much what we were gonna order. The water was full and when we asked for club soda with lime he suggested a bottle of sparkling water which would have the same price. It probably ended up being more but it ended up being really good. The food came out fast, maybe too fast but we would complain if it did not come out fast enough. Atmosphere: The decor of course was typical of a dark trendy place but very tasteful. The herringbone wine rack looked awesome on the second level and no there was not any techno music playing at least at the time I was there.Food: The food actually was amazing, and yes the portions were really small but I had 5 dishes for 2 people and we left satisfied.We had:MEAL-Edamame (bowl)Empanadas (3)(1) Kobe Slider(s) Brie Quesadilla (4)French Onion Soup Dumplings (6)DESSERT-Chocolate TastingCreme BruleeDrinksBottle Sparkling Water (2)CappuccinoEspressoPRICE BREAKDOWN:Total: 99.892 bottles - 13edamame - 6empanadas - 10kobe sliders - 7quesadilla - 11soup dumplings - 12choc tasting - 16creme brulee - 9cappuccino - 4.50espresso - 3.25SUGGESTIONS:If money is a concern come here for a Pre meal otherwise try the Brie Quesdilla and Chocolate Tasting.",5,1,2,Alexander S.,"New York, NY",15,12,1
3.0,8/8/2010,"Great place to socialize but I wouldn't recommend coming here if you are hungry.I think I counted about 15 supermodel looking women here and about half the tables were filled with mingling women in the mid twenties to low thirties and the other half had women who looked like they should be in a taping of Sex and the City. I did spot a few gents, all of them were reallllly happy looking, hahahahaha. Good place to meet women it seems!Drink wise this place is legit. I had an awesome strawberry mojito like cocktail that was so delicious that I didn't realize I downed the whole drink within a few minutes. I was impressed by the food as the flavor was delicious (the french onion soup dumplings and beef wellington left me speechless) and teh offerings were unique but the price to food ratio was exorbitant. Word to the wise gents-if you plan on bringing a date here, expect to pay an arm and a leg for her to get full. Also, there's loud music playing here so it sets the atmosphere to feel more like a bar than a romantic dinner spot. I'd come here again if out of town friends were to visit but I'm not sure I'd include this venue in my rolodex of regular restaurants to dine at.

2.0,8/8/2010,"I was really looking forward to eating here and was simply not impressed.  I was meeting an old friend from college who was visiting NYC and another friend.  I love the ambiance here.   It seemed like a perfect place to have dinner before going out to bars in the LES.  Unfortunately, it's also way too loud and so not the best place if you're hoping to catch up with someone. We got there kind of early and so we had a drink at the bar upstairs.I don't mind pay $13 for a cocktail in NYC because they're usually well made, delicious and served by a very good looking person.  The pineapple martini was too sweet and literally had no alcohol, none.  Same with my friends cocktails, just unbearably sweet and no alcohol. Anyway, we sit down and I order a dirty martini.  I don't know how they managed it, but this too had no alcohol.  As for the food - way overpriced for what you're getting.  Here's my breakdown:- French onion soup dumplings: these were good, but nothing earth shattering. - Goat cheese perogies - eh.  Just average.  Perhaps people rave about these b/c it's their first time having perogies. - Red Snapper tacos - this was the biggest disappointment.  I was looking forward to these the most.  They're super small and I could barely taste the fish with all the other junk on it. - Grilled Octopus - served with sauce on it and crostinis.  This was my favorite, but still not worth the price for the amount that you get. - Mac & Cheese - very bland.  Not impressed. - Sweet & sour chicken spring rolls - tasty, but just as good as any chinese takeout.- Kobe beef slider - my friend said these were delicious.  At $7 for ONE slider, I'm not impressed.  There was nothing special about it. Anyway, the food is just not original and it's way way overpriced.  You should save your money and go to one of the many awesome restaurants in the area.   i left  having had 3 martinis and not even buzzed.",4,1,2,Katie S.,"Brooklyn, NY",37,196,2
3.0,8/5/2010,"damn, i wanted to like the stanton social. it's been proclaimed ""amazing"" and ""moan-worthy"" by some of my favorite and most trusted yelpers, and the low-lit, sophisticated, and sexy atmosphere is so my scene. but like freebird, the da vinci code, and glee before it, this overrated trend just doesn't live up to the hype.i came to new york with plans for a fabulous ladies night at TSS, but the food was decisively not worth the money and lacking in the flavor department. the pineapple martini and grapefruit-mint martini were perfect, a definite recommend, and i did enjoy a few of the dishes. the chipotle shrimp was the best for sure; the feta-tomatillo combo was totally fresh and tasty, and the sweet shrimp were huge and perfectly cooked. the chicken and waffle was pretty good; great flavor on the chicken, but the waffle was burnt. and i loved the mustard-maple combo on the apple and brie quesadilla; really inventive and delicious.but sadly, the dishes that were the most memorable were the least enjoyable. the creamy pierogies have a fun surprise in their addition of goat cheese, but the truffle creme fraiche was not good. at all. and i did not care for the watermelon-ginger martini, which tasted like gnawing on a ginger root soaked in brandy. but the crabcake ""corn dog"" was the dish that left me the most unsatisfied. instead of the cylinder of lump crabmeat surrounded by a thin crust of blue cornmeal i had expected, i received what was essentially a fishy-tasting hush puppy on a stick. there was no crab to speak of, and the best thing i can say is that the dipping sauce was mildly tasty. the desserts were equally meh; the red velvet twinkie with its not-quite-tangy-enough cream cheese filling, and the blackberry-mango empanada with little to no mango and an extremely dry crust. the food is well-plated and imaginative, that's for sure. but i hardly think that creativity presentation at the sake of flavor is a good business plan for a restaurant.i visit new york pretty frequently, to see many of my east coast friends who have migrated to the big apple; and had lots of them drooling over the idea of red velvet twinkies. but i suppose that's what happens to things that get super trendy and hyped up; the reality rarely comes close to the legend.",5,3,4,Kris G.,"Alameda, CA",305,325,599
3.0,8/3/2010,"This is what NYC considers decent tapas?  Really?I may be a ""country mouse in the Big City"" but I'm not stupid... if I get there at 9:25 for my 9:30 reservation and you tell me to wait upstairs and have a ($15) drink while you prep the table... I'm not buying it.  And you didn't even surprise me by following through with that obviously empty promise to come get me when the table was ready (apparently that takes a good half hour in NYC?).  Thanks for the warm welcome, you super cool and prestigious NYC restaurant, you.I'll admit that the drinks are notably fantastic. I had a basil lime gimlet, strawberry fields, AND a grapefruit mint martini - country mouse knows how to drink!The food is good, but not as impressive as it would need to be to get such a cold shoulder upon entry (ahem, The French Laundry treats it's patrons better, and that's unquestionably a better meal).  The bite-sized Caesar salad as a complimentary amuse = cute & excellent, the red snapper tacos = excellent and very flavorful, the mushroom risotto = sub-par and doused in lemon juice, the ribs = incredibly tender but average flavor, the chicken spring rolls = uneventful, the goat cheese ravioli = boring and overly peppered, the chicken 'n waffles = Gladys Knight would have a heart attack if she knew her famous dish was being butchered this badly (non-fried chicken on top of a Bisquik-caliber Belgian waffle and drizzled with balsamic vinagrette?  As a Georgia girl, I'm appalled), the pasta dish = average and Sbarro caliber, but luckily the dessert was a total highlight... homemade donut holes accompanied by 3 dipping sauces (of which the caramel was the star) and served with a Makers Mark spiked ""milkshake"" that I wish was of the 12oz variety.Overall, a good meal with positively fabulous company, but considering it's NYC, I would have expected FAR better from such a highly rated establishment.  Country mouse = not impressed.",4,2,0,Ashley F.,"Irving, TX",320,369,97
3.0,8/2/2010,"This is a review of brunch, haven't had any other courses here:If you're looking for comfort food on a Saturday morning after a night out, you won't find it here. Stanton Social is hip and classy and its food follows suite. A culinary experience. We got a bunch of plates to share (since the food is ""designed for sharing""... more on that in a bit). Would highly recommend trying out the goat cheese  perogies and the red-snapper tacos. Really quite good. We tried the french onion soup dumplings that everybody is raving about and I found them to be a bit too salty. That all said, I'm going with 3 stars because the food is not quite good enough to justify the price. Some of the small plates are reasonably priced, but some are $14/$15 for a couple of pieces. Worse still - they charge $3 for a cup of tea or drip coffee!! (and no, it's regular old drip coffee, not Jamaican Blue Mountain or anything like that)Last thing: ""designed for sharing"". This is an obnoxious euphemism I've seen popping up at a lot of places. Dear restaurant owners: unless it comes in a huge bowl and is served with tongs or an enormous spoon, it's not ""designed"" for sharing. This is akin to calling those tiny chocolate bars ""fun sized"".

Goat cheese was too mild and you were basically using the flavorless pierogie as a vehicle to deliver the truffle creme fraiche down your throat.-Wasabi pea crusted salmon. Weird concept. Overwhelmingly crunchy and salty crust completely dominated the flavor of the fish.  Barely edible.-Kobe beef sliders. Likewise way too salty.-Doughnuts and cookies.

When I saw the rave reviews for this place, and a four star average on yelp amongst 500+ users, I thought surely this place would impress and woo her. On the contrary, almost everything about this place disappointed me. The food was mediocre-- good but really nothing to rave about. We ordered 8 different things (which is A LOT for two people) and not a single dish really stood out or surprised me or gave me that wonderful feeling of awe I usually get when I eat delicious, gourmet food. And the ambiance! Can we say CONTRIVED?! It was totally faux bougie. The annoying techo-ish lounge music was a total buzz kill. I felt like I was in a movie scene that was TRYING to be New York. The service was also meh. Kind of slow. Not very personal. Basically, everything was just sub-par, which stands out as an even bigger disappointment if your expecting the best. Good cocktails though. In any case, Im totally bummed I chose to spend my one night with my best friend at this restaurant.

Wild Mushroom Risotto Cakes- pleasantly surprised. I wasn't excited for them, but they were delicious. Maryland Jumbo Lump Crabcake ""Corndogs"" - What can I say, I'm from Annapolis and I'm a crabcake snob. These were good. Were they as good as Jerry's Seafood crab bombs or Edgewater Restaurant's jumbolump crab cakes? No (in fairness these were just different).

Needless to say, I don't actually actually remember the names. Let's just say that 4 were tried, a couple were repeated, and all were excellent.      Since I was dining the experienced Stanton patrons, they knew the highlights (French Onion Pops, Chicken & Waffles, Potato Perogies, Crab Cake Corndogs) and we threw in a couple that were new to them (Meatballs, Salmon). All but the chicken and waffles were outstanding and those weren't terrible either.   For dessert we topped it off with the freah doughnuts with dipping sauce and called it a night. A good time was had by all and I will definitely be back, hopefully before 2012!",2,0,0,Billy C.,"Westfield, NJ",4,37,0

I heard drinks were amazing here but didn't have the chance to liquor up, just too early for me.Chef Chris definitely had creative cuisine tht actually exceeded my expectations.Breakfast bruschetta- eggs done perfectly in a soft scramble on crusty sourdough baguette with pesto drizzle & asiago shavings and a splash of spicy sauce. Overall combo is a delight. Baby waffles- light, fluffy with an outer crunch. Served w a sweet creamy sauce and blueberries w crunchy granules of sugar. French onion soup dumplings- crunchy outside, savory inside with gyrure cheese melted all over the top. It's more like a dumpling with soup filling, not soup w. dumplingsQuesadilla- More like fillo dough than a tortilla. This gives it a good crunchy texture. Green apples paired w creamy sweet Brie offset quite well by a drizzle of wasabi oil.Grilled cheese slider w/ fried tomato and jalapeño bacon- Good, but not amazing.

I was whisked away by the good grace of a few subway trains and arrived to find this, the most glorious restaurant that I have ever had the pleasure of dining at.Although the seating arrangement was rather cosy this only served to contribute to the ethos of the establishment - the dining here (as I'm sure most of you guys know) is designed for sharing. I *love* sharing food. If nothing else it means that one can try a touch of everything and there is oh-so-much-of-everything going on here. I have yet to find a better restaurant for this very purpose. There were several of us partaking in the food orgy and so we ordered around seven or eight dishes. Man they just kept coming! It was bloomin' awesome - the squid rolls (which have a much more delightful name than that, which I forget) were just delicious. The mini burgers (also with a better name) literally melted in my mouth and Mac and Cheese was unlike anything I've ever tried in my life. The food here simply put my entire history of cuisine experience to shame. Don't even get me started on the chocolate tasting session dessert and *ahem* red *velvet* twinky. That's the kind of twinky I want if the world is coming to an end. Or just the kind I want always and forever now. I dream in red velvet twinky.Yeah, so I've been a tad on the verbose side about this one, but it was  utterly amazing. Thank you world for making this happen.

Anyways the dining room was packed, so the hostess sent up upstairs to the lounge. The place is sooo dark that I'm praying I don't trip and fall, but the ambiance is very cool, upscale/chill is the feeling I get. We make a beeline for this cute corner on the couches in the lounge and get to making our digestive decisions. I got the strawberry fields and my friend got the blood orange and jalapeno margarita, both awesome! We also ordered a 1/2 dozen oysters, the lobster roll, pickles, and the red snapper tacos.

The lamb souvlakis were juicy with a good bit of spice and heat (not exactly what I'd term a souvlaki, but it was still good).  The mac and cheese was gooey and just plain ole yummy.  The beef wellington was cooked properly to a nice medium rare with a nice crispy dough, the sauce it stood in though was a bit too vineagery.  the red snapper tacos were good with a nice citrus bite to them.  The short rib tacos were tasty enough to make up for how dry they were (oh well, just take another drink or two).  We couldn't pass up the red velvet twinkies and the doughnuts.  The red velvet was fairly dry, but the rich creamy filling helped out.  The doughnuts were amazing and the caramel and strawberry (or was it raspberry?) dipping sauces matched the doughnut so well, however the chocolate sauce was a bit too dark/bitter for the airy doughnuts.  I left still wanting to try more on the menu, but just couldn't work it out with my full belly or my wallet.This place isn't cheap if you want to really fill yourself up, but was definitely worth it for such a fun dining experience to share with friends.  Oh, and those stairs are dangerous, can't see how those wouldn't cause a few problems after a long night of drinking.",0,1,0,Russell B.,"Fontana, CA",25,162,5

All the flavors went so well together and I particularly liked the added kick from the chorizo. -The kobe sliders were FANTASTIC and i loved the little bun they came on.

Now I pour over the reviews, blogs, yelps, comments etc etc before making a resto choice, and usually my selections are pretty good,,,but..the Hot Pocket eater makes his picks for the most obtuse reasons and they ALWAYS turn out awesome.Why SS? Because LOML read that Matt Damon went there once and ordered 50 lobsters to go for all his friends. And LOML loves Jason Bourne. In fact, we made a trip to Paris just so he could get a pic next to the Pont Neuf bridge, or the Bourne Bridge as he calls it. He's a character, that one.Anyway, damn, what a great place. Food was great. Loved the souvlaki, red snapper tacos and the chicken & waffles especially, but everything we shared was great.The stand out dessert is the Chocolate Sampler, but the Red Velvet twinkie was great also. Drank way too many of the fancy drink with the cranberries~yum",3,3,2,Karin G.,"New York, NY",185,568,7
4.0,4/26/2010,"This place was recommended by a friend and we went there for a 2pm Brunch on a Saturday. The place was moderately crowded and I liked the relaxed atmosphere. I am a huge fan of the small plates or ""tapas"" concept but if you are not don't go there for brunch. The cocktails are - as the food - little bit pricey (13 USD) but really delicious. I highly recommend the pancakes, the Pierogies, red snapper tacos (perfect spiciness) and the egg&steak. The lamb souvlakies and french onion soup dumplings were good too. However, I wasn't a big fan of their version of Mac&Cheese, it just was too soggy and the tomatoas didn't work for me.If you don't mind paying a premium price for high quality small plates and you like sharing family style then definitely go there.  If not, then don't waste your time.   I'll be going there again...",1,1,1,Andreas P.,"New York, NY",6,6,0

Most of of the other dishes tasted pretty much the same as each other - plenty of crunch with no taste.  Not to mention a burst pipe put our table essentially dining in a river.  Saving graces included a comped dessert (check out our pics) and the lobster pizzetta.

I love the idea of ordering lots of small plates to share for brunch, and I also love that they brought out each dish just as we finished eating the previous one. Onion Soup Dumplings and Walnut Banana bread were outstanding, the spicy lamb souvlakis were very good, and the lobster benedict sounded like it was going to be amazing but the lobster was slightly overcooked.

First stop, Stanton Social, tapas brunch style with minimalism concept, both ambiance and proportion. Sharing is greatly encouraged. In fact, it's recommended for each person to get at least two orders granted the portion is very small.-spicy lamb souvlakis. tzatziki, lime & harrisa aioli. the lamb is moist and tasty.- french onion soup dumpling. not your regular french onion soup or dumpling. cheesy goodness.- potato & goat cheese pierogies. caramelized onions and truffle creme fraiche. very delish!-croque monsieur satays - mini brioche, country ham, gruyere & muenster. little bundles of heaven.-spicy lobster benedict, spinach and chipotle hollandaise. the lobster is so chewy, I think I'll pass next time.- Rhode Island lobster rolls. kobe beef philly sliders, truffle & goat cheese fondue. mediocre tasting... next!!-banana caramelized pancakes. candied pecans, vanilla brown sugar & maple syrup. We got a winner, here! So mouth-watering and fluffy.The overall experience was a hit and miss. I love some of the dishes but weren't blown away with couple of them.

Made my 100 in 3 months...   the first 60 or so was a breeze but the last dozen took some doing...  gonna be taking a break as I'm going back to the mother land for some serious eating...  too bad there's no yelp in Asia....So I went to  Stanton for a very special bday and sunday evening really is the time to dine around this part of town if you're not into crowds and drunken peeps running around the streets....The place will suggest 2-3 dishes per person.  I think 2 is too little so thinking 2.5 to 3 will suffice.thestantonsocial.com/men…Here's what i had:5 Stars - French onion dumplings.  You get 6 so plan accordingly when sharing cause everyone will want at least 2-3 pieces each...4 Stars - Roasted octopus.  Beautifully made and just melts in your mouth which is not what usually happens with octopus.  Sauce was excellent and 3 pieces of bread were drowned to finish off the dish..3 Stars - Creekstone short ribs taco - well done but not very memorable.  I've had better and this is one of the pricier items on the menu...2 Stars - Kobe beef burger.  No biggie and would pass on all future tries2 Stars- Lobster roll...  what can I say... i compare all lobster rolls with Pearls and this was just nothing close...3 1/2 Stars - Philly cheese steak slider.  It was okay but heck i compare all philly cheesesteaks with Delasandro's in Philly....Pass on all sliders in the future.  They range from $7-$10 i think and not worth it...4 Stars - herb fries were excellent and tasty..4 Stars - Mac and cheese...  made with chorizo and tomatoes and flaky crunchy topping.  I thought it was great.  Not overwhelming cheese taste and overall well balanced with all it's ingredients...Skipped desserts but i really had my eye on the red velvet twinkie or the warm donuts or bailey's toffee cake.. oh well.. next time...There's sooo much on the menu and things I've had and still want to try....  The really one memorable thing is always going to be the french onion dumplings...  I don't even like french onion soup but this creation is just a big hit and makes me crave and come back for more....The mixed drinks are $13 bucks and the average price on a bottle of wine is $50.  This place ain't cheap and with a group... be careful as it can start to add up...  expect to pay at least $50 per person not including the alcohol....I enjoy this place but sometimes really not sure if it's worth the price you pay...  Maybe they should change it up a bit and add some new flavors to the mix....,6,1,4,JulieJuli A.,"New York, NY",151,210,52
1.0,3/24/2010,"I spent $150 on ""dinner"" for two which amounted to little more than a few small snacks.  This was supposed to be dinner but the portions on the 4 plates we ordered were ridiculously small.  I do not have a large appetite.  If you want a full meal for two with 2 drinks each  plan on about $100 per person.  Part of my anger is directed at OpenTable - which listed this as a moderately priced restaurant ($$ out of a possible $$$$).  I've been to many expensive restaurants in the city but this is probably the most expensive yet for a real meal.  The food tasted good but honestly the anxiety over sharing the tiny portions far outweighed any pleasure I got from the food.",2,0,0,Ned T.,"New York, NY",0,9,0

2.0,3/20/2010,"The biggest mistake was I went there for a brunch, and the second mistake was I ordered food there. They should not open for ""brunch"", or at least they should not say it has a ""brunch"" menu. Everything I had from the ""brunch"" menu was a sub-par bar food which you need to be fully drunk to eat it and not get upset. I studied the brunch reviews here and ordered French onion soup, brie quesadilla, red snapper tacos, kobe beef sliders, potato latkes, and mac & cheese. The sliders and tacos were fine but everything else was extremely disappointing. The saving grace was Cucumber-Vanilla Cosmopolitan. It was the BEST cosmo I've ever had. Extremely refreshing, light, delicate, with wonderful after-taste.

1.0,3/18/2010,"If I could rate this restaurant with ZERO stars I would... I had the worst dinning experience at the Stanton Social. My husband & I took my son out for his 23rd birthday. I was excited to take my son to this resturant along with his girl friend, my daughter & her boyfriend.  what should have been a birthday celebration turned into an unforgetable traumatizing nightmare. While dining there was a water bug, Yes a HUGE WATERBUG that crawled from the table onto and down my arm. The waitress came over to ask if everything was ok once she observed me jumping out of my chair. Shortly after the manager came over. He did not apologize and when I told him that I would like to change tables he seemed annoyed and asked if our whole party wanted to move to another table as if I was going to move to another table alone. Prior to that experience we had to send back a pitcher of water that had something black resembling a bug in it. After we moved tables we still had 2 plates of food coming to us but we told the waiter that we had lost our appetites and our night was ruined. Once they took the food away we waited for a birthday dessert they were supposed to bring out for my son, that we had reminded them at the restaurant to bring out as well as on the phone when we made the reservation. They reassured us before dinner started that they would bring it out at the end of the meal but they NEVER did. We were bought the check without so much as an apology from the manager, instead he was sitting at one of the tables texting on his cell phone the whole time. We paid the bill which they did not even have the courtesy to compensate for the horrible dining experience we had.  As we were leaving I addressed the hostess to let her know what a bad experience we had and that they had never bought the birthday dessert that they kept reassuring they would bring, and instead of an apology her response was ""Thank you for coming."" We dine at fine restaurants often and made the reservation to The Stanton Social expecting nothing but good things and to have a great time and ended up having one of the worst dining experiences ever. I felt like the staff handled the situation very unprofessionally and made us all uncomfortable. A night that should have been special for my sons birthday ended up being ruined thanks to The Stanton Social, the staff and mostly THE MANAGER( I believe his name is Robert)._Carol R.",6,1,0,Carol R.,"Maspeth, NY",4,12,19

4.0,3/14/2010,"Went here for my birthday a few days ago with a group of 8. I had to give them my credit card for a reservation which i found odd. They have a 24 hour cancellation policy like the doctors office.  Also, they said everyone had to be there within 15 minutes which also made me very nervous. This ended up not being the cause cause they seated us even though one of my friends came an hour late. Very good food. Everything we had was delicious. Small portions (they were tapas -- i think everything on the menu is) so we were all kind of unsatisfied at the end-- everyone was saying they were gonna go for pizza when we left. One tapas dish i realized was 18$ after we ordered 3 of them.  Kind of a sticker shock there. The ambiance was great, and it was totally packed on a thursday night. The music was a little loud for my taste - i like to hear my friends at dinner, and not have to shout.  Overall its great for a happy hour kind of dinner with friends, but i wouldnt go there on a date simply because of the noise factor. Our service was great, the waitress made recommendations on what to order and we followed her advice, and she totally knew what she was doing. Everything came out super fast, including drinks. Major bonus since we were all starving. Overall if you are famished and go there for dinner it will definitely cost you about 50$ a person at least.  If you are ok with that then this place is totally cool.",1,0,0,Diana S.,"Boulder, CO",0,31,1

Came here a bit earlier talked to the host she sat down I would say ten min before we where suppose to be seated. The waitress, we will call her waiters A, was very nice and pleasant and introduced herself. Explained how everything works; being here first time and all. Placed an order of I would say 6 or so different thing from the menu, and some drinks.The drinks arrived I would say there where pretty good, right amount of alcohol right amount of what ever else.  Then about five minutes later the food started to arrive, and yes everything there is two bites and just enough to share with you and the person you are with. They don't just bring out one dish at a time so you eat and wait for the next, they bring out two at once so you can enjoy different once. You are not rushed to scarf down your food, which is rare for a change. The waitress does check on you here and there to see how everything is going.The food itself is good, fresh, and right from the kitchen all the flavors go well together. The Mac and cheese was really good hot, good cheese and the right amount. At first it might seem you did not order enough food but wait till you get to your 3rd or 4th dish, assuming you pace yourself and enjoy what you're eating. You will start to feel full but would still want to get more food.At some point our waiters (A) had to leave and introduced new waiters that will be taken care of us (waiters B). Something I have not experienced before, and it was cool because at least we knew to whom to turn too when we needed something.When the check came we paid it but miss calculated the total amount, and left the restaurant not realizing what happened till we got home. Called the restaurant to see what was charged and surprisingly the waitress added everything up correctly and charged the right amount. This is also something un-heard of.As for the decor of this place it gives a feeling of being in quite relax environment where no rushes you the music is nice and relaxing not to loud and not to soft so you will be able to hear the person you are talking to.

4.0,2/16/2010,"My lady friend and I came into Stanton Social on Sunday morning after a rather late Saturday, coincidentally it was also Valentines day. We had no booking but soon enough we found ourselves downstairs wedged between two couples, one big line of thighs uncomfortably meeting for the first time. To say it was awkward was an understatement, we were out to have a bit of fun, our neighbours were there for a serious V day breakfast, whatever was going on they needed someone to spike their drinks. This was my first time at Stanton Social and I found the service a little rigid, maybe it was just a product of Valentines day. After a cursory glance at the menu we ordered a couple of bloody marys and informed the waiter that we did not intend to eat, as the downstairs tables are for eating customers we were escorted upstairs to a lounge at the bar. Thank god. The upstairs space is really cool, a few small tables for eating, a set of lounges for reclining and gentle lighting courtesy of the skylight and the rustic metal lamps above the bar.We happily settled in, content in the privacy of our thoughts and low key discussion. The bloody marys were good, although were a victim of too much ice and vodka in a short glass, leaving the consistency a little thin and watery. We ordered additional tomato juice to top them up, the tomato juice mixture was perfect, 9/10, rich with fresh horseradish, Worcestershire and perfectly seasoned.

My favorite dishes have been the Red Snapper Tacos, Grilled Apple & Brie Quesadilla, Bittersweet Chocolate Spiked Pancakes, and Armando's Huevos Rancheros Soft Tacos.  Of the sliders we;ve tried the Kobe Philly, Grilled 'Cheese', and the Sausage, Biscuit, & Gravy all of which were delicious but may have put us over the top in heaviness :oP Except for the sliders, the other dishes are all shared family style which adds to the restaurant's ambiance and warmth.

1.0,2/10/2010,"wow. i'm a bit taken aback by the reviews here. This is provably the most overhyped, overpriced place i've experienced in Manhattan. Let me qualify that a bit further by saying you should not go here hungry looking to eat dinner. The service is fine. the dishes are okay. The prices are beyond exorbitant. The words ""small portion sizes"" do not begin to properly describe the servings. The portions are tiny. i went there in a group of 6, around 10p on a Friday night. We sat upstairs because they had a table available right away in a cozy nook towards the front. We shared our area with a 2 other girls who were already there. I, for one, don't mind being seated near people I don't know; i'm a social creature like that. The crowd was made up primarily of people in their early to mid 20's. The decor itself was nothing special.The food was okay. Given the size of our group, we sampled a pretty extensive portion of the menu. Be warned, the portions are insanely small. The French Onion Dumplings were a hit; they also provably the most healthy portions of any item on the menu. However, each dumpling was no more than an inch in diameter, about the size of your thumb from the knuckle to the tip. The Kobe Beef Burger sliders were okay, nothing insanely special. The sashimi was low grade. The red snapper tacos were very nice. My favorite dish was a bruschetta with goat cheese and piquillo pepper. I had 2 servings because I knew I would not be returning.  I was still hungry after everything. Most of us only had 1 drink with dinner, as we were going out after. Our grand total was a little over $300. My biggest complaint about this place is the portion size. It's simply not worth it. For example (i've used this one before), I can go to Buddakan and get healthier portions on more creative dishes in a far more stylish environment for less. If your aim is to party in the Lower East Side, just catch a cab after your meal. It's not that far. Needless to say, I wont be returning.",5,1,1,Ariel J.,"New York, NY",32,79,34

3.0,2/3/2010,"We came here on a Saturday night around 10p.m. and went upstairs to the bar area.  It was already crowded and we eventually found a spot at the bar as a small group was leaving.  Thank goodness for that because it became really, really crowded as the night went on.  The crowd at the bar area was mid to late 20s and decent looking.  The people eating at the tables upstairs were actually all pretty young.  They looked like NYU students eating out on Mommy and Daddy's dime.  Well, I guess this IS the LES after all.  My friend had a  Cucumber and ? Martini from the cocktail menu.  I tried it and it was delicious so I would definitely recommend it.  The bartenders were attentive and courteous.  My friend ended up losing her purse even though it was hooked underneath the bar right in front of her.  The manager was very helpful in looking for it and gave us his card so we could contact the place for more information.  It turns out someone took it by mistake and turned it over to a hotel in midtown where we picked it up.  My point in telling this story is, again, that the crowd might be a little on the young, drunk and irresponsible side so just be aware of that.  All in all, the ambience was trendy and I'd definitely come back for a drink sometime.",2,1,1,Elsa G.,"New York, NY",176,189,3

4.0,1/28/2010,"This place has very good things, but also there are some pretty serious negatives.You should know before you go there that this is a tapas bar. You're going to get small portions of multiple kinds of food. It's expensive, but you get what you pay for.The meal started off well with some free tapas, which is a nice touch, and every single thing I ate was absolutely fantastic. We ran the gambit with everything from lobster tails and oysters to rabbit sausage. Each thing was made to perfection and nicely presented.Now the bad: the portions are TINY. If you're a guy like me, you generally want to go to a place where you will be full after the end of the meal, and in NY you don't mind paying up for that privilege. With this place, I left feeling a little hungry, which was too bad because the food was so good.The reason that I give it four stars even though the portions are tiny is that no matter what I ate (and to be honest, I was adventurous) was unbelievably delicious, far beyond anything I could've imagined before I arrived.",2,0,1,Henry H.,"New York, NY",115,93,0

4.0,1/22/2010,"Its has been a while since I first went to Stanton Social, the upstairs lounge specifically, to have a drink in a weekday after a fantastic dinner at Congee Village Bowery. We were 4 people in the table. The couple in front of us, lets say ""Ari""  and ""Suzie"" ordered 2 drinks and the Grilled Pizzetta which I didn't try but that smelled delicious and it didn't produce other that a pleasant gesture on them. Suzie and Ari were trying to find out if we were having a second date, since they could detect high attraction and certain seduction game (Ari), or a third date (Suzie) since it looked to her that there was also a lot of confidence and complicity between us, a sign of more frequent encounters. ""I think they have even been together for 1 month already"" is what she said when we all were talking about it a bit later. Yes, I met Suzie and Ari that night at the table since they were seated there right after us .. and we socialize with them and we had a pleasant and funny conversation about gender differences and in fact a correspondence between each one ideas and gender; with me being agree with Suzie and my friend being agree with Ari. That you will be seated with others at the same table looks to be the regular behaviour at Stanton Social since it happen to me a few months later when I was back with a friend, a girl this time, to have again a drink since I liked the ones that I had that day back when I met Ari and Suzie . If you like this or not depends of different factors; you, your mood, who is your companion, how are the others (remember that you don't choose them.. they are imposed).  I have to say that I liked both times. Even the first one; it was really funny.  You can always stay in the bar area, tho; which it was my intention the second time but we couldn't get an spot.  The crowd at Stanton Social was in a range from middle twenties to late thirties; it was older during the week. It was always nice and is easy to socialize if you want. Either the hostess, which I never could find out her name, as well as Nikki, our waitress was extremely nice and professionals. Designed by AvroKo, the team that some of you already know I'm crazy about, you can't other than expect a beautiful space. Stanton Social is sexy, trendy, soft lights but not dark, more like glowing in gold, with botanical painted in the walls, and leather sofas. The tables can easily accommodate groups of 6 to 8 people. There is groups of female/male friends playing gender games. Its also a place to bring a date. The drinks menu offer from wines to cocktails that was always my selection. The combinations are interesting. Among the ones that I tried, I highly recommend the Pineapple 75 Martini and mostly the Basil-Lime Gimlet a mix of  Belvedere vodka, muddled basil leaves, lemon syrup and fresh lime juice. I also tried the Cranberry Flower and the Bea's Gin-Lemon Mojito. It wasn't as good but still I enjoyed it as well. Fresh ingredients/herbs is a characteristic in all the drinks. Said this and having clear that I enjoyed the ambiance, somehow I'm not very excited about the place. Its loud, the music wasn't very good, not bad either, and I didn't feel like socializing with the groups I saw. But it could be that particular night. Also, they are too generous with the ice in the drinks and so it gets cold and the flavor gets diluted soon which I really don't like. But still; if I'm in the area I'll definitely come back. And I'll order again the Basil-Lime Gimlet. I still remember the scents of the fresh basil. I also wanna try the food at the restaurant, downstairs. I took a look to the menu on line and I got really excited about it. French Onion Soup Dumplings... In between, Ari was right.

5.0,1/14/2010,"I like a certain level of extravagance. Not all the time and not black tie, but I like dressing up a bit and indulging. Especially on special occasions and Stanton Social is a good place for this. Even as you walk in you get an instant impression of its vibe: cool, low-lit, trendy. To start, their specialty cocktails, served both in the cozy second floor bar-lounge and the high ceilinged first floor restaurant, are very well mixed and more varied than ""this is our special margarita because we use [insert liquor here].""  When we were brought to our table (we scored one of the cozy circular booths) we were given a complimentary glass of champagne to begin our celebration, a very nice gesture.Food is served ""family style,"" though I prefer to think of it as American-tapas. Family style always makes me think of large plates sitting in the middle of the table with large spoons dangling out of piles of pasta. These are small-plates with anywhere from 2 to 8 bites each. We shared the warm piquillo pepper bruschetta (2 servings), wild mushroom risotto cakes (3 servings), pulled chicken arepas (3 servings), short rib tacos (3 servings), yellowfin tuna sashimi (6 or 8 servings), and lobster rolls (1 per order). It seems like so much food, but the plates are quite small... small and delicious.Initially I had selected a bottle of bordeaux but they were sold out of it and we chose a rioja instead. Our waitress, who I'd like to add was just darling, commented that it was one of her favorite wines and that it was a better selection. Granted, this could be just something wait-staff is supposed to say but she wasn't wrong. This wine was delicious: spicy and just the right amount of dry. My fellow celebrant ordered a glass of ice wine at the end of our meal to go with our shared desserts of  warm donuts that come with dipping sauces (caramel, bittersweet chocolate, and raspberry) and the apple pie sundae (warm apple bites, pie crust crumbs, and cinnamon ice cream). I left feeling full, happy, and sated.The negatives? It's pretty loud in there. Granted, after a little you adjust to the noise level and start talking louder or get closer to your dining partners (depending on who you eat with this could be good or bad). Speaking of getting closer, it's also pretty crowded in here. We visited on a Wednesday night and it was busy, I can only imagine a Saturday night and a Sunday brunch.

4.0,1/12/2010,"What is a Stanton Social? Someone who boozes over little bites? Someone who can only be understood through eye contact, body language, and reading of the lips? Someone who is trapped in an upscale portion of the LES? A Stanton Social is anyone who you want to be once you give in to THE Stanton Social. Stanton Social is everything obnoxious and over the top. It's so cool you morph into cool without being a poser. I had some out of town guests and I took them to Stanton Social to give them a lasting impression of NYC. I think I succeeded. It wasn't an every day meal. It was an escape to some alternate universe where your taste buds get laced with gold and your ability to reason somehow loses you. Perhaps going to Stanton Social wasn't the most responsible thing to do. When I got the check my mouth dropped when I found out we were charged $30 for exactly four bites of miso glazed fish. Talk about throwing away money. Welcome to the New York I don't live in. While I'm working OT, saving for my down, retirement, and making the rent, there are people in NYC who don't blink an eye at $8 a chew. Anyhows I shrank in my seat as I realized half of my table was unemployed. Tallying up the scores we had still come out ahead with the crabcake corn dogs, a kobe philly and a lobster roll. They were spectacular! We had a few of the other typical dishes and they were all exquisite for the moment. The Stanton Social really knows how to craft little things. If they're not brushed with butter, a glaze, fried or baked, they're dusted with sugar, dolloped with cream, or sprinkled with something diced. I really feel like I'm snacking at the Oscars when I'm at The Stanton Social.Not many people talk about the desserts at The Stanton Social. You've already spent over a hundred bucks for dinner. Why not twenty dollars more for something sweet? The doughnuts were an obvious hit but I loved the red velvet twinkie even more. It reminded me of a baby buche de noel.

It was one of those evenings where you wanted to indulge, and indulge we did.Thanks to the family-style dining, most of us were able to sample from the small plate menu - from vegetarian only, to sliders for the carnivores - we had it all. Couple that with wine and whisky, the celebration continued.Noteworthy dishes that had 6 different palates exclaiming over are as follows:French Onion Soup Dumplings  - all you want in a French Onion soup wrapped in a tender package.Wild Mushroom Risotto Cakes - the wild mushrooms looked like bacon, and nearly fooled us non-pork eaters with it's smoky flavor and crispy texture. So this is the sensation I've been missing...Social Mac & Cheese - with the chorizo on the side, all were able to sample and savor. It was nice and cheesy with the right amount of bite to the pasta.Seared Foie Gras  - this was shared a deux, and I'm glad we didn't share with anyone else. Could have done without the vanilla risotto griddlecake, but the foie gras was gorgeous!When you want to celebrate, you want to go to a place that can embrace your celebration.

When the majority of us were running late, the staff had no problems changing the reservation time at the last minute.

5.0,12/1/2009,"I am giving this place five stars on the fun I had here and the high quality of the food. There are certainly better places out there but I had a great experience when I went here. Firstly, my and my dining partner arrived on a Friday night (8:00 PM) and snagged the only open table in the place without a reservation (our reservation was for 11:30 PM).Pros:The food wassmall and shared plate experience. The food here was of very high quality and the wait staff was able to, for the large part, time the dishes coming out of the kitchen so when we were done with one dish the next was ready. This was true with all except the last dish (Fried Chicken and Waffles) so that was slightly cold when we started eating it. I really enjoyed the Octopus and Chorizo dish, surprising since I do not really like seafood. The other great dishes we had were the Kobe beef phillys and grilled cheese sandwiches (spicy!). The drinks coming from the bar were very strong but not overly strong, so basically pretty perfect. The donuts we had for dessert were fresh and hot and plentiful, I found it a challenge to get through 2 of them, that's how rich they are!. Overall I really liked this place and would love to go back.Cons:The seating was slightly cramped with me in a booth with a long shared bench with people to my left and right. We had to shift the table to get in and out, that's how cramped these seats were. Also the tables could be made smaller so as to make a bigger aisle for the comfort of the person who is sitting in the seat. My dining partner was constantly being bumped into and it is a problem that could easily be solved. There's only one shared bathroom in the lower dining room so there can be a wait. We were also surrounded by some lame people (one couple feeding each other) and one couple about to get into a fight over the guy playing on his phone all night and looking at the other ladies in the establishment.So if those cons do not scare you off you will most likely have a wonderful dining experience like I did.",2,2,0,Patrick G.,"Chicago, IL",54,307,50

The Staton Social is a big place with top notch decor and pretty good service. As far as brunch goes the menu consists of small plates (most of them meant for sharing), they're brought to your table continuously so nothing gets cold and you can pace your experience. Plan on getting a couple to share and a couple to selfishly keep to yourself (plates are around $6-12). Portions are small but that's so you can order more plates and try new things. The quality of the food is nearly perfect. Out of everything we tried the best and most memorable were the... -Pancakes (Caramelized Banana w/ candied pecans) ($8): these were tiny (think silver dollar pancakes) but were packed with flavor and were the fluffiest pancakes I've ever had. -Warm Donuts w/ caramel ($8): These were a pile of a few soft warm cinnamon and sugar donut holes served with a warm caramel dipping sauce -Sausage Biscuit and Gravy ($6): This was sadly another small portioned plate but was one of the only good biscuits and gravy I've yet to have in the city.

While we all liked the drinks, we found the prices for them a bit outrageous. Take for example the Black Magic (Guiness & Champagne) which is served in an oh so slender flute and cost $15. The Strawberry Fields was yummy as well but definitely not worth the $13 for the tiny, stout glass it arrived in. Our waitress suggested the six of us order two dishes each and there would be one portion for everyone at the table.

The pass-by dishes were: lobster paella cakes (bland and no lobster flavor) and the smoked ricotta ravioli (unmemorable).

4.0,9/13/2009,"Came here for brunch while visiting family in NYC.  I have been to plenty of small plate restaurants, but aside from dim sum, I had never experienced small plates for brunch.  Turned out to be a great concept!  I can't tell you how many times I am torn at brunch between savory eggs and bacon, and a delicious sounding pancake or waffle.  At the Stanton Social you don't have to choose - in fact, you can try just about everything.  I was in a party of four, which was great because it allowed us to try just about everything on the menu.  Our waiter suggested around 2-3 plates per person, but the menu looked so great that we actually ordered about 4 dishes each.  This may have been a bit of over kill, but everything was so tasty, no one seemed to mind that we were beyond full when we left.  My favorite of the meal was hands down the doughnuts with caramel sauce!  The doughnuts were delivered hot and crisp to our table dusted in a bit of cinnamon and sugar.  And as if that was not decadent enough, they were accompanied by a slightly salty caramel sauce.  Soooo good!On the breakfast side, I also enjoyed both the chocolate chip and the banana pancakes - delicate disks of fluffy goodness.  The lox that came with the bagel was perfect, so smokey and delicious.  Next came the sliders.  Stanton Social has an entire portion of their brunch menu devoted to a variety of sliders: egg cheese and bacon, Kobe sliders, sausage and gravy on a biscuit, grilled cheese with bacon and jalapeno, and cheese steak.  Sliders can be ordered individually to maximize variety.  My boyfriend was in slider heaven - I am not sure I have ever seen him this happy.  His favorite was the Kobe beef, but he enjoyed all four varieties that he consumed.  We also ordered the mini fish tacos which were like a wonderful flavor explosion.  The table loved the pizza and the quesadilla.  And the french onion soup dumplings were a great idea (like an Shanghai XLB but with french ingredients) and super creative.  Other yelpers complain about the atmosphere being pretentious, but at least for brunch our servers were great.  There were plenty of families with children - so I found the restaurant inviting, if not a bit chic for the morning.  Loved the small plates idea for brunch and hope it catches on in SF - I would totally return.",1,0,1,Dana H.,"Portland, OR",35,190,37

In addition to the ridiculously awesome dishes I tried the last time around (refer to first review), here is what I tried this past MondayKobe Beef Sliders - PERFECTLY cooked with a fluffy, yet complementing bun and carmalized onions. Lamb Souvleki (sp?) - No words do justice to this dish. Just go try it.Fish Tacos - I think it was the Red Snapper and my god, it was a real snapper!  Crunchy, baked taco with a concoction of fish, shallots and some super finely chopped veggies. King Prawns, more affectionately known as Gambas - Well spiced, soft, and juicy!

4.0,8/30/2009,This place is super trendy (almost obnoxiously so) but I loved it anyway. I would definitely recommend going in a group of 4-6 to make the 'family style' portions more worthwhile. The best dish of the night were definitely the french onion soup dumplings. I'm not even sure how that works just that we had to order seconds because it was that warm and amazing. A close second would be the peirogies tied with the red snapper tacos. Another great thing about this place is you can't really find certain items (like the aforementioned dumplings) anywhere else. They are definitely being innovative in their fusion and trying new things to much success.The drinks here are a little over-priced though at $13/14 a drink. It's not exactly worth it for me but the great food and fantastic presentation totally are. It's obviously a popular place so don't forget to make a reservation especially for the large groups that make it more fun.,3,0,0,Sabrina M.,"New York, NY",97,157,44
5.0,8/29/2009,"One word for this place: phenomenal! Tucked into a typically seedy chic Lower East Side neighborhood, Stanton Social looks like it belongs in mid-town but it's a welcome site exactly where it is. The room, the wine, the service are all excellent, but the most amazing thing is the eclectic menu of familiar sounding dishes with creative touches, and all in tapas sized servings. So you can try a lot of different flavors. Even if you are going there with someone who is not a foodie he/she will find something that sounds good. Beyond delicious macaroni &amp; cheese (gorgonzola &amp; chorizo!), apple brie quesadillas (!), Kobe beef sliders. I wanted to go back every day last week!

They serve food tapas style so you share with everyone at the table. The first time I went was ok b/c I went with two classmates that have very different palates than mine. So the food they ordered I didn't really care for. You HAVE TO eat the beignets!! I cannot stress this enough people! Beignets!!!The second time I went, was a date. the guy I was with liked the same food as me. We got the mini burgers which are amazing. I don't know how they get so much flavor in such a little package. One of the best burgers I've ever had. We also got the chipotle grilled shrimp, old school meatballs & The herb fries...

3.0,8/12/2009,Good food but why does the music have to be sooooo loud?!?  Maybe it's because we went at 9pm?  and the tables are way too close..but I guess that's New York.  Food is served tapas style and our server recommended 2-3 per person.  We ended up ordering 5 per person because the portions are tiny and my boyfriend and I eat massive amounts.Recommended dishes:-Kobe Beef Sliders-Nori Spiced Tuna Tartare-Social Mac & Cheese-Lobster Roll-Crabcake Corn Dog (although my boyfriend wasn't a fan of this)I would go back again but not on the top of my list.  I'm interested in trying their brunch.,2,1,2,Angela C.,"Gaithersburg, MD",48,91,0

They were little bundles of heaven.- 'Kobe Philly' sliders with a truffle & goat cheese fondue (hands-down the best dish we ordered)- 'Chicken n' Waffles': brick pressed chicken, aged cheddar waffle,corn pudding & balsamic spiked maple syrup.

5.0,8/4/2009,"Fine. You got me. I can't stay away from the lower east side and its hipster chic hotspots. While visiting NYC a wise coworker (Christy B.) recommended Stanton Social to me. After seeing the yelp hype, including that of Nish who I tend to trust, I hit it up late night on a Friday and was able to grab a spot at the bar.Good music playing and a young stylish crowd was in attendance. Not douche-y at all. :)First up was a peach margarita that the bartender convinced me I had to order. Very strong, with a hint of sweet and a delightful lollipop. Not a bad first pick. I asked what was a must order since they had a lot of tapas, and I was dining solo. Based on the bartender favs I selected the Red Snapper tacos, grilled apple and brie quesadilla, and duck empanadas. All three were utterly amazing. I would for sure bring my foodie husband here next time we're in town.Another tasty cocktail treat was the 1940s champagne julep: like a mint julep with a tasty champagne floater. Definitely recommend.This would be a great place to hit with a smallish group so you can try all the amazing things on the menu.",2,0,2,Nikki M.,"San Francisco, CA",705,1125,473

3.0,7/30/2009,"Stanton Social is what I always imagined NYC's semi-upscale bar scene to look like. Very dimly-lit, contemporarily styled, loud as hell, and filled with a melting pot of young professionals and Euro-trash foreigners.I went with a friend around 8pm on a Wednesday and it was a 45 minute wait (or so the hostess said). So instead of going to the main room, we decided to head upstairs to the bar/lounge area, which was much smaller but definitely had the same vibe. After getting a couple drinks at the bar (and over an hour later), we realize that the hostess still hasn't called us and after talking to her, it seemed like we had to wait another 30 minutes. What happened to the original 45 mins? I hate when restaurants do that.Anyways, so because we're impatient, we just ate at the bar, which still serves the full menu. We got the: (1) Kobe beef sliders, (2) French onion soup dumplings, (3) Flank steak and tater tots, (4) Chicken wings, and (5) French fries. The kobe beef sliders were awesome -- very flavorful and the meat tasted really fresh. I also loved the french onion soup dumplings -- very unique dish (I've never had anything like this before) where there's 6 holes on a plate and each hole holds a dumpling that's soaked in french onion soup. Only wish the cheese on top didn't dry up so fast. But otherwise, it was delicious.I wasn't too impressed with their flank steak and tater tots. I felt like the steak was a bit tougher than I expected and the tater tots had the texture of liver. The flavor wasn't that great either. The chicken wings were good, but nothing worth recommending. The fries were decent -- probably a little too overpriced for what it was though.So yeah, definitely the food was a hit or miss. Each dish is small, but I didn't find it to be as overpriced as everyone says (granted you stick with the good dishes). I mean I would definitely pay $7 for those kobe beef sliders.What I did like about this place, though, are the drinks. Very experienced, skilled bartenders who make awesome drinks. They're all really personable and professional, so I was really impressed with that. Initially, I would have expected them to be douchebags, but I'm glad to see they aren't.All in all, I have mixed feelings about Stanton Social. Great ambiance, nice NYC vibe, with awesome drinks and some phenomenal dishes. On the downside, however, there were definitely some misses with the dishes and the waiting game for a table is ridiculous. I would probably definitely come back, though, and just go straight up to the bar area, order some artistically-crafted drinks and scarf down on Kobe beef sliders.",3,1,2,Roy C.,"San Francisco, CA",483,448,46

4.0,7/19/2009,"I've only been here for brunch, but I almost always take out-of-town guests here for brunch--unless they're on a budget. We usually order less than 2 dishes/person (and not the 2-3 they recommend--like for 5 people, I would order 7 or 8, depending how much everyone can eat). This usually puts us around $22-25 person, after tax and tip, without drinks. It's also perfect since they take reservations, and I'm usually still able to get them just a day before (even same day if your party is small).With that said, the warm doughnuts with caramel sauce are to die for--they remind me of the fresh malasatas in Maui, but even better (mmm...caramel sauce...so perfect and non-sticky)! The breakfast bruschetta is good, the french onion soup dumplings are a classic (stay away if you're not a fan of cheese), the pancakes are tasty, and the chicken + waffles are exquisite.

Their brunch menu is extensive and covers a food speciality from practically every continent--from Warm Doughnuts with caramel sauce, Spicy Lamb Souvlakis with tzatziki sauce, lime, & harissa aioli, to yummy little Baby Benedicts with grilled canadian bacon & citrus kissed hollandaise, and to my favorite; the delicious and comforting, Social Mac & Cheese with chorizo & oven-dried tomatoes.",1,0,0,Bobbi P.,"New York, NY",172,12,0

5.0,7/9/2009,"In short: So very delicious but so very expensiveI spent a long time deciding whether or not to give this place four or five stars, but the place was just too delicious not to give it five despite being one of the most expensive places I've ended up eating in a long time. Stanton Social is a ""tapas style"" place where all the dishes are small and meant to be shared amongst the group. The waitress suggested we each pick a dish we liked, and the kitchen would size the order according to our large group (7 of us). Everything was AMAZING. Red Snapper tacos, five flavor ribs, the quesadillas, chicken and waffles (Yes! they have chicken and waffles), and more. All these dishes despite their mundane names were full of flavor and texture. On top of this, Stanton Social makes fantastic mixed drinks from the bar. The waitress told me that all their ingredients are blended in-house so they never used store bought syrups or anything like that. She wasn't playing around. The vodka based drinks I had were the smoothest and most clean tasting martini's I've ever had (Only downside is that most of these drinks have really girly names). The drinks are $13, but they were worth it. So yes, I will give Stanton Social five stars for the sheer quality of the experience even if it was achingly expensive. For this birthday dinner, I ended up paying almost a $100 (I was chipping in for the birthday girl so subtract 10-15).

Let me just start by what was most memorable. The quesadillas with brie, bacon and apples was delicious and so were the Kobe Sliders. The lobster rolls were pretty good but they reminded me of Nantucket...which felt kind of wrong considering I was in the Lower East Side and it was 30 degrees out. Anyway, the rest of the meal was delightful. For dessert we had the red velvet Twinkies and doughnuts, which were divine. I would also like to add the service was impeccable, which, as we know, is very important. I can't wait to go back, it truly was a great dining experience.

Interesting, not my style- Pink Grapefruit-Mint Martini (Stoli Ohranj, fresh squeezed pink grapefruit juice,  lemon simple syrup & fresh mint): very refreshing- Pineapple 75 Martini (Pineapple infused Grey Goose vodka, pineapple juice, lemon simple syrup, splash of Chambord): This was my first drink and I drank this sucker like there was no tomorrow. Made me feel like I was at a beach... My second drink was a Peach margarita that isn't on the online menu - I drank this muuuch slower as it was muuuch stronger. But still tasty!- Basil-Lime Gimlet (Belvedere vodka, muddled basil leaves, lemon syrup and fresh lime juice): SO tasty & refreshing! Like drinking fresh herbs- 1940s Champagne Julep (Brut Cava ""Gran Reserva"", fino sherry, lemon syrup, fresh mint & caramelized lime): Mmm.For food, we went for:- Essex Street Pickles from 'The Pickle Guy': We were on the Lower East Side, so we felt we had to. And we were glad we did!! These were everything a LES pickle should be!!- Warm Piquillo Pepper 'Bruschetta' stuffed with roasted garlic-goat cheese: the pepper and goat cheese went so well together and the bread was perfectly crisp, yet didn't cut the roof of your mouth!- Zucchini Tempura - tomato jam and asiago: Tastes exactly how you think it will. Probably my least favorite of the night (that I actually ate...)- Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies with caramelized onions & truffle creme fraiche: I saw this on the menu and immediately picked it. SOoooo good!- Sweet & Sour Chicken & Cashew Spring Rolls: again, tastes like what you think - which is yummy!! Nice and crispy and I loved the crunch of the nuts.- Red Snapper Tacos - creamy avocado & spicy mango: I don't eat fish, but I did taste this. It was my least favorite (because of the fish...), but was apparently quite good. Too fishy for me.- Spicy Lamb Souvlakis -tzatziki, lime & harissa aioli: HOLY YUM. These melted in my mouth. Little souvlakis from heaven.- Spring Pea & Ricotta Ravioli with fire roasted peppers,  garlic , crispy serrano, basil: I don't know what was crunchy in these, but it was GOOD. these were awesome.- 'Chicken n' Waffles' - brick pressed chicken, aged cheddar waffle, corn pudding & balsamic spiked maple syrup: My sister-in-law lives in Atlanta, so she had to try these. I took a bite and said ""I never understood chicken & waffles before, but now I do."" I didn't realize these were $18 - not sure it's worth that, but it is good!!- Braised Short Rib Soft Tacos - tomato, red onion & smoked paprika relish, 'refried' cranberry beans: I don't remember these now that I am writing this, but I vaguely remember it being good... We had eaten a lot at this point!!We also got a free ""appetizer"" from the chef - little Caesar Salads on some sort of crouton. They were awesome.The waiter was so helpful and understanding and we had a fabulous time!! The food is amazing and it's a great concept!! The drinks are rocking too. Definitely go!!",1,0,2,Jenn S.,"Needham Heights, MA",84,582,65

5.0,6/7/2009,"I would have never guessed such a classy, comfortable, and culinarily extraordinary restaurant and bar would be found here, amid the run-down, gritty, graffitied-up buildings of this neighborhood.  Nor would I have ever imagined that I'd rave over a joint that serves pan-ethnic tapas.  Yet here I am, reminiscing about the one meal that is quite solidly the most mouth-watering experience I've had in NYC... at Stanton Social.First off, make reservations.  Even on a weeknight.  It gets slammed in here, which we discovered.  Even on a Wednesday, we arrived nominally late and were permitted to be seated, but we were warned that we'd have to vacate by a specified time due to another party coming in.  No big, appreciate the warning and their flexibility to serve us anyway.  (Damn NY traffic in in the rain.)I could devote a few hundred words to the environment alone, but will simplify it down to a word: classy.  One could just as easily have an extremely nice business dinner here as one could a date to impress (and that other party better put out, too).Their drinks menu is varied and creative, utilizing ingredients from blood orange juice and jalapeño-infused tequila to green tea and marmalade.  I was a little overwhelmed by their specialty cocktails list, so I stuck to a personal favorite: an Old Fashioned.  Done up with some Jack, it was impeccably balanced, and oh-so-strong.  Needless to say, I followed it up with another.And the food, oh the food!  Just thinking about it makes me salivate.Things to definitely not miss are the sliders (is.gd/RVF5) - my favorite were the Kobe Philly ones with truffle and goat cheese fondue - and the French onion soup dumplings (is.gd/RVGD).  They're exactly what they sound like: French onion soup somehow cooked inside of a little dumpling wrapper, then covered with a layer of savory cheese, topped off with a cute little crouton.  And my personal fave was the steak and tots (is.gd/RW3V), which we ordered medium.  Meltingly tender meat over mildly rich and starchtastic tater tots (which seemed more like giant gnocchi to me).I'm convinced you can't go wrong here.  Other items we had included the duck confit empanadas, crabcake corndogs, charred chicken wings with a bleu cheese fondue, charred squid lettuce wraps, moo shu chicken, and of course chicken 'n' waffles.  With each dish that was brought out, we oohed and ahhed.Considering the quality and quantity of food for the prices they serve, it's quite a reasonable value.  There were posters up in the bathrooms about Monday night deals for 20% off - if those are accurate, it would be a crazy amazing steal, and I'd probably go there at least once a month.  My verdict is that Stanton Social is easily in my top three favorite restaurants of NYC.  Simply stellar, from start to finish.",15,7,17,Kevin L.,"New York, NY",1049,1344,4648
5.0,6/4/2009,"Three years, four months and two days later...Props to The Stanton Social for still rockin' the house with amazing food, on-point service and an electric, dinner-conducive, buzz-worthy atmosphere.After a lengthy hiatus, I returned to The Stanton Social to bring my boss and colleagues out for a nice dinner during a week of conferences in NYC. I hemmed and hawed and finally blurted out this amazing spot that I dines at ages ago for my birthday. It dawned on me in a mini-panic that the memory of my delight with this spot may be overshadowed and diminished with time. Such is not the case, and my opinion alone need not be the basis for this judgment.For witness, I give you my three dining companions, a native and current resident of London (specifically Camden), a Washington DC man about town, and young woman with a discerning palette who has spent equal time in San Francisco, Las Vegas, DC and is now a resident of NYC. Each of them, at every bite of every dish, marveled aloud at the taste and the presentation. They continually commented, through garbled musings of yum, between bites...we finished every smidge brought to us.When you have such a diverse group of people expressing an overwhelming amount of pleasure about the food at the restaurant you've chosen, it give you a certain amount of pride, satisfaction and general merriment at their joy of enjoyment.Thank you Stanton Social for your long-lasting consistency, and you're ability to deliver on some serious expectations after all this time!",10,3,10,Leighann F.,"New York, NY",3214,961,695

4.0,5/27/2009,"One of the first places I ate at after moving to New York from Cali, so Stanton Social has a very special place in my heart. I recently came back to bring my gfs visiting from Cali. That's how much I love it here. The food is very rich and a tad on the salty side--not for girls who like to munch on rabbit food and push food around their plates.  The foi gras PBJ is a must try--unique in flavor and delicious. The french onion soup dumplings were a hit at our table, though a little too artery-clogging for my likes. The kobe beef slider is another must try--and I'm not even a big meat eater. The oysters and the spicy tuna are delicious if you are a raw/ sea food lover. The chicken & waffles were recommended to us, but they sucked. Not worthwhile (this place isn't grimy enough to serve REAL chicken & waffles. Gotta go to LA for that). The drinks and atmosphere bring this place up another notch. The Social Tea is deceivingly delicious, and I was drunk by my 2nd one (disclaimer: lightweight). The people here are pretty but not snooty, and the aura is fun without trying too hard. I personally enjoyed coming here with a smaller group so everyone can try everything without having to order two of everything [small dishes, not so small prices].If you're the type who likes a big honkin piece of flank steak and a baked potato side the size of your foot, you may find Stanton Social unsatisfying.

It's a festive spot, so expect the noise level to be high; however, you can sit on the second or third level and it's not as loud. The food is wonderful. The Red Snapper tacos rock and are so tasty. The Kobe beef sliders are also good. I loved the French Onion Soup Dumplings. And the potato and goat cheese pirogi are yum. But perhaps the best was the lobster pizzette. Lordy, I just get happy thinking of it. All the chocolate desserts are great. The homemade peppermint patties have now ruined Yorks for me. The warm donuts with dipping sauces are unreal.

4.0,5/12/2009,"So I know, I'm so late to come try this place for the first time. But everything in life is about timing and it just happened that it took this long for me and Stanton Social to cross paths. We arrived early for our reservations, was asked to have a drink in the upstairs bar. No problem, the lounge was loungey and the bartender was attentive. It was a Tuesday night and the crowd was light which I was glad for since I was actually able to hear my date. We didn't have to wait long and was escorted to the first level where our table was waiting for us. It was a bit crowded where we sat but the place itself is just cozy. If you are the type that likes your conversations private, I suggest you ask specifically for a booth ahead of time, or else the party next to you will hear your arguments. The food is tapas style and the menu was a good size. The good thing about it is that there is absolutely something for everyone on that menu. The tried and true safe people, like myself and the more adventurous ones like my husband. We each found something we loved and something we both wouldn't touch again. Hits: the sea bass, french onion soup dumplings!!! WARM DONUTS!Miss: duck confit empanadas (didn't care much for this at all), baby back ribs (Avoid at all cost...too sweet!)The kobe sliders were a bit disappointing, but maybe I was expecting too much.

She was the cutest thing in short red hair that made us feel like we were the only ones in the room, despite the place being packed by Europeans and pre-clubbing hipsters. Excellent service- 5 stars.We ordered food and drink as secondary to keep us busy besides revelling at my awesome outfit, but I had no idea that it would steal the show. The food deserved 4 stars including presentation, the drinks 5. Everytime they brought out another family-style dish, there was an ""ooo"" or and ""aaahh"". Everytime they brought out a drink, there was a ""gimmee! gimeee!"" and a drool here and there.The scene upstairs was quite intimate and more laid back unlike the scene downstairs. Go to the bar if you want to sneak in a sloppy smooch session, or stay downstairs and do it if you are into that sort of thing.

Despite the poopy rainy weather, and the long cab ride getting there, it was still well worth it, LES is far from mid-town!We were seated immediately right after we arrived. We got this amazing circular booth in the front of the restaurant, right when you go in--and the seats face the rest of the place so we can see the entire stretch of the restaurant including the upstairs! Our waiter was very kind and asked if we had any questions and needed any help with the menu. We didn't need any help and we ordered the following for 2 ppl (and they are listed in the order of what i liked most to least):French onion soup dumplingsMiso glazed chilean Sea bass sataysRed Snapper Tacos--creamy avocado and mangoWarm Piquillo Pepper Bruschetta stuffed with roasted garlic-goat cheese Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies caramelized onions & truffle creme fraiche Wow the french onion soup dumplings are super unique and deeelicious! If you've ever had a chinese pork soup dumpling-- it's the same concept  but instead inside the dumpling is carmelized onions and french onion soup then it's like overlaid with yummmy hot crunchy cheese and seasonings. It looked like it was baked in one of those escargot molds. very very nice! :) The mizo glazed chilean sea bass was very nice!! The sea bass was fresh, a quality cut and just melted right in our mouths. Then the red snapper tacos were great, they accidentally brought us out 2 orders of it.. one right after the other, and we told them but they still gave it to us and didn't charge us.. the sauce was a little on the spicy side, but still very flavorful. Bruschetta was very unique. The stuffed peppers on top with fraiche cheese was very rich in flavor and yummy. It's not something you could each very much of but still tasty.Which brings me to the potato and goat cheese, very very rich, maybe by then we were stuffed already so wasn't my favorite. But how could i expect potato and cheese combo not to be rich right? Still very delic, it was liked fancy mashed potatoes in an empananda! The portions are small, but still very very filling!!! We still wanted something sweet at the end so we went with the donuts!! HAHA After the hot crispy donuts arrived with the choco/caramel/strawbery dipping sauce, we wanted a little bit of icecream on the side. We ordered chocolate, they brought us strawberry, we told them we wanted choco, they told us to eat the strawberry first, they brought out the choco and we were stuffed!! They didn't charge us for the strawberry OR choco...The staff was extremely nice and quick to clear our plates, informative and efficient providing an overall excellent experience!

4.0,4/19/2009,"I love places that offer little dishes and the chance to order, like, ten things off the menu if you so choose. Makes me feel luxuriant.The dishes have around enough food for 2 or 3 people to have a couple mouthfuls - that's why you gotta order many plates. I hearted the Apple & Brie Ques, the chicken/cashew spring rolls and the edamame. The duck empanadas were ok, not great and not very ducky. The squid dish, honestly, was ordered because we were all ""Ooo let's be dangerous"" and I ate a squid and that was it. If you are a fan of the squid as food, you can try your own luck and ignore me. The chicken wings were oddly fatty and chewy and not like chicken wings at all. The sauce was nice, though. The drinks were ok, they were tasty but not very strong. Dessert was a more normal offering - scoops of ice cream and sorbet, dessert wines, etc. Delicious, but nothing to write home about. I also heard of these large groups of ladies coming to eat, and at first, found myself completely surrounded by...groups of dudes. The ladies came later though. Oh, so many groups of women! And the bathroom is surprisingly large for such a well packed restaurant. It's hidden away in the back though, near the wine glass storage. Weird, but it was clean. Overall, good food but it's a little overpriced. So says my frugal little heart. Ok, not so frugal if I'm going here, but you get me.

4.0,4/7/2009,"I love tapas and I heart Stanton Social.They have a main dining room at ground level and a trendy bar / lounge upstairs.  You are in the midst of hipsters and fashionistas who probably have not eaten more than an almond in months so they can splurge their caloric intake here.  Unfortunately, I cannot say that I have eaten only 1 almond - make it more like 1 million almonds - Mama's gotta eat.The tapas are priced at around $7 a plate and honestly, not nearly enough to ""share"" between more than 2 people if that other person is lucky - which unfortunately, my ""neighbor"" was not.  That's kind of how they get you and why I take one star away!  Drinks are pricey at $13 a pop and not nearly enough alcohol for the price tag.  Luckily, I came here on the company's dime, so I got to PIG OUT.AWESOME:French Onion Soup Dumplings - stinky and dee-liciousKobe beef sliders - miniburgers that melt in your mouthGrilled cheese sliders - jalapeno bacon with fried green tomato..

Better than clinton st's pancake. more moist and syrup wasn't overly sweet.Kobe Beef Burger- so cute! we had the mini one. patty was cooked perfectly, although i prefer my bread slightly heated and crispy.Baby Benedict- well-cooked eggs, soft bread probably left a little too long before being served?Grilled Pizzetta- not bad. thin and crispy.It would have been nice to have the sweets served after the savory because it was so good we completely cleaned everything out(or maybe we're just that hungry) and left little room for the rest. portion was mini yet filling!didn't bother our server too much but she was very nice and constantly check back to make sure everything was good. love the decor. young and hip crowd. would definitely come again for brunch to try the other you-look-so-good food.",2,0,2,Yeni H.,"Port Washington, NY",55,226,14

No worries, I know that has little to do with my personality and more with charming her way into a good tip."" ""Bringing Meatpacking to the LES"", Stanton Social knows its market well. Too well, in fact: The pre-dominantly twenty-something, manifest hip n well-heeled, commitment phobic crowd. Stanton Social delivers exceptionally well on that. Starting from the name: ""Social"" - crowded before 9 pm with ""girlfriends"", the girl:guy ratio in the dining hall is probably 7:3. The format, Tapas, also encourages conversation and socialization over dainty morsels of food as opposed to gastronomic indulgence. And, the eclectic menu spares the dining patrons from committing to a particular cuisine. Why opt for nearby Italian ('Inoteca) when you can choose sassy fusion offerings from diverse cuisines spanning Vietnamese, Japanese, Mexican, European, to the Plain Jane Mac & Cheese (gussied up with Chorizo)?""You MUST try the French Onion Soup dumplings, they are the best I've ever had"", said our friendly neighbor. He was having dinner on the upper level of the restaurant, while throwing a birthday party for his daughter and her friends (celebrating in a separate room). Inspired no doubt from the likes of Mayor Bloomberg, and such others.I smiled back politely at him, while leaning across the table to whisper to my companion, ""See, I am not the only one who's a legend in his own mind"". The cynic in me had already decided that the man had read reports about diners ""sharing plates with each other"", and ""making lifelong friends"", as a result of being forced by the seating arrangement to invade each other's personal space. Dammit, I am the exact opposite of what this place aspires for - the anti (Stanton) social :) I don't suffer pretense gladly. That said, I can appreciate that their format works for me, IF I am in the LES. The Kobe beef sliders are the perfect size, given their richness and greasiness. {The word ""Sliders"" is also re-assuring for the B&T crowd that they aren't too far from home (White Castle)}. The potato and goat cheese pierogies, lamb souvlaki, spring rolls, red snapper tacos, frites - were all excellent! The Tapas were served two at a time, and the kitchen operates efficiently to make sure that you're ready to be social at the earliest (highlighting the inherent tension between their desire to churn tables and the invitation for people to socialize over cocktails and bites). I did say earlier that SS knows it market well, and the loud music encourages alcohol consumption (scientific research), borrowing a page from Murray Hill bars.The annoying neighbor was having his own Meg Ryan moment (from When Harry Met Sally) over the doughnut holes, but as we know better, we chose to skip the dessert at SS and instead went to SSS (Sugar Sweet Sunshine) nearby. The night was young, and what better way to fuel ourselves than with some Banana pudding, and peanut butter icebox pie at S3B. The contrast in warmth and contentedness was like night and day. We all have our ""Happy Place"", and S3B is mine. As much as Stanton Social may be for its boisterous fans.",16,20,17,Atif I.,"New York, NY",177,642,1772

The book should also state how crowded this place gets on a Friday night! All the pictures were so beautiful but I couldn't see the walls past people's elbows. When the waitress came to take our order, we have a habit of relinquishing all decision-making powers and let them choose for us. Afterall, we've been making decisions on the job all day. Out of all the surprise dishes that she picked, the two most unique ones were the beef kobe sliders and the butternut ravioli. If these were the only two things we'd eaten, we'd be satisfied. All the other dishes tasted the same or had similar texture and fixings. The restaurant finally cleared out and we could actually hear each other. This could be a fun spot for groups but not if you want to catch up with a long distance friend you haven't seen in a year or two.culinary Explorere's Guide to a Good Server:1. When asked for wine recommendations, they will send over the sommelier or wine manager - instead of choosing the cheapest bottle or saying ""I'm not a drinker.""2. They will ask first if there are any dietary restrictions, preferences or allergies. I'm allergic to shrimp and yet servers will recommend the shrimp special.3. They will pick out a smart combination of light appetizers leading up to heavier entrees, and not just the most expensive ones. 4.

I, however, am from hardy Midwest stock so I know how to pack it in, male companions present or not...Anyway. I coordinated a bachelorette party dinner here and I was fully impressed with the coordination and the offerings. They offer a prix fixe menu that has all of the big hitters and crowd favorites, so it was pretty easy to pick the items I wanted to serve. Don't be fooled - although this is a tapas/small plates restaurant, the portions are sizable and if you get enough items like we did, you *will* be positively stuffed for a very, very reasonable price.Favorites:-butternut squash and sweet potato ravioli; the brown butter is aaaammmaazing-red snapper tacos-kobe burgers; yeah, I don't even eat red meat but once again I relaxed the rule for the night - it was my first time eating kobe, can you believe it?-frites; crispy-crispy, bad for ya but so good...-donuts. YUM.-cocktails were all good. We all got different drinks and were pleased.Misses:-the french onion dumplings, sadly, were a disappointment. I was told to be cautious and expect a squirt of hot onion broth with the first bite, but the dish had cooled by the time we got it, so the food was lukewarm. And the cheese was congealed. The flavor was good, but the presentation was a bummer-spinach salad; I wish that I'd requested a substitution for this on the prix fixe menu, because it was just a downer after the other glorious food.I really recommend this place for large parties, because they have service down cold and I observed no lapses.

The creamy avocado dip was amazing.Sweet & Sour Chicken $ Cashew Spring Rolls - i pretty much always like spring rolls, but these were particularly good. Delicately fried and not too greasy. Wild Mushroom Risotto Cakes - Not a huge fan. The risotta was fine, but they had some sort of garnish/sauce on top that I found bitter.

Each item is $15 or so, so 8 items would have been $30 + tax + tip + drinks for each of us, which was definitely more than we were intending and probably more than we needed. So we ordered five items. The mini courses come two or three at a time. Each has a very, very small sample of good dishes. So, for example, we got the ""Sweet Potato and Squash Ravioli"". The waiter (not too friendly) said that only three pieces come with the order, so we could add a fourth, and we obliged. Each piece was $4.25, so the four pieces all together were $16.75. The raviolis were quite small--just your average size. So, we each ate one small ravioli for $4.25, it was delicious, and that was that. Additionally, the four of us didn't have the most in-sync tastes, so it was hard to decide what to get.In short, the food is good, but the price and serving sizes are ridiculous.

I thought the french onion soup dumplings were overrated. The idea is fun, but that's about it.

The modern art-deco design of the restaurant is impressive and unique.  I love the 1930s architectural lines, brass fixtures and lighting. The tapas style food is good and cute; comfort food options in smaller bites, like chicken and waffles & goat cheese pierogies, plus some more original dishes.  BUT, the food was not completely memorable and for the prices you pay, I expected more kick in each bite.  For food and drinks, they get 1.5 stars.  The Stanton Social was a good time, but not one of the best.  I'd recommend checking it out once.  Just be warned that while you'll get to enjoy one of the best designed restaurants in the City, you'll pay $70 a head and probably still be hungry at the end of the night.",1,0,0,Susan N.,"New York, NY",307,40,0

We also had the donut dessert with 3 dipping sauces...a MUST!  Great first experience.Here's the catch and the reason I couldn't give it 5 stars...We returned the following night around midnight to grab a quick snack (our favorite sliders) before heading back out. They advertise that they stay open until 2am during the week so we thought we had plenty of time. Our waitress defiinitely seemed annoyed that we wanted to order food.

4.0,2/17/2009,"Went here for a friend's birthday.  We had a large group of 12 and were seated promptly on the second level.Because of our group size, we had a special menu with different tapas dishes available.  The food and service was good but it wasn't anything special. My only complaint:  when seated on the second floor, the last 2 people at the end our table were sitting directly under the staircase.  The bottom of the steps are NOT covered by anything so not only are the people that use the stairs completely exposed but dust/other particles from their shoes are prone to falling down onto our table and food!  Obviously this may not be visible, but I think management at an establishment such as this should be aware of this big no-no.  It's way worse than being seated right next to the bathroom!",1,0,0,Overeater S.,"Palisades Park, NJ",15,40,1

Of which, the kobe burgers were good, the red snapper fish tacos were stellar, and the goat cheese bruschetta-like thingies were enjoyable.Overall, I had a great time here.

4.0,2/13/2009,"Very fond of this place. I even liked it after we went to this place in a snowstorm after a long long long day of work. I usually don't like many things, places, people after a day like this. First off the place was cute and dimly lit. I cannot comment on the lounge which I did not get a chance to see but the dining room was cute. Very charming and warm. We were a group of 6 so we were seated at a table near the kitchen. We ordered 2 bottles of champagne and A LOT of food. Here is what I remember we ordered and the review;Wok Charred Edamame- very surprised they weren't shelled but the taste was very niceWarm Piquillo Pepper Crostini stuffed with goat cheese- very nice taste, the peppers and cheese complimented each other very well.Zucchini Tempura- the worst of all the orders and the only one that had leftovers.Potato and Goat Cheese Perogies- AMAZING. Could have eaten this all night.French Onion Soup Dumplings- well recievedYellowfin Tuna Sashimi- nice but ordinarySweet and Sour Chicken Cashew Rolls- great reviewsRed Snapper Tacos- unbelievable. Another dish I would have ordered more than one.Chipotle Shrimp- reasonably good.Crabcake Corndogs- yummy and totally unexpectedHangar Steak and Tots- these were raved about by the meat eaters.Chicken and Waffles- also a rave reviewWasabi Pea Salmon- pretty decentGrilled Pizette with Mozzarella and oven dried tomato- also amazing.My own personal top picks are: Pierogies, pizette, red snapper tacos, crostiniIn addition these were added: chicken and waffles, crabcake corndogs, cashew chicken spring rolls and hangar steak and tots as the resounding favorites.  For dessert we ordered the Twinkie trio. Red velvet, peanut butter chocolate and classic vanilla. We enjoyed. We also ended up spending a fortune with 2 bottles of champagne and some of the dishes we doubled up on since they're smaller. That's where they really get you on the bill so BE CAREFUL. Also they kept on bringing the food out in spurts so when you'd think you were done a whole new course came out. So pace yourself and try to only order 2 a person instead of 3 dishes. Loses a star for noise level. If you go here with more than 4 people, your conversation will be lost and you won't be able to talk to anyone but your adjacent neighbor. Will defininitely be back here.

4.0,2/13/2009,"Having an 8 hour layover at JFK while en route to Paris, I opted to have dinner with friends in the city instead of trying to find something to do at the airport.My friend decided that 7 of us would have dinner at Stanton Social - so after a happy hour, we gathered here to eat.Stanton Social is a funky place.  It has such a good feel to the place, and while it is crowded, loud, and hip - - I noticed immediately that this was the type of place that would become a group of friends' ""regular hangout"" if I lived in NYC.There are no real ""entrees"" here.  The concept is new American cuisine, tapas-style, meant to be shared by everyone at the table.  On this evening, we ordered a real ""tasting menu"" of items - - ordering just enough of any one dish to give all 7 of us a good taste of the food before moving on to the next item.  It was a true mish-mash of food from all parts of the world with their own twist on it.Some of the things we had were as follows:- Rabbit Meat Occheriette pasta (spelling?)- Lamb Souvlaki- Kobe Beef Sliders- French Onion Dumplings- Duck Confit Empanadas- Short Ribs- Moo Shu Chicken- Dozen Oysters from east and west coast- Meatballs- Flank Steak... amongst others.Some, like the sliders, were served 1 to an order - and at $7 per order, we opted to order 4 and cut each in half.  It was enough, and while taste was good, it didn't blow me away.  It's just not right to put any BBQ sauce on Kobe Beef.  Others that I found to be ""OK"" were the empanadas, and steak - - nothing special, just good food, and it's one of those things you're glad you're sharing so that this is not your main entree for the evening.  I did not like the short ribs at all - - it was entirely too sweet, though they were cooked well.The Rabbit Meat pasta was extraordinary.  I could do 3 plates of this on my own, no joke.  It had a real spicy kick to it, and pasta was cooked perfectly.  Our server told us it was a new item to the menu.  Meatballs were also exemplary - - soft and seasoned perfectly, drenched in some tomato sauce concoction.  With two excellent bottles of wine from Spain - - we finished our meal and moved onto dessert.Stanton Social serves up some great dessert.We had a lot of ice cream, but the one dessert that nearly had us moaning was the Guinness and Bailey's Ice Cream dessert.  Holy cow!!!!!!!!!!!Ambiance was really cool, and the servers were nice.  All in all, it was a great dinner.  The cost was pretty decent, at $62 per person, for a dinner for 7 people.  This place is DEFINITELY worth checking out when in NYC.  I would definitely recommend this place for group gatherings of up to 8 people, and girls' night out, or other social events.  Music is hip and it just FEELS like the beginning of a big night for friends.  I would not, however, recommend it for business dinners (too loud) or the first 3 dates or so (no privacy, not really meant for quiet chatting).I had so much fun, I can honestly say this was  the best layover, EVER!",9,6,7,Grace K.,"Las Vegas, NV",1417,579,550

5.0,2/9/2009,"Upon first glance I thought this place seemed like a typical Manhattan place...overpriced, so-so food, pretentious crowd. Let's just say I couldn't have been more wrong.Met some friends here for dinner on a Friday night around 9. It was full, but didn't feel overly packed. Everyone was really nice (hostess, coat check lady, a bartender and our waitress) and suprisingly friendly and made our experience really fun. The atmosphere was great - mood lighting, big wooden tables, overly large chairs. More formal downstairs, more loungish upstairs.I would definitely recommend starting with a fun cocktail - they weren't too expensive and all the ones we sampled were delicious and unique. The tapas menu was extensive - for 4 of us we split 10 choices. We were satisfied by course 8, definitely full by 10. I would recommend listening to the waitress when they recommend how many entrees to pick for the number of people you have!  The service was quick but not rushed, and they only give you one plate at a time so you never really just sit there waiting. The busboys were great at giving fresh plates & making sure your table was clear too which was a plus.Personally, I loved the menu selections - everything is a twist on a classic. Some of my favorite twists were (with amazing ingredients): Wings, PBJ, french onion soup, grilled cheese, fish and chips, etc all made with really high end ingredients (a ""quesadilla"" with goat cheese, apples, truffle oil, etc).  I felt like I was on Top Chef sampling their creations. I was very impressed. Definitely go with a group so you can get the true experience. Can't wait to go back!

5.0,2/7/2009,"I took the gf here last night for her birthday. It's hard to find something to complain about. The ambiance was great -- insider-y without being obnoxious, perfect music (a sexy lounge track blurs into MJ's ""P.Y.T.""), dimly lit with high ceilings. I had the oysters (the gf is veg), and we shared the risotto cakes, wok-seared edamame, roasted beets, and mac 'n' cheese. Everything was good, but the mac 'n' cheese was the real standout. There were lots of other items that looked worth trying but I had to keep in mind the culinary life choices of my dining partner.From coatcheck girl to waitress to runners, the service was incredibly friendly and professional.The one knock (and it's a minor one) is that the cocktails weren't really inventive enough to warrant the $13 price tag. I had the blood-orange margarita with jalapeno-infused tequila.

Everything from the food, the ambience and our service was wonderful. As highlighted by many of the other members, the potato and goat cheese perogis, french onion soup dumplings and red snapper tacos are not to be missed. The only fault I have with the place is that our orders were messed up several times and we were often given plates that we hadn't requested. The waiter explained that there was some issue with their computer system and that the charges would be removed from the bill, and they were.

3.0,1/16/2009,"My wife picked out this restaurant online and I had no idea what to expect. During a stroll through the bohemian neighborhood during the day, it looked like the nicest restaurant in the area. We were escorted to the bar upstairs that was packed with trendy patrons and there were no seats available. When we got our seats in the restaurant it was very close quarters as most places in New York. But the thing that was most noticeable, was the large speakers with music so loud, it made it nearly impossible to hear your date; and impossible to not overhear your close neighbors, shouting to communicate. The food on the whole was good. The onion soup dumplings were a highlight. The tapas style menu looked inexpensive, but don't be fooled. We saw a tray of 4 sliders go by and ordered them, thinking they came in a group of 4 for $7.00, only to find out they were &7.00 each.

The pancakes were fabulous, but the lobster was a little tough.  The Kobe Philly and the Grilled Cheese with jalapenos were both really fantastic, although I do kinda regret not getting the Kobe Beef slider this time, as it is also really really good.The french onion soup dumplings....one of her favorites, don't really do it for me, but you know.We also had two bloody Marys each, which are really good, and they have a full cocktails menu available for brunch if you so choose.The food and the service were both top notch, but when the bill came, I had to think, I've had equivalent brunches elsewhere....and for less than $100, but let's not kid ourselves.

4.0,1/10/2009,"I have been exploring neighborhoods since I arrived here a few years ago for food oriented restaurants and bars. Walking by this well built place and having seen reviews for it on Yelp, my mind made the decision (with body to follow) to go in. At first, I walked into the main restaurant. I looked around and found ""no bar"". I thought this was odd and perhaps I was not in the right ""Stanton Social"". Quickly, I asked the coat woman ""do you have a bar""? She smiled (as if she had been asked this by many first timers) and pointed upstairs. Going back out and up, I found a well built gathering place, filled on this Friday night, with a centerpiece bar and seating at both ends of the room. Wine humidor in the back, showed a well stocked cellar and I ""chinned up"" for my first taste. The bartender greeted me and made the usual offerings, ""what can I get you""? I, feeling comfortable, asked for a beer and menu. People on both sides of me were relaxed and either had food or empty plates in front of them (this is a good sign from my point of view). I ordered Piquillo Pepper Bruschetta, Chicken Caesar Bites and Red Snapper Tacos. Food came out quickly but it was ""oh so good"" (stole that expression from a TV celebrity chef)! For those who have read my reviews might realize I do not delve into long food descriptions; the menu should do this for you leaving out any mystery. My reviews are not about teaching a ""Master Chef Class"" on what is that criterion. No, I want it simple. I want people to get out and try the food, drink and social scene. Most restaurants have a hard working chef with hard working staff who may only get your respect for that moment. This place is solid. Food looked and tasted great. Bartender was slammed (come on it was Friday night) and he was courteous and attentive. My kind of place and it should be yours at least once. A good value for your dollar, The Stanton Social delivers. The restaurant is in a very cool part of Manhattan and if you have not been in this neighborhood before then make this place the motivation to get here.

I realize the place is already popular, but now I imagine that more out-of-towners who watch The City will be competing with the locals to snag a table here.Anyhoo...I've only been here once for brunch and it was fantastic. It wasn't too difficult to get a table through OpenTable (booked it a week in advance), but there were only 2 of us and I imagine bigger groups might have a more difficult time. We had the huevos rancheros, vanilla bean pancakes and the lobster eggs benedict. It was all absolutely delicious. And because brunch is not complete without a little daytime drinkin', we also had a couple of cocktails. They have a really creative, unique cocktail menu (I had a vanilla, fig and pear martini and my friend had a bloody mary with rosemary-infused vodka).

Also the single stall room is unisex, and sorry boys, but you usually leave the unisex toilets messy.With that said, I hope I didnt spoil the review for the food... the French Onion Soup dumplings are a must order!  Very cheesy, very rich, but really good.  The butternut squash ravioli was also at the top of my favorite list. The wasabi pea crusted salmon served on top of cold noodles was flavorful and of course had that wasabi kick to it =p The spring rolls were, good, but I feel like you can get spring rolls anywhere.  The kobe burger was tiny! and it had ketchup inside...I was expecting something more, so I would go without the burger.  The grilled cheese, which is also tiny was very good.  Nicely toasted bread with cheese, some veggie thing, and bacon, a nice combination of flavors.  I was really full after the third dish, but I kept eating because I am a foodie and I wanted to try a lot of stuff...and of course there is always room for dessert.  The warm doughnuts are delightful!  Served with three dipping sauces, the berry looking one is strange, but the caramel sauce is wonderful.I would definitely recommend this restaurant to someone looking for a nice dining experience or date place.  The fact that the dishes are small allow you to decide how much you want to eat, and it lends to a more communal dining event when you share your food.  This is a great place, no wonder it has so many reviews...and apparently Beyonce had a birthday here.",2,0,2,Laura J.,"San Diego, CA",161,188,83

It wasn't bad by any stretch but the only thing that really popped were the donuts for dessert. The Tacos were OK. The Crabmeat Corn Dogs were a little bland and the sauce a bit funky. The Kobe Beef Sliders, which I had heard great things about, were just OK. I've had better burgers at the Corner Bistro and myriad places in the Slope.The braised short ribs were the biggest standout. They were definitely good but again, not ""GREAT"".The service was OK at first then slowed down to a crawl but it was a busy Sat night so it's understandable. Mostly though, this place is a big scene and i should know; I've worked in my share of sceney places before. They serve their place and I'm cool with that.

3.0,10/12/2008,"If someone were to ask me what kind of food this place is I would say  ""think tapas minus the whole spanish vibe.""  Basically the whole theme of the restaurant when it comes to food is small plates.  The menu isn't divided up traditionally into apps or entrees.  Rather you order a bunch of stuff and it comes out as it is ready.The overall layout is pretty cool too.  Downstairs in reservations while the upstairs is first come first serve and more of a lounge scene.  Don't be alarmed though as you can order the same drinks and food in both areas.Sat down and were promptly greeted by our waitress Mallory.  Her enthusiasm was amazing.  I've worked in restaurants before and I know how hard it is to stay excited sometimes and that was never an issue.  She listened carefully and had a few suggestions for cocktails and food that she was able to articulate well. We ended up getting sweet and sour chicken and cashew spring rolls which I wasn't wild about.  Felt like a standard thai spring roll, not really sure where the whole sweet/sour aspect came in.Had the braised short rib soft tacos which were really good.  This is the one thing that I felt really stood out from the rest of the stuff we ordered.  While nothing was bad, I didn't think the food ""popped.""  The flavors weren't anything that wowed me except for the tacos.I didn't have a cocktail but my three friends all seemed to enjoy theirs.  The waitress was real cool/nice about substituting makers mark for jack daniels in one of the cocktails which is always a nice thing(no idea what if any up-charge there was).I was trying to gauge my overall feeling of the restaurant after I left and how many stars it deserved. It's kinda a tough one and its times like these when I wish half stars existed.  The scenery/layout/vibe of the place is five stars, the food was three, the service 4 and half(little bit of down time between dishes). The price was probably two and a half stars.The price was unfortunately the big killer for me.  It just seemed like a lot of stuff was just a couple dollars more then they should have been.  For the flavor profiles that we got, I just wasn't that amped on what it costs.  My friends had two drinks each, and we each ordered about two items off the menu.  Total our bill was $192 without tip.  Granted 78 dollars of that was alcohol and 14 was tax, but it all just seemed a little much to me.Honestly, it seems like a sweet date spot and I'll probably end up coming back because of that, but I won't be returning for the food.",3,1,3,William B.,"Somerville, MA",44,148,19
4.0,10/8/2008,"I really enjoy going to Stanton Social, whether for its thirst-quenching drinks or delectable sliders/tapas, or both!The first time I went to Stanton Social was for an impromptu date that came out of the blue. She recommended we trek to the Lower East Side, so after finding the place, we made our way to the upstairs lounge where the crowd was social and lively! The atmosphere was very swanky, along with its patrons. We ended up sharing a couch with another couple. Interesting story about them; the guy must have been 45 years old but 25 at heart, while his date, aka his ""arm candy"", had to be 25 or younger. At first we were a bit shy in socializing with them but after a few drinks, the 4 of us were laughing it up together! We started buying eachother rounds and my date got so drunk, at one point she asked him ""so are you her dad or something?"" lol, but he laughed and said that would be incestuous if he was lol. I had to buy them another drink just to maintain our drunk diplomacy and it was a good evening for all.Anyway, getting back to this review about Stanton Social (sorry I have a tendency to digress), the upstairs lounge is pretty hip, yet can be a bit claustrophobic once it starts filling up in the later hours. Make sure you claim a couch as soon as you can! The cocktails on the menu were delicious and creative, certainly able to get you on a good buzz. Defintely try the following:Black MagicPear-Ginger Sake MartiniChampagne JulepBasil-Lime GimletThe second time I went to Stanton Social, me and my usual group of friends were able to get reservations for dinner and were seated in the dining area downstairs. The crowd was especially beautiful, while the atmosphere was effortlessly hip and sleek. The dim-lighting was just right, and each time we came, we were able to get their booth seating which was great because the booth setup provided us a good level of intimacy and privacy while still allowing us to watch the crowd. The food menu is just as good and worth going back for. My group and I have gone to Stanton Social a few more times and this is what we usually order and share amongst the group, brought to us in a specific order:Potato & Goat Cheese PierogiesGrilled Pizzeta with the chicken-apple sausageKobe Beef BurgerMeatballsLobster RollBeef WellingtonThe service was attentive, really had no complaints about it. We usually ask for them to bring us our plates in a specific order and pace, and they have always obliged with no problems. If there were any complaints about Stanton Social, is that sometimes the upstairs can get very crowded and there's a wait list to go at times. Also, to no fault of Stanton Social, my group and I sometimes go overboard on the amount of drinks and food we order and can get preeeeetty pricey lol.If you go to Stanton Social for the first time, you shouldn't be disappointed! Just make sure to bring your 'A' game, a nice set of clothes, and your credit card hehe.N.B. - Usually the downstairs dining area is saved for parties with reservations, but if you happen to be in the area around 12am or 1am, you have a good chance of getting a seat downstairs for some late night dining.",3,0,0,Gary R.,"New York, NY",34,38,2

Not all that exciting, but it had a decent kick of flavor.* Kobe beef sliders -- A totally mini burger,  but oh so juicy!* Grilled apple and brie quesadillas -- Mmmm...with the generous topping of bacon, dee-lish-cious!!* Empanadas* Maine crabcake ""corn dogs"" -- Not too shabby, like a upscale version of a county fair staple.* French onion soup dumplings -- Never have seen this before on a menu.  Totally inventive and totally cheesy!* Moo shu shrimp -- A fun variation on the theme, and the sauce had a great spicy zing to it.* Braised short ribs soft tacos -- Wow!  So tender and flavorful...they were a meal unto their own.* Mac n cheese (chorizo and overdried tomatoes) -- With the chorizo, the flavor was uniquely zesty.  For how much food we ordered and for it being such a scene, it was actually a pretty reasonably priced meal in NY.",2,0,2,Evelyn K.,"San Francisco, CA",133,164,2
4.0,9/8/2008,"so in general i'm a huge fan of tapas, cause whats better than sharing food with friends. this is a typical tapas style eating experience but with very atypical tapas. the menu is influenced by japanese, american, italian and french cuisines so its fairly eclectic.from the get go we asked what the most popular dishes were and were greeted w/ the potato & goat cheese pierogies and fresh onion soup dumplings. the pierogies were delicious... deep fried fluffy balls of happiness and a great way to wet the palate. the second recommended dish was the french onion soup dumplings which I will pass on if i come back. the soup dumplings really had no soup and being the huge xiaolongbao fan that i am, this is unacceptable.we then chose the rest of our selections consisting of the baby back ribs, apple & brie quesadilla and risotto cakes.  the standout from this bunch for me was the quesadilla. the brie gave an unexpected bluish flavor that i thought went great with the apple flavors. the atmosphere is very chic LES so no qualms there. in general, expect standard fair with interesting additions. would definitely recommend",1,0,0,Philip M.,"New York, NY",235,17,0
5.0,9/7/2008,"Do you believe in love at first sight?  I didn't.  That was, I didn't until today.  I met my girlfriends for brunch this afternoon, and the place we originally picked for brunch was totally booked up.  We therefore decided to wander aimlessly until we found the perfect place that struck our mood.  Then we found it.  Love at first sight. I didn't even notice that there was a restaurant standing right there in front of my eyes.  The ones you fall in love with are usually the ones hardest to see.   So in we went.  We had a slight wait so went up to the bar for some pre-brunch alcohol...bloody mary's of course.  While at the bar, we had the wonderfully good fortune of meeting the gorgeous and oh so helpful manager, Michelle.  She helped us with selections from the menu, and she was just wonderful to chat with!Upon being seated downstairs, we selected a few of the items suggested by the beautiful Michelle.  We chose the buttermilk pancakes with banana, the salmon benedict, the french onion dumplings, and the huevos rancheros tacos.  The pancakes were....orgasmic.  The taste lingered.  The banana flavoring dominated and I could not wait to take another slow bite.  It was the sex of food.  And this was only the first course that was brought out.  The salmon benedict was delightful, though did not present the amazing showstopping flavor as the pancakes.  Next came the tacos.  Average at best.  We requested salsa so that we could put it on the tacos.  Once that was added, holy mother of god, pure deliciousness.  Finally came the dumplings.  Just imagine what french onion soup tastes like...now put it in a solid form. Overall, this is one of the most delicious restaurants I've been to in the city.  The portions are small and to be shared with the table, therefore several dishes are to be ordered.  The staff is fabulous, and have no complaints with anyone.   The atmosphere allows you to converse with your party and the portions also allow you to savor each bite.  I will definitely be back with my friends for dinner.  Love at first sight, and every bite confirmed my feelings.  Oh how I adore you Stanton Social!",3,1,3,Sarah B.,"Brooklyn, NY",368,298,38
5.0,9/3/2008,"When (if) I grow up, I want to be the Stanton Social.  It is the perfect union of uptown glam with downtown hip.We tried to get a table on a Saturday night. ""5PM or 11PM?"" were the offers. Or we were offered a chance to compete in the free for all at the lounge upstairs, first come first serve. We decided to take a gamble with this latter option and showed up around 9PM.  The place was full, but not packed, and we had ample room at the bar to engage in conversation (it wasnt too loud to prohibit this) and await our table. And await we did.  My wisest advice would be, if arriving w/o a reservation, do not come hungry.  You will eat your hand while awaiting.  Still, the host was friendly about updating us; and cheerful through my many update requests.So that part sucked, but what was great was the literal revolving door of beautiful women that walked in through the lounge door.  It's almost as though we were sitting on some model baggage claim at the Ford Modeling Agency, as group after group after group of stunners came through the door and made themselves comfortable.The patrons were very friendly as well, and we met a few groups of people from New York, from London, from LA, from Brooklyn, and so it went.Well, eventually despite the fun we were having, food could wait no longer. By this point it was 10.30 and we weren't believing the hostess anymore that ""you are next""So we went back downstairs to the main dining room and got seated instantly. Go figure.And fellas..again I would say the ratio was probably 1 guy for every 15 women. Insane.The food was delicious...french onion soup pot stickers, empanadas, something else I cannot remember...but it was all delicious and not too expensive.  The crowd was friendly downstairs too and we struck up a friendly conversation with the table next to us, something I have never done in a restaurant.That's all; Im going back next Saturday.",3,0,2,Marco S.,"Manhattan, NY",129,283,2
3.0,9/3/2008,"We didn't have a reservation for The Stanton Social on a busy Friday night, but the hostess from the restaurant on the first floor was very helpful and told us that we could go upstairs to the bar/lounge area where they have a full menu.  My brother, Chris, and I headed upstairs to wait for a table (it only took about 20 minutes) and got ready to chow down.  We sat down with another couple (were we supposed to share the tiny table?) and squished each other while trying to look at the menu.  Luckily, the other couple left before we got our food/drink orders because it was definitely a tight squeeze.We ordered a ton of food (everything sounded good and the portions are relatively small and made for sharing) including the mac and cheese, baby back ribs, lobster roll, beef carpaccio, and a foie gras dish.  None of the food was really that great, but if I had to choose a favorite from our meal, it would be the beef carpaccio (simply because I love beef carpaccio and arugula).  The worst dish was definitely the baby back ribs; they were drenched in a sauce that reminded me of a pork cha-siu bun (a really bad pork cha-siu bun).  Since we ordered so much food (and the tables were so small) we were forced to eat with our plates on our laps....which is NOT something I enjoy doing.  I'd return to the Stanton Social for drinks (definitely not specifically for dinner) - the lounge area has a bunch of nice couches, the tables are the perfect size for resting a 4 or 5 drinks (but definitely too small for plates/food), and the atmosphere is perfect for a fun night out on the LES.",3,0,1,Grace Y.,"New York, NY",111,239,8

We were a party of two, and were seated in between two other parties of two, so it was quite a snug fit. The seating issue was the only big problem. I enjoy the concept of this restaurant. We ordered a variety of small plates- the bistro salad, the lobster roll sliders, the chicken and waffles, and something else I forget. Everything was the perfect size for us to share, and enough food. We also got a bottle of wine to split. We went all out for dessert and got both the chocolate tasting (which was huge) and the fresh doughnuts with raspberry, chocolate, and caramel dipping sauces. It was a bit of decadent meal, but well worth it. Our server was very polite and didn't rush us, and we ended up being seated for 2.5 hours (also prolonged by us catching up with each other).

In an effort to find a suitable place for my BFF's bachelorette dinner, I bribed the boy into trying out the Stanton Social with me. Here's everything we tried:The drinks were tasty and inventive, via:Blood-Orange Jalepeno MargaritaBasil-Gin MojitoWatermelon-Ginger MargaritaSomething else that was really good and gin based...I forget, however Pegu Club and PDT do cocktails better. 1/2 dozen Oysters - Though we'd like to consider ourselves adventurous, this was the first time either one of us had raw oysters. And they were...f*cking amazing! It was a total Anthony Bourdain from (the book) Kitchen Confidential moment; sea-salty flavorful, fresh, and oddly sexual.Kobe Beef sliders - See comment above.Chicken-n-Waffles - Good but not great. Maybe I'm just a displaced GRITS (girl raised in the south) but when I think of chicken-n-waffles, I'm thinking FRIED CHICKEN with crispy coating and etc. This chicken, though flavorful, was grilled! WTF?!This dish would be better orchestrated as a salad; grilled chicken, waffle-like bread bits, mixed mesclun greens, with that yummy  maple syrup/balsamic vinaigrette reduction as the salad dressing...I could support that.French Onion Soup Dumpling - Uber-stinky cheese (expect a weird look or two from tables in your vicinity) but damned tasty.Pickles - Meh. Maybe this is more a reflection of the actual pickle company (Gus's) but most of our spears were too 'new' ie; still cucumbers 1/2 a star off for the chicken in the chicken-n-waffles, and the too new pickles. 1/2 a star off for being just a *bit* too loud. I understand it's a trendy and scene-y place (lots of rich bitches and the sugar daddies that love them,) but there's a weird paradigm that Stanton Social gets you caught in: When you enter the resto and notice the loud music, you adjust your volume to be heard across your table...then they turn up the music, forcing you to raise your volume...and so it goes. 1/2 a star off for not knowing (or being told by the hostess or the waiter) that there was a lounge upstairs; though we were stuffed from our meal, we definitely would have continued drinking at the bar had we known of its existence!Total: 3.5 stars, but I really liked this place, so I'll round it up to 4.

Seriously, I'm only 20 years old and this place had me feeling like a middle aged person wishing for an aspirin from the loudness of the music. The food was really good, all were very creative interpretations of the original dishes and were good for sharing. I love tapas style eating because you can sample as many dishes as you want. I would recommend the French onion soup dumplings, the duck empanadas, the passionfruit cheesecake with basil sorbet (so refreshing), and the 90 proof milkshake shots. But the music was way too loud. I understand that it's trying to be hip and stylish, but really. When I'm eating I want to be able to talk to my dining companions. I would return here for brunch, but not for dinner. The wait was also awful even though I'd made reservations before hand. The hostess was also terrible, possibly the most vapid, dull-eyed creature I have ever met in my life. If she wasn't a size zero, there is no way that she would ever be in the working world. I went up no less than 5 times to inquire after my table and each time she would ask for every single piece of information all over again, then sort of wander around lifelessly without seeming to be actively looking for a table before telling me it would be a while longer. She even had the nerve to cut me off midway through me telling her my name, to 'HOLD ON A SECOND!' Seriously? I have been holding on for thirty minutes!! Ugh, I hate incompetent people. Anyway, good food, not too ridiculous prices, would return for lunch/brunch.July 28, 2008So I did return for brunch, and this time I was somewhat underwhelmed. Thankfully, the music was softer, providing a nicer atmosphere and I was seated almost immediately. I guess the incompetent hostess only works the night shift. The brunch offerings are pretty much the same with the addition of a few breakfast foods (pancakes, eggs benny, etc). This time however, I found the food a little unsatisfying. It's as though once you get over the novelty factor of everything being tiny and cute and creative, it actually isn't that great. The food's still good, but there's no wow-factor on the repeat visit.

Luckily, it was probably some of the best tapas I've ever had. One of the best cocktails, too (basil lime gimlet).We had goat cheese dumplings, some french fries, risotto cakes, duck sausage... I don't know, something else. Everything was great. I would definitely go back and try the raw bar and go with a bigger group so I can get one of those cool leather couches.The only reason I subtracted a star is because the restaurant is a carbon copy of so many other LES places. It follows the same red-and-black-dimly-lit-downtempo-music-in-background formula and attracts that same sort of crowd. Perhaps I'm one of those sheep, too, though....",2,0,0,Rob J.,"Washington, DC",9,104,0
4.0,6/8/2008,"I love tapas style restaurants because you get to try a little bit of EVERYTHING.  We came for my friend's birthday and ordered assorted dishes and desserts.  I liked everything we ordered (and we practically ordered everytong on the menu since we were a party of 7).  I also liked all of the desserts.  Pretty much you can't go wrong with anything on the menu (unless you are with someone who is a picky eater).  You have to go in anticipating that all the dishes are super small (which means it will be an expensive meal).  Also, you must make reservations in advance and they will only hold the table for 15 min - they threatened to give our table away even though it wasn't busy.Service is good and the seating is comfortable.  Good cocktail menu.",2,0,2,Diana N.,"NY, NY",73,646,0

As for the meat eaters, the meatballs were a dud. Haricot verts rounded out the meal. Smores cake was just a marketing ploy to sell a bad molten chocolate tart.  My suggestion is to do dessert and coffee elsewhere.Tip: If you are vegan or lactose- intolerant, they dust everything with cheese.

5.0,5/27/2008,"i mean, it IS the stanton social. what else do i have to say? let me preface this review by saying that i am highly biased to places that are trendy and exude all that defines NYC--amazing decor, unique cocktails, food that makes your mouth water days after, young 20-30s  crowd, and an experience that makes you feel like you're flying first class. reservations for dinner on a weekend need to be made far in advance--try 3 weeks to get a time between 7-9pm on a Friday or Saturday. before even sitting down, order the jalapeno margarita and the pineapple martini (don't forget to look around and realize that every girl at the restaurant has also ordered the pineapple martini). then the fun begins---the place is essentially a tapas restaurant. you order small appetizers (about 2-3 per person, 2 should be plenty if you are ordering drinks) and you fill up on a variety of food. if you only get one thing out of this review, it is that you MUST, i repeat MUST, order the french onion soup dumplings. imagine a bite of french onion soup in a savory little shell of cheese and bread and a crouton on top. yeah, i didn't think it could happen either. your next choice is obvious--chipotle grilled shrimp. i see people order shrimp cocktail and i always ask myself what IS the point? you can get shrimp cocktail anywhere. you can't get chipotle grilled shrimp made like this anywhere else. duck empanadas were okay --but the wasabi crusted salmon is perfection (it comes with soba noodles mmm). the best part is that the food comes 1-2 dishes at a time and you never feel rushed through your meal. the back wall of the restaurant is lined with wine bottles and a stair case that leads up to the upstairs lounge and restaurant. did i mention that this is a great date place? take your boyfriend or girlfriend, take a first date, and impress the hell out of the person you're with...not to mention great lounge music plays in the background so there is never that moment of awkward silence as you're eating dinner. finish off your dinner with a little moscato after dinner wine or just head upstairs to the lounge to top off a glam lower east side experience.",3,0,3,Alisa A.,"San Francisco, CA",87,42,0

Atmosphere was beautiful, though quite loud.  Our group of 5 was seated in a lovely high-backed booth. I tried several of the cocktails, and liked the vanilla-cucumber the best (have to say the blood orange-jalapeo margarita just tasted like a standard high-shelf drink).  There were some surprises when the bill came, as we'd had them adjust the orders to feed 5.  It worked well for sharing, but learning that the sliders were $9/a piece was a  bit of a shock.  As long as you come expecting to spend some cash, as we did, you'll have a great time.",1,0,1,Jessica F.,"San Francisco, CA",4,40,0
4.0,5/25/2008,"I came here for dinner with a few friends visiting from out of town.  We sat upstairs in the lounge, which had couches and tiny low tables.  Cool atmosphere, but it was kind of hard to eat because the tables were so small that once a plate of food arrived, there wasn't much space for our own individual small plates.  We ended up eating with the plates on our laps.I love restaurants with small plates because you get to try a little bit of everything.  The french onion soup dumplings were an interesting take on  a popular soup.  The dumplings were filled with onions and a little beef broth, so the ""soup"" was inside, then smothered with a stinky melted cheese.  It was pretty good, but I'd have preferred a little more liquid, which is what I imagine when I see the word soup on the title of the dish.The next few dishes we had were all pretty good too, and combined sweet and salty flavors that complemented each other well.  There were the quesedillas with apples, brie, bacon bits and a sweet mustard sauce, the grilled pizzete with apple-chicken sausage and grilled peaches, and the chicken and waffles with balsamic maple syrup, which all had interesting flavors.  They definitely get high points for the creativity of their dishes!For dessert we shared the molten smores cake and the chocolate tasting.  The smores cake was ok, basically like a molten chocolate cake with melted marshmallow in the middle instead of hot chocolate sauce.  But it wasn't the best.  The cake itself was very dense and it just wasn't very special or memorable.  The presentation was cute, it came with a graham cracker stuck in it and was served with a tiny glass of milk.The chocolate tasting was exceptionally decadent.  We had a chocolate mouse, chocolate panna cotta, truffles with a deliciously crunchy outer shell, lemon curd brownie, peppermint patties, and chocolate ice cream with crunchy cookie crumbs on the bottom.  For the most part they were pretty good and weren't too sweet, which I liked.  I wasn't a huge fan of the mousse but I loved the ice cream and everything else was pretty good, but there was just so much food on the plate.  I recommend splitting this one between at least 4 people.",2,0,2,Velina L.,"New York, NY",283,558,9

After we sat down, we noticed the knife and plate had food stains on it which was not very appetizing.  We ordered like 7 plates of tapaps but they came out slowly like a teaser.  It was at least a 5-10min wait for the next dish.  On the menu it said the dishes r served continuously but that didn't happen.  Overall, this place is good for small groups, small tapas and small drinks.",2,0,2,Jackie P.,"New York, NY",13,118,145

4.0,5/9/2008,"Like a certain CW teen drama that may or may not rhyme with ""Boss sip Pearl"", the Stanton Social is one of my most enjoyable guilty pleasures.  Yes, it's overrun with B &Ters on the weekends, and yes it's over-priced for small plates, but damn if I don't love it every time I go here.First off,  I'm a complete sucker for good design, and it's totally beautiful inside, especially the upstairs lounge. Perfectly dim lighting, pretty antique hand mirrors on the wall, and another wall of wine bottles arranged in a herringbone pattern, apparently an homage to the neighborhood's past life as a garment district.  Love it.And now, the food--as with any small plates restaurant, there are going to be hits and misses, but at SS I feel I've had mostly hits.  Most notably, the French Onion Soup Dumplings (I'm quite confident I could eat about 5 orders of these on my own), tuna tartare spring rolls, warm donuts with 3 dipping sauces, the raw bar platter...and finally, the Kobe slider.  The Stanton Social slider singlehandedly (alliteration, yes!) moved me from the category of People Who Don't Eat Red Meat into the category of People Who Eat EVERYTHING, and I thank it for making me the person I am today.  Seriously, that was it--one bite and vegetarianism was out the window.   Am I really that impressionable?  It would appear to be the case.  I think what it really comes down to is this:  finger food is fun, and high-concept finger food (um hello crab cake corn dogs?) is really fun when it's done well in a beautiful space and with tasty drinks (a little on the fruity side, but hey--guilty pleasure, remember?).  Stanton Social, I don't care if you're too post-trendy or expensive.  You are delicious and beautiful and I'll eat your donuts any day!",12,13,16,Becca S.,"Brooklyn, NY",264,300,69

The tastiest was the duck empanadas, which I ordered with Irri in mind because she likes duck more than I. It was plump and savory, over a thick tomato-ey sauce. We also had: spicy miso glazed edamame - edamame was overpowered with the glaze, and ended on my fingers like bbq; lobster roll - is soo mini, it's cute but not a comparison to the city's popular establishments for lobster rolls; potato & goat cheese pierogies with caramelized onions and creamy dip - 2nd best dish, really good; kobe slider - wack, it was cold, and tasted like regular beef; and haricots verts with garlic and asiago - simple and delicious, with a crunch to them.

My party was a little late but they had no problem seating us when everyone arrived (phew, because the place got really crowded).We had a vegetarian with us and was sharing plates so we focused on the non-meat dishes:1) Warm doughnuts with caramel sauce. Yum, nice and fluffy. The caramel sauce was delicious. We actually kept snacking on the sauce after they took the rest of the plate away...2) Silver dollar pancakes drizzled with chocolate chunks and honey. Another yum. Perfect consistency. And these taste great with the caramel sauce from 1). The pancakes are a popular item, we kept on seeing plates of these flying by.3) Potato latke pancakes with apple sauce and sour cream. Pretty standard. They were extra crispy, but nothing too special. 4) Breakfast bruschetta. Tomatos and eggs over toast. Good, but nothing too special, in my opinion. 5) Mushroom and burrata cheese frittata with toast. Good, nice and crisp (I like my eggs well done). Portions are small.

It's a good mix and you have something for every one's palette. We received complimentary toast with garlic and some sort of fruit spread (tasty) as we decided what we wanted. They have plates that are for sharing (left of the menu as we were told) and individual sized portions as well (appetizers, right of the menu). The pierogies were really great, and they really pop with flavor. The spicy tuna roll wasn't all that- avoid it. This is not the place to get sushi- stick with something else. We had pizzetta which was a good size for the group of 5. Thin and crispy with a good topping of tomatoes and cheese. We shared the mooshoo shrimp crepes- which were really fun to eat because it was different from all the fried carbohydrates. VERY flavorful. Lastly, we had the butternut squash raviolis- my favorite.

The music was loungey but the good pleasant kind that created just the right atmosphere. We were a party of 5. We ordered a bunch of tapas and drinks and our total was only $60 a person! Seriously that wasn't bad at all considering how much we drank and ate. We had multiple orders of crab cake corn dogs, french onion soup dumplings, macaroni and cheese, short rib tacos, something tuna tartare, and something lobster. Everything was scrumptious! My favorites were the crab cake corn dogs and the french onion soup dumplings! Luckily our waiter was attentive and courteous which is rare in NYC & we weren't rushed even though we were probably the last table they seated that night.",4,0,5,Lori K.,"Orange County, CA",266,917,145
5.0,3/8/2008,"I think I'm in love! Stanton Social is perfect for someone like me. It's tapas style so you can try a little bit of everything. I would definitely recommend going with a group so you can order a bunch of stuff off the menu because otherwise its just too hard to decide...everything looks so amazing!Ambiance - super relaxed, loungy feel. You absolutely don't feel cramped which is very rare in the city and you're not having your brunch while trying to tune out the next table's conversation. The tables are spaced out enough that you can actually talk to the people you came with instead of being bombarded with noise from all sides. The lighting is very romantic and the upstairs dining area looked cute. Food - um, can you say yum?! We  got the potato and goat cheese perogies - absolutely fabulous! There was the perfect proportion of goat cheese to potato. Banana pancakes - DIVINE! Just the right amount of sweetness with candied pecans and bananas on top coupled with a vanilla syrup to die for. We also ordered the french onion dumplings - presentation was good, but taste was DEF lacking. I actually love french onion soup, but hated these! They didn't loose a star though because I think it might have been b/c I'm not a cheddar person and it had massive amounts of cheddar on top. The breakfast bruschetta was def yum, but I should have ordered it with egg whites cuz I hate yolk! The egg consistency was good though..very fluffy and the toast was perfectly toasted. The spinach frittata was so light...it had a touch too much goat cheese, but I think that's just me cuz I'm not a fan of eggs and cheese together.  I am dying to go back to try the kobe beef burgers, apple and brie quesadilla, and the pizzata which looked amazing! I love the cute small portions..simply perfection!Service - fantastic! The waitres was right on with all of her suggestions and the entire staff was very friendly. The only negative thing was that they didn't have skim milk for the coffee I ordered and they only had sweet n low and equal..no splenda! :( I would probably pass on the coffee next time anyway b/c it was a little too strong for me. In short - I will def be back!",1,0,1,Jasneet G.,"New York, NY",12,46,0
5.0,3/8/2008,"omg YUMMMM.  I LOVE THIS PLACE.  i had brunch here 5 hours ago and i'm still thinking about it.  We got the banana pancakes with carmelized pecans, the goat cheese potato perogies, the french onion dumplings, the spinach, tomato, goat cheese frittata, and the scrambled egg bruschetta.oh..and it was just 2 of us!  but the portions are small b/c it's tapas style - and the food presentation is 1/2 of the charm of this place.  everything is mini and cute - and b/c it's small you can try a lot more dishes without getting too full which i am a fan of.the banana pancakes were great - they are a stack of 5 mini pancakes  with candied pecans and vanilla-type syrup on the side.  the perogies - were like little packets of heaven - dip them in the little bit of sour cream provided..omg yum - and this is my first perogie experience...i don't think i'll ever try a perogie anywhere else lest it not compare to stanton social's.the french onion dumplings were not really my thing...there was too much cheese and i guess i don't like french onion soup - b/c the dumplings are packed with the soup and it just didn't taste good - but i'd say if you like french onion soup you might like this.  we asked for it to be taken back and ordered the bruschetta in its place and our waitress didn't charge for the dumplings.i requested the frittata to be made with egg whites - and it was no problem - and tasted great.  small..but it's tapas so that's expected.finally, the bruschetta - the bruschetta is basically - bruschetta type toasted bread, with tomatoes topped with soft scrambled eggs, and finally drizzled with a bit of pesto sauce.  i'm not an egg yolk person..but DAMN.  this was good.  and an interesting take on bruschetta for breakfast!All in all - this was a great brunch experience - the amount of food we got was just enough to get me full without feeling too full - the ambience is really sexy - dim lights, dark wooden tables, and chilled-out music gives the place a great ambience.  service was great.  i'd recommend making a reservation - b/c it was certainly packed...and this was at 230 on a saturday..pretty late brunch timing.i'm definitely going to try this place for dinner.  they had kobe beef burgers...that were just SOO Cute looking!!  i'm a veg - but it was just too cute..and i'm sure it probably tasted great b/c a lot of ppl were ordering it.it's open till 3 am most nights - and located in the LES - so a great post-partying spot to get your grub on as well.for a girl who always always gets egg-white omelets because she doesn't want to eat a huge stack of pancakes but always craves at least a bite, stanton social's portions allow me to get my healthy egg whites AND satisfy my sweet tooth.If you don't check this place out - you're lame.oh..side note:  for that amount of food - price was 40 bucks...20 per person...really not a bad deal in my opinion for the quality, presentation, atmosphere, and service.  YUM.",2,0,2,Jasmin G.,"New York, NY",121,513,6

So combining the two made it a nice night for me and Armin L. to share a bunch of little dishes and taste as much as our wallet could afford. The selection of East & West Coast Oysters was really good and they leave the lemon on the sides to add at your discretion. The tartar was a nice consistency and not too fish but I've had better. My favorite part of the meal was the warm doughnut dessert with its multiple dipping sauces.There are just so many tapas to choose from that I would suggest going back more than once..or you can go in a huge group and try to order all you can.",2,0,2,Samantha S.,"Brooklyn, NY",125,377,44
4.0,2/12/2008,"Stanton Social is a way of life really . . . to eat, to drink, to leave happy . . . I'll eat oysters at the bar around 11:00 pm, brunch downstairs on a Sunday at 2:00, rally a group for dinner at midnight, or just drink upstairs.  Nothing quite makes me feel the way that bistro salad does . . frisse, warm goat cheese dressing, a poached egg, homemade croutons and bacon.  It's tart, rich, and texturally perfect.  The yellowfin tuna sashimi melts in your mouth and finishes with a little pop of pickled pepper leaving you wanting more fish, then more bite, and so the cycle continues . . . The raw bar holds up in both quality and presentation to that of any seafood restaurant downtown.  The lobster is at once delicate and meaty and always tastes like buttery ocean water . . .and they serve raw littlenecks. . . There isn't a foie gras terrine I've met and not wanted to date so it goes without saying that it holds a small place in my heart - the social version being no exception.The French onion soup dumplings - a staple paying homage to the Chinatown soup dumplings at fixtures like Joe's Shanghai are special: stinky, melty, swoony cheese and onions . . the only thing that could make them better would be a fleck of bacon floating inside.I almost always order a mini Kobe beef slider of course and the red snapper tacos - but eat the tacos right away because they get soggy fast, and nothing beats that crispy little shell and diced, peppery fish cut by the bite of lime and a cool dab of creamy avocado.The only dish that doesn't tickle me in the way that nearly everything else about the social does are the crab corn dogs . . .just can't fully commit to feeling excited about them.   The coating soggs-out into the filling and they quickly become dense and morph into monotone filler in my stomach. Knowing the flavors and textures I can get elsewhere on the menu makes me focus on what I consider to be the stand-outs: just about everything else.",2,0,2,Hadley H.,"New York, NY",5,5,0
5.0,2/5/2008,"Brought the whole family here for brunch to celebrate my sister's birthday and my god was it good.  I've been here for dinner before and enjoyed it, but I honestly think the brunch is even better.  Like others have said, it is tapas style so be prepared to share.  With a party of 6 we ordered 10 dishes (well technically 13 if you count the 3 kobe beef sliders as separate dishes... as the restaurant does).  It was the perfect amount of food... everyone was satiated but not overly stuffed.  The Ricotta Frittas and French Onion Soup Dumplings were my favorites, with the banana nut pancakes rounding out the top three.  Service was very friendly and attentive, with rounds of two dishes coming every few minutes.  Pretty much everything you could ever want in a brunch spot... well, except for unlimited mimosas and bloody mary's.  But that might be asking too much from such a nice spot.",1,0,3,Jason H.,"New York, NY",77,112,5

4.0,1/30/2008,"Where can a group of friends have a great dinner out in style, share a good variety of food and drinks, leave feeling fed and happily intoxicated without having to deal with messy ""split the bill"" calculations at the end?Not recommended for ultra-serious foodies, but this place is nonetheless a hip & modern lair perfect for groups out to just have a great time eating, drinking and laughing. Good variety on food & drink menus, but don't waste time trying to decide what to choose when you share it all.Simply gather a bunch of friends and opt for the prix fixe menu ($48) and open bar ($20 per hour you're there; choose to down as many drinks as you like - anything from champagne to pineapple martinis). Share food, laughter and drinks amidst the elegant, low-lit setting and you will almost feel as if you're at a stylish, underground soiree. Look around you, everyone else seems to be having a ball too. The only problem I had was that due to lighting and alcohol, I could hardly see what I was eating. But they all tasted good, so no complaints there.Even though I can't recall much about the food itself (it was all a blurry good time), I woke up the next day with a good hangover, a craving for the wonderful doughnuts for dessert that was accompanied by  3 dipping sauces, and was thankful none of us had to deal with messy bill calculation procedures at the end of it.For a complete good time, be prepared to fork out about $120 per head.",3,0,2,June W.,"Manhattan, NY",11,42,33
4.0,1/29/2008,"Can I just say how cryptic their website is?  Okay, now that that's off my chest... I'll just rank the items we ordered (from best to worst), since nearly everything has already been said...1. Warm Doughnuts: 6 delightful pillows of warm dough with 3 dipping sauces... perfect!2. Chocolate Tasting: Very creative dish of 4 mini-servings.  Awesome presentation and enough to share among 2-3 people easily.3. Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies: Absolutely wonderful upscale interpretation of a dish I already love.4. Social Tea: Really well-made cocktail, but drink it before all the ice melts, which makes for a sad drink at the end.5. French Onion Soup Dumplings: I guess I'm not that huge of a fan of French Onion Soup, but they were good.  About 6-7 servings.6.Main Crabcake ""Corn Dogs"": They were a fun take on the crabcake and tasty, but nothing that really wowed me.  There were only 3, so I thought that was kinda skimpy.7. Chicken Mole Taquitos: Skip it.  Not seasoned very well and nothing special whatsoever.  The decor was excellent and is definitely an ""NYC"" sort of thing that would impress out-of-town friends or relatives.  Overall, the desserts were MUCH better than the food, so it would be a nice place to come for drinks and desserts.  The best part of dinner was as we were leaving though, while the waitress was speaking to the table next to us:Waitress: Welcome!  Is this your first time here?Guy: Well, kind of.  I used to live about 2 blocks from here.Waitress: ... okay.",2,1,2,Phillip L.,"Brooklyn, NY",47,269,50

And I wasn't disappointed at all, but definitely expect to shell out a bit of money for this place.Made reservations on a Tuesday night at 9:15pm for a friend and I. I was actually surprised that the place was packed when I got there and packed when I left (around 11pm). The waiter told us to choose 2 small dishes (left side of the menu) and 2 large dishes (right side of the menu). We ended up choosing 3 small and 2 large --Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies - Amazing!Sweet & Sour Chicken & Cashew Spring Rolls  - Not bad at allPumpkin And Goat Cheese Croquettes - How can you go wrong with this combination?Chicken & Waffles - Very tasty combination - the balsamic maple syrup is amazing!Kobe Beef Slider (me), Lobster Roll (friend) - Both pretty good, nothing out of this world though.Of course we were hungry after that, so we ordered the chicken sausage pizzetta and some kind of duck confit dumpling. The pizzetta was pretty good but the duck confit was just alright, although the blood orange sauce was tasty. Oh, we also had drinks at the beginning of the meal - just  a few of the house cocktails, which were extremely small and expensive so we stayed away from those. Dessert was the apple pie sundae (my friend doesn't like chocolate!) and that was good and definitely plenty to share.The only thing I didn't like was that the bill was $70 per person. But ah, probably won't be back there anytime soon, at least until I save up some more money :-P.

I don't eat beef, but the group I was with also got the kobe beef sliders and the beef wellington (which are supposed to be amazing).We also got dessert - the doughnuts are great, as were the hot chocolate shots.

So... needless to say that my expectations were pretty high when I got there (too high?), but unfortunately I was a little disappointed. Let me first say that the venue is great: the restaurant is pretty large and the ambiance was very pleasant. They also have a great sound system (though I thought the music was a little too loud at times). Service was also spotless.Now about the food: it's American tapas, which sounds promising, but I was not wowed. My boyfriend and I shared: - the zucchini tempura- the chicken mole taquitos- the Maine crabcake corndogs- the moo shu shrimp- the charred squid lettuce wraps.Everything was pretty tasty, but nothing really stood out or impressed me very much... Considering the prices, I just expected more. Kudos however to their cocktail menu: I had a pineapple martini, and the ""social tea"" (citrus vodka and green tea), and both were really good.Not a bad experience nor a bad dinner, but I was not overly impressed by the food.

4.0,12/16/2007,"I have 50-50 feels about the Stanton Social.  It's a beautiful restaurant with great ambiance but it's also very popular (which isn't a bad thing for the owner/staff) which doesn't make a great dining experience.  I like eating and having a good conversation with my dining partners without the need to shout.  From my experience, it cannot happen at Stanton Social.  But what makes a restaurant should first and foremost be the food.  The Stanton Social's menu is primarily served tapas-style which means you order lots of little dishes for sharing.  Expensive little dishes.  During the course of dinner, my friend and I ordered the following:~ Maine Crabcake Corn Dogs - really delicious and creative.  Well-seasoned and really flavorful.  It was arguably the highlight of all the dishes we sampled with the exception of the dessert.~ Red Snapper Tacos (w/ creamy avocado & spicy mango) - Delicious as well.  Having the corn dogs and the tacos come as the first 2 dishes made my outlook for the meal very positive.~ Yellowfin Tuna Sashimi (w/ pickled jalapeno, avocado, & yuzu ginger dipping sauce) - not a huge fan of this dish.  2 reasons.  One, I wasn't really in the mood for sashimi and two, this is a dish you can get any sushi restaurant in NY.  Why eat it here?  An obvious mistake on our ordering.~ Rhode Island Style Lobster Roll Slider & a Kobe Philly Slider (w/ truffle & goat cheese fondue) - buttered bread, bite-sized.  I think the concept of sliders are great 'cause you get a little sampling and it doesn't fill you up too fast. ~ Charred Squid Lettuce Wraps (w/ spicy papaya kimchi, miso mayo & jalapeno-soy) - the charred squid trumped the entire dish.  I think the dish got too complicated with the jalapeno-soy and the miso mayo.  It is worth getting once but definitely not my favorite of the meal.~ Hanger Steak & Tots (w/ tater tots, bleu cheese fondue & housemade cherry tomato ketchup) - I love tater tots and I love steak but again, this is a dish you can get at any other restaurant as well.  Why eat it here?  BUT, it was YUMMY so my tummy didn't complain.~ Pumpkin Profiteroles (w/ pumpkin pie pastry cream) - I want a tub of pumpkin profiteroles and candied currants now.  So good, so good, so good!!!!Overall, I had a good time.  I think it's grossly priced but hey, it was worth trying once.  And the service was good with an attentive staff.  But a restaurant with a uni-sex bathroom annoys me.  4 stars (I liked the food but not the dining experience).",7,4,5,Yosh H.,"New York, NY",246,401,84
3.0,12/6/2007,"It was good but a little overhyped and overpriced. The ambiance is great- it feels like a lounge and the drinks are good. The service was friendly and attentive. It is a fun place for small groups because then you can try a little bit of everything. For the 2 of us, we ate much more than we wanted of each dish. So I guess that shows that even if I liked it, it wasn't enough to eat a lot of any one item. We had the french onion soup dumplings which were very heavy and really nothing to write home about. I did really enjoy the potato & goat cheese pierogies...partially for the yummy truffle creme fraiche. As for their famous kobe beef sliders...they did make it to order (medium rare) but I didn't see what was so great about it.

3.0,12/1/2007,"Yummy, yummy, yummy!We went here for brunch last weekend by recommendation and everything on the menu made my mouth water.  The grilled apple & brie quesadillas were delicious, and it took about everything I had to not order a dozen more of the sausage & gravy biscuit sliders and inhale them.It's tapas-style brunch, but none of us were in the mood to share.  We expressed that to our server, and each ordered our own dishes, but unfortunately that didn't stop him from bringing things out a few a time.  We also showed up starving, and the service was more leisurely than our stomachs could handle - just a warning.I will definitely return the next time I'm in NY, but will go in less hungry than last time, and will make sure everyone's in the mood to share, because I think it would have been more fun that way.Oh, and minus one star for the truck-stop filthy bathroom on the 3rd level of the restaurant - it was truly appalling.",3,0,1,brittany z.,"Austin, TX",1,28,0

BUT you hafta be aware that the portion size is TEEENY TINY. Like really tiny. In all we got about 5 appetizers for the 3 of us. We got the red snapper tacos which were amazing! I'm still craving them...There were 3 maybe 4 Tacos, each being maybe two bites big. I highly recommend the brie and apple quesadilla. I think that and the tacos were my favorite tapas of the night. Drink-wise, I got the cucumber vanilla martini which was good but not quite as amazing as the pink greatfruit mint martini. Yum!We finishing things off with the hot donuts which came with 3 dipping sauces. It was the perfect thing to finish off the evening with! Definitely have to get it!The night would've ended perfectly until it came time to get my umbrella which I checked in at the front. It was a rainy night in NY and I assumed my umbrella was in safe keeping. Needless to say, I was pretty frustrated when they couldn't find my umbrella. I spoke to a woman at the front who didn't seem to care much that they lost it. It was kinda a shitty way to end the night.

And cocktails and 2 bottles of wine. oy vey! our favorite item was the red snapper tacos, but the short rib tacos were also really good.

4.0,10/19/2007,"A solid 4 stars. First of all, I like the small plates idea. As someone who takes the entree decision very seriously, I like the option of not needing to commit to just one. I guess I am what you call a ""dinner player"". The service was attentive, but a bit rushed. The whole meal was done in about 45 minutes. To be fair, we did not order dessert, but it still seemed fast to me. The waiter recommended a nice Beaujolais. It started off very dry, but opened up nicely over the course of the meal. I would recommend it. For plates we got:Red Snapper Tacos: These could have been SO much better. They weren't bad, but they needed a big boost of flavor. They came with a chipotle mayonnaise that was just a big ball of heat, no real flavor. French Onion Soup Dumplings: These were great. Different. Great Flavor, made me want an actual bowl of the soup. Kobe Beef Sliders: Very good, a little too much ketchup for my taste, but cooked perfectly. I would say these are the standout item from the ones we chose. Pickle Guy Pickles: Good, as usualChicken N' waffles: The chicken part was a little weak, but the waffles were good, as was the funky soy- molasses tasting ""syrup"". All in all, I think it was a good experience. For two of us, including the bottle of wine, we were just over  $100, which I think is a good value. We left full, but not stuffed, which is even better. Then we took ourselves over to Cake Shop and got cupcakes. Their cupcakes are SOOOO good. Oh and I meant to say that we were there on Tuesday, and had trouble getting a reservation.

5.0,8/29/2007,"I love this place, it is perhaps my favorite place in my neighborhood and if that makes me pretentious, well then I'm pretentious. There are certain menu items that never ever have failed me: goat cheese pirogies with caramelized onions, red snapper tacos, spicy lobster pasta and the wild salmon with sobe noodles. The fresh donuts that they serve for dessert are ridiculously good and they have at least three cocktails that I can't get enough of which is kind of a bad thing (rosemary tangerine cooler served up not on the rocks as it is on the menu, pink grapefruit and mint martini and the Social Tea).I very rarely sit in the dining room as that is not the optimal experience, I prefer to sit at the bar upstairs or the lounge as a second choice. If you get there reasonably early on a Friday, say around 7:30, you can score a couple of seats at the bar when people who are waiting for their reservations leave. Usually for two people with 4 drinks each the tab is about $180 with tip but we usually get one round on the bartender.Also, brunch is excellent there, the menu has many of my favorite dinner items as well as some very brunch specific plates like the breakfast bruschetta which is scrumptious.",1,0,1,Cyn C.,"New York, NY",146,13,0

5.0,8/21/2007,"Chris Santos, chef and owner of the Stanton Social, wrote me on yelp after reading my initial review (posted below). He was upset. He was angry but not too angry to invite me to come back as his guest and try it again. I graciously accepted his offer to show up at his restaurant and gorge myself on free food. Wasn't that nice of me?I went with my good friend Adrianna. We started off the evening excited and giddy and I can't deny that after plates and plates of amazing food kept rolling out, personally prepared and delivered by Chris, I felt like the cat that got the cream. Then we slowly began to realize that Chris was punishing us in the worst way. Punishing us by continuing to send out food that was too good to resist eating, regardless of the fact that my stomach, spleen, esophagus, and I think also my left knee cap were crying out for mercy! Well played Chris Santos, well played. You have won today. I am in serious, serious pain and your beef wellington brought it on me.If you read further I am going to list what we ate, every gory detail. If you are not sickened by the idea of two 28 year old girls eating enough food to feed an NYC firehouse, read on and benefit from the pain that reviewing practically every SINGLE thing on the Station Social menu has brought upon me!Blood Orange and Jalapeno margarita - 2 thumbs up. spicy!Pear & Saki martini - also deliciousLittle pizzas - one with basil, tomato, and mozz - really excellent. The sauce is spicy in the most delightful way. The one with ricotta, caramelized onion, and bacon was my favorite though! I told Chris I could eat that for the rest of my life and he told me not to be gratuitous! I made a little mental note to insult him the next time around.BUT then he brought out the raw bar tray of kumamoto oysters and shrimp cocktail and I changed my mind. GET the kumamoto oysters. They are perfect - creamy and fresh like they'd just been plucked from the ocean. Tuna Sashimi - with pickled jalapeno and avocado - one of our favoritesSocial Tea - good, not remarkableChampagne Julep - minty and fantastic! This was my favorite drinkFoies gras terrine - holy mother of god. It was so rich and creamy that Adrianna and I kept speculating whether they'd managed to mix butter into it somehow. ORDER this!!! The little salad that comes on the plate with candied walnuts and apples is divine as well.Goat Cheese Pierogi with white truffle creme fraiche - BLISS. we kept talking about this one for the rest of the eveningFrench Onion Soup Dumplings - Adrianna: ""amazing""Duck Confit Empanadas - get em while you can! They're coming off the menu soon. Because I said I didn't like them. I kid! They were good. Chris is tired of making empanadas.Crab Cake Corn Dogs -  Crab meat prepared like a corn dog. Crazy? Perhaps. Genius? Don't be gratuitous! TastyChipotle Shrimp - Adrianna says ""good Mexican restaurant"" Red Snapper Tacos - still not a big fan of theseKobe Burgers - Adrianna never eats red meat. She ate every bite and loved it. Me too.Asian Ribs - good, but paling in comparison to the kobeTater tots - the one thing that I really didn't like. I love the idea of them, but they seemed bland and too oily.Fries - delicious! accompanied with 4 great saucesChicken on waffle - This was really good - the chicken was crisp and juicy and the corn pudding/waffle/chicken combo was winning.Beef Wellington - another favorite. GET THIS. truffle sauce mmmm...Sick yet? time for dessert!! Fresh donuts with caramel, chocolate, and rasperry sauces were great. I LOVE that everything caramel here is salty caramel - big props to Chris for that. I am a huge fan of the fleur de sel.Homemade cracker-jack type stuff (I forget the fancy name). This was incredible - I wanted to shove some into my purse. Maybe I did...Apples with pie dough and cinnamon ice cream - no complaints here.Chris - you are lovely and so is your staff. I wish you the best. Or do I?Love, your nemesisOriginal Review:I think the owners of the Stanton Social sat around one day, trying to figure out how to get people to pay ridiculous prices for tiny food. Then they decided to call it ""shared plates."" And voila! The $7 single kobe beef slider was born. And this is coming from a girl who eats at Per Se, so it's not like I won't spend $$$ peeps.The worst crime they are guilty of though, in my opinion, is serving extremely ""meh"" food.I had the french onion soup dumplings - yeah, they were good. The sliders were good too. Just good though, not great. The rest of the food (mini chorizo paella things, red snapper tacos, some chocolate mousse dessert) was decidedly average.

5.0,7/3/2007,"This place is amazing. Very hip but discreet. My friends took me here while I was visiting them from out of town. While we waited for our table we ordered cocktails from the drink menu. It was so hard to decide what to get. I decided to get the cranberry martini which was very sweet and not too strong. When we sat down I was told that the onion soup dumplings are the best thing, and they were! They are served in an escargot dish, little dumplings with melted cheese on top and carmelized onions with some broth inside, they are amazing! Next each person in my party of 4 chose a dish and we shared them all. (it is tapas style) The quesadilla was quite interesting with brie cheese and pear and honey drizzled on top. It seems like an odd combo but it tasted great! It was time for another drink just before we ordered dessert so I ordered the pineapple martini, that was more impressive and tasty then the cranberry one. It had a dried pineapple on top and was delicious! For dessert we ordered the warm donuts that come with several dipping sauces. This definitely did not disappoint, was worth every penny and I would come back the next time I am in NY! P.S. its probably best to go with a group of 4, that way you can order just enough without being too full and everyone can share a portion without cutting them up into tiny pieces.",1,0,0,Nicole C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",5,20,0

Crab cake ""corn dogs"" were just what they sounds like - crab cakes on a stick, tasty. Lobster risotto (special that night) was delicious and rich. Braised short rib soft tacos were good, but nothing special. Red snapper tacos were a winner. Bistro salad was refreshing.Only complaint would be how tight it is in there. We were seated upstairs in the corner, but the table next to us was so close, you had to either sit in their food to scoot out to get to the restroom, or you had to fully move out one of the tables to make room. Also, this place is not cheap, especially if you order drinks, so be warned. But you will enjoy the food, and the atmosphere is good for small groups.",1,0,2,Jennifer L.,"New York, NY",26,290,0
4.0,6/12/2007,"I went with a group of 4 at around 9ish on a Saturday night which pretty much means we have no shot at getting a table for another two hours.  We somehow managed to convince the hostess upstairs to let us sit in the lounge area and order food until 10.  Boy am I glad she did!  First off, I was really diggin' the vibe of the place.  Good music, good looking crowd, great decor...I was feeling pretty good about this place.  The menu of  small plates were so diverse and creative that I was a bit skeptical.  They all turned out to be great.  I don't think I was disappointed with a single one!  My personal favorites were the French Onion Soup Dumplings, the Kobe Beef Sliders, Hanger Steak and the Tuna Tartare Roll.  I also enjoyed the Wild Plum and Brie Quesadilla, Crabcake Corn Dogs, and Wild Salmon.  We shared a bottle of my favorite Sauvignon Blanc from Marlborough, New Zealand.  We stayed til 10:30 and they didn't really hassle us for the table.  Instead they just brought a group of 8-10 models and sat them down in our booth with us.  I can't make this stuff up!  We didn't get to order dessert, but that looked phenomenal as well.  I'm definitely coming back to this place next time I'm in town.",1,0,2,Dave L.,"San Francisco, CA",267,77,53
5.0,6/12/2007,"This place is truly awesome. Order a bunch of different ""tapas"" style dishes and try one of each. If there's 5 pieces and only 4 people I'm the guy that eats two of each. I simple don't give a damn what the other three think. Sometimes you gotta do it. Just go for it and don't worry about the consequences.So what if they find out anyway... I'll have already eaten 2 pieces and they each only had one. You could say i am doubly better off. All of the plates are crazy delicious and the atmosphere and presentation is in a way that makes you feel like you belong there. Go for it.",2,1,2,Patrick B.,"Hoboken, NJ",40,119,30
3.0,6/12/2007,"This is definitely a cute, trendy place to eat. The food was tasty, but because of the small portions each person has to order two things in order to be fairly satiated. My boyfriend and I ordered the red snapper tacos, goat cheese pierogies, the pizetta, the honey-brie quesadillas, and the spicy edamame. It was enough for the two of us and the bill came to about $58 with coffee (no drinks or dessert - we are on a budget). Overall, it was tasty and I enjoyed being able to sample several things. It was pricey, and I was concerned about us not getting enough food.",1,0,2,Karen M.,"Brooklyn, NY",124,293,47
4.0,6/3/2007,"Instead of going for a restaurant with a more local, Bohemian flair, I went for one that was a bit sceney for the East Village setting. I couldn't resist. The brunch menu sounded amazing. I was struck. I needed to go to The Stanton Social. I love Brunch with a passion. It's the perfect grouping of items, in portions small enough to eat, and at a time when our minds are sober enough to appreciate the food that enters our mouth. It's the perfect meal, the morning after... The brunch items at The Stanton are small in portion, like a Tapas style meal of sorts. It is designed to encourage sharing among friends. Since we were sharing, that meant we could eat more right? Oh, how I love to delude myself to justify my gluttony. Isn't it interesting how we make up excuses to justify our incorrigible behavior, just because we don't want to accept the truth? :oPMy friend and I toasted our meal with blushing Pomegranate-Peach Bellinis which were tart and fruity. Then we went hog wild with our pickin's. I love Eggs Benedict and was immediately drawn to the Fancy Benedict, which I had to order. It consisted of Lobster and grilled Asparagus served over toasted Brioche, topped with a poached egg and drizzled with Bernaise Sauce. On the side was a pile of perfectly dressed baby greens. The Lobster tail was moist, the asparagus sweet, the toast buttery, and the egg...ah, the yolk was oozy and perfect, coating everything that laid beneath it and further enrichening the Bernaise. The dish was amazing. It was sooo good. I was in love.Our meal proceeded on with the Breakfast Bruschetta, which consisted of slabs of crusty bread, toasted and topped with oven dried diced tomatoes, soft scrambled eggs, and shavings of Asiago cheese. It was a nice, light intercession before the courses ahead. Next came the Brie and Apple Quesadillas, drizzled with Honey and dusted with chile powder. Sweet but not too sweet, counterbalanced by the savory Brie. It was really good.And then came the Sliders. Maybe it's because I'm small, but I love dishes that are little. They're so cute. Ok, as a self-proclaimed foodie, I'm aware that it's blasphemy to describe food as cute. The cute factor should be reserved for rating the boys, i.e. Bobby Dean...oh he's so dreamy! Anyhow, getting back :oP... I just think that little burgers and sandwiches are adorable. They fit in one hand and can be devoured instantly. It's all about instant gratification I say.We ordered two sliders: The first was the Kobe Beef Burger and the second was the Monte Christo. The Kobe was cooked to medium rare, which is how I like my meat. Only downside was that the outside was underseasoned and too charred, which imparted a bitter taste that overpowered the sweetness of the meat. Quite umimpressive. As for the Monte Christo, it was a hit. The sandwich was filled with slices of ham, turkey, and swiss, soaked in a an egg custard and cooked until set. What made it extra luxurious was that it was steeped in a bath of lightly sweetened maple syrup and honey. The eggy bread was soft and succulent, dripping with maple and perfectly balanced with the savory, oozing filling. A sandwich this perfect has now set the bar for all the sandwiches that is to come. I just can't go back to a standard sandwich after this one. I'm spoiled! To round out the meal, my friend wanted to try the Potato and Goat Cheese Pierogies, which I let her have full reign over. I'm a sucker for pierogies, especially fried ones like these. I could only sample a bite, but It was really good from what I can tell. My friend loved them. I think these were her faves. The pierogies were served with a pile of caramelized onions and a pool of Truffle Creme Fraiche. It's one thing about not eating the pierogies, but it's another thing when it comes to the creme fraiche. I dipped my finger, my spoon, and any other food item I had on my plate into that creme because it was wickedly just...that...good. How can you go wrong with truffles and creme fraiche? You just can't. It's perfection. Perhaps some may beg to differ, but I thought the brunch at The Stanton was amazing. The food was good, the service quick and attentive, and the setting lovely. I would definitely return back for another round of brunch. Indeed, this girl can eat. :oD",3,0,3,Sandra L.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",107,48,2
3.0,6/1/2007,"Looking to try out the NYC food scene while visiting, a friend of mine took my girlfriend and I here for a night on the town. While this should be a review purely on the restaurant, I must add that the whole experience really started just heading there. Yes, I was basking in the glory of making it there in one piece and hassle free. And yes, I cabbed it too. Regardless, getting there was easy enough. The main entrance to the place is a bit understated but the space itself is nicely done. Its a tri-level space that definitely works the swank angle of contemporary restaurant design (yes, architecture talk... its an important part to the experience). Anyway, we got hooked up with one of the booths on the main floor and started off the night with some pretty good cocktails. The menu isn't quite so extensive but they do have some unique dishes that we hoped hit the spot. Winners of the night were defiintely the cuban ceviche and ravioli. Skip out on the french onion soup dumplings... inventive but not exactly all that. Service is decent. Overall, I'd reconsider having a full on meal here. Dishes are generally small and all things considering, its all pretty pricey. This place is probably better suited to grab some drinks (the upstairs bar is pretty cool) and maybe a plate to munch on.Drawbacks? T is for Tiny Trendy Tapas (good or bad is individual opinion). Has a fairly decent menu but with the prices to match. I'd shoot for something else if you're looking for a full on meal.",1,0,0,Jonny Bobby G.,"San Francisco, CA",183,164,9

4.0,4/17/2007,"I ate here last week with the girl I've been seeing and another couple and we were duly impressed with Stanton Social. The rooms (both upstairs and downstairs) are beautiful, crowded and well stocked with a good looking, well-heeled crowd. I was only slightly disappointed that we didn't get to sit upstairs in their front room which boasts these gorgeous painted glass panels which are featured on their website. As it was, we had a spacious banquette on the main floor and had both a lovely view of the room and easy access to the front door so that I could sneak out for a smoke as needed.It is a shared menu (which I happen to love) and my friends and I ordered:Sweet & Sour Chicken & Cashew Spring Rolls (EXCELLENT!)Maine Crab cake 'Corn Dogs' (EXCELLENT!)Kumamoto oysters (I don't do ""raw"" but my friends loved them)We also ordered two each of the following sliders:Kobe Beef Burgers BBQ Pulled Pork SandwichesRhode Island Style Lobster Rolls ...all of which were excellent but my favorite was the Pork. It was cooked and shredded to tender perfection in an absolutely delicious sweet and tangy BBQ sauce. The Kobe burgers were fantastic texture-wise but I have an extreme aversion to mustard and failed to see that these little burgers came dressed with that particular condiment.We paired the sliders (which were effectively the second round of appetizers) with a bowl of Essex Street Pickles from ""the pickle guy""  which were good and their Herb Dusted Frites with Chili Mayo which were the most delicious french fries I'd had in quite some time.For ""entrees"" we ordered their Fish & Chips which were served as individual portions of perfectly battered whitefish, affixed via tooth-pick atop what I would consider an expertly seasoned tater tot. These were good but were overshadowed by their Beef Wellington which was as good as any I've had anywhere. Grilled filet mignon with foie gras mousse and mushroom duxelles, wrapped in puff pastry. Heavenly!For dessert we had their ""Warm Doughnuts"" which were outstanding! Fresh from the fryer, round and dusted with granulated sugar, they would have been delicious enough on their own but they came paired with a raspberry puree, chocolate and caramel dipping sauces. The caramel was unreal!Yes this place is expensive and yes it is crowded. Make a reservation or be prepared to post up at the bar for an hour before being seated.

But if you are planning to go please take into consideration these tips:1) Plan Ahead!If you are going with a big group, please make a reservation in advance. Although the hostess may say that you can go upstairs and eat at the bar area, it does NOT work well with groups. I went there once with 7-8 people and attempted to eat at the bar tables. The tables were long and narrow and could not accommodate all the tapas plates, utensils, and drinks we had. It just became a mess. I find it ideal to go with about 4 people. You can try a good variety of food without being overwhelmed with too many dishes. 2) Order SmartMORE PLEASE!: Kobe Beef Sliders, Spicy Lobster Pasta, French Onion Soup Dumplings, Main Crab cake 'Corn Dogs'NOT BAD: Lobster Rolls, Braised Short Rib Soft Tacos NO THANKS: Wood Grilled Pizzetta (blah), The Stanton Social Beef Wellington (sounds better than it tastes)3) Don't forget Brunch!

And, yes, the douche bag quotient is high, but I had to check it out.The signature drink is amazingly smooth (green tea, orange vodka, honey, marmalade) and the follow-up rosemary tangerine cooler (infused vodka, tangerine/lemon juice) was solid as well. I've also heard the blood orange jalapeno margarita is off the chain. I'll try next time for sure. Our two dishes were great as well. The duck confit empanadas looked more like Asian spring rolls and were really pretty on the plate (and crispy in the mouth). The dipping sauce was fruity and the duck was crispy, though moist. A nice dish. The braised short rib tacos was a really fun dish---3 smalls bowls: white bean refried beans, manchego, homemade salsa; 4 flour tortillas; heaping bowl of shredded spare ribs. Mix to create your own tacos. Kind of an upscale spin on the sizzling fajitas from Chi-Chis. I have no real opinion of the staff. The bartender was courteous and fast, but not necessarily warm.

Next we had the pizzetta which was just ok. Not bad, but not as orgasmic as the rest of the meal. Along with the meal I had a delicious red - I liked the wine list a lot.Dessert was equally fantastic. We couldnt resist the chocolate sampler but I had also heard plenty about the warm donuts so we ordered both.

I would understand if it was a busy Saturday evening, but it was a Tuesday and there weren't many other tables in the restaurant.

5.0,8/13/2006,"The Stanton Social is an illustration of a beautiful design, from the decor to the service to the cuisine. I have had the pleasure of dining here twice now, once with one other diner and once with a large group.  Both visits were excellent, and I can't wait to return.   The interior of the restaurant is stunning.  The first floor dining area is full of deep, rich colors and beautiful textures, especially the lovely red tiled ramp that takes you from the entrance to the dining room.  The lights are attractive and date-worthy, and the dark wood furniture adds a contemporary feel.  Upstairs at the bar/lounge, the colors are lightened but no less rich in feeling.  The bar itself has a lovely green tiled counter top, and the delicate cherry blossom wall coverings are a beautiful backdrop against the linear leather furniture.  If Asian fusion were a decorating style, this would be it. The bar gets crowded, so if you don't want to stand cattle-style among your fellow drinkers, get there early.  It's well worth it.  The bartenders are friendly, attractive, and skilled.  The specialty cocktails are very good - I have had the Social Tea and the Pink Grapefruit Mint Martini, both delicious.  The food is wonderful, and I am one of those people who is kind of over of tapas-style dining.  If you feel the same way, imagine instead that you have been invited to a fabulous party or social event, and a top chef has prepared the most divine appetizers for you to taste.  The bonus is that you get to do this sitting down instead of standing.  You want to order a lot, because everything is very unique and tasty. For dinner, I have tried the following dishes:French Onion Soup Dumplings - all that they are cracked up to be and more.  When I describe them to people in conversation, I always hear, ""Wow"".  And they are even better than they sound.  Must must must have.Squid Lettuce Wraps - an interesting take on the chicken lettuce wraps served in contemporary Asian restaurants.  The smokiness of the squid pairs nicely with the cool lettuce.Warm Spinach Salad - really good, nice compliment to some of the heavier dishesRed Snapper Tacos - yummy, spicy fish in small, hard corn shells.  Mango salsa gives it a tropical flavor.Lobster Paella Cakes - YUM.  Delicious to look at and eat.  A mussel atop lobster atop a corn cake.  Kobe Beef Burgers - very good - a trio of sliders with great flavor.  A signature dish.Pizetta - just ok - thin crust pizza with tomatoes, mozzarella and basil.  Skip this and try something else.Wasabi-Pea Crusted Wild Salmon - delicious, with a very unique and kicky crust.  Moist fish.  Served with noodles.Frites - good, served with spicy mayo for dipping.  Edamame - very interesting - they are sauteed in spices which gives them a unique flavor, but a slightly wet texture due to the sauce - so slightly messier to eat than the traditional version.Haricot Verts - deliciously al dente green beans with citrus and cheese flavors. Desserts:Apple Empanadas - very good - small bites of apple goodness in a flaky crust, with a caramel dipping sauce.  Great for fall.Coffee Trio - incredible - tastes of three desserts using coffee as the ingredient (like your own mini Iron Chef experience), each more delicious than the last.Cookie Sampler - ok, some are better than others, and the novelty of seeing a mini Black & White cookie is fun, but other desserts here are better.Donuts - amazing!  Melt-in-your-Mouth Hot fresh ""donuts"" (larger than donut holes, but not cake-style with a hole)  with a trio of dipping sauces including chocolate and strawberry.  I was waiting in line for the bathroom and met two other women, and the three of us bonded over these.  Want to make your date swoon (and possibly see his or her ""sex-face"")?  Donuts.  Trust. The service is very good, although it is not really a space to linger - they have a lot of business and want to make sure they can accommodate their overflowing reservations.  However, we did not feel rushed at all - it was more that they had a team on hand to whisk away our plates and bring new ones almost simultaneously - not easy for a party of ten.  Anyway, after such a great experience, you are primed to go out and explore the LES with a smile on your face.",2,0,2,Liz S.,"Portland, OR",719,1061,884

Once you get to eating, that's where the real fun begins. It's all small plates, but from the selection we tried I'd say it's hard to really go wrong in any direction. That said, some must have items are the kobe mini burger, the lobster roll, and the french onion soup dumplings. This latter item is probably my favorite, they get it just right. There is simply no arguing with gooey cheese mixed with the trademark french onion broth, except this time served within a dumpling just waiting to burst in your mouth. Ohhhhh sooooo goood!The east west oysters are another great option, and having had my share of oysters, I was really happy with the presentation and freshness offered.Our Aussie waitress was perfect, very friendly and and very willing to offer up suggestions on what to eat, what cocktail to try, etc. She's a real hoot, and I'm guessing characteristic of the rest of the staff.Things do get pricey (with a few drinks at dinner, our meal was about $200 for 2 people), but IMHO it's completely worth every penny.",2,0,2,Nish N.,"San Francisco, CA",4706,1893,653

I didn't know what to expect, so it was quite a surprise. The dish was served on an escargot plate and the dumplings were made out onions and it was drizzled with melted cheese. It was delicious. Next we had the squid lettuce wraps. The squids were fresh and slightly flavored with a bit of kick. Then we had the lobster paella cakes! That was another creative dish I highly recommend! Spoonful of lobster paella were grilled into mini cakes and topped with a mussel. It looked and tasted great!! We then had the braised short rib tacos. Everything was served deconstructed, so you were able to make your own. I thought this dish was okay. Our last dish was the mini kobe beef burgers. Although they were delicious, tender and juicy, I wouldn't have known if they were real kobe beef or not. For dessert, we shared the apple em pandas and the coffee sampler. The apple em pandas were served with caramel dipping sauce. I definitely enjoyed the coffee trio better. It came with four different mini desserts. They were all heavenly.

I have to admit I was initially skeptical of the place because it seemed extremely trendy... but I was in for a nice surprise. I went with a group on a Sunday night when it was relatively uncrowded. Without a reservation, we were able to get a table upstairs (which lacks the loungey atmosphere of the trendy downstairs, but the privacy was a nice tradeoff). The potato pierogies, butternut squash ravioli, and paella cakes were my favorites. We got 8 dishes to share, and everything was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The waiter was very nice and for a small price increase, they were able to adjust each of our dishes so they included four of everything (so we could each have one). This would be a great place for a date also, and I plan on going back soon. Highly recommend it!!!  The only caveat is that I tried going back on a Friday night a week later, and the entrance was packed with preppy wanna-be socialites. I guess Friday night is when the place is in full swing for all the scenesters. Without a reservation, we were told the wait would be 1.5 hours... so we left and went somewhere else.

And if you have more than six people in your party, plan to order a couple orders of each item if you want everyone at the table to get a bite. My favorite items on the menu: potato pierogis were fabulous. A little crispy on the outside with creamy mashed potato inside and a smear of creme fraiche and caramelized onion on top. The french onion soup dumplings were OUT OF CONTROL. Exactly like a spoonful of melt-in-your-mouth onion soup buttoned up inside a wonton wrap. Explodes with flavor upon contact with your tongue. The red snapper tacos were adorable - pint-size, with a crispy shell and spicy, almost ceviche-like snapper stuffed inside. For larger dishes, the pork tenderloin with ancho glaze was tender and lots to pass around the table and the fig and blue cheese pizza was superb.
