4.0,4/21/2019,"Sat at the bar w some fellow humans on a Wednesday evening and were one of the last to leave.  Ordered 4 drinks and a Red Bull which came to about $80. Not surprised, this is Manhattan. Side note- DO NOT PARK on the street side, park on 6th ave instead. What I did appreciate most was the bouncer found my sunglasses that dropped when my jacket fell and gave them to the office.  Called the next day, whoever picked up asked me to describe the sunglasses and confirmed they were safe and sound. Stopped by and picked them up,  200Euros saved.",3,0,2,Swanky M.,"Manhattan, NY",3,45,19
3.0,4/9/2019,"Not too thrilled about here. It's like an artsy, theatrical basic Asian cuisine restaurant. It was a Monday evening, no sure how it is any other time or how many other seating areas there are. The area we sat at had some eerie pictures on the walls. The food is just okay. Not worth it in my opinion. Is it edible, yes. Is it somewhere you MUST go, absolutely not. Overrated but the service was still great and the drinks are good as well.",0,0,0,Chantel M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,26,9

3.0,3/25/2019,"Definitely a cool atmosphere and the vibes are great. I can say I wasn't crazy about the food though. I don't know if they were having an off night or what but I heard so many good things about this place. The food was one of them and the graffiti on the walls. The graffiti on the walls AMAZING... The food, not so much. I had the triple chili chicken. They give you enough food but when it's not that great it doesn't really matter. I would be willing to give this place a try again. Only because the atmosphere is so good and I'm assuming the kitchen just had an off night.",0,0,0,Tee G.,"South Plainfield, NJ",2,7,3
2.0,3/24/2019,"I came here because I was given a gift card which was expiring soon. The space was pretty nice, but they have no business charging as much as they do for anything on the menu.Everything we tried was average and nothing really stood out. The soup dumplings were very meh, the tempura rock shrimp (recommended by the waiter) left me wanting some sort of compliment to the small heap of shrimp that was plated, and the pork fried rice was indistinguishable from what you'd get for $4 at a neighborhood take out spot. I don't mind spending more for an elevated dish, but nothing about the quality of the ingredients or the dishes themselves warranted these prices.For a main, I had the Wok Charred Filet Mignon Cubes w/Broccoli and Cauliflower in Mongolian Sauce. For a main, which costed over $35, the portion was tiny and had barely any filet cubes. I'll say the cubes did taste good but again, the dish should have costed maybe $20-25 for the portion.With 2 people having 2 drinks each, the bill was $150. I paid with a $200 gift card and did not receive back any sort of credit for the $50 remaining from the card. The only reason this review is 2 stars is due to the fact that the wait staff was attentive and that I didn't actually have to spend my own money on the meal. I would not recommend this restaurant - just go elsewhere for a better experience at a cheaper price.",1,0,0,Brent L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,0
1.0,3/23/2019,"I am absolutely disgusted with the quality service received on the night of 3/22/19! I planned a birthday dinner for my younger brother and their poor customer service nearly ruined the experience. After waiting over a week for a response to a request for a private room (for 3/22 at 9PM) AND having to call on numerous occasions- I was FINALLY able to speak to someone on staff. I received a response to my email on the same day I requested my reservation for (almost two weeks prior!). Unfortunately, by the time I sent a request to finalize the reservation I,  belatedly, received a response at 9:07PM saying the space was no longer available. Of course, my party was already at the location. Now what could've just been written off as a clerical error or a simple miscommunication became a ridiculous ordeal. Zara (I believe that's what he said his name was- He spent too much time yelling at me over the phone for me to hear it well) dealt with my party in a manner that was absolutely abhorrent. He was interacting with customers that were already irate but he still felt it necessary to yell, antagonize, and BELITTLE the guests. I am sure the fact that Zara was speaking to young people of color, he thought it was okay to be so disrespectful but I was honestly appalled. Even on the phone with me (who was calm and not at the location) he was both nasty and condensing. I am so upset this was my brother's experience. This was one of his favorite restaurants and this incident makes him hesitant to revisit the venue. I hope Jue Lan can spend some time with their employees working on customer service. This should never be anyone's restaurant experience.",6,0,0,Nikki A.,"Williamsburg - South Side, Brooklyn, NY",8,4,0

3.0,3/16/2019,Mediocre. The place was ok. The food was average. We has about 6 dish and none of them were memorable.

4.0,3/13/2019,"I just recently threw my boyfriend a surprise dinner party here. I invited 10 guest with a fixed menu and open bar for everyone. I got in contact with peter to schedule the dinner in advance and I had to put down a deposit to make sure everything was set for that Saturday night. I booked this party 2 months in advance and a week before the party I called to make sure everything was set. Now, 2 days before I spoke to a woman named Tiana on the phone to make sure that when my guests arrived if could please be sat early since it WAS a surprise. She WAS very understanding on the phone and told me to make sure they arrived before 730 to get sat. I made sure the guest were going be on time & my boyfriend & I were on our way. When I walked inside to surprise him, do you think everything was in order ? NO!!! Everyone in the party was standing around and I let out the shittest ""Surprise"" ever! I asked for the table of 10 that I made sure to have in advance and Tiana is looking at me like she doesn't know wth to do. ""Well we can't sit you until the WHOLE party is here""  I was like no we need to be seated now because we spoke on the phone and you assured me that everything will be in order. When she finally spoke to the other hosts, we were sat. Anyway, The atmosphere was definitely beautiful, the music was really good from throwbacks to modern and the table was candle lit style. I honestly wish I could remember our servers name but he was so awesome!!!! He took real good care of us & once someone was half way down with their drink he was right on it.

I also had the Frosè and the Shanghai mule. The drinks tasted spot on and my brother commented that they were also quite strong.

1.0,3/5/2019,"Food was cold. Veggie fried rice had almost no veggies, mostly bland rice that was not properly stir fried - lots of the rice was still white and lumped together. Tasteless - one of the worst fried rice I've ever had. ""Wok Tossed Asian Greens"" had almost no Asian greens. Mostly vegs such as carrots, tomatoes, cauliflower.

4.0,2/14/2019,"No Phillip's Chow, came here with hubby a day before valentines day because I had to work vday. We had reservations but was running late, we called ahead and they told us it's ok. We entered the building and was immediately seated. At that point, there were a fair amount of people there, definitely busy. I immediately come to yelp as I normally do to look at pics of food to see what looks good and what's recommended. I settled on the house special fried rice and broccoli, I'm not a big meat eater. Hubby ordered crispy beef, that wasn't crispy at all, and his own order of house special fried rice, the food was ok, It was no phillips, It taste like regular chinese food. I was trying to take it easy on hubby but since it was Valentine's day I wanted to have a little fun so I ordered a couple drinks, the frozen dusse was really good I think it was $19 or $20, then I ordered the lychee martini I think not was $17 that was pretty strong. I wanted to try the white chocolate bomb for dessert but there was no more of the casing for it, the last one was served already and it takes a while to make them, like next day. My overall experience was cool, I would only go back to try the desert that I missed out on. We did get to try the creme brulee for dessert it was pretty good but it was too sweet for me. Oh yeah they played urban music all night, by the decor you would think it was an Italian restaurant not a chinese one.  The crowd was mixed from urban to professionals.",0,0,1,Kerry L.,"Brooklyn, NY",19,82,302

4.0,2/9/2019,"Jue Lan Club is cool, but I don't really see what the hype is about. I came to celebrate a birthday and other than the infamous Andy Warhol quote, I wasn't really impressed. I like to think of this place as an expensive Chinese spot with HUGE shrimps. I wasn't really a fan of the vibe in there, I wish it was a bit more lively.I can say, however, the food is filling and my main dish was good. The portions are perfect and you're sure to leave full and you might even have some left overs! Twin of my friends had sent their dishes back and just opted into getting the shrimp.I requested shrimp fried rice and thought it was a personal plate as a substitution for my white rice, but it was for the table which was cool because we still got both rices.One thing I absolutely LOVED was the Dusse drink they had, I could certainly see myself stopping in and sitting at the bar just for this drink.I'm not too sure if I would give Jue Lan another try.",1,0,1,Sheira C.,"Manhattan, NY",50,42,40

The. Oysters. No reason that should happen. Two people at the table, the apps should come out together & cooked food before raw food  doesn't make sense. We ordered our main course and that came relatively quickly. As we were enjoying our beverages several bussers came by to clear our table, within 2 mins of each other. Was a bit excessive. Other than that the food and our server Delores was great.

4.0,1/29/2019,2019 Winter NYC Restaurant Week! Came here during Restuarant week and after looking through restaurant thought they had the best lunch value. Most places only have 2 courses for $26 while they have 3. The ambiance is very nice upon walking in. Will definitely be back during the nice weather months because they have an outdoor spot as well. Interestingly decorated.  They usually have a lunch special aside from restaurant week for 19.99. Definitely something to explore.The food was great. I came with a friend and we shared . For apps we had the tempura shrimp which was great. For entrees we ordered the beef and broccoli and the miso glazed salmon . This came with rice and we got vegetable fried rice. The food was flavorable and a good size. We were stuffed! However we still had dessert. The creme brulee with pecan cookies was delish. Will definitely be back! Great experience.

4.0,1/5/2019,"This was my first time at the daydream brunch here, Sunday May 20th. We were a party of 5 and had 3:00 reservations which is when it opens. We were seated about 15 min later. We booked the main lime light room which was smaller than I expected but was fine and every table was sold. We were given info via email prior to the reservation. This room has a $100 minimum spend limit PER person at the table. They add a 20% gratuity and tax on top of that. They offer bottle service but we found it more cost efficient to purchase pitchers of white sangria and frozen rose ($95 per pitcher) and we all had apps as our food off the menu. No one dances till about 430ish (when people have already had a few drinks). Our waitress had short wavy blonde hair (didn't get her name) but she was absolutely awesome! Gave us different suggestions as to what types of drinks we can order and told us when we met our quota instead of just allowing it to go over and spend extra money.

We were running late, but that did not really matter as the place was pretty empty and we were seated right away. - This was surprising, since I was reading reviews that state that this place gets packed on Saturday nights. I was hungry, so I decided to skip on the appetizers and go straight for the entrees. I had the Beijing chicken with a side of pork fried rice. My boyfriend ordered the crispy beef with a side of potatoes. The food came out in like ten minutes; I should of known that was a bad sign. The food definitely tasted as if it had been sitting in the kitchen and just reheated. The sauce on the Beijing chicken tasted like a gel type slime, rather than a sauce. We thought that we knew what to expect when we ordered the entrees because I ordered the same thing from Phillipes and Tao before, and loved it. Jue Lan's was a disaster; I literally had to step away from the table, as I was getting nauseous!Aside from the food , my boyfriend told two different servers and our waiter that it was my birthday; it got to the point that it was not a secret anymore and he was just trying to get someone to bring out a dessert with a simple ""Happy birthday"" written on the plate for me. I noticed the staff sang happy birthday songs three times while I was there; I do not know how they choose who they sing happy birthday to, but that was so not cool. We asked for the bill, as I was nauseous and annoyed... I wanted to get out of that place ASAP! You would think that after spending over $200 (on just two people), that you would at least get some common courtesy.Jue Lan Club LACKS everything that I believe a successful business should have. Please improve the staff and operation of this business. ""Jue Lan Club"" is just a name... it does not live up to the hype. Get better servers and waiters... better security.

Stumbling to this place just before lunch time, my guest and I were able to enjoy a three course pre fixed menu. Twenty dollars pp for a three course me? NOT BAD AT ALL. I went with the Pan Fried Pork & Chive Dumplings which were easily a 5/5. For my entree I had the Flank Steak, ""Chinochurri""Sauce with Fingerling Potatoes.

I also had the pleasure, and I say that because it was just that good, of having some of the chicken satay with peanut sauce, Beijing Chicken, and Lo Mein - all exquisite in flavor, taste and presentation!

Most unique dumpling I've had in a while. The lettuce wraps and the walnut chicken were super yum as well. Drinks were amazing. Had the lychee martini and the frose. Both delicious drinks. The frose reminded me of a daiquiri and it was fabulous. The Peking duck wraps were a fun treat. The pancakes were well made. Let's also not forget about those yummy oxtail baos. Beginning to drool when I think of the food.  I enjoyed the shrimp lo mein, the fish, chicken fried rice and the bok Choy. The filet mignon was so flavorful and cooked the perfection.

5.0,9/7/2018,"Love the lunch special . I came on a weekday for a biz lunch & I was pleasantly surprised. They have a very appealing lunch special for only $19.99 ! My only complaint was simply that the shrimp satay was included  we had THREE orders , yes , THREE orders, at $20 an order . Totally worth it . #Hype had the oxtail bao buns - lots of flavor and a pleasant plate. The edamame dumplings were underwhelming. The shrimp rice noodles were fantastic , full of flavor and had plenty of shrimp . We sat outside, on a terribly hot day (our choice) & the umbrellas did a great job . There is a gym next door & plenty of people watching to enjoy . Spoiler : The restaurant is apart of a remodeled church , that shares its space with a gym .

2.0,7/25/2018,"Chose Jue Lan on the basis of an interesting restaurant week menu.  We opted for lunch and found ourselves in what is probably the bar, where tales are set  only as the few patrons wander in.  Service is by bartender, host, table setter, and menu director...all in one.  A visit to the restrooms afforded a view of other, more appropriate dining rooms, but where we were seated was decidedly un-pretty and dark.  The service was coarse, inefficient,  and not what we expected on the basis of their boastful ads.The food, although generous, was not at all unusual, and was of the old timey Chinese style.  To top off a rather dismal meal, our check was inflated and required some repeated addition to get a correct statement.

They had several busboys in the room...but rarely saw a waiter.  When they turned on the air ... it felt like Hurricane Sandy rolled in... seriously... candles blew out and my hair went sideways. 75% of men were wearing hats or hoodies.

4.0,3/25/2018,"What a great time !! If you're looking for a party brunch , look no further! We had such a fun time, the music was good the food was good and once everything was in order the service was good too. The reason I gave 4 instead of 5 is because when we first got there it kicked off to a bad start. We were a party of 20 people for a birthday brunch. Our reservation was for 2:15 but since our dj for the dj room was running late ,we couldn't be seated by anyone else , so we needed to wait until 2:50 to be seated. This a huge party just waiting around the entrance , so that was annoying. Also, since they can only run two cards in their system we were having a tough time figuring out how people would pay if not everyone has cash and we couldn't be seated until that was settled.  Thank goodness for Venmo. Finally around 3 we were seated and the dj was playing old school hip hop and rap for like an hour and then finally it was a mix of everything around 4 pm and that's when the place started to fill up and it really felt like a clubby party brunch. (We were the only ones there at 3) our waitress, I believe her name was Janell , but blonde hair and short was very nice and explained everything to us and was accommodating for those who did not want to drink. If you're getting unlimited drinks and entree it's 55$ without drinks it is 35$.  Considering tip and tax and any additional things you're looking at 75$-85$ pp.The food was delicious , and was brought out in good timing. The white sangria was amazinggggg I stuck with that for the rest of the day. We added a birthday special for 26$ , we got the big birthday sign, the spaceman dancing and the saxophone player playing with some dessert for the birthday girl and of course confetti which made everything so much better!It's definitely a clubby feel, so feel free to dress up in heels and a cute dress! Ps* water is 8$ for the big bottle We had an amazing time and we cannot wait to come back for a party brunch in the dj room.

When she finally received her ribs..they were damn near without meat..just honey  glazed bones. NYC is infamous for having tons of really good Asian  restaurants...so for this restaurant to not come with its A game.. Although they have prices that mimic other places such as Tao or Buddakan..their portion sizes come no where near close.  The speciality rice was truly bland and lacked lobster.

1.0,12/18/2017,"Hi I am reaching out to you to discuss an incident that occurred inside of your restaurant  Jue Lan yesterday, December 17. I made reservation for my birthday brunch from the hours of 3-8. I arrived to the location at 4:45 and we were seated at 6:00pm. It was specified in the email that we would be able to have our table the entire night along with a presentation. Upon receiving the bill I asked what happened to the presentation because I was really looking forward to it, that is the primary reason I selected this establishment to have my brunch. I asked to speak to a manager (Dara Joon) who was unapologetic and stated that we came late, too bad the entertainment packed up already and left. I asked if he would like to see the email I received. He replied no, stated I should have told them and walked away. I followed him outside the room trying to explain my frustration and he stated in front of myself and security ""Your Trash, don't come back here"" he walked off and then came again to my face, invading my person space and yelled a second time calling me trash which Made me lose my mind. I am sure this is not the type of training and hospitality that you provide your staff with dealing with clients. This is very disappointing, disgusting and unacceptable. A birthday is suppose to be a special memory shared amongst family and friends. For me to get such harsh treatment from a manager from up an alleged upscale restaurant is dishearten.

I never been to a brunch that doesn't do brunch TWO hours before it actually ends... hmmm maybe because they wanted you to spend MORE money. They had the nerve to seat us upstairs in like the quiet section with NO music. If I wanted to have fine dining believe me it def wouldn't be here. I'd go to Peter Luger. I wanted the brunch experience with the music & ppl dancing since it was MY bday celebration. So guess what I walked out of the table with my friends.

We didn't get 3 of the items we ordered and when I asked the waiter where my food was (everyone else at the table got theirs) he said the bus boy shouted out my order so it was my fault I didn't get it. At a table of 10 and music blasting like we're at the club, you would think he would go around the table to make sure. So instead of the waiter apologizing and going to get my food, he just kept saying it was fault I didn't get my food. 4. I order the fried rice with lobster, shrimp and chicken, which was awful! There was one shrimp, the chicken was sliced so thin and there was no lobster. And everything was dry. It was very disappointing. 5.

But a friend chose this spot for her bday dinner and I didn't want to be THAT yelp Elite friend who asks ""Umm, did you see the reviews tho?""  First things first, I was carded coming into this restaurant. Yes, carded. And while I appreciate the reaffirming that black don't crack, and my great genes are still poppin, last thing I expected was being carded to enter a restaurant. It was a Sunday night and they had the music bumping, and playing good music too. It felt almost like a club, although I never saw a DJ, so maybe it was a playlist. I will admit that the ambience was very nice, and had the rest of the evening not been so eh, I would've been tempted to go back again. Food: For appetizer, I had the rock shrimp tempura. This was pretty good, similar to other rock shrimp tempura, covered in a creamy and slightly spicy sauce. It is a big portion so I would definitely recommend splitting it with someone unless you're really hungry. Someone else has the wontons and said they were great! For entree, I went with the salmon which was very underwhelming. To start, my menu listed the salmon without sides , but the person next to me had a menu that mentioned broccoli and snowpeas. Our waiter had no explanation as to why my menu was different. But, when the salmon came out, there was no broccoli or snow peas, instead it was mushrooms and chopped cucumbers. Super annoying to not get what's advertised on the menu. I did try the sweet and sour chicken from someone else and it was delicious. The vegetable fried rice is also good. I had one drink the whole night because it was super strong (Henny sidecar), but definitely worth the price.  I should also mention that our server was just bad. Took forever to check on us. Took forever to bring out to go boxes. Took forever to bring us the check (we asked at least twice). Had he been better, we would've been gone at least 30mins sooner.

The experience was decent, it was pretty dark in there which made it feel a lot less like brunch and more like dinner. The DJ played a nice mix of music and it added to the experience.

Let me say first that this is the fourth or fifth time we've eaten here, and the food has always been good and interesting as well. Let me say too that this is the first time I've been moved to write a review about any restaurant. When things are good you forget, and when things are just okay you let it go too. You have to be pretty disappointed to feel the need to write a review. Since I'm writing this I guess I was pretty disappointed.Tonight things just didn't go so well. The first thing my date noticed was that the place seemed ""skanky"". I can't really say I know what that means, nor that I noticed anything unusual. But my date is cuter than most so I tend to pay attention to her more than the surroundings.Several items on the menu were unavailable. Our server let us know up front, which is good, but at seven on a Saturday evening one would think the cupboard would not yet be bare. We found other things we liked and ordered. Our wine and appetizer were nicely served and we enjoyed them. The place wasn't full and we couldn't hear the conversations at the other tables, but could hear ourselves without shouting. For some reason about this time the staff turned up the volume of the music playing over the speakers.....loud; I guess it was to amuse themselves since no one asked for louder music. I asked that it be returned to its former volume and was accommodated soon after. Honestly if I'd wanted to go to a rock concert that would have been fine, but we came here to dine and have pleasant conversation in a normal voice. Most restaurants would do well to remember that.Plates were brought for the next course but we were then told that what we ordered as a main dish was not available. So we ordered another dish, which was nice, but it really was a little late to tell us none of our first choice was left, especially, as I said before, early on a Saturday evening. We don't usually have dessert but tonight was different, and my date ordered tea with a slice of cheesecake. Again the dessert was fine. But the tea was tepid at most and we asked that it be heated. It left but didn't come back.  After a while we asked three different staff members, including a manager, for the tea before it showed up. I don't like to carp, about service especially, and I'm not carping about it now. I think though it is clear that the management and not the staff are responsible for the ambiance, availability of dishes, and coordination of service needed to operate a restaurant smoothly.

Then they began to bring out appetizers one by one 4-5 small pieces for every 10 people so we were all uncomfortable to eat anything because there wasn't enough.

The food was kind of eh in my opinion and the outdoor space did not seem like it was fully equipped to host outdoor dining. We all ordered the pre fix lunch menu where we tried:Edamame Dumpling: The only reason I can think of at this point to come back.You think you know but you have no idea. I will try anything with truffle oil so I'm glad I tried this. The inside of the dumpling is a smooth and creamy edamame filling that is seriously amazing. MUST TRY.Chicken Lettuce Wraps:These were a hit at the table but not my fav.Large pieces of romaine with a side of ground chicken and veggies.Veggie Spring Rolls:Good, nothing special.Soy sauce they served with it was not low sodium, which was weird for this location (#lowfateverythig). So beware. Green Prawns:Not what I was expecting. The prawns almost looked like pasta. The ""green"" taste was spicy but very ""Green"" tasting which just confused me. The whole flavor of the dish was weird. The dish also came with cashews which I was not aware of so that was slightly annoying.Beef and Broccoli:I'm sure this dish named something else but I can't remember. The meat was very tender which was nice but the broccoli was not as cooked as I would have liked. Again, nothing special about this dish other than a fancy version of beef and broccoli using a better grade of meat. Both dishes were paired with fried rice that really saved me in terms of being satiated. Also, the pre fix menu you see online is different than what is presented at the restaurant.Location:So this place is very cute and as my friend said ""gives you a I'm eating on 5th and live on Madison"" feel. With that being said, I would bring out of towners here if they have never been to NYC and everything fascinates them. The location is cute and chic but if you are going to have outdoor seating, maybe have enough umbrellas for all the tables. Also, at one point they lit torches and you could smell the fumes, like really bad. Not sure if that's a common complaint but I think they need to do something about that.I personally am not a fan (of at least the lunch pre fixe) but I would say it's worth a try for those who have always wanted to try it.",1,0,2,Tash B.,"Brooklyn, NY",178,174,65

5.0,7/14/2017,"If you're looking for a place to eat high end Chinese food, then this is definitely the place. Their bow buns are so savory. It was the first item that caught my menu and I had to try it. I was spot on! I asked the waiter for a recommendation and he suggested the pickled jalapeno steak. I'm not a big fan of spicy food but he convinced me that it was a fan favorite, so I went for it. Surpisingly enough, I was astounded by the rich flavor of the steak! It was amazing!

1.0,6/17/2017,AVOID AVOID AVOID!  Wow was this place bad! I haven't been to a place this bad in YEARS.  First I got a midnight mojito it was supposed to be a normal mojito with muddled blueberry. The whole drink came out a dark red color - tasted like a cran vodka - no other flavors. Idk how you can call that a mojito. My husband got the shangai mule which was supposed to have ginger and be a mule with pineapple and ginger and jam in it. What he got was a pineapple vodka. And these drinks were $16? I love a good cocktail and don't think $16 is that bad but for something that is at least made per the menu?? The food - just as bad. We got the lobster spring rolls - tasted like a veggie spring roll. I had to open them up to even see if there was lobster - there was it was TINY and horribly overcooked. The dish didn't showcase the lobster at all. For mains we got the salt and pepper shrimp and the tempura steak. The steak was weirdly soft and served with roasted potatoes with no flavor. The salt and pepper shrimp was so dry I could only manage to get down half. I know it's not a juicy dish but have had it at reputable restaurants and in Asia and this was BONE DRY.  The bus boy also touched the food as he served which I don't appreciate as a germophobe.   The space is cool and wish a good restaurant was here.  Overall the drinks and food were deplorable and couldn't recommend to anyone.UPDATE: my husband was sick all night from the food.

I can say my service was great and the music  great as well.  The bellinis had way to much nectar and not enough champagne. But hey they were unlimited so no big deal right. My appetizer, crystal shrimp dumplings  followed shortly and tasted fine nothing special but still very good. Then came the main course, the mongolian beef and my date had the salmon. When I say this was the most bland and lackluster food I have have ever had. It tasted like the food was cooked then a  glaze was poured on topped that what lacked in flavor  over endowed with salt. I could have stayed home and order take out saved 80% of my money and enjoyed 100% of my food.  I filled up on the broccoli  and when did eat some beef or salmon at least it was moist.  I would only return for the music not the food expensive and tasteless.",0,0,0,Leneika S.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,0

Our server seemed bothered anytime we ordered drinks or asked about the menu.

1.0,5/15/2017,"Back in the daze of my partying insanity in the city,there was a notorious club called The Limelight. It was in an abandoned church with pews and all. Fast forward to the present and it has become an eatery called Jue Lan Club. My good friend Jeffrey and I went there for our first try of their cuisine. I will go into more detail soon,but,will sum up their food with one word....BORING. I had deviled eggs with cold lobster appetizer,which was the only dish that tasted like its description. Jeffrey ordered chicken satay. The meat on the skewers was PINK and had the texture of cooked plastic and had NO flavor at all. You would never had known it was chicken. He complained about the dish and the nice waiter said we didn't have to pay and would switch out the dish,so, Jeffrey ordered the beef satay. Surprise!! The beef looked and  blandly tasted like the chicken. He ordered fried rice and short ribs and both tasted like the   Chef didn't like cooking with any spices. I read in Yelp how people were raving about  the bone marrow dumplings,so,I ordered them. Bone marrow has a distinct flavor to it that makes my mouth water. These made my mouth crave water. At least the Gold Rush drink was decent. This place would do better reverting back to a church and praying for forgiveness for delivering such poor quality food. Jeffrey said this was The Worst meal he has ever eaten and that it was a travesty to allow people to be served such swill. PS. The water was superb!!",13,2,0,Nathan O.,"Santa Monica, CA",46,28,84

They do hold an identification & credit card, you must spend $100 per person, we had three people, this included food & drinks, once you're at the table it's basically your table for the entire night, as long as you keep ordering. We actually ordered lunch, instead of the brunch items, the food was very good! Especially the rock tempura shrimp, and chicken dumplings, we also ordered the filet mignon, which was a little salty, but good, I would actually order the shrimp as an entree next time, my friend ordered that, and it was delicious. Around 4:30-5 is when the party really starts, it was packed, music was great! They played a lot of old school hip hop, also new, and a variety of top 40. They have a guy with a light up saxophone who comes around the room playing it to whatever the DJ is playing. They have dancers, and they also give out foam light up sticks, it's a real party atmosphere early in the day. We were celebrating my best friends bday, and when they brought out the cake, they really did it up, confetti, signs, the whole nine, they also did the same when the bottle came out, she really had a blast! Only thing...drinks are very expensive! The bill for three girls was over $600! Which didn't include the bottle which was ordered after the bill was paid for.

2.0,3/19/2017,"Update* went back and it was horrible. The service is really what made it 2 stars. The food this time was incredibly salty and basically inedible. We got a bottle of champagne at the end which was about 120 (pretty basic price) which drove up price. Again the service was horrible. We had to find our server and he forgot a few things. We were so annoyed by the end, we handed him credit card to go without looking. Well that came back quick, but missing the bill.  Had to find one of bus boys to get the bill and 20% gratuity had been added. For 3 people. Seriously and it was obvious that the server was trying to get more of a tip by not including the bill. Glad I asked and sorry to say I won't be back to this establishment. It gets 2 stars for actually being tasty the first time but to have someone try to rip you off? Since when do they include gratuity to a table of 3? Great food. Very similar to chows with many of their dishes, but without the exorbitant prices. We had the satay, lobster spring rolls, spicy shrimp, edamame dumplings, oxtail buns, fillet mignon, and the chocolate mousse dessert. Wait was pretty awful, but our friends did arrive late so we ended up waiting 45 min after reservation. There really was nowhere to hang out, but had it been warmer there's a huge outdoor space that could've accommodated that. Satay was close to mr chows but not quite there. They had more things on the menu though like the spring rolls and buns. I wasn't a fan of the edamame dumplings. It was a purée and kind of felt really mushy so maybe it was just that order. Service was good- just seemed like they were stressed and a little understaffed but it's not like we really had to track down anyone to get served.

4.0,2/24/2017,"It is located at the Limelight, and the entrance is on the 20th street, easy to spot with nicely lit arch shining warmly in the dull, cold Winter evening. It was quite picturesque. At first, I was not 100% sure if this was it, but they had a sign right next to the lit arch to ensure we are at the right entrance. Inside the arch was a large outdoor space, equipped with an outdoor bar. It was not in use, since it is the Winter time and the ground was covered in light snow. They had stacks of chairs and tables on the corner, I can only imagine how awesome this space would be during the warm months...The main dining room was a nice size, and I loved the decor. It had some Chinese elements to it, mixed with some speakeasy era feel from many moons ago. It had table seating in the middle. The table seating was sandwiched by booth seating on both side. They have more dining space on the second floor, so I went to check them out. The upstairs is not a one, large dining room, but separated into several smaller rooms. I felt like each room had a bit of different theme, mood and atmosphere.We had several drinks, and they were all very good, strong, and tasty. For food, we had Braised Oxtail Sloppy Bao Buns, Wok Charred Filet Mignon Tips with Broccoli, Kung Pao Chicken, and Infamous Chocolate Mousse for dessert. It was all very good, surprisingly good. We were very happy with our choices on drinks and food. Overall, we had a good time. The service was great, as we were the only customers in the main dining room (it was a very cold, crappy Winter day outside). The servers seemed a bit bored with not much to do... but they took a good care of us, our water was always filled, we didn't have to ask for anything as they were always around, checking on us or our table. The food had good portion, except for the dessert, and we really liked the flavor of them all. The choice of music was interesting. They started off with some nightclub-type music, mostly Kanye and Jay Z, really super loud which I did NOT enjoy. Then, about midway through, they all of a sudden changed to 80's music, which was much better than listening to Kanye (sorry if you are a fan of Kanye). It is not your normal Chinese restaurant.

I cannot be the judge of their food because I didn't eat anything but 4 people from our group did eat and said the food wasn't bad.I will say this though! Their service was horrible. The only attentive person here was one of our servers Andres, He was accommodating as to what drink to get (I got the old fashioned) & He offered to switch it up if I didn't like it which I appreciate. Thank you. (Andres was good so I'll give credit where it's due)The Drinks took longer than the food to come out. One girl in our group ordered a beer and guess what? It NEVER made it to our table. My drink took maybe a good 30 minutes to be brought out, and when I asked what took so long, the answer was ""Its a big group of you"" umm.. besides OUR Big group there was 1 other group of 4 so I don't see how a few drinks would take so long. A couple from our group ordered chicken and broccoli (which they ended up having to tell them they don't want it anymore because they brought the rice first and after another 40 minutes the chicken and broccoli was said to be done shortly.. If the rice was eaten 40 minutes prior, how do they expect for you to eat the chicken and broccoli? Separate?

3.0,2/16/2017,"Went for a random dinner with a large group.  We shared multiple appetizers, main dishes, and dessert.  First comment that will stand out is concerning the bathrooms at this establishment.  The decor and concept behind the restaurant - very cool, lots of history, etc.  BUT the managers need to address the issue of the bathroom smell.  Before my meal, when I went to go wash my hands, as soon as I stepped into the bathroom, the stench of urine burned into my memory.  To match the upscale Chinese food vibe of this place - they need to definitely freshen up the bathroom with odor removers or incense.  Their napkins to dry your hands after using the bathrooms are super fancy, but the overall smell of the bathroom itself - reminded me of Penn Station's elevator, which usually always smells like urine.  Moving on, the appetizers - a variety came out.  Coconut shrimp, chicken satay skewers, Thai-inspired chicken lettuce wraps, edamame shumai, egg rolls, and crispy wontons.  The stand-out dishes out of the appetizers had to be the edamame shumai!  I was excited chunks of edamame wrapped and steamed in rice paper, but what I found surprising in my mouth - was a creamy and perfectly seasoned edamame mash that went so well with the rice crepe.  The wonton was almost like a beef ball wrapped in wonton paper, fried, and drenched in sweet chili sauce.  The chicken satay were my least favorite because the peanut sauce tasted a little too creamy/dairy for me.  I am not sure what ingredient was added to make the dish taste cheesy, but I was not feeling the sauce which covered the hot-pink colored chicken skewer.  The rest of the appetizers were not very impressionable. For mains - I was able to taste the Peking duck, Seafood noodles (shanghai style?), chicken fried rice, & filet mignon & broccoli.  Filet mignon was tender and cooked medium.  The other two carbohydrate dishes were okay - the rice was too soggy and did not taste like a fried rice.  The seafood in the noodles dish was not very fresh - I didn't want to go back for seconds.  The only memorable dish was the Peking duck. The wrap was special.  Very chewy, thinly rolled, and complimented the crispy, fatty duck. Dessert - the ice cream with cookie crumble was delicious!  The matcha green tea croissant was okay - the matcha flavor did not come through as strongly as I like.  It just seemed like some green food coloring and the croissant was not as buttery and flaky. Overall - it was an okay culinary experience.  The dining experience was better - sharing memories and experiences with random people was fun!",1,0,0,Hannah L.,"New York, NY",74,179,97

3.0,2/13/2017,"We arrived at Jue Lan Club thrilled with the atmosphere and excited for our meal.  All went downhill from here.  Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but there are other places in NYC that you can get just as good of a meal and also stellar service. With these prices, you hope to have top service and this was anything but. We had a waiter that gave us our drinks AFTER our appetizers were finished, although we ordered them even before our appetizers. And after we received our food, he never once checked in to see how we were doing or if he could get us anything else. Our water glasses were also empty for the majority of our meal and one of our dishes was ice cold. We couldn't even get the waiter's attention to fix any of this. We left highly disappointed and expressed our discontent with the hostess.  She was great, attentive and understanding, and even offered us a drink on the house for the inconvenience.  After this, the manager was very nice, came over and apologized and said that he was going to see what he could do. We figured that he would try to correct the situation, but to our surprise, he brought the waiter down to apologize to us. Not only was this extremely unprofessional, but it was VERY uncomfortable for everyone involved. I have never experienced anything like this in a restaurant ever, and I would say that this is a horrible way to mend a situation with disappointed customers.They're also hiding this review, which is just bizarre and seems like a cover up.",1,0,0,Carly M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,17,0

Once seated, we placed our orders and the apps came out right away, but we had to wait about 30 minutes for the entrees. Meanwhile, dirty dishes remained on our table and no one ever came by to check on us. It wasn't until we went and got the manager, who had been walking around all night, that someone came and cleared the table. Oh. Forgot to mention that we ordered from the Restaurant Week menu -- so maybe that's the reason for the poor service. As a consolation, the manager brought over cake and sparklers for my birthday.

Arrived at 9pm (on time) for the event and our server took about 30 minutes to greet us. Had to chase down a server anytime we needed something because they were no where to be found. Our appetizers came out later than other tables who sat down after us and my appetizer came out after everyone at my table and they had already received and ate theirs. Our individual plates came out family style (not promised) and no one received what they ordered. We all never got our dessert. When I approached our server to inform them about our poor service, he just ignored everything I said, replied ""you have a nice night"", and walked away. I have never felt so disrespected in my life. On top of it all, that same server who ignored my complaints then handed us a bill solely for gratuity of over $300. When we purchased our tickets originally, we were never told that a mandatory gratuity would be tacked onto it the day of. First off, we were told it was a flat rate.

Once I got the drink, the bartender let me know that it was reserved for a private party and to go to the bar upstairs. Tried to go to the bar upstairs and it happened to also be reserved. Standing in a restaurant with a drink in hand is super awkward so i went to the dining room and waited for friends at our table. No one that was working there knew what was going on.Cocktails were OK, the old fashioned wasn't great but tequila drinks were good. The food on the other hand was absolutely horrible and everything was served at room temperature or cold. The dumplings had a horrible after taste and tasted stale (they were definitely pan fried ahead of time), the noodles were all stuck together and had no flavor, the meat/broccoli dish had way too much (salty) sauce, the short rib in the bao buns was too chewy to eat/the bun was cold, and the the ceviche was SO fishy. The rock shrimp was the only thing we enjoyed.The service was also bad. We had to track down our waiter anytime we needed something. They forgot 2 dishes (which we didn't even bother asking for after tasting a few things), and they also kept trying to bring us food that wasn't ours. I'm thinking the double holiday party was throwing them off a bit, but it is not an excuse for such a horrible experience at a high price tag.

When I walked in to meet my friend, we were seated right away. And funny enough at that time they were filming! Never saw the show - but the Real Housewives of NY were filming. We sat right behind the camera crew and the actresses which was pretty awesome. That night we were having a dinner and a show! My friend and I decided to go halfsies on the dishes and split a bunch of items from the menu. We started off with their Crispy Chicken Wontons which were a great start to our meal. They were very crispy and loved the sauce that came with it. It had enough of the crunch factor combined with flavorful chicken. We also had their Pork and Chive dumplings which were pretty standard and did the job. As for the entree, we split the Beef Rib-eye with Broccoli in a Mongolian sauce which was pretty good. The beef was tender and a hearty finish to our meal. We put in for a side order of Veggie Fried Rice which was also a nice accompaniment. It's safe to say that we were full at the end of the meal and the waiter was even nice enough to give us Chocolate and Coconut Truffles complimentary. It was very kind.The staff was very attentive despite the commotion of the Real Housewives of NY.

4.0,12/3/2016,"Came here for dinner with my boyfriend on a Friday night. We made a reservation for 7:30, but its a large space and there were plenty of open tables. However, the place had pretty much filled up by the time we left a little over an hour later. Jue Lan Club (JLC) is located in an old church and has unique gothic interiors. Its got a fun ambiance with 80s and 90s pop music playing. I was happy to be seated in the velvet plush round booth. The service was on point. My water glass was never empty and the bus boys constantly made their rounds to refill water or to clear plates. The food also arrived exceptionally fast. Granted, we mostly ordered shared dishes, but I was pleasantly surprised how soon our food arrived after we ordered. We shared the lobster spring roll, glazed spare ribs, rock shrimp tempura and lobster fried rice. My favorite dish out of those four was the spare ribs; the meat super tender and falling off the bone. The sauce was also delicious a perfect balance of salty and sweet. We also enjoyed rock shrimp tempura. They had a bit of a kick due to the chipotle mayo,  which was a welcome addition to the flavor. The lobster spring rolls were crunchy and very tasty and the lobster fried rice in addition to lobster pieces had tiny diced asparagus mixed in with it. The only criticism I have of those two dishes is that if the menu hadn't said there was lobster in them, I wouldn't have realized it. They were very good in flavor but didn't have anything that would separated them from standard rice dishes or spring roll appetizers. While a bit on the pricy side, JLC has good food with flavor. The drinks are good and the cocktail menu has a wide variety of signature cocktails, wine and beer.

4.0,12/2/2016,"Had lunch with the missus after a friend suggested I give Jue Lan Club a shot, and I'm happy I listened. What used to be the infamous Limelight club/church/ridiculousness is now an upscale Chinese restaurant for, as the New York Post's Steve Cuozzo said, ""people who don't like Chinese food.""We got in at 1:00, and were seated immediately in a rather aesthetically-pleasing dining room complete with exposed brick, textured walls, and swanky '20s era plush booths. With pop classics playing on the speakers, we ordered the char siu and prawn fried rice, vegetable fried rice, bokchoy, and the sloppy oxtail bao appetizer. For libations, we had the 'Lady Dragon' and the 'Shanghai Mule.' More on those awfully named drinks later. The bokchoy are served hot and are cooked with ginger and a heaping amount of garlic. A bit underseasoned, but they were just so steamy and gingery and garlicky that we couldn't stop eating them. The bokchoy and vegetable fried rice are two of the safest options for those with celiacs. JLC does tout an extensive number of gluten free options, though for some of them, you have to specify no soy sauce etc. The vegetable fried rice was reportedly good. White rice, green onions, peppers, mushrooms, eggs and squash (I think). Sprinkled with cilantro, pickled daikon and carrots, the oxtail baos were almost perfect. While the meat was braised fairly well, I had a bit of an issue eating it because the meat was a tad tough and dry. Otherwise, the baos were an above average dish. I was sad when I finished the char siu pork and prawn fried rice because I wanted more. The menu notes that the sides and rice+noodle dishes are for two, and they're correct in the sense that America has an awful history with portion control, but it was a standard lunch takeout restaurant lunch special's worth of rice. It was flowing with pieces of pork, which I was grateful for since my plate came with three chunks of prawn. I don't know; the regular pork fried rice is $13, so I guess I can't really complain about essentially paying a $1 per prawn. It's weird because I think 4-5 would've been perfect. Also, I expect a lot. Here's the thing about JLC--the food is really clean. And therein lies the major difference (with the exception of price) between Jue Lan Club and your run-of-the-mill non-Limelight Chinese restaurants. Nothing was overpowered by grease and oil, and that's something because how many times have you had Chinese food and felt great afterwards? I mean, you have to pay pretty much double for that cleanliness and quality, but no one said eating ""healthier"" was cheap. Oh, the drinks. I don't remember what the exact ingredients were, but we both absolutely loved our cocktails. $16 each ain't exactly cheap, but they were strong enough to justify the price. We agreed we'd definitely come back at least once for the cocktails alone. At the end of the day, we weren't wowed by the overall experience as service was quite lacking, but the food and drinks were still good enough to warrant four stars.",2,3,1,Hooney H.,"FLUSHING, NY",299,191,232
4.0,11/27/2016,"My friend was in town and we agreed to meet at Jue Lan Club for a brunch. We ordered from their Weekend Brunch special menu for $34.95pp. Fantastic Service I must admit, but definitely on the pricey side. Jue Lan Club serves pretty much Americanized Chinese food with a few specialty twist. Brunch included:1) Unlimited house cocktails: Choices of Bloody Mary, Lychee Bellini, Mimosa, and Screwdrivers. We switched up between the Lychee Bellini and Mimosa. Both were excellent and had a good ratio of juice and champagne. We took advantage of the deal and ordered a few rounds of it while we recapped on the last 10 years of our lives for 2.5 hours. 2) Complimentary Amuse Bouche of Edamame Dumplings. I really enjoyed the consistency of this dish. The edamame was mashed and mixed with a miso broth. It tasted like edamame mash potato in an asian crystal skin wrap. It was delicious!3) Appetizers - We ordered the satay chicken and veggie spring rolls. My satay chicken came out red, which threw me off. However, it reminded me of how my grandmother used to cook when she battered her fish with this red wine mix. The veggies spring rolls were crispy and crunchy.4) Entrees - We ordered the Singaporean Noodles and Hot and Numbing Crispy Beef. As mentioned, these are very americanized chinese food, but nonetheless, interesting. The Hot and Numbing Crispy Beef was actually on the sweeter note and the sauce they use is similar to the Beijing red sauce normally served on pork chops at chinese restaurants. But the Singaporean noodles balanced out the sweetness of the crispy beef. 5) Desserts - We had options of ice cream and sorbet and we couldn't resist ordering both. We ordered a Dolce De Leche ice cream and Mango Sorbet. Both were very flavorful and strong in flavor.6) Lastly, they also surprised us with 2 chocolate truffles to end our reunion. **I believe Robert was the manager of the restaurant.

It was a nice night so we decided to sit outside and our server was friendly and accommodating. We tried several of the drinks and each was unique and tasty. Definitely recommend the Bellini Martini, Lady Dragon and the Madame Adventurist which has chili pepper flakes giving the drink a smokey finish. We ordered a bunch of food including the chicken satays, raw tuna, green prawns and lobster fried rice. All of the food was delicious and none of it lacked in flavor. For dessert, a slice of chocolate cake definitely made to be split by 6 was brought out with a sparkler for my birthday. The cake was rich and chocolate-y and very filling. Overall, the food, drinks, and vibe made it a great dining experience. Highly recommended for a birthday or just a fun night out with friends.",1,0,0,Michael R.,"Rockland County, NY",0,7,0

1.0,9/17/2016,"Went last night for anniversary dinner with my wife.  The appetizer chicken and beef satay were swimming in the sauce , the bone marrow shrimp dumplings were rubbery chewy no hint of marrow, the oxtail a buns could have been any pulled beef on a bun, at the peeking duck was definitely from Brooklyn.  Honestly all the food tasted land and like it was prepared in advance and reheated and served.  I would give it negative stars except the people were nice. I had better Chinese food at your local corner Chinese food store.  They advertise on one restaurant app that the Chef is from Boudakhan I guess I expected more.  The best part is the bill $ 275.00 that was nuts for reheated food.

1.0,9/2/2016,"Came last night to celebrate a friend's birthday and this is what I thought about this place:Restaurant: our reservation was at 9:30, the restaurant was empty, music selection was good, it was a mellow atmosphere.Appetizers: highly recommend lobster spring rolls, rock chicken, short rib bao buns, chicken lettuce wraps. Appetizers were actually really good! Best part of my whole experience here. Main entree: biggest disappointment. We ordered lobster fried rice... It tasted like old rice, and a ton of ginger, not good. Beijing chicken tastes like tofu, it was a weird texture... For our BIGGEST disappointment, we ordered the salt and pepper lobster, no where on the menu it says that is so freaking spicy, I took a bite and it was unbearable, and it ruined my appetite for the rest of the night. It's $95 dollars so please, save your money. Dessert: they offered is an ice cream cake for our friends birthday, honestly worst dessert I've had in my life, it tasted old, the texture was slim, and it was like frozen old whipped cream.

2.0,2/22/2016,"Came here for dinner a few weeks ago - the ambiance/decor was great and the service was attentive, but the food fell short.We tried an array of dishes across the menu, but ultimately weren't very impressed. Majority of the food felt like what you'd expect to find at fast food take out or from frozen packaged food. It was either too flavorful or too bland.- Yellowtail: very fresh and ghost pepper oil gave a kick without being overpowering- Chicken satay: chicken was a dry, and there was too much sauce so that it overpowered the chicken- Rock shrimp: alot of batter and too much sauce- Hot and numbing crispy beef: pretty much all fried batter & sauce, almost no beef and not very spicy- Singapore rice noodle Jue Lan style: traditionally supposed to come with shrimp and meat, but it almost felt like a vegetarian dish with the low portion of protein - Bone marrow and prawn dumplings; Chicken dumplings; Pan fried pork and chive dumplings: definitely not worth the price when it tastes like it came from a frozen pre-package",1,0,0,Z Z.,"New York, NY",0,17,44

1.0,2/7/2016,"Horrible food, horrible service, and EXCESSIVELY loud.  There is nothing good to say about this new restaurant, except that you will do yourself a favor by not even attempting to pay this place a visit.Service was extremely slow and completely uncoordinated:  our drinks, which would take more than 15 minutes to be served, would arrive when the food was gone and would be empty by the time more food would come in.  The same Sake-Martini drink would come in all shapes and forms, with none of them tasting the same, and one of them being actually undrinkable, as it was essentially pure vodka.The worst part was the food, which was either completely bland or outrageously salty - it was simply horrible (to be polite and put it mildly).  All the dim sums and dumplings seemed to have come straight out of frozen pre-packaged boxes, so much so that the shrimp dumplings from Whole Foods are more tasty than the Shrimp Crystal Dumplings.   The Chilean Seabass, which looked more like a slice of undercooked swordfish, was very fishy, and the Gai Lan (Chinese broccoli) were served cold.   We didn't even dare ordering desserts, as we didn't feel like having another round of disappointing food.The space has great potential ...

Unfortunately I don't like to name drop so we rushed through our dinner. Honestly the check couldn't arrived at our table soon enough.Pros:Good lightingAttentive Manager Cons:When we first walked in it felt as though we stepped into a slightly more upscale sports bar. The music was very loud and people were dressed overly casual. We arrived with a reservation and told to wait at the bar while our table was prepared. We waited about 10 minutes.  When we entered the main dining room there were many empty tables, which makes me wonder why we waited in the bar for our table to be ready.Overly attentive manager who was at our table every other minute asking if everything was ok when all we wanted was to have a romantic moment alone.The waiter could not explain the dishes.Our food arrived in the wrong order.They sent us the wrong dishes. More than once. The waiter got everything wrong and then the food runners had no idea what they were doing as well.The server attempted to crumb our table, but A. Wiped some of the crumbs and B. Wiped everything into the palm of this hand. Disgusting. I can't tell you how many times staff dropped whatever they were carrying.Drinks were decent but the ice they use is terrible.The food was really nothing worth trying again.
