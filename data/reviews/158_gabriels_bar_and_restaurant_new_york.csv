5.0,2/23/2019,My wife and I went been here 5 times in the 5 years we lived in nyc and looking back I wish we had gone far more. The food and service is fantastic. I have nothing negative to say about this place. Highly recommend it.,0,0,0,Doug N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,22,5
3.0,2/18/2019,I came during restaurant week with my wife.  This place is really great.  It has a warm atmosphere and the food was good.  I just think given the pricing which is reasonably for this area I'd rather go to nougatine or elsewhere.  Still a good place for a meal.  The octopus was good.  Pot roast was ok and dessert was delicious.  Overall a nice place.,0,0,0,Philip K.,"New York, NY",2,67,198
5.0,2/3/2019,"100% worth the three short block walk from Lincoln Center for a post-opera matinee dinner.A beautiful, sleek classic atmosphere. Great service! They hit every checkbox. The bartender and servers were courteous, professional and accommodating. The gave us plenty of ""space"" to have a relaxing, romantic and delicious couples dinner. Dishes perfectly timed and beautifully executed. The food was OUTSTANDING!!! We had Caesar salad, brazino and the tagliatelle bolognese. Everything was so delicious there was almost nothing left over!We will definitely be back to Gabriel's!",1,0,0,M C.,"New Canaan, CT",0,10,4

2.0,1/16/2019,"This is the place where you will dine next to two former CIA directors. Where you will never wonder if the glass is half full or half empty because the water level in your glass will never fall below 2/3. And this is the place where you will notice that said CIA directors are sitting one table away after the manager approaches you (discreetly) to shame you for not ordering enough off the table. That is, because this is the place where you ducked into with your partner and 80 yold friend after she left Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the friend who is nursing three broken ribs from a fall and couldn't walk very far so we went here. And this is the place where said manager will actually debate you before saying that because of you he is inspired to impose a minimum. Finally, this is where your old tired duck was reborn ragu sauce.",0,3,0,A G.,"New York, NY",0,3,0
3.0,1/1/2019,"I came here with my family to celebrate new year's eve. I wholeheartedly agree with many of the reviews that the value for the money is extremely low as the food is not very exciting and mediocre at best given how much we paid for the meal as well as the abundance of fine dining options around this area. On the bright side, however, I can understand why Gabriel's still have loyal followers night in and night out. The staff was quite courteous and attended to all of our needs.",0,0,1,Mike H.,"Evanston, IL",197,159,751
5.0,12/20/2018,"I dine at Gabriel's often. I bring friends, colleagues, even my wife!! Gabriel presides as a gracious and friendly host, genuinely concerned that you have a delightful experience. The food is always terrific --pastas, carpaccio, tuna, etc. Scott at the bar is also always charming. The ambience is comfort--no one is trying too had to impress.

3.0,12/9/2018,"I know Italian food fairly well having made numerous trips to Italy where I have enjoyed both fancy and simple restaurants, so I was looking forward to dinner at Gabriel's. My wife and I had a reservation and were seated right away even though the place was crowded.

5.0,10/21/2018,"I have been to this place several times. It feels a little like a Woody Allen movie - admittedly a little dated, with a slightly aging clientele, but the food, service and ambience remain all of a very high standard. It is neighborly with not many tourists despite its location right near Columbus Circle. Reliably great food, nice service with a touch of glamor but without the attitude.",2,0,1,Deborah B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,35,0

2.0,7/27/2018,"Came here today as it's 2 blocks from where we live. Must be a reason why we've never stepped foot in her prior for the last 8 years. Upon walking in, we were promptly seated in a relatively empty restaurant at 9pm on a Friday night DURING restaurant week (This should have been a red flag). Upon settling into our table, the serve audibly and visually was NOT pleased with us sitting there and said so to our host. My short rib was cooked perfectly and overall, was a good dish for restaurant week. But our server left a bad taste in my mouth. The overall vibe of the entire place is outdated and seemingly like the actual servers would prefer to be else where. Even so much as taking a seat at the bar instead of tending to tables. Though, I must note that the food runners and busboys were extremely courteous. As an Upper West Sider, I'll spend my money else where. Thankfully, we had impeccable service for cocktails across the street at the Mandarin Oriental's The Aviary.",1,0,0,Amber M.,"New York, NY",114,18,3

2.0,5/1/2018,"Beware if you are using Opentable to reserve, since Gabriel's doesn't acknowledge your Opentable reservation even when you hand them the Opentable printout. We arrived on time with the printout of our reservation and requests which we gave to the host. We thought it was odd that he didn't look at it, but instead  asked how many in our party. We explained  (2 persons) which was in the Opentable printout we just gave him which he still did not look at. Perhaps there was a language problem. We said we had requested a quiet table. He seated us at a quiet table so assumed he had understood the Opentable request, but the restaurant was fairly empty, so not a difficult request for him. THEN, when we returned home, Opentable sent us an email asking why we never showed up? Obviously, the host never looked at our printout, or didn't know what Opentable was and didn't acknowledge the reservation.  This was the second time they ignored our Opentable reservation. We have not had this problem with any other Opentable restaurants we've booked in various cities around the country.

5.0,3/28/2018,"Incredible food and atmosphere. The service is attentive and excellent in their selections from the menu. Enjoyed the octopus salad. Tender with chic peas and a very lite dressing. My husband enjoyed the stuffed portabello, stuffed with spinach and topped with smoked mozzarella and diced red pepper. Our entree was outstanding.

4.0,3/8/2018,"Don't let the 'old school', late 70's decor fool you.  The food is very good.  We had the cream gazpacho with cucumber.  Outstanding!  Split the bolognese pasta.  Apps were solid.  Nice and simple wine list.  Only hiccup was the service.  Bus boy, water boy, even the other waiter were helping out to make up for the owner's 'nephew' who seem to spend more time on his cell than watching the water/wine pour.  Other than that, really worth going.",1,0,0,Mike R.,"Cleveland, OH",3,81,0

1.0,1/5/2018,"The food was good.  The service was good.  Luciano was our server. Two people in our party of 4 were drinking and ordered a bottle of wine that was $44.  The waiter brought a bottle of wine that appeared to be the label that was selected, as checked by the ordering party, a person fairly well-versed in wines.  When the bill came, there was a $90 charge for wine.  It turns out that the wine that was brought to the table had an almost identical label to the $44 bottle that had been ordered.  The waiter said that it was on the wine list in the same location as the other one and they made a mistake in bringing us the wrong bottle (on the adjacent line of the menu).  In fact, the wine that was brought to the table was on an entirely different page of the wine menu from the one that was ordered.  The server and the manager refused to make an adjustment in our bill, essentially saying that the two people in our party drank the more expensive bottle and had to pay for it.  Instead, as a gesture, they brought some biscotti cookies and four glasses of champagne to the table.  Since only two parties were drinking, that didn't benefit the other two.  Furthermore, nobody wanted any champagne at that point in time.  It was a very disappointing experience.  Whatever happened to ""the customer is always right""?, especially since it was clearly an error of the restaurant.  We will not go back to this restaurant because we have a sense that we were not treated properly.",0,0,0,Barry H.,"Carmel Valley, CA",0,1,0
5.0,12/29/2017,"We had a great pre-theater dinner date experience at Gabriel's! We were seated promptly upon arrival with the host checking our coats, which is a big plus in the cold NY winters. Our drink orders came out in a timely manner while we browsed the menu and the waiter described the specials for the night. The choices sounded delicious, so it did not make our decisions easy! We decided on the mussels to share as an appetizer, which they served to us in two separate dishes, such a nice touch! For entrees my husband got the scallop risotto special and I got the butternut squash ravioli. We highly recommend both! The ravioli was absolutely delicious - homemade pasta with a sweet filling, in browned butter with fried sage on top made the dish balanced and decadent. The scallop risotto was well cooked, creamy and flavorful. The atmosphere is low-key and sophisticated, perfect for a date night. While not an inexpensive place, you will receive fresh quality food and attentive, knowledgeable service. We had two gentlemen wait on us throughout the evening, not letting a drink go empty or a finished plate sit on the table. We will definitely keep Gabriel's on our list for the future!",3,1,2,CLeigh S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,12,0
4.0,12/24/2017,"Dined here before a NY Philharmonic concert.   We rather stumbled upon Gabriel's when walking from Rockefeller Center.  The service was excellent and the food was very good.  We had the grilled calamari for a starter which was nicely done , if a bit chewy.  We each had pasta entrees.  I thought there was too much butter in both but they were tasty dishes.   Our server was very accommodating.",1,0,0,Brian B.,"North Brunswick, NJ",7,90,29
4.0,12/20/2017,"I was really impressed with the service and food.  While this place could probably get by on its convenience to Lincoln Center, they served a strong menu, with a decent wine menu coupled with strong service.  I enjoyed it and I would return.",2,0,1,Bryant R.,"Manhattan, NY",100,529,0
5.0,11/26/2017,"A classic in the Lincoln Center area, Gabriel's continues  to turn out consistently excellent food.  Gabriel himself presides over an elegant but comfortable setting.  The burrata is not to be missed.  And even if you gave up carbs for your New Year's resolution, this is the place to break down and at least get an order of pasta for the table to share.  Check out the mezzaluna in particular.  For fish I like the salmon, and for a meat entrée the short ribs with polenta.While the culinary arts are deservedly front and center, don't be surprised if you see Marty Scorsese, former Mayor Bloomberg, or other luminaries in the cast of diners. Those in the Lincoln Center area who are entranced with more recent entrants would do will to revisit this gem.Ps. Excellent choice as well for those who like to eat at the bar, which is very affably and professionally run.",5,1,3,Mycroft H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,7

Luciano our waiter was fabulous. He picked each course and had it split between the two of us. We were in Italy just months ago and feel like we were there now!  Try the lamb tortellini, the sauce is to die for! You will want more bread to dip it in the sauce.

5.0,11/8/2017,Excellent food and service. My fiend and I decided to share and asked them for an extra place. They were beyond expectations and made two small dishes for each entree we ordered.

2.0,8/16/2017,"let's just say it's not how I remembered it.  The atmosphere is pleasant enough but the food is just not that good.  We went for restaurant week and the waiter seemed slightly irritated. The food was brought by, and we were mostly attended to by the busboy (gentleman) who was gracious and pleasant.We had burrata and mezzaluna in a tomato mascarpone sauce.  Both appetizers were good and served in a pretty presentation.  We all ordered short ribs for the main course.  The polenta was the best thing we ate all night.  Creamy and soft, how did the chef accomplish that?  I'd like the recipe.  As for the short ribs, mine are better.  Lots better.  The one piece of meat needed salt and a sauce.  The meet was served dry (on the bed of polenta with a demi glace but was in desperate need of salt and a way more sauce.  So dry we had to take it home to try with our own sauce.The hot chocolate cake must have come out of the freezer.  It too was dry, not molten or soft.

4.0,2/15/2017,"The restaurant is very convenient to Lincoln Center and nice for a pre-theater dinner.  When you enter, they will take your coat for you and we were seated right away but there weren't many people there at that time.  The tables on the side that seat two are pretty close together and as the restaurant filled up, it seemed more crowded and you can hear everyone's conversations so if you don't want to be heard, speak softly or use sign language.  Of course everyone is engaged in their own conversation and it's not really a problem.  A friend and I went during restaurant week and chose from that menu.  We both started with the mezzaluna that had a spinach pinenut and ricotta filling with a tomato sauce.  The taste was very nice-good combination of flavors.  The pasta was a bit underdone but still good.   For the entree we both had the short ribs on parmesan polenta which was delicious.  The meet was very tender-just fell apart easily and the polenta was quite tasty as well.  For dessert, I had the blood orange sorbet that had some fruit and a waffle cone cookie.  It was a nice ending to the meal.  My friend had the chocolate cake and really enjoyed it.  Throughout the meal, service was attentive.  As we left, the person at the hostess station helped me put my coat on.",1,1,1,Betsy B.,"Tucson, AZ",50,528,917

4.0,12/26/2016,"Summary:  Delicious & hidden, but not quite classic Italian.  I love it, but can see how and why others wouldn't.  4 stars only because this area is highly competitive in Italian.The Vibe:  This part is where it goes from 5 to 4 stars.  It doesn't quite meet the requirements to be high end, i.e. associated with its price, but I wouldn't call it mid-range either.  While many have written odd things about staff, I found them very nice.  Lunch is dead.  Dinner may be a bit more lively.  An empty dining room did not impact quality of food or service though.The Crowd:  Older. You can take your parents.  I also added to my date list because there are nice seating areas that allow for intimate conversation.  Depends on the kind of date you're trying to have.  It's not a classic NY wild fun spot.  More if you're trying to get a break from the hubbub.The Service:  My dude was totally on top of it.  I told him we had something to do afterwards that required a hard stop and he sorted us out.  Great suggestions.  The dude knew the menu.The Food:  Wow... truly delicious.  The Pastas - All can be split.  The Bolognese that i had was so incredibly flavorful.  One of the best I've had, though a bit different from a classic Bolognese.  I liked it better.The Salad - Fresh and wonderful.  It was a solid and delicious Ceasar.The Steak - cooked to perfection.  Tender and well flavored.",6,1,3,May L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",617,466,229

He was actually surly and condescending.  He ignored our requests for service, coming over to our table when I guess he thought he absolutely had to.  He reminded me of Maks on Dancing with the Stars only without the dancing chops.We wil go to Gabriel's again, but we will ask for another waiter to serve us.",1,1,2,Anonymous A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0

2.0,8/18/2016,"Not really sure what all the ""exceptional"" accolades are about. The distinguishing characteristic is a very authentic, old-world vibe and room. Because it is. The food prices are simply astronomical and outrageous. You can purchase meals from the finest restaurants in Manhattan for the sesame cost, with far superior quality. Oddly, wine bottle prices are reasonable. The food is good. Meaning, simply and basically prepared. It is reminiscent of flavorful home cooking. Nothing I had was technique dependent, and nothing made me wonder, ""How did they make this taste this way/so good?"" Personally, I'd stop in for a drink at the bar, to enjoy the old world feel of the room. For the cost of the food, you can do much, much better elsewhere.

Our cheese course came with a  spoon, but required a knife as well.  As for the roasted watermelon, the result is slimy and bereft of the refreshing taste of the simple fruit; the baby veggies on the fish plate had no flavor and were neither cooked, nor raw...

How cool is that.We ordered raw tuna and calamari for an appetizer. The latter wasn't that cheap frozen stuff you get soaked in batter but served uncovered with onions. Delicious. Same with the tuna. For dinner, we had linguine with sausage and the tagliatelle with veal. Both delicious and just the right portions, so we didn't feel over or underfed. Also not a ton of grease/oil like so much so-called ""Italian"" food. Desert we had chocolate truffle cake, which was sublime.  (Yes, we ate a lot but we hadn't eaten much of a lunch, so sue us since we barely spend on anything else.)Why a star off? Service could use a little work. Although everybody is super nice, we had like 4 different servers, and it took a while to flag them down when we needed something, especially the check.

Let me just say that I was blown away. From the moment we walked in, we were treated with white glove service. Gabriel's personal touch adds so much to a warm, welcoming, comfortable atmosphere. Eddie, the restaurant manager, took care of us and the attention to detail was impeccable. Then there's the food - starting with the best burrata I have ever tasted, through the world class grilled octopus appetizer special and the grilled red snapper, my favorite fish, everything was exceptional. Add to that the small touches such as the bruschetta and the taste of butternut squash ravioli when we sat down, and this was a meal worthy of a five star rating.

We elected the restaurant week prix fixe menu and were disappointed, however. The Caesar salad to start was cold and skimpy with more cheese than the lettuce required. It was as if the salads for the $38 menu were premade and sitting in a fridge. The salmon main course was fine but difficult to manage with kale that was almost impossible to cut. The cheese plate for dessert was cold, much like the salad, and with 2 tiny slices of crostini for the goat cheese. The advertised berries amounted to 3. Service ranged from a perfunctory woman taking our drinks order to a solicitous and friendly waiter from Montenegro. He was gone however when we tried to flag someone down for our check.

5.0,1/17/2016,"I first visited Gabriel's the week it opened some 25 years ago and I have been a fan ever since. For many of those early years Gabriel's was an ""oasis in the culinary desert that was the Lincoln Center area"". The quality of the cuisine around Lincoln Center has improved over the years, but Gabriel's continues to stand out as offering the finest dining in the area.After several years of absence from the city, I recently returned to the restaurant for a dinner. The dining experience, I can report, is as wonderful as ever. And it is as crowded and popular as ever, Three things account for Gabriel's populararity: 1) top quality ingredients and food preparation; 2) an excellent well-trained staff; and, not to be overlooked 3) the winning personality and charm of the owner, Gabriel Aiello. People-watching can be an added dimension favoring Gabriel's as celebrities are known to frequent the place.You can generally trust the specials that are off the menu. On the menu I can recommend the Buratta (the Vidalia onion jam makes it) and the Tuna Crudo. The Roasted Beet Salad sits on a flavorful cauliflower puree and is also recommended. The pastas are all good, but a standout is the Ravioli Zucca, with its delicious butternut squash, browned butter and sage filling. The fish entrees are always worth a try. For an entrée I enthusiasstically suggest one that many might pass up: Kid Arrabiato. Yes, that's goat. If you like goat or have never had goat, this is the one to try. It is the best goat dish I have ever had: not at all gamey, it is literally fork-tender reflecting its long braising time. The taste is very similar to beef. The brown sauce is rich and savory. It has a spicy kick. And if that doesn't suit your palate, you can ask for it to be toned down a notch or two. The wine list offers some very nice wines are relatively moderate prices.All-in-all, you can't beat Gabriel's in and around the Lincoln Center area.",7,0,3,Frank R.,"Tucson, AZ",10,151,304

The gelato she ordered for dessert was delicious. The appetizer I had wasn't the best. The calamari was not fried as expected and was very rubbery. It was also unexpectedly spicy.

Our preference is to sit at the bar, although we have been at a table for dinner in the past.  Scott and Leo always take fine care of us astray greet us with attention, fine drinks and service where we feel like family.  If they are off for the evening all other service is equally well done although they may not know us by name or prefernences. On our last visit on a hot summer's night we started with Gray Goose Gimlets straight up that were perfection.  In the winter, our preference is the perfect Manhattan to warm us up. Next, Tom ordered a Casear salad with anchovies that he favors.  I had the special Barrata with fig and vidalia onion dressing with a fresh fig on the top.  Heaven. Until then I thought that the best Barrata ever was on Arthur Ave. . . but not so it was here!  Wanting a light dinner we split the spaghetti special with schrimp and scallops which was out of this world. The flavors were mouth watering perfection.  It was no ordinary spaghetti dish.  It was perfectly paired with Scott's white wine of choice...trust him.

Apparently a neighborhood favorite for years, Gabriel's has very professional service, who know how to graciously but effectively get patrons in/out before curtain time. The food was amazing. My short ribs with almond polenta was like butter (ribs) with cream (polenta). The burata mozzarella appetizer was as good I've had in Italy, and the food and wine list got 5 stars from my Italian companion as well.

Service was very attentive and professional. The decor is bright and airy with a high ceiling white walls, a large well stocked bar near the entrance, and pristine tablecloths that announces you're in a sophisticated dining establishment.A friend of mine who has dined here many times told this is a favorite of President Bill Clinton.

Past the vast spread of tables in the dining area, a sizable alcove sits to the left, perfect for our private function of approximately 30 people. We had passed hor d'oeuvres of all sorts, and the service did not stop! I couldn't walk or sit without almost bumping into a server, and that was certainly a good thing. Among some of the items I tried were the lamp chops with truffle honey (...out of this word amazing!), toasts with herbed cream cheese and a slice of rare beef, crab cakes with pepper aoili, Chicken Milanse (served in adorable Chinese soup spoons), shrimp and beef on skewers (presented stuck into a pineapple), and scallops. Though I avoided the seafood, all that tried it loved it. My favorite were the lamb chops, which were nothing short of perfection. The Chicken Milanese was excellent with the perfect amount of tomato and cheese, and the toasts with cheese and beef, well, I ate a good half dozen, I'd say! The meat was a little hard to chew through, so I had to take big bites and chew well! (Haha.) The only letdown was the skewered meat; though the first batch came out marinated in a sweet citrusy sauce, the second batch was flavorless and dry as a bone. Eh.As for the wine, which we had a unlimited supply of for about two and a half hours, really flowed, like...well...wine! It was bottomless and delicious. I'm not even sure what I was drinking. I'm just of the school of ""any red wine adds in digestion"". It' the Italian in me.At one point, a gentleman came into the room and spoke to a few people; I was told it was Gabriel himself. It was very kind of him to come out and thank us. One person stated she was a little off put because she claimed he was merely out to brag that Tom Brokaw was eating dinner in the dining area that night, but that's hearsay. Heheh. Regardless, he was nice to acknowledge us and it was appreciated. It was an all around pleasurable evening, from the food to the wine to the service.

Several years after I had graduated from high school (fast forward from the early 2000s to last week), I actually get to walk in since my boyfriend's father's office was holding their holiday party here. Now, my thoughts on this restaurant will be kind of skewed since I did attend a special event here as opposed to just a regular dining experience. There were numerous attendees to this event, so the servers seemed to get slightly overwhelmed. Nevertheless, a tasty pre-fixe menu had been set aside for each attendee and the servers managed to be on the ball with everything. I had their portobello mushroom appetizer (very tasty), their ravioli zucca (good, but kind of too sweet for me), and their tiramisu dessert (delicious). If I was in the area, I would consider coming back here. My dining experience had been pleasant and I had no complaints at the end of my meal.",1,0,0,Cinthia K.,"Elmhurst, Queens, NY",238,699,367
5.0,12/19/2012,"A perfect meal.The wine list had a nice selection and was reasonably priced. The sommelier knew his stuff and helped us choose a great wine (of which I forgot the name, darn).To start, we got (1) grilled calamari and (2) roasted red pepper with mozzarella and pesto sauce. The calamari was perfectly flavored and cooked (not rubbery!), and the roasted red pepper with mozzarella and pesto sauce was a great combination of flavors (I don't even really like peppers).I didn't have the table bread, but others at the table kept eating it. I'm going to say it was good bread.I ordered one of the evening's specials, wild boar rib topped with a cherry glaze atop baby carrots and mashed potatoes. Oh. My. God. I would have licked the plate if it weren't frowned upon. I asked it to be cooked according to the chef's recommendation, and kudos to the chef for making the right decision! The rib was tender and juicy, and the glaze and sides brought everything together. The significant other ordered the same dish, exactly the same way, and he was happy as well.Others at the table ordered pasta (one lasagna and one with sausage and peppers). They wanted to lick their plates clean as well.We all told our server that our dishes were horrible and that we demand they make us better ones. She didn't believe us... wonder why :)Our server was attentive and sweet. Bonus points to her for chasing after us when we left the restaurant because a phone charger fell out of my friend's bag and was left under the table.

The wait staff is super attentive and we even had a friendly chat with the owner (really great guy).

4.0,12/30/2010,"This is simply a wonderful place to have a meal. The bartenders are friendly and make a mean martini. I usually get mine slightly dirty and just a touch dry. Gabriel is a great host. For starters, I would go with the mussels which are steamed with white wine, tomatoes, garlic, and hot pepper. They are cooked perfectly and the sauce is made to dip your bread into. If you get a Caesar salad, it is large enough for 2 people to split and the crab meat adds a nice touch to salad. The pasta course I like is the butternut squash ravioli zucca, which is sweet. The brown butter and sage are a perfect combination for the pasta, which is always al dente. If you like meat and are willing to try goat, the kid arrabbiato is the dish I would recommend. The meat is tender and falls off the bone.

2.0,9/26/2010,"This restaurant had so much potential to make this a 5-star review but they failed to deliver this experience to me. Here's why:My party and I came here for a late lunch on Saturday in early September after celebrating a friend's graduation and upon recommendation from someone. The restaurant was relatively empty so our party of 10 was quickly seated. The hostess was also nice enough to bring some craft materials over to keep the children entertained. Unfortunately from there the experience went downhill.Being the yelper that I am, I decide to look at my trusted peers' recommendations of the place on my smartphone before arrival. I noticed that there was a little blurb published by the business that mentions ""September Special: Mention yelp to get a free glass of Moscato!"" When the waiter came by to ask for drinks, I inquired about this and he said that ""they do no such things."" I then show him my phone with the yelp page pulled up and the ad. He mentions that ""oh we don't do that anymore."" Odd. The ad said SEPTEMBER special and unless someone changed all the clocks on me, I was very confident I was sitting in the restaurant on a September Saturday. I didn't want to argue to ruin the celebratory mood so they get a-1 STAR FOR NOT LIVING UP TO THEIR WORD ON YELP.Our table was set with individual plates and sides of butter. It appears that bread would be served but the first thing that came out were our entrees half an hour later. Another 15 minutes into our meal when we were all done, the waiters came out with the forgotten bread, now cold and tough. Yes, our meals took only 15 minutes to eat even with the chatter because Gabriel's is an advocate of the big plate small servings ideal. -1 STAR FOR FORGETTING THE BREAD AND DELIVERING IT AT THE END OF OUR MEAL.In terms of the food, I took the waiter's recommendation of the Mezzaluna. I received 6 tasteful raviolis, but I wish I knew to order more because I still felt hungry afterwards. The person sitting across from me had the Pork Medallions and told me how fresh it was. The person sitting next to me ordered the Tuna Steak medium-well but it came out medium-rare. -1 STAR FOR INCORRECTLY COOKING A MEALUsually I am not this critical but maybe I'm just bitter at the fact that the restaurant did not live up to its advertising on yelp.

5.0,7/28/2010,"We totally lucked out with Gabriel's. As foodies, we planned our restaurants before our departure so that we have everything lined up for our week of chow down. It's like an addiction for us. We knew we wanted at least one Italian meal when we were in the Big Apple. At the very last minute, we came across Gabriel's on Yelp and all the Yelpers had such good experience there we decided to try to get a reservation. We managed to grab a lunch reservation on our last day in NY. Even though Gabriel's is a little out of the way for us, we took 2 different trains and got there hungry. When we were there, Gabriel's was participating in the NY Restaurant Week and was offering 3-course lunch or dinner pre-fixed menu specials. For a 3-course lunch, we paid $24.95 per person, what a deal! My choice of 3-course: 1. BEET SALAD WITH CRUNCHY FENNELS AND GOAT CHEESE - This is definitely a texture enhanced dish. The beets are tender and the goat cheese is creamy and soft top with the crunchy fried fennels. So many things going on in my mouth. What stood out in this dish is the chef's ability to demonstrate the perfect play of texture with 3 different ingredients. 2. TUNA STEAK WITH WATER CRESS AND CHERRY TOMATOES - Tuna grilled medium rare with the outer layer seared perfectly leaving the center still pink and rare. The perfect way to enjoy a good piece of tuna steak. The based of this dish was a layer of thinly sliced cucumbers, then a bed of watercress, cherry tomatoes, and then 2 generous pieces of fish drizzled with tangy, creamy vinaigrette. Layers upon layers of texture and temperature combination made this dish so unique and alluring to the eyes as well as to the palette. The cold cucumbers, the crunchy watercress, the warm tuna and the tangy dressing. I had die and went to heaven! 3. BLOOD ORANGE SORBET - When I took my first taste, it was an explosion of blood orange flavor. The sorbet is so light with a deep orange and red color, but the flavor was so intense.My dining companion chose:1. COLD CUCUMBER SOUP - Cold, creamy, but not heavy with lots of fresh mint, thin slices of cucumbers, croutons. It has a lot of good flavors and texture all in our dish. Incredible indeed! I had to say, this was the perfect soup for a hot summer in NY. I told the owner that all we need was a big cup of this soup in a Styrofoam cup to go and we could sip on that all day as we run thru NY in the heat. 2. CHICKEN SCALLOPINI WITH LEMON BUTTER SAUCE AND CAPERS AND ASPARAGUS - Wow! The chicken breast was lightly battered and pan fried to golden brown with the insides still juicy. The sauce is heavenly. It has a very apparent lemon scent and flavor combined with creamy butter and tangy capers. 3. VANILLA BEANS GELATO - The phrase ""would you like more ice-cream with your vanilla beans"" came to mind. This cup of gelato had exploded in a bag of vanilla beans. Every bite is more vanilla beans. The gelato was incredibly dense, creamy and almost buttery. Half way thru the meal, another gentleman came to clear our plates. He introduced himself as Gabriel, the owner of the restaurant. What a nice guy. We talked about his restaurants and the menu, the dishes we were having and it was just delightful to be able to meet the man who created such a wonderful restaurant with authentic Italian cuisine.We ate well at Gabriel's as you can probably tell and for a super affordable price. Gabriel's prices on their regular menu are also very affordable considering the high quality of food and presentation you'll get. The restaurant is the quintessential classic elegant European restaurant with nice modern deco, comfortable leather seats, a handsome bar and beautiful artwork on the wall. The place is filled with locals as far as we could tell because as diners leave, Gabriel saw them out and said farewell to them as though they were leaving his house after a nice lunch. That said a lot about a good restaurant. As for us, Gabriel's was a great ending to a wonderful trip to NY and a memorable farewell meal and then we were off to JFK and on board Virgin America headed west.

Meal: Started with the toscana soup which is a light tomato base soup including italian sausage and mirepoix. Wine: The Sommelier reassured bf's choice of wine, and of course I cannot remember the year, country of origin except that it was a delicate red, not acidic. Wine complimented the entire meal. Per entree, I ordered the daily special: Risotto with peas, pancetta and a heavy cream which was so good I was tempted to lick the plate. Very filling meal. Always amazed when chef's can whip up a perfectly al dente risotto meal. For desert we shared a rich molten chocolate cake with vanilla bean icecream, chocolate stick? and raspberry sauce decorating the dish.  A warm cappuccino was a nice way to end this meal. Misc: Wine list is extensive and has great variety. Bar and dinner seating. Waitstaff is absolutely wonderful: felt pampered almost.

As we all shared I tasted everything--the pasta did taste like homemade, and was packed with flavor! My Quail was great too! The only reason why I'm a bit greedy to give it 5 stars, was the price.

4.0,6/11/2008,"I'd be tempted to give this place more than 4 stars but its just not five. I'll echo Eric's sentiments about the Columbus Circle area. I'm sure there are bigger rip-offs on the planet than Buchon bakery but considering Keller's consistent record of not living up to the prices, that dump will have to top my list for now until I'm suckered into Per Se or French Laundry. Right now I don't have enough money to be that dumb. But moving on...I must say that I really liked this place and I just got back from a trip to Italy. I ordered the lamb ragu because I admit that I was missing Siennese food and this really didn't disappoint. Granted, had I been back for a while, I'd second guess myself but it was only a week and a half that I was in the Sistine chapel.The salads were good and the wine list was seriously cheap. I expected this place to rip me off and to have a wine list that ranges from $29 - $75 is verging on a joke. I had the $44 Sardinian wine and it was rather impressive. Perhaps more importantly, the sommelier who asked to help out didn't seem to try and steer me to a pricier option. I didn't have any main courses aside from pasta and no desert so I can't comment there but the service was great, the food was great and the prices were reasonable. I can't complain.

Fettucini pomodoro was well cooked and great in it's simplicity. My short ribs were fantastic, but even better was the polenta side with shitake mushrooms. Simply awesome. Standard Arugula salad and tiramisu were OK.Had a nice bottle of Proseco, which was overpriced, but the service made up for it all!We'll be back.",2,0,0,Eric J. R.,"Brooklyn, NY",80,93,0
3.0,4/15/2008,"Service was good.. food not so goodThe BF's mom has never had a good experience here but because so many people have praised Gabriel's food, she thought it only right to give it another try.. againI wasn't super hungry so I ordered the Grilled Portobello Mushroom with Fontina Cheese drizzled with Truffle vinaigrette. It was pretty good.. I liked the truffle oil - definitely gave it that perfumed taste that truffle oil adds to any dish. The bf ordered the Mezzaluna  -Half-moon Pasta filled with Spinach, Pine nuts and aged Ricotta in a sauce of Tomato, Mascarpone, and Oregano. - It was really just average. You could hardly taste the mascarpone, the pine nuts were overwhelming, the sauce mehhhWill we come back? probably not.. too many excellent restaurants in NYC to give this place another try. Will BF's mom come back? perhaps giving it another try may be in the cards.. undecided.",1,0,1,Monica S.,"San Francisco, CA",138,602,16
4.0,3/15/2008,"I dropped into Gabriel's for a meal at the bar. It's located just off Columbus Circle. The decor was warm and traditional with green leather cushioned dark wood seating and panels. It felt like a place Frank and Deano would hang out when they were in town. I went straight for a paparadelle pasta with braised pheasant, Shitaki Mushrooms, Black Currants and Cognac with a touch of Mascarpone. It was a large bowl with plenty of of bird in it and it was delicious with a glass of dark ruby red wine.  I skipped an appetizer thinking I'd have a desert but there were too many calories in the prices which began @ $15 and up.  Bottom line - if you're just looking for a great bowl of pasta in a civilized environment with good service then Gabriel's is a good bet.",0,0,0,AntonEgo C.,"Menlo Park, CA",1,30,0
3.0,3/21/2007,"I'm torn between three and four stars.  My lobster bisque was above average but nothing to write home about.  The fresh mozzarella and sweet pepper appetizer was amazing though.  Generous chunks of fresh mozzarella and chilled marinated sweet peppers seasoned to perfection.  The menu didn't really excite me though.  So, good standard italian, with a few highlights, but nothing amazing.  The decor was standard as well.",1,0,1,Anne C.,"New York, NY",37,105,8
4.0,7/21/2006,"For those looking for a well-turned, moderate-to-expensively priced dinner close to the theater district and Lincoln Center, this unassuming American bistro does a nice job. You would hardly notice the restaurant on 60th Street even if it does have a prime location near Columbus Circle simply because the massive Time Warner building complex dwarves it. Yet, you can get a fine pre-theater meal even if the sight of four (count 'em, four) hostesses seems a bit overwhelming. My friend and I were there at around 5:30PM, and a number of guests in their theater finery were already well into their meals.  It's a relatively small place, tastefully appointed...just the type of place that wealthy, older Upper West Siders are bound to go to avoid the crowds. A little more pizzazz in their decor wouldn't hurt as there was no one remotely hip in the place (a lot of fur and sequins...and on women, no less), but fortunately the food is quite good. My friend had the pappardelle with quail and mushrooms in a light cream sauce. It was tasty and the noodles had a nice consistency. But I have to say my order was superb...butternut squash ravioli in a brown butter sauce that was almost decadently flavorful. Our waiter was quite nice and attentive and not the patronizing sort one would expect from such a place. This is definitely an option to consider before a performance at the Met or a Broadway show.  FOOD - 4 stars AMBIANCE - 4 stars SERVICE - 4 stars OVERALL - 4 stars",6,3,5,Ed U.,"San Francisco, CA",4521,4629,37977
4.0,12/9/2005,"The dinner and wine menus offered many tantalizing options, from which it was truly difficult to choose. The service and staff were excellent: accomodating, helpful and charming. A truly lovely evening and ideally located quite close to Lincoln Center for pre-opera dining.",0,0,0,Steve M.,"New Hyde Park, NY",3,528,0
3.0,11/24/2005,"Good place to bring the oldsters -- a nice, fancy Italian joint close to the theater or to Lincoln Center.  The service is good, as is the wine list.  The food was tasty.   An affordable choice -- and easier to get into-- than the extremely pricey alternatives situated right across the street in the Time Warner Center.",0,0,0,Meryl C.,"Brooklyn, NY",393,408,23
5.0,10/18/2005,"Excellent Italian food and more on the pricey side.  The pastas are homemade.  I had a delicious mushroom and goat cheese appetizer and a sweet ravioli dish for my entree.  Both were top notch.  It's a quiet, white tablecloth, older crowd.  Very spatious and relaxing.",1,0,0,Sarah B.,"New York, NY",41,280,505
