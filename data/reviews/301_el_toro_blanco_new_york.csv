4.0,4/12/2019,This is the second time that I have been here. I ate outside the first time and this time I ate inside. The inside is cute. The food is pretty good!  We had an The chips and guacamole is an appetizer. We actually ordered another appetizer but we had them bring it with the entrées.  I will for sure go back again.

3.0,3/17/2019,"Food was great but sadly service was lacking. Went for bottomless brunch and my friends and I were certainly not trying to overdo it (not the party brunch place type of vibe) and we had empty glasses for a while. At one point we had to ask the server two times in about 15 min for refills, and it wasn't crowded. The restrooms were also pretty poorly stocked, one was out of toilet paper when I went (thankfully I noticed) so I made my way to the other which was out of soap. Still out of soap 45 min later when I notified a member of staff. That all being said, I really enjoyed my tacos and they were just the right amount of food. The St. Germain spritzes at brunch are a nice alternative to the standard Bloody Marys and mimosas. I'll give it another shot.",0,0,0,Maria F.,"Manhattan, NY",28,23,0

She was very informative with the menu items and suggested a few of her favorites - even paired my drinks with each dish. It was such a great time and I think besides the food, her attentiveness was the highlight of last night's dinner. I cant wait to return and try many more items - I see myself becoming a regular.

1.0,7/6/2018,"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants.  I absolutely loved the pulled pork empanadas and the homemade chips and guacamole.  Also, my husband and I would always share the shrimp tacos and the carnitas tacos with pineapple.   I went here today and all my favorites were no longer on the menu.  I ordered the chips and guac and the chips looked and tasted like they came out of a tostitos bag.  The guac really didn't have much flavor to it at all.  Additionally I ordered the carne asada tacos (since they didn't have my normal favorites on the menu anymore) and I couldn't eat more then one bite they tasted so bad.  The tortilla tasted stale.  I was very very disappointed in my old favorite Mexican restaurant.  I don't know if they got a new chef or new owner but the changes they made were all terrible.  Very very disappointing.",0,0,0,Chris F.,"Chatham, NJ",0,3,0

I ordered a chorizo quesadilla and tacos, both were pretty tasty. I ordered a Matador and the piña colada shot with that were so yummy! Our table also ordered chips and guac and veggie sticks to share, they give you a lot.

Confused when we were given the brunch menu and then the happy hour menu was taken away. We stayed to the ""4pm happy hour"" but was told it couldn't be on the patio. When we questioned that we were told that money is taken away from the bartender. We asked if we could buy a drink from happy hour inside and come back outside because we had a dog. That was yet again with a no and talk to the manager.Spoke with the manager and it was the person who made the signs fault that it was misleading.

2.0,5/6/2018,"My two star review is solely based on the service we received. The food was actually very good. We ordered over priced guacamole but were very happy with how it turned out. The salsa that accompanied it, both green and red was also amazing. I had the mahi tacos and my girlfriend had the shrimp cheese crisp and both were great. The produce here is seriously on point.Now getting back to the 2 stars. We got seated and immediately forgotten about. We found a waiter and finally got guac and drinks ordered. 20ish minutes later we had only received the guac, which was wrong when they brought it (zero spice when we asked for the highest spice level) and we were unable find our waiter to ask about it. We found the manager who then got our drinks delivered. To make up for the issue he sent an appetizer over to our table which was very nice. But we weren't even halfway through eating it when a bus boy came by, reached across the table and took it without saying anything. We were more confused than anything and we asked why it had been taken and got the simple response, ""thought you were done""In all honesty I'd give food a 4 of 5, service a 1 or 0 of 5, and overall experience a 2 of 5.Hope that helps, if you don't mind incredibly bad service I'd actually recommend this place for the food",1,1,0,Trevor M.,"New York, NY",0,11,7
1.0,5/1/2018,Nice atmosphere but terrible service and really overpriced food.

4.0,4/29/2018,"We sat outside for a drink and some guacamole. There is a lot of pleasant outdoor seating to enjoy and the inside decor was pleasant and spacious. Walking by tables, the entrees all looked pretty delicious and smelled great. Drink prices are a bit steep given the amount of $5 bars in the area, but the $17 Manhattan was very well crafted. Our service was a little off - we waited about 15 minutes for our drinks despite an average-seeming volume and then drinks were brought out five minutes apart. We then had to remind our server of our appetizer order. Our server seemed nice enough though and we weren't in any rush, but it's what's keeping this review from 5 stars. Overall, would definitely recommend giving this place a shot. The food seems amazing, the chips and guac were delicious, and the manhattan was one of the best I've had.",0,0,0,Chris L.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,8,5
5.0,4/24/2018,"I used to come to El Toro Blanco once in a while for the ambience, (think Pulp Fiction) which I absolutely love. The food was okay; somewhat traditional Mexican; never understood the unseasoned ground beef tacos in hard shells like my brother and I used to make when our parents were out. But things have changed here:The outdoor patio was packed Saturday night as my husband and I walked by with some friends, so we decided to walk in. Inside was busy too, vibe still very cool; casual, such great lighting. We had drinks in the bar area while we waited about 20 minutes for a table. Standouts were a hibiscus and lemon concoction, and a jalapeno flavored margarita.When we sat down and looked a the menu, we were thrilled to see that they have upped their game; a new menu included some very interesting vegetarian options, in addition to classics like skirt steak tacos, and short ribs.I ordered the charred butternut squash tacos, my husband had the marinated skirt steak with a goat cheese enchilada, one friend had mahi mahi tacos. Please excuse the superlatives, but I live for good food and this was outstanding. The sides added new flavors and interest; mine included baby beets and queso fresco, one had a very nice slaw, and my husband's tortillas tasted homemade. So exciting to see some experimentation with the food, while still nodding to some traditional Mexican dishes. When I am making an effort to go to out and paying for food, especially in a food town like New York, I always hope, (expect), an interesting experience and food that I can't have at home.

4.0,4/8/2018,"Came here for my girlfriends birthday, the place was crowded for a Thursday night. We started our meal with the guacamole/chips and the waiter had recommended to me the Smokey-piña margarita, the margarita was phenomenal and the guac was good but little bland. Next we ordered an array of tacos: Al Pastor, Tinga de pollo and Baja Fish (grilled sword fish). The tacos were good but similar to the guacamole they lacked seasoning. Finally, the service crew brought out our desserts, churros with chocolate and dulce de leche sauces and a coconut tres leches cake with a candle in it. The churros were spectacular, however, the tres leches was more of a coconut cake then a tres leches. In closing the food was good but not spectacular and the service was absolutely fantastic.",1,0,0,Paul G.,"Jamaica, NY",341,205,234
2.0,3/26/2018,"My wife and I have come here many times over the last couple of years. The menu seemed radically changed the last time we were there -- many more ""hip"" takes on Mexican food (""cauliflower al pastor,"" ""charred butternut squash tacos""), and they have dropped many of the traditional dishes.I don't have a problem with some experimentation, but there was not an ounce of spiciness in the whole thing. The guacamole was depressingly disappointing: we ordered it to be somewhere between medium and hot, and it wasn't anything, just bland.  (As of February 2018, a new chef was brought in to overhaul the menu, and it shows -- frankly any review on here prior to February 2018 should now be taken with a grain of salt.)And somehow the interior seemed noisier than it had been before (it was hard to have a conversation without yelling), though who knows if that's just specific to this visit. Altogether the sentiment both my wife and I had was disappointment -- it kind of ruined our evening, to be honest. Which I know sounds extreme (and is frankly pretty uncommon for us!). We might try it again another time, but for the price the food was (to our palettes) considerably degraded compared to what it had been before, and there are lots of other interesting options in the neighborhood. The hostesses continued to be very nice; we had no serious complaints about the service (the kitchen made some kind of mistake with our order but the hostess/manager resolved it fine). The menu overhaul should be... overhauled. The last thing Mexican food should be is bland.",0,0,0,Alex W.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,11,0

I came here with my cousins last weekend and we got chips and guac (best guac I have ever had in my life), chicken enchiladas, and the owner gave us a free dessert! (Some sort of banana pastry and it was amazing). We also got margs...I got a strawberry marg and it was out of this world.

4.0,1/22/2018,"My friend and I walked in and as expected the restaurant was crowded on Friday evening. The hostess asked if we had reservations (we didn't) she offered to place us on the waitlist, which was a 45 minute wait. We went over to the bar to converse. I would say within 20-25 minutes he received a message on his phone stating that we could be seated. We were seated in an elevated area but after a few minutes we were told (the host was completely apologetic) the entire area was reserved (30th birthday celebration). The host walked us over to another table which was in a tight area but we wiggled our way past some other patrons and sat down. The service was pretty good. The waiter was attentive.  We got the small order of chips with fresh guacamole and trio of salsa. The lobster soft shell tacos we both ordered were a little sparse with actual lobster but had a huge piece of avocado in each taco. We also order Elote (Mexican street corn) minus the cob (comes in a small ramekin with a spoon). Which I would assume makes less messier to eat and clean up.  He ordered a strawberry margarita and I a La Flor margarita.  My La Flor has some smoky notes, his was sweet but not overbearing.  After our main meal we offered a dessert menu I had never tried Churros before (as many times as I seen Mexican women selling these by some train station; I was never curious enough to or had the time to stop and actually purchase a churro to see what that taste like). I was not disappointed, these cinnamon & sugar churros are good with the chocolate & dulce de leche sauces!!! mmmmm You have to try!!!!!The atmosphere is quite nice, lights are dimmed but not to the point of you can't see where you are going. There is contemporary music playing, it is not obnoxiously loud. There are 2 unisex bathrooms in the rear past the curtains.

But considering that the side dish was my favorite part.... the rice is not cooked fully, the black beans watered down, the veggie tacos were decent not too flavorful.

My only issue with this place is that everything took incredibly long, our waitress got our drinks and took pretty long to come back get our food orders, which then took long to come out, and after we paid it took long for her to return with our change, I felt as though she was the only one there at the time and she might have been overwhelmed, which didn't result in her treating us badly but it did take long, other than that great food!",0,0,0,Evelyn V.,"Kenner, LA",1,29,3

The restaurant was not crowded, but it is large so while there were many patrons, it didn't feel overwhelming. We started off with a round of tap water (I read they charge you for bottled, which doesn't bother me, NYC has the greatest tap!), as well as an order of spicy guacamole (you can order mild, medium, or spicy) and their green chili queso fundido with chorizo.The small order of guacamole was SMALL. Since we were all sharing, it was a good amount, but for the $15 it cost, and it's covered in pico, seemed a little steep. The green chicli queso fundido with chorizo was wonderful! So warm and creamy, and it was served with warm flour tortillas. It wasn't spicy at all, so I may ask for it to be spicer next time.I ordered the Camarones en Barbacoa tacos, which was served with rice and beans. The rice and beans were not memorable. Definitely needed some adobo, garlic, something. The shrimp tacos were good! Lots of thick and meaty shrimp that was cooked well.

5.0,8/17/2017,"After two wonderful experiences at El Toro Blanco I felt compelled to write a review. First off, both times my party had Miguel as our waiter. He was friendly, prompt, knowledgable, and all around a great server. The manager Patrick also stopped by our table to make sure we were enjoying everything and was extremely personable. I don't think we've been disappointed by anything we have tried here. First off the frozen margaritas are amazing, I also had the Smokey Pina which had such a unique flavor. The guacamole was freshly made and a perfect starter while deciding on the rest of our meals. The real knockouts were the tuna ceviche and the mexican corn side dish, they completely blew us away. We also tried almost every type of taco on the menu and had zero complaints. Also the warm churros are the perfect light dessert to share to satisfy the after dinner sweets craving.",1,0,0,Meg G.,"Manhattan, NY",4,21,0

My only complaint is the tuna to cucumber ration is a bit off. I found myself trying to dig around for tuna pieces. Also, the prices are steep. 18 dollars for this ceviche. We also tried the guac which was pretty good but nothing to rave about especially for $15/$28My boyfriend tried the tamal oaxaqueño as an app and it was delicious. Small, meant for one person. For entrees we both had tacos. I tried the steak and he had the cabrito. My steak tacos were $18!!! Thats $9 per taco, absolutely ridiculous especially since nor his nor mine were anything special. My steak was missing seasoning and the pico de gallo was overpowering of the dish. His tacos were $14 and he was just as disappointed as I was. Their happy hour monday- friday 4-6:30pm offers beef, al pastor and tinga de pollo tacos for $6-$7 for an order of 2 which is more up my alley.

We decided to choose this eatery since I had parked literally in front of this place and the meter maid was like a worker bee, waiting to catch any victim who had an expired meter ticket.The staff was extremely pleasant. It wasn't busy but at least it wasn't empty either; I like to see a place with some customer action. They were nice and professional. No issues there.I did find the some food items to have exorbitant prices hence why the tacos were appealing; it was cheaper.They also have a kids menu; my son got chicken fingers with fries. My friend and I order soft tacos or better known as ""tacos de la casa"". We chose the Baja fish type; I ordered swordfish and she ordered the crispy cod. For drinks, the name was ""de amaro"" or something like that but that drink was on point!!!!!! It was tequila infused with pineapple, lime and other nice things. El toro got nice bartenders!!! I bet their happy hour is lit, lol.The food was okay; we did request more alolit dressing because the tacos tasted dry but I must say it was very fresh fish. My friend and I tried both and I don't think I had a favorite since they were both good.I wasn't feeling my son's chicken fingers.

Service service service.  I am so wow-ed by the friendly service and pride in their restaurant of the staff here. To start, one of the off duty employees Craig was at a nearby bar where we played pool/ doubles with them; hearing my friend order me a Mezcal drink told us he worked at a nearby Mexican restaurant - here - that made amazing Mezcal drinks.Craig originally from the south hasn't lost his southern hospitality and happily walked us to this restaurant where he introduced us to the manager and very friendly servers there setting us up with even more southern type hospitality here in the Village.  I felt like we were on another very happy planet outside NYC.  The waiters and manager were also amazingly friendly, happy and really took pride in the restaurant. The food and drinks. Outstanding. - Mezcal old fashioned with chocolate bitters was definitely among if not thee top mezcal drinks I've had, and loving my mezcal that says a lot.-  Trio of sauces with a spicy one and chips were a wonderful start - Made to order guacamole was fresh and delicious - Lobster tacos.  These were mouthwatering - Lobster ceviche. This was a first and my favorite of everything we had. Chunks of lobster, perfectly flavored and went well with the chips.-  Shrimp ceviche. Also delicious though I preferred the sweeter lobster sauce in the lobster ceviche to the tomato based sauce in the shrimp ceviche and was so preoccupied with the lobster ceviche this took a back seat for me. - Grilled octopus. Wonderful, served over delicious flavored veggies.Ambiance.  Very nice and festive feeling on a Saturday night.  They also have a couple rooms great for small and medium sized private parties up to 30.Absolutely recommend as a wonderful restaurant for friends or a date.

He was still starving after he ate that tiny portion.As for myself I had the chopped salad with a guacamole dressing and I took an add-on of shrimp for four dollars.

They have removed the ""camarones al ajillo"" and the steak from the RW menu in their restaurant and the enchiladas that were ordered left much to be desired. The shrimp ceviche appetizer was mediocre, and the margarita pitcher we ordered came out to be $90! Never have I paid so much for a pitcher of margarita... if you must go here you're better off ordering from their regular menu. The ambience is lively and the good things from our dinner last night were: the beef empanadas, guac for the table, churros and the company. Service was not good or efficient, we waited over 30 minutes after we finished our entrees and had to flag down our waiter for some attention and to retire the plates from our table, we were ready for dessert a long time ago. We were seated a little before 9PM and did not leave until 12AM after finally sorting out the discrepancies in our bill. We were being charged over $530 when the total should've been way lower than that and that includes the overpriced pitcher of margarita. We each ended up paying more than we expected to for a RW experience. And its not just about the prices but also the overall dining experience, at the end of our night the floor manager on site, Elisa, came over to our table to ask if there was anything wrong with the service provided that night as we only left $6 tip.... which we did not, we left what was due given the total amount/service and it was due to the servers mistake of handling payment that led to that embarrassing misunderstanding.

I'm so happy I found this place on yelp.Let me start with a ""con"" for this restaurant. If you want to order from the happy hour menu, you have to sit at the bar. The bar looks like it's filled with a bunch of single people who are all chatting away only because they're all sitting at a bar. Which is great if you're into that kind of stuff, but I like my personal space. So we get our table, and our waiter comes over immediately. He's a very friendly guy and suggests an order of guacamole and margaritas for the table. Their guacamole came with a side order of three salsas and freshly made chips. That alone was so good and the waiter was attentive, he saw we were low on chips and refilled us right away!I had the shrimp tacos and Mexican street corn. I love that they took the corn off of the cob because that gets messy and I didn't want to get corn all over my face! Overall the food is amazing! The best Mexican food I've ever had! The way the restaurant is decorated was really lovely as well. It had a very nice ambiance. For dessert we had the churros and flourless chocolate cake. The churros were great but the chocolate cake not so much. I was really eyeing the banana pudding and last minute I changed my mind. If you're a chocolate lover, you might enjoy it. But it was a little too bitter and dense for my liking. Towards the end of our meal, it got a little crowded and our waiter became a little busy.

For once, a salad worth getting - beans, corns, cherry tomatoes, avocado, and tortilla strips - all the textures and flavors coming together - the indulging yet guiltless bite. The enchiladas were gooey and saucy - beyond delish! Since my up and coming beach bod has already been put on hold, why not have dessert? We shared one of my all time favs - tres leches cake.

1.0,5/26/2016,"This is my first review. Ever. I live in the west village, pretty close to this restaurant. I read all the reviews and found some people really like the food, I thought how bad could the service be? I planned a small party of 7  for my dad's birthday on a Saturday night. The restaurant was pretty empty, yet the service was absolutely embarrassing. We ordered a bunch of apps and each got a dinner, no one had any special instructions, seems easy. The appetizers were pretty bland and small, we ordered the queso, guac, and salsas. They didn't bring it with chips and took about 10 minutes to bring about 10 small chips in a bowl, one for each of us? WTF? We ordered pitchers of sangria once we sat down, they still hadn't shown up 40 min later. Then they brought white, we ordered red. WTF. I still wasn't deterred. We ordered dinner. 3 out of 7 were wrong and they were missing 1. The other meal didn't come out for over 20 minutes, and when it did it was raw. Blood dripping. My meal of beef tacos were bland but edible, however, a few of the meals were just digesting. If you order a steak medium rare, it should not be burnt and the consistency of jerky. If you order meat tacos, there should be meat, right? There was a teaspoon of beef in each of my tacos. So we watched another table get a dessert with a candle and the waiter brought out a fedora and sang happy birthday. So we ordered it, they brought out the single dessert with no candle. It was just sad and they kind of ruined it. When I said are you kidding me, I kid you not, the waiter took the sombrero off the other birthday goer and put it on our birthday boy. No candle.  To make up for their mistake, they brought out one comped churro for the table to split.  I felt terrible, I thought I planned a nice dinner and it was the biggest fail ever. We would have had a better outcome if we went to chipotle or Taco Bell.  I'm not a picky eater, but I'm not sure which restaurant the positive reviewers ate at.  Eat at el toro blanco at your own risk, but if you walk to 7th avenue there are some truly great Mexican restaurants like Diablo Royale. The food was pretty disgusting and the service was deplorable, but thanks for the comped churro, that also sucked!",0,0,0,Lady N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0

The guacamole tasted ok but i left more than 1/2 cause it was like sliced avocado, not mashed the way its suppose to be. I thought about getting tacos but it was 3 per order and they all had to be the same kind. And no steak tacos?? Really? No thanks. The best part was the bartender. He appeared  like he wanted no part of being there. Did not say ONE word to me the whole time i was there. Not that i want to talk to him, but a ""hello"" and a ""thank you"" after he gave me the check or when he saw me leave would've  been sufficient.

5.0,4/25/2016,"Who: West Villagers or lower Manhattan locals who know what they're doing.What: When you sit down, they bring out a bowl of homemade tortilla chips with three different salsas (have your water ready because one of them is deadly).  We started with medium spicy guacamole, which was a standard size for 2-4 people to share. El Toro Blanco provides a lengthy choice of entree and drink options.  I went with the salad. I had low expectations ordering a salad at a Mexican restaurant. Honestly, it was a really great salad, and seemed bottomless. Although I only went with a house margarita on the rocks, I would be lying if I didn't admit I was hopping a little bit of a buzz by the time I left. When: brunch and dinnerWhere: El Toro Blanco is located in the West Village. There is indoor and outdoor seating. I recommend sitting outside if possible. It's in a great spot to people-watch. Why (or why not): I was brought here by a former Texan who prides himself on eating only the 'finest' of Mexican cuisines. My expectations were high and they were met.

1.0,4/24/2016,"I don't know what happened to this place. I used to love coming here with friends. Last summer it was welcoming and vibrant. We used to come a few times a month. Now it's poorly run with a hostess and waitstaff who don't understand the nuances that go into creating a superior experience that leaves you wanting to come back. We came around 5:30, the restaurant was largely empty inside. The hostess seated us all the way in the back. No exaggeration-we passed an entire section filled with a few diners and rows of empty tables and were seated in a section with no people. I come to a restaurant to be social. And it felt intentional. To the point, I asked the hostess why we were seated in the back and she stared at me without a response. Instead of happily offering to seat us wherever, like most businesses concerned with customer service. After we asked to sit by the window, and were seated, the hostess came back and asked us to move because a large party was reserved that needed the table. Again. The entire back section was completely empty. And yet, the two of us had to move.She then seated us in a booth wedged between the kitchen and bathroom. We watched deliveries, waitstaff and people traveling to the bathroom, within inches of our table our entire meal. This is basic. If you ask a customer to move, you do something to make it better. Offer a drink, thank them... You don't put the customers in a worse position. Our server was poorly trained and the entire experience felt transactional. The bussers kept asking if we were done when we were visibly only halfway through our meal. As if they were just stopping by and asking without thinking about what they were doing. I'm disappointed. And I did notice on the way out the only patrons of color, including myself, were seated in the rear section. I don't care if this is intentional or not. It was obvious and not how it used to be at this restaurant. Not surprisingly, that large reservation never showed up. Our original table sat there empty throughout our meal.

Manager said if they had more blenders and made frozen drinks a lot the bartenders would be overwhelmed during happy hour... Well maybe they need better bartenders? Just odd... So we only had one drink each. Food was just ok.. The garlic fries were actually quite good. They gave us churros as a apology for non frozen margaritas-- total belly bombs... We both had apart stomach for the rest of the evening! They were really greasy. Anyway we won't be back, there are to many good Mexican places around.

Most of the chips stayed crispy under all that cheese and beans. I'd pass on getting chicken in this though, since there didn't seem to be much. And the chicken that I did get was only on the bottom of the pile- Empanadas (2 for $5): Tiny, but stuffed. The flavor is good, and it came with a sauce that tasted barbecue-y. - Tacos (2 for $5): we got the esquela vieja (old school) ones. I was pretty underwhelmed by them. They were okay, but nothing too amazing. Since we came here for Happy Hour, we sat in the front section which is pretty small compared to the rest of the restaurant.

But, she was REALLY training him, so our service was slooow especially at the getgo.  It took approximately 5 minutes for them to come to the table, which may seem overdramatic, but when you're as hungry as we were, every minute hurt.However, both she & her shadow were pleasant, offering us happy hour specials at the table when they usually are only at the bar.  That was cool!  But then we had a bit of a hiccup at the end...we were being a little annoying with our payment method as Anna's work would only cover her meal portion (not drinks), so as we were writing out our payment methods clearly/step by step, Anna caught the waitress rolling her eyes as she was walking by.  Proooooobably should've waited 'til the kitchen to do that.    And wouldn't that be a great training opportunity for the new server to learn how to split payments?  I decided not to hold it against her in my rating, though, as the rest of our interactions were quite pleasant.At the waitress's recommendation, we ordered the coconut margaritas.  Strong!!!  I was feeling buzzed after just one.  Then the guacamole came out, along with chips & a trio of salsas.  The mild guacamole was fresh & flavorful.  As for the salsas, I enjoyed the verde & the mild.  The mild did taste a little like marinara sauce?  Which was weird, but in a good way.  The spicy salsa was too much for me.The waitress did warn that the tacos we wanted were tapas sized plates, so they were best enjoyed with a side dish.  I opted for the plantains & Anna got the Mexican corn.  Now, in my mind, I was picturing corn on the cob which I love but assumed would be a mess.  Nope - it's fresh corn served in a dish, but topped with the traditional spices & cheese.  I only had a spoonful, but it was so dang good that I regretted not ordering it myself!  But I also did devour the plantains & the swordfish tacos.  Anna also had chicken tacos which she enjoyed.Overall, a happy experience!",3,2,2,Davina F.,"New York, NY",414,211,91

5.0,9/12/2015,"Looking for some grub on a Friday afternoon, about 4:30 PM, we stumbled upon this place amongst the dozens of other options near West Houston and 6th Avenue. The happy hour menu looked good but was only available at the bar, which is quite small. Luckily, since there were just two of us, we got a spot at the 'side bar' that faced a wall rather than the bartenders. I was concerned that the bartenders wouldn't pay us any attention, but was relieved when the bartender sought us out, took our orders, and made good drink recommendations. The drinks, themselves, were quite good. And the food was also excellent. Good portion sizes, and the happy hour food menu is unbeatable. $7 for a big bowl of guacamole, just $6 for a delicious skillet of queso fundido, and we had a taco pizza ($8, I think) that was bigger and more filling than we'd expected. All told, we had about four food dishes and seven drinks between us for less than $60 before tip. Service was stellar, in my opinion. We definitely beat the crowd, as the bar area started to fill around 5:30 PM (as is expected on a Friday afternoon at the end of summer), but it never felt oppressively full, and other patrons who stood and enjoyed their HH specials seemed unfazed by the close quarters. All in all, I would recommend this place for the HH specials. Can't beat the prices on food and drinks, and the service was very good. What more do you want? Might try their brunch and sit out on the sidewalk, which seems relaxing on a warm day with a cool breeze.",1,0,0,Colin M.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",76,9,0
2.0,9/8/2015,The cod tacos were super bland. I ordered in and had to assemble them myself which seemed unnecessary. I have no clue what differentiates this $6 taco (3 for $18) from any regular $3 taco. Also they have guacamole as an appetizer but they won't give you a side of it. That's totally nuts. I really love tacos and this entire experience left me sad and flummoxed. I can't believe they would do that to tacos...,0,0,0,C L.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",0,10,1
4.0,9/7/2015,"We went for brunch over labor day weekend and I am wondering why I have come for brunch before. It's hard to beat the deal here - you get a free brunch cocktail with your brunch entree!So we both had the raspberry tequila sangria. It was excellent, you could not taste the tequila but you could feel it.  My only complaint was it didn't have any fruit, it didn't really need it but it would have been nice.  I should note that we were originally going to order the frozen coconut margaritas but they weren't frozen yet. On to the food - we had the chilaquiles and enchiladas. Both were large portions and very good. The chilaquiles was a little dry so we ask for some of the green salsa and that problem was solved. As I mentioned portions are large so you don't really need sides or apps. We ordered the plantains but barely touched them.

4.0,8/29/2015,"The QUESO!!!! OMG this place is so good. I always want to call it overrated because of the neighborhood and price point and annoying hostess station (always!) but it's really really delicious. The queso is served in a cast iron skillet; it's not the drippy Frito-Lay kind but a firm, spongey, perfectly-broiled pan of high-quality cheese with pico de gallo and other herbs.My second favorite is the Mexican pizza; we got it topped with shrimp and it was crispy and flat with queso, a generous portion of very fresh shrimp, drizzled with crema. We also got the lobster ceviche which is fresh and delicious of course. And the guacamole is always awesome; fresh, of course, with big chunks of avocado and a generous portion.Drinks including margaritas always on point as well.Sitting outside on a nice day as heavenly; sitting inside is nice to except the music is sometimes loud and random (90s rap?

I had to really restrain myself from being rude to them, especially when the bus boy just basically hauled off our half-eaten guacamole without asking. We even paid after the third ""done with that?"" in case the waiter was waiting for his tip, but no, this did not appease them.

3.0,7/6/2015,"Went for a short notice early Friday (holiday) dinner (7PM ish). Had no problems getting a table as the interior was pretty empty although the outside dining area was pretty full. They were nice enough to give my friend and I a table normally for 4 on request since we usually order quite a but of food and the standard 2 persons tables were kind of small.Guacamole Clasico: Very good. The guacamole tested very fresh while the flavors of the different component blended nicely. Probably made and let sit for a bit before serving and not made per order, which is perfect. I think the chips are homemade, very substantial and didn't break easily if you used them to scoop up big portions of guagamole. Also chips got instantly refilled after the first bowl was finish even before we had a chance to ask. The 3 salsas on the side were quite nice as well although I think the hottest one could have use a little more kick.Green Chili Queso Fundido (with chorizo): Came out on a hot little cast iron skillet with a basket of mini tortillas. Great consistency when served; definitely something you want to eat right away because once it cools it solidifies up and isn't as pleasant anymore. I would definitely recommend getting the chorizo with it as I felt the cheese alone could have used some more salt.Pescado Cod Tacos: Kind of disappointed with the portion size. They weren't that much larger than the mini tortillas that came with the Queso. And with only a small piece of fish on each and just two tacos per order, definitely not worth it. The batter itself was fried very nicely but I wish the fish itself was a bit more tender.Sides:The Mexican Street Corn was probably the highlight of my meal and I would definitely get 2 orders next time. Corn was a great combination of sweet and salty and a whole mix of different flavors that I'm at a lost of words to describe.The Mexican Red Rice was kind of boring. Just typical red rice with nothing special done to it or added to it. I would skip it. It wasn't bad, but just not worth the $6 or the stomach space.Spicy Garlic Fries were good but in all honestly you can't really mess up garlic fries. Not really spicy at all though, but one of the sauces had just a little bit of kick (very lacking though). If you really want fries, you could do worse to order this but I highly recommend the corn over it and I'd rather try some other sides first.Was a bit disappointed that they didn't have the fried brussels sprouts although I wasn't surprised because I was told a week earlier at another restaurant that they're out of season and not currently offered on the menu. Better than having the restaurant use frozen brussels sprouts I guess.Overall kind of expensive for the food. While the food wasn't bad, you could definitely get equal or better quality for a lot less. Service was good although it was a slow period. I would go back purely for the corn and the guacamole.

We got the guac to share, ""Colorado"" variety (chipotle, grilled corn, queso fresco). All 3 looked great, though. Tasty, but good guac is easy to come by.Then we got some taco plates to share, family style: beef, chicken, shrimp, and swordfish. All were very tasty, though pretty small with 2 tacos per order, and prices hovering in the $10-14 range per plate. My buddy came later and ordered a Mexican-style pizza, which was the most satisfying and best value of the meal.We also had a couple of Mexican ""craft"" beers (though they're actually produced by Tecate, the same way Coors makes Blue Moon).

First of all, they sat us in a back room with a curtain that separated us from the rest of the restaurant right next to the bathroom. Then they completely forgot about us for a half hour and after finally giving our drink orders it took forever to get our drinks. At this point we made them take our food order and I requested them to rush the food which surprisingly didn't take forever but the worst part is yet to come. The food was mediocre and the drinks weren't special but the pricing was high for what they were serving. Not worth one penny. Finally we had to hunt someone down to receive our check and waiting another 15 minutes to get someone to take the check back. At this point we were 6 people and put $175 in cash toward our $226 bill and requested that $50 be put on one card and $50 on another. We were generous enough to leave them a tip in cash. A waiter came and took the check and brought it back with no cash back and charged $100 on each of the two cards! At this point we were livid but assumed it was just a mistake so we calmly explained the situation and they came back and said they negated the charges and only charged the $50 on each card (which is not true because now we have $150 charge on our cards several days later). But he still didn't bring us back a single dollar of the cash they owed us. At this point I requested to speak to a manager and after another 15 minutes of nothing they sent another waitress over who said we didn't leave that much in cash and made up some random figure that we left in cash. It's absurd because we are 6 people and we counted the cash several times before giving in the check. She rudely gave me back $30 instead of the $50 she owes us and said that we were wrong for even doubting her staff. I have never been treated so rudely in my life! Clearly someone was trying to pocket the cash and screw us on the credit cards and the fact that they never sent me a manager to speak to is just absurd. I not only will never go back but I will make sure I will take this up with their management and tell every single person I know about this disgusting place.

2.0,10/17/2014,"So very confused about why this place has a pretty decent rating. It's a nice place, I'll give it that, and I wish that I would be willing to come back. My SO is huge on Mexican food so I thought I'd stop by on my way home to pick up some food. After confusion between the bar and the host station about whose job it was to take my order, I finally placed my order (some tacos and chips at salsas) at the bar. The waiter tells me it will be 8 minutes brings me a bill and I tell him I'll pay right away. I pay him, he goes to the register, and then he walks off. He assumed my change was his tip, which may have been my fault for not saying I need change back, but I also found it incredibly rude of him to assume instead of asking. I would have tipped him, but not the amount he kept.I stand around awkwardly and in the way, waiting for my food as they offer me nowhere to wait, my 8 minutes turn into 20, still no food. I'm a little miffed. I LEAVE TO BUY FLOWERS, come back, still no food. I've been waiting about 40 minutes. Finally, a woman comes out with my food, repeats the order, the tacos have something on them they shouldn't, she takes them back and I immediately regret opening my mouth. It takes about another 5 minutes before I can leave. It should not have taken that long.I get home and give the food to my SO, hoping it would have been worth the wait. I'm a vegetarian, so I can't tell you how the tacos tasted, but I can tell you that they were the smallest and sorriest tacos I'd ever seen. They were literally the length of my palm. The chips and salsa were equally sorry with a dish full of tasteless tortilla chips and three tiny condiment cups of tasteless salsas. I regret thinking this place was a good idea and regret parting from my money. Like I said, I wish this place had better food because it looks like a cool place to hang out, but overall bad staff and bad food.",1,0,0,Luna S.,"Jersey City, NJ",6,12,0

Have to give credit to our waiter was so nice and kind but had mad the mistake of telling us the chef was not present that day but everything was still awesome which tells you everyone is well trained and on top of their game. The guacamole was great!! I had originally ordered the wild mushroom empanadas as my main course but they ran out instead I ordered the grilled octopus tacos which were outstanding. Just a little warning if you order tacos or empanadas as a main dish the portions are a little small so you might want to order two which still won't damage your wallet or you and your group could order a bunch of different things and go tapas style.

2.0,8/17/2014,"The tacos at El Toro Blanco were pretty good but nothing to write home about. Better than your average street cart? Yeah, probably a little bit better, but not by much. The meaty slices of avocado on the tacos helped. Plus the homemade corn tortillas are really tasty. But this place is way too expensive. Two very tiny tacos for $12. A pint of Modelo Especial is $7. The fancy cocktails are $14. I had the tacos al pastor and tacos de cabrito (suckling goat), with esquítes (""street corn"") and a michelada (the michelada was on the money). Everything was very good, but I've had much better Mexican fare elsewhere. Off the top of my head I can think of three places I've had better tacos al pastor in the past month: Tacos No. 1 in Chelsea Market (do yourself a favor and go there ASAP), Tehuitzingo in Hell's Kitchen, and the Super Tacos truck on 96th and Broadway.For comparison, just one $4 taco at Tacos No. 1 in Chelsea Market is bigger than two tacos for $12 at El Toro Blanco, and they are way, way better. The tacos al pastor at ETB can't hold a candle to those. I really don't think the ambience of this place makes up for the high priced fare (which is why I chose to go with two stars instead of three), but all-in-all it was an enjoyable meal. This is New York City, and I understand it's expensive, but if you're going to charge me $12 for tacos you'd better deliver on them and impress me.",0,0,0,Joe S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,30,0

This main course was camarones en mojo de ajo which is simply shrimp with a bunch if garlic over rice. We also had the bistec mexicano. Both entrees were delicious but nothing to write home about. Really... The elote verde made my night. They have some wonderful spicy mixed drinks that involve habanero flavor.

The hostesses were really friendly when we walked in and had the option of an indoor or outdoor seating (I recommend outdoor when it's nice out because it's in such a great area but the inside has a good ambiance and atmosphere as well!)  The waiters and staff were great too and made sure they left room in between each course to allow us time to eat and talk.We started off with some delicious frozen strawberry margaritas ($10) and appetizers of empanadas and queso fundido.  The empanadas were nothing to write home about but came with a really good mole/barbeque sauce that we used for our other plates.  The queso fundido was pretty standard but the wait staff brought us more tortillas when we ran out which was nice. After reading reviews I'm a little disappointed we didn't get the guacamole but oh well!For our entrees we had been eyeing this ""mexican pizza"" which I think they called a cheese crisp that was on basically every table when we walked in and definitely decided to order that...boy I'm glad we did.  Delicious open-faced quesdillas with crema, cheese, tomatoes, peppers, and your choice of protein if you want.  We also order chicken enchiladas.  They were good for a nicer Mexican restaurant but not the best ones I've ever had.  To finish it off, we order some solid churros and I left feeling very satisfied and full!Overall, while it's more ""Americanized"" Mexican, it's definitely a good choice for dinner in the West Village.",0,0,0,Kate H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,0

They drizzle some cheese/crema on top and give you this green sauce to also dip them in.  I poured the green sauce and hot sauce on the empanada and it was great.Hongos Tacos (mushroom) - these were pretty good as well, but extremely small. They're not too expensive and you get two, so I knew they were going to be small.  As with most veggie tacos, they get messy, even though they're only a few bites because there's a lot of water/juice from the veggies that are in it that just drip.  It only takes like 4-5 bites to finish it, and I doused it with hot sauce too.Enchiladas de la Casa (vegetarian) - these were also very good and authentic.  Our waiter knew we were splitting them, so he brought them out in different hot plates, which I thought was very courteous of him - saved us the time of splitting them and putting them on our own individual plates.  There was a lot of broccoli in the enchiladas, but other than that, they were great.Sides - rice (came with the enchiladas), refried beans, and corn - all were amazing.  The rice and beans tasted great together and who doesn't love Mexican street corn?!Overall, an awesome restaurant and glad I went.  I've never heard of the place until I came across it as one of the restaurants for Restaurant Week and I'm very happy I didn't end up getting the RW menu.  I'll definitely have to come back again.",1,0,0,Sunny S.,"Philadelphia, PA",136,386,145

3.0,3/31/2014,"I finally made it here for dinner, which is unfortunate since I bet it would've been a lot better a few years ago when it opened, before the recent wave of excellent Mexican food that has started to hit NYC.With the excellent Mission Cantina being the best among them, along with great places specializing in just tacos, like Los Tacos No. 1 and Otto's Tacos, the tacos here are just nowhere near as good. Some of the other food is ok, but not quite worth the pretty high prices (please note that although I am known to order this much for the two of us at times, we were actually out with another couple this time):- Guacamole ($12)This was as standard as it gets, nothing particularly memorable, except that it was a pretty small bowl for $12. The chips were decent.- Sonoran Cheese Crisp with Chicken ($15)Probably the best thing we tried, this was like a kind of pizza, a large, round cracker thin pie, topped with lots of cheese and some strips of chicken, which you can add for a surcharge. The crisp in the name is actually misleading though as it was pretty soft and flimsy, but the flavor was at least very good.- Costillas Empanadas ($11 for 3)These were also very tasty - piping hot golden brown empanadas filled with juicy short rib.- Escuela Vieja Tacos ($9 for 2)For those that didn't take Spanish in middle or high school, this means ""old school"" tacos, I guess referring to the fact that they are hard shell (as opposed to the soft shell that all of the other choices come in). The shell indeed tasted like the ones your mom might buy from the store for Taco Tuesday dinner, so though the steak filling was tasty, I would skip these.- Baja Fish Tacos ($10 for 2)These were better - crispy fish tacos in a soft shell. The fish and abundant amount of avocado were great, but even these soft shells were not very good. Compared to the masa tortillas and other soft shells at some of the aforementioned places, these are completely flavorless. The rest of the ingredients were tasty though, so these are worth a try.- Pollo en Mole Coloradito ($23)This was the one entree the two of us split; and it was pretty good. It came with both rice and warm tortillas, so you had options for eating the chicken with. The mole sauce was a little bland, but overall it was a tasty dish.- Mexican Street Corn ($5)This was a good side, especially if you like the taste of this corn and are too lazy to get messy eating it on the cob. This was just a whole bowl of the sweet kernels with plenty of that delicious seasoning and cheese.- Cinnamon & Sugar Churros ($8)There was a pretty good dessert menu with tons of choices, and we made a solid dent in it.  First up, these Churros were massive, and unlike any I've tried (not necessarily a good thing). Instead of the satisfying, chewy texture I was expecting, they were pretty crumbly. As we tried to dip them in the chocolate and dulce de leche sauces on subsequent bites, they fell apart more and more, leaving several bits of churro in the sauces. I prefer the more solid kind to these too flaky, overly sticky masses.- Tres Leches Cake ($8)This was also very different from most good tres leches cakes I've had, and definitely not in a good way. This slice had some caramelized bananas on top, which did not add anything good to the flavor. The cake itself did not taste like 3, let alone even 2 milks were used in the making of the cake. It didn't have that nice spongy, light taste. Skip this one.- Chocolate Tacos ($8)As a chocolate lover, I would say this was easily the best dessert. This may very well have been one of those Choco Tacos you get at the supermarket (I'm not sure since I've never actually tried one of those), but whatever the source may be, these were delicious.Service was pretty good and everybody was very friendly. The food was ok, but just not good enough to justify those prices or a return visit. It's better suited for a loud girls' night type of affair, where the majority of the party is drunk enough to be able to think the food is a lot better than it actually is.",14,5,7,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834

3.0,3/10/2014,"The visit of El Toro Blanco at noon of last Thursday was delightful.  I love it when I get smoothly escorted to my table right after checking into a restaurant with a prior reservation, and that exactly what the case was at El Toro.  Such a happy environment it was as vibrant colors witnessed throughout the spacious and stylish retro dining room, with the orange dominating the interior while vivid red-toned wood placements added another artsy texture.  ""This is very exciting!"" I told my friend who had been enjoying some Restaurants Week visits with me.  I would not hide the fact my excitement to be in El Toro Blanco derived from the unconditional love dwelled within towards everything Mexican food.During the traditional Mexican lunch experience, we shared an order of Costillas Empanadas and another of Elote Verde Tamale.  The empanadas arrived in a portion of two pieces that were stuffed with slow roasted (beef) short rib, oaxaca cheese and a side of ancho barbecue sauce with a bit of cream.  Both pieces were of a good size (an adult small hand palm kind of size, if that helps!), and the taste of the already-barbecued pulled short rib was full of flavor with just the right amount of spice.  Simply delicious.  The side sauce served was unneeded, in my opinion, as the empanadas were moist and juicy.  The vegetarian tamale, served as one large piece on a corn leaf, was not stuffed but rather topped with roasted poblano chili, queso fresco, green chili salsa and cream.  The taste was nice, but did not make it to great.  I was not in favor of the thick texture of the tamale, but the green chili salsa was a memorable addition.  I found mixing the barbeque salsa (served as a side with empanadas) with the tamale added another dimension to the corn-based starter (just sayin'!).  As for the entrees, two orders were made: Enchiladas de Pollo, and Crispy Fish Tacos.  The two enchiladas were fully stuffed with well-seasoned pulled roasted chicken, while covered in cheese and salsa verde, with a side of poblano rice (fried rice with poblano peppers and corn).  The salsa verde was absolutely fantastic as its tanginess was well paired with its garlic-y and earthy side (cilantro, that was).  The platter was so hearty that half way through I felt I was not really sure if there was a space left within for the tacos, or even the desserts (yes, with an ""s""!).The three fish tacos were beautifully served with Mexican red rice and frijoles refritos (refried beans).  Each corn taco was stuffed with a small piece of fried fish that had a nice crust (but the piece was small.  I mean, too small), and filled (to compensate for the small fish piece, maybe?) with shredded reddish, cilantro, jalapeno aioli and some slaw.  The dish was fully enjoyed, however; I cannot say it was anything memorable.          The desserts were a truly nice, and very creative, ending to a wonderful company I had that day.  I cherished the brilliance in marrying a citrus salad with an all-time-classic flan.  Not only was it refreshing, but also it was artsy both in presentation and depth of taste.  The flan had a crusty top (""A""-m-a-z-i-n-g) that was sprinkled with crispy flakes of candied almonds.  The powerful character of the flan made it possibly difficult, in theory, for the Mexican Chocolate Cake to shine.  However, that was not the case (Hallelujah!!!).  The molten-ish chocolate cake was chili spiced, for a change.  That in itself made it utterly special (if only the cake was warm enough, the taste could have been fantastic).  Though the cake came with some crispy cinnamon-and-sugar-coated churros (fried sticks of dough), I believe that the dish could have done great without them (let alone the funny look the cake had with the stencils-like hat).El Toro Blanco is a very nice Mexican spot in the Village that seemed to be famous in that neighborhood, as the restaurant was almost full during that day.  It certainly has a character and an area that fits for both people who might be after meals, or solely seeking drinks (they have happy hours specials, too).  Service is friendly and prompt (although it gets a bit ""distracted"" when the place gets very busy).  The restaurant has a welcoming environment for solo diners, groups or families with kids.  I know I am going back again (a brunch, maybe?), and I am looking forward to my next visit.(Review of El Toro Blanco Lunch Visit on Thursday, March 6th, 2014)P.S.

And a good thing too, because I surely do love a margarita. I sat at the bar, mainly for drinks, and a snack to go with it.I ordered the El Toro (el jimador blanco, lime, agave, orange), and had them add in some habanero for spice. This margarita on the rocks has a great taste, smooth, and an excellent heat. A drink that cools you off and warms you up at the same time. Then, you have to order their Guacamole, made fresh to order with warm chips and a trio of salsas. The chips are warm, fresh and have an awesome crunch.

4.0,1/26/2014,"IN SHORT: A restaurant and tequila bar that does its food and drink true justice. Although the space is small and loud, and although flavor tends to run on the mild side, it's a perfect option for the young and young at heart.THE STORY: I'm never one to turn down elevated Mexican food, and El Toro Blanco is absolutely no exception. Portions are small and the plates are cheap, and an amazing freshness in the ingredients is highlighted in every dish. The guacamole is excellently refreshing, although it might benefit from another teaspoon of salt. The appetizers here truly shine, so don't hold back on ordering a round for the table. The Empanadas are the perfect sharing size, and the thin, crispy dough will have you immediately craving another bite. The Champiñones are particularly outstanding, filled with cremini mushrooms, huitlacoche (our favorite Mexican fungus), epazote, and queso oaxaca. The Sonoran Cheese Crisp is what you get when you breed a pizza with a quesadilla, and features a dark, crispy, thin tortilla base, a ton of Mexican cheese, poblano rajas, and roasted tomatoes. I was only left wishing that I had gotten a little more heat to balance out the great textures and creamy flavors.The Baja Fish Tacos and Ceviche are also light and fresh, fitting the menu perfectly. I thoroughly enjoyed the Grilled Swordfish tacos, served in two corn tortillas filled with citrus slaw, avocado, radish, cilantro, and jalapeño aioli, which somehow wasn't spicy enough for my taste. Still, you leave feeling as if you filled up with something good for yourself, satisfying every craving for contemporary Mexican.At 8 PM on a Friday night the restaurant will have just filled up, but show up any time before and there won't be any issue getting a table (this might not have been true a year ago, but the novelty of light Mexican in the West Village has finally worn off). Ideal for small tables of 2 to 4, slightly larger groups (up to 6 or 7) can still be accommodated easily with a reservation made ahead of time. Although the restaurant is loud, with music screaming along the walls of the bar, service is very good-natured, and a quick kitchen will complete a welcoming visit.All in all, El Toro Blanco is a stylish restaurant that serves up small, elegant plates that keep you safely in the bounds of what you know about Mexican food.",1,1,1,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245

Though FYI, don't expect it to be (in any way) spicy if requested to be. The accompanying trio of salsas are also on point -- I'm a fan of the spicy orange (habanero?) one!- Alambre con Huevo: Basically a skirt steak fajita served in a sizzling cast-iron, topped with sunny-side up egg and tortillas on the side. Good portion of meat, went well with the Guac & Salsas left over from the appetizer above.- Queso Fundido: This was my co-worker's entrée and as I'm lactose-intolerant, I wasn't much help in eating this one.

Another reason why you should get the Guac & Chips to share.I liked that there was a variety of brunch offerings (not just huevos rancheros, breakfast burritos, and tamales!), all of which sound -- at least on paper -- delicious.

4.0,10/14/2013,"This place has received rather mixed reviews since its opening, thus I had wanted to wait several months before checking it out. El Toro Blanco fits well into the nouveau Mexican cuisine that's sweeping across the city, offering a diverse menu of small plates for easy sharing, a few large plates for the heartier appetite, and of course a lot of tequila. The bf and I visited recently during brunch, to a rather relaxed and mostly unfilled dining room. I was glad to see that the brunch menu at ETB extends beyond your typical offering of eggs; sure, the obligatory huevos rancheros are breakfast burrito can be found on the menu, but you can also get ceviches, queso fundido and tamales that are right off the regular dinner menu. While the traditional chips and guacamole sounded tempting, we decided to switch it up a bit and started with the elote verde tamale. What came out was a single tamale, already unwrapped from the corn husk, made with sweet corn masa and topped with fresh corn, roasted poblano, queso fresco crema and green chile salsa. While the unfilled tamale may seem strange to some, I actually appreciated that the centerpiece that was the tender steamed masa; the sweetness balanced by the salsa and crema. My al pastor tacos were quite good as well, two palm-sized corn tortillas filled to the brim with salty, sweet pork, a slice of grilled pineapple, avocado, onions and pasilla negro. While the pork could have been more tender, the meat was seasoned nicely and all the toppings worked well together that I still enjoyed each bite. The refried black beans I ordered on the side was hearty and fresh, a nice complement to the tacos on a chilly Saturday afternoon. The bf went with a more brunch-y option for his main, the chilaquiles con huevos served in a sizzling cast-iron. The slightly spicy guajillo salsa was flavorful and surprisingly complex, perfect slathered on the tortilla chips and topped with a mélange of gooey fried eggs, avocado, melted Mexican cheese, crema and pico de gallo. This may not be the most rustically authentic chilaquiles out there, but it certainly is the perfect cure if you ever needed to nurse a hangover.Is El Toro Blanco the best Mexican food in the city? No, not by a long shot. But it's a reasonable choice if you're looking for Latin flavors and a good time. The service is friendly and efficient, the space is well designed, and the prices are right for the neighborhood.",2,2,2,Cecilia Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",762,644,43

2.0,9/19/2013,"Lackluster at best. I really wanted to like this place but everything here is good except the food. When we first got seated I asked the server (cute Spanish girl with short, brown hair) if they had any happy hour specials and she said 'NO'. So we just ordered our drinks off the menu and carried on with our order. My friend and I shared the Cabrito (goat) tacos which were tiny but pretty good then shared the Sea Bass tamale as our entree. While it was great presentation, the fish was bland and lacked a lot of flavor. The 'masa' on the tamale was not great either and the salt/pepper were nowhere to be found. On the contrary, our dessert was pretty phenomenal actually and is the only item that kept me from giving it one star. The churros with the dipping sauces were melt in your mouth good. When the bill came however, there was a note with Happy Hour specials!! I was really annoyed that the server told us there weren't any when we walked in and when I called her on it her response was, 'Well you didn't order the drinks listed on that list"" and I was like, 'That's because you said there weren't any!' She totally denied such conversation took place and that alone would not merit a repeat visit. PROS: Great ambience, good looking people, awesome dessert, drinks are unique and strong.CONS: Bland food, $12 tacos are tiny, overpriced, our Server was stupid. I would possibly give it one more shot and come for brunch or drinks.",2,1,1,Daisy P.,"Manhattan, NY",72,172,0

1.0,8/31/2013,"Okay...So, this place was a HUGE let down. My business partner and I wanted a bite to eat and a drink after a meeting, and it looked like a promising spot. We were wrong. Majorly... Both of us have worked in restaurants and know about good service. This place could serve as a case study for how it shouldn't ever be done. We ordered two drinks and guacamole to start, and also placed out entree order at the same time. The fist thing to arrive were the entrees, then the drinks, and then the server came over and asked how everything was, apparently not realizing that our guacamole never came. First of all, the drinks should have come first, before anything. Secondly, don't act surprised that something didn't show up. You have 3 tables... If I were the server, and the guacamole was taking a while, I would not have let them send the entrees until the guacamole got there, and I would've actually made sure the drinks got there first. The service wasn't the only thing that was bad. My Bloody Mary (with tequila) was HORRIBLE. It was basically made with a can if crushed tomatoes, tequila, and a dirty piece of celery. I couldn't drink it through the straw because it was too thick, and even when I took the straw out, the ice was too much of an obstacle for the drink. I had to remove the ice to drink it (fill up my mouth with tomato) and then chew it. Really weak place... I'll go back, if every other restaurant in the city burns down.

The Queso Fundido is amazing, as is the guacamole. And the margaritas are tasty, too. The manager (dude with a beard) is super accessible and nice, and always finds an outdoor table near the railing so that we can dine with our dog.  The only complaint that I have is that we showed up on the 2nd night it was open, the owner (pudgy guy on the bicycle from Lure Fishbar) came and sat with us at our table and ordered a bunch of different food for us to try. It was super nice, and we were blown away by his generosity. But then we got the check at the end of the evening. It was extremely awkward that we were charged for a few appetizers we didn't order, which the owner had the kitchen send out for us to try.

3.0,7/1/2013,This was meh at best.  Food is more like 2.5 for me but it was a cute atmosphere.  Was excited about the Octopus tacos but they were nothing to write home about.  They were slightly overcooked (or under - whichever makes them chewy) without getting the perfect char that I was hoping for.  The accompanying filling in the tacos was not good.  There were very large slices of not ripe avocado that made it difficult to eat.  I can't remember what else was in it because it really didn't stand out.The queso fundido reminded me of a Midwest American dip.  Not sure if it was cream cheese mixed in with the Chihuahua cheese but it didn't help.  We ordered both the chile topped queso and the chorizo queso.  Both ended up being pretty bland for there being such flavorful toppings on it.  I think the cream cheese really muted the flavors.I was there with 6 other people and no one raved about their food so I think it was a pretty similar experience for everyone involved.  Will probably not go back unless it's just to hang out and have drinks.,2,0,0,Tiffany S.,"Brooklyn, NY",244,32,0

We had a 10:45 reservation after seeing a flick but decided to try a bit earlier, no prob. We were seated right away and all I can say is holy loudness. The acoustics in here are AWFUL! You have to scream to be heard and scream, is what all the birdies in there were doing...yikes. Our waiter was pleasant, if a bit of an up seller, but hey, everyone needs to make a buck. I started with their classic marg and it was a good one. I wanted to order the queso fundido but my date wanted the guacamole. We went with the guac and my only problem being is they brought everything out at the same time. I wanted the guac to start. They serve it with a small bowl of what I think are fresh chips and they're a touch greasy. Three salsas accompany the dish, mild, medium and hot. Mommy can stand some heat and the hot definitely gave me a run for mes money!!! We decided to try 3 different tacos, thanks to the nice couple next to us giving us tips on what they thought were the best bets. We tried the Al Pastor: spit roasted berkshire pork, pasilla negro, roasted pineapple & onion, avocado, queso cotija, the Tinga de Pollo: pulled roasted chicken,sweet and spicy tomatoes, chipolte queso oaxaca, avocado and the Baja fish tacos with crispy fish. Now our neighbors to the right liked them in the order I wrote but I'll have to say I liked the fish tacos the best, actually the ones I thought I would like the least and almost didn't order. The pork tacos have pineapple in them and that really overpowered any other flavor there was. The chicken was just OK but the fish was really good. There wasn't a fishy flavor at all and they were just simple. The over-ingredients of the others really did them no favors.

It was a gorgeous sunny day and we were seated in the upstairs area away from the windows and though the restaurant was 90% empty, the hostess was annoyed with us when we asked if we could move toward the windows because it was mostly four-tops. Also, they kept trying to take away our 3/4-eaten guacamole -- after the 3rd person tried to take it away I got annoyed. Same with my margarita. C'mon -- when I'm paying $12 for guac, let me finish it!Despite the 3, it's worth a return trip -- definitely for brunch and probably for dinner/drinks.",1,0,0,Adina R.,"Washington, DC",138,145,7

It was delicious!  Came with crispy tortilla chips, not too greasy or salty, but just right...The trio of salsas was good, but as several of my friends remarked, the curry salsa should come with a warning!  It was super hot, and 2 of the girls put big chipfuls in their mouth before recognizing their error (again, the problem when you can't hear each other across the table).  I can't say the salsas compare to Texas or the SW but they were good and I enjoyed the variety: traditional red salsa (v. mild), tomatillo-cilantro (med spicy), curry salsa (Hot!).  We shared the mole chicken tamale and the empanadas with short ribs (they added a 4th to the standard 3 so we could each have one...a nice touch).  Both were super flavorful with tender meat on the inside.  I went with the red snapper ceviche which was quite good, refreshing and light.  My friends had the chicken tacos (so-so), swordfish tacos (v. good), and mexican chopped salad (big fan).  Overall, this was a fun stop and the great atmosphere, drinks and decent food would definitely bring me back.",0,0,0,Kristina C.,"New York, NY",49,192,2

Didn't really taste jicama or fig.- Tequila - ridiculous list, just point and enjoyFood:- Guacamole - one of the better ones around.  great spice, not too blended, by far the best of the food we had- Ceviche w/Snapper - still mad at myself for not sending this back, but I don't really do that.  Possibly the worst ceviche I've ever had.  Barely any fish, mostly cucumber and tomato. Don't bother.- Cabrito Tacos - Good, but like some of the drinks bland.- Carnitas Michoacan - Ok, not a lot of flavor but no complaintsService: The bartenders were great.  The waiter that I did encounter was terrible, but possibly just due to how hectic it was in the place.Atmosphere - Crazy, packed and energetic.  This is really the selling point, and why I might go back.  It's hard not to have a good time when you have this, plenty of drinks and guac.Overall: There is better food elsewhere, but this place is ok.",0,0,0,David N.,"Manhattan, NY",12,16,0

He ended up waiting for 10 minutes before proceeding to look for us upstairs.The ambiance was a bit dingy and old school. The food was alright. Nothing to write home about. The guacamole was really fresh but could have used more lime and cilantro. The chips were excellent - had that homemade quality and were crispy. The trio of salsas which came out with the guac were pretty good (especially the middle green salsa, followed by the habanero salsa which was insanely spicy). For appetizers, we ordered the Elote Verde tamale which was pretty good, the tuna ceviche which was fresh and delicious, and the green chile queso fundido which was alright (the cheese didn't have the stringy quality it should in a good queso and it wasn't very tasty). For our mains we ordered the tostada chopped salad, a few tacos, and the pollo en mole coloradito. They were all average. We ordered a couple of rounds of the mango chile margheritas (the spicy salt rim was the best part) and the regular margherita. I think I preferred the regular margherita with the spicy salt rim (I had to ask for this specifically).

Both experiences were the same- not bad, but not great either.While I am a big fan of Burger & Barrel, one of my most favored cuisines is Mexican. And sadly, this place just didn't cut it. I tried to be open minded but it was hard not to subconsciously compare the food to that of Suenos, La Esquina, Ofrenda, Mole or even Dos Caminos for that matter. And now for the details... The first time we sat at a table and then last night we chose to sit at the bar. It was incredibly packed for a Sunday evening but overall I would say the service was pleasant- no complaints there. The margaritas were weak, but that's sort of par for the course in Manhattan if you ask me. The guacamole was fine and the housemade tortilla chips were warm and crispy. Next, the short rib empanadas were just blah. They honestly just didn't taste like anything. The Sonoran cheese crisp was tasty- but as I believe another yelper said, it's kind of hard to screw up a crispy shell with hot cheese on it. Now for the tacos... the ground beef tacos really didn't taste like anything. I could not taste any seasoning or spice whatsoever. The El Pastor tacos (pork) were fine- but again, just not memorable. I will say however that the mexican street corn was amazing- very good. In conclusion, it's not a horrible place by any means but it's certainly not going to blow your mind.

2.0,12/24/2012,"No restaurateur in New York elicits more confusion from me than John McDonald. I'm a huge fan of Burger & Barrel. I found Lure to be little more than a hype factory of Meatpackers slurping oysters with overpriced, mediocre seafood abounding. But El Toro Blanco was to be Mr. McDonald's first foray out of the confines of SoHo. Perhaps with that new-found sense of unfamiliarity, the cuisine would be innovative and thought provoking. In late November, I acquiesced to Lori's desire to see if El Toro Blanco could fill the perceived dearth of upscale Mexican. The decor didn't really rub me as upscale. It also didn't strike me as a cantina. It was a bit too dark and loud for the former, and a bit too insecure for the latter. The only generalization I have for it is a kitschy diner. That said, at first glance of the menu, things looked promising. A drink named for LEON TROTSKY? Be still my beating heart! Unfortunately, in a grave disservice to both the man and my masculine sensibilities, it was unforgivingly pink. Equally unfortunately, it tasted nearly exclusively of grapefruit. The guava, lime, and cava had taken the night off. As it was later in the evening, I chalked it up to the bartender being a bit rushed, and moved on. I can abide a lackluster drink and head scratching decor in the name of satisfying food.Our guacamole came shortly after my drink, and it was a surefooted step in the right direction. Made fresh to order was for once no exaggeration, the avocado possessing the sheen of having been freshly beaten, the tomatoes just starting to meld into the dish. The chips were a bit thicker than the average Tostito, and the selection of salsas, while lacking in heat, were bright and fresh. All of this was also $12, which felt a bit steep. However, had I known what to expect for the tacos, I'd have gladly ordered several servings of guacamole and called it a night. To be fair, the Sonoran Cheese Crisp, also $12, was reasonably enjoyable. The sweet smokiness of the roasted tomato and the savory, fennel like nature of epazote brought nuance to what was essentially a large cheese quesadilla. It's hard to dislike something so unabashedly cheese-centric, especially when the cheese is good and the tortilla is crispy. Sadly, that was to be the last net positive of the evening. Lori and I decided to sample several varieties of tacos, ostensibly in the name of science(!) but realistically because I was hungry. The first to arrive were the Baja Fish, which we chose to fill with Ahi. The Ahi looked appetizing, with a light sear, supple, rare flesh, and after the lime was squeezed over the rest, it tasted...bland. The roasted jalapeno aioli didn't assert itself, and radish with citrus slaw was equally mild. Letting the fish be the star requires fish of knockout quality. This simply wasn't it. The tacos Al Pastor, those which Lori was most excited for and I least excited for (pineapple) were next. They were an improvement, if only for the reason that the pasilla negro were present in the taste. But still, I found nothing overly impressive. The final to arrive became my  favorite set of tacos, the Escuela Vieja, precisely because they had no extraneous elements that you'd wonder why or how they were included in the first place, since you couldn't actually taste them. But were they, or were any of the tacos for that matter, worth an average of $15? Not even close.Service was a bit spacey. Our waitress gave me a drink menu, but also gave me twenty minutes to talk myself out of getting one when she didn't come back. When it came time to pay our bill, splitting the check had to be attempted three times. And on the third time, it was still done wrong, leaving us to settle things amongst ourselves, exasperated.Exasperation is likely the most pervasive feeling you'll experience at El Toro Blanco.

3.0,12/22/2012,"Had a great evening last night at El Toro Blanco.We've been wanting to go since they opened - we're a fan of Lure.  Have had difficulty getting a reservation in the past.  A couple of weeks ago I decided that I would call to see when the next weekend night reservation was available for a legitimate hour (i.e. not 6pm or 10pm).  So luckily we were able to get one for last night.  They were even accommodating when we tried to move our reservation and add a person to our party last minute.When we arrived, they honored our reservation and had plenty of tables available.Onto the food and drink....Since they have been written up over and over for the past several weeks, I HAD  to try a margarita and tacos.   DRINKS: I ordered a Jicama Fig margarita. super delicious but went down way too easy.  I then also had a decent glass of malbec with our main course.FOOD: we started with the Green Chile Queso Fundido.  We are a fan of Queso Fundido.  We definitely enjoyed the addition of green chilis to the queso, but the queso was a little rich for us.  We are used to a more solid version of queso fundido rather than a creamy version, which reminds me of the queso we used to eat in college in texas made from Velveeta (yes, ok, i admitted it, but it is VERY popular in mexican restaurants in texas).for our main courses, my husband order the Carne Tampiqueña, which he orders at most mexican restaurants.  he enjoyed the tomatillo sauce on the enchilada and the meat was cooked to perfection (which is always nice) and tender.  i ordered the seared tuna tacos and the charred octopus tacos since they each come in an order of 2 tacos.  while i expected to enjoy the tuna tacos the most, i thought the octopus tacos were phenomenal. the tuna tacos were fine.  neither entree came with sides (maduros, beans nor rice) so my husband left a little less full than usual.while we were deciding on dessert, chef capon came over to see how we were doing.  a nice touch!  for dessert, i decided i could not leave without a little dulce de leche.  the chef recommended a few things.  there was way too much to pick from on that front, so i just ordered 1 scoop of homemade dulce de leche ice cream. it was a nice sweet way to end the evening.we enjoyed the atmosphere - felt like we were a little out of nyc (a positive).  tegan was a nice waitress.  as we were leaving around 940pm on a fri, the scene was beginning to pick up and the bar was a hoppin'.",0,0,0,Nicole R.,"New York, NY",18,131,2

3.0,12/13/2012,"Being from California, I am pretty darn picky with my Mexican food.  El Toro Blanco comes as close to the real deal that I've experienced in NYC (with the exception of Red Hook).I started off the the chile rubbed mango cocktail.  OMG!  This drink is H-O-T!  It literally tasted exactly like its description: like an extremely spicy chili rub mixed with some alcohol.  Beware! I had to wait until the ice cubes melted to actually start enjoying it.On to the food....we got the tuna ceviche which was good, but it's on par with most ceviches out there.  I wish it had more chips to go along with it though.  The two of us also split the camarones en barbacoa (barbequed shrimp) and al pastor tacos.  My favorite of the two were the al pastor.  The pork was juicy and flavorful and the pineapple was the perfect citrus complement.The churros for dessert were also good and came with two different dipping sauces: dulce de leche and chocolate.  Yum!The portions were tiny and they come with a hefty price tag.  Two tiny tacos for $15?  That's a 300% mark up compared to tacos in Red Hook.  Ouch.  Ok ok, so obviously you're paying a premium for the location, ambiance and service, but still. Service was decent.  Reservations are a must.  Although there were many open tables around us at prime time, they claimed they didn't have any openings between 6-10pm.  Hmmmm.",1,1,1,Sandee L.,"Discovery Bay, CA",235,494,105

Guacamole was fresh, the drinks were strong and tasty. Our favorite taco was the shrimp, I can't quite remember the name. My boyfriend loved the octopus, however, I would pass on it the next time. The only complaint we had was the wait time. We had reservations but we weren't shown to the table for another 30-45 minutes. Also, be prepared for some obnoxious early 20-somethings trying too hard.

3.0,12/10/2012,"I had high hopes for El Toro Blanco since I like Lure Fishbar and I love Tex-Mex, but unfortunately it was pretty disappointing. I went for brunch this past Saturday around 1pm, and the restaurant was not too busy. When we left around 2:30pm, it was much busier. Either way, it's always good to have a rez! My friend and I started with some guacamole, which came out with 3 salsas (red, green, brown-spicy) and tortilla chips. I had heard that the chips were going to be served warm, so I was really pumped for that, but our chips were room temperature. The guacamole was completely average. The brown-spicy salsa was flavorless. The red salsa was watery. But the green salsa was delicious.. very garlicky and flavorful. Overall, Empellon blows them out of the water though when it comes to salsa. We started with some empanadas as well; we are empanada fiends! They were delicious but came out PIPING hot, so I burned my tongue. I ordered the Sonora cheese crisp for my main course, and it was not hot enough. Overall, there was a food temperature problem happening. The crisp, while pretty, was underwhelming. The green peppers brought nothing to the table, the cheese wasn't oozing, and none of the flavors popped, with the exception of the delicious tomatoes. I've had better Tex Mex at the Woodbridge Chili's. The service was the most regrettable part of the meal though. It took 20+ minutes for the waiter to come over to the table. In the meantime, our waters were being refilled constantly, lots of staff were buzzing around, but we were invisible. When our waiter finally came over, he forgot one of the Diet Coke's so we had to ask again. A busboy preemptively took our plates away. The Sonora cheese crisp came out on a raised tray (like a pizza), and I had to ask for a separate plate (I am not going to eat off the raised tray duh!). They asked if we wanted more chips, we said no, but they brought them out anyway. Just a lot of sloppy. So I would skip this one and head over to Empellon instead; they have much better Mexican food in the West Village.",2,0,0,Meghan A.,"New York, NY",235,593,533

1.0,12/8/2012,"I ate at El Toro Blanco for the first time on 12/7/12.  I called on Monday morning for a reservation, but I was told that they were completely booked for Friday evening, so I grabbed a 5:45 reservation on OpenTable.   It was aggressively early, but figured it was happy hour, so no big deal, I had been looking forward to trying this place.  When I arrived at the restaurant, I was told that I did not have a reservation.  The hostess looked up my phone number and saw that my table had been booked for the same time two weeks later.  I apologized for my mistake and felt like an idiot, but they sat my party at a table with no issues.  I looked for my confirmation email the next morning, and found that I had in fact booked the table for the correct date.  Not only did the restaurant completely mess up my reservation (from an electronic system, no less) but the restaurant was barely half full when we finished eating 2 hours later.  This seems incredibly sketchy to me.  Our server was awkward and unfriendly, and kept trying to rush us to order and move our meal along, despite the restaurant being half empty!  Halfway through our meal, the restaurant turned on its air conditioner right above our table, which felt like someone had left a door open to let the 40 degree outdoor air rush in.  The waitress was uninterested in doing anything about it, despite our polite reqest.  The food was alright but nothing special (would recommend the octopus tacos) and the cocktails were creative and strong. The ""Jicama Fig"" is worth an extra star.El Toro Blanco has potential but they have some issues to work out before I'd be willing to give more stars.  They seem quite impressed with themselves and they don't have any basis for their attitude.**UPDATE: After filing a complaint with OpenTable, today I received the following response to my claim:  ""Your reservation was originally made for 12/7/12, and the restaurant changed it to 12/21/12.""  Shady and inexcusable.  They're losing the extra star, can get good cocktails elsewhere.",3,0,0,Laura F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,0
1.0,12/7/2012,"I have never felt the need to write a review on Yelp, but after this experience I had to let my opinion known.My girlfriends and I do a monthly dinner.  We really wanted Mexican this month and had heard good things about El Toro Blanco, so decided to give it a try.  They could only give us a 5p reservation, which would have been fine, except for the fact that there were then 2 tables near us of the same size that sat empty until 7p.  We then ordered food and drinks.  Appetizers were great and the guac was spot on.  But midway through the appetizers, the waitress comes over and tells us that our entrees are on the way and starts removing the unfinished guac and taking the plates away.  One of my friends literally still had food in their hands when the plate in front of them was whisked away.  I made a comment to the waitress that I felt like we were being rushed and she assured me that was not the case.  Although, I am still not sure...Entrees arrived and the food was fine.  My enchiladas were fine, nothing spectacular, but edible.  The rest of the dinners at the table felt that their meals were under-seasoned and lacked salt.  But then once again, before we were done with the meal, the busboys started clearing away our food.  I believe that no plate should be removed before everyone is finished with their meal, clearly that is not the agenda at El Toro Blanco.  Plates were being whisked away without us being asked if we were done, glasses disappeared when we still had several sips left.  I am a slow eater and hate it when I am the last person at the table with a plate still in front of me, as I feel like I need to eat faster.Now we probably should have called it a day after the entrees, but we wanted dessert.  We ordered another round of drinks and several desserts to share.  The tres leches cake tasted good, but was crazy mushy.  The rest of the desserts were fine but nothing special.  But then once again, here come the busboys to take the plates away - all of the dessert plates still had food on them (half of the cake, 1 churros, 1 mexican donut) and we had not yet finished our drinks.  This time we were prepared and had to firmly tell the non-English speaking busboy to STOP taking our food!  But right behind him came another busboy and another.  At one point a busboy stood next to our table and just watched us, not really knowing what to do.  We finally had to call the waitress over and tell her that they needed to stop trying to take our food away.  Eventually that seemed to work, although not immediately.  In the midst of the attack on the desserts, one of my friends who happens to be pregnant, repeatedly had her foot/ankle stepped on by the busboys as they hurried by.  Given the look on her face, it seems that it was quite painful.  Now once could be understandable, but by the second time it was becoming a trend much like the over-attentive service and we needed to go.  To the busboys credit, as we were leaving he did come over and profusely apologize to my friend for stepping on her and it was quite sweet. The bill comes and while it was not crazy expensive, given the quality of the food and entire experience, I was not pleased to spend $75/person.  We all walked out of the restaurant saying never again.  It is strange to say, but sometimes overly attentive service, can be worse than slow service.  I wish I could say that this is where the story ends, alas at least 3 of the 4 of us ended up having extreme stomach issues later that night.  Not quite to the level of food poisoning, but something clearly didn't agree with us.  Needless to say, none of us will be returning!",0,0,0,Clarissa S.,"New York, NY",0,1,0
3.0,11/25/2012,"Ate brunch here. It was decent - and since this place is new, I'm leaving room for improvement but they don't yet deserve 4 or 5 stars...First, the good. The guacamole, it's a 9/10 with fresh out of the oven corn tortilla chips. The only way it's better is if it's homemade by a guac expert, otherwise, they make better guac than I've had around NYC. Good job. And they give you a decent amount, 3 of us shared the small for $12, which seems par for the course (actually I've definitely paid significantly more for less...). The burro burrito, delicious. The churros with hot chocolate for dessert, daaayyyeeem yummy. The brunch enchiladas were reasonably good too. Ambiance was also a nice feature of this place. Granted, we were here around noon, but the decor is both spritely and rustic. Lot's of sienna colors, and weathered wood ceilings give it an up vibe that is relaxing. I bet it's even prettier at night. The not so good. Their brunch cocktail menu, specifically the 3 Bloody Mary/Maria varieties, are bizarre, as each one features either agave or pineapple, effectively lending a sweetness to these drinks. Either they don't understand a bloody is supposed to be salty/savory OR they are trying to re-imagine this drink and let's just say the result is not good. Not good at all. Bleh, I wanted to vomit up the sip I had from my companion. Just put a standard (maybe vamped up?) Bloody on the menu - but save the sugar part of the palate for a different cocktail, it has no business in a Bloody. The in between. The service was good, but physically interrupted an ongoing conversation unnecessarily twice. This could be young, overly enthusiastic wait staff, but don't be overattentive to the point of interrupting conversations.  I was also a bit iffy on the prices for food (prices for cocktails were reasonable and standard $10-$14). $16 for 2 small brunch enchiladas with eggs and a wee bit of ham (with no potatoes or anything on the side), seems about 10-15% too pricey for the place that this is right now...I think once they get their cocktails in order and their wait staff squared away, this place will be a 5, but it's not there yet. I may return in a couple months to see if they've worked out their kinks, but otherwise I'm going to hunt down better, cheaper Mexican elsewhere.",1,0,0,Jessica S.,"Manhattan, NY",60,43,0
5.0,11/24/2012,"You don't quite expect a Mexican place on this stretch of Sixth Avenue, but then again, this is not your typical Mexican restaurant. I usually don't go for what looks to be trendy twists on street food I could easily get back in the Mission in San Francisco for far less pesos, but the execution is key here as chef Josh Capon replaces home-style authenticity with full-blown flavors that really impressed my jaded California-honed palate. I was there with colleagues, one of whom knows Capon well, so we were treated very well as we swam upstream among the hipsters in the congested bar area.What struck me first was the retro-swank decor - the gigantic swordfish mounted on the wood-panel wall, the matador paintings, the rust-colored naugahyde booths, the drop pendant lamps, the wood-framed smoked glass dividers. It was enough for me to think I landed on the set of a Dean Martin comedy circa 1965 but not enough for me to think it was an out-and-out kitsch-fest. The place emanates way too cool a vibe for that kind of feeling to ferment. The menu is robust with obviously high-end ingredients applied to familiar Latin dishes making the slightly higher price tags more understandable. We started with a couple of their fresh ceviches both bursting with an array of flavors.The $14 Tuna Ceviche was clean and fresh as the chunks were mixed with Soy, Lime, Seared Serrano, Cucumber, slices of Avocado, and Cilantro. However, the standout is the $16 Lobster Ceviche with a nice dose of Coconut, Citrus, Mango, Jicama, Habanero and Mint (see photo). Combined with paper-thin fried plantains sliced lengthwise (versus the standard chips), both were sensational. The perfect chaser was the flotilla of tacos which came in convenient quartets. First up were the $16 Cabrito Tacos stuffed with Slow-Roasted Goat, Frijoles Borrachos (drunken beans cooked in beer), Queso Chihuahua (soft cow's-milk cheese), Pasilla Oaxaca (smoked chiles) and Queso Cotija (hard cow's-milk cheese).Encased in a silky-soft flour tortilla, the variety of textures and layers of flavors really worked with the tender shreds of goat meat. Next were the $14 Escuela Vieja Tacos, a more standard creation marked by the freshness of the ingredients - Seasoned Ground Beef, Shredded Lettuce, Cheddar Cheese and Pico de Gallo - all encased in a crispy corn taco shell (see photo). The heartiest of the trio were the $15 Al Pastor Tacos which featured Spit-Roasted Berkshire Pork, Pasilla Negro (darkened chiles from Oaxaca), Roasted Pineapple & Onion, Avocado Slices and Queso Cotija (see photo). Given my proclivity for the pig, these were my favorite of the selections.Clearly all this great food could not be digested without the appropriate libation, and I had at least a couple of the $12 El Toro Margaritas, a tangy, salty combination of El Jimador Blanco, Lime, Agave and Fresh Orange Slices that went down my gullet quite smoothly. By the time we finished, the place was really hopping with all the tables occupied and the bar as crowded as the 6-line at rush hour only with prettier people. Capon and co-owner John McDonald have really nailed their concept of an upbeat and slightly upscale cantina with plenty of panache in the food and the atmosphere, a feat all the more impressive given it's only been open for a month or so. Definitely worthy of a return visit.FOOD - 5 stars...creative takes on familiar dishes with a heavy emphasis on fresh ingredientsAMBIANCE - 4 stars...retro-cool vibe but not kitschySERVICE - 4.5 stars...pretty attentiveTOTAL - 5 stars...worth swimming through the crowded bar scene for the superb food",13,6,9,Ed U.,"San Francisco, CA",4521,4629,37977

During high tides dinner time, the bar gets extremely packed but other than that, theres always a little room to snuggle in with your cocktail. Waiting on my late as usual dining partner, I was able to chug my botanica cocktail. Something about this cocktail just isnt right. I cant out my finger on it, maybe the lack of acidity balance or something but it just didnt have that proper kick. My second cocktail right after, the Leon Trotsky, served in a slim flute was so much better. It had texture, flavor, and just an overall nice blend. (I dont do tequila so I probably missed out on 90% of the cocktail menu)As we sat down to dine, our server came around very quickly asking about waters & suggesting guacamole for the table. Of course we went with the guac (medium - just enough spice) and three varying salsas. I thought the guacamole was fabulous, simple and flavorful. The chips, crisp not too greasy but definitely enough fried goodness. I just hate over done guacamole, example: the empellon guac with the ridiculous bird seeds everywhere providing no help to flavor. For tacos, we decided on the cabrito (goat) and the baja (crispy cod). I was pleased with both, especially with the crispy cod. Fried just enough for the soft taco with a perfect addition of citrus and radish slaw. I really was tempted to order more. Who doesn't love a crispy fish taco?As for the entree, my dining partner went with the Carnitas Michoacan (Pork) and I with the Carne Tampiqueña (skirt steak). I'd definitely agree that my dish was a lot better than his. The skirt steak was cooked perfectly, served with a divine mexican cheese enchilada. The flavor combination of the cheese, chimichurri sauce and the juice from the medium rare steak made it hard to want to share this dish. I definitely suggest ordering a side of the elote de calle (corn). Service here is absolutely wonderful, very caring and patient. This was a lovely dinner, one I would definitely do again. Definitely make a reservation unless you sadistically enjoy waiting hours and hours as a walk in or even worse, plan on gambling for a bar seat.

Further disclaimer that this place is clearly still finding its footing and, if it heads in the right direction, IMHO, it will be a 5 star place.The immediate downside of this restaurant is its location at what I consider kind of a 'poser douche bag' intersection of the world - people who like to go to Da Silvano, 10 Downing, etc. - places where the food is mediocre but they want to be seen, preferably sitting next to a and b list celebs vs. finding a good menu.That said, our driver was a friend who saw their menu and for that, she was spot on. We waited a 1/2 hour in a semi-crowded rather hot front area of the restaurant and I was starting to get more and more annoyed because I thought we'd never sit and that they were bs-ing us on our table's availability but they:a) brought us a round of cava on the houseb) were really polite and gracious about the situation (people who had paid their bill but hadn't budged) and that there was nothing else they could do.In fairness, I can't blame places like that - they were trying and it showed. The food was fairly awesome. The 'spicy' guac is not even noticeably spicy but the flavor is exceptional and you can always dump some more hot sauce on it. The short rib empanadas were exceptional.I had the goat (cabrito) tacos - also exceptional. Our waiter was a bit focused on up-selling but it wasn't too bad and we didn't feel like we were mistreated because we didn't bite.

Came here on a Monday night and the place was packed out and  with a great looking crowd ( no doubt about that since we all know Da Silvano and Bar Pitti has a killer crowd) . We were seated in a nice booth and were greeted by a very very friendly waiter. Our waiter was there to please and he loves his job so it made our dining experience so pleasant. Now we all know the reason I gave this place a five star rating is based on the food so lets get down to business. We started our meal off with the guacamole which was very good especially if you have it with the spicy yellow salsa ( diablo).  The queso fundido with chorizo and potatoes was also delicious. The corn tamales were oh so good, I didn't want it to end to be honest. The cheese crisp was good but it didn't blow me away, with all the other great choices there I'd skip the crisp. Now I am a huge huge huge fan of a good salad and their tostada salad is soooooo good, I love ... beans, cheese, corn, avocado, tortilla strips all in one plate c'mon you can;t go wrong! The seasoned ground beef tacos were amazing in their hard shells! The grilled octopus tacos with the jalapeno mayo were great!
