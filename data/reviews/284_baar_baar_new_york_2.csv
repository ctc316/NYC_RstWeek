2.0,4/29/2019,"Was very surprised with average food, terrible service after seeing rave reviews of this place. We there for brunch on Sunday. I really had high hopes from this place.1. They were out of tea (for brunch!). Black Coffee is coffee flavored water.2. Vegetable Kheema Pav(barely warm)was nothing but extremely spicy Pav Bhaji (instead of 'Pav', you would a thick slice of barely toasted bread) felt very cheated with the misleading name!3. Lamb Kheema came topped with a white liquid sauce instead of 'potato mousse'. Garlic Naan was very good. 4. Waitress seemed disinterested and lost. Got only half our order and the remaining half after being reminded half way through eating.5. They have a live band on weekends, it was too loud to have any conversation even though we were seated far away from them.",0,0,0,Neha A.,"Manhattan, NY",4,13,0
5.0,4/29/2019,"Awesome modern Indian gastro pub. Went in for Brunch,  made reservations online and got seated right away. Once my party was complete our server came and food just kept coming as we ordered. Everything was fantastic but I'll say that my favorite was the cauliflower 65, the paneer with ricotta and the tomato chutney! If they sold that chutney I would buy a whole jar! Soo good and a well balance of sweet n spice.The mimosas were great and if you check in you get a free one! Definitely a great Brunch even if its a little pricey",1,0,1,Edelmys S.,"Bronx, NY",44,7,13

In drinks we ordered the somras ( my new favorite!!!) and the calcutta cup, both excellent!I was pleasantly surprised eating the jackfruit cutlet which our server recommended, it was spicy and not sweet and a must try dish! I would also recommend the cauliflower appetizer which is a like a twist on the gobi manchurian.  For main course, we just ordered the mushroom dish which was okay. I do wish they had more items on the main course section for vegetarians..

The food was exquisite and the drinks were even better. Definitely recommend coming here for brunch for anyone that's looking for a fun dining experience.

3.0,4/21/2019,"Average food- looks like a better restaurant than it is. poor service for the price. Wait staff didn't know much about the food or take any effort in explaining it, water wasn't refilled and took a while to get anyone's attention in terms of service. Food is okay- enjoyed it but definitely not good enough to justify the price and level of service. Better Indian places in NYC to spend your money",0,1,0,Susan L.,"Manhattan, NY",269,16,0

1.0,4/20/2019,"Extremely disappointed with the management staff, and quality of food has deteriorated.  Had a reservation for 6 people plus a child at 11:30 on a Saturday morning (when the restaurant opened). When we arrived on time, the hostess rudely ignored us while on the phone and then pointed to a booth table and said ""they are setting it up"".  A few minutes later, the manager came out and told us that the only table available for us was actually in the bar area in what looked like lawn chairs. This was despite the entire (very large) main dining area being empty other than 1 other party, as the restaurant had just opened.  The manager rudely said ""she doesn't know what she is talking about"" when referring to his hostess.  When we highlighted that the restaurant was almost completely empty and that we had arrived on time for our reservation, he insisted that all the other tables were booked, that he had ""300 reservations"" that day, and that people would be pouring in soon.  We were obviously very upset and felt clearly unwelcome in the restaurant.  Did we not match the restaurants preferred aesthetic? Was it because of our two year old daughter? Or because my wife is 8 months pregnant? We told the manager that if we were not welcome, we would leave and find another place to eat.  At that moment, the manager suddenly said that he could seat us in a booth in the main dining room.  He took my wife aside to explain that the real reason he could not seat us before is because there were already two parties seated in the restaurant,  and the server could not handle serving more than two tables at once.  We understood this to be nonsense, as what restaurant this large cannot serve more than two tables at once?  Especially one expecting ""300 reservations"" that day?  An hour into our meal, the servers seemed fully able to handle several parties at once (though the restaurant was not nearly ""fully booked"" as the manager had insisted before - two booths next to us and many other tables still open).  We were quite shocked by how rude and discriminating the manager was with us.  Have not encountered something like this in any other place in the city.  As far as the food goes, that has also gone down hill - the tuna papri chaat tasted like bad poke (low quality tuna); they have cut down on the potato mousse in the keema; and the Dahi puri now has too much rose water. Clearly will not be going back to Baar Baar, despite the name meaning again and again.One bright note:  our waiter was great - very attentive and brought the food out promptly. The other food was great.",3,0,0,Yusuf I.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,0
2.0,4/19/2019,"Came for both brunch and dinner recently. Our brunch was at 12 noon. It a limited menu and even though we were practically the first ones there, they had already run out of the fish and prawn dishes  Also, many of us wanted the rum punch cocktail that was listed on the menu - we were told it isn't served anymore because it's too strong and people were getting drunk?!? THEN TAKE IT OFF THE MENU!! The food was very average - my old delhi fried chicken in particular was dry and tasteless. Decided to give it another try for dinner. This time at least everything was available. About ten mins into our meal we noticed water flooding around our feet. We asked the server to check and she literally brought a mop and swabbed in the middle of our meal. There were several empty tables but we were not offered to change tables and neither did anyone apologize to us. Of the food we tasted, the mustard cream fish was really great - everything else was average. At the end we ordered a pot of masala tea - and it came in a ridiculously mismatched cup and saucer (see pic). This is really not the type of service and quality you expect from a restaurant that charges these prices. Very disappointing.",1,0,0,Charis B.,"New York, NY",43,90,112
1.0,4/18/2019,"Service: Very cold and dry.  Except 1 server who was smiling and presentable, all others were super rude. They cleared the table before you even stop eating as there is a hurry to kick you out. The server who took the initial order never ever returned back to even ask how things are. They missed 25% of our order. Which is 3 dishes and no one explained what the food was when served. They just left it on the table. One server poured the water so full that it spilled and he never even bothered. Very loud music like you are in a Club.  The food was mostly on a sweeter side and definitely not typical Indian taste for Indians.

5.0,4/10/2019,"We went to baar baar on a Saturday morning and were seated right away once all parties arrived. I ordered the chai and can say it was probably the best chai I have ever had... so good that I am contemplating emailing the restaurant and ask how I can recreate it in Florida... lolThe food was amazing, and very flavorful, and the ambience was very trendy, yet traditional. We had the chicken tikka with garlic naan, omelette, chicken tikka macaroni, lamb keema, and the Delhi fried chicken. I have no complaints on any of the food, my only suggestion to the restaurant would be the recreate the Delhi fried chicken into a chicken and waffle dish with maybe a chutney sauce. The fries, though good, we're a tad underwhelming when paired with the tasty chicken.

The color scheme of red and gold really made the restaurant pop.The menu had so many good options, it was hard for me to choose. Finally settled on ordering the mushroom tandoori with a side of rice. Mushroom tandoori was OK I felt the mushrooms could've been cooked a little bit more, however I really like the sauce that the mushroom came in. The rice dish was delicious.

I think the atmosphere exceeds the food. For dinner, we had tried the red pepper Makhani which just didn't do it for me. I think if you're expecting authentic Indian, it won't fulfill your cravings.

4.0,4/4/2019,"Food: 4/5Service: 4/5Ambiance: 5/5Value: 4/5In a last min-date Friday night decision, I came to Baar Baar at 6pm. No tables available for walk-in (this place is definitely a hot spot) so we sat at the gorgeous and pretty spacious bar. A nice bartender made some delicious classic cocktails each with a spiced twist. I never really know what I'm getting with a modernized version of classic dishes, so here's to hoping this helps out anyone as indecisive as I am:Cauliflower 65 (5/5): fried cauliflower bites, nicely spiced and crisp, paired with a slightly tangy and creamy yogurt-like mousse. Lots of flavor and texture. One of my favorites!Lamb Keema Hyderabadi (4.5/5): like a ""shepherds pie"" but with way more spice. The lamb is just barely gamey, layered with familiar mashed potatoes and green peas. It's dense and hefty, and really tasty. Spread on the toasted pao bread that's as soft as lobster roll bread. Duck and Foie Gras Haleem (3.5/5): I knew it was going to be rich but the fact that it's a pureed texture makes it seem even more dense. It's kind of like the lamb, so go for the lamb instead.Traditional Butter Chicken (5/5): I feel like it's basic, but it's so good! Could anyone not love this dish? The chicken is really tender and juicy, and there is plenty of sauce to sop up with a side of garlic naan.  Service was great considering the bartender was also our waiter. The only hiccup was when they brought 3 dishes (with their bread) at once. We were able to send part of it back so the meal was better coursed out. This is a really fun spot for Indian food with a few interesting twists. The menu was overwhelming to me, so the bartender's recs and translations were extremely helpful. I'd love to come back with a larger group.",5,3,3,Lillian Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",461,285,1300

4.0,4/2/2019,"What a great concept! Came in for a saturday afternoon brunch. The entire party does need to be there to be seated but that was not a problem because the bar had plenty of seats. From the minute i walked in i loved the decor and ambiance. At first glance at the menu, everything looked great and I had no idea what to start with. Their drinks are a very interesting fusion. We went with the rum punch which was not the best thing, would definitely NOT recommend, i think the coconut component didn't pair well at all. We barely made a dent in the drink because it was so nasty, ultimately being a waste (therefore removing one star). Thankfully Yelp did offer a check in option which allowed us each to get one free drink so we opted for safer options like the bellini and mimosa. As far as food goes, if you do not like anything under their brunch favorites, the waiter did offer to upgrade any of the sharing plate options for us. I really liked the concept of the malai chicken tikka macaroni and the chicken tikka and jack cheese kulcha, although i wish the kulcha was a little bit thicker and packed with more chicken. It is a bit on the steeper side as far as pricing goes especially since their portions were tiny. We were all left with space to eat afterwards. Their music choices were phenomenal from classics to  some of the more recent songs which really made the experience so much more enjoyable.",3,0,0,Harv P.,"Franklin Square, NY",159,76,62

5.0,3/31/2019,"I was a bit skeptical of Indo-Western food bc it can be tasteless or too minimal/ist, and some of the trendy New York restaurants can be overrated. But we had a great birthday dinner here for a family group of 5 adults. The dishes tend to be spicy. We had the Veg Apps Platter, Lamb Shank (very spicy, less meat than one would get in a traditional curry), Whole Fish, chili Prawns, Tandoori Mushroom with squash upma (least spicy), and Potato Dahi tikki w/ crispy kale. (Good textures) Plus cocktails. Sunday night wasn't too crowded. & chocolate something for dessert. Everything was delicious and tasted totally different.",3,0,0,Shilpa M.,"New York, NY",23,82,111
3.0,3/31/2019,"Man, I really wanted to love this place! I heard amazing things from my brother and his girlfriend and I don't know if we didn't order the right things, or what, but I just didn't enjoy it that much. It started off badly, and I think that's always the hardest to regain footing in a restaurant experience. My cocktail-the rum punch-was downright nasty. It maybe should have been a red flag when the server asked us if anyone had a dairy allergy, but I just thought it was in relation to our food order, especially since my friend hadn't ordered a drink and filed it away as good service to check. I am not sure what it was in the drink that was so off-putting but it actually tasted so bad to me that I didn't finish it, which never happens. I couldn't taste the coconut or pineapple flavors that should've been present in the drink and got just the faintest taste of citrus. On to the food! We tried the lamb keema and jackfruit tacos to start. The keema was really good, with a thin layer of milky something that was called potato mousse on the menu but in no way tasted like potato or was the consistency of mousse. The jackfruit tacos were fine-interesting flavors, but definer could have had a chutney or something to bring out the Indian flavors. Next up, the paneer pasinda and the butter chicken, one with saffron rice, the other with naan. The paneer dish consisted of three little triangles of thin sliced paneer, stacked and deep fried. It's hard to explain, but paneer dishes aren't typically battered and fried so I think it should include that info on the menu. It was actually pretty good, and was served in the same makhni sauce as the butter chicken which we didn't realize until after getting the food, but it does say that on the menu. The sauce for the butter chicken was quite thin-a little difficult to eat with naan and would have been much better had it been a bit thicker. That dish is supposed to be traditional, so I'm not sure if it's intentionally thinner, which isn't typical. Butter chicken is something I order at every Indian restaurant and this version was nothing to get excited about.The service was excellent, the decor and environment lovely and the food came out promptly. We had another appointment, but I understand they have live music for brunch a little later, which I bet is really neat.I'll try again for dinner next time I'm in the city.",2,0,0,Naseem T.,"Baltimore, MD",40,109,66

4.0,3/31/2019,"Decided to visit Baar Baar based on a friend's recommendation. This trendy, contemporary Indian restaurant located in the East village is located in a surprisingly big space colorfully decorated with plush blue seats, a beautiful wall painting, and ornate lighting. There was a mix of families and people on dates - everyone seemed to be enjoying their meals. We made a reservation which was a good move since this place got quite busy on a Saturday.The menu has two options; either a la carte or a pre fixe for $52. We opted for a la carte because we wanted to try many of the dishes on the extensive menu. Our waiter who was attentive and helpful throughout the meal assisted us with recommendations and descriptions. A few highlights included the masala jackfruit patties, traditional butter chicken, and beef short rib. They have a pretty modern take on Indian food which I found interesting and innovative. There's also a great selection of cocktails and wines available to accompany the meal. I enjoyed the Kairi Mule which had an interesting combination of spiced green mango marmalade, citrus, green ginger wine, and baar baar ginger beer. Overall, I really liked the modern twist on Indian food and thought the space was very chic and trendy.

5.0,3/15/2019,"One of my favorite restaurants in the city, hands down. Baar Baar is part of a trend of modern Indian fusion cuisine that has become quite popular in New York, including others like Rahi. However this is easily my favorite. We'd heard quite a bit about the place and made a reservation with great anticipation. After arriving, we realized there was far too much on the menu that we wanted to try. Fearing missing out on all the delights, we inquired about a chef's tasting menu. Despite not being listed on the menu itself, they were open to accommodating for $75/person. They subsequently offered wine pairings, which we gluttonously accepted, which was another $30 each. A manager named Jordan came by to explain the process and what he'd be offering. He basically then became our waiter. With each course, he would come by and explain nearly every ingredient within and how they complemented each other, in addition to what made it unique. He also was clearly well versed in wine, as he would give an in depth explanation about each wine he poured as well. His hand was heavy, his humor was entertaining, and his charm was effective. By the end of the meal, I was stuffed to the brim, beyond tipsy, and laughed out. What an experience.I have since returned and requested the same chefs tasting menu with guidance from Jordan, which lived up to my own internal hype I'd built up from the first visit.Highly recommend.",3,0,0,Emile G.,"New York, NY",355,114,193

Inside, the modern decor makes the place feel upscale, but without the pressure of needing to dress up.Menu consists of an extensive wine/spirit list to go along with a specialized food selection. Opted for a Gin and Tonic ($19), the Lamb Shank ($28), and Garlic Naan ($6). Was debating an appetizer, but since none of the entrees come with bread or rice, saved the money for that instead. First off, the food is great - the meat on the shank easily cuts off and the naan was a solid compliment. Drink is expensive (+$3 for a decent mixer), but had the hard to find Sipsmith Gin I liked. To end off the night, had some Chai Ice Cream ($5) which had an intense, satisfying flavor after a spicy meal. Server was friendly, though messed up the drink order a couple times.

1.0,3/10/2019,"Promising Indian spot with decent food but an experience that was absolutely destroyed by the awful service (by the servers and the manager).The dahi puri was an ok take on the Indian street food, but missed a little something. The green pea Kulcha was good and the only standout dish. The rest of the dishes are where this experience went downhill. To start, we were brought the veg burger which we didn't order. When we asked for the correct dish (chicken 65 and fries), we had to wait 20-30 mins after finishing our other dishes. At this point, we were given the Chicken 65 but they forgot the fries. This was after we spoke to two different servers and the manager.  When we asked about the fries, we were given a cold serving of fries that had clearly been sitting out for a while (maybe the side from the burger we were incorrectly given?). When we asked for the check, we were quick to pay so we could get out, but then realized they charged us for the burger we never ordered and a chutney we were never given (yet another mess up...) and had to get that reversed. Th drinks were hit and miss too - the mule was excellent but the Bellini was one of the worst takes on the classic. We were also seated towards the back of the restaurant but the music was still way too loud (with a broken/scratchy speaker right above us to boot). The only reason this place might get another try is because of the potential but the service/the way this place is managed means that will take some serious convincing.",1,1,0,Emily V.,"Manhattan, NY",49,37,103
3.0,3/8/2019,"I've been a bit torn about how to rate this place. I'd give it 4 - 5 stars for food but 2 stars for drinks and inconsistency. First of all, the restaurant is beautiful. The decor is sexy and detailed- from lively paintings, plush turquoise booths, down to the wallpaper in the bathroom. The space is set up in a way where it can cater to large groups as well as intimate dates. I've been here a few times now for brunch. The first couple times the food was great. I brought a few friends here last time as a treat but the  macaroni and paneer I spoke so highly of were disappointing. The kitchen must have had an off day but consistency is key. However, the jackfruit tacos and naans (especially the apricot duck) have been consistently delicious on every visit. You MUST get dessert no matter how full you are. I dislike Indian desserts because they're too sweet but they've taken the concept of a traditional indian dessert and reinvented it to a PERFECTLY balanced modern dish. I seriously cannot explain how delicious they are. My favorites have been the carrot halwa cake and a chocolate mousse with chai ice cream. The chai service is super cute too.Unfortunately the drinks don't match the food. I've tried every single brunch drink with the exception of the sangria  and am not a fan at all. The badam lassi and bellini both have an unpleasant bitter aftertaste. Both my friend and I thought the rum punch was disgusting and couldn't take more than a sip. The hyderabad collins was fine but not memorable enough to order again. I heard good things about their drinks but after trying at least six of them, I disagree. Unless their dinner drinks are completely different.The vibe is really fun and both the live music and the dj are excellent. The first time I came here, the service was terrible. We came in with a reservation around 2pm and the place was packed. We were told the table wasn't ready yet so we ordered a couple drinks at the bar. We checked in with the host after a while and it became clear that she forgot about us and ended up seating us an hour after our reservation. We were seated at a small table for two in the back in a small curtain enclosed area with two tables. I was a bit disappointed that after such a long wait with a reservation, we didn't have a view of the band playing or really anything at all other than the service area. Instead of excellent service, we were basically ignored after placing our order. We had to stop someone and ask for water 45 min after being seated. On another occasion, I asked for a booth on a reservation but that was ignored. I wouldn't mind if they had other parties to seat but the place was empty on this particular day. There were only 2 other tables with the same amount of people, both seated at booths and by the time we left, it was still empty.",1,0,0,Monica C.,"New York, NY",27,76,45

While our table was being set up she offered us complimentary drinks at the bar. Within minutes we were then offered a table.

She truly made us feel special and had some great recommendations for food.We ended up having Kashmiri Duck and ApricotLamb Keema HyderabadiDuck and Foie Gras HaleemSwordfishThe food was superb; I can't stress that enough. The ambiance was pleasant: it's loud enough where you don't overhear others conversations but quiet enough to have your own conversation with your partner.

Unfortunately, it really didn't meet them at all.  First of all, I wasn't a huge fan of the ambiance, but that's a personal taste in that I prefer more intimate places. The service was really good, after the beginning when she realized we were ones who wanted to take our time and not be rushed. We did get a personal consultation from the sommelier on what wine to choose, and his choice was def. the highlight of the night.As for the food, we ordered 3 appetizers(Chicken 65, Prawns, and the Cauliflower) and 1 entree(lamb shank). The Chicken 65 was very disappointing and really was lacking in flavour. The prawns were really good, and you could tell they were of good quality, and the sauce with it was tasty as well. The cauliflower was nothing special and actually didn't like the fried aspect of it. There really was no taste to it, and it wasn't worth the price. The lamb shank was very good, and the best food item we had. It was juicy, flavourful, and a good portion size.

5.0,2/21/2019,"Going to majorly caveat this review with the fact that I don't love Indian food (I KNOW. Don't worry, my friends already regularly shame me for it). As a result, I'm not well versed with Indian food and don't much. However, I loved my experience at Baar Baar!We came on a Friday night with a reservation for 4. They only seat complete parties, so we got drinks at the bar while waiting for our last Friday. The staff was so nice that they poured me and 2 other friends a complimentary glass of champagne while we were waiting with our last friend. I don't know if they were just being really nice, if the table wasn't ready, or if they thought we were waiting for a table because of the staff even though we were just waiting on our last friend, but regardless, it was a super nice gesture. They also gave us a free chutney with bread when we got seated. Again, I'm super confused as to what happened, but very grateful nonetheless.I honestly couldn't tell you what we ended up ordering because of my lack of knowledge about Indian food and the fact that we took all of our waiter's (great) recommendations, but I loved absolutely everything! The suggestions the waiter gave were all incredible and he suggested the perfect amount of food for 4 people. The ambience and décor of the restaurant is gorgeous, and the music was at a good volume. The cocktails were incredible. There were a few that were spicy, which I loved. The sommelier present also had good wine recommendations. The server was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The whole staff was just amazing. They were really accommodating of us sitting there and catching up with friends after finishing our meal. 10/10 would recommend to a friend. The waiter told us that Baar Baar means ""again and again"", so yeah... my friends and I will likely be coming baar baar lol.

I think it started to die down around 11:30.The service was great, & we had met the owner (Rajiv) who was super nice and accommodating and welcoming! The food was also amazing! I was shocked.

5.0,2/13/2019,"I came here for a supper party, so sadly I cannot review individual items on the menu as some of them are not on the traditional menu, but I can safely say I was very impressed with everything about this place from the ambiance, to the service, to the food. First off, this restaurant does not look like the traditional lower east side establishment. I don't know about you, but when I think of LES, I think of small, usually hipster bars, often grungy or divey, (except for Beauty and Essex). Anyway, this place is rather large for this area and is pretty sexy and upscale and has a bit of a 1960s feel to it. The ceilings are high, (15+ feet high), and tables are setup surrounding sexy teal couches, and gorgeous, ornate paintings. I also love the marble bar that's front and center of the restaurant. Overall, the layout is perfect...it's setup like a lounge meets contemporary dining, but there's little separation between dining area and bar area. They had an excellent cocktail menu to offer and I was told the cocktails were amazing (I had wine which was also excellent...light white wine is the perfect pairing to spicy 'ethnic food'). The food was exceptional in my opinion. Everything tasted fresh and full of flavor, and we got a ton of food overall, I was really full when we left here. The traditional butter chicken was hands down one of the best things I have ever eaten. The sauce was incredible! If we had more Indian sourdough bread, I would have licked up all of the sauce that came with this chicken, OMG. We also had the market fish with bengal mustard cream, which in our case was striped bass along with saffron rice. I loved the flavor profile, the mustard sauce had a nice flavor, not too heavy, with a slight mustard taste, and paired nicely with the flaky white fish. While I don't eat lamb, we were offered two lamb dishes which looked excellent. The one dish came with the largest drumstick of meat I have ever seen and it was just flowing with slightly spicy sauce. Each dish came with so much sauce, I needed ten trays of Kulchas (bread). I just Googled the menu and didn't see the dessert we had on the menu. Bummer! I had a chocolate rum ball with chocolate causing, chocolate mouse center and chocolate cake on the bottom paired with with milk ice cream and bits of orange like candy.

Now I could be here to bitch and moan about how it took so long to sit down but allow me to explain why it ended up being amazing. Regardless of how busy they were, the owner came up to us and offered us 4 glasses of bubbles as we waited. Not even a few minutes later we were offered a delicious small appetizer which was bursting with flavor. As we sat on the bar and were waiting for our seats the bartender took our order (cocktails are delicious!) one of my friends was pregnant but did not mention to the bartender when he took our order she asked just for water. He must have over heard our conversation talking about babies because when he came back with our cocktails he had a 4th cocktail (virgin) made for my friend. He told her this one is for you non alcoholic. This was such an amazing gesture from him because it made her feel less left out that we were all holding pretty exotic looking drinks and she was drinking water. Plus the juice cocktail was delicious!When we finally sat down we ordered a bit of everything and we were not disappointed. Each bite was better than the one before, every thing we tried had flavor like you cant imagine.

1.0,2/9/2019,"Had a horrible experience here. The attitude is beyond atrocious. We made a reservation for 9pm (not even prime time) and showed up willing to try a new restaurant. First they couldn't find our reservation and then tried to escort us to the bar room. Given we reserved a dining table and intended to have a full and proper dinner, we asked to be seated in the dining room instead. The woman seating us rudely suggested here wasn't any capacity for this. We pointed out to her that there is an empty 2 person table within eye sight. She then went to the host and told him loudly and in front of us that we were arguing with her. He decided that we were not deserving of this empty table and said we would have to wait a while if we should want a table in the dining room (which is what we reserved). I expressed that we are disappointed to be treated so disrespectfully to which he rolled his eyes at us.  I am astonished that a relatively new restaurant would be so brazenly rude, crude, and spiteful. I am further disappointed to see a supposed, but ill mannered, steward of modern Indian cuisine, be so horribly crass.

1.0,2/5/2019,"*EDITING MY REVIEW IN RESPONSE TO THE COMMENT BELOW*Hi Payal,If you can't take criticism then I highly suggest you get out of the hospitality industry because judging by your responses to other negative reviews you are really lacking in customer service skills. Not everybody is going to have a positive experience at your restaurant so you should really figure out how to use those moments as learning opportunities rather than bashing on your customers over Yelp.Anyway, thank you so much for your sincere and thoughtful response to my review. It is nice to know where the waiters learn to tell stories from since you just insinuated that a woman walked in totally unconscious. Either way I do apologize for my insensitivity and you should too since you yourself just publicized what happened instead of protecting her privacy. I hope she is doing better and getting the proper care that she needs. Regardless of all of this I didn't appreciate being told fabricated stories by my waiter. Thank you for reiterating that you discounted my bill but your attitude is uncalled for. You should really treat your manager well because he's the only good thing you got going for you from a customer service aspect. Good luck for the future.Best,JessicaHorrible service. Let me start by saying we were seated at 7:30 and dinner didn't arrive to the table until 9:20 and we didn't get the check until 10pm. The excuse the waiter gave was the chef wasn't satisfied with our plates so he took them back. However it was restaurant week and the whole place was eating the same thing so I highly doubt my butter chicken wasn't up to par but everyone else's was. Next, dessert took forever allegedly because the pastry chef was tied up with the ambulance that had arrived to the restaurant due to a customer being black out drunk at the bar. The whole experience was really disappointing and I have to say that none of the entrees were really much of a wow. We appreciated the manager discounting the bill for the inconvenience and the ambiance was nice but that's about it.",2,1,1,Jessica K.,"New York, NY",266,10,0

4.0,2/2/2019,"Had heard so much about this place, that I had to visit it on my visit to NYC. We made reservations, was easy to get one on a monday evening. We arrived on time and were promptly seated. The happy hour was still on, so we decided to sit on the bar for sometime and then move to table. We ordered spicy margarita and it was delicious. The place is really well decorated with lots of photo ops. Great for a girls night! We ordered the assorted papad with the hummus- avocado dip. We also ordered their really spicy sauce with it which was really good!Once seated on the table, we ordered chicken 65 and butter chicken. Both these dishes were average. I think its more to cater to the American crowd, the butter chicken was almost little sweet. I would highly recommend this place for great drinks and starters.

My main course was a beef short rib dish which I thought was unique because I never ate short ribs at an Indian restaurant, but it didn't disappoint at all.

4.0,1/27/2019,I have been to baar baar a few times now and each time its been really great. There are some favorites that I discover each time and in particular its the innovative dishes one ends up loving.... the duck haleem was quite great the first time and yesterday the avocado-edamame chaat was brilliant (and fresh)... I sometimes feel its the traditional dishes that one is not sure about just because one knows those tastes a bit more and expects more- so we were a bit disappointed by the prawn appetizer- it just didnt have the distinct taste one hoped and poi was a bit dry...(and the butter chicken just wasnt as good as the delhi ones :) I remember on a previous visit). But then the mustard fish was just amazing... Love the mix of regional dishes alongside some experimenting with some new concoctions. The carrot cake was a perfect finish.

I had the chai drink and it was absolutely amazing! We tried a few others including the lassi (all alcoholic) and they were too strong and harsh for our liking.For appetizers we had the lamb keema, and chicken 65. Both were amazing! The keema came with some bread that was the perfect accompaniment! Delicious! For entree we had the onion and cheese naan and the butter chicken with a side of rice. Nothing special here, I've had better butter chicken before but definitely enjoyable. I liked the naan but my bf didn't. I guess it's a matter of choice. The service was exceptional!

Their dinner is also excellent, I had the paneer pinwheel which was both aesthetically pleasing and delicious.

3.0,1/8/2019,"Three of us had dinner on Dec 26 and had mixed feelings about our experience. On the positive side, the decor and ambiance were nice and the food was very good: tasty, interesting dishes, reasonably-sized portions for the small plates (we did not order the full-sized dinners). Except for the ""Chicken 65"" dish being a bit overcooked, resulting in dry chicken, the food itself merits 4-5 stars.On the negative side, the printed menus did not mention peanuts as an ingredient in two of the dishes that we ordered (Chicken 65 and Cauliflower Koliwada), so we did not think to ask our server whether those dishes had nuts until after they were served to us. Our server failed to mention when we ordered that those dishes contained peanuts. We had to further poll her about every dish on our table to inquire which ones also had nuts, since she failed to volunteer that information once she realized we were concerned about eating nuts. Confusingly, the online menu *does* mention peanuts as an ingredient in those two dishes, in stark contrast to the printed menu which does *not*.Neither the menu nor the server mentioned that two of the dishes we ordered were also fried. We would have expected that a better server would have brought this to our attention, and would have asked us if we really wanted to order two fried (i.e. heavy) dishes. We also think the menu should have noted that these dishes were fried.When it came time to pay, it took quite a while for the server to return with our check. We could see that she was busy taking care of a large party in a nearby room. At a restaurant of this calibre, another server should have stepped in and taken care of that for her, without us having to hunt them down. The restaurant was not particularly busy at this time, so there is no reason why this should have happened.",0,1,0,Kino L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,0

Once we were seated, we were given only one menu (there were 11 of us) until we asked for more. The order was taken horribly late (again, only after we called the server ourselves). Food wasn't all that great, specially for the price. The only thing I absolutely loved (which is what the 2 stars are for) was the Potato and Bone Marrow Kulcha - I'd only go back for that.

The restaurant week menu started off with a single pani puri, which was simply a burst of flavor in your mouth and left us wanting more. The chicken appetizer and paneer pinwheel main course did not disappoint! Did not at all feel the heaviness you usually feel from the usual greasy Indian food.

2.0,1/3/2019,"Im not sure how this place gets 4 stars. Has to be people who know the owners or their friends or friends of friends who are gassing this place up. There are dozens of other modern Indian fusion restaurants that give Baar Baar a run for its money.  I would compare this to a renovated/ modern version of Park about 10 yrs ago( who knows how its now but back when you would party the night away with your clicks but never really dine there)The ambiance is great.  Can definitely see they put some thought and $ to set them up and apart from your traditional restaurants but honestly, that's the only nice thing I can say.  Our hostess sat us at our table but the waiter never showed up until about 20 minutes had passed.  Never offered a drink menu.   When finally he decided to come by, we had to ask for the drink menu.  So again we waited for him to come back to take our order.  Never provided specials so who knows if there were any. Never wrote down anything we ordered so of course being this was ""Baar Baar"" and the price point on all the dishes, we figured this waiter has to be ""THAT"" good and he would remember EVERYTHING we ordered.  I can tell you after he took our order, we saw him only twice- when he messed up the food/drink order and when he gave us the bill. By the time some of the apps came, my husbands drink still had not arrived (we had been there for over 35-40 mins now).  Then the server brings a chaat type dish so we inform him that we didn't order this dish.  Server talks to the waiter, waiter comes and asks if we ordered it (um maybe if you our order down instead of paying attention to everything other what we were ordering you might know), we tell him no so then right in front of us he asks the couple sitting not even a foot away next to us on the same bench if they ordered it, they say no so he goes ""ok its yours now"".  Um hello, what type of service is that.  Not that we wanted the dish but how can give away a dish that first came to us.  The couple asked if we wanted it back but of course we said no, we all just shook our heads and agreed the service was awful.  Oh this was also when we had to remind the waiter that my husband still hadn't received his drink and since the bar was right behind us, we saw him ask the bar tender to make it.  We never saw our waiter again until we were ready for the check. Not once did he come back to ask if everything was ok or if we ended up getting the right dishes.  A well seasoned/trained employee would have either apologized for the dish error and taken it away or given it on the house to us, esp after forgetting my husbands drink.When we finally got the check, guess what, there were dishes on there we never ordered!  That samosa dish wasn't even there!!! Like are you  kidding me, I really thought we were getting punked but sadly no Ashton Kutcher in sight!  Food was nothing to write home about.  Yes, there's paneer rolled in sauce or rolled into a big sev ball and presentation is nice but is it worth the price, 100% NO.  I was so shocked at the service/food that I began reviewing what others had written about them from its grand opening and was amazed that this wasn't the first time the service was this awful.  I cant believe they haven't done anything to change this.  I guess you have your typical desi crowds and maybe some not desi who see some sparkling new restaurant trending and want to come here and perhaps haven't been to other places and give it the rating is has; although hard to believe if you live in the tri- state area, theres' no way Baar Baar holds a candle to a majority of them and I honestly can't comprehend anyone giving them anything close to a 4 star review.  If anything maybe come for a drink during the summer time when you can hang outside but sadly I will never dine here again.",0,0,0,Dina R.,"Clifton, NJ",12,13,2

4.0,1/2/2019,"(3.5 stars - but rounding off to 4 as it doesn't merit a 3 and is closer to a 4 star rating)**Choosing a restaurant for your 10th wedding anniversary is a tough call and since Baar Baar symbolizes everything we love - Indian food with a flair, the New York spin on an eclectic menu, a symbolic meeting of the East meets West...  we decided to give it a go for our celebration! First off we got a chance to try a fair bit of the menu among the four of us (see pic). While it comes across as a lot of food, the small plates are really bite sized except the paneer chilly. Small plates:DAHI PURI - 6 pieces of rose water infused greek yogurt/creamy dahi with pomegranate seeds. High on taste... melts in the mouth... bite sized puris leave you wanting for more. GREEN PEA AND GOAT CHEESE with Fresh Truffle and Goat Butter: I loved this one - our other trio not so much and felt it could use more truffle to bring out the flavors. PIQUILLO PEPPER AND ONION with Jamón Serrano and Manchego: A clear winner with everyone - spicy and tangy - not for the faint hearted.  LAMB KHEEMA: A-okay. Good portion size and while it didn't blow us away, it was good as a sharing piece for the table. RED MULLET FRY: Brilliant. The fish coated with Indian spices and deep fried had an intense taste and was an instant hit. CHICKEN CHILLI - meh. Chewy pieces of chicken - the dish is supposed to originally be a fiery bomb of Indo -Chinese flavors. When you take away that element, all your left is some pale looking chicken in soy sauce. This version. PANEER CHILLI:  More like Paneer vermicelli spring rolls - deep fried beyond recognition. I'm all for a new spin on a classic dish but when the taste is deconstructed to a degree that you can't taste the paneer (key ingredient) or any of the other ingredients, it doesn't work for me. Large plates: While everyone loves the tapas style sharing plates at Baar Baar - we couldn't resist trying some of their larger plates and loved everything we tried. All the dishes were on point with generous quantities. PRAWN ASHGOURD  ALLEPPEY: OMG - if you love prawns, you have to get this if it's still on the menu. Spicy, sweet and tangy ...bursting with flavors and some of the mushy gourd this is a well layered dish that we couln't get enough of. Black dairy daal - the classic black daal, not tampered with and served  as it should  be with dashes of butter and cream. Don't count those calories. Saffron rice - great accompaniment with both the prawns and the daal. Cashew cake - Okay we just got this as it was our anniversary and even though we were stuffed to the gills had to get something sweet to mark the occasion! Didn't register the taste as we were too stuffed. (yeah did I already say that?!) Our friends also loved the innovative cocktails especially the kairi mule and the almond badam cocktail were sheer winners.  Service was fantastic and our waitress was patient and made good suggestions and didn't try to rush us even though it was a busy Saturday night for her. Over all, this is a great restaurant to take colleagues to introduce them to Indian food, for a special date night or when you want to go out with family but not eat the regular chicken tikka masala. I would love for them to keep innovating but keep the soul of Indian food intact and not Americanize it to the degree that it loses its charm (as in the case of chicken and paneer chili). ** The menu on their website is not updated so expect some surprises.",20,8,15,Arshi K.,"Hoboken, NJ",741,350,704

After inquiring, we were told that the waiters are pressured by management to always be doing something - which ultimately resulted in a sub-par experience for us.

We were a group of 6 people (partly vegetarian, partly non vegetarian) and ordered quiet a variety.Standouts: Lamb keema, tandoori yams, piquillo pepper kulcha, tandoor mushrooms and kairi mule.My cousins went gaga over the keema and called it the best in NyC. The yams were perfect too, very savory and perfectly spicy. The piquillo pepper kulcha was well cooked and very well flavored. Tandoori mushrooms were very well spiced, paired well with the polenta.Out of all the drinks, only worth mentioning was the kairi mule. Perfect amount of flavoring, alcohol and very yum.Underwhelming: paneer chilly (looked good, but little too sweet and was served cold), papad thali (papads were good but chutneys were nothing special), tandoori octopus (according to us the khichdi and octopus dont go well together), lentil cake (very underwhelming, curry was good but lentil cake was below average), saffron rice (flavorful but dry), sattu cocktail (sweet and spicy and probably the only other drinkable cocktail), calcutta something cocktail (not good)Bad: potato tikki (potatoes had gone bad, and trust me I know it), prawn alleppey curry (the curry had raw turmeric taste), pea goat cheese kulcha (no pea flavor what so ever), hyderabad something cocktail (no flavor, no alcohol, not worth it)The service overall was good, fast and friendly.

The restaurant has a vibrant decor with music that enhances the dining experience without taking away from your ability to converse with others. The large mural by the bar is so enchanting!  I've dined in the main room and enjoyed plenty of causal meals at the bar - the experience is always consistent and fun.  The owners Payal and Rajiv have done such a great job at capturing the vibe of downtown NYC matched with cosmopolitan Indian decor.

2.0,11/30/2018,"We've been coming to Baar Baar since they opened, back in the days when the owner was on the sidewalk with menus on her hand asking people to come in and try it.We live around the corner so it was very convenient. We kept coming back for the food, service was hit or miss. Tonight it was a disaster. We had a reservation at 8 pm. When we arrived the hostess told us our table was almost ready.  At 8:30 we went back to ask her how much longer it would take, she said any minute. I absolutely hate it when restaurants give this BS. Why not just say ""we apologize but it will take a bit longer than usual tonight""? After a couple of minutes a gentleman, who seemed to be the manager came to apologize for the wait and when we asked how much longer for our table, to our surprise he said another 20 minutes. He offered drinks but ended up bringing some we didn't ask for (he did make up for it later). The waiting area was full of other people waiting a long time for their table as well.After we were finally seated, almost an hour later, it took another 10-15 to order and then half hour for the first round of appetizers to arrive, and another 20 minutes or so for the main dishes to come after we finished with the appetizers. Everything felt disorganized and out of control. We were 3 people, they brought 2 small pieces of bread for us 3 to share with the lamb keema. When we asked for a 3rd piece of bread the waiter said it would take too long for them to bring it, and when we complained to the manager and he told the owner about it, she replied ""that's they way it is"".I understand a restaurant can have a bad night, but they didn't handle it well at all, especially the owner who was walking around hugging different people in the room but never came to apologize for the wait or the bad service. Now that her restaurant is full she seems not to care at all.After tonight we will probably go to Tamarind for good Indian food instead, and we'll make sure our friends know about our experience.",3,0,0,veronica b.,"New York, NY",34,18,4
4.0,11/30/2018,"Three of us came here together after it was highly recommended by many of my friends for a while. I was surprised by the size of the place, humongous! The bar area is especially stunning. It was a little surprising that our reservation wasn't ready yet because the restaurant was not completely full, but they were very accommodating when we asked to be moved from a table that was directly behind the register. Drinks: We ordered the Calcutta Cup, Sattu Sharbat, and the New Delhi (their take on a whiskey sour). I love whiskey sours and was excited to try their version which was presented beautifully but I was pretty disappointed with my drink, in fact I couldn't stand the taste. The other two drinks at the table, especially the SS was great and after some contemplation (I hate being that person but these are expensive cocktails at $15 a pop!) I asked if could get my friends drink instead. Again, they were very accommodating. Food: We decided to try three chutneys ($5) tomatillo & green mango, yogurt and avocado and cilantro mint. Especially loved the green mango, avocado didn't have much avocado. We then ordered the duck apricot kulcha and the bone marrow kulcha (my friend had ordered the bone marrow one before and raved about it). Loved the duck apricot... but the bone marrow kulcha had absolutely no bone marrow. Decided not to say anything but that was also surprising. We also had the tandoori octopus that was on top of a type of daal, pork belly, lamb ribs and fried chicken. All of these dishes were excellent. Fried chicken was cooked perfectly and not too oily and came with a delicious chicken tikka type sauce (Spicy for sure). Lamb ribs also can't be missed, fell off the bone easily. Didn't feel like the octopus tasted ""indian"" but still loved it. Don't come here expecting traditional Indian dishes, you might not get the type of spicing you're hoping for... but the Indian fusion is very unique! They take ingredients not typically used in Indian cooking and put their own spin to it. Overall I really liked the place minus my drink and the one kulcha missing its key ingredient. It is on the more expensive side but a worthwhile splurge to try at least once. Curious about the rest of the menu!",3,0,0,Deb D.,"Bridgewater, NJ",49,80,68

It's a great way to try some creative ""New Indian"" fare without breaking the bank (see: Indian Accent). We tried a few dishes from the small and large plates, and all were excellent! We had the spicy crunchy cauliflower 65 and the buttery rich Keema Pao, the decadent, fall-off-the-bone lamb shank nihari and the imaginative paneer pinwheel, the perfectly balanced, not too-sweet carrot halwa and the decently good tutti frutti cassata.

Innovative kulchas seem to be the new hot thing at every innovative Indian restaurant around the city, but these were not the tastiest I've had - that prize goes to Indian Accent in Midtown. My friend and I proceeded to share three small plates - the paneer chili, the cauliflower pakore, and aloo tikki with kale, interestingly enough. Of the three, the aloo tikki was definitely the favorite, and I will say the tikki itself was delicious, while the combination with kale was dissonant. The paneer chili - nothing like chili paneer, to be clear - was something of a paneer spring roll served with a tomato chutney, and I found it rather unmemorable. It's hard to screw up fried cauliflower, and these pakore were pretty good, but I thought serving it with upma was a strange combo, and I didn't love it.Overall, the food was definitely not bad, but it wasn't amazing, and the price point seemed too high for the quality.",0,0,1,Alan S.,"Cambridge, MA",248,159,115

Drinks are good. For more than two it can be a bit hard to order the correct amount.Drinks are unique but can be a hit or miss.Comparing our experience to the reviews we are shocked!Heard of this place, walked by it, and read about it and finally got to visit with a group of 5.Walked in and the ambiance is amazing. We had a reservation and were seated at a nice round table. To start out we had the kulchas. Which had some good options but we ordered the peas and the goat one and they were lacking flavor and dry. Surprisingly the bread did not come with any sauce. Would not suggest.We also had the chaat, which was good but the portions were very small. The ribs were really good.Moving on to the main portion. We had the panner roll up, butter chicken, garlic naan, butter naan and the mushroom dish.The mushroom dish was the best out of all of them, a bit salty but very unique and tasty. Paneer roll up was very odd I personally found the paneer it self to be hard. The butter chicken was good and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The naan bread was presented in a great way but the bread was cold, very disappointed. After the experience overall we did not want to stay for dessert. As goes the drinks we ordered 5 drinks and asked two without alcohol and they mixed the drinks up and only got one without alcohol and we weren't offered another one. Some were strong some weren't.We paid a hefty bill for a decent experience with not to much food. We were personally disappointed after all the hype.

Cauliflower 65 and the chaat are also have a great take on traditional dishes. Their presentation is what makes this food even more deliciousHad the tandoori mushroom and the lotus dumplings.

3.0,11/4/2018,"Brunch! My friend and I came here with a Gilt deal ($65 for a appetizer to share, 2 brunch drinks each, and an entree each).Drinks: The brunch drinks that they serve with the Gilt deal aren't what is advertised on the menu. We both ordered bellinis, which are described on the menu as ""Blood Orange & Cardamom, Prosecco"" but what we got was something made of coconut sorbet and sparkling wine. I don't recommend this combination---the acidity of the wine does not go with coconut. For our second drink, we both got mimosas, which was your standard mimosa.Food: We shared the potato tikki. I loved this. Aloo tikki are basically potato cutlets. The Baar Baar take was topped with kale and spinach chips that were coated in chickpea flour and fried. They were SO good! As I was eating this, I was thinking about how people say they like kale chips, but how hard it is to imagine people actually enjoying them. But these were delicious. It's served with a ""yogurt mousse,"" which was so rich I thought it was sour cream. I had the paneer and ricotta bhurji for my main entree. This was good, but after the flavor variety of the potato tikki, I was less wow-ed by this. A good dish to share, I wouldn't order this to eat by yourself. My friend got the lamb keema hydrabadi, which I think I preferred---it was very flavorful and rich. Overall, I'd like to return to try more of their small plates.Ambience: Huge space, the decor is great, and there is a bar area that my friend tells me gets packed during the week with the after-work crowd. For brunch, there was a dj playing and mixing music very loudly. It felt like they were trying to cultivate a party vibe, and it felt forced.

Secondly, we were a party of 5 and turned dinner into an Indian Tapas affair because we were so curious about everything on the small plates menu!Here is a list of everything we ordered, in order of MY preference (seriously, I thought everything was absolutely delicious, except for #16 and #17):1. Potato and Bone Marrow Kulcha2. Lamb Keema Hyderabadi3. Garlic Naan4. Pulled Beef Madras Croquettes5. Ginger Alam Chutney6. Chicken 657. Asparagus Pepper Fry8. Cilantro and Mint Chutney9.

4.0,10/23/2018,"Food and service - 5 starsDrinks- 3 starsSo definitely visit this place. Lovely decor, service and food. We ordered too much food but thankfully they were all fantastic. Their stuffed kulchas are cleverly made. My favorite was the duck one. It's a decent sized starter for sharing. Perfect for 3-4 people.Aloo tiki was good. But nothing you won't get anywhere else. I think there was crispy kale or something as garnish that added to the texture. Beautiful touch. Lamb keema hyderabadi was excellent. This is like a non veg version of pav bhaji. The pav was buttered and crunchy and soft all at the same time. Brilliant! The cauliflower is highly recommended. Nicely battered and fried. The accompanying chutney tastes like kadhi and I did not care for it too much. Speaking of chutneys, if you are as brave and have it in you like I do please go for the House fermented chilli one. You won't regret it. Really hot and has a huge kick to it. Not for the faint hearted.Ginger chutney was great and so was the mango one (sweet). They gave us too extra on the house. But the ones I mentioned were different And my favorites.The non veg thali is a bunch of kebabs and sausage to share. No carb sides. The duck patties were great, the kebab was excellent, and the rest of the stuff too. Goes well with all the above mentioned chutneys.Paneer pinball- the gravy is just like a well made butter masala so highly recommended for vegetarians. Saving my best for one but last. Keep some room for dessert cos this is where they nail it. The coconut double thing was just too much yumminess for one dish. Exciting flavors all complimenting each other. The tutti frutti cassata is also a brilliant remake of an Indian favorite. They went to town with the desserts.Drinks- highly disappointed. My ginger lime mocktail did not give me the kick I want from ginger not the freshness and tang from lime.My New Delhi sour could have been 10x stronger. They charge $15 for the cocktails so I guess it's not the usual NY price but still.. a nice stiff cocktail would make the already great evening just perfect.

It's been hard to find good Indian-Chinese food in New York and this was probably the best I've had here. 10/10.Main course, we ordered the Paneer Pinwheel between the two of us. The taste was perfect, 10/10 again on taste. I was only slightly disappointed that they had the same kind of paneer ""rolls"" in both the Paneer Chilly and the Pinwheel. Just cubes of paneer would have sufficed. The rolls again felt monotonous.Compared to the amazing food, the cocktails were definitely disappointing.

The service was INCREDIBLY slow on a Sunday night.  The restaurant was probably 50% occupied if not less, so I couldn't understand why the wait for our food was so long.  Our server barely checked in on us so we were left waiting and wondering how long it would take As for the food, this is what we ordered: - Green pea and truffle kulcha - meh.  ""Truffle"" had no flavor and neither did the green pea.  The combination just fell flat and left much to be desired - Lamb Keema Hyerbadi - the only thing we actually enjoyed and the only thing I would probably recommend here- Butter chicken and daal -  the amount of heavy cream that was used in this dish was just flat embarrassing.  All I could think about was how fake these dishes were and sad that non-Indians will think that this is what Indian food is. - Spicy chutney - tasted like carribean hot sauce.  Also this was my first time actually paying for chutney (usually its comp) so that was a little strangeFood was also overpriced for what it was, especially the ""classics"" (butter chicken and daal) - not worth the price Overall, would not recommend.  Far better Indian restaurants to try in the city at a much more affordable price point.",1,3,1,Anu K.,"Manhattan, NY",341,227,407

2.0,9/27/2018,"I am bummed to report that I was really disappointed by my experience at Baar Baar. To start, the service was incredibly slow. When you order chutneys and naan, you expect that to come out within at most 15 minutes of ordering. However, we waited nearly an hour to receive these, and other appetizers. The asparagus stir fry appetizer we ordered was bland, truly lacking in any flavor whatsoever. Fortunately, the server noticed we barely touched it, asked us if we liked it, and when we admitted we didn't he took the dish away and took it off our bill. The other dishes (a vegan curry, a mushroom/polenta dish, a vegetarian sampler platter) all lacked the punch and excitement one typically expects from Indian - or really any good fusion - food. The one dish that we really enjoyed was the chickpea stew side dish. That was flavorful, hearty and enjoyable. All in all, between the slow (slow!) service, and the less-than-flavorful food, I will sadly not be visiting Baar Baar again.

4.0,9/9/2018,"Most of the food here was really good, but our main entree was a bit of a disappointment. I still think this place is worth a visit, at least once, as the ambiance is great and the restaurant is pretty trendy.  First, for drinks, my friend ordered the Hyderabad Collins cocktail and I had the Badam Lassi. I recommend the Hyderabad Collins. Here's what we had for food:- Duck and Apricot Kulcha (5 stars): Really good!  Several Yelp reviews had good things to say about the Green Pea and Goat Cheese Kulcha, but I'm so glad we tried the duck one instead. Goat cheese and truffle can be found everywhere these days. - Asparagus pepper fry (4.5 stars): This was also pretty good. We wanted a vegetable in our meal and this deliciously delivered. - Lamb Keema (5 stars): I grew up eating keema so I had to try this, especially since most of the reviews were positive. We enjoyed every bite.  - Lamb Shank Nihari (3 stars): As mentioned above, the biggest disappointment was this main entree. It came out cold. We sent it back and a few minutes later the manager brought it back to our table, stating that it had been steaming hot inside when the chef cut into the lamb shank in the kitchen. We didn't really believe him but what can you do at that point? It did seem like they had warmed it up a little bit, but the lamb was still not piping hot (and the sauce that was in the dish was room temperature). Thankfully, the naan was hot so that helped, but this did put a damper on what had been a great meal so far. - Carrot Halwa Cake (5 stars): Even though we were stuffed beyond belief at this point, we decided to try dessert in an attempt to end the meal on a high note. This dessert was amazingly good! I'm glad we tried it, but was sad that we couldn't finish something so good.

4.0,8/30/2018,"So pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. I went in for a (very early) dinner at 5.30pm. They were still fixing the place and tuning the music but it was calm and bright. We ordered the Pepper and cheese kulcha. It was light, airy, and generously stuffed. For my main course, I tried their Vegetarian Thali - it is a collection of four unusual (ingredients included jackfruit, beets, squash blossom, and corn in a husk) appetizer-portioned samplers. I enjoyed it and perhaps tricked my mind into believing that I was eating healthy. My partner ordered the Chicken 65 and Paneer Pinwheel. He claims they were both outstanding. I tried the Paneer - it was a touch too spicy for me. For dessert, we shared a flavorful rendition of steamed and baked mango yogurt (mishti doi). The tartness of the berries cut down the sweetness of the yogurt, which I was grateful for. All in all, it was a lovely experience. I'm going back next week with a larger crew and I hope the place wins on consistency. Will find out.",0,0,0,Jinal S.,"Manhattan, NY",253,62,0
5.0,8/30/2018,"Caveat: Review is for dinner only. I have tried several other NYC Indian fusion spots for dinner (Aroqa, Bombay Bread Bar, Drunken Munkey), and I am sure I will try more, but this was easily the best of the bunch so far.This place was fab and the dishes had more hits than misses from everything we ordered.  It was also very beautiful (great for date nights, group dinners), and the service was top-notch (food came out timely, no significant wait to eat).  They had a happy hour and I ended up ordering a spicy marg which was on it - very clean flavor. What we ordered:Dahi Puri - I had low expectations but this was actually delicious! Comes in a serving of six and has a very creamy textureKashmiri Lamb Ribs - Definitely order these if you like Lamb - these were amazing and so tender with a lot of dimension in flavorBeef Croquettes - My least favorite, I just felt they were dry and the sauce they came with was so underwhelmingButter Chicken - Definitely great flavor, was delicious - caveat by saying this was not the best butter chicken I have had, but hey I have very high expectations with butter chicken since I eat it so frequently.  It was very good though and worth trying! Seafood curry - Wow this was great! I was expecting this to not be good, but I loved it.  If you get this dish please be sure to order rice as a side.We also ordered 2 kulchas (green pea and goat cheese, pepper and onion) both were very yum and complimented the main dishes really well.  I loved their garlic avocado raita.  It's a vast menu and I wish we had the appetite to order more food but we were full.  Everything ended nicely with the carrot halwa cake and tutti frutti ice-cream dish (loved both desserts).Yes this is pricey if you include the small plates, food, and drinks - but you are coming here for a fusion tapas experience.  If you really wanted Indian food without the price tag, then curry hill should be your choice.  For what it is, I had a great time here and definitely felt it was a valuable experience.Also, the owner is very kind.  He wanted us to take a picture in front of the Baar Baar lady and asked us how we were enjoying our experience.  I know he's personable because this is a new venture, but kudos to him for being around!",8,0,3,Akansha B.,"Manhattan, NY",283,357,192

3.0,8/29/2018,"Baar Baar came highly-recommended by a colleague of mine and a concierge service I use happened to be hosting a happy hour event so I was quite excited by the happy coincidence and also booked a table for dinner after the event.The food is quite good but we may have just not ordered correctly since almost all the dishes we got were mostly bread-based and not very substantial in terms of protein. This was disappointing since we were completely open and specifically asked the server to recommend items and whether we should order other items, etc.Kulchas:Green pea & Goat Cheese - we got to try this as part of the passed apps during happy hour - very tasty!Duck & Apricot - we ordered this at the table - also very good - you can't really go wrong with cheesy bread with a hint of sweetness from the apricotDahi puri - we asked the server whether we should get this or the cauliflower. He recommended this. We wished we had gotten the cauliflower instead. Not particularly memorable or very good.Lamb Kheema - this was the dish to try so we ordered it (the server also highly recommended), quite tasty, really liked the spiciness!Paneer Pinwheel - we were uncertain about this and asked the server if we should order something else but he just said we could always order more, so we kept as-is. While the sauce in this is delicious, we weren't such fans of the rest of the dish. Cheese was a bit dry and grainy.Overall, the food was ok, the hits were good, the misses were pretty meh. We wish we could have been guided a bit more on the dishes so we could have a more balanced meal. We felt so full of bread and not much else at the end of dinner...Service was also all over the place! While our server was very pleasant and nice and it pains me to criticize service people, there were hiccups all throughout dinner that made it a very noticeably uneven dinner. At some point early in the meal when the first plates were brought out, someone cleared away my full drink. It was very confusing as I had taken maybe two sips out of it before I reached for it again and realized it had just vanished. I got the sense that the server maybe didn't believe me because he talked to the bus boys to ""verify"" before he had the bar make me a new one. We also had an extremely long wait between the first plates being cleared and the last one that was brought out, at least 20 minutes, and our server was nowhere in sight to flag down. We were literally just sitting there and thought maybe they had forgotten to put the order in. When they finally brought out the dish, they brought the wrong naan (we had ordered garlic, they brought out plain), and we had to wait another five minutes while the cheese got cold for them to rectify the mistake.Also on reviewing the bill, they had double-charged me for the drink they had accidentally cleared. I don't normally check my itemized receipts, so I'm really glad I made a point to read through it - the low level of service we had experienced made me doubt they would have been mindful about this and I was sad to see on the receipt that I was right.On the whole, I'm glad I got to try this place out but would probably not return due to the service - it is also very loud in there; the music is on full blast so people end up yelling at each other which makes it even more of a hectic experience.

5.0,8/21/2018,"I had a fantastic group dinner at Baar Baar with my family and friends. This is the type of place that's best enjoyed by sharing many dishes with everyone. I'm not much of the sharing food type, but I thoroughly enjoyed this.First get a bunch of small plates. I'd go with:- Dahi Puri: Ok, I'm not a fan of golgappa, which this is similar to, but I really enjoyed the freshness and contrast of texture and flavors in this appetizer. Once you pop one in your mouth you'll understand what I mean.- Lamb Keema Hyderabadi ***fav thing here***: Who knew minced meat could be so delicious? This one is topped with a creamy layer of potato mousse which provides a cool, creamy complement to the meaty, spiced lamb. Just as good as the keema is the AMAZING crisp and fluffy buttered ""pao"" bread that comes with it. I wish they gave multiple pieces of the pao. This dish checks so many boxes. I love it.- Kashmiri Lamb Ribs **second fav thing here**: These ribs fall of the bone effortlessly. The apricot and chili marmalade on them is finger-licking good.- Crispy Tandoori Cauliflower: Great for everyone, but especially a hit for the vegetarians. The curried cauliflower with the smooth curd rice mousse is a delicious pairing.- Chicken 65: A pretty standard and tasty masala chicken dish. - Pork Belly: This fatty goodness melts in your mouth.For large plates, I'd recommend:- Traditional Butter Chicken: Sounds basic, but they do it really well here. It's creamy and flavorful.- Paneer Pinwheel: This is such an interesting way to prepare paneer. It's the same makhani curry we know and love, but with rolls of paneer instead of cubes.- Lamb Shank Nihari: Such a hearty dish with tender meat. The broth is heavenly. Don't let anything of it go to waste.- Tandoori Mushroom: The polenta uqma, crispy garlic, Parmesan, and truffle on these mushrooms make a rustic and deeply flavorful combo.- Naan: Obviously. Order more than you think you need. They go quick! These are made really well, and served fresh and hot.- Saffron Rice: Obviously, again. Order a bunch of these. This aromatic rice melts in your mouth. I love when places do the simple things like rice perfectly.Besides the fantastic taste and beautiful presentation of everything, I was impressed by the textures. There's so much attention to detail with the texture of the meats, vegetables, sauces, garnishes. The usage of components like mousse, toum (garlic emulsion), gel, and pickled ingredients take dishes to the next level. The mouth-feel, along with the taste, made each dish feel like a party in my mouth. A feat like this is what distinguishes a good restaurant from an excellent one.Dishes are more on the mild side. I'm guessing that's because as a modernized Indian restaurant, they need to cater to a wide spectrum of tastes. It can't hurt to ask them to make some dishes spicier if you enjoy spice like I do.The staff is awesome; they explain the dishes so well and make great recommendations. I definitely appreciated the honesty when our waiter told us what not to get.I can't recommend Baar Baar enough for a fun and satisfying group meal.",3,0,0,Anurag P.,"New York, NY",74,249,382

I started with the cauliflower koliwada which was delicious, definitely the best of the appetizers we had. We also tried the calcutta chaat and chicken 65. The chaat was good and flavorful, but nothing to rave about. The chicken was also good and a bit spicy. For entrees we tried the paneer pinwheels which were divine and the short rib curry. The short rib was quite good but had a weird taste, the only thing I can liken it to is that of microwaved meat (which I am sure they didn't do, but that was the flavor I got). We ordered regular and garlic naan, chickpeas and dal as our sides. The chickpeas and dal were amazing, some of the best I have ever had. The chickpeas had a bit too much ginger for one person at our table, but she still loved it. My only complaint was that they don't bring rice with the entrees so we ordered it separately ($5 for rice, one is good for two people so we got two orders). It is rare to go to an Indian restaurant that doesn't bring rice with your meal, but that is my only complaint. We tried all four of the desserts (bhapa doi, cassata, halwa and filter coffee chocolate cake). The desserts were quite good but my favorite was the halwa. We also got a pot of the Indian bouquet tea which was nice, but a bit too floral for me personally.We all agreed though the food is more fusion than authentic Indian, it was incredible and felt it was better than Junoon.

Incredible. Then our waitress brought out our drinks, again incredible. Highly recommend the Kairi Mule! Our first course came (our real appetizers) and the portions were HUGE. They could have easily been entrees, and yup, they were incredible. The chicken was juicy and you can tell the lamb was good quality.The remainder of our meal was exactly the same.

The service was poor (waiters never checked in, were awkward as they took our order, and were very slow). The food was pretty lame. The curry tasted like tomato paste and their paneer pinwheel had no flavor.  Restaurant week is a sham, and Indian food shouldn't be gentrified.",2,1,0,Jake L.,"Brooklyn, NY",416,11,0
4.0,7/30/2018,"A puri, compliments of the chef, was probably the most delicious part of the meal, although everything was good in general.Cauliflower Koliwada with tomato pachadi and cur-rice mousse - better than usual cauliflower, but wanted more flavor.TRADITIONAL BUTTER CHICKEN with Red Pepper Makhani and Fenugreek - pretty good, chicken was not dry, unlike at other places.Garlic NAAN - the bread was good, not too burnt.Carrot Halwa Cake with saffron and pistachio ice cream - interesting flavor, the cake was almost like a corn cake.",0,0,0,Amy Y.,"New York, NY",46,210,189

4.0,7/29/2018,"This was the best indian-fusion I've had in NY, and in a long time. We came for restaurant week for a Sunday night dinner. The ambiance was great but nothing out of the ordinary. They do seem to have a large outdoor section which as well. The complimentary dahi puri started us off with a surprising burst of flavor, beyond the traditional chutney and pani combo. Seriously impressive! Our appetizers were fantastic, continuing to slightly nudge pass the traditional Indian palate.Our main courses, the butter chicken and the jackfruit squash, were less than ideal. The cream based curry in both dishes were sweet, too sweet. We sent the chicken back and swapped for the sea bass. The sea bass with the mustard mint chutney brought them back to a star performer! The desserts, tutti fruti ice cream and the steamed yogurt, were also flavorful and unique. I'm not the bigger fan of tutti fruti but if I had to choose one then I would choose this dish. The waitress who helped us was incredibly nice and understanding when we sent the chicken back. Check it out! It's worth a try!",3,1,1,Tulsi M.,"New York, NY",235,82,48
4.0,7/28/2018,"4 stars and that's all for the hard working kitchen staff and the genius chef behind the menu. Service was sub par. Went here for restaurant week and they had overbooked the place. Had an 8:30 reservation and only got seated at 10:30. That being said the crowded bar has some interesting sweet and spicy cocktails that made the wait a tad better. When we finally got seated the wait staff seemed quite rushed- wouldn't have expected that after making us wait for hours! The food was almost worth all the bad experiences to get to it. Definitely recommend the stuffed kulcha breads, tuna bhel and keema. The food had a Indian zing with a great modern western take. Stick to the savoury because the deserts weren't anything to write home about.

5.0,7/23/2018,"I made a reservation here on the Seated app to get a $20 amazon gift card for our dinner but honestly I've been waiting to try this place. We came here on a Friday evening after work at 6pm and it wasn't too crowded at all. The outdoor seating is so nice and it doesn't even feel like you're at an Indian restaurant downtown. When we got there, they gave us new menus that had just been printed and they had some new seasonal additions. We ordered the chicken malai, paneer chili, a pepper kulcha and chicken 65 for appetizers. We were worried this would be too much food but surprisingly it was just right! The kulcha was by far our favorite and we are so glad we ordered this. We were about to order another but decided it would've been to heavy with our dinner meal on the way. The chicken 65 was good with dallops of sour cream but my parents are Hyderabaadi and I've had some of the best chicken 65 in the world so this didn't really meet my standard. The paneer was not your average paneer at all it was in a roll with crispy frillys on the outside. Definitely very interesting. The chicken malai was amazing with the kulcha. It was very creamy and cheesy and the perfect dip. For dinner we ordered the paneer pinwheel, two garlic naans and one cheese naan. The paneer pinwheel has 3 big paneers and a lot of sauce. The sauce/gravy was delicious and garlicy and flavorful and the naan was some of the best we've had. The garlic was roasted on top just the way we like it. The cheese naan was also delicious and soft on the inside. Overall I loved this place for their ambiance, great service, variety of drinks/beers, and exotic menu.

We ordered oysters, goat cheese kulcha, cauliflower 65, dahi puri, paneer pinwheel, lamb kheema, buttered pao and avocado and yogurt chutney.I loved the paneer pinwheel and Dahi Puri. Goat cheese kulcha was flavorless and had 0 flavor of goat cheese... Oysters had almost no taste because the toppings did not go well with each other and each oyster was freezing cold due to shaved ice on it. The usual oysters with lemon and sauce are way better and flavorful.In addition, we also ordered 3 drinks. There was this Turmeric gin drink that was awful. I did bring it to the server's attention and to my dismay, she just smiled and said 'This is our popular drink' . No acknowledgement afterwards and she did not even offer to exchange.After paying 180$ between 3 people, I atleast expect a good service for my crew and a considerate behavior. Also, the food is overhyped.

Overall not value for money as you will be left unfulfilled. For our friends group we did reservations for months in advance. But the service was kind of not receptive to a group. Throughout the evening they did not respond well to requests , there was lack of hospitality and most importantly lack of interest in catering .In terms of food appetizers were good. (nothing like great but surely tasty) The main course was okay; dal makhani & butter chicken was rather bland and lacked aroma. Overall the kind of variety was extremely limited and there was nothing like what you expect from speciality fusion place in terms innovation & quality . The desserts were bit sugary & had more decoration than substance.The huge problem was they did not serve enough quantities for each of is. It was not ala carte menu and so they gave a fixed limited quantity of one single dish which at least  4 /6 people has to share. Many of us were left with rather empty stomachs even though everyone was charged individually for full meal.  The only nice thing about it is ambiance ; but if that all you want then better go to a lounge!",0,0,0,Nihi S.,"Plainsboro Township, NJ",0,15,0

Absolutely delicious. The lamb keema was also a winner. The pao included was soft and doughy, an excellent complement to the lamb stew, which was well balanced spice-wise and not too oily.Our server told us to skip the thali, so we got mostly small appetizers. I didn't love the goat cheese pulcha as much as I thought I might, maybe because it arrived first so there was nothing to eat it with. Tasted a bit plain on its own.

We didn't have any problems getting a reservation for 8:30 pm.We tried most of their innovative, smartly named cocktails, and they were all good and refreshing too.For food, definitely try the Dahi Puri ($9) and Chicken 65 ($14). If you only want to have a single appetizer, Lamb Kheema Hyderabadi ($15) is a no-brainer.The second time we went here, we were a group of 4 on a Friday night. The earliest we could get a table was at 10 pm. We were particularly disappointed with our experience the second time because we really wanted to try out the Vegetarian and the Non-Vegetarian thali and were told, that they did not have both. This to us was very disappointing. The team also got our order wrong. We had ordered a Chicken 65 and were served Cauliflower 65. This was rectified later when we informed them that our order was incorrect.Food is just okay, definitely on the expensive end and price-to-portion ratio isn't that great.On both occasions, service did stand out and the staff was welcoming enough, 1 star just for them!",8,2,4,Ameya B.,"New York, NY",494,312,589

At this point it was almost midnight and 1.5 hrs since we were seated. The manager was apologetic and we asked to speak to the owners who were pacifying another table of irate customers.

One person in our party did not receive her appetizer a full 15 minutes after the rest of us had finished and then went on to get it after we asked twice. Once our appetizer plates were cleared, we waited and waited and our entrees never showed up. At this point, when we demanded to speak to the manager, they made a feeble attempt to make it better by offering us complimentary dessert. The manager only came to speak to us only after us repeatedly refusing the complimentary dessert. Note that at this point, we had still not received our entrees. When they finally did bring out the food, everything except my entree showed up(which finally never came).

Unfortunately, I think I am  stuck on my traditional indian classics and therefore was not a huge fan of the food ( except for one dish) I made a 10 pm dinner reservation on Friday and wanted to sit near the painting. The hostess accommodated to that request well.The first thing I noticed was the waiter was extremely stand offish ( I understand it's late, he must be tired). For example, when I asked for vegetarian options he literally sighed, then put his hand on his head, took quite a long time to answer and gave a few options. He made me seem like I asked something ridiculous. After reviewing the menu, I found that there aren't too many vegetarian options. Dai puri- I would say skip as it has an I'm uncomfortable sour after taste but a cool take on a classic. Pin wheel paneer- AMAZING if I could I would only get this next time I go there and just get two order and naan. This was very delicious, spicy with a well balanced sweetish sauce surrounding the pinwheel.Truffle mushrooms- interesting but was not a fan at all. I def commend the innovative take. The bottom of this dish tasted like a grit version of khicadi All and all- this restaurant has a gorgeous interior decoration ( but def recommend keeping up with the cleanliness near the bar esp if it will stay open late night.

None of them were anything to write home about and definitely not worth the price tag.The service was horrible with the servers rudely putting down the dishes without explaining them. Our server messed up a lot of what we ordered and charged us for a dish we didn't even order. Needless to say we skipped dessert and got out of this place as soon as we could.

4.0,5/30/2018,"We went here to celebrate a friend's bday. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and loved the dahi puri, alu tikki and lamb keema the most - resembles very little to authentic Indian food. My friends swore by the malai tikka for the chicken lovers out there. We welcomed the modernity spin to most of the traditional dishes. The kulchas were nice and buttery and an excellent pairing with their chutneys - we got cilantro mint, ginger alam, and the chilli one. I loved their butter chicken the most with garlic naan. The butter chicken was more tomato based than loose cream and butter, very flavorful, just the way I like it. The lamb shank was the only dish that felt out of place and was disappointing- pretty bland and flavorless. The drinks were interesting as per my friends. My virgin mango mohito was more on the 'spicier' side so it was mehh. Overall the food was great, a good spin on fine modernity. Note this is not an authentic dining spot. Good food for the money - however if you go with drinkers, be prepared to be doomed.

They were good, but again I've had way better Indian food / Indian fusion. The octopus is bland and their naan to soft. Also, (and I totally get mistakes happen so that's not my issue) first the wrong bread order came out. The waiter took it back and put in the right order. All good there. Then when the order came out, we were told they were out of the ham. That's a major part of the order. Then, when the bill came, the incorrect bread order was still on the bill.

4.0,5/15/2018,"Baar Baar's modern Indian menu and atmosphere intrigued me, and I knew it would be the perfect spot for a dinner with my food-appreciating college friends.  Upon my arrival, I instantly recognized the sprawling ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows that used to belong to the Italian L'Apicio.  The new inhabitants of the space kept the previous classy elegance, but added an Asian influence, such as wall murals of mystical Indian folk.  The restaurant was not very busy, so we were immediately seated for our reservation.  My friends had arrived a little earlier than I had and had already ordered beverages, so I had needed to catch up.  I selected the Calcutta Cup cocktail, a tart and spicy blend of Michter's Bourbon, Isle of Skye 8 year, Mango Ginger, Citrus, Honey, and Grapefruit Bitters.  The powerful drink, which they declared their ""take on Penicillin, the famous modern classic invented in New York City"", was certainly a boozy remedy!   In fact, we spent so long catching up that we wound up ordering a second round of beverages along with our meal.  At that point, I had decided to change over to wine, but asked to sample two varieties before making my selection.  I found the 2016 Cantina Mogoro Vermentino Di Sardegna Le Giare from Sardinia too acidic, so instead I opted for the 2016 Domaine Pichot Vouvray hailing from Loire, France, which had floral notes.Speaking of our meal, we had determined that the best course of action was to order a multitude of courses from various sections of the menu.  Of course we needed to start with one of their top-selling Kulchas, homemade sourdough breads filled with various stuffings.  We were all drawn to the sweet-sounding Kashmiri Duck and Apricot version, which was fluffy and enjoyable, but would have benefitted from even more filling, especially additional apricots.  We ordered a three Homemade Chutneys to accompany our bread.  The Tomatillo and Green Mango was a chunky jam packed with sweet heat.  The Ginger Alam also packed a kick, while Cilantro and Mint cooled our taste buds.  We munched on the breads and dips while exploring our selection of small plates.  The Tuna Bhel was essentially a tartare with chunks of raw tuna, avocado, and green mango, which was topped with puffed black rice and tamarind to incorporate the Indian essence.  The Paneer Chili did not arrive as expected, but totally blew us away.  Crispy Kataifi was wrapped like a bird's nest around the spicy, saucy cottage cheese.  Globs of Ginger Chutney and Lemon Achar Gel were added to the plated as dipping sauces.  Sadly, our party of four only received three of these crunchy bites, so we were each unable to enjoy a full nugget.  The Pork Belly starter included thick, long slices of meat that had been sweetly marinated in a sticky sauce of pomegranate and ginger.  Toppings of pickled radish and masala cracklings added acid, spice, and texture.  The Tandoori Octopus with a peanut chutney was well- cooked, but needed more seasoning in order to be memorable.We then proceeded to two larger plates that had both been ""must-try's"" in our minds.  The Tandoori Mushroom was heavenly!  A small crockpot of polenta was topped with roasted mushrooms, fresh truffle, and Tandoori seasonings.  While the oven preparation was traditionally Indian, the polenta seemed out of place.  The Monkfish and Seafood Alleppey Curry, with its inclusion of sunchokes and fennel oil, was also an interesting mash-up of Eastern and Western flavors.  We were glad that we had ordered a side of Saffron Rice to satisfyingly soak up the hefty curry sauce.  However, it would have been better if the rice was complimentarily included.Baar Baar provided us with a fun environment and unique meal that gave us even more to discuss than what had been happening in our lives since our last visit.  I would categorize the restaurant with other immersive Asian-influenced, experiential restaurants, such as Tao and Buddakan.",6,3,7,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

5.0,5/10/2018,"Came here on a Thursday night around 7pm with a reservation made a few days before. The restaurant has a modern and chic ambience, with a bar on the right hand side, and painted walls. There is a waiting area to the right of the entrance, where my boyfriend and I sat while waiting for our friends to arrive. The restaurant hostess would not seat us until they came. After being seated, we ordered an array of dishes, including the butter chicken, green pea and goat cheese kulcha, chicken 65, and the tandoori mushroom. The green pea and goat cheese kulcha was a delicious bread, baked to perfection with a warm interior of goat cheese that added a delightful soft texture to the bread. The chicken 52 was deep fried, but retained a crisp exterior, while remaining tender on the inside. It was flavorsome, spicy, and served with a sour lemon cream that added the perfect contrast to the hot, spicy chicken. Out of our main dishes, the tandoori mushroom was the more inventive and modern, served with polenta and truffles. The polenta and truffles paired excellently with the mushrooms, and though the serving was large, I finished it all there. My boyfriend's butter chicken was also delightful, and probably one of the best butter chicken dishes (if not the best!) that I've had in New York.All the dishes were presented nicely. Though we didn't eat dessert that night, the desserts at Baar Baar sound interesting, and mix elements of traditional Indian cuisine with modern flavors, and am looking forward to trying these on another visit. Unfortunately, a damper was put on our night as we were not able to be seated until our friends arrived (who were quite late). The restaurant was not full when we came in, so we didn't really see why it was an issue. Anyway, aside from that hiccup, we really enjoyed dining here. Highly recommend coming to Baar Baar for delicious food.

5.0,5/10/2018,"My friends and I had a dinner reservation at Baar Baar last Saturday night. Our table was reserved for 8:30pm but because the restaurant was overbooked, the table we were promised was occupied by the previous party until 9:10pm. We weren't very happy about this but were fine with waiting. When the table finally became available, the owner decided to seat his friends on it instead. We were furious. The next table only became available at 9:30pm, meaning we waited an hour to be seated in spite of having made reservations. I'm not usually one to let this kind of behavior fly, but the owners and staff were incredibly courteous and apologetic throughout the entire ordeal. Not only did they recognize that they were at fault, but they also sent my friends and I free champagne and a complimentary portion of the (amazing) Kaali Daal when we eventually sat down, which we hadn't even asked for! And the food was just incredible. We ordered pretty much everything on the menu and all of it was great. Some of our personal favorites were the gol gappe (probably the best in the city), the butter chicken, the lamb keema, the cauliflower 65, the daal, and the tandoori octopus. The carrot cake dessert was the absolute perfect end to the meal. The actual plating is also visually stunning. I haven't been this satisfied by a meal in the longest time! If you love Indian food, this restaurant is definitely in same league as Tamarind and Babuji. The actual space is pretty big and beautifully decorated. The interiors have a very modern but royal aesthetic to them. The mural on the wall is beautiful and I don't think I've ever seen a bar as cool as their's at an Indian restaurant in New York.

So this is a new restaurant, and like most new restaurants, the opening months are never smooth sailing.  I came here a week after it first opened. The staff was very nervous, but the food was amazing and the decor and ambience were great. The theme or edge of this restaurant is gastronomy. Reminds me a bit of Gaggan's restaurant in Thailand (Michelin star Indian restaurant). I went there a couple years ago when it was still underrated and new. Baar Baar is definitely aiming for a more refined type of Indian cuisine just like Gaggan, in other words, to give Indian food a better reputation. I like the direction it's taking with Indian food.

We ordered butter chicken, mustard gravy fish, paneer pinwheel and dal and sides of saffron rice (since we already had way too much bread during appetizers!).

3.0,4/15/2018,"Baar Baar is a great addition to the neighborhood.  Off Second Avenue, on First Street, the space is impressive with high ceilings and comfortably spaced seating.  Notwithstanding the dim lighting, it is quite inviting and trendy.A group of us tried a number of small plates from the menu, including the dahi puri (recommended!), paneer chilli, black dairy dal, tomato kut and the asparagus pepper fry.  We also got some of the kulchas, notably one with green pea and goat cheese.  The choice of full plates or the thali aren't what one would expect in an Indian restaurant.  I realize they are ""celebrating Indian heritage through a New York lens"" (whatever that means), but Baar Baar will likely not have sustainable demand from discerning foodies if they do not bring a more traditional Indian selection to the menu.Kudos to the chef and owner for trying something innovative.  I will return (after all, the name would suggest ""again and again"") to try the thali and other items.",5,3,3,Srini V.,"Manhattan, NY",467,463,97
5.0,4/10/2018,"Best higher end Indian in NYC. We had an incredible experience at Baar Baar last night and will 100% be back. I just don't know if I will order the same delicious things or try everything else that looked just as incredible. I wrote a detailed account of everything we ate and drank below. TL:DR - it's tough to go wrong as there wasn't anything in our big order we didn't like. I appreciated the traditional flavors, big portions, and surprising elegant twists in every dish. I am tired of ""fancy"" indian places with their gimmicky nonsense but Baar Baar absolutely crushed Bombay Bread Bar and Babuji and Pondicherry. While Indian Accent may be a better end to end meal, if you aren't looking for a super expensive tasting menu then ala carte at Baar Baar is the best in NYC.Our orders:SMALL PLATES AND APPSGreen pea and goat cheese kulcha: I am usually not one for ""fancy"" kulchas because they are always tiny and underwhelming (@indianaccent, @bombaybreadbar) but this was delicious, fluffy, big, and perfect by itself or with some chutneyDahi Puri: Half our table (including me) loved this very refreshing sweet, sour, crunchy, and light take on a indian street favorite. The other half thought it was a little too sweet and not enough yogurt but to each their own. This is one of the better high end chaat I have tastedCauliflower 65: Beautiful dish with crunchy big pieces of cauliflower but the star was the curd-rice mousse which we lapped up with our kulchas and papad. I could have done with a little spicier on the dish but the flavor was incredible.Kashmiri lamb ribs: Order this. Now. I will be back after a rough day at work and grab a seat on the bar and just order these and a cocktail. There is no way to not be happy afterwards.Tandoori octopus: This wasn't my favorite dish because I like my octopus a little tougher. It was cooked down to a very soft texture. The spicy flavor was awesome. The surprise of the dish though was millet pongal that the octopus was sitting on, delicious! Would have a bowl of that by itself with some raita :)Papad Thali: This came out first and was bombarded by our photographers at the table. I think 5 different papads, with a couple pieces of each and everything was cleaned out. The avocado achar and yogurt chutney was my favorite. I didn't care for the green mango as much and will probably try the pineapple kut next time.ENTREESPaneer Pinwheel: Holy s***. This is a chef speciality and something I could have every week. It captures the traditional essence of a buttery, flavorful Delhi style makhani but the added roasted red peppers and chili oil drizzle elevated it to something I have never tasted before. Order extra naan!Market Fish with bengal mustard cream: The fish of the day was a sea bass that had been cooked in a banaleaf with what I think was mint chutney inside and then bathed in mustard on top. Everyone that took a bite of this sat back afterwards and shook their head thinking how fish can be this good. The dish had a couple of the folks at our table remembering their mom's traditional south indian cooking. Absolutely stunning, beautiful fish. It comes whole so if thats not your thing...deal with it cause its worth it. Lamb Shank Nihari: I was expecting something a bit different here. While the curry was flavorful with that gamey lamb tinge but traditional ginger based north indian flavor, I think the dish overall was overshadowed by the other all stars at the table. The meat was tender and didn't need a fork or knife - just spoon it straight off the bone.SIDESAvocado and garlic raita: Everyone enjoyed the raita but I wouldn't say it was as good as other items in the meal. i like my raita a little tangy and thinner and this was more thick like dahi.Plan naan and safron rice: the portions are pretty good. I would order one per 2 people of each. but we were also pretty stuffed from the meal at this point haha.DESSERTS (OMG SO GOOD)Coconut based ice cream something dessert:I dont know what we ate here but ask for the coconut dessert because it was just incredible. it was a double frozen ice cream and custard mix that was sweet and flavorful with tons of spices on top. Carrot Halwa Cake:This was a carrot halwa that was fried into a cake and topped with kesar kulfi and a bunch of other delicious stuff. This was our favorite. Chocolate Pave:Kind of a take on a chocolate lava cake but more deconstructed. For the first time chocolate didn't win at our table not because it wasn't great but everything else was so damn good. DRINKSKahwa-Chai: My wife got this and its a rum based spiced chai cocktail served in a tea cup with a big tea server thing. Beautiful presentation with an equally delicious and perfect cocktail. Everyone loved it (we passed it around haha)Calcutta Cup: Indian version of the penicillin. I had this and it was spicy with the ginger with a honey aftertaste along with a smoky lingering from the michter's bourbon. Loved it.",3,0,0,Rohit K.,"New York, NY",39,28,28

However I was disappointed that with 3 of us they have is such a small table. We were early  and seating could be better. The food was excellent with appetizers like fresh oyster, tandoori octopus, potato tiki. For main courses we had the bone marrow kulcha, lamb ribs, pork belly, baked chicken malai tikka and the lamb shank. Impressed that the chef noticed that we did not order nanns and he sent some out gratis. Service was good but I noticed at aRoqa their manager came around a few times to check on us , not so here .

5.0,3/30/2018,"As a fellow brown guy, I find it difficult to pay for Indian food when some of the best you can get is at home. Nevertheless, I passed this place on the way to a neighboring steak house and it intrigued me. We showed up on a Thursday night and were immersed to a whole different world. A beautiful bar with loads of goodness waiting to be consumed on the shelves. Mixologists fracking eggs in tot heir drinks to make for a great foamy head on their sour drinks and a very lounge like atmosphere. We were seated immediately and were happy to see that their drink prices weren't inflated like other places nearby. The food was definitely on the expensive side but we walked away full and didn't feel ripped off at all. We got the following:1. Lamb rib appetizer2. Badam chops with beets3. Monk fish entree4. Beef short rib5. Bone marrow, potato and cheese kulcha 6. Halwa cake with kulfi7. Side of saffron rice - MAKE SURE YOU ORDER THISeverything that we ordered was perfectly executed. The kulcha was the best I ever had in my life and every single drink we had will rival the top cocktail lounges in the city. I would come back just for the bar alone.  The carrot cake was good but I would've preferred to have a big bowl of the kulfi instead.

5.0,3/24/2018,"One of the most inventive and delicious modern Indian places we've tried!Lamb keema (5 stars) - ground lamb, super savory with just as touch of heat, topped with a potato foam. Comes with a challah like toast. This was so addictive and satisfying!Non veg thali (4 stars) - best part was the prawn sausage (5 stars). Very strong on the prawn flavor and super moist! Went very well as suggested by our server with the sriracha mayo. Other components in descending order of tastiness included the duck roll, scotch egg, and kofta.Cauliflower 65 (4.5 stars)- again very savory, cooked until just tender without being raw or mushy with a nicely fried crust. Comes with a super airy cauliflower mousse (how did they do this??) and yogurt sauce.Duck and apricot kulcha (4 stars)- tasted like the duck from the thali roll, moist and shredded, with a not too sweet apricot chutney. Would try the naan over this next time. Was really interesting but as it cooled the texture became a tad rubbery. Coconut dessert (5 stars)- one of the highlights of the night. A crispy coconut ""bread pudding"" with coconut ice cream and coconut custard that was similar to a Chinese steamed milk dessert. Was both a nostalgic and innovative dessert; loved it!We got the chai cocktail, which was fun and came in a teapot. Would try something else next time but was lovely in presentation.

4.0,3/22/2018,"Finally got to try Baar Baar last week and I am impressed! I made another reservation before I even fished my meal :) Yup, that good!Having been to many other trendy ""modern Indian"" in downtown and left feeling underwhelm, I became somewhat cynical. And Baar Baar is situated in the young and rich hippsterland - Noho, that even further my suspicion. But again, I am a contrarian,so I went ahead anyway. Came in on the early side of Thursday evening, greeted by the lovely host and quickly being seated at table facing the bar where I had unobtrusive view of the gorgeous dinning space. It was lively but not to the point being noisy. This is absolutely the perfect place to be if you are trying to impress your date. Wine list, menu and water were served in no time. Since I was dinning solo as usual, decided to stick with small plates so I can try a few. There were plenty interesting small plates to choose from; the theme was clearly traditional ingredients with European twist.Fave of the night was the Kashmir lamb ribs: smokey, sweet-savory and melt-in-your-mouth tender. Went absolutely flawless with the pinot I picked out. I will come back for this alone. The tandoori octopus was what most people jazzed about. It was baked then flashily seared, delivered incredibly tender texture yet crispy on the outside. The accompany millet pongal packed with turmeric fragrance,  bringing the dish to an earthy tone. It was def good but not mind blowing good. I certainly had better octopus dish.The beetroot murabba was refreshing but too sour to my taste.Above all though, the main reason I would come back was the impeccable services and extensive, curated wine selection. Matt, the wine manager, was super helpful, offering me a few tasting before I found the one I liked.

The first time I came was a weeknight with a good friend - we had a reservation but probably didn't need one. We started out with two delicious cocktails from their innovative cocktail menu - loved both of them (though I don't remember their names right now!). We then ordered the veg kulcha, the veg thali and the paneer pinwheel main. The restaurant surprised us by bringing us a bunch of complimentary apps as well. They were all INCREDIBLE. I've never seen or tasted anything like the paneer pinwheel before. It was fantastic.  I came a second time with my boyfriend (as I was raving about this place to him for weeks and we finally made it back) on a Saturday. This time, we definitely needed our reservation - the place was packed. Ordered another great cocktail off the menu. My boyfriend had the duck kulcha, the foie gras and the lamb keema hyderabadi. I had the potato tikki and  the paneer pinwheel again. Everything we got was delicious.

The décor is definitely unique and the vibe is sexy and sultry which would make it great for a date or girls/boys night out. First, the cons. The menu is modern Indian so if you want a hearty Indian meal this isn't the spot. The portions aren't huge like a traditional Indian restaurant as this is more upscale and modern (I left feeling hungry). Also expect steeper prices than a traditional Indian spot. All in all, my point is that this restaurant isn't your traditional Indian restaurant but that's a good thing when you want a modern take on classical dishes.  The food was above average (although not exceptional) and the drinks were average (they could be stronger and were quite pricey).

We got the chicken 65, dahi puri, paneer roll up, and daal which were all excellent. We also ordered the pea kulcha which was probably the most underwhelming part of the night yet still good.

4.0,2/20/2018,"I'm just a chubby Filipino who likes to eat. I grew up in Edison, NJ (little India). I am pretty adventurous when it comes to food so there isn't too much I don't like to eat. The only food that I can think of that I don't like is black licorice. Anything else, I am game.I went with my childhood friends (they are Indian), and had a blast!Drinks: I usually just drink whisky with a couple ice cubes but wanted to try these cocktails that you can't get anywhere else.NEW DELHI SOUR was just ok by itself but once the food came out the drink jumped up a couple levels because it was the perfect drink to go with the food. I had a Pilsner later on with the food and it had me wishing I ordered something else.HYDERABAD COLLINS- Had a sip of my friend's towards the end of the meal and it was amazing. I wish I ordered this instead of the beer.Naturally, my other friends in the group had some whisky. Decent 2 finger pour on a drink ordered neat.  Other friend requested the 2 by 2 big block ice cube.Food:We ordered a bunch of small plates. There were different kinds of naan with filling, bread, and chutney that came out with the small plates that were excellent. I couldn't keep track if they were small plates of their own or if they were included with them. I don't remember all of the food we had but here's the ranks and what stood out for me:1. BEETROOT MURABBA - I'm a meat eater so this surprised me and the table that the veggie dishes came out on top. I would have never ordered this if I was on my own. I am so glad someone picked this.2. KASHMIRI LAMB RIBS- To die for. Perfectly done. I had the last scrawny pick of the four ribs too. (I am too slow).3. HEIRLOOM TOMATO KUT- Another veggie dish in top three?  I never knew.4. DUCK AND FOIE GRAS HALEEM - I love duck.5. DAHI PURI- This came out first with three different chutneys. 6. TUNA BHEL - light and refreshing7.PORK BELLY - Good flavor but I was expecting it to be crispy 8. TANDOORI OCTOPUS - All I remember is i liked it.9. LAMB KEEMA HYDERABADI - They served a good size portion. One friend said it was a little salty. You just need to eat it with some bread and its perfect. 10. Fresh Oysters- Different. Maybe I'm not a fan of the lemon foam. Smaller sized oysters.They also said they brought out a couple complimentary dishes, but we thought we ordered them so that made it confusing. The complimentary chicken dish they brought out was pretty good too.Even though, we were stuffed we ordered the gold standard of Indian restaurants, the Chicken Makhani. It was on point. It passed the test.   Desert: We ordered the CARROT HALWA CAKE but they were out so we ordered the COCONUT DOUBLE KA MEETHA instead. Things happen for the BEST reason. Two thumbs up! Service: There were four of us, so we were making the servers cut everything into equal pieces. They were fine with the requests and were very upbeat and always had smiles on their faces even though we kept asking what each item was.If you are in a rush, you might get impatient. You know how we Americans demand everything now. It was a Sunday night and the server was handing tables on both sides of the restaurant so she went missing for a while. Maybe someone called out? If you are not in a rush, enjoy the time with your friends, admire the many bottles of liquor on the wall, or maybe even people watch. Don't worry the server will come back. Bathrooms are unisex. There's 7 or 8 individual rooms so it was unusual for me being a guy having to wait in line for a bathroom at a restaurant. We were also worried that we would come out of the place smelling of Indian Food. That was not the case. This is not that kind of place.Being that my friends are Indian I was surprised an Indian restaurant was chosen by them. It's hard to beat home cooking. I see now that they were right. Modern New York Indian food is very different than the traditional New Jersey Indian food. You definitely can't get this type of Indian food in New Jersey. Good food, with good people, equals good times for me.",0,1,0,Fred S.,"Edison, NJ",0,1,0
5.0,2/18/2018,"Okay I am almost regretaful for giving more rave reviews to this place as I don't want to share this place with anyone!  Lol my experience was spectacular! Literally from the beginning to end everything was flavorful and unique my taste buds were in another dimension. We got the following:Goat cheese kulcha: a must! Soft and cheesy with a hint of truffle. Amazing to pair with anything else ordered. Baked chicken malai tikka: really creamy,Very chicken heavy... but quality chicken heavy so if you like a good quality chicken and a rich decadent cream sauce this is a real winner.Cauliflower 65: This gave me life. I was immediately struck by the sensory awakening aroma then the complex and complimentary mix of peanut and masala flavors with the most refreshing pairing of mouse I have ever had. This is a must! Especially when you get bread and meat based items this is delicious and serves as a great balance. Butter chicken: splendid. Decadent, bursting with flavor, rich, creamy, with again great quality chicken. For anyone who has ever had butter chicken before and has had chicken that didn't taste quite right... that speaks to the quality of the chicken and this chicken was of very high quality. I am more of a sauce than meat kind of person but I certainly ate the chicken portions of the dish equally. Dessert: we got the chocolate.. even if you feel like you know I am full enough.. get the chocolate dessert. It will literally blow your mind and explode in your mouth. It was really like a party in your mouth. The contrasting mix of chocolate mouse, soft and delicate brownie, orange flavored ice cream, and some sort of sort of flavored quinoa was nothing short of magical.. we usually split a dessert if we ever get a dessert and I think we both agreed that Next Time we will each get our ownBaar Baar means again and again.. so we will most definitely be back again and again!",1,0,1,Hawa A.,"New York, NY",2,11,0

It was packed! I sat at the bar and just ordered a few appetizers. Service was slow but I think they were just at capacity and understaffed that night. I went back again last night around 7PM and we were able to get seated right away. This time I did a few apps and entrees. Appetizers:Green pea and goat cheese kulcha- YUM. The goat butter makes this bread taste incredible. Get it. Dahi Puri- this is one of my favorite snack foods so I am biased but I've ordered it both times. Definitely try it. Light and easy, shareable and delicious.Potato Tikki- this was good not amazing. Paneer Chilli - had a strong flavor of ginger and a good kick. Baked Chicken- this was very well seasoned and prepared. Really enjoyed it! Cauliflower 65- not a fan. Lacking in flavor. Entree:Traditional butter chicken- this was very good. Had it with plain naan and saffron rice - need to order both. Black Daal- delicious Raita- delicious and helps balance out and spice with the food Masala Chai- good but I've had better at home.

The motivation for the one star is that my credit card was overcharged by the restaurant.  I reached to them about one week after dining there. They informed me that would look into it and follow up with me once they had a chance to check with the server.One month later there has been no follow up and no correction to the charge.  Disappointing that stuff like this happens.  Perhaps there is a good explanation but the restaurant clearly didn't see the need to resolve the matter.",0,0,0,N J.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,1,0

We also ordered the Green Pea and Cheese Kulcha, Paneer Chili, Calucutta Cup and Sattu Sharbat. The place was relatively quiet and heard on Fridays and the weekends it becomes very busy.

2.0,2/8/2018,"Having heard a lot about this new Indian place, we decided to try it out on a weeknight. We entered the restaurant at 7 pm and asked for a table for 3, and they asked if we had reservations, upon saying no, they asked us to wait a minute and started consulting a computer, while the restaurant had 3 diners!!Seated at last, our waiter came to us immediately and asked if we were ready to order, what? We hadn't looked at the menu yet! He came back to us 4 more times in the span of the next 4 minutes (not an exaggeration) and kept asking if he could put some items from the menu on hold for us (what does that even mean!!?)We placed an order for a few apps, which he was dismissive of, saying we would need more food and he was happy to take an order of a main or two and keep it on hold,...we refused and waited for the foodIt came out almost immediately, making us unsure of the  qualityThe kulcha was pretty good, though pricey for a piece of bread, and the dahi puri and asparagus really sucked....dahi puri tasted nothing like good Indian fast food, and the asparagus was very limp and bland, the cauliflower foam was just tasteless...We also asked for the veg thali, at which point we were told it won't be enough and asked again to order some more food he could put on hold...so bizarre!Honestly, the veg thali was very disappointing, it was just little bits of all fried foods thrown together (like an apps platter you would get at a sports bar)....we ate it but were not super happy with it. The portions for everything were so tiny, we could see why our waiter was insisting on more food, so we got the Veg Pulao and the market fish (special of the day)I have to say, sooooo disappointed! The pulao sucked, no flavor and I can make much better at home..the market fish, well, the spices used heaped their dense flavors on you rather than compliment the fish, and it was super super spicyDessert we tried the thandai, which was a nice surprise after all the disappointments, but again, it was so minuscule, it seemed like a waste of moneyOh, we also got drinks, and the order was mixed up so that the egg white was on top of another drink instead of the whiskey sour and the traditionally flavored drinks really were yucky....something ghee something was super bad..All in all, we paid over 150 for a dinner that we left feeling hungryNot to mention annoyed at the pushiness of our waiter, this is one place we will visit ""never never""",2,0,0,Sensible R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,69,6

2.0,2/2/2018,"Long story short, there is so much good Indian food in the neighborhood that you can probably skip skip Baar Baar. First of all, we made an 8:45pm reservation a couple weeks ago... We didn't get seated until almost 10:00pm, which is absolutely ridiculous. Obviously, if I had any idea I would wait over an hour to eat, I would have left, but every time we checked in with the hostess (8:50, 9:30, 9:45, 9:55), we were constantly told they were just waiting for someone to pay. Actually, scratch that, at 9:30, when I complained it was already 45 minutes past our reservation time I was told ""Madame, I'm not the owner."" At 9:55, we were told that we were supposed to be seated next, but the owner just sat someone else. While waiting, we had some cocktails at the bar. I like the names of the drinks and the look/style of the menu, but the badam lassi was awful. The berry punch and calcutta cup were much better. We saw a few tables open up in the bar area. I have no idea if those are reserved tables or not. In retrospect, we should have sat there, but then again, we had no idea it would take over an hour for our table to be ready.Finally, we sit down, and at this point, everyone in our group is in such a crappy mood. We ordered dahi puri, lamb keema, butter chicken, and cauliflower 65. Enjoyed everything minus the dahi puri. It took forever for the food to come out, and when it did, the waiter did not tell us what it was. They also offered a couple complimentary dishes, but never explicitly stated it was offered on the house (maybe to make up for long wait time to sit down, who knows). There were some parker house style rolls, that we're still not sure if they were free or again, on the house. Food was good, but again, there are tons of good Indian restaurants in the area. Nothing was so amazing that it was worth putting up with the awful service. To elaborate on service... no one ever apologized for the long wait for the table. Additionally, we ordered another round of drinks, which never came, and once we finished our food, we canceled them. One of the drinks was a beer, it came in a can, and should not take over 45 minutes to arrive. Finally, at the end of the night I asked to speak to the manager. He was the first person to offer any sort of apology. He really should have stopped by our table earlier, at least to check-in, and see how things were going, or apologize when we were seated for the insane wait time. It would have been nice if he offered to comp some of the bill, bring the round of drinks that never came, or a free dessert. Instead, he told me to email him, and that no amount of free things will make up for the poor dining experience. The only reason this has 2 stars is because the food was good, and I liked the vibe/decor of the restaurant. It would have been nice if they were straight up when we showed up, and admitted that they overbooked reservations, or that they were backed up with seating people.

2.0,2/2/2018,"When you commit to a ""modern"" take of a particular cuisine, you must also promise to retain the integrity of the food. Baar Baar disappointed us in that regard, throughout the dinner, ""again and again"". We had the green pea kulcha, which was good, the Kashmiri short ribs, the Hyderabadi keema and the non veg thali. The thali and kulcha were by far the best items from the experience and they were fairly average. As a Kashmiri, I take offense to the fact that they have appropriated the traditional ""Tabak maaz"", and corrupted it by making it incredibly fatty. The real thing  retains a delicate balance of sweet and sour flavors and Baar Baar's short ribs fall tragically short.

We did not get our reserved table in time, so they gave us a complimentary appetizer while waiting at the bar with drinks. The two drinks that I wanted were unavailable, taking 1/2 star off for that.Our table was to the back with curtains for privacy; hence it was quieter than the front. Our waiter was well versed in the menu and was very attentive. The leftover food was neatly packed for us, I really appreciate that.This restaurant aims for a 5 star, but I have to reserve it for next time when everything is absolutely perfect; this time there were a few hiccups.The drinks are new, fun and unique. The menu is very interesting with kulchas and small plates to start. My advice would be to do a number of these to share and skip on main course, unless Indian is synonymous  with Chicken tikka masala for you, which is delicious btw! We got the grilled octopus, malai tikka( mind blowing), lamb keema(outstanding), chicken 65( good), the veg and non veg thali. I loved the paneer in the veg thali- it was coated with crispy vermicelli noodles. Nothing else from the thali stood out though. For main course we got CTMasala and Fish with mustard sauce- it was just ok.A notable mention to all the accompanying sauces and garnishes the food is served with- makes for a nice presentation as well as enhances the taste of the dish.For dessert we got the double ka meetha.

5.0,1/27/2018,"I came here last night with my fiancé to try the food at the new Indian Gastro Pub got spot. We love trying new restaurants and this was next on our list. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left, we were showered with the highest level of hospitality I have ever seen at a restaurant. The atmosphere was amazing, comparable to a place like Vandal, with an Indian twist. The vibe was hip and young, perfectly complementing the vibe of the east village. My fiancé and I started with drinks at the bar as we waited for our table. We got the Hyderabad Collins, which was truly an outstanding drink with perfectly mixed flavors. As we were waiting, the GM/Owner, Payal Sharma, showed us around the restaurant as we were considering having one of our events there. After graciously showing us around, we were seated and she gave us some wonderful recommendations on what to order. Shortly after, our waitress came and politely recommended some course options for two people. We ordered the Green Pea Kulcha Naan with truffle and Goat butter, the dahi puri, aloo tikki, tuna bhel, and lamb keema Hyderabadi as our small plates. I can't even begin to explain how amazing and unique all the flavors of the food were. Things you would never expect to see in traditional Indian food were so well executed here that my mouth was delighted with a burst of flavor with each bite. Each thing was better than the last. The Kulcha naan was so hot and fluffy with melted goat butter and a generous amount of shaved truffle that truly blended together to make a masterpiece. The dahi puri was so light and burst of flavor after the first crunch in your mouth. The aloo tikki came with these lovely kale fritters that perfectly balanced the softness of the tikki. The tuna bhel blew my mind as to how a dish as traditional as this could be made into something playful as a sort of Indian version of tuna tartare. The lamb keema was probably one of the best things I have ever eaten. It came with these small paos and the presentation was so cute! The flavors were immeasurable and I just couldn't stop eating it. Just phenomenal. I then tried another drink, the Delhi Sour and my fiancé opted for a basic gin and tonic as we awaited our main course. We ordered the paneer pinwheel and garlic naan. We were not sure what to expect but when we saw the dish, we were mesmerized. The paneer was so flavorful and the perfect amount of spice. The sauce was so creamy and decadent that it paired perfectly with the dish. The garlic naan was so fragrant and flavorful, hot and fluffy, just perfect for scooping up the amazing sauce. Although we were stuffed, we wanted to end the meal with dessert as we hadn't had a single bad bite throughout this meal. We ordered the cassata, complements of the owner, and it was so uniquely flavored with tutti frutti, pistachio, and black pepper merangue. We are usually chocolate lovers, but this recommendation was out of this world. It was perfect to end the meal. The GM/Owner, Payal, constantly checked up on us throughout the meal to make sure we were ok and enjoying the food. She was so hospitable and very pleasant to talk to. I can't say enough about the service, the management, the staff, everyone was so warm and nice. We truly had an amazing experience there and I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone out there, especially the foodies who are looking for a different take on Indian food.

Did not stay flat) and despite attempts from several staff members to place wedges underneath it - simply wasn't going to happen.Alas, we were moved to another table and didn't get appetizers till 10.30pm, at which point was just too late. To be fair; starters were tasty but when the maincourse came (we ordered a fish dish) it had way too many smallfish bones left even after being deboned at the table.  Spoilt the experience really.The biggest upset behind the whole dinner episode was unfortunately the fact that I had asked to speak to manager about the ridiculously poor service we were getting and no one really had the courtesy to follow up or try and remediate the issues. All in all, interesting concept that has potential - but they failed to deliver for me on this particular occasion.",0,1,0,Paul J.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,0

2.0,1/21/2018,"Went here on a Saturday night with a group of 8 people.  It was largely couples and I think we were fairly low maintenance for the waitstaff.  Two drinks were ordered and each couple had two small plates and one large plate.  For $100, two drinks, two small plates and an entree (plus naan for $5) left us getting pizza an hour or so later.On the plus side, we were in this back area at a huge table that was perfect for our group.  It had a lots of large shelves near by that had lots of interesting things decorating it and it was quiet enough that we could all talk.The food and service were not quite up to snuff.  It took a while for them to bring out my entree, though all the others came out at the same time.  They gave us a dish of daal makhani as an apology - this was the best thing we got actually.  We had the cauliflower appetizer, which was battered and fried, small portion and came with a generous dollop of creamy cold sauce, sort of like cold bernaise or something.  Small and not exciting.  The asparagus was a slightly more interesting presentation - a criss cross log cabin pattern of green and white asparagus, however, flavor was lacking.  It had the same sauce as the cauliflower and seemed to also have rehydrated mushrooms, that were still somewhat hard.  (I just looked up the description of these items on the menu to verify what was going on and am now thinking the descriptions are very misleading.)  Our entree was a very small portion of butter chicken.  Sauce was very soupy - so if you didn't order rice or naan you literally would have had to eat it with a spoon.  It seemed to be boneless chicken thighs that weren't cut up and sort of separated into chunks randomly while cooking.Service was not great - dropping (butter) knives on my friends lap, I was knocked in the arm with the tray of one of the bus boys.",2,1,0,Danielle B.,"Murray Hill, Manhattan, NY",355,161,8
1.0,1/20/2018,"Would give it zero stars if we could. The most offensive dining experience in 10+ years in Manhattan. An hour and 20 minutes into the meal (while awaiting desert and our next round of drinks), the owner asked us to get off the table we were at (we were a party of two on time for our reservation) and asked we move to the ""lounge"" to make room for her next reservation of six. It wasn't a request - it was an explicit ask. This came after relentless rounds in and around our table to ""scan"" the pace at which we were eating the items we had ordered, already contributing to a sub-par dining experience - but we were choosing to find the humor in it all - until our conversation with the owner, Payal. Payal, who comes off as an entitled and unaware business owner, lacks basic communication etiquette. While I am hopeful she has some personal degree of satisfaction from pacing around the restaurant, her complete lack of self-awareness of how it influences the dining experience is shocking for someone in the restaurant industry. Our conversation escalated from confusion to shock to disappointment in seconds. To transcribe our conversation with worthy adjectives would far exceed the Yelp limits, but the punch line remains it was offensive and factually incorrect - especially the explicit mention that she needed to turn tables after ""two hours"" though we had 40 minutes to go even by her own defined appropriate dwell time. This was followed by a profusely apologetic general manager, asking we email him so they can learn from this experience. Why that required an email? Who knows.We hopped next door (Bowery Meat Company - 3 cheers for the bartending crew there) after the abysmal experience to end the night on a more uplifting note, only to then overhear the general manager from Baar Baar, presumably unaware of our presence 2 feet away (?), step in and recap the incident with us to the bartenders with factually incorrect statements. I share not because it was core to what was most disappointing about our night but because it speaks to what I imagine must be endorsed at this establishment - turn tables, there are plenty customers. The food? Some of it was fantastic and some of it average. There are plenty places I can go to get an above average meal. To be compelled to write a review at this hour of the night, drives home my complete lack of desire to ever return to Baar Baar - which ironically translates to - again and again.",13,2,1,Sonu S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0

If it was up to me, I'd come here once every week and try each and every cocktail in the menu.

We also ordered dhai puri (this was a little weird cause they make the dhai into a foam) and the pea and goat cheese kulcha (very delicious).For our mains we went with the paneer curry which was really delicious as well.

I'm excited to see the vision realized, but based on my dinner last night, it's not quite there yet in terms of execution.The space itself is beautiful - tall ceilings, plush booths, beautiful serving ware. The vibe feels similar to some of my favorite modern Indian places in London like Dishoom. The cocktail menu is ambitious and interesting, but the calcutta sour was far too sour for my taste. The wine list was great, and I loved the vast selection of wines by the glass. We tried a bunch of the plates. Everything was solid, with the vegetarian dishes (and lamb ribs!) being the ones that really shined (asparagus, pumpkin mulligatawny).There were a few snafus on the execution front - we never received the kulcha bread (which looked amazing) even though we got the accompanying chutney, there were long pauses between dishes (though they did bring out a complimentary dish to hold us over), and the kitchen got a couple of the orders mixed up with the table next to us (and ended up putting one of their drinks on our tab - make sure to check your receipt!).I hope they fix the issues - it has the potential to be a regular late night spot, and I am excited to go back to try more items on the menu.",6,0,2,Tammy K.,"New York, NY",71,224,19

5.0,12/22/2017,"I don't usually write reviews, but this experience was so good that I had to! Baar Baar just opened a few weeks ago and once we heard about it we knew we wanted to give it a shot. We ordered a few different cocktails and they were all very unique and tasted amazing. We got the Calcutta Cup, Anar Swizzle, Hyderabad Collins, and the Kahwa-Chai. Our favorites were the Calcutta Cup and the Hyderabad Collins. They both had great Indian spices that really tasted unique. We started off by ordering an appetizer we had read about online - Cauliflower 65.  Amazing!! The cauliflower was crispy and flavorful and the sour cream sauce on top worked really well with the spices in the dish. It wasn't too heavy and had the right level of spice. My husband wanted another order of this right away. So far a great start!Next we got the green pea and goat cheese kulcha which was similar to a stuffed naan and had white truffle and goat butter on top. Still drooling just thinking about it! The bread itself was super soft and fluffy and the filling added the right level of flavor. The white truffle wasn't as noticeable (there wasn't a strong truffle flavor) but the goat butter was a perfect complement to the bread. It was way more than I expected and was very delicious. Next we ordered our main course - the paneer pinwheel, which is a refined take on a paneer makhani. Alongside the paneer pinwheel we got the garlic naan, papad thali, and the black dairy daal. The paneer pinwheel was really creative and tasty (the paneer is rolled flat and then filled with spinach in a traditional tomato based gravy). I couldn't decide if the paneer or the gravy was better - the whole dish was amazing. The black dairy daal was very well balanced - the daal was velvety smooth and creamy! The garlic naan was perfect just like the kulcha. This was a perfect way pairing with the paneer pinwheel and the daal. The papad thali was so delicious! It came with 3 or 4 different types of papad and 3 different dips. Sounds so basic but you have to try it! One was a mango pickle, one was a peanut and red pepper dip, and our favorite was the yogurt mango pickle dip. This was the right balance between traditional and modern Indian food. For dessert we got the coconut ice cream with saffron mousse. This was an incredible dessert. There was a soft coconut pastry patty (tasted like a gulab jamun) with ice cream and a tasty saffron mousse on it. A great way to end the meal. Lastly, a shout-out to all of the staff at Baar Baar. We're from Texas and living in New York now and we've had a lot of restaurant experiences where the service isn't very friendly. Our waitress Ashley, who is visiting from their sister restaurant in San Francisco, was super friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and didn't hesitate when we had questions. We look forward to visiting the San Francisco restaurant and seeing her again. Also, we had the owner of the restaurant stop by and she was really nice and inviting. We'll definitely be visiting again soon - this is going to be a regular spot for us for drinks or a full dinner. It was awesome!",1,0,0,Zina P.,"Houston, TX",4,9,8

Despite making a reservation and being on time, we had to wait 45 minutes for our table (no one came to update us of our table status while we were waiting, every time we went to check with the hostess we received a standard ""we will be setting up your table shortly"" response)2. When we were seated, we had to wait another 10 mintes for our table to be set up (no silverware, no water, etc.)3. Our server came by another 10 minutes later to serve us a dish we hadn't ordered, and then looked at us and said ""you have already ordered right?""....ummmmm NO!4. After finally taking our order of small plates, he took the drinks order of half the table, and didn't bother asking the other half if they wanted drinks5.

5.0,12/4/2017,Their drinks were absolutely amazing! So many different varieties of drinks. The food was not your typical Indian plated dish but it amazed my tastebuds. Anyone who appreciates Indian flavors should definitely give this place a try!,1,0,0,Brandon O.,"Bronx, NY",95,2,0
5.0,12/1/2017,"The new spot replacing L'apicio just opened, and it continues the recent trend of great new Indian restaurants in NYC.There's a large menu consisting of some staples as well as some really great unique items. Definitely try the Tuna Bhel ($13) and the Potato Tikki ($10). Everything here is plated beautifully as well and is easy for the 'gram.The Traditional Butter Chicken ($24) is also great for an entree and there are some beautiful desserts as well. Definitely recommend as a nice date spot.",25,6,21,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
