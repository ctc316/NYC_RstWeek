5.0,4/5/2019,"North Square is a very classy, civilized, and old-school restaurant for the older crowd. I came here for a small school event, hosted by a billionaire entrepreneur in their private dining room with a personal waitress and bartender, just to give you an idea. The service was excellent, with them pacing us well, and the food was super ""celebrity chef""-style and innovative. I got the chopped salad with quail egg, the pumpkin salmon entree, and the apricot pear crisp. I loved the combination of the flavors of each dish, and thought every bite was flawless. I didn't leave too full. The three-course meal left me the perfecto level of satisfied. You can tell their menu is well thought-out! I recommend North Square for more mature diners or professional, quiet meals in a rustic atmosphere.",3,1,6,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",978,2060,1393
5.0,3/31/2019,We went to the jazz brunch today and it was fabulous. The food was delicious and the portions were large. But the prices were reasonable. Great jazz and no cover charge for the jazz like some of the other places. We will definitely go again.,0,0,0,barbara b.,"Irvine, CA",0,13,0
2.0,3/24/2019,"Eek, not a very good experience. Important to note that this restaurant is in a hotel and maybe it meets the needs of transient hotel guests who don't know any better, but as a native New Yorker, I can tell you that this restaurant is absolutely not worth going to.Ambiance: As others have mentioned, this is not a place to go for ambiance. It feels as though you are in a pretty old and farty restaurant that could be connected to a cheap hotel/motel. Nobody under 65 in this restaurant, which is not necessarily a problem, if the food and service was good, but unfortunately it wasn't.Food: Better than the ambiance, but not great. We had the tuna tartare which was okay, nothing special. We shared the rack of lamb and filet mignon. The rack of lamb was prepared nicely and was overall good. The filet was not very good -- heavily over-seasoned with peppercorn which overtook the meat. Sides of undercooked steak fries and uninspiring onions also did nothing to enhance the filet. Nothing special here.Service: Sadly, this might have been the worst of all. We had a waitress who simply didn't put much effort in (which maybe isn't surprising given the overall mediocrity of the restaurant itself). For starters, we had some questions about various dishes, and she was unable to really answer any of them. For one of the dishes, she told us ""It's hard to explain, you just have to try it to understand."" That might be the most unhelpful response -- she must have failed to realize that part of her job is to be able to provide insights about the food to diners so that they can make more informed decisions about what they want to order. Having to try the dish to learn what it's about is not really the answer. What really got me is at the very end of the meal, our server was sitting at a booth with another worker of the restaurant. Admittedly, we were the last table in the restaurant, but even so, it's not acceptable to check out as a server and forget to keep an eye on your table. After dessert, we both had empty water glasses and our server was nowhere to be found. Finally, she emerged from hanging at her booth instead of working, and I asked for some more water. She looked down at the water jugs that had clearly already been emptied and washed out. She seemed to be a bit put out that she'd have to refill the water jug in order to be able to refill our waters. Sensing this and honestly just wanting to get out of this place, I told her it was okay and not to worry. I figured she would of course say something to the extent of ""No worries, of course I will get you some more water."" Instead, she shocked me and said ""Okay"" and proceeded to sit back down at her booth. That's right -- a customer of the restaurant asked for some more water, and she actually sat back down without getting more water instead of insisting to of course get more water. Absolute joke -- but again, not sure what standards this restaurant as a whole holds itself to, so maybe this is to be expected.Overall, with thousands of restaurants in the city, there's zero reason to spend a minute of your time or penny of your money at this uninspiring and underwhelming restaurant.",0,0,0,Jay K.,"Manhattan, NY",6,94,0
5.0,3/13/2019,"Sunday before last, I googled ""best Sunday brunch in NYC"". North Square came up as #1!!! I went there and had an awesome Sunday afternoon brunch experience! Their kale salad can't be beat! The combination of ingredients and their fresh, orange vinaigrette is simply amazing! The service is excellent....... the Jazz was ""old school "" music I grew up listening to. The entire afternoon was so enjoyable, I went back again last Sunday, and did it all over again!!

1.0,1/22/2019,"Once more, we decided to give North Square a try. The ambiance is so attractive that we had not crossed it off our list though the food has not been up to our standards. We will not be back after last night. Here's the story:My husband explained in detail to the waitress that he could not eat garlic and asked specifically about two different meat dishes. She asked the chef if there was any meat that had not been marinated with garlic and returned to say that there was one non-marinated serving of the pork tenderloin. My husband immediately ordered it.Our food was brought by a server and we began to eat, only for my husband to discover that the meat and the accompanying mashed potatoes were laden with garlic! We called the waitress, she checked in the kitchen, and returned to inform us, with embarrassment, that my husband had been given another person's dinner, not the non-garlic version that he had ordered.The waitress also said that my husband's order was almost ready and indeed it soon arrived. (By this time I had almost finished my dinner.) We were upset to see that parts were barely cooked. Again we called the waitress, and again she seemed embarrassed. The carelessness with which our food was prepared and served at North Square could not be compensated by not charging us for the 2 glasses of wine and 1 mixed drink that we drank.",1,0,0,Gail P.,"Bronx, NY",0,5,0

1.0,1/13/2019,"Just a small disclaimer that this review concerns food allergies, so if this doesn't apply to you, feel free to scroll past. I went here for breakfast with my husband last week since we were staying at the hotel next door. I'm celiac, and he eats gluten free because of me but he's not allergic. We were going to get breakfast quickly at the hotel but the hotel told us that the only gluten free options available that were safe to eat was at the restaurant, since everything else had cross-contamination risks. We went down to the restaurant and placed our order only for the server to come back and say, ""The gluten free muffins are actually touching the other muffins, we keep them side by side in the same case. Is that okay?"" I said it was fine because I didn't want to cause a scene and say I didn't think there was anything there I could really eat, as there was no actual practices in place for safe consumption - eg. my husband got gluten free toast but it was made in a shared toaster. I want to give the review one star because I don't understand why they can't just keep gluten free options separated. Why are the gluten free muffins touching the other muffins in the case when the risk for cross contamination is so high? Why can't they be stored in a separate case? How difficult would that be? It honestly feels like apathy on the restaurant's part that they would say that they have ""gluten free options"" on the menu but not ensure that these items are actually safe for people to eat.My husband had the toast, two muffins, and a sliced banana and said that it was, ""Just okay but pretty bland."" I sat there and awkwardly watched him eat while Googling actual gluten free breakfast options on my phone - luckily we found another place only a few blocks away. My true rating is 1.5 stars because I want to give half a star to the server who actually took the time to tell me that there were cross-contamination risks. If he didn't, I could have gotten seriously sick, and since I was seeing a Broadway play later that afternoon, I'm glad I didn't have to spend it in the bathroom. THANK YOU! But to the restaurant, I'm warning anyone with serious food allergies to steer clear. If a restaurant can and won't take simple steps to prevent illness in their customer, it really doesn't speak highly of that restaurant.",1,1,0,Kristin M.,"Ballston Spa, NY",2,31,15
3.0,12/29/2018,"Dinner this evening at North Square, in the Washington Square Hotel in Greenwich Village after making an OpenTable Reservation. We were seated promptly. Chef Yoel Cruz creates spectacular dishes. The ""Atichoke soup"" ($9.00) with lemon cumin croutons and chives was delicious.  No I didn't misspell that.  ""Atichoke soup""  was what it said on the menu. The coriander crusted yellowfin tuna coconut rice carrots and shiitakes, wakame and citrus soy sauce ($26.00) was ordered medium rare but arrived rare but acceptably warm. The Kale salad ($12) was good. The seared halibut ($25) with sauteed collard greens white bean ragout and romesco sauce was outstanding. Dessert was the apple cranberry crumb pie ($10) which was also excellent as was the coffee.Too bad the service was haphazard which detracted from the dining experience. They charged $1.00 more than was listed on the menu for the daily special soup and they left off the glass of wine (they said the latter was intentional). I get annoyed though when restaurants put the check on the table w/o my requesting it and w/o asking about a coffee refill. On the other hand, the prices are ridiculously low given the quality of the food and the creativity of the presentation. This chef can easily open his own restaurant and charge twice what North Square charges. But I guess he loves his work there. Decor is OK. Definitely worth a visit. At the time this review is being written, the restaurant also offers a $42 prix fixe menu with choices for appetizer, entree, and dessert. The prix fixe menu choices included some of the chef's best dishes.",0,0,0,Bob G.,"JAMAICA, NY",17,213,400

The eggs did not taste particularly fresh and the smoked salmon and spinach were folded into the omelet afterwards. I prefer when the ingredients are actually inside the omelet. The fruit salad was also sub-par-- some of the grapes were squishy. I've been here for dinner a few times also. In general, the protein is cooked well.

The staff were incredibly kind in having no problem letting us sit for 30 minutes to wait for our friend AND use their outlet to charge our phones. After our friend arrived, however, the quality of service dwindled.  We sat for over 10 minutes before the waitress came to take our order and he had to ask twice for his wine. She did check back with us after our meal was served and was apologetic about her slip-ups. Now for the food! The calamari was breaded fresh in yummy cornmeal mix, all the pieces were tender and delicious. The wines were good. My friend and I ordered the seared scallops with quinoa, spinach, tomatoes and a delicious sweet lemon finishing drizzle. Beautiful presentation and the scallops were cooked perfectly and sweet, just delicious.  I had the warmed cookie plate for dessert and it was very good, just the right size of sweet. My friend had the apple rhubarb crisp and said it was perfect. The whole experience would have five stars without a question, except my scallops were gritty. Not terribly bad, but definitely hit some grit, and that's never pleasant, and the service was not the caliber you would expect from such a classy place with moderate prices. I'm not sure if the waitress was expected to have tables in the upper and lower parts of the restaurant and was always running back and forth (I hope not!), but that's kind of what it felt like.  I'm also very picky about giving 5 stars.

We came in just in time for happy hour (select wine and beers $5 and awesome small plates for $5-$7) but were moved to another table in the restaurant for dinner (keep this in mind). The atmosphere was very intimate and it was easy to have a conversation with one another. My bf ordered Char and it was delicious! It was like salmon's sexier sister. I unfortunately wasn't too hungry so I ordered a vegetable soup and a chopped salad. I felt like I could've made the soup at home but I was impressed with the salad. It had an array of very healthy finely chopped vegetables in the shape of a small tower. I also ordered a Sazerac, remembering that the last time I had one I hated it, but they made it right! Whoever is behind the bar knows what they are doing. I also want to make a shout out to Jordan (real name Yerden?), who was an amazing server and I will ask for her if I'm ever back in the area. Now the reason I didn't give this place 5 stars?1. The soup. It was just ok.2. We had a reservation at 7pm in the restaurant, but the S.O and I showed up a little early for our meeting.

Little did we know, we were suppose to be seated in the restaurant, but they crossed our name off the list and gave our table to someone else. When the rest of our party showed up, we were kind of stuck in limbo until they fixed that mistake. That being said, those were very minor things and it was one of my favorite dining experience I had on my last trip to NY.",1,0,0,Nicole L.,"Chapel Hill, NC",140,239,44

Not much to say, the food from the kitchen was great (hash browns, poached eggs) but the ancillary food was a bit stale. Servers seemed to be napping between serving sessions and it took forever to get the bill and get out. It's a cute, throwback room but a little cramped feeling.

Nothing gimmicky about this place--mostly traditional cocktails and a small wine list. The happy hour is long and the prices are reasonable. In a neighborhood full of bustling bars that appeal to the 20ish, hard-drinking crowd, this place is an oasis. There is no blaring TV, no loud music, no jostling crowds, no people screaming to be heard over the din. The patrons are mostly middle-aged and NYU-ish. The tables are cozy, and the bar is small and comfortable. It's perfect for a quiet, after-work conversation.",5,0,0,Tom S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",308,39,0

We thoroughly enjoyed the overall experience, but... the food just wasn't that great. It was good but under-seasoned across the board. We all had different dishes and we aren't really salt-lovers but we were all salting our food! Even the gravy for the turkey really was flavorless.The stuffing, risotto cakes and things like that were all overcooked and dry, but I'm just assuming that was because of the mass production of Thanksgiving. The deserts, however, were amazing. :)So I give this place 5 stars for atmosphere, service and overall vibe, while I give it only 3 stars for food.Maybe I'll give it another try someday.",0,0,0,K E.,"New York, NY",0,289,1

The band was good but the room isn't that big so they are basically strumming the standup base with an elbow in your hash browns. Back to the crowd, we seemed to be getting some looks from the Jazzists whenever we spoke a word.

5.0,2/20/2016,"With the advent of the food network, celebrity chefs and continually rising real estate prices in NYC the average diner has to suffer many indignities to enjoy a great meal or taste the latest trends - waiting on long lines, communal seating in cramped restaurants where tables are so close you are sharing a meal with strangers, rushed and less than friendly service, etc... Luckily North Square is a mainstay that DOES NOT subscribe to these latest trends.North Square has a privileged position at the NW corner of Washington Square Park within the basement of the Washington Square Hotel. You are greeted at the door by the host or hostess. The space is all wood tones and warm, muted colors - it feels like a 90s throw back, which is comforting. The cushioned seating and tables offer generous space. The clientele skewed decidedly older because with age comes wisdom.So many excellent choices on the menu, with prices I feel are extremely reasonable - they even offer a $40 prix fixe menu, all sides $5 and extensive, nicely priced wines. Although the delicious bread and olives are awesome, the Small Bite Trio is an excellent way to start with 2 each Tuna Tartare, piquillo pepper & olive tapenade baguette and duck confit roll - its a tasty sample of a few of the apps on the menu.We had an excellent Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc to go with our mains of Seared Sea Scallops and the Arctic Char. The scallops were seared to perfection served with quinoa and spinach. The Arctic Char (similar to Salmon, but a good sustainable seafood choice) was cooked medium rare with a crispy skin on a bed of basil risotto and truffle sauce - fantastic dish! A side of brussel sprouts to share were good, but not the best version I ever had. A shared decadent slice of Dulce de leche cheesecake finished off our meal.The service was wonderfully friendly and attentive throughout. The meal was perfectly paced were we never felt rushed or waiting for anything too long.Being near beautiful Washington Square Park and offering so many delicious items on the menu makes me wished I lived in the area because I would be a regular and it was nice to see many of the diners were.

I thought this place to me would be Arco Cafe to Gael Greene and The Simone to Pete Wells, but then I realized this place has been around for years and I was just never in the know. Oh well. I was expecting some stupidly lavish and snooty West-Village-hotel-restaurant, but the entrance was unassuming and the interior intimate and welcoming. I had the chopped salad as an appetizer. I enjoyed the quail eggs and appreciated the fact that the salad probably was my entire day's consumption of veggies, but there was very little dressing in the salad and to be honest the blend of vegetables was rather bizarre - jicama, carrot, celery, turnip, enoki mushrooms, the list goes on... Never thought I'd say this about a salad but it was just too much.My entree, the seared cod however was marvelous. The skin was thick but still crispy. The fish was a tad overcooked but I also like everything rare. The potato brandade on the side though. I could not get enough of it. That side alone will make me want to come back.Service was lovely.

5.0,11/10/2015,"I was invited by Executive Chef Yoel Cruz to his restaurant and I was floored at what he and his staff had put out, especially after touring the small kitchen.First off the front of the house was nice.  It was a rainy Wednesday night and we were seated at 5:30 - guests were trickling in and the restaurant was full by the time we left.  Anyhow here's the complete run down:Lobster & Crab Cakes - They were small, and understandably so as you wouldn't want to overcook lobster.  Good, but worth skipping as you couldn't taste much lobster and I'd just opt for a shrimp cake all together.Duck Confit Roll - This was what I was helping Chef Cruz with at the Food and Wine Festival (total winner).  Thought unfortunately the white beans were a touch undercooked.Tuna Tartar (Chef's suggestion) - Amazeballs.Wild Mushroom Ravioli (Chef's suggestion) - Double amazeballs.  I've never tasted such strong mushroom flavor in my life.Seared Cod - So delicious.  Fish cooked perfectly, always a fan of crispy skin.  And I could just eat a tub of that Potato Brandade.Atlantic Char - Also cooked so perfectly.  The basil risotto was also nice and light unlike most risottos which is typically drenched in butter.Pistachio Ice Cream over Chocolate brownie? - This was a special and it was simply lovely.  Chef hired a pastry consultant for this one and this was definitely worth the salt.  Love the Pistachios all over the dessert.Key Lime Pie (Chef's suggestion) - Ironically, this was heavier than the Chocolate Brownie.  Nice key lime flavor and perfect graham crust.If you never tried what ""seasonal"" food is, this is absolutely a place worth checking out.  This is where an older crowd goes so their palates are probably more refined than yours while knowing that what they're eating is good for them and gentle on their stomach.The prices are fair and though the two of us ate so much food, when I got home there wasn't a heavy feeling as a lot of the food is vegetable focused.  The menu is ever changing and if there's ever a special, I'd recommend trying it.  Chef knows best.",3,1,3,Albert W.,"Brooklyn, NY",201,970,560

I ordered the seared scallops and my boyfriend ordered the filet mignon. We wanted a small dinner because we weren't too hungry, so we only ordered entrees. Repeatedly, the waitress asked us if we would like any drinks. The only drinks the had were all alcoholic drinks so we declined. (Underage.) Everyone was very welcoming, but once our waitress took away our plates, she turned almost catty. We declined dessert, and she sounded extremely skeptical. We paid in cash, and the waitress came out and snarkily said ""keep the change"" as she literally tapped the check. Fortunately, my boyfriend and I thought this was funny. But, it still doesn't justify being rude to customers. We left her a tip she definitely did not deserve. If you're with your family or are people over the age of 25, your service will be fine.

5.0,7/21/2015,"My boyfriend & I had a marvelous meal here to celebrate our anniversary in July 2015. We had never been before & I walk past the restaurant every day on my way to class at NYU, so we figured we'd give it a try. Every aspect of the meal & the service was extremely enjoyable and pleasant. From the ""For the Table"" section of the menu, we ordered the polenta sticks and the crispy herb calamari. The serving of polenta was generous and the sticks were perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside & tender on the inside. The sundried tomato aioli dip that came with the polenta had a smoky, chipotle flavor to it. The calamari was lightly battered and was some of the most tender I've ever eaten. The grilled tomato sauce also had a smoky flavor and was light in its consistency & texture. From the appetizers section of the menu, we ordered the lobster & crab cakes. They were flavorful without being overpoweringly fishy and the thai curry coconut sauce had the appearance of a pesto sauce but with a fruity flavor from the coconut. The citrus fruits in the kale & treviso salad provided a nice contrast to the flavor of the kale. It was more of a chopped salad, which I prefer, with the kale sliced thin, the same way that iceberg lettuce might be shredded for a deli sandwich. My boyfriend had never had duck before & was excited to try it for the first time. He loved the spiced rubbed duck medallions (& so did I). They were tender & served in a brown chipotle peanut sauce with spring rolls on the side. I asked our server to surprise me with a recommendation & I was not disappointed when the grilled pork rib-eye arrived. It was quite possibly the most tender cut of any meat I've ever had & the grilled pineapple salsa with which it was served made for an excellent combination of flavors. The green beans were small, crispy, & garlicky, just right, and the corn was sliced from the cob. For dessert, we had decided on the strawberry shortcake, but our server must have overheard us debating whether or not to order the key lime pie and so he brought us the latter on the house! Both desserts were unbelievably light & flavorful. The shortcake was a sort of flatbread, sweet & almost biscuit-like. When our server brought our check, he told us that both desserts, our cappuccino, & our wine were on the house! In terms of bang for your buck, North Square gets an A+! For all of what we had, our check was under $120. I generally expect these subterranean, enclave-style restaurants on the bottom floors of NYC brownstones to be extremely expensive, but this place is the exception. The food isn't pretentious or overpriced and the menu is full of variety and options. As far as ambience is concerned, we were seated quite cozily in a little booth near a window. Entering on Waverly Place, immediately next door to the Washington Square Hotel's main entrance, there is a seating area that is purely restaurant (this is where we sat) & this connects to a larger area that has a bar & more seating.

5.0,12/22/2014,"Let me break this place down for you guys and let y'all know why this is one of my favorite brunch spots in the city.*Location, location, location. North Square is tucked away in the basement of the Washington Square Hotel, and is a few minutes walk from W 4th st. You're right next to Washington Square Park, so you're guaranteed a nice stroll for your post-brunch walk off. *Intimate, family style seating. Now this could be a good or bad thing, depending on who you are, but any set up that forces you to put down your phone and have an actual conversation is a plus for me. *Due to its relatively unsung reputation, you don't need to make a reservation months in advance or set up base camp to wait it out. I got here with another friend at around 1pm on Saturday, and we were brought in and seated immediately. Of course, we could have just gotten lucky, so don't blame me if you do end up having to wait.   *Decent food paired with good service. The complementary bread-muffin basket was a nice deviation from the usual selection of stale bread rolls. Our waters were constantly refilled, and we never once had to call our waiter over for anything. Their house coffee was strong and robust, but unmemorable as a whole. My friend and I split their Brunch Tasting ($13) and Challah French Toast ($11), and received our food within 20 minutes. The Brunch Tasting consisted of pumpkin pecan pancakes (amazingly sweet and fluffy), two eggs any style (go over easy or go home), cheddar biscuit (buttery and soft) and chicken & apple sausage (juicy and tender - my personal favorite). The generous portions of Challah french toast had a melt-in-your-mouth consistency, easily soaking up the delicious maple syrup. It also came with a side (you get to choose) of crispy, fat-laden bacon. With its prime location, lack of wait time, decent food and extremely fair prices, North Square has everything you love about brunch, only without the bad.",10,7,7,Peter Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",656,636,415

1.0,5/4/2014,"There are many things that have baffled me over the course of my relatively short life. When I was a couple months old, the idea of walking baffled me. It was a tough movement that I didn't quite grasp. When I was in elementary school, algebra baffled me. How could letters be numbers and what the heck is a reciprocal? In high school, dating baffled me. How am I supposed to ask out this girl and make her think I'm cool and yada yada yada. In college, the Higgs Boson baffled me. At 26 years of age, the 4 star yelp rating of North Square baffles me.It's hard to figure out where to start so we'll start from the food. I ordered an omelette with roasted potatoes. Initially, I was excited. The array of toppings or fill-ins I could have seemed endless and after 5 minutes of  planning, I was convinced I had perfected a perfect omelette to kick off the day. That is, until the waiter told me I could only have 2 of them. I glanced back at the menu to make sure I hadn't missed something and looked back at him with skepticism but decided to just let it go. There are worse things in life. My girlfriend ordered the Eggs Macdougal with cured salmon and spinach which sounded great, considering I was planning on stealing most of her food once I was done with my plate.We waited. And waited. And waited. Honestly, in the time it took us waiting, I could have raised my own chickens, waited for them to lay eggs, and cooked my own omelette but hey . . . there are worse things in life.The food came out and I almost laughed. Although, to be fair, I could probably understand now why the food took so long. Whoever cooked this must've screwed up at least ten or twelve times and then said to him/herself ""I'll just put some beaten eggs on top of bacon and onions and push some of the egg underneath"". But you know what? There are worse things in life. That worse thing would be the Eggs Macdougal. Let's start from the bottom up:1) English muffin: soggy, not toasted, cold (no doubt waiting for the omelette to be made)2) Spinach: Best part of the dish. Pretty bland but not as soggy and not as cold. Did it come from a bag? Probably.3) Salmon: Tasted old. Tasted bland. Tasted slimy. 4) Hollandaise: Not present. I'm no 4 star chef but for some reason, I thought this eggs macdougal dish was referencing eggs benedict which usually comes with Hollandaise sauce. Then again, the omelette was hard enough to make so maybe they're working their way up.My girlfriend took one bite, I took one bite, and we realized this dish was just not going to be eaten. We looked at each other and I put on a smile and said ""Hey, there are worse things in life"". We politely waited for someone to come around so we could ask them about the dish but funny thing, not one waiter or waitress came around us. I even saw one of them peak around the corner to look at us and when I made eye contact, she darted her head back. So we sat there . . . and sat there . . and all of a sudden, the waiter slid the check underneath my arm and before I had a chance to look over and say something, he was gone. We decided to just let it go. It was one brunch. One experience. There are definitely worse things in life. The waiter came over to collect the check and without a word, grabbed all the plates and walked off . . . I pulled out my phone to make sure we were in the right place, the 4 star North Square place. I scrolled through every photo to see if the decor matched, if the lighting matched, how was this possible? We walked out in a daze, not so much as a ""Thank you for dining with us"". Normally, I re-read my reviews to make sure I didn't say anything too egregious and didn't make any silly spelling or grammatical errors but this experience was too painful and traumatizing for me to read again . . . I'll take my chances. Of course, I'll take this into perspective. This was just one time, in one 50 minute span out of countless North Square dining experiences. And of course, there are many worse things in life. But as far as brunch experiences go, this was definitely the worst of the worst. Never in my life have I experienced a worse combination of food and service and as a paying customer, I can say with utmost certainty that I regret every penny I spent at this place, every watt of power I used on my phone to look this place up, and every molecule of ATP I used to walk there.",12,10,4,Alex S.,"New York, NY",404,103,107

I did come a bit on the early side to meet my friends, but they were fine with seating me while I waited. I don't recommend this place when the weather is nice. It's slightly underground and feels very dark and closed off, especially when you can just barely see the sunlight peeking in and makes for a slightly depressing vibe.Our brunch orders were fine, nothing special.

The place isnt too big so there isnt really an excuse for how slow our server was. To say she was slow is a real understatement.  I ordered over easy eggs and they came scrambled. When taking our order she messed it up three times. Couldn't find her to get our check for twenty minutes. Couldnt find her to cash out our check for another fifteen.

You're definitely paying for the ambience. The service is very slow here, but not one of the customers seemed to mind. They definitely aren't pushing you out the door.One thing that really bothered me is that we ordered a side to go with our meal, and after our waiter convinced us how good they were and heckled us into ordering another one, they didn't show up until more than halfway through our meal. We basically didn't want them by then. We had to remind them. Seemed like they just forgot to make them altogether, which is odd considering how big a deal they seemed to be to the waiter.

4.0,2/3/2014,"I live nearby, and so I go fairly often.  It is a good, reliable place to have a reasonably priced dinner in the Village.  My favorite aspect of the menu is the a la carte option, where you can choose a main and a side, rather than have the menu preparation.  At most places you would get the main dish and pay extra for the sides on top of the baseline price, but here they give you the protein at a discounted price, so when you add sides the price remains about the same.  For a place one goes to regularly, this helps avoid the boredom of seeing the same menu items all the time.  They also have a fixed-price menu of special items, and those can be ordered a la carte as well.  Sometimes the service has not been all that great (hard to get the waiter's attention, especially if you are served dinner in the bar and not the dining room)--but it is usually pretty easy to get a table day of.  A nice neighborhood restaurant.",0,0,0,David J.,"Jackson Heights, NY",0,84,17
4.0,1/26/2014,"Cute, upscale diner-like atmosphere. Seems to be attached to a hotel and seems to use the restaurant amenities from the hotel (kitchen, coat check, etc) which probably explains the slow(er) service. For example, after our food came out, we asked for syrup. I thought maybe the waitress had gone to Vermont to tap some fresh from a tree, but really she probably just had to go back into the hotel kitchen to get it.The brunch menu is really nice, and I love how they include a  brunch tasting option which gives you a little bit of everything. The prices seem kind of strange, as most brunch items run between $11-13 and then others are over $20. The juice and coffee is also pretty pricey in comparison to the entrees.The brunch comes with a big basket of sweet and savory breads. I couldn't help myself and nearly got full tasting the different breads.I got the french toast and it was a pretty hefty serving: 3-4 slices of challah French toast, and one pretty large link of chicken apple sausage. There was also some sliced banana on the plate, which I thought was a cute touch. While the french toast was delicious and just the right amount of crispy around the edges, it was raw and oozing on the inside. I would have sent it back but I was in a little bit of a rush, and honestly wasn't that hungry anyway, so I ate around the outsides until I was full.Overall the service was pretty slow even though there weren't many people  in there.",2,2,0,Liz B.,"NY, NY",130,588,129

The same goes with the salads, priced at about $14-$16, they were pretty small for a salad, not outrageous, just not generous.

5.0,12/25/2013,"Ok it's really 4.5 but four wasn't fair either so went to 5. We were there for a dinner with my aunt and uncle December 21 to celebrate Christmas and their hosting us often. We first went to the bar since we were early and Nick served me a N. Cocktail. Nice with cava. He said I would like it and I did. Then when we were seated they offered me a banquet table but it was right next to the serving station and walkway. I asked to be moved and they did so right away with no problem. In the corner table next to the window. It was nice. We had two bottles of Cabernet with us and a Sauternes. We all ordered an appetizer entree and dessert. My tuna tartar was wonderful my aunt liked it too my uncle risotto was nice. And my hubby had lobster and crab caked. A little too small but yummy. I ordered the rack of lamb and the piece was TOO fatty. They could have trimmed it better but the flavor was good my husbands had filet and it was stellar. My aunt and uncle enjoyed their scallops and duck. For dessert chocolate cake with bitter chocolate ice cream for me. Delicious. My uncle had the cheese plate which he enjoyed. My aunt the pistachio crime brûlée. With only $15 per bottle corkage we were very lucky to be able to share 1987 bringer and 1990 silverado. The wine rocked and byob in manhattan at these prices was so reasonable. Now the waiter, we had Gabriel. He was gracious, professional and did a wonderful job with service. I would ask for him again. The room is small, it can get loud but it has nice food, byob for next to nothing, wonderful wait staff. We had a puppet outside our window dancing. How is that for holiday magic. Go, eat and ENJOY!!

The food was really good - the lamb is cooked beautifully and despite being cooked to a medium well, it was still very moist and tender. The Atlantic char was very fresh and cooked to my desired liking. The basil risotto was my favorite - I would literally eat a whole bowl of it and call it a night. The lobster & crab cake appetizer was a bit on the small side but still delicious. The main reason why they're not a full 5 star is because of the service. After dropping off menus, our waitress kind of disappeared. We tried to flag her down and she told us she'll be back in a minute - but we saw her service 3 other tables instead.

But I ended up ordering the blueberry buttermilk pancakes with chicken sausage and it was tasty. The prices were also very reasonable. If you order the $20 pre fixe, it comes with coffee or juice but the entrée options are quite limited.  I think there were three or four entrees you are allowed to choose from versus 20 other variety of plates that are not part of the pre-fixe. The muffins that came in the bread basket were also surprisingly good in my opinion. They were moist and fluffy. Overall, the seating is fairly comfortable and noise level was just right to have a normal conversation.  I think the only confusing part was the entrance because it seems like they have three different entrance doorways.",1,0,0,Rowena Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",480,1179,549
5.0,9/15/2013,"Summary: North Square is amazing- Great bargain for a delicious Sunday brunch- Cozy atmosphere- Laid-back but attentive staff- An especially good bread basketFood and drink: I had one of their specials---an omelette with mesclun salad, home fries and a blueberry scone---and a china green tea. The omelette was filled with broccoli rabe and tomatoes and mushrooms (the default is gruyere, but I substituted mushrooms for the gruyere, and had no difficulties doing so). The ingredients were fresh. The tea came in a fancy teapot. Total came to $20 (incl. tax and tip).Service: Impeccable. We were seated immediately upon arrival in one of the few empty tables.

I calculated what my meal would have been normally in the restaurant and it was $10 more for the private setting. It's not too bad.  We also had a cake made for the occasion - so I guess the $10 wasn't fully for the room.  Appetizer: LOBSTER and CRAB CAKES  seaweed and vegetable salad, thai curry coconut sauce The salad was delicious. It was like Asian styled pickled cucumber. The seaweed was a pleasantly surprising touch.  There were two crab/lobster cakes which were good but I love crab cakes w/o fillers and these had some, but still had quite a good amount of crab/lobster meat. Entree: CORIANDER CRUSTED YELLOWFIN TUNA  coconut & jasmine rice, carrots, shiitake mushrooms, wakame seaweed, citrus spiked soy sauce The server recommended this over the duck so I had went with his suggestion. It was delicious. Sliced thin and I had it cooked rare, it was like marinated sashimi. The spiked soy sauce was light and had a slight kick (or maybe it was the coriander on the tuna) but overall it was a very light but palate pleasing dish. The shiitake slices were yummy. The downfall of the dish was the coconut rice. It was a bit undercooked but flavor was complementary to the soy sauce. Dessert: CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE bitter chocolate ice cream, chocolate and caramel sauce, chopped heath barThis was way too much heavy for me in the end of the meal as the portions were quite large. Should have went with the ice cream. Friend had some pretty unique flavor sorbets. It was delicious though.. the chocolate was not too sweet and the cake in the center was moist.

Definitely a hidden gem, only heard of it cuz of googling ""free bread basket in nyc brunch restaurants"". Not very noticeable especially for its location. My bff and I both went to NYU for undergrad and we never even noticed this place existed right on our campus! Initially they reserved a table right by the entrance where the there was direct sunlight (I could barely open my eyes), I asked if we could be moved and they happily set another table for us in the back.The place is extremely cozy and we noticed mostly locals dining here (kids in the 20s or 30s dining with their parents or just older couples). Bff ordered the brunch tasting and I ordered the crab cake. We were tempted by the brunch specials (with a drink for $20) but unfortunately we both had to head to the library after our date so we just set our tummy on the food. After we placed our order, we were given a yummy bread basket with assorted baked goods. The only downside to it is that it wasn't served warm! It had little raspberry muffins which i asked twice for refills. I think there was some kind of biscuits too but nothing too crazy memorable. The crab cake entree came in a big portion (3 crab cakes? served with a small side salad)! I gave one of my cakes to my bff and she shared some of brunch tasting ( pecan pumpkin pancake + poached egg) with me. The pancake was light and fluffy and I regret not ordering just that.

The food is delicious, albeit a little expensive & they make great drinks. In addition to the fine fare, the main reason for going has always been the incredible staff.HOWEVER, over the past year management has chased out or let go nearly every bartender & manager who made it worth the prices: Angela, Ryan, Veronica & Charles always made us feel at home. Without them, the place is sorely lacking in service, hospitality & warmth. I am very disheartened by these changes and at a loss to see why you'd fire so many good people who make the place appealing. We will no longer be spending our money there or recommending it. These changes are not improvements ~ they're decimating the place.

4.0,10/20/2012,"Brunch, for around $11 + cost of mimosas.  Awesome.Caution: you might want to bring a bib to catch the inevitable drool that escapes the corners of your mouth.  First of all, the blood orange mimosa was the best mimosa I've had at any brunch thus far - quality OJ, perfectly balanced with enough champagne.  Now, I generally don't expect the free appetizer bread to be of any noticeable quality at lower priced establishments such as this, but the (cranberry?) bread was definitely a most pleasant surprise.  Soft middle with a mellow, blended berry-dough harmony, complimented by firm crust.  (Yes the bread was that noteworthy to warrant two entire sentences.)For a bank-breaking $11, the salmon and spinach Eggs Benedict proved to be a superb choice.  Not only were the eggs poached to perfection, topped with some savory-sweet and rich, yet medium bodied sauce, well suited to flatter the egg/salmon/spinach/muffin fusion, but the dish also came with wonderfully spiced red potatoes and a light dessert pastry(thick triangular thing that tasted like shortbread) to tie together the ambrosial experience.The only slight shortcomings that cost 1 star in my book are 1) the service - while it isn't poor by any means, it just took a little bit longer to be served our food order than I think it should have, given that the place was at maybe half capacity.  Otherwise, the servers are attentive and friendly; and 2) the interior subtly exuded an uncanny suggestion of hotel breakfast room (which is understandable since it turns out to actually be part of a hotel), albeit most quaint hotel breakfast room I've ever been in.  Nevertheless, the comfortable and subdued feel inside allows you to relax and enjoy the wonderful meal before you.When you're done, you can step across the street into the park and enjoy the sunshine and free entertainment while you digest.  Or play chess... whatever tickles your fancy.",0,0,1,Evan J.,"New York, NY",207,86,85

3.0,6/24/2012,"I came with a friend for dinner, midweek, and was sadly underwhelmed. North Square was on my bookmarked list because of the great reviews and nice pictures on yelp. However, although neatly tucked into the corner of Washington Square Park it wasn't an exciting experience. North Square is a fairly small restaurant, and I don't seem to remember there being a bar to sit at. I had made a reservation, and we were sat immediately upon arrival. The host was nice and the servers accommodating. There was no music playing which was disappointing because it often gives a restaurant a nice vibe. However, it seems like it would be a great place for a business lunch. The menu had a nice variety of options, but we decided to jump into entrees. I had the pan roasted chicken, and my friend the pork. I can't speak for the pork, but the chicken was juicy and tender! We also shared the cauliflower mash which was superb. I would definitely love to have that recipe. Overall the food was excellent, but the lack of ambience wouldn't bring me back  for more; we didn't bother to stick around for after dinner drinks and desserts (the Jazz Brunches sound quite interesting though).",1,0,1,Jennifer R.,"New York, NY",10,64,0

Drool).  Some got salads, which were very good.  The Bloody Mary was a bit seafood-y tasting for me, but my parents loved it.  We ate as we watched a great jazz performance from famed guitarist Gene Bertoncini, along with a lovely vocalist and talented bassist.  The venue was wonderful: intimate yet spacious, and a great place to enjoy quality food and music.Just cross the street afterwards and you're in Washington Square Park.The vibe here is old-school but updated, and not a pinch of trying too hard but just getting everything right.  I'll be back.",1,0,1,Allison C.,"Brooklyn, NY",30,61,12

3.0,2/4/2012,"This goes into my hide and seek refers primarily to the bar area.  North Square is a basement restaurant with a bar all the way in the far far back. It's hidden below the Washington Square hotel and is - to me - a bit rustic - old school NYU.  This hotel is a great place to meet for a conversation or group, particularly after the dinner rush as there would be no way to find specifically the bar unless you were meeting there AND there is actually ample space for a larger party.  While it is technically a bar, there is plenty of selection of tea.  As a result, it's going on my On the Wagon list.  As for food, it's ok.  Not great, not bad.  My friend had a couple of appetizers which was more than enough for dinner. It also came with a nice bowl of olives.  My friend and I had the hot chocolate, which was more like a chocolate sauce. It came with home made marshmallows, which were pretty good. Too thick and chocolate-y for me to drink, next time I would simply pour it on the marshmallows and call it a day.For dinner, this is more of a place that an NYU student would take a parent who wanted something slightly serious. I can't see myself going here for a date or a night out with the girls.  But again... this rating is for the bar, which absolutely the perfect spot if you have 2-10 people and need to meet up and organize something either business or non-profit related.  There are plenty of food and beverage options. The service is good, won't hassle you for just hanging out, and will disappear and reappear when needed.  Will have to come back for this Jazz Brunch.",3,0,0,May L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",617,466,229

4.0,8/8/2011,"Went here for Brunch because it was the only place that was big enough for 6 people AND takes reservations. I knew Jane would be WAY too crowded, plus I wanted to try some place new. North Square has been on my bookmark list for a while, strictly because of the brunch menu prices. They were such a great deal and the location was nice. I don't like going to the West Village much, just because I live on the UES. But, I made the trip and I didn't regret it. The place is connected to the Washington Sq hotel, I believe. They have a separate room for live Jazz during brunch, I was not seated there. But, it was a decent size and was a bit busy. It wasn't completely empty.The waitress was nice, but VERY SLOW. It took us a while to get menus. And probably more than 30 minutes to get  our food. We weren't really complaining because we were chatting with each other. The Bread Basket was enough for us to munch it. It was very delicious, just like most of the reviews said. It had sourdough, cranberry, raisin bread, corn bread... So yummy! I love a good array of breads in a basket. Well, I love cards in general... Anyway, although service was slow and we had to constantly flag down the waitress, it was a nice restaurant to have brunch. We all order different things. They have a menu for regular brunch items, then lunch items, then brunch specials. Dishes ranged from $9-$25. I loved they had something for everyone. If you wanted seafood, they offered scallops. If you wanted steak, they had steak and eggs ($17) and if you wanted something fancy like lamb, they had it as a brunch special. They also had special omelets as well as regular ones. I got the sirloin burger with fries ($10). It was a bit dry, but the caramelized onions made it delicious. Maybe I should have ordered medium rare instead of medium. I would have preferred it to be more pink and juicy. My other friends got salads, omelets, steak quesadillas, and steak and eggs. They all seemed to enjoy their food very much. All in all, the food and ambiance makes up for the slow service. Brunch is somewhat meant to be slow and enjoyable anyhow. I liked the food for the prices I paid, plus being able to make reservations tops it off! The restaurant is located right at the corner of Waverly and West Washington Sq Park.

Somehow we found room to order 2 desserts to share.  The first was the chocolate peanut butter dome. It was great.  Very rich but great.  The second was the butterscotch banana bread pudding.  Simply amazing.  It actually made me crave bread pudding later that week, which I never do.  Simply awesome.  If i had to find one downfall is that it took a little while to find our waitress to get the check, but we were enjoying the meal so much that we really didn't care.I would go back to this place in a heart beat.  Enjoy.",0,0,0,Deborah S.,"Jersey City, NJ",29,26,0

Kelly ordered from the RW menu and I opted a la carte. Kelly ordered the corn and salmon appetizer, short ribs, and the banana cake. I ordered the lobster rissotto (at the recommendation of the server), the lamb rack, and the pumpkin creme brulee. The plating is gorgeous and the service is leisurely. That said, the finer details of the food were hit or miss. The lobster in the rissotto was overcooked and dry - a chorizo would have been a better complement to the corn in the rice. The short ribs were drier than others I've had recently and there was an abundance of sauce on both entree plates. The rack of lamb was a generous serving and cooked perfectly to medium rare - but it doesn't wow. The pumpkin creme brulee had a great custard, but a lackluster sugar crust. Kelly noted that the bananas were the best part of her dessert - not the cake.I wouldn't mind going back - its a pretty solid 3.5 stars. But its hardly something I'd go out of the way for.",3,1,1,Suanne L.,"Brooklyn, NY",198,982,842

It is super convenient to the W. 4th stop which is a big plus in my book and the service and food were spot on. The best part of the meal was the dessert - every single selection on the Restaurant Week menu was fannnntastic. It consisted of donuts, chocolate cake, and key lime pie. I am not doing the description justice but trust me, they were delicious. I've heard their brunch was pretty amazing too so I am going to put this on my list!",0,0,0,Kimberly G.,"Hoboken, NJ",8,67,0
4.0,2/2/2011,"I go to the North Square for brunch quite often. It is my favorite spot on Sunday morning. Wonderful jazz brunch with sets at 12:30 and 2pm. Quite often the wonderful singer Roz Corral is there there is nothing finer then spending the afternoon eating, drinking and listening to her. My favorite is the brunch tasting as the pancakes and chicken sausage are really good. The omelet's are not the greatest. I also find the hollandaise sauce VERY salty so you might want that on the side if you order some kind of benedict. .Staff is ultra friendly but can be a little streched thin due to the volume of patrons",4,0,0,Ari S.,"Forest Hills, NY",807,33,0
3.0,1/15/2011,"Located in the Washington Square Hotel where my Aunt and cousin were staying. It's a lounge although they call it a cafe. The lounge is located one floor below. Had some drinks and chilled with a group of 8 people. Nice place for drinks, but we were a little rowdy. It's more of a romantic date spot. The ""lounge"" is dimly lit and decorated with vintage pictures of Marilyn Monroe. I didn't order food, but my Aunt ordered a plate of cookies which were served with basil on top, a little weird. Complimentary olive bowls were weak as well marinated in what I believe was anchovies. Bathroom situation was odd too. Restroom is located in the lobby and you have to ask a security guard for a key to use it. I really think the strangest thing about this place is that they have last call at 9PM. I thought they were trying to get rid of us at first to only notice the whole area cleared out. It's more like a 2.5 rounded up to a 3, but it served the purpose for continuing to get drunk.

The decor inside is a little tacky and could really use a re-doing (thus why a number of Yelpers have said that this is a place to take your grandmother...half of the people in there were over 60).The service here needs to be shaped up a tad. We sat for about 20 minutes without bread or drinks (other than water), and I was surprised at how loud the servers chatted with each other. No, the prices aren't insanely high (~$16/plate for lunch), but still...it's not a Denny's! Nonetheless, I really loved the bread, especially this amazing cranberry walnutty slice they include ... mmm...I ordered the steak salad -- simply delicious. It came with just enough steak, cooked perfectly medium rare. The veggies all tasted very fresh, with the exception of the corn (which could have been canned).

4.0,7/27/2010,"Nestled inside the Washington Hotel in the West Village is a gem of a restaurant called North Square.  The way the entrance divides the restaurant between the lounge and the main dining area makes this place feel hidden and therefore private.  It is a nice, cozy little restaurant that can accommodate a big group for a special event.The lounge is spacious, but very intimate with a small bar in the front for patrons who just want to enjoy a drink.  7 of us sat comfortably in a corner table.  North Square serves creative American Food.  For example, the Artic Char I ordered came pan seared perfectly over a basil risotto and roasted tomatoes.  The lamb chops came prepared to the temperature of your choice with a layered potato cake that melted in your mouth as if it was mashed.  The filet mignon was a nice size and very lean, served with a grilled onion and thick steak fries that were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The scallops dish came with 5 scallops, which were sauteed to perfection, a beautiful golden brown on the outside, soft and juicy on when you bit into it, with a quinoa centerpiece.I also highly recommend the lobster and crab cakes - the sauce that they came floating in really brought out the sweetness of the lobster and crab, and the asian inspired salad tasted so good you forgot it was garnish.  The lobster risotto came with nice big meaty chunks of lobster.For dessert, I'd definitely order their sorbets.  Not only were they refreshing, but the magarita, pineapple, and lime-cilantro ( my personal favorite ) were also great as palate cleansers.  You also cannot go wrong with the brownie sundae or the creme brulee with fruit baked in.A really great place.  I'd definitely come back again.",1,0,0,Vicky L.,"Jersey City, NJ",813,975,510

I can't think of much.Although their $20 prix fixed menu sounded inviting, the limited entree options had us springing for the a la carte items on the menu.  When each dish is only $8-$15, (and honestly, when we're still recovering from excessive drinking from the night before...) you can't really go wrong with opting for the greater selection at a pretty equivalent value.  Thumbs up on the steak salad.  While my plate of crab benedict was enjoyable, I've experienced better with the crab omelet at Tunnicliff's in DC.And the music was absolute enjoyment.  Who doesn't love some mellow jazz sung by a rich, throaty voice, and backed by some simple guitar and bass?  We even lucked out with a guest vocalist this afternoon, who reminded me a lot of Sara Bareilles.  J'adore.Score some easy reservations on OpenTable, then call in to ask for seating in their lounge space for their Sunday jazz brunch.  There are two sets, so for those of you who get a super late start to your last day of weekend freedom, roll in at 1400 and make an afternoon of it.",9,0,10,Kevin L.,"New York, NY",1049,1344,4648

4.0,10/7/2009,"The evening had started of jauntily enough--after a day of hanging out with book artists, zine-writers, and assorted hipoisie, after cocktails with a dear friend at the Campbell Apartment in Grand Central Station, and a long, long, looooooong walk from there to Washington Square.  I'd discouraged S from having a post-drinks, pre-dinner energy drink, fearing he'd ruin his appetite (yeah, like that happens with 6'2"" guys).""No really!  Have a delicious and nutritious banana instead! Nature's energy snack-let in a cute lil'yellow jacket!"" I said, bossily.  I mean, the guy is thin, so I'm not sure why I was stopping him from eating anything, but let's chalk it up to Manhattan-induced foodie fervor. And now it was past 9, and all of our top-choice restaurants were packed, with no room at the bar (so much for the recession).  We hadn't planned very well, and I could see from the corner of my bleary eyes that S was eyeing me with what can charitably be described as sheer and utter dislike.Finally, my invaluable personal assistant Priscilla Peabody (aka my iPhone, who is nicely filled up with foodie apps) suggested we give North Square a try.  At this point we didn't even care if it got good reviews: it was two blocks away and we were just going to muscle our way in, if it meant sitting on someone's lap (""Shut up! Double decker seating is the new bed table!"").Unbelievably, the fine folks at North Square didn't blink an eye when we walked in.  Instead, we were seated at a cozy little  table by the large plate glass window, three steps below street level (so New York!).  The small but not claustrophobic dining room was amber lit, the music was soft jazz, and the patrons were chill and unpretentious.  We sank into our comfortable seats with a sigh of relief, and proceeded to have one of the most excellent meals of our trip.Let me start off with my one, teeny complaint about this place: they engaged in the waiter waltz from hell.  Meaning: we were seated by one guy, welcomed by another, asked about wine by another, and then again by another, and then again by...another.  All in all, we had a rotating cadre of 5 different servers (including the water guy, who as usual was the most sweet, polite, and attentive of all). At this point we were so hungry we really didn't care, but it did make for some confusing moments, and a ""wait, doesn't our waiter like us? do we smell funny?"" kind of anxiety.My favorite thing about North Square was the surprisingly excellent wine by the glass list.  You all know the drill: if you're not willing to consume a whole bottle, you're often stuck with generic and sub-par wines.  Instead, S and I had two of the finest, most juicy-fresh-smoky-tasty glasses of wine we'd ever tried by the glass, and ended up having another, thus ending up paying as much as we would have for a cheaper bottle. C'est la friggin' vie, I guess. In any case, at least I wasn't hung over the next day.We also unashamedly ordered the same thing. I mean, get over it. we're best friends, why wouldn't we like the same thing?  Yeah, this way there's less sampling, but there's also less propensity to envy/hate your companion for their superior taste and discernment.  So we both had the absolutely fantastic chopped salad (so beautiful, like a little timbale made of colorful confetti. It was shaped, with some squiggly squigs of gingery vinaigrette on the side, and vibrant with the taste of beets, jicama, roasted onions, and various other chopped veggies, and topped with some very fresh and perky enoki mushrooms.The arctic char (I love how those two words sound together) with truffle oil on a bed of pesto risotto was just...hmmmmmm.  Happy humming sound.  Our usual loquacity was brought short, and for a while we just savored.  Until we couldn't resist commenting on the sharply dressed senior lady with the purple hair. Dessert kind of made us maudlin...a dark chocolate dome with a raspberry filling and...oh, this is when I do believe there's a higher power--pistachio brittle.  Pistachio.  Made into a brittle.  God, they're clever in NYC.We sat for a while, until we were handed the bill by yet another waiter.  Which was fine, until a young lady came around and asked if we'd like our bill.  But WHO CARES?  We were ready to head back into the balmy night, sit by the fountain in Washington Square, listen to music, and then wander off to yet another bar.  We were best friends again, and all banana-related warfare was a thing of the past.",3,4,2,Valentina D.,"Miami, FL",222,251,0

The service is professional and courteous. I am really bothered by the decor, which obviously has not been changed since the 1990's. The ceiling is carpeted (!), and the walls are covered with weird-looking sconces. By far the worst feature of the place is the paintings. There is one of a deformed woman with 80's hair in an evening gown that makes me sick to my stomach. And then there are the painted tiles. All in all, though, if you can snag a seat not facing the paintings or else learn to eat with your eyes shut, it's a great place.",0,0,0,Tampa D.,"New York, NY",3,213,1
5.0,8/6/2009,"This is a hidden Gem in the West Village.  I have yet to eat in the restaurant, I always head towards the lounge.  It almost has a speak easy feel if you use the side entrance.   It is the perfect place for a late afternoon early evening business meeting, as it tends to be quiet and yet not stuffy.  The tap beer selection is great, and so are the appetizers",0,0,0,Blair J.,"Baltimore, MD",0,19,0
2.0,8/5/2009,"This place has such potential.  The initial ambiance is cute and cozy, until you take a harder look and realize the fabrics and decor is fairly outdated and could use a some revamping.    The food was just ok.  Nothing impressive whatsoever.  The presentation was nice.  Three out of four of us the pre fixe menu, which was a good selection of the menu.  I had a potato leek soup with bacon and crispy onions... and it was just okay.  I also had the Long island duck breast, with wild rice and pepper timbale, kumquat and cherry compote, brown shallot au jus - which was just okay.  The rice was undercooked and over done with peppers and the duck was just... eh.  For dessert I had a blueberry turnover with a raspberry lemon sauce... and it was just okay.  To be honest, even my other guest's meals were pretty forgettable.  I will say though that the wine list was nice and surprisingly affordable.  The service, although nice, was sooooo incredibly slow.  We were there for 3 hours, and not by choice.  Often we had empty plates sitting in front of us for far too long and we were there over 20 minutes before they brought bread and such to the table.  I enjoy a leisurely meal, but this was a bit too slow paced in my opinion.    All in all, I won't be back or recommend this place.  I certainly hope someone buys it and revamps it... like I said, it has good bones but needs some serious overhauling.",1,0,0,Nicole S.,"Suches, GA",140,141,23

We both really enjoyed the food, but we were half the age of everyone else in the restaurant. Also, in addition to feeling young most of the people were speaking foreign languages around us.

3.0,3/1/2009,"Like Jane C. said, this place is totally random, particularly for a ""fine dining"" place. Decor is definitely cruise ship. Fellow diners: also like they came off a cruise ship (the early dinner shift--average age: 65). Service: kind of resemble cruise ship performers who hit a dead end and became waiters (highlight of this was our first server vanishing halfway through the entree, and not coming back until the bill--a disgruntled woman who appeared from nowhere attempted to handle dessert, but it was just...awkward). However...food? Definitely a few notches above cruise ship. The BBQ braised short ribs ($20)  are delicious (not very BBQ, which I liked), but the sour cream and horseradish potatoes that came with weren't so much (there were also these strange potato chips...). Pan seared sea scallops were tender ($22), and came with this really delicious polenta.Dessert was a bit of a fail--the lime and coconut flan sounded promising ($7, ""pineapple, shaved coconut, rum"") but was super-hard (think cheddar cheese firmness). Ick.Tip: They have a Restaurant Week menu but you'll only save ~$3 from the a la carte menu. So really, go any time if you want some tasty food and don't mind the quirky venue.",3,2,2,Serena C.,"New York, NY",37,160,13

2.0,9/18/2008,here's the deal....this place is good for a few things and a few things only.1. if you are having an affair. no one is going to see you here.2. if you want to anonymously drink at a bar none of your friends go to.3. if you dont care about service and can deal with some hipster freak giving you attitude about liking celine dion.4. if you want to be in a basement that resembles a hampton inn and also have to deal with kitchen staff going in and out of the service door.stiff pours though so in my book that gets you at least one star.  and if i ever want to drink alone i'll go back here - hence the 2 star rating.,3,2,2,Brooke M.,"Minneapolis, MN",183,469,0
5.0,8/4/2008,"Sometimes, I'm the food/culture maven...othertimes I defer to the recs of others. My visit to North Square Lounge falls into one the latter.North Square is one of those places I wish I had known about for years. It just has a nice mellow vibe that's also rather convivial. It's a small space, but not too small to be cozy...it gives the impression of being the right size without people having to whisper or yell...and that's quite a feat in Manhattan.My good friend and I wanted some light nosh and heavy drinks. We received both...the heavy drinks in the form of two rounds...the last of which made me wonder if I had left my liver with the check.The food: lightly fried calamari (rings and full-on squids) and chips and guacamole. Both were perfect for sharing. If you're not a fan of fish doughnuts, they also offer other small dishes. You can also order from the restaurant and eat in the lounge.The drinks: She had gin martinis that were served in a very deep martini glass, but not the wide ones that spill the liquor as soon as you breathe reaching for the glass. I had a Diablo...tequila, lime, ginger beer....I termed it ""Ginger Hell."" I'm clearly paving my road with good intentions, because as mentioned before I, like Dicken's Oliver, was asking for more.My appetite has been whetted as well by other people's reviews.

5.0,2/20/2008,"My favorite restaurant in NYC...Let me tell you a few stories:On my first visit we were there to just ""do a day"" in the city.  I ordered the crab cake appetizer.  WHOA!  Dynamite presentation AND taste.  The portion was perfect without being pathetically small OR disastrously large.  If any of you know me, then it will come as no surprise that I had a grey goose martini with my appetizer.  However, by the time my entree came (a WONDERFUL sea bass), I had not been asked about a new beverage.  WELL, upon his return to our table, the waiter asked ""how is everything"" (as waiters have a tendency to do).  To my dining partner's chagrin, I replied with a sarcastic, ""Well, the food is wonderful, but I am still in need of a glass of chardonnay"".  At that point, the waiter took off running through the narrow aisles of the restaurant, narrowly missing other diners and wait staff.  Within 30 seconds, a glass of wine returned to our table.  The waiter smiled, set the glass down and said, ""I hope you'll find this acceptable.""After that, there followed NUMEROUS positive experiences with the food, staff and location of North Square.  I highly suggest that you finish your meal with a pistachio creme brulee.  Even if you aren't a ""dessert person"", I guarantee that this dish will please your palate and leave you wanting more!",3,1,1,Adam S.,"Yonkers, NY",4,20,0

I had the rucola salad, which was delicious, although I realized after I had started that they had served it made with baby spinach insetad of rucola, but fine because I love both and it was delish: then I had the lamb rack, which came with chive masheds potatoes and veggies. It looked gorgeous and was delicious. My husband had the chopped salad appetizer and the filet, which came with onion rings and veggies. He was also very happy with it. We were too full to order dessert but we had coffee and it was the best coffee we've had since moving here from Europe!! We ended up spending 125 (plus tip), which is very reasonable.I really liked the atmosphere, nice but not uncomfortably stiff, everybody was very polite but also friendly, I like that. I also liked that it was very intimate, especially because the bar and larger room were closed to the public because of a private party.

5.0,5/31/2007,"This is our favorite restaurant in NYC.  I wasn't even going to Yelp about it, and I have been Yelping about nonstop since I discovered the site two weeks ago.  We really want to keep it under the radar and our little secret, because it IS so amazing, and it is also possible to get a table when you want one for the most part.  The only reason I am is to defend it from Alexa's complete misunderstanding of the decor and her comment about people from out of town.Now, not to be a snob, but the murals on the walls are inspired by top tier famous artists such as Klimt, and they are executed impeccably.  When we took friends from out of town (Vancouver) to North Square, (as Alexa cautions you not to do), our female guest was astounded at their beauty and the technical skill used in executing them.  Since she was in town in the first place to speak on her body of work as a female artist specializing in female-centric art at NYU's Art and Artists conference in February, and is an accomplished artist, we felt her opinion had merit.  As far as the rest of the decor--if a Wal-Mart looked like North Square, I'd move into one.  Warm woods, elegant banquettes with sophisticated upholstery, perfectly understated lighting, elegant floral design and down to the silverware, lovely table settings, and a bathroom most of us would kill for...nothing Wal-Mart about it.  North Square is a chic, tasteful restaurant owned by a Vassar graduate who probably never walked into a Wal-mart in her life.  I am all for differences of opinion, but when my sophisticated friends who have wine collections come to town, we take them to North Square too.  Babbo is a great restaurant, but who cares?  Don't your friends from out of town want to have a great meal?  Take them to North Square.  From the bread basket (Sullivan Street bakery!!) to the olives (Zabar's!) to the wine service, to the remarkable value for the money they consistently serve, to the way all the available staff help the entire party into their coats at the end of the meal, the place is impeccable.  There are very few restaurants in NYC equal to it for overall experience.",7,0,4,Jessica F.,"New York, NY",87,252,49

If you want to impress friends from out of town, go across the street to Babbo.Ex post facto note in response to Jessica: I love that you argue that b/c North Hill's owner is a Vassar Grad that she has probably never set foot in a Wal-mart!!?? I also love that you try to show my lack of art education by quoting your Canadian art-expert friend on the ""execution of the decor"". (BTW- I've seen a lot of great copies executed at Wal-mart).
