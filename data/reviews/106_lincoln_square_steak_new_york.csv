2.0,4/20/2019,"This was our last dinner in NYC for the quintessential steak experience,  unfortunately  the tomahawk rib eye, filet mignon  and prime rib were all very chewy and rubbery and lacked any deep beef flavor. I should have known better when the place was dead at 9:30 PM on a Saturday night compared to the Luxembourg next door which was packed to the gills, obviously the locals know best. The service was very good otherwise.",1,0,0,D F.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,4,0
5.0,4/14/2019,My new favorite steakhouse. We went there for dinner at 9 pm on a weeknight. Steakhouse decor is interesting. (It not the typical dark wood.)The waitstaff was great. The only thing I didn't like was that they turned the lights up all the way. We ordered cocktails which were ok but the food was delicious. My bf ordered the filet mignon and purée potatoes. He ate all of it by himself. I ordered the NY strip and roasted cauliflower. I ate half of both (because I wanted to save room for dessert.) I ate the rest for lunch the next day and it was even better! We both enjoyed our desserts - Homemade Twix ice cream and banana ice cream. Mmmmm,0,0,0,Theresa Y.,"Westfield, NJ",4,41,98

Last night, however, we were seated in the main dining room.... next to a picture of Trump hanging on the wall. We don't go to a restaurant to have the owner's politics forced on us while we eat -- especially when those politics are so harmful and divisive. We'll definitely think twice before dining here again.",1,0,0,Maria J.,"Manhattan, NY",1,62,1
4.0,3/19/2019,"Amazing find ---  the 45$ prix fix menu is a great value!  It is on their website.   App, Entree, Side and Dessert --  Had the  Calamari- tender and expertly  fried, then  Hanger Steak done just right, Brussel Sprouts were  phenominal, (go figure) , the ""twinkie"" dessert  was light and  delicious and I usually am not into desserts.  Fairly large protions of expertly prepared steak and  Fish for a prix  fix menu--  great choice of wines by the glass-- the Pinot  was  very good.    Service was very kind and welcoming --  If you  have any doubts about  the place, try the prix fix  menu and see what you think -- we will be back for  a full menu  meal with friends.   I also  liked the room- it  allows for   conversation  and privacy -  Weve been ""next door"" to the Cafe L. and  have not been as impressed.  Lincoln Square should definitley  be giving them some  competition-- word needs to get out!",0,0,0,John S.,"New York, NY",0,6,3

2.0,2/16/2019,"The beet salad was not great. It seemed to have skin and very rough root, that maybe I should have cutoff before eating. The potatoes had rosemary. That is just personal preference, since I do not like rosemary. My friend's steak was almost all fat. He said there was very little meat that he could eat.The people working there were friendly, but service was lacking. The sides came with no serving spoons. I was not having an entree, only sides, but they did not give me a plate. And they did not come back for a long time to ask for spoons and a plate. The table next to us was very loud guys. They were using profanity every other word, which seemed to make the older couples around them uncomfortable. I know it's awkward, but if you are the manager, you need to ask them to keep it down. Or offer to buy them a drink to move them to the bar. Overall, very disappointing. We had high hopes. It's close to where we live, and the reviews were very good. But I don't think we will be back.",7,0,0,Angie W.,"New York, NY",1,13,2
4.0,2/12/2019,Came here for my husbands birthday and we were very happy with our experience. Cocktails were great and the interior decor was beautiful. we had the bone marrow to start. Definitely an acquired taste. I loved t but my husband didn't care for it much. I ordered the rack of lamb and my husband had the tomahawk steak. The only thing I was not crazy about was the lasagna Mac and cheese. I prefer those two things to be separate. Good food with great pricing in a beautiful restaurant.,0,0,2,nancy c.,"Chantilly, VA",283,45,42
2.0,2/11/2019,"Very disappointed. We paid $107 to have a cheeseburger, Scottish salmon, a side of spinach, and an apple crisp delivered to our door. The salmon was so small it would barely pass for an appetizer. It was also served with watery beans, instead of the sweet potato pure with mushrooms. The crisp was super flat and the ice cream was served in the same sized thimble that The ketchup was served in. The burger was fine but the fries were wilted and cold. We literally live 2 blocks away and would come here frequently, but this is the second time we've tried it and were disappointed. This is more akin to a Golden Corral without the variety and price point, instead of a high end steak house in an upscale neighborhood. We felt bad for them previously because they seemed to be struggling but we're so nice. Now we just want them to go away.",8,0,0,Peter F.,"Greensboro, NC",0,3,0

I first came here for my 30th Birthday and got the best steak with the perfect temperature. The bacon is to die for, hands down one of the best nights of my life. I then went back for their happy hour and the happy hour menu beats out most bars/pubs in the area. Who else has 2 quality beers for $8 in this area?

5.0,1/1/2019,"We decided to dine in the lounge area rather than the dining area so we didn't need a reservation.  Still intimate with live music playing so that was a plus for us. Started out with some calamari and according to my husband it's the best he's ever had (and I promise you he gets calamari everywhere we go!). I also had the tuna tartare which was served with chips and was very tasty. I had the chopped salad to go with my filet and I absolute loved the dressing that was on it. My steak was cooked as ordered - Medium and was very flavorful (I judge this on whether I need steak sauce or not-and I didn't). The potatoes were good and come in shareable sizes so we ordered a couple sides amongst three of us and we had more than enough food since we ordered appetizers. Drinks were tasty and our waitress was super nice and down to earth. I am so glad a friend of mine recommended this place as our last place to dine while we were visiting NYC, it definitely ended our trip with a great meal!!!",1,0,1,Amanda M.,"San Antonio, TX",168,107,690
2.0,12/28/2018,"I'm not one to usually post reviews on yelp, however, our experience at Lincoln Square Steak warrants one. Although the food was excellent, it took 38 minutes to be served entrees in a mostly empty dining room. The ""medium"" tuna my partner ordered was brought out rare. My steak was left on the table to get cold for the additional 8 minutes it took to cook the tuna to temperature.  This was all exacerbated by the fact that the server completely ignored us the entire time we were waiting for our food. It was obvious he was embararred about the issue but he would walk by our table and not even make eye contact with us. Management tried to mitigate the situation sending out an appetizer and ultimately comp-ing the entire check which was appreciated. . BUT, the cherry on top: after being told coat check was mandatory, the coat check girl could not find anyone's coats, despite having a ticket.

1.0,12/25/2018,"Total disappointment!! My husband and I ordered the Tomahawk ribeye, bone marrow and a side of veggies, the tomahawk came out burnt! We asked for something else instead and the manager came in took all the utensils on the table except one dessert fork for my husband, when the food we ordered the second time came, we have only 2 steak knife and 1 fork for dessert left on the table. The live band is probably making the restaurant alive but the music is a bit too loud to be honest. Second time we ordered bone in filet, we can almost certain that the grill/ stove whatever they are using is not cooking anything evenly, the steak came out the second time was also burnt.

When we got to our table it was set as a 2 top and there were 4 of us. We had to stand in the middle of the restaurant for a couple of minutes while hostess found someone to push the tables together. The service was mediocre and there were long periods of time between courses. When our main course finally came out two of the four meals were not hot and the salmon was grossly under cooked. Our waiter was not attentive and we had to remind him of our drink order when after 20 minutes we still had not received it.

1.0,12/22/2018,"Terrible service and rude bartender!  Been meaning to try this place for months, and I couldn't have been any more put off by the utterly draconian service experience that I endured.  Went in an hour before their official closing time to sit at the bar.  Before I even took my seat the bartender became visibly annoyed that she was going to have to deal with another customer.  When I told her I wanted my steak done between medium and medium-rare, she mentioned that her system couldn't handle such a request, which in and of itself is absurd.  Regardless, the place was (unsurprisingly) empty, and it wouldn't have been too hard for her to pop into the kitchen and alert the chef as to my request. When I finished placing my order with her, she immediately snaps back at me to say that she is going to have it all brought out at once.   After the food was brought out, she didn't put her cell phone down once, and I had to flag down a waiter from the dining room just to get a glass of water.  Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone...well maybe my worst enemy",9,0,0,Matt P.,"New York, NY",0,2,0

When you arrive they give you a garlic roll per person that is delicious and warm. For dinner we both had the bone in filet with creamed spinach, mash potato and corn pie. The sides were good and the steak was delecious. Just wish that I did not have to throw away a few ounces because the bottom of mine was completely charred,or in other words brunt. Beside that issue the dinner was amazing. For dessert we had the chocolate  cake which was good also. I would still recommend this place for a nice dinner.

Later, at about eight-ish, it was pretty quiet and we could actually hear a conversation. I had a filet mignon, which I thought was very very good. Another person in our party had the same streak cut with a bone in which they thought was better. I don't know, because they did not share any of their dinner with me.

I enquired if Bruno was on ... some very scared and upset faces answered ....sorry to inform you Bruno no longer employed at this restaurant.... I should have just left then and gone next door to Luxembourg Cafe. However, wanted to give it a shot..... SIMPLY PUT ......  can one guy make a restaurant ? in this case ..yes.... gone was all the personal touches ... the extra care that made us all feel so comfortable  and welcome ..... my porterhouse for one was maybe a pound at best including the bone. Steak was well prepared and cooked perfectly. But that is not enough to keep me coming back. As I was leaving lovely hostess said they were going to modernize the decor ? GOOD GOD LEAVE IT ALONE ...... the atmosphere is exactly what one wants for a steak house.... warm red colors ,leather, great private rooms........ DID I MENTION THAT THIS PLACE WAS EMPTY AND DEVOID OF HARDLY ANY PATRONS ? Not sure at this time if I will patronize this establishment any more.... yes I was a regular and live across the street .... interesting a neighbor in my building I saw coming out last night felt the same way .... he just did not know why the place seemed like a morgue..... RIP LINCOLN SQAURE STEAK .... some things just left better alone ...... SHAME SHAME SHAME UpdateSo they have reopened.... went into make a reservation.Just my opinion but interior has lost everything to do with steakhouse theme. The walls are now white that were a deep Bordeaux red.. modern decor kinda of .... I asked to see menu. One page , gone all the different cuts of Prime steaks .... no double eagles , Branzino , some things the same ... double Porterhouse...... anyways made a 7.30 pm reservation for my family and mother in town from California. They also were offering a 15% discount to residents of my building in NYC..... anyways never made it , on way over to restaurant my neighbor told me in elevator that had just eaten there few nights earlier.

3.0,10/28/2018,"Nice interiors and great service. We were able to get a reservation for Saturday dinner 2 days in advance. Dining room is spacious. Tried the bone marrow, octopus and bacon (peanut butter and jelly) for apps and the porterhouse for 2, ribeye and lamb chop for Mains. None of the apps stood out - marrow was under seasoned and pretty small for $16/18? a dish. It came with 6 or so pieces of thin, toasted bread and we ran out of marrow after 2 of these. Octo was very average, and the phnj bacon was strange. The steaks were both under seasoned and even the ribeye was not juicy/fatty which was disappointing. Lamb chops were great. Tried a few desserts andthe donut ice cream sandwich had BIG chunks of dark chocolate all over the vanilla ice cream - just way too weird.

I selected Lincoln Square because of the elegant atmosphere, menu and reasonable prices, compared to other places I considered. I was extremely happy with how everything turned out. It was a pleasure to work with Yvonne who provided me with the room, menu and beverage options.  She promptly answered my every question and was willing to accommodate special requests if necessary for people with restricted diets, which turned out not to be necessary. We were 25 people in the Lincoln Room. I selected the $95 pp menu - with a choice of three appetizers, four entrees, three sides, though Yvonne let me pick a fourth side, and two desserts. Appetizer options I chose were soup (NE Clam Chowder or Butternut Squash), Ceasar salad and lump crab cake. The entrees I chose were salmon, chicken, fillet mignon and a veggie pasta dish. The dessert options were vanilla ice cream or chocolate cake. I opted to serve a red and white wine by the bottle. The guests raved about the food, wine and the ambiance.

On top of that ... he added a steak and fries to the bill, which we didn't order or eat and he seemed confused when we let him know it wasn't our bill. The service was cold and the bartender ignored us all night. When he wasn't ignoring us he was being condescending or making math errors. Finally another bartender came over and told us the tip we left wasn't enough to cover the bill, we explained that we had already paid and the other bartender had processed the check.

1.0,9/10/2018,"My advice to you:  Even if you receive a discount, don't go.  The experience was terrible and terribly expensive for what you get.  Almost every steadkhouse in NYC is better than this one.  My Son and I went to Lincoln Square 2 years ago under the old ownership, and it was fabulous, one of the best meals we ever had.  Now this restaurant is under new ownership and opened again only a week ago.  We received a 20% discount in the mail and regrettably decided to try it.  Granted it was a Monday night and a Jewish holiday, but there were people at only about 6 tables all the while we were there.  They also have a long bar, and there was no one at all at the bar.When we arrived we were seated in a booth at the end of a row of booths.  The cloth looked old and somewhat tattered, but we ignored that since we knew a new owner just took over.  Trying to order wine was a fiasco.  They had a long wine list, but when we tried to order, they came back several times and said they didn't have that wine.  We asked the waiter for recommendations, and he recommended a $65 bottle of wine that wasn't very good.  He really knew nothing about any of the wines on the list.  We tasted it and accepted it, but knew it wasn't the greatest.  We can get a $12.99 Chilean wine at the liquor store which is much better.I asked about the East Coast Oysters for an appetizer, and the waiter said the only selection was Blue Points.  That ended that.  So, my Son and I both ordered pumpkin soup for $12. It was good but kind of expensive.  Then we ordered a 12 oz what was supposed to be prime filet at $42 and creamed spinach ($9).  The spinach was good, but meat - not so much.  It didn't seem to be prime and it clearly tasted of tenderizer - very difficult to chew.  The waiter did pour the wine, but was too present.  He didn't have any other customers and apparently had nothing to do because every few minutes he came over asking if everything was OK.  One time would have been enough.We passed on dessert and asked for the check.  That is when the craziness got crazier.  We had a 20% discount card, but they left that off of the check.  When we questioned it, the waiter reluctantly took the check back and included the discount.  The check, as seems to be the custom now, had a calculation for 18%, 20% and 22% tip.  We felt that, since the experience was mediocre at best a 15% tip was more than adequate.  In a really professional establishment, the waiter waits for you to leave the table before taking the check folder off the table.  Not in this place.  The waiter couldn't wait to take it while we were still seated.  Then, talk about audacity, he came back to our table and questioned the tip.  That is when I went ballistic, and told him 15% was perfectly adequate.  As we were leaving the Manager approached us, and I told what I thought of the place and that they needed to get their act together.Needles to say, never, ever will I go back to that restaurant as long as it is under this new ownership.  It is unpleasant and a total ripoff.",7,3,0,Dorothy Y.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,0

With only about 8 tables running it took our waiter 20 min just to greet us and took 50 min to receive a drink that was not the drink we ordered. The food was ok but they over cooked my sisters steak pretty badly with a burnt outside layer. We arrived at 7:50 and did not leave until 11 taking our waiter 30 min just to get a check. I wanted to mention to someone I was a little upset because I see my sister so rarely and this was suppose to be a special dinner, however, no one bothered to ask how my dinner was.

3.0,7/19/2018,"Took my wife here for our anniversary. Very nice restaurant. A decor was dated. It felt like it was great for an over 55 crowd. With all the steakhouses in ny with fresh, chic decor, I was disappointed. They had a 1930's mural up and red walls everywhere. Place was dark. Not in a good way. My wife and I were decked out like we've done in other steakhouses but here the customers were in casual dress, ugh! The food was good and big portions. We could barely eat half of the porter house. I've eaten better steaks. It had a smoky ting to it I didn't like. The apps were good. Mushroom were very good. It was very earthy, the way I like it. A pleasant surprise is that they took a photo of us and placed it on a frame that said happy anniversary. Overall, I would recommend this place if you want to be in very casual wear, ages 55+ and like outdated decor. (They had a pianist there but that's so passé!",2,0,0,Frank M.,"Brooklyn, NY",135,49,37

The wine steward said many wines were coming in on Monday. This was Saturday. We tolerated a highly overpriced Malbec. They had no I Cabernet Sauvignon for sale.. at a steakhouse.

5.0,5/29/2018,"The food at Lincoln Square Steak is exceptional, but it is the humanity, kindness and genuine interest that makes this one of the best food experiences I have ever had in my life. My husband surprised me and took me here for 5th year anniversary dinner, before we went to the opera. From the moment we walked in you could feel the kindness of the staff, as the hostesses wished us Happy Anniversary, and then brought us to our table which they had decorated beautifully with rose petals and candles (without any request from us!)We had the Prix Fix menu, which included the appetizer, entree and dessert. I have noticed that sadly when you order from a prix fix menu in many restaurants you can almost instantly feel yourself become seen as less important and subsequently ignored. This was absolutely not the case here! The wait staff, the manager, the hostess, and even the owner, Bruno, all treated us like VIPs that night. They all came over to wish us a Happy Anniversary.The food was divine, the Canadian bacon appetizer that my husband ordered was so unbelievably delicious! As was everything we ordered that night! After our main course was complete and they were bringing out our dessert the manager, owner, and hostess all brought over a complimentary creme brulee, which as everything else we had that night, was one of the best I have ever had!The hostess then brought out a camera and took a lovely photograph of my husband and I, which they then put into a thank you card that was signed by Bruno. These things may seems insignificant to some people, but to me it meant a great deal to go out to a restaurant such as this and be treated with the honor, respect and kindness that seems to be slowly disappearing from the NYC food service industry.I am so gratefully that my husband found this restaurant! I would not want to have celebrated my anniversary anywhere else, and I think we may even make it a part of our anniversary tradition to return to this amazing establishment every year!

Before the main, we got complimentary mushroom ravioli and it was absolutely excellent. It definitely got my taste buds prepared for the steakFor the main I got the prime aged rib eye with the potato gratin and the cream spinach and man that steal was really tender and juicy.

1.0,3/8/2018,"This is why my sister doesn't like to try new restaurants. We try them all the time and this happens on rare occasions. Why is that living sort of in the neighborhood we had never heard of Lincoln Square Steak?  Lesson 1. But we were in the mood for a steak, it was local, it had good ratings, and we could get a reservation anytime we wanted.  Uh huh. Any time we wanted. Boom. Lesson 2. I don't know why I didn't get that.  So let's get to specifics. I could write about the two women who were walking out as we were walking in dressed in extraordinarily tight, shiny clothes, the type of clothes one might see on a caricature of an Eastern European woman of very questionable career choice, but that might have been coincidence.  We walked in and were overwhelmed by red - everything was red, the walls, the ceiling, the fake beams and even the lipstick on the lovely hostess.  The decor was like a caricature of a red, bad, Chinese restaurant that I was assured that it never was before.  My companion wanted to bail right then but I'm no quitter.  So we sat down next to one another in a booth; very nice, a red, red banquette with a white table cloth. It was very cozy and romantic. As the light reflected on her face I thought she was sunburned. My hands too, sunburned.  No just too much red. She had decided to refrain from alcohol for the evening so instead of a nice bottle of wine I had a cocktail. The scotch on the rocks was a lot more rocks than scotch so within a couple of minutes I ordered a second one, even before ordering dinner. More rocks arrived with a splash of scotch.  About the service. The waiter was fine. At lot of waiters are totally uninterested. I get that. But he didn't even try to fake it. Here's to authenticity. We ordered dinner.  Shrimp cocktail and a NY strip for me.  Oysters and filet for her.  Brussel sprouts to split. Did I mention the clientele?  Imagine!  I love feeling young and hip even though I'm 66. Not important.  Back to the food.  First came the popover.  I love popovers but there was no pop, and quickly it was over. There was no hollow center. There were no flakes when we tore the fabric feeling bread apart. There might have been last week but not tonight.  And they make it with cheese. One and three quarters of the two popovers went uneaten.  Then came the shrimp cocktail; good, but the shrimp at room temperature wasn't quite right. And the oysters, Blue Points, mild, low risk, should I say tasteless? And then while waiting too long for our main courses to arrive we worked to admire the faux, art deco mural on the back wall. We found it somewhat, vaguely, reminiscent of Leger or Diego Rivera or Maxwell Parrish but only if we squinted so hard our heads felt like exploding. Then our steaks came.  They didn't screw them up.  We ordered them rare and they came medium rare, just as we expected.  We had finally begun to size this place up.  At this point I have to say there was nothing terribly wrong though I left a third of my steak on the plate, and I've never done that before in my entire life, not because it didn't taste good but because my arm was tired from the extreme effort necessary to cut it into bites and my jaw was exhausted from the chewing effort. My companion finished her 8 ounce filet and when I inquired said, blah, whatever that means.  No dessert.  We were exhausted.

3.0,2/25/2018,"At approx $500 for four people, the food was quite good. However, at these price points you really can't seat customers at tables that wobble. At our table, they 'fixed' the problem by shoving a menu under the center table pedestal. This is fine at a bar, but not at an upscale restaurant. The thick side of the binder-style menu was directly under my feet, so we asked to move as I was not able to sit naturally.They happily moved us, but sat us at a folding table which was clearly added to the dining room as it had metallic legs that snapped into place. The table leg was directly between my legs for the rest of the meal. The restaurant was not crowded and they could have sat us anywhere  as 2/3 of the tables were open. At that point, I didn't want to ask to be moved a second time.So even though the food and service was good - the chef even sent out an appetizer and a tray of desserts - I don't want to pay this kind of money to be uncomfortable throughout the entire meal.",0,0,0,Sara G.,"Manhattan, NY",102,243,14

The decor is very cool, with a NYC vibe and lots of fun pics, and the dining room is amazing, surrounded on 3 walls with wine cellars, and the fourth wall an amazing mural.As for the food, not only do they do an amazing strip steak and filet mignon, the accompanying sauces are incredible(the steak sauce is awesome). The Brook trout is outstanding as well. On top of all of this, the prices are beyond fair for NY, and I'd say very competitive. And the portions are nicely sized as well.

5.0,2/21/2018,"Here's my annual review where I admit with modest amounts of embarrassment that I participate in a tradition called ""Galentine's Day"". A day in which your friends in relationships take you out to dinner so you don't feel alone on actual Valentine's Day at some point prior or post the Hallmark Holiday. Though, I can't complain because we threw down. And I definitely wasn't sober for my train ride, watching the Olympics, and convincing myself that I don't need sleep for energy hours later. The ambiance - beautiful. They have almost magical little rooms tucked away in different corners of the huge spread of a place. One was blue and one was dark red. Like Christian's red room of pain. We were situated near a lovely little mural though of people drawn art deco in 1920's or 30's attire, sipping cocktails, lounging, listening to some piano man and with their nipples clearly showing through whatever shear fabric they were wearing. I couldn't take my head away from it or from the picture of what looked like Adam Driver from the 1970's on the wall, but it couldn't have been him and had to be some kind of doppelganger daddy. The cocktails. Don't even get me started. I clearly loved all of them. Note, I did not try all of them. But there was a slightly fruity one with prosecco that we all agreed was the favorite of the evening. They also make mean grasshoppers if you're into sweet things and I enjoyed The Dottie P. - made with Gin, Maraschino, Cocchi Americano, Dolin Dry, and Orange Bitters.They serve warm popovers to start with, which I enjoyed. You rarely see a huge popover come to the table instead of traditional bread but this also had a whole wheat taste to it. It wasn't as flaky and puffy as I would have liked if it were made with a different grain. Appetizers - TRUFFLE LOBSTER MAC & CHEESE. Hands down that was my favorite thing I tried here and so so worth it. Maybe not the best mac and cheese I've ever had in my life but it's up there and had a generous serving of lobster in the baked dish. Steak tartare - it was good and tasted fresh but I wasn't feeling it that night. I was more feeling the crab cake and enjoyed the sauce it was in. Side of creamed spinach however was my least favorite thing. My dining partners enjoyed it but it had a metallic like taste to it and wasn't so much creamy or had cheese in it but all I tasted was a pungent iron taste. The best thing here though aside from their steak (because hello, we're in a steak house) is their chicken parm which is cut into the style of a round pizza pie. The chicken acts as the crust and a slathering of fresh mozz, sauce, and fresh basil rests on top. Definitely this dish is worth checking out alone at Lincoln. Deserts - Tiramisu was super boozy tasting. But the winner desert to get is their warm chocolate souffle. Don't screw this up. I've instructed you well, young padawan. Now go hither and check out Lincoln's Square Steak.",8,2,6,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",843,1384,11457
5.0,2/18/2018,"FLAWLESS! My friend and I came in for a ladies night and were SO impressed from start to finish! Everything from the service to the food was absolutly perfect! We started with the chicken parm pizza which is just a super large chicken parm covered in sauce and cheese and sliced like a pizza. It's probably about the size of a 12 inch pizza and definitely big enough for 4 people to share as an appetizer. It was DELICIOUS! Perfectly cooked and the sauce was really something special.Next up we had the Porterhouse for two. Again, PERFECT!! It had one of the best presentations I've seen on a family style steak and every single piece was cooked exactly as we ordered it with no variation on the end pieces! It was absolutly melt in your mouth. We got a few sides with the steak. The truffle mac n cheese, fries, broccoli and caramelized onions. All of them were excellent! Finally we ended our meal with a variety dessert plate that included tiramisu, cheesecake, cream puffs and conolies, a creme brûlée and a plate of cotton candy. Everything was superb but the cotton candy was SO fresh and just melted in your mouth. I have to give a special shout out to our server Jack, who made excellent suggestions and made sure our wine (and Diet Coke) glasses were never empty. The only regret I have is that I left my leftover chicken parm at the table and didn't get to enjoy the left overs the next day.

It was a great steak house after church and we wanted to celebrate.We got red and white wine, based on the manager's recommendation. it was really good. I'm no wine-atic, so I can not attest to the wine, but for the casual drinker, it was good. the inside is very elegant. We got Caesar salad, it comes with a light sauce and strip of anchovy, at first, you're like, anchovies... but, it mixes well with the salad. eat it in pieces, not a whole.we got the 16 oz filet mignon and had it done medium well. it was good, soft and cut easily. the herb fries were a bit burnt. we did not send it back. why? just didn't, not burnt enough to send back, I suppose.when I reserved the place, I mentioned that it was an engagement dinner, they graciously took a photo and printed it on a keepsake and the owner of the establishment came and wished us his warmest congratulations. We really appreciated it. They also brought out cremee brulee and side dish of treats. it was all very good. We enjoyed it very much.Due to location and timing, this place will always have a special place in our memories. We hope to be back periodically to reminisce about the special weekend.

When I attempted to leave the ladies room, I was blocked in by waiters and one asked those coming into the kitchen to let me through, yet they continued walking pushing me slightly on accident I presume. We ordered the porterhouse for two at a temperature of medium and it came out rare. Then they poured champagne for it being almost midnight, and yet again there was food on the outside of my glass.

I ordered fillet medium rare and was given something at medium well or well done. I am not the kind sending things back to kitchen every weekend but it did not make sense to accept such an obvious mistake at Lincoln Sqaure steakhouse's price point. The steak was brought back to me by a ""manager"" with an explanation that it really was medium rare, and I was told that I was the one who was mistaken.

1.0,12/25/2017,"I wouldnt give this place a single star but i am required to do so. Anyway here I go - A month or so ago i bought a deal in LivingSocial that consisted on a dinner for two at this place with the choice of 1 appetizer, 1 entree, 1 side, 1 dessert for each person, and a bottle of wine to share. Given that I am a lawyer I am used to reading all terms and conditions -and I mean ALL T&Cs. After reading the restrictions and conditions to redeem such coupon and ensuring I could redeem it on Christmas Eve, I booked a table for two for Christmas Eve. Few days before Christmas Eve, i was contacted by the restaurant just to confirm the reservation; at which point I indicated i meant to redeem the LivingSocial deal, to which the lady on the phone mentioned they would accommodate me and she ascertain she would write it down. Needless to say, the date has arrived for me to go and enjoy my delicious dinner at this gorgeous place (pics on their website are great) but .... Something preposterous happened! The hostess told me i could not redeem my coupon because it was a Holiday and that was under the T&Cs of the deal, to which i replied that Christmas Eve is NOT a Federal Holiday and that one of the restrictions was that the deal could not be redeemed either on a Friday or Saturday, or during any of the Federal Holidays, nor on Valentines, or Mother's Day. She had the audacity to change her version and said : Well, the owner decided that no coupons or deals could be redeemed today. So, (i) how could you run a restaurant that certainly does not comply to any of the legal terms and restrictions set by sites where you advertise and sell deals like this one to the public? Does it mean you do not care at all about complying to it? (ii) Are you a serious establishment? I am pretty sure that if i tried to pay my bill with Monopoly money you as the business owner would be offended and would not take it, correct? Then why do i have to take this lack of respect and professionalism from you and your staff? Not a single apology came out of the hostess but a certainly challenging attitude. Honestly, I thought i was dealing with a serious business run by what seems to be a person who knows the restaurant business deeply. Either you have made a wrong choice and hired incompetent staff, or you are not invested enough in your own business. All I can say is shame particularly because we know that standards are very high in this city and I truly hope you do something to fix it. Otherwise i can see in a near future you trying to sell more of these deals in Living Social or Groupon as your business may not seem to do well.",4,0,0,Daphne B.,"Naperville, IL",0,4,0

5.0,11/28/2017,"This post is about a private event that was held on November 25th. We were looking to have an intimate dinner for 40 to celebrate our marriage. We visited several and requested information from restaurants that could accommodate our small party.  After careful considering many venues in Manhattan we decided on Lincoln Square Steak.From the first moment we met with event coordinator Yvonne, we knew we made the right choice. She is just amazing to work with! She was extremely flexible and creative in how to achieve what we were looking to do and was always responsive to our emails and calls. She really cares and wants to make sure your event a success. On the day of our wedding, Yvonne was right there to comfort and continually reassure us that all would go as planned and she was absolutely right. It went flawlessly. The waitstaff were so friendly and yet very professional.  We decided to offer our guests an open menu instead of one of their fixed ones which initially concerned me about the execution.  I was afraid that some people would be served at their table while others waited for theirs. However, that concern never materialized and the food was served on time and it was by all accounts delicious and plentiful. A close friend thanked us for not offering ""the same dried stuffed chicken"" as most other weddings. The wedding cake that was made in-house was not only beautiful but absolutely delicious. Our guess  is that Lincoln Square Steaks will have 40 potential new patrons based upon the praises we received throughout the evening. I want to sincerely thank Yvonne, the wonderful owners and their amazing staff for making our wedding party a memorable one, not only for us but for all that attended.

I'm SO happy we picked Lincoln Square Steak. This is definitely not your average steakhouse! As soon as we were seated, the owner (Bruno) walked over to our table to introduce himself and welcome us - he even sent us out a Lobster Ravioli on the house for us to sample. As an avid diner in NYC, that level of personal touch and service is so rare to find these days, unless you're already friends with the chef or owner. I was really impressed by the level of care, especially for two pre-theater diners! I was planning to order a steak, but when the waiter came over to tell us about their Veal Parmigiana Special for 2 (which apparently will soon be added to the menu) we had to try it. Hands down the best Veal Parm I've ever had - I also loved how they served it in a square pan so it looks like a Grandma Pizza Pie- so fun! We ate as much as we could  but the portion was so big we could have had a third person. Honestly the best deal in town.As we were leaving, we walked by some of their private rooms which are equally as stunning and unique as the dining room -- feels like a true New York establishment.

5.0,11/9/2017,"From the moment I walked into this place, I knew I was in for something different.  This isn't your average steakhouse by any means.  The bar area had a piano player playing tunes from a time gone by but the room felt sleek and modern, with deep reds throughout.  Upon entering the main dining room, I was pleasantly surprised by its brightness.  The owner, Bruno, greeted me right as I sat and recommended I try a new dish, a chicken parmigiana and penne alla vodka combination (plated separately but served together).  I was into trying it and I'm so glad I did.  It had to be the best chicken parm I've had in recent memory.   It was served in a square tray, playfully paying homage to the restaurant's name I gather, and looked like a grandma's Sicilian style pizza that I grew up with.  Upon taking the pizza cutter into it, you discover the dish is completely chicken parm and it was cooked to perfection.  The pene alla vodka that came with it had a nice kick courtesy of some sprinkled red peppers and by the time we were through my guest and I were stuffed.  Now I just need to go back and try the steak!",1,0,0,Marie A.,"New York, NY",49,137,17

The potatoes were seasoned with something that tasted like cracked pepper and a hint of spice, perhaps cayenne. They were addicting.  The owner was lovely. You could tell he was so proud of the restaurant and he should be! The decor is unique- it really sets itself apart. I loved the bright hand painted mural in the background and the the live piano music made our experience extra special.

3.0,10/13/2017,"3.5 Stars - I went here with the groupon which was a great value. You get two apps, two sides, two mains, and 2 deserts, with a glass of wine each for around $110. The restaurant itself is beautiful - old school new york. You can tell it was once a really nice place like 20-30 years ago when Lincoln Center was more a center of what was going on in the city. Service was also very good. We did not use the wine and ordered mixed cocktails instead as we don't like wine, we fully expected to pay full price for the cocktails but the waiter discounted them as we didn't order the wine (don't expect that to be given - depends on waiter I would assume). Let me preface it with you get what you get with a groupon. The menu is limited with the groupon and the only good steak option was the petite filet. I am more of a rib eye kind of guy so was pretty disappointing. The bread poppers were cold and under cooked. Everything else we ordered was delicious. If you are looking for a steak house experience for a very reasonable price, go with this groupon.

What really impressed us was the owner Bruno who came to our table twice just to make sure everything was fine. We had scallops and crab cake for appetizer which tasted really good. As an Entree we had mouth watering Filet Mignon, the quality of the meat was extraordinary. And for dessert we had cheesecake, tiramisu and chocolate mousse cake. The waiter explained to us that the desserts are all homemade. We left the restaurant with a huge smile on our face. I recommend this place to everyone who's looking for a classy enjoyable evening.

Carlos, our sommelier, was such a happy guy and helped us select a great bottle of red...that was decanted in a really funky Reidel decanter for us. The steaks..unbelievable. The temperatures were exactly what we ordered. Creamed spinach on the side was the best I've ever had in my life. They had a choice of nice pre fixe menu too if you preferred, which I took advantage of. Complimentary pumpkin ravioli was sent our way to sample. The pasta was obviously home made and melt in your mouth delicious.  Owner, Bruno, was a hoot and was great to chat with...he gave us a little history of the place. Music...started with the ""back seat oldies"" and graduated to modern pop by the end of the meal. I know it sounds crazy, but it worked and we were loving it. Decor was RED! Warm and red. Like a steak house should be.The dinner concluded with complimentary birthday desserts and a picture to remember them by. My twin and I felt like the royalty.

2.0,8/13/2017,"A very subpar experience given the prices. The atmosphere as well was a challenge to enjoy as it's sort of had old school charm with good amounts of dust if you get my drift. The steak tartare was unremarkable and although perhaps the intenti and it's not fantastic,on was to let the meat shine through, it just tasted Bland. The complimentary Yorkshire puddings were interesting, although very heavy as they contained cheese. The filet mignon was similar to the steak tartare and that it was very one-dimensional in terms of its flavor. It certainly was tender and the first bite or two was good but when you keep getting the same thing bite after bite and it's not fantastic, it leaves you wanting. The pork chop was a bit too salty and slightly overcooked. One thing I will call out, is that although I ordered a beer that came in a bottle, they brought me the draft of a different flavor, when I pointed it out to them they apologized and then a couple minutes later brought me back the exact same thing, when I pointed it out again they finally got it right, but I did miss enjoying my drink with my food because of that. At that point I definitely expect to get my drink comped, which they did not do. You should also know especially if you're from out of town that this is a restaurant that will round the change up or down and give you back only bills, this was a shock to me. It's important to note that most definitely not all restaurants in New York do this in fact it's only been a minority I've been to so far, but they would have you believe it's very common place when in fact it is not.",1,0,0,YE B.,"New York, NY",0,51,2

5.0,8/12/2017,"They usually have some groupon deal going on - HIGHLY recommend snatching one. They offer dinner for 2 and dinner for 4. Compared to their regular prices - these groupon deals are prefixed with plenty of options to choose from - are VERY worth dishing out the money for it.With that said I've alway passed by and thought it was ""too high end"" or ""too fancy"" - totally not the case. I mean I wouldn't roll in with ripped jeans and flip flops - but you don't need to wear a suit. Overall, very warm and inviting atmosphere - from the hostess to the waiter who cracked jokes all night and was fun to be around.As for the groupon deal (which you can also find on their website under menus): you get to choose an appetizer, side dish, main dish, and dessert (one per each person.) As well, the deal comes with a bottle of wine that's under $30 - and there's 30 options!  Go into it with a sharing mentality because you'll want to divide and conquer and try everything. It's that delicious.My partner and I got:Appetizer: Fried calamari & Mixed Green salad (the irony - I know!)Entree: Filet Mignon 8oz & the Prime Pork ChopSides: Whipped Yukon Potato Puree & Mac&Cheese Dessert: Tiramisu & CheesecakeLet me tell you - my mind was blown. Honestly, its right up there on my list of one of the BEST meals I've ever had. Everything was cooked beautifully and to our liking. You don't go to a steak house and not get a steak! but I will say I tried the Filet Mignon, and they know how to cook their meats period - the pork chop was tender, full of flavor, and just great. I honestly don't know what else to say, other than this is a MUST TRY spot. One bite and you'll be happy that you got that groupon special!

The crust was dry and personally all that was edible was the inside Also complimentary for each person was a taste of mushroom ravioli in a white cream sauce which made me very excited  because it was excellent. From the menu, started with the seafood platter that came with lobster, shrimp, crab meat, oysters, and clams that were generous, plump, and juicy. Loved the strong horseradish that accompanied it . Had to try the crab cake which was fresh tasting and full of chunky crab meat!! Also the beet salad was typical - relative to the entire meal this was just a requirement to get some greens. But really all the proteins were amazing On to the main dish, got the porterhouse medium rare and I was so happy it had minimal fat but was big on flavor! Very impressive execution as well .. nice crusty exterior yet tender enough to eat .. the servers plated us and made sure to top off our slices with the pan sauce. Also enjoyed the Chilean sea bass which was simply grilled and served with this delicious balsamic vinaigrette dressing drizzled on the side. Side of onion rings were good; wild mushrooms very goodFor desserts, there were 4 choices which all looked good: carrot cake, cheese cake, creme brulee, tiramisu, and profiteroles. Tried a little of each - favorites were the creme brulee and all the cakes.. they're really delicious. I normally am not a fan of creme brulee but this was outstanding. At the end of the evening my group was taking pictures and how nice for the staff to take pictures for us .. not only with our smartphones but with their own device. They printed a copy for each of us.I really wanted to try a bunch of other dishes and hope to be back soon. I found the atmosphere inviting and comfortable, staff was friendly and attentive, and the food from start to finish pleasing to my senses and wonderfully satisfying",3,3,2,Rose I.,"Manhattan, NY",105,441,3759

4.0,5/28/2017,"Fantastic appetizers! Got the raw clams and the scallops appetizers, both of which were excellent. I got the sea bass, which was very filling (I actually had to give the last few bites to the boyfriend BC I was so full). Not bad but I didn't love the crusting they did on the top of the fillet so will probably try for something else next time I come. As a pescetarian dating someone who loves steak, I was impressed with the seafood options here. Much more variety than most steakhouses. Truffle mac and cheese app wasn't bad. Didn't taste much of the truffle though, unfortunately. I don't eat meat but the boyfriend says the dry aged ribeye was full of flavor, one of the better steakhouses in NY, and 24 oz is a very reasonable portion. The restaurant has a slight tendency to overcook, so he ordered a rare plus with the intention of it coming medium rare, which is exactly what happened. Ambiance was great. Loved the live piano music. Romantic setting inside and very friendly service and the chef gave a complimentary mushroom ravioli for each of us and a complimentary plate of desserts, which included a slice of very rich cheesecake, a large piece of tiramisu, and two cream puffs.

The service and decor was beautiful. The food was really good as well. I choose 4 stars because it was very pricey and the food options were odd. My pork was dry but everyone else in our group liked their cook. They only offer 24oz of some meats and it's such a huge portion for one person. It says serves two but why would you only sell a portion for 2 so then people have to share. The main dishes have no sides, so for your dinner unless you pay more money for a side your just eating meat by it self. I don't think thats a well rounded choice for a meal, it seems to be a ploy for higher bills.

Even with that, the owner came over to say hello and wish us a happy anniversary and they had someone take our photo and have a card made with the date.

2.0,5/7/2017,"This is my 4th review of all time, and the only bad review. Ironically, I came here half a year ago when I visited NY, I love steak, so I found this place on Yelp. Atmosphere is good, service is good, we ordered some wine, appetizer and a 56$ bone in ribeye.However, that was probably THE worst steak I've ever had, I always order medium-rare, but this steak is at least medium-well, and it was NOT tasty at all. Spending 120$ at last for myself, this is probably the worst dining experience I've ever had. Because you know, the quality of the food comes first when reviewing the restaurant.Okay, time goes to today. Me and my friend came back to NY and trying to have a good steak as always. Again ironically I somehow found this place on yelp, without us both relializing this is the place we visted last time.After parking we came to the front door and OMG it's this one again...... However we are pretty hungry plus it's cold outside, so my friend persuaded me to give it another try. Ok I'll keep it short, the steak last time was 1 point (for the bread), the steak this time (which I ordered a different kind) is 5 point out of 10 point... It's just normal... better than last time, but it doesn't come close to good, and believe me I've tried a lot of steakhouses around the States (Best in Texas).Okay that's about it, and this time the service is not good, maybe because I only ordered steak this time, cost 70$ in total.My friends' steak taste OK, maybe I'm just unlucky, who knows.",1,2,1,Bin S.,"Laramie, WY",0,4,1

The service initially was pretty shitty. I had to literally yell after a waiter to get his attention. He was at the table right next to us which means he was close enough to touch but failed to turn around and ask us how we were. Somewhere along the dinner we changed waiters and it was much better. The appetizers were good. We had the beef tartare, yellow pea soup and crab cakes. There was no flavor in any of the entrees and we had a ribe eye, the salmon and the trout. The mac and cheese was a disgrace. Just a bunch of noodles with minimal cheese. The mashed potatoes had no flavor and the cream spinach tasted weird. Desserts were average. Nothing special.

The place is larger than I thought it was. Two of us ordered from the Restaurant Week menu and the rest from the regular menu. The food was okay: decent and tasty, but it didn't blow our minds. I'm taking another star off because of the service. We were sitting there for at least 20 minutes before the waiter finally made an appearance. He didn't introduce himself, greet us, or ask us if we had any questions. We basically ordered, and then he left. And then after we finished our meal, it took us forever to find him and get the check. We actually had to ask someone else for the check because he was nowhere to be found.

It's not as tender as expected and very plain. The mashed potato was also plain but smooth and creamy, perfect with some salt and pepper added.2. Hanger steak with macaroni and cheese side  : The steak was very good and not too chewy. The mac and cheese tasted more like mac and oil, very oily and not enough cheese. Desserts:1.

5.0,3/5/2017,"My girlfriend and I have heard about Lincoln Square Steak from fellow yelpers & some locals, and our expectations were set super high, and not only did they meet those lofty expectations... they exceeded them!!!First, they start you off with amazing popovers that are buttery and baked to perfection. What a perfect way to start your dinner experience!!!The wine list there is super extensive, so naturally we couldn't come to a conclusion on what bottle of wine to get, so we asked for help and they provided us with an amazing bottle that perfectly fit within our price range, had the bold flavor and full body that we prefer, and perfectly complimented the meal that we were about to have.Next up was the famous ravioli of the day (compliments of the chef) and last night it was a mushroom ravioli in a decadent cream sauce that was delightful. The earthy flavors of the mushrooms really shined through, and the only disappointing part of that dish was the fact that I devoured it immediately.In very short order came the main event... I ordered the porterhouse for 1, and all I can say is wow!!! I've eaten in my share of restaurants around the country in my 34 years, and I am willing to admit that was the best steak I have ever had in my life!!! Cooked to perfection, perfectly cut and basted in beautiful brown butter with fresh herbs and just perfect on every level. They also gave me a green peppercorn sauce on the side (this steak didn't need any sauce whatsoever) and it was deliciously smoky and full of flavor of the pepper. My girlfriend got the petite filet and she said it was perfect as well. I was boring and I got a baked potato as my side, but my girlfriend got the Brussels sprouts on the side, and she said they were to die for!!!After our feast, the waiter brought out desserts for us, and I somehow found room to have a slice of cheesecake and a bite of tiramisu which was amazing as well!!! All in all this place is top notch, the service was super friendly and very professional and the owner, who came over and greeted us after our meal, was engaging and the type of person who I would absolutely love to give my business to over and over again.

2.0,3/5/2017,Food was fine but they employ underhanded sales tactics. Trying to upsell us on wine multiple times. Bringing more glasses and pouring for more people than requested.

5.0,3/3/2017,"Given how impressed my father was with this restaurant, he insisted we bring my mother and the promise was realized today on a bitterly cold winter day in New York City.  We had the privilege of being attended by Faruk whose professionalism is only surpassed by his genuinely warm interpersonal approach. Faruk knew exactly what to say and do to make you feel completely at ease and comfortable with the environment and gastronomic offerings.  It is because of the quality of the persons who work there that you return in addition to the allure of the exquisite food.We were pleasantly surprised with an incredible porcini ravioli which was homemade and discreetly enveloped by a light cream sauce.  I broke the cardinal rule of ordering something different than steak in a steakhouse and was not disappointed.  The boneless grilled branzino was custom prepared as to my instruction.  I asked not to have any lemon butter sauce and had an incredibly seared on the outside filet that was perfectly moist inside.  Not to mention the delicately cut garlic and meticulously introduced seasoning which was transparent and at the same time slightly more complex than simply salt and pepper.The seafood appetizer was incredible fresh and not too badly priced given how Manhattan prices always overshadow other less affluent boroughs. The steaks I observed were perfectly made and complemented by homemade sauces that were different yet recognizable at the same time. Creamed spinach with truffle oil is the best spinach I ever had. Further, one gets the impression they do not use frozen spinach.  But after all is said and done, the real hit of the night wait our wonderful waiter Faruk who treated us like family.  We were moved by the complimentary dishes and his humanity.",0,0,0,A A.,"Rego Park, NY",33,323,0

I asked for a medium and it came medium well, if it wasn't  flavored as well as it was I would have sent it back but the flavor of the stake saved it lol. I only had two issues it took almost 30 mins after sitting down for a waiter to come and take our orders after that the food came quickly. The second issue was the dessert I had the cream puffs and they were stale, get the cheesecake if anything.

3.0,2/19/2017,"Special occasion, casual post V-Day celebration.  Overall a solid restaurant and I would return. I planned a special evening of massages, followed by dinner and then a movie for myself and ""Blue"".  Made a reservation at Lincoln Square Steakhouse and it was exactly what you would expect from an old school steak house, complete with coat check, music playing, red décor and a bar stocked with a plethora of whiskey (Scotch, bourbon, rye, mash).  After checking our coats, we had a drink at the bar while we waited for our table to be prepared.  My date had a Manhattan with Woodford Reserve and I had Bulleit rye on the rocks.  My drink was perfect (pretty had not to be) and while he (my date) said the Manhattan was not made correctly, he did note that it was a generous pour of liquor that made up for that.After a short wait we were escorted to our table.  We ordered a bottle of red wine for the table.  Unfortunately what we ordered wasn't in stock.  Our second choice the Jordan wine was overpriced so the waiter brought us a bottle of Frog's Leap and Andrew Hill to chose from... I didn't know the Andrew Hill winery (Washington).  Blue knew the winery, so we ordered that.  It was $65 for the bottle. The wine was great, dark chocolate, slightly jammy, but still tight.  Waiter was gone by the time we both agreed it was a tight.  Didn't ask for a  decanter, but we let it aerate in our respective glasses  (and open bottle) while we finished our cocktails.Overall wine list was impressive with reds and whites from all over including France, Italy, California and Washington.  Look carefully at the bottle prices you will find some are a much better value than others.  (Again we felt the Jordan red was overpriced, however found something else comparable in taste at a better price.)The server delivered a giant popover with a side of butter to get us started.  It was airy and huge.  I didn't dare finish mine so early in the meal.Appetizers were great.  I ordered oysters on the half shell and he had a salad.  Once finished with that the waiter brought us a mushroom ravioli each, compliments of the chef.  It was delicious!  The sauce was amazing and the pasta was cooked just right.  Next followed our main course and sides.  We both ordered the petite filet mignon.  I ordered my medium and my date ordered his medium rare.  I wish I had ordered my own medium rare after it was delivered. I expect medium to be red in the center with no blood running when you cut it. I had no red in my filet; it slightly pink in the very center.  I didn't bother to send it back, as it was still edible and I didn't want to wait for my waiter to return.  My date had medium rare and it was cooked exactly what I thought my medium was going to be.  (Thinking medium rare would have blood running out when cut in half.)  However, I would recommend you have a temperature discussion with your waiter if you want to make sure your meat is cooked as you expect it to be.For sides, we had the lobster mac and cheese and the sautéed spinach.  The lobster mac and cheese, I highly recommend, even with the $23 price tag! (They initially delivered the wrong mac and cheese, but quickly replaced it with the lobster mac when we were able to flag down the waiter.)I will note that while it was sometimes difficult to get the waiter's attention (lastly even just getting the check I had to wave my arm around several times before he finally noticed.  Meanwhile my date had already gone to the restroom and collected our things from coat check.)  At first it seemed like he was giving us space for a romantic evening, but then it was just annoying.  The men who delivered the food and filled the water were great.  They also helped us flag down our waiter. The waiter was just going through the motions however.  Mostly efficient, but not personable or checking to see if we had what we needed.Dessert was amazing.  We had little bites of cheesecakes, cream puffs, tiramisu and other yummy options.  The cheesecake and tiramisu were my favorites.Ambiance was nice, there was a lit candle at every table, slightly dim room nights lights, a piano player strumming out tunes and mural on one wall of art deco figures side by side, like a human skyline.  I would definitely recommend the restaurant and plan to go there again.  Next time I'll order oysters, petite filet mignon (medium rare), lobster mac and cheese, spinach and see what ravioli the chef might be sending my way.",1,0,0,Tanika M.,"New York, NY",242,16,1

Needless to say, we lost our appetites after this. The owner did thankfully comp our meal and drinks, but that was after I approached him and complained. As for the food, the bacon was rubbery, the brussel sprouts were soggy (not at all crispy like the menu says, and it says they come with pancetta which they did not), and the NY strip was mediocre.

The wine list is extensive and, I'm happy to say, includes several selections under $40 which I have found is unusual in a Manhattan ""fine dining"" establishments. The steaks are delicious and the portion of many of the cuts is adequate for sharing. Especially if you also select a couple of sides to share as well. The steaks were cooked exactly as requested and were very flavorful. The owner stopped by, mentioned that he recalled us from last year and thanked us for returning.

We ordered off the restaurant week menu which was super affordable ($42 for an appetizer, entree, side, and a dessert). They have a spot on the wine menu called ""30 under $30"" where they have 30 bottles of wine that cost less than $30 which is so hard to find in NY and very appreciated. Our server was awesome. He was so nice and attentive. He heard my mom mention it was my birthday and came by - after we had already had dessert - with a piece of cake and a candle. They also took our picture and printed it for us as a keepsake. It was such a sweet gesture! The restaurant itself is large and spacious. It was busy so you didn't feel like the only people there but it also wasn't so packed that you felt like you should leave so they can turn over the table quickly. It also isn't particularly loud so you can actually hear the conversation you're having. The ambience is very old world, in a great way.

The staff were very welcoming and accommodating. We came with a group of 10, and they seated us in one of their private party rooms without charge (It even had a TV in there, which they offered to put on for us, so the boys wouldn't miss the basketball game). Last but not least, they gave us a complimentary photo to commemorate the occasion. The food however, I felt was not up to par with the rest of the NYC steakhouses. Everything was okay--the calamari, the filet mignon, and the sides.  The steak tartare was probably the best dish out of everything, but didn't knock my socks off. The complimentary popovers did not taste neither warm, nor fresh--leading me to believe that they may have been baked earlier in the day to save time.The homemade cream puffs were a little soggy, and tasteless, and  I think it would help Lincoln Square Steak to hire a better pastry chef--this would bump my rating up to a 4.

I had the steak tartare, filet, whipped potatoes and cheesecake. The tartare didn't look great but tasted really good. The steak was on the medium rare side (I asked for rare). Normally I would've asked for it to be redone, but the restaurant was really busy and I felt bad. The steak was good, but I've had better. The mashed potatoes were good. The cheesecake wasn't done defrosting - both of us thought it was a bit on the frozen side. If I were paying full price, I would've switched to something else. It was good cheesecake, but nothing special. My sister had the fried calamari, salmon, mac and cheese and cheesecake. She liked her meal a lot. I also really liked the salmon and the wilted spinach that it came with. Very tasty. I'm not a fan of fried stuff, but the calamari was well done. She also thought the cheesecake was too sweet in addition to being too cold, but for me the sweetness level was fine. All in all, we had a good meal for an amazing price.

A few minutes later, a server brought us a complimentary decadent dessert of chocolate mousse and vanilla ice cream with ""Congratulations"" spelled out in chocolate on the plate.

After we asked, they also brought the béarnaise, which was the best sauce along with the peppercorn. The sides, which run just under $10 each, were tasty.The sommelier was good, and he was genuine when he suggested the cheapest Bordeaux by the bottle. IT was a great wine and compliment to the meal. On the house was a delicious mushroom ravioli and a dessert platter of tiramisu, carrot cake, and profiteroles. (I assume they had desserts leftover from the concurrent restaurant week.) The ravioli was nice and hearty, and the desserts were great. The tiramisu was definitely my favorite.But, yeah, the service was weird.

To start, I was impressed by the wine selection, I was worried we were going to have simply a ""red or white"" choice since it was pre-purchased, but there were a handful of each type of wine to choose from (and a much larger selection if you're going in without a Groupon).  We went with a Malbec, which didn't disappoint. The atmosphere is upscale and very unhurried, they want you to enjoy your dining experience (dress up a bit if you go).  Bread was served before the first course, and was light and eggy in a pleasant way. I chose the Caesar salad, filet minon, truffle-infused creamed spinach, and cheesecake; my boyfriend went with the house/greens salad, hanger steak, whipped potatoes, and cream puffs, so we were able to try a bit of everything. The Caesar salad was incredible, very classic and well-balanced/light. We both ordered our meat entrees medium-rare: his came out so rare he couldn't eat part of it, while mine was delivered medium-well (a bit disappointing, I expect a steakhouse to know steak). Cream puffs were light and not overwhelmingly sweet. Cheesecake was ok but not worth ordering again. Overall, I enjoyed the experience and the food and would return, my boyfriend is a bit harsher a food critic and wasn't impressed.

My favorite side is the creamed spinach, but you can't go wrong with any of them. They have a price fixed menu for a block of time each night. It included a chocolate cake that was literally one of the best I've ever had (and I eat a lot of chocolate cake.) Service is always the best. They took care of my dad on his birthday. I can't recommend this place enough!",0,0,0,Brad H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0
5.0,1/17/2017,". Oh, what a night!! Lincoln Square Steak is an AMAZING restaurant! It is the perfect restaurant for a romantic dinner out - Such beautiful decor with red walls, gorgeous light fixtures and chandeliers. On each table were fresh roses and lit candles with nice romantic music playing in the background. It doesn't get any better than this, folks!  My husband and I were looking forward to a nice date out (from the kids) and we had just attended and enjoyed the Shen Yun show at Lincoln Center on Saturday night (1/14/17). I'd chosen Lincoln Square Steak based on my web search for ""Top Restaurants near Lincoln Center"", and trust me, it is a TOP restaurant - so classy. The food was amazing - we both had the Price Fixe meal @ $42 each, which includes appetizer, entrée and dessert. My husband had lentil soup, I had French onion soup; Then, we both had salmon - I had creamed spinach, my husband had a baked potato (Note, the salmon also comes with a small bed of spinach already, so unless you LOVE LOVE LOVE spinach, I would recommend that you order a different side dish);  The biggest surprise of the night was when our waiter came to our table with (get this)...a complimentary dessert sampler ! OMG!! How amazing!! I can't say enough about our above-amazing experience here! Oh, yeah, and if you're into checking the bathrooms (I always am), you will LOVE the bathrooms here. Even THEY are romantic and beautiful, too!! My husband and I did meet the owner, Bruno, who was such a gentleman. Bruno, you and your staff are to be congratulated. You've got a wonderful restaurant and my husband and I wish you many years of success!",0,0,0,Shevon M.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",0,1,0
5.0,1/16/2017,"I have no idea why I did not take pictures of my food. Everything was spot on and my server at the bar, Milan, was on point. I started with a coke (boring, yes, I know) and then I was persuaded to try the thick cut sizzling Canadian bacon. That thing looked like a foot long snake on fire!! It was incredible. I know every big steakhouse in the city is doing TCB as an appetizer but I have only had it here and I am just saying, it was incredible. Moist, fatty where fat needed to be, and the pork flavor was screaming from the pores of this massive slab of meat. The Ceasar salad was nothing special. Most steakhouses tend to have underwhelming Ceasars IMHO. But the rib eye took center stage here. I asked for it slightly more cooked than medium and it was done so to my specifications. Some pink, not a lot of grey. Perfect! The portion was mammoth. I am 6 ft 2 inches and 270 pouds. I took more than half of it to go. Great beef flavor, delivered at a nice temperature. The side of mushrooms were ridiculous! Ridiculously good! I ask you, how can you eat a steak without sauteed mushrooms?  These were so delicate and buttery. A  pleasant pairing with my ribeye. I also had the sauteed spinach. This was very good as well. I ended with the chocolate cake. At places like this, I think they do not go out of their way to put any kind of spotlight on their desserts. It was a chocolate cake. Enough said. Overall, this was a great dining experience and I am very eager to explore the menu in greater depth.",1,0,0,Hillenbrand H.,"Summit, NJ",15,85,564

4.0,1/11/2017,"To start off, service was amazing. I made a reservation online but realized in the fine print of the Groupon that it was phone reservations only. I called to inform them the same they. The lady was super accommodating. Once we got there, there was no wait and we were seated right away. Our waiters were very friendly and attentive. The fried calamari was okay, but rather tasteless for my liking. It did come with marinara but it would've been nice if it were seasoned. The slab of bacon was super fatty, a little soggy but none the less good. The whipped potato was nothing special. Tasted fresh but also like soemthing made from powder. The mac and cheese was good but underseasoned. We both ordered steaks medium rare (steak and filet mignon) but they came out to be more like medium. The outside of mine was slightly too overcooked so it was very tough and stuck to your teeth. Dessert was the only real complaint I have. It was just not good. The tiramisu was ok, but the middle part was way too runny and watery so when you bit into it the texture was weird and a lot of espresso bursted out. Cream puffs were a bit hard rather than airy, but the cream was good. The cheesecake was just a no. Just no good. And I even like cheesecakes from Costco, but this was just bad.",2,1,1,Alice Z.,"New York, NY",404,238,834

Lincoln Square Steak has a mature, professional and knowledge staff that works hard to take care of your guests and you. Then, comes the best part of the restaurant; its food. We ordered Prime NY Strips that were perfectly cooked and delicious. We also ordered the LSS Seafood Platter. All I can say is, Wow! It has a half lobster, crab meat, oysters and clams. This platter is not only delicious, but it is also a great value. And, we also ordered the Roasted Chilean Sea Bass. It was perfectly seared and delicious. As a wonderful surprise, we were treated to a delicious selection of complementary desserts. The Tiramisu, the Carrot Cake and the New York Style Cheesecake were, oh so delicious.

The ambiance, is cozy and with touches of both feminine and masculine tastes. The food, I wouldn't use any word short of, ""Martian"" (Mars, the planet) because it is out of this world. Bruno, the owner, more like the uncle you love to visit for Sunday dinners because he makes you feel so at home, so welcome; has accommodated my husband and I each and every time, going above and beyond.

Filet could have been done better but still enjoyed the meal.With regards to the services and hospitality, maybe I had set my expectations way too high, it just wasn't there. Don't know if the server was just having a cranky day but he was missing half of the time, no one came to ask if we were doing okay, wine glasses were empty half of the time, it all seemed as if no one cared if we had a good time or not.

But I wanted to at least share with fellow yelpers about our awesome experience we had at this steakhouse! Got reservations in the day of. Arrived and seated at a great table right by the wine keep. One thing I hate about steakhouses (or any fancy-shmancy place) is eating in the dark. This place was still romantic with good lighting to see my food! I loved the red walls and old time vibe. The apps were delicious. We had the scallops and Caesar salad. The 24 oz ribeye was cooked perfectly and more then enough for me and my girlfriend to share. It was my girlfriends birthday and they surely made her feel special! The waiter was kind, prompt and very accommodating. The owner Bruno even came around to thank us.

They brought once I finished my steak and it was cold and under cooked. 5. Order parfait for dessert.  Told at end of meal they did not have a parfait tonight (same as last visit).  They brought store bought, stale, bad cheesecake. 6.

The staff was extremely attentive throughout the entire meal,  coming over to refill our champagne glasses when they were not even half empty. The food was delicious - we actually had the Groupon menu, which is a phenomenal deal for 3 courses, plus a bottle of wine! We were also brought a special porcini mushroom dish as an added bonus in between courses.

4.0,9/20/2016,"Bought the Groupon, and it was totally worth the $89.00 (+ $9.00 tax). It was a three course meal with a complementary bottle of wine under $30. It doesn't get any better than that.The only thing they lose a star for is their bland, overcooked pork chops. It was tougher than any piece of meat I have ever been served. I couldn't even stick my knife through it. Also, our server wasn't the best. He disappeared often, and took forever to fire our food. The manager had to come over several times to accommodate us, which made me feel bad, because that puts the server in a bad position. I know, because I have been in the customer service industry for over 5 years, so having done that, I had to tip over 20%. Definitely was not well deserved on his part.Going back to the food, my boyfriend's filet was HEAVENLY. It didn't even need the au poivre sauce. I wish I had gotten that instead of the pork chops. Don't even get me started on their cheesecake. I'm drooling just thinking about it.4/5",4,0,1,Winnie C.,"Queens, NY",0,3,1

We ordered the ribeye (med rare) to share cause we were already pretty stuffed from the seafood tower, but we weren't going to not get a steak; that'd be preposterous. For sides, we ordered mashed potatoes, creamed spinach and charred Brussels sprouts.

I decided to write a review because this place by far is becoming our family's favorite restaurant! We came here many times with my husband and maybe four times with our big family, since we discovered their beautiful private rooms that fit bigger parties. The ambience with the live piano is awesome! Food: we were a party of 10 so we shared some appetizers: the steak tartar, Canadian bacon, fried calamari, Cesar salad, caprese, and I had their yummy onion soup. Everything was great and enough for all of us to share. For entrees I had lamb chops and my hubby a sirloin steak. Both juicy and cooked perfectly medium rare! I so recommend the creamed spinach for sides, soo delicious and not too creamy. We had other yummy sides for the table: sautéed broccoli, mac & cheese (so good too), asparagus, and baked potatoes. We really enjoyed our dinner and we will always come back because this place always meets all our expectations.

3.0,8/10/2016,"*Restarurant Week + Porterhouse Steak Review*I came on a Sunday night with a fairly large group, 7 of us. I have to say, this restaurant is very very red, lighting, decorations, everything was so red. The lighting inside was dim, perfect for the itis after eating a huge meal. All of us ordered different things off the RW menu, and my friends also got the porterhouse steak for 2.  Before I get into the review of the food, I must say the bread they give us, is some great bread.  I personally got the slab of bacon, hanger steak with broccoli as a side. Bacon was 100%, the piece they gave me was the perfect layer of fat, bacon, fat, bacon.  I was utterly amazed. I've had bacon at other steakhouses and this was one of the best pieces I've tried.  Hanger steak, was seasoned very well. It was a bit tough, but I honestly did not mind it, as hanger steak is supposed to be tougher and is not a tender cut.  But I have to say, the side of broccoli was the highlight of my night.  The porterhouse for 2 (49$pp), was a huge and way more than enough for two people.  It was cooked and presented perfectly. The steak was so very tender, however I thought the steak itself could've used a bit more seasoning.  We also had the calamari as a starter, it was good, very simple calarami, can't complain. The salmon was also cooked very well.  Truffle mac and cheese just tasted like basic mac and cheese, and couldve used a hint of salt.  They gave dessert enough for the whole table, but only the tiramisu stood out, and the chocolate fudge cake (?).  Overall, a solid dinner.  Service was good, and waters were refilled.  I did notice other tables that ordered wine/alcohol had it served in these gorgeous glass vases.  They were all different per table, and I thought that was super unique.",2,0,1,Lisa T.,"New York, NY",55,144,894

5.0,8/6/2016,"*Restaurant week*Wining and dining with a pianist playing in the front.   Top notch service. Very interactive with their guests. Not to mention everyone looked striking. Complimentary cotton candy and memorable photo taken by the owner and card signed by him. Was told it was a fairly new restaurant. The sommelier was knowledgeable when it came to wine and recommended us a great one made by a women in Argentina. He poured it in a decanter shaped like a snakes tail and it was interesting to watch. The staff had excellent attitude and treated everyone very nicely. The interior had an interesting contemporary yet traditional design feel to the place. Okay now on to the food. I was here for restaurant week with a group of friends. I started off with steak tartare, brook trout as my entree, and ended it off with a tiramisu. The portions didn't look that much but it was just right and left everyone satisfied. Only thing I suggest was that they could have done a better job at plating. A bland piece of steak on a white dish doesn't scream ""Eat me, I look delicious!"". Although the brook trout with a side of cream spinach was tasty and had a nice presentation. I was a bit scared of trying the steak tartare but surprisingly it wasn't that bad. Sort of reminds me of sashimi. I'm glad I didn't have a stomachache after eating raw meat since it's usually very sensitive. Tried a piece of Canadian bacon and I almost died in heaven. Omg I wish I ordered that as my appetizer. Ugh so juicy and charred just right! The filet mignon was tender and good as well. Hanger steak was served cut up in slices. Each slice had a bit of crisp on the outside and juice on the inside. It was done medium rare. Nothing special about the calamari  and herb fries. The tiramisu tasted pretty decent and was plated nicely. The cotton candy was a nice gesture for kids as well as the take away photo cards. I do say this restaurant will leave you with a fun and memorable experience. All the elements surprisingly worked together. I've had better food but the service definitely trumps it all. Therefore, I give them 4.5 stars for overall but yelp doesn't have that option so I am bumping them up because I feel like if it wasn't for high demands during restaurant week they would deserve it.

There is something about the way the meat was cooked that I personally didn't like it a lot. I gave 5 stars though because I am not sure if that is something related with the Dry Age meat.

2.0,7/10/2016,"Unfortunately, I can't rate this restaurant A-Ok because I have experienced and was expecting better. First impressions, the decor is really nice and the personnel very professional and friendly, but not in a stuffy way. I felt like I had gone into a time capsule and was experiencing Mad Men NY. The oysters didn't taste very fresh, were not properly shucked and were large. The tuna tartare tasted like ceviche, it was drenched in lemon juice and was just a large pile of roughly chopped tuna. The mushroom ravioli we got between courses, on the house, actually tasted good.   The fillet mignon and short ribs were both not consistently done. The shape of the filet mignon was completely warped, it looked like two different pieces of meat held together by some connective tissue, so maybe the end of the tenderloin, or / and something. Not the nice, uniform medaillon I was expecting. When you have an uneven cut like that you're not going to achieve a medium rare across the board. I was very disappointed. The tomato and onion appetizer I got as a side was cut into overly thick slices. All in all, I would say the food was lacking finesse. Small changes would go a long way here. To finish we were offered a plate of sweets, on the house. I really appreciate this old fashioned type of hospitality. I can't overlook the issues with the food, however.Note the number of rave 5 star reviews by people with very few or just 1 review to their name.",3,0,0,Tammy O.,"New York, NY",20,129,13

Love that you get to sit and enjoy what you are paying for and not pushed out of the door.I got the steak and it was delish. Not many steak houses of note in the UWS so this one has to stand up as one of the best. If you are in the neighborhood I highly recommend coming for an intimate evening or a fun evening with friends. This one needs stay. And that is why this is my first ever Yelp review. Also, Bruno (the owner) was so kind to come talk with us and have our moment photographed at the end. Another nice touch. He's a great owner that really cares about the place and the customer experience and I look forward to coming back again to this great addition to the neighborhood.",1,1,1,Jason L.,"Queens, NY",40,4,0
4.0,6/23/2016,"I went here for my three-year anniversary with my boyfriend. I made the reservation online and added a comment that it was our anniversary dinner and we were looking forward to dining at their restaurant. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. They gave us a quiet booth away from other guests, we received menus that said ""Happy Anniversary"" on the front, they constantly congratulated us, and at the end gave us a free dessert (in addition to the ones we already ordered with the prefixe menu). As for the food itself, I really enjoyed it. As I mentioned, we ordered off the prefixe menu, so it came with an appetizer, entree, and dessert for $39 each. I was anticipating the servings to be much smaller, but we still received large portions even at the smaller price tag. (Score!) It was worth it; pricey, but a great deal for NYC. For appetizers we had the mixed green salad (just OK) and the sizzling canadian bacon (it was a large strip-like piece of bacon, very fatty, but had a nice caramelization). For the entree the my boyfriend had the half chicken and he said it was good, while I got the petite filet mignon - it was very tender and had a nice char on the outside edges. For sides we had french fries (a HUGE serving in a pasta bowl) and a baked potato (again a HUGE serving -- a large Idaho potato, which came with sour cream on the side). For dessert the cheesecake and chocolate cake (more mousse than cake) were delicious. And I believe the extra dessert they gave us was the other prefixe option, which was the vanilla creme parfait. I only had a couple of bites because I was so full, but it was good as well -- sweet, but not too over the top -- and there was a nice caramelization on top with some brown sugar crumbles.On the down side, service was slow at times, and they failed to offer us refills/stop by the table regularly after the entree was served. I enjoyed the experience, and would recommend anyone to try it at least once -- especially on the prefixe menu since it doesn't blow your budget out of the water completely.",1,1,1,Kaitlyn W.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",82,2,6

Apparently, I was wrong. It's OK though I would have paid for it but the owner was nice enough to waive it for us. Little things like that can make your special occasion feel more special.  Bruno, the owner, walks around paying a visit to every table and you can tell he really cares about customer satisfaction.

5.0,6/11/2016,"What a very welcoming and accommodating establishment. After a long, difficult day at a New York hospital, this was the perfect remedy. Upon entering, we were greeted enthusiastically and sincerely. Because of my friends affliction, they had to be very considerate in getting us sat. They kindly gave us a great table which certainly could have been used for a large party. And they became busy enough where they could have used it. But they chose to accommodate us instead.The food was spectacular. We had tuna tartare and steak tartare. Both were as fresh as the could possibly be. The seasoning was perfect. They were clearly cut and prepared to order. Not a pre-chopped sketchy rendition as which is sometimes the case. We then ordered Caesar salad , which was classically prepared and on  point. The entree porterhouse for two was of very high quality, cooked to perfection, presented expertly, and is reason alone to get in my car and drive an hour and a half anytime I want a steak. Oh, portion sizes were perfect.Service was among the best, most professional service I've experienced. The servers were knowledgeable, gracious, non-obtrusive, and prompt. They were always there when you needed them, but not hanging over us. In other words, they were pros. Seeing that we most likely had a very trying day, they made us a complimentary chocolate soufflé for dessert. We asked for the dessert menu, so they knew we were most likely ordering it anyway. However, just because they are nice people, they bought us dessert anyway. The gesture was appreciated and certainly shows they are in the hospitality business because they are into it.

5.0,6/11/2016,"This is my first and probably only yelp review. This restaurant deserves more than 5 stars, if I could I could give them 50 I would. I came here yesterday for my boyfriends birthday and it was the greatest dining experience of my life. I was early for my reservation by 20 minutes and they sat me immediately. The entire place is just gorgeous, and the servers are so friendly. We started with drinks, champagne and a bottle of wine. Definitely one of the best glasses of champagne I've ever had. We ordered appetizers and they brought over free popovers which were delicious and soft. The calamari was incredible, my boyfriend ordered it and although I'm not a fan of it usually I thought it was pretty great. They brought over free mushroom ravioli before the main corse which was great. At this paint I was wondering how on earth I was going to eat a steak after all of that food. Then they brought out dinner and it was just AMAZING. First of all two server bring out your steak on a sizzling cast iron plate, and then proceed to serve it to you piece by piece by heating it up on the edge of the plate and placing it beautifully on your plate. I had sautéed asparagus and my boyfriend, who is no fan of the green or leafy, had onion rings. They served up the asparagus to us and it was beautifully sautéed, still having a slight crunch but soft and not too heavily sauced. The steak was out of this world. I have never in my life had a more perfectly cooked medium rare steak. I was blown away, everything was just amazing. The onion rings were amazing, I don't like onions but they were perfectly seasoned and cooked. And then after all of THAT they brought us complimentary desserts!!! A perfect chocolate soufflé, vanilla ice cream, and the most amazing crem brûlée I have ever had in my life. We were full to the point of bursting, and though neither me nor my boyfriend are fans of sweets, we just couldn't stop eating. Everything put in front of us was cooked so perfectly that it was like they could do no wrong. Our glasses never went empty, the owner came around every so often to make sure everything was going well, and they gave us so much complimentary food that we had a nice long discussion about how this place possibly makes money. After all of that food, our bill was STILL less than $200!!! I could probably go on forever about this place but I know for certain that this place has become my go-to for any special or not so special occasion. Seriously, you've never been to a place that treats you so well and you will never find another. Oh, I almost forgot, after all of that perfection, they took our picture and gave us two cards to take home with us! I don't even know where they did that!!!

They have a wine list called 30 for 30 that has thirty wines at around $30 that had a tremendous Malbec that we would have paid much more for.

5.0,6/1/2016,"This is my FIRST YELP review, ever (and I go to a lot of restaurants) -- so that must tell you that Lincoln Square Steak is something special.We were celebrating my son's Law School Grad last night. Nothing but nice things to say.... picked the restaurant randomly and from other Yelp posts -- it fit our requirements (near Lincoln Center, accessible, & have something for everyone including an extremely picky eater).    We were a party of 10, including 3 grandparents with various health & mobility issues.  Management & Staff could not have been more accommodating, even assisting my mother in law with her walker, and up & down the 2 steps to get into the restaurant, and escorting her directly to the ladies' room.  3 of our party arrived before we did, and were escorted into a private dining room to wait for us.  They were well taken care of.  I couldn't get over the private dining room experience.  It was elegant and special, and allowed us to really talk with each other and celebrate the day.Food was delicious.  We had various salads... Wedge, Caesar, Tomato & Mozzarella, and Chopped.  We had lamb chops, a veal chop, braised short ribs, Filet Mignon and strip steaks, all either medium or medium rare... and each dish came out perfectly prepared.  Not one complaint.  We shared a variety of side dishes -- spinach, asparagus, mac & cheese, brussel sprouts, onion rings -- all delicious.  And when mother in law couldn't decide between steamed or sauteed spinach, they split the order and brought some of each!  And those pop-overs!!!! the best ever!!!Bruno came in and chatted with us several times, asking where we were all from, figuring out the relationships among us.  Seemed like he really was interested in his guests.  We were given complimentary ravioli, (yum), and although I had ordered a celebration dessert for my son (just a 1 serving chocolate souffle), we were treated to 2 platters of individual pastries & cakes with our coffees.  The hostess came in and took a couple of group photos -- I expected her to ask for my email to send them, but a few minutes later, she returned and gave my son and me each a copy in a folio.  When she heard me say that I'd scan it and send to the grandmas, she returned with copies for them as well!  So thoughtful. Expensive?  Sure.  Very!  But so worth it for a special event celebration!Thank you Bruno -- you and your staff capped off an amazing day for us in an amazing way.",6,1,1,Robin A.,"Dobbs Ferry, NY",0,2,0

5.0,5/27/2016,"Food coma.check.excellent service. Check. Good food. Check. Booked this place last minute (literally 2 hrs before dinner time) for a party of 8 on a Thursday evening. Ordered all different kinds of cuts of steak and lamb chops and they were all cooked nicely.Porterhouse for 3...one of us wanted it cooked medium. The other 2 wanted it medium rare. The porterhouse steak is usually served in 1 large plate regardless of number of persons, but since we had different cooking preferences, the kitchen was kind enough to cook the single medium separately from the other 2 medium rares. I had the medium rare and my first bite of porterhouse was sooooo goood. The piece was warm and soft and melted in my mouth and I literally breathed out a sigh of ""woah"" even while the piece was still in my mouth . The texture was amazing. It was slightly underseasoned but still tasted good. They also had so many sauces to choose from, but I didn't use any of them so can't comment on that. Filet mignon..I never really liked filet mignon but I tried a piece from someone else's plate. It was ok. That person liked the porterhouse more too. The people who had the Ribeye and the double eagle strip steak both enjoyed their steak, but thought the double eagle was better.Someone ordered the burger and he gave it 2 thumbs up. (Couldn't talk with food in his mouth) The meat was HUGE and he said it was delicious. Might get kind of messy cuz while he was eating it, it seemed like things were falling apart. But he still really liked it. Lamb chops were also good. Cooked nicely at medium rare and good flavor.Service is absolutely amazing. Our waiter Agron was so nice and gave us whatever we asked for. They gave us complimentary mushroom ravioli and it was so good. The sauce was creamy and tasted like cream of mushroom soup. The boss came over a couple times to ask how we were doing, and even helped us take a lot of family pictures. Our glasses of water were never empty. They even gave us complimentary dessert including souffle, cream puffs, cheesecake. I had such a nice experience here.

5.0,5/26/2016,"Came here for early father's day dinner because he's going traveling next week and this place was the perfect restaurant! Had one of the BEST restaurant experience here. We had a party of 8 and we ordered the filet mignon, porterhouse for 3, the dry aged rib eye,  double eagle, the burger, and lamb chops. We were given bread for starters and it was warm,soft and tasty. While waiting for our food, they gave us each complementary mushroom ravioli, which was really good (I love mushrooms). The waiter, Agron, was really nice and helpful. We ordered the porterhouse for 3 and told him that one person wanted the porterhouse medium and 2 other wanted medium rare, he helped us solved our dilemma and gave us 1 porterhouse for 1 cooked medium and a porterhouse for 2 cooked medium rare. All of the meat we ordered were cooked exactly how we wanted and they were all delicious. Based on my preference on the taste and texture of the steaks, I liked Porterhouse more than Double Eagle more than Rib Eye. I didn't try the filet mignon but my dad said he liked the porterhouse better.Throughout the night, we never needed to ask the waiters to refill our water or try and wave a waiter down because someone was always there refilling our water before it ran out and asking how everything was and if we needed anything. When we asked for the check, they gave us free complementary desserts, which included 2 sets of chocolate soufflés with ice cream,carrot cake, tiramisu, cheesecake, and 3 chocolate cream puffs. Besides the carrot cake, I tried all of them and they were all good. The chocolate soufflé was warm, soft,moist and not overly sweet. The tiramisu had a good amount of coffee in it. The cream puffs had just the right amount of sweetness, cream, and chocolate to my liking. The owner of the restaurant was present and he was really friendly and sociable. He interacted with us and helped us take a family picture multiple times. He even used their own camera and took a pic of us and asked us how many copies we wanted of that pic (which 1 of us jokingly said 5) and he actually printed 5 of them, attached it to thank you cards and signed the cards.

2.0,5/22/2016,"There's a lot to like about this place. First the minute you walk in you notice how great the ambience is, I mean it truly is a beautiful restaurant with its crimson red decor. I hosted a large dinner program a few weeks back for my company using their private room. The program went well except for a few issues.The first issue is I was under the impression the private room would be completely isolated from noise even during dinner service. Unfortunately I was extremely unhappy about the noise level during food service as there was a presentation going on. Everytime the door opened you can hear the guests in the main room. During a quiet presentation this is really unacceptable and I wish I was told this before. Another issue is during the food service the waiters kept going in front of the presenter and distracted the whole presentation which I was also unhappy about.The food mostly was great. Guests who ordered the pan seared wild king salmon raved about it as well as the sides it came along with including the potato gratin. The issue however was this being a steakhouse they only offered 1 cut of steak (hanger steak) which is the cheapest cut. For a pre fix menu and it being a steakhouse they could have offered something like a petit mignon as a second option. The hanger steak was an issue with guests. Most really did not enjoy it. I was really unhappy with how the steak turned out.  Besides the subpar steak and lack of steak options the food was terrific Including the dessert. Staff were also very friendly and attentive to guests needs.I probably wouldnt recommend this place for a private event that requires complete quiet. The space wasn't as adequate as I had hoped and the lack of steak options was a disappointment.

Eden by the glass is breathtaking), great steak, and nice surprises on the house in between (mushroom ravioli absolutely delicious).  Easy to meet neighbors if you want to, attentive service, and attractive clientele, all ages.  If you want a perfect appetizer salad, the Caesar Salad was absolutely amazing.  They added two anchovies to the split dish I and my wife ordered.  Here is the part that impressed me though; I originally ordered the blackened swordfish as an entree, and was worried when it arrived tasting too dry and rubbery without taste.  Top notch server immediately took it back, no questions asked, and suggested the tuna instead, which turned out to be excellent.  This is a restaurant that aims to please.  Complimentary desserts and apertifs made the evening all the more memorable.  Again, top notch service all the way around.  Highly recommend.",0,0,0,Stephen S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,0

The food is consistently delicious; the complimentary breads are to die for, the chef often sends out an appetizer on the house and the ambiance is va voom!

BUT, to my pleasant surprise, and despite the crazy amount of red color, I really like this place!Great wine. Good service. The brioche bread they bring out is very unique. I had a petite filet mignon that was perfection. (also surprising how good the steak was after coming back from Argentina!). The complimentary ravioli and dessert definitely works.

5.0,4/26/2016,"Lincoln Square Steak overall score: 91My wife and I came here for our anniversary before catching a play at Lincoln Center. They had a great looking ""early bird"" price fix menu, and a solid looking selection of cuts on the regular menu. Check out the verdict below:Flavor: 9I ordered the rib eye from the dinner menu.It had a great seared crust on the outside, and a good sized fat cap around the edge. The kitchen prepared this thing spot on to medium rare, cooked perfectly.My wife went with the price fix menu deal, and chose the hanger steak. This, too, was super tender and cooked perfectly.This was pretty big for a $39 price fix deal, and it came with an app, a side and a dessert. If I had to guess, I'd say this was about 12-14oz. Great seasoning and crust on the outside. These guys really know what they're doing in the kitchen.Choice of Cuts & Quality Available: 9In addition to the rib eye and the hanger, they also offer two sizes of filet, two different strips, and varying sizes of porterhouse. Excellent showing, and most steaks are prime and dry aged.Portion Size & Plating: 8Portions are generous here. The hanger was a big size, and the rib eye felt right for the price. Plating is simple, nothing too fancy.Price: 9The prices here are comparable to midtown steakhouses, which can get steep at times, but I feel like here you are getting your money's worth. Not to mention the price fix deal for $39 is awesome.Bar: 9While the location is somewhat tucked away just west of Amsterdam on 70th street, the bar here is really fantastic. It's large and lounge-like, with high tops along the windows and a long, warm and inviting stretch of bar. I'd definitely hang out here on a non-steak night. The cocktail menu is interesting as well, with unique twists on classic bar drinks.Specials and Other Meats: 10There's a great selection of alternative meats here. If the standard cuts of beef aren't your thing for some retarded reason, you can go with lamb, veal, pork or chicken, as well as braised short rib. Great selection, and with that kind of showing of meat, they don't really need to offer any specials.Apps, Sides & Desserts: 9We started with some Bluepoint oysters and Canadian bacon; that's the way any red-blooded American should begin a steak dinner.The oysters were big, crisp and fresh. The bacon was perfectly cooked and seasoned. It went nicely with the steak sauce.The waiter brought out some ravioli for us next, compliments of the house. Mushroom cream sauce. Very tasty.For the sides, we tried both the creamed spinach and the truffle mac and cheese. Both were perfect. In fact, we actually finished both sides, which almost never happens. The spinach had that ""creamless"" texture that I love, and it packed a ton of flavor. The mac was nice and cheesy without being too heavy. The truffle flavor was definitely present and most welcomed.For dessert, we tried the cheesecake, and the staff sent out a complimentary chocolate soufflé in honor of our anniversary.I liked the cheesecake best, but the soufflé was very soft and moist inside. Nicely executed.Seafood Selection: 8There's salmon, tuna, shrimp, swordfish, branzino, sea bass and lobster on the seafood entree menu. That's amazing. While I can't give full points here until I go back and try one or two of the seafood entrees, I can attest to the oysters being top notch.Service: 10The service here is incredible. Our waiter, Nol, was very attentive, made great suggestions, and was very nice and genuine. We were greeted immediately with some specially printed up menus that said ""Happy Anniversary,"" just because my wife made a notation on the OpenTable reservation.And as you saw in the dessert section above, they comp'd a soufflé for us as well. Later on, when we got to talking more about steak, my website came up and it turns out that the manager, Bruno, knew of my endeavors here. Then even MORE stuff was comp'd.I love it when that happens!Another thing I'll note here is the great table bread: fresh baked popovers that come out nice and warm, and with soft, spreadable butter. I love that shit!Ambiance: 10This joint is truly decked out from front to back, top to bottom. It has an intimate feeling with all the red coloring going on, and for even more intimacy there are some separate dining rooms of varying sizes. Great layout with different levels. Here's a shot of the main dining room.",7,7,7,JohnnyPrimeC. C.,"Manhattan, NY",199,213,4300
5.0,4/22/2016,"I really enjoyed my experience here. The manager, Bruno, is an expert when it comes to running restaurants. If you didn't know, he also owns Club A Steakhouse which has superb reviews as well. What I particularly appreciate is the fact that he shows dedication for his place. I saw him consistently going around and making sure everyone was content. Our server was outstanding and knew the menu very well. Also, he came to the table quite frequently. The bus boys also need major credit because they work so hard here. To start, they give you a complimentary pop over which is far better than getting boring bread. We decided to pass on an appetizer, but, to my surprise, they brought out complimentary mushroom ravioli ( YUM)- it was super hot and the creamy sauce was heavenly. For our entrees, I ordered the branzino (kinda regret not going with a steak), my other guest ordered the chicken, and my one other guest ordered the prime NY strip ( best choice). I think the waiter was right when he emphasized that the place is a steakhouse. Therefore, i wish I made a better choice. Don't get me wrong, my fish was fine, but I bet they are way more focused on their steaks. As sides, we ordered the broccoli and cream spinach. I'm crazy for cream spinach and thought this one was just okay. Not as creamy as I would have liked but still good. One of the best parts of our meal was when they brought us out complimentary dessert- I believe it was tiramisu, carrot cake, and two cream puffs. Carrot cake is my absolute weakness so I had to do my best to not stuff my face. At the end of our meal, we were very pleased (and full)!",5,0,0,Christina G.,"Lincolnshire, IL",188,207,863

Our family came to Lincoln Square for the first time to celebrate our father's 71st birthday, and we will be returning for all of our future celebratory dinners. Every aspect of our dining experience was top notch. We have been to many of the top steakhouses in NYC and often times service can feel like a secondary priority. At Lincoln, service is clearly a top priority. We were made to feel special. Their attention to detail and their concern for our comfort was clear from the minute we walked through the door. Their very genuine and friendly staff immediately took care of our every request. We had two young children with us and the staff made sure the kids had a fun time. The food was exquisite. The porterhouse for 2 and the filets came out at the perfect temperature. The steak was unparalleled. The one fish eater at our table, known to be a little picky, raved about her salmon. All of the side dishes were plentiful and the perfect compliment to our meals. Dessert was rich!

5.0,3/27/2016,"Went there this past Friday for my roommate's birthday dinner celebration. There were five of us and to a person, we each could not stop raving about how much fun we had, being pampered and fed the best food north of Columbus Circle (maybe south of it, too). We ordered the Porterhouse, for 3, chicken parm (serves 2), two sides of veggies, and a side of Mac n cheese. It was plenty of food for the five of us. Everything was prepared to perfection. The chicken parm was tender and delicious, while the steak melted in my mouth. But I got ahead of myself... before the culinary fireworks officially started, they bring you amazing popovers in which to delight. Did I mention the service? Our server was professional, knowledgeable, friendly, and fun. When I snuck over to the hostess station to request that they place a candle, in whichever dessert my roommate ordered, little did I know that they would bring us every dessert on the menu, with a candle, ON THE HOUSE! When a hostess came over and asked if we would like her to take a group picture, with her camera, little did I know that the owner would come over two minutes later,, with two lovely signed birthday cards, containing out picture. It made the birthday girl's night. Before we were through, we received a guided tour of this large, beautiful restaurant, and its various, themed private rooms. The place is just fabulous in its taste and detail. Thank you, to Bruno (owner), and his staff, for a perfect dinner experience. I will definitely be seeing you regularly.

When the main diner arrived the steak ( my son) was raw instead of medium my hamburger was medium instead of rare, I ordered on salad so no possibility of a mix up my husband was raw instead of medium rare.

Lincoln Square is my favorite place in NYC for steak (and Ive been to all of the many great steak houses in NY) and I am very fortunate that it popped up in my backyard.  Tonight I took my oldest son and family there for his 16th Birthday.  We reserved the blue private dining room (seats 5-7) and it was amazing.  It was the kid's first experience with private dining and they loved it.  They loved it because the staff, all the staff, made us felt like we belonged there.    I cannot say enough about Luis and all the people who made our experience what it was. I had my own birthday celebration with close friends back in October in the larger red room which was amazing in it's own right. Bruno just cannot be more hospitable.  They took a nice group picture of us and then showed up with a print of it in a nice little fold.  A memory my sons surely will keep with him for a very long time.  I have sent many people here and I know I am sending them to a place where they'll be taken care of which is a great feeling when they come back and rave about it.  Thank you to Bruno and staff for such a wonderful and memorable night.  I'll see you soon!",4,2,3,Eric M.,"Manhattan, NY",3,6,4

The popover was fine at best, the bacon was deliciously predictable, the steak tartare was riddled with red onion. The porterhouse for two was cooked to perfection but the taste was ordinary and at most third best to other NYC steakhouses. The potato gratin was a baked potato dripping in a cream like substance (very thin, with bad legs), and the truffle Mac and cheese was boring. Overall it was fine but I don't need to go back.",2,0,0,Kim K.,"Manhattan, NY",2,7,0

1.0,2/22/2016,"I was really disappointed in this restaurant. We selected it for our date night based on all of the good reviews and I regret our choice. First, the positives: the decor is classic and charming and our water glasses were always promptly filled and they brought a yummy dessert sampling. Sadly, these are the only nice things I can say. It took over 20 minutes for our drink order to be placed and our order to be taken. We had no idea who our waiter was. He took our order and we didn't see him again until the bill came. Would have loved to order a second drink, but nobody came around. I ordered my filet medium well and it was charred and chewy and I didn't eat half of it, but nobody came to ask how things were so I didn't have a chance to complain. My husband ordered his medium and is was nearly rare (plate filled with blood). The difference between medium and medium well should not be charred vs. bleeding.  Ironically, as we were waiting for our food, a man who was either the owner or manager was checking in with the couple next to us and they told him this was the most amazing meal, he signed something for them, etc.  I would have liked to share my experience if someone came to ask! We hadn't yet had our food at that point, so we were excited to get our steaks and then disappointed in the poor quality. I hate to judge on one experience, but when you're paying for a sitter and paying over $125 dollars for a meal, it should be good-it should be better than a steak you can get at a chain restaurant. I can tell you there are many better places to eat in the city and this is not a place I can recommend,",4,0,0,K M.,"Plantsville, CT",0,51,5

I have dined at the best steakhouses across this country because I have to travel for work.  It was our kids ski week so I decided to take the family to the big apple our family favorite destination. Home is a little boring.  From the minute my family arrived at Lincoln square steakhouse LSS we were greeted as family.  Best service, great steaks, surprise dessert for my sons birthday, felt like an army of severs just serving on us.  Ended with Bruno taking a family photo for us with his camera.  Been to NYC many times this was the best.  First, last only review I ever plan on giving.  Bruno thanks for the great time.  Will see you in 4 weeks when I take my sister to LSS!",4,0,0,Brad K.,"Irvine Business Complex, CA",0,3,0

We went there on Valentines day and it felt like real industry, you get in, soon you get your meal, and sooner you get out... Waiters were nice but acting like flies without head flying annoyingly around the tables all the time. The meat was over grilled outside, and it was one of the worst filet mignons I've had. Also the tip (gratuity) is obligatory and they just put the 23% amount on the top od the bill, they don't let you decide wether you'll give a tip and if so, how much... Very rude!

5.0,2/17/2016,"Awesome all around Steakhouse from the food to the décor they hit a home run with this place. We made a reservation for 7:45PM on a Saturday night. When we arrived we were told we were required to check our coats which was ok by us. We were seated promptly and asked whether we would like still or sparkling water. Apparently they make their own sparkling water (seltzer) so there isn't any water upselling. My wife ordered one of their specialty cocktails Killing Time - Ron Zacapa 23yr, Campari, Lime Juice, Pineapple Syrup she said it was absolutely delicious and strong (good thing). I had a Lagavulin 16 scotch neat standard pour standard price for a place of this type. We were each given a piece of this pastry puff type bread that was ridiculous. Normally try to not eat the bread but we could not contain ourselves. We ordered the Scallops which was probably one of the best preparations of scallops I have ever had. We split the 3rd scallop and yes they give you 3. I mention this because the couple sitting next to us declined to order it b/c they read on yelp that they only give you 2. This dish was so well prepared that I would reorder it even if they only gave you 1. We also ordered the Bacon and argued about who had the bigger half, it's also a must order. We ordered the Porterhouse for 2 medium rare which was cooked to perfection and perfect as is. Along with the Brussels Sprouts which were great and the Lobster Mac & Cheese of which we were not impressed with and would not order again.They gave us a free (always good) sampler of the desserts, cream puff, cheese cake & tiramisu and they were very good. Just want to add the service is very attentive without being over bearing. Good all around job and will return to try all of the appetizer's and sides.",5,1,1,John B.,"Manhattan, NY",67,92,159
5.0,2/16/2016,"I make it out to NYC once a year and always try a new steakhouse each time.  Last year we went to Del Frisco's and was very disappointed in our steak.  This year, we decided check out LSS based on the Yelp reviews.As soon as we got there, we did their pint of beer + 6 oysters for $12 deal (Valid 5-7 I believe) and it was great!  Such a deal.We then ordered the Calamari, Crab Appetizer, and 2 orders of Bacon.  All of them were excellent and fairly priced.Now here's where things get interesting....Shortly after I ordered the Rib Eye (same as my father) we received an email that our flight scheduled for later that night was canceled.  Obviously this a was a huge bummer for us.  As we waited for our steaks to arrive, the owner came by and started to chat with us for a little bit.  We told him how we were in town for the Toy Fair and mentioned we just found out our  flight was canceled.  Moments later, two complimentary mushroom raviolis were placed in front of us which was a very nice gesture by the owner.  Then our steaks came and they were very satisfying.  Vastly superior to one's we had at Del Frisco's - less expensive too.  LSS' had a nice char and great taste.  We came in with high expectations and LSS delivered.Here's where it gets better...As soon as our steaks were taken away, two dessert plates were placed in front of us.  Our server brought out a dessert platter - compliments of the owner.  Yes, a platter.  Cheesecake, cream puffs, and tiramisu.  All were very delicious.Then the owner came by again and said he's going to buy our last round of drinks!  We took him up on this offer.  He went above and beyond trying to give us a great experience despite the flight cancellation - and he succeeded. By the end of the meal we didn't even care about our canceled flight because of how well Bruno took care of my father and I.  It was truly a remarkable gesture of kindness and generosity that will be remembered for quite some time.I've never seen so many reviews that mention how awesome the owner is prior to coming here.  Now I know first hand.  NYC has a ton of great steakhouses, but you will not be disappointed coming here.  Ambiance, service, quality steak, and fair prices.  I don't think we'll go to any other NYC Steakhouses than LSS from now on.Thanks again Bruno!!",6,3,4,Mike S.,"Buffalo, NY",23,33,11
5.0,2/15/2016,"If I could give them more stars, I would. My boyfriend and I went there on Valentine's Day (which, as we mentioned, is also our anniversary) since it had the best reviews of steakhouses in Manhattan. Their Valentine's menu was a prix-fixe of three courses, plus a champagne toast. We ordered a bottle of wine but had our champagne first, so they decanted our wine while we had our champagne and brioche. We split the Canadian bacon and green salad for our apps, then had the hangar steak and filet mignon with mashed potatoes, and assorted dessert course. Everything exceeded the expectations set by the reviews I saw online.What really made the experience was how attentive our service was, and how they helped us celebrate our anniversary--an additional champagne toast, a chocolate souffle, pistachio ice cream, and port. Our server, Farouq, was attentive without ever making us feel rushed, which we really appreciated as Valentine's is such a busy night (we were there for a few hours). The owner Bruno stopped by a few times and even took our photo and printed it as a memento for the night. We asked for boxes for our leftover steaks and they sent them to coat check so they wouldn't crowd our table.Cannot recommend this place enough for anyone looking to celebrate.

3.0,2/15/2016,"My husband and I went here for Valentine's Day 2016...one word to sum up the experience - Overpriced! They would not let us order from the main menu, but I don't know how the Canadian bacon, 14oz NY strip, side (creamed spinach) and dessert (small portions of puff, tiramisu, and cheesecake) could have amounted to $95 per person. The ambience was nice, but our steaks were just okay, a little bit too done for my medium well preference. For $95, they could have offered the rib eye or porterhouse as well. The popovers were also not warm, and tasted like it's been sitting out for a while. I have definitely dined at a better steakhouse in NYC for much less.

While we were waiting we emerge treated to a delicious homemade bread and a sample of the mushroom ravioli, also delicious. The porterhouse was cooked perfectly and delicious. Spinach was the best I have had in a steakhouse so far and I love the fact that it was not overly creamy. Potato gratin were very nice also. My wife loved the truffle Mac and cheese. We were not going to have a desert because the meal was enough but another surprise, a chocolate soufflé to share with a happy anniversary message on the plate along with a nice photo keepsake from the manager.

The ambiance wasn't really my style- lacking the rustic charm of a traditional steakhouse, but a little too 90's wanna-be-swanky-mixed-with-zen, to be considered contemporary or trendy. The music was an odd smooth jazz/elevator type sound. It just seemed very 90's to me. The restaurant was near empty when we arrived, and it took quite awhile to simply get a wine list while many if the staff stood around. Beyond this, everything was pretty good. Our server- I forget his name but his accent sounded Eastern European - was very sweet and accommodating. My mom's filet was phenomenal. The steak tartare was good, but could have used a bit more flavoring-capers, dijon, etc. Regardless, it hit the spot for me. We ordered a chocolate dessert of some sort and much to our surprise, it's delivery was accompanied by a creme brûlée, compliments of the chef; surprising seeing as we didn't spend much more than $100 on two people. It was a very kind gesture, although the creme brûlée was a little runny. Overall, I would come back for the steak tartare as a snack if I were in the neighborhood and craving it.

Owner came by table twice and brought kids cotton candy. Martini is one of the best I've had.  NY strip was very good. Hanger steak was as well. Creamed spinach.  Cons:  don't recommend ribeye, over aged and lack of fat made it tasteless. Potato Gratin was undercooked and Truffle Mac n Cheese was underwhelming.  Overall I would go again and try the filet. Great atmosphere and worth going to, just won't get ribeye again.",1,1,1,Kevin C.,"Charleston, SC",1,7,3

This joint is owned by the same management as Club A Steakhouse, and it really shows.Located next to major attractions such as the Lincoln Center, we previously stopped by to get the pre-fixe pre-theatre menu, which includes an entree, appetizer, and dessert for $39.However, on this specific October evening, my husband got to try the NY strip steak and I got a try a bunch of the sides. I highly recommend the creamed spinach and the truffle mac and cheese. Both are exceptional in their own right. We were also able to bring a great Italian super tuscan to dinner for a $20 corkage fee, a very reasonable fee in my personal opinion. When we finished dinner, we got free souffle and the owner came to take our picture. There were other personal touches like a menu with ""Happy Birthday"" written on it.

I then had a mixed salad which was fresh and crisp. Main course was the petite filet that was cooked perfectly to medium rare. They use a light salt rub for flavor. The only thing that confused me was the ketchup (they call it steak sauce) that they include with each steak. Ketchup is not steak sauce and the meat is great without sauce so why bother?  Also adding the sweetness of ketchup to such a savory dish just ruins the flavor balance.  I wish I had saved more room for desert. The cheesecake was creamy and rich, nestled in a light raspberry sauce. Hands down one of the best deserts I've had in a while. I just wish I could have had more than a few bites!The decor is a modern twist on classic steakhouse. Red walls make the room dark but add a nice ambiance. Would be a good place for a romantic date, especially with the candles and roses on each table. The service was prompt and efficient. Kept my friends' wine glasses full.

4.0,9/26/2015,"I'm going to stray from my normal review writing style for this review. Belly too full for paragraphs.Tips:- If you don't mind eating at 5, try to be their first diners. It pays off. -If you don't want to take a gamble on getting funky meat, steer clear of the dry aged beef. My dry aged ribeye was fine but my husband's dry aged ribeye might have him ill later. We'll put it this way...We didn't even bring his leftovers home for the dog. - If you get the chocolate souffle, and they ask if you'd like for them to serve you, say no! Do it yourself! The guy stirred that poor souffle into a puddle. It was kind of adorable. The souffle was generously sized to share and delicious by the way. - The ambience is a cross between a campy vampire flick and Goodfellas.

We ordered the porterhouse for 3 and received 2 perfectly prepared medium sized steaks. They were truly delicious. We also ordered the creamed spinach and potato puree which were great accompaniments to the steaks. I'm not a huge creme brulee fan but had to give it a try.

When we brought it to the manager's attention, he told us that this happens with aged steaks and offered to bring us another steak. Unfortunately, we had already lost our appetite at that point. The manager gave us free desserts and took the Ribeye off the bill, which was appreciated but not fully redeeming.We also had the Porterhouse which was good and well-seasoned so no complaints there.The service was exceptional.

From wine recommendation, side dishes, swiftness and friendliness was incredible. I went there with several friends who were visiting NYC, and they were completely in love, as well.I also like that they have several different types of sauces to try with the porterhouse; wolfgangs don't have that and ...did Peter Luger? I don't remember if they did not not, but they had the most selection here for sure. If I have one request it will be that they have more types of bread - the only type they had was super cheezy tasting one, which I was too scared to have since I'm lactose intolerant and they didn't have any other types.

The ribeye was perfectly seasoned, they give you sauces complimentary but trust me you don't need them. For sides we ordered truffle mac and cheese, baked potato, creamed spinach, and asparagus. All the sides were tasty and enough for two people. I have to give a special mention of our waiter, Nicola, he was awesome and gave great recommendations. He also helped make my mom's 70th birthday dinner special.

5.0,9/4/2015,"Oh, wow, I had an excellent dinner at this place, but at a fairly high price.Are you looking for some delicious and expensive steak in an upscale and sophisticated setting in the Upper West Side? My relatives were on the hunt for an excellent steakhouse in this part of New York, and we found out this place just opened. When I walked inside, I felt like I was inside a typical upscale restaurant in New York, and I was really under-dressed, but you could wear something casual to this place. One of the most expensive items on the menu is the Porterhouse Steak. Initially I was looking at the less expensive steak choices such as the Hanger Steak, but I was convinced to get the Porterhouse because it was a better quality cut of meat. Although it was expensive at almost $50 per person, the steak is large enough for about two people to eat. We ordered it cooked medium rare, and it was so juicy and tender. After dipping it into some horseradish sauce, the flavor was even better. As for the side dishes, the asparagus was freshly cooked and had a decent flavor. The Au Gratin potatoes had a nice creamy taste and were a great complement to the asparagus. The Canadian Bacon was also really good, it was not overly fried and crispy, but had that juicy tenderness with the right amount of thickness. They gave us some free ravioli pasta as a nice little bonus, and that was also pretty good with a nice creamy flavor. The wine they served here was also an excellent complement to the steak, we had a Los Nevados Malbec 2013 red wine and had a nice taste with a few sips to wash the palate. The service was pretty good. One of my relatives recently had a child, and although she was crying a lot, the staff was so friendly toward my niece. If you are looking for servers that are friendly toward young children, this place is great, as long as the children don't do really bad things to this place. Everyone overall was just really nice, helpful and willing to answer any tough question related to this place. Overall, I thought I had some of the tastiest steak in Upper West Side area of New York so far. If you really want the best steak experience, you should get the Porterhouse Steak cooked medium rare, and if you want an enhanced experience, you should get some of that Los Nevados Malbec red wine as a complement to the Porterhouse Steak. I also thought I had some of the best bacon in New York so far, and the bacon would be nice for a very hearty and tasty breakfast.  I love tasty good quality steak.I love New York.I really liked eating at this place.",4,4,3,Ambrose C.,"Brooklyn, NY",128,570,1654

We decided to wait in the lounge. After a few minutes we were offered a glass of wine while we wait. They had live piano music playing which was nice. Later it switched to non live, which was also nice to switch it up. Our appetizers came out quick we all got different salads and all were great! They sent out one large ravioli after the salads to each of us, compliments of the chef ... Yummy! We got different cuts of steak at different temperatures, all were PERFECTLY cooked to our liking...They had great flavor. Our sides and steak sauces came less than a minute after our steaks, it's too much for one person to carry. The owner came over and welcomed us, we chatted him up a little bc we asked him questions, he wasn't annoying. He later sent us 2 desserts and after dinner drinks on the house.

3.0,8/30/2015,"I am guilty of committing an offense. I came into a posh restaurant with extra-high expectations. Unfortunately they did not pan out.Visiting my daughter and her roommate in Queens, we were to meet two others for a nice dinner. After a good deal of filtering, we decided on Lincoln Square Steakhouse, due to its virtually unanimous high rankings, and because they accepted our reservation that afternoon for dinner that evening.We rode the cab from Astoria to West-side Manhattan in great anticipation of a classy experience. We got to the place about 15 minutes early and had a drink at the bar while awaiting two others from our party. 4 drinks plus tip were $58.00, so this place is not for the budget-conscious, and we decided early on not to let price be an issue this night.Once assembled, we were sat very cordially and professionally - although we were left one menu short. This was quickly corrected. The ambiance was casually romantic. The service was ultra-professional throughout...the stuff that 5-star reviews were made for.We were offered sparkling or still water at the beginning. We all chose NYC's finest tap. We were then served popovers before ordering, which were obviously fresh-made, warm and delicious. We placed our orders, which ran the gamut from filet mignon to dry-aged rib eye (me), sauteed shrimp, and a 12 oz burger. Half of us ordered side salads, which were a bit pricey, but were very fresh and appetizing. My wife's Caesar was very good, especially the two criss-crossed anchovies.Entrees arrive. My rib-eye, although beautiful, aromatic, and wonderfully tasty, was at least 8 oz. short of the advertised 24 oz. Still, it was cooked perfectly, and were it as big as advertised, would have had me bursting at the seams. My daughter's filet, ordered medium-rare, was on the upper side of medium. Had this been a steak at Ruby Tuesday's she would have likely finished it off without a word, but I guess if you are paying over $45 for a steak, it should have been cooked closer to the requested doneness. She decided it was better to eat it than to make us wait while another was being prepared.Speaking of Ruby Tuesday's, I've had better baked potatoes there. this one was obviously cooked in foil, which provided for a steamed potato rather than baked, with a thin, lackadaisical skin, and a solidified, non-mealy interior. They were apparently more intent on bulk-cooking them than worrying about the finished quality. Why would a top-grade place cook bakers like this? I don't think anyone would argue it was not worth a fraction of the $10 they charged.My wife's sauteed shrimp, while impressive in size, were unspectacular. The 12-oz. burger was 8 oz at absolute most.It is a shame that the kitchen output did not match up to the impeccable service and perfect amount of attention that the front of the house gave us. I am not saying the food was terrible, it just did not keep pace with the service, or the check, which with tip was over $400 for the six of us. Maybe my sights were set too high, but next time I want to get my beef on in NYC, we'll try a different place.",2,1,0,Alfred F.,"Hartford, CT",143,219,227

When I called to make a reservation, I was delighted to hear a happy voice on he phone, which is rare for NYC. The staff was amazing, so sweet, and so helpful. The food was phenomenal. The bread that they serve happened to be popovers...which were to die for. Before our courses, we were also served a complimentary mushroom ravioli, and even though I hate mushrooms, this was probably the best ravioli I have ever eaten. The steak is the by far the best I have ever had, and I normally eat at Peter Lugers, BLT prime, Benjamin's & other top steakhouses. For desert they gave us complimentary pistachio ice cream and a chocolate cake, which were both also spectacular. The owner, Bruno came over to our table a few times, and checked on how every thing was, which was very kind & caring.

5.0,8/10/2015,"I went to dinner here tonight, I was in the mood for a steak salad and hadn't eaten in quite a long time so I consulted Yelp to help me find a place. The atmosphere is very nice, there's a beautiful painting in the dining room more towards the back. The rooms that you can reserve for private dining were magnificent as well. We were served right away and offered warm bread and served water. Our server was very polite and helped us pick everything out. Me and my mom wanted to split an 8 oz steak, when it was brought out it wasn't like a steak cut in half. To accommodate us perfectly they had cooked two 4 oz steaks. The steak was also cooked perfectly, everybody marveled at how well done it was. As we were waiting a waiter brought each of us a complimentary mushroom ravioli. We didn't order desert either but a complimentary creme brulee and cheesecake were brought to our table, which were both delicious although I preferred the creme brulee. Upon getting the bill we also discovered that the coffee and my moms wine were complimentary as well. The owner also came to check on us before and after we ate and we had a lovely conversation with him. He told us they had only been open 6 months and we couldn't believe it since they were doing so well.

5.0,8/10/2015,"I'll be honest.  I didn't think the experience would turn out like it did when after walking in, our receptionist told me my reservation wasn't on their list.  I had indicated that I had made the reservation through the Yelp app, and they understood, and were still able to accommodate us.  This is probably the only complaint I have on this review, and I hope Lincoln Square Steak (LSS) fixes this problem.Back to the review - As you walk in, you hear a pianist playing tunes from Broadway's famous musicals to Billy Joel classics.  The red-inspired restaurant was bigger than I thought, and as we walked to our table, I noticed they had some private rooms for parties that needed it.  Good to know.  We sat towards the back on a three-top that was big enough for 4-people (which actually came in handy because a friend of ours unexpectedly joined us later for dinner).The menu has something for everyone.  They have the typical steaks a steakhouse should have, along with many appetizers and sides to choose from.  What got my attention was the many bottle of wines they had for under $30.  We thought about bringing our own wines, and pay the $20 corkage fee, but in this case, it wasn't necessary.  Lastly, they had some Italian dishes to choose from that could accommodate two people.Of course, we ordered a few pilsners to start out with.  I'd say they have about 10 different beers on draft.  And later, we ordered a bottle of white and red with the help of the sommelier that was on-premise.  For those ordering red, note the 'fun to pour' hand blown carafe.  Pretty cool.  As for the food, we went with:- thick slab of Canadian bacon (very good and kid tested!)- truffle macaroni and cheese (very good and kid tested!)- seared scallops (excellent despite only 3 scallops but worth it; also it came with some broccoli)- cream of spinach (very good)- potatoes au gratin (good)- porterhouse for two (very good)The food overall was very good.  The porterhouse doesn't top Lugers in my opinion, but the complimentary sauces it came with only accentuated its taste.  Speaking of complimentary, I forgot to mention that we also got this popover bread that was pretty 'van damn' good.Now what makes this a 5-star review is the service.  Is there such thing as over-the-top-service without being overbearing??  Vinny, our server, was very accommodating, and all of his suggestions were on point.  We were undecided on the lobster ravioli as an order, and Vinny gave us each a complimentary mushroom ravioli as a taster.  Delicious.  The next time we visit, we will definitely order the ravioli.  We ended the night with a trio of dessert - creme brulee, cheese cake, and chocolate cake - all were outstanding.  One last side note - Bruno, the owner of this joint, greeted every table in the restaurant to ensure everything was up to par.  He did this a few times during the night which goes to show how dedicated he is with customer satisfaction.Our overall experience at LSS was tremendous, and the service was in a class by itself.  Kudos to Vinny, Bruno, the sommelier, bus boys, and the receptionist - who all made this a dinner we would never forget, and it's safe to say we'll definitely be back.",6,0,2,Gail Anthony T.,"Jersey City, NJ",77,155,25

We were given complimentary appetizers, but I also ordered the cocktail shrimp which were extremely fresh. I ordered the lamb for my entree (which was phenomenal) and he ordered off the pre-fixe menu (which was an awesome deal). At the end of our meal, they brought out this amazing chocolate desert for him (on the house) and they also took our picture. Later, the chef came out with the picture in a card and personally told my BF thanks for coming then signed the card with the keepsake picture in it.

The only point that needs attention is the deserts (cheese cake, chocolate cake, creme brûlée ) which are nowhere near the quality of the meal itself.

It wasn't stuffy or snobby at all and they brought out little surprise bites of goodness throughout the meal. And we weren't even really dressed up! Their creme brûlée was phenomenal and so was the steak. I highly recommend this place, especially for anyone that has to restrict gluten or is on the Paleo diet.

Caesar Salad excellent, as was expected.  I even ate the anchovies which I rarely do.  Main event was the PH for 2 which was of excellent quality, perfectly done (rare), and beautifully presented.  Side of Mushrooms was great.  Sprouts very tasty but slightly underdone.  But for the martini it would have been 5 stars.  I will be back, for sure.CAB",0,0,0,Charles B.,"Vero Beach, FL",0,20,2

The crab cake and their special sauce was right on with only one other crab cake that can compare.

We had arrived early in the evening before going to the theater, and we took advantage of the Prix Fixe menu (appetizer or salad, entree, dessert for $39). All were delicious. The side dishes could easily serve 3 people. We had the most fantastic service, with at least 10 people coming to our table to check on things, including the owner, the bell captain, several waiters, the sommelier, busboys. When our cheesecake for dessert was brought to us, it had a candle in each of ours and the message Happy Anniversary along the border of the bowl in chocolate.

5.0,6/1/2015,"Dinner here this evening gave an unqualified sense of well-being ... at least until we got home and the babysitter said she'd recently gone vegetarian, but let's set that aside. The sense of well-being is what I want to stress. Especially relative to our experience with the previous incarnation of this space, which I really really wanted to love, but didn't. When we first moved into our apartment on an adjacent block, this space  was occupied by a New-American type place whose middling reviews kept us from ever trying it. After they folded, a Greek restaurant moved in, of which I was *totally* primed to be a superfan -- the owner/head-chef was pedigreed, and an air of ambition surrounded the place. The problem was that their ambition infused the prices more than it did the menu. The food wasn't bad -- it was, by and large, competently executed Greek classics. It's just that, to pay the presumably crazy rent on this space, you have to charge prices that are incommensurate with authentic classic cuisine -- you need to serve something with more originality & panache, or at least with a formidable quantity of high-quality protein. Which is where Lincoln Square Steak comes in. (Hopefully the previous tenant will find a more congenial home elsewhere -- sorry that I seem to be reviewing a defunct restaurant more than the present one -- but there is definitely a place for them.) Anyway the prices here are comparable to the previous tenant's, but I didn't feel as bad paying them, because I know steak isn't cheap, and the decor is better now (I am a sucker for good murals), and the people working there were cool and didn't give off the old trying-too-hard vibe. Top-notch jazz pianist too.Oh, the food? Yeah, it's good (I am interpreting the ""Woohoo! As good as it gets"" legend next to the 5-star option as ""Woohoo! As good as it gets on the Upper West Side""). Enjoyed the popovers. The steaks and the salad were unimpeachable. The asparagus soup was decent -- creamless (in its favor) but too chicken-brothy. The creamed spinach was very much in the venerable tradition of ""how can we make our vegetables even more unhealthy than our steaks?"". The french fries were kind of limp -- I wasn't the one who ordered these so I don't really care, but maybe the kitchen could work on crisping them up a bit. The prix-fixe desserts are in our refrigerator and if it turns out they aren't up to snuff, I will return here and knock off a star.Basically though the whole gestalt is very positive and convivial (on a Monday night!) so thanks to everyone involved, and rest assured we will back, in ever greater numbers.",2,0,1,Douglas E.,"New York, NY",0,31,0

It was something of a change from the stone/metal chic that is all the current rage...I sat at the bar with a friend for drinks and we ended up eating there.  The bartender was extremely pleasant and went out of his way to get me the right wine.

5.0,5/13/2015,What a gem! Warm ambiance and superb service that made our special evening even more memorable.  We ordered the porterhouse for two and were beyond pleased. The sides- including the complimentary potato gnocchi- were quite tasty and perfectly sized. Bruno came by to chat with us-- what a wonderful guy who clearly cares about making his restaurant a wonderful experience for his guests. After dinner we enjoyed the live piano music at the bar for a drink.  Well deserved five stars!!!!,1,0,0,Theresa B.,"Civic Center, Manhattan, NY",1,12,0
5.0,5/12/2015,"There are simply no words to describe the incredible experience I had with my girlfriend at this restaurant. Everything was amazing, from the decor (1960s themed), to the service, to the remarkable hospitality we received by the owner, Bruno, and his attentive staff. We received a complimentary appetizer, dessert, AND a drink of choice ON THE HOUSE.  INSANE. You can really tell the owner cares deeply about his establishment, as we watched him mingle around the room chatting with guests and making sure everybody was having a memorable time. This was, and will be, always something I will remember. The owner truly has a passion for his restaurant, and puts generosity and hospitality before profits. And the food? It speaks for itself. I recommend the truffle mac and cheese side, because it was out of this world delicious. The 30 wines under $30 list is a rare offering and I took advantage of it with a delicious Nero d'Avola. When I visit NYC again, I can't wait to come back. Lincoln Square Steak is a rare gem and I am so grateful I chose to dine here.",2,0,1,Gregg F.,"Austin, TX",144,9,2
3.0,5/11/2015,"Pros: Superb service, amazing complimentary popovers the size of grapefruits, light and crispy onion rings, large wine list with 30 bottles under $30 as well as many excellent picks on the higher-end.Cons: Our porterhouse for two was overcooked to medium (hot and light pink) or maybe even medium-well in spots when ordered medium-rare (warm and red) and lacked the sort of rich beefy flavor I expect from dry aging. It was somehow still incredibly tender, however, so that was a saving grace.Mixed bag: The decor is pretty wild and cool, provided you're not sitting in the very back, where there are unattractive glossy/speckled floors like you'd find in a cafeteria.Verdict: Might be worth visiting, especially for the unusual throwback aspect, but consider ordering your steak one level rarer than usual.",0,0,0,Jeff O.,"Manhattan, NY",274,278,702

2.0,5/10/2015,"I tried Lincoln Square Steak tonight with a few friends. Although we were a party of six, they sat us at a table with only four settings. When the waitress came over, she asked one of the people without a setting if they were going to be eating food at all, which was highly unprofessional, especially given that we made a reservation for six and they should have prepared the table accordingly. As the meal progressed, the waitress got more surly with us, and the service started going downhill very rapidly. The popovers were very tasty; unfortunately, they only served five of us and either forgot to bring more (or ignored us) when we pointed this out. The appetizers came out in a timely fashion, but this is the only course where this would be the case. I ordered the crab cake and had some of the fried calamari; the calamari was good, with a nice golden crust, but I didn't care much for either the crab cake or the sauce it was on.About twenty minutes after clearing our appetizers, they brought out complimentary mushroom ravioli. I'm not one for mushrooms but I tried it and the sauce was very nice. They took a while clearing the ravioli, and by this point in the meal, I was really looking forward to tucking into the steak. Unfortunately, when it arrived it looked like it had been partially hacked apart. I expect better from a critically acclaimed steakhouse, as it was evident that whoever cut the meat didn't know what they were doing. That is the kind of thing that distinguishes a great establishment from a mediocre one. I ordered my steak well done, but it was very unevenly cooked; parts were burned, while others were almost rare. I am surprised that they didn't do a butterfly cut with it in order to cook it the way I requested. One of our party ordered their steak well done, and it arrived medium; they told the waitress that they wanted it more well done and she told the busboy, who asked if they wanted it medium well and was visibly confused when she told him well done. After a few minutes, the steak finally came out well done, but it was evident that there were problems with the chain of command in the restaurant. The steak sauce (served separately) left much to be desired (it could benefit from some acidity). Of the sides, the garlic herb fries, lobster mac and cheese (you only get a tiny portion though) and sauteed asparagus were the best. If you're going to come here, stick to the steak, as the two members of our party who got fish did not like it at all.We decided to try out a few of their desserts and sorbets, to see if they could somehow redeem the meal for us. It took quite a while for them to come out of the kitchen. While the ice cream (vanilla and white chocolate) and sorbets (mojito and blood orange) were good, they came out partially melted. One member of the party got the peanut butter cake, which was stale and unappetizing (the popcorn on top was good, maybe use that as a basis for a new dessert). Another member got the bread pudding, which was completely raw on the bottom; luckily they stopped eating it as soon as they discovered that it wasn't cooked through. We also had to ask for cream for our coffee three times, and still didn't receive it by the time we paid the check. A word about the pricing: it is expensive, even for the Upper West Side. If the service was quick, the waitstaff didn't ooze attitude and all the food was spot on, it would perhaps justify the expense, but given the service tonight it was not worth it at all. Overall, we were incredibly dissatisfied and will not be returning to this establishment. It's worth noting that as of tonight (May 9th), one of the stalls in the woman's bathroom does not lock, which is absolutely unacceptable. That should be dealt with posthaste by management (a note on the door is not sufficient).",0,0,0,Teresa H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,19,0

2.0,5/8/2015,"I recently moved to the UWS and went to Lincoln Square Steak after seeing it while exploring the neighborhood. My girlfriend had the french onion soup, which was good. I had calamari, which was good but came with chili sauce that I did not enjoy. I would have preferred classic marinara. Then complimentary mushroom ravioli which was a nice gesture but too rich and made us full before the main course. We both got hangar steak which I have to say was delicious. But the mashed potatoes were very bland almost inedible. Same with truffle mac. Seemed like out of the box macaroni. Dessert was chocolate souffle  with pistachio ice cream. The waitress insisted on putting the ice cream over the souffle but we said please don't as we both dont like that flavor and she kept pushing to put it on and we kept saying no. Was awkward. However, the main problem is that Bruno, the owner, was nice but sorry to say wayyyy too nice. Came over to the table way too many times and seemed like he was massaging his ego. Would stare at us after talking to us and also hovered over our table so we did not feel like we were eating alone. He asked how the food was and insisted we tell all our friends and insisted on writing a yelp review. Did not have the heart to say dinner was fair. Also weird we got a bland blueberry muffin in a bag to take home with us.

2.0,5/8/2015,"Meh.A $22 hamburger/fries at a steak house should at least have non-ordinary fries.And if the menu gives an extensively detailed explanation of what ""rare,"" ""medium rare,"" etc. mean, then a hamburger ordered ""medium"" shouldn't come red and uncooked in the center.And the waiter shouldn't blame the kitchen when the hamburger comes with fries instead of the salad substitution that was requested.The person in our party who ordered a steak was satisfied with his dinner.",0,0,0,L B.,"Lexington, MA",0,20,1
5.0,5/8/2015,"Absolutely LOVE the over-the-top decor; easily the most fun steakhouse in NYC!  Definitely the place to go when you want to celebrate or have a fun time.  They have four private rooms, each decorated differently.  The smallest one, which I'm guessing seats six, possibly eight, is a confection of baroque elements, including a fireplace, all in blue.  You could probably reserve it just for two people.There are chandeliers and sconces galore, each is unique, and there are candles all over as well.  And of course, red is a very flattering color - takes years off your age, ladies!The main dining room is the quietest space on the Upper West Side, you can easily have a conversation without ever having to ask someone to repeat themselves once over the entire evening.  Tables are spaced further apart than usual for a New York restaurant, so you aren't sitting cheek to jowl with your neighbors.The service has always been excellent and the food tasty (except for the French fries, they're terrible).  Bruno is a warm, caring and gracious host and Luis and Marco make sure everyone is well taken care of.One little touch that really impressed me was that rather than bring your doggie bag to the table, they give you a numbered tag and you claim your food at the coat check on the way out.  Bruno thinks of everything!If you're looking for an ""experience"" along with your dinner, Lincoln Square Steakhouse should be at the top of the list!",1,0,0,Sydney B.,"New York, NY",2,12,0

The front of house staff and the bartender were all very friendly and helpful. The bad - the service was terrible and our waiter was beyond rude. First of all, the dining room was empty when we arrived so one would assume we would have had an attentive waiter. When we sat down we were ready to order drinks, but our waiter was only interested in trying to sell us on a $29 per person seafood platter. He was relentless even when we told him half of our party didn't eat seafood and we weren't interested. Rather than taking our drink order, he just sort of left in a huff and we sat and sipped water until he returned. We asked for recommendations from the menu and the waiter sort of shouted, ""those are all different things - how can I tell you what to order?"" Very weird.

2.0,5/3/2015,"We had dinner there last night, first time for any of the four of us. The room is certainly pleassnt, we had drinks  at the bar while we waited for our friends to arrive. The bar tender was polite and efficient. Our friends arrived and we went to our table. It was some time before anyone came with water, but when they did, we ordered sparkling. Though when they eventually came to refill the water, they mixed in still, more than  once. One of our friends that joined us waited at least 15 minutes before we could flag someone down to take he drink order. She ordered a Jack Daniels on the rocks. When it finally  arrived,  and she tasted it, it turned out to be scotch. It took some time to flag downa waiter again, was anyone assigned to our table, and when she explained the issue with the drink,  he apologized and disappeared withe the scotch.  After more  time went by, he reappeared, to announce they were out of Jack Daniels. She asked what bourbon they did have...he didn't know. She asked him to find out. After  some more time went by, he plopped a drink down in front of her, only telling her what it was after she pressed him for the information. It had been 50 minutes from the time we sat down, until she finally had a glass of bourbon. Though it was Saturday night. The place was not crowded. The staff seemed t o be tripping over each other, delivering the wrong orders to half of us. When it did arrive, it was tasty and  bountiful., though they continued to pour the wrong water all night There were three steak orders, and I had the lobster ravioli. When I got home from the restaurant,  I became violently I'll with vomiting and diarrhea.  None of my dinner companions got ill,  so I am guessing v it was the lobster. Though the manager did check in with us as we were leaving, we didn't care to launch into how lousy the service had been, for over $100 a person, choosing rather to leave and avoid the confrontation  We will NOT  be going back, and since they don't seem to be restocking their liquor, they probably won't be there for long.",1,1,0,Kevin W.,"East Chatham, NY",0,1,0

Made from scratch in the kitchen, you have to finish it within 5 mins because that's the time you will have the best everything from the temperature to the texture. Some of us had 2 because it's sooooo good.Every dish is great. Obviously everyone enjoyed their food. My personal best favorite is the Petite Fillet Mignon. You just enjoy the flavor of the beef itself. Only the best material can pass this kind of test. And the fries served together are exceptional. We ordered cheesecake and chocolate cake for desert. Both are good, but I would say their cheesecake is great. I am not a fan of strawberry ice cream in general , but the strawberry ice cream topping the cheese cake makes me cannot stop. And the cheese cake just melts in the mouth, and indulge you the way you want it be. The cracker base is another reason to order it. It is crunchy and crispy, and a piece of joy. Service is good, when we wait, maybe because we have a big group, we wait a little bit extra long, I didn't feel it actually, but the manager offered to complimentary mushroom ravioli, which I will come back again just for it.

5.0,3/26/2015,"Went tonight for the first time. Didn't realize until we got there that it was the same ownership as Club A steakhouse on east side which happened to be one of our favorites. (My wife planned a birthday party for 25 there which they pulled off incredibly).  Bruno (the owner) doesn't disappoint at Lincoln Square Steak. Appetizers (especially the oysters) were dynamite. I personally also had the beat salad which was great. All steaks were very well received and generous portions. The mushroom side was excellent. The Brussels sprouts were only ok, but spinach was great. The only knock is the sommelier. He has a little work to do to match the food's standards, but overall great time, great waiter and great food. Would recommend and will repeat. Thanks Bruno for opening a west side restaurant.

4.0,3/23/2015,"I have eaten here twice so far in the past two weeks.  In my first visit I had the Veal Chop , Steamed Asparagus and Caesar Salad.  The Veal Chop was well cooked and was served with Mushrooms and peppers on it.  There was nothing special about the steamed asparagus except they tasted good :).  The Caesar Salad was I guess typical with shaved parm and three anchovies on top.  I usually prefer the anchovies mashed into the dressing and the salad tossed in the dressing.  The second visit I had Porterhouse , creamed spinach and hash browns.  The porterhouse was done perfectly and the sides were very tasty.  Overall the meals were what I expected and very good.  Both times I ate at the Bar and have to say the service was professional and quick.  The Bar Staff was engaging and helpful and really made me feel welcome.  I really didn't look into the dining room but it looks spacious and nicely decorated.  The bar area with tables is nice inviting and they have a piano player for music.  The Hostess was very cordial and helpful and cheerful.    It is still the early days of this place but I think they should do well and whatever growing pains others perceive will soon evaporate.  Hopefully the community will support the place as there have been two previous restaurants in the same location over the last 8 years.  Also as far as price is concerned they are comparably priced with other Steak Houses so no one should be surprised.",0,0,0,Raymond P.,"New York, NY",14,267,29

5.0,3/22/2015,"I noted that a number of reviewers panned the place for the great prevalence of the color red in the decor. REALLY? Is there nothing else more important than wall color when assessing a restaurant?? The next common wayward complaint is that the side dishes are lackluster. First of all: They are not lackluster. They are perfectly good. And, secondly:  Let us remember, the side dishes are NOT SUPPOSED TO BE works of art in a steakhouse; they are simply supposed to be sides. The emphasis is on the STEAK.My friend and I went for the prix fixe dinner.  We both had the hangar steak, which was perfectly done according to our cooking requests. The steaks were delicious. We shared sides. A baked potato, and creamed spinach.  The baked p. was, well, a great big potato. It was properly cooked. The creamed spinach was a step above the creamed s. that I've had in many other steak houses.  The service was friendly and impeccable from the moment we walked in.The verdict: a very nice addition to the upper west side, and one that may actually be around in that location for many years to come.",1,0,0,Cliff K.,"New York, NY",33,117,2

The freebies of pop over bread and mushroom ravioli really got my appetite going and was a perfect starter. The entree of hanger steak cooked to a perfect medium was so tastey I didn't even need a sauce. The side dish of baked potato was delicious (and I don't know where elce you can get a baked potato that size). Last but not least was the very well presented tastey cheesecake.

I really wanted to become a ""regular"" here.  Alas, 2 stars....and it just eeked out 2 stars.The ambience is nice but you really have to like the color red because it's everywhere. The walls, the lighting. What I liked most about the restaurant was that it has a listing of 30 bottles of wine for under $30. Which is a deal especially since there were some really nice bottles on the list.So, what's not great about this place? Well, I ordered the burger. Simple right? You need to do 2 things. One is make sure that the meat is a good quality and two that it's cooked as ordered. Well, the meat was an interesting flavor. But they FAILED on the order. My burger arrived with cheese (which I did not order) and it was well done, when I specifically said medium rare. But what makes matters worse is that I got halfway thru my burger and bit into a piece of plastic. Ugh...that made me question my whole meal.Bottomline: Go for the drinks and skip the food. For me it doesn't matter how many deals you create (they have a price fix from 5-6:30 pm) if the food has shrapnel in it why go there to eat?",9,1,0,Yvette S.,"Manhattan, NY",58,84,9

At the table, someone took our order and we never saw her again. We were unsure who our server was, and finally flagged down a passing waiter to order wine. Our salads came, and the runners did not know who ordered which. Much, much time passed, and about an hour later our steaks were served. The sides had been sitting a while, and were limp and greasy, rather than crisp. Other sides we had not ordered came. The wine barely made it to the table before the steak.

Wine list was very complete (other restaurants should take notice) selections from all over the globe very well priced and not over priced like many other restaurants. The not so good or bad: We were a party of four, for apps we tried the crab cakes, scallops, tuna tartare and the shellfish platter. Foremost; I'm from Baltimore and this crab cake was inedible. It wasn't fresh or lump crab meat it was frozen re-heated food. No Old Bay no seasoning whatsoever it was awful. The Scallops were also frozen and they smelled ""off"" Seafood should not smell bad but should smell like the Ocean this wasn't the case. The Tuna Tartare was pedestrian no flavor no seasoning and needed salt real bad. Shellfish platter was typical of a steakhouse. Oysters clams etc.. It was okay. The lump crab meat and lobster weren't in any way fresh. Our waiter said they were but he's just doing his job. Entrees; Porterhouse for 3 and a Bone in New York Steak. I know Dry Aged Beef very well as I buy it myself and I dine out 3-4 times a week and eat steak out regularly.  This meat was ""off"" had a stranger odor to it and wasn't very flavorful. It lacked seasoning. (Salt will help!!) We also had creamed spinach, truffled macaroni and cheese and a baked potato. The creamed spinach had truffle oil and lacked salt and seasoning. The truffled mac and cheese could of used again salt and canned Truffle oil is becoming a bore in this city maybe think of another recipe! Baked Potato was a baked potato. The restaurant had no chives or scallions??An older fellow came over towards the end of the meal and told us he was bringing us desserts and thanked us for coming in.

2.0,2/12/2015,"Disappointed in this new neighborhood steak house. Immediately out of the box, we were being sold on an expensive bottle of wine. Though the wine list has 30 bottles under $30, that was not mentioned. Tried the prix fix dinner. For appetizers, my companions were disappointed with the ""Canadian Bacon"" which was a nicer way of saying pork belly bar bacon. It was pure fat, no lean. My green salad was fine, but nothing special. The menu should have stated that it was covered with crumbled blue cheese. Though okay for me,  not everyone likes it.  We ordered the hanger steaks medium rare at our server's recommendation. The steaks arrived blood rare. Had to send it back. They were very tasty but also very chewy. Supposedly, the meat had been marinated but that process, which would normally tenderize the meat, had no effect. Side dishes (broccoli, creamed spinach, and baked potato) were mediocre. Desserts were worse than mediocre. We sampled three desserts, cheesecake, fruit tart, and chocolate cake. The cheesecake was dry and crumbly. The fruit tart was not really a tart in the traditional sense. Also very dry. The custard strange. The chocolate cake was served cold from the refrigerator and was a sponge cake rather than a Devils food cake. It was overwhelmed by a Chantilly cream sauce drizzled on top that was loaded with a liquor.  Also, everything, including butter, was over-salted. Service was attentive, perhaps a little too attentive. And the decor was upscale bordello.

Understandably it's a new place so we were trying to take things with a grain of salt, but I simply can't justify going back to Lincoln Square Steak. First off, the decor is very off putting, but it's a steakhouse, so whatever. We had a late reservation, so it was about 40% full but they stuck us in a corner by ourselves where it was freezing cold (we asked them multiple times to turn up the heat). There's no music playing, so on a quieter night in was particularly eerie. Our original server introduced himself awkwardly and then proceeded to chew out another server right behind us because apparently they were switching staff and he was supposed to take our table. The original server never came back. Waited for 15 minutes for someone to finally come over and take our order. They came back in 15 minutes or so to bring us sample apps to try (which is great), but completely forgot about our drinks (not great). The food eventually came out and the funny part, was that it was actually pretty good! Not the best steak I've ever had, but certainly very good and the sides we're also tasty. Of course things were short lived because no one ever came back to refill our wine or check in on things. We sat there with empty plates for another 20 minutes with no drinks. This is when our patience finally broke. It's one thing if a place is busy and people are running around, but there were literally 5-10 servers standing around (again late dinner). Finally called over someone to complain. We were just trying to leave and making that clear. At this point and when they finally brought our check and no one came back to pick it up!

The interior is a little bit like dining in a bordello. Seriously overdone red, red, red. Table logistics are wrong, i.e., the pedestals upon which the tables rest have a very wide base and you cannot get your chair under the table...hence, you cannot move your chair in closer if the table immediately behind you needs to squeeze by. Cheesy solitary red rose in a thrift-shop vase. Very dated...and not in a thoughtful gesture to a bygone era. Just cheesy and a mish-mash of bordello, sports bar, and diner rolled into one. And why, oh why, do you have a photo of former NY Giant Lawrence Taylor on your wall with his arms around kids?  Look at this guy's rap sheet, folks. Service was particularly lacking. The staff are dressed in black (with red ties, natch) and their buzzing around the dining room in no particularly coordinated order led to some pretty hilarious run-ins. A lot of movement.  A lot of chaos. We had ample observation time because our server was MIA for a while. When he finally arrived, he lacked any sense of nuance as a server, especially in a place with prices like this. When pouring champagne,he was told by one in our party, ""Oh, no thanks"" but the waiter insisted, saying, ""Well there's just a little bit left in the bottle,"" and proceeded to pour.  Hello?!  When ordering, he either cut us off from ordering our meal in its entirety (I never had the chance to tell him that I wanted brussel sprouts because he just moved on to next person.) or neglected to tell us some details that would be helpful such as the souffle taking 30 minutes (if he had said this earlier, that would have been fine. I know souffles take time. Yet we ordered one, he said nothing, then came back five minutes later to announce we would be waiting for 30 more minutes.) Due to his snail's pace of service, we had been sitting for a very long time already. The food was fine enough, although my shrimp were warm. My friend's brussel sprouts were incinerated, not charred. When two people ordered their entrees, the server didn't ask if they wanted any side sauces. Hence, when the orders arrived, the server had to go back to the kitchen to bring the sauces.  For the prices, and the fact that these menu items aren't haute cuisine but staple pieces, things should be executed with more precision. It's a formulaic steak house menu, not molecular gastronomy.It was just such a terribly mismanaged affair. I understand the restaurant is new. I also know the management is NOT and the sub-par service should not be here. As an end note, the server handed us each a little bag with two muffins inside to take home. Prior to writing this review, I began to pick at the muffin top and continued to eat the muffin until I got to the part that was totally unbaked and raw.  The devil is in the details, people.",6,3,1,Mary W.,"Pound Ridge, NY",0,12,0
5.0,1/23/2015,"Bruno Selimaj does it again! Another gem of a steakhouse in a neighborhood that desperately needed one. The service and quality of steak are just as superb as Club A's. If you are headed to Lincoln Center for any show or event, this is your new go-to spot for a quality meal before or afterwards. Decor is A+ as well.",3,1,1,Danny G.,"Bronxville, NY",119,51,2
1.0,1/21/2015,"So I went tonight with the intention of finding a new find across the street.  Three unfriendly hostesses greeted me.  I went to bar.  Bartender cleared two glasses from my spot but took one of the dirty napkins and returned it to me to serve my martini on (not grammatical, but . . . ).  $16 martini was okay-ish, but not worth the tariff.  Got a new napkin (didn't charge more).  Crowd?  Guys talking about their e-something dates tomorrow night.  Don't know who this place is trying to attract, but I wanted to order food and just decided to go next door to Luxembourg.  God bless -- their bar was packed so I went home to leftover meatloaf (just fine) and my bottle of gin ($40 for more than 2 drinks).  This site has  been cursed and I fear it is again.  The fussy attitude on a side street on the UWS is just over the top.  And I will never pay $16 for a half a drink.  Plus: piano player -- he was playing old standards which were wonderful (of course, the clientele had no clue what he was playing.  Total mismatch).",3,2,0,Warren B.,"Hicksville, NY",0,3,0
3.0,1/21/2015,"I also had a birthday dinner here this week. The food was fine, but a bit salty for my and my husband's taste. The shrimp cocktail appetizer was delicious - the shrimp were large, very plump and very fresh/tasty. My husband had the calimari, which were a little soggy and too salty. The service was fine, although they forgot my second glass of wine as the evening progressed - I did request it from our server, but he was distracted with his other tables. We finally asked a bus boy to get it and there was a big discussion as to which white I'd had. I thought that would have been recorded on the check. The one thing I really didn't like is that we were a large party - 8. The table was a big square, which really prohibited conversation. Round tables are much better, warmer, more inclusive. This felt very formal and I was very far away from everyone I wanted to talk to. The decor is beautiful, very striking and elegant. Music was nice too, not too loud. The mural on the wall in the dining room is wonderful. I also liked how they catered to some young kids at a table near us - very child-friendly place. The staff is friendly too and very warm which is also nice. I think maybe because I'm a seafood person and my husband prefers poultry that we don't appreciate this place the way a meat lover would. It is pricey so if you're trying it for the first time, I'd do the prix fixe.",2,0,0,D. S.,"Long Island City, NY",0,30,0
3.0,1/21/2015,"my husband and i had been looking forward to trying this place out as we live really close by and there just aren't that many good eateries in the immediate area.  the decor and ambiance inside are really nice.  there was a live pianist playing in the bar area.  we went on a tuesday night at 6pm for the prefixe menu.  i had checked out the menu online before going so was disappointed to see that several of the things listed on the prefixe menu online weren't on the menu in the restaurant.  for example, online had the petite filet mignon as an entree choice but that wasn't there.  for desserts, there were no mixed ice cream or sorbets listed either.  when i asked, the server said that the menu changes often (to which i replied, you only opened one week ago?).  so my party all ordered the hanger steak (we're at a steak restaurant, right?).  i honestly don't frequent steak restaurants that often, but i am originally from texas so i've eaten my share of delicious steaks.  i was a little surprised to see the hanger steak come presliced.  does that dry the meat up faster?  the steak was decent, but as it got cold it got chewier and chewier.  i ordered the baked potato as my side and that was probably the biggest disappointment of the whole meal.  it was literally one gigantic baked potato with nothing in it and a side of sour cream.  i guess to me, baked potato at least has butter.  i didn't end up eating much of that.  the other two guests in my party got french fries and broccoli and the broccoli was definitely the best (though they were cut incredibly large).  for dessert, since it was three of us, we just got one of each.  i'm not a huge cheesecake fan, but it ended up being my favorite dessert.  it sat in a pool of raspberry sauce with a scoop of raspberry ice cream on top.  the chocolate cake came with some blueberries on top (not very sweet and more on the light side). the ""fruit tart"" was a pretty big disappointment because it wasn't a fruit tart.  it was a warm apple puff pastry with a scoop of vanilla on top.  i'm a baker, so to me, it was completely misrepresented.  if you want an apple puff pastry, i'm sure it was fine, but i'm not a fan of apple desserts and i just wouldn't have ordered it if i knew that was what was coming.  actually, the best part of the meal was the hot popover with some kind of cheddar butter they served each of us at the beginning of the meal.  we also each got an additional portobello raviolo that the chef sent out.  i could tell the servers was trying very hard to take care of every little thing.  we had no wait (though it was 6pm on a tuesday night) and the restaurant was maybe half full.  a man that seemed like he was the owner came by to check on us.  everyone seemed very attentive.  i think my main complaint was the menu (that the online menu is already different than the printed menu, maybe the online menu should say that items rotate or are subject to change or something).  if i want to take someone out to a nice meal close by home, i might come again.  otherwise, i'm not sure if i would.",1,3,1,Evey S.,"New York, NY",0,41,1
1.0,1/18/2015,"Not so great. However, they have only been open for a week. That said it was a bit of a train wreck... Cold popover, red wine served in white wine glasses, steaks cooked wrong and had to be sent back. Our waiter actually said ""I have been avoiding your table because I know you want to kill me for how long your food is taking"". When we finally flagged down the manager he questioned the steak preparation as if we did not know how we liked out steak. On a positive note, they comped the steak and bought us dessert. I should add that we started at the bar and the female bartender was amazing. We may go back and give them a second chance. In several months. Maybe. I miss Loi.",2,0,0,Megan Z.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0
2.0,1/18/2015,"My fiancé and I were super excited to check out this new spot, given we live close by and there are no other steak houses in the area. We made a reservation for 8:30PM Saturday night, but when we arrived, we were told we had to wait. We ended up going to the bar to grab a drink, where we overheard several patrons complaining about the wait time. I kept a positive attitude, but when 30 minutes went by until our table was ready, I was a little perturbed.  We ordered the sea scallops, porter house steak for two, brussel sprouts, hash browns and one of the $30 bottles of red wine. The scallops were really good, although for $16 was expecting more than two. The red wine was absolutely freezing. After waiting about an hour for the entree, I flagged down a manager, who apologized for the wine and the wait. The porterhouse was pretty good (a little fatty, but that is usually expected).  We both loved the brussel sprouts and the hash browns.I am giving this two stars because the service was awful.  I understand this was opening weekend, but for a high end restaurant, where customers pay a premium, the staff should have been trained.  I think there is a lot of potential here; nice atmosphere and good food.  Just not sure if I will give it a second chance.  On shot, one career.",3,0,0,Douglas G.,"New York, NY",0,6,0
3.0,1/18/2015,"My wife and I went on their first Saturday night for an 8:15 reservation. The hostesses were lovely and one remembered talking to me earlier in the day. The place was packed and seemed to have an over abundance of front of house staff which is a great thing to see. I knew going in that there would be some kinks in the operation since it was opening night, and the tables next to us we're definitely very vocal about their frustrations. A table of four next to us with two kids had been there since 6:30 and had not received their entrees and the two tables next to us received steaks that we're not cooked properly. We did not suffer the same fate. Our waiter warned us that the kitchen was way behind and asked if he could put in our entree orders along with our apps so we wouldn't have to wait. The chopped vegetable salad was good, not great and definitely not worth the price. The crab cakes were excellent with little to no breaking.My strip was cooked perfectly medium rare and my wife said her salmon was fantastic. For sides, we ordered the sautéed spinach and wild mushrooms, which were both great but probably could have used less salt in the cooking. I wish our waiter had warned us that the salmon came on a bed of spinach but I, sure the service and knowledge of the staff will improve considering who's running the front of house.Drinks were good and they featured a great affordable wine list, I would definitely go back once they've figured out the operation.",5,0,0,David S.,"New York, NY",25,2,0

5.0,1/15/2015,"Went on Opening NIght and this place is great! A fantastic addition to the UWS.The front lounge area is the biggest in the neighbourhood. Nice ambiance and a piano player like a real lounge. Big bar and lots of tables. The restaurant is large and spacious, it's very ornate and beautiful. It was crowded and the food didn't disappoint. It's a very varied menu with not only Steaks but Eggplant Parmigiana, A variety of Fish dishes and Chicken. Nice wine list and cocktail list. A lot of staff on hand to implement service and of course Bruno the owner who was very welcoming to our table.I saw him walk around the room and talk to everyone, not something you see that much in restaurants anymore.

5.0,1/15/2015,"This place blew away all the expectation I had. Being that it is a new restaurant and this was one of the full opening nights, I was skeptical that they had not gotten all the tiny little things that make a place like this great perfected yet... surely they had. Decided to give this place a shot with one of my girlfriends. As we walked in, the coat check was conveniently located on our right. A lovely young lady took our coat as two hostesses greeted us. We were seated in what looked to me as the main dinning room. When we walked in there was a large bar area with coffee tables and a full bar to our left. I took it upon myself to do a walk around the restaurant and every single thing in here is BEAUTIFUL! From the walls, to the floors, to the furniture, every little detail in this place is gorgeous. While I did my quick walk around I caught three different private rooms. Each of them seemed like they had a different look to them. From what I could see these rooms looked just as beautiful as the rest of the restaurant. Once we were seated a bread basket came out first with an assortment of tasty rolls and bread. For starters I had the beet salad which was delicious and my friend had the tuna tartare that she said she loved. I was feeling like pasta that day so for my main dish I got the rigatoni Bolognese and my friend the Dry aged rib eye. My pasta was delicious. My friend's steak cooked to perfection. All washed down with a bottle of Koenig Cabernet Sauvignon priced at 45... how can you beat that?! The service here was also great, we didn't have to ask for anything. Our server who was a nice young man kept on his toes for us. All in all this is a wonderful place for dinner with friends, family, or a romantic partner. I will be back asap. Hoping to have a party here soon..",11,0,6,Leonora G.,"New York, NY",15,73,2
