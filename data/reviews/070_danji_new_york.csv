2.0,4/27/2019,"Heard so many great things about this restaurant, especially having watched master chef korea. I ordered the beef slider, short ribs and kimchi fried rice. The sliders were ok--a little salty. The short rib was ridiculously salty. I usually add salt to a lot of my food, but even for me it was so so soooo salty. It was $40 for a tiny portion, but honestly i was glad it was tiny because i couldn't finish it. The fried rice was ok. will not be going back. thanks.",0,0,0,Lauren C.,"Plano, TX",122,3,0
3.0,4/26/2019,"Considering how I am a Korean, paying $20 for bibimbap made me cringe a little inside. Although delicious, I will say... don't eat here if you are expecting an authentic Korean food. I definitely felt that it was fushion-ized. FOOD:I ordered Spicy Pork Belly Bibimbap ($17) and paid additional $3 for chul-sot because I really like how crispy the rice gets when bibimbap is served in a stone bowl. I have to say, they nailed the art of crispy rice. I have tried making this at home and I am ashamed to say that I have failed despite learning how to do it from my mom (it's not easy to get that crispy rice without burning them). Danji did a great job, I did not get any burnt rice in my bowl. Flavor of the Spicy Pork Belly was great but a bit salty. SERVICE:I didn't notice anything special. They were friendly and punctual.AMBIANCE/DECORATION:Very cute and almost minimalist decorations. However, it is a very small restaurant... I felt almost claustrophobic in there. PRICE:Well, you know me, I had a hard time admitting that bibimbap is $20 but I felt that the overall dish was delicious. I saw the dinner menu and noticed that it was even more expensive so I doubt I will be going there for dinner.",1,0,0,SuZie W.,"Baltimore, MD",161,30,75
4.0,4/20/2019,"Food wise I would have only given three stars - overall flavors were OK but they over spice everything - the extra star is for the ambience and service - both of which were great. I had the tasting menuSpicy yellowtail sashimi w. crispy potato flakes - this was probably my favorite - the texture of the fried daikon flakes went really well with the raw fish. tofu w. ginger scallion dressing - this was recommend by the waitress (when I was first looking at a la carte). Relative to expectations this was rather disappointing. It wasn't bad, but nothing really stood out other than the scallions which were very finely cut. The texture of the fried skin on the tofu was great but the sauce was way too salty, and tofu pieces relatively large so the middle parts had very little flavor. I also think they didn't spend enough time frying the tofu because the center was actually cold.Spicy k.f.c. korean fire chicken wings - flavor was fine but it was incredibly salty (wouldn't order if I was ordering a la carte)Bulgogi - could tell all the ingredients were super fresh, but it didn't taste any different from any other beef bulgogi you'd get at ktown (it was also too sweet for my taste)soy poached black cod w. spicy daikon, trio of kimchi, white rice - honestly the rice and kimchi trio tasted better than the cod. The cod was super tender but way too salty I ended up not eating most of it. The waitress was really sweet and offered to make me another one (hence the star for service)Ice cream - toasted rice(?) flavored. This was really good!They also refilled my wine without charge for apologies because of the cod, which was really kind of them.Overall, I think it's a decent place for a quick bite that's satisfactory, but it's not a place for a special meal by any means",0,0,0,May X.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",498,3,7

4.0,4/6/2019,"Still going strong, despite having been open for almost nine years! Such a great option for cozy, casual bites in Hell's Kitchen. The space is tight, and you should expect to be quite close to other diners. Some of the seating is at shared tables, but I think they try to avoid sitting one party right next to another, unless there's really no other choice. That being said, we didn't find it obtrusive, obviously not atypical for the city, and the atmosphere was fun and inviting. Food is awesome; would call the style something like Korean tapas. Menu is comprised of small, medium and large format plates. So, it's easy to make the experience whatever you'd like by mixing and matching. All our selections were very flavorful and generally unique. We had:-Tofu with Ginger Scallion Dressing (crispy tempura flakes & soy vinaigrette - $15): Pretty tasty for tofu. Between the tempura flakes and dressing, it has both nice texture and flavor. Just wish the pieces were a bit smaller to get more of the crispy exterior, as well as maneuver more easily with chopsticks.-Spicy Pork Belly Sliders (scallions, cucumber julienne & gochujang - $16): Very enjoyable, especially with the little kick from a slice of pepper and the gochujang. Fatty and moist, but not overwhelmingly so, the bun was light and airy.-Spicy 'KFC' Korean Fire Chicken Wings (d'artagnan organic chicken, peanuts, cilantro & pickled daikon - $18): Spicy, but not alarmingly so, and every bit worth the mess (don't worry they provide hand towels!). Great crunch - highly recommend!-'Danji' Braised Black Angus Short Rib (fingerlings,pearl onion, sweet potato purée, pine nuts - $44): Believe this is like the traditional Korean dish galbi jjim, but it has almost a Western sense about it. It's pretty rich, and between the potatoes and rice, quite filling. Flavors were well developed. Would probably order more small/medium plates instead of this next time, though.For drinks, if there is one thing we just have to get at Danji, it's the Spicy Ginger Margarita (corazon tequila, ginger, jalapeno, lime - $15). It's amazing, great balance and interesting without being overly contrived. Plus, it pairs nicely with the food, cutting through the fat and standing up to the spice. I could drink it any time!In terms of service, our waitress was attentive and great at guiding us through options and getting the right amount of food.Overall, a solid experience and we look forward to returning!",0,0,0,D.

This place came highly recommended. I was able to make a reservation for two on OpenTable and when we arrived, we were seated right away.I had done my research before and knew exactly what to order but there were other things that sounded just as delicious. If you're interested, I recommend Spicy Yellowtail, Bulgogi Beef Sliders, Korean Fried Chicken Wings, Hand Made Vegetable Dumplings, and Kimchi Bacon Spam Wet Rice.Everything was good but the best dishes hands down were the sliders, wings and the wet rice.  Just the rice alone would be worth a trip all the way to Hell's Kitchen!Anyway, try my recos and get ready to be full and cozy.

5.0,3/4/2019,"I came to Danji for brunch this past Sunday and had an excellent time.  My friends recommended this place as a great pre-theatre restaurant.  My girlfriend had the tofu and beef sliders- both were excellent .  I ordered the beef bimbimbop(?) which, honestly, was one of the best things I've ever had.  Our server, Sara, was great-- she confidently answered our many questions about the menu and kept us laughing throughout the meal.  We also watched her gracefully deal with a very rude and entitled table next to us... Props to her for being so patient and friendly...  I highly recommend Danji to anyone needing a quick and excellent bite before, or after the theatre.   I am very much looking forward to coming back for dinner and expanding my knowledge of Korean cuisine!",0,0,0,Ryann E.,"Denver, CO",0,2,0
1.0,3/4/2019,"If you are expecting authentic Korean food, don't go this place! Don't even try! Worst Korean place ever. I am korean and reserved this place for trying Michelin star korean food while I was traveling nyc. The restaurant gives you the foods that is not korean food at all and says it's korean foods. Everything was extremely salty and taste not right. I ordered full-course menu and every each dish was soooooo disappointed. Worst part was chicken wing. It was just American hot wing and not even taste better than other common wing franchises.

5.0,2/25/2019,"In a city like New York where there are countless restaurants, it's rare when you want to go to the same restaurant twice. However, when the food is that good you can't help but come back for more. Danji is a small and intimate restaurant which provides a unique spin on korean food. Due to the size of the restaurant, I would suggest limiting your party size to 4 people. Our group ordered off the restaurant week menu, but all items are available on the regular menu. The restaurant also offers a sizeable ""Favorites Tasting"" menu which can be adjusted to the party size. Now, let's talk specifics. The Korean fire wings are finger licking good. The name says it all so if you can't handle spice, this may not be for you. Although moderately spicy, the flavor is phenomenal so I would recommend getting an order to share (which is 7-8 wings) and at least trying one! Next, balance the fire with some sliders. Yes, we're still taking appetizers. Each order comes with 2 sliders which are more than a mouthful. We ordered the pork belly and bulgogi sliders which were both quite tasty. For the entrees we indulged in the bacon wet kimchi fried rice, spicy soft tofu stew with seafood, and the soy-poached black cod w. spicy daikon. The wet fried rice could have been a little wetter. Our favorite of the night was definitely the cod which was packed with flavor. For dessert we got the green tea sorbet and the toasted rice ice cream. I was envious of my friends who ordered the toasted rice cream as it was definitely the winner of the two. All in all, Danji was a great find for restaurant week. I definitely plan on coming back to try the tasting menu!",0,0,0,Sloan R.,"Berkeley, CA",0,5,6

5.0,2/15/2019,"Korean Tapas - Amazing Gem in Hell's KitchenAs a resident of Hell's Kitchen and a lover of all forms of Asian cuisine, I'm always searching for innovative, less touristy restaurants in the neighborhood to try. In my experience, Korean food - particularly those found in K-town - seems to be segmented into two flavor profiles: traditional Korean and KBbq. Naturally, I was excited to see a more up-scale fusion-style Korean tapas restaurant in my neighborhood.I've been two Danji twice, and both experiences do not disappoint (I'd compare it to Method, a Japanese inspired fusion spot also in Hell's Kitchen). The flavors are authentic without being overly experimental or excessive. The dishes have nuanced flavor profiles - you can savor each bite as you eat your way down the tasting menu, aware of how much thought was put into the details of each dish. The location/interior is small but not necessarily claustrophobic. It's great for catching up with close friend or a date at the bar / small table. I wouldn't recommend it for large groups. I'll break this review down by the most memorable individual dishes I've tried and my thoughts on them. The first time, I did the tasting menu. The second time, I opted for a la carte.Soju: I've tried a few of the soju options on the menu, and I'd definitely recommend the peach soju. It packs a palatable (and rather potent) sweetness that accompanies Korean flavors nicely. If you can't stand sweet/fruity drinks, I'd probably suggest a dryer option. Sashimi with potato flakes: The sashimi is great, but I have mixed feelings about the potato flakes. It adds a nice saltiness, but it can be almost overwhelming (i.e. sashimi with a side of potato chips)Tofu with ginger scallion dressing: This might be my FAVORITE item - great taste and texture.Bulgogi Beef Slider: Another solid choice. Not exactly the most innovative dish, but the meat is delicate, tender, and juicy. Pork belly slider is also tasty.Probably skip: Ginger scallion pancake and ""kfc"" chicken wings. Both items are verge on being too oily and are not as creative as other dishes on the menu. You can probably skip them.Ice Cream: There's something about the ice cream's texture and almost savory flavor profile that makes it almost addicting. It's rich and has a stretchy, elastic-like quality that bends around your spoon. I don't quite recall what the flavor was (sesame?), but it was delicious.",2,0,1,Anushka M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",320,14,18

Which was fine. So i go to a bar close by and spent $40. 30 minutes passes and I call to find out where i was on the list. She then tells me it's another hour  because she had a party waiting with reservations. How did she not factor this in when she told me 715 estimate? Wasn't I waiting too? And spent money at a bar.I decided to leave the bar and go someplace to eat. While in the cab, I get a call from Amanda 15 minutes later that the bar seats are opened. Wow. Great job.

3.0,2/8/2019,"Location: Danji is a small crowded place where without reservation it's hard to dine in. It's in the heart of Hell's Kitchen on the 52nd street. Food: had their beef slide, kfc chicken wings, and bacon wet fried rice. I would say, all of them are disappointed. One of the most obvious reason is that all dishes are too salty. ( I guess I should wine it up to balance it out ?)And because of the saltiness, lots of texture are gone. Service: bartender seems to be the only one actually care about customers.

3.0,2/4/2019,Slightly above average Korean food.  Soy garlic wings have good flavor but prefer to have the texture more crispy.  The pickles didn't complement the chicken well.  The shrimp and scallion pancake was fried well.  The sauce of the black cod overwhelmed the fish and the daikon was marinated for too long.  The beef short rib was very good - very tender in a nice stew.,0,0,0,Lauren H.,"New York, NY",3,127,296

2.0,1/22/2019,"Restaurant Week Winter 2019 Review.With RW starting on a holiday/MLK Day, I thought it'd be a great day to dine out - despite the blistering cold temperatures outside, and Danji seemed like a equidistant place from me and a friend I was meeting. Armed with my massive parka, I braved the elements...and my heart sort of sank when I arrived to see that the staff and many patrons were still wearing their coats...inside the restaurant.Yup...heating issues. But we were already there, already 7:30, and already hungry and cold.  The service was fairly attentive, but not super helpful when it came to suggestions or recommendations. We ended up choosing:Apps:spicy 'k.f.c' korean fire chicken wings (d'artagnan organic chicken, peanuts,  cilantro & pickled daikon) - the tang/spice was alright, and I liked the peanut-sprinkling, but the wings are pretty heavy on the breading and a wee bit light on the meat/size. bulgogi beef slider w spicy pickled cucumber & scallion salsa - the flavor was there, but again, wished there was a bit more substances on the beef front to justify the size of the slider bun. But tasty.Mains:kimchi bacon wet fried rice with soft scrambled egg, bossam gravy - my friend got this...and, well, it seemed a bit underwhelming. bits of bacon in rice with some kimchi and some egg on top. Oh, and this was brought out about 4 mins before my dish was due to appear. Not awkward...spicy soft tofu stew w. seafood 'busan bouillabaise' - I was freezing (and a little schvitzy from the wings, so then doubly cold), so I had to go for this. It was served up hot (thank god) and hearty - good amount of tofu with a moderate amount of seafood (primarily shrimp).Dessert:Ice Cream! ...lol, I sh*t you not. The only option. That said, I did sample some of the black sesame, because...when ice cream is in front of me...primal instincts take over.  It was fine...but really not the evening to really enjoy it.Do I think I could have like Danji more if I wasn't freezing most of the time?

Food was good, but the price was high.  We started with the KFC wings and the dumplings.  The wings were tasty, albeit indulgent.  The wings themselves were small, which I don't mind and makes me feel like they are coming from a real chicken.  They are breaded in some way, which I'm never a fan of.  I understand its a thing with KFC but for the flavour it wasn't worth the extra calories.  The dumplings looked amazing, beautifully fried.  Otherwise they were fine.  For the mains, they only have bibimbap at lunch.  I had the beef 'special' which means it came in a cast iron skillet with raw egg.  Really really good meat and a  good portion.  It seemed small, but I actually was very full by the end.  The best part about it is that they must put some sort of fat in the bottom of the skillet before they dump in the rice as the base of the dish.  The result is that when it comes to you, the bottom layer of the rice has already formed this delicious crispy layer.  It was so good that I was struggling to resist eating it before it cooled.",0,0,1,Danielle B.,"Murray Hill, Manhattan, NY",355,161,8

While I think I do prefer Hanjan due to some of the location specific items, Danji is equally as delicious. Some of my favorites include the spicy rice cakes and the bulgogi beef sliders. The spicy rice cakes have a crunch on the outside and are chewy inside. They are quite a unique dish that I've not had anywhere else. I like their trio of kimchi sides, however it is unusual for a Korean restaurant to charge for these items. The service was great and our waiter was very knowledgable about the food items and how much we should order.

5.0,12/4/2018,"Amazing inventive Korean food in Hell's Kitchen. We walked in on a Saturday night and only waited 15 min at the bar until we were seated - the cocktails were delicious (and strong!), and I totally recommend the O-ee cocktail.You have the option of either the fixed ""Danji favourites"" menu which includes just their most popular picks, or choosing your own plates. We opted for the latter and ordered the bulgogi sliders, rice cakes with Berkshire sausage, kimchi poutine, and kfc style wings, with a trio of banchan accompanying it all. I wish the banchan were complimentary like at traditional Korean places, but everything was incredible. The bulgogi sliders are a crowd favourite for a reason, and my boyfriend and I LOVED the spicy rice cakes! The poutine wasn't cheesy/curdy like we were expecting, but there's a huge amount of fries and it's extremely filling (also very good).Between the two of us we finished everything and were absolutely stuffed and groaning at the end. The waiter had told us that our number of dishes was ""a good amount of food"", but it was definitely too much in a good way.

They did not have dessert menu. They only had ice cream. It was "" toasted rice ice cream"" so weird... it tasted like rice, but it was ice cream... main course was ok. The place is WAY overpriced. We spent 170$ on the meal for 2 with only 2 glasses of wine. Usually, in place like that you spend like 120$ tops.

I would say this is a lot of food for one so come VERY hungry hahaaSpicy yellowtail sashimi- was a good start, light and fresh, good flavor, and topped with a crunch. Tofu with ginger scallion- also good. Soft of the inside with a slight crisp on the outside. A little towards the saltier side. Bossam- strips of tender pork made for wrapping. They give you thin slices of radish to wrap the meat. I personally am not a huge fan of bossam in general but my friend was raving about how good this one was. Spicy Korean Fried Chicken- spicy and slightly sweet. A side of vinegared cubed radish that I thought tasted a little weird Crispy and well flavored. They give you hand wipes so feel free to get dirty ;) Sliders: Bulgogi in between two buns. Standard, nothing amazing. Soy-poached black cod- my personal favorite. Served with a side of white rice, this was so flavorful and the fish melts in the best way possible. If I could get just one dish, this was be it. Highly recommend. Also one of their healthier options! Kimchi- Oh my. This is what docked the points for sure. Objectively the worst kimchi I have ever had (as a Korean too). It was soggy and had a weird taste. All three were no good. Ice cream- black sesame ice cream. They have a sorbet option if you can have dairy! Was good, if you like black sesame.",0,0,0,Ellen P.,"New York, NY",280,19,69
2.0,11/12/2018,"This is the story of a girl: who cried a river and drowned the seafood pancake. Danji was recommended to me, originally, 3 years ago when I moved into the neighborhood. At the time, an intimate space with delicious Korean tapas - bulgolgi, japchae, kim chi fried rice. When my Korean friend suggested we have a high school reunion here, we were all excited. Instead, we were met with a 40 minute delay to our 8pm reservation with little to no space to wait in the entrance way. After half an hour, we did appreciate a round of drinks on the house; however, the nice gesture could not make up for the rest the poor night.I will say: the food was quite good. The fatty short ribs, garlic tofu, and seafood pancake were highlights. Unfortunately, the staff broke the pancake dish and the oh so sweet sauce was rendered on clothes instead of taste buds.Two stars. One for food and one for ambiance.

Tofu w/ scallion ginger dressing: tofu coated in a thin skin which added a nice texture. Excellent starter Fire veg dumplings - unbelievably good. Spicy. Get these. Spicy rice cake - I'm not usually a fan of Korean rice cakes but this one hit it out of the park. Pan-fried so they had a crispy exterior and were soft/chewy on the inside.

It's sashimi wrapped around a veggie salad made with gochujjang; absolutely delicious. The Bulgogi Beef Sliders came next and were equally yummy. Soft buns and flavorful beef. We finished with the Kimchi Poutine, but unfortunately it didn't deliver like the other dishes. The fries were like McDonald's cut and the ""poutine"" had no gravy consistency or melted cheese.

The wings were delicious, especially with the toppings. The radish on the side was too tart, though.The bulgogi beef sliders (spicy pickled cucumber & scallion salsa) was just meh for me.The big korean breakfast (kimchi cured bacon, spam, two fried eggs, sauteed kimchi & rice) was actually quite good, I wouldn't mind this for breakfast.The spicy pork bibim-bap (traditional korean rice bowl w. marinated vegetables, jidori fried egg & gochujang spicy sauce) was not at all spicy.The bulgogi chul-sot bibim-bap (sizzling hot w. crispy rice socarrat w. marinated vegetables, jidori fried egg & gochujang spicy sauce) did not have as crispy a rice as the big korean breakfast, though I believe it's supposed to have.

The only thing was it was a bit of a messy ordeal, but still very satisfied. Our large dish was the star of the show though, and I liked how it was meant to be shared. We got the danji braised black angus short rib with fingerlings, pearl onion, sweet potato puree, and pine nuts. I can't repeat enough how wonderful this dish was. The meat was so tender and just fell apart in your mouth. It was juicy and had all the right flavors. I took a star off because the space itself is very small, and if you're one of the unlucky ones, your seat will be jam packed and squished next to the neighbors next to you. They do have individual larger tables, but for the most part they have long horizontal tables that are shared amongst various dinner parties.

I was not happy with this and asked the host what we could do to get a table for two. She said that there were none available and it would be about an hour for a table for two. There was one empty barstool at the bar but plenty of extra space so I asked the host if she could move one of the stools from the communal table and she was able to do that.

For the very expensive price you would think they'd try to mimic the sweet and savory flavor that is so well known even tacos can provide. The wings were very well executed but once again failed to be remotely Korean fire chicken which is a real Korean dish but it seems this place didn't do any research on Korean food and is attempting to profit off a trend. While tasty, the wings are unremarkable and have no relation to Korean flavors or Korean fire chicken.

We also ordered the ""crispy"" tofu salad which was more like a packed salad of mesclun, some wishbone dressing, and mushy, stringy, fried tofu.The bulgogi sliders were reheated bulgogi with thousand island dressing and some juliened green onions.The korean big breakfast was basically the kimchi fried rice without being mixed together and some bacon with slices of spam on the side. Otherwise, the same ingredients, flavor, and runny eggs sunny side up.My husband said that the makoli was the highlight. Its hard to mess up bottled makoli. Overall, overhyped, overpriced.

Seemed like they were made ahead of time since they were kind of cold, too.-Garlic honey wings with sesame seeds: 3.5/5. Pretty good! Also a little cold but it had the right flavors. Nothing above average. Some pieces were more crispy than others but the overall chicken was pretty juicy.-Miso black cod: 4/5. This was my favourite dish of the night! The sauce that came with it was to die for - probably why I liked the dish so much. The cod itself was perfectly cooked as well and was very tender.-Braised short ribs: 3.5/5. Kind of a bland dish but the ribs were braised nicely and did fall off the bone. Didn't have much flavor compared to the cod but that's probably because the cod had the sauce and the ribs were more of a dry dish.

Secondly, the shrimp/scallion pancake was deep fried and leaking oil like a broken down Cadillac. We wouldn't have ordered that if we had known it was deep fried. The kimchi trio and egg over rice were fine, but I could have gone to the grocery store and bought it for less money, and it would have tasted better. Our waiter spoke minimal English, was slightly degrading when we asked about the menu, and didn't know the address of the restaurant (he did get us a business card with the address on it)...

4.0,7/18/2018,"Well picture a conflicted restaurant who wants to be Korean, but had to cater to the theatre crowd...Very cool space with a couple of cool high top community table, and a handful of tables.The food was very nice; it is an interesting blend of Korean inspired tapas dishes. The Korean side is understated, and does not do justice to the explosive fresh flavors Korean food has to offer.The execution is very high, with the exception of the pork belly sliders. Some the the best calamari we have had in a long time...We focused on the small plates, so I cannot comment on the other stuff. The manager recommended the Cod and Banchan.They have a very limited desert selection, and no coffee or, more surprisingly, tea...This is a wonderful Korean experience for the more ""conservative"" (unexperienced) palates.Being from CA, and having lived with a Korean for a few years, I am a little biased.",0,0,1,John L.,"Greenbrae, CA",0,8,0

3.0,7/5/2018,"My friend and I visited here last Wednesday night. I've been craving for a fine Korean dining so we decided to chose this place; Danjo had many good ratings and holds Micheline star. The restaurant was smaller than I expected but it was intimate and romanic in a way. The interior of the restaurant was nicely decorated. The high table area was modernly designed with wooden table with  small drawers that had their menu and small hooks underneath to hang your stuff. The staffs were considerate and attentive. Our glasses were refilled with water even before we asked. They also provide wet towelettes when you order wings.We decided to order two small plates and one medium plate. We ordered bulgogi slider, chicken wings and tofu with scallion and ginger dressing. The platings of the food were nicely decorated but the portion was smaller. When I had the first bite of our tofu, I was bit disappointed. I expected tofu to be more silky and soft but it was just like any other typical tofu dish I would had in any Korean restaurants. The dressing was also bit salty. I think it would have been better with some rice. Then, we got our bulgogi slider, which I thought the portion was small for $9 per slider. It had buttered buns with bulgogi topped with cucumber. I was, again, disappointed after a bite. I don't think it was much different from bulgogi that they sell at Hmart. Bulgogi was also bit salty. Chicken wings were lot better than the slider or the tofu dish. The sauce was pretty good but the size was of the wings was small.I am Korean and of course I eat homemade Korean meals everyday. I can be bit picky when it comes to Korean cuisine because I have the best, authentic dishes. I know this place is a fusion Korean cuisine so I expected something to be different, especially for their price which is pricier than other Korean restaurant. Unfortunately, it was not that special. I felt like I can go somewhere else where I can pay the same price and get bigger portion.",2,0,0,Sara H.,"Fort Lee, NJ",292,59,92
4.0,7/5/2018,"As a Korean, I had to visit a restaurant with Michelin star that serves Korean cuisine.The restaurant itself was compact but nicely decorated, and the service was great.As for the menu, I had some mixed feelings about few things.Kimchi Fried Rice (Gratin) - I understand that the food was made as a Gratin, but the flavor of the cheese was too dominant and so I wasn't able to taste the kimchi. Maybe this is because I'm not used to the strong flavor from cheese.Daikon Soup - The soup was great and probably this was my famous dish out of all. If I could get a bowl of rice, I would've had that as my main.Korean Big Breakfast? Can't remember the name but.. - This is actually a dish that I do not want to recommend. There is nothing special to this dish and if you are to try Korean dish for the first time, you should try something different.Bibimbap - I actually loved bibimbap here because the red pepper paste that they served was unique and well-balanced (not too spicy and salty like the other commercial pepper paste). Vegetables and meat were perfectly seasoned.Poke Bowl - They had their unique approach to the bowl and the texture was very interesting. I wouldn't say that this is a Korean menu but it definitely had a Korean touch to it.",0,0,0,Wesley C.,"Roanoke, VA",91,14,25
4.0,7/5/2018,My husband and I went here before seeing HAMILTON last Friday night. Made reservation a few days before. The restaurant is small so seating is tight. The menu choices are limited but all very very tasty. We ordered based on a friends recommendations. (Thanks Paul) The Japache and braised short ribs were our favorites. The flavors in the japache were addictive. The short ribs were so good I really didn't want to share it with my husband. The Bassam is a wrap it yourself dish. I'm not a big fan of rice cakes.

5.0,7/3/2018,"Damn! One of the best Korean restaurants in NY I've been to. Hands down! Bold statement but it left me wanting more. Is it pricier than most Korean prices? Yes. But the farm to table and quality of the food is top notch. It's tapa style so it's meant to be shared. Two dishes per person is just right. Walked in 10 minutes after opening and barely got a seat at the bar. Highly recommend reservations. The spicy pork sliders! Wow. Perfectly moist all throughout and the balance of flavors was spot on. Spicy kick was the perfect spice level. Spicy yellowtail sashimi! Damn. Another perfectly executed dish. Variations of texture going on with the crunchy potato flakes, jalapeño and yellowtail. Overall hitting all flavor notes. Spicy rice cakes were also amazing. Crunchier bite than the average rice cake but still chewy at the same time. Great flavor profile going on here. The shrimp and scallion pancake was great. Fluffier than the average seafood pancake. Moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Just a damn good meal.",1,1,1,Jason G.,"Queens, NY",111,262,688
4.0,6/24/2018,Popular pre broadway spot. We came here before seeing sponge Bob and was told there weren't any tables available for 2 for the longest while so we added our name to the waitlist - but then luckily a couple finished early and we got a seat towards the back (but had to be out by 7:30 for their next reservation).That was fine by us. They have these cute small tables with drawers that they keep the menus in.The fried chicken was really good. We also got some pickled veg. I didn't like the poutine fries.

3.0,6/23/2018,"Don't get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with the food... well except for the fact that I didn't think there was anything particularly special about it. The fried chicken tasted like normal Korean fried chicken. The calamari tasted like normal calamari. Nothing surprised me... maybe it's because I wasn't choosing the correct things from the menu, but hey, if the menu is pretty limited, the check is going to come out pretty sizeable, and the restaurant advertises itself as fusion and innovative, I'm going to hold it to a higher standard. My friend got a cocktail and she said it was good, so maybe that's the star feature of this establishment. What did really catch my interest in this place is the environment. They keep the menus in drawers in the table, and the setting is super adorable. Everything is plated very well too. The ambiance is pretty romantic, and I would recommend it for dates if not for the fact it can get loud when it's really packed and you will have to sit next to other parties because of the way it's constructed. The tables are long. Also, if you get the fried chicken, they give you those towelettes to wipe your hands, which is super considerate. Loved that part. The staff here is also great, and let us stay after closing time, so thanks for that.

There is definitely a lack of Korean food in Hell's kitchen so it is nice to have the option. The brunch menu is separated into 2 sections- dishes to share, and entrees. We ordered fried tofu to share, which was delicious. Banchan is not free by the way, you need to order them. For my main course, I had the sizziling bibim-bap. There are several creative dishes such as Korean breakfast (kim cured bacon, fried egg, kimchi and rice) or huevos pajeon panckae.

5.0,4/29/2018,"Had dinner last night at Danji with two friends visiting from PA and we had a wonderful experience! From the moment I walked into the restaurant until our departure, we were well taken care of.It's a small plate type of restaurant so we ordered a bunch of different things and shared with each other. I only eat fish (pescatarian is what folks call it I guess) so I didn't indulge in all of the plates we ordered.I'll start with our drinks: I ordered a glass of white wine from South Africa  (Chenin Blanc, Backsberg, 2017) and it was very tasty! Mild flavored and not bitter Loved it! My friends had the Rosé and Shiso Lemonade. My friend that had the lemonade didn't enjoy it as much as she'd hope to because it wasn't sweetened enough. I didn't try it so I couldn't tell you more, but was presented very prettily!Now for the dishes we ordered: (1) fried calamari with spicy mayo & a wasabi sauce (2) spicy rice cake, berkshire sausage and noodles (3) shrimp & scallion pancake w. chili pepper and (4) bacon wet kimchi fried rice with soft scrambled egg + bossam gravy (which came out sizzling hot on the platter!!!). Everything came out pipin' hot, fresh, and beautifully presented!!!I was a HUGE fan of the fried calamari and the shrimp + scallion pancake. The sauces that came with the fried calamari were a hit. I usually stay clear of wasabi, but this one wasn't a death sentence--it was light on the fiery kick. The calamari was lightly battered and perfect! The shrimp + scallion pancake which is one large pancake cut up into 4 pieces was crispy, oily, but delicious. It wouldn't be as good had there been any less grease in it. It is a deep-fried dish so if anyone complains about the amount of oil in it, they should've gotten the salad and called it a day!Our waiter even took a photo of my friends at the end of our night, per our request, which was kind seeing as how we'd been there over 3 hours at that point dining at the bar; all up in his personal space.

And you want us to order our food when our table isn't even ready? When we take our seat at our table, the hostess gave us major ""you're idiots"" vibes when we asked for menus (they are in little drawers in the table). We ordered a bottle of wine and various dishes. Our server was wonderful but he soon disappeared. Each dish was delicious. Truly. The food was spectacular. The only turn off was the way we were treated once we ordered dessert. The check was dropped with the dessert. Ok. I'm a server. I get that you'd like to do the money. But we still had wine and had dessert. The new server came over and asked us to pay the bill, so we did. We're still finishing the wine when we were told they were closed. Yes, obviously. They had put all the chairs up, blown out all the candles. Oh, online it says they are open until 12. Guess that's not true...I might go back because it was so delicious but I'm not sure.

I've tried their various bibimbap options and the chul-sot bulogi bibimbap, which comes sizzling hot with crispy rice soccarat is delicious. I am also a big fan of the spicy gochujang bolognese noodles with bacon, kimchi and a soft boiled egg. In addition to the food, the ambiance and space get a solid A+ and is nicely complemented by a generally chic clientele. Danji is rather tiny, but it leans more towards ""cozy"" rather than uncomfortable and stands in vast contrast to the typical Midtown crowds full of tourists and power suits.

4.0,2/14/2018,"Overall: 4.5/5Service: 4/5Ambience: 4/5Food: 4.5/5Danji is for sure a solid restaurant. I came here with a friend for restaurant week and we walked out pretty satisfied. Between the two of us, we got the spicy kfc Korean fire chicken wings, pork belly sliders, soy-poached black cod, braised black Angus short ribs, sesame ice cream, and toasted rice ice cream. Chicken wings: these were pretty good. The spice factor wasn't immediate... more of a slow burn that came later on. The chicken was cooked really well and was super juicy. I only wish that the skin was a little crispier. Pork belly sliders: I thought these were also delicious though my friend thought the pork was a little dry. I loved the flavours in the sliders and how the sweet, spicy, and savoury all came together like a party in my mouth.Soy-poached black cod: Eat with rice. Taking into account the sauce, I think it's a little strong on its own, so it ought to be eaten with the rice. The daikon was soft and the fish was cooked extremely well. It was almost surreal to have such smooth and supple fish literally melt in my mouth.Short ribs: Similar to the cod, the short ribs were also cooked amazingly well. The meat fell off the bones easily and was easy to chew through. The meat fell apart (in a totally good way) and made my stomach super happy. It paired well with the veggies on the side. Also similar to the cod, the short ribs had a ton of flavour and I often times had to take a bite or two of rice to ready my mouth for the next bite.Ice cream: a simple yet delicious way to end the meal. I enjoyed my toasted rice ice cream and could definitely pick out that flavour (though my friend said that it just tasted like vanilla with bits of toasted rice -- and maybe that's really all it was).Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed each course and I liked the space and decor of the restaurant. True to New York standards, it was a bit small, but they made it work, though sitting on tall stools made it difficult to hang coats (they also have coat hooks on the wall but more so near the entrance than at the tall table where we were seated) and place my purse/bag next to me on the ground. I think Danji is a great contemporary Korean restaurant and provides a good basis for someone to enter into Korean cuisine if they have never had it before. It's also good for someone looking for something a little more unique but still in the realm of Korean food. They have a wide range of items on their permanent menu, but don't come here looking for traditional Korean fare.",1,0,1,Phoebe L.,"New York, NY",476,19,10
4.0,2/8/2018,"Really lovely, delicious food. We came for restaurant week and had everything that was pescatarian. The fish was perfectly poached, the seafood stew was very flavorful, and the scallion pancakes were the best I've ever had. The ice cream was satisfying but nothing mind blowing, although I had never tasted black sesame in ice cream so that was a treat. I do wish they had tried something a little more complex with the dessert. We were so full we couldn't finish. If we hadn't been off to see a show I would have boxed it up. The only downside is that the seating is very cramped. We should have stayed at the bar. Unless you have an individual table you will bump elbows with someone. Definitely not a place for the bigger boned person. Despite the tight fit, the interior is very cute and cozy and the service was accommodating and warm.",0,0,0,Bea L.,"Crown Heights, NY",0,342,0
5.0,2/7/2018,"Danji is my favorite restaurant I ate at during my recent trip to New York. It's a small, cozy, environment with only a few seats so I definitely recommend planning ahead with a reservation (we only got a seat right away because someone had canceled theirs). I loved the feel of the space and the food matched it in the best way. Dishes are served family style, and my family and I decided to get the tasting menu which made ordering fairly easy. The waiter recommended the tasting menu for simplicity as well as value ($56/person).Tofu w/ginger scallion dressing: A simple dish but perfectly executed - crunchy tofu with flavorful crispy tempura flakes and a great sauce at the bottom. These dishes are all decent sizes that are perfect for sharing with 3 people.Bossam: This dish was something I had never tried before - while it may not be unique to this restaurant, the pork was extremely flavorful and the wrappings of the daikon and kimchi added the necessary crunch and acidity.Yellowtail Sashimi w. crispy potato flakes: Fresh fish (on the softer side of the palate) accompanied with crispy potato flakes addresses a variety of great textures. However, I am not sure if they are necessarily logical or cohesive when put on the same plate because they are still separated into different components.Garlic honey wings w. sesame seeds: I am a huge fan of Korean fried chicken and friend garlic - their combination is perfection. The coating on the outside of the crunchy skin was sticky and sweet, and although messy, tasted amazing. However, it is a mess, so I'm glad they provided wet towels for our fingertips.Spicy pork belly sliders: these had a nice kick and I loved the gochujang sauce - it paired perfectly with the tender pork belly and the softer slider bun. Soy-poached Black Cod w Spicy Daikon: This dish was my favorite out of all the other dishes. The cod was perfectly cooked, and melted in my mouth, while the accompanying spicy daikon paired perfectly with the flavor of the sauce. While the cod is light, the sauce adds the richer, darker flavor to the dish.'Danji' braised black angus short rib w. fingerlings, pearl onion, sweet potato purée, pin nuts: the short rib was super tender, although it did not feel as special to me as the black cod - I don't see it as super unique Danji.These two dishes also came with a trio of kimchi and banchan, that were delicious and had a good selection of different flavors.At the end, we were served two types of ice cream - I loved the sesame flavor and was unsure what the other flavor was (but it was not as good).",0,0,1,Amy H.,"Houston, TX",6,38,74

We were blown away.I ordered the kfc chicken wings and the kimchi bacon wet rice. The wings blew me away with their flavor. Spicy, but not too spicy. I wanted to lick my fingers even when I had finished. The rice was delicious paired with the trio of kimchi. The egg was a bit overdone, but surprisingly didn't take away from the flavor of the dish. My boyfriend had the bulgolgi beef sliders and the braised short rib. He said his sliders were some of the best sliders he had ever tasted. He loved the short rib as well and commented how it just fell off the bone. For $42 per person, this was the best meal we've had for our Restaurant Week adventures. But we did get to see the normal menu prices. They did seem high to us, but they have a $60 pre fixe menu that offered a sampling of their best dishes.

However, my veggie bibimbap was a perfect size where I felt full enough to feel light post the meal.My friend ordered the 3-course set menu for $29 and was pretty happy with that too!I'd recommend making a reservation here because this place gets really busy.

2.0,2/1/2018,"Get there few minutes before my reservation time only to be told that the kitchen was closing in a few. No problems with that. But going forward, please don't take reservation right up to before your kitchen closes. For future visitors, I saw that the last reservation time Danji offers is 3PM. Kitchen closes few minutes before that (at least based on what staff told us). Dumplings were surprisingly okay (not greasy, perfect stuffing). Dumpling sauce and wings, however, were disappointing. Too salty for my taste. Bibimbap is good, but it's not good enough to be that price. You can get much better and cheaper bibimbap at K-town. Don't get kimchi fried rice. It's poorly done and over-sauced. The layout and design of Danji is cute and homely. Spoon-filled wall separators and cute drawers under each table to store menus. The walls are layered with traditional Korean-style roof tiles. Unfortunately, I couldn't enjoy my meal in this ambiance because the staff was in a hurry to rush people out. Plates were cleared from my table (even though there was still food on it!). Sure, they ""asked"" if we were done but they already had the plate in their hands). Staff tidied and cleared nearby tables with a ruckus. If it was one or two of us left, I wouldn't mind. We all want to be done with our shift.

5.0,2/1/2018,"My dinner here was truly amazing. A unique dining experience from start to finish. First, there is a drawer underneath the table that opens with the menu which I loved. My friend is a regular so I followed his suggestions. We started with the tofu with ginger scallion dressing. The tofu was so soft it almost tasted like cheese and it came with a light, crispy Panko topping and sweet sauce. We then moved on to the bossam - braised pork belly which was fun and simply fantastic. You wrap the tender pork belly in daikon and layer it with scallion and Kim chi and it's so fun and delicious. Next we got the spicy kfc chicken wings. I really feel like that was the highlight of the meal as the wings were hot, crisp, and just the right blend of sweet and spicy. We ended with the braised short rib which comes with a brontosaurus portion of meat over some onions and fingerling potatoes with rice. The meat is melt in your mouth delicious and you will find yourself full get ready for more.

4.0,1/29/2018,"Came here last week with 3 friends for Restaurant Week and we had a really good dinner. 2 of us arrived first and they made us wait because they only seat complete parties even though the place was empty. After we told them that we had a Broadway show to catch and that we would be ready to order right away, they were able to give us our table. The place is quite small and we were lucky to get one of the 4-ish actual tables they had (the rest were tall communal tables or bar seating). The menus were hidden inside a little drawer under the table. We ordered quickly since the choices for RW were limited. A friend and I shared our food and we got the garlic honey wings and pork belly sliders for apps, and the soy-poached black cod and braised short rib ($8 supplement) for entrees. The wings were crispy and sticky and sweet, and came with little cubes of pickled daikon on the side. The sliders were sooo good! Good portion of pork belly and so flavorful. Our entrees came with rice and 3 different kimchis. The cod was universally loved by our table. Perfectly cooked and flavors were on point. The short rib was equally delicious, very tender. The portions were very generous! For dessert they only had ice cream and they brought out 2 vanilla and 2 black sesame ice creams for us. I had told the hostess that it was my 3 friends' birthdays that week and they put little candles on theirs. The ice cream was really yummy but I do wish they had more options for dessert.

1.0,1/28/2018,"Totally disappointing.. Went in for restaurant week to give this place a try since it had a Michelin star before.  Should have known from the dull menu it would be underwhelming.  Decided on giving Danji a shot though because just maybe everything is so expertly crafted.  Nope.. Every detail was lacking! First, my chair was wobbling.  Nbd.. This old man enjoys his rocking chair from time to time.  Ordered the KFC wings and fried tofu for apps.  The wings were bland and already getting cold.  I've had better Korean style wings at Picnic garden in Queens sitting in a hot plate for God knows how many hours.  The tofu had good flavor but the texture of the batter was too gummy.  Rather get age tofu at just about any Japanese restaurant anywhere.  For entrees we got the dol sot bibimbap and pajeon juevos rancheros.  The bibimbap comes in a greasy cast iron skillet with overcooked, oily and soggy, ""Crispy"" white rice. Amateur hour with the crispy rice.. How hard is it to make a nice crust of rice on the bottom of a hot skillet or stone bowl?  Not very.  The bibimbap veg was prepped nicely but pretty bland overall.  Also, they didn't make anything interesting..  If I wanted the same basic bibimbap veg variety from hmart I would have went there.  Egg was hammered beyond belief.  I need some runny yolk to go with the gochujang they forgot..Kimchi trio was forgettable and didn't add much to the meal.

1.0,1/28/2018,"Worse than expected - no better than supermarket bought bibimbap toppings on white rice, nothing luxurious or interesting about it. For 22 bucks I hoped for much more innovation like hard to make banchan and/or mutigrain rice. And what's with the skillet - throw it in a beautiful stone bowl! Egg on top was overdone with a stiff chewy yucky yolk. Even after getting the gochujang they forgot it still tasted dry and overly sweet. Good thing it was restaurant week cuz no way you should pay the full price for this. Dessert was store bought ice cream....I mean there are so many beautiful korean desserts and they choose...ice cream? Is this a corner sushi bar? Ok now the juevos rancheros: so like yeah Mexican goes well worth korean flavors but this was just confusing. A crispy fried green onion pancake literally drowning in what tasted like store bought salsa...and at the bottom of the soggy pancake underneath the hard fried egg you find a nice surprise of what might easily be 10 canned beans and a handful of rock hard...beef cubes? This 20 dollar dish wasn't even worth the presentation. Won't be going back unfortunately.",1,1,1,Danbi L.,"Toronto, Canada",64,36,58
4.0,1/21/2018,"As Danji is very convenient to all the Broadway theaters, we went here pre-theater for dinner. We had made a reservation on Opentable, but contrary to other reviews, they did not sandwich us at a long table with bar stools. We were seated in the back at in the row of tables. I took the booth side against the wall and my husband took the regular chair. The server asked us if we had a show to see afterwards so they could pace the meal accordingly. Started out with the yellowtail sashimi. Pretty interesting with the potato flakes. Good flavor from the jalapeno and the gochujang sauce. Overall, liked this dish. Next, we had the Korean fire wings. Great crunch and flavor, however, hardly spicy and not very meaty. Came with daikon. Still liked. The sweet potato japchae was very good. Couldn't tell it was anything other than classic japchae though. Not sure if that's a great thing or a bad thing. Pork belly sliders we're good enough and we scarfed them done happy to see they had enough meat on them. The kimchi trio was good. The kimchi didn't have as much pungent kick as I'm used to, but still overall a good flavor. You get the cucumber, cabbage, and daikon in the trio. The shrimp and scallion pancake was great. Nice and thick with large pieces of shrimp. Texture is crispy on the bottom and top, but softer in the middle with the goodies. Sauce comes on the side so you can dip to your liking. Oh, definitely order the shiso lemonade. Tasted just like the yuzu drinks I've had in Japan. Very refreshing to pair with heavier dishes. My husband had sake, which they had a good selection of. Finished out with sesame ice cream and toasted rice ice cream. Both were subtle in flavoring, but very creamy. The sesame one was a little more interesting than the toasted rice one, which reminded me too much of vanilla at times. Might try the pear sorbet next time. Overall, we will eat here again. Value isn't the best, but I like the vibe of the restaurant with the Edison style light bulbs and simple decor. Korean music played not too loudly and the service was excellent.

After doing so, and being informed that our table wouldn't be ready for a little bit, we decided to take a good look around the area. The place is very small.

Once seated, we had to look around to discover that our menus are inside a small drawer in the table. We did take a liking to the way the  was laid out.After getting some complimentary glasses of water, we were kindly greeted by our server. He gave us extra time to look over the menus, and answered questions we had. Very importantly, we asked how many plates he thought are appropriate to order for two people (he said six!). We ordered three different plates to share.Notably, the place was very loud. Not because of the music, but because of the people. The food came out rather quickly which was nice. Each dish was good enough to share, and packed incredible flavor . We looked around at other people's plates too, and found they enjoyed their meals just as much as we did.Overall, very nice and different experience. The service was great, as was the food.

It was so buttery and melted in my mouth--not too heavy either.Korean fire chicken wings (5 stars): I don't even like wings and I could have kept eating these all night. They were cooked perfectly and the sauce they are cooked with was delicious.Slider of the day--bulgogi (4 stars): These weren't huge, but they packed a lot of flavor.Soy-poached cod (4.5 stars): This cod was cooked perfectly and paired nicely with the daikon. It was also a very generous portion size as well.Short rib with root vegetables (5 stars): By the time this came out, we were pretty stuffed, but we couldn't resist. This dish was so tasty and tender, we had no problem polishing it all off.Ice cream--toasted rice and taro (4 stars): I really enjoyed the dessert portion of the meal, with a preference for the toasted rice flavor and it was a perfect finish to the meal.The tasting was also served with rice, three types of banchan, and three types of kimchi which were great to be able to taste and pair with some of the dishes.Overall, this is one of the best meals I have had in New York City. From the first dish, to the last, this place repeatedly hit high marks with presentation and flavor. In addition, the fact that this tasting rings up at only $56 per person, easily makes it one of the best deals in the city--as we had plenty of food and couldn't even finish each course.

The fish melts in your mouth and has the perfect level of flavor so that the butteriness of the fish is highlighted and not over taken. - Sweet potato noodles: I didn't know what to expect with this, but it had the perfect japchae texture and was chock full of flavor.

The restaurant is relatively small with two long communal tables and more seating further back. My husband and I usually aren't fans of communal tables but we were very comfortable throughout the entire meal.We ordered quite a bit for two, but it was our anniversary so why not! First to the table was the trio of kimchi, trio of banchan and the bossum. The trios are amazing if you enjoy crunch, pickled veggies, sesame oil and a little heat. The bossum was my favorite dish last night. Fatty, nicely charred pork belly made into tasty bites with dried kimchi and scallion. Perfect. Next up were the bulgogi sliders, great quality meat and another simple, tasty few bites. We finally had a chance to breathe and digest bc the dishes do come out quickly, which I don't have a problem with. Better than sitting under a heat lamp.  Garlic wings were up next because my husband was too chicken to try the spicy ones lol but I loved it as well. Really crispy and great flavors. Last but not least we had the wet fried rice. We called this the ultimate hangover dish and after our anniversary celebration last night, wish we had this dish in Astoria! There's an addicting quality, no matter how full we were we just kept going back for more!Service was on point! We were greeted the minute we walked in, our water was always filled and they explained each dish that needed it, like what each kimchi was or how to create the perfect bite for the bossum. Also, my husband had the Kloud beer and I drank a spicy margarita.

3.0,11/6/2017,"I went with great expectations, but either I was being extra critical because I'm particular about Korean food (I grew up eating Korean food), or the food just didn't live up to what I anticipated. I had heard great things about this place, and especially because I'm a huge fan of chef Hooni Kim, I was ready to be blown away. Here is a breakdown of what I ordered:Tofu with ginger scallion dressing - This seemed to be the most popular appetizer as almost everyone in the restaurant ordered one. I also love tofu, and order age tofu at almost every Asian restaurant I go to, so I expected this tofu dish to be somewhat similar/better than ordinary age tofu. However, it was very okay. $12 for 4 pieces of not that crispy, but not that soggy textured tofu seemed like the tofu was having an identity crisis. Maybe it was because I had a particular vision in mind about what it was going to be like, but I've had cheaper, and better cooked tofu appetizers elsewhere. Bossam - I was so confused because I wasn't sure if the meat was supposed to have that much fat. Really good bossam usually has a great balance of both the tender meat and the chewy fat, but the thin slices of bossam that we got had more fat than the meat portion. Not to mention the portion size for $23 was not worth, I was pretty convinced that maybe they were just having a ""bad meat day"" the day I went. I'm willing to give this dish another try, because I love bossam, but I still do think it's very expensive for 6 pieces of thin sliced pork.Soy-poached black cod - Sal-ty. If it weren't for that bowl of white rice, I think I would've gulped down 2 more glasses of water. It was so unfortunate because the fish was cooked SO well, but the sauce was just so salty! I understand that you're supposed to have it with the white rice, and the rice is supposed to make the fish less salty, but the taste of the soy was so strong and overpowering that I couldn't appreciate the really soft texture of the fish. It was also $32 for a small to medium sized cod, so I expected it to be much more special. Cocktails - These were actually great, and really well decorated. The bartender was friendly, but when I asked about his thoughts/recommendations on the menu, he always answered ""it depends on what you're in the mood for"", which I guess makes sense, but that clearly wasn't the answer I was looking for. Overall, I'm not sure that I would recommend this place to anyone looking for high quality Korean food. It's not cheap, so I left the restaurant wondering why everything had to be so expensive. If it was exceptional food, I really wouldn't have minded paying ~$150. I'm actually not quite sure why this place is so popular, but maybe my next visit would be a different experience - if I decide to give it another chance.",4,2,0,Lisa L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",385,62,678

4.0,10/2/2017,"I understand the previous reviewer's frustration but I can also see that the restaurant may have had their regular tables reserved by phone before the reviewer booked on Open table.  That is a downside of using the website.  My wife and I just ate at Danji at 8:00pm after booking it 2 hours before on Open Table.  The main dinner rush had settled and we were seated at the one remaining regular table for 2.  The shared tables with bar stools looked cramped and we wouldn't have enjoyed sitting there.  The food was really good and we'd go back.  The kimchi fried rice was the best I've had with a unique pork belly gravy sauce, small cubes of sausage, and a small amount of kimchi.  It was topped with soft scrambled egg.  We also ordered the KFC spicy wings and the japchae.  Both were very good too.  The service was average, but good at refilling our water.",0,0,0,Alex K.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,4,0
1.0,9/28/2017,"Unfortunately we didn't get to eat here, so this review is based on their customer service.My friend and I were meeting for dinner in Hells Kitchen and she recommended Danji. She proceeded to make a reservation on Open Table and we both arrived on time. The hostess showed us to our table - it was a communal table with backless stool seats (90% of the  restaurant was empty). My friend nicely explained that she had a back issue and wouldn't be able to sit on a stool. The hostess said that we could sit at one of the (many) empty tables but we would have to be done in  1 hour as they were all reserved.  We then explained that we were not walk-in's and that we did made a reservation. The hostess and eventually the manager said that the (legions) of other people who made reservations specified that they wanted the regular tables with normal seats and not the communal table with the backless stools. My friend explained that Open Table didn't offer seating options and how would one know that they need to specify what kind of table they wanted to sit at?The manager insisted that the other tables were spoken for and if we chose to sit at one, they can get us out in 45 minutes, apparently an hour was no longer an option.  Clearly the communal table with the stools is some sort of Open Table purgatory whereas the people who phone in their reservations are given preferential treatment by being allowed to sit at a regular table.Suggestion to all future Danji customers: Don't book your reservations through Open Table unless you want to be in restaurant purgatory.

This review is for delivery through Caviar, for which there is a service fee in addition to the delivery fee. I was disappointed to see the wings came absolutely soggy and dripping. I understand some of the freshness is lost in delivery, and I would have been fine with the wings being not as crispy as it would have been if I ate in. But this was at another level - the chicken was swimming in oily sauce in the container and there was absolutely zero trace of crispiness - it was the soggy wet batter you see in general tso's chicken that has been sitting all day at hot food bars. I've ordered Korean fried wings from other places before and know it is possible to get it delivered properly. Maybe they need to cool it down further before sending off or changing containers, but I had to throw mine out after one wing because it was just mush not worth eating.

Nevertheless, the bulgogi sliders (2 for $16) are tasty and melt in your mouth. Maybe worth a stop in alone. The kimchi bacon wet fried rice ($24) is a smallish portion of fried rice served under an egg and served on a sizzling stone platter. I thought it was good-not-great, but my date was unsatisfied. The meat is closer to pork belly cubes than bacon, but that did not bother me. I did like that the rice was soaked in red sauce and egg yoke and so was not dry like many fried rices.

The yellowtail was so fresh, the tofu was so juicy and flavorful, the fried chicken was also super delicious. The bossam, bulgogi sliders and cod with 3 different kinds of kimchi were by far the best part. The blueberry sorbet was so fresh. Definitely go hungry and plan to spend some money if you come here, also make reservations ahead of time because it is very small and busy.

Not even five minutes after I was seated at the bar, there was a line going out the door (around 12:30 pm). If you are interested in eating here, I would recommend getting here right around when Danji opens at noon.I ordered the Poke Bibimbap somewhat reluctantly since it was a whopping $18. I would expect bibimbap to be a relatively less expensive dish, but I will say that the chunks of poke were surprisingly pretty large. This ""bibimbap"" was more salad than rice bowl, but it did leave me feeling refreshed rather than bogged down due to the usual amount of rice in the dish.While the bibimbap turned out to be not bad, I couldn't justify the price.

When I checked online (opentable) there were several openings. I don't know if the hostess was just being lazy for this night. I booked the reservation and had high expectations for the food. The service was great.  I ordered 3 plates: KFC chicken - it was so soggy, salty, and not memorable. Probably the worse chicken wings ever. The coating tasted very similar to basic buffalo sauce and it was not crispy the way I imagine korean fried chicken to be. do yourself a favor and skip this. Shrimp and scallion pancake - this was okay. The batter was nice but my only complaint was the shrimp and scallion ratio. It basically had maybe 3 pieces of shrimp (not fresh) and so much chunks of scallion and peppers. If you love peppers and scallion go for it.. otherwise save your money. Bacon kimchi fried rice with scrambled egg and gravy - i ordered this cause it looked amazing in photos but I ended up being really disappointed. it had bits of chinese sausage and mixed fatty bacon with loads of onions. not a lot of flavor. I do taste the kimchi however the whole dish just didn't cut it. I've had way better kimchi fried rice. The restaurant gave me a very pretentious feel as if it tried really hard to be authentic Korean and failed terribly. The place is cute for a date but not for the food.

2.0,6/8/2017,"I somehow spent $27 on a bibimbap and a bottle of sparkling water.  There was a $3 surcharge to get the rice crispier (which is how a solid bibimbap should be, less the additional cost).  Not sure why I have to pay extra for food to be made right. There was also a lack of explanation on why the food here is expensive, and why I should feel fine about paying so much.  Is the egg farm fresh, veggies organic and beef grass fed? This place is not Junsik, a Michelin starred Korean restaurant by any stretch of the imagination. $7 for a bottle of sparkling is a bit of an overkill.  I hope this place will develop some more character soon to match its high price.",0,1,0,aly y.,"New York, NY",78,24,9

2.0,5/18/2017,"First things first-- Danji is not a restaurant you want to head for if you're looking for an authentic experience. I think that's a given. It has a young, hip, trendy atmosphere that's geared toward what I'd say, is an audience that doesn't usually eat cuisine of the culture, persay. Danji is a cute place to take a date, but not somewhere for ""new experiences."" Now don't get me wrong- the food was yummy, but it wasn't mind blowing, and definitely was not worth the price you paid. I sort of felt like a lot of the dishes were doused in the same sauce and served to you on a different plate. I may just be biased because I grew up in an Asian household, but many of the dishes that Danji touts could be found in your local Asian supermarket. Since it is a ""Korean tapas"" place, portions are minuscule and range anywhere from $11-23ish. I gave two stars because the service was enjoyable and attentive, and the interior was quite pleasing. Other than that, the food didn't impress me as much as I would've hoped. And I do feel a bit ripped off. Another thing...how does this so called ""Korean restaurant"" not even serve hot tea!!? Baffling.You could go to K-Town for a bite for half the price, and double the amount of food. I don't know about you, but the cheaper the better (and definitely if the quality of food is nicer.)

3.0,5/4/2017,"It pains me to give a review with less than 4 stars to Danji because I love chef Hooni Kim and his restaurants.  Although I don't know much about him, I know he is passionate about Korean food. When I taste his food I can tell how much he loves and understands Korean food and how much work went into creation of each dish.  He successfully captured the best characteristic of a traditional dish and modernized it by giving an unexpected twist. Often times fusion Korean food is confusing. (Does burrata really enhance the taste of kimchi?  Or vice versa?). But Hooni Kim's Korean fusion works so well because he loves and understands Korean dishes very well.  And all my favorites at Danji capture that. Bulgogi slider, wet bacon kimchi fried rice, KFC chicken and kimchi poutine.  Well, maybe not all can be called fusion but they sure are enhanced versions of their traditional selves.On my last visit I ordered all of my favorites plus the whelk salad. But somehow none of these dishes were completely satisfying. Bulgogi sliders were overly seasoned, ""wet""kimchi fried rice was ""dried"" kimchi fried rice, and KFC chicken wings tasted too vinegary.  And the whelk salad noodle, my ambitious trial of the night was nothing special.  Have I changed or have you changed? But I every one of the dishes was a little less or a little more than what I remembered so it must not be me. Perhaps chef Hooni was not cooking that night...which makes me all the more concerning, considering he owns more than one restaurant.  Perhaps he needs to give more love to Danji, as much as he gives his love to Korean food.  Nevertheless, I will return to dine here again because I want to try his next creation.

We were happy to be seated and to order for three immediately. Ridiculously haughty and unhelpful staff. Food might be good. I will never know. My wife arrived at 5:45 and we were told it would be at least 25 minutes to wait for a table.  We left and got Vietnamese noodles down the street. Running a restaurant is also about treating customers like guests not hostile interlopers. The staff couldn't care less.  Too bad (they were almost smiling). You lost your reservation.

3.0,3/29/2017,"Dined here yesterday evening with an old friend - Danji has been on my list for quite some time, but I just hadn't gotten around to it. Initial vibes walking in were a intimate, small yet cozy setting with dim lighting. The staff is certainly friendly, inquiring right away if it is your first visit and explaining the ""Korean tapas"" style and recommending ~2 plates per person. This right away, between the ""fusion"" approach and menu layout reminded me very much of Momofuku Nishi (which I was not a fan of, but that's not for here). Interesting setup at the table, with a hidden drawer concealing your menus. The food has three sections by size; small, medium and large. We went ahead and ordered two smalls, one medium and one large. First, I would say that the small and medium arguably didn't have much of a difference in portion size, in my opinion. That aside, we got the yellow tail sashimi and the rice cakes - Sashimi was good, with great textural contrast given the potato flakes, and the fish was certainly fresh. The spicy rice cakes took the prize here for me however, with a smoky spiciness to the gochujang, which was almost baked/encrusted on the tteokbokki, and contrasted perfectly with the thinly sliced sausage and crème fraiche; a must order in my opinion. For our medium, we ordered the bulgogi beef sliders, which are super rich and flavorful; for those who don't like too much richness however, you might see these as being a little 'greasy.' This plate was where my confusion with the plate sizing came to light, as I'm not certain how two small sliders can be considered a medium - this plate was good, but again not for everyone depending on your tolerance for fatty oils.Finally we got the Short Rib - which while ultra tender and flavorful, honestly didn't stand out in flavor from your run of the mill short rib entrée at an Italian restaurant. I understand this restaurant is taking a fusion approach in their plates, but I saw no fusion here other than giving some steamed white rice on the side; the vegetables roasted/served with the meat (fingerlings, pearl onions, sweet potato purée) again mimic that of very standard short rib, or beef in general accompaniments, with nothing Korean in nature (they could have served them pickled kimchi style, for example).For dessert we had black sesame ice cream, which was tasty but pretty much your standard if you've had it before. While this meal was good, it was nothing stellar or having ground-breaking fusion approaches that I was hoping to see based upon my readings of praise for  Danji. And at ~$125 for two (only one beer, $7) I would argue the experience was slightly overpriced - keep in mind you're paying $8 per slider, $17 for four pieces of sashimi, $18 for rice cakes with what couldn't have been more than 1.5-2oz of sausage (as I noted, very thinly sliced), and $36 for a short rib entrée ""for 2"" which included two ribs. So in summation, tasty yes, but a unique/fusion approach is debatable, in what I felt to be somewhat overpriced of an experience.",1,0,1,Nicholas K.,"Philadelphia, PA",11,29,272
5.0,3/16/2017,"I have been remiss in not reviewing this NYC gem.  I've been here a dozen times over the years and it's my go-to crave in the city when visiting. Small. Cramped. Loud. Energetic.

4.0,3/15/2017,"I've passed by Danji, previously an owner of 1 Michelin Star, many a time but have been reluctant to go given I'm not really too much of a fan of going to places that try to do an ""upscale"" Asian dining experience.  Asian food need not be fancy - I'm perfectly happy with a hole in the wall that only takes cash.  Alas, I was looking for a decent, interesting place to eat before a show at the Broadway Theater (Miss Saigon!) and Danji came upon my radar.  I'd been meaning to try this place, so why not?I would recommend making a reservation as this place is pretty small.  There is bar seating (which was actually quite comfortable in my experience) as well as table seating in the back (you may have to share a table with others as some are communal).  They took our super last minute reservation and sat us at the bar, however, it looked like some of their reservations never showed up as I saw some empty seats.  Ambience is good - not too loud and not too quiet.  We sat and watched the bartender Tino get to work - he was super friendly and even chimed into our weird conversations at times :)For food, we decided on doing the set course for 2, since everything on there was what we wanted anyways.  They say its a full portion of each.  We left pretty damn full though, so this is plenty of food for two hungry people.I went with a person from Korea who said this was definitely not authentic Korean food (but we already knew that) - however, the food was very good for being a ""creative"" take at Korean food (aka not actual Korean food, but Korean INSPIRED food).For $53 per person excluding tax and tip, we got:- Spicy yellowtail sashimi with crispy potato flakes - oh the flavor!  Loved the potato flakes.  There were so many dimensions to this one bite... if you're not getting the set menu, definitely order this as an appetizer.- Tofu with ginger scallion dressing - a little chewy and reminds me of a dry agedashi tofu. Could have used a tad bit more dressing, but was still good.- Bossam - the pork belly was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth and I loved the thinly sliced daikon and radish that came with it.  YUM- Chicken wings - I've had better Korean wings elsewhere - could have been a little more crispy and a little less saucy, but the flavor was good.  - Slider of the day - pork belly sliders - yum.  Not your average slider.- Black cod - deliciously flaky and nicely cooked.  Went well with the white rice and the portion was surprisingly HUGE.- Toasted rice ice cream - apparently this is from a place called Noona's in the LES (as per the bartender) - DELICIOUS ICE CREAM.  We decided we are going to find this ""Noona"" and buy all her ice cream.  (Edit: they only do pint deliveries and wholesale!)Overall, a very nice experience dining at Danji, but it surely didn't come cheap.  However, one of the better options for pre-theater dining.  The service was super nice and they were more than accommodating when we requested our dishes come out a little faster given we were running slightly behind on schedule before our show.  Kudos to the staff here.",8,1,7,Allene T.,"Manhattan, NY",2170,1311,3573

5.0,2/8/2017,"As tourists from California, our hotel was right smack dab in the middle of Time Square and we were looking for a good spot to walk to and grab a bite.  Danji came up as one of the top 10 in the area so off we went.  When we arrived, we didn't realize that the majority of people make reservations at this place since it gets packed (rookie mistake), however the host was absolutely fantastic. We waited maybe a few minutes and she gave us the open seats at the bar which is what we prefer since that's where all the fun happens. The bartender Oscar was so kind and accommodating, he helped us every step of the way to suggest items he thought we would like since we had never been there before. The atmosphere is fun, the jams are great, the service is fast and best of all...the food is amazing. We ordered the Spicy Pork Beef Sliders and the Kimchi Wet Bacon Fried Rice, both delicious!

3.0,2/8/2017,"Decided to check this place out with my girlfriend for brunch during restaurant week. The first impression was this place was small and cramped. I had to get up several times for them to serve the other customers. I do like quaint spots but this might have been a bit to cramped for my style. I do like the decor and it looks extremely contemporary but I just wish they redid the seating.Since we ordered from the $29 Restaurant Week Brunch Menu, the options were limited but we got:Tofu with ginger scallion dressing - I enjoyed this dish as it was rather light and the tanginess of the sauce add a great dimension to a simple dish. The portion size was not too small and fit an appetizer portion perfectly.Daikon beef soup - A large bowl which can share for two and that was perfect. The soup was not overly salty so all the flavors really come through. I could probably drink a few bowls of this. A must have on a cold day.Big Korean Breakfast - This entree comes with spam, korean marinated pork belly, kimchi, rice, and a runny egg to top it all. I love the pork belly and I liked how it goes well with the rest of the dish. However, the spam I felt was a but misplaced as it was extremely salty as usual and nothing there really counter the saltiness well enough. I ended up finishing the dish but left the spam as my fondness of it does not extend to this dish. I would reccommend they just place more pork belly and remove the spam altogether.Chul sot bibimbap with bulgogi - This was like all the bibimbaps I had and the flavor was good but nothing outstanding. The dish was typical and since we are New York, if you want to bibimbap a twist would be great. I enjoyed this dish because i love bibimbap but I really wish they try to add a twist. The kimchi marinated pork belly and spam wouldve been good in this dish as when would you see spam or house marinated pork belly in a bibimbap.The meal finished with toasted rice and black sesame ice cream. Nothing outstanding here as the ice cream I got was half melted already. Both were decent but nothing memorable. In conclusion, I would recommend trying danji but try some of their other dishes that stands out like the spicy cod roe with scrambled eggs. Danji may not be reinventing the wheel but they provide good korean food if you are in the area and cannot travel to Ktown r Northern Blvd.",0,0,2,George L.,"Bronx, NY",178,96,144
5.0,2/7/2017,"Danji is a small gem in the theatre district. Upon entry, there's the bar and directly next to it is the dine-in area. I advise to come here only with a small group of people (2-4) as it is a pretty tiny space. Also, I recommend reservations if you're visiting during peak or weekend hours.We ordered a few small plates: spicy yellowtail, spicy pork belly sliders and spicy rice cake plus a medium plate: Korean pancakes. For drinks, we had the Korean pear. I'm not really into paying almost $15 for a small cocktail but it was that good where I ordered it twice. The food was good as well. Though I think for the yellowtail, it was a bit spicier than your regular sashimi but nonetheless, it was appetizing. I think my favorite plate was the pork belly sliders.

3.0,1/23/2017,"Danji is fine. If you are in the theater district and are hankering for some homestyle Korean food, you could do a lot worse than Danji. But that's not really what you want to hear about a restaurant right?  You want it to wow you, invite you to try dishes and flavors you couldn't find elsewhere. Provide the best example of dish A or drink B so that you can recommend this new find widely.This is not that place. We did the tasting menu as it was a good deal and many of the dishes that appealed were there. The starter sashimi was fine but the accompaniments completely masked the flavor of the fish. The tofu was surprising and very good.  It had an interesting marshmallow like texture in both the fluffiness and the bit of chew - I've not had tofu that way before and liked it a lot. Sliders were fine.  Nothing special. Bossam was a disappointment as the slices were too large for one bite and the kimchi did not seem to be house made. It lacked a differentiating element to keep it from being just the same ole same ole pork belly dish.We also like the rice cake dish but the meal got quite heavy at that moment. It was a lot.The trio of kimchi was underwhelming. I'd be surprised if it was housemade. I make and eat a lot of kimchi and this was not en par.  The rice was also overcooked and gummy, as if they didn't properly rinse it.We had advised the staff that we needed to be in and out on the quicker side from the start, and the wait for our final dish, the soy cod, was about 20 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was a mangled jumble of fish bits on top of two enormous cylinders of daikon and drowning in over-reduced soy sauce. It was seriously fishy in the ""it's the bloodline part of the fish that's about 3 days past prime...let's hack it up and see if they notice"" sense of fishy, visually unappealing (it looked as if they gave us the remains of having cut actual fillets for other customers) and inedibly salty.  Check please.",0,1,0,Julie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",98,572,13

I would definitely advise making a reservation (which we did not do as this was our backup to Ippudo Westside), as the inside of the place was pretty small and fills up quickly. It does not have a separate entrance area, not even the temporary kind some restaurants build during winter, so if you're seated by the bar it can get pretty cold.

The hostess was nice but upfront about needing our seats at the bar by a certain time so we were worried about ordering a variety and not getting out in time. However, everything came out really quickly and appropriately staggered. The bartender was excellent. He greeted all the regulars by name as they came in, remembering names and personal details, while also being attentive to everyone eating at the bar.

3.0,12/28/2016,"I'd hesitated on visiting Danji as I hold a healthy amount of skepticism towards any dining establishment that tries ""elevating"" traditional Asian cuisine. There are some rare cases where these interpretations succeed, but it's usually because they're seamlessly melded with other cuisines and techniques, as in the case of Jungsik and Atoboy. With the newest season of Restaurant Week, however, I found yet another excuse to make a delayed visit to a restaurant and to see for myself if the Michelin star had been justly given.Even at first glance, Danji doesn't look like your typical fine dining establishment. It's a pretty small venue, with a compact bar area by the entrance and a handful of tightly packed tables filling out the majority of the dining room. Reservations are definitely recommended, especially as the restaurant is a popular pre-theater dining venue, given its proximity to Broadway and Lincoln Center.As a handful of restaurants do over the several weeks spanning ""Restaurant Week"", Danji offered a handful of dishes found on their regular dinner menu. It's a decision I definitely appreciate, as it gives diners a better idea of what the restaurant actually offers. And specifically at Danji, we were given a selection of items across a four-course meal; as dishes are Danji are smaller than the normal entree or main, it was also a thoughtful decision by the restaurant.I opted to start with their Spicy Yellowtail Sashimi, which utilizes freh cuts of Wild Pacific Hamachi and tops off each piece with a generous sprinkling of crispy potato flakes. The hamachi was smartly paired with pickled red onion and a slice of jalapeño, although I felt the addition of the cho jang sauce was a little to strong to pair with such a mild fish. My friend and I split our next course, so I got to try both the Bulgogi and the Fried Chicken sliders. Both were delicious; the bulgogi beef featured the dual sweet and savory preparation of the meat on a pillow-y bun, topping it off with a slice of pickled cucumber and a scallion salsa. I think my preference fell towards the Chicken Sliders, in the end, however, as the sauce coating the chicken was noticeably spicy and the pairing of it with the creamy corn and asian slaw made for a satisfying contrast.I think the third course, which is probably best deemed the main, was where the meal fell short the most. I ordered the Bossam, lured by the promise of pork belly. What I received, however, definitely fell short of expectations. The dish consisted of six small slices of pork belly, a few slices of cucumber, and a side dish of daikon kimchi. The portion was much more suitable for an appetizer, and the pork belly didn't have the flavor nor the texture of a well-braised protein. Bo ssam traditionally also includes rice, and the lack of a starch was also evident in the compilation of the dish. On the other hand, the Kimchi Fried Rice was a stark contrast to what I had ordered; I believe that normally, the dish is served for two, but my friend appeared to get the full portion for his order. It's a generous serving of fried rice with kimchi, bacon, and a melted slice of cheddar cheese on top. Elegant? No. Filling? Absolutely.For dessert, we had our choice of ice cream, and I decided on the Black Sesame. The dish is cutely presented in a Danji-labeled container with an accompanying wooden spoon. And while the ice cream was certainly good, there wasn't anything particularly memorable about it that makes it stand out from the number of other black sesame ice creams or soft serves that I've had.At the end of the day, I have yet to full see if Danji truly is worthy of being deemed a one Michelin-starred restaurant. A number of dishes didn't seem much different than what I'd find on 32nd Street and given the price and the difficulty of obtaining a reservation, I think I would rather go for the latter option on any instance that I'm craving for Korean food.",13,3,6,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827
3.0,12/26/2016,"This place is confused.  It tries to be upscale and unique with menus in hidden drawers under the tables, but it doesn't live up to anything in terms of taste.  Don't come here for authentic Korean food.  The chulsot bibimbap has soggy rice that doesn't burn to a crisp like it should in the sizzling stone pot.  Both orders were the exact same in terms of output.  The trio of banchan was surprisingly edible and sweet without being too spicy given the thick coat of red sauce.  Surprisingly, the soup was spicier than all the dishes combined even though there as no hint of red.The staff is friendly and tries to explain the dishes without much luck especially when they're not Korean.  It's close to public transit in the midst of the Hell's Kitchen restaurants, but I doubt that I'd come back for lackluster food that isn't memorable.",2,0,0,Jenny L.,"Millbrae, CA",181,994,983

I really enjoyed the pork belly dish and the fried rice, their wings, pretty much the entire tasting menu.

5.0,9/23/2016,"I've dined here several times late in the evening and to be honest my experience wasn't bad at all, but I can't say it was really memorable. Perhaps it was ordering ala carte, or perhaps this menu too falls victim to a plague of NYC main menus falling short to the appetizer menus.To be honest we came here after work because it just seemed convenient and it wasn't a bad experience when I tried it before. . .However and whatever it was before, this 3rd time, my taste buds were kicking off like fireworks and it was a very memorable experience.We were really in for an unexpected surprise when a friend and I ordered the chef's tasting menu priced at $55 per person.These were definitely not your traditional korean dishes... and being a person who often finds ""Korean Fusion"" or modern korean fare too often overly underwhelming... this was an unexpected and pleasantly overwhelming experience.Right off the bat with the first tasting which was a yellow tail sashimi wrapped in a light and subtle kimchi covered a crunchy fish flake was literally like fireworks in my mouth...Dish after dish, creative flavor profiles enhanced with creative textures provided a well curated experience for my taste buds. Flavor combinations that were just spot on.It actually surprises me that Danji has what I believe to be a relatively underrated rating at a flat 4 stars.If you try the chef's tasting menus on a Wednesday night, you too might find yourself excited as I",3,0,1,Dotan Y.,"New York, NY",8,8,1

Great for pre-theater dining- but get a reservation or go early. It was clear that the food was high quality and well prepared. The flavor was authentic and had good depth but was a bit on the salty side. We did the tasting for three and it was a very good portion of food at the end. The yellowtail sashimi was excellent. The Bossam was also excellent with a clean and appetizing presentation. The cod was good but a bit salty. The bulgogi sliders were kid pleasers but instead of a spicy cucumber on top, they could have offered a kimchi slaw. Again, the food was good not great, service was great not excellent, I would have liked to see some more spicy options and the banchan should have come out a little sooner in the meal to match how Koreans eat.

The sliders were great, too. We also had KFC wings off the menu, which were tasty but a little spicy for me. Short rib was amazing. The only disappointment was the ice cream, which was flavorless and we had to wait a while to eat it because it was frozen so hard (and it was in a little paper cup like you could get at the store).

Very well balanced between the bitters, citrus, and sugar. So good I didn't bother trying a different drink but opted for a 2nd one of these.Food:Yellowtail sashimi: Good first impression. Had a definite kick from the jalapeno and the fish quality was quite good and made for a succulent, buttery type of bite. KFC - not very ""spicy"" but was quite tasty. Sauce is a mix of salty sweet (not overly so) and had a nice crunch. Daikon paired well with it.Cod: Super tender, very well executed fish. Thought the sauce was kind of run of the mill though.I tried a little of the other options as well and the cod and short rib were the best. The pork belly I would skip. I was the only one to get the rice ice cream and I liked it better than the black sesame. Kind of hard to describe, but had a toasted flavor to it.

Sad that they lost their Michelin star but still really good food. Went there for restaurant week this summer. They have some really interesting EtOh options that you must check out.For the food itself, it was a 4 course meal. Got the KFC spicy wings along with spicy yellowtail sashimi. Never have i had sashimi as delicious as that with such an interesting taste that you want to keep eating more and more of it.Next we got the bossam and the galbi-gui for main course both of which were really really good, though I think the bossam might've won it for me. Soft, flavorful and delicious! The combination of side dishes it comes with makes it all the more amazing.Ok, so if I'm raving so much about this place, why only 4 stars? I'm not really a fan of the tall communal tables that fill the room. Its good if you're with friends but not really if you're looking for something romantic and want to have an intimate conversation.

We came  here right before a Broadway show and were short on time, so our dinner was a bit rushed. The waitress asked if we had a show to catch and made sure to time our dishes accordingly. Our first course and star of our dinner was the spicy whelk salad w. buckwheat noodles. I've never had whelk (sea snails) before, but was pleased to find how good and chewy they were. After this course, I had high expectations for the rest of the meal. Our second course, bulgogi beef sliders, surprised me with a bite of spice that left my tongue burning. The bun was good, but bulgogi was average and the size of the sliders were too small. Our next two dishes were the spicy 'k.f.c.' korean fire chicken wings and the soy-poached black cod w. spicy daikon. Both dishes were good, but unimpressive and not worth the price.

They have a good list of soju and sake, too, with big enough bottles to share between two people but small enough that I could see an individual order per bottle. The space isn't that large, so I suggest making reservations, which we were able to do literally five minutes before walking in. They did seat us at a bar, but the long tables were being held for bigger groups - that's understandable. The only caveat is their portions aren't big for the price point.

3.0,4/4/2016,"Michelin starred Korean restaurants are rare, so I was excited to try Danji. This was actually my first Michelin Star experience in New York, and the experience was more of a let down. I expected more, especially after all the great reviews. We reserved a table for four on a Tuesday night, but had to wait a little bit before we got seated. Seating is limited. Danji offers tapas - style dishes, grouped by small, medium, and large plates.  Our group decided to share and sample about 6-7 different items. We tried the spicy korean fire chicken wings, kimchi fried rice with an egg on top, bulgogi beef sliders, and steak tartare to name a few. The dishes were good, but in a subtle way. I didn't find anything that stood out or had that ""wow"" factor.  I would rather go to k-town to get Korean food but Danji is great to try once for that Michelin Star experience!",1,0,0,Syyu C.,"Manhattan, NY",567,274,1485
3.0,4/4/2016,"Let me start off my saying that I'm Korean and when I think Korean food, I think of dive-y, family style, street food. So you can understand my apprehension of going to a fancy, Michelin starred Korean joint. Korean food just isn't fancy and I like it that way.My sister claims this place is awesome so I give it a shot. We ordered the tasting menu for 3 people and an additional order of the pork sliders since it wasn't included in the tasting and because everyone on yelp raved about them. Overall, everything was pretty good. The first thing to come out was the yellowtail - it was on point and probably my favorite thing off the menu. The fish was fresh and crunch from the cucumbers and spice from the gochujang was absolute perfection. Other notable dishes were the bossam, kimchi fried rice, and the short rib. I could've done without the bulgogi and pork belly sliders - they were both okay, but nothing spectacular.Service was good, atmosphere is small and cozy.

2.0,3/17/2016,"I was very unimpressed by this place. Came in for dinner with high expectations, considering it has a Michelin star, but left feeling unsatisfied. The ambiance and setting were neat and charming given the tiny space, and the servers were very polite, but the food was severely lacking in flavor. I could have just gone to an actual Korean restaurant and been much more satisfied. The so-called ""contemporary twist"" on the food is just a way to get away with Americanizing the dishes by numbing the spices with unnecessary fatty ingredients (heavy cream, butter, and cheese).1) The Butternut Squash Jook was good, but unremarkable and not even remotely Korean-passing. It was a regular cream-based soup with a few Mochi tossed in.2) The Bossam was probably my favorite item of the night. The pork belly was cooked perfectly and the flavors and spices were delicious. The kimchi side was good too, and the cabbage wrap was nicely pickled. It was a great balance of Korean flavors with a Western method of cooking.3) The Dduk Bokki, in severe contrast with the previous dish, was a complete sham. It utilized the thick-cut rice noodles of traditional dduk bokki, but that was the only honest aspect of the dish. The noodles, along with some sausage, sat atop what tasted like barbecue sauce and were topped off with a hefty amount of melted cheese. It was very confusing and not in a good way. It was dry instead of soupy, and overall was more reminiscent of a barbecue pizza than any Korean dish. I just did not get it.4) My sister is vegan, so she ordered a noodle stir-fry off the vegan menu. They were pretty good, but also so so damn ordinary. I could definitely get those just about anywhere else for way cheaper. Actually I'm pretty sure I could make them at home.5) We also got a fried veggie pancake (I don't remember exactly what it was called) but it was saturated in oil and pretty bland. The dipping sauce was weak in flavor as well. Also could have gotten that anywhere else.The wine was ok, I guess. I have no qualms about dishing out for good food, but I HATE spending good money on food I did not enjoy.

4.0,2/19/2016,"Small tapas plates, but don't judge just by the size of the dishes. Their pork belly sliders were fantastic and tasted better than other places nearby. Greasy, oily, and utterly fatty, the pork belly were marinated with so much flavor and a bit of spice. You can easily eat about a dozen of them because they taste so great and within a few bites it's gone. Compared to their alternative, bulgogi sliders, which were not as flavorful and a bit dry. Their two person dishes are nice, the oxtail stew was spicy but not too overpowering. The meat was tender and fall off the tail bone soft. It's neat that it's served in a little pot. The soup broth reminded me of the tofu soup you get from other Korean restaurants. Seating is tight and it gets filled in quick. There not much room and not a lot of privacy because most seats are on a cafeteria style bench, just elevated higher and with stool like chairs. It's nice they have hooks on the wall and under the table for jackets and bags.

2.0,2/15/2016,"This place was a solid 2-star for my boyfriend and I, or maybe 2.5 after drinking 3 glasses of water and having all the salt and sauces washed down. We came to this place on a snow monday night hoping to get some cozy korean dishes that are warm, soupy and spicy, the typical authentic Korean cuisine that you would think. However, Danji is different. It is a Korean fusion/tapas restaurant with fancy room decors and ambiance, attentive services and $$$ price range. Between the 2 of us, we ordered:1. bulgogi beef sliders - 2 very juicy sliders with ""korean"" bulgogi, a slice of marinated cucumber and some green onions on top. The buns were just about right, not too crunchy nor too soft. But the meat was also the SALTIEST THING WE'VE BOTH EVER EATEN. After my first bite, i had to have some water to wash down the salt/sauce. It was THAT SALTY. We didnt mind it too much as we thought maybe we were interpreting the dish wrong. We had hopes for the following dishes and thought they might be less strong than this one.2. soy-poached black cod w. spicy daikon - 2 pieces of black cod on top with 1 piece of daikon at the bottom, comes with 1 bowl of white rice. The quality of the fish was lovely. It was tender and juicy. The overall taste was very sweet as it was poached in soy. But still, the sauce overpowered everything else I could taste. It was so strong that i had to eat half bowl of rice and drink 2 sips of water for every bite of cod/daikon. So far, this is the most ""plain"" dish.3. kimchi bacon spam wet fried rice - soft scramble egg on top with kimchi bossam gravy fried rice. This was the dish my boyfriend had been eyeing for the longest time. The scramble egg was very soft and it was cooked with a lot of butter and cream. Tasted very good ON ITS OWN. The fried rice at the bottom ruined everything for us. It was so so so so salty that we couldnt even finish 1/3 of it. By the time i finished my first 2 bites of the dish, I had consumed 2 cups of water. We had to stop at this point and asked the waiter whether the chef screwed up the dish or we were ""interpreting"" it wrong. The waiter was very nice and he took the dish to the kitchen. 2 minutes later he came out and told us:""The chef thinks its a bit too salty too. We're very sorry about that."" They gave us the choice of having it re-cooked but we decided to move on and asked for the bill. We've had enough sodium in-take for the day. In the end, they brought us a ""complementary dessert"". It was an almond pudding (I think) with 3 pomegranate seeds. It was pretty good compared to all other courses. The dessert was not on their menu.Overall: too salty, sauce too strong, taste nothing like authentic korean food and would not come again.",2,0,0,Vanessa Z.,"New York, NY",90,22,7

4.0,1/20/2016,"This place was a solid 3-stars, but made 1 star better because they support natural / organic / sustainable ingredients. Service was really attentive too.Between the 3 of us, we ordered:Spicy Yellowtail Sashimi: Solid 3 slices of sashimi (wild caught / sustainable seafood).Tofu with ginger scallion dressing: The fried tofu was done really great and liked the tangy vinaigrette dressing.Garlic honey wings with sesame seeds: Pretty good wings, although small (but it's because these are hormone-free chickens that haven't been force fed to be fat). Scallion & korean pepper pancake: Not as good as pancakes at other Korean restaurants. I wouldn't order this dish again.Short ribs: Ok taste, and definitely still had fatty parts. I liked the fingerling potatoes, but couldn't tell there were pine nuts on this dish. I wouldn't order this dish again.As I finished my review of Danji, I would say none of the dishes stood out and I thought it was a little on the pricey side for the portion size (although I was full by the time we stood up to leave). However, as I read more about the restaurant's mission, I see that they take stock in the natural / organic preparation of their food, as well as the sustainability of their ingredients. I can appreciate that and know that these choices require higher prices passed on to the consumer. With that in mind, I changed this rating from 3 to 4 star - because there are behind-the-scenes choices that make this restaurant solid and worth supporting.",0,0,0,Eva H.,"New York, NY",54,142,19

4.0,12/30/2015,"Korean tapas place - definitely innovative! I came here with my family for dinner before a Broadway show. Food was average, ambience was better. Food: we ordered the butternut squash soup, yellowtail sashimi, honey wings, bulgogi sliders, spicy pork sliders, steak tartar, the japchae, and the kimchi bacon fried rice. Standouts were the spicy pork sliders, yellowtail sashimi, and the fried rice. The sliders were super juicy and flavorful. Sashimi was deliciously buttery with a spicy kick. The fried rice came out on a sizzling black plate, topped with soft scrambled egg, and had a generous amount of sweet bacon throughout - YUM. Honey wings and japchae were a bit too sweet for my taste. Butternut squash soup tasted good but not memorable. Steak tartar was okay - interestingly paired with quail egg and Asian pear, but would've been better with some sort of bread to dip.Ambience: this restaurant is small! There were probably 3 or 4 long tables, and you'll be sharing tables with strangers. Still, there was definitely enough room for dishes (they bring about 2 out at a time) and the environment was quiet and intimidate enough so you could still carry on a conversation. I think it'd be a great place for a date.Main con is the price of the food. The dishes were small, but came with hefty price tags. They recommend 2 dishes per person, so it adds up real fast.

The service is ok.  We had:Butternut squash jook (congee) - which was really more of a butternut squash purée/soup with a Korean twist, pieces of mochi rice cakes, pine nuts, and I think dates under the surface.  This was my favorite dish from the meal. Tofu appetizer - also great, like a traditional Korean cold tofu side dish but the tofu was fried (warm), and the sauce was tasty Bo Ssam - pork belly you wrap in thin sheets or daikon.  Nice twist but not impressed especially after the strong opening appetizers.Spicy cod - again not impressed Kimchi side was very standard.Now it could be that we just ordered the wrong things, but a number of these were recommended by the waitress.  So I'm inclined to think it's representative of the overall quality.Was hoping for the tasty multigrain rice a lot of Korean restaurants have, but it's white rice only.No dessert menu - a little surprised.  The first Michelin restaurant I've tried that didn't bother with any kind of dessert, even a piece of chocolate with the check.Overall, wasn't impressed.  Ambiance is pretty but food wise, I much prefer Oiji, Barn Joo, or Goggan.",4,1,3,Sallie D.,"Manhattan, NY",207,227,3461
4.0,12/14/2015,"I'm a fan, but I do think that Danji is hyped up with its michelin star rating. The space is small, trendy, modern, playful - pretty cramped by the bar since it shares the space with coathangers. We were seated at a communal table, veering on uncomfortably close to the couple next to us. The butternut squash vegetarian 'jook' is a simple comforting pumpkin soup but the mochi were just a little doughy, would probably work better with smaller mochi. Spicy 'k.f.c.' korean fire chicken wings are seriously spicy, but addictive. We ordered spicy pork belly sliders based on yelp recommendations, but honestly they were way too fatty for my taste. Delicious flavor combo going on, but the fat to meat ratio was like 70/30. The 'danji' braised short rib is like galbi jjim - tender, good flavor, classic Korean cuisine. The spicy rice cakes were disappointing - the rice cakes were not soft enough, and overpriced for the portion. Overall the portions are fairly small, encouraging tapas-style dining. The food and atmosphere are a step-up from ktown, a bit on the pricier side but not outrageous. Overall I enjoyed the meal but wasn't blown away.",1,0,0,Lillian Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",461,285,1300

5.0,11/7/2015,"I think this place is a figment of my imagination. It's a unicorn. An delicious restaurant, in Times Square, with phenomenal service. I truly thought that was only a myth. We came here last night for a pre-theatre dinner before BOM. The place opens at 530. When we walked in at 535 it was half full. I didn't think it would be that busy for the early bird special so I didn't make a rezzy but we were lucky & were still able to get seated.The service is FANTASTIC. The host if very attentive & personable. I chatted with him for a while & he was probably one of the nicest ppl I've met in a restaurant. When I mentioned it was our anniversary he brought us out complimentary sangria on the house. Our waitress was very nice & gave an honest opinion about the food/drinks without just trying to sell us in the most expensive stuff. Food came out super quick & was played nicely. The food: (we did the $48 pre-fix for 2)-yellowtail sashimi: fish was buttery & soft, marinated veggies inside were crisp. They veggies are kimchi style so this dish is a bit on the spicier side-tofu with ginger scallion: idk how they did it but they made the perfect tofu. It had an awesome crunchy crust & inside the tofu was wonderfully silky. None of that rubber kind of texture I've encountered before. Ginger scallion dressing was great & whole thing was covered in crunch tempura flakes-garlic sesame wings: we subbed these out for the kfc bc we weren't in the mood for super heat. The sauce was Delish & sticky, topped with garlic chips. They somehow manage to keep the skin crisp while saucing up the wings & the meat inside super moist-bossum: I don't eat pork but the bf said this pork belly was on point. He gobbled all of it pretty quick so it must be true-bulgogi beef sliders: this was prob what I was most looking forward to. The meat was sweet & juicy. Bun was soft, reminded me of a pineapple bun almost. Topped with my fav, a kimchi pickle. This is a must get when here-soy poached black cod: this dish was hands down the best thing we ate last night & the best cod I have ever had. It was so soft & moist my bc thought it was sea bass. The seasoning/sauce was unbelievable. The whole thing just melted in your mouth when you ate it-trio of kimchi: served with the cod & white rice. I am a HUGE fan of kimchi/all things pickled so this dish was perfect for me. My biggest pet peeve is when the cabbage gets soggy from the marinate instead of maintaining its crunch. This did not happen here. All three types were crisp & delicious. Each had a slightly different flavor but none were so spicy that it was unbearable. Fantastic side dish.

4.0,10/28/2015,"KenScale: 8.0/10Danji (meaing ""clay pot"" in Korean) has long been a sort of pioneer of modern Korean cuisine in NYC, with chef-owner Hooni Kim's Western technique using Korean ingredients. Chef Hooni has since expanded to a more casual gastropub Hanjan but Danji has long been a perennial favorite for a lot of Americans looking to get a taste of various tapas-style dishes that have displayed how modern Korean foods should look and taste like. I'm always a bit torn when reviewing modern Korean restaurants as I have be objective on how good the food is while also having familiarity with traditional flavor and texture of my home country. Some of my Korean friends clearly do not like what they call ""bastardized"" version of Korean food, and I do care about authenticity and don't really like all these Asian fusion places that cater to American clientele without having ideas if the Asian sensibility is still kept intact. I have to say, though, the kitchen at Danji does balance those conflicting elements rather well. Yes, the flavor is a bit on the sweeter side that is probably more acceptable to Caucasians, but the dishes are all well-executed nonetheless.By now, the bulgogi beef sliders have become a mainstay at Danji that you almost associate the restaurant with this dish as if this is all they serve. It does have a delightful combination of bulgogi beef and spicy pickled cucumber that work very well together inside the slider buns. Tofu with ginger scallion dressing could've been more spicy, but there is no denying that tofu is very fresh to make for delightful texture. Soy-poached black cod with spicy daikon is another traditional fish dish that has been modernized in a positive direction. The fish was cooked quite well, and the broth underneath gives the rich flavor without compromising the silky smooth texture of the fish. Kimchi bacon wet fried rice looks like an ordinary fried rice, but the combination of soft scrambled egg and bossam (braised pork belly dish in Korean tradition) gravy gives extra dimension to the dish that was so addictive that I couldn't stop digging it despite its rather large size and small appetite of my dining companion.The restaurant has that nice modern setting of a cozy dining room that is ideal for a date night or casual dinner on any given day. There is a full bar, and the couple of wines by the glass that I had were surprisingly good. Getting a reservation can be a challenge (the restaurant initially didn't take reservations but now it does) due to the size of dining room and the popularity of this place, so make sure to book in advance or try your luck at the bar if there is no room at the high table. Yes, Danji may not be for everyone (especially Korean folks who cherish authenticity above all else), but there is no denying that the restaurant does put together high quality into the dishes coming out from the kitchen.",5,1,2,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738
4.0,10/16/2015,"I have eaten at this establishment a half dozen times. I find the food rather unique with many interesting flavors. Don't dine if you want space. You are on top of each other. Service is okay, nothing special as there is very little direction on how to approach the menu. Be careful and review the menu before going. There's NOT something for everyone. The Tofu is amazing, the sliders and squash dish. I changed my rating from three stars to four after eating there a few more times. The food really impresses me. The staff also now recognizes my face. What still has me puzzled is the waitstaff seems disengaged to guide diners through the menu.

I would strongly suggest the tofu with soy sauce, crispy at the outside while soft in the middle. The kimchi slider was also delicious, with meat cooked towards perfection. I was even able to squeeze out the juice from the mini burger!Atmosphere was very ordinary, and very noisy.

To keep the color of material, they were cooked without sauce, then served together with main part, short rib. The taste and flavor of these sub items were just material themselves.

Plus, I don't like rubbing elbows with adjacent customers--I appreciate a little privacy. And I prefer super authentic Korean dishes that's priced right, based on quality.

3.0,5/14/2015,"This place contains one of my least favorite words in dining: tapas. This means tiny, overpriced plates. True to form, this Korean tapas place is still a tapas place which means it comes to about $30 for an average of 2 plates (not including drinks). Given that, the food is very good. The Garlic Honey Wings had an amazing crunchy skin and flavor; the Whelk Salad was indeed very spicy and the cucumber cooled off the Bossam in the right way. Each of the four Spicy Yellowtail Sashimi was smaller than my thumb, but it was still good.

4.0,5/4/2015,"This is a great spot for Korean-inspired tapas-style dishes to share while sipping on soju laced cocktails in a witty and rustic throwback slash hipster atmosphere that pays homage to the Motherland with artifacts of Korean history punctuated by industrial yet artsy touches, in the style of modern Post-Westernized Seoul. All of the Kim chi is made in house, which is apparent by the odor of fermented cabbage - a note of the acquired on the palate of ones nose. The vibe is clearly rustic meets edgy meets fusion, as exhibited by the vibrant, friendly and knowledgeable bartender of European descent and cute Korean hostesses whose pretty delicate faces you just want to squeeze. The menu is broken up by size - appetizer, for one, and for two (small medium large). Korean food is one that has been cultivated by the need for preservation and many of its nationally heralded dishes (sans meat party bbq) are made for comfort. What's great about the menu is that you get all the comfort and flavor of traditional Korea pulled together with a fusion that is as edgy as it is fresh. Bossam, which is classically a braised pork belly thinly sliced and served with a hot and spicy fishy ""paste"", is served here grilled (or torched or broiled) for a crispy edge, thick, and offered with thinly sliced cabbage hearts (soft and slightly boiled) to be wrapped with a green onion Kim chi like mixture that is absolutely divine. Apparently it's one of the restaurant's signature dish, and I can see why. It is succulent, and the thick slices juxtaposed thin vinegar-y cabbage and Korean ""slaw"" makes for a delightful way to enjoy pork belly and definitely of the ""sex in my mouth"" variety. The spam kimchi fried rice with egg and gravy was another hit, served hot on an iron plate so that some of the rice crisps up. Super homey and comforting - incorporating the dolsot traditional Korean method of serving bibimbap while expanding on the idea by serving it on a plate instead of a bowl. And the gravy adds that little extra touch. Not sure what's in it, as I was on my second Korean margarita and shot of soju by the time that course came out. But I can tell you it was good.In NYC there are soooo many restaurants... Many of them over hyped, some that just suck and some that are a cut above the rest. These places get you excited to try the different menu selections and intrigued by the restedanteur's and head chef's vision. Danji is one of those places. I've only been once but am certainly keeping it on the list of call-backs, with the potential to upgrade to a 5 star review (can't do that with just ONE visit, usually). This restaurant just works... And is simply a lovely restaurant serving well prepared and interesting foods while putting Korea on the map. And with all honestly, in this era of dining culture, I'm happy to have my people's food evolving past over sugared MSG ridden bbq meat and into a more updated yet true to its roots execution, all with great cocktails, service and ambiance to boot.",1,0,1,Gloria S.,"New York, NY",113,58,37
5.0,5/4/2015,"This place... Is awesome! The setting was  small and intimate  - and by intimate I mean, REALLY intimate! I was rubbing elbows with strangers but it was a cool experience. I've never eaten at a place where the table settings are that close to other people.  The lighting fixtures were sooo cute I want some in my house.We ordered margaritas to start and the bartender did a great job making them. I usually don't like margaritas because they tend to be too sweet or too sour, nothing ever perfectly in the middle, but I could have drank multiple ones here, they were that good. For food, we ordered the kimchi trio, the fire chicken wings and the bulgogi beef sliders. I could have done without the cucumber in the kimchi trio and just subbed in cabbage but it was still so fresh and perfect. The bulgogi sliders were small but just the right portion. The beef melted in my mouth. The chicken wings were.... SO GOOD. They were crispy, spicy, tender, everything you'd want in a good ass chicken wing. We also ordered the kimchi pork dumplings in the corn chowder and... I could have passed on that. The dumplings were really flavorful however I wasn't digging the chowder. I'm not a huge fan of corn so that's probably why but if you like corn, try it! The service was really good the entire meal.

Kfc wings were quite disappointing to me because the breading was too thick and flavor too sour. I am probably not a good judge because I developed my taste in Korean wings at boca on st marks. Pork belly sliders were cooked very very well but I would definitely order bulgogi sliders next time because I would have preferred more seasoning to balance out the fat. The octopus was really amazing. It was the most tender piece of octopus I'd ever had, and the sauce in that dish was spot on - but only if you can take spice. The noodles were not that thick and were more cooked than al dente but really worked with the soft and tender protein.

The meat and was juicy and packed with flavor that made me wish there were 20 more.

That all being said, I thought they were delicious. KFC wings were also great in terms of flavor -- but the breading a little heavy and also just a touch soggy.

Food is excellent all-around, and service is impeccable. The space is tiny and with just a few tables, so best to either come as a couple/pair or make a reservation in a group of 6 or more. Anything in between and you might find you have to wait. Steak tartare with shredded pear was the knockout dish of the night. Unique flavors of succulent, savory beef with crunchy pear shavings on top. An unbelievable mix of flavor and texture you're unlikely to find anywhere else.Bulgogi sliders are terrific, though definitely a small portion for the price. Very inventive Korean take on the bar snack.KFC wings are not the kind you'll find at any KFC that I know of. Delicious, smoky barbecue sauce and a big portion. These wings were finger-lickin good!Bacon spam fried rice is definitely the most unusual dish here. Where else would you find spam in an upscale restaurant? This dish was so good that somehow you forget that the meat was once in a can. Scallion pancake was to die for! I know this is a common dish in Chinese and Korean cooking, but they hit all the right notes of greasy, savory, and spicy with this one. Overall one of the best restaurants in Hell's Kitchen/Midtown West and well worth checking out.

2.0,12/8/2014,"Went Saturday night with a group of 7- we were seated very quickly when the last of our group arrived, and our server (Zack?) was very good- he explained the setup of the menu and made some recommendations. I won't go too much into reviewing the food as previous reviews pretty much reflect our thoughts- some dishes stood out more than others, and the prices feel a little high. Our main experience was that of being made to feel uncomfortable and self-conscious when our server was told by the manager to pass along a complaint that we were being too loud. We were sitting at the 2nd ""communal"" table (we had the whole table to ourselves) so we were spread out across 2 rows of 4, so it's possible we were somewhat loud. But considering that I (seated against the wall) frequently couldn't hear my friend seated 4 stools away from me says that the problem was not us, but that the noise of the restaurant itself- music and ambient noise- presented too loud of an environment for groups. Trust me that none of us were drunk and none of us did more than laugh with our friends- I've seen way, way worse at other restaurants and it never even occurred to me to complain. Regardless, I can accept that as a group we may have on occasion gotten a little loud- what made us so uncomfortable was for a restaurant to tell a group that they're being too loud, much less a group paying $658 for dinner. Thankfully we were already at the end of our meal, so my friend canceled her last drink order and we paid  and left- certainly never to return again.",1,1,0,Brandi M.,"New York, NY",69,8,0
4.0,12/3/2014,"Danji has a name that makes me laugh.  Not sure why but it sounds so dramatic, like a prison in Sierra Leone or a fight to the death.  I've often mused this as I've walked between work and the hardware store.  On the contrary, this place is a tiny, quiet tapas restaurant showcasing Korean food.  Not the Korean food of 33rd St. mind you; something a bit more high concept.  I'd always intended on trying it out and finally got the chance very recently.  The place is tightly packed and because of that can be a bit noisy.  There is also only 1 bathroom for men and women which sucks for both parties.  However the mood is nice, and their menus fit into the table using a drawer (this confused me).  Service was good.  It was also funny that almost half the menu lists explicitly spicy food; this turned out not to be a big issue even though my companion did not like spicy food, but it is worth noting for others.  Damn Koreans and their love of spicy.  We got the bulgogi sliders, the scallion pancake, and the kimchi bacon paella.  The sliders came in a pair and while the portion was small, they were very good.  Great bulgogi, with the spicy pickle and scallion ""salsa"" adding a bit of variety.  The scallion pancake was much larger although a bit more boring.  It was fried to a crisp with the pepper being more subdue than I expected.  The paella was my favorite overall because of the large quantity of chunks of bacon employed.  That of course made it a great dish by default.  Also helping were the fried bits of rice and judiciously applied kimchi and egg.  This was basically glorified fried rice and that's all it needed to be.Inexplicable musings and obligatory light racism aside, this was a very enjoyable dining experience.  Danji's (!!!) small size hides some pretty big flavor.  I wouldn't come here with somebody you don't like, but either way at least the food will be good.",2,0,0,Justin L.,"New York, NY",900,1005,34

The bulgogi had a lot of depth of flavor and the bun was buttery goodness. The Garlic Honey wings had a nice sweetness and crispiness and the Short Ribs were quite tender and tasty. The bossam (pork belly) was a bit on the salty side by itself, but with the addition of white rice, it was perfect. There were a couple of misses unfortunately. The trio of kimchee was okay, but severely overpriced for the size of the portion. The kimchee bacon paella was a miss with the scrambled egg and the bland flavor. A sunny side up egg would have fit better with this dish and it needed a bit more sweetness to balance the spice.

3.0,10/17/2014,"Midtown west Korean with a Michelin Star. Can it be the best of the best Korean, albeit, Modern Korean, in town? Chef is well known for his stint with some of the Michelin three star chefs. For Michelin star restaurant, I must admit, one ought to expect more. This is...okay, nothing that special. It's good but not great, could be way better. For what it is, it's decent. Cocktail drinks are good. tofu - as expected, slider - okay, but one must have had much better bulgogi if one's been to Olympic Blvd in LA. Kimchi fried rice is now called kimchi paella, I happen to have had some really amazing paellas, and not necessarily Spanish, in my life and this was at the best, mediocre. Now spicy wings are served a bit lukewarm and did not have the heat punch I was half expecting. Pancake was not what I had expected, Korean pancakes ought to be much less starchy and more substantial in content, this was really just some starchy green onion pancakes. It was the real first meal for me. I was hungry so I ate hasty with my party, but was sufficiently disappointed by the quality of the food afterwards, though I did eat a lot of it that day.Over the years I learned there is a tremendous amount of risk associated with traveling around the world and eating out a lot. You develop a very strong preference for what you like and dislike, you have a certain set of expectations, you have definitely a pre-defined criteria for Michelin star restaurants. A while back a friend and I were chatting about the Michelin rating system. We feel that somehow critics are more forgiving in Paris, nearly every semi decent Parisian restaurant gets a Michelin star. I'd venture to say they are a bit loosy goosy (a technical term of course) in New York these days, handing out Michelin one star like candy. Yet, restaurants in San Francisco tries harder to gain one and they lose the status very quickly. And then you get restaurants in Portland, where they simply do not try yet they pretty much exceed the bar in every category. Has my bar been set too high because of my experience at Per Se, Le Bernadine, and Jean Georges? Would Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare disappoint? Eating out makes me very introspective, like running makes me gain clarity and visiting Cambridge, MA makes me feel melancholy. On that particular night, I thought, have restaurants like State Bird Provisions, Lazy Bear, Benu, COI, and French Laundry made me obnoxious like Anton Ego in Ratatouille? Must I find that one dish to make me gain some perspective? I'm still searching.  Apparently, Danji isn't it.",1,0,1,Victoria E.,"San Francisco, CA",673,819,16212

5.0,10/3/2014,"This little Korean tapas place is adorable and the Michelin star is well-deserved!The atmosphere is cozy and reminiscent of an East Village joint rather than the busy and crazy Hell's Kitchen that it's in. Perhaps its location on a street rather than the avenue helps.The food is delicious: small plates to share with just the right amount of freshness and spicy kick.We tried an assortment of dishes from the traditional and modern menu. The most memorable dish for me was the pork belly sliders. They left a lingering spicy taste in your mouth, the taste of excitement and satisfaction.They don't offer desserts, that's probably the only drawback, but ok for a tapas bar, as it is mostly about small bites and creative cocktails shared with friends.A must try!",0,0,0,Elena A.,"Nyack, NY",4,15,0

This place has bad value, small portions and high prices. Kimchi bacon ""paella."" Umm, good and very flavorful but it was basically fried rice! $20?Bulgogi beef sliders. Ok. Pork belly sliders. Ok (better than the beef one) Sea snails salad. Flavorful, but still not noteworthy. Honey garlic wings were definitely the highlight.",2,1,1,Jenny W.,"New York, NY",202,160,117
4.0,9/28/2014,"You know when you go to one of those places and they are all like ""you need to order 2-3 things per person because portions are small"" and you roll your eyes and think to yourself ""pshh they are just trying to get me to spend more money"" Yeah? Danji is NOT one of those places. You really DO need to order 2-3 things per person and honestly I would do 3 each.I went with a big group of people and we clearly missed the little paper sign in the window that said their system was down so it was ""CASH ONLY"" Yeah for 7 people and a huge bill, not so convenient. A little sign in the window doesn't really cut it.DECORRustic and intimate...very romantic. Just some thoughts that come to mind. This place is small and I bet it fills up quickly so you better make a reservation. It also has a Michelin Star (Korean restaurant with a Michelin star? You heard me).WINEI had a glass of the Gruner veltliner der pollenhof-erwin at only $9 a glass. You betcha it was German. German wine? I think it was my first time trying German wine. She brought us some to sample before ordering and I literally asked ""Was that water?"" It was SOOO smooth. Honestly the smoothest wine I've ever had and so cheap. I am going to look into getting a case of wine for myself as I loved it THAT much. SUPER cheap too. $9 a glass? We aren't talking happy hour people.FOOD - Tapas style+ Yellowtail sashimi with spicy sauce - Holy crap. I LOVE me some yellowtail. This was a unique dish because it had a spicy sauce below the yellowtail but the yellowtail was wrapped around some daikon (same taste as a radish, yum). It's a very small portion as the 4 pieces are rather small so I would suggest you ordering this as your own dish and whoever you are with ordering this as well.+ Calamari - This was actually my favorite dish. Calamari is calamari. It's fried and usually comes with a various array of side sauces and blahblahblah. Hard to really change it up or make it unique but this special blend of seasoning made this my favorite dish of the night. It was SOOO good. This was a bigger portion and can be shared between 2-3 people. Make sure you get the scallion pancake dipping sauce to accompany your calamari (in addition to the sauce they provide with the dish already). YUM.+ Scallion pancake - Very delicious. It's hard to break apart with chop sticks and I probably looked funny attempting to break it into smaller pieces but yeeeeah. The sauce on the side with this is AMAZING. I asked them to bring me a side of this sauce to dip my calamari in (which I stated above).+ ""KFC"" spicy chicken wings - These are spicy. Listen, I'm from Buffalo. We ""invented"" the chicken wing. I know me some good chicken and these were good. They definitely have my stamp of approval.Then came the awkward ending when we were told it was CASH ONLY. Ugh.

Here's the lowdown:Atmosphere: It's a small little trendy space, decorated quite nicely. Located in Midtown/Hell's Kitchen with very friendly service.Food/Drink: I ordered the Soju Sangria, my bf had the Tokyo Drift and we split the wings. The drinks, while decent, weren't overly impressive - especially for $13 each. This is New York, so I'm not saying it's outrageously priced, but I was hoping for a bit more craftiness to it. But, hey, maybe I just don't like soju and I should get over it. The wings, on the other hand, had a unique, spicy flavor to them but they were SOOOOO tiny! I mean, don't they have some sort of catch-and-release program or whatever for the little guys?Price: You'll spend about $13 on a cocktail and $13 on a few tiny wings.Overall: If the wings were bigger or there were more than the 5-6 mini ones we got, I might have upped this to 4 stars. 2 almost-average drinks and a small plate of wings for $45 just didn't feel worth it, especially for the location and all the hype.",0,0,0,Kirsten C.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",99,33,0

4.0,8/22/2014,"Layout/Ambience: Like most places in NYC, the place was small. There was a bar right by the door, two tables of two, and several tables along the wall that could be adjusted to make different seating arrangements. There was also a high table between the bar and restaurant area with about 8-12 seats. Chic interior, great for a date, or a get together with drinks if you manage to get there early. The area is rather cramped and perhaps not the best for private conversations. Food/Service: Danji is a tapas style restaurant with two menus, the traditional menu and the modern menu. Dishes range from $8-$16 each, and it is recommended that each person order two plates. The tofu with soy vinaigrette was phenomenal, I definitely recommend it (I'm always a sucker for garlic). The kfc hot chicken wings were a sour kind of spicy, similar to buffalo sauce. Personally not a fan of that flavor but the wings were cooked so perfectly I devoured them anyways. Also had the honey wings, which were great as well. I didn't like the bulgogi sliders so much. It was a little salty, and as a Korean who eats authentic Korean food at least 4 days of the week I couldn't get through it without some rice ($3). Also the bottom bun gets soggy quickly, so eat eat eat! Finally, the kimchi bacon fried rice was ok but a little too soft for my preference. I like my kimchi fried rice a little more crispy.

But come on, this place is the size of my bathroom. Stop tryna make fancy happen. The bar fits 6-7 people, and the rest of the restaurant ~20. Menu is limited and expensive and came in a really small portion. I know it's a tapas restaurant, but I came to eat... not to nibble. I went with my sister and her boyfriend (they really like this place) and we ordered 7 dishes. It woulda been 8 but they ran out of their wagyu short ribs ugh it was a Sunday night dinner so lame. This is what we ordered.1. Steak Tartare = fyi, you crack the egg on top of the meat and mix it all together. It's very raw. Not for the weak bellied.2. Grilled pork belly & aged kimchi = just whatever. I'm not impressed.3. Yellowtail sashimi = has a nice kick to it.4. Bossam = probably the best thing on the menu. If you're gonna order one thing, it should be this.5. Bulgogi Beef sliders = sooo small but def tasty. I liked that the patty was really juicy and full of flavor.6. Tofu w/ ginger scallion = soft on the inside, crispy on the outside. Tasty.7. Spicy chicken wings = don't get this. This sucked.Drinks:I got the melon makgeolli which was pretty good. Had to ask for more makgeolli though. Sister got the soju sangria which was also suprisingly pretty good, not too sweet with the right amount of soju.I recommend going just to try, but I wouldn't go again. It's just a one time thing.

To start, we ordered a bottle of soju, and to be expected, they asked for identification. We had two under 21s, but we told them only to serve glasses to the ones who were over 21. After stating this to one of the waitresses, she brought over the supervisor who was condescending and rude, demanding that if ""we catch you sharing drinks, we will take your drinks away."" Respectfully, we understood that they could lose their liquor license, but we immediately felt uncomfortable because of their tone. They proceeded to watch cautiously over our table throughout our dinner, which made us feel even more uncomfortable. The food was good, but the initial service left a bad taste in everyone's mouth during dinner. Not worth our time and money and never going there again.

4.0,5/29/2014,"Don't be shocked that the portions are small, Danji is a Korean Tapa restaurant. When I first came here i was definitely impressed by the decor, its a very intimate setting. Perfect spot for date night.It was very clever and unique that the had the menus located in the drawers which are located right under table. My date and I were impressed. Right away the waiter mentioned that its usually suggested that for a party of two, we should order two dishes per person. The menu is separated by traditional and modern taste. We opted for modern menu.Here's what we ordered,-Spicy ""KFC"" Korean Fire Chicken Wings - I love places like Bon Chon and Kyochon so I was excited to try these wings but was very timid about the ""fire"" part. This lead me to believe this dish would be very spicy. I was wrong, This dish is not super spicy, it has just the right amount of kick.. leaving me wanting more. -Crispy Calamari w. Wasabi Mayo - The main reason I wanted to try this is for the Wasabi Mayo sauce. I do not like Wasabi, so I was interested in tasting it in a mix with Mayo. The sauce was amazing and paired well with the calamari. I would definitely recommend this for anyone going to Danji for the first time. -Kimchi Bacon Pepperoni Fried Rice - This dish is stated for 2. This dish is a more ""modern"" take on bibimbap. It wasnt a bad dish but it's something i could pass on.For drinks I would definitely recommend getting the Spicy Ginger Margarita Overall, the food was great and I would come back again, and as for the wait in line, there was no wait.

My friend and I arrived just when they opened for the day so we got seated immediately, but the place filled up really quickly within half an hour or so. As for the food, I was pretty satisfied overall. We got the bulgogi beef sliders and kimchi pork bibimbop to share. The sliders were amazing: the marinated beef, scallion salsa and cucumber kimchi came together really well. I just wish they were slightly bigger, since it was all gone in 3-4 bites or so. The bibimbop was good too, but it wasn't anything too special.Overall, the food here is great and the venue, despite being really small, has a very intimate and trendy feel to it. My only complaint is that it errs on the more expensive side, especially since the portions are rather small. But there is no doubt this is one of the better Korean restaurants in the city!

5.0,5/10/2014,"Danji's a swanky restaurant in Hell's Kitchen, and has a really fascinating modern Korean/American concept. Food is served tapas style, and you can choose from two menus: the ""modern"", which consists of cross-cultural twists on Korean food, and the ""traditional"", which speaks for itself.The decor strongly represents its chic and modernist approach - not in a tired red/black color combination that most nice Asian restaurants tend to, but it was white/grey with lots of industrial elements. Its concession to Asian design were the Korean masks on the wall, and nifty drawers under the table that store your menu, which reminds me of sushi bars in Japan.I got four dishes to share among two. I tried the budae jigae - definitely an upscale version with tons of vegetables and meat and seafood ingredients; korean fried chicken - the marinade was tasty but the batter was a bit too thick and therefore hard; short rib stew that was utterly fork tender and penetrated with flavor, adorned with little onions and carrots. My most favorite dish was the bulgogi beef sliders - I really liked the vegetables for textural contrast plus the super soft bread it was on.Danji is definitely a great place to not only feel cool about your surroundings, but also enjoy what you're putting in your mouth.",0,0,0,Jin C.,"New York, NY",36,1100,328
4.0,5/9/2014,"3.5 stars - With 2 weeks to go and having over 300 booked restaurants left to tackle, my fiance and I decided to give the only Michelin starred Korean restaurant in the city a visit. We arrived around 8PM on a rainy late spring Friday and managed to snatch the last 2 seats. As soon as we were situated, I look a full look at Danji and was surprised at how tiny this place was - yet somehow every patron was screaming on top of their lung aka chatting with the person directly across from him/her. Honestly, my fiance and I could barely hear each other as we were trying to discuss our menu options. Speaking of menu, our hostess failed to inform us that the menu was already placed in the desk drawer. My fiance and I sat around for a good 10 minutes before we waved down our waiter to learn that the menus were waiting there for us all along. We prob should have asked earlier.Onto the food - our server took her time in explaining the menu (traditional vs modern Korean tapas) and recommended 2-3 plates per person. My fiance and I weren't particularly hungry so we decided on 3 dishes including 1 which was portioned to 2 servings - Bossam, Poached Sablefish, and Kimchi Fried Rice (for 2). The bossam was first to arrive - 6  pieces of juicy, fatty braised pork served with steamed lettuce and pickled kimchi. Aside from the fact that the pork was a bit too saucy/salty, I find the pairing with the steamed lettuce (balanced out the saltiness of the braising sauce) and spicy kimchi (added the needed crunch) to be just perfect. The poached sablefish was next - beautiful, flaky white fish filet - the sauce actually tasted very similar to the Bossam's - perhaps just a tad sweeter but again a bit too salty to my taste - nevertheless, easily my fav dish of the night. Kimchi fried rice - after seeing pictures after pictures of it on yelp - we decided to  give it a try even though my fiance isn't the biggest kimchi fan. Served on a sizzling pan, the fried rice was lightly crusted at the bottom which gave it a nice toasted/crunchy texture. The rice was perfectly seasoned and not oily like the usual kimchi fried rice I find in K-town. However for $20 and with endless glowing reviews/recommendations, we expected far more from this dish - it was still just a regular kimchi fried rice to us. After blowing through the 3 dishes, my fiance and I realized we had wayyyy under-ordered. Our stomachs were still growling so we asked our server for a dessert menu. To our surprise, they didn't have one - in fact, no desserts! Whoa, a no dessert restaurant - not even ice cream? Instead of going back to the main dishes, we remembered the tubs of ice cream waiting on us at home and decided to just call it a night..   Service was attentive and warm (water glasses never empty). Food was good but fell short for my expectation especially for a Michelin 1 starred restaurant. (again I'm comparing it to restaurants like Bouley). And although each dish was purposely presented one at a time to give guests ample amount of time to enjoy and share, my fiance and I wished they were served all at once so we could have some taste and texture contrasts. It got pretty boring eating a a whole filet of sablefish /spoon after spoon of fried rice.   Price was definitely on the steep side (3 non-filling dishes for $70+ including tax and tip )- Nevertheless,, my fiance and I had a fabulous dinner date even though our bellies didn't quite agree.",0,0,0,Wing C.,"Pasadena, CA",213,1497,10231

Most of what we ordered was delicious and brought me back to the days where I'd drown myself in kimchi and braised beef. They even threw in a free shooter of some sort because we were flexible in moving our table so a larger party could be seated.

4.0,3/9/2014,"Well, if you want to dine at Danji, you need to be patient and not claustrophobic.  Last night, I had difficulty with those requirements.  The hostess is all over the place and tough to track down.  This wouldn't be so problematic if in order to speak with her you didn't have to stand in the tiny space between the wall and the bar to do so.  It's VERY tight and unpleasant.  We put our name down and were told to come back in 20-30 minutes.  We showed up in 30 and ended up having to wait another 20.  The standing really started to get to me but we were lucky enough to be seated at one of the free standing two tops at the back of the restaurant rather than sitting at a communal table; this helped to ameliorate much of my frustration.  The service is good once you sit down.  Our waitress was fine with us staggering our order.  The food was good.  The tofu is great--I definitely could have devoured a few more plates of it. The scallion pancake was tasty, I probably would not go out of my way for it.  The honey wings and fried rice were both hot and tasty.  All in all, the portions are small but the food is comforting and goes great with a cocktail or an ice cold beer.  In some ways it's nice that they don't take reservations, as you can plan to eat there last minute but just be sure to have a more comfortable place to wait as you are counting down the minutes until you are seated.",6,1,1,Julie M.,"New York, NY",256,553,27

Our table was split across two 8 tops, with 6 of our party and two complete strangers at each table. If you come here with a group, 8 is the magic number. In the large group, we were able to order a whole bunch of stuff:Steak tartar - pretty good. Nice portion of tender steak, but a touch lacking in salt. Fried tofu - probably the best of the night. Crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside. This, I can happily recommend. Scallion pancake - fluffy pancakes with 2 inch long pieces of scallion. Nice version of an old friend. Korean fried wings - meh. I think after having the fried chicken at Momofuku, no other Korean wings will ever compare. These were overly smothered in sauce and not especially crispy. Nothing special here. Bulgogi sliders - I've had some killer bulgogi many times and places... This was not close to any of my past experiences. It just seemed bland to me, like the beef had been boiled in water and all flavor leached out.Spicy pork sliders - slightly spicy, more sweet, but better than the bulgogi. This was fine, but I didn't love it.  Sablefish - this dish was executed well. The fish was cooked nicely and the sauce was good. Only complaint here is the tiny portion. Kimchi fried rice - I took a bite and in my head just simply said ""no.""  There is no reason in the world to make a pepperoni pizza fried rice. It's just not good. It is the kind of dish an 8 year old would create. Total bill came out to about $90 per person, all in. Not exactly a cheap meal for tapas style food, and subpar tapas style food at that.

Crispy Calamari with Wasabi Mayo- This was probably one of the best crispy calamari dishes that I have ever ordered.  It didn't make me feel gross from the frying 2. Spicy KFC Korean Fried chicken- These were great!3. Spicy Yellowtail Sashimi-  The fish was quite fresh and with the jalapeño, it added a nice zest to it!  I loved it!4. Spicy Pork Belly Sliders- These somehow turned out way too saucy for us.  It was my least favorite.5. Kim Chi Bacon Spam Fried Rice- Different flavors with the bacon but it was delicious!6. Scallion & Korean Pepper Pancake-  Simple traditional korean dish but I always like it every time I eat it!Drinks:1. Korean Pear- it was refreshing but a tad too sweet to my liking.  It was different because they incorporated an asian ingredient of star anise.  2. Spicy Ginger Margarita- I was able to taste my friend's drink AND at the end of our meal, we were complimented each with a shot of this drink.  Definitely spicy if you like your jalapeño!!The only reason why I give it one less star is that I think I can go back to K-town and order similar dishes and still have it hit my spot versus going to a Michelin rated restaurant for triple the price!  Give Danji a try though if you want to splurge or potentially see a celebrity!!!",3,0,1,Kathy D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",2136,1124,541
2.0,2/11/2014,"This place was a real let down, considering that it has been consistently awarded a Michelin star. My friends and I came here on a Friday night and we were told that the wait was 45 minutes. After waiting for more than an hour in the freezing weather, we were getting tired, annoyed, and hungry. When our table was finally ready, we squeezed our way towards it only to see that we were given a communal table and had to fit ourselves in between two other parties (there really wasn't much room). This normally wouldn't be a big deal. However, the seats were like the tallest and most uncomfortable bar stools ever. After somehow planting myself on the seat, we ordered a whole bunch of stuff. The tapas concept I liked very much because it allows you to enjoy a variety of dishes while sharing with your friends. Sadly, all of the food was just meh which was a huge bummer :( I really thought I would be getting some crazy good food here but unfortunately our meal did not leave a good impression. Really wish we had gone to k town instead....Service at this place was good, but other than that I don't really have much reason to return.

They were flexible about starting our dinner service at the bar and transferring to a table once available. I was a bit skeptical about eating fancy Korean tapas at fancy tapas prices since I usually get my Korean fix in K-town, but the chef had a few nice tricks up his sleeve. The Spicy Ginger Margarita was a good way to start the meal - tequila, ginger, lime, jalapeño, and orange. You MUST order the Poached Sablefish w. Spicy Daikon. One of the most tender pieces of fish that has ever entered my mouth. The Danji Braised Short Ribs were delicious with fall-off-the-bone meat. We rounded out our tapas selection with some Spicy KFC Korean Fire Chicken Wings and Spicy Pork Belly Sliders.

4.0,2/2/2014,"Intrigued by the idea of Korean tapas, my family checked this place out last night. The restaurant decor is extremely trendy with bare walls, filament bulbs hung in cages from the ceiling, and long cafeteria style tables housing each diner's menu in tiny, individual drawers. The wait staff was very pleasant and our waitress was helpful as we chose between small plates. It's recommended that you order two tapas per person. We wound up getting a bit less than  that and leaving full.So, what to order?Definitely try: -Poached sablefish with spicy daikon: the fish was extremely light and the sweet and sour sauce was heavenly. Definitely get a side of rice to sop up the sauce. -Tofu with ginger scallion dressing: this is a dish you will not find elsewhere. The tofu, which has an amazingly smooth texture, is covered in crispy tempura flakes and coated with a soy vinaigrette. -Braised short ribs: the meat melts in your mouth it's so tender and juicy.-Bossam: braised pork which you wrap in cabbage with a spicy kimchi and scallions. Really yummy!If you're interested, try:-Scallion and Korean pepper pancakes: reminiscent of the scallion pancakes you would order from a local take out Chinese restaurant, these fried pancakes are crispy and delicious. -Kimchi bacon spam fried rice: served with a fried egg on top, this smoky rice dish has great texture and flavor. But this plate wasn't as morish as the others--after a few bites, you get the idea. Avoid:-Spicy whelk salad with buckwheat noodles: the sea snails were cold, chewy lumps on top of a few greens and the noodles (also cold) were covered in too much sauce for my likingOverall, this place is worth visiting. As with all tapas places, it's more fun to go with a group and sample as much as possible. But don't bring too large a group--the place is tiny and the lines are long.

But afraid of long waits, I avoided this place for a while. We arrived at 6:30pm on a freezing Saturday night and found there to be no wait.  The waitress graciously took us to our table - a communal one with drawers which menus were placed in - and poured us drinks.  This was cute, and I assumed it'd be the start to a wonderful food night.Or not.  Almost everything was over-doused in sauce.  From the Welch Salad to the pork belly burgers to the ginger tofu, the food greatly crossed the line in terms of sauce ratio.  To add to our misery, the kimchi trio brought out soft kimchi, as if it had been drenched in sauce for too long (see the pattern here?)  The only thing descent was the sablefish, which at a huge price tag for a tiny bowl, makes it seem not worth it either.We managed to become full with $30 / person including tip and sake.  This is an excellent deal for a Michelen starred restaurant.  But then again, it was not deserving of its Michelen star.",0,0,0,Buggy Z.,"Cambridge, MA",242,307,748

The KFC wings are really good.  The beef noodles and beef sliders are ok.  I actually mentioned to the manager that I was surprisingly disappointed with my meal (and the drinks) given Danji's reputation. She said to come back and gave recommendations for next time.  She also said that even though they don't take reservations, we could get seated immediately next time which didn't really appease me - it's not like Danji is one of those really hot 2 hour wait restaurants.  I also don't know what she had in mind if we came back but I personally do not think this is a way to satisfy a customer - telling them to come back without knowing what will come out of a subsequent meal after a disappointing experience will certainly not entice me to go back. The situation could have been easily rectified on the spot by offering to try one of the dishes she highly recommended or a round of margaritas that were not weak.  Perhaps my expectations on customer satisfaction are too high.",1,0,0,J P.,"New York, NY",0,56,0

We ordered the two lunch sets, soy ginger pork belly and beef brisket meals, each comes with a daikon soup and 2 sides of kimchi. For 18 per set, the dishes were reasonably priced (my partner thinks overpriced but hey, it's a new concept fusion Asian joint..) but both were lacking in different ways. The soy ginger pork belly had this mayo over the rice that resembled spicy mayo in Japanese sushi rolls, which is a bit overwhelming with the already seasoned soy ginger pork belly. The beef brisket was sparse and thin, not nearly enough for a lunch combo set. The service was definitely lacking but they were packed with only 3 servers/manager/workers so I understand.

2.0,12/1/2013,"This place is ideal for younger people with money who want a ""modern"" ""trendy"" ""Korean"" food experience on a date in midtown west. I was not their target audience, but my wife and I decided to try this place out, since it was close by.Firstly, the food is good, though not worth raving about. My wife and I enjoyed the whelk salad, which you don't find in many places. the Soba missed al dente by a few seconds and wound up to be a bit on the hard side. Bossam arrived next. The flavor was indeed modernized/stylized version of the traditional bossam. Then the hot chicken wings, which were very saucy and hot. Fried rice arrived on a hot plate with a very orange yolked sunny-side-up egg. You can't really mess up fried rice, except it was a bit too salty.The main takeaway from the food experience is that the servings a extremely small for the price you pay. The side of kimchi provided cucumber, traditional kimchi and radish kimchi. 5 small pieces of radish kimchi. 4 cabbage pieces for the bossam with a teaspoon serving of the dried spiced daikon. Fried rice that was noted ""for 2"" is about half the amount you would get for a regular bibimbap at a Korean restaurant in Ktown. Traditional bossam would have the spicy kimchi fillings, oysters, many more and larger cabbage leaves and pork pieces accompanied by spicy pastes. In the end we paid ~$90 and left less hungry than when we came in but for $90, even in Ktown, you can get a similarly wide array of foods and leave on a wheel barrow having eaten beyond your fill.Perhaps tapas (in a Korean food context) means half the food for twice the price? Or this is the price you pay for a ""trendy"" ""modern"" korean food experience? Supposedly the food is organic and sourced locally and whatnot, which demands a price premium?On food quality alone this would be 4 stars, but on Value the rating drops to 2 stars at best. As noted by other reviewers, the venue is small. It is also well-lit, cozy, and trendy with a separator from the stool seating and the table seating by a divider of old spoons.

5.0,10/31/2013,"Danji is a perfect example of the importance of location and good PR. Move it to the East Village and replace its publicist and its talented chef Hooni Kim would be the David Chang of Korean cuisine - likely opening is 11th restaurant in the VIP section of some new Macau casino.  The fact that he is instead toiling away in the kitchen of Danji is a real treat to the residents of restaurant-starved Hells Kitchen (or is it Clinton these days?) Like Mr. Chang, Kim spent his early career in the kitchens of the New York's five star eateries and has taken his exceptional technique and interest in the finest ingredients and applied both to an Asian cuisine not known for high quality produce and often relegated to the dives of 32th street. My most recent visit Danji produced one of the finest meals I've eaten this year, every course better than the next - with none of the low points that plagued meals at his ""hipper"" Flatiron outpost Hanjan. The fact that Hanjan was awarded more stars by the New York Times (2 vs 1) than Danji I regard as a tragic mistake. Designed as a tapas style menu, any meal must include the French inspired steak tartare. It's quite simply the most flavorful, most expertly prepared version in New York. Had it been paired with brioche you could have been forgiven for thinking you were at La Grenouille or Jean-Georges. The de rigueur quail yolk was certainly present but none of Danji's Gallic competitors would have had the forethought to pair such perfectly diced beef with toasted pine nuts, asian pear and soy. A pajeon (scallion pancake) had none of the traditional oily heaviness and its intricate latticework of scallions, hot peppers and  puffy batter melded to create an item wouldn't have fit right in a summer fair's funnel cake booth. With a bossam of perfectly cook pork belly (far more delicate than Momofuku's version of the dish), bulgogi beef sliders, a trio of kimchi, an ethereal fried tofu and an interesting Riesling our party of 3 spent only $140.

This is more like Korean tapas than the fanciful full course meals that traditional Korean places serve, with abundant selection of side dishes.  We opted for the bibimbap as well as beef sliders that were tasty albeit a bit small.

Bulgogi sliders. Authentic, but elevated in flavor and complexity. I think I recreated the ""I'll have what she's having"" scene from When Harry Met Sally on my first bite. I adore the tofu as well -- incredible textures and nuance of flavor. I always get the soju sangria. Bright, light, refreshing, not too terribly sweet but toward the sweet end of the cocktail spectrum. To be honest, the cheese ddukbokki wasn't fantastic. I haven't ordered off of the ""traditional"" menu, but if you really wanted traditional, I would think you'd be in K-town or Flushing.

Our appy plates were changed with every course.  We were asked ""how everything was"" like 5 times.  It was great until our server forgot one of our dishes.  Drinks - We ordered the spicy ginger margarita which was sweet and tart like most margaritas, not too strong but it went down fast and at $13 a piece for a short glass filled with ice the bill can add up quickly.  The hubby ordered the O-eeee drink which came in a tall glass with a slice of English cucumber.

4.0,10/3/2013,"Came here because my friend wanted to come here. I was a bit uncertain of what this place was, as I didn't get a chance to yelp it. They don't take reservationsWhen you enter this establishment, it's a bit hard to figure out how everything works, but find the hostess, and she'll take your name and phone number. Chances are the wait is 30min-1.5hr for 2 people to 5 people respectively. This place just isn't that great for small groups. There is also no place to wait, which is why they take a phone number down. You leave and they'll call you when your spot is about to open up. Our small group eventually got broken off, and so it was just me and my friend left. We were seated in about 30 minutes at the bar. We just came from a wine bar, so no alcohol for us tonight, we also had work to do after.Enough about that though, let's talk about food.The food was 5/5! This is what we got:Tofu - The tofu had a cheese like consistency. The balance of flavour was nice. It wasn't drenched in sauce. We ate this dish and knew the night was going to be good.Bulgogi Sliders - These sliders (2) were decent. The buns were nice and crispy, and the meat was juicy. I'm not sure what it was, but something was just a hint off for me here. Sablefish - omgomgomg, this fish was nice and meaty, poached perfectly. If there is one thing to get, it's this. The sauce was declicious and fish cooked perfectly. It's firm and soft all at the same time. Flavourful and balanced. Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience. Minus one star for the insane wait time and no waiting space. The food I really enjoyed.

5.0,9/25/2013,"I'm rarely blown away by a new restaurant, but that's what happened tonight at Danji. I went with five friends who are visiting from Colombia and Chile. None of them had ever had Korean food before, so it was a real culinary adventure. Since we were a pretty big party, we ordered lots of different things and I got to try a wide variety of dishes. Danji splits its menu into ""traditional"" and ""modern"" sections. On the traditional side, we sampled the following: --Spicy whelk salad w. buckwheat noodles. Delicious! The noodles were firm and tossed in a lovely spicy sauce; the whelk was satisfyingly chewy and served with a small pile of bright tasting greens--Steak tartare w. quail yolk. Hands down the best steak tartare I've ever eaten. It was soft and flavorful, studded with pine nuts and asian pear. And the unctuousness of the yolk brought it all together. I'll be dreaming about this dish for weeks to come. --Scallion & Korean pepper pancake. Super tasty fried pancake, which comes with a tangy sauce. Couldn't stop eating it. A tad greasy, though.--Poached sablefish w. spicy daikon. Succulent fish that's steeped in savory flavors. The daikon offers a lovely contrast. Incredible.--Spicy seafood soft tofu stew. So good I just wanted to slurp the whole thing down all at once. The tofu comes in huge rounded blocks of subtle silkiness. The broth is spicy and rich with seafood aromas. --Trio of kimchi. Pretty self-explanatory, except that it's incredibly delicious and a wonderful way to perk up and clear the palate between courses. The modern dishes included: --Spicy yellowtail sashimi. Yummy. The jalapeno pepper and piquant sauce are an excellent complement to what's already a great sliver of fish. I've tried this at Nobu, but Danji does it really well. --Crispy calamari w. wasabi mayo. One of the best calamari dishes I've had in a long time. The wasabi mayo is a revelation. The calamari is light and crispy, though a tad salty, which only heightened my guilty pleasure. --Bulgogi beef sliders. Absolutely delectable. Pulled Korean BBQ beef on a soft buttered brioche with some kind of special sauce (kimchi aioli?).--Bossam. Braised chunks of pork, rimmed with luscious fat, accompanied by thin sheets of cabbage and daikon kimchi. Damn.I also drank a carafe of soju (kind of like sake, but stronger and just as delicious).

The side of cabbage and spicy daikon are the perfect complements. - Dduk-bokki - I enjoyed the sliced pickled red peppers that topped off the dish. They add a nice flavor and the dduk (rice cake) was soft and chewy the way it should be. The fact that it's tossed in pork fat doesn't hurt either.- Kimchi Bacon Spam ""Paella"" - basically fancy fried rice. It comes out on a hot skillet. I kept it on for a few minutes to get those nice crispy pieces on the bottom. - Garlic Honey Wings - wouldn't necessarily recommend this one. The sesame flavor is overpowering - definitely had better wings at a bar or some hole in the wall.DRINKS:- Pink Crush - it's a ""girly"" looking drink as the name would suggest, but delicious. If you're not a big fan of hard liquor this drink does a good job masking the alcohol. - Soju Sangria - tastes similar to wine sangria, but a bit lighter and almost watered down tasting? I thought it was weak, but I felt it a bit later ;)- Danji Colada - basically just tastes like coconut and pineapple juice. Nothing really special there.Overall a great experience.

1.0,7/21/2013,"Well, to begin with, we were really looking forward to trying Danji so we decided to try it this past Saturday night. We first tried to call the restaurant to make reservation, but were told that they did not accept reservations unless a party of six or more. No problem. However, when we arrived when we came in the hostess initially tried to sit us at a community table where the people are packed in quite closely even though there were empty tables for too which were considerably more comfortable. When I asked why we could not be seated in one of the empty tables for two, the hostess said ""oh, that's for someone with a reservation"". When I mentioned that I did not understand because I had called and was told they did not accept reservations for two, she said exactly the same thing ""oh, that's for someone who has reservations"". As I am standing there, and quickly becoming not amused, another girl walks up and says ""so sorry, that table is for friends and family for the chef"". So ok, fine. I don't buy it. It's either a reservation or not, so someone is not telling the truth. Certainly did not rub me the right way especially since they are packing patrons in all together like sardines when there are unused more comfortable empty tables. Ok fine. We are here for the food, let's not worry about other stuff. So we sit down. It is uncomfortably hot -- ac is on, but we are still sweating, but we try to be patient. The waitress comes by and takes our order. Then we sit and admire the cute theme of the place which is somewhat clever. I also had ordered some Soju as well. Now typically, in a nice restaurant with good service, they bring your drinks relatively early, especially when it's fairly busy and there is a long wait for food. Only thus far, after quite some time no drinks yet, and I see the two waitresses standing in the corner hanging out and talking with each other. This goes on for several minutes, even though it's saturday night with a restaurant full of waiting people. Finally the waitress comes near us to clear some plates from another table and I politely mentioned I would not mind having my drinks now while waiting for the food (yes, I waited several minutes while she was sitting around talking). After mentioning this she quickly brings the drinks. So we sit, perhaps another 20 minutes or so, perhaps 25. Another couple are seated next to us on the sardine table (yes the empty table for two still has no one in it, and now there is another couple of empty tables as well). The couple next to us orders (and we noticed ), ordered almost the same things that we have ordered. To our surprise, the table next to us received there food before we did. I noticed they ordered exactly what we did (for I thought perhaps we might have ordered something that took more time to prepare??). But no, they ordered the exact same things and were served even though they just came in and we had been sitting there now pushing 30 minutes. Seriously? So I got up and went to the nearest server and asked for the manager. After a few minutes, and some commotion between the workers a girl arrived and began to apologize profusely. She said, ""so sorry, we can't find your ticket. It never showed up in the kitchen????"". Now, I don't know what happened, but to be quite honest, I am not feeling like anything is an accident here. Now before jumping to conclusions and thinking I created some scene or not, I want to tell you we are just like you. We are just looking to enjoy a nice dinner and not looking for a headache. Needless to say, being accustomed to knowing the difference between good service and poor service, falling short is not lost to us. So now the staff seems to have picked up the pace (given that our order was ""lost""). They said they would take the drinks off of the bill and gave us a free dish. Ok we think, at least they are attempting to correct some of the unpleasantries we had to endure. So finally we get to the most important stuff. After all the fanfare about a Michelin star, yes, we had high expectations. With the exception of the bossum (sp?), we actually found the dishes to be fair, and not terrific. The sushi dish was somewhat dry and not particularly fresh, and the sauce tasted like that Vietnam hot pepper sauce right from the bottle vs. something fresh made. The other dishes were clever and pretty, but in our opinion not as good as something you get at Kunjip in Korea Town. So net-net, we were so much looking forward to trying Danji. It is a clever idea, and could be such a cool place, but the execution does not do justice to the idea. We were hopeful that the food itself would make us forget all the issues with the poor service, but rather it just solidified our opinion that Danji falls way short. We give it one star because frankly for 1-Michelin star, we think they should ask for it back (for the not-so-fresh sushi alone).

I don't care if it's overpriced--we tried maybe 7 things off their menu and all were terrific.  Highlights for me were the beef sliders--the beef topped with kimchi pickles--and the spicy whelk salad w. buckwheat noodles, aka the ""golbaengi moochim w. bibim soba gooksoo"".  I could do without the whelk (sea snail) itself, but the rest of it was delish, and also I greatly enjoyed saying ""golbaengi moochim w. bibim soba gooksoo"".  In fact, I propose Danji offers a discount special: if you are not Korean and you can say ""golbaengi moochim w. bibim soba gooksoo"" ten times fast, you get it for free.  The yellowtail sashimi was also tops.There were a few disappointments, but they were minor.  The kimchi trio looked better than it was--it's not that the kimchi was bad, just that I've had better and its flavor was very mild.  Also, no dessert!  (You can use this as an opportunity, though: Casselula and Taboon down the street have lovely desserts.)The drinks were good: I had the 5-2 aka the O-ee, a cool cucumber-gin drink perfect for a hot day.  My partner in crime tonight had the sangria, which I tried and liked because it tasted like it was sweetened only with fruit, so it was very mellow, not overly sweet.Other notes:- Sitting at the bar is fun if you can get in there.  - The acoustics are crummy.  It gets pretty loud.- I got here at 6 because I like to pretend I am a grandparent, but this place got busy by 6:45 and I noticed them turn some people away.

Super trendy Korean tapas bar with a great (slightly crowded) vibe and delicious food. My only complaint was that I was too full to eat more. When it comes to Korean food I do have high expectations since I lived there for six years. This place took me right home. The tofu is a must try, the bulgogi sliders are amazing, the kimchi trio is a must, as is the fish. The panjang was good but not my all time favorite panjang in the world, the calamari and spicy chicken wings were good but was overshadowed by all the other great food.If you want a super intimate dinner this isn't the place for you.

My second fav dish was the kimchi bacon paella with a fried egg on top....the very definition of umami...wow. Rice cakes with kimchi were very spicy and the cakes had that great gelatinous texture I love. The steak tartare with Asian pear was also great, really good balance between the rich, faintly spicy tartare and the crunchy juliennes of sweet, tangy pear. All dishes were homeruns. Is it authentic Korean? Probably not, judging from what some less-than-enthusiastic Korean yelpers have said in their reviews. is it a bit pricey for casual Korean small plates?

Crispy outside, fluffy inside.-crispy calamari w. wasabi mayo - best calamari I've ever had, when the dish first came out, I was a little underwhelmed and regretted ordering it, but was glad I did after I took my first bite. Not crispy, but I could tell it was battered, and the most tender squid I've had. And the wasabi mayo, up there with cuban green ""crack sauce."" With that said, I probably wouldn't order this again, it was still very conventional, and they have so many other things that sound good.-bossam - best bossam ever. not being hyperbolic (wait... is that a real word?).

3.0,5/30/2013,"This review is more like a two.eight.As Korean ""cuisine"" becomes all the rage (and I do love traditional Korean food), certain types of food should just not be f'd around with. For instance, making Korean food into a ""tapas"" style dish just does not work for me. Not only were the prices astronomical, but if you want to have your fill you're gonna have to order a hefty amount of it. Coming as a party of three, and where one was Korean (so yes, tastes and etc. were validated) we all left unsatisfied. Together we all had the gochu pajeon, spicy pork belly sliders, bossam, and haemul soondoobu jji-gae. Now, not that these items tasted bad. But just the fact that other than the sliders, everything else was a mini-sized version of their originals. Some were spicier than expected such as the pork sliders, but that wasn't bad. But for what you're paying at this place, you might as well head over to Koreatown or some other Korean restaurant and really get your stomachs filled with something that tastes just as good or better.If you want Korean food, this place isn't for you.

3.0,5/26/2013,"I agree with other reviewers that Danji is pricey for the quantity of food received. That being said, the quality is excellent (though I must admit the only other Korean place I have been to/ordered from in Manhattan is Bon Chon). We had the mesclun salad, chicken wings, scallion pancake, bulgogi beef sliders, and the whelk salad. The dressing on the mesclun salad was particularly delicious, even though we had to send it back after noticing a plastic piece of the salad spinner in the bowl...well at least you know that they wash the lettuce :) We even enjoyed the whelk salad with squid (at least I think it was squid) which was surprising since my husband and I don't like seafood; I don't read Korean, so how was I to know?  I downgraded to three stars because of the price/quantity ratio and the fact that the first time we tried to dine here (Saturday night) we waited over an hour and a half for a table even though the hostess said it was a 45 minute wait. I gave up after an hour and went to a Thai place on 9th. I wouldn't have minded the hour and a half wait if that's what was expected. Second time was around 7:30 on a Tuesday and we were seated within 5 minutes. I think if you know that you are in for a fairly expensive meal that will leave you far from stuffed, you shouldn't be disappointed with Danji.

It's a place that tries to make Korean comfort food into something fancy, which strikes me as somewhat of an oxymoron, but Danji being featured on some travel/food show I watched, I was curious to try it out. First up, bulgogi ddukboki - mediocre. Dry, barely spicy, and super small portion (really, cost of rice cakes is so cheap!). The short ribs were delicious though - fall off the bone tender, taste just like mom's... but you only get one hearty piece. Kimchi bacon paella is just kimchi fried rice. There is no paella, rather disappointed. Finally the spicy wings, which had heat but really tasted like average wings you can get at a bar. So overall, a lackluster experience, way over priced for the portions you get, and serves me right for walking right into it knowing it would be.

And how this recipe will eventually die out, because I will not be able to carry it on. But at Danji, this tradition will carry on, alive and well for a very long time.

Needless to say, I must agree more with the negative reviews.We went for dinner on a Monday evening and were seated right away. Although the server was generally nice, customer service seemed to lack on the hostess' end. When we were seated at the long table next to the wall, I had an Evian bottle water on the table tucked against the wall corner (which I didn't plan on drinking during the meal by the way). Somehow the hostess seemed to think it was a good idea to awkwardly reach behind me and get within less than a foot of my face to grab the water bottle and put it on the floor. Apparently, it didn't occur to her that a simple verbal request would have sufficed.The plates were small and pricey, and I wasn't blown away by them. We ordered:- bulgogi beef sliders- poached sablefish w. spicy daikon- vermicelli noodles w. beef & korean peppers- tofu w. ginger scallion dressing- 'danji' braised short ribs w. fingerlingsWhen I requested to have these dishes come out around the same time, the server stated he can only bring one dish out at a time so that customers can experience and savor the flavor. So when the server brought out one mediocre dish out at a time, I was left to ponder between each dish on where we could eat afterwards to fill the remaining part of our hunger. After the fifth dish, we decided to just leave and eat somewhere else. I wouldn't mind paying a high amount for excellent food, but for mediocre food? No thanks.My advice?

4.0,3/13/2013,"Finally tried Danji of Hooni Kim and Michelin Star fame. In short, long wait (30+ min) on a Monday night at 7:30pm, but not horrible considering we just walked in (I think they take limited reservations). Place is tiny, narrow, with a very small bar as you walk in. Overall I think the food is great. Tried 4 dishes for 2 people (tapas style), 2 from the traditional and 2 from the modern. Left satisfied, but being Korean, I think next time I'd avoid the traditional as it were just traditional dishes I'm used to, but much smaller in portion and much more expensive in price. I don't need to go to Danji to eat a pancake or korean stew. The modern menu was more interesting and I'll likely keep to that next time. I'd say the drawbacks is you are paying a premium for Korean food, but I don't mind so much for the modern menu since its all new twists on traditional food (bulgogi sliders, which are ok, but very simple for the price and almost reminded me of food from something you'd get from the Korilla truck) and the Paella (chorizo adds a nice twist). Portions are not large so for two people ordering 4 shared plates and 2 drinks came out to $120 total. Not expensive, but certainly not cheap. But overall I was pleaesd with the experience, just hope his next restaurant (Hanjan, which I haven't been yet) is a bit larger in space, as I'm not a big fan of cramped quarters, even if it is Manhattan.",0,0,0,Jiho S.,"New York, NY",74,569,138
5.0,3/10/2013,"This review is for our bartender/server/actor/screenwriter/etc basically a 'Joe of all trades'.  The meal at Danji is rather remarkable for a fusion Korean restaurant, but to have it served by someone who takes such great passion in his work and food (even though much like all other New York restaurant waitstaff, his SAG card was creeping out of his pants).  Unlike his SAG colleagues/typical NY waitstaff, HE ACTUALLY ENJOYED AND SHOWED PASSION FOR HIS JOB AS A SERVER!What a difference it makes having that level of service.  My friend and I were comfortable allowing him to order our entire meal and pair drinks accordingly.  I can only wish this menial message can serve as a testament to other waitstaff in NYC.Sidebar - Oh so you don't think I am too biased, I would like to add that much like the rest of NYC restaurants, his objective was also to turn over tables quickly, but I never got that impression.  Funny, isn't that?",0,1,1,Steven T.,"Northbrook, IL",5,133,3
4.0,3/5/2013,"I'm a big fan of Danji, and this is coming from a Korean American. This is one of my favorite Korean restaurants in Manhattan (and by the way, I wouldn't count any of the Momofuku restaurants as real Korean). The menu is split into traditional Korean and modern fusion twists. Both sides of the menu are generally very good.Food is sort-of ""tapas"" style in that I recommend that you and your fellow diners split a variety of dishes to try and taste as much as possible. Portion sizes are on the small-side so you may need 2-3 of them to fill you up. And unlike most Korean restaurants, they don't give you banchan (the assorted Korean side dishes) or even kimchi (the kimchi trio costs $6).Both the bulgogi and spicy pork belly sliders are very good and bursting with flavor. But the highlight for me is the bossam. Very different from the way it's served as Momofuku Ssam but in some ways even better (though the portion size is significantly less and at $20 is probably overpriced). The galbi jjim is good and the meat was very tender but it wasn't the best that I've had and was probably the most forgettable dish that I've tried there, especially when I compare it to the beautiful versions of it that I've tried in Korea. I would also recommend trying the yellowtail sashimi, which literally melts into your mouth.The restaurant itself is quite small and is usually packed (expect a wait). But the design is nice, clean, and modern. The servers generally aren't Korean and so sometimes I felt as if I knew more about the dishes than they did, which is problematic. Danji has recently been getting a lot of media attention and also earned a coveted Michelin star. Does it deserve it?

The bulgogi sliders were easily the best dishes, and the rest of them were pretty good. Food-wise, the quality is a little better than other K-town places, but you can get decent quality food for cheaper than here; the jap chae, for example, was really nothing special or different than standard K-town fare.

It was recommended to me by a Korean friend and since then I've taken my other Korean friend (who is actually from Korea) and she has gone back many times and taken many of her friends there also. It's great to find a Korean place outside of K-Town (although I wish it was in the village and not in gross Hells Kitchen). Despite its crummy location, I go here all the time! It's the only restaurant I trek uptown for (besides Shun Lee cafe when I'm craving dimsum).One thing you have to be prepared for when you go here is to WAIT (as they don't take reservations) in a cramped spot by the bar (which will rarely have a seat free for you since people also eat at the bar). You will have to keep asking the hostess if your table is ready, and you will have to be patient. However, I guarantee you it's worth the wait!What to order: scallion and korean pepper pancake (although it's a bit greasy), vermicelli noodles with beef and korean peppers (they can do it without the beef also for vegetarians), tofu with ginger scallion dressing (so good that you should probably get two orders), bulgogi beef sliders (amazing), spicy pork belly sliders (bulgogi sliders are better), spicy yellow tail sashimi, bossam, and sable fish (not sure they still have it).

4.0,2/11/2013,"I had the pleasure of having Xiaofan C. as my guest during this lovely dinner at Danji. It was memorable because: 1) we haven't sat down mono e mono since high school and 2) she rarely indulges in food. Xiaofan C. is rail skinny, model-like height and probably munches on carrots instead of real food. Therefore, Danji was immediately on my radar after she incessantly raved about it. My first thoughts of Danji were embarrassing and comical. With the advent of ""modern"" Asian cuisine, I expected the food to be along the lines of Korilla and Social Eatz, which were also rising to fame contemporaneously. I was thinking more along the lines of hipster meets traditional Asian fare, blasphemous in my mind, but as the ""in"" thing, it was a necessary evil. Instead, I was completely mistaken.  If Korilla was the gangster younger brother that listened to hip hop, wore baggy clothes, hat backwards, stoge in hand tagging up your local Burger King while cutting school, then Danji was the older brother, with a Masters and PhD, the elegant side part, tailor made by Savile Row, volunteers at the local soup kitchen and ran marathons in his spare time. Both had their complexities, both had their personalities, both lovable in their own way, but you felt there was something deeper to Danji. Something beyond the immaculate facade you bequeathed it.You could hardly go wrong whether it's from the modern or the traditional menus. We went with a mix of bossam (XFC's fave), braised short ribs, and a couple of others. Each dish was intricate and satisfying to the palate. Each dish was portioned just right so your greedy self could try everything on the menu.

4.0,1/11/2013,"Being the only Michelin starred Korean restaurant that I've ever patronized, I can see the hype behind Danji.  But let me digress for a moment:I've had the privilege of flying to the motherland in Business and First class on Asiana and Korean Airlines.  Admidst the glitz and glamor of 180 degree lie flat seats, fine Taittinger champagne and air hostesses in the top 2 percent of attractiveness, I always got a laugh out of the fact that they would serve bibimbap in the front of the plane.Authors note:  For the uninitiated, bibimbap is one of the most famous foods in Korea behind the ubiquitous national dish of kimchi.  Essentially, it's rice and root vegetables with a tiny bit of meat with sesame oil and chili paste for flavor: a food solidly ensconced in Korea's rise from a third world country only 50 years ago.Strangely enough, most native Koreans would rather eat mediocre or even shockingly bad Korean food than any sort of Western offering, so I always thought that this dish was reserved for the ultranationalist Koreans who happened to be flying in premium cabins.  To my surprise, it'd always be the round eyed white devils that would invariably order bibimbap.  A trend further supported by pictoral manuals literally showing the ""proper"" steps in mixing various ingredients in the dish.After talking it over with one of my fellow Korean-American jetsetters, it's pretty clear why Americans order bibimbap in first class.  Chances are, unless they're natives of LA or NYC, their exposure to Korean cuisine is necessarily small... and even then, their experiences are probably limited to all you can eat Korean BBQ, a sad byproduct of American gluttony and Korean mercenary business practices.So to fly first class in a Korean airliner and eat native food is probably a once a year (or lifetime) opportunity for these American friends.  They have no concept of the fact that they're eating the hermit kingdom's culinary equivalent of a club sandwich.  That's not to take away from the food, as the bibimbap was quite good the few times I ordered it out of sheer curiosity.Getting back on track, Danji is like the terrestrial version of airline bibimbap.  I think it's definitely gotten the attention of food critics and non-Korean diners because the chef has packaged Korean food - inherently earthy and served in abundant portions - into a fine dining tapas sort of experience.  For a party of five, the bill came out to $400, although to put it out there, none of us are big eaters and we spent two hours having cocktails next door waiting for our seats.The thing about Danji is, the food is really good.  Unfortunately, it's impossible not to be reminded of how much of a premium we have to pay for the fancy surroundings and the artful presentation.  Granted, I'm drawing off of Korean restaurants in LA (inarguably, the best representation of Korean food outside of the motherland) but still the comparison is inevitable.  To wit:- Danji Braised Short Ribs ($14.00) vs Seongbukdong Galbi Jjim ($20.95):  Seonbukdong routinely goes down in LA's Korean American pantheon as the best braised short ribs in town.  Surprisingly, Danji's offering was very competitive as it was juicy, tasty and well seasoned.  The only issue: It's one fucking rib bone, mang!  The five of us were kind of milling around trying to figure out how to divide it up while Chris Rock's character in I'm Gonna Git You Sucka was floating around in my head.  youtube.com/watch?v=KNQR…- Danji's Poached Sablefish ($18.00) vs Gangnam Garden's Eun-Dae-Gu Jorim ($22.95):  The respective dishes marry a spicy/savory soy sauce base with artfully poached fish, green onions and daikon radish.  I'd argue that Danji's version is slightly better, but being a value-oriented guy, it's hard not to notice that their 8 oz portion is dwarfed by Gangnam Garden's version that's at least quintuple the portion size.- Danji's bossam ($20) vs Kobawoo House's Large Sized Bo-ssam ($24.99):  Continuing the trend of this review, you gotta get at least 30-40 pieces of pork belly while Danji gives you five.  What is worth mentioning however, was the Latino food runner at Danji who delivered this dish with aplobmb and began illustrating the proper technique for consumption in Spanish inflected English.  To his credit, after about 3 seconds, he noted the ethnic makeup of our group and remarked, ""You guys already know this shit don't you?""  Ahuevo, companero...  somos Coreanos.  *vatos locos hand signs*And after all that long-winded fluff on price-value ratios, premium airline cabins and general nonsense that your humble author seems to favor so much, I can clearly say this:  Danji does a great job packaging Korean food into palatable small plates that appeals to a wide range of audiences including Korean, Western and everything in between.",8,10,5,John S.,"Buena Park, CA",1399,543,43

You have to break the soft boiled egg to let the yolk mix with the kimchi, chili oil, bacon and minced pork. The yolk combines with the noodles to create this flavor and silkiness that can only be described as Korean ambrosia.

But while the food was good and all, it wasn't good enough to justify the price and the portions. I think as a Korean, I could never ever ever pay money for kimchi at a restaurant because side dishes are ALWAYS free- nevertheless $6 or so for 3 bites of it. I just can't.Anyway, we got the garlic wings, both pork and beef sliders, and the tofu. I also had the soju sangria to drink. Again, everything was good. The tofu, I particularly enjoyed and the sliders melted in your both, but the garlic wings I could have gotten at BonChon. Aside from the food, the space is beautiful. I love the lighting and the bar is beautiful. It's small and they don't take reservations.

She came up to our table and asked us if we were done with a dish that was sitting on the table. When we said we were still picking at it, she said, ""Well, you've been here for more than two hours, and we have people waiting for tables."" We, in fact, had only been at that table for an hour and 15 minutes.I live in the neighborhood so I know how packed a lot of the smaller restaurants can get, but I have NEVER been pushed out so directly as we did last night.There's better food with better service all around Hell's Kitchen.

First of all, the service was perfect.  We were seated immediately and chose to sit at the bar.  The bartender gave us our menus and took our drink orders and after finishing our drinks, explained the menu to us since it was our first visit.  I ordered a drink called Korean Pear which was a simple mixture of vodka, pear juice, and cinnamon.  It was tasty and beautiful with a very thinly sliced pear added to the inside of the glass.   We ordered five different food options since everything is small plates and our favorites were the Bulgogi and Spicy Pork Belly Sliders, the mushroom 'risotto', and the Kimchi Chorizo 'Pealla' for two with fried egg.  We were delighted by the whole experience at Danji -a great little oasis near the busy theater district.  It did seem a bit pricey but we are always willing to pay a little more for delicious food we wouldn't typically have at home and for really great service.  We will definitely be going back!",0,0,0,Jason Y.,"Beacon, NY",22,149,23

3.0,11/13/2012,"Small, trendy Korean restaurant down the block from the enormously popular Totto Ramen.  Danji is the kind of small restaurant you find on the ground floor of a brownstone (except in this case I think it's a commercial building).  That means it's a long space with the bar near the front door and a line of tables toward the back.  We showed up a few minutes before their noon opening time and were the first ones.  The place was pretty filled up by the time we left half an hour later.They have a small lunch menu with most dishes in the $8-$15 range.  Some of the cheaper dishes are tapas style so you are supposed to order a few for the table.  The food is what they call Korean fusion, which means traditional Korean dishes prepared with fresh ingredients, presented in a visually pleasing way and in smaller portions.  Very different from K-Town's spicy comfort food in noisy and smoky dining rooms.  The food was pretty tasty and nice for a change of pace, but not worth the extra cost to me.",1,0,0,Dave L.,"New York, NY",32,361,10

For a restaurant with really high reviews and 1 michellin star, i expected much better service. Our hostess said the wait was only 45 minutes and then we ended up waiting 2 hours. I believe the customers ahead of us waited 3 hours.

3.0,10/31/2012,"Let me first say that I thought the service was terrific, given the circumstances. We came in with a huge group, and added one more than was expected. They couldn't accommodate everyone at the same two middle tables (the ones with the stools), so a couple of us sat at the bar. No big deal, but I think we could have squeezed in. Whatever, honestly not a big deal. The service was generally impeccable. Our hostess, who handled the reservations for our large party was very nice and attentive. And the waiter, a younger, perhaps late 20-something guy, was fantastic. Given our large group, we all moved around a lot to sit with the others. This guy always remembered my soju carafe when I forgot it. Very key.But the food, in all honesty, wasn't what I was expecting, considering this place has a Michelin star. The ginger tofu with scallions was a high point, granted, but even then, it wasn't so much better than any other tofu dish I've had at a number of Japanese restaurants. The rest just wasn't all that great, considering the price. Now, take my suggestion with a grain of salt; I'm vegetarian, so I didn't get some of the dishes we ordered. But the daikon was a bit plain, and the paella with egg was a bit boring. And the egg was overcooked. The kimchi was OK, but that's not really a meal.In any case, the bill can add up quick at this place. That's not always a bad thing, but in this situation, it was slightly disappointing. Maybe it was the huge group. I'll have to reconsider this place. Usually service suffers with big groups, but not in this case.",1,0,0,Shamik T.,"Washington, DC",22,157,0

1.0,10/3/2012,"Honestly I was shocked at how good the reviews on this restaurant were. This is the first time I have ever felt the need to write a Yelp review simply because this service experience was so terrible. From the minute we got there we were rushed through our meal by a rude and aggressive server. When we needed more time to go over the menu he came back no more than 30 seconds later. When we mentioned that we might be adding more items along the way he told us they only take all items at once (so as not to prolong the meal, of course). Right away he told us we would need 5-6 items at least, which is just not true and an obvious attempt to get us to spend as much money as possible. Still though, not a deal breaker...I like my food on the spicy side, and a few menu items implied they had plenty of spice in the kitchen (spicy wings, spicy sliders, wasabi aoli with the calamari, etc.) When I asked for something spicy on the side to accompany our honey ginger wings, they literally refused to bring anything. I asked three different servers before being told that they could not provide a sauce from another dish for something that didn't have it on the menu. I was dumbfounded by this! Not that I needed anything over the top but some wasabi? A little siracha? Whatever chili they put in the sliders?? Nothing. The real kicker came at the end. Our entire meal took no more than 45 minutes, and my friend and I came to catch up, not feel rushed out of a mediocre meal. We thanked them and said we were going to chat for a few minutes before leaving, only to be told that others were waiting and we'd have to leave. Are you kidding me?! This was a Tuesday evening, there were open tables, and two people waiting. Never in my life have I been asked to leave a restaurant in under and hour, much less after a mediocre meal that was not inexpensive.

5.0,8/23/2012,"The food was some of the best I've ever had and it is clear why Danji is the only Korean restaurant to be awarded a Michelin star. Chef Hooni Kim's rising star is growing brighter every day. His second restaurant Hanjan is highly-anticipated and slated to open soon. As for Danji, despite being busy (and packed) on a Tuesday night, the restaurant was warm, inviting and we received lots of attention. But the food truly spoke for itself.Tofu with Ginger Scallion Dressing: The soft, pillow-like tofu was encased in a crisp panko crust. The creaminess of the tofu was perfectly balanced by the light acidity of the ginger scallion dressing. It jump started our appetite and immediately finishing the dish, we wanted more.Spicy Yellowtail Sashimi: Hands down the best sashimi I have ever had. I had never liked yellowtail UNTIL I tried this particular dish. Refreshing and clean Hamachi, paired with a sweet & spicy chojang with just a hint of heat with a thinly-sliced jalapeno topping. Amazing.Bossam: The perfectly cooked pork invites you in with a sweet & sticky exterior only to reveal a moist, succulent and savory pork beneath the first bite. Wrapped in the accompanying cabbage (cut into perfect rectangle slices) combined with the spicy, crisp radishes, this dish made me realize that it is this kind of sophisticated treatment of food that has catapulted Danji into the Michelin echelon.Poached Sablefish with Spicy Daikon: A traditional Korean dish elevated into a modern work of art. Yet another example of culinary sophistication. The sablefish was moist, with a desirable hint of fattiness. It was perfectly delicate, yet succulent and substantial. The spicy daikon sauce the fish was enveloped in was understated yet bold. A dish I could eat every night. Kimchi Bacon Chorizo ""Paella"" w Fried Jidori Hen Egg: The yolk of the Jidori Hen Egg that tops this dish provides a milky, creaminess that perfectly balances the salty bite of the bacon and chorizo. As time goes on, the dish is elevated into another experience altogether. The runny yolk scrambles, and the bottom portion of rice crisps on the sizzling cast iron, providing an unexpected crunch that tantalizes the palate further.

3.0,8/12/2012,"I am a huge fan of tapas, but this place just didn't hit the spot for me. 1) I believe tapas should be packed with flavor: whether a delicate mix of textures and tastes or a fiesta in your mouth, tapas should be good. Really good... 2) This one may be just because I am Asian, but when I know there are certain cheap products being used to make a dish (ie: tofu) and the dish does not blow me away, I get pretty annoyed.I liked the ambiance; this is a great date spot. The decor is modern, lots of white and a bit quirky, which I like. Decent wine selection: nothing crazy. Service was OK: some individuals were more attentive than others and there were at least 2 instances where I needed something and everyone sort of just... Rushed past to stand in the back and chit chat...In terms of food, I had the short rib, tofu, bulgogi burgers, wings (not spicey ones), and pancakes. The waitress really played up the tofu, but... It just wasn't very good. I felt like it was a play on a similar Japanese dish of fried tofu... The ""play"" being the fact that it wasn't as fried as the Japanese version... The bulgogi burgers were quite good and right on par with other tapas dishes I've had (2 bite max for my tiny mouth). The meat was not overcooked and I liked the sauce on top. There was a single pickle thing in each, which refreshing to get a bit of every few bites. The wings were not as good as bon chon wings... The pancakes, again, over priced and just not that great. I will highly suggest the short rib dish: the meat just melted in your mouth...Overall, a decent place. I think I paid too much for what I got in terms of food (I'm always willing to pay a little more for ambiance, as long as the food is on par).

Yes, I think so.You might say that I would rather go to Korea Town where you can have korean food for $20ish than paying $$$ in Danji. Yes you might, but you won't be able to enjoy the same food quality/atmosphere of Danji in Korea Town.   Here are some reasons why Danji deserves $$$: 1) The food is near perfect, very authentic Korean dishes, probably more than other Korean restaurants in Korea Town. When I first heard that Danji is a modern Michelin-star restaurant, I specualted that it must have somewhat Korean-western fusion dishes, but it's not at all! - Poached sablefish with spicy daikon: my favorite dish in Danji. This dish is really authentic Korean. I was really surprised after my first bite because it tasted exactly the same with the one that my grandmother cooked for me when I was a child!!! The pieces of sablefish are boneless, very soft and tender, and the sauce (korean-style daikon) makes the fish more yammy!  - Garlic honey wings with sesame seeds: strongly recommend, actually much better than spicy KFC(korean fire chicken wings). The wings are perfect crispy, not overly sweety. Great dish to have with cold beer!  -  Tofu with kimchi & grilled pork belly: this is also very authentic. Tofu with aged kimchi & pork belly is all-time favorite menu to be served with alcohol beverages to Korean people. Worth try.  - Kimchi bacon chorizo 'paella' with fried egg: It was interesting that this dish was named as 'paella.' Other korean restaurants must name it just like 'Fried rice with kimch'. This one is again very authentic. It is all-time favorite menu for kids' school lunch box haha. So good. The way the food is served also differentiates Danji from other Korean restaurants. As mentioned, it's tapas style, very neat and nicely presented. Danji does not serve side dishes as its competitors do. You can order a rice for $2 and three types of Kimchi for $6 at Danji. 2) In addition to food, Danji has great drink menu: wine, sake, soju, beer, etc. If you are sick of traditional Soju (Korean hard liquor), try Soju Sangria here. It tastes very fresh and light. My friend really loved spicy Ginger Margarita. OB Larger, Korean beer, is also great. 3) Cozy, neat, and calm atmosphere. Good to have dinner&drink with your co-workers/old friends and enjoy chatting for a long time. Restaurants in Korea Town are very spacious but usually too crowded and crazy noisy. Danji is different. It is more like a small bar in a luxurious hotel haha. Worth visit. Will bring my american friends who want to try very authentic korean food!",5,1,0,Somin Y.,"Manhattan, NY",127,207,65

3.0,7/20/2012,"I eat a lot of Korean food and while I wouldn't consider myself an expert, I certainly feel like I know what I'm talking about. The food here was very good though it was billed as a fusion of Korean food and I found it to be Korean food with slight modifications. The korean wings ... I could get these at Bon Chun, the Bulgogi Sliders are clever and tasty but certainly not anything new. The Kalbi Ggim (Short Rib in a little broth) was delicious but $14 for one piece??? I've had just as good at Do Hwa and get a lot more for my money.The place is a little cramped and both the host and bartender were not attentive enough ... It's very important to a restaurant that is small to keep those that are waiting extensively happy, so an attentive bartender can make all the difference. I made eye contact with the bartender several times while standing at the bar and he all but completely ignored me to the point that I refused to purchase any alcoholic beverages there or at my meal, just out of principle. My date and I ordered 6 items off the menu (it's ""Tapas"" styled) and we were definitely full by the end of the meal ... the check came to $90 without drinks (see earlier comment). So not awfully priced though I still feel that certain items were a little over what they should be given the size of the space and it's location.So my final word is this: Solid menu, service needs to get better, value for $ is a little weak but I would go back again if I was close by ... I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there as there are plenty of good korean places around the city.",3,0,0,Adam G.,"Manhattan, NY",1,2,0

4.0,7/15/2012,"I was interested in eating at Danji because it was the first Korean restaurant to ever get a Michelin Star rating so I was curious to see what the hype was all about. I heard that the wait can get long and they don't do reservations unless it's a group of 6 or more, so we decided to come here when they opened for lunch.The restaurant was very cool (important on a hot summer day) and clean. The bathroom was cutely decorated with Korean masks. And our waitress was very friendly and nice. As for the food, we ordered the Kimchi Trio, dumplings, bulgogi beef sliders and bibimbap. The portions weren't huge but it was enough to fill me up (I'm a light eater though so if you eat a lot, you could find yourself with a huge bill!) I didn't actually try the bibimbap so I can't say how it tasted by my friend said it was good. As for the kimchi trio, it came with traditional kimchi, kkakdugi (kimchi made of radish), and cucumber kimchi- all three of which I thought were delicious! The dumplings (mandoo) were good as well but I thought that they were a bit over fried because they were very crispy. I'm not sure if that was intentional. Evenso, they were pretty big dumplings and were very tasty. (the appetizer comes with 5 dumplings).The bulgogi beef sliders were delicious! It's not the cheapest considering you only get 2 small White Castle sized burgers but it was enough to fill me up (like I said, I'm a light eater).  The bulgogi was sweet and the bread was super soft. Definitely enjoyable!I would say that it was worth the visit. The food was good and satisfying, the place was clean, the employees were nice.

5.0,7/11/2012,"I suppose if I had thousands of restaurants to eat at as a regular occurrence, I could afford to be more picky and ding this place for minor stuff as some Yelpers seem prone to do. But I don't. I live in Connecticut where food like this doesn't exist.  And because of that, I will be dreaming of coming back here time and again.What did I love? The atmosphere for one. Cozy with the menus tucked in under the tables so you could take a peek at any time.  (How convenient).Service was mostly grand. Lots of water refills. New plates for each little tapas. Only minor complaint is the ktichen took a little while to get the first dish out (and won't get out more than one dish at a time but they will do overlapping dishses if you nudge them a bit.)  And the drinks! An unfiltered rice beer was a perfect complement to the spicy food; a little sweet and went down smooth. But where else can you also get a Spicy Ginger Margarita. Between the square ice cubes to the shaves of jalapenos (with a little kick!), it was the most unusual drink I've had all year. But it worked really well.And the food? Well, we came here pre-theather, and ordered 5 dishes for two people. All were divine and just the right amount. The calamari had great flavor and good texture. The scallion pancake was light -- almost like a tempura -- and went well with a chili dipping sauce.But the ""KFC"" Spicy Wings were, well, spicy but had a great coating. Could've benefited from a dip to cool it off a bit for my dining partner, but I loved it.  Highlight of the evening was the Spicy Pork Belly Sliders -- oh my! So velvety and smooth. Perfect after the spiciness of the wings.We finished with a chorizo and kimchi ""paella"" with a quail egg on top. A great way to finish the meal and clean the palates too.  Loved breaking up the egg yolk to add to the dish.  And they got us out in plenty of time to see a show.  So, if you're a NYC food snob - go be picky. For the rest of us, a Korean Tapas place is a great discovery.  Fun and delicious.

3.0,7/9/2012,"This place had been on my list for a long time and came highly reviewed by the NYT and food blogs, so when my friend suggested we go there for dinner, I was like, ""Hell Yes!"" The place is small, but the wait was only 15-20 minutes for 2 on a Wednesday at 6:30PM.The concept is small Korean dishes, with one list for the more traditional dishes and another for modern variations of classics. My (Korean) friend and I ordered 5 dishes to spilt between the two of us and most of our opinons about the food were the same.Tofu w. ginger scallion dressing ($8): I loved the silky texture of the tofu with the light battered, crispy outside. An great simple execution that really highlights the tofu. 5/5Spicy pork belly sliders ($12): Comes with 2 sliders. Honestly, as I was eating this, I was thinking, ""This just tastes like something I would get from the Kogi truck in LA."" Though the flavors were good, I wasn't wowed and felt like I could get this type of food at a decent Korean food truck. And the oil soaked through the bottom of the bun, making it a little messy to eat with your hands. 3/5Grilled pork belly & aged kimchi ($14): An execution of doobu kimchi that was good but not memorable. The pork belly was well cooked and the kimchi was tasty. 4/5Braised short ribs($14): Kalbi Jim. Again, great execution but it didn't wow me with the flavors. The kalbi was cooked perfectly though and the meat itself was very tender. 3.5./5 Kimchi bacon chorizo 'paella' w. fried jidori hen egg ($14+$2): More like Dol Sot Bibimbap served on a paella pan, the rice was not crispy and the sesame oil and gochujang flavor overwhelms the rest of the flavors. 3/5Overall, a great concept and the food is well executed, but I wasn't impressed to justify the price I was paying. 3.5/5",2,0,0,Anthony P.,"Manhattan, NY",223,111,7
4.0,7/9/2012,"The vibe here on a Friday night is energetic and bustling with people waiting for tables and people having a great time. The place is decoratively fun- love the screen of hanging spoons they have between tables! The menu is well organised, one list for the more traditional Korean dishes and another for modern variations. The portions aren't much, I agree, especially when you consider how much you're paying for them. I suppose that's most of what Hell's Kitchen's like from what I've seen so far. I ordered the spicy whelk salad with buckwheat noodles, scallion & Korean pepper pancake, and one of their cocktails, the Spicy Ginger Margarita (tequila, ginger, lime, jalapeno, orange). I found the spicy whelk salad and buckwheat noodles to be overpowered by the spicy paste. The flavour of the paste wasn't anything interesting, just too salty and overbearing for the noodles and salad. The scallion and Korean pepper pancake was tasty and had a nice crisp to it, definitely a classic to order in any Korean restaurant- and Danji doesn't disappoint! The Korean pepper was cooked well and was still juicy when you bit into the pancake. The ginger in the margarita was not overbearing and it was overall a refreshing cocktail that still packed a punch with both the tequila and the ginger, with the sweet aftertaste of the orange.

4.0,7/8/2012,"Went there for lunch on 7-2-12.  Judging from the other reviews, we totally lucked out by showing up at lunchtime.  It was shortly before the kitchen closed so we felt a little rushed.  Nevertheless, the server was very nice. The bad, the restaurant is very small with a tiny bar.  It it was packed there would be no place to wait but out on the street. So, be forewarned.  Also, putting the menus in a drawer in the table is gimmicky and I find that kind of thing annoying.  Lastly, there's no tea served here nor dessert items.  Do other Korean-ish restaurants serve tea? I have no idea, but I wanted tea. The good, the kimchi trio is to die for.  The presentation was lovely and the pickling was perfect and it had just the right amount of kick.  I will dream about that kimchi forever.  The bulgogi sliders were delicious and the sweet and savory combination of the flavors on that tiny burger were a delight.  Last but not least I had the bibimbap with the world's most perfect egg on top.  The food was damn near perfect.Eat here.  The Michelin star is well deserved.",2,0,1,Felisa R.,"Houston, TX",4,38,4

3.0,6/26/2012,"""What kind of food is it?""""It's small plates.""""Small plates?""""It's kind of like tapas.""""Ooh, I like tapas.""""And it's Korean.""""How interesting! Let's go!""This is the conceit behind Danji and once you've seen through it the mystique fades away fairly quickly. It feels like the proliferation of small plates restaurants is one of the more recent trends in the city and Danji is doing its best to ride that out.As befitting a trendy Michelin-starred Asian restaurant, the decor is in keeping with the less-is-more ethos, which I appreciate, except for a couple oddities, such as the seating area toward the front that has high chairs and tables, in contrast to the seating area toward the back that is furnished at a more regular height, and the numerous racks of spoons [why Lisa, why??!!!]. The menu is divided up into traditional and modern sections, although with garlic honey wings in the traditional category and bossam on the modern side, the distinction seems arbitrary at times. My friend and I were hungry as usual, so we ended up ordering five dishes.The tofu, with a ginger scallion dressing, was the first plate out and easily the best one of the night. I'm not tofu-phobic, but this dish really caught me by surprise. Hunks of tofu that were barely crispy on the outside and silky, almost creamy, smooth on the inside, topped with tempura batter shavings, scallions and thin slices of red chilis really popped in my mouth with the different textures - tofu: smooth, tempura: crispy - and flavors - tofu: cool, pepper: hot - for a real winner. The spicy whelk salad with buckwheat noodles was literally bipolar - it was served as two entirely separate salads on the same plate. The buckwheat noodle salad was quite smooth and good, but something was awry with the whelk salad; it tasted a little too earthy and the whelks were rubbery and overcooked.The kimchi trio that was then served contained regular kimchi (cabbage), daikon and cucumber. These were fine - I'm most partial to the cucumber - but nothing special.Moving onto more substantial plates, the bossam came out next, awaiting construction by our hands. Taken individually, each piece of the bossam - braised pork, daikon kimchi paste, cabbage wrap - was very good, yet when they came together the whole was less than the sum of its parts. Rather than play off of and accentuate each other like well-practiced musicians, every ingredient in the bossam wrap became duller when consumed simultaneously, like performances at the Super Bowl halftime show. Our final dish to arrive was the kimchi bacon chorizo paella, topped with a fried egg. By paella, which is in quotes on the menu, they mean a more Korean-style rice bowl. The egg, which wasn't completely cooked through upon serving, did well when mixed into the rice to give the dish more body, but the dish was too salty and, more importantly, the rice along the bottom of the plate wasn't crispy, which is a necessary component in any good rice bowl or paella.Outside of the whelk salad I didn't try anything that I disliked, but outside of the tofu I didn't try anything that I strongly liked, so three stars seems right. Prices aren't cheap, but not entirely out of range for a small plates restaurant, except for the kimchi, which was ridiculous - akin to charging $6 for a few rolls of bread at an American restaurant.Small plates make sense for some cuisines, like tapas, owing to the context of how the dishes are prepared and consumed. However, for many restaurants this meaning gets lost in translation and instead they serve either lots of appetizers or slimmed down entrée portions. Ironically, Korean cuisine is not a bad fit for small plates, as any table at most Korean restaurants usually ends up dotted, and many times, overflowing, with banchan of all odds and ends. Unfortunately, instead of adapting the existing cuisine to fit this trend by thoughtfully elaborating on these dishes, Danji takes the cookie-cutter approach to the small plates craze and falls short of what it could accomplish. The result isn't entirely banal, but it's hardly overwhelming.",5,4,5,Mike K.,"Seattle, WA",89,147,91

4.0,6/4/2012,"I was impressed with the concept of Korean food tapas style. The restaurant is a bit cramped, and be prepared to sit communal style with strangers. However, the lovely grungy decor more than compensates for the lack of space. And they store their utensils and menus in the drawers under the tables, how cute! Loved the sashimi,  scallion pancake and the skate fish dish. My boyfriend loved the beef sliders and would come back just to have multiple of those. The service was prompt and our server made excellent recommendations.

The restaurant itself is small, and the seating area can get a little cramped if you have a party of more than four or six. However, my experience here was excellent.First off, kudos to my server Micah. As an employee in the restaurant industry myself, I always appreciate great service. He was very attentive, made excellent recommendations, and was very high energy. The food was prompt and plates were staggered excellently (as it should be at a quality tapas restaurant). Great service!The food was out of this world. The yellowtail sashimi was one of the tastiest dishes I have ever had, and if you visit Danji without trying it, you should be absolutely ashamed of yourself. We tried both types of sliders (pork belly and beef) and they were both very good. The chorizo paella is a must have as well. Also, try the beef tartare and calamari were phenomenal.  Overall, I could not have been happier with the quality of the food.The wine selection was mediocre; however there were a couple of gems on it.  We had a couple of bottles of nebbiolo, and they were excellent.

3.0,5/19/2012,"I wish I could separate the food and service rating. I would without a doubt give its food and drinks at least 4 stars, maybe 4.5 stars, and 1 star for service. After waiting an hour for a table for two people on a Friday night around 7:45PM, my friend and I finally got two seats at the communal table. Space was cramped but I really didn't mind the coziness especially after our delicious margaritas with jalapeno arrived. An hour into our dinner after ordering two rounds of drinks and 5 plates of food (too much for two girls), the waitress sweetly advised with the most annoyingly fake smile and asked us to speed up our meal. I think her exact words were ""Excuse me, because your food have been on the table for a while (20 minutes?), I must rush you to finish so we can turn the table over"".... this is with half of a paella still left, fish with radish on the table and two drinks that are not even half empty. Seconds after the waitress left, the couple next to us told us the same waitress told them they needed to finish in a hour before their first plate of food even arrived. My inner bitch came out after thinking about how rude the waitress was after we've waited an hour for a table, spent $170+ for two people, so we decided that we were going to take our sweet time and see if she comes over again. Sure enough, she came in less than 10 minutes to ""check up"" on us again to see if we were done. I returned the same fake Asian sweet smile and politely told her that ""we are still working on it"". After being asked by the waitress twice to swallow the food quicker, and almost getting our food taken away multiple times by the busboy, I don't think I would've been surprised if she just took our food and kicked us out. I think the waitress finally realized that we weren't going to leave, she then came over and said the reason she's been asking is because the chef is very particular about the temperature of the food after it's served and want them to be eaten at the right temperature and apologized for rushing us. uhm... who smells bs? Service aside, food and drinks were delicious and definitely creative and well presented. Being Asian myself, I mostly tried the modern side of the menu instead of the traditional Korean plates.

5.0,5/14/2012,"I'm so very glad I picked up on this gem of a restaurant in my New York trip food research process. On a Friday night, the wait wasn't so bad. For my party of one, it took about 10-15 minutes, but even the parties of 2 or 3 seemed to get seated within a half hour. Compared to the massive congregation waiting outside Totto Ramen, this seemed a luxury. The interior itself is beautiful. With a light blond color scheme, long communal tables (not all), bulbs enclosed in mason jars, the restaurant feels warm, inviting, and sophisticated all at once. The menus at the high communal tables are cleverly tucked away in slim drawers at each seat.  Service was very relaxed. They ended up bringing out my dishes one by one, with a generous amount of time between each. Parties seemed to stay for awhile, many people ordering additional dishes as they ate. The menu, which has both ""traditional"" and ""modern"" offerings, is mouth-watering. I am so annoyed with myself for not liking kimchee (as it falls into the pickled category, one I generally dislike), as I desperately wanted to order the kimchee/chorizo paella that looked delectable. But I had plenty of other good options. I ended up ordering three dishes to eat myself. My waitress assured me that this was not an obscene amount of food to order for one, and she was right (though I was fairly full by the end). -- TOFU WITH GINGER SCALLION DRESSING AND SOY VINAIGRETTE: This resembles a traditional agedashi tofu . I've found that I don't really like the thick gelatinous coating of non-Americanized agedashi tofu, so I was a little hesitant. Those fears turned out to be unfounded. Indeed, these rectangular chunks of tofu do have a jelly-ish coating, but it's so thin and adds to the multitude of textures in this dish, from the soft tofu to the very crunchy panko.  -- POACHED SABLEFISH W SPICY DAIKON: I've never had the famous Nobu miso black cod or any variation of it, but I assume it's sort of similar to this. The fish is perfectly cooked, flaking apart easily at the poke of a chopstick and melting in your mouth. Rice is a necessary foil to the rich, delicious, but slightly too salty sauce. The dish comes with two generous pieces of fish. --BULGOGI SLIDERS: Ohmygod I could eat these forever. Each slider is not very large, actually, so don't even think about splitting a plate with someone. To start with, the bun is super buttery (enough to make my fingers a lil greasy) and slightly toasted. The bulgogi was very tender with the right amount of sweetness (ie not too much) and there was some sort of delicious spicy mayo-ish thing situation going on. I seriously wanted to order more, but it seemed quite excessive to do so.",3,0,2,Ada T.,"Pittsburgh, PA",93,287,190

1.0,4/30/2012,"Was visiting Manhattan on an overnight business trip - dropped by the bar and had a quick dinner since this place was close to my hotel. The owner of the restaurant was sitting across the bar from me, trying out all the drinks at the bar and critiquing the drinks that the bartender was preparing, giving tips to the bartender on how to mix them.I ordered the Soju Sangria. Right after I ordered, the owner started sampling the same drink. He started blasting it saying it was flat and lacked flavor, and the Tropicana that was poured into the cocktail was open for too long.I tried a sip, and completely agreed - it was one of the worst Sangrias I tried - lukewarm, flat, bland. Amazingly the bartender kept mixing up the same sangria using the same stale ingredients and serving them to customers, and the owner didn't say anything despite having just criticized the drink. I guess they have high standards here.I ended up ordering 3 dishes. 1) Sashimi - fish was not very fresh, and it was drenched in overly sweet gochujang (hot sauce) to mask the smell. 2) Tofu - drenched in soy sauce, too salty 3) Galbijim (braised short ribs) - not bad, just average.Bill ended up being $55 - which I would not mind if the dishes were good. It was very average (bordering on subpar) Korean food.

I've been putting off trying Danji for so long because I brushed it off to be just another busy Korean restaurant that mistakenly set up shop in Midtown West instead of KTown. In the end this was probably good timing as Danji had received it's Michelin star just this past October and currently seems to be the only Korean restaurant wearing these laurels in New York. You get warm vibes the minute you walk in. You know that feeling, where the atmosphere is bustling but hushed - no clinking of plates and glasses, no roaring laughter or obnoxious groups. The entire place glows a dim hue of burnt orange, with smooth cedar slab counters and white-washed brick walls, lit by suspended cages of light bulbs, filaments exposed. It's really beautiful. Somewhere you could linger for hours.We came here around 9:30 on a Wednesday and were welcomed by a very sweet and down-to-earth hostess. Coveted seats by the bar were occupied by tenants who were unfazed by our attempts to stare them down so we grabbed two stools at a hightop counter.

But we were happy to have stayed.We ordered off both the traditional and modern menus, and I think the modern dishes are a much better bet for a place like this. If you want traditional, you should go to a traditional Korean restaurant, where you can get most of the dishes as part of your free appetizers course. For example, Danji offers a ""trio of kimchi,"" which is just straight-up cabbage kimchi, cucumber kimchi, and turnip kimchi. All these are provided on the house at any traditional Korean restaurant in Koreatown. However, if you're not familiar with Korean food, a restaurant like this is a great introduction to the traditional dishes, in an accessible setting. I am married to a Korean guy, so I am more picky about my Korean food, but the friends I dined with were not as familiar with the cuisine and seemed to enjoy the traditional dishes just as much as the modern ones.The modern dishes were inventive and delicious.

The fried calamari was done right, light and virtually grease less it was served with baby celery leaves something I've never had before and it was excellent.On to an Asian soba and salad plate and finally a sable fish poached perfectly in a spicy red bean sauce. It sounds like a lot of food,but, the tapas sized portions were just right. Our server,Carrie, was terrific In helping to steer us to some great selections and she served her tables with an attitude that she really cares about your meal and the restaurant.  This place is far from traditional Korean food; a fusion of 21st century hip tastes, and like Hyundai cars and Samsung Galaxies have definitely arrived.

So delightful. We were both trying to be polite over this dish, but then just split the remaining. Mmm.Bugogi beef sliders were pretty spectacular, though I tend to love bulgogi. The bread is brushed with butter and there is a tiny pickled thing on top. So cute. Only comes with 2.The Spicy Ginger chicken drumettes are served kind of wet. I think I was expecting them to be fried, but they were served in a light stew with carrots and potatoes. In fairness to the restaurant, it was listed under the traditional menu, so I guess the sign was there. The modern menu has the fried chicken.Danji braised short rib: HOLY COW. If you like short ribs, this is the creme de la creme. I should have ordered two of these. So freaking good. I didn't want to share it. It fell apart on the bone and was so incredibly tender. We were still a little hungry, so we ordered more food.The stir fried vermicelli w. beef and veg didn't really seem to have vegetables. The beef parts were small, and the noodles were well prepared. Overall, this tasted great, but didn't seem to be what they were calling it. Perhaps the components were too small to see?Spicy Pork Belly sliders were good, but the bulgogi beef sliders were better. They looked really similar, so it was hard not to compare. I generally prefer pork, but the bulgogi-beef was really interesting and well done. Things we didn't order that I wish we did based on the people next to us who did order them: Tofu, calamari, 3 types of kimchi.They don't serve dessert. WHAT?Great service.

We tried the tofu w. ginger scallion dressing, bossam, bulgogi beef sliders, stir fried vermicelli w. beef & veg, and spicy yellowtail sashimi. The tofu and the bossam stood out above all. I'm still dreaming of pork belly...They also serve three different types of soju: '50' soju, Chum Churum, and Bekseju. The '50' soju is a blend between the Chum Churum, and Bekseju, which was the perfect balence between the herbal and classical soju.

He reluctantly answered questions about the menu, grudgingly brought some chili paste to the table, and made it clear that wrapping leftovers for takeout was far beneath him. Why were there leftovers? Simply because the food had no flavor - the antithesis of what Korean food should be. Where was the spice? The mouth-filling savoriness? The balance of sweet and tart? The generous bounty? Unfortunately, they were 1.5 miles away in Koreatown.

I guess that's one perk of going to a restaurant like this during an odd hour. Once we stepped in, the first thing the waiter said to us was there's normally a lot more people here. Needless to say I was a little worried after walking in.The setting is modern but cozy also. They have long communal tables, a bar and a few other tables in the back. They keep the menus in a drawer at the table because let's be real, with tapas you ALWAYS want more.Our waiter was super nice and we asked for a few suggestions and ended up getting .. the trio of kimchi which was good, but nothing spectacular, the spicy korean wings and yup they sure were spicy! Definitely worth my mouth being on fire for a good 10 minutes though because the wings were extra crispy and juicy. Then came the the pork belly sliders. OH MY if you go here you MUST get these. Everything from the bread they use to the spices and the little salad they put on it, perfection. Last we had the kimichi bacon chorizo paella, also amazing.

But, the hostess said she never forgets a face, so we walked a few blocks away and had sake at Room Service, then came back and were seated promptly. The space is very blond/white wood and modern, but still has a warm feel and nice, flattering lighting. As the NY Times review pointed out, it's not the most comfortable restaurant-- you sit atop stools at long, high tables-- but the quality of the food more than makes up for it. We ordered along the lines of what other Yelp reviewers (and Sam Sifton of the NY Times) recommended, and I can't say I was disappointed in any of them.  We had the mushroom/truffle risotto (great but hard to eat with the spoons they give you), the crispy fried tofu (amazing texture-- crispy outside with a soft, marshmallow-y texture inside) and the bulgogi sliders (tiny bites that pack an unbelievable savory punch.) The soju sangria was the only thing I was not overly thrilled with-- it just tasted like regular sangria, and I was hoping to get a more pronounced flavor of the soju.My main complaint about the place is that it is set up tapas-style, which everyone knows is a red flag that your bill will be astronomical. The bulgogi sliders were $12 for two-- and these were tiny, truly slider-sized. I wanted to try the bo ssam but that was $20 for a ""small plate"" portion! I had just been to Momofuku Noodle Bar for lunch that day, so I had a hard time not comparing the two, and for what it's worth I think Momofuku turns out excellent food of similar quality for a much lower price.

So, my friends and I went late on a Friday night (around 8:40 pm) and we snacked beforehand. We waited about 30-40 minutes so it wasn't too bad.I got the soju sangria while we waited. It was fruity and delicious, and the soju was quite faint but managed to give me a slight buzz. Between three of us we got six dishes and we shared everything, tapas style. The plates were small and prices not low, but the total ended up being less than I expected and the food was quite good.steak tartare - I loved the Asian pear with the steak, that was a lovely combination. When you eat the tartare you taste the individual pieces of steak, but if you eat it with the quail egg yolk, it coats the pieces and changes the texture. The steak was seasoned well, and this was one of my favorite dishes.bossam - pork, scallion, and daikon kimchi in a napa cabbage wrap. This was my favorite of the night. The pork was so flavorful and melts in your mouth. The cabbage wrap balances out the heavy flavor from the sauce. KFC - Korean fried chicken wings. This tasted like a spicy version of sweet and sour chicken to me, and so I wasn't as impressed. It was done well and quite spicy, which sort of dominated my palette for the rest of the night.pork belly sliders - the pork belly in this was not very noticeable to me, though overall it tasted good. I've had better sliders or pork belly dishes for sure though and at lower prices too.stinky miso beef stew - I've eaten a lot of Korean food but I've never had anything that reminds me of this dish. Anyway, it smelled slightly stinky but tasted so good. The miso flavor was there but didn't dominate, and the tofu in the stew were soft and silky and delicious in the soup.paella - I could taste the chorizo and a bit of kimchi, but I couldn't really taste the bacon.

You do get what you pay for.Between 2 people, 5-6 dishes were recommended for sharing.1:  braised pork, scallion, dehydrated daikon kimchi cabbage wrap.  Or, just say  ""bossam.""   Wow, the pork melts in your mouth, the kimchi was decent, but the cabbage was so soft and sweet! Really enjoyed this dish.2. tofu with ginger scallion dressing:  Deep fried but did not feel the ""greasiness"" generally associated with fried food. The tofu was crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.  Flavors of ginger and scallion complimented the tofu. Good dish for the vegetarian in you.3. bulgolgi beef sliders:  It's a good slider but for $12 for 2? 4. spicy KFC chicken. Ok I'm going to think KFC now stands for korean fried chicken and that all of it should be spicy.  Sweet, crunchy, and spicy with a good kick.  I enjoyed this dish! Finger licking good. Yum.5. kimchi bacon chorizo paella:  probably the weakest of the dishes I've tried.  It definitely isn't a paella and it's not really a Korean style stone pot rice either.  It's an in-betweener.  Rice was a little hard and the bacon was hardly noticeable. It was decent but not memorable.The dishes were executed nicely, flavorful, and meats were of good quality. i dig the  ambiance and the soju sangria. However, it's not easy on your wallet which is something to consider when you crave korean food.  But, for special occasions, this place is still a good spot.",2,1,1,Wing L.,"Long Island, NY",201,245,78

One waiter guy (some white guy) kept disappearing or was on his phone texting. Two other girls were running around mad trying to serve the full restaurant. Food was mediocre. Not sure what Michelin people were thinking for this place. The noodle (none spicy) was boring; no flavor and tasted like onion soup.  Slider? That was just gross.

3.0,1/6/2012,"I came to this restaurant on a Monday night at 6:00 and guess what, this place already had a waiting list....and they opened at 5:30!  Not really sure what all the craze was about but I put my face down (they don't take names, the hostess remembers your face :P) and was told to come back in about an hour.  Went next door to Bamboo whatever the heck it's called and had a beer with the girl.  After finishing our beer at Bamboo and being annoyed by the obnoxiously drunk Rutgers football fans at the bar screaming Shots Shots Shots Shots Shots and waaaay too old to be singing that song, we went back to Danji, which was about 45 minutes.  The hostess remembered my face and we were promptly seated in about another 5 minutes.So I didn't know why this place was so popular, but apparently they have a Michelin star, which is displayed prominently on their wall.  This instantly set my expectations higher as the Michelin star restaurants I have been to have all been fantastic.  So they have a very small menu consisting of ""new"" and ""traditional"" korean dishes.  We ordered from both, We ordered the steak tartare, bossam,  pajeon and the paella.  Sounds like a lot of entrees right?  Well, unfortunately this isn't your typical east asian fare where you eat family style.  This is modernist cuisine so come expecting to eat small plates and pay a decent amount for your food.  Either that or leave hungry.Steak tartare was boring, tasty, but boring.  It was really nothing more than sesame oil, egg, sesame seeds, and high quality steak.  Shoot, I could have made that at home.  Where's the kick!  The paejeon was a major disappointment, I was expecting something the size of a large plate filled with all sorts of goodies like anything you'd find in k-town.  Guess what?  It was about the size of a pancake you would get at a diner.  Lame.  The bossam?  Well, that really hit the spot, but then again, you put pork belly in anything and I'm one heck of a happy camper.  The kimchi, bacon, chorizo paella was well....nothing more than glorified fried rice.  And where was the bacon?  I swear they used ham instead of REAL bacon because there was nothing but lean meat on there.So, Danji, are you really deserving of a Michelin star?  Or did you just fool the white people into giving you one by serving in the ""high end"" small plates.  I would think you would be better served by eating in k-town and get some really great food for much less: wait, money and way more food.  Sorry, but I don't think Danji is Michelin star material.",3,1,0,Phil L.,"Seattle, WA",167,876,249
3.0,1/6/2012,"Not memorable, but not bad eitherI had high hopes for Danji. Somewhere deep inside I hoped I would ""discover"" a better Momofuku (sans ramen and far more Korean, of course). I almost feel bad even making the comparison that every other person in NYC is bound to make, but let's face it: that's the standard against which anything remotely Asian or new is to be judged. In my perhaps naïve thought process, I thought that Chef Kim's much richer culinary background, and his likely close observation of Chef Chang's improbable rise to celebrity status, would drive some uber creative Korean fare. In some bizarre way, I guess I was eager to see someone challenge Chang's stranglehold on NYC's culinary throne. But it didn't happen. Don't get me wrong, none of the food was bad. All of it was prepared well. All of it was tasty. But there was a conspicuous gap, a clear let down of sorts: none of the dishes gave me that moment when you're like, ""Holy f*cking sh*t. Now that is what food should be!"" Our mushroom jook was a good start; the small-ish bossam that followed was presented nicely, but tasted as one would expect; the yellowtail collar special was a rare treat, particularly as it was untouched by any kind of fancy presentation; the sablefish was the star of the night, but was a dish I felt I had had numerous times across NYC before. Danji's ""kimchi trio"" supported us throughout and was an interesting take on the classic.I am left in bewilderment wondering if I just ordered incorrectly by steering clear of the sliders and wings that seem to dominate the menu. I may have to give it another shot to test this seemingly simple part of the menu for some deeper meaning like Chang's (now overly played out) pork buns or impossibly complex and delicious brined / smoked / confited / seared wings. Heck, when I first went to Momofuku, I thought, ""why in the hell does anyone care so much about this place?"" It took me awhile to ""get it"".

Sounded like something I would enjoy. You see, the tapas mindset has always been a little too welcoming for me, and what would smug mean in a tapas setting, I wanted to find out, something like a waiter saying: ""You gunna dip that twice? Try it. Yeah, I don't think so."" Turns out the review said snug tapas bar, and this place is very welcoming, and snug (what isn't in New York?) but that does not diminish the food, which is good enough to be smug about. Both the calamari with wasabi sauce and the grilled small ribs with some daikon magic were delishtastic. And they have Hitachino white ale! Wise.

3.0,12/20/2011,"Sometimes I think of myself as Ash Ketchum (in the most nerdy of ways possible of course).  Now before you ignore this review as being overly stupid, let me explain: I love the Michelin system and the day the New York Michelin list was released, I quickly left work and hurried over to Danji.  Danji is very much like the Momofuku restaurants: the chairs are uncomfortable, its loud, no reservations are taken, the space is tiny so you have to wait to get a seat, but damn is the food good. I went with a friend and because of our dietary differences, ended up getting two dishes each: he the Jap Chae and Bulgogi sliders, and I the tofu (recommended by Sam Sifton), and the sable fish (highly recommended by the wait staff) as well as sharing some kimchi.  Somewhat strangely, the kimchi arrived first; I know that some restaurants are into the whole food comes out whenever the kitchen's ready with it, but at Danji, we somehow ended up getting the kimchi first.  I'm not Korean, but I've never seen kimchi as an individual course.  To me, kimchi should be eaten as a supplemental accompaniment to something else - also for the 6 bucks that I was paying for that kimchi, I expected it to be more interesting.  Don't get me wrong, it was good kimchi, just not interesting or delicious enough to justify the price tag (I know 6 bucks isn't a lot but come on - its kimchi! you get it for free with everything in ktown!).  My first entree first - the fried tofu a dish that even as I write this a couple months after eating, remember.  The menu says its just fried tofu, but it's clearly lying - I eat a lot of tofu and that shit wasn't tofu.  It was a new and unique experience of flavors and textures.  The outside is lightly crunchy while the middle is soft and sticky almost like fried mochi.  Does that make sense?  No, because tofu's just one homogeous block of soy?  Because tofu has a funky texture that a lot of people don't like?  Well who cares: even if you don't like tofu, get the fried tofu at Danji.  My next course was the sable fish which was also fantastic.  It wasn't the unique out of body set of textures and flavors that I had while eating the tofu, but it was a homey dish that reminded me of eating a home cooked meal that my mom made.  It made me feel warm, fuzzy, and happy inside.  My dining companion's food?  Well it looked good and we didn't talk much during the meal because we were so engrossed in the food.",1,0,0,Stephen T.,"Manhattan, NY",33,21,0

We started with tofu, hamachi sashimi, and the pork ribs. My mouth was watering and the Shochu Sangria was a perfect compliment to the food.

Bossam, pajeon, tofu, and pork belly sliders were delightful, as were the cocktails, which were light enough to complement the array of Korean flavors.

Why must food command higher prices for smaller portions? Not too far away, there are lots of excellent Korean restaurants in K-town where kimchi is actually served free. Food:Kimchi (3 bites) - why must this place charge for kimchi when K-town restaurants serve that for free in additional to lots of other small appetizer dishes? The kimchi served didn't even stray from traditional kimchi and there were no free refills. Poached sablefish - pretty good but this is an easy dish to make. Bulgogi sliders - good except the bun was way too greasyWings - tried the spicy and the honey garlic ones. Nothing special (bon chon is better) about these wings at all.

We ordered the poached sablefish, spicy DMZ meat stew, trio of kimchi, bossam, and kimchi chorizo paella. Every single thing was DELICIOUS, but I have to give special props to the sablefish.

4.0,10/11/2011,"A quick disclaimer: I am in no way remotely well-versed in Korean cuisine. My experience with Korean food has been limited to the $8.95 Korean BBQ lunch platter across from my office, so the bar was pretty low. After dining at Danji, though, I have a feeling that the bar has been set extremely high for any future forays into Korean cuisine.I arrived at Danji at about 6:15 alone without a reservation and did not have a problem finding a spot at the bar. Sometimes I like to pretend I'm an international woman of mystery, eating alone at the bar in a foreign city and observing my surroundings... but given how small this place is and its location on a particulaly unscenic block (next to the post office), after a few minutes, I got bored and read while I waited. The restaurant definitely filled up very quickly. While it really is just a hole in the wall, the decor and feel is intimate and comfortable. I ordered an Asian Pear cocktail while I waited for my food - delicious... but definitely not alcoholic enough. I started with the pork belly sliders. They were spicy and crispy, definitely the perfect texture and flavor. The bun was one of the highlights - pillowy soft and weightless in your mouth. The sliders were followed by the bossam - my dinner ended up being fairly pork-heavy. The meat was absolute heaven - tender and juicy and just melted on your tongue. Finally, the couple next to me recommended the tofu. It was divine - but as I bit into the third piece, I could barely eat anymore since I was stuffed. The tofu itself is wrapped in some sort of gelatinous coating that is then coated in panko and ginger scallion dressing. If I weren't so full, this may have been the highlight of the meal. But I definitely overdid it. For 3 plates that left me stuffed and a cocktail, my bill came to $55, which is a small price to pay for a one-star Michelin spot. I will definitely be back - first of all, I live around the corner.

I don't really understand it because there aren't that many tables to begin with and there were also two waitresses working, which I thought was more than enough for that kind of space. At one rather desperate point, when my tongue was finally feeling the heat of the red paste and my glass had had no water in it for a rather long time, my boyfriend got up, walked over to the water pitcher at the waitress' desk, and poured it for me. At another point the couple beside us did that as well and when stuff like that happens, it makes me wonder why I even bother giving tip. The only person I should've given tip to was my boyfriend.

We also followed a number of his recs for food, with generally good results.The trio of kimchi is OK but very small and at $6 irritatingly overpriced for three minuscule stacks of picked vegetables.The tofu with ginger scallion dressing was very good -- four nuggets of deep-fried tofu with a mochi-like skin drizzled with a nice sauce and flecked with birds-eye chilis. Next came the spicy 'K.F.C.' (korean fire chicken) wings -- saucy, hot and juicy, with a sweet honey-garlic and chili glaze.The ""bossam"" (braised pork, scallion, dehydrated daikon kimchi cabbage wrap) was all right if a little dull, and the bulgogi beef sliders with spicy pickled cucumber and scallion salsa were tasty but pretty small (2 per order).The DMZ meat stew w. ramen noodles included shreds of hot dogs and cubes of spam -- the ruddy broth was hot and spicy, and the dish worked pretty well.Finally, the scallion & korean pepper pancake was crunchy and piping hot but pretty oily and took a long time to arrive.Given what you get, portions are small and prices on the steep side -- for example, each of those little sliders is $6, the bossam $18, and that 7"" vegetable pancake $10. The food is certainly attractively presented and tasty for the most part, but spicing and overall flavor punch are on the timid side (at one point we asked for hot sauce and were told they didn't have it).The staff is good-natured and helpful, and seating is communal with the exception of some small tables in the back.Overall, a good meal with nice presentation in a warm, convivial atmosphere, but portions (and spicing) could be more generous especially given the prices.",0,0,0,J.

3.0,9/27/2011,"First you should know that Danji's menu is split into two parts: Traditional and Modern. A friend took me here for my birthday last week and we split two tapas from either side of the menu.From Traditional:bbq skirt steak w. scallion salsa and 'danji' braised short ribs w. fingerling potatos cipollini onion & toasted pine nuts. Both of these dishes were really incredible. The skirt steak was lightly seasoned in that juicy, but not too overbearing way, and the short ribs (ok, it's really ONE rib) is served in a soup that houses the accompanying ingredients. The meat fell right off the bone. Yum!From Modern: Spicy 'K.F.C.' korean fire chicken wings and honey, garlic, four chilies kimchi bacon chorizo 'paella with fried jidori hen egg. I've got to say this was definitely the weaker side of the menu. I had ZERO complaints from the Traditional side, but here I had a few issues here. The chicken wings, while they were perfectly fried and had juicy chicken inside, felt a little bit fatty, and the glaze was too much like a honey BBQ that you could get from a fast food joint (my friend would disagree because she ended up bringing a to-go order home to her husband). As for the paella, well it was confusing at best. The kimchi made it taste like pre-packaged Mexican rice seasoning (if that makes any sense), the chorizo was a bit overcooked, and the rice was DEFINITELY overcooked. There was no texture, it was all mushy. It seemed almost like a failed attempt at risotto. I also disagree with the choice of serving with a fried egg. I am the first person to add egg to EVERYTHING, but I think in this instance it would have been far better to serve the rice in a steaming hot platter, and crack the egg open at the table (like the traditional Korean dish Bibimbap).Overall an interesting and delicious dining experience.

The paella was kind of bland, and the flavors it had did not feel well-assimilated. The meat stew was also fine, but it felt like nothing special.  The menu (and some of the Yelp reviews) make  you think that Danji is taking Korean food in a bold new direction, like Kogi actually does in L.A., but this food at Danji does not.  So while it would be unfair to give it low marks, the superlatives feel a little misplaced here.VoracoMeter=4 (out of 10)",2,0,0,Mr. Voracity I.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,83,0

Pardon the Asian in my genes, but that comes to about...three bites per slider (and I'm dainty eater), $6.00 per slider...$2.00 per bite.  Sablefish came out tender and flaky, with a neat circle of stewed daikon soaking up the tangy salty miso sauce.  Short rib stew (galbijim) was equally savory, rich and buttery soft.  Delicious as these two were, dollar for dollar it was just not worth it.  Our food also came in the strangest intervals -- the sliders showed up 10 minutes after we ordered, the fish and short ribs 15 minutes after they took our sliders away and...a small eternity for the kimchi paella.  Pffft. All in all, I'm glad I tried their food but really don't see myself going back, as I don't think the prices are justified.  BUT, LADIES -- this is a neat spot for a date.

This place is perfect for a date night. We were seated by ourselves so we didn't have to touch shoulders at the communal table seating. Danji has a mix of traditional and modern dishes, all of which looked amazing. We ordered the following:Traditional:- Trio of KimchiI love kimchi and this was pretty darn good kimchi. It came with pickled radish and pickled cucumbers. It was perfect with rice. However, for $5, it was pretty pricey. - Kalbi jjimAHHH! THIS WAS AMAZING! If you can only get one dish, get this and get a bowl of rice. The braised beef was perfectly marinated and fell right off the bone. It melts in your mouth and the pine nuts give it a kick and texture. Then, mix the rice and the sauce and lick the bowl dry because its that good! I highly recommend this dish!   - Budae JigaeIt was rainy and chilly and the budae jigae just hit the spot. Although it was nothing spectacular, this was the perfect dish for the moment and my friend and I enjoyed it very much.  Modern:- Paella w. quail eggThe paella was like a cross between kimchi fried rice and Filipino sig sig. It was yummy and perfect for sharing. Definitely get it with the quail egg and mix it well! It makes the dish standout!   - Spicy Pork belly sliderThe pork belly sliders were a great starter, so moist and juicy with just the right amount of spice.My friend and I were so happy we skipped Totto and came here.

4.0,8/19/2011,"Context matters. The slices of bulgogi in Danji's jap chae are a little too sweet, overwhelming the background soy-sauce-touched noodles. While the final result isn't bad by any means, the dish is one-note, and finishing it hardly leaves one wanting for more.But, pair that same bulgogi with some cucumber kimchi and put it in a pillowy bun? Suddenly, you have near-perfection: the kimchi cuts the sweetness, and vice versa. The bun is emphatic enough to provide a bass note, but the flavors inside are strong enough not to be smothered. And its soft yield combines with the cool crisp of the kimchi, the tender gristle of the beef, to produce an improbable fusion of textures that somehow seems like it was always meant to be.Korean tacos, eat your heart out.I thought context would matter more for Danji in general. My convive had spent some serious time in Korea, so I'd spared some effort to tamp down her expectations. ""It's not supposed to be authentic,"" I said. ""It's more like Korean-inspired small plates."" I was a little worried I'd chosen a little too... hip-ly, I suppose.But I shouldn't have worried. She finished the bulgogi slider with evident satisfaction. More eye-opening was her reaction to the pork belly slider, slathered in gochujang (a traditional Korean red chili sauce) -- she finished it in about five seconds flat. As anyone who knows me can imagine, I found this not in the least off-putting; it was in fact rather endearing. And hers was an appropriate response: the slider was a balls-out, deliciously messy alloy of its elements. The pork belly rock band to the bulgogi chamber music trio.The space, all flat white and hanging spoons, may be less than comfortable. The menus come, a little too cutesily, from drawers in the tables. But for the right situation, it's a charming little place, oozing a slightly nervy Hell's Kitchen energy as well as that ineffable quality of being near the zenith of the zeitgeist of NYC dining at the moment.The place is clearly not immune to the current trends: a perfectly lovely scoop of black sesame ice cream gets labeled ""gelato"", but if it is indeed milk-based in the Italian style, I sure as hell couldn't tell.  But I still think Danji is more than just a flavor of the month. I'd like to see the kitchen's take on yookwe, for example.

Korean fire chicken wings ($10): TASTY~!!!!  Probably the best spicy sauced Korean wings I've ever had.4. two bulgogi beef sliders ($12): good bulgogi on a sweet bun.  It was an OK slider.  Very small though.5. two spicy pork belly sliders ($12): TASTY.  A better slider than the bulgogi version in my opinion.  Very small as well.Random thought:  The waitress informed us that patrons obtain menus by sliding out a drawer under the table.  I thought it was cute at first, but the novelty wore off real fast.  Summary:  Danji serves some TASTY Korean fusion food.  I believe it's worth checking out maybe once to see if it's your cup of tea.  However it's pretty expensive in terms of what you pay for and the small portions you get.  Many of the items we ordered were simply refined versions of bar food at an extreme premium when it's $2 per wing and $6 per slider.....",0,0,0,Harvey C.,"New York, NY",84,273,2290
4.0,8/3/2011,"Decided to come here on a Wednesday night for a catch up session with girlfriends. My one complaint is that Danji doesn't take reservations for parties smaller than six, so we ended up waiting for about 30 minutes.When we finally got seated, we were promptly greeted by our enthusiastic waiter. My friend and I decided to try 2 of their house cocktails, and I'm glad we did. We tried the Merona & the house cocktail with dark rum & strawberry milkis. Is recommend the latter, since the Merona wmhad tequila which doesn't complement Korean food too well, no matter how modern it is. Bit then again, I'm a girl, so I like the fruitier drinks.Onto the food. For 3 of us, we got 3 dishes & 2 bowls of rice (were Asian, what do you expect). My friend was a little put off in the beginning due to the mini sized portions, but the quality of food redeemed the restaurant.1. Bulgogi beef sliders - tender beef, on slightly toasted buns, topped with a kimchi cucumber slice. My only complaint is that I wish o had marketed this idea first. My friends thought it was on the saltier side, but keep in mind they tend to err on the side of blandness.2. Kimchi pork tofu - my least favorite dish out of the three. Unfortunately, there didn't seem to be too much pork, so it was a really overpriced dish of Kimchi & tofu, which I can conjure up at home. I mean, I guess they need to pay the rent somehow.3. Sablefish - soft, butter, flakes off the fork, melts in your mouth good. It was like they kept the best for last, and I'm glad they did. But also was really sad because we demolished it almost instantaneously.I would definitely come back again, but warn my friends not to think of it so much as a Korean restaurant as a tapas place.",0,0,0,Katherine L.,"New York, NY",84,32,32

4.0,7/11/2011,"When I mentioned to my Korean friend that a trendy small plates restaurant of his native cuisine was opening in Hell's Kitchen, he was eager to see how it would measure up to the more traditional specialties that he was used to.  I arrived at the tiny space and was greeted by an extremely nice manager who helped me get settled at the bar while I waited for my friend.  Once my companion arrived, we were immediately seated at one of the long, communal tables, despite the substantial crowd vying for a similar outcome.  A delightful waitress approached and instructed us to reach beneath the table to acquire our menus from within drawers that had been built into the furniture.  This was such an adorable way to commence the family-style vibe that would carry us throughout the procession of shared plates.  Everything on the culinary storyboard sounded intriguing, but the waitress helped us narrow down the options with her laidback encouragement. We first started with some cocktails.  My Ginseng Soda was supposed to contain London Dry Gin, but all I could taste was the fruit juice components of lime and ginger ginseng.  My friend's Me-Ro-Na was composed of tequila, melon, soda, lemon, and orange bitters.  Though you could smell the smoky alcohol in the drink, you could barely taste it, just like with my beverage.  The included straw helped this fruity blend go down too easily, regardless of its smoky essence.Though our drinks were disappointingly weak, we decided to move forward with a lengthy string of tapas-style courses.  The Japchae vermicelli noodles were flavorful, but its included beef was under-seasoned, leaving the dish in need of salt.  The Bulgoki Filet Mignon Sliders were designated as being served for 2.  The sweet, toasted rolls were enjoyable, and the tender beef was perfectly marinaded, which was why I was so disappointed about the lack of meat within the bun.  The bread was so hefty that it completely dominated the sandwich, regardless of the spicy, pickled cucumber and scallion salsa topping.  The Kimchi, Bacon-Fried Paella was also created with a pair of diners in mind.  Sadly, the dish lacked seasoning and texture.  The rice was over-cooked and mushy.  Plus, there was hardly any spice or salt in the meal, despite the incorporation of the kimchi and smoked pork.  The best course of the evening, though, was the Braised Short Ribs with fingerling potatoes and pearl onions.  The meat was so tender that it literally fell off the bone and was easy to cut without the need of a knife.  The accompanying potatoes were firm, yet delightfully moist.  The hearty sauce resembled a thick stew or a savory onion soup.   We did find it odd that a side of rice was not included with the meal and that it needed to be purchased separately.  We debated splurging on a dessert, but the amiable waitress  helped us decide with her recommendation for an interesting Sponge Cake layered with a sweet potato mousse.   The treat was fine, but the pastry could have used vanilla for sweetness, and the custard would have benefited from a sprinkling of cinnamon and/or nutmeg.  Despite its sprinkling of powered sugar, the airy dessert did manage to say extremely light.Overall, we had an enjoyable experience at Danji, though my Korean friend was actually more satisfied than I was.  The food was above average and worthy of a 3.5-star ranking, but I decided to round up in my review thanks to the fabulous service that we received from the helpful waitress and doting manager, who took a real interest in how we liked the food and even asked about out favorite dish of the evening.  It was a meal worth trying, but not particularly one to go out of your way for.",1,0,0,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

5.0,6/13/2011,"Close to perfect. Every detail about this place delights -- I almost don't want to spoil some of the nice touches, ruining the sense of surprise (stop reading after the food review if you don't like spoilers.)Chef/owner Hooni Kim divides his menu into ""Traditional"" and ""Modern."" We tried both sides. The spring pea and edamame soup was thick, tasty and warm, with the crispy burdock adding texture and saving it from feeling too much like a mashed puree. The spicy whelk and soba, while a ""traditional"" dish, was a seafood I've never had before (whelks have hearty meat, a little similar in taste to, say, mussels but with much more interesting texture.) The bulgogi sliders were absolutely wonderful, with perfectly grilled bread and amazing meat. The spicy ""Korean Fire Chicken Wings"" were perfectly cooked and crispy good, but a little less interesting than the other dishes. The sable fish daikon was also perfectly cooked,  though again a traditional dish, the daikon reminding me of my mother's cooking, the perfectly flakey sable fish reminding me of fancy seafood restaurants (both good reminders, but not as delightful as some of the other dishes.) The generous side of Kimchi helped fill out the meal. I'm not a big drinker, but the bar had some interesting choices: an amazing Japanese whiskey (go with one ice cube, no water as this stuff is smooth) whose name I can't remember and a wonderfully hoppy (but not bitter), slightly sweet complex flavored Korean wheat/rice milky beverage called Makgeolli, which you really must try.The food was so good We returned for dessert after our show! Mango and sesame gelato, perfectly smooth no ice, though possibly served a little too cold at first (I feared it would be icy, but after chipping at it for a couple of seconds, it developed into an amazingly smooth texture.) The sesame had just the right amount of flavor, while the mango tasted like Alfonso mango (a flavor which most Americans unfortunately associate with artificial mango flavor -- though this didn't have the artifical tang of the fake stuff but I haven't had a real Alfonso in a long time.)During the meal, you'll start to notice little details. Being a small plate/tapas restaurant, the menus are stored in a little drawer at the table. No more asking the waiter for the menu if you want to add another dish! My companion loved the hooks under the bar to hang her bag. The makgeolli is served in little aluminum cups that look like plastic party cups. The aluminum keeps it cool, while the solid color and white insides keeps it from looking like you're drinking milk. The food flow was perfect: The couple next to us were in a rush to get to a show -- they named a specific time when they wanted to finish (which they hit dead on thanks to the kitchen timing.) We were a little short on time, also due to a show, but we told the waitress: But no rush! Our meal came at a slightly more leisurely pace, but we still made it perfectly on time. Right as we finished one dish, the next was coming out. Amazing! We were provided with Japanese wet naps after the wings. The decor is fun (check out the light covers) and the place is not too loud, though you will hear what your neighbors are saying as half of the seating is communal.Being a 30 or so seat restaurant, there are some less good seats. The back left table, while strategically blocked off from the kitchen/bathroom by a curtain, could be a little bit uncomfortable. The front left table nearest the wall is a little close to the bar and ordering station, which can be visually distracting for the person facing the street (though my companion said she felt she had plenty of actual room.)The staff was amazing, pleasant, energetic, but not overbearing and warned us against ordering too much food when we got a little too enthusiastic.This was a nearly perfect casual but upscale experience -- delightfully obscure ""traditional"" dishes, suprising modern dishes, perfect touches, perfect cooking, great service.

The ambiance/decor is nice and it's a cute little place for a date, but if you're into real Korean food like I am, don't expect to find too much authenticity here. A friend and I decided to try this place out after she saw the feature on Timeout. We decided to try both types of sliders, the bulgogi and pork belly, paella, and jap chae. To drink, I had the Asian Pear cocktail which was decent and my friend had some wine. Personally, I was disappointed with everything we ordered... maybe with the exception of the jap chae. The pork belly slider was way too salty, the bulgogi one was only ok, nothing to sing about. The ""paella"" was overly done to the point where some of the rice was crispy (maybe it was meant to be this way? who knows..).  Portion sizes are miniature, so expect to have room for dessert.. or maybe even some Mickey D's afterwards! We opted for dessert, but in hindsight should have gotten a big mac instead. I forget what kind of cake it was... green tea and something else... something unusual, but it was nasty and the table next to us thought so too. (I'll update the post once I remember what exactly it was...).Overall, hugely disappointed with the quality of the food and was even more disappointed after receiving the bill to see how much we wasted on so little (and I mean that from a quality and quantity perspective).  On the brighter side of things, service was great. Our waitress was very attentive to our needs and came back a few times to check on us. The manger (?) was also very friendly and attentive and came over to ask how our meal was.

But this place is far from hippie-ish. We started off with the Milkis and Asian Pear cocktails. Being Korean this needs no explanation because both are akin to my childhood. I would describe Milkis as something like fuzzy or bubbly yogurt. Asian pears are like sweet normal pears, but unbelievably refreshing. Worth a try! As for the food, we ordered the spicy pork belly sliders, which I thought were orgasmic! So oily, the pillowy soft bun just soaks up all that oil like a sponge. I know this sounds nasty, but it's kind of ridiculously delicious. I highly recommend if you enjoy a bit of spicy. Next came the Korean pancake. Not exactly mind blowing, but still tasted good. Pretty small compared to what my mom would make at home. Again, super oily but yummy. Next was the braised short ribs. I couldn't believe how well the meat was marinated. It was as if the meat became more flavorful the further you got into it. Then came the dwenjang jiggae, which tasted different from what I was expecting. Doesn't taste like traditional dwengang jiggae, but it was ok. Then we had the kimchi bacon chorizo paella, which was a glorified name for kimchi bokum (fried rice). Not amazing, but still tasty. Overall, I thought the dining experience very nice and enjoyable. I took my bf for his bday and although they didn't have a dessert menu, the waitress offered champagne to toast instead.

But since the wait was over an hour at hagi, we decided again to Danji.  Anyway, we had called Danji ahead twice in the same night to ask about the wait, and both times were misled to believe that the wait would be short to none existent, but when we finally got there, we waited an additional 50 minutes such that we were seated at about the same time as we got our call from the hagi wait list, about an hour and 30 minutes later! Disastrous.Now the food.  The food is fine, it's good, not drop dead wow take my breath away.  Expect to spend about $70/person to get full, 3 to 4 dishes/person (they tell you 2 to 3, but that's a lie, portions are really small).tofu w. ginger scallion dressing - the best dish we had there. absolutely delicious contrast between the texture of the soft tofu center and the crust, and the scallion ginger dressing was amazing.  this the only dish that I loved here.kimchi bacon* chorizo* paella for 2 - aka FRIED RICE ON A HOT PLATE, this was the most disappointing dish and sadly also the one that intrigued me on TV. not creative or impressive at all, not to mention the portion definitely did not look like the TV show. and this is probably their most filling dish, so you get an idea on portion. spicy pork belly sliders - also disappointed, taste was good, but the pork belly does not have the fat part, which is what makes it so delicious. but it was still good, I guess, but definitely not something I can see myself craving.pea soup - was alright, tasted a bit like the pea version of cream of broccoli soup.pancake - this was delicious, but nothing special, go to Ktown or China town and get scallion or seafood pancake, and it will be much bigger portions and just as good. steak tartare - I thought the addition of the Asian pear added a very nice refreshing touch to this, it was pretty awesome, but bizarrely came as the last dish of the meal, which was just weird.sablefish - pretty good, nothing too memorable.Host was awesome and comped our drinks for the long wait.  Doubt I'd go again.  In all honesty, I think Danji is a true 3 star restaurant, a trendy OKAY, but I just seriously disagree with the Yelp average of 4, so I'm biasing it lower here.

Korean food is known to be so flavorful, to have that kick of salt and spice and other yumminess but I just didn't  *quite* get that here.   It wasn't bland, it was just OK.  We started off with the fried calamari with wasabi mayo...just ok.  Not a ton of flavor except for the mayo.  Next were the chicken wings....again, just ok.  A little better than the calamari but certainly no bon chon.  Skirt steak - much better...the flavors are slowly starting to make their way into our dinner. Finally, the bacon chorizo paella with fried egg...this must be where all the flavor went!  Really really flavorful, but just a tad more spicy than I was expecting after all the previous dishes seemed just so-so.  All in all, it was good not great.  If I have a craving for Korean food, I'll still make my way down to K-Town.",1,0,1,Darlene L.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,58,0

We had these high chairs to sit on where my feet could not touch the ground but it was all part of the fun atmospere setting. In addition, our menus weren't given out by the wait staff. Instead they were hidden in a drawer beneath our cafeteria style table. Our waitress however did forget to tell us that the menu was there and only after 5 minutes did she come over and tell us, but she apologized.I had the brisket bulgolgi for lunch along with fried calamari with wasabi mayo. The fried calamari was light and perfectly fried. The color of the breading after being fried was a shade lighter than the normal golden color I see which is the way I like it. That coloring tells me that the oil from the fryer got changed and is fresh. The wasabi mayo was a great blend. Not too spicy and not too heavy on the mayo taste. Perhaps they used mayonnaise light? Hey an extra calorie saved is an extra calorie saved!!!As for our main luncheon special which included two miniscule sides which were the size of a piece of broccoli and a soup of the day, the soup was one of the highlights of our meal. Adding further to the meat extravaganza, our soup included bulgolgi, some clear vegetable that I think closely resembles the winter melon, beef broth and some other tasty seasonings. The blend was a attack our taste buds and my food partner in crime and I were left with nothing but a smile on our faces.As for the brisket bulgolgi with rice, perfectly marinated slices of beef that was juicy and tender over rice.

Hats of to them for picking up on the ""trend of the moment"" and making themselves some money - because they are doing that to be sure! Even if I were not Korean-American, anyone who has an interest in gastronomy and rudimentary knowledge of asian food would be greatly underwhelmed by the offering at Danji - which could be acceptable if they weren't charging obscene prices for some of the most basic dishes imaginable.The most infuriating part of the meal was the couple forkfuls of $10 Japchae (one of the most basic korean dishes - glass noodles with a shaving of beef and veg), and the braised short ribs....or should I say ""rib"".  Let me expand on that one - for $16, we received ONE (3in.) short rib, one pearl onion, one corner piece of carrot, and one 2in fingerling potato....you have got to be kidding me!! that was what put it over the top for me and my dining party.

Add on the amazingly tender beef, and you've got a winner!- Miso-marinated lamb chops: Also very tender, with a nice sweet-savory flavor.  Yum!- Spicy pork belly sliders:  Slightly spicy, beautifully flavored, great textures- Paella:  This was probably the largest dish we had.  The rice had a wonderful texture and I loved the bold flavors of the kimchee and chorizo mixed in, and the perfectly fried egg - the gooey egg yolk mixed in with all the other ingredients elevated the entire dish.  But then again, I do love anything with egg!For dessert, my friend and I shared the sweet potato cake, which we also enjoyed.  I liked that it was too sweet, and I liked the variation of textures:  gooey meringue, soft, starchy sweet potato, and fluffy cake.  The sweet potato flavor really shone through.Overall a great experience.  I'll definitely be back.",2,1,2,Velina L.,"New York, NY",283,558,9
3.0,3/28/2011,"Danji has gotten a lot of attention recently from the Wall Street Journal and New York Magazine. We wondered what a renowned chef could possibly do with Korean food, which is pretty difficult to fusion-ize or update.First of all, I had to get over the strangeness of being served Korean food from a server whose pronunciation is worse than my own. Second, it was difficult to decide how many dishes to order from the ""traditional"" and ""modern"" sides of the menu. How traditional was traditional? How modern was modern? What should we order that we can't make at home? We ended up with...- Crispy tofu. This one came with our server's recommendation. It reminded me of Japanese agedashi tofu with a little more seasoning. It came with a soy sauce kind of drizzle, and the flavors were pretty nice. This is definitely something I can't make at home. - Sliders with pork. Pretty tasty! The pork was nice and fatty and had a beautiful spice to it. I especially liked that the buns were grilled and charred, and gave the slider a nice, smoky flavor.- Braised short ribs (galbi jjim). This was utterly disappointing. Delicious, but you could order a whole plate of this stuff for a couple dollars more at a Korean restaurant. How much did it cost for ONE piece here at Danji? $16. Hmm. - Paella. Every review we've read talks about how wonderful this dish is, but it turns out that it's pretty much what my mom and all of my friends' moms made, except not with chorizo or on a hot stone plate. It's seriously kimchi bokkeum bap. Overall, it was an okay meal. If all you know about Korean food is BBQ and bibimbap, then you'll get a nice surprise here.

As I walked in, I was greeted by the very enthusiastic host who immediately made me feel at ease and offered me a spot at the bar since I still awaited my dining companion. The space is fairly small--though quite cozy--and can be a little tight to navigate, especially at peak times when the bar's buzzing with patrons, as it was on this visit. But there's something inviting and ironically calming about the space that I didn't feel boxed-in or uncomfortable. It's no wonder the bar tends to be pretty active -- as we later came to find out, Danji offers a pretty impressive beverage menu from classic cocktails to more interesting concoctions--like 'Asian Pear', which I and my companion (when he finally arrived) quite enjoyed. Beyond cocktails, other alcoholic beverages of choice include wines--sparkling, white and red and, beer, plus a whole separate listing for Soju + Sake. The menu features mostly tapas-style small plates (split into 'traditional' and 'modern' choices) so sharing--if you happen to be dinning with others--is encouraged.

The space is small but they've designed it well. It's modern with the sleek tables and bar stools but homey at the same time with the unique decor.

The wait staff were friendly, helpful, and efficient. And the manager actually succeeded to engage me in conversation without getting annoying.

Everything is small but share-able plates. For drinks I had the Asian pear cocktail, something I know I'll be drinking every time I go there. It's refreshing and very much memorable. Bottom line, and I told the manager this, all things Asian I consider my comfort food. I like this place because it manages to retain that homey feeling when I eat Korean food but at the same time it's edgier and more welcoming to the foreign palate. Will I come back? Sure. But will it replace my go-to spots in K-town? Impossible.",1,0,1,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",227,1549,2438

I'm a fan.  and it almost get five stars from me except for two things.  One, I find it a bit overpriced; and two, It only takes reservations for party of six and more, otherwise it would have been perfect.   When I heard who was behind this new small Japanese tapas bar/restaurant, I was like I must try.  Looking at this guys resume it would have been impossible for them to mess it up; and they actually deliver.   I enjoyed the food and the service very much.  I tried a few dishes, but really there's something for almost everyone.  I had the Japchae and it was tasty, moist and yummy, and it had a kick to due to the jalapeno garnish on top, but before that I tried the fried calamari and that was just perfect, exactly the way I like them, crispy on the outside but moist in the inside the may was good too, I like it wasn't too spicy. And to top it all, I had the hobak jook which it was perfect; this is a dish that could go wrong very easily, but not here.  I wan to go back for the pork sliders and some other dishes I saw... The service was very amiable. The manager and bartenders both were very friendly and helpful.  The cocktails were very good too, specially the Su Jung Kwa.  Overall a very pleasant experience with a bit of sophistication but yet casual and warm atmosphere.  Decor was modern and a bit organic; if I'm not mistaken it's from a designer from Brooklyn and that might explains it.",1,0,1,Eros A.,"New York, NY",422,319,25
4.0,1/30/2011,"Went here with a friend who was visiting from Atlanta over the weekend. The place was so little and tucked away I was afraid we were going to get seated right away but luckily we did. Right off the bat I loved the fact that the menus were located in a little drawer at the end of the tables. So cute! However, we did not realize it was going to be more of a tapas style restaurant. That was our fault for not doing some more research on the place, but we managed. We each got the miso beef tofu stew, which was excellent (even though it was pretty spicy). The calamari was pretty typical- nothing special there. The paella was super yummy though: mainly because it included bacon, which is my second love to life. We also got the pork belly sliders (loveeeee me some pork belly!!) and so did just about every other person in the place. I think the sliders must be their best seller, and they were definitely my favorite. The drinks were super pricey, so I stuck to soda. I honestly rarely order soda at restaurants in the city- i normally stick to water or an alcoholic beverage. Question- is it normal to charge for refills of soda? Because we were here- which was kind of a turn off. Overall I did love the place. It was quite a little gem and would most likely go back. The deserts looked good too, but we were pretty stuffed we could not eat anything else! I recommend!!

4.0,1/24/2011,"At the helm of the kitchen is Hooni Kim of Daniel and Masa fame. Located in Hell's Kitchen, a neighborhood inundated with Thai food, it distinguishes itself as a new player. Its niche are dishes are served 'Tapas' style (sharing plates), perfect for those like myself who suffer from tongue fatigue easily. The only difference between here and a Tapas joint is that each dish here will set you back a few bucks more, and before you know it you're washing dishes there.Upon arrival, you pull the giant metal spoon and open the door. You then see coat hooks on the right and a bar on the left. The wood here is reminiscent of Masa: light bamboo colored tables that were ostensibly polished with fine grit sandpaper for hours on end. In back of the bar are high tables with bar stool seating. A divider with chemically treated 'bibimbap' spoons are slotted into a makeshift wall. The 'regular' dining area sits adjacent to that 'wall' on the other side.After you situate yourself, your waitress greets you. You are asked to a pull out drawer in front of you for the menu. Two laminated pamphlet sized sheets of paper are inside the decorative drawer, lined with floral print contact paper. One menu is for drinks and the other for food. The food menu is divided into two sides: Modern and Traditional. Somehow I had the preconceived notion that this place was fusion-like. To my dismay, nothing seems like a stretch in terms of creativity here. If anything, the dishes seemed safe. To his credit, Chef Kim excels at not only presentation, but also in perfecting the cooking time for every ingredient. Also, the Chef prides himself in sourcing only high quality, hormone/antibiotic free ingredients (i.e. Niman Ranch, etc). Sadly, after the first dish was served, I already knew I was going to need a second dinner. Desserts are not listed but if you are into fluffy cakes, two are offered: a mocha chiffon cake and a green tea sweet potato cake.Ordered:-Spicy Yellowtail Sashimi ($12) [cho jang, jalapeño] - 4 bites of high quality hamachi wrapped with microgreens, topped w/ jalapeno and painted with a cho jang streak below it, great starter, I could have 20 of these!-Kimchi Tofu ($13) [grilled pork belly, kimchi, and tofu] - liked how the kimchi was still crunchy, pork belly was cut thinly, tofu mound was pretty plain, standard fare-Sablefish ($16) [poached sablefish w. spicy daikon] - aka black cod, super melty, daikon was brown, marinated in some type of soy mixture, enjoyed this very much-Short Ribs ($16) ['Danji' braised short ribs w. fingerlings & pearl onion] - aka Kalbi jim, also carrots in this, the Kalbi was like butter, you get about a 2 square in slab of meat-Paella ($14) (+$2 supp for fried farmhouse egg) [kimchi bacon fried 'paella' (for 2)] - served in a skillet, a natural marriage for kimchi/bacon/egg, they get an A for implementing this dish, despite the lack of soccarat sticking to the bottom of the skilletTHE GOOD:(+) Chef is a seasoned veteran with a big resume(+) Attention to detail in plating, presentation(+) Locally sourced high quality ingredients used(+) Ingredients synergize well together and are perfectly cooked(+) A new breed of food, Korean 'Tapas' style diningTHE BAD:(-) ~4oz proteins in dishes seem inadequate for sharing(-) Service a tad obtrusive(-) Price points can get hefty(-) Not vegetarian friendly(-) Very safe, not much creativityLEARNED:(+) When life gives you small portions, plan for a second dinner5 sharing plates will set you back roughly $50/pp, not including drinks or dessert. As much as I don't mind paying for good food, even that has its limits, especially for typical 'safe' fare you can find elsewhere. The only difference is that here, you know they are using  the good stuff. The food: Good? Yes. Worth it? No. With roughly 4oz protein portions for their dishes, we had to hit Empanada Mama afterwards for a second dinner. Totto Ramen, a few doors down, was the obvious choice but packed.P.S.

4.0,1/24/2011,"Clean top to bottom window glass and white brick walls calm you down when you walk in. Silky drapes hanging from the ceiling softens the bluntness of Edison's invention. Display of different spoons and danji (earth wares), and handsome looking giant Asian pear posing at the bar hint that you're in a Korean restaurant. As I got there, Carolina already was sitting at the bar accepting a free small glass of Bakeseju, which is ginseng+herbs soju from Vince, bartender. He pulled out another glass of Soju as I settled in. Alright, we like this guy, we decided to sit at the bar. Main seating is divided into high chairs with communal tables and traditional seatings. Menu at Danji has two sections; modern and traditional. Not by appetizers or main dishes. You sort of figure out which is which by price. Or they design the menu following tapas style. While we were chatting with Vince, the chef, Hooni Kim (who was trained at Daniel and Masa) came out. Brief exchanges of hi. ""He's busy now, but he will come out again"" Vince hinted us. Everyone is super kind. First dish was porched sable fish with spicy radish($16). I had such a high expectation for this one. When you touch fish with chopsticks, it gracefully opens its flesh with springy resist. When it allows to show its white innocent naked flesh, you hold the breath. Take a piece and put it in your mouth, your mouth probably open right back with 'Wow' exclamation. It's joy, joy, joy. Perfectly spiced up, authentically Korean, with greens on the side. Thin strips of ginger was a complement. My only complain is unnecessarily firm radish. When my mom cooks this dish, radish just melts in with explosive sweetness. Bulgogi beef sliders($14) was on the modern menu. Cuteness of sliders always win my favoritism. Chopped beef rather than a patty form work pretty well. It's saltiness counter balance of fullness of bread bite. Korean style pickled cucumber gives a coolness, but not entitled to steal the main spot. Nice support acting from back. Now, my dear friend decided to have a bottle of Bekseju($16) which means ""100 years old"" in Korean. It suggests that you'd live up to 100 years old if you drink this stuff. It contains lower alcohol percentage than regular soju, and it tastes sweeter. Danji offers Bekseju, soju and '50' soju. '50' soju is mix of soju and Bekseju. The result is less sweet and more alcohol. '50' obviously means '50 years old'. Also ""it works better with foods"", chef Hooni explains when he came out second time briefly to join the conversation. Then he vanished again into kitchen. Braised short ribs with fingering and pearl onion ($14) arrived at our corner. Oh, that savory steam coming out when server opened the porcelain lid, a promising sign. You can't lift the piece with chopsticks, it will deconstruct itself immediately. It's that soft and melting. Sweet onion and carrots, pine nuts make good companies. Even though I liked its not-overpowering taste, it could handle more flavors, I thought.  Our stomaches were asking more after three dishes. Alright, it's almost the end of year of 2010. Let it eat more. Vince persuaded us with KFC ($9) a.k.a Korean Fried Chicken. They have Thai spicy wings on the menu and just  added this one the night we visited. ""It's crispy, sweet, soy sauce, perfectly spicy...it's so good"" he chanted a spell. So, here we go.Wings were bigger than I expected, and indeed crispy. Sauce was mix of spicy & sweet & saltiness. These flavors were individual but not together. I can see how it started, but have no clue how it ended. But chef didn't forget details. Salads on the side was actually lightly, sourly tossed. Now we're pleasantly full, then the last visit of the chef. ""Did you enjoy the meal?"" ""Oh, yeah"" we replied in unison. ""Was it Korean?"" he asked. I appreciated this nervous question. To find a sustainable stand among Fusion Korean, Americanized Korean, Traditional Korean, Innovative Korean must be a hard one for a Korean chef in New York. To start with the definition of 'Being Korean' seems auspicious.Hooni actually dragged the manager Andrew through Flushing for about a year before opening Danji up. He showed real Korean stuff to this non-Korean manager, then told him ""but we are going to do a different way"", Andrew told me bragging about his non-credited BA & MA of Korean foods from Hooni, too.  Now, it turned out my friend emptied the whole bottle of Bekseju by herself. ""Well, now you passed the test. You're good enough to have a drinking battle with Korean men. I will set up one for you next time"", I patted her back, proudly. ""A yayaya..."", very Spanish reaction from her. Maybe we will hold a battle at Danji soon? Warming up with friendly free glasses of soju from Vince again? He can be our judge, then.",2,0,2,Jinhwa J.,"Manhattan, NY",14,28,121

From a guy who eats out a lot, saying that it's become part of the regular rotation says a lot. I'm a fan.The Miso Glazed Lamb chops are one of my favorite dishes... The salty pungency of good miso marinated lamb, with a little char from the grill, makes my mouth just water just thinking about these wonderful meat lollipops!I feel like nearly all Asian restaurants have a Sablefish/Black Cod dish on their menu. As a result, it's hard to stand out from the crowd. However, Chef Hooni's execution has never disappointed, and this dish is usually the one which is the most quickly finished.Both the sliders are also quite tasty. However, they could both be a little more spicy (I guess I could just ask for some hot sauce...) And, the brioche bun could sometimes be a little more toasted... That said, even when dining when dining alone, they are a must...While I'm not always a Riesling fan, the Alsatian Riesling which Danji has on their wine list is exceptional.

All the food is good but not great. Beer selection is too limited (only 3 beers selection). The wine selection per glass is not great - it is not cheap and the selection is very limited. The sochi is cheap though for half a carafe - the alcohol price is not balance there. Totta Ramen is right down the street, the fried chicken is almost the same price as a bowl of Ramen.

3.0,1/8/2011,"It just inevitably sounds like a total success. When words like Daniel, Masa, Tapas, Fusion, modern-Korean can be combined to refer to the same chef ...  and more as a personal note, when something like Kimchi-bacon paella is one of his signature creations, I just bought it without any doubt and convoked a small group of friends to have dinner at Danji. The uniqueness? of Danji is given by his ""shareable concept"" or Korean tapas type of dinning wrapped in a modern style where the look is as important as the food. A model that its being claimed somewhere as a new concept, although its been more than one year already that 8st Kitchen at Greenwich Village offer the same.. and ironically commit similar mistakes. The ambiance is one of the most inviting I been to and its the perfect reflection of what the chef creates in the plate, keeping his Korean roots while preserving flavors, but executed and modified by modern techniques to improve the result. Similarly, Danji, the space, is seductive by all meanings, from the lighting, glowing in amber to create a cozy and warm atmosphere, to the walls and furniture, in a white-natural color that successfully enhances his allure. And without to lost a trace of intimacy, in a friendly and seductive way, because Danji is designed to satisfy both, it keeps the functional idea of minimalism to what the furniture belongs to. Like keeping the menus in drawers under the table for every seat. The sign of his roots is given by many clay jars in the walls as well as spoons hanging in a shelve that separate 2 defined areas. The one with communal tables and stools for 9 people, and the one with tables and chairs for couples or smaller groups. And it's a sign of his roots because those clays and spoons I'm just guessing are the traditional tools used to keep kimchi, as the name Danji, refers to no other than that and I can't imagine there is no correlation in between them. As much as I loved the space, a close look to the details denote more attention to the surface than the execution. While the drawers, and I tried more than one, have problems to be opened and the space is quite tiny making any movement uncomfortable, nothing annoyed me more than not having, or at least I couldn't find it, any hanger for either coats or bags. Unfortunately, its the same with the food.  It was exciting on the paper, appealing in the look but tasting however ""just good"" rather than exceptional as I should expect from what I hear. Like many izakayas or Spanish joints you order tapas to share although the portions are closer to the ones offered at any Izakaya, but just twice the price.  It means that for a complete dinner you will need at least 3 per person. We order the Spicy Yellowtail Sashimi, ($16), Bulgogi beef sliders ($16), Kimchi-bacon fried paella ($16) and ""Danji"" braised short ribs with fingerlings and pearl onion ($15). The flavors were delicate, the ingredients high quality, the meat was tender, the flavor was certainly Korean .. but anything was as exceptional to be remember more than this. The cocktails were well balanced in flavor but in the very sweet side. I wouldn't recommend any of the ones my friends allow me to taste, including Asian Pear, Me-ro-na and Ginseng soda. The wine list however, is good and I couldn't help but order a glass of red Relativity Violeta 08, that I tried first time at Pinkerton a few months ago. I knew I'd love it. As a note about the service I have to say it was lovely. Everybody was friendly attentive and did their best to accommodate us in the best way. Nothing but the ambiance impress me enough to come back. For creativity and sophisticated Korean food I rather go to Woo Lae Oak.  Because except for the sweetness of their cocktails, I'm really gonna need more. Either more food either more creativity... but probably will need both. My rate, 2.5",22,10,15,Laura A.,"Brooklyn, NY",232,344,1232
4.0,1/5/2011,"Went to Danji for dinner on a Tuesday night, it was in an unassuming spot in the mid-50's in midtown NYC.  The ambiance was warm and Village-esque, with an informal wine bar like setting of long tables and high chairs up front, and a few tables in the back.  The design of the walls and the bar was where the money was spent.  Affordable decor abounds in the rest of the space, e.g.  the alternating wooden and silver spoons used as hanging decorations.  The food we had was all exceptionally delicious, but on the small-side in terms of portions, and with a high price-tag.  The cocktails we tasted were all top-notch and uniquely inspired by Korean cuisine.  In order we had:1. Miso beef stew  - hearty in flavor, deep and delicious.  I could taste that the miso used in the dish was of top-quality.  But, the portion was inordinately small for the price tag.  Why not ladle a bit more into a larger bowl for the price?  2. Sablefish in a dark soy broth w/ a side of rice (add. charge) - Perfectly poached sablefish of a quality which I have not seen except at the top-level restaurants, in a delicious dark soy broth, with a large slice of radish.  I couldn't stop eating this dish, and took a spoon to the savory broth during the meal.  This dish was also pricey ($16), but worth every penny, as the preparation is uniformly excellent.3. Kimchi fried rice paella w/ farmhouse egg (add. charge) - Wonderful ingredients on a sizzling plate to get that crunchy rice flavor, but was purposefully made with not enough salt by the chef so as not to drown out the flavor of the pork on other ingredients.  However, I say nay.  The dish needed more kimchi (spicy fermented cabbage) flavor, and salt to make the dish truly delicious.  The chef should bring it on and not be so timid in this dish, it has the potential to be a stand-out on the menu.4. (Special) Hot pork belly sliders - This was a special that day on the menu.  A variation on the bulgogi sliders on the menu.  These sliders were especially delicious, with a good schmear of spicy sauce and some creamy mayo-like concoction to counter the heat.  Amazingly delicious, but for the high price, could have been a bit larger and more satisfying. I have to highlight the two interesting Korean-inspired cocktails on the menu, the Me-lon-a (which was not too citrusy, and smoothed out by the milkis = delicious), and the Soo jung kwa (inspired from a traditional Korean cinnamon-y drink) which tasted amazing, but was marred by three large icecubes and not enough cocktail for the price.Overall, I would recommend the place for the high quality of the food, its creative take on Korean cuisine, and its unique cocktails.  But, a star is docked for the high prices.  The prices need to come down, or the portions need to go up to create a better value proposition for the incoming diner and be worth a second visit.  Hopefully they will do one or the other as the economic reality of supply/demand and location sets in for the owners.",5,2,2,Albert S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",39,5,0

Improvement or interpretation, the food is focused, refined, and for the most part, very successful.There are welcome riffs on Korean classics with French technique that's indicative of the fine dining pedigree of the Chef.  A fantastic kalbi jjim ($14), is redolent of a melt-in-your-mouth meaty Daube de Bouef, but distinctly Korean in flavor.  A well developed braise and experience as a saucier is necessary to glean the textural heartiness and depth of flavor in the deceptively dainty bowl of dwenjang jjigae ($6).Proving that Korean classics by any other name are still en vogue, Danji cooks a sizzling hot kimchi bokkeumbap ($16) - described on the menu as ""paella"".  This dish usually requires a skillful choreographed sequence of rendered animal fat (hopefully in the form of pork belly), a very hot cast iron surface, and a shmear of sticky rice to create that magical 'soccarat' crust.  Danji's version pays homage to the original, adding carefully brunoised bits of animal and vegetable, as well as a 'farm fresh egg' on top - i'm sure the Chef's former employer, Monsieur Boulud, would approve.  Within the fusion slanted menu, the bulgogi beef sliders ($14) immediately stand out.  The small-ish sliders (two to an order) are simply constructed - a respectful pile of triumphantly beefy bulgogi, topped with a single slice of oisobagi (cucumber kimchi) to provide contrast.  They're playful and superb, but a mite on the pricey side.The ambiance is appealingly cozy, yet 'modern' in its use of functional appointments such as Edison light bulbs and individual drawers to hold the food and drink menus.  And it mercifully strays from the kitsch that other Hells Kitchen joints seem to exude - I would expect this level of 'hipster-chic' in the Village instead of gastronomically impaired Hells Kitchen.As a resident of the area and as a Korean, i'm quite pleased that such a restaurant has opened with a location and cuisine near and dear to my heart.  I'll continue to trek 20 blocks south for my Korean food fix, but at 2 blocks away from my apartment, Danji will most certainly do.",19,8,22,Chris H.,Hong Kong,170,603,2140
4.0,12/20/2010,"While Danji brands itself as Korean tapas, it's actually a little broader and more Americanized than that (for instance, we had sashimi, chicken wings, bulgogi sliders and calamari). Food does not disappoint, however, despite its straying from its core competency. We enjoyed all of our dishes, though I note there was nothing terribly exciting or unique about them. We didn't have any of the cocktails, but they looked like what you would expect (e.g., lychee martini, sake cocktails, etc.).  While the food and drinks were about what we expected, service here was truly a step above the rest. We were always greeted with warm smiles and friendly input, and this is what really separated it from other similar establishments.This is a great place to grab a pre-show drink or bite to eat. Quick and easy, and less pretentious than most of the other pre-theater restaurants around here. The best part is that because you've eaten tapas / small plates beforehand, you don't need to justify (to yourself, or anybody for that matter) gorging again after the show.",1,1,0,Nils H.,"Denver, CO",40,188,0
4.0,12/17/2010,"Tasty Korean tapas.  My favorites were the sablefish and bulgoki sliders.  I also enjoyed the short rib and the chicken wings, although the wings come with some heat so be prepared.  The paella was slightly salty to my liking.  Staff were super friendly.  I look forward to seeing their full food and drinks menu.  I liked that they had the Hitachino white and amber.",0,0,0,Dairo I.,"Manhattan, NY",3,15,0

4.0,12/16/2010,"Stopped in for the soft opening featuring a limited menu.  Grand opening is tomorrow.  The staff was very welcoming, and the resto had a cool vibe inside. Menus were in drawers at the table...that was a first for me, but it makes a lot of sense: since the place is all about Korean tapas, you can share a few dishes and then go back to the menu without having to call your waiter over.  Brilliant!  Between two people, we split three dishes, and that was just enough food for a late night bite. Of the three, the best had to be the short ribs. If you think short ribs aren't tapas fare, you'd be wrong.  It was like a mini short rib entree shrunk into tapas size.  Delicious.  The bulgogi sliders and spicy chicken wings were very tasty too.  Great place to go with a group of friends.  Can't wait to try the full menu.",1,0,0,Christine R.,"Savannah, GA",50,162,12
