1.0,3/6/2019,"There are many reasons why I'm giving Reserve Cut such a low rating such as a snooty sommelier who seems to possess no knowledge of wine other than its price on the menu. But above all, the main reason I would never return is the blatant LIE they tell on their menus. For a hefty price of $109, what you get is 109% not wagyu beef. It was tough, chewy and lacked seasoning. There was definitely no sign of marbling in the meat. In fact, I actually enjoyed my coworker's steak more and it was almost half the price.We got the short rib tacos and a couple of other apps which weren't bad but nothing great. The restaurant itself was beautiful but with such high costs for average food, you're better off going somewhere else.",3,0,0,Stacy X.,"New York, NY",10,10,3

2.0,2/13/2019,"BUYER BEWAREGood restaurant with good ambience and sub-par service. I ordered a steak which was cooked very well and tasted great. However, the service was not perfect because of an issue my fiancé had when ordering.After ordering two specific sushi rolls my fiancé was brought two rolls which she did not order. She asked for two cooked rolls, which the server said was fine, but apparently they could not prepare them as asked, and rather than tell us that, the server brought us the closest thing- raw fish. Had my fiancé known that the cooked fish could not be provided, she would have ordered something else.Even though our server recognized that she did not bring what my fiancé ordered, noticed her displeasure, and then tried to justify why she brought us two items that we didn't order without asking if it was okay first, she did not offer to correct the order. She was very unapologetic and I believe that reflected her lack of respect for us as customers. As this dinner was in celebration of our engagement that occurred earlier that evening, my fiancé asked me to not make a fuss about it.I find this unusual for a restaurant of this quality as restaurants normally would correct their mistake. Given that this was a special occasion and that we spent so much on this dinner, we expected to be treated better and perhaps shown that we were respected as customers.",1,0,0,Joseph S.,"Danbury, CT",0,10,0

3.0,12/18/2018,"So, I only dine kosher when in the company of my Jewish friends. Thus,  this is 3 star range for me. I'd probably rate this a 4 if I were keeping kosher, though. Does that make sense?The restaurant is beautiful inside with excellent service. I happened to be with someone who was very rude to the waitstaff, but they handled it with grace. It was more annoying for me to have to say ""thank you"" for the both of us. Anyway, super attentive to all details - water refills, plate clearing, timing, etc.Personally, I didn't love the food. I was just on meat overload. We had the short rib tacos, which I wasn't into at all. It was heavy and juicy + and then I watched my friend squirt taco juice all over himself, then he dipped his cloth napkin into water to completely soak the front of shirt....ahhhh....it was terribly unattractive. We also had the beef jerky; it wasn't bad, but it's not my style. Neither appetizer was memorable (aside from watching it being violently eaten from across the table). It was a winner to half of my party. My filet was tough by non-kosher filet standards. I think it was good for where we were, though. I'd go with a more fatty cut in the future.  Fries were crunchy, a plus. Dessert was well presented. All drinks were great - I had  a couple dirty Grey Goose martinis, as well as some jasmine tea. The meal was $350 - and when I looked at the check, he tried to tip just 20 dollars. Terribly ashamed by that and glad I caught it to add cash to the tip!

5.0,11/5/2018,"Living in Boston and trying to keep kosher we never get the chance to eat at a top steakhouse. We recently went to New York and we made sure to make a reservation.Reserve Cut was an amazing experience from the time we sat down until the time we left for the evening. I would say they rival even not Kosher Steakhouses for quality and taste of the food they serve.The service was attentive and excellent the entire night. We started with the Steak Tartare which was very good with a little kick that made it even better. The only thing I could be critical of the entire night would be the inconsistent knife cuts on the tartare but that's about it. For main we had the Reserve Cut Steak which was tender and flavorful with sides of the Shisto Peppers and Truffle French Fries, both great choices.

4.0,10/12/2018,Attended this establishment along with my girlfriend and my parents on Valentine's Day. This place was beautiful. Rose petals lined the doorways and we requested to be seated in the wine gallery for dinner. Very professional staff. We ordered drinks as we waited at the bar for my parents. The waitress took more than 5 minutes to acknowledge us and ask what I needed which was rude. She made up for it my making our drinks strong . We got our seats and sat at a round table with good lighting. Our waiter was very attentive and explained what was available on the menu. He did show some concern about the affordability of a steak I inquired about. I wasn't insulted and insisted on it. It's in the picture below. Great steak. Kosher and medium... Truffles added a burst of flavor. Their was no foie Gras available which pissed me off but overall we had a great time.

5.0,9/14/2018,"My husband & I returned last night to Reserve Cut for our anniversary.  We received an email from the restaurant advertising Date Night @ RC.  We were curious since the cost was only $75 per person. We thought that at that price the 3 course meal would be very small.  We were delightedly surprised.  For the first course there was a choice of 4 appetizers.  My husband had the short rib tacos and I had the mushroom soup. Both dishes were delicious. For the second course we both took the 12oz filet mignon.  Our steaks were perfectly cooked. We ordered medium rare. Mine came a little over cooked, so one of the many maitre'ds took it back and returned with a perfectly cooked more toward rare steak. Delicious!! They were served on a bed of potato hash. For the third course there was a choice of 4 desserts. My husband had the mixed sorbet & I had the chocolate bomb.  Both desserts were presented on plates that had happy anniversary written in chocolate and a lighted sparkler. Delicious & beautiful!  There was an option to take a wine pairing for each course for $18.  I took that option. They gave me a glass of Pinot Grigio for my soup, a red wine, I don't remember the name, but it fell between a Pinot Noir and a Merlot for my steak. It was very good & a glass of champagne for my dessert.  This special is only available from September 12th - September 27th.  It was definitely worth it.  If you have a chance to go before the 27th you must try it. Keep in mind that you have to ask your server for the Date Night menu or you will only be presented with the regular menu. That menu is large and extensive. The wine menu is also large and there is a nice assortment of signature cocktails. I had the frutti-tutti.  It was refreshing & delicious.  The wait staff was professional as always and the maitre'ds (as I said there are a lot of them) were on top of everything.  Being Thursday night, the restaurant was very busy, so service was a little slow. That is where the maitre'ds stepped in to help.  We were, as always very impressed. We had a wonderful anniversary dinner and were very happy that we made the trip from Staten Island on a week day.",0,0,0,Sylvia K.,"Staten Island, NY",0,24,27
2.0,9/6/2018,"I was fortunate to have a nice lunch at Reserve Cut and had to order the crown jewel item in the menu, the 22 OZ WAGYU BEEF BONE-IN RIB STEAK. It was a tasty steak and it came with bone marrow on the side. I've never had a wagyu steak before and wasn't sure what to expect. In some ways I was disappointed because it tasted like a regular steak to me.Upon telling friends about my experience and reviewing my photos, I realized that they did not give me a wagyu steak. I asked for my steak mid-rare and they cooked it closer to medium. I snapped a pic of it and realized later on that the steak did not possess the marbling you'd usually expect from a wagyu steak.It's a shame that this steak itself costs $109 and that I might have been bamboozled since I was a newbie to the wagyu world.I'd advise anyone to be weary of what they advertise versus what they actually serve you because my crown jewel experience ended up a mediocre disappointment.",1,2,0,Jonathan B.,"Belleville, NJ",479,29,22

5.0,6/24/2018,"I chose this place to hold a dinner for my company. Eva Wexler, the Reserve Cut's Special Events Coordinator, made the experience magical from start to finish. Out of all the kosher restaurants in NYC - this restaurant had the best menu, was the most beautiful, and Eva priced our special event with a jaw-droppingly low minimum for the evening. Eva made sure that our wine choices were stocked for a party of 19 a week in advance of our event, and when I remembered we needed seating cards the day before, she was able to print them out in time for our dinner. I spoke to her numerous times over the course of 2 months and she gave me pointers on menu options, wine, how to seat people, etc. and even let me change the date. When I finally showed up for the event, she even offered to help me pack up goodie bags I was assembling for the party. I can't say enough kind words about Eva, but also about our entire experience at the Reserve Cut.

5.0,6/16/2018,"One of my favorite places in the city. Probably best kosher restaurant I've to. It's on the second floor of the Setai residence in Wall Street. Place is really nice. Walls are transparent wine cellars. Service is impeccable. You definitely need a reservation otherwise you may have to wait. I ate in both dining rooms and they are both great. The one next to the bar is more lively in my opinion (TV's above the bar) and the one on the back more formal. Menu offers a variety of steaks and sushis (most kosher restaurants offer both for non meat eaters due to hashgara issues). I tried almost everything on the menu and it has always been delicious. My favorites are short rib tacos, beef sliders, surprise flatbread, beef jerky, tuna tartar for appetizers. Main course is often a large waygu steak for me. I'm not a desert guy. Wine selection is impressive for kosher. Unfortunately all of the above comes with an average cost of $100 per person. It's expensive. Perfect for special occasions if kosher is a must. One little annoying detail regarding bottles of water. Servers are filling up every glass to the rim every 5 minutes to push you to get more bottles. It's a cheap method in a classy restaurant.

Asparagus was so bad - old and they served the very bottom of the stalks. Not a tip in sight. Totally inedible. Waiter was clueless about the menu items. Had no idea what risotto was - he thought it was pasta. We had to explain its rice and he should check with the kitchen to confirm. Decent wine list.

4.0,5/16/2018,Pretty good kosher restaurant. Just a warning that the prices are very high (you can't get an appetizer for less than $20 and the mains are $40 and higher). I ordered the tuna tartar and it was good but I wish that it had more sauce that went with it. It was a ponzu sesame sauce that went great with the tuna and avocado. I don't think that they needed to add caviar to the dish. It almost gave the dish a salty flavor which didn't go with the sauce very well. I then got the branzino (filet instead of the whole fish) and it was cooked well. The skin on the outside wasn't crispy enough so it had a slight fishy taste. I also thought that the olive tapenade would be more pronounced within the dish. Lastly I had the s'mores dessert and it was sooo rich. I wasn't able to eat the whole thing because of how decedent it was. If I were to come back I think I would try different items on the menu but the dinner was very good.,0,0,0,Melissa P.,"New York, NY",131,354,692

5.0,4/25/2018,"We went to reserve cut for my birthday. my friends decided it would be nice to surprise me with dinner especially a steak house. We had done the others, Ruths Chris, Lugers, Porter House, STK, it was time to try a new place. Reserve Cut does not disappoint. upon entry of the elevator to the second floor the doors open and you're greeted with a large waiting area with comfy couches with pillows and a bar further inside. Prices at the bar range from $10 for a beer to around $18 for a specialty cocktail. I had one made with Makers Mark, Lime, Mint and some sort of mixer. it was delicious. Decor is top notch and you can tell they spared no expense in decorating the place. Lots of fantastic leather bound chairs, fine linens and flatware decorate each table. wait staff is professional and friendly. The food simply put is amazing. Prices are on the high end as you are paying for top notch cuts of beef, available Waygu, Prime cuts and add in the fact that it has all been blessed by a Rabbi (Kosher) and you know you're eating quality beef. We settled on a few starters, Sliders, some Short Ribs, and for me Steak Tartare with a quail egg. flavors and seasoning were perfect. the tartare could have used more crostini rounds but i'm nit picking.For our mains I ordered a 16 ounce Rib Eye, a few others ordered Filets and more ribeyes. the special of the night was a Steak for two at 40 ounces carved table side. price tag on that? $295.00 This steak house is not for the faint of heart. sides included mashed potatoes with truffle, Asparagus and string beans. all seasoned perfectly with just the right amount of crunch for the greens. The added bonus was the steak sauce served with the meat. I cautiously tried it hoping it wasn't an ""Asian inspired"" semi-sweet glaze of sorts. To my delight it was a concentrated Beef Au Jus style sauce with mushrooms at the bottom. simply divine. Prices are to be expected for this area of Wall Street in FiDi. I recommend you come with a wallet filled with plastic or cash. the bottle of wine we selected was on the low end of cost and was $100.00 for the bottle.

2.0,2/21/2018,"After taking the elevator up to the restaurant, you can tell that it is a very  beautiful and swanky restaurant. The decor is really top notch. We were greeted politely and warmly at the front desk and were asked to wait a few moments before being brought over to our private room, as we had a decent sized party that evening. I was pretty excited as I have heard nothing but great things over the years. Walking in, the aroma of food from other tables smelled great! I had high expectations for Reserve Cut and was anticipating a good meal. However, once we got down to ordering, I quickly realized that my expectations for the night would not be met. We tried to order multiple times from our waiter and he was always busy and popping in and out. Fine, but on top of our meal, we had to pay a special additional fee for the private room. I feel that if I have to pay an additional, quite high fee and also meet a minimum ordering fee, my server should only be serving my room/party. He also should be knowledgeable about all the items on the menu. Also, one of the women in our party is allergic to gluten- not in the oh, I'm doing ""low carb"" or ""paleo"" kind of ""allergic to gluten"" but would actually get sick from it for days. Every item on the menu we had to ask him at least three times if it had gluten or not- all of them he didn't know. He'd say he'd check and come back but wouldn't come back and just placed the order instead. I'm not sure if this was him being clueless, or not giving a damn. To me, that is just a very dangerous thing to do, to not really check or adhere to someone's allergies listed. Gluten allergies are quite common, so I'm surprised he didn't know at all. The waygu beef was kind of bland and didn't feel up to other places I've had waygu beef. For the prices and the hype, I just honestly expected better food and service.

This is my husband's and I go to place for special occasions.  I tried so many things on the menu at this point. Ribs are tender and fall off the bone good. Sushi is fresh and tasty. Beef carapacio is something different. The risotto is delicious. Even the French fries are great here. The thing I always come back for is the increabile steak. Tender, juicy and delicious. Always seasoned just right and cooked to perfection. I really like the service, very nice and attentive. Waiters are friendly and always try their best to give great recommendations. It is a pricey spot, but I always feel like it's well worth it because the food is always on point. I haven't been disappointed yet.

5.0,12/31/2017,"My husband took me here motzei shabbat as a prep for my upcoming birthday.Reserve Cut is located in the second floor of a half residential - half commercial building in downtown Manhattan.We made a reservation that same night about 2 hours before hour ETA and the person who picked up the phone was very pleasant and professional.Once we walked into the restaurant, we were greated in the most amicable manner; we checked our coats and we were taken to our table.Diving straight into the food:To start, we got delicious warm bread with sweet butter on the side and ordered the Cranberry in Fall cocktail which was Bourbon based.For appetizers, we go the short rib tacos. The tortilla was crispy and the meat was juicy and flavorful; this dish came with an onion and mango salsa on the side which was refreshing. We also ordered the truffle thyme risotto which came with bone marrow. This starter was not heavy and the risotto was very well cooked along with the porcini mushrooms. The bone marrow was definitely a great add on to this signature appetizer!For the main dish we ordered the 20 Oz cote the bouef, a succulent medium cooked bone-in prime rib cut, accompanied with another bone marrow and garlic bread crumbs on top. we asked the server to bring it to the table cut in slices that way we could easily and rapidly delight from this awesome dish.Finally, we ordered the peanut butter parfait along with regular coffee and fresh mint tea.The parfait was nicely presented and it was enough for us to share. The coffee was freshly brewed and the fresh mint tea was presented in an individual pot.The service was great; servers and runners rapidly attended to any of our needs and answered any questions we had about the menu.The ambiance of the restaurant is elegant and chick. I think Reserve Cut is a space designed for most adult gatherings such as birthdays, dates and guys/girls night out and business meetings.Besides the steaks, they also have a sushi and sashimi menu as well as ""appetizers from the sea"" and the highly acclaimed wagyu beef which I will beh trying next time.",2,1,1,Shifra S.,"Crown Heights, Brooklyn, NY",185,43,108

4.0,12/24/2017,"I'd never heard of Reserve Cut before eating there, but after stepping into what looks like a generic office building in FiDi and going upstairs, you find yourself in what is a deceptively large restaurant with low lighting and a really cozy feel and ambiance out by the bar. While there's a little bit of seating out front, we (along with most other diners, it seemed) ended up in the back in a similarly low-lit dining room that is past a couple of minimalist fountains and the wine racks. Even when it fills up, it was still easy to chat with folks around the table, and the servers were great at getting stuff to us quick and making sure no one was without a beverage.One thing to note is that the prices are on the higher side here for everything, and it was a little bit of sticker shock when I first took a look. That said, it is worth it - the food here is extremely good, with nothing really striking an off-note. We shared a bunch of sushi for the table, and while I wouldn't say that you should cancel your reservation at a high-end sushi counter to eat here, it was above what I had expected - the fish was fresher than I would have thought, and the rolls were quite decent too...they weren't overpacked with rice as they can be at times. I remember less about the rest of the appetizers, although the sashimi tacos stuck out as being delicious. The steak, though, is absolutely phenomenal...I went with the Prime Reserve Cut, and what a treat that was. The cut of the steak was superb - the texture reminded me a bit of flank steak, but it ate like the prime rib - and cooked medium with a little bit of garlic, it had so much flavor without needing to be dressed up. On its own, the steak was arguably one of the best I have eaten anywhere, even if the price is steeper than some other places. All of the sides The pricing is definitely on the higher side, but it is arguably worth the extra amount in some (if not all) cases. It's worth a visit to try the steak, although you may come out feeling disappointed when other meats don't quite measure up...that is how I have felt at some meals since I have been here!",0,0,0,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169

We ended up splitting the 22 oz wagyu instead of each getting our own smaller cuts and it was SO GOOD. We both kept lamenting how sad we would be when there was no more left to eat. It came with two sauces and bone marrow, which was delicious. We also had the short rib tacos which came with 4 and were so flavorful.

4.0,10/25/2017,"This is the fanciest restaurant I've ever eaten at in my life. It's also the most expensive. If you're reading this it's because you want to know if this place is worth the money. The ambiance and atmosphere are 10/10. Loved everything about it as soon as we walked in. The service is also top notch but that's to be expected from a place like this. The drinks, apps, and sushi were also some of the best I've ever had in my life. The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because I was underwhelmed with the entrees and desserts. I came in as a party of 5. When you're paying over $100 for a wagyu steak you'd expect it to be absolute perfection. We ordered them all medium but each steak came out cooked differently. The steaks were very good and the lamb was amazing, but I just was expecting a little more from them when everything else blew me away the way it did. The desserts also didn't really taste that good.

For dinner I had the filet mignon with an herb roasted plum tomato and chimichurri sauce. My date had the Prime Reserve Cut with half roasted garlic and aromatic herbs. Both steaks were cooked to the perfect temperature as requested, juicy and flavorful. For our sides we ordered the yukon potato mash and the four mushroom saute. Everything was spectacular!! We also had a bearnaise sauce and a burnt onion sauce for the table to put on anything to our pleasure. Believe me when I say a  little bit of those flavors on your meal will be popping in your mouth. To drink we went with a bottle of Chianti which was full-bodied with a wonderful aroma. For dessert I had the apple strudel basket. There was crackled caramel on top of the strudel and wow! It was absolutely scrumptious and certainly will be memorable.

This was my second time going to Reserve Cut in a month and I decided to go back because the service was so fantastic the first time. This recent visit wasn't so great. Our server was okay but warmed up after he got his tip at the end of the night. After dinner my boyfriend and I went to the bar for a few cocktails, as the restaurant is beautiful and we wanted to enjoy it longer. That night, my boyfriend got violently ill and kept running to the bathroom to throw up. I was feeling nausea as well but nowhere as near as bad. Turns out, he had full blown food poison and I had a touch of it because I only had 2 bites of his lamb. He was so sick he couldn't get out of bed the next day. I called the restaurant the following day to let someone know that we got sick and ended up on the phone with Alejandro, the restaurant GM. He was very nasty over the phone and didn't apologize once. I told him that I was aware that someone else at another table got food poison and Alejandro explained that it had nothing to do with me because that person ate something different. I still don't understand how he thought his response was acceptable. I called back several times and no one seems to be able to help make it right. While we can afford to spend almost $400 for 2 people in one sitting, it's not fun to spend that much money to get sick and treated like we didn't belong. It's been a couple of weeks since and I'm still really upset due to the way I was talked down to by Alejandro. I won't be going back as I'd rather spend my $400 elsewhere and be treated kindly.

In fact, without knowing about her allergy she warned the table that one of the nights specials had nuts and could be problematic to those with allergies. At desert time she had already checked with the kitchen to see what would be safe for our daughter. My daughter was thrilled she could order desert without worry.  In case you are wondering sorbet and the beignet's were our selection.Also, my son's steak was a bit under-cooked.

I would have been satisfied with two ordered of the tacos . The stake that I ordered was very expensive and I was expecting it to blow my mind. Instead it left me unsatisfied and disappointed .   It wasn't cooked the way I asked and the flavors and texture were off. My boss ordered a glass of wine and sent it back because the glass had a musty smell. He was also disappointed with his meal. The service was mediocre. Again, it could just have been that my expectations for this place were way too high. Moral of this review: you can't always believe what reviews say.

5.0,12/22/2016,"I'm posting this review later than I'd normally do, due to a very hectic travel schedule. So, apologies in advance if it's a bit less specific and organized than my other reviews.I'll start by saying that this restaurant is very large and nicely laid out and appointed. In particular the 'wine hallway' that runs thru the quasi-center of the restaurant is absolutely stunning.We dined here for dinner, this past Monday, during a packed house, with a party size of six. Service was good and attentive.The food was very good overall. I thoroughly enjoyed the mushroom soup, which had excellent flavor, aroma, and unique texture and viscosity. I could have gone for another bowl, to be honest.The myriad of starters, including the fries, sushi, salmon, etc., were all thoughtfully plated and tasty.For my entree, I opted to go ""vegetarian"", with linguini, caper, olive, and lemon oil. It, too, was quite good.For dessert, the table ordered a good cross-section from the dessert menu. My favorites were the banana-centric dessert, and the coconut sorbet, respectively (the latter of which is the best of its kind I've ever had).Overall, a wonderful meal and dining experience. Will most certainly recommend and return.(NOTE: The photos being posted come from various members of my dining party, and don't necessarily include all of the specific items noted in this review.)",7,0,3,James A.,"Laguna Beach, CA",1102,133,1027
3.0,12/21/2016,"This high end kosher steakhouse in the heart of the financial district serves good but unremarkable kosher steakhouse fare (sushi and steaks).  The menu is somewhat limited and the portions are tiny for the exorbitant prices they charge.  It simply does not compare to the food at other top tier steakhouses.  Service was friendly and professional.  The place is stunning and clubby.  Bottom line: not enough bang for your buck.  Beware automatic service charge for large parties and the check still had a ""tip"" line.",2,0,0,Adam R.,"New York, NY",1,62,30
1.0,12/21/2016,Went to Reserve Cut for a Board dinner.   Short Rib tacos were a good appetizer but the meal went downhill very quickly.   Had to remind waiters to get additional wine repeatedly before any action.  The steak does not compare al all to quality steak from Peter Lugers or The Palm.  Sides came 10 minutes after the entrees were served.  Wait staff often looked confused.,0,0,0,James P.,"Rye, NY",0,13,0

5.0,10/20/2016,"I've been eating at kosher (and, once upon a time, non-kosher) steakhouses in Manhattan for over twenty years with my family and I have to say this might be the best one of all time. We went for a birthday dinner and it was worth the price. My brother got some kind of tuna appetizer which he said was amazing. My mom got a salad which was only ""pretty good"" and had some weird spices she didn't like, but everything that came after that was tops. The boneless ribeye my brother and sister-and-law got were both top of the line. The fries might have been the best fries I've ever eaten, and the green beans were DEFINITELY the best green beans I've ever eaten with a sweet chili sauce.Yes, I did go for the wagyu 20 oz steak (on the bone) and split it with my mom, and it was totally worth it, even for $100. Split two ways meant it was comparable price to the other single-serving steaks, but it was not just a steak. It was an experience. The VP of Operations came over and explained what was special about the Japanese breed of cows and how they were raised to get that unique flavor (they give the cows lots of beer). There were three sauces served on the side with someone's dish but we didn't need them because that's how good the steak was. No salting, no pepper, no sauce. The meat was its own flavor. This might be the best steak I've ever eaten, and I used to date a steak chef, so I'm going to be safe and say it's in the top 3.  The wine menu is standard New York pricey but very extensive for a kosher place, and the waiter was very knowledgeable in wines. There were a lot of non-Jews or less religious Jews eating there, which is the sign of great kosher restaurant. If people who are not glatt kosher are willing to pay those prices, there's a reason. There were at least four birthdays just in the room we were in, so I assume this is the place people go to splurge, and with good reason. If you're going to do a nice dinner out, this is the place to go.",3,2,2,Dj C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0

1.0,9/19/2016,"A pleasant evening with acceptably tasty food was marred by a deceptive business practice that borders on geneiva (halachic theft). Our server was friendly and prompt, the menu varied, and the quality of the food was fine (if a bit expensive). I don't believe it said on the menu that a 20% service fee would be added to the bill (maybe it did), but I'm OK in theory that a party our large (we were eight) would have a mandatory service fee. Twenty percent is the highest I've ever seen, but if there was a heads-up (I didn't see one, but there may have been) at least I was warned.So I asked for the check, which was $1,000 including the $200 service fee - which I happened to notice but very well may not have. I gave my credit card and the credit card receipt returned with a place to put the tip - even though I already paid the tip. It didn't have a line through it (as the wonderful Chops Resto Bar in Montreal handles it). It didn't say ""additional tip."" Their system leaves the strong impression that no tip has been given. Had I not paid close enough attention, I'd be out another $200 or more because of Reserve Cut's deceptive practices!When I spoke with the manager, his lies and obfuscations infuriated me. He said my server was supposed to orally tell me, and he just forgot. Poppycock. I've checked with others, and it appears they only say that when they get caught. He also said it's not their fault because ""the computer prints out the bill that way."" Sorry, but this isn't 1991, when that would be an acceptable excuse. In 2016, if you don't like what your printout says, you call your tech guy, he spends 20 minutes on it, and it's fixed.I spoke to the kashrus division of the Orthodox Union this morning, and to my delight they were even more incensed than I am, since their organization's name is on the restaurant attesting to its ""kosher"" (proper) status. He is going to talk to to the manager of Reserve Cut, and insist they either change the way they handle mandatory tipping - or he's going to have the hechsher pulled.Until that works itself through, can I suggest Wolf and Lamb, Le Marais, Prime Grill, or Mike's Bistro? All are excellent choices if you want fine kosher dining in Manhattan.",12,4,1,David B.,"Saint Louis, MO",84,7,0

5.0,1/19/2016,"Went here a year ago on a date with my now husband. Sat at the bar because we were early for dinner service. Ordered a beer and two glasses of wine. Bar bill was almost $60 including tips. ""Some restaurateurs believe they can get away with high markups because their customers won't notice or complain,"" writes WSJ wine critic Lettie Teague in an article about wine prices. The Dalton Moscato I had is priced $12 retail, but RC charges $13 a glass. When being seated, we passed by a very pretty water pond and a party room fir for a king. I think EVERY detail in this establishment was carefully considered down to the blinds (being that it's Wall Street, there is no view, and the blinds testify this). The sushi we got was okay (but others may like the sun dried part--not my taste though), but the steak, a RC Filet Minon, was delicious and memorable. French fries were good, but pricey. Because we spent so much on the food (i.e. beyond our budget, but very worth it for those who can afford), we wanted to get our money's worth, and decided to relax on the couch in the front of the restaurant. We did so for about two hours and didn't feel uncomfortable at all. RC's decor is unparalleled, and it's the primary reason we loved our time at the restaurant. The staff and waiters were extremely nice and pleasant to deal with. I don't recall any other restaurant I've ever been to providing such great service.

We were placed at a round table for 10, and we were 5 people. We could barely hear each other speak over the noise, and they would not move us to a smaller table (the Asian hostess did not care at all).  The waiter, as I said before, was extremely pushy and rude. Three of us did not want to order individual steaks on top of the appetizers, so we decided to split a large steak. The waiter kept repeating to  us we weren't ordering enough food to be satisfied (9 appetizers and 3 steaks for 5 people is quite adequate). The first time he mentioned it, I thought, fine thanks for letting us know; after the third time it was downright annoying.  We ordered close to $1,000.00 worth of food, which was presented to us in a rushed, sloppy fashion, as if they were doing us a favor. One of the bus boys was cleaning up so quickly he dropped food on my husband's shirt.  So, as fancy as this place claims to be, and despite their showy decor and ""aged"" beef, their staff is completely unprofessional.  I've been to restaurants all over the world, in all price ranges, and this place is among the worst in terms of service.  Thanks for ruining our experience, Reserve Cut.

Simply put, that was the best steak I ever had; flavor, marble, texture and char were perfect. However since that first wonderful experience, my returns there did not exactly match up. The Reserve cut prime aged burger was disappointingly below average but their Bahn Mi sandwich (not currently on the menu) was pretty decent. Last night, I ordered the Apple Smoked Short Rib Tacos, the Forest Mushroom Risotto, Wagyu Beef Rib Steak and the Snicker Bar. ASSRT were ok, not bad but definitely not great and nothing special. FMR was below average, I've had better risottos in pizzerias (Benny's Pizza in Brooklyn is one that comes to mind). Although the WBRS is significantly more expensive than the Cote de Boeuf, it was significantly worse - the meat was waterlogged, with little flavor, no marble to speak of (all fat near the bone) and the worst part was that it was chewy.  Last night's saving grace was definitely the Snicker Bar which was a lot better than expected after having been underwhelmed until that point. The service was also pretty decent.I give this restaurant two stars because it is a high end restaurant with a menu that has too many miss items and not enough hit items.",1,1,0,Nosson A.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,2,1

2.0,12/15/2015,"Someone spend a lot of scratch opening this restaurant. Huge layout, great ambiance. Looks like a museum.  For an expensive hotel restaurant, the food is what you expect. for a steak place in NYC, the food is totally fugazi. This is clearly meant to be a high-end lunch spot for downtown corporates. If it's not lunch and work amex isn't paying, then move on.We ordered the $20 arugula salad and $22 scottish salmon tartar to start. I housed the salmon. It was ok- smaller portion than i expected but it's hard to really judge a tartar app. The salad - $20- had too much dressing on it. I like my dressing, but this was way too much. Clearly a psychopath in the kitchen was manning the dressing station. ""oh another order of arugula salad? here's 5 ladles of dressing. thanks bye""For our mains, we ordered the $61 filet mignon and the $65 peppercorn rubbed prime reserve cut. The filet was ordered medium-rare and came out medium. The prime reserve cut was ordered medium and came out medium-well, although I will say that they did an A+ job with the peppercorn rub. Didn't matter though - overcooked. Did the insane salad dressing captain also man the grill? ""one filet and one reserve cut? got it - throw dem slabs in the oven, i'm going to have a smoke"" I've been to a thousand steak places in nyc and maybe 1 time the steaks were overcooked. How do you charge $100 a steak then overcook it? I could have bought 2 of those new kindle fire things for the price of these fresh direct steaks. I would waterproof one of the kindles and throw it in the shower. Boom- music, videos (get your mind out of the gutter. just joking, yes those kinds of videos), maybe i'll place a seamless order so its at my door when i get out- genius move. The other kindle i'd use for a coaster on my coffee table- who needs 2 kindles? I bet the dressing captain has 4 or 5 of them.",1,2,1,Stefan R.,"New York, NY",0,5,0
4.0,12/10/2015,"I used to walk past this restaurant but didn't know it existed. Its hidden on the 2nd floor of a building, the building next to it has Crumbs on the first floor, which I always see.I decided to venture here for lunch one day. The restaurant was beautiful. We walked through a glass wine cellar lit with candles, to our table, which was situated next to the glass kitchen. I felt like I was watching an episode of Master Chef, but there was no Gordon Ramsay in the kitchen to scream at the chefs.We started off with the warm bread of course. I liked the fact that it was warm. There was oil and vinegar on the table. But I wanted butter. I asked the waiter for butter and he said that it was not Kosher and offered margarine instead. I didn't know that butter was not Kosher, I must have looked so stupid.There is actually a decently priced prie fixe menu for lunch for $40 - you get an appetizer, main course and desert. I had the endive salad for my appetizer. I gotta say that the endive is a really bitter vegetable. You can also get sushi for your appetizer but its really not fancy, you can choose from a few selections such as the spicy salmon roll.For my main course, I had short ribs and beans. The short rib was AMAZING. It was so tender, I didn't even use my knife. The others had chirashi sushi for their main, which looked ok. It was weird seeing chirashi sushi served on a huge white plate instead of the traditional sushi box. Even weirder to watch my friend eat it with a fork. I had the sorbet for desert. You get 3 scoops- mango, raspberry and strawberry. Since the waiter didn't tell us the flavor before hand, it was a fun guessing game. Unfortunately, I despise raspberry so I didn't eat it. I love mango but it was so so tart. I honestly think it was soursop or some exotic fruit and not mango. Plus there were tiny little black seeds in it... The strawberry was delicious, and probably the most ""normal"" flavor to me.The service here is excellent, it does get crowded during lunch. Its also a great place to get both Asian and Western food.

2.0,11/25/2015,"Was excited to go out and enjoy a steak with my son after an uncomfortable Dr.'s appt .  Based on reviews on yelp we chose this restaurant. Firstly, it was confusing as to where it was located. Then, the doorman who was sitting and talking on his cell phone summoned us as we approached the elevator, asking where we were going, after we were already told where it was by someone that worked in the building. Perhaps if he was standing and not talking on his cell phone we would have given him the respect he seemed to be asking for. Once we arrived we  were not greeted in the nicest manner, in fact I was looked up and down (I wasn't wearing the nicest jacket as I just threw on the warmest thing I had running into the city on a cold night) . Once seated and looking at the menu and seeing the prices I realized why I was  looked at the way she did , apparently she was judging me and my ability to pay I'm guessing. Should have left at that point. However, we stayed put thinking the food would be delicious based on the yelp reviews and ordered a few appetizers and a glass of wine, all overpriced. Ordered the RC steak recommended by waitress.  It was average at best. Sides were ok also way overpriced. I have had the fortune to enjoy some delicious food in the city have to say I would not return here or recommend it to anyone. The food was mediocre at best and the prices ridiculous.

5.0,8/13/2015,"Reserve cut is one of the few kosher restaurants in Manhattan to emulate a European gastronomical experience. A fusion of classic Western and Asian cuisines, the restaurant offers one of the most incredible glatt kosher meats in New York. The ribeye steak (bone-in) of Wagyu beef is the best one in the menu, my favorite. It comes with a great side of bone marrow, perfectly prepared. Unfortunately, the chef has overcooked my ribeye steaks every time I have been there.Besides the meat, the restaurant offers an amazing kosher wine cellar, although it seems to lack any of the great Spanish kosher wines. I assume they avoid them because they are not mevushal--Spanish producers have a common-sense aversion to mevushal. I checked the wine menu, and all wines served at Reserve Cut are mevushal.The ambiance of the restaurant matches the quality of the food. Decoration is modern, stylish, fancy; luxurious. Location is incredible. I regret the rudeness of the service. Waiters and maître have no idea how to serve a restaurant of this quality. They need to learn from Europe and, certainly, the restaurants that Reserve Cut wants to emulate.Despite these objections, to this date, the restaurant is the best option for a gastronomical experience in kosher New York. Reserve Cut is excellent for every occasion: either business lunches or romantic dinners. We celebrate my wife's birthday last May.And prepare your wallet. Like most kosher restaurants in Manhattan, Reserve Cut is painfully overpriced. Yet, worth of it.",3,0,1,Boaz V.,"New York, NY",7,14,6

I'm typically a little put off by places that feature in drastically drastically different food (steak and sushi? huh.), but we ended up being pretty impressed.* RC Moonshine (cocktail) -- definitely could taste the vanilla. I liked it overall, and it was generally well balanced, although it ended a little sweet!* RC rolls -- we ordered two for the table and I definitely could not tell you which, but they were good. Would not have an entire meal of just the sushi, though!* Steak tartare -- maybe not the best choice to order this one but I love steak tartare. It was good but not exceptional.* Short rib tacos -- very flavorful. Generally a bit on the small side but about the right size given how intense these are. Would recommend.* Delmonico steak (special) -- absolutely wonderful. But also is VERY large. And thick. Probably didn't help that our group ordered many appetizers, but only one person was able to fully finish this (he actually demolished it very quickly-- which was impressive in itself). I'd definitely get this again. The sauce (bearnaise?) was delicious.I did not have any dessert myself but the sorbet was well received. RC's decor (through the walkway at least) is a bit reminiscent of Vegas, and was overall quite nice. The waiters were very attentive and I have no complaints there. The only issue was a potential mix-up in steaks -- one colleague seems to have gotten something a bit more cooked than he would've preferred.

It was very small and thin to begin with an on top of that half was inedible due to all the fibers. Literally threw it out. Spinach side dish was tasteless.  Raspberry creme brûlée was pretty good.

The only negatives:  two people ordered the fish special and were unable to eat it.  Most of the dining areas had loud music playing, which can destroy your appetite, although that seems to be an epidemic that afflicts all retail establishments today.  (I refuse to shop in stores that play loud music.)  Fortunately, we were able to get it turned off in the room where our party was located.  Parking could be a problem- (especially at lunch time).  Discount parking available in the evenings.  (Good time to use Uber?)

I ordered the Cote De Bouef cooked ""Black and Blue"" which was supposed to be just seared for a few seconds on each side (rarer than rare) but it came out medium. They did the same thing to everyone else at the table.- My steak tasted like it had an entire container of salt poured on it. I actually love salt and I've never complained about eating too much salt EVER in my entire life. That is how much salt was on my steak.Pros- I will say that the service was very good in the bar area before dinner and at the table.- Ambiance was also pretty good- The appetizers were very good - short rib tacos were awesome!Overall though, I would never ever come back here. If I weren't with coworkers and customers I would have sent back all my food (I've never done that before).When you charge top dollar for steak, it needs to be cooked EXACTLY how you ordered it.

The kale salad was tasty, but that's as good as it got. There was a half-hour delay between our appetizers and entrees. Maybe that's why the Chilean sea bass was dry, bland and room temperature.

I had to order a soda three times and it was only until my last attempt that they finally brought it to the table. Also, a friend ordered the steak sandwich and they brought a steak salad instead, and when my friend told the waiter that his order was wrong she got mad, gave him a bad look and started giving a long explanation about his order taking a longer time to get made all over from scratch because of the miscommunication, almost blaming him for what happened.All the time that we were there the service was unattentive, unwelcoming and messy.Overall the quality of the food is not good. I think they do a great job with the appetizers, but the main entrees are nothing special. My meat was overcooked and I had ordered medium rare, it was a big cut of tasteless rib eye.

1.0,1/5/2015,"The really attractive bar/waiting area, leading to the first seating area had music a bit too loud for conversation, so we asked for a quieter spot. We were led to the rear, near the kitchen, which was quieter.  A big plus:  the table for four was generously sized - a rarity.  Our waiter was all smiles and friendly suggestions, until he realized none of us wanted wine or cocktails to start.  His body language tightened up (really!), he snatched up the wine glasses (really foolish, since we probably would have ordered wine with our entrees) and stalked away.  The marrow appetizer arrived pretty much raw - disgusting.  We all ordered meat - Wagu burger, two Reserve Cuts, and a steak.  The burger had pate on top that went unpleasantly with the meat, which was nothing special, although the fries were perfect.  The Reserve Cut was pretty good.  Best dessert was the beignets, although the tiny balls (perfectly fried) were misnamed.  The prices are ridiculous, even for a Kosher steakhouse - $98 for a bone-in ribeye (approx. 12 oz. of meat)!  Turns out the many sushi and sashimi offerings would have been much better, I'm told.  House was packed so obviously it's popular - but to accommodate extra patrons, staff kept rolling round wooden tabletops past our table, and one diner almost got hit with a chair being lofted overhead.  Our waiter hardly bothered to appear for the check, keeping us waiting almost 15 minutes.  I never want to see this place again.",0,0,0,Mary G.,"New York, NY",0,9,3

So disappointed and i moved to the lunch menu. King salmon sashimi is ok as every street Japanese restaurant can offer. The Downtown burger claimed to be made out of aged Angus filet mignon is juicy but shockingly not tasty at all. Salt and too much spice overtook all beef flavor. I prefer to have a $7 ShakeShack burger which will be way better.   The flavorless burger here will charge u $29 instead. The fries and dessert are just fine.

So we're talking of about $800 or more (I didn't pay so can't say exact price).Appetizers :- some were a bit salty but that can be just my tastes- co worker was enjoying a risotto (appetizer) when waiter comes by and just takes it- didn't ask or anything. she commented on this to the table and seemed saddened by this.Main :- i had the COTE DE BOEUF // $68 and found it lukewarm. Everything about that dish was lukewarm, the steak, the sauce, the bone marrow... real bummer. The steak was also veiny and tough. - through out the meal there was constant activity by the wait staff. my chair got bumped a few times as they walked by but never an apology. it's distracting when you're trying to enjoy your meal & company when your chair keeps getting bumped.- when wait staff was taking plates away and placing new plates, i had to move my whole body so they could.Desert :- had the cheese cake and espresso. they can't make espresso to save their lives, the cheese cake was good.TL,DRFor the price, the steaks & more importantly the service is mediocre.

From the tomato soup to the ribs to the tacos (unreal) to the perfectly prepared steak which melts in your mouth to the savory raspberry creme brulee to finish off the night. ""Off the charts"" wouldnt do justice to describe the service.   Honestly,  probably the best service i've ever experienced at a restaurant in my life. From the personality of our waiter to the timeliness of each course, we were made to feel like we were the only ones in the entire restaurant, yet every table was taken.

I went with my mom and 8 month old daughter.  Reserve Cut seems to be more for couples celebrating special occasions or business workers enjoying a nice meal but the atmosphere worked well for my family too.  The Tables are huge!  I must point this out because a lot of fine dining places have small tables, only enough for your plate.  But here, I didn't seem to scramble to move my cup of water or my glass of wine or organize the bread basket when the appetizers/entree came.  I felt royal sitting at my table since the magnificent wine bottle display was right before us.  The decor, again, was amazing!Service: simply impeccable.  We made reservations for 3 and were seated right away.  On yelp it says the place is not good for kids, and again it would seem that way but I was offered a high chair for my little one and felt like a super star since all the staff gawked at 'how cute' she was.  They all chatted with us and especially her.  She of course loved the attention.  Our glasses was always filled.  Bread was immediately placed on the table. We were constantly asked if everything was ok.  Warm smiles everywhere.Food: I love dining at kosher restaurants and very critical of the food I eat.  Here the food was delectable.  The bread placed before us was very tasty.  My mom especially liked the raisin bread.  I liked the plain, my daughter liked both lol.  I ordered cote de beouf my mom ordered the prime rib.  The flavor was on point for both... Mine was better.  It was cooked exactly as requested and the presentation was picture worthy... Too bad my battery died.Price:  very expensive.  If your like my mom, who loves to get the most out of her buck, you might feel a bit intimidated by the prices.  But I'm the type who doesn't mind spending a lot on an experience, as long as it's good and worth it, and I would say this place gave it.  But, again very expensive and if your looking to splurge, why not here.  We both didn't complain, and my husband tells me I do that a lot anyway.I can't wait to return to bring the hubby.",4,1,0,Monet G.,"Teaneck, NJ",0,3,1

The salad appetizers ( we tried 2) were nothing special at all and not particularly tasty and did not justify their high prices. The volcano sushi was excellent.  All six entrees were absolutely delicious - the veal and steaks cooked to perfection.  The Apple Cobbler and Peanut Butter Mousse for dessert were so-so.2. We arrived at 6pm so the restaurant, whose decor is lovely, was quiet.

Wonderful wine selection, the prices tend to be on the higher end. I think the red wine by the bottle starts around $58. We had a reservation on a Thursday night and were seated promptly after arrival (coat check available during the winter). They offer sushi and other seafood items, but I don't expect them to have the best sashimi, since their specialty is steak. I had the wagyu sliders as appetizer (very flavorful and juicy) which came with taters (a nice surprise). I like very lean meat, without fat and I ordered the ""plain vanilla"" filet mignon. My food was tasty and good, but I wouldn't consider it the greatest steak I've ever head.

Wagyu carpaccio was bland. Crispy rice with spicy tuna was as good as your local discount sushi place. Veal chop was OK, but nothing special. Steaks were bad to mediocre. As mentioned, a few were the wrong doneness and had to be sent back. All the food and drinks are overpriced. Even at half the price I wouldn't think it was a good value.

5.0,11/8/2013,We went here without making reservations and the manager Ghandi Kimia got us a table and made sure even though it was a packed nigh that we were completely satisfied  the food was amazing a bit expensive but over all 10/10,1,0,2,Justin C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,2,0

5.0,11/7/2013,"I went here last night with 6 of my non-kosher-keeping colleagues. What a breath of fresh air for the kosher-keeping community, and for the NYC steak-eating community in general!!We were all thoroughly impressed by the decor and ambiance. This restaurant is one of the most upscale-looking and classy restaurants in the city - period - regardless of kosher/non-kosher. Walking to your table through the all glass wine cellar with a candle-lit water piece in the middle was a great experience that really impressed all of us!In terms of the service, our waiter was great. He had an excellent personality and offered suggestions. He was also attentive. They also have a group of servers who just refill water and wine glasses so my glasses were never empty.The food was equally as excellent. We started off with the Crispy Rice which I highly recommend - I wish we had ordered more of it because it was so delicious! We also had the volcano roll which was very good. There was also a salad that I didn't get to try but my coworkers were raving about it.For the main course, one of my coworkers and I shared the Bone-In Wagyu Beef Rib Steak. It was absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicious. We also tried several side items, my personal favorite was the Baked Black Truffle Mushrooms Potato - I wish I had one entirely for myself!!By the end of the night, my coworkers and I were all very happy patrons. My coworkers were actually thanking me for making the suggestion of this restaurant because they all loved it and would go back even without kosher-keeping guests!I hope Reserve Cut does well so that I can continue to have this amazing kosher option. 5-stars all around!My only complaint? I do have one gluten-free coworker (because she has Celiac, not because she's riding the gluten-free trendy wave) and she was very limited in what she could order. I hope they will improve on this for their future patrons (they've only been open about 5 weeks so they're still tweaking the menu). This isn't to say that she couldn't eat anything or left hungry, as she definitely was able to eat some things and REALLY enjoyed her branzino dish, but I was sad that she was limited on side items and appetizers. So, you can still go here if you're gluten-free, just be aware that it will be pretty limited.",10,2,3,Jen R.,"Chapel Hill, NC",78,134,2
3.0,11/5/2013,"Went there on what I was told was their busiest night since their opening, a Thursday night. Even though we had a reservation they made us wait about 20 mins at the bar .... Be careful when you order a drink, a shot of whiskey was $23, a mojito $16 ...just so you get an idea. Food is not much cheaper but at least is good, sushi was great, meat carpaccio was great, steak champignon pretty good too.The best part of our meal was our waiter: Francisco, he was entertaining, polite, his suggestions were great, just a great waiter who knows his job.I took 1 star off because the prices are just ridiculous, even for a kosher restaurant!Update:Went another few times since my review and the food was not as good, each time I said I was not going to go back, but gave it another chance and it disappointed me again.The first time we had a great waiter (Francisco) ho made the difference, he told us what to order, I believe he was fired, which is a pity as he was the best waiter I have ever met.",1,0,0,S L.,"New York, NY",0,52,0
5.0,11/4/2013,"This place is amazing. It's hard to say worth the money, because eating at a fancy steak place is hardly economic. But if you are going to splurge, then it's worth the extra money to splurge here. First of all the atmosphere and decor is amazing, beautiful, sleek and classy.Secondly, the service is impeccable. Every time I tried to whisper to my partner about how fantastic the service is, someone else popped up and did something else for me.Thirdly, the food. Oh my god the food. The salad was on the small side, but the steak was one of the most incredible tasting steaks I've ever had.Filling up my piggy bank now for a round two.",2,1,2,T S.,"Manhattan, NY",450,8,0
5.0,10/19/2013,"The greatest filet mignon I've had so far. This restaurant combined great food and great service along with wonderful decor and ambiance. I had a ""Sweet Life"" aka Strawberry Mojito which was smooth yet tasty. I recommend the Cote de Boeuf or the RC Filet Mignon. These steaks just melt in your mouth. Definitely a must try!",2,0,2,Lola N.,"Bronx, NY",20,23,15
5.0,10/16/2013,"The finer Kosher steakhouses in NYC all do a pretty good job with their steaks. Sure, some are cooked imperfectly and some are over-seasoned, but they all deliver a good product. Reserve Cut  might just be a few notches above the rest though and while I have only been there once (so far) they are my new favorite Kosher restaurant.I was having dinner with two old friends and we started at the bar where Patrice (I am totally screwing up the spelling, sorry) was extremely attentive and helpful. We then sat down for dinner where Monique explained everything on the menu with attention to detail and honesty.We started with RC Crispy Rice and a sashimi platter. The fish was fresh and presentation was beautiful. For an entree I had the Angus Filet Au Champignon which was 12 ounces of heaven along with a side of baked black truffle potato. For dessert  I had the peanut butter mousse.  My friends and I left the restaurant feeling extremely satisfied without being over stuffed as is often the case in restaurants that load you up with bread and potatoes! The service was amazing, the food was cooked to perfection. The decor was beautiful. I usually have at least one negative comment to give but the overall experience was nothing short of perfect. I highly recommend.",3,0,0,Joseph L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0
5.0,10/10/2013,"What a great Kosher gem! This is by far the best combination of overall taste, ambiance, and service the kosher food scene has seen in a long time. The service is impeccable. The food is elegant and creative.although lacking a drop in seasoning throughout the meal, we were very pleased with the quality and presentation of the food. A bit pricey at about $50 an entree, but the restaurant is so fun and upscale we were ok with that. I'd recommend the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio as an appetizer, the Wasabi Encrusted Rack of Lamb for main, and the Peanut Butter Mousse for dessert. Delist.Will def go back on a special occasion.",5,0,2,Robert K.,"Baltimore, MD",0,6,0
