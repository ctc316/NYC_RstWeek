5.0,4/28/2019,This place has the cutest vibes! You go downstairs to a lobby area that is so well decorated and the restaurant in further in the back. We tried the olive oil pancakes and the eggs Benedict. Both were really filling. The pancakes were fluffy and not too sweet. The eggs Benedict was well made and came with potatoes and a light salad. Both were around $15. The great atmosphere and good food make this place really enjoyable,2,2,4,Enya G.,"Edison, NJ",621,112,120
5.0,4/26/2019,"What a quaint find in Greenwich. The ambience was comfy, yet classy. They offer a hand crafted menu, locally sourced by the Executive Chef himself. The portions are perfect. The presentation is spot on. The service was timely and sincere. I would tell you how good the food is, but you honestly have to check it out for yourself.

3.0,2/11/2019,"The food was excellent, I'll start with that, and the ambience is lovely. But the service was wildly uneven. We got off to a not-great start when trying to check in for our reservation, which the host could not locate. She walked away to purportedly look further into it--and never came back, leaving us standing there for about ten minutes until a different host finally approached. When we explained what happened, the second host--who was pleasant and helpful--told us the first host had begun making coffee. (I was slightly bummed to be considered less compelling than making coffee, a task I don't enjoy.) Anyway, our brunch dishes were delicious, but our waiter did not return after serving them to see if we wanted dessert--we did--or to give us our check, which we had to get up and request from the host after waiting and waiting. The waiter did take something off our bill to help make up for this, but all the same, I can't imagine I'd bother going back; NYC has way too many brunch spots to justify being ignored like this.",0,0,0,Teresa T.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,77,1

1.0,1/22/2019,"If your only dining requirement is exquisite woodwork and interior decor than this is the place for you.  Beautiful molding? Check. Coffered ceiling? Check. Cozy fireplace with built in wood storage? Skylight with hanging greenery?  Check and check.If however, you frequent restaurants with food, service and cost in mind then I would strongly recommend moving right along. In three different dining experiences (l know, long story) during a stay at the Hotel Walker my group left with disappointments ranging from modest to never again. The staff seems poorly trained at best. But who knows, maybe refilling your own drinks and walking up to the bar to finally get your check is in vogue these days?  I'm always behind with these things. After joining others in our group at breakfast, two of us decided to not eat breakfast rather than deal with this place.   Long story short: prices are ridiculous (3 coffees, 2 eggs and one waffle was $50. Fifty dollars for eggs, coffee and a waffle!) and the service is non-existent.  Murray's Bagels is around the corner. Save the time and stress.",3,3,1,Argyle1 S.,"Pawtucket, RI",1,33,0

4.0,12/30/2018,"A+ on setting. What a cozy, charming place to be. A gem of a find. We sat in the lobby by the fireplace with live jazz in the background. Perfect wintertime spot. Warm and professional service to go with the atmosphere, paired with good wine and well-done cocktails. While the truffle mushroom whole wheat pizza was quite good, it feels that the menu is a bit lacking, and more so as vegetarians (partly the reason we didn't stay for a full dinner). Pizza and pasta are nice, and while I'm sure the latter is executed deliciously, this seems like a special place that should have an even more special menu. Nevertheless, I see Society Cafe becoming a favorite specifically because of its wonderful setting and service. We'll be back. Perhaps for brunch.

I chose this place because I could make a reservation and it seemed fancy for a fun time. The service was WONDERFUL. The florentine was delicious as was the iced latte I ordered. The chicken and waffles dish was a little jarring. It's brought out like a sandwich with pickles and a lot of sauce inside, no syrup. So if you're in the mood for something more traditional either don't order it or ask for it deconstructed. The chicken was not necessarily standard fried chicken, it was more like a chicken cutlet -- good but different. The waffle was fluffy but got soggy with the sauce. The parmesan fries were decent, but a small portion for the $8 side you paid for. I would come back, but probably order something else.",0,0,0,Sarah B.,"New York, NY",103,159,40

We all opted for various entrees, including the chicken and waffles, salad, and quiche. I had the avocado toast which I really enjoyed. The egg was nicely poached and the bread was crusty and delicious. It came with a small side of potatoes which were also tasty and was the perfect complement to the toast.

4.0,10/15/2018,"This spot is located inside the Walker Hotel Greenwich Village, tucked away in the back. It is almost hidden. The lobby of the hotel was a few steps down from the street. It was very nice, laid back and relaxing atmosphere with a fireplace. The restaurant entrance is to the left, through the narrow hallway passed the book shelves.There was supposed to be someone at the front, right by the narrow hallway at the host/hostess section. But, we didn't see anyone, so we walked into the restaurant. As soon as we got inside the restaurant, a staff came over and assisted us. They had a full bar, pretty good size too.The restaurant was big, beautiful and very welcoming. Since we were there early, it was mostly empty. The restaurant had a skylight, bringing in lots of natural light, supported by lots of soft lights.The beautiful interior was not the only great thing that won us over. Their complimentary bread is not any ordinary bread. They brought us huge popovers that was warm and fluffy!We all got some cocktails to start, they were tasty, interesting, strong and sophisticated drinks. We got a couple of appetizers, Lobster Tater Tots and Short Rib Poutine. The tater tots were small both in size and portion, total of 7 tots in the plate... It was tasty, but didn't really get the lobster flavor, and wish if they had bigger portion.  Poutine was flavorful with good amount of ribs.For main, we had Brisket Burger, Sesame Crusted Yellowfin Tuna, and two of us got Atlantic Sea Scallops. They all looked pretty amazing, beautifully plated. My scallop was a bit too salty which was unfortunate, but the rest was quite tasty.At the end, we ordered Carrot Cake and Mascarpone Cheesecake to share. At the time of reservation, I told the restaurant that we are celebrating my friends' anniversary. I didn't ask for anything special, but they went ahead and decorated the cheesecake for the celebration which was really sweet!The service was warm and welcoming. They were polite and took a really good care of us. All the dishes were made with high quality ingredients, and we enjoyed them all.

2.0,9/25/2018,"Came for a friends birthday brunch for 3 on a saturday afternoon for 1pm but left disappointed. The hotel lobby was probably the best thing about the day because it made for great pictures.  We got in about 1255pm and were shown to our table and maybe 2 minutes later a waiter came by to get our order for drinks, felt like we were being rushed when we just got seated! When our waiter came back around we put in an order for a carafe of mimosa and food. My two friends opted for the olive oil pancakes and i opted for the brisket burger with no tomato and roasted potatoes as a side for the table to share. About 15 minutes later, the waiter comes to our table ask if we'd like to put our order in?! We were in no rush so we didnt mind that he may have forgotten but.. The food comes and i notice theres no bacon in my burger so i call the waiter over and he gets a piece in a separate plate, unapologetic, which then really got me upset because what we brought over was not thick cut as pictured in other people's images uploaded. Roasted potatoes lacked salt and when asked for salt, he again failed to deliver and we had to flag someone else down for it. Overall, the ambiance and decor is nice, theres a sunroof that beams in with plants hanging around, but other than that, not happy with the food or service at this place. Was expecting a lot more coming in to a place with 4 stars that claims to have locally sourced ingredients from the farmers.",1,0,0,Harv P.,"Franklin Square, NY",159,76,62

4.0,9/6/2018,"Between having colleagues dine at Society Café and reading its rave reviews, I was thrilled to see that it was participating in Restaurant Week...and with a delectable menu to boot!  The restaurant was located in the sultry Walker Hotel, hiding out behind the lobby, with walls adorned with bookshelves.  It was as glamourous and masculine as dining in a castle's library.  We were seated at a comfortable corner booth and presented with a heavenly basket of massive popovers topped with shredded cheese.  These sweet and flaky pastries were accompanied by a creamy and garlicky herb butter, making them even harder to resist.  I washed these airy rolls down with The Dixie Hummingbird cocktail, a spicy and sour concoction including Tromba Tequila Reposado, grapefruit, lime, jalapeño-honey, and celery bitters.  The pint glass-sized blend included a skewered slice of jalapeno as a daring garnish.My special, prix-fixe meal began with a generous portion of Squid Ink Cavatelli.  The black pasta was tossed with chorizo and topped with Calabrian chilis and a tomato gremolata.  The zesty sauce and unique noodles were delicious, but the sausage was tough and tasted more like a hot dog than anything else.  In fact, I had asked if it would be possible to replace the chorizo with some sort of vegetable (ie mushrooms), but was turned down and instead had to endure these chewy bites.  For my second course, I went with the Baked Atlantic Halibut, which was seasonally plated with local squash and fairytale eggplants, all on top of a citrusy yuzu yogurt.  The fish was cooked to perfection, but would have benefited from a pinch more salt.  Finally, my dessert was one of the most decadent and amazing in recent history!  Two pieces of fluffy chocolate cake were layered with two ribbons of peanut butter mousse.  A ""candy bar"" made of ice cream and crunchy morsels was served with the slice of cake, and dabs of salted caramel dotted the plate around them.  That Chocolate Peanut Butter Cake was a MUST order!Despite the lackluster chorizo, Society Café still knew how to execute a Restaurant Week menu without really sacrificing quality or flavor.  Being able to enjoy that terrific meal in such an elegant atmosphere was an added bonus.",7,2,6,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

5.0,8/4/2018,"I came here on a weekday with my little sister because it was raining outside and needed someplace to dry off. I was pleasantly surprised to discover this hidden gem of a hotel and restaurant. Anna the concierge directed us towards the restaurant at the back of the lobby where we were given a very spacious booth. My sister is very indecisive and our server Cici was super patient with her. After lengthy deliberation my sister ordered the spaghetti which was absolutely delicious. (pesto sauce, parmesan, and butter.) I opted for a signature cocktail, Kitten on the keys?? (I'm not sure of the name but there was vodka with grapefruit juice and I love vodka).  My sister got lost on her way to the bathroom (which is in the hotel basement) and wound up in an office of some sort. The restaurant manager I think her name was Lana or Leilana or Laney (sorry) helped her out. After I paid for the bill, the same manager came by with a plate of complimentary cookies. Which were all bomb. (Sampler pieces of carrot cake and chocolate cake from their dessert menu). Anyway, I would definitely recommend this place because not only is the food solid but the people who work here are super chill and nice. My sister and I spent 4 hours here just hanging out and chatting. When the restaurant got a little busier Cici very politely moved us from our booth to a smaller more intimate booth near the bar, but made sure to check on us every now and again to refresh drinks etc. I would definitely come back here again for the warm service and look forward to trying other items on the menu!",0,0,0,Lillian M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0

We did not get a bread basket nor did we see other tables with them (the one table that had them did not have any people at it and the basket was removed later). We tried the short rib poutine that wasn't on the restaurant week menu, it came out luke warm. The appetizers were good, I had the squid ink cavatelli. For the entree I got the skirt steak. It was cooked well and the fried balls of mashed potatoes were tasty but the dish was too salty. My friend got the halibut which was perfectly cooked, but lacked seasoning and once again came out luke warm. The desserts were decent, I tried the crispy lemon pies (half moon shaped fried pies with a lemon filling that tasted artificial to me, an unpleasant sour and too sweet) and it came out with the ice cream already half melted. The service left alot to be desired. The restaurant at it's busiest was half full, but the service was painfully slow. The dishes took awhile to come out and we had to ask for the check even though we were the last people in the restaurant and had finished our desserts (the plates were still on our table as no one had been by) 20min earlier.

2.0,7/1/2018,Really not sure why this place has such good reviews. This place was fine but nothing spectacular and honestly you can get better food for the price. The atmosphere was that of a diner so fine if you are into that? The main drawback was the subpar service. The waiter was not rude but not nice either. We had to ask multiple times for essentials like salt and pepper. It was okay but I would not recommend or go back.,0,0,0,Megan R.,"Chicago, IL",143,18,0
3.0,6/29/2018,"Breakfast at society cafe was decent. We got one prix fixe meal (juice, entree, and hot drink) with the olive oil pancakes as the main course and also ordered the mushroom omelette. The waiter forgot to bring the juice that came with the prix fixe and when I asked for it later, they were out. They offered a carrot juice instead, which was pretty good-light and refreshing-but very strongly carrot flavored. He brought coffee but never once came by to refill it. The olive oil pancakes were not bad but were nothing to write home about, cooked well but fairly bland. They came with fresh strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries, which were nice. The omelette was very good and came with toast, a side of potatoes (small but pleasant), and some greens. The worst part of the experience was the service. The waiter was in a hurry (although the place was mostly empty) and failed to come by our table throughout the meal. When we finally flagged him down, I asked for some jam for the toast but he had walked away before I even finished asking for it. I was going to ask for some ketchup for the potatoes as well, but he was gone before I could do so. So I asked for it when he came back with the jam and he let out a big sigh and rolled his eyes. When we were ready to leave, we couldn't find him so we flagged down another staff member to get out check. My partner went to the bathroom while the credit card was running. Our waiter then proceeded to hover beside our table to ask if we were ready to leave. I said we were waiting for our cards. A few minutes later he came back to ask if my friend was in the bathroom/coming back soon to sign his receipt because he (the waiter) was ""in a hurry to leave."" Overall, the food was pretty good and the service was mediocre.",0,0,0,Matt G.,"Elmhurst, IL",0,11,6

3.0,6/17/2018,"Dimly lit setting that made me feel like i was walking into an old-world university, a library or something like in Harry Potter. I stopped by for dinner and it was fairly empty for some reason. The complimentary bread basket consisted of popovers which were warm and tasty and came with an herb-infused butter that really made the popovers more incredible From the menu, started with the lobster tater tots, which sound interesting but actually were the most  disappointing part of the meal. Tiny tots, like the size of cheese balls, came out and tasted like fried potato balls- couldn't tell if there was lobster or flavoring besides the ketchup that accompanied it.Anyway the croque madame pizza was good because almost anything topped with egg is a winner in my book. In general I love pizza and this was good.The main dishes were decent. The descriptions sounded interesting but the actual execution was, unfortunately, not exciting. Tried the Atlantic Sea Scallops, which was simple and pleasant with a light but flavorful sauce. The Sesame Crusted Yellowfin Tuna tasted standard even with the bed of fried sticky rice underneath and the bok choy and emulsion sauce. Least favorite (but still better than the lobster tater tots experience) was the Colorado Lamb Loin. The spiced baby carrots were enjoyable though. Overall I would skip the mains, repeat a pizza and try the pastas if I returned. For dessert, got the carrot cake, one of my usual favorites for dessert. Also tried the chocolate cake dessert. I preferred the chocolate over the carrot cake here. It's a nice setting in a central neighborhood in the village. I sincerely hope the kitchen could consider updating its lobster tater tots to something similar to croquettes - add some cheese or cream and be a little more generous with the lobster to live up to its name.The mains could easily be replaced with new creations and I wouldn't miss them. Even though I didn't try any, I do have high hopes on the pastas. I really should try those next time so I could hopefully have more to praise.",0,0,0,Rose I.,"Manhattan, NY",105,441,3759

2.0,5/20/2018,"I celebrated my 21st birthday here. The SOLE reason this place gets 2 stars is because of its beautiful and spacious interior, and the restaurant's communication with me regarding changes to my reservation multiple times (it is so hard to plan dinners for large groups holy hell, but this place helped me a ton). It was actually surprising how easy it was to get a reservation here, but after eating here I can see why.Anyways, towards the end the server for my group of 11 was actually a bit inattentive. Perhaps she knew she was already getting that 18% gratuity?? She was nowhere to be seen when we needed the check. Also, the food takes FOREVER to come out.I ordered a bottle of prosecco for the table, and half of us ordered the steak. The others pizza and pasta. To my disappointment, my steak came out looking miserable. I was actually embarrassed to take a picture of my food at my birthday dinner because it was presented so sloppily! Also, I ordered medium well done steak and my boyfriend ordered medium - but his came out looking rare. We told our server and she apologized, saying she heard him say ""medium rare"" and offered to put it back on the grill. I'm sorry, but at a fine establishment at $50 per person, I don't think you should be offering to put pieces of steak back on the grill after it was your mistake. ""Medium rare"" sounds nothing like ""medium"".My expensive steak was nothing special. My friends' expensive pizzas were nothing special. Another friend got the lamb - nothing special. Avoid the ravioli at all costs: it tasted super weird and the inside was purple? All the dishes had tiny tiny portions. Everyone was still hungry afterwards.They brought out a dessert with a candle for me that my friends had requested, the Tres Leches which was in a giant chocolate marble that our server had poured hot liquid on. The whole thing crumbled to mush in seconds, I wasn't even able to get a photo. It tasted like mush too. And it wasn't complimentary either. $12 for one of the cringiest birthday desserts I've ever had at a restaurant in my life.The only good part about the meal was the complimentary popovers they serve in the beginning. They seem to have perfected their popover recipe. They didn't bring out enough in the beginning though, so two of my guests had to wait ten more minutes for them to bring out 2 more.

4.0,4/6/2018,"I don't think I even knew this place existed before today, but I'm so glad we found it.  It's in the basement level of Walker Hotel, and was really digging the ambience. It is rustic and comfortable yet slightly refined and modern.  I know what your thinking, hotel breakfast, it's either predictable and bland or overpriced and pretentious.  Luckily, none of them apply, apart from the price maybe.  It is expensive for brunch, but what you lose that day in your wallet, you more than make up for with a happy belly.  While much of the menu looks appetizing, we shared the waffles and pancakes with a side of roasted potatoes.  The portions are a little small, but the flavors were sooo good.  The olive oil pancakes were light and fluffy, subtly sweet, and reminded me of the funnel cakes I ate as a kid at the mall, but were by no means as greasy.  Additionally, the waffles were also excellent, served with a banana caramel and fig butter.  But for anyone that knows me, they know I can hardly ever pass on ordering some sort of potato accompaniment. And, in all honesty, these were by far the best sides I have ever eaten. Although the menu said ""roasted"" I am pretty sure they were fried, but that still wouldn't stop me from devouring these buttery, crisp, and perfectly seasoned potatoes.  Overall, this place is a great place to enjoy a fairly quiet meal, compared to the more bustling options in the area, in a relaxed setting, with decent service. The server disappeared for most of the meal and there were only a few tables occupied at the time. We did have trouble getting more coffee and water, but overall, I would definitely return, and try one of the more market fresh offerings.",0,0,0,Carmella C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,34,51
4.0,3/26/2018,"Came here on a Wednesday night at 6pm with a reservation. The restaurant is located downstairs, past the hotel lobby. The place was nearly empty and remained so the entire night, which was odd. Our waiter was extraordinary--seriously, the best service I've ever got. Sorry that cannot recall his name, he was in his early twenties, tall, dark curly hair. He went above and beyond with every single request. One of our guests was pregnant and couldn't eat anything that was unpasteurized. Our waiter checked in with the chefs, who called their suppliers to double check that everything that we ordered was indeed pasteurized. He spent the whole night attending to our every need, while being extremely warm and personable. Not overwhelming in any sense. A true gem! I'm not a fan of wine, but the bottle of white that we got was the best white I've ever had. It was the first or the second one on the wine menu. Our waiter recommended it. It was in the $50 price range. Grateful for that suggestion. The wine was perfectly chilled to bring out it's gentle yet flavorful taste. It disappeared very quickly. Highly recommend!For appetizers, we got the wild mushroom, marherita, and soppressata pizzas, market green salad and burrata. All three pizzas were tasty, but a bit on the dry size--would definitely benefit from more sauce. The wild mushroom was a table favorite--delicious mushrooms. Margerita was a bit underwhelming. Soppressata had plain cheese and tomatoes and not really worth ordering--go with something else.Market green salad--salad mix leaves with light vinaigrette and dry fruits. Plain and forgettable, but we got it just to have something 'green and healthy' on the table.Burrata was delicious. Came with tons of wild mushrooms. Definitely get this! So flavorful and with so many mushrooms, it's a pretty huge sized appetizer.For mains, got the Sesame Crusted Yellowfin Tuna ($33), which was artfully plated. The burst of colors and flavors was a definite surprise. The highlight of the dinner--highly recommend! Five slices of sesame crusted tuna, delicious veggies, coconut sauce reduction, and a bunch of other ingredients and flavors that I couldn't entirely identify. It was spectacular--still recall how perfect every single detail on that plate was. That rare case when the composition is just perfect and you wouldn't add or subtract a single thing.A side of roasted brussels ($10) was perfectly golden, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and magnificently seasoned. Recommend this treat. All brussel sprout lovers will bite their tongues over this deliciousness.Hanger steak ($32): hearty portion that you'll take home to finish. Didn't taste, but heard delicious feedback from across the table.Ravioli: come in two portion sizes ($16) ($27). The small portion was pretty big (can't imagine what the $27 plate would look like)! After appetizers, both women who ordered the $16 portion couldn't finish the pasta, so got the leftovers to go.For dessert, we got the flourless chocolate cake to share. It was a brick of chocolatey richness! Came with a scoop of chocolate ice cream and whipped cream. Refreshing balance to the intense decadence of the heavy & filling cake. Four women shared it and couldn't finish it! Do recommend for the fearless chocoholics out there.Overall, nice food, somewhat overpriced, great service.

After that though everything was synced.They serve pop overs to you too with your meal. They are huge. I had better ones before, these weren't as eggy as the ones I like but still good. For the appetizer I got the rigatoni which was very good for a simple pasta dish. The sauce was delish, I tasted the basil in the background and the cheese it came with was so creamy. The braised short rib was I think the best braised short rib I've had. Its a huge portion and the sauce it comes with too is delicious its not too sweet or salty and the brussel sprouts melted in my mouth. I wish the dessert was a tad bigger. I had the flourless chocolate cake and found myself wanting more. Its smaller than the pictures posted on yelp. I dont normally spend over 100 dollars on dinner, glad it was here though and catching up with a friend. We spent 3 hours there and chilled after the waitress took the bill and wasn't rushed out. I would come back here again, another restaraunt week.",2,0,0,Marisa M.,"Suffern, NY",230,111,259

The bisque was very creamy which nicely contrasted the crunch from the fried lobster ball (?). The black pepper cavatelli was pretty good and was decent sized but the brisket burger is a full size burger and comes with herb fries which were really good so I would get the brisket burger if I could come again because it tasted better and has bacon. The flourless cake was really good and rich, mostly tasted liked a very thick mousse.

My family and I ordered the brioche french toast with Fuji apple compote, American breakfast with pork sausage, and the eggs Florentine with Canadian bacon. Being in a hotel and all, the place was really extravagant and Spacey. We get our food and the French toast was delicious with the sweet apples. The eggs Florentine was pretty good, but the hollandaise that was on top of the eggs was a little too sour for my taste. The pork sausage, that came with the American breakfast, on the other hand, was a little too sweet, it didn't have that nice salty meaty taste that sausage usually has.

They did an amazing job with the decor, skylight, fireplaces and even table settings. Loved the music too. It was quite empty though which bothered us and we figured we were just a little on the early side. More people showed up 1/2 way through our meal but it never got crowded. Our waiter was ok but service was not that great. The brunch menu sounds great but not well executed. We got the pancakes, some sticky pecan rolls, a few drinks and juice and an omelette and sides of bacon and sausage. None of the food was that great. The pancakes were really the only thing we ordered that we liked. The sticky pecan rolls were really dry and overdone and the glaze was more like a hard sticky glue. We couldn't even finish them.

4.0,10/8/2017,"A solid 4 stars.  I had a nice experience dining at society cafe with my friend. We were looking for a last minute reservation for a Friday night summer restaurant week, and this place still had reservations available.  When we arrived, the restaurant was pretty empty, and did not fill up much the entire time we were there.  The service was probably as a result attentive, since the server didn't have many other tables.Everything we ordered was tasty, and we also opted to do the wine pairing, which was a pretty reasonable surcharge.  The burrata was very good, and came with unique accompaniments, which gave it a refreshing taste.The steak was cooked nicely and was tender and juicy.  The greens, potato, crispy onion and sauce all complemented each other wonderfully. My friend surprised me by telling the server that we were celebrating my birthday, and they decorated the dessert plate for me, which was a nice touch (and the dessert itself was yummy and chocolaty as well).Overall, I think the venue/space is more conducive to the winter time, I'm not sure what it is about it, but the vibe I got felt that it would be cozy when it's cold out.  Since it's in the neighborhood and I had a nice experience my first time, I will definitely be back to try it again.",1,1,1,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634

Opentable suggested to me about Society Cafe on 13th, so here I am. Service: Kate was fantastic. She was very friendly, and knowledgeable to many of my questions about the origins of food. She told us about the restaurant week menu but she never tried to push or recommend anything to us. Everyone, from waiters who brought us the dishes to FOH manager, was very attentive to details and professional. Chef Zabita also came out to greet us. He is a future hospitality star. Mark my word. Food: Very fresh. Love the Gazpacho appetizer (Local Melon Gazpacho, Crab Salad, Pickled Watermelon). I would go back just to eat that again. The chicken was well presented (a bit salty on one end of the chicken) and the whole dish was well-flavored and balanced. The peach dessert was simple yet right to the point. Fresh peaches and berries from farmers market and that is all you need to know. The only complaint is that Kate did not tell me I can win a trip to Farmer's Market with Chef by posting food pics until I was on the way to finish the dessert course! But this dinner has been one of the highlights of the past 2 weeks! I will come back for sure. Thank you, Team Society Cafe!",2,0,1,Chin Keung M.,"New York, NY",0,17,2

You then walk through a narrow hallways into a beautifully decorated room with ceiling windows and tons of spacious booths. We found this spot browsing for restaurant week, so we did the lunch deal. We added a mushroom flatbread- because why the hell not- and it was SO good. The pizza was thin and it was piled high with mushrooms. I started with the PEI mussels. They were in a garlic, leek white wine sauce. They came with a bomb garlic bread. Then, I had the roasted chicken. It was PERFECTLY cooked and seasoned. It was over a variety of veggies.

5.0,5/26/2017,"Society Cafe is the market to table restaurant and cocktail bar at Walker Hotel -- have dined here multiple times and it never ceases to amaze me! Chef Chris Zabita is a true culinary creative who hand picks the ingredients from local markets and is an expert forager of all the squashes, radishes, berries and how to use each one's flavor, smell and texture to create a masterpiece of a dish.While many restaurants source local, I think  Society Cafe is very unique in its mission to let guests and customers be part of that experience and educate them about it in a way that makes us appreciate what we're eating that much more. Highly recommend the burrata, House made pastas (cavatelli is my favorite), diver sea scallops and the Tomahawk for 2.

4.0,3/29/2017,"What a hidden gem! We went to many fine-dining restaurants during our visit of New York, and this one topped them all (except for Eleven Madison Park, which is pretty hard to beat). In my opinion, this little eatery doesn't get as much attention as it should.The decor is just gorgeous; the room is furnished with dark woods, and there is a delightful skylight in the roof. The lighting is comfortably dim, making it a fantastic place for date night.Staying at the hotel here, we dined at this cafe for breakfast one day, and dinner another. For breakfast, I ordered the GRANOLA WITH GREEK YOGURT, and it was deliciously satisfying. The portion was just right, making this a healthy and hearty start to the day. My friend ordered the FRITTATA for breakfast, and it was perfectly prepared and scrumptiously rich.For dinner, I ordered the DIVER SEA SCALLOPS. They were divine, and some of the most tender, richest scallops I've ever eaten. Each bite was melt-in-your-mouth, buttery goodness. The couscous was a perfect addition. This dish was definitely the star of the meal, but the WILD STRIPED BASS that my friend ordered certainly did not disappoint. It was perfectly cooked, and had very subtle, delicate, beautiful flavors to it. The tiny fried onions that accompanied the dish were lovely little morsels as well.The one complaint I have was that our waitress for dinner was extremely awkward. Maybe it was her first day, but she did not know how to converse with customers, and mumbled frequently. She did not check up on us once, either.Do not miss out on this restaurant.

2.0,3/5/2017,"While the restaurant is less than a year old yet, the space (and the Walker Hotel itself) is beautiful, bringing a bit of stately yet chic upper east side vides down to the village.  For those  Londoners in town, the space has somewhat of a Chiltern Firehouse feel to it (which few could dislike), filled with light wood furnishings against contrasting dark teal seating.  The decor aside, any place that has ""society"" in the name is going to attract a crowd in Manhattan.All that said, the food, service, and presentation leave much to be desired.  Admittedly, this review really only applies to a brunch visit, which happened to be on an obscure Thursday morning (I was one of half a dozen patrons, in which the others were all hotel guests).  The food itself was good, yet very unimpressive and extremely overpriced  (I got the brioche french toast, which was unexciting for the ~$16 price point).  Also note that the menu posted online is not their most current menu, with most menu items now 30-40% more expensive.  While the service was also good and welcoming, it too was fairly unexciting.  All in all, for a brunch price point that surpasses most prestigious village spots (the perlas, buvettes, etc), I expected much more of a wow factor and much less of a standard breakfast in an upscale hotel restaurant.   While I hope my visit was just a fluke occasion and other reviewers find much more to rave about, Society Cafe needs to step up its game if it wants to make it with the regular village brunch crowd.",1,0,0,Matt K.,"New York, NY",262,93,22
2.0,2/15/2017,"So I hear about these new reviews for Society Cafe being an up and coming spot with great food and drinks and decided to check it for Valentine's day with my girl. They informed me that they would only serve this pre-fixed 6 course meal for Valentine's day which I said was fine and they went over the menu with me over the phone despite claiming it was up on the website (It was never up even through Valentine's day). When we first arrived, we apologized for being late by basically an hour for our reservations. I did call ahead before our reservations started to let them know that we would be late. Completely our fault but when you have deadlines at work, those have to come first unfortunately.When we were arrived, ambiance was great and the restaurant wasn't fully packed and neither was the bar but we were happy to be there and excited to try some great food from all the reviews! Oddly enough other patron's in the restaurant were enjoying food from their main menu besides me being told prior that they were not serving anything else when I made the reservations. Right there that's bad communication initially.Another issue was it took what seemed like 10 minutes for a server to come over to us initially to take our drinks and provide water to us. It was probably more like 7 minutes but that still seems to be a good amount of time not providing a menu or water for a table.Then after they take our drinks, we were expecting the Valetine's day 6 course special to start arriving as our waiter did not ask us about food. We waited between 30 - 40 minutes (it really was within this time frame) and did try a few times to get the attention of the waiter who was also a bartender to no avail. Finally a hostesses  arrived and we explained we were waiting for the Valentine's meal and no one came over. She quickly addressed it and apologized for the miscommunication and got the process started for us. When the initial plates came by, it took so long for the meals to come in. We had to ask the server to expedite the serving of them. First off, they're small when it's pre-fixed. You don't need 15 to 20 minutes between each serving to bring the next dish when you can finish your plate of food in 3 bites. That's just excessive.Food quality overall was better than average in my opinion but nothing to rave about especially from all the up and coming articles from the website. Of course this was the pre-fixed menu but I still wasn't impressed.Service was definitely poor and we were really disappointed with it.

The cauliflower parmesan as a shared side is great, but just be warned it is very cheesy and creamy, so it's not a ""light"" side, but totally worth it. They have a nice selection of wines and mocktails (I couldn't drink alcohol that night).

I was actually very surprised with the flavor of the black ink pasta with chorizo. If you're in the mood to try a slightly upscale non-traditional dinner come here!My favorite part about this place was the candle lighting, wooden furnishings, fireplace, and drinks. I tried the beet cocktail with pineapple juice, picked carrot, pickle, and caviar (tasted like freshly squeezed juice!)",1,0,0,Justine K.,"New York, NY",452,94,103
4.0,1/8/2017,"Absolutely love the decor of this restaurant located   in the back inside of theWalker Hotel. The dishes are made farm to table and you can tell from the quality of the food.  A bit on the pricey side but if you can't decide, the Fettucine with 21 day aged bacon was delicious. Also get the Rocky Road Cheesecake- amazing!",2,0,0,Monica W.,"Queens, NY",108,321,1356
4.0,11/29/2016,"Delicious stuff in a beautiful space at the back of the Walker Hotel from the people behind Chalkpoint Kitchen.The Wagyu Burger is a good bet, served with some excellent fries that are super addictive ($24). Definitely get the Rocky Road Cheesecake too for dessert.I think they will eventually be expanding the menu with more options for breakfast and dinner, as they are currently in soft open mode, so I would definitely return to try more.",13,5,6,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
