3.0,4/25/2019,"Had the opportunity to attend an event here and after telling the front hostess, we were led into the back where there's a giant table with a lot of chairs around it. It was definitely a cramped situation in that you barely had any elbow room.There was bread and butter before the meal began which I didn't get a chance to try.First, the salads came out. I had ordered the Caesar salad and to be honest was a bit disappointed at the presentation of it, being that this place does have a high reputation. It was just pieces of cut up lettuce drenched in Caesar salad dressing with a few small pieces of croutons mixed in.Then after a while, the steaks came out. I had ordered my sirloin steak medium and it was okay. Wasn't the best I had ever had. I did notice that it was burnt to almost a crisp on one side but not on the bottom...not sure if that's how steaks are normally supposed to be served. Broccoli, mashed potatoes and spinach dip were also offered and simply tossed on the plates. It was a bit of an awkward dining experience. Finally, dessert platters came out in that there were five slices of a variety of cheesecakes and tiramisu with a mountain of whipped cream in the middle...the tiramisu was only redeeming choice on that platter. The lemon cheesecake had a weird aftertaste to it.The waiters were courteous and diligently served us during my time here and also cleared away the plates and utensils after each course was served.The bathrooms are small...only two stalls in the women's restroom...not to mention that the floor was sticky too...",0,1,0,Hui L.,"Woodside, NY",51,465,1301
5.0,4/17/2019,"We literally stumbled upon this restaurant while walking to the UN building down the street from our hotel. We had not prepared for a nice restaurant dinner in our packing of clothing for our vacation. I popped in to ask if it would be okay to dine later in the evening in spite of our lack of dress clothing. We were assured by the lady at the podium (I wish I had gotten her name) that it would be fine. we returned later and were greeted warmly by the same hostess that we had encountered previously. After being seated we were waited on by Timmy and a young man who I assume was in training. From start to finish our meal was incredible. 2 dry aged rib-eyes cooked to a perfect mid rare, German potatoes cooked crispy, and a side of sauteed mushrooms. Service was impeccable and the food was beyond reproach. If we get a chance to visit this wonderful city again, we will certainly make this a must eat destination.",0,0,0,Peg W.,"Leland, NC",19,5,0

5.0,2/18/2019,"A splendid time was had!We've been fans of Benjamin for many years.  Last time we went, we were seated at a cramped table and our check (for 2) crossed the $400 mark, which made us wonder if there wasn't something better...Low and behold, we checked into the Even Hotel on 44th and saw the sign for Ben and Jack's and gave it a try.Nice place and tables are NOT cramped together.  Also prices are about 20% less than Benjamin, which is nice.  Food is spectacular.  We had the crab cocktail, tuna tartar, and porterhouse for two and all were just plain top shelf.  For sides, we had creamed spinach (wow - outstanding!), roasted brussels sprouts and a big backed potato.  House steak sauce is quite nice - similar to Benjamin and without any anchovies (like Luger has - who wants that on their steak?!?!).Extensive wine list reasonably priced - less than 2X what you would pay for the bottle in the store.Service started out a little spotty but then finished up just fine.  We will definitely go back.Give these guys a try - the porterhouse is right up there with the best I've ever had.  (and I do like porterhouse!)",2,0,0,Adam S.,"Averill Park, NY",1,27,0

I decided on Ben & Jack's Steakhouse on East 44th and I'm so glad that I did. My Wife & I arrived to a nearly empty restaurant (how we like it) when we came for our 3PM Lunch Restaurant. We were sat by the kin Hostess then greeted by the very warm server Timmi. He made us feel right at home. We looked over the menu and ordered our food. I've had steak at over 50 different steakhouses in my life and as I told Timmi, the steak I had here HAD to be the BEST steak I've ever had. The Caesar salad was perfect, the mash & broccoli was delicious and I had a few glasses of the desert wine.The bill came up to about $100 for 2 and I can't wait to return although I know it'll be more next time around, it'll be well worth it.",2,0,0,Heaven G.,"New York, NY",157,100,164

3.0,2/2/2019,"2.5/5 stars for food, 4.75/5 for service=3.63 stars (sadly Yelp doesn't allow us to be that precise)Took my bro here for his birthday and ordered off the $42 restaurant week dinner menu:We picked: (Apps)Baked clamsSliced tomato and mozzarella(Entrees)8 oz filet mignonNy sirloin steak(Both came with broccoli and mashed potatoes)(Side)Creamed spinach (additional $7)(Desserts)NY-style cheesecake Chocolate mousse cakeHouse wine bottle: Malbec (additional $45)The side and apps were standard, nothing fancy but fine. The clams were pretty small, though. The comp bread basket was unimpressive, as it was filled with some stale onion rolls and sliced white loaf. Where the fresh, hot bread at?! The steaks, however, were overcooked twice. The first time, my bro ordered his medium rare and I ordered mine medium, but they both came out well done. When I told the waiter, the manager (I believe) came over and very quickly gave us new steaks. I ordered my second steak medium rare because I didn't want another mishap, but both of ours came medium to medium well. By this time, we were hungry and didn't want to wait any longer, so we just ate. The taste was fine..standard, buttery steakhouse steaks..just not cooked right either time. (Pretty inexcusable for a steakhouse tbh, though they gave us a free second bottle of wine we could not finish - in retrospect, I should've asked for the first bottle to be comp'd instead) I skimmed the reviews below and learned that other diners have also had issues with the way their steaks were cooked. Hmm...We took dessert to go, but it was horrible. The (plain with a drizzle of blueberry syrup) cheesecake had a thick, doughy pie crust attached to it (gross and flavorless, why?!), and the chocolate mousse wasn't actually a cake because it had an Oreo cookie crust. It was also overly sweet.If service had been terrible, I would've given 2 stars, but thankfully they had that going for them.

My favorite was the key lime pie, it was really delicious and had a nice texture; the filet mignon (served with broccoli and mashed potatoes) was soft and it was cooked perfectly but it I don't think it was the best filet mignon I've ever had; finally, the onion soup was good but maybe I would order a different appetizer next time.

4.0,1/22/2019,"I came here for lunch during restaurant week with my girlfriend. Luckily, my birthday was during this time so it was a good way to celebrate. As far as the atmosphere goes, it's very clean and neat. It's clear that the staff puts in effort into making the restaurant look presentable and comfortable to dine in. The waiter came fairly quick and answered our questions clearly. He also checked up on us pretty often to see if we needed anything. For our appetizers, I got the mushroom soup and my girlfriend got a caesar salad. Both came in a decent portion. Not too small and not too filling. It was just right. For the main course, I got the chicken parmigiana with rigatoni. My girlfriend got a steak (I forgot which one) and it came with broccoli and mashed potatoes. Her steak, broccoli, and mashed potatoes tasted very good. My chicken parmigiana was the reason why I gave this place 4 stars. While it was edible, I definitely felt like I had better from other restaurants. The rigatoni felt a little bit undercooked. It was still edible but it would've been more enjoyable if it had been cooked longer. The chicken was a good size, nothing to complain about except it was a little bit too dry. The tomato sauce didn't help at all because it was a little bit too salty. To sum my plate up, it was all over the place. Undercooked, dry, and salty for the most part. Still edible, however.Would I come back? Yes. Although I had a bad first impression with the chicken parmigiana, the steak my girlfriend had was delicious. I wouldn't let one bad plate stop me from coming here and I believe it's a good place for anyone to visit.",0,0,0,Vincent S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,23,16

5.0,12/26/2018,"I had two things planned for a Boxing Day jaunt into the city: a walk around Bronx Zoo and a meal at a good steakhouse.Post-zoo, I had a 2:30 reservation booked at Ben & Jack's - a classy if not wholly original spot a few blocks east of Grand Central. While there are no shortages of steakhouses in Midtown, Ben & Jack's offers up a great deal for great steak: a three course prix-fixe lunch for $32.50.I went with french onion soup and a 12oz sirloin. The cup of soup came with a bubbling crust of cheese enveloping a rich, deep broth. Make use of the complimentary bread basket for this: it's too good to let a drop go to waste.The steak is as good as any I've had in New York: cooked a perfect medium rare, this dry aged prime beef was cut off the bone and managed to combine meltingly tender meat with a serious char. Even the simple sides of broccoli and mashed potatoes were delicious...and all the better when washed down with a fine ManhattanDessert came as the final course: a slice of cheesecake with a mound of fresh whipped cream. The cheesecake was good (not great or particularly memorable), but the whipped cream made the dish.",18,12,13,Craig G.,"Jersey City, NJ",107,358,112
4.0,12/24/2018,"Ben & Jack's Steakhouse, initially opened its first location on 44th Street in 2005 but closed down in 2012 for 5 years due to the renovations of the building, has finally returned in 2017 to its very own original location. The anticipated return definitely showed how they flourished as one of the top destinations for world-class steaks and chops and has been satisfying everyone's all sorts of cravings since then.Upon entering, you can't help but notice the impressively classical yet modern design of the interior. The high ceilings, every piece of rich oak wood panels built on-site in the restaurant, choice of furniture and crystal chandeliers all contribute to the classic and elegant atmosphere for a hedonistic dining experience. The wall-sized exhibition wine case is located in the dining room, facing all guests but also allowing guests to view a display of the restaurant's wide and varied selection of wines.To start off the dinner, there are several appetizers you just simply can't pass up on, with one being the Sizzling Canadian Bacon (extra thick by the slice). It is brined, smoked then grilled to yield the perfect ratio of fat and char. Staying true to its name, the thick slice of bacon came sizzling still on the plate before being served. This bacon might be thick sliced but it was still tender and juicy, with an extra crunch that pulls you back to the idea of your typical slice of bacon. It tastes even better with its own signature The Original (not just) Steak Sauce. Ben & Jack's uses market-fresh ingredients and products to bring the best flavors to every guest. The seared scallops and classic Caesar salad did just that; the scallops lightly yet perfectly seared to simply bring out and highlight the freshness, and the simple salad made with fresh vegetables with the right amount of dressing and cheese sprinkled atop definitely hit the spot. There are also many other salads and appetizers to try out like the Sesame-crusted Yellowfin Tuna with a balsamic reduction and wasabi sauce, baked whole clams and Maryland Crab Cakes.The dining experience was absolutely enjoyable; partly because of how veteran wait-staffs and executive chef Admir Alibasic explained and served each dish, making sure all guests enjoy their good in the best possible way. Chef Admir, also the creator of their steak sauce - prime accompaniment to every dish, is the one who personally checks all the USDA prime labeled beef when sent to the restaurant and makes it all happen, as it becomes dry aged meat. The selection of USDA prime steaks are from the top purveyors in NYC and dry-aged in-house and every cut whether it is the porterhouse, filet mignon, strip steak, or prime rib, it is all handpicked and surely top grade.The signature Porterhouse steak attacks your nose with amazingly delicious and mouth-watering aromas before it even comes in contact with your taste buds. It is lightly salted because that's basically all the flavoring you need. It is precisely cooked and perfectly tender, making every bite your second to last because it is purely delicious and simply can't stop. The baste of au jus (melted fat) that is poured back onto the steak makes each bite not only juicy but also full of its own flavors.There are several sides that are more commonly seen with steak dishes like the Creamed Spinach and German potatoes. They also have the Mac and cheese, which comes with a sweet onion taste, different from other steakhouses' mac and cheese.Ben & Jack's Steakhouse offers a wide selection of classic cocktails, wines and many more. Chef Admir has personally curated an extensive wine list of plenty of labels. This steakhouse came back to its original location just as strong, along with its other location; bring something very different to the table, setting a high standard and caliber for the rest. It offers more than just top-grade prime beef and steak, but all their products are market-fresh, and it exceptionally satisfies all guests in many different ways, which makes Ben & Jack's Steakhouse not just your typical steakhouse, one with an amazing experience - a hedonistic one.",0,0,0,Tom L.,"Brooklyn, NY",128,129,935

4.0,10/31/2018,"We were looking for a special place for dinner on our last night in NYC and came across Ben & Jack's Steakhouse on Yelp.  After checking the reviews and of course menu and prices we made our reservations and headed there.It was a kind of casual elegant atmosphere with some people dressed well and some others in jeans and a polo so we fit right in.  The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating in fact a little too much at times as we had waiters, up to 4 at a time standing around us waiting to fill our water glass after every sip (I'm exaggerating...lol).We arrived hungry so as usual we ordered with our eyes and stomach and ordered way too much food.  We started off with the thick cut Canadian bacon which was yummy and tasted exactly as I thought it would and ordered the fried calamari for our second appetizer but was a little disappointed with the sauce which was watery.  The calamari itself was light and crispy but we ended up using the steak sauce to dip it in.For the main course we ordered the Chilean sea bass and rib eye steak.  The rib eye was decent but I have tasted better and softer.  The sea bass was spot on...soft & juicy.  It's an oily fish so if that's your preference then this is the one to order.For our sides we ordered the lobster mac & cheese and sauteed mushrooms which were good but not blow my socks off good.  Maybe we'll try the Maryland crab cake next time. Overall experience was great.  Super attentive staff with a nice atmosphere.  Food was good but I don't know if it was $200 good.  I will however consider trying it again since there are other things on the menu I'd like to try.",1,0,1,Les T.,"Waipahu, HI",2,31,58
5.0,10/30/2018,"All we wanted was a great burger and a nice red wine to go with it. We were visiting New York, staying in Midtown at a frequented hotel about 6 blocks away. After checking with the concierge, she quickly recommended Ben & Jack's Steakhouse, called them for us and we had a reserved seat at the bar.  Bonus: Happy Hour Wagu Burgers ALWAYS at the bar between 4:00 pm to 7:00 pm!!!After we arrived and up to the front door, there was a sign in front, and sure enough, it read ""Happy Hour, Every Day 4pm to 7 pm, $1.50 Per Oyster and American Wagu Burger $13.95 available at the bar only"". When we walked in to the front of the restaurant, I was also surprised that this place was a lot more upscale than one would think, offering a deal like this every day. THIS PLACE HAS CLASS, dark woods, low lit atmosphere and this bar was exactly what we love. Comfortable seating with high back heavy chairs, beautiful display of liquors and a great choice of wines.  They also had a TV behind the bar.  Perfect, but tonight we were here to enjoy being together in this type of atmosphere, not a sports bar and far from it. We were greeted be our server, Mike, who was genuinely welcoming, gave us the Bar Menu and explained the Happy Hour deal and answered questions on the menu. This Bar Menu was simple with lots of options of food on the left, and plenty of varieties of wines on the right. Exactly what we came here for. We ordered 2 glasses of B.R. Cohen Silver label Cabs and along with our wines, there were chips on the bar all the time to go with it.  We saw that there were Baked Clams Oreganata on the menu and ordered a 6 serving plate to share.  Delicious with just amount of very thin breading and garlic flavor.  Very soft rolls were served with it. This was perfect and we had not even had our Burgers yet.  I learned that Ben & Jacks have been around NY for a long time in other locations, because I could tell that this was not their first rodeo, but the newest location.Any nice bar always attracts nice people and we seem to always make new friends at places like this, and tonight we met a really nice woman who frequents here and knows everyone who works here.  I quickly picked up on the fact, that if you come here often enough, it can become  a very warm, friendly place where people get to know you and treat you like family.  That was truly evident. OH, THE BURGERS!!!  So, we ordered what we came here for, the Wagu Burgers.  Mike gave us a choice of cheeses to put on it and I chose the Swiss, and my wife chose to not put cheese on hers. Served with lettuce, tomato, pickle and a slice of onion, this sandwich was way too big to eat whole, so I cut it in half.  The burger had to be about an 8 oz portion, juicy which you can tell from the pictures, and cooked perfectly medium, pink in the middle.  Thick steak fries on the side. Also staring me in the face was a bottle of Ben & Jack's Steakhouse Steak Sauce. I poured a modest amount of the sauce on top. One bite, I was in ""burger heaven"".  I could not have had a better, juicy tastiest Wagu Burger than this. This was just my experience at the bar.  Cozy dark, low lit atmosphere, inviting and friendly service and a great atmosphere to meet people if you choose to.  I did get a chance to check out their main dining room. Warm, classy, white table clothes and a nice wine cellar in the back with great artwork everywhere. Loved the Bronze Bull surrounded by Liters of Red wine sitting on a platform. I have heard from others that have been to the other locations that the steaks here were fabulous.  Did not check out the dinner menu, but everything being equal, I can bet a dinner out here would be an amazing too.Thank you to the Lexington Hotel Concierge for recommending great place to hang out with just a great burger, and Thank You Mike at the bar for taking great care of us. WE WILL BE BACK for dinner!!!",15,7,11,Michael C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",891,319,18707

Seared surface is delicious and to die for. Both mashed potatoes and sauteed broccoli complimented nicely. Completely satisfied.Pecan pie: I was caught off guard by how piping hot it was (and nearly burned my tongue), but this was really a pleasant surprise. Not excessively sweet, and pie crust was flaky and buttery. A delicious conclusion to the meal.Ambiance of the restaurant was good, and servers were respectful and attentive.

The restaurant has a dreary and depressing atmosphere. It is badly in need of new carpets, paint, etc.The service was perhaps the worst service I have ever had in a restaurant. The waiters were unimaginably inattentive. We were completely ignored. We had to ask for menus, ask for water, etc. It took way too long to flag down a waiter. On top of this, we were berated by our waiter. We mistakenly assumed that the creamed spinach included cream. After asking about it, we were lectured that the cream spinach was in fact sautéed spinach, and that it was ridiculous that we did not know this because Peter Lugers also does this. They ultimately brought us creamed spinach with cream and told us next time that we should be smart enough to ask for the creamed spinach with cream to avoid confusion on our parts. To make this worse, the waiter mocked us as he served us the creamed spinach with cream by saying ""mmm yum yum, mmm yum yum"" over and over as he served each of us.All of this being said, the steak was wonderful. While I will not be going back, they do know how to make a good steak. Mmm yum yum!-------------After writing this review I received an email from the management.

5.0,10/24/2012,"I was in visiting from Florida, originally from NY, with 4 other friends. We ended our weekend of partying and football games with Ben and Jacks. Aside from our spectacularly awesome tailgate, this was the highlight of the weekend.I have to say I have been to pretty much every high end steak place in Miami, where I live presently. Name the chain place and I have been there on business many times, not too mention a few unique or ""mom and pop"" steak joints. Ben and Jacks had the best steak I ever had, hands down. Congrats to them!I shared the steak for 2 with another buddy of mine.It was a pre-cut Porterhouse. It could have fed 3 of us. We ordered it medium rare. It was seasoned perfect, it had the perfect crust and cooked perfect. In short it was just the perfect steak. For appetizers we had the Calamari, baked clams, shrimp cocktail and the crab cake. All were very good and as good if not better than what you should expect at a high end steak place. I had a Caesar salad with anchovies for some roughage. The salad was surprisingly excellent. Surprisingly, because you would be surprised at the percentage of places that cant even make a decent Caesar salad, I am always surprised when one does. The anchovies they use were definitely a high end product.The sides were very good except the mushrooms. We ordered the broccoli, asparagus creamed spinach and the mushrooms. The mushrooms weren't good, they were outstanding.In my party were 2 guys from Cali, 1 from Scotland, 1 from Virginia and myself. All of us universally thought Ben and Jacks had the best steak they ever had.Thank you for the great meal. Also lol complaining about the lack of vegan options in a steak joint. That's like going into a bar and complaining about all the alcohol.Edit: Ben and Jacks was moderately quiet with a noise level that was more than fair for a restaurant. The wait staff was professional and always around. Which is exactly what you would expect for top end steak restaurant. Also the prices were fair and certainly well within the range you should expect at a great steak restaurant. We are now making Ben and Jacks a mandatory meeting place for our annual NYC Football excursion, I can't wait for next years tailgate. J-E-T-S JETS JETS JETS, LOL.",0,0,0,Stan A.,"Hialeah, FL",0,1,0

We plan on coming back and making a stop here every year when we visit the city.

I don't know these things.  The waiter said the difference between that and the steak for 4 is that the one for 4 has an extra strip of meat between the bones.  So not really that much of a difference.The reason I give this place 3 stars instead of 4 (it wouldn't get 5, the food wasn't THAT great) is that a baby roach paid us a visit.  We called over the waiter and he waved it off as something having to do with the plants around the restaurant.  We were very sure it was a baby roach (come on NYers...) and not a plant bug.  I know roaches are just a thing in NYC but I would rather not see them playing on the table I am eating on.  Oof.",2,2,0,Jess K.,"Pelham, NY",169,1246,169

4.0,2/16/2012,"I'm usually pretty tough on contenders for top-shelf NY steakhouse status, even tougher on the ""me-too"" flaunting of typical prices for an inferior steakhouse pretender experience and harder still on the Luger wanna-be's.  That said, Ben & Jack's is a steakhouse that I've really enjoyed over the years.  They are, IMRHO, the real deal.  Dry aged prime is the standard for an elite steakhouse; anybody trying to convince you otherwise needs to become one with what attentive dry aging does for top quality beef.  Handled competently, a significant quantity of beef is sacrificed for the absolute enjoyment of what remains-- this is why the going rate is $40-42.  Sure, plenty of high profile steakhouses want to charge these prices for ""wet aged"" and/or choice grade beef, but now you know better (you can thank me later).Like the best-of-the-best steakhouses, Ben & Jack's product is spectacular; something to be savored from that first instance of a sharp knife piercing the perfectly seasoned and seared surface.  Yes, proper seasoning, careful trimming of gristle and sinew and serving at the requested degree of doneness are definitely a part of the price of admission.Impeccable service is an extremely difficult standard to maintain full-time and all the time; we humans just aren't hard wired to this criteria.  Perhaps this is why you'll see such variation in reviews of steakhouse service, and I don't doubt that many are legitimate gripes.  Perhaps it is only good fate which allows me to describe Ben & Jack's service as reaching that pinnacle, and perhaps my perception will do a complete ""180"" with my next visit-- I sincerely hope not.My experiences at Ben & Jack's are in a league with my sheer enjoyment of a steak dinner at Keen's, Delmonico's or one of the very few others who set the expectation for steakhouse greatness in NYC.",18,10,12,Steve G.,"Union, NJ",681,831,0

3.0,12/25/2011,"The rating might be a bit on the low side (if I could include a ""point five"", it would be more appropriate), and it's primarily related to the steak, so I have to say that it's subject to change (but that'll have to wait until after my next visit).  Plus, it's on a relative scale compared to other steak houses I've been to in NYC.  I think part of the problem was the expectation I had about Ben and Jack's given its pedigree (Luger), so you can conclude that, in my opinion, it wasn't as good as Peter Luger.  And I would definitely say that it falls short of Strip House.  But Ben and Jack's is still a pretty darn good dining experience.My buddy and I shared the porterhouse for two, and if you understand the cut and want to go the ""shared"" route, I would advise digging into the New York side (the larger, or ""strip"" side) first.  The reason I recommend this is even if you start feeling full after the NY, once you take a bite into the filet side, your appetite will return.  The NY strip was surprisingly NOT too tender, and truth be told, I had to chew a lot more than I'm normally used to.  The tenderloin filet half of the ""T"" was so tender, and even though my friend and I had the meat cooked differently (I wanted medium rare, he wanted medium well), the chefs were still able to save my share of the filet from being burnt.  Actually, I had some of the medium-well portion as well, and while not as juicy as the medium-rare meat, it was still tender and flavorful.  However, I think I learned my lesson: pass on the porterhouse and stick with the filet.  I started with the French Onion soup, which was amazing.  Despite how it fills you up before the ""main event"" arrives, I'm crazy for good French Onion soup, and B&J's was one of the best I've had.  But for sides, I'd pass on the onion rings.  Felt a little too filling or greasy.  The other side dish we had was the sauteed mushrooms, which was outstanding.  For dessert, we shared slices of pecan and key lime pie; both were exceptional.  Can't tell you whether they were their own or bought from the outside, but if you still have room for dessert, you won't be disappointed with either.All in all, I think the dining experience was more a four-star, but my disappointment with the New York side of the steak was too much of a drag on the overall rating.  Still, I don't think most people will regret a visit to Ben and Jack's.",0,0,0,Eric O.,"Woodside, NY",2,44,0

If that one was a 10, this was probably a 6 out of 10.The ribeye steak was good, but far from great (a great steakhouse would have trimmed the fat that was served). The portion was very large. The steak was flavorful and juicy. Ordered it medium and it was just right. The place is loud and boisterous but my friend and I were able to talk without shouting (our reservation was for 6:30 on a Tuesday).One flaw -- we tried to order one of the top Irish whiskeys. The waiter said they didn't have Red Breast and when we asked for Knappeague, he said yes. First, they brought my drink (which was ordered as whiskey and soda on the rocks) with 7-Up and whiskey.

4.0,10/24/2011,"I met up 2 friends for dinner here on Saturday because it was our opportunity to have real medium rare steak without no-nonsense-well-done-ers.  As soon as we sit down and the waiter passes us the menu, my friend comments ""this is just like Peter Luger's!"".  No, that's not the way to start off your repertoire with the waiter.  He claims, ""yes, except we're better!"".  Okay, well, I've never been to Peter Luger's but this place was pretty good.Food:We had steak for three and it was plentiful.  It was medium rare and looked and tasted it.  We ordered 2 sides: sauteed spinach and mushtrooms.  AMAZING.  The house wine is South African Cabernet and it was pretty good for house wine. I'd recommend it.  For dessert, we ordered chocolate mouse pie.  It was a sizeable slice that we shared among the three of us (although, we were pretty full from dinner itself).  There are about 15 different desserts on the menu and they all come with ""schlag"" (whipped cream) - a WHOLE BOWL of it.  yum.  One more thing...they have their own steak sauce at the table.  I typically don't use steak sauce but since they had their own, I thought I'd try it....and it tastes alot like cocktail sauce!  Weird right?Ambiance:Ambiance was warm and pretty typical for a steakhouse.  The waiters were well dressed and all the tables were spaced out and covered in tablecloth.Service: We had dinner reservations for 7:30 so we ended up staying for a while (3 hours) prior to going out and the service was awesome.  They didnt' rush us and made sure everything was okay with the food etc.  Minus the snarky response to the Peter Luger comment, he was awesome and brought us everything we asked for.  There were 5 (count them) birthdays that night and we heard the all-male-waitstaff sing their version of happy birthday all night.  They also bring out a yellow cake complimentary for the birthday girl/boy. Overall recommendation:I'd go back the next time i'm looking for a steakhouse.  It was pretty good and in a good location in the city.",0,0,0,Young C.,"New York, NY",57,90,13

We ordered jumbo shrimp cocktail which was good. For steak, we've got steak for 2. It was just ok. I thought the steak was sort of tasteless. My husband cooksmakes better steak at home.

My friend wanted to celebrate his recent promotion and took all of us out. My sister also flew in from Chicago and wanted to try a New York steak. Hands down, this is the place to go for your first New York steak of whatever! She was shocked by her grilled to perfection, incredibly thick, and generous proportion of veal steak. Have no fear! This steakhouse has huge meat cuts so you will be very full by the end of the meal. It's a very intimate, snug setting inside full of mahogany walls and floors, red carpets, and white linen tables. The servers are dressed old-school. There is no music so you enjoy the sound of your company :) FOOD: My favorite steakhouse! For appetizers, we had the incredibly simple but incredibly flavorful Caesar salad, a bottle of Shiraz, Calamari, and french fries. I loved their calamari - fried to perfection. Don't order cocktail if you have a large party - there is only 4 each! Each cut of meat steak is about $40-$48, but well worth it. I ordered Filet Mignon ""medium rare"" and it was so juicy, lean, and tender. My friends had Prime Chops and Rib Eye Steak which have more bone, but more meat. The vegetable side dishes are small so order them per person.

My finance got the french onion soup to start with (piping hot deliciousness...and that is coming from a girl who dislikes french onion soup), and the porter house (not the lunch prix fixe menu).

5.0,8/21/2011,"HOLY AMAZINGNESS - Best steak I have ever had in my life... hands down. Went here last night for the boyfriend's dad's bday celebration/last night visiting us in NYC, and GOOD GOD it couldn't have been a better experience. We walked in and were greeted by the friendly staff, got a nice quiet table in the corner and had plenty of room to relax. Great start. Our waiter, Burim (amazing!), was crazy attentive and helpful and just made us feel like we were special. Perfect Waiter? Check. Now on to the food. STARTERS: We started off with the crab and oysters on the half shell. PERFECT. Best crab I've ever had, and the oysters were fresh and flavorful. We moved on to some cesar salad and french onion soup. DELISH. And then, the grand daddy of the meal, the ""Steak for two"" ........... *light shines down from heaven as the plate is placed on the table* ............. *a choir of angels sing* ............. This steak came out sizzling hot. Burim even slid each piece of steak across the hot plate as he dished to us, just to give that extra *tsssssss* of the sizzle. (Great touch Burim)THE STEAK: Crispy on the outside and LIKE BUTTER on the inside. I didn't know it was humanly possible to cook a steak to such perfection. Hands down the best steak I've ever had (and I've had some great steaks). Bravo Ben. Bravo Jack.SIDES: We got the german potatoes and the sauteed spinach. There were plenty of each for 3 people and both were a great accompaniment to the steak.DESSERT: Tiramisu. Whipped cream. Heaven. Get it.SUMMARY: This is an amazing place to go for a special dinner that you will remember forever. They treat you well and the food is mind blowing. The only downside is the price, but you know when you go in it's going to set you back, and for a special meal, it's worth it. If you're worried about price, just steer clear because you won't have fun.And, please, for the love of God, DRESS NICE. I'm not picky when it comes to attire, but there's nothing worse than getting all dressed up for a fancy meal (because how often do we really do this?!) and the guy next to you comes in with a baseball cap and a raggedy t-shirt.

I can't stop thinking about it, even weeks later! For dinner, we ordered our typical steakhouse cut, the porterhouse for 2, black and blue. Needless to say, it was delicious and and cooked perfectly. We also got a side of the cottage fries, which were pretty much potato chips. For dessert, we split the cheesecake and it was definitely one of the best pieces I've ever had.This was also one of the priciest dinners I've had, at $200 for the meal and drinks after tax and tip, but obviously, you are paying for a very high quality meal here.

The salad was excellent with a perfect amount of dressing. The calamari was above average, but the red sauce tasted a little fishy. Our main dish came out with strip steaks cooked to the exact temp.

So now learning that B&JS is a child of Peter Luger, things make a lot of sense. By far the porterhouse is the cut to get. They get it just right with the butter sizzle and perfect med-rare doneness. ....but if you're like me the petite fillet is still completely filling and delish.

5.0,10/26/2010,"I dined here recently on a Saturday night as part of a group of 8 loud and hungry guys.  I've been here twice previously.What is there really to say?  Ben and Jack's offers everything you could want from a traditional steakhouse, including a much better location than the every-so-slightly better porterhouse at Peter Luger in Williamsburg.We called ahead for our reservation earlier in the week, and they were kind enough to offer a private room.  The service throughout dinner was exactly as it should be - attentive without being obtrusive.We went through three magnum bottles of wine (all excellent, and not overpriced relative to other high-end restaurants) and several rounds of other drinks.  Good wine selection, and great ""brown liquor"" selection (bourbon, blends, single-malts, etc.).The onion rolls were the star of the breadbasket, as always.  I highly recommend consuming approximately 6-8 onion rolls with the equivalent of a stick of butter and LOTS of their homemade steak sauce.  The perfect start to a meal.For our seafood course, the oysters were fresh, shrimp were huge and perfectly cooked (I've noticed that many restaurants seem to have trouble cooking large shrimp to the correct doneness), lump crab cocktail was very fresh.  Prepared horseradish aplenty, and the cocktail sauce was just okay.The steak was not disappointing in the least.  For the eight of us, we ordered the porterhouse for 10, which all got consumed, thanks largely the efforts of me and the bachelor around whom the evening was centered.  I noticed some side dishes floating around the table (german potatoes, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach), but I ignored them all, focusing instead on chewing every morsel of steak off the bones left behind on the steak serving platters.The coffee course brought out some surprisingly good espresso.I could design my perfect meal, and it really wouldn't look substantially different than the meal that I ate at Ben and Jack's.  If you want the full food and drink experience, be prepared to spend $150/person including tip.  If you want food only, you'll still have a hard time getting out for less than $100 per head.  We managed to spend around $250/head, thanks to some big appetites and lots of wine/liquor.Best meal I've had since the last time I went to Ben and Jack's!(I'm still unsure if I prefer Ben and Jack's or Wolfgang's, but I'm completely sure that I can't go wrong either way)",3,0,0,Danny B.,"Slingerlands, NY",1,15,0

The waiter shot back that this is the best restaurant in the city and that they have everything. I just thought that was kind of rude.

Of course, compared to Luger's there is no way that it'll even touch upon 5 stars, but I will say that the bacon is a little thicker here than there. Steaks- we tried the bone in ny, bone in ribeye, and the filet. I have douts about the authenticity of the filet because I have never seen one so huge.. I thought it was a smaller cut of meat, thus making the filet the most prized part of the animal? Maybe the cow was irradiated to twice the size of normal grass fed ones? It was still delicious, but a little fattier than what I'm used to. The NY steak was delicious, although in hindsight, we should have just ordered the porterhouse for two. The ribeye was superbly marbled and the fat was just waiting to burst out of every bite! The sides left much to be desired... the baked potato didn't have any toppings and the mashed potatoes were sans flavor, just like the steamed asparagus.

I really like that the plate was hot enough for us to sear the steak a little if we wanted, for some extra heat. Could have actually been a little more rare though, the beef could definitely be eaten raw and still be extremely flavorful without salt or pepper, which I didn't touch the entire evening. I will admit, I picked up that F'n bone and went to town, it was well worth it!Filet - medium rare - all I can really say, soooo tender, flavor didn't quite do it though, c'est la vie, that's the cut.Ribeye - medium rare - I have always loved this cut of meat, it has great flavor, is tender and was really great at Ben & Jacks, bone-in (would still go with Steak for Two though).Creamed Spinach - Not that creamy, very baby food like, don't think I'd ever order this again.Asparagus - very fresh, hardly steamed, could feel the healthiness radiating off of it. I would highly recommend that they sauté this with crushed red pepper, it would be so gooooood and compliment the steak so well.If you can afford it, I would definitely suggest taking the men and ladies here alike!

There was nothing wrong with it; I just realized my craving was for something hot. I ate a little less than half of it before pushing it aside. The waiter came over a few minutes later and noticed the uneaten portion. He began asking me if I didn't like it, if I wanted something else. Now, I have no problem complaining. But I complain only if I feel it's justified - i.e. there's a hair in my salad, the chicken isn't fully cooked, this tastes like ass. So I just shrugged and said I was making room for the steak. He didn't seem convinced.The steak (a porterhouse) and our sides came out next. It was the Steak for Two (~$80), with a side of 1/2 steak fries, 1/2 onion strings (not actually on the menu, but the waiter said it was no problem). I was able to get my side of the steak cooked medium, and bf's side was well-done. Bf's comment on the steak: ""This is the best steak of my life!!"" He previously had declared that at Boa in Santa Monica, for a smaller steak that cost ~$80 just for him. We swapped pieces so we could determine if the way mine was cooked tasted better. We agreed that though mine was a little more tender, they were both flavorful and had a fantastic crispy outer layer.I liked the steak fries, and didn't mind the onion strings but bf wasn't fond of the flavor. When the waiter came by to ask how things were going, he noticed the uneaten onion strings and asked if we wanted something else. We were very appreciative of the fact that he was noticing our discontent with certain dishes and offering to bring replacements - that's rare.At the end of the meal, the waiter dropped off our check and told us he had taken our $30 seafood platter off the bill.

5.0,3/29/2009,"I'm having trouble ranking this place base on its Luger like porterhouse.I started off w/ Wolfgang's. Then I found out they are an off-shoot of PL. Then I went to the PL in LI, disappointed. I stuck w/ Wolfgang's until I went to the original Peter Luger's in BK. I was once again, impressed by the overall quality of their steaks. Now that I went to Ben & Jack's, another off-shoot of Peter Luger, what do I think?I have to say... this is so tough to choose. I would go to any one of them, any day of the week. I truly enjoy all three. Although this place has a really nice balance between PL and Wolfgang's. It isn't as crispy as Wolfgang's, but it was really good from the first to the last bite.Come to think of it... I might like this place better than PL. PL was a bit charred when I had it. And that's entirely a person opinion. But I'm not too down with charred meat. But PL was cheaper than this, and we even had wine last time. There's only one problem with this place. The lack of customers. We went on  a Friday night, and the restaurant is barely 1/2 packed around 9 PM. I guess they are really hit by the recession.",3,0,2,Jack N.,"Brooklyn, NY",155,352,129

5.0,3/6/2009,"Good bye Peter Luger's, hello Ben and Jack's.A friend was craving some deliciously charred red meat so we decided to head to Ben and Jack's. We went on a Thursday evening and got a table immediately (table for 3). The waiters were very friendly and attentive. We started with Fresh Oysters on the half shell and Jumbo Lump Crabmeat. The oysters were very fresh and huge! The crabmeat was a little bland but with a little horseradish and lemon it was still good. We got a Porterhouse for 2 (dry aged on premises) and broiled Chilean Seabass. The steak was cooked to perfection (medium-rare) and was so tender and juicy. Forget Peter Luger's, this was better. I usually try to avoid over-fished fish, but the Chilean Seabass sounded too good to pass. The crust was crispy and delicious and the buttery fish just melted in my mouth. As far as sides go, my friend got a baked potato. The potato was nice and big and came with a big helping of sour cream.  I didn't try it, but he liked it. On to desserts. We got the Creme Brulee and Key Lime Pie. The creme brulee was good but could have used a thicker sugar crust. It wasn't crunchy enough. The key lime pie was nice and tart and had a graham cracker crust. There was a generous heap of homemade shlag, which went well with the pie. Bottom line, if you're looking for a place that not only has great steaks, but great seafood too, head to Ben and Jack's.",1,0,1,Joe C.,"Queens, NY",3,5,2
3.0,2/21/2009,"Been here for lunch a couple of times. I always get the burger because I don't feel like breaking the bank. My friends usually get a thick slice of bacon with it, but the bacon is so thick and fatty - too rich for me. The burger is scrumptiously delicious, though not the best I've had by a long shot. Very juicy, but i find that they have a tendency to overcook the burger - twice I've asked for medium-rare and gotten medium-well. Maybe next time I'll ask for rare - but I'm afraid I'll get a mooing burger. I haven't been for dinner, but will probably try their steaks at some point.",0,0,0,Eric B.,"New York, NY",52,36,0

4.0,1/25/2009,"Asides from the presence of the businessmen that frequent nice steakhouses like this, the place is more casual than I thought - with families and kids wearing jeans and sweatshirts. I felt overdressed as I went for an anniversary. As for the decor, it looks like a very traditional steakhouse with dimmer-than-I-like lighting. One element I look forward to at a place like this is the bread basket - filled with all sorts of warm, fresh, carb goodies. I grab a roll and it's cold...wth...I like my bread warm...disappointing. The bacon was good but so is pork belly that I can cook myself at a Korean BBQ joint. Luckily the sizzling sound of our porterhouse for two drenched in oil came just in time. The meat was so tender and juicy - probably the best I've had. I like the meat better than at Mastro's in Beverly Hills (yes, I hear gasps from the LA people). The side choices didn't really appeal to me. We ordered the creamed spinach, which was more spinach than cream in a good way, and the cottage fries and onion rings, which would be good by themselves but were too oily for me when eaten with the steak. The service was a bit confusing as I'm not used to multiple servers for a table. We were asked the same questions by different servers, and they all started to look the same...Overall, the meat is the star here and it shines brilliantly.

There were tables full of business men who were probably letting loose after a hard day of work - a very loud place so if you are looking for a quiet evening heres not the place.My boyfriend works in a steak house so he is very picky about his steak and he was very impressed. We ordered the the seafood platter for one and little neck clams for appetizers . I don't eat raw clams so I cant judge on them but the seafood platter was great. We also ordered the side dish of asparagus and cottage fries with our entree of the porterhouse for two.  For dessert we had the turtuffo. Our check was up there, but for the quality of food I believe it was worth it. After tax our total was $215.00. Service was good - friendly waiter. The only thing I can really say I didn't  like was the fact that the soda ( coca cola glass bottles ) were so small.. I know they do it in order to juice you for some more money but hey I guess thats a small price to pay for an amazing meal ! If your looking for a great steak with some yummy sides heres your place..

3.0,12/29/2008,"Ben and Jack's was good but let's down. This weekend we also ate at Bobby Van's and do have to say they were better. Ben and Jack's atmosphere was nice and traditional, but missed with some small things. For instance some of the lighting was out, they did a major re-arrangement of tables at prime time, and spilled a soda on our table - cleaned it up by just placing a napkin on the table. Although the steak was burned a bit on the outside and rare in the middle for medium, it was still pretty good.THE SUM-UP: An average up-scale steakhouse in Manhattan. Nothing too bad or above average.",3,1,1,Jason F.,"Beacon, NY",20,35,2
5.0,12/8/2008,"Let me lay it out up front. I prefer Ben and Jack's to Peter Luger. There, I said it. It all comes down to attitude. My experience with Ben and Jack's was positive from the get go. We had a party of 10 with an anniversary. The staff was very patient and very accommodating. Although part of our party ran late, they held our table with no qualms. At the end of the meal, they quickly and furtively brought a platter of desserts surrounding a colossal dollop of schlag (say that five times fast) and sang to our anniversarians. Food: Appetizers Beefsteak Tomato and Onion -Hard to screw this up. Tomato slices were uniform and the tomatoes themselves were as ripe as you get in late fall. Beefsteak Caprese - A nice departure from the usual steakhouse menu and the mozzarella was nice and creamy. Bacon - Mmmmmmm. Bacon (Homer Simpson)  Comparable to what you get at Lugers.  Soooo bad...Soooo good!Bread - sliced artisan loaf combined with onion rolls. Good but not as good as Peter Luger. Steak - Steaks for 2 and 3. Prepared simply. Cooked perfectly medium rare as requested. They were naturally flavorful and particularly juicy. Not much to say about a steak if someone has done it right. You just enjoy it. Sides - Steamed Broccoli and Steamed Asparagus were nice and firm without being undercooked. It is always great to have vegetables not swimming in fat at a steakhouse to give the illusion that something you're eating is healthy. German potatoes were a sinful hit, not too oily but a delectable mix of crisp and mushy and simply prepared with sauteed onion.  Wine - Admittedly overpriced, we had the Sonoma Cutrer Pinot Noir which matched nicely with its peppery overtones. It was smooth without being passive. Dessert: Served on a platter the size of a Medieval Shield, we had cheese cake, chocolate mousse cake, carrot cake and lime pie to name a few. Artery clogging schlag was irresistible. Our anniversarians, who are restaurateurs themselves, were elated which was more than enough for me. The decor is dark wood. There are many private rooms available. If you can't get a table at Peter Luger, if you don't want to go into Brooklyn, or if you want great steak and terrific service certainly give Ben and Jack's a try.",6,0,4,Chris C.,"New York, NY",218,367,17
5.0,11/30/2008,"I don't eat steak. (At this point, the steak aficionados might and should read on to the next review.) But I dated a guy for 8 years who was a bit of a steak snob. He loved Peter Luger more than me, which says a lot because I think I'm fairly lovable. So the year Steak-Man was in charge of organizing his company Christmas party, he picked Ben and Jack's. Ben and Jack's was created by two Luger's waiters and was supposed to be THE spot for a porterhouse steak. For weeks leading up to the Christmas party, I worried about the perfect outfit (which in the end didn't matter because this place is fairly casual) while he salivated looking at the menu. He booked Private Room 6, which they boast ""comes with a TV."" I'm pretty sure we had cartoons on and it's like a 12 inch tv...no big deal. We started with the seafood platter and sizzling bacon. You know how people judge the girlfriend at these company parties? Yeah, um, when it comes to bacon judge away, I don't care! Delicious! Next came the salads (completely unnecessary but I'll get to that later) and then the entrees. The boys got steak. The women got lobster. 4 POUND lobster to be exact! I got mine steamed with butter on the side - but the lobster itself was so sweet, no butter was desired. But a whole lobster is a mess...and there was no way I was going to crack juice on someone's face. So no problem, the waiter took it back to the kitchen, worked his magic, and out came my lobster ready for me to eat in a slightly less barbaric fashion. So the reason why I say salad is unnecessary is because of all the yummy veggie sides. We had creamed spinach, broccoli, and sauteed onions. I still think about that creamed spinach. Fries and onion rings were plentiful too. The dinner lasted a long time but the wait staff was amazing. Steak-Man got so intoxicated he insisted on Ben and Jack coming to the table so he could introduce himself and personally thank them with compliments for their waitstaff. Looking back, I think that was a little overzealous :) But the restaurant has such a Good Ol' Boys feel to it, I don't think they thought anything of this behavior.

4.0,11/15/2008,"Whoever it was that came up with the idea of -- get this -- bacon (!) as an appetizer should be canonized alongside Mother Theresa. Heck, bump her to the next slot and put the bacon man in there first!A friend was visiting from out of town for this week's Steak House excursion, which opened up some great possibilities. For one, we could splurge more on wine since we were splitting the bill. And we could order a traditional huge porterhouse for two that they serve pre-sliced from the bone. We went with a 2005 Cakebread Cab, for sentimental reasons, and had the steak medium rare. Of course, there was the bacon to start. Definitely not just for breakfast anymore, this bacon came unadorned and cut about a 1/4"" thick. It had the charred delightfulness that we would come to love in the steak, and was a perfect blend of crispy, chewy and melt-in-your-mouth tenderness. The danger with a bacon appetizer like that is that potentially the steak will be a let down. What cow product could compare with such bacony goodness, after all?? Ha. It really was just a lead-in to a magnificent steak. Tender, perfectly pink and poetically charred on the edges, the porterhouse was served on what I believe was the same sizzling plate that it came out of the oven on. The waiter had a way of touching each slice to the side of the plate for a dramatic ""crackle"" as he transferred each slice to our plates. Nice touch.This isn't just about meat and wine, however, and the German potatoes and creamed spinach were winners as well. The creamed spinach in particular was a treat (especially after last week's sampling at The Palm) -- it didn't look creamy but when it met the palate my friend described it as being like a spinach mousse (except without a gross texture). It was as intensely flavored as it was smooth and vibrantly green.Altogether, a great experience and one that I heartily (well, clogged-heartily) recommend.",0,0,0,Marcelo G.,"Santa Monica, CA",147,15,0

We had chopped tomatoes and onions to go with the bacon, and a little bit of their steak sauce.  The creamed spinach and potatoes with the steak were great too.The service was also polite and attentive.  I hear there are a lot of great steakhouses in NYC, but this one is going to be tough to beat.  Although I look forward to trying to find one better!  I would love to try the Ribeye and some of that lobster that looks so good on the menu.",0,0,0,Daniel L.,"West Covina, CA",188,121,2011

See, here is the big secret, people think of steaks as an expensive dinner, but compared to many other fancy meals you might have in the city, it's actually not that bad in comparison. (Though still costly on absolute terms.) See, a meal at a place like Per Se or an all out Omakase at a high end sushi place could easily be over $200 a person. How? This happens when you order some exotic fish that's $12 a piece. On the other hand, you can fit two people into a budget of not too much more than $100 at a place like Ben & Jack's. In the end, you still got to have a fancy meal with your date and it won't hurt you in the pocket book nearly as much!!!!The server was attentive, but it's not so fun when you see them smoke right outside the restaurant.DO NOT get the seafood/shrimp appetizer... it's not that good.

5.0,4/21/2007,"Family just fly in from out of town? Too banged up from last night to slog it to Williamsburg for a steak? This is a good place to take them. We walked in just after 5pm (when they open-Sunday) and got a table. They have one of the best Caesar salads in NYC, a whole ramekin full of anchovies in oil..!  A great way to get on my 'good side'. (a Caesar without anchovies is not a Caesar, but instead a fraud.)The porterhouses were done great..served just like you know who. A whole variety of 'potato options'. The 'German potato' is like thick cut hash browns..sehr gut!  And the asparagus and sauteed mushrooms were excellent.This place is good and the location is great. A few blocks from Grand Central and there is a parking garage next door too, if you are driving..",3,3,3,Jay G.,"New York, NY",18,322,372
5.0,4/15/2007,"Having been to Peter Luger's a few times, I decided to try this offspring steakhouse and thought it was very comparable to Luger's.  The place is more formal than Luger's - most of the guys were in button down shirts, some have a jacket and tie - but the steak was just as great.  I started with the bacon, then had the steak for two with a side of cream spinach and aspargus.  The canadian bacon was very good.  The steak was perfectly medium rare, the cream spinach was a little more spinach than cream, so I felt healthier eating it.  The asparagus stalks were HUGE and very plainly steamed.  I saw others get the shrimp cocktail, steamed oysters and cottage fries and everyting looked very good.  The hot fudge sundae was enormous and I was tempted to try it, but couldn't even think about food when I was done eating.The service was very friendly and attentive.  If you like steak, there are few places better than this.",4,0,2,Silvio D.,"New York, NY",9,278,21
5.0,10/17/2006,"Very friendly and excellent food. Service you will always remember. Ben and Jack are often there --waiting on tables, hosting etc. Delicious steak and good sides. I saw a terrific video review of them on timeoutnewyork.tv. Captured the essence. Check it out and definitely check out the restaurant. The steak for 2,3, or 4 is the way to go.",3,0,3,John O.,"New York, NY",76,72,3
4.0,8/26/2006,"Ben & Jack's is a good steakhouse, but there are better ones close by for the same price.  I much prefer Spark's on 46th or the Capital Grill on 42nd.  Ben & Jack's don't have anything to compete with the 'Steak Fromage' found at Sparks.  I like the wedge salad at Capital Grill, but at Ben & Jack's they charge you $3.95 extra for blue cheese on your salad.  I had the key lime pie for dessert.  The fresh whipped cream on the side was great, but the pie was only average.",1,0,1,Brian E.,"New York, NY",16,132,220
4.0,5/24/2006,"STEAK for TWO OR MORE!!If you're a vegetarian steer clear of this place! The food here is amazing if you're a Meat and potatoes kind of person.  If you're looking to go to Peter Luger's but do not have any interest in trekking all the way out to Williamsburg the look no further than just around the corner from Grand Central Station, and across from the United Nations you just might find another place to call home.  Two brothers, who happened to get their start at Luger's, decided it was a time to have a place of their own. Jack and Russ Sinanaj and their cousin, Ben Sinanaj, opened Ben & Jack's Steakhouse on East 44th Street  between 2nd and 3rd Avenue.Attentive waiters, who are not overly stuck on themselves, casual clothes okay here.Romance Factor:  7Hobnob Potential:  3Destination Rating:  5Strong Suggestions:  (for you and a few other people) Steak for Two, German Potatoes, and the Mixed Green SaladLet downs:  (some of you may love this) For those of you who are not ""regulars""  The ""Ben and Jack's Salad"" is really not a salad -- if you like Shrimp, thick bacon, chunky raw tomatoes, and chunky raw onions you will like this ""salad."" I am allergic and couldn't go there, but everyone else seemed to enjoy it.  Wish they would have mentioned it had shrimp before I ordered it.The ""side"" of Asparagus only comes with 6 Stalks, not as big as the ones at Morton's, and at $8.75 for a side of Asparagus I would think that they wouldn't be so stingy.NOTE: Beware, medium rare is on the RARE side -- you should probably just ask for medium and omit the word rare, you will be much happier.",9,2,7,Megan C.,"New York, NY",4019,835,1062
