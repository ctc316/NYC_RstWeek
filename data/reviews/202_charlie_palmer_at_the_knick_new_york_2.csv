4.0,1/4/2019,I came here with coworkers for a year end lunch celebration. Our group had a vegan and he was able to select from a number of dishes that could be made vegan friendly. I had the swordfish and I thought it was delicious! The vine could have been a bit better but I can understand having a sit down lunch at a hotel in Times Square night not be a top choice unless you're staying at the hotel,0,0,0,Marcy M.,"New York, NY",136,141,344
4.0,1/4/2019,"Went for the pre theatre dinner. The ambiance was great, and we were seated promptly. The waitress was great for our party of eight, and the food came quickly with no problems. The food was just average. I had the aglonotti while others in my group had the filet, burger stack, and Tagliatelle. Both burgers said they wished they got something else as did the Tagliatelle. My aglonotti was delicious but the portion was tiny which was disappointing. The best part of the meal was the mussels that we shared as a table and the drinks. Overall, it was efficient for what we needed, but I probably wouldn't go back any time soon.",1,0,0,Maggie F.,"Gainesville, FL",90,57,64
5.0,12/26/2018,Was looking for an upscale place for a nice Christmas meal with my wife and found Charlie Palmer at the Knick. Being fans of Metrazur and Aureole we felt confident in quality of food and service. The fois gras was phenomenal as well as the crab stuffed lobster. We were served by an attentive friendly server named Ganye. Also had the pleasure of meeting Chef Matt during our meal. The place is spacious and comfortable.

3.0,10/5/2018,"You walk out of the elevators and welcomed by highly designed balance of negative and positive space.  There is a high level of sophistication (which correlates to high ceilings) that is unheard of so close to the heart of Times Square.  All of a sudden there are no tourists to be found and I'm hoping I can still get it with since I didn't where a blazer to work that day. The portions here are huuuuge.  Wait... I mean the plates they serve the food here are huuuuge.  The portions are delicately place in the center and then built vertically so you kind of feel like you're playing Jenga.  But in all seriousness the crab and steak here are great and quality is about right for what you pay but I eat 2000 calories a day (normal range BMI).  While I did enjoy the ambiance and experience of Charlie Palmer I just had to have a 2nd lunch.  Drink here, enjoy the space but if you're hungry go elsewhere.  Or go here and then go somewhere else like I did.",0,0,0,Jae J.,"New York, NY",87,89,28
2.0,10/3/2018,"We ate at this restaurant because it was close to the theatre. We ordered pre-theatre dinner, 3 courses for $45. That was the good part. Beet salad was mostly soggy greens & no flavor.

3.0,8/13/2018,"Went there for restaurant week. It's a nice place, we ordered the aglnotti (hope I got the spelling right) and the swordfish. The mains portions were very small, I only got 2 small slices of swordfish (each slice was like the piece of fish they put on top of sushi) and I was a little upset with it. The plating was very pretty but the fish was bland and there was a slight bitterness. The rest of the dishes were also pretty small and we thought that there wasn't much to rave about. We also paid $5 for a small cup of iced tea.",0,0,0,Kendra C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",21,6,5
3.0,8/12/2018,I was a bit disappointed.Soup was too salty while the crab wrapped in woven cucumber purse was bland and needed salt.The steak was okay but the sauce was a bit concentrated in some parts of the dish. The chocolate cake was a moist cake with chocolate frosting but I could not taste the orange infused cream on top.   I was also envisioning the chocolate meringue bigger than the sliver I got on top.The ambience was spectacular!  Unfortunately I cannot eat it.,1,1,1,Bing R.,"New York, NY",149,544,3265
5.0,8/9/2018,"Since it was restaurant week, I selected the $42 price fixe menu. I started with the crab and cucumber salad. It was fresh and crisp on this hot summer day with succulent sweet crab. Next I had the anglotti with goat cheese and pesto. The pasta was perfectly aldente while the creamyness of the goat cheese paired well with the earthy mushrooms. To conclude I had the decadent chocolate mouse cake which was rich with flavor. The atmosphere was amazing! Exactly what I'm looking for in a dining experience with impeccable service.

So - what do you do if you must go if you want to see a show on B'way and would like to have a 'pre theater meal' ? Well, a) you don't have your meal around Times Sq or b) you go to The Knick. Quiet , somewhat romantic , away from the crowds. Food selection and service is catered to the theater crowd , speedy delivery of meals but def not feeling rushed.

3.0,3/21/2018,"**400th Review**Charlie Palmer at the Knick would not be my first choice for review milestone. But if life has taught me anything, it's that the universe has its own plan that I'm not privy to, so I'm basically just along for the ride. I have to say, I was a bit nervous before dining here. The reviews are mixed at best, and when I glanced at the menu, everything seemed to be wildly overpriced. There are a lot of fabulous hotel restaurants in the city--restaurants you'd likely seek out even if you weren't a hotel guest. Narcissa, Ferris, the Nomad, to name a few. Charlie Palmer, on the other hand, is not a place I'd recommend going out of your way for. It is, thankfully, an okay option if you are indeed staying at the Knickerbocker. Yes, it's expensive, but the food isn't bad. Everything we tried was pretty decent, though fairly uninspired. If you have friends or family staying here and they'd prefer not to leave the building for dinner, this is a viable option. Came here at around 7pm on a Sunday night. The bf had family in town, and said family needed to stay local. I foolishly thought we'd need a reservation, but the place was eerily empty. The space itself is nice enough. Large, as you'd expect, cushy chairs, somewhat corporate-feeling. Drink-wise, I'd recommend going with wine. The cocktails here are $24, which is absolutely absurd. Good cocktails in the city are already expensive, averaging about $15 a nice spot, so this is just outrageous. And there's nothing special about them anyway. The wines by the glass, however, are a bit more reasonable and there's a decent selection. I had a delicious Riesling and the bf had a Grenache/Syrah that was tasty too. Both in the teens, price-wise.Because we ate earlier than we typically do, the bf and I didn't ball out too much with ordering. I also knew that this wasn't the place to splurge, which turned out to be correct. That said, my low expectations did ultimately leave me pleasantly surprised. Though the food was, as I mentioned, uninspired, the flavors were decent and everything was cooked well. Nothing impressed me but nothing was bad. A few interesting elements but you won't see anything adventurous. Eats, below:Grilled Octopus w/ Saffron-Chili Foam, Roasted Cauliflower: B-Pretty boring, but thankfully they didn't flop on the execution. The octopus wasn't rubbery but didn't have that crispy, meaty texture I like so much, either. The saffron-chili foam was a nice touch and added some good flavor. Garnished with chilled cauliflower/tomato salad, which was so-so-.Beef Tartare w/ Chive Aioli, Crispy Purple Potatoes, Mache Salad: B-Nothing special. Nice presentation, the chive aioli was interesting though I got more of a horseradish flavor than chive. I tend to see horseradish used often in beef tartare preparations, so it wouldn't surprise me if there was some of that in here too. Always good to have some crunch with tartare for texture, so glad to see they added that element. Icelandic Cod w/ Bean Cassoulet, Tokyo Turnips, Blue Potatoes: BWell-cooked, served in some nice broth. I enjoyed the turnips and radishes but could've done without the beans. That said, I usually could do without beans. There were only about three, small, blue potatoes that made it onto the plate, so it seemed they were simply there to punctuate the overall aesthetic with some colorCharred Broccolini: BCan't complain. A little greasy, but tasty. Hard to seriously mess this up. I'm a sucker for charred veggies. I'm not sure why, but our waiter brought us a complimentary round of drinks at the end of the meal. We didn't ask for them nor did we really want another drink, but we all appreciated the thought. Perhaps it was a reward for being one of two whole parties dining at the restaurant on this particular night.",5,3,3,Molly T.,"New York, NY",887,463,1480
2.0,3/14/2018,"Womp womp womp....Charlie Palmer at the Knick is thoroughly unimpressive. The ambiance is pleasant enough. I appreciated the hostess who made sure our party found each other. I also liked the chain link curtains that surrounded some of the lounge tables. But once you get past all of that it's kind of just a hotel restaurant trying really hard to be an upscale dining experience.The meal:We were out celebrating my mother's birthday and they were kind enough to bring out a glass of prosecco for her. Beautiful, nice touch. She's not much of a drinker, so I got to enjoy it, clutch. Another dining companion was pleasantly surprised by their selection of beers. They brought out bread. I've noticed a number of reviews mentioning stale/dry bread. It was good bread. I have no complaints on that front.Two of us ordered off the pre-theater menu, even though the clock had just struck 6:30 when we placed our order. Our server was kind enough to let us slide though. While all in all our server was quite friendly and accommodating, I did have two quasi-awkward interactions with him where he kind of questioned me and it stuck in my craw. First, for my main I ordered the chicken breast and he immediately said ""oh nooo, that's not on the pre-fixe."" I turned to him and pointed to it on the menu. ""Oops, my mistake."" K, cool. Then later on I ordered a glass of muscadet, ""we don't have that."" ""What do you mean?"" ""We don't carry that."" ""I just read it off the wine menu, did you run out?"" ""Oh, a muscadet, I thought you meant moscato."" Small things that just rubbed me the wrong way. Why is his first impulse to question me instead of doing his homework or asking me to repeat myself? Not my fave.For starters we ordered:The blue crab tomato bisque - the soup was delicious. Rich, but not too heavy. It had nice large chunks of mussels and a piece of shrimp. It tasted crabby, but I don't think I had any actual chunks of crab. Still on my good list.Onion, goat cheese, shitake mushroom flatbread - super yummy.  Really good.San marzano, basil, mozzarella flatbread - so disappointing. Yes, it's simple, but the simple things should really be able shine on a shmancy kind of menu. This had rubbery cheese and presentationally wasn't nice to look at. And it just didn't taste great. Why bother?Fried chicken - was my boyfriend's favorite dish of the evening. The paprika is really a forward tasting flavor in the mix, so beware. The chicken was good, but a bit greasy. The spicy mayo it's served with is nice, felt more apropos for Japanese restaurant.Salt-Baked Beet Salad - this was my favorite of the meal. It comes with plums and cheese. It was excellent. Everything worked really well together.Mains:Housemade Tagliatelle - This disappeared from my dining companions plate so quickly, it was mad. I assume he liked it well enough.Pecorino Risotto - Mentioned that it was chalky.Chicken Breast - this is what I ordered. It comes with mushrooms and roasted potatoes according to the menu. It came with soppy mushrooms and a potato pancake/hashbrown that was so incredibly salt that I couldn't stomach it. The chicken itself was fine. Nothing noteworthy.New York Strip - The steak is always the safe order for me. You can't mess up a steak too badly. Charlie Palmer's proved me wrong. Here's what I can say for it, the pureed potatoes were scrumptious. I would swim in a vat of them. Delicious. The sauteed spinach, also excellent. But the steak just didn't taste that good, very sad.Desserts:Duck Creme Brulee with a blood orange sorbet - the sorbet didn't taste like blood orange, I would've guessed it was more of a mandarin orange flavor... But the brulee was good. Fine.Chocolate tart - a little salty. Nothing exceptional.Almond Cake - good ice cream. barely any cherry on the dish.",1,0,0,Katie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",144,220,20

2.0,2/4/2018,"I took advantage of the restaurant week deal to try out this restaurant. To me there are many components to dining. The service,the environment, and the food. The food was excellent. My gal pal and I ordered steak tartare. My gal pal ordered the Scottish salmon and I ordered the wiener schinitzel of Berkshire pork. Pounded thin and fried to perfection. Tender n moist. The salmon was fresh and cooked perfectly. We both ordered the duck egg creme brûlée with blood orange sorbet. The sorbet was a little tart but combined with the brûlée and it worked. The environment was modern but a bit noisy. The service took off three stars. When we arrived at 5:30pm, there was two tables occupied. Manager greeted us at table offered us the menus. I was asked if we were going to the theater. I said I was in no rush. Five minutes later the waiter appeared and asked if we like would some drinks and I ordered two cocktails. He asked if we ready to ordered and I said yes. My drinks arrived in  5 mins or less. I took a few sips of my drink and my steak tartare arrived. Less than 5 mins after my drinks arrived at table the appetizers arrived wow. Ok maybe it was pre made and it was easy to serve. After we finished our appetizer, our salmon and pork arrived in 5 mins or less. Now I feel rushed. I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio and it did not arrived until I was almost finished with my pork. What can else can go wrong ? They double charged me on the wine. These errors ruin a dining experience.",0,0,0,Kevin L.,"FLUSHING, NY",49,126,191
5.0,1/29/2018,"We came here for dinner before the Aladdin show and absolutely loved it! Everything we ordered was amazing and not a single morsel was left on the plates. They have a great pre-theater menu that $45/person if i'm not mistaken (appetizer, entree and dessert). We ordered off the a la cart menu just because some of the entrees spoke to us more. The beef tartare is perfectly seasoned and dressed with a light micro-green salad. The 12 hr roasted beef cheeks are fork tender and come on a bed of creamy polenta and root vegetables. They have a house made tagliatelle pasta that is divine - the texture is different but amazing. For dessert we shared a profiterole (pretty big) that was the perfect way to end a delicious dinner. Ambiance and decor is modern and romantic - perfect place to celebrate or have a date night. The service was superb! Everyone was nice, respectful and paid attention to everything - nothing to complain about at all. If I was a NY resident I would definitely be visiting there again. The location right at the heart of Times Square makes it convenient to eat and then go enjoy a show or explore the area.",1,0,0,Jesmin N.,"Plano, TX",119,444,1134
3.0,1/28/2018,"We came to lunch at Charlie Palmer for restaurant week. First off, our server was phenomenal. She had very decisive and excellent recommendations and answered all of our questions. The food itself was very good, but honestly not all that memorable.  For the first course I went with the potato soup which was my favorite dish of the meal. It was smooth and creamy with a lovely garnish of smoked trout and cubes of radish for texture. For my main I got the salmon, which was perfectly cooked and seasoned. It came with Brussels sprouts and a creamy celery root purée. I tried my friends pork dish, it was a huge portion which is surprising for this kind of restaurant but I found the texture of the fried pork a bit off putting-kind of gritty almost? I'm not sure what they did to get it to that texture but I wasn't a fan. For dessert, I had the duck egg creme brûlée served with blood orange sorbet. The creme brûlée was richer with the duck eggs and really delicious. The problem however, was the crackly sugar crust was not torched properly- there were still whole sugar crystals like they only half caramelized the topping. The blood orange sorbet was very tart and provided a contrast for the rich creme brûlée but I didn't know how well they went together. I don't think the sorbet was needed. My friend got the chocolate cake as her dessert-honestly it tasted like something you'd find in a grocery store bakery, very dry and bland, big miss there.Overall, I enjoyed my meal, but I don't feel like I need to ever come back.",3,0,0,Taylor P.,"Mays Landing, NJ",183,101,226
1.0,1/26/2018,"Charlie Palmer might seriously consider hiring vagrants from Times Square to come serve Big Macs in his restaurant, because that would be an immense improvement on what was the worst meal we've ever had.  These were crappy ingredients prepared haphazardly to the point of tasting disgusting.  No exaggeration, no hyperbole.  This was food unfit to serve the homeless.  This place should be shut down before anyone else has to eat their crap.The hostess was doing double duty at the coat check and it took way too long to get her attention, let alone get a table.  Fine. No big deal.  The live combo playing at the bar was playing so loudly we couldn't hear our tablemates.  Fine. No big deal. Focaccia on the table stale? No worries, none of us eats much bread anyway.And then we ordered drinks.  Dirty martinis came out tasting like soap and pickle juice, not vodka and olive juice.  They were sent back for new drinks, which didn't taste much better.  Literally, it tasted like they washed the glass out with soap and forgot to rinse the soap.  And I'm not kidding.  Our group has eaten at some of Michelin's most renowned restaurants, and this place had the gustatory ambience of an inner city high school kitchen dishing out slop.  One glass of wine (the end of the bottle) had obviously been sitting in their fridge long enough to oxidize and become undrinkable.And then the meal.  Not a single one of us could stomach more than a few bites of our appetizers.  Someone had great ideas making a menu, but every single food choice we ordered was lacking or just tasted plain awful.  The flatbread was burnt and chemical tasting, like someone threw it in the oven while washing it.  The octopus was fishy and so overcooked that it flaked on the plate.  The market salad wilted but drenched in vinegar in an attempt to disguise the fact that it shouldn't have been sold. Main courses likewise.  The burger was a tiny piece of meat so densely packed with relish that one could only taste the pickle.  Which was good, because the meat was badly cooked and accompanied by a side of fries that looked and tasted sad.  Presentation on the plate? Ha. The risotto, bland and uninspiring, looked like someone dumped a pile of rice on a plate (shouldn't it be in a shallow bowl?).  There was literally no dish that impressed us, and we all left disgusted and disappointed.Adding insult to injury, the service was a joke.  Waitstaff barely believed that we didn't like the soapy cocktail, and it took the manager getting involved before he realized that something was wrong. He discounted the meal but it was still a heavy price to pay for food we couldn't actually stomach. Either the waiter didn't care, or he was in on the gig and realized just how horrible it was and didn't want to be in the firing line. Charlie, whoever you are, please shut this place down.  Homeless shelters serve better tasting food.",1,2,0,Josh R.,"Port Washington, NY",0,33,0

The men inside these elegant stockades had the look of a bunch of nicely suited cattle.  As for the restaurant, I found the menu singularly unappealing.  Several of the items that were listed on the website were not available, such as the smoked salmon.  It also seemed a heavy menu for summer, short ribs, squid ink pasta, Spanish mackerel and the like.  We asked the waitstaff if we could order the flatbread from the bar menu and ended up having that.  It was quite good.  We then ordered berry desserts which were fine.

4.0,7/31/2017,"Came here for restaurant week lunch with my sister. Located on the fourth floor of the Knickerbocker Hotel, this restaurant is a pleasant surprise. The restaurant has modern furniture and decoration, though very gray-toned one. The seating is spacious and comfortable with hanging metal curtains to create division between tables.My sister and I came for a 12pm reservation and were seated promptly. There were two other tables there at the time, and the restaurant was almost full by the time we left around 1:30. For the pre-fixe I got heirloom tomato , squid ink pasta, and almond cake. The app was good, mozzarella and tomatoes tasted fresh. The main was pretty sizable, by the time I was done, I was stuffed. It came with a good amount of squid and some small mussels. The dessert is always the best and this restaurant was no exception. My almond cake was light and airy and went well with the ice cream. My sister got the gazpacho, bone-in short rib, and the apple strudel. There was no bone in the short rib, and I thought the two pieces were kinda small. The apple strudel has a beautiful presentation. I thought the strudel was lacking a bit, but the salted caramel ice cream that it came with was good!The service was a bit slow, but overall very attentive.

2.0,1/11/2017,"Having enjoyed this restaurant previously on multi occasions, I chose it to celebrate a special birthday this past Monday night. What has happened here?  Nothing about the dinner is the way I would think Charlie Palmer would want to represent himself.Service was quick and abrupt, food was served cold including a medium well burger that came out rare (pretty simple to execute I would think) and when dishes were sent back the wait was long and really took away our enjoyment of the food.  On a positive note, I must commend the manager who was working that night for going out of his way to more than make up for multi disappointments. Oh, on my return later that evening I was served by an extremely rude and argumentative bartender. The icing on the cake! Overall, I think there are current problems that need to be addressed to meet expectations of a restaurant of this caliber.   Take some lessons from Aureole.",1,0,0,Sherri M.,"Union, NJ",0,28,0

I have to say the restaurant does not match this 5 star hotel.

I'm in the restaurant business so I understand that things go wrong and people make mistakes,  but almost everything went wrong and almost everyone made mistakes. The food was cold,  overdone and overpriced. The menu is limited at best. They do however,  have a fairly decent wine list but expect to pay a location based premium of around 20-30%.

3.0,10/3/2016,"Went to Charlie Palmer after a Broadway show. Arrived at 5:30 to an ety restaurant. The decor is very modern and quite attractive. The hostess was amiable, and seated us. Surprisingly, we were seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant, away from the views of Times Square.Menu was limited but good (no specials.) appetizers were appropriately sized, but one was missing the requested steak addition. The entrees were good (not exceptional), and were somewhat smaller than expected.Price was higher than expected for the quality and quantity. One unexpected surprise: we were charged $4 extra per drink for each whiskey. Also, while service was acceptable, the 18% automatic addition to the bill removed some of the flexibility a diner typically has when decided a gratuity.One plus: there was only one other couple in the restaurant, but it was fun to engage with them later in the evening.",2,0,0,Ed G.,"Pelham, NY",0,8,0

4.0,8/5/2016,"We came here for a friend's birthday dinner. I was a bit reluctant about the choice given the location (I try to avoid Time Square at all cost) and the poor Yelp rating. However, I am happy to report that my concerns were unfounded. The restaurant is located at the heart of Time Square, on the fourth floor of The Knick Hotel, but it is  like a calming oasis amid the craziness that is Time Square. The only reminder that you are actually in Time Square is the flashing light peeking out from the curtain from a giant billboard across the street.  Sitting in the restaurant, you can't hear the loud street traffic and shielded from most of the obnoxious lights coming from millions of billboards in the area. I love the beautiful stems of orchid on each table and the unobtrusive lamp that provides the perfect mood lightening.  Last but not least, the food is pretty good!  It definitely exceeded my expectations. Since there were six of us, we decided to just order two of each dishes on the restaurant week menu. The portion was perfect and we got to try all 8 dishes. Mache and Hijiki Salad - my least favorite dish, nothing really stood out from this salad dish, although it was a good complement to the pork belly dish. On its own, I don't see the merit of ordering this dish unless you are a vegetarian Kampachi Ceviche - my favorite dish! It consisted the perfect combination of spiciness from the peppers, tartness from vinegar, and sweetness from the melon. The fish tasted fresh, but I wish it was sliced thinner. Overall, this dish knocked it out of the park. Smoked Pork Belly - another flavor bomb, it was a decadent dish with a generous portion (for an appetizer) of pork belly. The dish on its own can be quite heavy, particularly the thick BBQ sauce, but it went extremely well with the Hijiki salad. Sweet Corn Risotto - I probably would not have ordered this dish if I can only pick one main dish.  However, I am glad we did. This was actually my favorite entree. The risotto was cooked perfectly, which is a feat in itself. The corn was subtle, but noticeable. And the pesto was the perfect addition. It was flavorful and creamy without being too heavy. Seared Scallops - the scallops were cooked well, but I wasn't a huge fan of the tomato sauce, I thought it was too salty. Braised Short Rib - the ribs were braised to the point that you can easily tear it apart with your fork, but not to the point that it is mushy. I like the seasoning on the ribs and the pimento grits were heavenly. However, I think it might be too rich/heavy for one person to finish. Peach Cobbler - I thought the cobbler itself was way too sweet, but the sweet corn ice cream was pretty yummy. I would order the ice cream on its own. Smores - OMG, it was sooooooooo goooooood! We abandoned all decorum, picked up the giant stack of something that resembles a fancy smores by hand, and proceeded to chow down.  It was as if a five star chef visited your camp and made you a special treat. The accompanied ice cream was also fantastic with bits of cocoa nibs and marshmallows. The service was great, unobtrusive yet attentive. Since we were sharing, they made sure to place the duplicate dishes on the opposite end of the table so that we won't have to pass them around. The restaurant menu price was quite reasonable at $42. However, the drinks were quite pricey as cocktails were mostly $18, and the wine list by the glass was not very impressive, particularly given the price they were charging. I've tried the Stingray, which was terrible. The server warned me beforehand that it would be spicy, which I normally love. However, it wasn't spicy in the jalapeño infused alcohol type of way. Instead, it was just a lot of crushed red pepper dumped into the drink, which was kind of bizarre.  I would recommend skipping the drinks or just stick with the classic martini. Overall, it was a fun night out with my girlfriends. The food was definitely above average and the setting was beautiful. Another bonus for choosing this restaurant, you don't have to scream across the table to be heard, it was very classy :)",2,0,0,Kat J.,"Jersey City, NJ",137,196,1246
4.0,8/4/2016,My friends and I had a great experience here tonight.  We don't ordinarily choose restaurants in this area (hectic/chaotic Time Sq)  but inside the restaurant was relaxed and pleasant. We were a group of six and decided to try all the items off the restaurant week menu. All the dishes were visually beautiful and they were all delicious. My favorites of the night were kampachi ceviche and smoked pork belly appetizers. Short rib with grits and risotto entrees were really yummy! The icecream that came with the peach cobbler was interesting in a good way. We stayed there well after we were done with our meal and they didn't make us feel pressured to pay the check and leave. That was nice. :),1,0,0,S. P.,"Manhattan, NY",22,30,52
4.0,8/2/2016,"Don't know if we just hit a good night, but we enjoyed our dinner here. Beautiful space and cool bar. NYC prices but they have a nice prosecco for $10 and a Tempranillo for $12. Very good and friendly service, except we did have to ask water dude to send over waiter for drinks reorder. But, he was very knowledgeable about the menu. Menu must change frequently since I don't recognize many dishes reviewed here. Fried chokes were good but wish I had gone with the cauliflower. Veal meatballs were terrific and substantial. In a steak mood, we ordered both the steaks. Skirt steak with chimichurri was great as was the beef tenderloin. Prices are in line with other fine dining or maybe a bit less. Salmon sounded fab. Chocolate bread pudding was not too sweet with a great angliese sauce and the pavlova was pretty good too.

2.0,2/20/2016,"Had a company team lunch here. Walking in, you get the impression that the food will blow you away; it's located on the 4th floor of a well-hidden hotel, hidden almost as if on purpose. Walking up to the restaurant feels like you're part of an exclusive club, which is cool and all. But when it comes down to the food, I was let down. I ordered the skirt steak salad, which came with 3 slices of steak on lettuce. Lettuce? The cheapest and least nutritional green? And you didn't even add anything to it, say tomatoes or cheese or dressing? Okay. This dish was not worth $26. We also ordered the banana Napoleon cake. But it isn't even a cake!!! It's just 3 pieces of thin wafers with bananas and sugar in between them. It's also small (waitress said it would be enough for five people but it wasn't even enough for two) and very awkward to share. It breaks apart as soon as you take a spoon to it. Skip this dessert.

3.0,12/8/2015,"I really want to love this place, but at the moment I just ""like"" it. The location and atmosphere is beautiful and sets a upper class dining experience vibe. From the minute I walked in there was a ton of confusion from from the front of the house to even the wait staff. Within the first 10 minutes of being seated my guest and I had two different waiters, clueless that they were double shifting our table. I had to ask one waiter as to why we had two waiters, she was unaware. Finally we ended up having one waiter who was very attentive and awesome. My guest and I ordered the fried chicken share plate and the meatballs. Portioned absolutely perfectly and tasted great. The only comment I have is I was chicken in hand when the bus boy just walked over and cleared out appetizers. We weren't even finished .. I don't understand that logic considering the dining room was empty. For dinner my guest had the short ribs she said were absolutely delicious, I had the steak frites. I ordered my steak rare, and it was cooked beautifully. Only puzzled on the fact the chef had put the wrong sauce on my dish giving me hollandaise... Very confused. From what I've witnessed tonight it's very disorganized and could be a confusing and stressful experience. The food was good but I would like a little more flavor and the correct sauce. I will return due to my amazing waiter and atmosphere , but in a city like Manhattan with thousands of restaurants, it's important to have structure and organization. Especially for expensive prices, people want to be wined and dined comfortably. Hope this review helps.",1,0,0,Jennifer L.,"Manhattan, NY",6,89,14
