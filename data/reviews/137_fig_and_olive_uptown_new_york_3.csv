5.0,4/29/2019,I always wanted to eat at F&O and I'm glad my husband took me there. Service was excellent! Marco Cvetkovic was an amazing manager who took his time to educated us on the food and the sauces. The balsamic vinegar was out of this world and the olive oil infused with blood orange was delicious. Will be back again!,0,0,0,Millie R.,"Bronx, NY",1,7,0
5.0,4/27/2019,"What a fun and fresh spot tucked in a neighborhood on the upper east side! Uptown? If that nomenclature is wrong it's because I'm from Texas. Anywho, after walking through the Guggenheim and walking around Central Park we worked up a major appetite. This place came highly recommended and did not disappoint. This place is cozy but still has great natural light. Boyfriend and I shared a bottle of wine and took our time :)He enjoyed the avocado toast - tons of added flavor with tomatoes, quail egg and radish. I devoured the fig & olive salad + salmon on top. Perfectly cooked salmon and a decent size portion. This place is not cheap by any means, but we really enjoyed it. Also it's in NYC so..",0,0,0,Lauren T.,"Dallas, TX",15,97,178

4.0,2/8/2019,"Restaurant Week Review: Fig & OliveWhen I reserved, I had intended to come here for a late Restaurant Week Lunch. After I found out that their dinner menu starts before 3:40pm, I switched to a single entree. Decor: It is nice, but not pretentious.  An array of delicious smells tapped my nose the second I walked in. There's a bar just inside the door that stretched almost the length of the restaurant, though the second half (far side the bar) of it is in front of a searing table. It's a narrow restaurant, so the bar takes up one half of the restaurant, while the other is  a single row of booth and wicker chairs. I sat at the bar. En lieu of paintings, I noticed that they had framed some olive branches to hang on the walls.Service: Friendly. The host and the waitresses/waiters are was a brief wait when I first walked in, but it wasn't more than a minute. Food: Fig and Olive gives each customer a plate containing a few bread with a tri-square plate containing olive oil and delicious balsamic vinegar to start.  I ordered the cauliflower risotto, which was topped with fried sliced garlic and parsley. It was creamy and delicious.",0,0,0,Lauren D.,"New York, NY",44,184,86
3.0,1/27/2019,"We've been to 2 of their locations in NYC - uptown and fifth ave for dinner and the food is excellent but let me tell you their service leaves much to be desired. Last night in the uptown location we were celebrating 2 birthdays. We called ahead and asked them to put a candle on their deserts- she said she would put it on the reservation and then after we arrived I spoke with a woman there who seemed to be a mgr to remind her about that. She said she would make sure yet 5 minutes later the desserts arrived - no candles. Our waiter didn't have a clue about it and it wasn't crowded, no excuse.He also brought the bill without the credit card we gave him- we sent him back. They are disorganized. Check their website. They advertise Sunday live jazz brunch but it doesn't say which location. Under ""Featured Music"" they have bands listed for only October - it is now January. Once we learned which one has the jazz, I couldn't make a brunch reservation online - it only gives you evening times, but they do not have the phone numbers for the individual locations on the site, just one number. I had to look up the number on google so I could call to make a reservation for the Sunday brunch, but when I called back 10 mins later to change the time he could not find our initial reservation. Come on guys- it's the 21st century- you are a formidable restaurant with several locations - you need to get your act together!  Give good service, get someone to fix your website and keep it updated- pay attention! Provide a candle for a birthday, stuff that good restaurants do!",1,0,0,Robin F.,"Pawling, NY",0,2,0
5.0,12/31/2018,"TLDR: The portions are smaller and on the more expensive side. However, the food and service are very well executed. Great place for a special occasion! Overall rating: AMade an easy OpenTable reservation last Friday 12/28 for 5:30pm. I came here for my 8 year anniversary celebration before an opera. It was a really stellar meal! We weren't sure how good it would be because it's a mini chain, but they far exceeded our expectations. The restaurant is located down a couple of steps so it's away from the hustle and bustle of midtown. Inside is brightly lit, quiet, and romantic. A rare find these days. I didn't feel rushed at all. Our waiter was wonderful and checked on us enough without making us feel smothered. I especially appreciated not feeling pressured to order an appetizer! Here's what we got:-Complimentary rosemary bread with 3 dips: Spanish olive oil, blood orange olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. A+-MEDITERRANEAN TASTING (Grilled Shrimp, Rosemary Lamb Chops, Caramelized Pumpkin & Chestnut Risotto.) $36: It came with 2 flavorful lamb chop pieces, cooked perfectly medium rare as requested, with a delicious crispy exterior. The 4 plump shrimps on a skewer were wonderful as well. The caramelized pumpkin & chestnut risotto was a delight. It was topped with pumpkin seeds so there was a nice texture contrast. There was also a side of sauteed cabbage with raisins, which wasn't my favorite. A+-BALSAMIC GLAZED SHORT RIB (Crispy Polenta, Frisée Salad, Lardons of Smoked Bacon, Sherry Bacon Vinaigrette.) $37: So good! The short rib was falling apart! The crispy polenta looked like big fries and were good as well. A-CHAMPS DE FRAISES(Sparkling Wine with Strawberry Confiture,Citrus Bitters & Earl Grey Tea) $12: This was my least favorite out of everything. It was VERY floral. I don't like floral food/drinks. My S.O. thinks it was the bergamot in the earl grey tea and she loved this drink. Everything else in the drink was good. Just wish it wasn't so floral. Just a personal preference. B-CHOCOLATE OBSESSION (Whipped Truffle Ganache, Chocolate Obsession Cake, Raspberry & Chocolate Glaze.) $14: This was amazing! The raspberry & chocolate glaze are just decoration on the plate BTW. The cake was so moist! The chocolate was high quality. It wasn't too sweet. If you love chocolate, this is the perfect dessert for you! A+My S.O. was equally impressed with this restaurant! The portions are smaller and on the more expensive side. However, the food and service are very well executed. Great place for a special occasion! FYI: Bathrooms are located down a flight of steps too. So not mobility impaired friendly unfortunately. 2 single stall bathrooms with a shared communal sink. I would definitely come back again for future celebrations!",0,0,0,D D.,"Manhattan, NY",4,143,27
4.0,12/28/2018,"I came here for lunch with a large group and had a great time. We came at rush hour and the small dinning room was packed. We did have to wait a bit for our table but management comped us some appetizers for the wait.  I had the crostini tasting and it was fantastic -my favorite was the goat cheese and the caramelized onion. It was a very tasty and fresh bite as we waited for my meal. My main was the seafood paella noir made with squid ink. It was the most intriguing looking meal I have ever had. The shrimp was caramelized and cooked well and the scallops were very fresh. It was a good meal that was very filling. I had for dessert the pot de cream that was very rich but I recommend the dessert sampler my friend had that has small bites of sorbet, mousse cake and a tiny version of the pot de cream. The Rivera salmon was very popular with my table as well and had rave reviews.",0,0,0,Anita R.,"SOUTH RICHMOND HILL, NY",32,10,5
2.0,12/24/2018,This was not our first time visiting their restaurants as we have visited the meatpacking location before and were blown away by how great it was. We came to the uptown location as we were staying at a hotel close by. I have to say I will never visit that location again and to be honest if it was my first time dining at any fig and olive I would never return. Let me start by saying the food was excellent and your staff that assisted our waitress was great. It's sad to say there is nothing else great to say. We arrived and waited 5 minutes to be seated. The restaurant was not even half full so it was not busy enough to have to wait. We then waited another 10 minutes before the only waitress who was there came over. She didn't greet us or say hello just asked were we ready to order. We had not been given water or offered drinks. I then had to tell her we didn't have drinks so she then shifted gears. While this was happening an employee who appeared to be a manager ate a meal at the bar. I also noticed the waitress eating a meal in the bar area during our visit.,1,0,0,Rich F.,"Wayne, NJ",44,223,1
1.0,12/19/2018,"Do they know what flavor is here? I doubt it. Two dishes, mushroom risotto and flank steak, neither of which had even a modicum of flavor or salt. No salt or pepper on the table so that's out.

The flank steak, well, yeah, again, NO salt, no flavor, no anything. All of that and overpriced. I get the feeling that the neighborhood where this restaurant is has gotten used to bad food so it just accepts what it gets. Me, i'd rather go somewhere where the food is worth the money you pay for it.If you're going there to have a conversation with your date, forget it.

3.0,5/2/2018,"One nighter in NYC And needed to find something close to MOMA.  Thought I'd found the perfect place only to get to the door to find out they were closed for maintenance.  AYKM???  So a hipster Mex place a block down is next choice.  No go.  5:30 on a Friday in NYC WASSUP???  Where am I...Boca???  So I'm frustrated and go for the first thing I can think of and that's F&O has a place on Lex.  Cab and 10 min later we are at the front door but a phone call from the cab only insures us 3 stools at the common table.  Common table cool but my 91yr old guest and a stool???  Cmon.  But he was a gamer.  Basement restaurant.  Nice place.  Atmosphere nice and would have been better for us if we had a table.  Noise level grew minute by minute and cosmo after cosmo.  Most notable was that until around 6:30ish there were 3 men to about 50 women in the place.  Friday night in NY??  OK food.  Went with the Prix fixe.  Crustini not really worth the +$8 but if you are going to get one the onion jelly was best.  Fig & Olive salad a + salad with delish fresh fig and cheese.  Salmon was good and note cauliflower cous cous is a cold marinated side.  Chicken tagine looked like a much more interesting dish with a little kick of harissa in broth.  Going off the PF I would have the lamb chops which looked yummy!  Dessert choice either cookie or pot au creme.  The latter was luscious and multilayered and chocolatey.  So much I unusually didn't finish mine.  Food, noise and  stools left me a little wanting of my experience but it's still a special dinner just being out in NYC.",1,0,0,Mark G.,"Keene, NH",68,42,13

We ordered a sea bass  and a seafood paella  and even though the restaurant looked nothing like upscale the portion size (small, really small) made us think like it was. So we tried the food... and oh no... the fish had no flavor and tasted like some watery cod, not like a $39 Chilean seabass. The seafood on my paella was steamed (except for scallops and shrimps) and not seasoned at all and the octopus was overcooked. The dish also had a thick soup texture, so I just picked a little bit and put it aside. We paid the bill and left the restaurant very disappointed and hungry.

4.0,9/28/2017,"My mom was in town, so a group of us decided to go with the classic, contemporary Italian chain Fig & Olive for Sunday brunch.We made reservations on OpenTable out of convenience, but when we arrived around noon, the beautiful, spacious restaurant was sparsely populated, which we appreciated as a result of the lower noise levels. They had a generous selection of brunch options to choose from, with a variety of salads, egg dishes, and burgers. I grabbed the fig & olive salad with chicken, which was mediocre (although great if you adore cheese). Although I requested the vinaigrette dressing on the side, it was mixed into the sparse salad base, which I found overwhelming in flavor (personal preference). The toppings were strategically selected, though, with sweet, dried figs juxtaposing aromatic gorgonzola. The chicken, unfortunately, was overcooked and dry. My mother ordered the truffle mushroom fontina, which I enjoyed as a mushroom lover, but she wasn't a fan of the fontina cheese whipped in.Nonetheless, the highlight of the meal was our dessert finale, the fig & olive tasting, which was composed of 4 delectable mini-desserts. It was a well-crafted, diverse selection that catered to anyone's sweet tooth, whether you craved strawberries or sorbet or chocolate. Overall, the restaurant itself was tranquil, with attentive servers and an ambiance compatible with the older, Upper East Side crowd.

The bellinis advertised mint but wasn't present in our drinks so that was irritating. But it still tasted delicious so we didn't complain. The burrata was amazing.

2.0,3/18/2017,"We have eaten at the Fig & Olive in the Meatpacking District multiple times over the past year or so and always enjoyed it.  This was our first time at the Lexington Avenue location and what a disappointment it was.  The service was so poor that it ruined the whole evening despite most (not all) of the food being very good. Service comments:- Upon entering the restaurant at the time of our reservation, there were several staff standing directly across from us behind the bar chatting among themselves.  We stood there in the doorway (just a few feet from them) for several minutes until we were noticed and seated. - We have always enjoyed the bread with selections of olive oil at the Meatpacking location.  This night on Lexington Ave we ordered our food, had our crustini's and soup (which were all brought at the same time) all the while never receiving bread.  All the while we noticed that all the tables around us had bread.  We asked the gentleman that brought our crustini's and soup for bread and he said he would bring it.  It never arrived.  After our appetizers and soup bowls were cleared, I finally saw our server (who had been missing in action) and asked him if we would be receiving bread.  His reply was ""We don't bring bread automatically because a lot of people don't want bread. We only bring bread if you ask"".  This was the most ridiculous answer and I would be curious to know if it really is the policy of the restaurant or if we were being lied to in an effort to cover up a mistake.  The bread finally arrived about a minute or two before the entrees. - When the entrees arrived, one of them was the incorrect order.  We had ordered paella and received a completely different dish. When we pointed it out the server said he would ""quickly"" get the correct order. Anyone who knows anything about paella knows there is nothing ""quick"" about preparing it. I ate my correct entree that had arrived while my partner watched me eat. - I should mention that after this point we never saw our server again. He was still in the restaurant but never approached our table. It was someone else that checked in on us (and walked away before we could even reply) to him and yet someone else who brought our check. - As expected, when the paella arrived it was apparent that it had been rushed.  The rice was underdone and the seafood also was not cooked properly. - At this point we just wanted to get out of there so we skipped dessert (not that we were even asked if we wanted it) and got the check. - Our water was refilled as necessary which was the only positive aspect of the service. Food comments:- 3 crustini's (burrata, mushroom, and Gorgonzola were all delicious)- Butternut squash and chestnut soup was also good however the portions were small and when the gentleman poured it in our bowls he did it so fast that it appeared a significant amount was left in the glasses he poured it from. - Scallop linguini: very good but only 3 small scallops!- Paella: see above commentsDining out is about the experience as much as the food (in my opinion at least).  The service was so inferior that it ruined what otherwise would have been an enjoyable experience.",0,0,0,Alfven T.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",0,16,0

3.0,11/23/2015,I have been to Fig & Olive several times but the one in Meatpacking District. I have to say that this place is super tiny and the food isn't as great as the one on Meatpacking. Server was great but seemed like he was rushing us to leave to place. I HIGHLY recommend the other location. Is waaaay bigger and pleasant. Sangria was just ok. Not too tasty.

4.0,9/16/2015,"Went here the other night for dinner and while overall it was quite good, they had run out of truffle oil. Half of their dishes require truffle oil. All of their dishes that look delicious require truffle oil. They should rename the place fish and truffle because there is so much truffle oil on the menu. There's even another fig and olive down the street, couldn't they borrow some truffle oil from them? And this is the upper east side, there's several dean and delucas nearby that stock truffle oil. However, we persevered onward and ordered some of the menu items without truffle oil. I had the prefix menu with the fog and olive salad, Mediterranean chicken, and crostini dessert. The salad was extremely delicious and definitely the type of thing I'd recommend getting here on its own for a fancy lunch. The chicken was also quite good and served with some cous cous and different types of pesto/tomato oils. The dessert was incredible and basically tasted like a strawberry shortcake. However, overall, the place is overpriced, portions are small, decor is laking, and service is just okay.

4.0,8/17/2015,"Prior to this visit, I had only been to the Meatpacking District location and every time on a Saturday night.  We dined here on a Saturday evening, too, and there is a notable difference in atmosphere. The uptown location is a much smaller restaurant and more low key, but the food and service are of  the same quality.  If you want to actually hear your dining partner's voice, then this is the location for you. If you want to be seen and be around a vivacious group of people, then the Meatpacking location is your choice.  A plus for the uptown location is parking.  Ample street parking (by NYC standards) was available--Meatpacking district not so much. I am not sure if the uptown location has a full bar.  We were only provided with a wine list, whereas with the other location we also received a drink menu.  My friend, who isn't big on noise and lots of action in the background, appreciated the uptown choice.  I had the scallops for an appetizer and the smoked lamb chops for an entree.  Only 3 scallops for twenty dollars, not exactly cheap, but they were tender, not overcooked, or chewy.  The lamb chops come in a covered dish with smoldering sprigs of rosemary.  It is a well-presented dish.  My dining partner had octopus for the starter and something that looked like schnitzel.  He was not in love with the octopus, not because it tasted bad but because it didn't taste like how he expected it to taste.  He really enjoyed an octopus dish at a Greek restaurant and he was looking to replicate the experience.  He did like his schnitzel looking meal and was pleased overall with the food and experience.  I would be happy to return to either location depending on the mood and my company's preference.  It's a solid choice for dining.",0,0,0,GM R.,"Cranford, NJ",0,18,0

The bread was a bit dry but the olive oils were quite tasty, and the waitress provided descriptions of the flavors of each one. I had the chilled cucumber soup to start, and it was .. interesting. It was my first time trying cucumber soup, so it may just be my personal preference, but I expected it to be more refreshing, but instead it was more savoury than I wished. Not bad, just not what I had in mind.I really enjoyed my entree though - I had the seared salmon, with grilled asparagus and pea purée, and it was very delicious. I tried my sisters paella, which was super flavourful as well.

So finally we got seated. My bf's chair had bread crumbs and what not all over the chair. Nobody bothered to clean it even when he was very obvious about it. Then there was this piece of who-knows-what STUCK on the RW menu. STUCK. We both tried to flick it off. IT DOESN'T COME OFF. Disgusting. We pointed it out to our waitress and she gave us the whatever look and went off with it. Twice they switched my dish with my bf's. I don't understand how. The food was tasty. We had the RW menu. I had the mushroom croqette. Bf had the beef carpaccio. Our friend had the salad (she loved it). I ordered the truffle risotto, and bf had paella. Our friend had the Tajine. It looked ok. The paella is very small (since it's RW) and my risotto tasted like my croquette. So basically my main dish and my appetizer tasted the same. The dessert was good.

I enjoyed my visit and it was quite enjoyable.The uptown location is on a relatively busy street and you almost miss the restaurant if you are not actively looking for it. I went for Sunday brunch at around 3pm and it was interestingly not busy. I am guessing that perhaps brunch is not their most popular time.The ambience was very nice and classy. I really liked the decor and the many olive oil bottles showcased on the wall. I sat by the windows which afforded a nice view of the busy street.I ordered French toast and had a Bloody Mary. The French toast was amazing - very soft and melted in my mouth. It came with strawberry jam on it and a strawberry, as well as some butter.

My friend and I ate at the Uptown location, which was beautiful, sleek, elegant and cozy with comfortable seating, which had an intimate feel.After we settled in, we were served a plate of rosemary focaccia bread pieces and three different types of olive oil: Two from Spain and one from Italy. The bread was mediocre, a little bit dry but the olive oil was rich and tasty.For my appetizer, I chose the truffle mushroom croquettes, which were delicious fried balls of cremini mushroom parmesan and béchamel, served with truffle oil aioli. They were incredibly flavorful, fresh and wonderful!The main course was Rosemary Lamb, which consisted of grilled lamb and red bell pepper on skewers with rosemary ends, a fig and cous cous with red onion, scallions and tomatoes, and sauce made out of Greek yogurt base. The lamb was amazing... Perfectly cooked, tender, well-seasoned and incredibly appetizing. The cous cous was also quite good, and I normally don't like cous cous that much. I enjoyed both the lamb and cous cous with the sauce, giving the dish more depth.There were only two options for dessert, so my friend and I ordered one of each so that we could try both. The ""Dessert Crostini"" was Amarena cherry and mascarpone on top of pistachio shortbread with basil. There were two of these so it was perfect and I liked the taste of mascarpone on the shortbread but I thought the cherries were way too sweet.The chocolate pot de crème, which came with a crunchy praline financier (basically a fancy Kit Kat bar) and vanilla cream on top, was out of this world delectable.

4.0,8/23/2014,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday around 2pm - party of 2 seated immediately. We shared 1 order from the prix fixe menu: fig and olive salad (duh), salmon eggs benedict (something of that sort anyway), an extra side order of sauteed spinach and shortbread for dessert. We each got a coffee drink and split the bill - $28 each. Kind of pricey for a college kid, but the food was really fresh and tasty. Nothing was bland or overly simplified/complicated, which seems to be a difficult thing for most restaurants to achieve consistently. One negative mark is they forgot to bring us the bread plate, which is included in the prix fixe menu. The space is also really beautiful, bright and clean.

I understand that restaurant week makes everyone crazy, but he completely forgot to bring us our bread, only took our orders without checking in throughout the meal and then double billed me for a drink I had already paid for at the bar.As for the food, I will say that the croquetas were delicious, and my entree of mushroom risotto was pretty good.

3.0,8/1/2014,"This is a restaurant week review.The fig and olive midtown east has very classic Mediterranean-inspired decor. The first floor was crowded and filled with people who were waiting at the bar for a table while the second floor was nicer and quieter. We were seated on the second floor.The three of us ordered salmon tartare, lobster bisque and fig and olive salad for appetizer. The most outstanding dish of the three was definitely the lobster bisque, where the flavor of the lobster blended and melted perfectly into the hearty tomato-y soup. The salmon tartare weren't very flavorful, and the salad weren't very memorable except the rich olive oil-y dressing.We ordered the petite fillet mignon, salmon and the lamb chop for entree. We asked for medium rare or medium, but all our meat came out to be more cooked than we desired. Out of the three, the lamb chop was the most beautifully plated and the richly delicious, paired with strings of perfectly sauteed and gravied eggplant. I would definitely love to have that lamb chop again, and it was well worth the $6 extra.The dessert crostini was interesting, a little too sweet to my taste, but i thought the strawberries were great add-ons.Now, here is why I give three stars: nothing was really outstanding about this place, not the food nor the service. All appetizers came the minute after we ordered, the desserts the minute after we finished the entree, and yet the entree took a 30-minutes wait. This was fine considering it was restaurant week but still messed up the tempo of the meal. Overall an okay experience.",0,0,0,Hara W.,"New York, NY",219,65,43
2.0,7/27/2014,"Pros: The service and ambiance at this place were excellent. We had a great, friendly waiter, and a good time overall.  Cons: This was the kind of bland, over-priced dining experience you'd expect from an UES restaurant. If you're into $8 bottles of Stella and $14 dollar wine marked up to $75 this is for you! At $30 an entree you can get way better food practically anywhere else in the city. The food I got was overcooked and under-seasoned. In fact, their signature feature is that they have a different olive oil for each of their dishes. It says a lot when you want a condiment to carry your dishes. Overall: I decided to have dinner on the UES, so really I'm the only one to blame in this situation.",0,0,0,Joe B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0

The waitress described the different notes in the olive oils and it was a fun surprise. The salad was really fresh and the figs were delicious. The risotto was good but would have been better with fewer green onions, for my taste. The grand finale was the DELICIOUS Chocolate Pot de Creme. My roommate and I agreed it was absolutely exceptional: chocolatey, creamy, rich and sweet. A great way to end the meal.

4.0,2/25/2014,"When my boyfriend decided to delay a business trip one more day just to hang out with me I knew an impromptu Restaurant Week date was in order. Instead of playing the usual ""where do you want to go?"" back and forth game, I texted him a time and a place. Fig & Olive, nice and close to home, with a ""to-try"" Yelp bookmark that was starting to look a little dusty in my account. The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice, not to loud, perfect lighting, and we weren't seated too closely to our neighbors - all great things by NYC standards.We started off with a bottle of pinot noir (I don't remember which!), and since we were afraid that the Restaurant Week portions might be very small, we also ordered a cheese board to start. The board was one of the best I've had - just the right amount and variety of cheese, bread, almonds and jams (fig, apricot) to start a meal. Of the Restaurant Week options, I chose to start with truffle mushroom croquettes which was just the right amount of truffle and cheese, so savory. My main was the primavera lobster risotto, which was generous in portion, and very rich. The veggies tasted so fresh, and the risotto texture and flavors were spot on. For dessert we shared both options (a cherry, mascarpone, pistachio ""dessert crostini"" and a ""chocolate pot"" with crunchy praline financiers & vanilla cream), of which we agreed the chocolate pot was the better choice. Fig & Olive was a great Restaurant Week choice - I think I got an excellent sampling of their menu, and I don't think we even needed the cheese plate. That said, with our add-ons (the wine and cheese), the bill did wind up being way more than we'd like to spend on a random Monday night.

Meeting my friend Caitlin who was on her way out of town for a few months, we needed one last hurrah before she went down unda to Australia. She suggested Fig & Olive, and I met here there for a little too much indulgence for 8:30 on a Monday night...but it was damn well worth it.We started off with a sampler of three olive oils and some pieces of nice rosemary-infused bread. One was super olive-tasting, the other two a bit more mild and peppery, all delicious! Next, we were graced with an amazing crostini sampler: mushroom, artichoke, scallion, Parmesan; goat cheese, caramelized onion, chive; manchego, fig, Marcona almond; shrimp, avocado, cilantro, tomato; Prosciutto, ricotta, fig, olive, walnut; and crushed Tomato and olive oil. I tried all but the shrimp and the mushroom, and each I tried was a unique delight. The caramelized onion melded well with the goat cheese, and the manchego and fig balanced salty and sweet well. As for an entree...I was already a bit stuffed, so I went to town on some zucchini carpaccio, served with lemon, pine nuts, Parmesan, and Picholine olive oil. It was a perfectly light and welcomed end to a surprisingly robust round of appetizers. The zucchini was dressed perfectly, and that Parmesan sure had a kick to it!Finally, we each had a sangria...or two. Our waitress, who was a delight and amusingly chatty in her cool classes and red lipstick, topped our second glasses with some champagne and proposed a toast to missing work the next day. Previously, I had mentioned how I had to be at work at 8:45 a.m. and knew better than to drink so much on a work night. Well, I showed up regardless, but that extra bubbly kick did knock me down a little for the rest of my evening; I say that in the most complimentary way!

You get more out of pre fix for $36 bucks. A single entree cost 30-40 dollars. If you are not that hungry you should order like me and share everything. Bread were served as complimentary with 3 different kinds of olive oil from 3 different countries, I like the middle one but I forgot what it was called.We got the Signature fig and olive salad, good dressing with variety of veggies, cheese but too much oil dressing. The olive does not taste so good. Salmon: it was a bit too dried but the white sauce on the side made it not as noticeable. The onions were burnt. Paella: better than others I've tried.

Their food is perfectly cooked every time. The truffle mushroom croquettes are just heavenly. The lamb chops are presented with great fanfare (they come covered with a burning spring of rosemary) and are not fatty at all. The chive gnocchi they're served with are pillow soft. The pot de creme dessert is a perfect finish. I personally think their portion sizes are perfect (too many places heap a mountain of food on your plate that's not nearly as well cooked as this). We had 3 crostini (which are literally just a small piece of toast but tasty nonetheless) 2 apps, and entree each, and a dessert to split. Admittedly I could have done without the crostini, and I took home half my entree.The staff are attentive and prompt and all our food and drinks were served quickly, even once the place was packed.Now for the not so great: the place is insanely crowded (because the food is so good, which is a good thing!) but be prepared to hear the ENTIRE conversation of the table seated next to you, for better or worse.

My last time here my friend and I shared the chicken pillared - disappointing and one of the other chicken dishes on the menu, which was inedible. The prices are also on the high side (which I would be OK with if the food was actually good). They also rushed us out of the place- and  I mean rushed.

After I arrived and we moved to another table we met our waiter for the first and only time. Well actually he brought us our wine and then took our order but we never saw him again. He was pleasant and personable when he took our order but. . . Our food was served and table cleared by our busboy who also took our coffee order. I was disappointed when he cleared our appetizer plates he took our dirty silverware off of our plates and put it on our place mats.  I guess the cost of removing the dirty silverware and replacing it with clean is prohibitive.  We also had to ask two different people for the foccia bread and olive oil which finally came when we received our main course.  The busboy did not know what the 3 offerings of oil were and indicated he would send our waiter over to tell us what the different oils were, but as I said, we never saw him again after we placed our order. We had 3 crostini's which should have been on grilled or toasted bread but it was soft.  Just never completed the toasting process.That was followed by a zucchini ravioli which was good, but not outstanding. This was followed by the sea bass and the Mediterranean tasting.  I cannot say that there was anything wrong with the food, the plates looked good, but it was not memorable.I should also note that while this is a wine bar, it did not have an extensive list of wines.Overall, it was pleasant but for the money I can find other restaurants that rise above being merely pleasant.  I would not come back.",0,0,0,Jean M.,"Spring Lake, NJ",2,4,4

The food was not as ""amazing"" that people claimed it to be. The only decent thing was the crostini and the truffle mushroom croquette. However, for my main dish, the Lobster Risotto. BLEH! I don't know what's all the hype about. I was expecting good service, good food. The portions were okay though. I went with my mother and my little brother. My mother had the same as me, my brother had the chicken tajine and he hated it. He was surprised how packed this place was considering the food not even being up to par. For desert I got the waffle, I actually laughed when they served it. Where was the cream? Oh yea there was a teaspoon of it under the waffle..all melted... I nearly choked on the damn thing because it was so dry. So disappointed!!Oh and let's not even begin talking about the service. They sat us - gave us bread with oil but no plates!

I decided to get their mushroom with scrambled egg and scallion only because I was not so ambitious to eat everything. The scrambled egg is prepared in a small clay pot with diced mushroom inside. It is more on the wet side of scrambled eggs and is very different from a normal scrambled egg dish. It is a cheesy and light dish. I felt satisfied but not stuffed. The price is a little deep for eggs and mushroom if you ask me even though it comes with a very small side salad and two 1/4 toasts.

Instead of the truffle eggs, I went with the salmon /poached egg dish which has changed since the last time I saw (but did not order) it. THE BEST BRUNCH meal of my life. It's now in a bread bowl and the poached salmon is marinated in citrus juices. Heaven, with the most perfect poached eggs.Also, a few slices of avocado (that's a bigger deal in NYC during February than LA or SB where avocados--and stellar guacamole for like nothing--are ubiquitous). Some goat cheese too under the avocado slices. Then three PERFECTLY roasted potato slices. A great portion size. And a nice saladThey were out of the Grenache/Syrah I love so I said, what the hell, it's my birthday and ordered the Tempranillo Especial, 2009. Venta Del something.. 16/glass but friend into wine said 25/bottle and this will become my special occasion wine by the bottle when I'm not drinking my daily under 10 buck wines (I have a few go to 6 buck a bottle whites and reds from Trader Joe's or Costco; in a pinch, I can do the CVS 5 buck stuff too but here you can't get okay wine at CVS unfortunately). It was a fantasy brunch and the coffee is great. They brought me a mousse with a candle and I could not be more in love with this 29 prix fixe. I always get the fig and olive salad but the zucchini carpaccio with oil, pine nuts and shaved cheese was terrific. I love the truffle fontina scrambled eggs but this is a masterpiece of a dishP.S.

The salmon carpaccio was tasty but overwhelmed with the grapefruit pieces.

2.0,1/21/2013,"Maybe this was just me and I know that you shouldn't expect too much of restaurants during restaurant week, but I found my experience here very lacking. First of all, most of the items on the Restaurant Pre-fixe menu are on the actual menu, which I actually found to be kind of cool as this means you are getting the same thing as someone else might have ordered normally but cheaper. Unfortunately the options were pretty uninspiring as was the food. I ordered the Carrot Soup for a starter, Penne Funghi for main, and Dessert Crostini. The carrot soup was pretty good, smooth, and slightly sweet. I think it could have been a lot better with some black pepper and lemon. The soup at Forty Carrots is much better. My friend ordered the Salmon Ceviche Crostone and she was torn as to whether she loved it or hated it. The Penne Funghi consisted of sauteed cremini mushrooms with shaved parmesan, olive oil, and black pepper. It was a pretty boring lack luster dish. The mushrooms were woodsy and slightly smoky. The pasta was cooked al dente, but there was very little flavor. Execution was good, flavor bland. I also felt that the plating was very slap dash. Then onto dessert. We were presented with plates of shortbread topped with sweetened mascarpone topped with some kind of preserved cherry and pistachios. The shortbread was amazingly buttery and delicious. The mascarpone was slightly sweet, creamy, and oh so rich. The cherries tasted like cherry cough syrup and I promptly removed them all. The pistachios added a nice crunch. Overall, this was the best part of the meal. It was bit heavy though. We both left feeling disappointed and wishing we had chosen somewhere else.

They were all pretty good!For appetizer, I got the carrot soup, which was really good, and my husband got the truffle soup, which I just thought was okay. For the main, we both got the truffle risotto, which was okay.  When I had a bite of the shaved parmesan with truffle shavings, it was really good, but when I didn't have any parmesan in my mouth, it was kind of bland or one-dimensional or something. There wasn't really anything in it besides risotto, mushrooms, and green onions. For dessert, there was a choice of dessert ""crostini"" or pot de chocolate. The waiter just brought us out a plate with two pots de chocolat and a cookie with something like whipped cream and three cherries on top, as well as two little bricks of crunchy, crunchy, butter hazelnut.

It's kind of like a sexy science lab imported and implanted in the midtown/UES area.We sat at the communal table (which actually made the experience fun and perfect for people watching) and we were served with a small bread plate and F&O's distinct triple-saucer of three olive oils. The Tunisian one was a surprise and pretty tasty! My friends ordered, some crab cakes, gazpacho, and crostinis. I ordered the Fig and Gorgonzola tartlet, which was well worth the relatively steep $16. The gorgonzola cheese was the perfect balance to the fig and arugula.All in all, despite the stereotype of stuffiness, I actually found dining at Fig and Olive to be really casual and unpretentious.

1.0,10/9/2012,"Came here for lunch during restaurant week with a friend and it was awful! So since Fig and Olive's menu is soooo long, I decided I'd just stick with the restaurant week menu since I was hungry and didn't want to spend 20 minutes with the menu. (I appreciate variety but the menu could have been more organized). I ordered the fig and cheese salad and boy did I get a mess. With the name of fig and cheese salad you'd think the main ingredients would be ...FIG AND CHEESE...but no, its a mess of ingredients that didn't work together at all! It had lettuce, apples, honey, walnuts, tomatoes, olives, scallions, and I'm sure there was more, oh and of course the 2 pieces of figs and slabs of cheese. My taste buds were confused! For my main course I ordered the shrimp pesto pasta. Again very little shrimp which i was okay with since it was very bland and the pasta was very undercooked. plus i think they had zucchini in it as well...i couldn't tell since the zucchini and the pasta had the same crunch to it. dessert was the only highlight...chocolate pot. but how could you possibly screw that up? it was rich and smooth. it brought up the meal by very little. the overall looks of the place was sophisticated and sleek.service was similar to the food. our waiter mocked us for not knowing what one item on the menu was and when we asked him to explained he didn't seem to know himself. he brought us the check while we were eating dessert. i know you want get your tip quicker, but i'm not only paying for a meal (which was horrible to begin with) i'm paying for the experience.

The chicken tangine was a lot but oh so delicious! The chicken was tender and full of flavor, with the couscous was wonderful with many spices.

We sat across from each other rather than next to each other. This was a mistake; I had to lean in the enitre meal to hear her. The place is very noisy.The restaurant was completely full and it looked like there were only 2 servers for the whole place. Our waitress handled the back and the waiter handled the front. The waitress was not attentive due to this. She came around to take our order and that was about it.The food was ok. I started with a salad, which was good (but you've got a problem if you get a salad wrong). The branzino was my main course. It was dry and rather bland. My gf had a mushroom risotto. She didn't seem to be a fan. I even tasted it and it didn't seemed to be cooked prorperly. It was kind of crunchy.

1.0,8/18/2012,"People seem to love the restaurant week menu but the was by far the worst brunch I've ever had in the city and I've been to quite a few place which all have been excellent. 1. The food was very mediocre for what it was priced at and the brunch menu is really small and they only have one sweet thing on the menu (which they ran out of). My mom ordered the eggs benedict with salmon. It had a couple tiny little tuna like chunks of salmon in a bread bowl and some cheese and two tiny little eggs. I've had several salmon eggs benedict and it just seemed like the plate was being filled with filler bread than actual quality ingredients. The honey and thyme eggplant was bitter and had way way too much thyme. it tasted like medicine and I had to take a mint after eating it to get rid of the taste. 2. Service. Other reviews have noted that the service is awful here. I have found that those reviews were true for me. The waiter we had was rude, impatient and didn't communicate very well with us. Likewise the management here does not seem very good.

D E L I C I O U S! Great salad! I would definitely eat it again!!!! For Entree I had TRUFFLE RISOTTO : Arborio rice, black trumpet and cremini mushroom, scallion, parmesan, parsley & white Truffle Oil. Risotto has always been a food on my list of things that I definitely wanted to eat. The texture was amazing, it was cooked perfectly. I could definitely eat this again. Ally had the FILET MIGNON Grass fed beef marinated with rosemary, thyme and garlic - Arbequina Olive Oil Béarnaise  haricot vert, caramelized shallot, olive oil chive mashed potato; I was lucky enough to have a date who lets me eat off her plate! :) It was yummy, the haricot vert, the mash the filet all cooked very well & amazing on the palette. Dessert was AMAZEBALLS in the words of my darling Ally. I had the Chocolate Pot de Creme & Ally had the Dessert Crostini! Who would have thought that Strawberry, mascarpone, balsamic shortbread with micro-basil could taste so damn delicious!!!!!!! The texture of the shortbread was perfectly buttery & melt in your mouth soft. The strawberry & mascarpone were perfect compliments. Now the pot de creme omg omg omg.. This is a dessert I can honestly say I took my sweet time savoring.

Dimmed with candlelight and cozy.The star(s) of the menu are the crostinis, which you can order a la carte or in groups of 3 or 6. These are fantastic! Creative deliciousness in bite size form. I need to go back and try all the flavours. But I MUST recommend either the crab or the mushroom/truffle crostini - they are amazing!For the main we shared the paella, which was great. Definitely more creamy (like risotto), rather than the crispier, charred-on-the-bottom type I expected from spanish cuisine, but I prefer it this way anyway.We finished off with the selection of 4 desserts. We chose the crunchy praline (my favorite, crunchy and delicious), the chocolate pot, and the mango and green apple sorbet (the fiance's favorite).

5.0,7/26/2012,"Reserved a Restaurant Week dinner here for last night and it was outstanding! Bravo!We had passed by this fancy looking restaurant many times in the past and had always wanted to try it out. Being that it was RW made the choice an easy one and I quickly made reservations. This Fig  & Olive location is on the small and narrow side, long bar area, communal table, and table seating in the back. Nicely decorated with a clean trendy chic look. It's the kind of place you can see the ""Gossip Girls"" or UES monied ""Ladies Who Lunch"" hang around in over salads, cheese plates, and glasses of wine. It's also a great date spot and a place to bring a friend to catch up on things. Upscale in looks but actually more of a casual vibe here.When we arrived right off the bat I was impressed with the service, as it was just perfect. Highly attentive from the host, to our waitress, to the food servers. Each one we came in contact with was attentive and friendly. Even the manage crame by to chat and see if we were ok, and offered us a free drink. Now, the place was far from empty, as we were not the only ones there, and it was actually jam packed. Not a set was empty. My only qualm is that the place gets very loud and sometimes it's hard to hear each other talking. Still, it was loud over happy customers over fun conversations and laughing, so you have to give that a pass.The RW menu here is well thought out and is a nice representation of what Fig & Olive has to offer. I was surprised at the size of the plates. Sometimes restaurants skimp on RW portions, but not here. This was a full three course meal. I asked and was told that most of what they offer is basically the same on the normal menu. Well worth it for $35. Here is a rundown of what we dined on - Plate of soft bread with three olive oil tastings were placed on the table. Indonesian, Greek, and California oils to dip in. Like crack.Fig Gorgonzola Manchego Salad. Delicious and quite filling with a light balsamic dressing. Terrific tasting figs, walnuts, and a few types of cheeses in it.Truffle Risotto. Wow. Just so good. Rich, creamy, cooked just right. Doesn't look like a lot but is very filling.Branzino A La Planca. Perfectly prepared fish over a bed of asparagus, along with chive mashed potatoes, cooked tomatoes, and pesto aioli. Very satisfying plate.The desserts were off the hook and one of the best parts of the meal! Strawberry Crostini's and Chocolate Pot De Creme. Both ridiculously terrific. We both fought over the chocolate pot and wanted to pick it up and lick out what was left. The crostini's were so light and tasty. Great way to end our dinner.By the end we were totally satisfied with this fantastic meal. Fig & Olive certainly did not hold back on RW. Impeccable service combined with a thoughtful menu in upscale-like upbeat surroundings made for a wonderful dining experience. We will definitely come back here if even just for some wine and cheese or crostini's, if not dinner again. Loved everything about it.",9,4,6,Phil H.,"New York, NY",5000,3324,13021
4.0,7/20/2012,"I came here with a friend of mine, we came for the restaurant week deal. We originally wanted to get 3 crositinis and a restaurant week course however since we couldn't share that we decided to not do crostinis and just each order from the restaurant week menu. For apps we had the fig and manchego salad and mint and pea soup. I loved my salad! it was really delicious with walnuts and sweet figs--however, i found a foreign object in there and i am not taking any points off because they offered to replace it but i was already almost done so i didn't want another. My friend really disliked her soup, i guess you either love or hate it. The waitress was really nice and saw that since i had something in my food and my friend didn't like her soup she actually gave us complimentary crostinis! Which were really good we had the mushroom, shrimp and barata? It was reallyy goood! And the ones that we had previously ordered but decided to not get. It was a really nice gesture which showed great customer service. The entrees were chicken tanjine and paella de la mar. I loved my paella had lots of flavor and the seafood (shrimp, mussels, calamari) were all seasoned well and tasted fresh. The desserts were awesome too strawberry ""crostinis"" and pot de creme.

Some bad reviews mention the service but my girlfriend and I did not have any issue with our server. He was not overly attentive but he was not inattentive either.I really liked the ambiance of the place. It's narrow but goes back pretty far and does not feel overly cramped. It's not overly romantic but the dim lighting and decor make it a good place for a date. If you sit in the back you can watch the chefs in the kitchen but be warned it gets pretty warm back there.As for the food, both mine and my girlfriend's meals were delicious. The portions are not huge but with an appetizer it's just the right amount. I like how you get to sample a few different types of olive oils, though I'm not sure I'd be able to tell the difference between their 30-plus varieties so that may come across as gimmicky to some.Overall, Fig & Olive's good atmosphere, good food, and reasonable price earn it 5 stars in my book.",2,0,0,Rick A.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",1,36,0

Fig & Olive is a great restaurant because it's not overpriced, they have a very wide range of types of food and everything is olive-oil based and quite healthy. Also, for people who are lactose intolerant like me, having everything be olive-oil based allows you to have delicious creamy soups and the like that are normally off limits. The only reason why I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that this location really leaves something to be desired when compared to the other two locations. It is much more cramped and the seats are not as comfortable. Especially since this location is so close to the East Midtown one, I would always choose that over this one. But when convenient, I wouldn't rule this one out because the food is truly superb. My favorite thing to order are the gazpacho's and salads.

We asked for something unique, she suggested Fig & Olive.The restaurant is cute, with regular tables and a bar. Our server was great, she had wonderful recommendations and picked a great glass of wine for each of us. The menu has small plates and entrees, but wanting to try as many tastes as possible, we went for the small plates. We started with a few of the crostini and I enjoyed each of mine. The flavor combinations are wonderful, like the manchego, fig and marcona almond. They are a great price as well- 3 for $10 or 6 for $19. A great way to get a lot of little tastes. We also ordered the Fig Gorgonzola Tartlet. Puff pastry with sweet, salty, bitter and creamy tastes. A really great balance. Even though we were starving, between these bites and the complimentary bread and olive oil we were full. At about $70 total after tax and tip I think it was a great success and within our company travel policy.

3.0,1/26/2012,"Ate lunch at the Fig & Olive today as part of New York Restaurant Week.Walked in.  Bag check (big plus).  Didn't have to wait for a table right at noon.  Nice decor.  Not stuffy feeling.  Very fancy-homey.  Like a Williams-Sonoma.  Sat down. A funny thing was that several different servers/busboys came over to take drink orders, orders in general.  One of this army gave us some tasty bread and some 2/3 good olive oil.   Next  Fun to taste the different ones, but the one from somewhere or other (who ever listens to the Companion got the soup, I got the tuna carpaccio.  Tuna carpache very flavourful, but the macademias I think they were were kinda strange.  Soup was apparently good.Mains were good.  Penne w truffles was a huge portion.  My bouillebaisse not so much, but very very tasty.  A bit heavy on the fennel, but hey.  The fish was really good.  Just wish I had had more broth.  Noticed over lunch how loud it is in this place.  Mind you it was packed midway through lunch.Things kinda fell apart when it came to dessert.  First they brought the wrong desserts (pot de creme was what we ordered).  Then it took a long time for them to clear them, only with a lot of nagging.  They brought the right dessert to the table next to us- right for us.  The dudes next to us were left wondering.  One of them nibbled on the caramel biscotto thing and reported favourably.  They had the same experience trying to send away the (mainly untouched, except for caramel biscotto) desserts.  Still waiting.  We gotta catch a train so we're asking for the bill.  Its not like we were rushed or had rushed the staff either- we've been there for more than 1h 45m at this point.  So finally they brought the pot de cremes.  And they were delish.  Only one thing: I swear they brought back the same ones that the guys next to us had had- meaning the little biscotto thing was nibbled.  Can't confirm this, but I swear.  More troubles getting the credit card run.  We gotta catch the train!Overall, great food.  Not great service.  I understand they were packed, and frankly cranking out a prix-fixe at lunch is tough.  But they sorta dropped the ball.  More staff, more organization, Fig & Olive!  Takeout recommended, dining friends.",1,1,1,Joshua H.,"Boston, MA",64,51,0

First the good.  Dining here is the way to go.  The atmosphere is cozy yet modern.  Little cramped.  In addition to small tables for dining, there is also a community table next to the bar which is good for a group of friends. The staff has always been informative and patient.  I really enjoy the tasting sampler of the olive oils when you are first seated.  Might be my favorite part of the whole thing.  I have gotten numerous dishes here and they have all been on or above par.  Meat is always cooked wonderfully, presentation is fine, taste is good to delicious. Sides are good too but not necessary.  I honestly think I have tried everything from the appetizer menu and don't recall anything being disappointing.  It's a great menu for wine and (slightly expensive) nosh.  My favorite dish is the Penne Funghi Tartufo.  One time I got it and it was way to heavy on the scallion but its gotten better since.  And the amount you get is super filling.  Which is why I was having a really bad day and decided to order it for take out...  Ugh I still want to punch myself for spending $25 on this.  The pasta itself is only $18.  But then to add chicken is $7!  I should have just said no to the addition, but I didnt, hoping it would be the most splendid overpriced meal I have had in a long time.  Sadly, it was not and on top of that, the experience in general kinda sucked.  When I got there, the hostess asked if I had a chicken dish and I said no, because it is a pasta dish and I thought she would have known that.  So she goes to the back to check and says, 5 more minutes.  I wait 10, the order comes out, and the chef says something about the bags.  She then hands me the bag that was sitting there the entire time.  No apology or anything because she thought it was a different order but it was really awkward so I didn't push the matter.  When I got home, for what I got, I wanted to take the dish back to the place and throw it in their faces.  It was insulting.  The pasta was dried to the point it looked like it had sat for about 3 hours.  The chicken was something that looked like it was made by my collegiate brothers microwave.  The amount of the dish I ordered was not even a real portion (and I am talking nutritional portions here).  Also, they gave me enough bread pieces to last the week but no butter, oil, nothing.  I was so sad about the whole thing.  :( I recommend dining here only.  Do not bother with take out.",0,0,0,Are M.,"New York, NY",154,229,24

2.0,11/1/2011,"Ok, let me start off by saying, this place has potential. The concept is cute, a full assortment of appetizers, wine and cheese type foods, crostini's tuna tar tar, so on and so forth. Came here for a friends birthday. there was 13 of us. My bf and I ordered crostini's. The flavor was there, but isn't a crostini suppose to be crispy, or crunchy? Not these. It was on challah bread, which was really annoying. After that, we ordered salads. I had a ceasar salad. This was good. except the croutons seemed old. definitely not fresh croutons.now it comes time to the entrees. i ordered the filet. When i asked the server the size of the filet, she responded "" a good size"" as she shook her head. She didn't have an answer as to how many ounces the steak was. I ordered it medium rare, and when it was placed in front of me and i cut through the center, it was medium well. Now im not the type of person to send my food back, but when i seen my friends rack of lamb was over cooked, and 2 other filets were over cooked, i said i might as well. So I wait another 20 minutes for my dinner to come out. my ""good size"" filet came back. i cut into the center, finally a nice medium rare. Too bad they sold us SIRLOINS as filets. Yes, the menu says filet, on the check it said filet, but my plate clearly had a sirloin. I work in a steak house, i know the difference. i ate half the steak and was so turned off by everything i just pushed it to the side. i figured i would save room for dessert.I mean, on one note, they did do the right thing on dessert. half the table ordered dessert, and they sent out enough dessert for the table, to make up for the screwed up entrees. i ordered the chocolate thing. i cant even remember what it was. i guess it was good.When it came time to pay the bill, they pointed out how they took off $187.00 for the messed up entrees, only charged us for the desserts we ordered, and gave the birthday girl a bottle of spanish olive oil. it was the least they could do for every thing else they lack in.Would i go back?

4.0,10/9/2011,"I sincerely enjoyed this place. From the start with three olive oils to the finish with dessert, good food for everything.At the start, we liked the artichoke-noted oil from Sicily as well as the pepper variety from Chile. Everyone in my group seemed to enjoy their food -- this covers the crostinis (though a friend lamented the loss of the cucumber variety, opining it was the best), the ""poulet aux legumes..."" and more. I had the eponymous salad -- very good. Hearty, sweet, filling, and flavorful -- really a solid dinner salad. The interplay of the manchego and fig is really great. Also had the goat cheese gnocchi: freshly pan-fried, and quite well done. This is my preferred way to have the dish. And I liked that it was a side -- it enhanced the meal in just the right quantity.We finished with the apple tart. Not bad, but way too buttery. The tart itself felt like something between a crepe and a waffle in thickness and in texture. The ice cream was the better part of the dessert. Had we been feeling a little warmer, we might have tried a colder dessert and hopefully would have found have gotten something better than this, which was, while acceptable, decidedly average.Service was fine, prices weren't too high, but I think fair.

4.0,9/14/2011,"I've walked past this UES Fig & Olive on numerous occasions over the years and had mentally bookmarked it as a place to try. The time finally came last night when I dined here with a friend who had assured me that I would like this restaurant. And she was right; I am now a fan of F&O. We sat right by the window, in plain view of passersby as they strolled along 63rd and Lex, and I was visually stimulated from the outside-in. The decor is fresh and contemporary and a very well-purposed space. You can sit by the bar, the window, or hideaway onto the side of the restaurant for a touch of privacy. I like how there are different nooks in the restaurant to appease your dining mood. And, although F&O is beneath ground level, it manages to squeeze in a lot of natural light. Somehow, it feels very bright and inviting. I first noticed that they've got an extensive drink menu, and walls full of shelves of wines and signature oils (I saw an F&O balsamic), an indication, I felt, of its trying to make a name for itself in the landscape of self-promoting restaurant chains, but with a heightened sense of elegance. The light and buttery squares of bread they serve with three varieties of olive oils, were delicious starters to our dinner. We shared their signature Fig & Olive salad (romaine hearts, mesclun, fig, apple, manchego, dolce gorgonzola, tomato, walnut olive, scallion, 18 year old fig balsamic. arbequina olive oil) as our first course. The salad was absolutely delicious, the figs were noticeably plump and fresh, and paired along with the decadence of the different types of cheeses, it proved to be a wonderful, and savory combination. The revered balsamic was not too sharp which I really appreciated. I also loved the slithers of apples, adding a nice touch to an already excellent salad. As my entree, I went with the Paella Del Mar (black tiger shrimp, diver scallop, garden vegetable, artichoke tapenade, saffron rice pimenton & oregano hojiblanca olive oil). The scallops were juicy and nicely charred on the outside, but maintained a very soft texture within. I didn't get too much of the artichoke tapenade, but the saffron rice pimenton was enjoyable. I wouldn't say I was blown away, but I certainly was not disappointed. We passed on the dessert menu in order to make out way down the block to Sprinkles for a decadent cupcake!The portions here are decent. We were pretty stuffed and barely had enough room for a Sprinkles cupcake (of course, we had to share one between the pair of us), and so, F&O can boast about their generous portions, an attractive menu, with lots of seemingly delicious Mediterranean offerings, all set within an equally attractive, contemporary restaurant. I would definitely come back, and try the crostinis and samosas that other yelpers had recommended. Also, I would take heed of the pre-fixe menu, because this restaurant ain't cheap.For one reason or another, Fig & Olive reminded me a bit of Rouge Tomate. (Not that many places can compare to the glorious wonder that is Rouge Tomate!!!).

The crostinis were very good, the pasta was not bad but they put way too much oil in it, and the specialty was ok too.

The space is small and strangely designed (e.g., next to the bar, there is a long communal table with high bar stools) and despite the interesting ironwork facade on the exterior of the building, the colorful vegetable decor of Fig and Olive's interior seemed overly casual and out of place for dinner. As our meal progressed, I began to suspect the paintings of tomatoes and peppers were a form of subliminal advertising: if you think the food's good for you, you might not mind its mediocrity quite so much.Our meal began with a trio of olive oil and focaccia (beware: this can be filling).  Of the six crostini we ordered as appetizers, the fig and manchego, the bell pepper and ricotta (this had almost a hint of chipotle to it), and the mushroom artichoke were particularly tasty.  Unfortunately, this was where our interest in the food began to end.My cold cucumber and pink peppercorn soup was pulpy and almost medicinal in flavor (from the astringent peppercorns), while my husband's cold crab and avocado soup was boring and bland (it was unclear whether there were any other ingredients in the soup besides the eponymous duo).  Our entrees (the sole and the tuna and scallop salad) were also surprisingly bland.  It was as though there was some critical ingredient left out of each dish.  I lost interest after the first bite.  Thankfully, the Quincy sauvignon blanc was delicious.The service was ok, but for the money (for two people our bill was nearly $150), Fig and Olive was a total disappointment.  I spent most of the evening fighting off thoughts of all the other (and better) options we could have chosen.",0,0,0,Anna M.,"Manhattan, NY",17,50,2

4.0,5/16/2011,"Utterly chic and delightful location, that's simple dishes with a sophisticated twist come together to create an enjoyable dining experience. The simple elegance of Fig & Olive's décor is a refreshing change from the usual restaurant designs with gaudy, immaculately lit chandlers that over compensate for a mediocre and over priced menu selection, or the basic family themed junk on the wall designs which have been replicated one too many times already. As opposed to the standard complementary bread sticks and water, you are offered a starter of fresh oven baked loaves with a selection of warmed olive oils to wet your pallets. I would recommend trying the Paella as a main course. It is served with traditional saffron rice and your choice of fresh seafood. The portions are large and this dish in particular was very flavorful. I noted oregano oil infused with tomato in the rice.  When the bill was handed to me, I was pleasantly surprised.

For drinks, we've decided on Mimosa, which came out to be very light in flavor with some tarty citric feel but a bit weak for my taste.

1.0,4/17/2011,"""Imagine if you will the stupidest person you ever met.  Are you doing that?  Now double it, and that is the 'git' I'm dealing with.""For once, Hugh Grant took the words right out of my mouth.  That's precisely how I would describe the hostess (Iga?  Eega?  I won't sweat the spelling) at Fig & Olive.  How did Hostess Iga screw up so royally?  Allow me to recap:We had a 1pm reservation for brunch on a Sunday, which had been reserved on OpenTable two days earlier.  That Sunday morning, there was some concern as to whether everyone could do 1pm so we switched the reservation to 2, but within 60 seconds (no exaggeration) confirmed that everyone was free at 1 so moved the reservation back to 1pm.  In the mean time, Hostess Iga apparently looked at the reservation during the 60 seconds it was switched to 2pm and seated people accordingly - never bothering to check the system again and see that it had been moved back to 1pm.  Not ideal, but such is life.So when we arrived at Fig & Olive, Hostess Iga delivered the news that a ""mixup"" had occurred.  Here's where ""Hostess Fail"" set in.  Allow me to suggest a few things Ms. Iga might have done differently:1)  APOLOGIZE.  Yes, I understand it was a mixup.  I understand that there was a period of time, however, brief, when the system informed Hostess Iga that our reservation was at 2pm, not 1pm.  But honestly, that's your bad, Iga, not ours.  It's not our job to inform you that a reservation has been moved (your rez system does that automatically) - it's your job to keep track of it.  Fault = Iga's, not the customer's.  So when you're informing us that there's no table available, don't use the ""well you moved it to 2pm"" as an excuse to blame us.  That's just poor form - a regular 'git' move if ever I've seen one.2)  TELL US HOW LONG YOU EXPECT US TO WAIT.  So you've told us there's no table - but saying ""it will be a few minutes' isn't really all that helpful.  Is that 5min?  15?  30?  An hour?  Give me something to work with.  And when we asked you ""could you be more specific on how long the wait is?"" have a better answer than ""umm, wait a minute let me check [leave's to go somewhere]....well, there's a table that might be open soon, otherwise it will be awhile.""  Really?  That's the best answer you can surmise?  Weak sauce.3)  OFFER US SOMETHING FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.  Free coffe with our brunch?  A dessert?  This was probably wishful thinking considering Iga couldn't connect the dots to even remember to apologize, but a good hostess would recognize her mistake and offer to make it up in some manner to customers.  You, Hostess Iga, were only able to offer a smirk and a half-ass effort to see what might be available.  I'm not sure if estimating time is a challenge too great for you, or if you're just naturally rude and useless, but either way, that was pathetic.  So after some more conversation, and failing to get anything more than that patented Iga Smirk (TM), we decided it wasn't worth trying to stay for food.  We'd all eaten here before (NOTE:  I'd give the food 3.5 stars, solid and usually reasonably executed, but not worth going out of your way to sample).  So there you have it.  Iga-Fail pretty much ruined what was a very simple situation that could have been remedied very easily.  Why Iga?  Why?",1,3,0,Erick H.,"New York, NY",2,9,0

We decided to share the dishes because the menu had so much to offer.  We ordered the Yellow fin Tuna Carpaccio, the cheese plate, olives, and the eggplant crostini.  All of the plates were fun, delicious and extremely enjoyable. Perfect portion size for two or three people to share.  They also had a great drink menu, very different.  I went with a wine spritzer with mint leaves and loved it!

5.0,3/26/2011,"I came here for my birthday on a whim and it couldnt have been any more delicious. Absolutely exquisite, satisfying dishes with an unpretentious vibe. They start you off with an trio of olive oils to go with your bread, each with a very distinct taste.I started with a flight of crostini : proscuitto, ricotta & fig, manchego, fig & almond, and another I cant remember. Each punchy, fresh flavors mingling together in a not too heavy starter plate... each crostini very generously sized (like 3-4 full bites each)Entree was Paella which was one of the best I have ever had. After living in spain, I have had my fair share of paella, but this was unique... in addition to the traditional saffron rice, there was a oregano oil infused with tomato?, that was integrated into the mix... added a very mediterranean/italian flavor..... tons of fresh seafood (no mussels or things with shells = yay). Very large portion as well that i couldnt finish.. Dessert was totally insane. Some very very rich chocolate pot de creme which was the most decadent dark chocolate perfection I have ever had... not a mousse or a pudding... more like an entire cup of perfectly smooth 70% dark ganache. To die for. Ive had my fair share of disappointing birthdays.... but this dinner was one of the best I have had in NYC EVER let alone on a special day.

Actually in most restaurants- or all restaurants, their appetizers are pretty good and much better than main courses. I suggest wrapping the meat around the dough.This place is overrated and it's not worth the price you're paying for. just come here for drinks and appetizers and you're good.The mimosa is not that good imo, the place has AC on, so when they served the chicken, it was just right but then it got dry as it got cold really fast. and i'm a slow eater- i think? anyway, i didn't finish my meal.customer service is professionalprice is higher than average",0,0,0,Yina Z.,"East Elmhurst, NY",19,71,12
2.0,3/12/2011,So may be it was a bad day for the chef... it certainly wasn't that great for me or the people who were dining with me here. I went to F&O as I had heard a lot of raving reviews from people. Maybe I should have gone to the one in meatpacking ...but then again isn't the restaurant business all about consistency?Four of us from work had gone there for lunch. We all had the prefixe menu. I started with the Mediterrenean chicken samosa... seemed like it had been microwaved. The puff pastry coating was soggy when it should have been light and flaky. The best thing about this was the yogurt mint sauce which was nice and spicy. My other colleagues had the lentil soup but didn't have too much to say about it. I had the sea food paella as the entree and to sum it up it was a little insipid and lacking in flavor. To top it all it was doused in olive oil which didn't do much for the dish in itself. One of my colleagues had the grilled chicken and wasn't impressed that was doused in olive oil too.We ended the meal dessert crostini the one thing redeemed the meal did not require much culinary skill. The chocolate pot de creme was good... but if you like your chocolate sweet you should stay away from it.The saving grace of this whole meal was the blood orange infused olive oil that I bought at the restaurant and which gives a nice flavor to my salad every night.,0,0,0,Chaiti S.,"New York, NY",5,23,0

4.0,12/22/2010,"Fig & Olive is no Plaza and I like it that way. It's small and the people are no one to impress. Less of a business lunch place and more of a ladies who lunch, tourists, and a Bloomie's shoppers kind of place, I often find myself here when I want to sneak away from the office and have a lunch date. I used to have a crush on the guy who worked here so when all else failed (in terms of noon trysts), at least I got to see my guy. He was very, very charming.He would recommend all sorts of good things and give us free appetizers for moving ourselves to accommodate old socialite parties of eight. I've been to Fig & Olive a few times in the past two years and I always end up ordering two or three dishes to share from the same six dishes. They range from okay to exceptional and nonetheless satisfy the upper crust taste buds. Here is how they rank:-Okay-The Fig & Olive Salad- One would think this signature salad would be a no-brainer. It's actually a no-figger. I searched and searched for figs and then found some that were only slightly bigger than my finger nail. As for the dressing, it's aged and Spanish but who would know the difference?-Good-Crostini- Suggested bites: 1) Eggplant, Basil, Sundried Tomato 2) Manchego, Fig, Almonds 3) Prosciutto, Ricotta, Fig, Olive, Walnut Prosciutto & Melon- I thought the melon was going to be wrapped. Instead they are shaved pieces with prosciutto and arugula. It's a seasonal item.Steak Panini- This is a small sandwich (think tea party) with a few potato wedges. The potato wedges are crispy and flavored with olive oil. The paninis are also heavy on the side salad. It makes no sense to order salad as an appetizer when getting this dish. I made that mistake once. -Exceptional-Fig Gorgonzola Tartlet- Always get this! Melted gorgonzola, prosciutto, giant figs, walnuts, and arugula on top of puff pastry. It's rich, sweet, buttery and heavenly!French Riviera Rotisserie Chicken- Delicious! This is the reason why people order chicken. It's tasty, seasoned with Herbs de Provence and lemon and garlic. The skin is crispy and the sides are comfort food at its finest. The mashed potatoes are gussied up with chives and the green beans, or shall we call them haricots verts for wax lyrical, still have that snap. This is a large portion of food and more appropriate as a dinner entree. For lunch, it is a real treat.Dessert is not to be skipped. The Chocolate Pot De Crème is placed in a small ramekin but is potent enough that a few tablespoons will suffice. The Cookie Plate is five stars on its own. I ordered this because I wanted something lighter than the pot de crème. The cookie variety was well balanced with Lavender Madelaines, Walnut-Fig Biscotti, and the surprisingly interesting yet works Fig-Chocolate Chip cookie. It's way too much cookie for two people. Expect to take the big chocolate chips to go.The service is slow and I would definitely reserve more than an hour for lunch. If you want to save 15 minutes, you might as well skip the trio of EVOO appetizer course. I find them too Earthy tasting. Fig & Olive is big on olive oil but the tasting varietals are one of the worst I've ever had. Now if only they served their bread with a fig tapenade...

Truffle Sauce.  The Branzino w. Figs & Balsamic Vinegar was delicious too and we thought the Salmon was just okay.   I particularly liked that the dishes were light and not heavy at all.  I was a bit torn about the price.  The entree alone was $29 which I'd normally feel is expensive, but we had a sample of 3 seafood dishes which I thought made it worth it's price.  Our appetizer was $18 but we had 4 kinds of ceviche/tartar dishes.  We only ordered one drink(drinks were a bit pricey).  All in all our total came to about $70 for two.  In the end we were both stuffed and felt the cost was reasonable.  Some might think the portions are small but it was perfect for us.

3.0,9/9/2010,"I was looking for a fun, trendy kind of place in midtown (does that exist?) to meet up for dinner with a friend of mine visiting town. I arrived before him and was surprised at just how small this restaurant was. Most of the tiny tables were full and I was seated at the long, narrow communal table, elbow to elbow with the person next to me. I quickly realized that this was not going to work, that his 6'4"" frame was not going to be fitting into any of these tables or at this narrow bar type table on one of these mini chairs. ""Change of plans,"" I texted him and we ended up over at Brasserie 360 for overpriced burgers. What can I say, it's midtown. So ladies, Fig & Olive is not a place to take your boo, unless your boo happens to be Doug Flutie. Plus it's kind of foofy girl food. I have been back a few times since with various friends. The bread and extra virgin olive oils they bring out are really good. The crostinis are pretty good. I really like the scallop appetizer - seared sea scallops, truffles, artichokes, mushrooms, arugula, and pine nuts with aged balsamic vinegar. I usually order the Fig & Olive signature salad which is fig, olive, tomato, manchego, gorgonzola dolce, goat cheese, walnut, chive, scallion, green apple, with 18 year fig & balsamic dressing and arbequina olive oil. The vibe is a casually elegant, upscale feel with that trendy, chic factor. Maybe not so much a scene for ladies who lunch, it's more of an after work place for divas who dine. Avoid being seated at a table by the kitchen. And for the real Fig & Olive experience, definitely head over to the meatpacking district.

We had the: Manchego/Fig Spread/Almond, Bresaola/Goat Cheese/Black Olive, Crab & Lemon Cilantro Mayonnaise (2)  and Mushroom/Artichoke/Truffle Parmesan (2). My mom thoroughly enjoyed the Crab crostini the most. I thought the crostini with the Manchego and Fig Spread was the best - the sweetness of the jam balanced out the kick of dairy flavour the cheese gave. We agreed our least favorite was the Bresaola crostini. I guess we're not too keen on the unusual flavor, but I can see lovers of cured meats liking this.For our main course, we shared the Shrimp and Scallop Paella ($26.00). You get 2 jumbo shrimps and large scallops with this dish. Woohoo! My only problem with the dish is that there are so many bell peppers and so little rice. With every mouthful, I tasted more bell peppers than anything else. Overall, the portion was good and we were satisfied.

When we ordered a (rather good) salad, she took the order without comment. And then 10 minutes later, unceremoniously plopped the plates down on the table. A few minutes later, our plates were joined by a plate of bread and olive oil. This did not bother me until another couple sat down at the table next to us. The same waitress explained the day's specials, and brought the same plate of bread and explained the origins of the olive oils and their different flavours.

2.0,3/12/2010,"We started with a little foccacia and olive oil.  Never really was an olive oil person, and the restaurant didn't change my opinion.  I still prefer my bread or focaccia to be smothered in good, old-fashioned butter. I do have to admit, that I didn't dislike the olive oil as much as I dislike other ones.  It was acceptable, and I normally find olive oil to taste really oily. Yes, I know it is olive OIL.      The veal Carpaccio appetizer was dry and flavorless, but that was my fault, I see carpaccio and I get way too excited.  When one sees carpaccio, one automatically thinks raw... but no.... reading is fundamental.  The description clearly states BRAISED veal tenderloin, caper mayonnaise shaved mushroom, pine nuts, micro basil.  But if you read between the lines, it meant cardboard dry flavorless pork jerky, that even the above-par caper mayo and shaved mushrooms couldn't save. Why couldn't the beef carpaccio have been on the prix-fixe menu that night? Raw beef marinated in 18 year-old balsamic vinegar, baby arugula, with a parmesan/truffle olive oil. Now that's sounds like a real treat.    For the entrée, I had the roasted veal tenderloin with porcini and the veal was cooked perfectly tender but was very one note.  Tasted like something I could make at home, and I definitely did not taste porcini.  If I see porcini mushroom in the description, I better damn well taste it. The plate just didn't come together.  Acceptable, that's the best way to describe it. Not great, but no real complaints, except for the pile of mush in the corner of the plate. It wasn't mashed potato or polenta and I still can't identify it but couldn't be bothered to ask the waitress what it was.  It didn't taste good and wasn't presented well. It was just a scoop of mush.  At least pipe it through a whipping bag so it sits pretty, I don't know, something.  Nothing had much flavor except for the fig chutney, which was too sweet for me and didn't really seem to go with the dish, but it seemed they had to throw it on cause the name of the restaurant after all is FIG and olive.     I had the chocolate pot de crème for dessert.  It's just a fancy way of saying chocolate custard with a crunchy praline on the side. And it was delicious.  It didn't look like much when the waitress brought it out. I wasn't too excited, since the meal had thus far been mediocre at best.  But when I took a bite, I absolutely did a double take.  I thought it was phenomenal!        A $36 prix-fixe dinner is not a bad deal, but this meal was definitely just mediocre. However, this place has potential.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong dishes. However, I didn't enjoy being rushed out the door.  The waitress brought us our check after the desserts without even asking if we wanted anything else. After I pointed that out and asked for another drink, she apologized, revised the check and brought it out again. Still not asking if we needed anything else.  Maybe I wanted another drink, maybe she just wanted us out. Won't be giving this place another shot.",0,0,0,Catherine Y.,"Queens, NY",6,54,195

I think I just fell asleep sitting up with bread in my hand).However, the avocado, radish, and pine nut Crostini woke me and my palate up.  It was delicious, but it was also the standout in our crostini order.  The others (Manchego and the bell pepper one) weren't so good.  I then had the grilled lamb skewers as my entree.  The lamb was perfectly cooked and served on rosemary twigs for skewers (nice touch), however, the couscous left something to be desired.  Also, since I have a quick fork hand, I was also able to steal...er, sample... some of the grilled chicken with eggplant caviar from one of my dining companions.  It was so so.  All in all, pretty tasty but doesn't have the chops to become a staple in my repertoire.",7,11,4,Jason H.,"New York, NY",77,112,5
2.0,1/13/2009,"I want to preface this review by stating I've only had their brunch. That said, I was pretty disappointed with the food. The space is lovely and completely relaxing for a nice Sunday brunch, but the food just didn't deliver the taste.To begin, I started my brunch with the bread basket and olive oil of course! The olive oil (and fig spread) at Fig & Olive is divine, I will give them that. The oil was distinctly fruity with a nice acidic, fragrant taste. For the next portion of my meal, I had the Cote d'Azur fish soup, which I thought was very good. For fish and seafood lovers, go with this soup if you are curious. I will add, however, that it is very openly fishy tasting (and it's supposed to taste that way). The tomato-based broth contained little pieces of white fish and was slightly tangy. It was simply delicious with bread on the side.For my main entree, I had the Mediterranean (Italian) Cassolette. This dish was very disappointing. It took half an hour to prepare and when it came out, it deceptively made my mouth water (see uploaded pic). Upon digging in however, it was clear that the cassolette was way overcooked.

2.0,11/24/2008,"This is not Greek.  This restaurant is best described as an American restaurant with Mediterranean influences.    And one that is not that  good.I made reservations for 8PM as my husband was flying in that day to join me in NYC.   From the window outside, it looked to be quite the romantic restaurant. The seats in the front of the restaurant had plenty of space.  However, we sat in the back where there was not even five inches of space between the tables.  It was loud.  Not in, I'm having a great time, loud as in, I could barely hear my husband sitting across from me.  I might have forgiven the lack of ambiance but the food was mediocre.  While my husband enjoyed his soup, my was just ok.  I did enjoy my appetizer of sea scallops but my husband felt that his carpaccio was just ok.  Overall, it was a mediocre experience.  I'm not one to settle so I won't be back.",1,0,0,Miss J.,"Chicago, IL",452,594,2

3.0,10/6/2008,"This restaurant has all the ingredients to be a proud product of a culinary mastermind but I dropped a few stars for the actual taste/quality of the end product.I've heard great things about this place (I believe they have at least two or three more locations in Manhattan) and although I usually frown upon chain restaurants, I've heard enough good things that I wanted to give this place a try.The ambiance is very trendy- done in glowing white and sleek silver encased by flickering tea lights. The waiters are all very buttoned-up and polished in their charcoal shirts and dark slacks. They were very attentive and friendly.My friend and I ordered the 6-cheese sampler as a starter. It came with crostini that provided a nice crunchy foundation for the cheese-tasting.There was a nice pungent gorgonzola, a delicious goat cheese, a not-so-wonderful rochetta (probably due to the mix of too many animals, sheep, goat AND cow), and a wonderful Taleggio (very flavorful and creamy). There were also the two always reliably delicious manchego and pecorino cheeses. The platter also came with a sweet fig jam that Fig & Olive makes in-house. It was a wonderful palette cleanser in between all that creaminess.They had a nice wine selection full of reds/whites and all that in between. We opted for a bottle of the Don Giovanni (2007) which was a great mix of pear and vanilla notes. Sweet but not overbearing and very crisp and clean.I have a problem with indecisiveness when it comes to food (and trust me, their entire menu is written so eloquently that you'll have this problem too). Luckily they had trio samplers to cure my little problem.I got the Trio Del Mer and my friend got the Fig & Olive Mediterranean Tasting.Mine came with a crispy fish called Branzino- which was good but a little dry. The salmon was done very well- very juicy although the couscous it was served with was a little bland. The tangerine in the couscous provided a nice kick to the dish though. Lastly there was a scallop (and I really mean ONE) that was seared very nicely and paired with a delicious artichoke tapenade.My friend's tasting course came with grilled chicken, lamb skewers and grilled shrimp. I was a little upset that they didn't put it came with tomatoes and avocado on the menu. My friend's allergic to avocado so he couldn't eat the shrimp...I thought that put a damper on an otherwise lovely meal. I thought it deserved five stars for presentation, service and ambiance but the quality/taste of the food was slightly higher than mediocre.

That's b/c they have the good stuff here, these are imported olives, not olives out of a tin can...which is why I think he hates them in the first place.

2.0,11/6/2007,"Man, how I wanted to love this place. I drooled over the menu in my lonely little office for weeks before the gals and I found time to make a reservation. Last Friday night, a little chilly but overall nice night we three headed into Fig & Olive for our 9:30 reservation. The service was pretty good, no complaints there, but where the stars were missing was with the food. Sigh. The menu reads like a culinary masterpiece, each description causing more and more lip smacking and tummy grumbling, but alas, the food did not live up to the prose. We ordered mostly sharing dishes, the seared de-boned quail with figs and endive (sounds good right?) The figs were nothing special (um they're in your name, dear restaurant) and the quail was neither flavorful nor de-boned (learned that one the hard way). Next was the crab croquettes with caper & harissa olive oil emulsion. They were mini crab cakes with what pretty much resembled tartar sauce, except I've had better crab cakes from the frozen food section of my local Dag's. Seriously. (And I do make a mean pair of cakes myself, thanks to Tyler Florence's awesome recipe, yeah yeah, ask and I'll share :)After that we had the Grilled Asparagus, pancetta and mushrooms with puff pastry. 3 Spears of asparagus on top of a giant rectangle of puff pastry, with some mushroom spread and pancetta, which more resembled mom's sunday brunch bacon (extra crispy points there :) The rest of it was... hey, want some food with your puff pastry? I mean really, so far i could recreate the majority of this meal for much less money and in much better taste by freezing my butt off in the last aisle at the grocery store, but I digress...Jen got the butternut squash soup. Ever since we had it at Punch in Feb the girls have been obsessed with this hearty vegetable. Well, maybe we were spoiled by that lovely evening, because even though the menu said the soup was made with apples and celery root and sage, it tasted pretty much like pureed squash to rival gerber's famous food. (Yes that's right, I'm talking about baby food here and another trip to Dag's, yeech) two bites of that and were were ready to sip our wine and get on with our evening... When we finally found our waitress she quickly brought us our bill, which we split as usual on three cards and she brought 3 pens, such a nice touch. We left, went somewhere else for more food (we were still hungry and totally not satisfied) And when I got home that evening, I made a call, which I assure you was not alcohol induced (I would tell you) and ordered chocolate chip pancakes.

A place that conveys such an alluring sense of beauty must deserve 5 stars, and my aesthetic nerves were delighted beyond belief. But the food is what we had come to sample, and alas, it was weak.We ordered the Mediterranean Greek Salad, which was blah, and then did a couple of Crostinis of which the best was the Bresaola, w goat cheese and black olive. MiG had the Artichoke one with asparagus and tomato, and I had the Prosciutto, ricotta and fig (blah! part deux)I also ordered the Salmon tartar with shallots and olive oil, and it was so bland that my memory has no recollection of the taste; it was as if I had never eaten it.The wine was another bone of contention; we ordered a Rioja Tempranillo '00 by the glass (excellent), and asked the waiter to recommend another one. He pointed out an Almansa Monastrell '02, which was just ok (blah! part 3)Dessert was our redemption song, and the strawberries on vinegar were delish.Now, I know that I must make 3 or 4 more runs in order to make an unbiased assesment (and I must try their olive with thyme), but I'm not turning the bias switch on, because not only I have given them my highest rating per my JARP static.px.yelp.com/photo…  but I also think this place is an epicurean oasis, and it's so beautiful that I would trade bland food any day 4 a piece of this crisp beauty.",6,2,7,Javier M.,"New York, NY",723,387,174

5.0,6/4/2007,"On our walk down from Central Park to Lexington, my friend and I passed by this place. It was like love at first sight. I spotted this place, stopped, and glanced at the menu posted outside. Within 30 seconds I was sold -- I wasn't even planning to eat that afternoon, but we headed on inside anyway. Olives + olive oil + Italian = totally sold. We walked in without a reservation and the staff was very nice. This place reminds me one of my favorite chains in Asia, Afternoon Tea (afternoon-tea.net/index.… -- orginally from Japan, but I love the one in Taiwan).  I loved the interoir - a cozy, wooden floored space with bottles of olive oil sold in the front, little tables in the back, and also a long high table with bar stools that's good for dining alone. When I got the menu, I studied it for a good 20 minutes. Everything looked really good, and if it weren't for the price I would've ordered 4 or 5 things. They had a limited, but good tea selection and a long wine list for beverages. Then for appetizers, they have crostini and carpaccio. There's salad, pasta, soup, and entree. I know that sounds like a typical menu, but everything had an exquisite flare to it. I can't explain it, but everything looked really interesting and inviting. After wavering between a few dishes, I finally gave into my hunger and decided to just settle on the penne funghi. It was absolutely delicious!

3.0,1/13/2006,I love their olive oil not only for their taste but also because it is healthy and is reduce my cholesterol (FDA says that daily consumption of olive oil reduces the cholesterol). The dishes and setting exhume the Mediterranean region. I highly recommend this Restaurant.,0,0,0,Chinku G.,"Hicksville, NY",21,541,0
5.0,1/3/2006,"I absolutely love this restaurant!  The food is excellent and fun to eat, especially if you order the tasting platters with a group.  Tasting the olive oil was especially interesting- they really are incredibly varied.   The staff was very accomodating, complete with recommendations and explanations.  The wine was fantatic.  While the restaurant is certainly not exclusive or even crowded, it's best to play it safe with a reservation so you won't have to wait (although sitting at the bar and enjoying their wine is not exactly torture).  This is one of those places that feels like one of those best kept secrets, safely tucked away on the Upper East Side- great value, great food.  And yet a lot of people seem to know about it, so it really must be it's great charm that keeps it lowkey.",0,0,0,Melissa S.,"New York, NY",2,19,0
