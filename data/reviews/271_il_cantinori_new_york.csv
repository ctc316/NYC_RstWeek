I came with a large group to celebrate my friend's birthday and pay homage to Carrie Bradshaw.  The restaurant was relatively full on a Friday night- fortunately we made reservations. The service was attentive from beginning to end  We kept the champagne and wine flowly and the owner gifted us a bottle of Prosecco which was a nice touch!We came during Restaurant Week and I thoroughly enjoyed the offerings. Highlights of our meals included the caprese salad,hazelnut gelato, allll the pastas and the filet mignon. The food was well prepared and flavorful.

2.0,12/18/2018,First off what's with the Italian guy with the Ascot who looks like Euro trash staring you down as if you're taking too long at the table (it was only an hour)? The shrimp and pasta dish was poor-iodine tasting shrimp. The bread was excellent and they give you some nice bruschetta with it to start. There are no American wines on the menu-only Italian so study up! The waiter wasn't overly friendly and could have been a bit nicer. A lot of people waiting by the front door when you arrive trying to whisk you to a table ASAP. It seems they are trying to turn over their tables quickly which is their top priority. For the price the portions aren't large...there are so many other places to choose from in NYC.,0,0,0,Janice B.,"Ridgewood, NJ",50,8,3
2.0,12/4/2018,"The worst service I've ever had in New York City: the waiter was rude throughout and spoiled a lovely evening. The rest of the restaurant patrons were obnoxious too.

The sauce, crumbled sausage, peas, and pasta were so tasty. Really, everything about this dish was fantastic. It's a good portion for one person. 2.

Dimly lit and romantic but also great for group dinners/friend dinners. SERVICE: The service is the reason why I am giving four stars. At a high-end restaurant the service should be impeccable.

There were also fresh, fragrant flowers everywhere! The bread came out immediately, and soon after we got a tomato stew on a plate that was delicious. Our appetizer and meals came out quickly.

5.0,11/9/2017,"At Il Cantinori, I drink with Mr. King. Being a good artist means creating versions of myself I deem high art. The work is a mere extension of the self. We have a bottle of wine in an ice bucket. It's a wine I've never heard of. Not Cabernet Sauvignon (my usual choice), or Pinot Grigio, or Chardonnay. It's nothing that tires my arms on the train ride home from Trader Joes. It's better stuff. Mr. King has been here before. The maître d' knows him not only by name, but by his dates, celebrations, his demand for a certain table (the restaurant isn't large and a loud birthday party can envelope it). Once a large group of women were laughing very loudly; it was clearly girls' night out for gossip. Perhaps to gripe about work or which coffee runner they wanted to take advantage of. When their laughter grew to the point of absurdity, Mr. King and I overhead the man at the next table joke with his date, saying, ""Can they be any more desperate?"" And Mr. King made wide eyes at me, blushing. Il Cantinori is a place for fine white plates and ecru hard cheese working against them in camouflage. Sizable plates of well-salted pasta. I place their antipasti Salumi on my tongue and it melts. I failed to show up in my usual bow tie, for this time I'm visiting and daytime running around the city with Lauren, my lovely girlfriend. She wishes she could be here, and if I were bold, I'd have asked Mr. King if it were ok for her to join. But this is alone time. Mr. King is of great stature, and refuses to eat anywhere less grown-up as Il Cantinori. We talk about work here, one bottle of wine down. We order another glass. Our dinner takes a bit longer than usual to arrive. There's something going on in the kitchen, perhaps a new line cook, a flustered staff, we're not sure. There's a lot in the world to delay ones' dinner. I know being emotional and inefficient at work, having been in perpetual fights with the redhead on my phone, my eyes always on my lap like it was a hollow pit, wondering where it disintegrated to. Before Lauren, I knew much bitterness with the redhead. Lauren doesn't judge that relationship, she's had dysfunctional ones, too. But it's all fresh, the near overlap of lovers, her and Mr. King are well-seasoned in. The fish finally arrives, fresh and well-seasoned, too. He gives me advice. He says it doesn't sound like I'm ready for committing to anything and that he was once in my shoes. He says I'm talented and the love of my life will knock me into a vat of wine so opaque I won't see my nose. We never complained about the long wait time. Though our agitation turned out to be discernable by the maître d', who, with our check, brought us a giant plate of every dessert they offered. We are glowing with wine and pasta steam and we smile. Cheers. And go in for the same scoop of ice cream, clanking spoons, laughing. Optimistic about what may come from our new endeavor together. The art scene will surely suffer some kind of tremor.",2,1,3,Jamie B.,"Los Angeles, CA",52,83,14

4.0,10/18/2017,"Came to Il Cantinori on a Friday night and immediately fell in love due to the phenomenal flower arrangements they have. They add an amazingly fresh scent as you walk through the room before you are hit with an aroma of amazing italian dishes.Before you even order, the staff at Il Cantinori will place bread, a salami and parmigiano reggiano platter, and individual servings of their homemade tomato sauce on your table. I was practically full by the time the waiter took our order, but nevertheless, it was all amazing. The tomato sauce was pretty good, but it was the long salami (not the round) pieces that blew me away. The parmigiano reggiano was also delicious.As for the entrees, we ordered the pappardelle, the risotto, and the farfalle. The pappardelle was pretty good--I absolutely loved the texture of their homemade pasta, and the sausage was delicious as well. Overall, the entire dish was ok, but I wasn't a fan of how the peas sweetened the dish. The risotto was my favorite dish since it was so strongly flavored--especially with onions, but the flavor of the mushroom wasn't as strong as I was expecting. As for the farfalle dish, it was light and had their homemade pasta which I am a sucker for, but the dish as a whole was nothing to write home about.The restaurant also had a great staff, wine selection, and play list.

Our waiter never returned until we finally got his attention.    How was dinner? He could have carried less (It was not good, my sausage was so dry I couldn't finish it.)  Did we need another drink ?  To bad... anything else?  Oh well!  It was an ordeal to get an after dinner drink or sorbet.

My wife's Campari and soda was fine, but nothin to that. The wine (Italian Sangiovese) was good.The beets in my wife's arugula salad were cut into too large, dry cubes and the greens were hardly dressed. The walnuts were too large too - not even chopped. All for $20, ridiculous.The polenta and speck app I had was full of fat and inedible. I told them to take it back and got the asparagus milanese app. It was horrible. Again, another $20 thrown away. I've had much better for $15 or even $10.The entrees (Bronzini for me and Steak for the wife) were ok but completely unimaginative. Just meat and potatoes or meat and vegetables....dry and boring.Dessert sucked - profiteroles. Came out in 5 minutes. Obviously horrible and pre-made.This place is frequented by locals (thank god I'm no longer one of them) and suburban idiots who probably say prosciutt or mozzarell, who rubber stamp the horrible food and pompous service.

No one from our ""party of 6"" is there. They notice I am frazzled and the owner gives me his phone charger and made me feel so welcome. I said screw everyone else. I'm eating here! My waiter was a delightful man from Kansas. He was on point with my drink refills and I was triple fisting it. Water. Diet Coke. Woodford. I refused a menu and just told the owner and waiter to surprise me with a dish. I was served the most amazing plate of pasta I've ever had. Now I don't have the most sophisticated palate and I don't get out much, but this was exquisite. Strips of pasta in. Creamy tomato sauce with crumbles sausage and peas. It was divine. For dessert, I also told them to surprise me. It seemed to work the last time! I was brought the most amazing platter of fine Italian desserts known to man. A hazelnut ice cream sandwich. Tiramisu.

2.0,2/3/2017,"I'm a New Yorker and over the years have visited Il Cantinori and always rated it very highly.  However, I was there last night and think that will be my last visit.  It has slipped a lot.It appears as though there are more tables than ever in the front part of the restaurant so each time a patron or waiter walked by, chairs were jostled....simply too many tables/chairs for the space.I ordered from the Restaurant Week menu and it was good value in terms of the price for three courses.  The rollatini as a starter was excellent but the filet of sole was overcooked.  The chocolate cake for dessert was good but the coffee really no different than what you would get at a diner... really not up to what should be served in a good Italian restaurant.  The prices on the a la carte menu are very high.We felt rushed initially... we had barely finished our first course when the main dishes arrived... the server was unable to serve them since the first course dishes had not been removed.  Overall the service was poor... very perfunctory without any graciousness.However, what was MOST annoying is that there were two tables which were very loud... they had obviously had a lot to drink which is fine (we've all been there) but we learned they were ""regulars"" and so were generally seated in the back of the restaurant but not that night.  The staff was very chummy with them (probably good tippers) and there were lots of hugs and Hi-5's between the diners and staff.  Great, but the rest of us were miserable since it was impossible to have a conversation at our table of 4 because of all the whooping and hollering.  One of my fellow diners commented to the manager that this type of behavior was unacceptable since it interfered with the ability of everyone else to have a pleasant dinner.  The manager was fairly rude and said something to the effect of, ""What do you want... it's a restaurant"".In summary.... Il Cantinori is squeezing too many tables into too small a space and management is taking its eye of the ball when it comes to ensuring that everyone, not just the regulars, are enjoying a quality meal.  Don't go if you have any interest in conversation.",0,0,1,Christine H.,"Manhattan Valley, Manhattan, NY",0,41,2

Unfortunately, the third time was not the charm for us. Ordering from the RW menu seemed to have relegated us to second class as it was. But even before we ordered, we weren't met with the greatest of niceties.  No smile from the manager, just the long walk to the back corner away from anyone and anything. Next, we were never offered a wine list or beverages. We had about 5 minutes (or less) between courses. Dessert was offered without the option of coffee. We were also never offered any grated parmesan or black pepper, as tables around us were. Service was attentive to a degree, but not friendly or engaging. Surprising, and disappointing, but based on our previous better experiences, we're not ready to shut the door.",0,1,0,Matthew R.,"Queens, NY",6,52,5

Lots of fresh flowers you can smell everywhere.  Free coat check was nice too.  Also - for wine drinkers: they do very generous pours, as they should when the wine is $17 a glass - but still it was appreciated ;)Service very good and attentive.  They started us off with some fresh bread, olive oil and chunky tomato sauce to dip.  VERY good!I ordered the minestrone as an appetizer.  Delicious! Rigatoni for a entree was very good as well.Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars:  A friend of mine got the risotto w/ pear and gorgonzola (I can't remember if this was on the regular or restaurant week menu) and they did not list that it contains nuts!!

My party of 8 was seated in the back room, underneath an opaque skylight and amid gigantic floral arrangements. Truly charming.The staff was super accommodating as well - brought chairs over for guests stopping in, prompt on water and drink service. They even split an appetizer for my boyfriend and I onto two plates to avoid mess.The food, however, was not up to par for Italian in NYC (admittedly a very high bar). The amuse bouche was a bread and tomato sauce mush at room temp - definitely just a way for them to recycle yesterday's bread. (Side note here - the bread is delicious and they bring you enormous variety and quantities.) My red snapper entree was way overcooked and flavorless, and I found bits of skin and bone in the filet. $33 for something I could have made better, and for way less money, at home.

The pasta is also cooked to perfection which is often somehow left unachieved by Italian restraints.However, what sets this place apart from other higher end Italian fare in the city is the service.

5.0,2/23/2015,"Hurray for NYC's Restaurant Week and Il Cantinori for being a part of it!  After sifting through a million restaurants that offer the $25 lunch/$38 dinner three-course meal (an absolute bargain for pasta, steak, seafood), I finally came across Il Cantinori and reserved for a late Friday lunch.  The restaurant was not very full, but it still offered a nice ambience.  You could absolutely tell you were in an upscale Italian restaurant - the white linen tablecloths adorned with the signature olive oil and fresh roses in a glass (which by no means were overwhelming once we had stepped inside and adjusted our noses).  We had several waiters, but all of them were so friendly and accommodating.  They always took our dishes away and did not rush us with the check at all.  Onto the food... I had their eggplant appetizer - creamed spinach and tomato sauce wrapped in a thin slice of eggplant.  It seems really small, but it is extremely hearty and delicious.  My friend opted for their lentil soup - also very delicious!  I also had their salmon - it was just a perfect portion.  Smothered in creamy mustard sauce (also hearty enough that the cream almost masked the mustard), the salmon was perfect: soft and pink.  They also have vegetarian option of pasta - head for the rigatoni, the portion may seem a bit small but the sauce is very hearty.  There were string beans that accompanied this salmon, but obviously the salmon stole the show.  For dessert, we tried the tiramisu and it could not have been prepared any better.  Just a bit of fresh fruit and delicious cream can really make a difference for your tiramisu.Also, did I mention that the bread is just to die for?  It's not your traditional focaccia bread - it's a more traditional leavened bread that was airy and fluffy (I know, I had their delicious salmon and here I am raving about their complimentary bread, which they did give us many baskets of after realizing how much we loved their bread!).  Il Cantinori is definitely the star of Restaurant Week right now in terms of Italian food.  Definitely a must try!",8,0,2,Janice F.,"Manhattan, NY",573,503,401

2.0,2/18/2015,"I had high hopes for Il Cantinori, having always wanted to dine here, so knowing I'd be coming from an event around the corner, I made a RW reservation.  The first problem materialized no sooner than our unwelcome-feeling entrance- at least 3 servers watched us standing by the hostess stand waiting to be seated, and finally one asked if we'd been helped.  I said no, and informed him about our reservation.  He took a quick glance around, and tried to stick us us at the table beside us, by the cold door and incoming traffic, which didn't even look completely made up for service.  No thanks - I asked to be moved to the other available front table, which they declined, so we went to the back room, which was nice... until I got a whiff of the disgusting half-dead lillys in the giant bouquet directly next to the table.  They permeated the room so strongly.  They are beautiful flowers, no doubt, but they have ZERO place in any sort of food establishment - they are so overpowering and compete with the air for your attention, and greatly diminish any flavor experience you might be trying to enjoy.  We had already asked to be moved once, so I felt uneasy about being moved to a 3rd table on account of their unfortunate flower decor choices.  Sadly, our meal experience (rollatini and chicken liver to start, ravioli and rigatoni main, with a generous glass of Montepulciano) was greatly diminished by the horrendous lily smell, so we asked to be moved for our final course.  The food: good, but I couldn't help but feel they were serving leftovers or trying to clean out their freezer for RW.  There just wasn't anything that special about the meal that would make me want to come back.  Service: Rude welcome, super aloof service, (though our server def warmed up as the meal progressed). Overall, we felt like we were intruding on someone's party, it was quite unacceptable hospitality.  I felt like we were unwelcome guests throughout our meal - this place seems to only cater to regulars.Ambiance: I have to question any management who would agree to put forests of stinking lilies all over their restaurant.  The roses on the tables were a beautiful touch, but the lilies were horrific.That's one of the good things about RW - it makes you decide to which places you return for a ""real"" meal- this won't be one of them for us.",6,1,0,Cynthia L.,"New York, NY",0,41,10

Normally when I have an underwhelming experience I'll give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt. This is not the case here. So I'll get the standard points of experience out of the way and then explain why I won't be returning.The decor: Quite lovely. Real flowers on the tables which is always a nice touch. The restaurant is separated into two areas, the front and the back. Great natural lighting in the back which is like an enclosed garden patio but they also have very large glass windows on the street-facing wall up front, which becomes important later on in the story.The service: Prompt, a little aloof.The food: Nothing to write home about. Appetizers (eggplant rollatino and lentil soup) were decent but came out lukewarm, entrees (chicken filet and veal ravioli) were salty and dry, and desserts (tiramisu and flourless chocolate torte) were beautifully presented but unmemorable in taste.The deal-breaker:Upon arrival, we were immediately asked if we were with the [insert other Asian name] party who was already seated. We were not, but that's fine. The restaurant was otherwise empty. Easy mistake. We were then led to the back room where the aforementioned patron, an Asian woman, was waiting for her dining partners.Throughout the course of our meal, four more tables were seated in the same area as ours. All Asian patrons. At first it seemed pretty hilarious. What are the chances; six parties in a row and everyone is Asian, right?However, when we left, we exited through the dining area in the front of the restaurant where there were four tables of all Caucasian diners who were obviously seated after we were.Maybe it was a coincidence, maybe it wasn't. Maybe it was thinly veiled segregation. Either way, the whole vibe of it all didn't exactly rub me the right way and I think my money will be better spent elsewhere.",23,3,1,Lesley C.,"New York, NY",185,30,13

He was so eager to get us drinks when we first asked for water. The bread was so so; the pastas homemade but not fabulous--where was the lobster with all the red sauce? the risotto is made better and more tasty in my kitchen, the chicken Milanese good but not great, and so on, and the vodka gimlet awful!

The quality of the ingredients they start with combined with the creativity of the specials they invent is just remarkable.  Tonight I had the special Kale and Anchovy salad, followed by the Pappardelle Alla Buttera and both were equally delicious. The special Roasted Squab when they have it is not to be missed. There is always a remaining squab count circulating throughout the restaurant when it's is on the menu and they go fast  :)I don't think it is possible for a restaurant to have better service.

Close your eyes and picture this: grilled salmon with a side of risotto... Yum. Anyways, we stumbled across il cantinori because my friend wanted to find a restaurant that had good risotto because I really wanted to try it. This restaurant can make any type of risotto, you just have to ask.We started with the insalata tricolore, it was refreshing. I then ordered a wild mushroom risotto and my friend ordered veal. The risotto was very good. I would have preferred if the mushrooms were cut a little smaller. You have to eat risotto fairly quickly because it gets cold fast and once cold, its not great.For dessert I ordered the bread budding and my friend ordered a cannoli. I wasn't a fan of either.The service was fantastic. We got up to leave and everyone was so friendly and said goodbye.

The Chicken milanese is so bomb, I don't know if it's on the menu, but they will make it for you if you ask (it's not like a huge chunk of fried chicken, the pound it so thin, it tastes barely fried - it's wonderful).**They will make any pasta vegetarian, have no fear, and the risotto is amazing.

5.0,11/14/2014,"This place is really good but I've never had to pay out of pocket so I can't comment on value. Food is top notch both in quality and uniqueness; ambiance is impeccable/location is amazing, and service is very good, as you'd expect from a place of this caliber.I've had the veal milanese before and this thing is DELICIOUS. It's a huge hunk of veal and the milanese really draws out the flavor, though note that I have no idea how much it costs so that could add to my favorable appraisal. I've also had the bolognese pasta and I believe the restaurant uses lamb to make and this is also very good. Other than that, their caprese is good, chicken livers for appetizers are also delish, and their desserts are also on point (the pistachio ice cream thing covered in a chocolate shell is very well done). One of the best parts about this place is their unlimited bread basket--the square shaped breads are especially awesome; they're extremely chewy, buttery tasting, and melt in your mouth. The waiters also provide mounds of butter that they generously refill upon request.Ambiance is great - sorta dimly lit venue with a tuscan feel, light music playing the back, and large tables (especially for this area of town) that are widely spread such that it's intimate but you definitely get your own space and by no means will overhear any conversations but that of your own party. The tablecloths, wine glasses, and everything are also quite nice.Service is amazing but that may be because the member of my party who I come with is BFF with the owner and everyone here.",0,0,0,Amy G.,"San Francisco, CA",451,340,14

4.0,8/18/2014,"I came here for restaurant week with my girlfriend and another couple last week. Having read the reviews, I was very excited for the meal, but didn't really understand how the experience could be so well received by almost all reviewers.This restaurant truly gets how service should be. Every customer was treated as if they were the wait staff's favorite regular. For an example, my friend ordered something he'd never eaten before to try, as it was restaurant week. He wasn't too fond of it, but didn't complain, as it was really his own fault for ordering it. The assistant waiter came to clear appetizer plates, and noticing he hadn't eaten much of it, offered to bring him out an alternate appetizer. Small gestures like this, which really cost the restaurant some pocket change, go a LONG way to making a customer's dining experience and making them come back.The atmosphere in the restaurant is very comfortable. No tables seemed too close together, and our table for four was plenty spacious and isolated enough to allow for conversation. Perfect for dates or small groups.The food was all very tasty. I ordered eggplant rollatine as an appetizer, and a ravioli dish with chopped veal on top as my entree. The eggplant was good, but the raviolis  were superb. My girlfriend ordered the skirt steak, which was tasty, but marinated in a sauce a bit too salty for my taste. I almost wish I hadn't ordered off the restaurant week menu. Everything on the normal menu and the specials were very reasonably priced. I love when Italian restaurants have house-made papardelle, so that will be my go-to next time.I look forward to getting back to Il Cantinori for another authentic Italian meal sometime soon.

Reluctantly they forked over a card and paid. Hysterical.Il Cantinori used to be THE spot for the fashion crowd, but it's managed to stand the test of time and become a neighborhood staple. Nothing too fancy and frilly or innovative, just good casual italian fare in a warm inviting space. I love the huge flower arrangement at the bar, and back dining room with the sky lights. Friendly service, simple classics that aren't going to break the bank.  They also manage to take care of large groups well by dividing up the courses and plating everything separately which is nice. (One occasion with a large group of 10 guys we did appetizer / pasta / meat course which they spaced out perfectly). It's the simple touches that matter. Another occasion during a winter storm I was there with just a friend and they created a pasta dish off the menu just for him b/c he was in the mood for ""something different"".

This makes such a huge difference at an Italian restaurant, where the timing of food is crucial to its enjoyment.We started off with a bruschetta, which had absolutely the right amount of seasoning. It was fresh, perfectly peppery, and delicious.We then moved onto a pasta and gnocchi, which were easily either number one or two of the pastas I had in the city. The vodka sauce on the gnocchi was light, yet flavorful.And then there was the ribeye and lobster. Perfect cooked steak, and succulent lobster. The mashed potatoes and green beans were buttery, garlicky and out of this world. We finished it off with a fluffy, moist yet not soaked tiramisu.

This restaurant, which supposedly was a neighborhood favorite circa the 1980s, and seems to have enjoyed quite some hype due to a certain Sex in the City episode (late 1990s) as well as more recent celebrity patronage, has apparently become a shadow of its former self today.The dining experience we had on Friday was frightfully bad. The chicken liver was rubbery, overcooked, and strange. The ""steak"" was an absolute joke - it had the look, taste and texture of a standard pot roast with the kind of sauce you'd expect from the fast-food chain Sbarro's. I have had numerous steaks while dining out, some brilliantly done, others lackluster, but this one came to us as a complete shock. It leads one to wonder whether the kitchen substituted some other kind of meat for the supposed ""skirt steak."" Disheartened, we made a request to substitute another dish ""filet of sole"" for the problematic steak, but the fish came out tasting overpoweringly vinegary as if it had been prepared in the same way as a jar of pickled herring!In other words, this place, despite its reported former glory, has become a veritable scam that diners should avoid at all cost.Oh, did I mention that they also charged us for the sole in the end?

5.0,7/24/2013,"My mom and sister and I dined her during restaurant week and our experience couldn't have been better. The customer service was excellent - we had an open table reservation for 10PM but walked in at 9:30 and were seated right away. All three of us opted not to partake in the restaurant week special so we could taste entrees from their normal menu. I order the calf's liver (best I've ever had in my life), my sister got the veal ravioli (very rich but equally as tasty), and my mom got the sausage risotto special (also amazing). Our waiters were perfectly attentive, not overbearing at all, and when they would come over they were very personable. We ended up getting a round of prosecco and a glass of chianti free of charge - not for any particular reason, they just brought them out to us! Excellent customer service, great food, great experience. A final word: don't come here expecting to eat twenty first century Italian fusion progressive blah blah food. That's not what this place is about. It's the Italian-style family environment, the delicious and traditional Italian food, and the experience that sets Il Cantinori apart.

But far from anything else what makes IL Cantinori unique is the quality of the food. The quality of their Buffalo mozzarella is unprecedented, The papardele with the peas and sausage is definitely the best pasta dish I have ever had, their steak with the sauteed rosemary on top makes 90% of NYC steakhouses look like McDonald's.

3.0,4/4/2013,I really want to give this place a poor poor review- but I can't- here';s why.  Absurdly busy for a Wednesday night 8:30 reservation. Even though there were tables open they had us wait for over 30 min.  When the bartender finally came over (he was just chatting it up with others)- he was very very rude in how he asked us if we wanted a drink (you want a drink or not?- ARE YOU KIDDING). I slowly took a breath and said- you know what- not. I think we will wait to sit.  They just lost the order for two high priced scotch drinks. Awful.When they finally seated us- it was 30 min later that I went to the owner and asked if we could order. He seemed surprised but come on?  they were so under staffed that everyone was overwhelmed.  Being patient- we got a quick blow through what they could do in the kitchen.  VERY noisy- but that doesn't bother me- it was the kind of noisy of people laughing etc- but- still VERY loud and could potentially be annoying to many (as it was my date)  The manager bought over two glasses or champagne as a gesture- very kind (not great to drink but the gesture was much appreciated). The tre-colore salad was excellent- I had the whole bronzino (I like to fillet it myself)- it was very good.  My date- well they bought him the wrong dish.  He had a few bites of his- but then we just shared my dish.  I tried to diffuse myself and was being chatty with the waiter- he was super nice but overwhelmed. On his own he had them make a small order of the correct pasta.  eh- the pasta was just eh at best- sadly.By the end of the night- we had the waiter sitting with us and we were the last to leave. They were super nice to us- so that's why I am not giving it a lower rating (if you read my reviews you know this is a negative star for me).  Everyone has bad nights- the measure of a place is not in the mistakes whty make- but in how they rectify it. They were nice enough that I would give it one more try- just one.,1,0,0,Amal S.,"New York, NY",57,286,16

To finish, I had the panna cotta with berries - it was tangy, sweet and fragrant.

1.0,9/19/2012,"Il Cantinori will never get our business - and I can't even say 'again'. I have to give a super negative review having never set foot in this establishment - so forgive me all of you who rave about their crab meat pasta and their grilled vegetables and other wonderful Italian dishes. I've never had, evidently, the privilege of tasting their food - and never will. My wife and I planned a trip to NYC in Dec of 2011 for which we made a reservation 2 months in advance to dine here. My wife checked 3 days prior to departure - 4 days prior to our reservation - to make sure that the status of the reservation was still good. A lot of you in NYC will know they had a fire last year which closed the restaurant - but we didn't. So we scrambled around to find another place at the last minute to dine. This year, for my birthday, may wife decided to do a one night weekend trip to NYC for us. She made another reservation for 9/29/12 - made it 4 months in advance. We got a phone message on 9/11/12 at home stating their apologies but they would have to cancel our reservation due to a benefit that had grown so large that they needed the entire restaurant - and so sorry for you. Now a classy manager would have offered to set up a table in the kitchen for us - something other than ""sorry"". The only thing they offered was to give us a reservation on another night (my wife told the lady on the phone that we were flying in for one night specifically to dine at Il Cantinori Restaurant) or going to their sister restaurant, a Mediterranean theme, to which we said no thank you.So I don't know who's list you have to be on to get any respect from this establishment - but fortunately for us there are many other fabulous eateries in NYC to enjoy and savor. Il Cantinori Restaurant will not be on that list for us anymore. It's their loss - because, thanks to the Internet, bad news has a way of traveling very very fast.

I ordered the gnocchi, and my husband had one of the specials, a cavatelli pasta dish with shrimp.  The gnocchi was great, in my opinion, but my husband, an Italian, said they were not the right shape.  But they still tasted great to me.  My husband really enjoyed his pasta dish as well.  We finished the night with dessert.  He had tiramisu, I had panna cotta.  We both enjoyed our desserts.  The surprise highlight of the evening was a waiter's opera-like rendition of ""Happy Birthday"" for another guest at one of our neighboring tables.  The atmosphere here is really warm and cozy, the service was great, and the food is fabulous.",1,0,0,A B.,"Jersey City, NJ",15,36,0

The food here reminds me of eating at touristy Italian restaurants in Little Italy - heavy, guaranteed to never wow you, and the food isn't flavored properly.

I had the canoli's and he got the tiramisu.  We didn't asked them to split the plates, but we did share.  Both desserts were great.  The canoli dessert was actually three small canoli served with fresh whipped cream and chocolate sauce.  They did add a little bit of orange liquer to their canoli filling, which I personally wasn't a huge fan of, however, the filling did have the right consistency and was still great dispite the slight orange flavor.  The tiramusi was light and perfect.  All in all, a great experience.  I had a great birthday dinner and will definitely be back again.  Thanks Il Cantinori and wonderful, thoughtful boyfriend!",0,0,1,Hillary R.,"Boston, MA",2,24,3

3.0,2/9/2011,"Cozy little spot that's been on my list to go to for awhile.  We went for restaurant week but the prices are reasonable enough even without the special.  Note they will do half orders of pasta, which was nice and plenty for me.  Our waiter was perfectly charming and helpful with steering us in our choices.  The only thing I did not care for was the cauliflower stew, which was more like a casserole.  It was slightly cheesy (that's good) but a huge portion, bland and just plain monotonous.  The traditional preparations of pasta were just fine.  I could see coming here a lot if I lived or worked in the neighborhood, but as I do not, it was worth a visit but will not become a regular destination for me in the future.",0,0,0,Jason N.,"New York, NY",307,671,1117

3.0,2/5/2011,"Meh, not impressed. I too came here for restaurant week - and as someone who takes advantage of restaurant week every time (and in every city!) possible, I'd say my expectations are always somewhat tempered when heading in for these deals. You know it'll be crowded, portions will be on the smaller side, and service is of a lower standard. All that being said - this was hands-down the slowest service ever. And it was a Tuesday night. And we were only 4 people. And hello, it's restaurant week - you know what everyone is ordering, get your shit together and expedite the food. Took over 2 hours to get through dinner. Caprese salad was nothing special (not that you'd really expect it to be), steak was okay - there's a lot that can be done with red meat, they put very little effort into it. My friends felt similarly about their food, especially the pasta. Not bad, but nothing special. Then for dessert, I'd heard allllllllllllllllllll this hype about the goddamn hazelnut ice cream sandwich. This was hands down the smallest sliver of a portion I've ever seen. To the point where we were laughing. It did taste good, but when is an ice cream sandwich ever going to taste anything but good? Overall, it was a fantastic night to catch up with friends over an extended dinner.

Ordered the eggplant rollatini for app and shrimp pesto dish for entree.  Both were OK but nothing special.  Pasta didn't taste home made and shrimp were minuscule pieces rather than full shrimp -- rather disappointing.  Panna Cotta was delicious but could have used fresh berries.  Restaurant appears to be over hyped - won't be returning.,6,1,0,Amy O.,"New York, NY",8,8,0

2.0,7/2/2010,"We went to this place for my boyfriend's 25th birthday because it was on the NY times top 50 restaurants list, but we won't be trusting that list again. The decor resembled an italian diner and the skylight was covered in dirty plastic. I got the spinach gnocchi with smoked salmon. The gnocchi were very mushy and the sauce tasted overly smoky and salty, but it was edible. My boyfriend got the rib eye steak. the ENTIRE plate was covered in meat, which was covered in whole sprigs of rosemary. He got through about a quarter of it before he decided he couldn't eat it anymore because it was tough and there were ribbons of fat running through it. Because it was a special, when the waiter came we asked how much it would be and he said $45, at which point my bf told him the steak was pretty terrible. He apologized and said he'd let the kitchen know. Shortly after that the manager came to our table and apologized and gave us 2 glasses of sparkling dessert wine. He also removed the steak from our bill...So that's my story with il cantinori. I'm giving them two stars because they were accommodating and the wine was very good, but the most impressive thing about this restaurant was the number of glasses the waiters could carry.

Upon arrival, our waiter approached the table with the kind of blase, disinterested attitude that immediately put me on guard. I naively hoped the night could only get better but I was wrong.I was with 2 other people and we ordered 2 appetizers, 2 pastas and 2 entrees to share. When the appetizers were brought out, they gave us a shrimp dish we did not order, said it was complimentary and then promptly removed it from our table. That left us with the polenta dish and the calamari we did order. The polenta was gummy and tasteless, the calamari average. This is where things went really wrong. The waiters made the mistake of bringing out our entrees -- lambchops and branzini -- BEFORE our pasta. The pasta dishes were mediocre as well but in retrospect they were the highlight of the meal. That's because they actually took our entrees back to the kitchen and kept them warm and reserved them to us 25 minutes later. Needless to say, the lambchops were overdone and the fish dry. There was absolutely no acknowledgment or apology issued. We requested new lambchops and what we got were  obviously the rejects -- overwhelming fatty with little edible meat. I did not send them back for a second time but I wish I had. We passed on dessert and hightailed it out of there. I will never go back.

4.0,8/13/2009,"This place is purty classy. One of my old man's favorite Italian spots, so I probably come here a few times a year when he is taking clients out for a very ""upscale"" experience. The waiter we always have is an older Italian gent who knows both the food, wine, and specials inside out and does a terrific job describing each dish. Even though it is restaurant week (all summer?) the main menu is available and that is where we ordered from. The table of four started out with a wonderful pasta first course that was not on the menu, but we requested and they said ""no problem."" Each person got their own plate that was split into 3 types of pasta. 1- was a pesto and grilled shrimp risotto, 2 - a papperdelle with a creamy red sauce, crumbled sausage, and fresh green peas, 3 - a mushroom/cheese ravioli. Each of these were so different, totally fresh and jumping ingredients, and totally scrumptious. For my main last night, I went with a special that was a bone-in rib eye. It was prepared very simply which I think is the way to go with good cuts of beef. It was grilled with a tad of olive oil, salt, and pepper. Perfect medium rare. And it was HUGE. Seriously, I'm no slouch when it comes to eating, but it easily could've served two. I brought back 3 generous slices of it and made some steak 'n eggs for breaky this am. In the past I've had both the Fegato Alla Salvia, which is a super heavy but expertly prepared calf liver cooked in butter. And also a super thin veal shank that reminds me of an Italian version of wiener shntizel. All these dishes are really great, but I think when I return next I'm just going to go with pasta. It is really that good. ADVICE: Try and dress up a bit here. I hate when I'm eating at a supper nice classy restaurant with great service, delicious wine, wonderful food and ambiance, and some putz walks in with jeans and baseball cap. It kind of brings the experience a bit down.",6,4,6,John L.,"Brooklyn, NY",95,234,0
4.0,8/3/2009,"My second restaurant week visit and my first ever 'double-date' restaurant week excursion...surprisingly fun. First and foremost, the food was absolutely amazing. Between the four of us, no more than 2 different dishes were ordered for each course, which made all of us look pretty corny. The ambiance was pretty lively, not overly bright but not a dungeon-like darkness to the restaurant. Il Cantinori is definitely a place you can go to for a great meal after a nice night out in the city. Since I don't think I've ever wound up with a better overall meal than my girlfriend, I'm going to write this review like a boxing match...you'll see why.On the left hand side: Me and my cousinOn the right hand side: My girlfriend and my cousins boyfriendRound 1: Salmon tartar for the right half of the table, eggplant appetizer for the left. The winner here was obviously team Jeff, though I do have to say, the salmon tartar was pretty delicious as well, the eggplant however had a lot more depth of flavor.Round 2: I win this alone because I'm the only one who ordered veal ravioli whereas the other three ALL ordered some sort of pesto pasta with shrimp. I'm not going to lie, their choice was pretty awesome, but again, in terms of flavors, my pretty enormous plate of finely cooked veal with perfectly cooked ravioli demolishes the competition this round.Round 3: Undeniable sweeping victory for the left side. Though hazelnut ice cream sandwich doesn't sound like something that could be better than a tiramisu, it definitely was. About an inch and a half of ridiculously rich hazelnut ice cream between two somehow soft but crisp at the same time crusts obliterated any chance the tiramisu had of saving this bout for my girlfriend's side.

2.0,7/27/2009,"I have a good friend who is the general manager of a well-to-do Midtown East restaurant who always tells me that you treat each customer well, especially in New York, because you never know if that smartly dressed couple is well off and well connected, or out for their once a month splurge dinner, or if that lone gentleman in jeans and a polo is simply lost, or is a hedge fund manager, worth so much, he doesn't care how he dresses.  I expected a restaurant such as Il Cantinori to behave according to this mantra, but alas no.My girlfriend selected this establishment as we try to do at least four restaurant week dinners each session.  Upon entry, I was impressed by the intimate lighting and exposed brick.  The restaurant was cozy but airy, with large opening windows at the front.  Upon being sat, our waiter arrived and asked if we would like a cocktail.  We declined, asking for the wine list instead.  The waiter (all 4 foot 9 of him) looked around sulkily and went off to a waiter's stand to retrieve the menu, dropped it off, and walked back to the kitchen.  I looked over the menu and selected a sangiovese I like.  The waiter returned, and was about to take our wine order, when a party of four walked in.  He immediately stopped mid-sentence at our table, and went off to seat the other table, take their cocktail orders, go to the bar, get them, and return with them.  I managed to catch his eye as he was going to another table, and he then came towards me to take the wine order.  I greeted him with a ""I'm ready to order the wine if it's convenient for you right now.""  He narrowed his eyes at me, then took the order, returning with it in short order, and then not evening handing the bottle to me, placed it on the other end of the table, making me reach for it to confirm it was what I ordered.  Classy.He took our food order from the Restaurant Week menu, and the appetizers came out quickly (a little too quickly).  I had the salmon cru, which was simply lox with some field greens on top.  My date had the eggplant, which they accidentally brought out chicken livers at first, claiming they heard her wrong.  Odd because she said when ordering ""I'm not going to try to pronounce the Italian, so I'll have that..."", pointing at the menu item.  The eggplant came out, and was literally half the portion of the normal menu.  The mains came out and were decent.  I had the chicken with prosciutto broiled on top of it.  Honestly, I've had better at Olive Garden.  My date had some anonymous pasta with pesto.  Good, but a cheap offering.  It took 25 minutes for a waiter to come clear the plates, and a further 15 for our waiter to come take our desert order.  He literally came up and said (having no menus in hand) ""what do you want  for desert?""  I asked him to tell us the options, which he quietly rattled off.  I asked him to repeat them, and he said ""There are only three...""  I ordered the pana cotta, and my date ordered the tirmaisu.  We never saw our waiter again.  Another waiter brought the check.  I'll never go here again.  Total rip off.  I'd rather go to Mott Street...",1,0,1,Matt J.,"Atlanta, GA",14,108,4

4.0,7/1/2009,"I haven't been treated so well in years!  From the moment I walked in from the teaming rain, drenched from head to toe, the Maitre d' Frank treated me like a doting big brother.  It was as though he was there to make me feel special...and I witnessed him treating every other guest the same way.  He has a warmth  and sense of humor that is a rare find in high-end, New York restaurants.  The waitstaff were equally remarkable, in particular Victor, who seemd to be everywhere at once, fulfilling everyone's needs.We (party of 3 women) were lucky enough to have a seat outside under a large protective awning...what could be better on a rainy night?  There was a wonderful vibe to the whole restaurant...parts were quiet and romantic, other areas were buzzing with happy conversations, and then there was our table...boisterous laughter!  We made a pact that all our future ""girl dinners"" would be at Il Cantinori.After reading the other reviews regading sub-par food, I have to wonder if they went to a different restaurant.  We started with the mushroom salad and the roasted califlower - both were delish!  Main courses were the veal special, rib-eye steak special, and chicken francaise.  All three were tasty.  I admit that none of us indulged in the pasta, so I can't comment on that, but eveything else was good.I'm truly looking forward to my next meal at Il Cantinori (and I hope Frank and Victor are there!)",0,0,0,Barbara G.,"New York, NY",1,16,1

2.0,2/4/2009,"Hmmm . . . Il Cantinori seemed like it would be a great experience -- very nice service, a dimly-lit, romantic vibe -- but when I visited for Restaurant Week I just wasn't impressed.  A quick glance at others' reviews tells me that some of the people who visited this restaurant during Restaurant Week also seem not to have liked it very much -- while many who visited on a regular night seem to have really liked it -- so you might want to take this review with a grain of salt . . . The restaurant decor and ambience are pleasant enough.  In the front there is a nice-sized bar, and the space itself is big and comfortable, all white tablecloths and candles and wooden furniture, but overall I thought the place a bit too quiet.  Maybe I was in the mood for something more fun and animated that night, who knows.  I don't mind high-end places with a more hushed vibe, but this place was just, well, like the library or something!  QUIET.I do not eat any beef, pork or other meats so on the Restaurant Week menu I decided to go with the mozzarella appetizer and the salmon.  I loved loved LOVED the fresh mozzarella, tomato and basil plate, because the cheese was fresh and cold and delicious and the sprigs of basil they were paired with couldn't have been more perfect.  But the salmon entree that came out afterwards was just not good.  The salmon was dry and bland, and came with some lifeless roasted potatoes and spinach.  I dunno.  I ended up eating mostly all the spinach while only picking at the potatoes and salmon.  It was just less than thrilling and I could only conclude that Il Cantinori's strong point must be their pasta and not their fish entrees.I hate to give this place two stars because their staff was so nice, prompt and helpful.  I may come back here in the future when it's not Restaurant Week to try a pasta dish and see if it's any better.  But I know, based on my recent experience, that I won't be hurrying back to do so.  There is too much good Italian in this city to think about going back to a place that didn't live up to my expectations!",1,0,1,elise h.,"New York, NY",52,243,6

1.0,1/19/2009,"Full disclaimer:  I came here for Restaurant Week.  While I expect less than spectacular food during RW, any savvy restaurateur would use RW to market to new customers.  After experiencing great RW meals at August, Centrico, and a few others, i've returned time and time again for their full priced menu.I understand that Il Cantinori is an institution in its own right in NYC.  However, that doesn't mean that you can get away with food stuck in the 80's.  Every red sauce Italian joint without imagination can knock together a competent pollo milanese or veal scaloppini without so much as breaking a sweat.  When dining on Italian, I like to see inspiration, like a Perbacco, Scarpetta or Lupa.  Cantinori's inspiration seemed to have come from Olive Garden, circa 1990.I've never hated the food at a restaurant as much as I hated the food at Cantinori.  Let's just say that i'd probably prefer the breaded chicken breast off of a Wendy's sandwich over the pollo milanese on Il Caninori's RW menu.  The pasta was greasy, dry, and monochromatic (ie.  a few shades of gray).  The salmon tasted strangely like catfish, which is not a good trait.While restaurants may hate RW, they should see it as an opportunity to attract new repeat customers.  Instead, they made sure that our party of 4 will likely never try this place again.",9,4,1,Chris H.,Hong Kong,170,603,2140
5.0,12/23/2008,"I looooove Il Cantinori.  We went in a group of 6, which the very nice waiter easily managed.  The service itself was very good, with everyone from the coat-check-girl to the manager being very friendly.  As many people have already mentioned, Il Cantinori is very romantic and a great place for a date.  The atmosphere is very elegant, with candlelit tables and bouquets of fresh flowers.  There were not any children running around while we were there, but it was also not restaurant week (which probably accounts for the lackluster experience by Caitlin O.).  Also, we decided to eat here on the spur of the moment and although we worried about how we were dressed (dark jeans, etc.), it was not a problem at all.  Some of the other patrons had jeans on, too.  Ok, so now the food.  It was absolutely deliiiiiicious.  We ordered handmade spinach dumplings in a four cheese sauce, calamari, caprese salad, spaghetti bolognese, the rib eye with herbs, and the filet of fish with tomato, white wine and vegetables. The mozzarella in the caprese salad was very yummy - extremely fresh and of high quality.  The rib eye was perfectly seasoned and cooked and the green beans were really tasty, too.  The spinach dumplings were like heaven in your mouth... you seriously don't even need teeth to eat this meal!  The dumplings just melt in your mouth and they're sooooo good.  The spaghetti bolognese was nothing life-altering, but it was good.  It was much lighter than I'm used to spaghetti being, which was nice.  Oh, and the tiramisu was the best I've ever had (although, I'm super picky about tiramisu because I hate when the taste of the brandy overpowers the other flavors in the dish).So, beside the delicious food and romantic atmosphere, there is also one other plus about this restaurant.... they give you free stuff!  The waiter was constantly letting us try various things on the menu (and items not on the menu!) and even surprised us with a free bottle of Prosecco to have with our dessert!  Looooove this place!

4.0,3/30/2008,"The reason why I love IL Cantinori it's because for some strange reason 10th is an eerily quiet street in very close proximity to the Zoo around and about Union Sq...  step into this street and you will find tranquility; I'l Cantinori's simple yet elegant facade is inviting; candlelight by the table and a sensual dimly lit room, making it perfect for a nice chill dinner over wine and music. For appetizers the Portobello platter is good, but my fav is the Calamari alla Griglia, and for main course I recommend the Rib Eye steak and the Calf's liver. The Chicken in balsamic vinegar was lukewarm however, so you can bypass it altogether.Another thing worthy of mention is the fantastic Creme Brulee with a crackling crust and a moist and mushy interior; it is delicious and has been the highlight of my meals. It was also the very first picture of food I uploaded on Yelp (albeit not in my local pics, but in my photos) and it took me this long to review.

2.0,12/29/2007,"Just got back from this place that has many split reviews and I think that if you look at who's reviewing it (aka non-NYC), you can gauge whether you'll like it or not. My wife and I got a   gift certificate for this place for Christmas, so we decided to check it out. We were directed several times to the server, who is situated in the middle of the restaurant which is a little weird and with a gruff welcome by a slick goombah manager and were directed to the coat check and led to our cramped table alongside several large parties. It's pretty inside and indeed old world; especially in the back area with large skylights that would be nice in the daytime. The appetizers are overpriced and oversized if you get one each which were decent (I got a quite good pasta e fagioli and my wife, the eggplant roll which she enjoyed). The service was prompt and attentive. My wife was underwhelmed by her special entree of linguine vongole, scallops and cherry tomatoes which ""lacked spices and some kick."" I got the papardelle with shredded pot roast and while it tasted rich and good, the homemade pasta was disappointingly overcooked. The highlight of dinner were the desserts: the pistachio tartufo was large and tasty and the tiramisu was good, not great. Even the capuccinos were a little bitter. Lastly, with 1 glass of wine and pellegrino, the bill was $140. Definitely way too pricey for the quality. Glad we didn't pay for it.

The kitchen is very accommodating - if you're in the mood for something's that not on the menu, they'll be happy to prepare it as long as the ingredients are available. Service is outstanding.
