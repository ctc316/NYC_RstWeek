4.0,3/28/2019,"I have been dining at Shun Lee Palace since the 1980s's. I am surprised at the negative reviews. It is old school ""American Chinese"" and my go to restaurant for Peking/Beijing Duck. The duck is always perfectly crispy. The garnishes are always fresh, the sauce always delicious and the pancakes always perfectly steamed. Other excellent menu items include the duck egg rolls, the perfect soup dumplings, the three pepper chicken and any of the noodle dishes. The decor is dated. The prices are a bit high, but not inappropriate for the portion size. The service is always excellent.",0,0,0,Steven S.,"New York, NY",1,54,4
1.0,3/15/2019,"MEDIOCRE....if I was paying $10-20 for an entree. Factor in a $30-45 entree price range and the restaurant is a depressing waste of time, money, and calories.The place is stale. The decor looks like it hasn't been touched since the 1980s. When I walked in to the restaurant, I had to double check the name to make sure we were in the right place.There are low ceilings which wouldn't be an issue except for the fact that the tables are packed tightly and they are stingy with air conditioning.The staff is attentive but the attire looks like it was from the same year as the decor.There is a decorative plate left at the table but the dirt on the plate distracted from its aesthetics.The steak and general tso's were...ok...at best.Save your time and order from the local chinese restaurant around the corner from your apt.",0,0,0,Jordan A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0

5.0,2/15/2019,"Last year, Valentines Day and Ash Wednesday coincided making for some ashy photos of us enjoying a vegetarian meal.  This year we doubled up on holidays again by celebrating Chinese New Year on Valentines Day.  Shun Lee was as amazing as I remembered.  The decor could use a little refreshing but the service was impeccable as ever.  I arrived a few minutes before Marcelo and the waiter who took me to our table said, ""Your wish is my command.""  When Marcelo arrived, he brought over my ""honorable guest.""  Marcelo chose the lemon chicken for his entree and I ordered my usual dry sauteed shredded crispy beef.  I have literally had dreams where I was eating that beef--so chewy with a balance of sweet and spicy flavors and the slight crunch of the leek and carrot slivers.  I had had the lemon chicken before with its crispy water chestnut flour-based breading and tangy sauce, and was delighted knowing that we would be sharing our entrees.  Also, we opted for the vegetable fried rice which lacked the oil slick that that dish often has at inferior restaurants.  I'm no food snob--neither a gourmet nor a gourmande--but this was excellent.Slightly off-topic, but Marcelo reminded me of how similar the preparation of the beef was to a llama dish he introduced me to Bolivia.  He took a picture of our meal to show his relatives that he dined upon a familiar taste sensation at an upscale Chinese restaurant.  The portions were sumptuous which was good because I had eaten a light lunch to prepare for the evening's feasting and Marcelo often does not have a chance to nibble mid-day.  Hopefully, he will be able to eat the leftovers for lunch today!  I am impressed by how much delicious food we ate last night--the walk home, carrying my tangerine-colored roses, was not only romantic but much-needed.",0,1,1,Caroline B.,"New York, NY",457,1247,36
3.0,2/11/2019,Have been here several times over the past few years. Was very disappointed during a recent visit. The food was ok but expensive compared to peers. Most disappointed in the service. We had to wave down the wait staff three times during the evening to fill water glasses and again to clear the plates.At the end of the meal we asked for the check and again had to wait much too long.

3.0,12/31/2018,"During the holidays or occasions we are working hard, our CFO buys us lunch. The past two times, we got take out from here. The first time I got something here, my dish was probably the most expensive... I got three or four lamb chops and they were really good. However, given the price (around $40). There was not much food. I shared it with my team and people ended up having to split a chop because there wasn't enough to go around. The second time, I got Neptune's net and it was a steamed seafood moment with some sauce that came with a friend potato basket. I wasn't really sure what the basket was for, but it was there. The sauce was a bit bland and there wasn't much food given how much we paid for it ($34). However, I will say the quality of the food here is good and it is on the higher end side. Our team did have a hard time figuring out which one was what dish because they didn't label anything. I was told they don't do much take out, but this was a bit frustrating. We had about 15 people and no one knew what was what. People either had to rely on my assumptions or take a bit of the food to make sure it was what they ordered. Would it have killed them to take out a sharpie and label things? Maybe? Overall, given the price point, the food isn't really worth it in my opinion.",0,0,0,Alice R.,"Manhattan, NY",10,111,4

2.0,7/27/2018,"Stop #3 on our quest for the best Peking DuckWe came for lunch so only had duck and snow pea leaves.  The snow pea leaves were well done and ran $25, which wasn't too pricey.  The duck was $50.  The meat was the highlight of the duck.  It was hot when brought to the table and fairly meaty and tender.  The skin was trimmed of fat, but lacked the extra crispy texture of other top joints.  Wings and legs were provided with the plate of sliced duck.  The legs were tasty while the wings were dry.  The sauce was a bit too thick and the pancakes were likely tortillas produced by mission.  That was disappointing for a $50 duck.  The ambiance of the restaurant is also not what it once was as the finishes are aging and the bathroom smelled of pee despite the plug in air freshener.  On top of that the head waiter passed gas audibly in the restaurant.  I'm just glad I only heard it and didn't smell it.  These are perhaps all reasons it's very easy to get a reservation.  Overall, the duck is good, but there are many others that are better.",0,2,0,Eric H.,"New Rochelle, NY",0,6,0

1.0,2/24/2018,"If there was anything less than a one star rating I would have given Shun Lee Palace a negative star. I've heard good things about Shun Lee and received raving recommendations from a few finance guys. I was ecstatic to dine there. My reservation was for 12pm. I arrived at 11:55 and was seated promptly. OMG it was the worst dining experience I've ever had. Think about old casino hotels with dirty, old carpets, prostitution and gambling. That is the setting. They sat us right behind the kitchen. The chop sticks are old and outdated. I'm assuming what they call fine china is what they also play frisbee with, because it's overly chipped. The sterling silverware is rusting. The best part of the meal was the soupy dumplings. The halibut was fried in a disgusting peanut sauce which was not described on the menu. The chicken lo mein was just OK. The server brought three dishes for us to share then he walked away with the dishes, shared them out individually behind a wall. Then brought it back to our table. The fried rice was disgustingly wet. It was horrific. The Bathroom was dirty. They left hand soap on tissue paper. The floors were wet.

5.0,2/14/2018,"Shun Lee Palace is from a bygone era of NYC Chinese food. The dishes are reminiscent of your classics, but this is more upscale. The quality of the ingredients is very distinguishable from your average Chinese restaurant. The crowd runs a bit older and is more well-dressed than your average restaurant. The pricing makes the place a bit more upscale, too. It's a great place to try some authentic NYC Chinese (as opposed to Chinatown Chinese or takeout).

It has pineapple, water chestnuts, peas, and peppers in it. Yum! It comes with a side of white rice which tastes delicious with the sweet and sour sauce.

2.0,1/2/2018,I just spent $200 for lunch including tip and regardless of the price I have to say other than the duck it is nothing special.  We started with $10.00 hot and sour soup which is exactly the same I get for $4.50 on the upper east side.  Then we got the $23.00 fried shrimp balls which were not as good as the $9.00 ones at the same upper east restaurant.  We then had the Ant's on Hill which is minced filet of beef for $32.00 which was worth about $9.00.  Not order it.  Next up was the $56.00 Peking duck which was very good but should be at that price.  Yes it is a prettier restaurant than the typical chinese places but not worth the prices by any stretch of the imagination.  Pass on this place.,0,1,0,Steven S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,10,0

Impeccable service, tasteful decor, perfect lighting, and an extensive menu of traditional Chinese fare made this a very pleasant, albeit expensive, experience. I've never been in a more upscale environment to dine Chinese! The only complaint I have is that the entrees were a little too traditional; a little too 'by the book'. Paying in excess of $15 for 4 fried dumplings (very good!) and $35 for moo shu pork, I guess I would expect something a little more dynamic. Apparently Shun Lee Palace has been around for nearly 40 years; I'm not certain the menu has kept pace.

Both Shun Lee Palace and Shun Lee West are supposedly owned by the same person/co., yet they produce a staggeringly different quality of food.  While Shun Lee West is one of our faves and never disappoints, Shun Lee Palace was a major let down a few years back first time we tried, and was again the other night. We ordered close to $100 worth of food. With the exception of the peking duck roll, it was all awful.  Black bean sauce was corn starch, lobster sauce was watery, wanton flavorless, young chow rice, bland, etc. etc.When you're a $20 take out place, who cares? It's an accident if you find good chinese across the board in nyc. But, when you charge $35/dish, you better bring your A game. And this place simply does not.

Very nice of them, however, when we've had negative experiences w/ one of our fave places in the past, be it Marc Forgione, The Standard Grill, Rosa Mexicano, etc., practically every time the place in question has responded with emphatic apologies and we're almost always invited back for a complimentary meal, because they know how to provide top notch customer service.  So, while a main course is a nice gesture - and way more than a crap ass place like The Park on 10th would ever do - it doesn't nearly cover the almost $100 we threw out the other night. And I highly doubt it would have bankrupted the franchise to offer us a do-over or refund. just my two cents. :)",0,0,0,David F.,"Jersey City, NJ",608,217,11

4.0,4/30/2017,"Full disclosure: I am a devotee of cheap, mom and pop type restaurants but the wife likes the upscale joints.So we go to Shun Lee fully expecting it to be upscale and expensive - no problem with that.I had Hot and Sour soup and Chicken with basil and ginger - very good, very tender chicken. Soup very typical.Wife had the Prawns in Grand Marnier sauce - also very good but with a somewhat cloying aftertaste that I experience from fried/breaded cooking.The problem here is that Chinese restaurants are ubiquitous and generally low priced. Eventually you'll find a good one and become a regular. I suppose there are people who prefer excellent expensive Chinese rather then excellent inexpensive Chinese - so be it.Funniest menu item: They have a ""Old Favorites - Food from the 50's menu."" where you can get Chicken Chow Mein for $32.00 - thats THIRTY TWO DOLLARS!",0,0,0,Roger Y.,"New York, NY",8,63,1

4.0,4/9/2017,"This place was recommended by someone almost a year ago and I am glad they did as the yelp score may have put us off otherwise. This Chinese restaurant is akin to the NY chop house and your local Italian restaurant; wooden windowless decor, old school servers in overalls with little chat, packed full of locals celebrating special occasions. And when I say locals I mean born in NY, rather than us mere residents - we chuckled to ourselves as we overheard the old guard reciting stories from a recent bar mitzvah and raptures of happy birthday broke out on the other side of the restaurant. It is this clientele that enjoy the 'to the point' service that may not sit too well with younger generations - at least that is what I deduce from their absence from these types of restaurants and their surprisingly low reviews. Unlike the chop houses and Italians I have tried, the food here was perfect - well seasoned and beautifully cooked. I had the crispy prawns with XO sauce and I can't complain. My wife had the shredded duck pancakes - a dish that she loves and this was certainly no exception. The price is higher and you certainly aren't paying for warm service or large portions. It's the atmosphere, the romance and the quality is another level - this was by far the best Chinese meal I've had since I moved here. You can't expect this quality for the $15 a dish you pay on seamless. To this point everything was going great - unfortunately there was a 15 min gap in service between us receiving the check and them taking payment - this absence was enough to frustrate me out of giving them 5* in what was otherwise a lovely evening.",0,0,0,James G.,"New York, NY",24,128,182

We ordered 2 glasses of wine, some dumplings, I had soup, Orange Chicken for the main, string beans on the side and brown rice. Everything came out at different times. Dumplings with main course. Wine after soup. Probably did that because they wanted us out of there. Also, they plated everything for us which really annoyed me. It was like they wanted us to eat and leave. When the bill came and it was $113. What was most outrageous is that they charged us $4 for the side of brown rice. You kidding me? They should be shut down, just for that. No Chinese restaurant in NYC should charge for a tiny bowl of rice when you order a $30 main course. They should be ashamed of themselves. I will never ever go back. Oh, and the food - meh. I've had better. Bottom line - there are plenty of outstanding and far cheaper Chinese restaurants in this area. Just find another one.  Any of them will be better than this ripoff.

2.0,11/22/2016,"Very fond memories (of SLP and Shun Lee Cafe on the Westside) compelled me to reserve a pre-Thanksgiving table for my family and my visiting father and his wife. The days of linen-cloth'd tables and fine waiter service at Chinese food restaurants are dwindling in number, and I thought it would be special for my dad (an ex-New Yorker) who was visiting from Florida to experience again. My dad seemed a bit sticker-shocked by the prices on the menu so we all ordered carefully. The food was adequate (diced chicken in lettuce leaves, BBQ pork ribs, ""soupy"" dumplings,  their $52 Beijing Duck and Crispy Prawns in a non-existent XO sauce, which was bland and really could have used the actual XO sauce that we thought we had ordered). When the bill came, it was painful considering the amount of food we consumed and how much they had charged us. Yet, adding insult to injury (and frankly crossing the line of decency) the waiter loudly instructed me to pay heed to the two lines of tips on our bill -- ""we have Captain as well as Waiter"" as he brazenly and rudely interrupted the last few moments we spent together at our table. Now why is their tipping policy suddenly my concern? And why is their over-staffing and payment of their over-staffing my concern (and my table guests' concern)?

1.0,6/17/2016,"I have been coming to this restaurant for over 35 years. It has always held up very well and actually surpassed virtually every Chinese cuisine in New York City, but at a steep price. I always felt the price was worth the quality and was justified because of their dedication to cooking terrific food. Unfortunately, times have changed. I have now been back to this establishment six times within the last six months and each time it has gotten progressively worse and worse. It is resting on its laurels of years gone by and is no longer relevant to the New York City Chinese dining scene. The soup dumplings were gummy. You can get far better soup dumplings down in Chinatown for 1/10th of the price. The Beijing duck looked like it was prepared a week ago and tasted like it had been dead for two years. It was terrible. And at a very steep price. The lobster with ginger, black beans and scallions was so overcooked that it had a mealy consistency. As much as I hate to say it, because this institution has been on my radar for so long, the sun has set and it will not be long for this world. (The reason I gave my experience one star is because the spareribs were actually good. Otherwise, had there been an option, I would have given it zero stars. Zero because of the extremely high prices, poor quality, lack of care in terms of how the food is prepared and an overall vibe that this place is more of a funeral home than an active, vibrant establishment).",0,0,1,Brad R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,66,27

4.0,10/22/2015,"Shun Lee Palace is venerated in the NYC dining sphere for being one of the best and earliest Chinese restaurants in town. It's ""upscale"" which may be a foreign concept as far as Chinese food goes (it sort of is to me) but dining here is memorable. Being a Brooklyn-native, I expect Chinese to be cheap and cheerful, and this is definitely not the former and just a little bit of the latter. Simply put, it's expensive, and I am not saying that in a pejorative way, because caveat emptor of course, but I don't know, I guess I just can't sync with a restaurant that charges $24.50 for chicken with broccoli.This is five-star Chinese cuisine (or at least attempting it) if such a thing exists. My two friends and I stopped in recently for dinner to a relatively empty restaurant teeming with solicitous staff. I mean really, the staff-to-patron ratio may be like 5:1. The menu itself has lots of familiar favorites and we ordered an assortment to try - Standouts included the Peking Duck (of course) which at $50 may make your eyes bug, but it's a lot of duck and all the typical accoutrements (thin pancakes, hoisin sauce and vegetables to go with) so that alone could be an interesting entrée for two or three to share. We also ordered a couple of typical Chinese sautéed dishes but I hate to say none were memorable... I did enjoy the bok choy, though. I loved that my friend's favorite part were... the egg rolls.Being an upscale Chinese restaurant, service and atmosphere are where Shun Lee Palace shines. The wait staff is liveried in ""classic"" Chinese costume which may or may not be a little patronizing, but it works. Their level of service/attentiveness is high bordering on extreme, and the restaurant itself is really beautiful. The décor is elevated in the truest sense and it's a relaxing, but high-end space. I think my favorite part of Shun Lee Palace is that it seems perfectly acceptable to knock back a martini or two here while eating an egg roll, and yes, that's precisely what I did. So like other Midtown stalwarts who mysteriously hang on (I'm looking at you, Le Perigord), perhaps Shun Lee Palace's secret to success is that it's a familiar and comfortable place among the ever-changing NYC restaurant scene.",2,4,3,Justin S.,"New York, NY",862,480,83

1.0,10/5/2015,"We held my mom's 60th birthday dinner here, expecting a celebratory and slightly upscale dinner occasion.  We came for a banquet style dinner for 10.The main waiter, who ""orchestrated"" the other waiters was rude, continued to serve bottled water after I insisted several times to have tap water.  He managed to charge up to $60 in bottled water on my bill.  We also brought a cake which we brought our own plastic cake knife for, and the waiter claimed that there would be a cutting fee.  I said I would cut the cake myself, and he said that to provide an extra set of plates would be at a cost.  We brought it back home with us and celebrated the rest of the evening in my apartment instead. Then, at the end of the night, he gave me a separate bill for 20% additional tip for him only as a ""main waiter"".  This was in addition to the tip we already gave the wait staff.  He explained that it was not mandatory, but that it was expected and that for the ""elevated level of service"", this is a standard gesture most guests give.  I said no thanks and that my generous tip to the wait staff was already inclusive of his services.  He continued to pull me into conversation and away from my party, explaining that it was ""standard"" of most guests.  This was terrible.  I then had no choice but to come out angry on this big occasion and I accused him of sneaking in bottled water in my service,  attempting to charge me extra on things, intrusively pacing back and forth around our table, skimping out on the food, and being rude to my family. I was nice enough to tip the staff who had done a decent job, but he was lucky I didn't make a scene to management that evening.I wish I could have gotten a refund back for the entire evening.  But worst of all, I felt that I let my mom down on her big occasion by bringing her to a place that disappointed.",12,1,2,Angela K.,"San Francisco, CA",4,33,98

There is a positive side: the place is very clean and the ambiance is suitable.   But if you want good Chinese food, try elsewhere.So, we didn't leave a tip other than a note on the payment slip saying we were disappointed.  And here is what happened next (from ""read on"" above):One of the staffers stomped over to my table to demand that I explain why I didn't leave a tip (that has never happened to me in a Mid-town restaurant in more than 40 years, though one could argue that I almost always leave a tip, but that would miss the point since I do write very clear notes on payment slips about the experience):Me: ""For starters, you spilt the wine with no apologies.  Any other Mid-town restaurant would have seen the dregs in the wine and at least commented about that.  We had to beg for the Hoisin sauce for our Peking duck, which normally just comes with it, and then...""He interrupted me about there and said: ""Yes, but sir, what was wrong?""Me: ""What is wrong is that you are trying your best but the fact is that you are amateurs. ""He, voice very loud now: ""Yes, but what is wrong?""By now, half the restaurant were looking at the clueless staffers standing around our table, so we left.  I sincerely wish them the best of luck and perhaps they have cornered a market which will keep them in business: extreme mediocrity at a $$$ price.

4.0,3/9/2015,"We are a family of three with a one year old. First off, the food was good. Came in around 2pm on a Sunday. No offer for a highchair -- odd for a restaurant categorized as family friendly. There were maybe four other parties in the restaurant when we arrived. Ordered soupy dumplings as an appetizer. I've had these (XLB) at many Shanghainese Chinese restaurants in the city and have seen them done a bunch of different ways. The protective outer dough was thicker than the others. And the soupy insides were super hot unlike some of the others. Some restaurants offer these with a variety of different fillings (pork, crab, pork and crab). There was only one option which I'm assuming was pork but it wasn't marked. Usually the crab ones have a yellow dot where the dough comes together which these did not.For entrees we had ants climb a tree and the short ribs.Ants climb a tree is an interesting dish -- glass noodles, shredded beef, some sort of round green vegetable stalk which served as the tree and a savory sauce. It's a good flavor combination. There could have been more in the dish because it comes out  like a casserole. My wife thought it was too salty. I did not. The ribs are pretty straightforward. You can tell they have been cooked for a while because the flavorful meat falls off the bone. It came as 4 larger pieces, no sauce.One of these dishes, I'm assuming the ribs but not sure, came with a side of spinach. I happily ate it.Bill came to about 100 w/o tip. This is where they lost a star not because of the amount but because there is a section for a tip to the captain and for the waiter stamped on the bill.

The ""ant climbing on a tree"" is a long time favorite and despite commanding $26 as a lunch entree, I can't keep myself away from it. I decided to try Shun Lee's Restaurant Week lunch menu. As soon as I entered the restaurant I was shocked by the overwhelming Western decor. In fact, the restaurant looked like a red version of Firebird, the Russian restaurant in Hell's Kitchen that closed. The restaurant had comfy couch booths, fancy silver chopstick rests, and miniature teacups with saucers. The only thing that suggested it was an Chinese restaurant were the seasonal red lanterns and posters put on for Lunar New Year. In terms of the food, I was thoroughly satisfied with the value. One large appetizer, one generous entree and fresh pineapple for dessert (or choice of ice cream). I ordered the dan dan noodle and Szechuan scallop. The dan dan noodle came in a white ceramic bowl with a sigil of a lion on the sides. It was absolutely delicious but could have been spicier. The scallop was covered in sauce. The protein itself was cooked very well and extremely tender but the sauce masked its original flavor and caused the entire dish to feel way too heavy. My entree was served with char siu fried rice. This was a lovely surprise. The rice tasted great but being how the scallop was so sauce heavy, plain white rice would have been more suitable. Each table received a bowl of fried dumpling skins with mustard sauce and duck sauce. At first glance, the skins look too oily, but if you try one, I must warn you, it is hard to stop.

For example, the fried dumplings at our neighborhood Chinese restaurant is $5.95 for  6  dumplings.  At Shun Lee, they are $15.95 for only 4 dumplings.  They were poor.  For one thing, the shell that encased the filling was exceedingly thick - the thickest I've ever seen on a dumpling by a very large margin.  This, of course, means that the filling was exceedingly small.  It was also quite flavorless.  I was expecting a hit of some seasonings such as garlic and ginger, but could not discern any.  I asked for some toasted sesame oil.  Now sesame oil is expensive, but at their prices I think they should supply it.  It would have given those flavorless, pedestrian dumplings a bit of a lift. They did not have it.  Since it was our anniversary, we splurged and both had the lobster Cantonese.

5.0,12/28/2014,"Ah Shun Lee Palace...It is always a treat to come here while in the Big Apple. It is probably the only Chinese place I would go that is filled with non Asians, but I still love. Most of the clienteles are the affluent New Yorkers. One of my friends who frequent this place each time she and her husband go to NYC, even sat next to Tony Bennet and some other famous people. It is not just a Chinese Restaurant as we know it.Shun Lee has a sentimental value to me because of a tradition that my brother in law and his family had on Christmas. They would go to see the Nutcrackers at the Lincoln Center and the next day Shun Lee Palace for dinner. I had experienced it with them especially when his mom was still alive and it was sweet. My sis still makes General Tso's Chicken for one of their Christmas dinners to carry on this Shun Lee tradition even when they can't go here for Christmas.The place is unassuming from outside but it is pretty fancy inside. They have captains and waiters that were all dressed impeccable in suits and ties. The host in front, Patrick, was fantastic. He knows my friends I mentioned above from going there for years, and we had a great chat before we got sat at a nice table. The table is covered with two clothes of blue and white, a nice china set accompanied by the setting of forks, spoon, and chop stick on the most intricate and fancy chop stick rest.The food may not be the most authentic but you don't come here for it. It is just a different level and type of Chinese food, made well and tasted great but they're old fashioned and what the Americans would love, with some infusion of specialty dishes here and there.We stuck with mainstream dishes of Orange Beef, Egg Foo Yung, Yung Chow Fried Rice, Tofu with Mushroom, and Sweet and Sour Pork. All were delicious and we ate it all. I came with my friend and her family last night and they loved the place. The kids ate so much food and they were really pleased to see the kids enjoying the food.The service was more than attentive and it was definitely high end Chinese. The pricing in the menu would shock you as they're not cheap and usually are double digit starting with 3 or 4 as the first digit. However, there are some starting with 1 here and there. Our check was high but not bad. We loved the food and everything else. For a once in while patron like me, I am a satisfied customer.

The food was sub par. It tasted dry and like it had been sitting out. DO NOT get the crispy beef. I could only tolerate it with rice as it was too salty and dry. For dessert I had almond tofu and lychee nuts. I wish I'd gotten the ice cream instead. The desserts were standard. The service was beautiful. Multiple people catered to us. One star for service. There were only three other tables at 9 pm on a Wednesday night.

I don't think she was singling us out, because she seem to treat everyone in a condescending manner. My wife liked her steamed prawns. She also thought the wonton soup was very good. I had jellyfish on a whim, having never tried it before and it tasted exactly like you would think. Flavor was not bad but the texture was definitely not my cup of tea. Of course, that's not their fault and I don't hold that against them since I was being adventurous. However I was very disappointed in the orange pressed duck. The orange sauce had little flavor, and a gloppy texture. The duck was only slightly warm, and had a congealed and chalky texture which was very off-putting.

He then proceeded to approach another member of the table to try and push him on ordering wine.- When we had turned down the offer of wine, he was incessant on finding another way to charge us for beverages. He snuck in numerous bottles of Panna water, never asking us if we wanted tap or bottle.  This incurred an additional charge on our bill unbeknownst to us.- The staff is poorly trained on dinner service etiquette. As I attempted to pour hot tea for others, one waiter interrupted by reaching in and pouring water instead. He reached over me in order to pour into my neighbor's glass. All the while, I had to wait  for him to finish before pouring tea for others. It was very intrusive.- The staff tried to ""clean"" the plates on the table by scraping the last morsels to people's plates even though we had refused.- The courses of the meal did not come out in an uneven manner. Some dishes would be served too quickly after the previous course while others had us waiting at least 15 minutes. - While my mother was opening gifts and displaying it to everyone, the ""captain"" reached over her to clear plates, utensils, etc. She had to stop unwrapping to accommodate him. It was extremely rude and distracting. - At the end of the night when I paid for the check, the ""captain"" was sure to point out a line on the receipt for his tip.  He proceeded to stand over me as I was contemplating what he deserved for the night.  He had no shame to stand and just watch.  BTW, for the banquet dinner, 20% service charge is already included.  There was no indication that we would need to pay an additional tip.  In fact, this ""captain"" actually took away from the evening.  I had no remorse in giving him $0.

I asked for the hot sauce to stay but the waiter took it away claiming no space. Yeah- thanks.Give me a break, and NO HIGH CHAIR even though it was clear that there would be 2 young children? I asked the waiter for plain steamed noodles for the baby and the answer was no. I had to ask another waiter. Never mind that a waiter tried to literally cram a stroller into a corner that came about 1"" from my child's face.When I asked what part of the animal sweetbreads came from, I got a look from the waiter like I had 2 heads and his answer was ""beef"". Gee thanks, look if you don't want to be in the service industry, don't take it out on your customers.Tea was never hot and when the food came, it was called out as if auctioning the food, if we're paying $60 for Peking duck, please try and remember what we ordered, for the love of god. The occasion was for someone's 90th birthday and clearly the restaurant took advantage of older people who might need a little more service. Oh yeah- try and give everyone menus before you take the order, bc parents with babies still count. You messed with the wrong clientele, figure out who paid for the dinner and know that he could buy you and the entire building you're in.",0,5,0,Lucy R.,"Manhattan, NY",11,2,2
3.0,5/12/2012,"The food at Shun Lee was pretty good, but the amount of $$$ detracted from the flavors on my palate. $30 for ""half a duck.""  They must have meant to say ""half a miniature duck.""  The sea bass fillets were  tasty, but oye $28 dollars?  The egg plant for $16.50 was tasty, but the only difference between that dish and dishes I've had elsewhere was the price. They are stingy with the rice too or whoever was dishing it out inadvertently was using the teacups. I kinda doubt it. It's actually quite sneaky. Depriving our bellies of rice and tempting us to order some more $$$ entrees.  Well Mr. Shun Lee you got us. We fell for your ""miniature duck trick"" and ""ole rice in a teacup,"" but alas, never again.  Your food may be tasty, but in a city like NYC I can think of about 20 other options that are much easier on the wallet and just as delicious.I'm giving 3 stars even though ""A-OK"" is not how I would summarize my experience.  The food is good, but I think hungry and unsatisfied would be my overall summary.  If you have money to bleed and don't mind overpaying for food, then Shun Lee is not a bad option.  Then again, its not a good option either.  I will say that the ambiance is nice.  It's a very intimate restaurant and modern while still maintaining the feel of a traditional Chinese restaurant.  The dragon on the wall was also pretty cool.  Service was efficient.",0,0,0,Lizi C.,"Colorado Springs, CO",33,492,83

I had a Noon reservation and they certainly didn't cook the duck for me; it was left from yesterday, but they didn't bother to heat it up, so the duck was cold. They make up the pancake sandwiches for you without asking, and it was supposed to be a half duck but it didn't include the whole half. They were good, but I'd have liked to make them myself and of course I wanted the duck to be hot, not cold. Service was fine and the apple pie was as good as ever. I hadn't been there for some years and I'm not sure if I'll go back. When the waitress came to ask how I liked the duck and I said it was cold she said maybe from carving.

4.0,2/7/2011,"This place is pretty great. I guess I'm just used to the greasy, disgustingly filthy, employees-who-actively-wish-for-your-death Chinatown version of Chinese restaurants, so if nothing else it's a novelty to eat in one that's on the fancier, pricey side, like watching a bear walk on its hind legs and grunt the national anthem. Some of the food here is pretty amazing--the braised pork, which is chunks of super-tender, juicy pig complete with delicious marbly layers of fat and skin on top, is a standout, and they cook up a mean sea bass. But mostly I like this place because in typical Chinese inability to understand anything that isn't scolding and/or dice-gambling while squatting, the conception of ""fancy"" here pretty much ends at having all the waiters wear awesome electric-blue admiral coats, which gives me hope that they could bust out into hilariously offensive pidgin-Engrish versions of popular showtunes at any moment.",3,2,1,Galvin C.,"Brooklyn, NY",81,207,1

I was expecting a quick run to a happy hour spot, the usual for under worked overpaid semi-functioning alcoholics. I was surprised when I was told to meet up at this Chinese restaurant. After being assured that they had a full bar, I surrendered my resistance.The 'full bar' was small. Four bar stools small. They had my bourbon, so I didn't mind. Sitting is over rated. After a quick drink our group got a table. Most of the wait staff were wearing these over worn 'mess jackets', complete with shoulder knots, a funny sight. A nautical Chinese restaurant? After a few drinks, I thought I was on some strange Love Boat episode. The menu is large. Just about anything you could want they have. The prawns and Beijing Duck were great. If you like fish (like i do), this place has an excellent sea bass. Something I have never had before, actually never heard of either, was 'Ants Climb on Tree', a stir fried beef dish. It was too tasty to describe. And all of the sauces were tangy and fresh, simply amazing. If you need a Chinese spot in midtown this is a great option. The dinning room is large and good for larger groups. The only real drawback was that I though it was on the expensive side. I lived in Queens for 5+ years and have eaten in Chinatown many times, so I've got a good idea what shrimp fried rice should cost. Shun Lee is about 50%-100%+ more than what i would call 'usual'.

Their dimsum is decent, but not as delicious as the OG restaurants of Chinatown.  But it is acceptable for a Chinese restaurant on 50th street.  Same goes for Peking Duck. I love Peking Duck, but something was quite not there. Can't explain it. Nothing to complain about though.  Soup dumplings- I recommend Joe's Shanghai. Shun Lee's was the smallest soup dumplings I've seen to date. Because of its petite size, it lacks much soup, and it just doesn't have that right flavor. The waiter even told us that we might as well just order something else bc it's not good. Should've changed the order then but I craved soup dumplings.  This restaurant is pricey. They have tried to westernize the restaurant by making it more upscale unlike most familly-style Chinese restaurants.  Also, the seperate space open for Sunday lunch had an interior that seemed more like a French restaurant.  So it is a sad case that the waiters are still a bit rude like the ones you'd experience in Chinatown. Seriously, what is up with that? Thought we were also paying for the service.  A friend said the non-chinese seek the ""local"" experience that they would experience in China.

Not the best I've had in my life, but it was juicy, crispy, and had a good flavor.  The Chicken Chow fun was okay, but not worth the price we paid for it.  Really, everything here is too expensive, and maybe it was because we came in at a weird time (3:30 on a Saturday), but this place didn't seem as high-class as it makes itself out to be.  At the same time though, some dbag seated two tables down from us wouldn't stop complaining (and name dropping like it was no one's business, even though there was no one around to hear), and I thought his complaints were completely ridiculous.So, in the end, I don't know how I feel about this place.  It has good, quality food, but it really is just too expensive for what you get.  Or, at least, for what I got.",0,0,0,Stephanie J.,"Brooklyn, NY",26,93,0
