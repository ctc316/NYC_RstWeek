5.0,5/6/2018,This was one of the best restaurants in NYC. The service was perfect. There was always wine in our glasses(no need to call the waiter) . The steaks were really amazing. I have got the American wagy and it was of a top quality and taste. For desert we had the cheese cake to share(because the steaks were pretty huge) and it was a must to try. I will recommend this place 100%. Even I am now considering for having a breakfast there :),1,0,0,Petya K.,"South Village, Manhattan, NY",0,2,40
2.0,5/6/2018,A place like the Four Seasons downtown deserves a much better place than Cut.Service is so so but the quality of the food and overall experience is really not up to the billing.Sincerely hope that market conditions such as lack of customers will eventually force the closing of this overly priced so so steakhouse.

4.0,2/14/2018,There's nothing really wrong with Cut.  It's just the Wolfgang hype (bla bla bla) is not met by the experience.  By the price and snobbery you'd think your tastebuds were going to explode with happiness ... or something.

1.0,2/4/2018,"Honestly a terrible dining experience.  Not what you would expect from a Wolfgang Puck restaurant.  The service was a straight 0.  We sat for 15 min with not a person coming to even say hello, before having to call someone over to order a drink.  The appetizers were underwhelming, the lobster app the server recommended was inedible.  The steak was rather good as were the sides, so that was a positive.  Overall I would never return to this restaurant.  This meal that was one of the worst I have ever experienced in my life.  The GM needs to be fired immediately and this place turned around.  Stay away.  So many better places to enjoy dinner.",0,0,0,Shah T.,"Manhattan, NY",261,15,0
5.0,1/21/2018,"Came here last night for the third time with high expectations and it din't disappoint - still highly recommend. First we got cocktails. I got the first vodka one; the name had love in it. He got a whiskey one. Both had lemon in them as a garnish and were good (note the cocktails do take a little time to come out, so you should order them right away).  To start for food we ordered the scallops and the tortelloni - both were served with black truffles & mmm were good. They bring you a generous variety of bread (including sliced bread, pretzel rolls, focaccia & cracker things) & some butter, so note to self for next time - maybe only 1 app is necessary.   We used the extra tortelloni sauce on some of the bread, which was also delicious. For mains we did our usual of petit filet mignon and the trio sirloin tasting, which were of course the stars of the meal. There's something they do to the meat to get a great outer crust/char/something delicious but still keep the inside medium rare. For sides we got the mashed potatoes & brussel sprouts, but brought some of the brussel sprouts home in a doggy bag, since we had to leave room for dessert. For dessert we had the baked alaska - a difference vs. the past was they they flambe'd/torched it table-side! A nice little excitement. Oh and whatever red wine we originally ordered, they were out of, so they brought us something else similar & charged us the lower price - yay. All in all a delicious meal & can't wait for next time.",0,0,0,Caitlin B.,"New York, NY",3,280,35
4.0,1/14/2018,"We ate here for Christmas Eve Dinner, so they had a Prix Fix menu for $135 that included a chef item, an appetizer, your choice of entree, four - count 'em - four sides and dessert.  Our waiter recommended the veal chop with the bone in, so I went for that.  Haven't had veal for awhile, but this was excellent and a lot of food.  The four sides were too much for two people and with the exception of the Mac and Cheese, most were not to our liking.  Dessert was good and just the right size after the large meal.  Surprised at how good the service was here on a busy night.  I saw some complaints about the decor, but we liked it.  They even let us choose a great table, so I'd put it on a list to repeat and try the regular menu, but happy they were open and the steaks and veal we had exceeded our expectations.  Now maybe bring the price down a bit and let people choose less sides, that would have made for a perfect night.",0,0,0,Steve A.,"Concord, CA",62,213,0
3.0,1/2/2018,"We went here for our anniversary dinner.  Usually we would not have chosen a steakhouse, but my wife is on a low-carb diet right now so meat was paramount.  It is also very close to our place, a huge plus in the bitter NY cold, so off we went!We started at the bar waiting for the kitchen to open (early seating).  It was a great space and my cocktail was seriously stellar (""Rolling Fog"").  They seated us promptly, transferred our drinks, and served two rounds of breads.  These were good, but obviously I wasn't there for the bread.  As an appetizer my wife ordered a bone-marrow and dumpling soup, I had scallop with black-truffle carpaccio.  These were fantastic, though my carpaccio was perhaps slightly too acidic; also the black-truffle came as giant flakes which were visibly impressive but made it hard to eat the dish.  For mains I got the NY Sirloin taster, this included A5 Miyazaki Wagyu, my wife got corn-fed fillet.  We also got sides of mushrooms and the cauliflower carbonara (low-carb again).  The sides were mixed; the mushrooms were nicely spicy as they came paired with (what I think was) shishito peppers, I really enjoyed it.  The carbonara was cooked well, but the dish itself needed a bit more salt.  Actually, I think this was a theme as my wife actually added salt to her steak despite it being cooked perfectly.  I should have done the same as my steak was in dire need of salt as well, but I didn't do so.  The sampler was three cuts of beef (American Wagyu, American Prime Dry-Aged, and the Japanese Wagyu).  The American Wagyu was sadly overcooked, I ordered rare and got somewhere between medium-rare and medium (ugh).  The other two pieces were cooked perfectly.  The Japanese Wagyu was clearly the highlight, but the American Prime was great too.  The overcooked American Wagyu was honestly not great.  For dessert we had the chocolate souffle.  We asked how long it would take and were told ""10 minutes"".  I was scared by this, but the waiter assured us that they ""had a trick"".  This trick turned out to be scalding the souffle at some incredibly high temperature.  The result was a perfectly cooked souffle in the center with slightly overdone edges.   Honestly it wasn't too bad, but it was nothing special.  Overall I think CUT is an uneven experience where a little more polish on the dishes will make people not regret the high price.  For me I doubt I'll be returning in the short term. Decour: Incredible.  This a beautiful spacious restaurant.  I even noticed the ambient temperature was perfect, I almost felt like I was in a sensory deprivation tank. Service: Very good.  The only complaint is that service itself was slow.  Our dinner was 2.5 hours for 3 courses.  Servers were fine, I think it's a slow kitchen.   Food: Only OK for the price.  They're almost there, but I think the dishes need a bit more polish for the value. Final Bill: 2 appetizers, 2 mains (including my extravagant $140 sampler), 2 drinks, 1 dessert ran us ~$420 after tip.  Not a cheap night out.",0,0,0,Alex R.,"Jersey City, NJ",2,50,0

Dinner is serious eating- steak house with excellent salad, spinach, potatoes, mushrooms, and anything else you order. Sauces superb 4.

4.0,12/5/2017,"Usually I'm not so much a fan of Wolfgang Puck. It seems through the year, he had sold himself short by labeling his name on any products or restaurants that's willing to give him a cut (no pun intended) for the use of his name. I was proven wrong when I came here last night for dinner and was immediately taken back by how beautiful and sleek this restaurant is. I absolutely loved the high ceiling and the testosterone infused decor that help set a strong tone to the establishment. As for the bar area, it had a cool 80's inspired designed with radiant neon lights that complimented the restaurant instead of disgracing it. We sat in the oval room and the gold accent really made everything felt fancy. To really try as many dishes as possible, my friend and I share dishes and everything was on point. I enjoyed their buttered lettuce salad. It was airy with a hint of gorgonzola cheese to tide in the sweetness and sourness of the dressing. Their pumpkin tortellini was also very delicious. The temperature inside the filling was still pipping hot (how I like it) while the texture and flavor was creamy and light.As for their entree, we shared a 35 days aged sirloin and a 28 days aged filet mignon. Both steak were fired medium and the meat itself was nice and tender. As for their dessert, I wasn't too crazy about it. It was a Baked Alaska (chocolate covered torch marshmallow ice cream) and nothing about it seems interesting, where it almost reminded me of the classic cake from Carvel. Overall, I've been to enough steakhouses in my life to say this is one steakhouse that I would recommend, esp because of it's location and decor.",6,5,5,Nga C.,"Brooklyn, NY",524,480,2034

5.0,11/16/2017,Really confused by the negative reviews for this place. It doesn't make any sense. It is in the four seasons with great architecture and great location. I am curious why this one is designed differently than their locations in Vegas and LA but that's neither here nor there. I have been to both and huge fan of them.

5.0,10/20/2017,"This restaurant made the CUT on my list as being one of the best restaurants I have ever been to in my life.I truly do not understand the negative reviews on here. The hospitality is second to none, and the decor of the restaurant is amazing. Got a last minute dinner reservation and it was during New York fashion week, so I truly thought restaurants would be packed, but surprisingly this one was steady, but not packed (granted it was only 7pm, and it did get busier by the time we left around 9pm). It was really close for us from our hotel, so location was key when choosing plus we have never been to a NYC restaurant before. We chose this one because I am a huge fan of Wolfgang Puck, and read a lot about him during my culinary school days. They seated us right away, and before we knew it, our water glasses were poured, and our beverage server was already getting our drink orders ready. The drinks were massive, even though they were a bit pricey, they were huge, and really pretty. They were also very delicious, the drink was kind of like a Mai-Tai meets a Bahama mama..We ordered three appetizers, two salads and one hot app, which were all amazing and all seasonal, which is great that they are going towards the farm to table movement.We then received our first bread basket, and then ordered our meal. Yes, I mean first because they come around with a warm fresh bread basket, and the server hand selects the bread for you (goes over the bread in detail). I got the foccaia bread and the pretzel roll, and they both were fabulous. My aunt and cousin loved that their was a server that physically went around showing the real cuts of meat off, and explaining each one. They got the most expensive cuts of meat of course, the wagu which is ridiculously expensive. I got the fish (flounder) because even though its a steakhouse, I dont eat steak. (go figure). However I seriously loved my fish, and the main server did a presentation with it, cutting and filleting my fish on the spot. We also got creamed spinach as a side along with french fries and onion rings, and it was really good. We couldnt even finish the onion rings and french fries we were so filled. The wagu beef they had was the best cut of steak they have ever had, and they go to a lot of steakhouses when they travel. The sauces that you can add on as an addition were really good they said, they got the Gorgonzola cream sauce and the steak sauce.  We were so full we couldn't even dare to look at dessert, but we enjoyed the experience, and it was truly a dining experience. I dont know if we will ever go back (it is super expensive so just be prepared), but it was defiantly something I could cross off the bucket list. It made the ""CUT"".",3,1,0,Ana W.,"Hatboro, PA",75,41,16
4.0,10/1/2017,"I've been to CUT in LA many times and love it, so I was very happy when it opened in NYC about a year ago. I went a few times in the first few months, but stopped as the service was inconsistent and generally not great. It seems that the team completely changed over in the course of the first few months. One time our waiter was overly formal and also questioned our order of a truffle pasta as if he was concerned we couldn't afford it....another time, we had a waitress who was friendly but  extremely casual and seemed more cut out to work at a diner than a high end restaurant. The food has always been 5 stars in my opinion. But when you are at this price point, there are many great options food-wise, and you expect service and atmosphere to match, which it didn't here.We decided to try CUT again last night, and I think the service has improved a bit but still is not at the right level. There were a number of things to nitpick, but the one that actually impacted the experience was water glasses were left empty for a long time. The restaurant felt a bit understaffed despite being half full on a Saturday night, but the easiest way to fix this issue may honestly be bigger glasses, because they are so small! The food was once again incredible. They have a vegetable soup for the fall and the broth was delicious. The suckling pig / pork belly appetizer which comes with steamed buns is perfectly cooked, beautifully plated, and a generous portion relative to price (could totally split this one app). The lobster which is cut up table side and served with melted butter and truffle sabayon is one of my favorites. The mac and cheese remains the best I've ever had. The chocolate soufflé the same - it is consistently incredible.The remarkable thing about CUT is its a steakhouse where you can have an excellent meal without actually ordering steak. The appetizers and seafood options are so good I frequently don't get a steak. The steaks are great, but its the versatility of the kitchen that differentiates CUT from most steakhouses. And thats why, despite NYC having so many good steakhouses already, it needs this one. It is sad that a restaurant with incredible food is half empty on a Saturday at 9 PM. However, I can't blame people as the service just isn't at the level of most restaurants at this price point. It did seem to improve a bit this time around (they had a team member who came over from CUT in Dubai and he seemed great, so they are trying). We'll be back for the food regardless, but hopefully this becomes the complete experience that the LA location is!",2,0,0,Robert M.,"Philadelphia, PA",9,17,0

For appetizer we ordered the Suckling Pig & Crispy Belly, it came with steam buns and the tasty pork melts in your mouth. Instead of wagyu beef, this time my husband had the bone in ribeye and I ordered the 35 days dry-aged ribeye with a side of roasted bone marrow. Both steaks were perfectly cooked in our liking. However, can't say the same on our dessert Black Forest cake.

3.0,8/18/2017,"This review is based on my experience with their restaurant week menu. For appetizer, I got the corn tortelloni. I am a fan as I liked corn. As I cut the tortellonis, the filling often exploded which was satisfying to watch. The sauce was buttery and I really cleaned the plate. Unfortunately, the portion was rather small. I counted only five tortellonis. Given that it is a steakhouse from the notable Wolfgang Puck, I expected that they won't mess up my sirloin order. In fact, they screwed up all 5 orders. My medium rare looked like medium while my friend's medium looked rarer than mine. I had to exchange with her. My other friend's medium well looked like medium. My meat was not juicy and bland. The sauces (chimichurri and purree) helped to compensate for its blandness as they were seasoned well. All five of us were disappointed with the meat. Even I can cook better than that.Luckily the dessert was a saver. I chose morello cherry & black plumb 'crumble' which I enjoyed, particularly on the ice cream.

I ordered the skate. It was rancid. The server never checked on us to see if we liked our food (besides me, everyone at the table was really happy).  And they cleared my plate (completely untouched), and never asked if everything was okay.  It was clearly my fault for not calling over our server to complain, but the chef should have known that he was serving inedible dish (the smell).  So have a steak.  Stay away from the fish...and you will be fine.",0,0,0,Julia K.,"Santa Monica, CA",59,223,8

2.0,7/24/2017,"Mixed feelings about the place.Came here for restaurant week as they were offering a 3 course lunch prix fixe for $29, which seemed too good to be true for the CUT. Was it? Yes, definitely too good to be true. It was overall still a good deal and may be a good pick for Restaurant Week if you've always wanted to try this place, but it was definitely not a representative meal of what the CUT can do.Firstly, they refused to serve us bread because we were RW diners. Um, WTF? I found this to be totally ridiculous. Bread isn't that expensive, and way to reinforce that RW diners are essentially second class citizens. I still maintain the whole point of RW is to draw in people who may not be interested in committing to a $180 steak to sample the restaurant and then entice them into coming back. Definitely do not want to return to a place that wouldn't give me bread!Onto the food I DID receive. For appetizers, I got the white corn tortelloni and my friend tried the tomato salad. Portions were small throughout the meal, which I was fine with. The appetizers were very fresh and tasty, particularly the tortelloni. I only wish there were more than 5 tortellonis! For dessert we both got the plum crumble with ice cream which I also liked - sweet and tart. Sadly, the steak here did NOT shine. The RW menu comes with a small piece of the American cap steak (the only option if you want beef) and it was just pretty poor quality meat. I suppose the piece itself was well cooked, but the quality was just way too sub par. This is a shame particularly when there are numerous steakhouses that participate in NYC restaurant week that will give you a good portion of their normal fare at a discount. In sum, a good deal for $29 considering how pricey their food is normally, but you really get a sh*tty version of their steak, and they'll refuse to serve you complimentary bread.

1.0,5/24/2017,"Went to Cut with clients. Rushed from the bar to our table as the drinks took forever. And I HATE when they measure out those measly pours. Its a steak house,  men like nice decent drinks! Pouring in 1/4"" of scotch in a glass with a huge ice cube is embarrassing. Just for that reason alone would not come back with clients, and we work nearby and could spend tens of thousands of dollars on meals in a year.  Get the bar's act together. Being frugal is no way to earn customers.   It seems like all these people want to do is run up the tab by recommending the MOST expensive things on the menu like the Kobe beef (sold by the ounce) or the 'meat variety plate' also super expensive like $110 pp.  For ordering a $65 pc of meat were felt we were looked down upon!Wine Steward came over, saw we were looking at the wine list and  of course said ""Oh, this is one of our most popular wines (at $325/bottle why not, they didn't even ask what our price range was). Hard selling going on and we didn't appreciate it, and yes, I can afford more, but don't like when its pushy. I'll spend my money where I want to not where you try to pry it out of me. Lastly the winner of the night was that one of our guests went to the single restroom in the hotel lobby for this large restaurant (the other one was closed off). He reported to management that there were no paper towels to dry hands. I went about 15 minutes later and not only no paper towels but no TP! When I told them about this the hostess said ""We asked the people at the Four Seasons, its not our problem"". Wrong answer!, At a restaurant where the tab runs easily $250 per person with inexpensive wine, you get off your ass and get paper goods from wherever even if you run out to 7-11 across the street.

Total disappointment from traveling all the way from queens luckily another steakhouse was open and my night was saved. Ended staying for a drink which was super watered down and over priced.

3.0,5/21/2017,"I would like to start off saying that the hours of operation are pretty misleading. It says open until 2 am, so on a special occasion I decided to drive to the city for dinner; only to arrive and find out that the restaurant portion was closed much earlier but the bar was still open. I strongly feel that they should differentiate dining hours from bar hours. Nevertheless because I was already there decided to have a cocktail. My choice was the garden of Eden, it was very light and I could barely taste any alcohol. Two cocktails cost 40 bucks was too me is bit overpriced even for Manhattan. I can not speak to the food because I was not offered a bar menu for snacks as the kitchen was closed.

We had a great meal. Lovely service and fantastic steaks/sides. We tried a variety and everything was excellent. Wine list was good and cocktails were delicious. It is expensive, but not out of line with other steak houses and I actually liked the formality of the service.We live in the neighborhood and walking by the decor looks kind of cheesy, but once inside I can see how it works - it has a bit of an LA feel, which suits a Wolfgang Puck restaurant.All in all I was pleasantly surprised and will definitely be back.",0,0,0,Alex H.,"New York, NY",0,16,0

I was expecting them to comp our bill or anything but an apology would've been nice. This is the second time dining at this restaurant and we would probably not go back.

We are locals, from TriBeCa, just six blocks up.  My husband and I took my mother and our 12 year old daughter.  Service was a 3 but food really a 1.  We asked somalier for a full bodied red for under $100.  She recommended, and we bought, a mediocre not full bodied red for $95. Not a good choice.  First two of us ordered the crispy softshell crab-- tasted like fried nothing-- way overbattered and under seasoned.  Our daughter had tuna tartare which was good and my husband had steak tartare which was mediocre.  We ordered porterhouse steak for two and lobster.  Both were priceless (""market price""). Both delivered cold. The lobster was okay but the steak was awful and full of grizzle. Who delivers porterhouse steak at room temperature?  It should have been sizzling. Very disappointing!  The price for porterhouse for 2-- $140!  Brussel sprouts and cream spinach pretty good. Wolfgang Puck, you should be ashamed of yourself. Devalued brand.

4.0,4/5/2017,"I came here on a Friday night for an impromptu dinner with my brother.  Fortunately we seemed to have a better experience than others have reported on Yelp. We enjoyed our food although the service was a bit lacking.- Ambiance : The decor is interesting and not typical of a steak house, which was a nice change.  The chairs are comfortable and they played really great music and an appropriate level (think classic rock). - Service : they took our coats/umbrellas upon arrival. When being seated, the hostess brought us back to the entry so they could ""clear the additional 2 place settings"" that we didn't need. They could have done this while we sat down.  The meal lacked a ""personal experience"" that I'm used to, none of the staff were really personable and just seemed to be there to do their job.  I'm honestly not sure who our waiter was as no one introduced them self claiming this role.  One person took our drink order, another arrived holding a tray of various cuts of meat and also took our order.  The same person who took our drink order returned to take our dessert order and checked in on us after we received our food.  The bus boy refilled our water and someone brought us bread/butter, but several times throughout the meal we had to flag down an employee.  We were there for 3 hours before we caught someones attention to request the bill- Food : After we ordered we were brought these dreamy little cheesy-puff knots, I could have eaten an entire basket of them.  Another employee came around with a tray of assorted breads, I'd recommend the pretzel knot.  Both of us really enjoyed our steaks, they were cooked to the correct temperature (medium rare, is there really any other way?).  We both had filets, one bone in, one grass-fed at $58 each.  Each steak includes 1 sauce at no cost, I don't really understand the need for a sauce if the meat is good, but we selected the red wine and Bearnaise sauce.  They were nice, but we both prefer our steaks plain.  For sides we ordered the mac & cheese and yukon whipped potatoes.  Both were very delicious, but the portions could have been a little more generous for the $16/$12 price tags.  The dessert options were a little too sophisticated for our taste, but we ordered the chocolate soufflé which was quite decadent. Somewhere toward the end of our meal we were presented with 2 complimentary truffles.  Had I known this I might have skipped the $14 soufflé.",1,1,1,Stacey T.,"New York, NY",158,146,156

3.0,3/19/2017,Sadly not a good experience.  FS Downtown is a beautiful hotel and the restaurant itself has a very nice bar and ambiance.  We were with friends and sat for drinks at the bar.  Each round of drinks (with the place very quite) took in excess of 15 minutes to get.  Our reservation was late and then once sat down we literally waited 45 mixtures to order.  Not an exaggeration.  Food is ok but very overpriced.  You can tell they got staff thinking this is a regular meat packing district restaurant.  At these prices you need a pro staff and everything need to be on point.  Dinner took literally three hours.  Just from a shear table turnover aspect they are not going to be able to make it.  We will not be returning.  As far as the food it was ok to good but certainly not on par with most any other NYC steakhouse.  Also at this price point have some comfortable chairs at least.  I will also say staff was very nice and pleasant if that counts for anything given the overall experience.,1,0,0,Michael T.,"Long Island City, New York, NY",22,89,6
2.0,3/11/2017,"As much as I love Wolfgang, I can't bring myself to recommend Cut. I realize they have only been open for 6 months, but the service experience there was one of the worst I've ever had anywhere in the world, including France... Our waiter (Pete) was a self-proclaimed professional with 30 years of fine dinning experience. Apparently, he never learned basic manners or polite etiquette during that time. He was smug, inattentive, and dismissive of our questions. When one of us felt their drink tasted a off, we inquired as to whether it was the correct liquor. His response was smug and stern. He made zero attempt to make the customer feel appreciated by offering a solution. The food was pretty good but not amazing. I've had much better steaks at many different places. In addition to our struggles with Pete, the overall service was painfully slow and we had to flag down a staff member for every single request. I think we would still be sitting there if he didn't aggressively ask for the meal to move along at every step.

4.0,1/14/2017,"Cut overall score: 80Wolfgang Puck just opened up a new location of his steakhouse ""Cut"" in downtown Manhattan. Of course I had to check it out. A buddy and I came here with our ladies to get down on some steak.Flavor: 8We were able to sample three different cuts: rib eye, sirloin and tenderloin. All three hailed from Creekstone Farms, and all three were bone-in.The rib eye here is a solid 8/10. It felt a bit small for 20oz, but as you can see it had a great outer crust.Inside was perfectly cooked. Check out the cut:Where it fell short, for me, was the cap. There wasn't much to it, unfortunately. The eye was delicious though, and I think it was the most flavorful cut of the night. I didn't get pics of the other two.I'm giving the tenderloin a 9/10. It had that same great sear and same great cook temp. The flavor was excellent for a tenderloin, too.The sirloin was not marketed as a NY strip or strip loin, so I am considering it to be an ""other cut"" for categorization purposes. In all likelihood, it was probably a strip, but one can never be certain without actually doing the butchering oneself. This was an 8/10. Again, same great crisp and cook, and the flavor was nice for a lean cut, though I did prefer the rib eye and tenderloin over the sirloin.As for the sauces, well, each steak comes with a free sauce on the side. There are about six to eight to choose from. We tried a bunch: house steak sauce, bernaise, creamy horseradish, and yuzu. While I prefer my steak naked, the best of the lot was the horseradish. Their house steak sauce was a bit aggressive on the tarragon (I think that's what it was in there - not rosemary).Choice of Cuts & Quality Available: 10This place is truly amazing in terms of available cuts and quality. A quick scan of their menu reveals that they not only offer all of the main steakhouse cuts in various sizes, but you can also choose by farm. They offer stuff from Kansas (Creekstone), Illinois (corn-finished), Ithaca New York (grass-finished), and Snake River (American Wagyu). On top of that, they feature legit Miyazaki beef from Japan as well. You can even order a tasting that will give you 4oz from various farms, that way you can actually taste the difference between them. Currently, they only do this with the sirloin - not the rib eye. Honestly I don't think any other steakhouse has this extensive of a selection.As if the cuts of beef for steaks aren't enough variety, they also feature wagyu beef short rib and wagyu beef sashimi. Amazing.Oh, and they bring the shit out to show you, too.Portion Size & Plating: 7Portions could be a bit larger here for the pricing. I understand the cost of high-end beef, but at $88 for 9oz of American wagyu rib eye, you are getting ripped off. If that's what I am going for, I will happily just head the fuck over to Del Frisco's to get 23oz more wagyu beef for an additional $7 (32oz, $95). And that fucker is a clear 10/10 score on flavor - one of the best steaks I've ever eaten.Price: 5See my rant on portion size above for some weight here as well. But in addition to that issue, I felt that some of the items were way overpriced for what we were getting. In particular, the marrow app, the tortolloni, and the mac and cheese.Bar: 8The bar is pretty cool, and there are some great cocktails and booze selections available. However the prices are a bit too high (a non-alcoholic ""mocktail"" was fucking $14), and I was hoping for a more street side experience. The bar is just off the lobby of the apartment building / hotel with no view of the downtown streets, so the vibe is slightly off a bit.Specials and Other Meats: 9There are no off-menu specials, with the exception of an addition that was not yet printed - another offering of steak. But there's chicken, pork and lamb for alternative meat selections, if for some reason you are avoiding all the tasty beef on the menu. The app selections also feature veal tongue, suckling pig, and bone marrow flan. Really interesting.Apps, Sides & Desserts: 9We tried a bunch of stuff. Let's get right down to business.The mac and cheese was really tasty, but insanely overpriced at $16. Apologies for not getting a photo of it.The suckling pig and pork belly was excellent. Not as salty as I was expecting, but really nicely plated. Also overpriced at $25 for six cubes that were the size of large Las Vegas gambling dice.Bone marrow flan was very nice, but overpriced and small in size. It was similar to the creme brûlée from Beatrice Inn, only savory.Broccolini was fantastic. I highly recommend this item. Topped with shaved cheese and adorned with roasted tomatoes, one cannot possibly go wrong.Tortolloni was overpriced for seven small dumplings. They were nice and mild though, which is exactly what my wife wanted.Doughnuts dessert came with about six doughnut holes, all the same flavor (granulated sugar coated)....REVIEW CUT FOR LENGTH- go to my site for the rest if you give a fuck",5,4,3,JohnnyPrimeC.

4.0,12/5/2016,"First, it's expensive. It's in the Four Seasons, so it's kind of expected, but you can certainly get basically the same meal cheaper all over NYC. Drinks seem to run ~$18, which, even in NY is *basically* price gouging. Especially, because as noted in Eater's review, they range from okay to cloyingly sweet. It's really annoying because those poor bartenders are trying hard but whichever mixologist came up with those recipes probably needs to be replaced.  The glassware they're served in is pretty and if you order something simple you stand a better chance. We've really enjoyed the food when we've been though. Maybe it's because we always end up in the lounge drinking while waiting for a table so we're a few drinks in by the time the steak comes, but I believe the words 'worth every penny' and 'best steak I've ever had' were said the last time. It's true, the appetizers have annoying, twee bits and are on the small side for the price. They're good, but nothing I've woken up the next day thinking about.

I figured it out around the same time they did and was mortified. They sat us at the bar and pushed our existing res back so we could enjoy a drink since we were already there and it was a beautiful new space.

I have never been more pleased about making a mistake. Their small cheesy spicy biscuits were divine (I ate at least 6), their cocktails and wine were delicious and the meal was wonderful, not to mention the service! We were ""that table""  because of my faux pas but everyone was generous with grace, good humor, conversation and great menu and recommendations. The special sweet potato gratin was heaven, steaks were cooked to perfection, and the brussel sprouts had some sort of crack-aioli sauce that I will die trying to reproduce.

Needless to say, we made reservations when the restaurant first opened in NYC. We came for dinner only to learn they lost our reservation. The staff was unapologetic and very rude.

I later learned the lounge was first come first serve and I could have sat their without speaking to any of the managers. We were pleased with our steaks but they took forever to come out. We waited almost an hour. I was very disappointed with the service. The restaurant is pricey and I was expecting service to be up to par. After we were done with dinner the waitress told us we were ALLOWED TO ORDER ONE DESSERT, courtesy of the manager. I know this was supposed to be an act of kindness and a form of apology but the way it was presented to us was very rude. We are not children.
