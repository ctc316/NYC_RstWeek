4.0,4/15/2019,Came here during lunch hours and the food was pretty good. This place specializes in Asian fusion type dishes. We ordered a bunch of different plates to share and my favorite was probably the fried rice.

2.0,4/9/2019,"The drinks by the lobby bar were disappointing and quite expensive @ $16 a cocktail.The bartender was nice and the decor is pretty cool. Other than that there's literally nothing special about this place. We ended up going to a rooftop bar a couple blocks away that was just as good and not as pretentious.If you're looking to overpay for subpar cocktails, come burn your money here. Otherwise, save it for literally the hundreds of other bars within a one mile radius.",3,0,0,Peter K.,"Manhattan, NY",470,686,86
4.0,4/7/2019,"First impression - awesome atmosphere. The graffiti on the walls is fun and personally, I didn't notice that I was adjacent to a hotel. It was on the louder side but not so loud you couldn't have a conversation. There was lots of seating and it was open enough that we definitely didn't feel like we were eating with the table next door.We were disappointed that happy hour was only in the bar area. We ordered drinks anyway and they were good but I wouldn't pay $16 for the Endless Summer cocktail again.To eat, I ordered the avocado robata and buddha's delight dumplings. The dumplings were good albeit a bit dry. I would definitely order the avocado again. It was grilled perfectly and the cassava crackers added a great crunch to the dish. If I went back I honestly might just have two orders of avocado robata.",0,0,0,Sydney A.,"New York, NY",23,34,73

3.0,3/18/2019,"After walking past Rice and Gold a few times recently, Chuck and I decided to grab brunch this past weekend. We made brunch reservations at 2pm and got a pulsd deal (2 for $49). It was one of the first gorgeous spring days so we had a nice early afternoon walk in lower manhattan and arrived at 1:50. The restaurant is HUGE. There are high ceiling and awesome murals covering the walls and columns. We decided to sit at the bar but there was barely anyone there. The reservations were not exactly necessary. The bottomless brunch is a 2 hour deal but we were told that it has a hard end time set for 3 PM. That was misleading since the description said that we can make the reservations from 11-2pm and we had to call to speak with someone to do so. Whatever. We can deal with an hour and 10 minutes of unlimited instead. It was St Patrick's day weekend and we were not going to go back out there to find another brunch place. The unlimited includes 3 pretty typical brunch drinks with a slight flair to them. The mimosa was flavored with yuzu. The screwdriver had maraschino cherry juice. The bloodys had asian inspired spices. While beautiful, the cherry screwdriver was insanely sweet so I asked to cut back on some of the cherry juice. The food menu had a lot of different options. I was torn between the chicken and waffle and the oxtail noodles. Our bartender suggested that I get the chicken and waffles. It is a spicy, sweet mix that I definitely appreciated. The chicken was very crispy. It was drizzled in peppery honey and peanuts. The waffle was tiny but tasty. Chuck grabbed a burger and waffle fries. I haven't had waffle fries in ages so you better believe that I stole a few of them. Throughout the entire dining experience, our bartender did a great job filling our cups every time we emptied so while we did not get 2 full hours to sit there, we got the quantity of 2 hours mashed into one. I am not sure I'll be back any time soon. The food was ok. Drinks were ok. The service was quick and efficient at the bar. I can't necessarily complain about anything (other than the cutting us off nonsense) but I also can't rave about anything. It *was* amazingly convenient for a post brunch walk across the Manhattan bridge on a beautiful early spring day.",2,0,0,Erin P.,"Brooklyn, NY",340,314,1082
5.0,3/7/2019,"Stop. The. Presses. Now! Because I just had the most PHE NOM NOM ENAL dinner at Rice and Gold this evening. My husband and I stumbled on this place by accident. We were going to a party nearby. At first I assumed it would be so-so food in a super cool designed space (gorgeous murals, light fixtures, decor). That's cool. I like awesome murals. The food was BEYOND. I was wondering if it was a Michelin stars restaurant on the DL, the food was out of this world in terms of taste and texture combinations. We started off sharing 2 appetizers: the miso butter rice cakes, and the shrimp toast (topped with a generous dollop of avocado goodness). The rice cakes were more like Miso Crack Gnocchi, pillows of heaven that tasted so flavorful I practically melted into my seat. That shrimp toast?! DAAAAAMN! I wanted to go to every table and INSIST every try these dishes as a public service announcement. I cannot do these dishes justice. These were followed by Lu Rou Fan, pork fried rice served in a hot bowl topped with a generous portion of shredded nori and egg (I am hyperventilating and salivating just thinking about eating this. Damn I want another bowl) and All the Greens, a fantastic accompaniment, flavorful, with peanuts. I seriously cannot wait to go back. Their food is INCREDIBLE. Must go.",3,0,0,Nina R.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",133,68,3

4.0,3/5/2019,"I didn't know what to expect at Rice & Gold due to the mixed reviews. I bought a voucher for $69 for $130 worth of food. My boyfriend & I decided to order Family Style instead of Ala Carte & we were happy we did. The food just kept coming! We were so stuffed & delighted with every dish. The food was unique & well spiced. The only disappointment was we felt like we had been deceived with the ""happy hour"" half price drinks. Yes we should have asked to clarify however it was all over their menu exclaiming HALF PRICE DRINKS everyday 5 to 7. So when we got our very pricey bill due to the drinks we were informed only were half price at the bar. Fabulous.... So the Travelzoo voucher saves you 61 bucks as long as you do not drink!!

2.0,2/24/2019,"Ordered Rice & Gold breakfast room service 02/14 in the Hotel 50 Bowery, it was cold by the time it came up, along with the coffee being lukewarm. I had to guzzle it down before I ate so I can gather the last bit of warmth before it were completed cold. Bacon too hard. They already took my 20% tip, so I was forced to tip for room service, while I ate cold eggs, potatoes & bacon.Positive: the forks were wooden & really cool, the food presentation was awesome, the food looked good & tastes good, although it were cold, I could still taste some flavor. If it were warm this review would be a 5.The concierge in the hotel went next door to grab me a coffee as well as I was leaving for the airport.

The lobster hagow and pho soup dumplings. The food was mediocre. It was a fusion place. It did look beautiful, but for taste, I found it lacking. I thought the concept of pho soup dumplings were really good. But I didn't love the soup base. It's overpriced for what it is, but I understand that they're trying to upscale the place.

1.0,1/26/2019,"I don't typically write negative reviews, but our experience last night (1/25) was one of the worst dining experiences I think I've ever experienced. A bunch of friends found the restaurant for NYC restaurant week and were quite intrigued by the menu. We made a reservation for 7:45 pm. Let me say, the restaurant is gorgeous and has a very edgy vibe and good music. We sat down at around 7:50. This is where it takes a turn for the worst. It took around 20 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge us at the table. No one ever introduced themselves so we had no idea who was even serving us (not great hospitality). We ordered two drinks, one cocktail and one glass of red wine. The drinks took over 25 minutes to get to our table... insane. No apology from our server. We had to ask another server because ours went MIA. Appetizers: Ordered two salmon crudo and one spicy chicken bao. These apps took over 45 minutes to be served and once served, they only brought the salmon and the chicken bao took an additional 20 minutes AFTER everyone else was already served (2/3 people)!Entrees: Took another 45 minutes to come out and were actually COLD. They also messed our order up and one of the entrees was wrong... more waiting. We spoke to the manager who actually was quite nice. He said it was absolutely ridiculous how long stuff was taking. We had no idea what was going on. He comped our entire meal because it was just that bad! We left the restaurant at almost 10:00 PM! We sat down at 7:50... a little over two hours for a dinner that should've been an hour - hour and 45 at most. The service was nonexistent, unapologetic, and quite frankly seemed new/confused (messed up order and forgot things that we ordered and was never placed) Food seemed sub par, cold, lacking flavor, etc. I don't even know if I'm willing to give this place another try. This is an experience I have never experienced before and quite frankly was unacceptable.",4,0,0,Ryan Z.,"Parkland, FL",578,21,155

We ordered the grilled mushroom baos (amazing) and the fried cauliflower as an appetizer. Both were great. The main dishes (Thai fried chicken and Smoky miso salmon) with a side order of ""all the greens"" were both cooked perfectly (although people who are not used to spicy should beware of the chicken). We opted against dessert at the restaurant because neither dessert sounded right, but other than that I would definitely rank it as one of the better meals and experiences we have had recently at restaurants.

1.0,1/5/2019,"Service - 0/5 ratingWhen my boyfriend and I arrived there were about 5 other seated tables at the restaurant with only one server. When we were seated it took about 25 minutes until a bartender came over to our table to take our order. The waitress was nowhere to be found until the very end when she handed us our bill. Our waters were empty and never refilled once. There was no one to ask since there was not a single employee on the floor.Food - 1/5 ratingWe came here to try out the hyped up Pho soup dumplings. Unfortunately, it was just that...hype. They were expensive and did not taste like Pho soup, more like watered down beef broth. We also ordered beef tartar and fried noodles, both were overly salty that it was too difficult to eat. The only reason why I gave their food a 1/5 is because their shumai and spicy chicken bao were delicious and definitely their best dishes.Rice & Gold was definitely up there in price and considering that their food was mediocre at best with zero service, I would recommend eating elsewhere.",0,0,0,Irene H.,"New York, NY",231,7,1

It took a total of 3 hours and 15 mins to get seated, eat, and leave. Never even received our dessert. This place is a lesser TAO in terms of service and food. Save yourself the trip and go to the number of authentic local asian restaurants in the neighborhood. After flagging down everyone at the restaurant, my waitress came over after 30 mins and said she didnt know she was supposed to serve us. WHAT? Then proceeded to not serve us for the next 2.5 hours.

Very slow service, waited over an hour to get seated and waited long time to get food, not to mention we didn't receive three dishes. Place is nice and festive, good for large groups. Because of this ridiculous I am pissed off for not getting my three dishes that we paid for, the lies that they would bring it out but didn't, the lies that they didn't make enough (how does that make sense when we all had to make reservations and get tickets).

The restaurant itself is great to host a large party because it has nice decor, is very trendy, and very spacious.The start of the pre fixe menu was really good. The edamame was great, loved the shrimp toast, great Thai apple salad, and flavorful rice cakes. After the first few appetizers, the food started to go downhill for me and majority of the party. The chicken Bao tasted fine, but didn't seem like a cohesive dish. Something they just threw together. The salmon was fine and decent with the sauce. The fried rice was pretty bland and the oxtail noodles were way way way too salty. This was really disappointing because that's what I was looking forward to the most. It was so overly salted and doused in sauce that it was inedible for most of the table. Overall the staff was accommodating to our large party and we had a good time.

3.0,12/17/2018,"I would give Rice & Gold 3.5 stars if I could! I came here with a party of 3 for a small birthday dinner. I was excited to try this place because it seemed like they would do Asian Fusion better than others, especially being in Chinatown. We ordered the spicy fried chicken bao's and the crispy orange duck to share. The spicy fried chicken bao's typically come with two but they were very happy to adjust to add another one to the order which was nice. But we all agreed that the fried chicken bao's were the most disappointing part of our meal because it kind of just tasted like a McDonald's McChicken... We really enjoyed the crispy orange duck! The duck was definitely crispy and half the duck was enough for us to share. I like the twist on the mini tortilla (?) wraps that were used instead of typical buns like peking duck because it wasn't as much carbs. We each ordered the kimchi bone broth ramen for ourselves and we're so glad we did!! This was definitely the winner of the meal. The broth is a 16-hour bone broth and it's so creamy and flavorful. The pieces of beef in the ramen melted right in your mouth and the ramen noodles were perfectly coated with flavor. The kimchi pieces are diced up and blends perfectly into the broth, and the flavor of the kimchi isn't too overpowering. The reason why I would give this place 3/3.5 stars instead of bumping it up to 4 is because of the service! Initially, the waitress was very informative and patient with our questions and gave good feedback. But towards the end, we waited almost 45 minutes for our check and we had to remind her twice because they forgot. I also wish they would refill our waters more often because the food was salty and our cups were constantly empty! I would definitely recommend their ramen and duck! If you're interested in an Asian fusion restaurant that isn't as much of a tourist trap as Tao or Buddakan, try Rice & Gold!

2.0,11/27/2018,"We originally came here because of all the rave about their pho dumplings, bacon shumai, and other cool foods advertised on Insider, Instagram, etc. However, we noticed that these items weren't on the menu and therefore, I asked the waitress about these dishes. Our waitress was super sassy for no reason, and she kept repeating that ""whatever you see on the menu is what we have"" in a rather condescending voice. I asked her (out of pure curiosity) why the restaurant decided to get rid of these dishes since they are the dishes that made the restaurant popular in the first place, and she said management switched over.Anyways, we decided to at least drink some wine. We ordered a couple glasses of sauvignon blanc. We asked a couple of the servers walking by for glasses of wine, and each of them said ""yes"" or ""yeah."" However, they never brought us anything or conveyed anything to our waitress. Only about 10-15 minutes passed until the waitress came by and we successfully ordered our wine. Then, probably 10-15 minutes later she came back to announce that they don't have sauvignon blanc, and so they'll have to give us Pinot Grigio instead. Fine. Then, probably another 7 minutes passed until they brought us two empty glasses. And, finally -- probably another 10 minutes passed before my friend and I couldn't take it anymore, and we left. No wine. Overall, this place was a load of nonsense -- very poor service, and rather disheartening change in menu. The only reason this place received 2 stars instead of 1 is because the atmosphere is actually really cool and pleasant. I genuinely wish this place provided me with a good experience because of how nice the atmosphere is. It's a great place to go to enjoy the vibe, but not eat, not drink anything but water, and not expect any grand service.",1,0,0,Gabby S.,"Jericho, NY",0,9,1

The brick is covered with graffiti style murals. The booths looked super comfy and good for large groups. We started with two dim sum items and each got our own entree. The pho soup dumplings were different compared to normal soup dumplings, but still good. The fried chicken baos were adorable but the chicken could have been better. It was a bit hard and lacked meat. Both came three to an order for about $8-9. Definitely pricey compared to normal dim sum but this is a fusion place so lol. I got the bacon, cheese, egg fried rice and the portion was massive. I wouldn't say it's anything special aside from presentation in a cast iron-ish pan, but it does taste good.

2.0,11/16/2018,"My room at Hotel 50 Bowery includes breakfast at Rice & Gold. I arrived today/Friday around 730am and place is mostly empty. No greeter, no clear process for what to do. I waved down a staffer in the back and asked if I just sit anywhere and was told yes. I showed my breakfast ticket and was given a menu (only a few options) as well as buffet was pointed out. Buffet was $18 and breakfast sandwich $15. I chose to have a sandwich as buffet was sitting there with few customers so I worried about freshness as I like my food made to order. They took my order - lovely man who was coaching a new woman in a very respectful way as it appeared she was still learning. All of a sudden, a new staffer appeared who seemed pretty aggravated as she was chastising both of them for allowing ""this customer with a free breakfast card to order a la carte!"" These customers are ""only allowed to eat off the buffet!"" Â I was taken aback as I was 8-10feet from where they were and her voice was louder than conversational level so I (as well as the 2 other tables of customers) heard every word and her tone of annoyance and disapproval. I walked over and said this situation is my fault (to protect the workers who were just trying to serve a customer best way they could) and I'd be happy to eat from the buffet and it wasn't their fault. She looked surprised and backpedaled that she wasn't blaming them but training them. Really?! Â Is the management model to allow trainers to chastise and shame learners in an open dining room? I insisted again that I am fine to eat from the buffet and she replied,""too late, I already put the order in"". Customer service - not. She has opportunity to be gracious and chose to continue to look at her own inconvenience, fixate on a rule that was broken vs let's evaluate WHY this standard was missed as an opportunity to improve the current process. She came over while I was self consciously eating this contraband menu item and I apologized again that I got the two staff in trouble. She shrugged and said, ""well, next time you come, you'll know what you can order."" Â Final nail in the coffin as far as I'm concerned. I won't be coming back.

We couldn't decide on what to eat, so we went with one of their tasting menus. It looked like we were getting through the courses and were going to be left hungry at the end. Boy was I wrong! It was a delicious, filling meal. The highlight was the chicken which had some spice, some crunchiness to the outside and was outright delicious. The runner up was the dessert - that sundae variation was the perfect dessert for us to have had to find the space to pack away. Another recommendation, just because I can't really help myself from making it, is to try the fried cauliflower. It's soo much better than it may sound. The service was excellent.

Â The dishes themselves try to bring in component from a variety of Asian cuisines so expect a hybrid dish vs one that is ""authentic.""Some highlights:1. Â I really wanted to try the pho soup dumpling here. Â And literally, they tasted like a bowl of pho inside a xiao long bao with basil, sprout, and touches of chili. Â The wrapper itself is thicker than Joe's in Fushing but not bad. Â This was surprisingly good and worth a try.2. Â Scallion pancake: Tasty and interesting twist on a classic with cultured butter. Â It's not an authentic scallion pancake but pretty good if you take it on it own and enjoy as a uniquely fusion app. Â The pancake layers are definitely not a thin and flaky as A-Jiao's and the texture is more like a thin naan BUT it's still pretty solid as a standalone.3. Â Shrimp & lobster hargow: They took a leaf from Red Farm and made these with eyes. Â That aside, these were solid with a flavorful filling and served in a light broth with a touch of floral from the hisbiscus.4. Shrimp shumai with bacon: This was actually pretty good - the bacon added a salty/slightly smokey bite - slightly reminiscent of bacon-wrapped shrimp - in a shumai form topped with a slice of prosciutto and pickled mustard seed. Â I still prefer my traditional shumai with minced pork but this is worth a try if you are a bacon fan. Â 5. Â Hong Kong crab noodle: This was very good and comforting with a dungeness crab, chili, and chewy egg noodles. Â It's not actually very spicy but still pretty flavorful. Â 6. Â Miso butter rice cakes: Rice cakes stir-fried with miso butter and labneh, topped with furikake! Â This was an interesting concept to execute but the flavors actually worked together and your taste buds will get taken on a curve from savory to buttery to creamy.

It's Chinatown, and we just happened to be in the area because I was trying to find that (way overrated) bouncy cheesecake place (don't even bother with this nonsense). The front of the hotel is fabulous, so we went in to try the $18 breakfast buffet. This was prob one of the best breakfasts I have had in a long time. Everything was fresh and there were a lot of great choices. I like that it's a regular American breakfast with a few Asian choices. I like savory in the AM so this was perfect, and the price was very good. Service was pretty good (not enough wait staff IMO) but the staff that is there was friendly and helpful. Manager really cares if we were enjoying everything (rare). Also had bacon, egg and cheese fried rice and this is now my new thing.So we decided to come back for dinner - we have tried plain Chinese food but never fusion. WOW I was impressed.Garlic butter edamame is probably one of the best thing I ever had. I liked the watermelon salad, but the salad on top of the fruit was a bit spicy for me. GREAT palate cleanser.We had some of the Pho dumplings and Buddas delight - These were amazing. The dumpling wraps were so light and the flavors of the dumplings were spot on. The chicken bao (I forgot what they are called - those spicy little chicken buns) were AMAZING. So spicy and tasty, and the pickle was perfect on it.Last we had the supreme fried rice. It was delicious, it's how fried rice should taste.We had a peanut butter cookie ice cream sandwich and the matcha and melon ice cream for dessert. The matcha ice cream plate really refreshed me after all of that spice and salt and flavor - and the ice cream sandwich was so delicious and soft. It was truly a treat.I cannot wait to go back. The place wasn't packed bc we were there early, but the service was wonderful. The atmosphere alone is worth a visit. The food here was good. Pricey, but I definitely feel like our money was well spent.After dinner, we went up to the roof top lounge, The Crown. WHAT! I have never seen such a view, especially from lower Manhattan. I didn't feel like this was even a real place. I felt so fancy. Bartender was super friendly. I sort of feel like, if this secret gets out, this place will end up being such a hot spot.

2.0,8/27/2018,"We came to eat at Rice & Gold last weekend when I came across a sponsored Facebook posting (I really should know better) that discussed the pho soup dumplings that Rice & Gold had. It's a very new-looking space in the lobby of the Hotel 50 Bowery, with some odd touches of 'authenticity' sprinkled in - whether it be the graffiti-style wall art that depicts everyone in NYC as being perpetually grumpy (perhaps the artist thinks the 'Seinfeld' depiction of NYC was accurate) or the loads of waving cats stacked on the shelves that you can't see except when you are walking in (because they are too high), it feels like the restaurant is trying exceptionally hard to cater to an audience that doesn't actually live in the city. Service was quick, which I appreciated; the waitress who took our orders could have had an iota of personality, but it's close enough to Chinatown that one could be forgiven for thinking that this restaurant was trying to aspire to something more. The cocktails were mediocre and overpriced, and the beer selection limited. It's a shame, because the bar at the front was the one place I do wish I had been sitting from an ambiance perspective...the main dining room felt like a sterile large area that had a minimal amount of effort put into it.Enough on slagging about the ambiance, though. The food is what gives the place a modicum of redemption, but after thinking it over, I do think that you're really not getting your money's worth. The soup dumplings were actually pretty good, and the concept of utilizing other cuisine's flavors in a unique delivery 'mechanism' such as xiao long bao is quite innovative. That was really the best thing about the meal, though. The orange duck was good - I won't lie - but the 'orange' flavor was barely perceptible, and by the time you are done throwing hoisin sauce on the meat, you can't tell that it's anything different than Peking duck (minus the deilciousness of the crisped skin on that iteration). The scallion pancakes are only interesting because the cultured butter was good, but the pancakes on their own would make a true Chinese chef blush. The lobster and shrimp dumplings are presented in a cute way (I guess? Eating dumplings that look like fish, with soy sauce-painted eyeballs, was a bit disconcerting), but the flavor was nothing to write home about.Perhaps I ordered the wrong dishes; perhaps I am being too hard. But if you want a good Chinese fusion place, go to Chinese Tuxedo a few blocks away. Aside from having a bartender that understands how to make cocktails, it also more seamlessly blends Chinese sensibilities and plays on them in interesting ways. Rice & Gold is what many new restaurants in NYC are these days - inauthentic and blatantly trying too hard to justify its raison d'etre.",2,1,1,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169

3.0,8/19/2018,"With every new flashy, Westernized restaurant in Chinatown, a traditional restaurant is replaced. Rice and Gold used to be a huge Chinese restaurant called Golden Bridge, but now the place is transformed into a sleek hotel.The decor is beautiful and spacious. You experience that wow factor the moment you walk in. The hostess, waiters, and bus boys are all super friendly. I do appreciate the service here.However, the food is nothing to rave about.

1.0,8/19/2018,"tl;dr - food was good, but the service was pretty atrocious and the waiters were just... out of it. Management took no real responsibility for 1. forgetting someone's meal 2. bringing it out raw 3. recooking the raw, half eaten meal (???) 4. overall badness, and a painful three hours of my life.I went with my family for a weekend dinner, reservation at 6. The interior was gorgeous and actually enormous. There weren't too many other people there at all. My sister and my boyfriend ordered the salmon, and I ordered the Vietnamese shrimp. Be warned, the ""noodles"" are actually those little cellophane-like twisty bits that don't have any flavor or nutritional value thrown with a pretty salty sauce, three pieces of shrimp and three walnuts. All the appetizers were excellent in terms of flavor, but definitely very expensive especially for the small portion size. The cauliflower was really good. Once the entrees came out, the waitress realized that she had forgotten my boyfriend's salmon. So she said that it would be out soon, and sure enough another plate of salmon came out within 10-15 minutes. However, here was the kicker. And the point when the mistakes became unforgivable. The salmon. Came. Out. Raw. And so we asked for another salmon, and we were brought another plate. But the salmon piece was TINY. About half the size of the other filets, which made us suspect that the kitchen had simply taken my boyfriend's half eaten raw filet and refried that piece, instead of cooking a fresh filet. And the restaurant was actually pretty expensive so obviously we expected a much higher level of professionalism. Like, c'mon, the service should have been a LITTLE better, and with some expectation of responsibility from the servers - but nope, they just took the half eaten salmon back with no apology or anything. So at that point, my boyfriend was over it and we didn't ask that piece to be replaced again. The waitress brought us out a free serving of edamame (which was honestly amazing), and two free ice cream sandwiches. She also said that the manager would come to speak with us, but like my boyfriend's salmon, he never delivered and didn't show up. We ended up leaving the restaurant a little before 9. So we were here for almost 3 hours, which really goes to show how atrociously slow the service was. Overall, very VERY disappointed by this experience. The food was good, but the prices were inordinately high, and I've actually never had such a bad restaurant experience before. The restaurant made MULTIPLE mistakes here, and I would warn anyone else who wants to dine here. Take your business literally anywhere else, or else you're in for a pretty painful experience.",3,0,0,Rachel Z.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",406,47,50
4.0,8/18/2018,"Over a week ago, my friend (the birthday girl) made a reservation for tonight's get-together to celebrate her belated birthday amongst all her friends. I was already in the neighborhood wandering around Chinatown and headed over a bit early for dinner. The hostess mentioned that I was the first to arrive and I can wait by the bar or in the back...I chose the bar which was on the other side of the podium. I am so happy that my friend chose Rice & Gold because the restaurant was beautiful especially with graffiti plastered all over the walls. Our table was ready for us to be seated before we had a complete group of 10. It was right next to the glowing, gigantic dinosaur head. We got two orders of the Edamame...Oooo yummy with garlic soy butter! Cocktails: *I told our servers that we are looking for sexy cocktails...great for photoshoots lol*The birthday girl and my friend ordered Little Pink Corvette which was served in a flute glass. I was debating from Bondi Kelly (comes in an ugly glass) or Little Pink Corvette...definitely went with the Corvette...great choice...comes in a flute glass and topped with a rosebud...so refreshingly delicious Dim Sum: *for the table*I am assuming the goldfish-shaped was the Shrimp & Lobster Hargow...soo cute and they have eyes on them too hehe Since the Pho Soup Dumplings comes in 3s so our server suggested just getting 10, one per each person...sounds good! This xiao long bao definitely tasted like a big bowl of Pho lol Scallion Pancake cut up into tiny pieces but very yummy...spread some butter on that babyEntree: Crispy Orange Duck comes in a half $35 or full $68...the birthday girl and my friend shared that...I tried some of the duck...it was yummy but wish there was more crispy skin vs the duck meat Meat & Potatoes (medium well) ...Oooo *mama like* my dish...the tenderloin was cooked to my sorta perfection with some pink parts in the meat but at least it wasn't bloody because that would gross me out...if you're a carnivore like me...this dish is made for you Banana Leaf Whole Roasted Branzino was quite popular at our table but I am not a seafood person. I love eating meat way more. Dessert: The birthday girl ordered Coconut Mango and I winked at our server about the sparkler. I just wanted to make sure my Leo Sista had a wonderful night with yummy food and dessert along with her peeps.

3.0,8/11/2018,"Came for the pho soup dumplings. They were a bit pricy but I would say worth the experience. We were looking at the menu for additional foods to try but one guy, wasn't sure if he worked there or just knew the staff wearing shorts way too tight and a blazer came running in joking and laughing with the staff. His bulge flapping through the way too tight white shorts were a bit off putting to my friend and I, so we called it a day. The waitress also didn't seem to know what the sauces were on the table, which was okay, we experimented and determined we had a crushed garlic sauce, spicy sriracha blended with something else, vinegar with a chili pepper in it, and run of the mill kikoman soy sauce.

3.0,8/4/2018,"Came here last week as I happened to be in the area running errands before work and figured I'd check this place out for breakfast prior to heading into my office. The restaurant is attached to a hotel and during breakfast time, they have a breakfast buffet up, though you can also order off their menu, if you so choose. I opted for their breakfast buffet, which was priced at $18.Service was a bit minimal and the food options for breakfast were a bit limited. Aside from some mapo tofu dumplings, the buffet consisted of the standard breakfast items you'd see at virtually any other hotel chain breakfast bar around the country. I mention this as this is basically located in the heart of Chinatown, so you're probably expecting to see some more inspired dishes at play here (and to be frank, it looked like if you had ordered off their menu also, it wouldn't have been that drastically different, either). Buffets are still buffets, so I at least made sure I got my money's worth. Perhaps breakfast is not the best meal to judge this place for, so I'm hoping to come back during lunch or dinner for a better assessment of the place. Looks like they do dim sum, so perhaps I'll do that instead of this pretty basic breakfast spread again.",0,0,0,Cinthia K.,"Elmhurst, Queens, NY",238,699,367

The chicken was fine, the salad on top was fine and the bun was ok. It didn't all come together as a cohesive item though, which was disappointing. My friend got the beef rice noodles and it was a little too salty to finish (i tried it and agree). I also tried my friend's bacon fried rice that was too salty to start.

We then ordered the pho soup dumplings, spicy chicken bao, miso butter rice cakes, and shrimp & lobster hargow as appetizers.

4.0,6/7/2018,"I came here for a birthday dinner with two friends, and we had an absolute blast. Rice & Gold's food, service, and venue exceed what you would expect from a typical Chintown dining experience - and that's because this restaurant isn't your average Asian American restaurant. The moment you walk in, it will probably take you a few seconds to fully absorb the spacious interior with high ceilings and hip wall mural. The dining area is quite large with tables sparsely spread around, so the last thing you have to worry about is feeling claustrophobic. I could totally imagine this place being a fantastic event space, and from my understanding, lots of businesses and companies do host parties here. My favorite seats are located right by the kitchen where you can see the chefs busily cooking up a storm. Contrary to what a lot of other reviewers seem to say about the price/portion size - I think it's pretty reasonable. Honestly, you shouldn't be comparing Rice & Gold to Joe's Shanghai or Shanghai Cafe where you can get 8 soup dumplings for $5. The quality of food (and cleanliness) is just incomparable to the price of cheap Chinese comfort food. However, even without the other cheap Chinatown restaurants in mind, the food portion is fair (to say the least) for what you pay, and it's just a matter of reminding yourself that this restaurant is supposed to be on the upscale end. The menu is really interesting, and I'm sure you've heard about its famous pho soup dumplings. They are in fact very good, but I would encourage you to try out other dim sums on the menu because I really enjoyed the lobster and scallop har gow. During my next visit, I am even down to have a dim sum party by ordering mainly dim sum, and dim sum only. In addition to dim sum, we also ordered Singapore silver gnocchi (very interesting and good), mushroom sticky rice, sticky twice cooked pork ribs, and cauliflower. Everything we ordered was super flavorful, and I really think you are in for a surprise every time you take a bite into something new. The flavors are definitely non-traditional, but I appreciated the unique Asian American taste consisted of ingredients that were very intentionally paired together. If you prefer bland food, not sure this is where you want to be. Overall, I had a fantastic experience, and I would definitely go back to explore other items from the menu. It seems like Rice & Gold is starting to get really popular for its pho soup dumplings (I've seen it be featured on several food social media accounts), so make sure to stop by before you have to make reservations weeks in advance! *Shout out to Chef Jae Lee for being an amazing executive chef",0,0,0,Lisa L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",385,62,678

Yes it is more pricey compared to soup dumplings at your standard Chinese restaurants but you're paying for the total experience.Duck spring rolls- 2/5- honestly this tasted like any fried spring roll from a takeout place... so this was super expensive for what it is.Calamari- 4/5- well seasoned and super tender calamari. The dipping sauce was also deliciously sweet and tangy.Shishito peppers- 4/5- I love a good blistered shishito pepper.

Who knew cauliflower that's seasoned like galbi could be this good?!? Very crunchy and soft veggie dish with amazing flavors.

Â It was a great combination of flavors. Â The sausage was interesting for me, I don't believe that I have ever had a Chinese meal with sausage, it was just a bit spicy - not much... Â The concoction did have some very hot uncut red peppers floating around and my wife did manage to cut one and bite into it. Â Our waiter brought her a glass of milk to aid in her recovery from that experience. Â the gnocchi were large and difficult for me to handle with chop sticks so I gave up and used the fork.Great upscale Chinese dining experience. Â I understand that you can eat on the roof so if you have good weather, consider trying that. Â Overall it was a quiet reserved and refreshing place to enjoy food and conversation.",0,0,0,Brad H.,Fair Play,65,481,107
2.0,5/10/2018,"I really wanted to like this place. I had bookmarked this spot due to seeing a post on IG about their Pho soup dumplings & when my favorite soup dumpling place closed in Chinatown, we reluctantly decided to try out This Place on Friday, about a week ago from today. The place was big and spacious and I loved the art decor, graffiti on the walls and maybe a bit too many waving cats for taste, but whatever. The staff was kind to a point; when it came to ordering, the menu was a bit confusing and really pricy, but what do you expect from a trendy fusion spot? I mean we all wanna be cool hipsters with fancy meals. We had planned on spending $20 for the food we were craving but knew coming here that wasn't going to happen. When we ordered, we tried to order the Samba Shrimp dish and our waitress was kind enough to warn us about the spice level of this dish, because it's incredibly spicy. I can't eat anything spicy, I can't tolerate it so we specifically asked her verbatim, what in this menu isn't spicy then so that I can eat. I specifically said I can't handle it. She said that everything else is not spicy. That was a complete and utter lie. Everything we ordered, except the pork belly buns, were literal fire and I was in pain. I couldn't even eat anything after a few bites. My fiancÃ© who does eat spicy food, even said this was spicy. When we asked to pack it without even really even eating anything, she didn't care to ask why and inquired about dessert, so I told her that I can't even feel my mouth because it was spicy, she told me she warned. Umm no you didn't. You told me one dish was spicy. I get it. If you were HONEST, I may not have ordered anything, but my fiancÃ© would have. I can't tell you about the taste because I tasted nothing but the heat of the spice, but I really didn't like the fact that she couldn't even own up to it and pretended she didn't just lie. If you like heat, this is your place but if you actually like to taste food with a slight spice go somewhere else. And really? $8 for 3 pho soup dumplings? Our bill was almost $100 for food even my fiancÃ© didn't enjoy. Go somewhere else.",1,0,0,Layne C.,"New York, NY",1,31,9
1.0,5/2/2018,"What a nasty Host!Didn't even make it past giving the time I wanted to make my reservation for before I hung up the phone! Hire staff that care about how they represent themselves and the restaurant as a whole. If your first point of contact is some uninterested girl named, Gia, who doesn't care to tell you when they are open why would we want to dine there? The Host (Gia) made a mistake in thinking I was asking for a reservation at a time they were not open and instead of directing me to a time that they were open, she simply said ""we're not open then"" in the nastiest tone I've ever heard from a person in a customer service position. In reality, she heard me wrong and instead of correcting her mistake, kept on with her intolerable additude. Needless to say, no one dined there that night, and I shall tell others to do the same.I would not eat here or anywhere else where the face of the restaurant being as nasty as that- no doubt the rest of the restaurant is full of uninterested 'Gia's'.

5.0,4/19/2018,"Pleasantly surprised!I've heard a lot about the pho soup dumplings and I assumed it was just another overly hyped hybrid but they did a great job with the flavor and overall execution of the texture. A little pricey coming in at $8 for an order of 3 soup dumplings but it's worth trying at least once. Not amongst the best I've had but definitely better than I expected.Food wise, we also ordered the pork buns ($8 for 2), duck spring rolls ($9 for 3), spicy chicken laksa noodles ($16), jerk roast duck ($35 for half order) and the wok tossed asparagus ($11). The pork bun was also another nice surprise but the duck spring rolls were very mediocre. If you like coconut curry and chewy wavy noodles, the spicy chicken laksa is for you!! This was my favorite and even though I was so full, I couldn't stop having more. The soup/blend is very flavorful and the noodles are perrrrfectly chewy. The jerk roast duck is a non conventional take on the original and a good option to share for the table. The asparagus was great but a little heavily sauced, which on some level made me feel like it defeated the purpose of ordering a vegetable.This was a very generous order for a table for 2 and we had leftovers. If I were to return, I would probably aim for one appetizer, one carb, one protein and one vegetable dish to share. The cocktails were also delicious. My favorite was the ""Endless Summer"" ($16) - tarty w/ tequila. The meal got a little pricey but not surprising for a restaurant inside a hotel.

We had just came from a different restaurant so we only settled for 1 order of the soup dumplings. To our dismay, the order only came with 3 dumplings. Strangely enough, the menu states it is $8 and we were charged $9 on the receipt (yes, before tax), but a dollar didn't seem enough to cause a ruckus over.The dumplings came garnished with basil leaves, beansprouts, onion, chili pepper, and cilantro. The ingredients for the perfect pho bowl. We carefully scooped a dumpling up in our spoon and let it sit for a couple minutes to avoid burning our mouths with the soup inside. I'm not sure if there's a ""correct"" way to eat it, but we just shoved the entire things in our mouths and let the dumplings pop and burst as they please.

4.0,3/4/2018,"What you need to know: - Large, hip and energetic space - good for groups and lively get togethers! - The restaurant is the 8th from Dale Talde, a Filipino American who appeared on Top Chef - The menu features elements from various Asian nations - We went for lunch during Restaurant Week and ordered from that menu as well as from their regular menu - Accepts credit cards - Friendly and knowledgeable wait staff What we ordered: From the Restaurant Week menu - price $29 for lunch: shrimp & bacon shumai, roast duck pho and king's sundae. - Shrimp & bacon shumai - I consider myself a shumai connoisseur, savoring these juicy morsels at every dim sum place possible. I have to admit these were spectacular! They are larger than most, the pork in the shumai tasted clean, incredibly fresh and was so juicy, it was dripping! The shrimp in it was substantial and had a crisp crunch to it! It was topped with cured Benton's ham and a bit of mustard. - Roast duck pho - I love the concept and the creativeness! Duck is not a common choice of meat for pho. The pho is topped with two plump choice pieces of duck. However, the broth lacks the complexity and umami-ness of beef broth. I thought it was just ok. - King's sundae - caramel cookies and cream ice cream with Hong Kong egg waffle and topped with pecan caramel and whipped cream with sprinkles. It looked better than it tasted. Could have just skipped this. From the regular menu: - Pho soup dumpling $9 for 3 pieces - genius idea! The soup was definitely pho broth. The meat was juicy, the skin was thin and the size was generous. It is worth a try! - Spicy duck laksa $15 - this was our favorite thing we ate! There is such a lack of laksa in NYC but this totally filled my Southeast Asia-yearning heart for it! Rich, coconut creamy, spicy, sweet, and crunchy from the anchovies. It was a magical blend of textures and flavors! My eating partner and I agreed we would totally come back for this! I have ""laksa"" love for this!",3,0,0,Karen L.,"Brooklyn, NY",98,196,861

The restaurant is part of a hotel so can be a little easy to miss but be careful not to try to enter through the wrong door (I know i did). The decor is pretty nice. They embrace the Chinese background and location they are in while making it pretty contemporary. The service was decent. It wasn't bad or anything but it also wasn't memorable. You can say that it was good since everything went very smoothly. The food was decent. We got the pho soup dumplings which was good and tasted just like pho, however there was something about it that left me want more (dumpling wise and quality wise). It was pretty pricey I thought ($16 for 6) but it's worth trying. We also got the lobster fried rice which was good but a little more oily than we would've preferred. The fish was tea smoked branding was really good though. It had a really good brightness to it with some great subtle complexity. I would definitely recommend it.

Management is really friendly and servers are pretty attentive. However, it can be hard to flag them down sometimes just because there are usually lots of group dining.Drinks are creative and tasty. The small plates and dumplings are the stars. I would skip the noodles and rice plates. They aren't necessarily bad but you expect more. The fried rice all needed more wok flavor and the rice was slightly mushy. The noodles were overcooked and the flavors just didn't blend. The jerk duck itself needed more seasoning and is bland without the sauce. However, it was cooked well. The pho dumplings and the roasted pork buns were the favorites of the table. They are creative and a fresh take on classics. They were executed very well. The mapo tofu dumplings were too vinegary and the skin on the lobster egg rolls was a bit thick. The skin on the squid ink dumplings were just thick enough to hold in the filling. The sauce that it came with was so delectable that you want to lick it clean. The kebabs were tender and had a nice char to them. The lamb buns were just enough fatty with enough meat. The buns were fluffy and the lamb was also not too gamey.

Pork Belly Skewers (2 pcs) for $15 - my favorite thing on the menu and was the only thing that was actually good. It was in some caramelized miso glaze garnished with smoked pickled daikon. It was so sweet, tender, and flavorful. If you're going to try anything, this is the must try. Everything else is beyond underwhelming.2. Candied pork buns (5 pcs) for $16 - just tastes like a sweetened dinner roll with roasted BBQ pork inside. It was pretty good, but it did not wow me. 3. Shrimp and bacon shumai (5 pcs) for $16 - standard shumai but the sauce it is served in is so salty and just tasted like soy sauce and water. Huge disappointment. 4. Pho soup dumplings (5 pcs) - meh. Clearly frozen with shriveled skin and bland minus the morsel of pepper they put on top of each dumpling. Not impressed, but it's still pretty OK.5. Lobster and scallop in squid ink har gow skin (5 pens) for $19 - huge disappointment. It is absolutely flavorless. It just looks neat. I wouldn't bother getting thins one. 6. Crispy Mapo tofu dumplings (5 pcs) for $15 - my least favorite. Sauce was so salty (like soy sauce and water) and very heavy in the fermented beans. Not a fan.7. Lobster egg roll (2 rolls) for $18 - menu claimed to be squid ink but it wasn't. Tastes like a plain egg roll - don't waste your money on this. 8. Octopus skewered (2 skewered each with 2 pieces of tentacles) for $15 - average, it came with mini slices of potato chips the size of pennies. It was OK but again, but enough flavor.9. Thai fried chicken for $24 - with dirty rice, pickled chili, egg, and lime peanuts. I do not recommend. It was so bland I don't even have much to say except for the dry chicken. I'm the chicken was so dry and over cooked that the skin/breading was hard and crunchy I thought I was biting in to bone. 10. Pancit palabok for $28 - with temomi noodle, quail egg, smoke trout roe, and chicharron. We were not fond of this either. There was no flavor except for the roe so bring/fishy noodles if you're in to that. 11. Old #10 cocktail - tastes like gin if you like gin, but waitress was far from resourceful. If you don't know a drink recommendation or don't know anything about a drink, ask the bartender.And the service: Our waitress was pretty bad. Nice, but not the brightest of the crayons. She couldn't even describe cocktails and wouldn't even get the help she needed. I asked her how the Old #10 was and she couldn't say anything at all about it. She couldn't even get someone who knew the menu to. She just said, ""I don't know but if you get it and you can tell me how it is."" Granted, she did say I could send it back if I didn't like it. I actually really did not like it.She also managed to spill our drinks. She nearly dropped the tray and ended up spilling a bunch. She would have re-topped off the beer at least. I also told her to charged my card since it's my sisters birthday dinner and this knucklehead managed to fk that up too and charged my sister. I gave her my card so she can swipe it!!!!!

4.0,2/7/2018,"I was so sad that I missed the yelp elite event hosted in this restaurant a month ago as I got in after. So I was determined to check it out during the last week of the NYC restaurant week.The restaurant is on the right of the hotel entrance. It's one big open space with really cool vibe. Three of us were the first customers as we got there when it was just open for lunch (12pm). We could literally sit anywhere we wanted. Service was very attentive. Two of us decided to try the restaurant week menu and the other ordered the salmon bento box. Appetizers: the candied pork buns were awesome! They were almost like the famous ones at Tim Ho Wan. The shrimp and bacon shumai were good size and were delicious. Entrees: chicken salad was good. The chicken pieces were big enough that we needed to cut it up into smaller pieces. The duck pho was a bit spicy and definitely had an exotic taste to it. The salmon bento was excellent and it came with rice and soup.Dessert: King's sundae was a great choice! HK waffle was made fresh but it wasn't crispy. However the ice cream and the pecan was so goooood and definitely worth every calorie. Overall, it's an upscale Asian fusion restaurant inside a hotel. Unlike most other places in Chinatown, you won't find those $5.25 lunch specials. If you prefer to dine in a quiet and clean place in the heart of Chinatown, this would be a great choice.",0,0,1,Teresa L.,"New York, NY",92,413,3576

3.0,1/30/2018,"Located in the lobby of a brand new hotel in Chinatown. The space is huge. It open and airy, has a hipster-ish vibe, and is very comfortable. I came here with some friends for dinner on a weekday and it was mostly empty. They seated us right way and let us choose were we wanted to sit. The staff was very friendly and appeared to be very knowledgeable. The food however was mediocre and very overpriced. The much hyped pho soup dumplings is served lukewarm, lacked any rich flavor and at $16 for 5 small dumpings, it quite pricey. The 3 Kings Pho was the star of night and at $30, it should be. The addition of bone marrow made the broth much richer and it was a welcome treat. They serve it in a very big bowl and it makes it seem larger than it really is. It can feed two at most, one if you are really hungry. As much as I dig the vibe at Rice and Gold, it's not a good value. You can get much better food at a fraction of the price in the neighborhood.",4,0,1,Tom C.,"New York, NY",135,258,391

Between the relaxed vibe, delicious food, and drinks drinks drinks, we had a blast.

3.0,1/29/2018,"So sad to be giving this place a 3 star rating because honestly everything about the food here was amazing. The tofu dumplings, shrimp & bacon shumai, a simple chicken salad, and omg the desert! Everything was exceptional. Now let's get to the point...came during lunch hour. Greeted immediately and sat at the table of our choice because the place was empty. Great first impression. Placed our drink and food order immediately...our drinks took 20 minutes to come out (the place was EMPTY) asked or server twice and she completely dropped the ball. We eventually received our appetizers, finished them and still no drinks. Then when they came...for $16 I expect to taste the alcohol. I'm not saying I need a heavy pour, but if I'm paying top shelf prices for drinks I expect an impecable drink. Service was terrible especially considering the restaurant was empty and the drinks were not worth the price. Because the food was amazing I really hope this place gets it together. Never would have thought this would be the rating for a ""Top Chef"" restaurant. All in all, food was AMAZING, but if you come drink water and don't expect great service no matter how busy or empty it is. The price complaints considering the area and the chef, I don't agree with considering the area. The price was worth the food, just not for the bar. And in my opinion...for ANY restaurant, when your patrons are given good drinks that drives your business. Good drinks = ordering more food. Side note for the owner/manager: I wish I would have caught his name, but the runner really did try to do everything he could to help. I witnessed a young man who was passionate and willing to help where he could, definitely tried to pick up where our server lacked. He even pulled her aside to let her know he was checking in on us for her. Unfortunately it should have never been his responsibility to do so.

3.0,1/27/2018,"Came in without a reservation. Single person on a busy Saturday night. Was able to get a seat quickly. The host was professional. The place itself is trendy and hipster, a bit loud at is has a high capacity of people. Service is amazing. 5 stars. The waitress and staff were polite and were able to answer my questions. Quick and professional. Now, the problem was the food. I had the following:1) Pho Soup Dumplings-$16 for 5 small dumplings. Biting into each of the dumplings gave a burst of flavorful soup. However, it was still lukewarm, and the pho itself was only so-so. The idea is intricate and trendy, but for the price and amount, maybe not worthwhile. Definitely NOT enough to make yourself full.2) Octopus Skewers-The octopus was genuine fresh octopus with interesting texture due to the well-cut. I enjoyed the skewers and the sauce it came on. But the flavor wasn't that addicting. It was good, but not something I will order again.3) Thai Fried Chicken-Came in warm pot. The chicken was well cook and tasty. Problems came in two. One, the rice was not either overdone or cooked with uneven heat distribution. As a result, some part of the rice is fluffy while other parts were dried and sticky. Felt like I was eating fluffy white rice with sticky rice. As someone born eating-rice daily, this was a major disappointment. Two, the dish was TOO SPICY. So much pepper that it made me want to sneeze and cry. I usually only eat spicy food with a Medium rating, so this is easily my own fault. The problem was that the waitress didn't advice me about how spicy the food was. HOWEVER! Not the fault of the waitress, as when she found out, she asked nicely about if she should talk to the manager. She was decisive and professional. It might be due to how busy it was that this slipped her mind. Conclusion:At the end of the day, the food was okay. It made me full but not exactly enough for me to come back. The place is trendy, and a good date location or celebration dinner location. But the price and the taste, not enough for me to come back again.",2,0,0,Ming L.,"Washington, DC",89,11,6
2.0,1/27/2018,"Service is friendly and good, and drinks and appetizers (pho dumplings = very good) came out within a reasonable amount of time. Fun atmosphere, big space, not crowded. It was really nice to sit in an oversized booth--a rarity in Manhattan. However, it took 30+ minutes after the appetizer was eaten for entrees to arrive. The waitress noticed after a while and assured us that the good would arrive soon. When it did, I was surprised by the generous portions (though entrees are not inexpensive so it's nice to get more), but also disappointed by them. The pho (allegedly the most expensive in the city) definitely tastes like marrow, which is yummy but after a while becomes quite bland. I wished there were sauces that you could add like you would to regular pho in any other restaurant. The fideos were good at first, but I think that was because I was SO INCREDIBLY HUNGRY after waiting so long for the entrees. By the fourth bite I noticed how over salted the dish was and couldn't eat any more of it.

3.0,1/24/2018,"Went here with my sister and her husband on a trip to New York. Saw the pho soup dumplings in a video and had to try it! Other than the pho soup dumplings I got the branzino, duck fried rice, shishito peppers and mapo tofu dumplings.First the interior -- extremely interesting with a mural of important people in NY (?) it was very trendy -- it's intimate and date night appropriate enough, yet very hipster and cool. Definitely like the atmosphere and the server was very friendly as well, and gave us lots of suggestions for what to order.In terms of the food I enjoyed the pho soup dumplings and branzino the best, but definitely did not live up to the pho soup dumpling hype and price point. The pho soup dumpling was warm and a good idea I mean pho and soup dumpling seems to be like a match made in heaven, although I've had better pho elsewhere and think they could improve the pho taste since it almost tasted like there were too many spices, instead of the comfort food that most soup dumplings are. The branzino had good flavors, but was a bit too oily for my taste. The shishito peppers were also a bit oily, but had strong flavors, but was unexpectedly spicy (at least some of them were! Kind of like a pepper Russian roulette -- fun) The not so good I would say were the duck fried rice, mediocre and kind of soft for fried rice (being Chinese the ""best type of fried rice"" is when the rice grains are separate! That's the golden rule!) and I'm not sure if the dates really worked for me. The mapo tofu dumplings I really disliked. Mapo tofu is supposed to be spicy and have strong flavors, but it was a bit bland. It was crunchy and had good texture on the outside, but the inside was squishy and not very flavorful. Didn't taste like what I know mapo tofu to be unfortunately. Overall, good ideas, but questionable execution and a little overhyped unfortunately.",3,1,1,Lihan C.,"Lisle, IL",617,143,197
3.0,1/24/2018,"I'm a huge fan of Talde in JC, so I was excited to try Rice and Gold out. Sadly, it didn't quite meet most of my expectations.Atmosphere: Made a reservation for Saturday brunch at 11am. Very empty at that time, so reservations probably weren't needed. The place is very spacious, with awesome graffiti and Maneki-nekos lining the walls. Food: I'll admit the food is very pretty presentation wise. Below is my assessment of the things we tried:Pho Soup dumplings: five for $16, aka ridiculously overpriced, as most others have stated on here. I'll admit the dumplings tasted like pho, however the broth was lukewarm. They should either give more dumplings, or lower the price.PB&J Sesame balls: My favorite dish here. Be careful, as the filling can explode and it is HOT (temp wise, obvs). The sesame ball is very crunchy yet soft, and the filling has more peanut butter than jelly filling, but overall it was perfectly sweet and delicious. Much more affordable than the soup dumplings, at about 5 for $7 or $8Dale's Sandwich: I was really excited to try this after seeing pictures. Sadly, it is all looks. The bread was nice and soft, and so were the eggs, but aside from that, the sandwich was rather bland, and it was lacking in bacon flavor despite having bacon in it. Also, the hash brown was so oily that it defeated the crispy outer part of it. The sandwich all together got too soft and squishy towards the end. I did enjoy the waffle fries, however. Those were perfectly crisp, but lacking in any additional seasoning. The price for this was good though, at $13. It's a decent amount of food.Matzoh Ball Ramen: Really, REALLY dense. They don't skimp on the ramen in this dish, so much that the broth kind of disappeared after a while. This dish tasted like a standard matzoh ball soup, but I think because of the added starches, it kind of made the dish less flavorful. I wasn't that big of a fan, but my boyfriend said he enjoyed it.Service: Great, albeit a little on the slower side. However, everyone was really friendly, and when I reserved on open table, I noted we were celebrating my birthday (which was later in the week). They generously surprised me with ice cream and a huge ass sparkler. The ice cream was yummy. I don't feel the urge to come back, but maybe I will. The first impression wasn't all that great overall, though. And I would avoid the pho soup dumplings. Just go get pho elsewhere and you'll be good, haha.",5,1,2,Tiffany O.,"Newark, NJ",314,516,1390

The special braised dumplings in kimchi aioli had good flavor but, again, the wrapper could be better. It had a hard-chewiness to it that reminded me of freezer burn - maybe if they steamed then pan fried it (gyoza style or something). The Fideos was too salty that after awhile it had no other flavor other than salty. The crispy papaya salad with watermelon was a touch on the sweet side and way too heavy on the fried... also, I had to send my drink back multiple times... if you're dying to try pho soup dumplings, try it.

Our cool and down to earth host Sang had our group try some of the menus popular items like the candied dumplings which were addictive; the octopus skewers was tender and delicious; the lobster fried rice and the soup and lobster dumplings were really tasty and the sticky rice had so much flavor along with the brussel sprouts. My favorite dish was the Branzino... perfectly seasoned. The cocktails were strong ( just the way I like them) I will definitely be back.,0,0,0,Antaya C.,"Mount Vernon, NY",75,43,39
2.0,12/16/2017,"There was a wait to be seated even though the restaurant was half empty. The waitress was really nice but the food was not at all. The chicken fried rice tasted like food my father made when he would freak out because my mother was at work and his kids were hungry. He would take a mixture of various left over dishes from the fridge and put them all in one pan. Too many flavors that do not go well together. Grapes, peanuts, vegetables, chili sauce. We also had Brussel sprouts and they were not good either. Same issue and I accidentally ate a huge piece of garlic. Eeeeeek",2,1,0,Dee V.,"Manhattan, NY",67,55,0

We ordered sesame balls but the server forgot about it, which took extra time. So we canceled it. But the other server brought it several minutes later and took it back from our table couple minutes after realizing that we canceled that order, which I found ridiculous. We ordered the duck pho and avocado toast, and both were not good, either. Would not come back.",2,1,0,Hanna K.,"New York, NY",19,79,324
2.0,12/16/2017,"Was excited to go to Rice and Gold! I love other Talde establishments I've been to, and really like dim sum and ramen (which they had this night).Firstly, the space is huge, which is good, because we came with our baby in a stroller (we called in advance and they said they could accommodate, which was great). Â They found us a table near the back away from the cold and where we could keep the stroller comfortably. Â So far so good. And thats where it stops.We sit down and we order drinks. Â Before we can even order food (or you know, after we leave) the maintenance person comes and starts mopping the floor next to our table, with some sort of noxious chemical mixture. Literally, puts down a sign that says caution wet floor, and goes to work. Â My wife, sister, and I were shocked as he continues to mop away. I get that it was snowing and we had a stroller that tracked some dirt in, but certainly that can wait. Â He also moved the stroller to mop under it, without asking. Â That did not bother me, but it might bother others. Â The smell of the cleaning mixture permeated for quite a while.Our drinks came and mine was very good. I had the white rum drink, and it was delish. Except for the fact that basically the entire low ball glass was taken up by a giant ice cube. Â 14 dollars for a few ounces of a drink and a lot of ice.We ordered our food. Â The Rabbi Ramen, which is a matzo ball soup ramen. We also ordered the thai fried chicken rice, brussel sprouts, shishito peppers, and the pho dumplings. Â My wife has an allergy to onions and scallions. She understands that in many foods the onions and scallions are already cooked in and there is nothing she can do, so she will eat those (as cooked onions/scallions do not bother her) but raw are a no go. Â We tell the waitress this and she says she will tell the kitchen.We also tell her to please put everything in together, we dont care what comes out when, as we want to eat as fast as possible to get the baby home.The first item comes out, and its the Pho dumplings. $14 for dumplings that are not at all worth $14. Â But I digress. Â Sitting on top of every single dumpling are raw onion. Â We have the baby and dont want to hold things up, so we dont say anything.Next up is the ramen. Â Firstly, wholly uninspiring. The broth was good, but the matzo balls were hard and not fluffy as any deli would have them. Â It seemed as if they came out of a Manischewitz can. We ordered two bowls, one for my and my sister to share, and another for my wife. For my wife's we requested, again, no extra onions or scallions. Â If they are in the broth, fine, but do not sprinkle any on.The soups come and sure enough, both have scallions and onions sprinkled on. Â We bring over the waitress who tells us that those are cooked in, but then looks again and realizes they were sprinkled on and brings it back. Â My sister and I eat our ramen so it does not get cold, and it takes us until we finish ours for the second try of my wifes. Â Right there on top, onions and scallions again. Â We tell the server who brought it over and the waitress comes over again, aghast, and apologizes.The ramen comes out a third time, and the waitress said the manager will come speak to us. Â When it was ready, he brought it over and said, here it is with no toppings on it, its really good. (thats all he said). Â Apparently in chicken soup, chicken is a topping, because there was no chicken. Â At this point, with the baby, we didnt want to say anything else, so she ate the broth, noodles, and bad balls. (in the end they took the second ramen off the bill, which was great, but made no mention of it to us)Oh and the baby. We had asked for everything to be brought out when it was ready. Â After we finished our ramen, we sat there for 20 minutes waiting for the rest of our food. Â I had asked if there was something up, and the waitress said ""you were so excited about the ramen, I put that in first. Your other stuff should be coming soon"". Â Literally the exact opposite of what we asked for. Â So it ended up taking an extra 30-40 minutes for us to finish eating. Â By the end we got most of it packed up since we really had stayed out much longer than we intended.I will say that the chicken from the thai chicken rice was really, really good (not the actual rice). Â Also, the shishito pepers were spicy and delicious -- I enjoyed the sauce. Then, as an icing on the cake, as we are packing up to leave (it was cold and snowy so it took an extra minute to bundle up) they start coming to clear the table, and now we are stuck as they are blocking the booth.But all in all, between cleaning with bleach or whatever as we are sitting there (with a baby), small portions on drinks relative to price, orders being messed up, and overall food quality, I would not come back here ever again.",2,0,0,Steven F.,"Monmouth, NJ",0,9,0

We ordered 4 appetizers which came at a decent time. Their famous pho soup dumplings...shouldn't be famous. Our entrees (the fish, lobster rice, chicken rice, and cauliflower) took 30 minutes to arrive after FINISHING our appetizers. RIDICULOUS. The rice was horrible, kind of like they dumped a bunch of ingredients in it hoping it would taste good, but failed miserably. The fish sauce was crazy salty!! So salty, we opted for eating the fish with no sauce after drinking a ridiculous amount of water. The cauliflower was spicy, but not labeled spicy in their menu AND you wrap it with lettuce... have you ever had to wrap a vegetable with another vegetable? Something's off about that.We were there for a birthday and requested that the birthday cake and the bill for the dinner come out as soon as they cleared our dishes. The cake took 20 minutes to come out, the cake cut into slices for the table took another 15 minutes, and then to top it off... the bill took another 15 minutes after that to come! But wait, the biggest mess up comes last. They messed up 3 bills and charged the WRONG credit cards for each table!

This restaurant was very nicely decorated and spacious I must say, it was in a nice location right in the middle of Chinatown... HOWEVER they deserve a bad review due to the following reasons:1) Service was SLOW, they took 20 minutes to bring us our dishes, another 20 minutes to help cut our birthday cake (mind you there was a $5 cutting fee per person), another 20 minutes to get us our bill, another 20 minutes to bring us our receipts.2) Food was not good, the Lobster Fried Rice was wack and had barely any lobster, it looked more like little pieces of bacon bits. The Coconut Bread was the equivalent of the $1 chinese don go jai cakes from the Chinatown street carts. The Branzino Fish was SO salty, we never drank so much water in one sitting. The Cauliflower was extremely spicy, they instructed us to wrap it in lettuce before we ate it. What kind of dish wraps a vegetable in another vegetable??3) We asked our Server to save 1/2 of our birthday cake and to use the other 1/2 to cut 5 slices. He was so confused he came back 5 minutes later just to ask us again how we want it cut, not that complicated now...4) Finally the BILL, our Server/Manager ended up swiping our credit cards for the WRONG table. We got our bill back, ready to sign and leave but noticed someone else's credit cards on our table. Our cards were processed for the table next to us, who had our credit cards for their $700 bill! and to make things worse, when we informed the restaurant, they lost the next tables credit cards!

2.0,12/2/2017,"No. No. No. NO. NOOOOO! -- First off, let me start by saying it looks beautiful inside. Super fancy, with a steam punk and graffiti/mural touch. Sadly, that was the only thing that we enjoyed. Here we go.---Out of the 3 things we ordered, 2 was utterly garbage and unfortunately the #phoSoupDumpling was one of them. There was little to NO PHO TASTE AT ALL. The little taste that existed was COMPLETELY overwhelmed by the ginger flavor. I am so disappointed by Rice and Gold. I thought about it for a few minutes but I dare to say this is by far the WORST DUMPLING EXPERIENCE EVER. Two of the five soup dumplings were DRY. Bruh, WHERE THE SOUP GO?? It was so bad that we walked to Shanghai Manor to wash the taste out with their truffle dumplings (which is godly amazing, FYI). The shrimp and bacon shumai was not impressive at all. The cumin/ginger mustard flavor within also eliminated any chance of enjoying it. Absolutely not worth $16 Â not even worth $6 if you ask me. The one thing we ""accepted"" was the Duck Fried Rice but even then it wasn't worth $17. I've had way better for half that price. Even I can make better Â Other less important details was the fact that the bathroom is in an open hallway in the back. The only thing separating the booths in the back and the guy taking a dump, is the door for that stall. There is no door for the bathroom, and it's also unisex (not something I mind personally, but I feel bad for the customers sitting near the bathroom). The toilet is also chrome so for a moment I felt like I was in prison.---TLDR: Not worth trying, not even for the experience. The three things we ordered added up to $72 after tax and tip (18% since the waitress was nice). Speaking of which, the waitress had ""Rice and Gold"" tattooed on her forearm...

Plating and tables are set in a beautiful aesthetic as waiters and waitresses are ready to serve you. Rice & Gold is chef Dale Talde's latest establishment.

I wanted some Filipino inspired food with a twist and got the pancit palabok and the Vietnamese inspired pho xiaolong bao. It totally delivered! I was amazed at how the soup dumplings really tasted like little bursts of pho soups. As many people have said, there's not a lot of soup but the flavors were there including the topped chili pepper that gave a kick at the end. It was definitely worth the experience. For those who aren't familiar with Filipino noodles, palabok is made just like that. Although the noodles are different than traditional palabok, the presentation was well prepared and it still tasted delicious. Dale uses quail eggs instead of regular chicken eggs as well. Do not expect traditional Pinoy food which is why it cost more than the fare in Queens. If you are expecting crunchy noodles, do not order palabok! It's very moist and saucy which he does replicate with a dash of caviar, dungeness crab gravy, and chicharron. The rabbit vindaloo was an interesting dish as I never had something like it, but definitely was NOT spicy if you have a high tolerance level towards spice.

The items on the dim sum carts were nicely labeled and easy to select -- the only problem we had with this dim sum option is that these carts would disappear for 10s of minutes and were difficult to get items off of. We tried a few foods items and thought they were unique, but definitely just a one time food experience for us. So yes, I actually came here on the hunt for their pho soup dumplings, but unfortunately, they were unimpressive. Probably because 2 of the 5 dumplings did NOT have soup inside.. very sad & disappointing :'( but it happens .. of the dumplings that did have the pho broth inside, these weren't ""wow"" enough to come back to Rice & Gold.

The bite sized roast pork buns were great very flavorful and juicy as it should be. The grand finale was the Lobster fried rice, using a sticky rice as the base combined with a grilled lobster. This was a very interactive dish; there was Nori on the side that allows you to assemble a hand lobster fried rice handroll. yum!Service was excellent together with the combination of great food and design makes this a 5 STAR!",0,0,0,Jason L.,"New York, NY",4,14,10

2.0,11/20/2017,"I haven't reviewed a place in a while and this was the straw that broke the camel's back to get me back. Â My friends and I went over the weekend to try these pho soup dumplings and found the restaurant to be great in concept and really not so good in execution across the board.Starting with the pho soup dumpling: the concept was great and the dish looked pretty, but the meat was dense, there was barely any soup, the skin was way too thick and all I could taste was the anise. Â We asked for spoons and was given one silver spoon...part of serving XLB involves proper soup spoons.The cart idea for the steamed and baked dim sum is great, only if you bring the carts over to the table. Â The restaurant is in a huge space and there may have been roughly 12 tables that were filled when we were there. Â There was no reason that we had to flag you down to get the carts, where some of the dishes were way too hot and some were lukewarm (which makes no sense). Â From the carts, the shrimp toast was the only item that I liked. Â The hashbrown was also actually tasty, but it's a hashbrown (for $4, really?). Â The roast pork bun was tiny and was way overbaked. Â The PB&J sesame ball is an interesting concept, but I couldn't get passed the weirdness of it. Â  On the steam side, the lobster and bacon rice roll was way overcooked, Â the lobster and scallop har gow had no flavor and the skin was again way too thick. We also ordered the lobster egg roll, which was not well assembled. Â Even the coffee had a burn taste to it. Â We had to ask for milk three times from the server. Â Speaking of service, it really was lackluster. Â We had to ask for water refill several times. Â Several dishes didn't come with the proper utensils. Â We were asking for change to split the check and the server told us that they will come back for us later multiple times.Finally, we sat at a booth, where the bench seating was quite tight with no room for movement...I felt trapped the whole time I sat at my seat. Â I couldn't get comfortable at all. Â Don't sit in the booths if you can help it.We were so hungry afterwards that we ended up going to Lan Zhou Noodles and Dumplings a couple doors down. Â Instead of paying $18 for one dish just to pay for ambiance, we paid $18 for four dishes combined for something that was actually tasty.",2,0,1,Albert C.,"New York, NY",59,129,1

Rice & Gold is a huge trendy looking Asian fusion restaurant located on the edge of Chinatown. I went during breakfast. Half of the breakfast menu is American and other half was overpriced Asian dishes. The pho soup dumplings were great! It's topped with the usual pho fixings. It would be better if it had a little more soup in them and a little less lemon grass in the broth. They are also pricey. ~$14 for five small soup dumplings. I also tried the Arroz Caldo, which is a Filipino dish of rice porridge and chicken. This also came with a six-minute boiled egg. It was tasty.

3.0,11/18/2017,"I have to say, Rice & Gold did an amazing job with the space. It's large, with a young vibe, dim lights and loud music. There's also a bar space for expensive ($14+) cocktails if that's your preference. To the cocktails' defense, they are pretty cool and focused on the details. There's one topped with a chocolate pocky stick which I got a kick out of, and another with hibiscus (Little Pink Corvette).As a (self-proclaimed lol) asian cuisine aficionado, I cannot say they food here warrants the high prices. In general, I'm not a huge fan of asian fusion, because the food is marked up for twice the price of how much it'd cost at an authentic asian restaurant just because a western twist is incorporated into the dishes. Rice & Gold does give it it's best shot. The shumai dish was my favorite, but nothing too different from what you can get at your local dimsum spot. The duck fried rice was underwhelming. Not much duck and I thought the rice was too ""wet,"" as if they put too much water in the rice cooker when cooking the rice lol. The beef and shrimp skewer ($14) was a bit spicy, but good. The roast pork buns were decent, but at $13 I'm more than happy to go to the Chinese bakery down the block to get my fix. I have not tried the Pho Soup Dumplings, so I don't have any opinions there.In the end, I may come back for a cocktail or beer just because the space is so nice.

The lobster and scallop har gow was also pretty good although we didn't taste any scallop. Our entrees were disappointing. I got the oyster kimchi fried rice. I just didn't get it. The oysters and kimchi fried rice didn't compliment each other very well. The kimchi fried rice was very bland and not at all enjoyable. The menu mentions egg... didn't see or taste it! The GM mentioned that people either love it or hate it. I guess I'm part of the latter! Strange because I actually love both on its own. The idea is to use the lettuce as a wrap for the kimchi and rice topped with the oyster. Nope, I didn't do that. Too much effort on my end and no one explained that to me in the beginning. I'm not sure of the oysters origin but I actually wasn't a fan. My friend got the pancit palabok and she said all she tasted was oil. Meh. For dessert they gave us complimentary yogurt and fruit. Great palate cleanser. Our server was helpful, accommodating and attentive. I'm a bit torn because I really wanted to like this place. The interior is inviting and the service was spot on.

Pork shu mai with mustard: packed full or flavor but little disappointed with these. They were too spicy for my liking although I liked the mustard!6. Some meat on skewers: yummy!

As a big Top Chef fan, I had high hopes for Rice & Gold. The restaurant was a lot bigger than I was expecting. The inside is well designed. The bones are very industrial, with exposed beams and pipes and a window looking into the kitchen. There's a nice mix of street and Chinese culture threaded throughout the space. I loved the different spaces within the restaurant like the couches in the front, the communal table by the bar, and the intimate booths in the back.My friend and I decided to start with a couple of cocktails, including the Little Pink Corvette, Bondi Kelly, and the Miranda's Right. The Little Pink Corvette may be my favorite cocktail to date. It's very similar to Â strawberry flavored Milkis, a Korean yogurt soft drink. My friend really enjoyed the Bondi Beach, which tasted like pineapple punch. We both could have passed on the Miranda's Right but that's just because we're not huge whiskey fans. We sampled some dim sum dishes and a rice dish, including the shrimp & bacon shumai, crispy mapo tofu dumplings, candied pork buns, and the duck fried rice. Everything was presented very nicely and the candied pork buns were adorable!

After being wowed by the beautiful decor and greeting at the door, things went quickly downhill. This restaurant tries to emulate a clubby vibe many fusion restaurants have picked and up and fails at every single detail possible. Service: completely subpar. No waitress nor waiter could understand me nor the tables around due to the loud volume. Everything had to be repeated, or asked from a different waiter. Food brought to wrong tables, bowls being given to us when meant for the other tables, water being replaced by different type of water, checks being taken with not so much a glance to me(might as well have been snatched out of my hands). The list goes on, but you get the picture. Food: mediocre at best and definitely overpriced. The fusion aspect is a nice thought and the pairings are definitely unique, however there are farrrr better options for a quarter of the price. Nothing here wowed me nor made me want to come back for, even if I was in the neighborhood. I had the three kings pho on the coldest nyc day this winter so far. First time any soup based noodle has failed to hit the spot for me during the cold. Pho soup dumplings, not hot enough and flavorful as soup dumplings and texture similar to that of the ones I buy from the frozen food aisle.

We ordered both the 3 Kings Pho and Lobster Fried Rice. The 3 Kings Pho was with no doubt presented very appealing. However, the taste did not hold up to the other brilliant pho places in NYC. Ultimately, it was DEFINITELY NOT worth $30. Unless you like slobbering yourself in grease, don't bother with the Lobster Fried Rice. First multiple bites were deceivingly good but eventually, the excess grease started to bother my taste buds. Lets not start with our waitress.. she had us furious by the end of dinner.

The I did notice any chicharron in the dish, so the noodles lacked any crispy contrast and was just sort of goopy all over. I also was expecting a more luxurious gravy - there were no discernable crab chunks, and it didn't taste like crab at all. It was savory and salty but just not... flavorful? It also wasn't a very harmonious dish - there just wasn't enough trout roe or quail eggs or chicharron to complement the sloppy and saucy noodle dish.The lobster egg roll was also just meh. Yes, there was a lobster tail in the egg roll, but it just wasn't SPECIAL. I feel like the two dishes I had used premium ingredients in an unsophisticated way and it just didn't work for me.I liked the Miranda Right cocktail though, which is basically an old-fashioned type drink served with a stick of Pocky, which surprisingly went very well with the chocolate bitters in the drink.I would not come back here.",8,0,0,Jin C.,"New York, NY",36,1100,328

The menu is interesting and thankfully I was drawn to a handful of dishes to try my first visit at Rice & Gold. The waiter was nice but wasn't very good at selling the dishes or responding to questions so I just tried what I thought looked good based on the descriptions. Started with the pho soup dumplings. The skin was a little thick for my preference but the soup was complex and tasty. And it gets better from there.The bigger plates consisted of the GoldenÂ Chicken (breast and thigh), accompanied by stuffedÂ shishitos,Â fetaÂ stuffedÂ dates,Â persianÂ rice, and topped with a spicy sauce. This creative dish is served in a huge bowl almost the size of a wok but ceramic. Although the flavors are reminiscent of Southeast Asian/Middle Eastern influences, I've never had a dish like this, easily my favorite of the evening.Next up is the PancitÂ Palabok - a riceÂ noodle dish served with dungenessÂ crabÂ gravy,Â smokedÂ troutÂ roe,Â quailÂ egg, andÂ chicharron. This dish is great if you're craving carbs. It could've used more protein but regardless of that the dish is hearty and sauce rich of umami goodness.The relatively small LobsterÂ FriedÂ Rice dish made for a nice side dish. Lobster aside, this was a, albeit delicious, simple dish.To make sure we weren't completely devoid of veggies, got the CharredÂ Eggplant doused withÂ yogurt,Â scallion,Â crispyÂ shallot and paired perfectly with the rice.

Maybe they weren't supposed to be the same, I'm not sure.We started with the pho soup dumplings and pork sweet buns. The dumplings were ok, the meat mixture inside was a firm ball and had a weird flavor, I wouldn't order them again. The pork sweet buns were good although the kids weren't crazy about either of them.Our server recommended ordering several things and sharing them so we got the pork noodles, fried chicken rice and brussel sprouts. All of it had many, interesting flavors that worked well together, the Brussel sprouts were my favorite. All of it was too spicy for the kids so they didn't eat much but for my husband and I it wasn't hot at all. The chicken and pork we're fattier than we prefer so we didn't eat much of the meat but their flavors were good.Overall I would say it's probably not a place for kids, (I had to take them out for something else after we left) and Â it is expensive, our bill was $145, before the tip. I know this is to be expected in NY but for the portion sizes it seemed a bit much. But the ambiance is cool and the service was great, everyone was very friendly and attentive. I recommend it but leave the kids st home!",0,0,0,Jami S.,"Tampa, FL",6,36,49

3.0,10/19/2017,"I think I appreciate what Dale Talde is trying to do here - in a neighborhood that, in many people's imaginations, conjures to mind cheap hole-in-the-wall restaurants serving $5 dumplings and $10 noodles and shady roadside dealers of counterfeit designer bags, he wants to open up a place that has a more trendy and hip vibe (so that you feel like you're in Tribeca and not Chinatown), and with it a different clientele. Â Now, I love Asian food, and I'm all for creating opportunities to present the many different styles of Asian cuisine to non-Asians (or non-Asian-Americans) so that everyone can experience how totally amazing Asian food is but...is selling a $32 bowl of pho really the best way to do that? Full disclosure: my friend and I came here late one Friday night to get a few bites to eat while we were waiting for a friend to join us at the rooftop bar, so I was not here for a full meal. But we did get the chance to try the candied pork buns. An order of BBQ pork bun at a more traditional dim sum spot in Chinatown will set you back about $5-6. The candied pork buns here are $15, so of course, I expected something amazing to come out. Sadly, they turned out to be the tiniest pork buns I've ever seen (see picture for size) and definitely not worth the $15. The roasted pork on the inside was inconsistently seasoned (on the whole, too salty) and cooked - we got some pieces of pork that were super dry and chewy and other parts were quite juicy. The bun was also a disappointment - the crusty top failed to deliver on the sweetness implied by the name of the dish. On the positive side, we got to try some of the cocktails here, which were very good. Also, the servers are super friendly (though I suspect a big part of that may be that this place has only been open for less than a month and they are still trying hard to impress). I am still very curious about the $32 pho here, though probably not on my own dime.",4,1,0,Honghui Y.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",84,190,84

They returned it to the kitchen and when we realized that we were waiting for them to return it to us we asked on the status and they said that kitchen lost it and they had to make a whole new one.

3.0,10/14/2017,"I've been waiting for this place to open and it finally has! And...I'm underwhelmed. The service is AMAZING! From the hostess, to the bartenders, to the wait staff. They really are all on the ball! I was at the bar waiting for a friend to arrive for dinner and chatted up the bartender. He lit up the bar so my drink would be Instagram worthy. Then when my friend arrived and we were seated, someone ran over and handed me my headphones that I had left at the bar. Our waiter knew the menu thoroughly and was very helpful. We were also checked up on regularly by multiple people.The food however....was too salty. We had pork buns- too salty. The shrimp and bacon shumai- too salty. The lobster fried rice - tooooo saalllttyyyy. The only thing that was ok was the rib. I really really wanted to fall in love with this place based on the reviews and all the pre-opening hype (the space is huge, clean, cool bathroom, great service), but the food was covered in salt to the point where I couldn't really taste the flavor. And it wasn't cheap either. Our bill (for 2) was a little under $200 but I didn't get a ""$200 worth of food"" experience. I don't think I'll be running back anytime soon unfortunately.",4,0,1,Elizabeth J.,"Kew Gardens, NY",23,28,34

From the hostess, to the bartender, waiters, busboys, to the manager upstairs-- everyone was very accommodating and polite. Food is family style so everyone shares. We ordered the Fideos noodles, lobster fried rice, Thai fried chicken rice, beef rib, golden chicken, branzino and the sundae for dessert. We all left full and satisfied because the food was delicious. The decor is amazing and we loved the paintings on the walls which added a nice touch to our photos. We were then escorted to the rooftop that had an amazing view of the city. The manager even provided a bottle of Prosecco for my friend's birthday and sat down to engage in conversations with us.
