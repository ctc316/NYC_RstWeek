5.0,4/13/2019,Have been to the 2nd avenue location and now the 2nd time at the new location. Decided to come back to new location after a New York Ranger game (they won btw).  Service was excellent and very Attentive. We know many of the workers so it is nice to go to a place where they know you. The special which was grilled calamari was excellent. For entrees I did the cream sauce pasta special with the shiitake mushroom sauce which for me was a test as I don't care for thick cream sauces much but this was not drenched in a heavy sauce so it was great. I'm hooked in a way so take this with a grain of salt. Worth a try but for those budget conscience it is not very inexpensive. Hope this helps you. Came again 04/14/19 and it was great as usual. A must try but if you are walker conscience expect to pay for great food and service. Very worth it.,2,0,0,Miguel T.,"Trumbull, CT",21,50,20

4.0,4/13/2019,Passed the restaurant a few times during lunch time and love him as an actor and decided to give it a try. We went on a Friday night. Food was delicious.

4.0,4/12/2019,"Aesthetics! This restaurant is gorgeous. Whether it's a cozy date night, or a night out with your friends, this is the place to go! I was craving Italian food and my friend suggested Chazz. I'm in love with their atmosphere and interior. Service was top notch. I expected nothing less from a restaurant that looked like this. We had a few people tending to our table. With the constant glass top offs, clearing plates or crumbs, our staff was skillfully there without trying to make it known. They started our table off with bread and we placed our orders. I tried their baked clams, lobster ravioli, as well as their pasta with white clam sauce. The bill for those three items were about $100 with tax and tip. They have amazing Italian food. Portion size - perfect. It wasn't too much where you needed a box. All the girls at my table finished their entrees and considered themselves full. By the end of the night, we were really pleased with dinner. The restaurant was mostly empty on a Friday night but we enjoyed that we could be quiet or loud. The staff even helped us take pictures. They deserve a very positive review from my guests and I.",1,0,1,Emily T.,"Boynton Beach, FL",631,316,1265
5.0,4/7/2019,"Where can you go and meet the owner AND Forest Whitaker? My friends this is the place. I call it ""Perfection at Its Finest!""Atmosphere: 5/5 Food: 5:5We stumbled into this fine establishment, without a reservation on a Saturday night, and the found space for us. The server was phenomenal in his attentiveness and knowledge about the menu. He made us feel very welcomed and made great recommendations! The restaurant is a beautiful, elegant restaurant but it still has a ""home feel"" to it. It is very spacious with a lot of seating, and nice decorations. The food was phenomenal! I started my meal with minestrone soup that was truly authentic and flavorful. I got a chef's special pasta with a lobster tail, scallops, and clams. The sauce was so delicious and the noodles were a classic, homemade noodle. To make the night perfect, I got to meet Mr. Chazz Palminteri himself and Forest Whitaker!

3.0,3/27/2019,The place was very nice nicely appointed....although very loud...even with only a couple of tables occupied.  Service was very prompt.   I did have trouble understanding the server as he had a very heavy accent.  The food was average at best...well presented but no better than a more routine establishment...certainly not worth the price....ordered wine and it appeared they were rationing...as the portion was the smallest i think id ever seen....especially for an upscale business,0,0,0,Dorlin W.,"Pensacola, FL",5,7,0

4.0,2/20/2019,I thought that this restaurant was very good. All the food tasted fresh and all the employees were very nice. In the dining area the lighting felt romantic. Came here before a show and for the fact they partner with IHG for points. It was empty when we arrived so hard to tell how regular service would be but the restaurant started to fill up around 630.,0,0,0,Mark S.,"New York, NY",93,27,18
4.0,2/17/2019,"Came here with a friend for restaurant week-great time! I started with the carrot soup which surprised me how good it was. Light, flavorful, and not super creamy. For the main course I ordered the pesto gnocchi and I ate the entire dish- every single bite and no regrets. I got the tiramisu for desert which was good but not one of the better ones I've had and portion was small. The food came out really quickly which was good and bad because we were hungry but also wanted some time in between the courses to talk. They did stick us in a corner though and it was a bit chilly there but my friend and I stayed a couple hours after our meal and were not once rushed out.",0,0,0,Nisha S.,"Montclair, NJ",1,79,72

3.0,2/10/2019,"I got to admit, was disappointed. I had higher expectations considering the reviews and the prices. Definitely on the pricey side for Italian Food, but I'm fine with that if the food warrants it. I don't think it does. The appetizers, fried calamari, buffalo mozzarella and clams oreganata. Nothing special, average tastes, clams organata were probably sub average to tell the truth, dry and not very tasty. Main course, linguini w/clams, homemade papadelli, linguini neri w/seafood. Linguini w/clams were tasteless, had to add crushed red pepper to get anything out of it. Linguini neri w/seafood was probably the best of the 3 dishes, but multiple times cruncher on sand. Probably need to scrub the shell fish better before throwing into the dish. Again not a bad meal, just not great either especially for price and location.",0,0,0,N D.,"White Plains, NY",0,48,0
4.0,2/9/2019,"Tried this place out for Restaurant Week and overall it was a good experience. The decor and atmosphere was elegant and traditional. My friend ordered the chicken parm and I had the chicken piccata. I tried her chicken parm and it wasn't bad but I've definitely had better. The chicken piccata was very tasty! I wish the portions were a bit bigger bit again its probably because it was from the Restaurant Week menu lol yikes! If you are coming Restaurant Week its actually a good deal because you get an app, entree, and dessert for $42! We also did the special they had on their bottles of wine for $45.

5.0,2/3/2019,"This was hands down one of the best eating experiences (and especially the food) that I've had in the longest time. My husband made reservations here mostly because we love Chazz (sonny) and the Bronx Tale is one of our fave movies. To start, the service here was top notch. We had a really nice waiter who was very accommodating and paying close attention to us if we needed anything, whether it was a refill of our water, a pour of the wine or to clear plates. Attention to detail was really on point here. We ordered so much food it was actually really embarrassing but we couldn't decide what app we wanted so we got an order of the burratta special and a shrimp with a cream sauce over crispy bread. The burratta was over watermelon and it was so delicious. The shrimp app had the best sauce on top of it. We ate every bit of it and we're dipping more bread in the sauce. My husband ordered the filet mignon and I ordered a seafood over spinach linguini special. It was similar to a zuppa dipesche and had scallops, shrimp, lobster and clams on top. The dish was excellent. My husband let me try some of his steak and OMG it was to die for! Highly recommend both dishes for dinner. Then we just had to order the creme brûlée. Again, it was awesome. We finished the whole thing. Then they brought out a tiramisu dessert because they overheard us talking about how we were there for my bday (my bday was back in October but this was a gift for my bday) and so of course we had to eat that as well. The cake was so good also. Leaving here we were so full and satisfied. The place is expensive but worth every penny. As I said earlier this was some of the best food I've had in a long time and I hope to come back here some day soon.",12,4,8,Megan E.,"West Orange, NJ",299,229,127
4.0,1/30/2019,"If you want an authentic Italian food experience this is it . The decor is warm and cozy, definitely not loud but service could have been a tad less aggressive that said. I had to order my all time favorite the broccoli we had two sides of Broccoli Rabe and the fresh Pollo Francese ( lemon chicken). The Broccoli Rabe was cooked perfectly tangy bitter veggie soooo good for the body and soul - goes well together with the chicken (garlic & lemon) and balanced with a bottle of Chuck Hill... we did not have room for dessert but next time TY",0,0,1,Bette J.,"New York, NY",15,46,1
2.0,1/28/2019,"Really did not like the service here - the waiters are constantly rushing you. They give you very little time per course by showing up to ask if you're done, already reaching to take your plate before you can answer, and this is when our plates were still half full. They also switched 3 different waiters on us so they would forget things such as our wine order.The food was edible but very underwhelming - my steak was undercooked yet somehow still tough to chew and the sauce was too salty. My friend's calamari pasta tasted like the kind you buy in store and microwave.",2,0,1,Jenny Z.,"Manhattan, NY",405,4,0
5.0,1/27/2019,"My fiancé and I ate here before heading to an evening showing of Network. The restaurant is extremely clean and discerningly decorated. The menu offers a lot of wonderful Italian options. We started with the spicy calamari appetizer which was delicious and fresh. I went with a special dish for my entree: spinach fettuccini with shellfish in diavolo sauce. Everything was fresh, perfectly seasoned, and delicious. My fiancé ordered the filet mignon with mashed potatoes. The filet was perfectly cooked and seasoned, as were the potatoes. Our waiter, Aulon, was also wonderful.

5.0,1/9/2019,"My daughters and I were in NYC for a Broadway show, stayed at the Cambria.  We decided to dine here one night - pleasantly surprised, although I should not have been because I am well aware of Chaz Palminteri's reputation for doing everything top-notch. (Excuse my crassness but I think the man must piss excellence!)For the table, we ordered the mozzarella with tomato and vinaigrette.  Lovely presentation and delicious! The bread came out warm and fresh! Heavenly!I had the lobster bisque (EXCELLENT) and the Cesar salad (with arugula because the romaine scare is still in effect, and I appreciated the option).  My daughters ordered the spinach fettuccine with alfredo sauce (fabulous) and the rigatoni with rosetta (also terrific).  Service was excellent.  Very pleasant atmosphere, as well!  Prices are as expected for NYC.I very much enjoyed our evening here.  I hope we can go back next time we are in NYC.",2,0,0,Phila M.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,27,0
5.0,1/1/2019,"My girlfriend and I went here for the first time on December 30, 2018, we had 4:30 reservations and because of traffic and the parking lot next to the restaurant we were late.  We called the restaurant twice and the person who answered the phone could not have been more accommodating. When we arrived at 5 o'clock they quickly sat us and we explained that we had 630 theater tickets, our very polite and friendly waiter assured us we would be out in less than an hour and we were! I was very impressed that the staff worked as a team to make sure that our order was placed quickly and we received our food very timely. I had the buffalo mozzarella my girlfriend had the eggplant mellenzane both were exceptional and the presentation was absolutely beautiful. My girlfriend had the Rolatine di Pollo, I had the rigatoni with broccoli rabe in the pink sauce, both were absolutely delicious and once again presented beautifully. I love the wine list, lots of great choices for wine by the glass since my girlfriend drinks white and I drink red. I cannot wait to go back to this beautiful, elegant  and exceptionally well run restaurant! My only two very slight critiques would be, our dessert was good not great, we ordered an apple strudel with vanilla ice cream and fresh berries, the ice cream and the fruit were delicious and very fresh, the apples were a little undercooked and dough a little rubbery but it was still a good dessert.   The other very slight critique was the music playing in the restaurant, while I love bands like Staind and Train, I would have envisioned Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett or Bocheli, but that's probably just my personal preference.",0,0,0,Greg M.,"Clifton, NJ",86,104,2
1.0,12/28/2018,"Let's start out with the fact that I was greeted by a well dressed man in a tux no less. Ultimate in class however after being seated in the ""walk-in section next to the door I began to question me choice. Continuing on to the bathroom situation where I had to utilize the neighboring hotel's bathroom (not a hotel restaurant) which took a grand total of 15 minutes, we sat to order dinner. The menu is concise and can be changed to whatever you like according to the waitress I tried a off menu mushroom risotto, which came not al-dente but crunchy, after sending back a $30 entree they proceeded to re-fire a risotto...I'm not gonna ask how you refire a already garnished dish but they did. After receiving the well overdone risotto with still undercooked crunchy bits I was asked to get something else by my server. Which I obliged now 1.5 hours into my meal with my co diner who had finished a while ago. I then order pasta and some vodka sauce and sausage which is what my counterpart had. This came out in a glorious 45 minutes later and well under cooked with less than a tablespoon of sausage. The total bill for a thrice sent back entree and a few drinks $149.59 plus tip. The best part of this meal was the restock. Don't waste time or money.",0,0,0,Chris M.,"Lafayette, LA",79,3,1
2.0,12/25/2018,"The restaurant looks nice and the food is okay. Those are the only positives. The staff were largely indifferent and provided mediocre service. Although our water was refilled, the staff was overall not attentive (e.g. our dishes weren't cleared for about ten minutes despite being empty and thus clearly done) nor friendly. The two tables next to us seemed to receive marginally better service for some reason. They were more dressed up than we were but we certainly weren't sloppy or poorly dressed (and even if we were, it's no excuse for poor service). The food was nothing special and not worth the price. It wasn't awful but it wasn't anything to write home about. Hence why it receives two stars instead of one. The tables against the wall were too close together. You could easily hear people next to you. I found a hair in the napkin but didn't bother to tell anyone. Biggest complaint? They didn't give us all of our change. They kept about $10.45. We considered that their tip and didn't leave anymore.

5.0,12/17/2018,"No pictures because our table of two was snug in a corner and I didn't want to elbow the people next to me or be obnoxious. Service was extremely attentive. Our wine glasses were topped off before I even knew I was ready. I had the pappardelle Bolognese which was spectacular and way more food than I could eat. My SO had the rigatoni which was also yummy (I stole a few bites). Due to the romaine issues no cesar salad so I opted for the spinach salad with pears and bacon dressing, not my normal choice but I loved the salad. Dessert was tiramisu which was delightful and a stronger coffee taste than you normally get (which I prefer). The only cons are it got a little loud in there once all of the tables were full and some tables were a tight squeeze (but that's just NY). I would recommend if you're looking for Italian.",0,0,0,Karissa D.,"Columbus, OH",7,61,56
5.0,12/16/2018,My husband and I had reservations in a neighboring restaurant on Thursday night. We walked in and they were so rude and the burning brick oven smell made us run out. We walked across to Chazz restaurant and asked if they had a table even though we didn't have a reservation. They were very accommodating and gave us a table. From the beginning I knew this was going to be a good experience. The waitress was very friendly; we were never rushed and the food was phenomenal. The half bottle wine list was pricey but we were able to overlook this because everything else was perfect!!

5.0,12/13/2018,"Usually when a restaurant contains the name of a celebrity it leaves a lot to be desired, not so with Chazz Palminteri, this place exceeded my expectations big time. First, the restaurant is great looking and then everything gets better. The service is very concerned and very responsive. The real home run is the menu, it has something for any taste, but there's no denying it's Italian. Everything that we ordered was cooked to perfection. And the finishing touch was some great desserts. This is a go to place that I look forward to returning to soon. Last night my wife and I returned to Chazz Palminteri's after attending an theater matinee. After being seated, I showed the maitre d my review and the response that I received, he gave me a cursory nod. Shame on me for expecting a little more enthusiasm. So much for that.

Not many that's for sure and for that reason I kept my expectations in check. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the restaurant was. The dining room itself is simple with tables nicely spaced from one another. Service was good but not great and that could be because we got there late at the end of the day. However our server steered us to a few specials which we loved.

We were very pleasantly greeted by the hostess who showed us directly to a table.The restaurant is very richly stated and my wife and I were very pleased.Our server Besrik greeted us next and asked if we wanted sparkling, still or tap water to which I ordered a bottle of San Pellegrino. We also ordered our cocktails which were a Negroni for my wife and a Heineken for me.We then received a basket of fantastic Italian Bread (crispy outside crust soft inside) with olive oil with garlic for dipping. Besrik then told us about their specials of the day which wanted one of each as my glands started to salivate.My wife decided to go for the Pre Fix Lunch which is an appetizer, entrée and dessert for $ 29.95. A super great value for the portion size and food quality. She chose the Insalate Bufala App, Calamari Sicilliana Entrée and Ricotta Cheesecake.  I chose the Polpo Griglia for my app. It was the single best grilled octopus I've ever eaten. It was four perfectly grill tentacles over finely diced broccoli di rapa. For my entrée I chose the Osso Buco special (one of my all-time favorite meals.) over Risotto. A huge veal shank with meat so tender I did not need a knife. It melted in my mouth!My wife had a coffee with her cheesecake which I tasted and it was fantastic. I went with a cappuccino and Bailey's straight up.I can't say enough about the total experience. It was fabulous from the moment we walked through the door. You can't ask for a better server than Besrik! He is truly an asset to the restaurant. This was our first time here but I guarantee it will not be our last.

When i opened the menu i was amazed, as an Sicilian i recognized so many dishes my mom used to make. I tried Linguini nero.. Such an amazing dish. The wine list is just impressive!  I will have to come back again. I recommend this place to everyone who loves and knows italian food.. The way i do. Everything was just perfect.

3.0,9/2/2018,Dined at Palmenteri this  evening. The food if you have a yen for Southern Italian is pricey but well above average. Service prompt and professional and surprisingly the place was crowded for Manhattan on Labor Day weekend. Since all the glitteratti had decamped for the Hamptons the crowd was a mixture of noisy tourists and inhabitants of the adjacent hotel. Although  I do not feel that atmosphere is critical however there is no ambiance here. The restaurant is conveniently located at the edge of the theater district and is worth a shot for apres or post theater. But I can only give it three stars because of the foregoing.,1,1,1,Norman R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,26,0

Maybe our server was having a bad day, but she didn't seem very happy about our presence and was very brusque; so that was uncomfortable. It was not crowded, so I'm not sure why she was so unwelcoming.

All were very good, the calamari were tender and served with a spicy marinara sauce.  For the entrees we had the Tilapia Livornese and the Vitello Di Bianca.  I really enjoyed the veal, however, it was served luke warm and the mashed potatoes were actually cold it also came with some julienne string beans.  I happen to like my food piping hot, so this was a little disappointing to me.  For the dessert 2 of us had the Italian cheesecake and the other, the gelato.  The cheesecake was superb, however it was such a skinny sliver, not a wedge how cheesecake is usually served, but a sliver so thin, that I had to scrape it off the dish to eat it, leaving me wanting more, much more.  I found that all he portions were on the smaller side and I'm sure it was because it was a  restaurant week menu,  which is a huge let down,  because it is not such a bargain anymore when you are still left a little hungry.",2,1,0,Jo Ann C.,"Franklin Square, NY",0,49,0

When we finally got seated, 40 minutes AFTER our reservation time, then the service was decent.  They forgot one order of wine, and ran out of another one only after we ordered one glass. The manager gave us a free dessert. Food was good, but definitely not what I expected from a 5 star restaurant. Very disappointed.",1,0,0,Agnes L.,"Queens, NY",0,12,0
1.0,12/6/2017,"The worst dining experience I've ever had in my life.  We had an 8pm reservation on Saturday 12/2.  We weren't seated until 8:45.  The hostess couldn't explain what the problem was (or give us an ETA), and then she told us our table up front would be ready as soon as the party that was sitting there left.  That group, meanwhile, was anxiously and obviously waiting to pay for at least 20 minutes.  We felt like we had to wait because we were a party of 6 in NYC on Saturday night (including 3 kids).Our first food came out at 9:45, which made us lucky - another party stormed out just before our food came out because they had waited over an hour to be sat and then had waited over an hour and a half and still had no food.  The food was NOT worth the wait - tomato sauce tasted like a combination of Ragu plus Campbell's Tomato soup, and much of our food was cold.  It was clear that this place does NOT have ""logistics"" and ""management"" down - they couldn't turn over tables because they were either understaffed or not staffed with the right people.  I would not go back to this restaurant if they paid me.  Save your time and frustration and book somewhere else.  They don't even deserve the 1 star.",4,4,0,Courteney M.,"Boston, MA",24,46,0

We arrived and the Hostess seemed very confused when we said we had reservations for 12:30. She stammered then hastily sat us a a tiny table for two in the bar as if we were a bother to her. There was so little room that our drinks and appetizers couldn't fit causing our lovely waiter to have to juggle. Our food runner noticed how cramped things were and we said we would like to sit in the main dining area,as we saw other parties of 2 happily being shown to their tables and our table in the bar was simply too small to comfortably have a meal at. We were offered two tables be put together by the Manager and  we politely declined. At this point we who were of course nicely dressed began wondering why we were not initially or upon our  request seated in the dining room, it made no sense and We were made to feel unwelcome.  We were finally seated where we should have been, in the dining room, not a table in the bar large enough for cocktails only, not plates.  The cold treatment by the Hostess , along with having to ask twice to be seated in the dining room put a damper on our meals so I can't fairly at this time review the food.  This was not the dining experience we expected and we have no desire to return after being treated in such a manner.",2,0,0,Robin M.,"Ocean Grove, NJ",0,24,0

Regardless, I noticed all four transactions the next day and called to confirm they had voided the charges and the manager knew exactly who I was as I imagine they had anticipated this call. Accidents happen but it's a little unbelievable the waiter would fail to mention this? The manager apologized but was almost dismissive when explaining they voided them as if this meant they didn't happen or no explanation should have been necessary.

1.0,8/2/2017,"I've never been so disappointed with Italian food. Seriously, it's one of my top three cuisines I cannot live without so imagine how saddened I was after dining here. I don't even want to discuss how we had to wait for a table despite having reservations so let's just dive into how upsetting the Restaurant Week meal was.Pappardelle with ragout - I stuck my fork into one piece of the pasta and it ripped thru to the end of its wide strip, indicating how soft it is. When I witnessed this, my immediate thought was, ""This is not al dente. This cannot be a good meal if they manage to mess up pasta."" And I was right...Red snapper - Tasted fishy, in a not so good way, as in I hope I won't get sick tonight. It was off, it was chewy, it was suspicious. I'm really hoping the fish doesn't make a reappearance tonight.Tiramisu - a 1.5""x1.5"" cube of a dessert, mainly here since it's necessary to offer a dessert at the end of a meal but it was such a disappointing dish that they might as well not serve it. Why is the serving in the size and shape of an ice cube? Cutting costs, maybe. An indication that the chef don't care about food however is highly likely.The whole thing at most costs $25 per person, and that's being super generous, with gratuity.

The main door leaves you on a level with stairs that do not allow wheelchairs to pass, however, the middle door has a more spacious layout where a wheelchair can easily roll in and out of. The restroom has its own set of stairs so that's not wheelchair accessible at all.Regardless we decided to dine here since my dad is a huge fan of Chazz. The service from start to finish was impeccable. The manager was beyond nice and allowed us to take our time and sit and talk before they switched over to dinner service. They constantly refilled our drinks but made sure to leave us alone while we were eating.They start each meal with bread and olive oil. The bread was just okay but that's not really what you come here for, anyway. I ordered the chicken rollatini which was delicious! The mashed potatoes on the side were also a hit. Dad ordered a penne dish which he couldn't stop raving about. For dessert I wanted creme brulee but they were out (whomp whomp) so I got the panna cotta instead. The panna cotta was delicious and served with a fluffy homemade whipped cream. Two meals with beer, soda, and dessert came out to $100. Not terrible considering the amount of food you get and how good it tastes. Usually I'm wary of a celebrity-owned restaurant but Chazz hit the nail on the head with this one.

3.0,3/12/2017,"Chazz Palminreri Ristorante has absolutely fantastic upscale Italian food, chaotic unskilled service, and is very nice place to dine (just to say you've been there).Service: Outside of the highly professional host and captains, the waiters seem to be disorganized. Several seemed to have just received their apron and order pads the night we visited. They knew nothing of the evening's specials, a particular dish's components, the price points, or the selections on the wine lists. Example: in the first 10 minutes, three different waiters asked if we wanted bottled water or tap water? How about a drink?The wine list at Chazz's has great depth and variety. It is superior. You will quickly determine how a lot of skill went into building a dynamic list  of wines from Italy and around the globe. However, our (unskilled) waiter comes to our table with a bottle of wine that was completely opposite of what we ordered - and then had the nerve to doubt you right in front of your guests. After looking up the wine's (bin) number in front of you, he simply walks away in silence when HIS gaffe is self-confirmed. (Forget the wine for now young man, just get us another round of drinks!)Food: The grilled octopus hits big on all flavor points - you won't find better anywhere in this city. The short rib and pasta special was amazing, as well as the veal ragout. Ordinary dishes such as the chicken or veal parm were very good and beyond expectation. Highest praise goes to the chefs at Chazz!I'd venture that one can probably find the same meal at Patsy's, Joey G's or Angelo's - albeit with much less ambiance. But, go check out Chazz's ... just because it's Chazz's! Again, amazing food with inattentive service. However, maybe you'll do better than us when you go.

IG clump of noodles and sauce... stuck together, and obviously dried out under a heat-lamp.  It was a joke just trying to twirl the pasta onto my fork.  In addition to the lousy pasta... the clams were placed around the perimeter of the plate - and were obviously cooked/steamed separately from the sauce, because they had no flavor of the sauce - and the sauce had no flavor of the clams.(The Final Moments)After we were both done... and obviously not engaging in eating any longer,  the wait staff had NO CLUE of social cues - and just kept walking by us, without ANY engagement.  It wasn't until 15 minutes later, when I had to signal for the check, did they approach and ask if we wanted dessert or our food wrapped to go.I truly was disappointed in this experience and felt that Olive Garden could've cooked a better dish and a more engaging experience.",4,2,0,Danny R.,"Brooklyn, NY",73,8,1

5.0,1/21/2017,"Let me start by telling you that, normally, I would avoid any place associated with a celebrity like the plague.  (And this is in spite of the fact that I really like Chazz Palminteri.  I just figure it's probably a tourist trap if a celebrity name is attached to it.)  But someone recommended this to a friend and he made a reservation and, what the hell, I'm game.  I was quite pleasantly surprised.  The place is absolutely charming.  It's light enough for you to see your food but dim enough to be a good place to have a romantic date.  The restaurant is on more than one level which added to the ambience and has a wonderful, warm, understated elegant feel to it.   Even the bar area looked like a nice place to stop in for a drink.  The food did not disappoint.  I had a salad with artichokes and arugula that was easily big enough for two.  The duck ravioli was a bit on the sweet side (think almost an Asian taste although it was cassis that added to the sweetness) but the duck was delicious (and the sauce was perfect for duck) and the ravioli tasted homemade and were nice and al dente.  I thought it was delicious.  I was actually too full for dessert but I noticed they had two of my favorites....zabaglioni and millefoglie so I had to taste one.  I went with the millefoglie and the pastry was so light and flaky, just as it should be, and the cream was rich but at the same time not too heavy.   I also noticed that they offered fresh fruit and sorbets which I prefer once summer comes.  Most important, as I have gotten VERY fussy about service these days, our waiter Matt was attentive without being pushy or obnoxious.  Trust me, it can be a fine line between being there when needed and being annoying. Also, the waiters all seem to pitch in.   To sum it up, I loved the place.  If it was walking distance instead of a cab ride away I'd be there more often.  (hard to get the hubby out of ten block radius....NYC has so many good restaurants)  As it is, we will be back and I think it's a fantastic place for special occasions and romantic nights. Not at all a tourist trap.  I would recommend it. I love the elegant feel but, at the same time, business casual is fine.Addendum as of Feb 2017 --  ate here again last night and it was even better than the first time.  The only thing that's stopping me from coming here more is Second Ave traffic.  Had two specials, crab and avocado salad and a homemade fettuccine with lobster and clams and shrimp in a brandy sauce.  I am adding to this review just to tell you that both were EXCELLENT.   Lots of shrimp and about a half dozen clams.  The lobster was small but tender (not rubbery) and cleaned out of the shell for you but presented with the shell.  (presentation is important) The olive bread and herbed oil were delicious, the specials were reasonably priced for NYC (if you're from out of town the key phrase in that is ""NYC"" -- and that means Manhattan) and the service is great.  Place is nice.  Try it.",12,1,2,Tina P.,"Manhattan, NY",20,53,0

1.0,8/26/2016,"came here with some friends for dinner last friday night.  we ordered 2 pasta dishes papardelle bolognese and carbonara, and the bronx tail.  pasta dishes were good, pasta was cooked well.  both had too much sauce though, especially the carbonara.  then comes the big issue.  like others have said, the lobster tail was huge.  looked ok, when i first chewed, but didnt taste like lobster at all.  tasted more like fish.  looking back, overcooked lobster should be more rubbery, but this was almost flaky.  then my friend said immediately after taking the first bite that it tasted like ammonia.  i took another bite, and still didnt taste ammonia, but it tasted like flavorless fish.  i then finally took a third bite of the lobster, and i think b/c i inhaled while chewing or had my mouth open for a sec, i finally got the overwhelming taste of ammonia.  after this, i totally lost my appetite.  my friend alerted the maitre'd, who was nice, but explained that this is common and blamed it on the food provider.  it's fine if they do this, but the restaurant should at least try changing their supplier or at least try washing the lobster with water.  he immediately took it away and took it off our bill, which was the least he could do.  after this, our dinner was pretty much done since everyone lost their appetite.  good thing we had the pastas first.  didnt even get to try the other seafood on the plate like the oysters or clams, but probably good we didnt try them.so after taking the item off our bill, which is the bare minimum of what should have been done, the waiter asks us for dessert and asks us how the lobster was.  either there is no communication or seemed like they were mocking us.  no offer of even giving us a menu to see if we wanted to order something else.  didnt even really check up on us again, they kinda glossed over the fact and probably hoped we kept it quiet while at the restaurant.  the fact that mgmt didnt respond to other bad reviews here shows they just dont care and definitely do not deserve a 4 star rating.  something fishy is going on with the reviews/yelp/stars.only good thing are the price of the whiskys, some of them are low for manhattan prices, but i wouldnt recommend coming here even for a drink",3,0,0,Deel ..,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0

1.0,8/22/2016,"STAY AWAY. DANGER. SPOILED, AMMONIA LACED FOOD.  I made the unfortunate decision of picking Chazz Palminteri Ristorance Italiano for dinner last Friday evening.  We were a party of 3 and expected, at worst, mediocre Italian food likely not cooked by anyone related to Italy. This would be have been fine and completely within reasonable expectations given the location and ""celebrity"" status of the restaurant's namesake.  We ordered 2 pastas and 2 entrees for the 3 of us to share.  The pastas were served first and were mediocre but edible- the kind of food that if hungry enough you wouldn't mind.  The next course is where disaster struck. If you find yourself in this place for some reason, DO NOT ORDER A BRONX TALE.  With an entree named after the only reason your would ever really stumble in to this place, you feel compelled to order it.  A Bronx Tale contains a dinosaur size lobster tail with a bunch of other seafood surrounding it.  After one bite of the lobster tail a taste of ammonia spread through our mouths and throat.  The ""lobster"" was either incredibly spoiled or cooked in ammonia.  I use the term ""lobster"" loosely here as I have no idea what they really served us.  When we told the manager something was wrong with this entree he matter-of-factly told us that yes, the market they buy seafood from sprays their food with chemicals to keep flies away and sometimes this occurs.  He had the attitude that this wasn't the restaurant's fault but rather the luck of the draw.  He took the entree off our bill  as one would expect but offered nothing further to us, not even a genuine apology.  Under any other circumstance they would have heard more from us that evening, but we were all genuinely terrified after taking that bite that we wanted nothing else but to leave this place as quickly as possible.  I rarely write reviews but feel the public needs to be warned about this place.  This is a genuine health concern that needs to be looked at further by the appropriate people.  I can only speak to this experience, but I am sure given what we experienced they are not buying their meats, seafood or vegetables from reputable vendors.  I implore you to stay away and visit one of the hundreds of quality restaurants in this city.",5,3,1,Neal C.,"New York, NY",4,7,0

I called just to tell them, so they would be careful with such a simple order - the hostess picked up and cut me off in the middle of my explanation, transferring me to the waiter, who then hung up.

Decor is warm and cozy, it's not too loud..tables are spaced nicely. I read reviews about the servers not being Italian (they're from Albania) but who cares..they know that menu like the back of their hand and they take care of you and that's what's important. The food was great...service was great..we'll be back!",0,0,0,Jessica R.,"Shirley, NY",1,21,8

2.0,3/19/2016,"My Manhattan drink was not properly chilled so tasted as if not enough ice was used.  My clams pasta (appetizer portion) was very good.  Was vastly underwhelmed by my chicken parmigiana entree.  Half of it felt room temperature while the sauce on it was awful.  A good Italian restaurant needs solid sauce and this place failed.   The quality of cheese on the chicken parm was unimpressive and should have baked longer.   The broccoli rabe side dish came half warm and half cold.  This is not what I expected from Chaz and company.   I did enjoy the service though.  But unless the food and bartending improves,  I won't be returning.",1,3,1,Matt Y.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0
4.0,3/10/2016,"VERY OLD NEW YORK FEEL...Went for dinner to celebrate selling the family hotel and we were more than pleased.  We were a party of 5 and we all had a great meal. Our Albanian waiter was very attentive and took his job very  seriously. the table tried to make him laugh a little to loosen him up (it didn't work LOL). He was super polite  and so were the other gentlemen. the ambiance is very cozy, romantic and intimate. because of the low lighting you feel that you have the restaurant to yourself.Minus 1 star because the wait staff came over too many times to offer to pour the sparkling water and the bottle of wine interrupting the conversations. They were constantly around. I like attention but not to be distracted. Also, the Branzino I ate had bones, ewwwwww.",0,1,0,Maria L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,13,8
5.0,2/3/2016,I cannot say enough nice things about this restaurant. Definitely go here if you want an authentic Italian experience. Not only was the food we ate incredible but the service was outstanding. Our server was so attentive to all of our requests and knowledgable about all of the food. I will be going back here again and again for sure!,1,0,1,Courtney M.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",0,1,0
4.0,1/23/2016,"It is the middle of a blizzard but boyfriend wanted date night anyway.  We both were craving steak.  We made a ressie on open table at Matisse to brave the sideways falling snow only to discover that it was closed.  Guess they forgot to inform open table.  We stared walking back to our apartment to discover this gem that was open.  Yes it is dark inside.  Yes you might need some help to read the menu.  But this place is cozy, sexy and romantic.  It was the perfect hideaway for our snowy evening.  We decided to order the rib eye and the oso bucco.  The pasta sounded delicious but I have pasta skills in the kitchen and their pasta is expensive.  Better to spend a bit more for the main courses.  We split the octopus with broccoli rabe.  My rib eye was cooked perfectly.  It was thick, juicy, yummy fat, perfectly pink and crispy on the outside.  The staff was attentive and very funny.  Very happy to have discovered this new date night spit in the neighborhood   We will be back",3,0,1,Alexandra P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,18,4
1.0,1/19/2016,"I had lunch here last week with a friend and she used to go here a lot. She was telling me about the great pizza they had, but the great pizza's are gone. It is now supposed to be a much more fancy restaurant, but I am not feeling it. The dinner meals are all overpriced, the fix price lunch was still ok with decent choices, but dont change the coffee into a cappuccino because you will end up with +$5.5 and nobody tells you up front. Also a bottle of water goes for 10 bucks which I find crazy. I do have to say that the food was not bad I had buffalo mozzarella as a starter, which was very good, calamari pasta as entree, was ok, and tiramisu as dessert, not that great. Worst thing I find the service, the waiters are not attentive, they do not speak nicely (we asked if there was any pizza and the only word in reply was ""No""), and they speak in a different language to each other throughout the restaurant (not Italian), what happened to the Italian waiters?!. Definitely not worth it.",2,5,1,Marieke S.,"New York, NY",0,7,0
5.0,1/9/2016,"We decided to try this relatively new restaurant and are very glad we did. The food is excellent, as are the salads and specials . Wines are quite good and the staff is very helpful and friendly. Ambiance is quite nice too. It's quiet with wood paneling that adds to the romantic atmosphere. We are  looking forward to going back soon.",1,0,0,Charles J.,"New York, NY",0,8,0
5.0,12/28/2015,"I had dinner here with my Dad and my wife, and we loved it. The service was phenomenal, the food was great (all except my wife didn't love her mushroom ravioli).  For appetizers we had asparagus, shrimp cocktail, and baked clams. I had chicken parm for entree and my dad had the red snapper special. We enjoyed it all. Best part of the night though was when Chazz came over, shook our hands, and talked to us for a minute. Very cool stuff. Will definitely be back.",1,0,1,Chris C.,"New York, NY",9,30,7
2.0,12/12/2015,"The place is dark. At the door all patrons should be given mining hats so you can see. I ordered one of the special appetizers which was described as a salad. What I got was a glob of cheese on a plate with 2 leaves on it. Not a salad. I couldn't read the menu, it was so dark. Eventually I picked out a pasta dish that was to have broccoli rabe and sausage in it When it came I thought it was fettuccine bolognese. It had a red sauce, a lot of sausage and maybe a few twigs of regular broccoli (not broccoli rabe). I'm not going back. Just because it has a celebrity's name on it doesn't make it good. The only reason I gave it 2 stars rather than one was because the service was impeccable.",4,4,1,Marty E.,"Brooklyn, NY",45,17,2

They were so attentive, and knew the menu cold.we had amazing egg plant and fresh Mozz app, and had some great pasta and chicken entries.We will be back soon, we were ver impressed.Go say hi to Chazz..........",1,0,2,Todd K.,"Armonk, NY",129,47,106
2.0,11/20/2015,Been to this restaurant twice now. The food is decent but they have a tendency to leave out ingredients mentioned on the menu. So you may not get what you had in mind. The service should be great given the number of staff they have but instead all the servers can't wait to take away your plates. Go there if you must but pray they bring back Cafe Linda!,3,3,2,Varda C.,"New York, NY",126,3,0
1.0,11/9/2015,"This is a first for me, I've never written a bad review either on yelp or opentable. However, my experience here was exceptionally bad.  I would give it less than one star but that's as low as you can go on yelp.  In fairness to the restaurant, I'm going to assume that a lot of it had to do with the start up and an exceptionally poorly trained waiter.My wife and I were regulars at Nino's, the restaurant which previously occupied this space and dined there 3 to 4 times per month and ordered takeout about the same number of times per month. So we were excited to see that a new restaurant was opening in that space. The new owners seem to have changed nothing about the decor which was fine with us. What they did change, the food and the service, was a disappointment.We were served by two waiters one seemed very friendly and knowledgeable and the other clueless. Unfortunately for us the majority of our service was provided by clueless.  The specials were described to us in two different ways. I ordered the crispy duck and my wife ordered the lobster over spinach linguine. Both dishes were inedible. I tried with the duck but gave up after a few bites. My wife, said the both the lobster and the linguine were overcooked and also gave up after a few bites.  I asked if I could switch the mashed potatoes for polenta I was told NO SUBSTITUTIONS  so I asked for a side of polenta and to not bring the mashed potatoes (I don't like to waste food).  The side of polenta was the best part of the meal but at a cost of $15.00 not worth it and the mashed potatoes were on the plate.  I then asked for a doggie bag for the duck but not the mashed potatoes (the dog doesn't like mashed potatoes either).  When I arrived home I discovered that the waiter had included the duck and the mashed potatoes.  I am not joking but the dog, which eats practically anything, will not eat the duck from this restaurant.On the way out I mentioned that our waiter didn't seem to know a lot about the menu and i was told that it was only his second day and would probably be his last to which i responded that i thought would be a very good thing.  I am willing to go back to give them a second chance to make a good first impression but my wife will not step in the place again.",8,6,2,Able G.,"Poughquag, NY",0,5,0

5.0,11/7/2015,"I really enjoyed our dinner last night.  The restaurant was beautifully decorated and the staff was super nice and certainly competent.  Excellent wine list!  Oysters were super fresh,  salads were delicious,  fried calamari was light and non greasy.  Best appetizer by far was the baby artichoke app.  DELISH!  4 dinners consisting of surf & turf,  chicken and 2 chilean sea bass dinners prepared differently,  were nothing short of spectacular.  Of course the highlight was Mr. Palminteri himself and some friends having dinner a table over.  Not wanting to be an annoying fan - I simply admired from afar.    Go after 7 and there is decent amount of street parking as well as a lot right next door.  Go,  you won't regret it.",1,1,0,Angel J.,"Colts Neck, NJ",9,68,1
2.0,11/4/2015,"While the ambiance is nice and the staff friendly that's the only nice things I can say. We had 3 main courses linguine lobster special, veal scaloppine and salmon. The salmon was the only edible dish. The lobster was over cooked and tough. The veal was show leather. We ordered tea and it did not come in a pot but just the cup. Refills meant a second cup using the same tea bag. We asked for and got biscotti but you could've broken a tooth. One person drank all their water and the other 2 were half emptied and in 90 minutes they were never refilled.",8,3,0,Phillis W.,"East Brunswick, NJ",101,26,4
