5.0,4/29/2019,"Had an AMAZING meal here with a friend while staying at the Moxy. I went in not knowing what to expect as you never quite know what you are getting at some ""hotel"" restaurants. First of all, you do not feel like your in a hotel restaurant in this space. Its beautful and very well done. The staff was incredible and very nice.I had a few glasses of wine and we split tons of things off the menu. Every single dish was delicious including the buttered rolls they bring to the table. Nothing beats fresh baked rolls. We then shared some delicious oysters and little necks from the raw bar. We then indulged in a delicious grilled baby octopus appetizer from the daily specials. Wow! This was so tender and flavorful and something they are looking to add to the new menu.For our main courses, I got the Fried Chicken Box. INCREDIBLE absolutely delicious! It comes with a freshly baked bisquit and hot honey to drizzle all over that shit. Finger licken good! The chicken was crispy, hot and so so flavorful. I drizzled each piece with hot sauce and hot honey and couldnt be happier. My friend got the grilled scallops and absolutely loved them.We split some sides and ended up with the German Butterball Potatoes with chives and truffle butter and the Mac & Cheese with Gouda and White Cheddar... Both 5 stars and as good as it gets. So so flavorful.Thank you for an incredible meal. I will definately remember this one for a while!",4,1,4,Michael P.,"Providence, RI",1195,457,1606
3.0,4/28/2019,"Dinner Saturday evening at trendy ""Legasea"" in the Moxy Hotel with an Opentable reservation. Lord, is this restaurant ""trendy"". I swear, I felt like I was sitting at a pre Oscar night dinner and after dinner I would give my parking ticket to the valet and drive off onto La Cienega Boulevard in West Hollywood. Anybody who is  somebody was dining here! It was nice that ""mere mortals"" like me could dine amongst the rich and famous. Atmosphere was ""electric"". Service could best be described as ""Business Class Flight Attendant"".  Food was all over the place. They reduced the number of items on their menu so the things I had planned to order based on their online menus were no longer offered. Real bummer. For example, I really wanted the Lemoncello sorbet for dessert but the waitress said it was no longer served and rattled off several sorbets/gelattos that I had no interest in. After ordering, we received two rolls with sides of herbal butter, coleslaw and bread and butter pickles to put on/in them. The rolls were ok, butter was ok, pickles were fantastic, coleslaw was awful. Our shared appetizer (shared because the appetizer I had wanted from their online menu was no longer available and I didn't see anything that interested me) was the Crab Beignets. This is the restaurants signature appetizer. Not sure why. They aren't really beignets, they are sliders. They are filled with crab meat and excessive amounts of Chipolte mayo. They are just OK for what they are. Our entrees were the Flounder Francaise with spinach and the fried chicken. The flounder was a good dish, and a substantial portion and the German Potato side was really good. . The flounder didn't have enough capers or enough lemon taste to qualify to have the designation ""Francase"" however. The Fried chicken was better. 5 pieces of fried chicken with a biscuit, served with way too much butter, and hot sauce and hot honey. The Chicken was great. It was spicy enough and moist so I didn't need to use any of the sauces.. Biscuit was fine. $29.00. I've got to admit that I liked it . Dessert was the Blueberry cheesecake. Two types of cheese (Ricotta and Cream Cheese? Not sure) . Really good.! I really want to rate this restaurant better than 3 but the fact that the menu is very limited prevents me from doing so.",0,0,0,Bob G.,"JAMAICA, NY",17,213,400

4.0,4/11/2019,I've been wanting to come here for a while. Very satisfied with my experience here. Started off with the spicy crab beignets. The waiter suggested them. They were great. Nice bite! My friends and I all shared the 7th ave tower. Super good. Fresh seafood but nothing crazy. I did feel that the oysters were quite small. Little disappointed in that but everything else was fine. Out of the entire tower my favorite was the tuna tartare and cucumber salad. For dinner I got the steamed mussels. Oh man. These were delicious and a huge serving! They came out with a big pot of mussels. I could've definitely shared it with the table. Their specialty cocktails were quite good. I had the foxy moxy and another drink that I can't remember the name. It had cucumber and black peppe r though. Sounds strange but it was so good.

4.0,3/28/2019,"Came here during Restaurant week for dinner and got to try the their 3 course menu. $42 per person & includes 1 appetizer, 1 main course & 1 dessert. Been eyeing this place since I love restaurants with word plays. The place was cute and very busy. We got there by 7:54pm since I made a reservation for 8 pm but did not get seated til 8:12pm which was a bit frustrating considering the fact that I had a reservation.We knew exactly what I want starting with the spicy crab beignets which is really small in size but very flavorful and super delicious! I cannot begin to tell you how freaking delicious these were. Crab meat tossed in chipotle cremates fraiche in mini beignets topped with butter powder. Squeezed a lil lemon on them bad boys & each bite was exploding with so much flavor. Fingerlicking gooood! Absolutely worth trying, even if it's not for restaurant week.For the main course, I got the Flounder Francaise with sautéed spinach and lemon capers butter. Squeezed a lil lemon on the fish & each bite was filled with zesty flavor. Also ordered a side of German butterball potatoes to accompany the meal since the portion was a bit small which went well with the entree.& as for dessert, I chose to try the Apple cider donuts with warm apple sauce dip from. Made for donut lovers!We were seated by the bus boy area where they kept their water and glasses and put in orders. Didn't think it would be a problem but throughout the night, we kept getting bumped into by the busboy or the waitresses. It took a while to get refills on water and then another long wait for the check. In all, it was good food but the service could have been a bit better.",1,0,1,SamBam C.,"East Elmhurst, Queens, NY",2,53,123

2.0,3/19/2019,"My husband and I had heard great things about Legasea so when we saw that it was on restaurant week, we were excited and booked a table immediately. We easily waited more than 30 minutes just for bread and our drinks to come to the table. From the time that we sat down to the time that we were served our main course was AT LEAST an hour. We were so hungry! When we wanted to get the check, the waiter didn't come around for a good 20 minutes. We just wanted to leave. The food was bland. Maybe this was because of restaurant week? I'm not sure. We love seafood, but we will not be coming back to Legasea :(.",0,0,0,Bryce D.,"Manhattan, NY",406,29,0
2.0,3/17/2019,"Overall, theme for my dining experience - nothing memorable.  Not great, not bad - just meh.  Expensive, yet average seafood.   Prices are higher than the $$ indicate.   Ordered a seafood tower from the raw bar - oysters, clams, shrimp and lobster.   Really small portions.   Had a seared tuna entree, tasted like average seared tuna.  ** yawn **.If this were any other city, I'd give this place 3-stars.  But dude, this is NYC where memorable dining experiences abound.   Felt like I wasted a meal.",2,0,2,Sam C.,"Southlake, TX",69,223,132
3.0,3/15/2019,"Edit: there is no prix fixe menu anymore. There was one outside of restaurant week but not anymore. Reduced a little as this made the place a lot more worth it.I went here a little while ago as restaurant week for lunch as the prices are a bit high otherwise (well it is a fish place inside of a hotel near Times Square from this restaurant group but I digress.) I believe it was 29 for 3 courses which was fine for the quality. The service here is very good. They check on people but not so much that it's intrusive.After ordering, they served some of their ""Bomba Bread"" which was served with some type of herbed butter, some coleslaw, and some pickles. The bread was super soft and very good though maybe a tad too buttery. The herbed butter cut down on the richness of it. The coleslaw was the usual you find in places. I almost always prefer sour pickles but they serve here what is essentially a better tasting version of B&G Bread & Butter Pickles (i.e. a little sweet.) It's more by preference though these were good.Tuna Tartar: Avocado, ""lavosh cracker,"" soy ginger vinaigretteMy appetizer was pretty good. The tuna was semi fatty and the avocado added some richness. The vinaigrette was a little salty and oddly a tiny bit sweet but it went well with the over-sized cracker and the tuna. Pretty solid though nothing amazing. (3.7)Flounder Francaise: Spinach, lemon caper butterA very much refined version of this dish with almost too little citrus; at least compared to the overpowering generic Italian stuff served at some restaurants and weddings so take that as you may. The fish was well portioned and was nice and tender. The spinach was well cooked though it could have used a bit more garlic/flavoring. Excellent and one of the best variations I have had though I would add a bit more sourness and more capers. (4.5)Buttermilk Panna Cotta with Fresh Citrus- Blood orange granita, candied kumquats:Well this is where the citrus went from the flounder (just kidding.) There was way too strong of a grapefruit/blood orange flavor in this. It was in fact quite overpowering outside the white pieces on top. The white pieces on top reminded me of peppermint which was a bit unique and a bit off-putting. The actual pudding near the bottom was well made though I had tot dig through a lot to get to the good section. Easily the weakest of the three dishes. (2.1)The food here was excellent though the prices outside of restaurant week don't warrant a second visit outside of going with a large group as the place is massive. The panna cotta as noted by a few others (take notes) is way too sour though the fish which is what they are known for was excellent.3.5",1,0,2,Glenn C.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",208,1266,376

5.0,3/7/2019,"Such a fantastic place on the second floor of Moxy Times Square in Midtown Manhattan! Went for their 3 course prix fixe lunch which was amazing. We both felt that the portions were more than enough and he was actually shocked when he got a full sized salad as an appetizer! They told us they'd bring us bread for the table while we waited for the food to come out, but they never brought it over.. we were actually relieved by that since the bread would have been too much!! I've had it before and it's so good! They bake it in-house so definitely ask for it if you go and they don't bring it to your table hahaThe customer service was fantastic. Everyone was so attentive, but also not too attentive as in we both get bothered when staff approaches us too many times while we're eating, and here that was not the case. They were very professional, and friendly. The cocktails are a bit pricey, but that goes for most restaurants in the area.. Overall I enjoyed my experience! I would go again for their prix fixe since I'm able to try a few different dishes that way. Almost forgot to mention that I don't like seafood, and don't eat seafood.. but there are many options to choose from if you're the same!",0,0,0,Mandy L.,"New York, NY",461,27,6

I can't say it was my favorite seafood in the world but it was really, really good. The service was great and they ended up having a massive table behind us for some party or something (20+ at one table) and normally I would have been cringing for what would happen to our measly table of 6 but the staff didn't miss a beat.

1.0,2/23/2019,I made plans to visit this restaurant the weekend of my birthday. Nothing about this restaurant is warm or inviting. The food was very misrepresented and the prices were redicilous.  I eat out often and realize that sometimes it's a hit or miss.  And this place is definitely a miss. The spicy crab cake appetizer are the size of munchkins from dunking donuts if not smaller.  I didn't know bread could be so small.  I would never go back or recommend this restaurant to anyone,0,0,0,Celeste R.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,4,3
1.0,2/21/2019,Really disappointed with our first time to Legasea. We got a table and our waitress barely attended to us the entire time. It took 30 minutes after ordering to get our first drink.

Entrees- Cauliflower carbonara pasta: 4/5 a bit on the heavier side but the past was cooked al dente - Branzino with farro: 5/5 favorite dish of the meal. Fish was cooked perfectly, seasoned well, with crispy skin and moist inside. Loved the farro too.Desserts- Vanilla ice cream: 3/5- Cinnamon donut with apple cider glaze: 4/5 more of a fluffy cake texture. I liked how not oily it was.

1.0,2/11/2019,"What was supposed to be a wonderful birthday dinner with my friends turned sour when we experienced one of the most embarrassing and disgusting interactions I've ever had with an establishment. When we were finished with our meals we were waiting for our uber in the lobby. We were literally tracked down by some man (idek what his position was) and was loudly accused of not tipping. He berated us and was extremely passive aggressive. In REALITY the issue was he clearly couldn't read. The tip (large and over the suggested amount mind you) was put onto one receipt. So not only was my friend charged the amount of the tip that we left, we were bullied into giving more because of we were so embarrassed by their incompetence and the way they handled the situation. Why would you ever in your right mind follow someone out of an establishment for TIP anyway? His sole purpose was to embarrass us and if this is how you guys train your workers then that is a true disappointment. I will never come back here and I advise anyone (especially anyone who is young and black) to steer clear.",1,0,0,Nia B.,"Elmont, NY",0,2,0
5.0,2/9/2019,"There are a few places that seem to just get everything right and Legasea is one of them. Located on the second floor of the Moxy Hotel, the restaurant features a hip vibe and really great, really fresh seafood. We went for Restaurant Week and the crab beignets, flounder française and chocolate caramel cake were superb.What stands out here is service. Our waiter Bryan was attentive and had great suggestions. He was also extremely helpful to me in transferring out of my wheelchair and getting comfortable in my seat. A true gentleman. We decided to get drinks at the hotel's rooftop lounge after dinner and one of the women at the front arranged for a security guard to pick us up in a private elevator so we wouldn't have to go outside to enter through the lounge line.

2.0,2/6/2019,"Overrated. Best house bread I've tried but overall this restaurant is too expensive for what you get. We ordered the chicken and the flounder with a side of roasted broccoli. The chicken breast just with herbs is way up there in price, $25 for a very little sliced chicken breast with a not so unique flavor. The flounder we order under the understanding it was just the fillet in a sauce, but it was breaded and we didn't know, we didn't like it and we didn't eat it, but they charged it anyway! They offered a dessert to compensate for the inconvenience but we don't eat desserts so, we ended up paying for a flounder we didn't eat (way to expensive too, $37) It was the worst dinner we had in the two weeks we spent in NYC. If it wasn't for our server, Megan (who was so nice!) I would say it was a complete disaster. Such a shame since we love our stay in the Moxy Hotel.",0,0,0,Carina M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0
4.0,2/5/2019,"I came here for a business meal and Legasea did not disappoint. The seafood tower was a great presentation to start with. I usually do not like to order this because it is difficult to share, but they definitely chopped everything up perfectly to the perfect selection. We also ordered the grilled octopus, oyster, pasta, fish and a chocolate cake. Everything was the right portion size, but was also a great share without flavors that were too overpowering. The true importance of having seafood is to be able to taste the freshness of each dish and that was exactly the case here!The one hiccup during the meal was probably that I felt a little rushed, even with a 6 PM reservation. I wasn't happy about being pushed out of the restaurant, especially when trying to discuss serious matters. The ambiance is great for a date night and a meal for all occasions. I would definitely revisit at a less busy hour to refrain from being pushed out of there.",0,0,0,Cindy U.,"New York, NY",310,498,849
3.0,2/5/2019,"My friend recommended this place that opened about two years ago under the TAO group. It is conveniently located right by Time Square and the Moxy hotel. Magic Hour is a fun place to go after dinner. The drink ""We Were On a Break"" is really yummy and their bread is my favorite, extra homemade pickles is a must. We started off with the tuna tar tar, the delicious ricotta dip, the amazing crab sliders, and the beet salad. I would say the crab sliders I would personally order for myself because they are amazing and tiny (comes with 3 small bite like sliders) and they are too good that you don't want to only have 1 small slider! The ricotta dip on toast is amazing as well! I would do without the beet salad next time. For our entrees we ordered the flounder, the cauliflower pasta, and the skirt steak with potatoes. The dish that stood out the most was the Flounder and the pasta! Amazing. For dessert we ordered some of the apple donuts and the chocolate cake. The cake was served cold and was decent, could do without, and so was the apple donuts which tasted like a churro combined with a pound cake. I would come here again to grab some small plates and drinks with friends before going to Magic Hour but would probably not dine for entrees again. Service was average.",1,0,2,Alexis M.,"New York, NY",261,177,375

4.0,12/30/2018,"Ugh. The branzino and the lobster hot pot for 2. Don't ask any questions, just get those two things. They are delectable! There were only two of us having dinner, but the way the smell of that branzino and lobster hit me, we just had to have both. Typically my reviews would tell you about the flavor profiles and maybe I'd add a suggested wine to pair, but not today. Those two items are just damn good. So why 4 stars and not 5? Thought you'd never ask. Our first waitress seemed to be a little passive aggressive and irritable. Within no less than 5-10 minutes, the vibe was completely off. This was our Christmas dinner and I didn't want anyone or anything to ruin such a wonderful occasion. Perhaps the waitress picked up on my subtle mood after about 10 minutes and just like that, we had a new waitress. Typically in these situations, you'd expect that with a change in your service personnel, they'd come introduce you and tell you that the new person would be taking over. That wasn't the case here. It was just a ""here you go"" as if I were bothering our initial waitress and not the other way around. To my pleasant surprise, our new waitress was everything and more! Kind, helpful, knowledgeable and quick. The hotpot was reallllyyy good, but not great. Most of the seafood was cooked really well. The sauce that it came in seemed to be missing a level/note. It's not spicy at all, and could use maybe a tad more spice to really get it going. Still a great choice. In terms of the portion of seafood for two people...I'd say it just barely makes the cut. With a few shrimp, a couple scallops, small to medium sized lobster tail cut in half and many mussels...it just barely portions out to two people. Though the corn and potatoes definitely make up for it. You won't leave hungry. The desert menu was pretty standard. We opted for the sorbet selection. The pear sorbet was everything I could have imagined and more. This place will definitely be in my new lineup for awesome seafood at a reasonable price. Ah!

I came back a couple of times the food was again bananas! But the service was okay. Like okay if the food wasn't soo good I wouldn't come back. Until I came back this week. From the bartender Nina who suggested some new great items and cocktails and super fun, and then For the first time since I started eating there regularly I got my original server from the first time I dined with Legasea khoidia. Just really blown away this time. I'm a loyal customer of this restaurant. The food is really something else but it's the service that really makes me feel xt good. Celebrating my moms birthday in a couple months will definitely be back. When you go you have to have the crab beignet, kale waldorf, the bass, pasta seafood, and the bRocolli!!!! Only negative that I have is that depending on the server that I get that day I may not enjoy my experience as much. And the managers are kind of hard to find.

We ended up playing ""Heads Up"" on our phones--environment was extremely conducive to it.Otherwise, excellent service from our waitress, we stuck with drinks, which were all pretty good (ranging from Cosmopolitans to Old Fashions ordered at our table).

I watched multiple servers (mine included) pick up the three water pitchers at the service station. The servers picked them up, realized they were light in weight, looked inside and when they realized they were empty they gave a disgusted look. None bothered to fill the pitchers. I rated it three stars because they recently opened (I think) so it could just be an operational glitch but it seemed like something the team could have figured out on the fly and provided a better customer experience.",0,1,1,Brian N.,"Seattle, WA",151,138,67

4.0,10/30/2018,"Went here for lunch. The place is nice, we sat in the back and had the prefix lunch menu. For a good price, they offered a three course menu. To start, not a part of prefix, we had the raw clams. The clams were super fresh, with an excellent cocktail sauce, so good. They also offered two other dipping sauces I didn't try. One your normal butter sauce and the other a soy based sauce. For the prefix, I had the tuna tartar for appetizer. It was tuna with avocado in a soy type sauce.  Delicious, flavors all worked together. I had the branzino as main course with couscous. The fish was a filet, perfectly cooked and full of flavor. I had the cram brûlée ice cream for dessert. The ice cream came with a cookie. The cookie was fine, nothing special, the ice cream tasted just like the dessert, very impressive. All in all the food was really good, and perfect portion for one person. Lastly, we had two glasses of rosé, a dozen clams, and the prefix menu for about $130. I believe for the quality and quantity of food in NYC for that price is super affordable. The service was very good, coming by asking what we needed and always available.

The two of us shared and we still had food left over! I would def recommend theobster bake.

3.0,10/21/2018,"This is typical Jeffrey and Jayson. We started the day searching out for the perfect brunch spot, since Jayson had the day off. We went to Juniper. (Don't go. Just don't.) And that didn't turn out to be particularly good. We then caught a movie. We were literally about to get on the train, and we decided we were a tad hungry, and to see what was around where we were.Well, that turned into this whole J and J event. But, being on a severe oyster kick, we landed at Legasea. Warning: The restaurant doesn't open until 5 p.m. Don't get their early. Unless you enjoy sitting around tourists coming and going from the hotel above, I'd suggest not showing up early. I really wanted to be impressed. On paper, they look like they should be. I just wasn't, at all. We started with a dozen oysters, both east coast and west coast. They serve them on the half shell, or on the half shell and with American Caviar for $2 extra. Now, as a caviar lover, I know that $2 American Caviar is like just adding sprinkles. It's a joke. But, we thought, let's just try it.The oysters were okay. Nothing great. And definitely don't waste your money on the American Caviar topping. It doesn't add anything and it's not impressive at all. . We got the 7th Avenue Tower. It's a bit pricey. But you get: Oysters, Prawn Cocktail, Littleneck Clams, Whole Chilled Lobster, Marinated Mussels, 2 King Crab Leg sections, Tuna Tartare and Cucumber Salad.It was good. $135 good? Eh. Not really. Jayson tried the Mac and Cheese with Smoked Gouda, and white cheddar. It was disgusting. We sent that back. Skip it.And of course he ended it with Double Layer Cheekcake, with a speculoos crust, strawberry compo. He finished that.The service was okay. She basically disappeared after we said we don't drink. I barely remember her stopping back except to give us the check. Twice I had to try to flag her. She was clearly interested in tables ordering drinks. All in all, it was an okay meal. The ambiance feels a bit stiff and stuffy. It's a place where the hostesses have a bit of an attitude, and no one looks like they're having too much fun.I doubt we will ever go back.

Lots of seatings. We had a rather early (5:15pm) reservation and the restaurant was pretty empty although it filled up quickly while we were there. We were seated right away in a booth. Our server was very nice and attentive. All the food from appetizers to entrees to desserts were of high quality and fresh!First of all, loved the complimentary bread that just came out of the oven which meant it was still very warm! So buttery. Appetizers: calamari was crispy and very flavorful. Yellowtail sashimi was very fresh. Chopped green salad was a perfect balance and I loved the fish looking dish that was used to serve the salad. Mac and cheese was good too.Entrees: seafood Mariana pasta was amazing! I've had black ink squid pasta and it was my first time trying the black shell. Lots of seafood and it had a kick to it. Scottish salmon and flounder were delicious. How could you not get seafood at this restaurant!Dessert: we were so full already but wanted to try  and share some desserts. The Apple doughnut was perfect way to end a wonderful meal with great friends.Would love to go back again whether it's for a romantic dinner or a fun night out with friends.

For appetizers, we ordered west coast oysters, grilled octopus and yellowtail sushimi. For entree, I ordered the halibut special, which was quiet large and so tasty. The restaurant is very spacious and offers plenty of room where it doesn't make you feel like you're on top of one another despite being very crowded.

3.0,10/13/2018,"Just meh. Inside is nice with a lovely staircase and lighting guiding you to the hostess desk. I made a reservation a week in advance but had called that day to push it back after some of my party was running late. It wasn't a problem and the person on the phone admitted that they were pretty open all night and it really didn't matter what time we got there! I was surprised that that would be the case on a Friday night. Once seated, it took forever for the waiter to get to us. At one point he apologized for the delay but then still took another few minutes to actually introduce himself and get our drink orders. And he made us wait even longer just to get water which was odd. Then we didn't get the bread until we were halfway through our appetizers. I ordered the fish and chips which just okay. Friends ordered the pasta dishes (carbonara and marina) and they said it was very good. One of our entrees came out a long time after the others. The waiter blamed it on the kitchen, saying they forgot it, so he comped us one of our desserts. We had the sweet potato pie and the apple donuts. Both delicious. Cocktails were pretty but nothing spectacular. So yeah. Kinda meh. No fatal flaws but also nothing that blew me away. Not sure if I'll be back.",0,0,0,Sahara S.,"Bronx, NY",81,25,11

The squid ink pasta was well cooked and quite good, the spicy marinara is a nice touch. I always appreciate a good sprinkle of crunchy breadcrumbs on top of my seafood pasta. What dropped my review to 2 stars was we witnessed the bartender pour a cup of scotch back into the bottle. Okay, so you poured a cup and maybe the customer changed their mind or you poured the wrong one....I understand it was top shelf and it's not a cheap scotch...but nowhere is it ok to pour back a drink into the bottle.

3.0,9/3/2018,This place is okay. The decor and ambience is amazing especially for it to be so close to the tourist area. You almost forget that you are a few blocks away from noisy 42nd street. We called ahead of time for reservations and when we arrived 1/3 of our party wasn't there yet. We were told to have a seat at the bar which we did. We were handed drink menus by the bartender and glasses of water which was great because I was thirsty from walking to the restaurant.  Once our full party was there we were seated immediately. The waiter we had explained the entire menu from top to bottom which took about 5 minutes. I think the menu changes or some items are limited time items. I saw roasted crab claws on yelp but the waiter said he never heard of the dish at all. We all ordered the same dish (seafood pasta) just with different taste preferences. The pasta didn't list squid as a ingredient but there was a lot of squid in the dish and only 1 prawn. When we asked the waiter if it was in fact squid in the dish he said no but we asked him to check with the cook who confirmed yes. So we had to send one dish back because she doesn't eat squid at all. She end up getting the salmon dish which she liked. Dessert was okay. The strawberry cheesecake tastes like cinnamon which I'm guessing is a main ingredient because it was all you can taste. The whip cream didn't have any taste even for it being whipped cream and the key lime pie was okay.

Entrees are right around $30. I had the burger and fries which was ok not bad and my date had the seafood pasta which was wildly under-seasoned. Crab beignets were tasty but would have been tastier with more salt.  If money aint no thang then none of this will bother you but, if you're concerned with getting the most bang for your buck, Legasea may not be the right catch for you.",2,2,1,Charles K.,"Brooklyn, NY",236,365,554

We all know Ryan, he's great absolutely Great!! We asked about the raw bar and he proceeded to explain they were fresh and delicious!! So we took his word and orders east and west oysters with 12 littleneck clams, calamari, and the soft hot complimentary bread with three spreads came out. The clams and oysters were sssoooo fresh, no need to chew them. We just couldn't get enough, so we ordered another serving. They still came out as good. Dinner was served. I shared my entree, which it worked because mussels was a recommendation as well from Ryan and it was Amazing!!! Mussels were tender and had lots of flavor! I just kept eating, yum yum!! We also had dessert. Not sure where I was going to fit it. But a spoon of each flavor won't hurt. All the while my blue moon was constantly refilled without asking. Thank you Craig!!!We loved the service, attention, ambiance, drinks, and fresh food. You must stop here try their raw bar, see Craig or Ryan for recommendations , they will make sure your having a memorable time!!",2,2,0,Camille G.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",146,357,848

I believe the restaurant is attached to the hotel just an FYI. For starters we got the grilled squid and spicy crab beignets.The grilled squid came was decent, I think what was a little strange was the potatoes were cold and wasn't sure if that was supposed to be part of the dish or if it had just gotten left out. I think the big highlight of the dinner was the spicy crab beignets, despite being really small they were really tasty. Now for the main course, we got the fried chicken and biscuits, and mussels. The fried chicken came in a nicely presented box, but was just ""eh"". There were actually quite a lot of muscles and we weren't able to finish.

The food and ambiance were good, though the restaurant was less than buzzy. The wait staff were professional but curt and not overly engaging which was fine as well. The bartender Maggie was excellent. The 1 star review is driven by a so called ""manager"" Alex (portly short slick haired turd) who showed all the signs of someone exemplyflying what is worst about service. At the end of our meal we were told that that we could get a stamp to go directly up to the rooftop of the hotel for a drink since the restaurant was closing. We happened to see Alex who is a manager there about the stamp and he immediately portrayed his douchiness in full splendor because he thought he was doing us some big favor, beyond unprofessional to a group who has lived and gone out extensively in NYC the past 20+ years. He novice unprofessional attitude was beyond appalling and your establishment despite the food will never be visited again who encounters this tool Alex. So do yourselves a favor and get this guy out of your place and away from any or all human contact. Never coming back to this relatively new place and you have Alex the manager to thank for it.

1.0,6/8/2018,"A relatively new hotel in a bizarre fashion district / Times Square location. However we were willing to overlook the very dubious looking crowd because the bar tender (Maggie) and the waitress were both eager and efficient and the food was surprisingly good. However there is a terribly inexperienced, incredibly obnoxious, very young ""manager"" on the 2nd floor called Alex (short, greasy, slicked back hair, very young, obviously clueless about the level of customer service that is expected in New York) who completely ruined our evening. Terrible attitude, no concept of customer service and incredibly rude. As someone who frequents the best New York restaurants almost daily, I have to admit I have never experienced someone so completely rude, and inept at his job. I rarely, if ever, post Yelp reviews but felt the need to because of this horrible experience.

Had sun dried tomatoes on top and basil. Nice balance to all the buttery goodness. Then finish the massive meal with ice cream. Coconut lime is to die for.

The spicy crab beignets and tuna tatare (this was the best out of everything we had) were good as everyone has said in their reviews. The scallops were cooked perfectly, but way too salty for all of us. The seared tuna was good, but paired with a sauce that lacked in flavor. The branzino was grilled perfectly and was tender and the best out of the three entrees. We ended dinner with the sundae and panna cotta. Definitely would recommend getting the panna cotta, but if you can't handle your citrus it's not for you. Service was good/mediocre. Why would you put candles in the sundae and take it out when we asked to light it up? Even if we didn't mention it was birthday and you thought it was just a regular dinner, you shouldn't remove the candles if we asked to light it up. Satisfactory but not exceptional.

1.0,5/18/2018,"I just came here yesterday and had a mediocre experience. First off, the restaurant is nicely decorated and good for large parties as its a big restaurant by NYC standards. The best part about the whole meal was the bread and butter that they serve. It is a seafood restaurant so decided to get some seafood options such as the grilled branzino, oysters and stone crab. The branzino was slightly undercooked and had a large amount of butter. The stone crab literally came in 2 pieces with not much meat on them. However, the oysters were excellent. My dad decided to go for the burger but instead got the fried chicken that was cute but tasted so poorly and not well fried. We also ordered fries-meh could be better and 2 salads: kale and green goddess. The green goddess was better. Overall we were just displeased with the food we didnt want to even bother with dessert!

I started with the beet salad, sweet, little tangy and delicious. Great portion and shareable. I ordered the P.E.I. Moules Frites - the fries were cooked perfectly and mussels were good. I did feel they were a little small and many shells were empty but the serving was still a lot. My friend got the wild branzino I didn't try it but he said it was delicious.

That was quite possibly the least satisfying meal that I've ever had in NYC, which is quite disappointing because I stay at The Moxy Hotel a number of times per year. Ambiance: meh; probably a good spot with a crowd but quite loud Food: I had the moules frites (mussels and fries) and a side of grilled broccoli. The mussels were definitely the best part of the meal but I have had MUCH better mussels elsewhere.  The broth, which is typically one of the best things about ordering mussels, lacked seasoning. The fries were soggy.  The broccoli could have been terrific but they were served on top of a huge dollop of Dijon mustard.  If you order this, get the Dijon on the side! It completely overpowers the taste of the broccoli. Price: $42 for a subpar meal and a Diet Coke? No thank you. In closing, the cocktails did look good, the bar staff was very attentive and were clearly working their tails off, but that's all I can say positively about this place.

5.0,4/6/2018,"Since I work right across the street from this restaurant, I've walked by since it was constructing to its grand opening. This restaurant is built in conjunction to the Moxy hotel which is pretty cool! I came here for lunch today with friends and was pleasantly surprised by the decor. When you walk in, you have to go up the stairs to where the restaurant is located but I got lost walking into the hotel area. Restaurant is immediately to your right when you get up the stairs! The dining area is decent in size and the tables are not stuck together to fit more people so there was walking room and space between tables which was nice! When we got to the restaurant, it was still fairly empty but a little pass noon, groups of people filled almost all tables! Our waiter was great and gave us enough time and explanation of the menu- recommendations and everything in between. We went with the pre-fixe menu that is $29 for an appetizer, entree and dessert. We also ordered the spicy crab beignets.We got our appetizers- I got the manhattan clam chowder which was super big in portion. I really enjoyed it as there were clam pieces, everything tastes fresh and it included bacon bites which really gave the soup more flavor. They also give you a pack of oyster crackers! We then got the spicy crab beignets which is really small in size but very flavorful and super delicious! One order comes with 4 beignets stuffed with crab meat!Our entrees came out shortly- I got the crispy chicken sandwich that comes with pickles and cole slaw. I dont like either to be honest but I ate it anyway because it was very light though I did take some of that our so it was not super overwhelming. My sandwich came with fries which was fairly good too! Not too salty and it was enjoyable! Dessert was a choice of ice cream/sorbet or panna cotta! Personally, I am not a fan of panna cotta so I choose the ice cream.sorbet option- we got to choose three flavors to try. I chose vanilla bean, rocky road and the maple bourbon. When we got our dessert, my friend and I who both ordered vanilla bean as one of the flavors of ice cream noticed it tasted weird- there was an odd taste, almost like it was savory.. we told our waiter who was kind enough to give us new scoops of ice cream. Our new scoops were good. Vanilla bean was light and sweet; rocky road was chocolaty and semi bitter; maple bourbon was pretty good as well. Overall experience here was just great. Our waiter was really great- came around to fill our water often and checked in with us every so often but not in an annoying way!

New restaurant by the TAO Group, so you know what you're getting (big, scene-y, semi expensive, but decent food).The vibes here were great, and I loved that the restaurant took full advantage of the enormous space, putting enough elbow room between tables so that you don't feel like you're on top of the people next to you. Also really enjoyed the marine-themed decorations in the hallway leading up to the dining room.They start you off with some amazing pull-apart bread (seriously, just give me a pan of this and I'd be happy). As for actual food, we ordered half a dozen oysters to share (3 east, 3 west) and the sheep's milk ricotta dip to start. The entire table also participated in the 3 course prix fixe for $29.

My friend and I are food bloggers so we kinda tend to order a lot of food all at once. For appetizer's we had the roasted snow crab claws it was so good I ate my friends own as well then we also had the tuna tartare which was another good dish. For our entrees we order the 8 piece fried chicken it was good had better but you gotta try it with the honey & hot sauce gives the chicken a kick and makes it taste so much better.

""what?"".  Prices were reasonable.  We ordered the baked clams, Scottish salmon, sea bass, fries and some s'mores donut thing for dessert.  The fish was fresh and cooked almost perfectly.  The fries were a greasy mess with no potato, but that's what you get for ordering fries in a place like this I suppose.  The clams were small little things and the weird donut balls were way too salty in certain spots.  They gave us two little sweet rolls, which were really good.  We waited a long time for our entrees because of the large party that was there.  Since there is no way of knowing when a party would be going on there, we would not go back to eat here.  That and the loud music ruined the dining experience for us.  There are too many other amazing places to eat nearby.",3,1,1,Anna B.,"Montclair, NJ",332,89,12

We were in the mood for seafood and after reading some of the Yelp reviews and looking at the menu we decided to give Legasea a try as it looked good and was close to our hotel.  If you go the entrance can be a little confusing as you have to go up a flight of stairs but once we were there we were seated immediately as it was a Sunday evening and not too busy. They provided warm bread and a small amount of coleslaw and pickles as an amuse bouche which was a nice touch. We started with a glass of New Zealand Cabernet Sauvignon for me and a Pinot Noir for her along with  half dozen east coast oysters.  They had the usual sauces but they had a lemony sauce that really stood out. I wish I had the recipe.  We then split their BLT salad which consisted of half a head of crisp, iceberg lettuce with tomatoes and bacon with a blue cheese dressing. Really excellent and one salad was enough for two.  We both had the grilled fish as our entree. My wife had the branzino and I had the red snapper. She wished that she would have had the fish skin removed.  All in all we liked the snapper a bit better but both were very good.  The fish was served with a farro salad and grilled Belgian endive.  We passed on desert. We both left feeling full but not stuffed.  Ambience and service were good but a bit impersonal.

For ambience, this place is very nice. Modern, rustic, laid back yet professional. Definitely good spot for work events and tables seem to have decent spacing. Had the restaurant week menu and went with the Manhattan clam chowder and the flounder. I'm more of a New England clam chowder person but that's on the menu. This was the best manhattan (tomato-based) clam chowder I've ever had. It was light and full of fresh clams in shells. The flounder was perfectly seasoned and cooked and the desserts were also fantastic (this coming from someone who does not have a sweet tooth). The only negative was they brought our entrees before we finished our appetizers (and we were not slowly eating!) but otherwise impressed w the quality of food for the price point ($29 for restaurant week--yet do lunch only for RW though).

Service was very attentive as well.They give every table warm rolls, cole slaw, and pickled vegetables. Loved the pickles! We started off with 2 order of snow crab claws and baked clams. The crab claws were juicy and the clams were super flavorful although not huge. For our entrees we had the pork chop schnitzel and scallops. We got hay stack fries and Mac n cheese as a side. They recommended to get sides with anything from the grill because portions are smaller and it only comes with a farro salad. We both enjoyed both entrees. The pork chop wasn't dry and pretty decent side, it also comes with the bone, a sweet caper sauce and a cucumber salad? The scallops were a good size with a lemon sauce, very flavorful as well, farro salad was great too tossed in some kind of vinaigrette. The Mac n cheese was pretty big for a side with a spicy kick to it, cheesy but not overwhelming.

They oysters also were so tiny after we had been informed by our waiter that they were ""nice and plump"". My husband ordered the beet salad which was quite tasty but extremely ""new tasting"". It had spiralized raw veggies and some golden beets and some wonderful fresh herbs that gave it wonderful flavor, and for his main course he ordered the seared tuna and asked for it to be served with soy sauce. When it arrived the waiter apologized  that they had no soy sauce. My husband said that he would have ordered differently had he know that. He tasted the tuna and said that he did not want it. The waiter took away the plate and said he would be back to take his ""new"" order. He returned with the same tuna,  ""replated"" with a large bottle of soy sauce. It was not what he had wanted, and was terrible, but he ate it due to the fact that we had been there such a long time, by this time.

We had 8 PM reservations for 8(a lot of our team couldn't make it). We were seated at 8:15 because we were taking pictures, the place is beautiful. We were given 1 drink menu for 8 ppl?! Finally order drinks and apps and entrees at the same time. 9:15, still no apps, we inquired with the waitress, she apologized repeatedly and ran off to the kitchen, we ordered another round. 9:40 still no food, but it was time for another round. The waitress can back with a round of Preseco (said that was the best she could do)on the house, sure, I love mixing champagne with pepper infused tequila drink. But non the less, conversations and laughs were flowing but after a 10 hour work day, everyone was starving. 10PM, still no food. 10:25, I finally had enough and went to bar to ask for the manager. He apologized and within minutes, our apps were finally served!! Food was all tasteful and well cooked, flavors we're balanced really well. The oysters were fresh and would strongly recommend getting at least a half dozen. My only complaint about the food was the lobster dish for twos chef had a heavy hand on the salt. The red snapper and the Bronzino were refreshingly light a good! I didn't try the fried chicken, but from the smell of it, I will have during my next visit. Hope the service is better next time. I'm being super generous with 4 stars but we genuinely had a great time that night. Ohh and make a stop at the roof top, there's a carousel!",0,0,1,Esmira J.,"HOWARD BEACH, NY",3,99,224
4.0,1/3/2018,"I came here on a whim with a friend looking for a quick afternoon bite to eat and found this place on Yelp since it was in the area. Walking in we loved the ambiance and how big and spacious the place seemed. You have to walk up a flight of stairs to the actual restaurant. We went at a random time.. 3:30pm so we were one of the few tables there. We only ordered the mussels and fries to share because honestly neither of us was that hungry but wanted to snack on something and find a nice place to catch-up. They came out with some fresh complimentary bread (4 little dinner rolls) which were really delicious and also little sides of coleslaw and pickles. Perfect little appetizers! The mussels and fries were good too but I wish there was more broth in the mussels. Overall, loved the ambiance and how classy the place looked. Will definitely come back with other friends to try the rest of the menu!",1,1,1,Sarah C.,"Seattle, WA",232,132,1148
5.0,1/2/2018,"With New Year's day, it didn't even dawn on me that some places would be closed. Having said that, this was one of the ones that was open. Randomly having stumbled in here, this place was a little gem! The atmosphere and the ambiance are very welcoming and relaxing. The seats are comfortable and tables aren't as crammed as some of the other places I've been to recently. When we got here, they were a little slow, steadily getting busier and busier, to almost being full by the time we left. The service was great, with the servers being attentive, helpful, suggestive and very knowledgeable on what they offer and specialize in. The food on the other hand was amazing!!!! Oh, boy, do they know their seafood like the back of their hands. The answer, with my 5 star rating is obviously a solid, without a doubt yes!!! We got a couple of appetizers (spicy crab beignet) and baked clams Barcelona. They were so well paired, proportioned, with the presentation leading into a mouthwatering flavor and an amazing experience. For the main course we went with their Lobster bake, which again, surpassed all of my expectations on every single level.Yes, absolutely I would come here again, recommending this place to anyone and everyone in the vicinity, passing through, or looking for an experience and some amazing food.",3,0,2,Dan K.,"Roseville, CA",182,227,75
4.0,1/1/2018,"Went here a couple of times with my family over the holiday weekend as they were staying at the Moxy hotel. We were pretty hungry both times that we went, so we decided to split a bunch of dishes:Bomba bread (4 stars): This is the bread that they serve at every table to start the meal--they are so light and airy and warm and a nice start to the meal.Spicy crab beignet (3.5 stars): These are sort of small for the price, but are perfect as a mini appetizer and the crab has good flavor--not particularly spicy though.Scallops (3 stars): These were probably the least impressive item during both of our meals as they were a bit chewy and gritty.Lobster (5 stars): Everyone was impressed by this dish as it was a good size and the lobster was so fresh and buttery.Burger (3.5 stars): They aren't known for their burger, but this rendition is pretty good--it is also HUGE so probably best to be split as it comes with two huge patties.Fish and chips (4.5 stars): This dish was a nice surprise as the fish was so flavorful and the breading was light. I was not a huge fan of their tartar sauce, but still good nonetheless. Citrus granita (3.5 stars): This is probably their lightest dessert and was decent, especially if you prefer a more fruit-centric dessert.Chocolate caramel cake (4 stars): This cake was incredibly rich and had a great flavor as well--more than enough to split between 2-4 people.Ice cream sundae (4.5 stars): I don't even know all the things that were on this sundae but it was truly decadent.Overall, this place is a great addition to the NYC food scene, especially in this area. Almost everything was delicious and the space is not as ""in your face"" as some of the other TAO restaurants can be. Definitely worth checking out if you are looking for a nice dinner out in the area.",1,0,0,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",746,1843,225

Our server Clint was fantastic.  Knowledgeable, friendly and the perfect blend of there when you need him but not hovering to the point where you feel uncomfortable. Really, really a pleasure. 2. The food.was great. Although I typically don't order flounder,  there was nothing basic about this dish.   Light and flaky with a lemon caper sauce.  The lemon chicken was good although the accompanying veggies were overly salty. The fried chicken is fried perfectly; crispy, juicy and flavorful. 3. Drinks complemented the food, kudos to the bartender.   They also have options for wines by the glass and bottle. I guess I wouldn't expect anything less from the group that brought us Tao.  I'll reserve by five stars for the next visit although I am sure it will be equally fabulous.  Lowlights: salty broccoli rabe.   I also thought the Caesar was too over powdered with anchovy but if you like anchovies you are sure to love it.  I found the kale salad with honeycrisp apples to be a much better choice.We're looking at the dessert menu now but honestly I am stuffed.",0,0,0,Chandi T.,"Hackensack, NJ",3,18,6

The complimentary rolls and coleslaw, pickles and some type of herb butter you get when you're seated are so good! The seafood other people ordered looked nice as well, but of course I can't comment on the taste. Our server Sarah was SO nice - her service is litterally what the 100 emoji was invented for. She was friendly, enthusiastic, good pace. It's a really cozy place, and definitely worth the visit. But the place is looouuuddd, just FYI.

My husband and I split the lobster bake, and the only good part was the scallops and corn. The lobster, prawns, mussels, and clams were all well cooked but rather poor quality.  For the price, and just in general for the time of year, we were super disappointed in the quality of the food. With regard to the ambiance, it was not the ""trendy/romantic"" vibe listed in most of the reviews.  The waiters were busy pushing their $35/glass champagne while the majority of other diners were preoccupied taking selfies with their food.

3.0,12/24/2017,"I had an event in their Magic Hour Lounge and thought I'd stop for dinner here beforehand.  Was given wrong advice.  I wanted the Seafood Tower. It sounded delicious! but one of the hostesses said it was just like an appetizer so instead I ordered the pork schnitzel entree thinking it was pork chops.  It was fried pork?  Never thought pork would come fried.  The sorbet dessert was delicious though and a big portion too!  Mmmm. The bartender was dancing to music a little which I could appreciate normally but I thought he was a little too comfortable at a place that just opened two months ago.  It's also a job he just started? Oh, his name is Giovanni; just looked at my receipt!  He even touched my hand by mistake while setting my utensils and mat (never said excuse me).  I just didn't love my server I guess.Oh just remembered I asked him for the price of a Stoli orange and soda before I bought it.  He said $11.  When the bill came out it said $13?  I made mention to another server of his mistake.  She said, there is nothing they can do and they made my drink stronger anyway.  Meanwhile I only drank 1/2 of it.  The photos of this venue on the website make it look far more gorgeous than it really is.  It's a bit expensive too and more casual than the casual elegant dress code I read it to be somewhere.  Maybe if I tried the seafood I would have ranked it higher than a 3, but right now, that's all it deserves to me.",0,1,0,A T.,"Irvington, NY",0,54,0

The bar/lounge area was spacious and comfortable, prices for drinks were on par with NYC, though not as pricy as most hotel bars.The service was welcoming and the dining room was bustling with out being intrusive.

We started off with the roasted snow crab claws and it was so flavorful! The crab was meaty. Also had the spicy crab beignets. Think of baby sliders but with cute little beignets stuffed with chunks of crab meat. A Must try is the Lobster Bake! It's a pot full of seafood with burst of flavors. It's big enough to share between 2-3 people. We pretty much finished it between the 2 of us. The Mac & Cheese is amazing as well! It had the right amount of cheesiness and loved the texture of the spirals. If you still have room for dessert then the World's Fair Sundae is delicious. It's customized and you can choose 2 scoops of ice cream flavor, toppings, and drizzles.

First, we were seated directly under a speaker cranking out hip/hop music.  It was so loud you had to resort to sign language to speak across the table... Then, we had a table full of very nice Italian gentleman shouting at each other, probably about missing the World Cup.... You could hear yourself think above the cacoughaney of noise.  Asked to be reseated and were kindly and quickly accommodated.... and our nice young waiter Pauli stayed with us even though we were seated on the other side of the restuarant.  Sorry to say the move must have caused confusion because 45 minutes after arriving, we still had no bread and our appetizers were forgotten.  Yikes.... Pauli finally remembers us and said ""kitchen was backed up"" (place was half full) and bread and apps did show up after almost a full hour.  I will say the food was high quality and well prepared.... except the mac & cheese that looked good but was stone cold.  Lobster bake as plenty of big enough for two and good value.  We thought about desert but we're fatigued by the time it was offered.  Punch lines.....

4.0,11/19/2017,"Watch out Catch! This place totally reminded me of catch from the menu to the ambience which I love ! It's located in the Moxy hotel and is super trendy and sexy. Had reservations for Saturday night after a friend raved about this place. Went to the bar for a drink first which is very industrial chic and had the relationship status (a nice strong margarita) prior to being seated... make sure your party is there in a timely fashion as they will not seat you unless your entire party is there (15 Min grace period). Loved our waitress Kristin she was super enthusiastic, professional and patient which was nice compared to the blonde girl in the front that wouldn't even look at me when I spoke lol this is a business. Be professional and kind, you're the first person people see when they walk in.... bad taste in my mouth with her but didn't let it ruin my night. Like I said, Kristin made up for it! The night prior my parents dined here and said they had an amazing experience with Tianna. Down to business, the bread they give you is equivalent to a Hawaiian roll with a kick, the top is pretzel like with the salt and butter accompanied by coleslaw, pickles, and cucumber butter. We ordered the seafood tower which was good, it came with raw clams, oysters, crushed cucumber salad, crab, shrimp, lobster tails and tuna.. one of our lobster shells was empty lol it didn't have a tail in it but it still was a lot. I don't know if it meant to look like that but whatever. Also ordered the spicy crab beignets which were a nice light bite, they tasted really fresh and they're small in size (4 diners, 1 for each of us). The branzino with faro was amazing. It comes completely filleted and has such a nice citrus kick to it with the most delicious faro salad (3 of us ordered this and loved it) and also the flounder Francese was amazing, I would probably recommend you ask for a bit more Francese sauce bc it looked like it Could have used more but it was still so light and fresh, very enjoyable. For sides, we ordered the sweet potato tempura which was cooked to perfection, the crushed cucumber salad which was so refreshing ( I think it was cooked with sesame oil but also had a light seafood taste? Sounds weird but it was good) and the Gouda Mac and cheese, it could have used salt. This def was not the star of the meal. On the sweeter side, we had the doughnuts which had a nice lemon creme to really cleanse your palate after with some fluffy torched marshmallow on top and the double layer cheesecake, it was two cakes stacked on top of each other... eh... the crust was good it had a very strong nutmeg and cinnamon kick to it, I'm not the hugest cheesecake fan so use your judgement... but I really did love our time here. It's a sexy place, def make reservations, I don't know if I would risk walking in here.... Just a note, we tried to hit up magic hour for a drink after our $500 dinner which we thought we be a no brainer since we just dined essentially at the same place, lol no. The doorman that was downstairs totally was a huge A Hole and was in our face telling us no lol calm down door man. He seriously disgusted me. The restaurant should work with the bar especially if you're going to have some high rollers in there ... like why should I walk outside and wait on line when we just had 6 drinks at $15 a clip, obv I want to enjoy myself more at the bar but not after that guy was so completely and utterly gross.

Check out the roof bar afterwards.",0,0,0,Jerrica S.,"Napa, CA",0,10,3
4.0,11/12/2017,"Didnt know about this place until my inlaw's relative invited us here for dinner. It is tucked away from bustling tourists and when we came here on a sunday night it wasnt very crowded. They have coat service and the ambiance was between casual-upscale in my opinion. We were still very full from lunch so we didnt order much from the entree selections. The servings for the fried calamari was good enough to share for 3-4 people however taste wise, i think i've had better. The bread starters were very good, they were light, fluffy and buttery which instantly reminded me of a croissant. Next, i complimented their tuna tartar which had very good flavor; was very fresh and tasty. My husband had the spicy crab beignets and those were pretty delicious. They came in four pieces almost like the size of a french macaroon but only thicker from the crab meat. Surprisingly, despite the sweetness of the beignets the crab meat blended very well with the dough.",2,1,3,Kimberly T.,"Lincoln Park, NJ",267,151,1727

I ate the spicy crab beignets, they were unlike anything I've had before. Crazy delicious! Do yourself a favor and dine here.",0,0,0,Shannon E.,"Portland, OR",129,14,1
5.0,11/11/2017,Throwing the 5 bomb to my old friends at Tao Group. One of the best Seafood meals I have had in a long time..The large tower was ridiculous!! Great service drinks/wine and dessert. Reasonable Prices..Trendy scene but more subtle than other hot spots... Can't wait to come back!,0,0,1,Michael D.,"New Hope, PA",89,69,24
1.0,11/8/2017,"The food is excellent and the ambiance was great. However, it took them 45 minutes to take our order, and over two and a half hours to get our food. Each time we ordered a round of drinks, that also took between 30-40 minutes. We had to complain a few times, until eventually the manager came and comped us a round of drinks and our entrees. Certainly they acted appropriately and were very apologetic, however someone at our table had a similar experience three weeks prior. Would be a great spot if they can get their act together!",2,2,1,Jason R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0

5.0,11/5/2017,"New restaurant owned by Tao group at Moxie Hotel. Awesome food, awesome chill vibes, they have a bar area, restaurant area, relaxed lounge area with foosball table. Place is pretty large. Next door is Magic Hour which is a nice rooftop bar, great for weekend after dinner drinks. Food was actually really good. The bread they start you with was so soft and delicious that I asked them to give me half a dozen to go! I think this place is going to be a big hit, especially because everything else is condensed into meatpacking, this gives an alternative to those living closer to midtown east. Highly recommend!!",2,0,1,Jon L.,"Brooklyn, NY",182,144,350
5.0,11/5/2017,"Highly recommend!  My girlfriend and I went to Legasea for a 6:45PM reservation on a Saturday evening and had the best time!Ambiance:  Very trendy as is such with the Tao Group restaurants.  Decor was almost identical to CatchNYC in MePa.  Restaurant was busy but not too crowded at that time.    Food:Food was delicious!  We ordered the calamari and the trio dip for appetizers and had the Red Snapper and Fish and Chips for our main dishes.  The fish was so tender, flavorful and cooked to perfection.  Best part is that it came in HUGE proportions, so bring your appetite!  Bonus:  The bread rolls were so buttery rich!  I could have filled up on those alone!   Service:  Service was impeccable.  The wait staff was kind and very attentive.  They offered great suggestions.",2,1,1,Richard H.,"Manhattan, NY",485,11,30

4.0,10/19/2017,"Legasea is great addition to Midtown West! It has an excellent vibe and wait staff.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Roasted Crab Claws, Large Shrimp, and Tempura Squash as appetizers.  My girlfriends and I also indulged in a signature cocktails that were more sugary than expected.  We were curious as to why there was chicken and biscuits on the menu and that was our least favorite item ordered.  After dinner we took a walk to the Magic Hour Lounge and boy oh boy what a gem!!! Very fresh and playful scene.  These additions to the TAO Group are sure to be the talk of town.",1,1,1,Rakeyah E.,"New York, NY",0,4,1
