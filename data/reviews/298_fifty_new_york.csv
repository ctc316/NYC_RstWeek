4.0,12/24/2018,"When fifty and fifty gives you more than one hundred...Located in West Village of New York City at 50 Commerce Street, Fifty brings a personalized mixture and twist of new-American and South American to the neighborhood. As the chef-partner of Fifty, Luis Jaramillo, who hails from Ecuador and has immigrated to New York and has lived here since for over twenty years, completely takes the best of each of the two worlds to create a unique culinary experience for everyone. He sets out to share his stories and celebrate his culture as he takes his guests on a customized Ecuadorian trip through each dish on the restaurant's seasonal menu.Upon entering the restaurant, the classical yet elegant interior design with modern elements accompanied by a calm and relaxed atmosphere immediately captures your attention. It certainly enhances the overall dining experience.Starting with one of the snacks, Smoked Trout Deviled Eggs, it was simply delicious. This snack contains and relates to chef Jaramillo's childhood story of a boy fishing by the water as a kid and the fish caught would be used for this snack. The Chorizo stuffed Green Plantain Empanadas are made with no flour, therefore making it gluten-free. These bites are starchy, unlike your typical empanadas, and when chorizo blends in with each bite, it truly is an enjoyable snack, one eaten by the coast according to the chef.The Striped Bass Crudo is presented beautifully with the striped bass placed over a sea of passion fruit sauce and topped with candied peanuts, scallions and chili powder. Citruses are usually used for ceviche but the use of passion fruit as the sauce of this appetizer was because the fruit is very popular and plays an important role in the rainforest. The chili powder gives it an extra kick of spiciness and the sauce perfectly balanced out the spice and provided a tangy and tarty taste to each bite. Also, no one really uses peanuts with raw fish. But the decision to do so added a crunch to the layers of textures, and overall, giving it a very charming aroma and flavors that no one can reject or resist.The Grilled Mediterranean Octopus is served with octopus tentacles laying over mash potatoes. The octopus tentacles are mixed and brushed with spices, inspired by the idea from the skewers sold on the streets in Ecuador. The skewers are usually served with onions and peppers. The Shrimp ""Encocao"", shrimp in coconut milk with infused lemongrass and pepper, quinoa, and plenty of garlic. The coconut milk-ginger broth is undeniably amazing and leaves you wanting more after each bite.For entrees, the Shrimp and Calamari Black Rice displayed the bringing back to life of a diminishing family tradition. The black rice is chef Jaramillo's take on the crispy rice, Cocolon, which sticks to the bottom of the pot when his mom or grandma cooks. In Ecuador, there is a tradition where the crispy rice is saved and served to a lucky person at the table. He aims to bring back this homey dish with the addition of extremely fresh ingredients like shrimp, calamari and uni.One of the desserts is a homey rendition of flan, something that everyone in Ecuador loves and enjoys. The other dessert is a chocolate cake made from Ecuadorian cacao fino de aroma, one of the best cacaos in the world.The menu of Fifty has been infiltrated and infused deeply with stories and heritage of chef Luis Jaramillo. He has extracted interesting aspects of where he's from and what he has experienced as a kid and intertwined it with a new-American fare, creating a menu that ""showcases local, seasonal ingredients complemented by bold, ethnic flavors from his home country and surrounding South American regions.""This Ecuadorian-American culinary experience is extremely successful and pleasurable, knowing that it is the best of both backgrounds; something truly innate and special, like the blood and DNA that runs through and defines a person, and sharing that with a new and distant audience using innovative techniques, seasonal and fresh products.This experience is one with the best of both sides, it is Ecuadorian-American; The Ecuayorker.",0,0,0,Tom L.,"Brooklyn, NY",128,129,935
5.0,12/16/2018,I am dismayed to report that this restaurant is closed. We attended a show at the nearby Cherry Lane theater a while back and decided to have a drink at Fifty before the show.  We enjoyed the atmosphere so much we went back for dinner after the show. We now have made it our go-to restaurant whenever we attend a performance at Cherry Lane.   We were going to a play last night so I had tried making a reservation through OpenTable and I even tried calling to no avail.  Sure enough when we got there last night it was closed!!  What a shame!!,1,0,0,Maureen J.,"BREEZY POINT, NY",0,17,0

5.0,9/26/2018,"I'm not sure how I can across this place but I'm glad I did. It's down a small side street makes it feel like a movie set, pretty cool area. The vibe is really upbeat but if you wanted to have a little 1 on 1 evening this place can fit the bill for that as well. The food was very flavorful and fast service. The staff was extremely friendly and quick to assist with any request. I'd say this place on the location alone is worth visiting then the food plus service you have to stop in. Start off with the Tuna a combination of flavor like you've never had. I almost ordered a second round of it but had to contain myself. Hope this helps.",0,0,1,Rome D.,"Walnut Creek, CA",9,132,118
4.0,9/5/2018,"While difficult to surpass its predecessor, Fifty  surprised us with their outstanding food and genuinely warm staff.   Gone are the oversized Mexican Muralism panels, replaced by low releif  Art Deco motifs.  The lighting was pleasantly dimed  throughout the evening as soft Latin music  completed the ambience.  Having been open coming up on  two years, Fifty remains an up-and-coming West Village haunt, keeping up with it's heavy-hitting neighbors such as RedFarm and Barbuto with ease. Nestled in the fold of Commerce Street, Fifty is hugged by idelic pre-war brick walk-ups and the Cherry Lane Theater who, rumor has it, will begin stocking their concession stand with bites made in chef Luis Jaramillo's kitchen.  Having made such sweet memories of lively warm dinners surrounded by family and friends, it is good to know that the future will hold more of such occasions, in the little restaurant on Commerce Street, now called Fifty.",0,0,0,Amanda Z.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",7,12,6
5.0,8/25/2018,"I had reserved a table before my Cherry Lane show....nice surprise ,it was next store! The waiter was so attentive with everything. The menu was a little limited which I kind of likes. I chose from each section. I wanted to try the deviled egg off the snack listing. NOT YOUR MOTHERS DEVILED EGG! A taste explosion...wonderful. My api was the ceviche which was not 100% ""raw"" nevertheless it hit it out of the park...an incredible dish. My main was Chicken from Sullivan County,my old home town. Again wonderful....so different. All I could say to the waiter was everything was ""special"". Shame on me for ordering so much but I had the dirty corn for the side...not to be missed. Ask for the dollop on the side.  I saw a couple in the theater later that just had drinks at the bar earlier.

3.0,8/23/2018,"To be perfectly honest, this place was pretty average. Not bad, but not standout in any way either. I came here with a group of friends, 8 of us total. We made reservations beforehand, but the restaurant wasn't that busy anyway. Despite it not being that busy, the service was super slow. They also only gave us one drinks menu to share between the 8 of us. At least give two, one for each side of the table! I had the red snapper with shrimp curry. It was fine? The snapper itself was cooked well, but the flavors of the dish as a whole were pretty underwhelming. I've had much more impressive fish dishes at lower price points. My boyfriend had the empanada and the ceviche. He loved the empanada, but the ceviche was, again, average. There wasn't a ton of actual seafood in it and it was a bit watery, but the flavor was good. To be fair, though, our standards for ceviche are really high! The ambience and decor here are very nice, but unfortunately I just wasn't impressed enough to ever come back.",0,1,1,Sarah H.,"New York, NY",227,144,298

5.0,7/28/2018,"The food here was phenomenal, we had the octopus app which was a great start. Then they brought out the goat ribs which were incredible and finally the duck with a side of dirty corn.

The location is probably one of my faves in the city, tucked away on a quiet street next to the Cherry Lane Theatre. So comfy and relaxing. My only gripe was with the lighting. The restaurant was beautiful but they kept the lights on high the ENTIRE night. I kind of felt like I was in a corporate conference room at the Ramada Inn.

5.0,2/27/2018,"As other people have said already, what a great find. We had walked past this place a few times and thought of going in. We only live around the corner so we bit the bullet. The way I would describe this is, food with serious bold south/Central American flavour, without over complication. Dishes are presented simply with straight forward ingredients but in a combo are very powerful. We started with the chorizo empanadas which had a fantastic mint yoghurt dressing, and the ceviche. Civeche had a great kick to it. Fish itself was great. Wife had the calamari and shrimp and myself the hanger steak. I really enjoyed mine, was just enough food, chimichurri was top notch. Wife loved the shrimp which was slightly more shuttle but equally as good. See attached photos. Service was ace as well.

5.0,2/14/2018,"What a great find! This restaurant is nestled on a quiet street in West Village, and I never would've heard of it if it weren't for my friend. We came here on a Saturday night in a group of 16 for a birthday dinner. Management was super accommodating in letting us (really, him - I played no part in the planning) make the reservation with relatively short notice, and we didn't have to order a prix fixe menu either.I came early, so started off with a drink at the bar. The Fenix cocktail looked innocuous on the menu, but came with a really spicy kick (it was still delicious). At the table, I ordered a gin-based drink which was also quite good.Everyone at the table - yes, all 16 of us - loved the food that we ordered, and we sampled a good portion of the menu. I split the octopus, ceviche, and brussels sprouts with two others for apps and had the shrimp & calamari black rice for my main. Everything I had was so, so good. The black rice had the best part of a traditional paella - the soccarat, or crispy bottom - mixed with generous helpings of squid, shrimp, and even uni. Someone else at the table couldn't stop raving about her goat ribs. Same with everyone who ordered the duck. Most of us were too stuffed after this for dessert, but they brought out a complimentary slice of chocolate and peanut cake for the birthday boy, which was a nice touch to end the meal.",1,0,1,Yuting Z.,"Manhattan, NY",435,332,543
4.0,2/11/2018,"What an unexpected experience from arriving at this hidden gem down a curved U-shaped street I never heard of, but properly lit at the end of the road as it was heavily raining and dark everywhere else. The ambience was beautiful. The menu size was small but it makes sense because the attention to detail was well thought out. The Felix cocktail was surprisingly spicy but the passion fruit flavor was perfect. The beer braised goat ribs were sooooo soft and tender, they fell off the bone. Wish there had been more of a side (the quinoa, avocado, and sweet plantain were tiny). We were a party of 16 and I'm assuming that's why everything took an hour to arrive but it was worth it. I was not planning on getting dessert but a few others did so I ordered flan. It was the creamiest and sweetest flan I've ever tasted. The hints of salt on top were also pleasantly unexpected. I'm always looking for exciting Latin restaurants as a Latina myself. I am very picky but this place is a new addition to my list!",0,0,0,Gladys P.,"Manhattan, NY",102,4,0
2.0,2/6/2018,Extremely disappointing! We went for restaurant week. Our waiter was pretty poor. When I asked him about tile fish and he compared to swordfish I asked about mercury levels. His response was not the fish in our restaurant:)The appetizer was a potato soup. It was Too stew like with big pieces of potato and too much sour cream.The entree was awful. A shrimp and calamari dish that included this weird roe that had an awful taste. There was just one piece of shrimp and a few calamari... the rest was this mushy quinoa.The dessert was a dry chocolate cake with way too much unsweetened whipped cream. Only plus... topped with salted caramel and peanuts that were tasty.When our waiter saw that I left most of my dish he never said a word. And though I asked about dairy in the soup he never mentioned the dessert or ask about food sensitivities the way they do in most fine restaurants these days.We ate here once before and really enjoyed the small plates.

4.0,2/6/2018,"Came here for restaurant week and was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was! Started with the salad which was decent but the potato soup was better I think.

5.0,1/27/2018,"All I can say is WOW! Came in on a Saturday night with a group of 5 and we ordered only food so cannot comment on the drinks. Definitely would recommend sharing with the table as you'll want to try everything. The food was consistently delicious. I don't think I can say that about too many restaurants. Given consistency of amazing food and minor issues with service, I have to rate something along a 4.5 but a 4 would be an injustice.Service: 4/5 I have mixed feelings. They were prompt and changed out your plates when moving between apps and mains, but they forgot to serve our burrata with the other apps so we had to change plates AGAIN. They were inconsistent with the table on switching out silverware (some of us got new forks and knives, others didn't). They were sort of pushy on getting drinks at the beginning and didn't seem to like it when we didn't want a bottle of wine while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive.Apps:Burrata: 3/5 Yumm. I mean burrata is in itself amazing so in a way hard to do wrong. Topped with pistachios, you get a measly 4 slices of bread and some pear/apple compote. I'm okay with that given I could eat it by itself, but I didn't sense too much oompf on this dish. Vegetables:Broccoli - 5/5 OMG I loved this. The entire table agreed. I'm generally not a huge fan of mustard sauces, but it complemented the crunchy cheese crisp and anchovies in the dish. The broccoli is served in giant half crowns so you'll have to use knives to eat it. Each half is grilled/charred so extra flavor on this.Mushrooms - 4/5 - Pretty darn good. Didn't blow me away as much as the salad and broccoli but was tasty for sure. There's a creamy truffle sauce on the bottom but it isn't overpowering in flavor. House Salad - 5/5 this is by NO means your typical bland simple salad. It's flavorful, exciting and filled with crunchy, tangy and interesting ingredients. Topped with a decent layer of cheese, but still feels refreshingMain:Black Rice + Shrimp and Calamari - 5/5 Okay this is actually the favorite of the night and agreed by entire table. We would come back just for this dish. The rice is somehow crispy/crunchy despite there being a bunch of sauce/things in the dish. The seafood was a complement, but not too fishy which was great. Just order this.Goat Ribs - 4/5 Flavorful and SO very tender. Fall off the bone is exactly what this is. Was very saucy and the avocado and plantain felt like they were just add ins, so didn't really add too much to the dish. The ribs really gave this dish a 4 star because the other things weren't as impressive.",0,0,0,Steph H.,"New York, NY",95,49,38

4.0,12/21/2017,"Came here for an early dinner after seeing a show at the Cherry Lane Theater---very convenient since it's right next door. We got there right when they opened (5:30) and had the whole restaurant to ourselves for awhile. It's a very romantic atmosphere with lots of candles and they dimmed the lights later in the evening. Service was attentive, though somewhat brusque (or at least our server was). I saw some other servers who seemed friendlier. As for the food...I thought it was very well prepared. For an appetizer we had the tuna crudo ($19). The tuna was fresh and I really liked the addition of the daikon (wish there had been more avocado though). The crisped rice was fun too. It could have been a bigger portion, but it was a tasty dish nonetheless. For dinner I had the duck confit---with deliciously crispy skin, this dish was a winner! I don't think it quite fits with the ""Latin American"" theme of the restaurant, though, because it seemed to be more of a French cassoulet. It was served in a skillet with beans and a rich sauce and the interesting addition of cilantro. My husband had the salmon with a parsnip puree and he liked it, but didn't rave about it. It seemed fresh/healthy, if a little bland. Both dinners were around $30, which brings me to my main quibble with this restaurant. The food and drinks were very good, but $5-$10 overpriced in my opinion. That $14 glass of wine really should have been $8. I do understand that this is NYC, but I don't quite know if it was ""worth it"" for the price.

The restaurant is located on a beautiful street in a charming neighborhood straight out of a movie scene. The vibe is elegant but quaint and so New York chic. I took my mom back here after recently having moved to the city and fortunately we were able to get a reservation last minute.

5.0,8/7/2017,"Perfect choice for restaurant week. My friend and I had dinner last Friday, and from hostess to paying the check, everything was fantastic. Great service, but even better was the food!I started with the cebiche with popcorn. I'm not a fan of popcorn, so I didn't like that element, but the shrimp itself was delicious. Crisp and spicy flavor on the shrimp, very refreshing! My friend had the ricotta with the tomatoes, and that was SO good as well. Perfectly seasoned, and a great balance with the cheese, tomatoes, and the bread (so chewy!).We both had the black rice with seafood, and it was so delicious, I scarfed it down so quickly. Perfect marinade on the dish, with a perfect ratio of seafood to rice. And the uni! So well done--nice balance and a perfect top to the dish. The rice was unexpected for me--a bit crisp, which was a great texture with the umami flavor of the dish.Strawberry tart was also great, nothing to write home about, but definitely a strong dessert.All in all, loved my experience!",3,0,1,Anita O.,"Brooklyn, NY",62,41,2
5.0,8/1/2017,"Some of the most flavorful food I've ever had! For our appetizers we ordered the shrimp cebiche and fried calamari. The calamari was good, but was amazing with the paired sauce. The cebiche had some much flavor and shrimp was very fresh. For the entree, we ordered the steak and shrimp/calamari black rice. Best part of the meal! The shrimp/calamari black rice had a perfect umami flavor and the texture of the rice was unexpectedly crunchy, but ingenious! The desserts were nice - the strawberry tart could have used more fresh strawberries and less sugary syrup for a more balanced flavoring, but the banana dessert was a lovely surprise! All in all, we loved the ambience and service, but the food blew us away!",1,0,0,Joan Z.,"Houston, TX",5,7,0
5.0,7/25/2017,"Second day of restaurant week, and yet another fantastic experience. I chose this restaurant because of the interesting menu, and the fact that I rarely, if ever, eat Latin American food. The restaurant is hidden away in a winding street in west village, but even on a Tuesday evening it was super full and bursting with noise. I got here at 6:15 which was a bit early, but many people starting coming in for the bar at around 7:30, and that's when the music (early 90s btw) turned up and the people got really loud. It's a bit dressy in that most people are coming in for drinks after work, but the atmosphere is super casual and relaxing. I got a nice seat in the corner where the lighting was excellent, but it was right next to the bar area.Smoked trout deviled eggs- part of the regular menu at $3 each deviled egg. I ended up getting 2, and they were well worth the price. It was a delicious bite of spiciness and savoriness, with a nice crunch from the trout skin I believe. The roe, which I assume is trout, was absolutely delicious. The texture and the firmness of it was amazing - a lot better than some of the ikura I've had at sushi places. I highly recommend this item (I wish I got more).Market tomato salad- a huge portion of ricotta cheese, marinated tomatoes, and 4 tasty slices of sour dough. The portion size was much larger than I expected (which is great cuz I love eating), and it was absolutely delicious. The ricotta was super fresh and tasty, and the tomatoes were actually out of this world. They were incredibly juicy and flavorful - I dare say the best tomatoes I've ever had? The sourdough was nice and freshly grilled, and it went great with the cheese and the tomatoes. I highly highly recommend this.Shrimp and calamari black rice- it was my first time having black rice, and it was damn delicious. The closest I've come to black rice is forbidden rice maybe, where the texture is a bit harder than normal white rice. This black rice however was super crunchy, almost like quinoa, but far superior in taste and size. It comes with a bunch of calamari and shrimps, as well as a generous topping of uni. The dish itself was amazing - Great texture contrast between the rice and the seafood, and the sofrito was great. The seafood was so fresh, and the shrimps were perfectly poached. My only complaint is that the dish was a tad bit on a saltier side, but overall a super strong entree for restaurant week.Strawberry tart- very lovely presentation, where the tart is placed on a bed of strawberry sauce. The tart itself was super nice, and I loved loved loved the cream filling. The strawberries were sweet and not sour at all. Great way to end my meal.Overall one of my favorite restaurant week experiences by far. The food was absolutely delicious, and the service was phenomenal. Someone came over every so often to check up on me and how I liked the food. I highly recommend coming to Fifty to try their restaurant week menu, because they clearly put their best foot forward and offer their best for this summer RW.",5,0,1,Kevin C.,"Queens, NY",234,140,1516

The fried banana and the purple potato chips went really well with the octopus which was perfect consistency and tasted amazing when all in one bite. For an entree I had the salmon a la plancha- which also came with pickled asparagus, fennel, and pink peppercorn. Looked aesthetically pleasing as well as having a decadent taste. For me the salmon could have been cooked a tad longer (I'm a ""well-done"" type of person) but it gave the salmon a great flavor and consistency, not dry at all (which is what i'm used to when cooking at home hehe).For dessert we shared the caramel sea salt flan- Great choice!This restaurant is not recommended for families with young children or a ""quick bite to eat"".

Photogenic and the perfect starter bite to any meal, salty and tart, this is a must.Maitake mushrooms - savory and refreshing at the same time, really opens your appetite to the heavier dishes on the menuShrimp & calamari black rice - not the most photogenic dish, however, the crunchy black rice and aioli combo is addictive.

Our waiter was informative, witty, and attentive.  He recommended the Bloody Marys which according to my husband and cousin (both Bloody Mary connoisseurs ) were the best they've ever sampled.  Each of our three entrées were spot on delicious  -- the dry aged cheeseburger my husband ordered was cooked a perfect medium rare, juicy  and  super flavorful.  My cousin had a braised pork shoulder she totally enjoyed, and I was pleased with my spicy tuna and avocado toast.  For dessert, we had missed out on the popular flan, but there was still a yummy chocolate cake we all shared.  It was super rich with hidden bits of chocolate inside.  The cake was enveloped in a light fresh whipped cream that was heavenly.  It may sound clichéd, but it was indeed the perfect ending to a perfect meal.  I would highly recommend brunch at Fifty, and am looking forward to returning for dinner.",0,0,0,Sharon J.,"New York, NY",1,12,1
5.0,5/7/2017,"Really amazing service, first and foremost. Our bartender was super charming, our waiter had the patience of a saint, as we gabbed away, and no one took plates while we were still grazing or rushed us in any way. I love that. When it's not there you notice, but when it is there it can be taken for granted. Nice compact wine list with a good selection. Cocktails looked quite nice too. Food was great. Even the one dish we didn't love (the scallops; they were ceviche with huge buglike crisps layered over them. Why waste good scallops? tbh. All I tasted was cilantro; it was def my bad for not more closely reading the description) was well done and elegantly presented. Loved the beet pistachio goat cheese. That should be served everywhere. ;) overall something for everyone, mixed American/European cuisine. The volume and ambiance was buzzing but not loud; adorably, the average 45-50+ crowd were constantly breaking out their iPhone flashlights for reading the menu. It's adorable that is until one of the searing rays burns your eyes out. Maybe Fifty needs stronger candles. Would absolutely return.",2,2,2,Claire F.,"Brooklyn, NY",430,700,206
5.0,4/24/2017,"Amazing food and service tucked away in an adorable West Village corner.  I came here on a double date with my boyfriend and another couple, and we were all impressed.  We had a reservation for 7:00 pm, but it seemed to not fill in until about halfway through our meal.  If you're on the early side, you'll probably be fine without one.  Also they now have Bar Bites Sun-Thu from 5:30-7 pm, which seems like a great way to try a few smaller plates and drinks. Wine: Most of the bottles are pretty spendy ($70/$80+), but my boyfriend and I decided to try a red from Mendoza, Argentina which was $45-$48, and it was great!  Super fruit-forward and complimentary to our dishes.  That being said, the cocktail menu looked fabulous as well, they're $15 each. Appetizers & Small Plates: The smoked trout deviled eggs exceeded all expectations, particularly the crispy skin on top.  The roasted maitake mushrooms did not disappoint, and the grapes were a solid addition to the dish.  The house made burrata itself was good, but combined with the toast and apple/basil/persimmon compote the dish became almost mindblowing. Between the 4 of us, we each had a deviled egg, split the burrata and mushrooms and each ordered an entree.  In hindsight, the mushrooms may not be the greatest thing to split within a group, there was a fair amount of cutting involved (but no regrets). Entrees: The guys both went with the goat ribs, which came with sweet plantain, farro, and avocado.  It's a great combination of flavor, and there seemed to be a good amount of meat on the ribs.  The other 2 of us tried the grilled hanger steak.  I asked for medium rare and it was perfectly prepared.  The chimichurri was excellent, potatoes were crisp and delicious, and the shishito peppers brought it all together nicely.  I ate my entire entree (not something I generally accomplish), but definitely did not have room for dessert (guess we'll just have to come back...).",9,1,1,Sarah B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",202,138,297

Didn't think much of it until I got home and had very very runny diarrhea (not as fast as Usain Bolt but pretty close) 30 minutes after leaving the restaurant. I didn't have anything to eat between lunch (1230p) and dinner (7p), which to me meant that something was wrong with the food.Left a note with the restaurant to tell them about this. Then I got a call from the chef (which was nice) insisting that the call was NOT to apologize - they definitely know the terrible wrath that is going to descend upon the restaurant if the customer mistakenly heard an apology lol. Further, he stressed that the restaurant take cleanliness very seriously several times, and that he tasted the food and it felt fine so that it is NOT their fault. And he was very reluctant to do anything to amend the situation. This is a very jarring experience compared to what is expected from a place of their price point. 90% not going back...  10% if the management changed.

From Tupac to Duran Duran to Marvin Gay to Frank Sinatra to Rhianna.  Anyways, I digress...The place itself is tucked in a side street in the West village. It's a romantic atmosphere but also great for a group for friends catching up (in my case, old college roommates).  The food was simply perfect.

We all commented about how flavorful this was.  Also got grilled hanger steak cooked medium rare...excellent. Both of these were good portions, in my view but maybe small for some.I'm running out of adjectives, as I always tend to do.  But last but not least, we got both of the desserts available  - flan and chocolate cake.

4.0,12/18/2016,"FOOD.  It was good.  Ordered the sautéed broccoli rabe to start. It had good flavor and the right amount of heat with the red pepper flakes.  The only negative I had was you can only eat so much of it until you didn't want it any more. Sharing it with the table is better.For the meal, shrimp and calamari black rice. It had such a good balance of flavor and there was a nice crunch to the rice.  But the same negative occurred with this dish...as I continued eating the sauce became too much where I didn't want to keep eating. But overall it's a good dish.A friend ordered the pork chop and it was delicious. The pork was on the bone and well cooked/had a nice tenderness to it.Dessert was flan and a chocolate cake. Both were delicious. I favored the chocolate cake more because it was rich and decadent. SERVICE. Good service. The server was helpful in explaining the menu items and suggestions.   He was attentive but not overbearing.AMBIENCE. Casual.  Looking from the outside in it had potential to be a level above casual but once inside the vibe was laid back. Noise level was average.",0,0,0,J T.,"Pittsburgh, PA",55,49,0

She must have noticed how uncomfortable we were - now that's a hostess who knows her job, we felt like VIPs!! From there on we had a fantastic experience.

The food was even better. We tried several different dishes and all didn't last on the table long. The burrata was fresh and delicious, paring excellently with the fig and Lambrusco.

4.0,12/1/2016,"Overall, a nice, modern remake of the old Commerce space.I recalled that Commerce was deathly cramped back in the day, and the spacing between tables has drastically improved. The space is also much more dimly-lit, and the general vibe is much more modern and intimate, which I really liked.Our favorites:- Burrata with figs and balsamic: Just a solid dish, executed perfectly, and a healthy amount of burrata for our table- Scallop crudo with uni and coconut milk: Prob the most memorable dish of the night, and all the flavors really came together quite well- Whole trout with crispy potatoes: Suprisingly meaty, and the potatoes were a good contrast of texture overall- Hanger steak: Perfect medium rare, and the grilled flavor really came through. Chimichurri wasn't overpowering and the aioli underneath provided even more richness, which was welcomedThe only less-than-favorable dish was the tomato braised goat ribs with farro, which had a good texture, but the tomatoes made it way too acidic, coupled with the slight gaminess of the goat, just wasn't a good mix.Our waiter was very friendly and re-assuring, mostly about the timing of all the courses and getting our cocktails. While I did find the meal very nicely paced, we actually barely saw our initial waiter the whole night, which was a bit strange, Nevertheless, the rest of the waitstaff definitely helped chip in, and we were never lacking for attention. Prices are on par with the old Commerce, but the modern takes are very well-executed, and the value is pretty solid.I really enjoyed my experience, and I'm looking forward to see what else they have to offer in the future.

4.0,11/22/2016,I went here for dinner last night with my boyfriend and overall we really enjoyed our food and the ambiance. We ordered two smaller dishes to start which were the goat cheese and beet salad and then the Brussels sprouts. Both were way bigger portions than we expected and were really good. To be honest I probably could have stopped there but we had already ordered the duck special and the hanger steak. I am not a duck fan but my bf really enjoyed it. My hanger steak came out way more rare than I expected and wasn't super happy about it. I would suggest that next time the waiter ask if a rare Cook is ok with whoever is ordering. Would have saved some distress on the customers end. Overall thought I would go back to try some more of the smaller plates.,0,0,0,Brenna B.,"New York, NY",132,134,39
5.0,11/21/2016,"First off- our server was probably one of the best waiters I have had in NYC. I forgot his name- darnit, but was really impressed by his enthusiasm for the menu as well as his honesty with how many dishes to pick. Everything at Fifty is meant to be shared, which is great because it helps you work your way through the menu. A group of six, we had been recommended to order 11 dishes. It isn't cheap by any means, but the chefs clearly take pride in their food and pay exquisite attention to detail.We enjoyed pretty much everything we tried. Memorable dishes included the maple bacon brussel sprouts, the scallops and the unbelievably tender octopus. The tuna crudo was lovely with the added pop of crunchy quinoa. The burrata with fig had us licking the bottom of the plate. The whole trout was also fantastic. It was covered in fresh herbs and was perfectly deboned. I'm pretty sure someone consumed the face as well. The crispy broccoli was the only thing I didn't love (a cheese yuzu sauce combo wasn't quite my thing), but everything else was so darn good.Definitely finish off with the snickers lover's dessert!

Loved everything we ordered though tapas style is on the pricier side but the portions are bigger than expected.The scallop crudo is an absolute delicate must.  The octopus was tender. The tuna crudo was probably might least favorite but that's not saying much.The Brussels sprouts were cooked Perfectly.

4.0,10/17/2016,"4.5 stars. Other than a few faulty dishes, our experience at Fifty was spectacular. I need to say at the outset that this review may feel minimalist, because as a part of five going to a shared plates spot, we ordered just about everything on the menu--and all of these dishes must be addressed. The service also must be addressed, because it was some of the best service I've experienced--in New York and beyond. So before I jump in, I am going to strongly urge you all to try out Fifty if you're willing to drop a little more than you typically would on a meal out. The food is fresh, inventive and packed with flavor (the alcohol selection is seriously impressive,too), the decor is upscale but not stuffy/pretentious and of course, there's the total badassery that is the service here. Great for a celebration, GNO and/or a hot date. We came here as a party of five for my birthday dinner. Fifty's pretty new, so booking a rez was pretty easy. Definitely book ahead, though--this place is going get real popular, real soon. I noticed a few reviews commenting on the decor here--I actually liked it. Kind of understated modern. Though it's a big space (relative to most West Village restaurants), it still has a fairly intimate vibe......but it's quite possible that I only felt/feel this way because of our server/honorary guest of honor, Ross. Ross is either a genuinely gregarious and caring human or a scary good salesman. If I had to guess, I'd say it's a little bit of both. We're all very friendly by nature, so we were immediate fans of Ross's. When he told us that we were his favorite table of the evening, we were smitten. He checked up on us frequently, diligently refilled our water glasses and pushed us to drink just enough alcohol to get a good buzz going. The guy is great at his job. I say this in part because he did turn out to be trustworthy. During our evening at Fifty, he directed me towards the Market G&T and the Catcher in the Rye, which were both fantastic. I don't regret sticking with liquor for the night, but we did miss out on the IN-HOUSE SOMMELIER. In other words, Fifty takes its alcohol very seriously, birthday shots and and all. Food-wise, I'm forced to go rapid-fire given how many dishes ordered. All are shared plates style, though I will say that a number of these dishes were bigger than what you'll typically find at tapas spots. Keep this in mind while ordering. Smoked Trout Deviled Eggs: A++Best I ever had (thanks, Drake). Think you've made up your mind about deviled eggs? Just give one of these babies a try. They're quite small, so you're not committing to much. Good things come in small packages, folks. Tuna Crudo w/ Quinoa, Avocado, Scallion, Tamarind, Sesame Oil: A+Second best dish of the night. The seafood tartare/crunch quinoa combo is consistently fantastic. Incredibly flavorful, fun texture combo, light and fresh yet still wholly satisfying. My bf typically stays away from tartare but even he gave it high marks. Charred Broccoli w/ Calabrian Peppers, Parmesan Crisp, Anchovy: A-Not the prettiest dish but it's hard to go wrong with charred broccoli. Nothing too remarkable here but I still very much enjoyed it. If you're not an anchovy fan, don't worry--they're served atop the parmesan crisps so easily avoidable. Brussels: ASimilar to the charred broccoli, it's hard to really screw up roasted Brussels unless you undercook them or seriously over-season them. They're served with ""sauce gribiche"", which sounds like a more elegant way of saying trash juice but it was actually heavenly. Serves me right for being judgmental. Burrata w/ Roasted Fig, Basil, Lambrusco Vinaigrette: AEasy combo. Pro tip: make sure everyone in your party knows a) what burrata is and b) (conditional on a) they like burrata. 'Cause you get a ton of this goodness in this dish. Roasted Maitake Mushrooms w/ Truffle and Celery Root Puree, Grapes, Watercress: BAs a mushroom lover, I was disappointed by this dish. Great in theory, not so much in execution.Beets w/ Goat Cheese, Pistachios : A-This sees to be becoming a theme, but what's not to like? A tried and true combo here (though you could sub a number of different nuts and still get away with it) that even the beet-phobic diners enjoyed.Scallop Crudo w/ Uni, Coconut Milk, Red Onion, Shiso, Crispy Rice: ABeautiful preparation, thoughtful, light but still quite flavorful. Beef Tartare w/ Horseradish, Farro, Shallots, Slow-Poached Egg: B+Great texture, good flavors but they overdid it with the horseradish. Easily fixable, though. Butterflied Whole Trout w/ Sweet Potato: A- The whole fish, head and all. Simple preparation which I actually appreciated. Clean, fresh flavors. Mediterranean Octopus w/ Cilantro, Chickpea, Kalamata, Red Pepper: AGorgeous presentation, perfectly-cooked octopus. Shrimp/Calamari Black Rice: A+Really yummy. There was significantly more calamari than shrimp in our serving, but luckily the calamari held its own.",10,5,7,Molly T.,"New York, NY",887,464,1480
5.0,10/17/2016,"I've been here three times now so I thought it appropriate to review. Most recently, I took my parents while they were in town for a visit.  The cocktails were amazing to start the night. For appetizers, we had the Burrata, deviled eggs, and Broccoli Rabe. The Burrata was wonderfully fresh and perfectly paired with the figs. I'm glad they finally landed on this classic pairing instead of the sweet potato chips. The deviled eggs are to die for! We all wanted more! Lastly, the broccoli rabe was well cooked and seasoned. Always a favorite of ours.For our entrees, I had the pork chop which was cooked to perfection. If you don't pick up the bone... you're doing it wrong - it's the best part! Mom had the Shrimp and Calamari with Black rice which had to be the dish of the night. Incredibly flavorful. Dad had the trout which was a close second. Again, perfectly cooked and super fresh!For dessert, the bar staff created us deliciously sweet bespoke cocktails to pair with the decadent chocolate cake and tres leches flan.

3.0,9/26/2016,"I noticed this place during intermission at the Cherry Lane Theater down the street. The exterior really evokes a welcoming place and I figured, being solo, I'd stop in for a glass of wine or two (and maybe a nosh) after the show. It was a Sunday matinee, so the show was out a little after 5, just when Fifty opens its doors. Now, I know I'll have to relinquish my Hipster Card for going so early in the evening, but I'm 58-practically a senior citizen.First, the good news: attentive staff, warm atmosphere, great appetizers. I had two deviled eggs and two mini lobster rolls. Both choices were delicious and swiftly served. Aside from being a little self-conscious (I was the only patron in the place), everyone was friendly and made me feel welcome and relaxed.My only gripe is this: Once you've opened your doors for the day, you're OPEN. The ice well behind the bar should already be filled, service and bus staff should not be sitting at the bar commiserating until ""a decent amount of patrons show up and there's real work to be done"".  I felt as if I was watching them set up for the evening. The music was a little too loud and frenetic- perfect for getting the staff psyched for the evening, but not so much for diners. I have a feeling the tunes are toned down once the room fills up. That said, I'd definitely give Fifty another try when I'm in the area- (later in the evening, along with some friends).",0,0,0,James M.,"New Brunswick, NJ",0,4,0

This was a beautiful restaurant with old Depression-era murals, a lovely art-deco bar and a unique vibe.

One plate from each category and dessert was ample, and each delivered a unique set of presentation and taste.  To start, the deviled eggs were cute and unique, and the tuna carpaccio was quaintly decorated and just the right temperature.  Then the Burrata was absolutely to die for spread on delicious grilled toast and stacked with peaches.  Goat ribs were interesting: they were very tender and fell apart, but the flavor of the meat somewhat didn't stand alone.  Add the rice and greens and avocado trappings to a bite and all good.  The noticeable saltiness of the tres leches flan made a normally plain dessert special and memorable.Lastly, Ross was the icing on the cake, the bow that wrapped up the night or the finishing touch on the experience.  He's one of the coziest and friendliest servers in the business.I'm glad Fifty was able to be a part of her saying yes!",6,0,1,Bert F.,"San Francisco, CA",9,19,2

5.0,8/1/2016,"Have had a few meals here and they started off at a four star level but my last visit, they earned a five.  The deviled eggs are fantastic - complex mix of flavors that really please - was never much of a fan of deviled eggs but now I'm converted.  Maitake mushrooms are another standout.  The lobster rolls are dinner roll-sized and really get your appetite going - our group was oohing and aahing over these.  Tuna crudo has a nice bit of crunch.  The seafood larger plates are where I was really impressed in the last visit.  The trout is one of my favorites from prior visits, and has been perfectly cooked each time (harder than it sounds), but this time we went with the halibut and it was another stunner for the table.  Wonderfully tender and moist.  The goat ribs were also scrumptious - I love the tangy sauce, which finds perfect counterpoint in the dollops of avocado that are part of the dish.  Have never had goat in a restaurant of this caliber before but this is a great intro to it, and this dish seems to set this apart from your average NYC menu.  The roast chicken is very good, though I might've liked earlier renditions than the last time we got this - they seem to be evolving the recipe a bit.Have had very good service from both Amy and Ross - they were very attentive, knowledgeable and good about managing the progression of small plates to larger ones and making family style sharing for our group really make sense.  Wine service is great and Anna Christina really looks to find you your drink.  One of the people at our table had the Market G&T and loved it.  The wine list is well chosen, with original choices at reasonable prices, which is key as wine is a big part of the meal for me.Dessert choices were not wide but what we got was impressive.  We thought the tres leches flan was a knockout until we tried the chocolate cake, which was pretty awesome - I didn't catch what the sauce was but these desserts were both great and kept up the high level that the best appetizers and large plates had set.The space has a sophisticated look with clean lines and the 'cool kids' in our group were very into the music.  The bar scene seemed lively.  I'm not sure I agree with the category listed on Yelp - this is not really Latin American in my book; you're not getting an authentic 'ethnic food' experience - more New American or fusion with South American flourishes here and there.  Definitely worth checking out before word really gets out about this place.  Was still thinking about how good it was the next day.",4,0,3,Rex L.,"ASTORIA, NY",1,5,0
4.0,7/31/2016,"Came here for drinks and appetizers. My server was Amy, she  was fantastic and was able to make good recommendations.  The music was rockin with a mixture of hip hop and  pop. The restaurant itself is stunning. Every detail from the bathrooms to the bar area is gorgeous and so comfy.  They still need to work out some kinks but it is a great place to kick back and  have a good time.  Stick with the drink menu - lady bug and catcher in the rye are really delicious.  Tuna  with toasted quinoa is a must.",6,3,3,Cris V.,"Manhattan, NY",28,155,11
4.0,7/31/2016,"Great ambiance & music.Master mixologist behind the bar.LOVED the tuna (especially the crunchy quinoa on top)Liked the mini lobster roll (it is literally  a baby, bite-sized roll so get two or three if you can)The corn needs work. Too much bacon for my taste.I'm eager to try the octopus.Service was mixed but once we got Amy, we were in heaven. She treated us like royalty, was very honest, sweet and personable, and ensured our experience was amazing--including helping us celebrate a special occasion!We had only planned to grab a drink but ended up staying for much more.",8,2,2,Nancy G.,"Manhattan, NY",68,148,845
5.0,7/29/2016,"Really nice meal here.  Loved all the food we tried including the deviled eggs, lobster roll, corn side, octopus, tuna crudo and hanger steak.  Service was flawless from start to finish.  Wine service from Anna-Cristina was top-notch.  Can't wait to see what she does with the list and the back fifty.  Will definitely return to sample the rest of the menu.",3,0,2,John O.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,984,44
5.0,7/28/2016,Great place with even better people. The hostess's were sweet as I entered and the manager was a doll. I sat at the bar and had a to die for steak. I was extremely impressed with the wine selection and the managers knowledge on wine. The mixologist was also very impressive. Great new spot that I would recommend highly.,4,2,4,Danielle R.,"Manhattan, NY",115,3,0
