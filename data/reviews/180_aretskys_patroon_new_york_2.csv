5.0,4/23/2019,"What a restaurant should be!   Too often we adjust to cramped dining rooms, noise levels that force us to yell, and lack of attention by wait staff unless you stand on the table in a bikini giving out ten dollar bills.  Not so at Aretsky's Patroon!  The atmosphere is indeed swank.  They presented us with an amuse bouche that was a great start to the dining experience.The food was very tasty- we savored both  the duck and suckling pig.  We enjoyed a few glasses of wine over good conversation.  We were not rushed.  Of course, there is a price to pay, but definitely worth it for a special evening!",0,0,0,K M.,"New York, NY",0,26,0
5.0,4/23/2019,"Save room for dessert!  So the restaurant is fabulous - it's all excellent, from the warm and professional staff to the true cuisine.  The rolls will suck you in and your entree will be incredible, too.  But you need to hang in there - you don't want to skip dessert - not here.  It's brilliant.  Beautifully presented (seriously, it's art), unique and original every time and always with a creative twist on seasonal flavors.  My friend and I make up excuses to meet at Patroon and see what's new on the dessert menu.  This is THAT place where you plan to have dessert.",0,0,0,Gabrielle S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0
5.0,4/22/2019,"I've been here a few times now and it's a lovely restaurant with good food- and a great outdoor space! The best part by far is the desserts!!!! Although the Parker house rolls are a close second!The dessert menu has really inventive flavors and is creative and modern. Last time I had a chocolate dessert with kumquats and I still dream about it; whenever I come here I save room for pastries, or just skip right to dessert and cocktails!",0,0,0,Michelle J.,"Pasadena, CA",67,3,0
5.0,4/22/2019,"I had been to the rooftop bar with co-workers and friends many times over the last few years, but I had never eaten in the dining room.  The roof can be a little crowded and excited at times, but the cocktails and the sliders (and truffle fries) are great. Not to mention the space itself is lovely. So a friend and I tried decided to try the restaurant downstairs last Friday, and it is such a different vibe. Swanky, sexy, with live jazz and a great prix-fix menu. The food and the service were perfect...but the dessert...WAS DIVINE.  Having ordered the prix-fix, we were both surprised at the size of the desserts. But all the courses were good size so I guess we should have expected it. We went with the lemon meringue tart and the chocolate raspberry mousse.  The lemon was cute and perfectly tart and had this awesome caramel like a dulce de leche.  But the chocolate dessert was heaven.  It was so pretty and smooth and rich, and had these little crunchy dried raspberry bits that gave it a great texture and the sorbet cut through the dark chocolate.I grew up the daughter of a pastry chef and always have a sweet tooth, but often feel disappointed. So excited to have a place to bring my dad the next time he visits.",0,0,0,Margaret L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0

4.0,3/30/2019,"I came here for a work event, but apparently we weren't cool enough to just go up to the rooftop because you need, like, reservations or some shit like that (what's up with that?), so we wound up at the downstairs private bar, and can I tell you something? That place is swank! Like, leather and mahogany and Rich Uncle Bruce's rare Cuban cigars swank. Damn. I am so glad I didn't pay for any of my drinks.",3,0,1,Josephine L.,"Manhattan, NY",620,1619,20
5.0,3/5/2019,"SO SO SO SO GOOOOOODD!! Came here for Valentine's Day dinner and everything was amazing. You walk in and you're greeted by the hostess and offered coat check. When you walk into the main dining hall, everything seems classy and elegant so make sure to dress appropriately! The service was superb. A gentleman, looking to be the head waiter, always made sure we were doing well and had everything we wanted. Occasionally we would see him put on a chef hat and make a salad table-side for some patrons that were sitting at a table across from us, dinner and a mini-show!Another gentleman, seems like the owner, also came around towards the end of our dinner and went to each table to greet his customers. I thought that was amazing. I love when owners take out time to thank their patrons and see if there's anything else they can do to make your experience even better than it is. Seems like he knew a lot of the customers probably because they were regulars.  The star of the night was my 2 lb smoked lobster. It was soooo good and if it was more in my budget, I would literally eat this every week. The lobster was cooked PERFECTLY. Not overcooked, not chewy, just perfect. And the sauce on time was extremely good as well. I was very satisfied with my meal and on top of that, the service was great? 5 stars, no question asked!Since it was my first time there, I decided to venture to the above floors to check it out. On the 2nd floor they have private rooms that you can rent out for business meetings or other types of events. On the top floor, they have a rooftop bar. Relatively spacious and offers an indoor and outdoor area. I can't wait for the weather to warm up and come back to try the rooftop scene!",1,1,1,Mabelle L.,"Queens, NY",348,313,1720

5.0,1/31/2019,We had a fun time tonight!  The restaurant week meal was surprisingly good and exceeded  our expectations.  I definitely would come back for the fish or stew again. He steak was good too.   The only disappointing part were the  desserts.  We expected everything to be richer.   The mousse was flat.  The crepe brûlée was a little bit runny.,0,0,0,Mei T.,"Whitestone, NY",15,188,515

4.0,12/28/2018,"I was walking to work one day (running late) and ran into someone I used to work with at my old job. He wanted to catch up so we decided to meet here after work. It is so strange how in New York you are able to walk by all these places and just not notice it. This place was located on a street I walked by ALL the time. The place was on the fancy side. When I got there, the place was filled with men in suits just having a business meal/ drink. I mean, I was there for business myself so it made sense. However, this place is definitely a place you men can flex your muscles and show a lady a classy time as well. We sat by the bar, which is what I usually prefer. However, they have a rooftop during the summer, which seems to be popular with the younger crowd (mid-20s). Our bartender was so sweet. A jolly fellow that catered to my drinking needs. The food was delicious. From the pigs in a blanket to the sliders, everything was so deliciously done. The pisco sour was deliciously made. They put some berry.. I want to say acai? that made it special. It is bit on the pricey side so maybe try to go with someone that will expense it as a business meal?",1,1,0,Alice R.,"Manhattan, NY",10,111,4

4.0,11/11/2018,"Who is Aretsky and what is a patroon? I've always wondered and being a fan of history, had to begin my investigation prior to dining here.Let's start with ""patroon"". It's a Dutch word used by Dutch people who settled in these parts before the English. (And prior to losing it all during the Anglo-Dutch wars of the 1660s). A patroon is a landholder who was given manorial rights to vast tracts of land in New Netherland.  Aretsky refers to Ken Aretsky, restauranteur with an impressive resume with highlights including running the '21 Club'. So this building, this land is Aretsky's. It's a three level homage to power and understated luxury, a place where tradition feels alive, honored and respected. The menu reflects continuity with the past, with some acknowledgements of the present. Case in point, the availability of clams casino but also oxtail dumplings. I started with rock shrimp tempura, every bit as tasty as the one found at Nobu57.My drink of choice at an establishment like this had to be an old fashioned. I was asked the appropriate question of bourbon or rye. A well curated wine list resulted in an appropriate red for red meat as my main.And the red meat of choice was a grilled rack of lamb. Other options and temptations include suckling pig,  filet mignon, roast duck, dry aged ribeye for two and various fish dishes for the healthy eaters at your table. (There's always one)My lamb was joined by a goat cheese polenta and smoked eggplant, the perfect creamy complements to my lamb. Grilled to perfection, each bite reminded me of just how difficult it is to find a well executed lamb, hence the need to cherish such places.As you'd expect in such a restaurant, service was professional without pandering. I don't need or want to know the life story of the waiters nor should they linger too much to hear my conversation. A fine balance was struck at Aretsky's.The grand finale was a dessert selection that includes beignets, baked alaska, tortes, zabaglione and one called pumpkin spice. Opting for the latter, it was a rich autumnal harvest of sweet potato ganache and toasted marshmallows. Sizing was appropriate and in line with the previous courses: hardly all encompassing but a key component of a well balanced series of dishes. In other words, you want to order an appetizer, entree and dessert for the best possible experience. Bypassing one of these key steps and you may leave less than satisfied.The Monday night crowd was all business, a Midtown suit and tie establishment at its finest. My fellow diner and I joked about how eating at this place means we are the establishment now. A c-note and a half per person for a cocktail, appetizer, entree, bottle of wine, dessert and coffee. I'll be back to explore their rooftop in warmer weather.",7,3,4,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",337,820,47
5.0,9/16/2018,"Hidden gem in the middle of business area of manhattan. When I tried dinner, the place was not noisy but with relaxing live music. Overall the food was very decent - my friend and I tried both a famous statehouse and here for consecutive nights, and we both liked sophistication of each dish here more. Its very hard to find a spot where you can chill out and focus on enjoying food and conversation in the middle of manhattan without requiring reservation from way before, but I think this place is the one. Also tried lunch couple of times and they were nice experience too.",1,0,0,Jack T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",28,16,2

4.0,7/24/2018,"Went last night for Restaurant Week dinner.  Definitely recommend if you've ever wanted to dine at this establishment.We went with the additional $38 per person wine pairing, which is a great deal for the first 2 courses because you get a nice variety and the sommelier is very helpful.  However, we should've remembered that dessert would be paired with a port, which neither me nor my dining companion really like.  However, the pairing was still probably the most cost-efficient because while they have an extensive wine list, it's on the higher end of the price spectrum.The service and food were all great.  Very attentive and friendly.  We started with the calamari and wagyu beef tataki.  Totally recommend the beef appetizer, it's very different from the traditional version as the flavors of the caviar and oysters are really prominent.  For entrees I got the bass and my friend got the filet mignon (+6 supplement).  The filet mignon was the winning dish-so tender and wrapped with bacon. The bass was good too, delicate fish with crispy skin.  For dessert, my friend got the peach and i got the espresso chocolate. They're 2 very different choices.  If you're looking for something light, definitely get the peach.  If you prefer a sweet and rich dessert, then get the chocolate.$200+ dinner when including the wine pairing and tip. Not exactly the bargain that restaurant week can usually offer, but we left very full and a nice experience.",2,0,1,Tina M.,"Queens, NY",162,97,1052
3.0,7/5/2018,"Went here for lunch and wasn't too impressed. Don't get me wrong, the service is incredible and the ambiance was cool, but the food was just okay. I had the burrata app and the salmon and both were ordinary. I think I could have made a better version of both at home. The crowd was mostly old business types, and the waiters certainly catered to those patrons more so. The flatbread they put on the table was very had to eat and made such a mess.Overall, I would pass. There are much better places in the city!",1,0,0,Merisa H.,"Mineola, NY",110,68,60
4.0,6/7/2018,service was very professional and friendly. Some dishes were excellent while some were average. Dumpling soup in pic was excellent while fluke (white/green dish) was sub par.

5.0,5/27/2018,"This past week we hosted a family graduation celebration for our daughter at Aretsky's Patroon and we could no be happier with how the event went. The food was beyond amazing!  We selected the menu, and all the things we chose were fabulous. The crab cake I had as my starter is something I will be dreaming about, and will be the standard by which I measure all crab cakes from here on out. It was that good. The wine, the room, the desserts, all were just absolutely beautiful. The sommelier and service staff were kind and friendly, right there without hovering, and provided lovely service. The acoustics were excellent and we could hear one another well in the Match Room, an important reason why we had wanted to have a private dining space. Beyond the satisfaction that we could hear one another with ease, I felt the space was truly beautiful and very special feeling. A big part of our satisfaction with the grad lunch was how thoughtful and organized the private dining sales coordinator was in our correspondence. Victoria was super easy to work with, helped us plan for a wonderful and memorable event. If you are looking for a private dining space in Manhattan, I heartily recommend Aretsky's Patroon, and would choose them again in a heartbeat for a party or special celebration.",2,0,1,Melissa T.,"Los Altos, CA",0,11,3
4.0,5/2/2018,"Came here on a Friday evening at 745pm - my hubby, me and two friends (a couple). Place is very swanky. It is a relatively small dining room but it's cozy, and skews between romantic or a corporating outing feel. They have live music (classic jazz, and a nice rooftop for pricey but good drinks. We couldn't go up because the weather was icky.  Also, I suggest coming on a Friday because they have a $42 pre fixe, and also I easily booked on OPT and somehow got a 1000 points. Think it's more of a work feel here given the area so they're probably trying to get more on a Friday. I did have the pre fixe menu, and I got the:- Delicious French Onion Soup - awesome beef broth flavor, crusty cheese atop yum. Probably the best FO soup i ever had (it's so messy to eat!) -The bacon wrapped filet mignon. Med rare. It was more on the rare side but that was fine by me. No one should get a steak more than med rare, lol.  Honestly not sure the bacon - I'm not sure that it added much flavor and I normally go nuts for steak house bacon (it was steak house style just more cooked and crisped).  The filet however was great!  It came wth blue cheese atop. It looked like a small portion but was great for me. -Came with pomme anna which is a kind of a potato gratin type of thing, was yummy. I would have preferred a vegetable but alas they can't substitute for the pre fixe. Most others I was dining with got the pre fixe as well. The main being the filet mostly. My hubby got the wagyu beef stew, but it wasn't really a stew. It was like beef tips with root veggies on top of potato so that should have been clarified cause he was trying to do few carbs.As far as the appetizers; there were a lot of the octopus salad (delicious, grilled), and the root veggies salad (meh). The octopus salad or FO soup would be the best choices.We shared delicious, hearty vidalia onion rings for the table. They could have used more flavor but they were well fried and held up.The pre fixe comes with a good choice of desserts, and since we all got it we shared. Among a chocolate mousse, cake thing - I'm not a fan of chocolate so this wasn't for sure.  Then, a grapefruit shaved ice thing with ice - tart and refreshing.  Then, probably my favorite, strawberry shortcake which was not too sweet and on a biscuit. Came with green apple sorbet. You can wash it down with some good quality coffee.For $28 you can also do a sommelier wine pairing with the pre fixe, where you get two glasses of wine paired with what you're having. You can make a request on the style of wine you like but they will choose for you. I got a cab and.. I forget the other maybe syrah or shiraz. My other gf did the same and got a cab and rose. The men got amongst cocktails like Old Fashioned, and/or a large selection of bourbons. I could see this being a great space for events. I will say - if not for the pre fixe, they place is very very expensive.  I would argue more expensive than a lot of steakhouses that have real street cred in NYC. But it is a nice ambiance.",15,6,13,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",878,1242,25
1.0,5/1/2018,"Don't be mislead.This place used to be an upscale place, but quality is decreasing since last year.They promote themselves through Yelp events showing the nice Roof environment, but most people not on an expense report will not spend their own precious money going there.The Menu is not popular, with items that most people don't really enjoy.Food is pretentious and pricey.DO NOT waste your money just feeding their coffers, when there is no quality nor the food offers anything interesting or gourmet.There is no customer service, Managers don't offer any sympathy when dishes come wrong from kitchen.Only a light apologize and the client have to bear the crazy bill presented.Stay away from the sandwiches- awful and sky-high prices!!!!I will never return nor all my Hedge Fund colleagues.....Save yourself aggravations-  Do not accept such Rip Off.....",0,0,0,Ruth S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,15,0

The truffle fries are great if you do come here!Also got to try some of their cocktails - their take on a Manhattan, a sparkling wine drink with sherry and a hot alcoholic spiced apple cider! I really liked the cider, but found out they just buy apple cider and add alcohol, so that was a little disappointing. The manhattan is good and the sparking sherry drink was really odd for me. Overall, not a bad spot. If you're looking for a space to grab drinks and some small bites, come to the third floor of this place!",2,0,1,Janus C.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",735,483,10

First floor is the general seating area, second level is full of private dining areas and rooms, and third level is also a general seating area with a cute outdoor rooftop area. Service was great, every person I came across were very professional and friendly, especially Lee. He was so nice to show me the cigar locker room when asked randomly. There are no restrooms on the third level which was kind of annoying but the restroom on the second floor was too far away. The cigar locker room is also on the second floor and super cool.The fries were awesome, especially the truffle fries. There's a good selection of drinks, from wine to specialty cocktails.

5.0,1/25/2018,"Superb dinner spot with awesome vibes! Great spot to treat clients (something on the menu for everyone)! Centrally located in Midtown, Aretsky's attracts both the corporate power/scene but also draws in a more balanced and trendier crowd. Their starting bread/rolls might be the best complimentary bread ever served! Between the salt and lightly buttered texture they absolutely melt in your math. In addition to the bread, we lucked-up and received complimentary truffle grilled cheese bites. Although it was only an hor dourves, it didn't feel too greasy or salty but was the perfect blend of taste and comfort. Each dish has also clearly been well thought out and each ingredient delicately chosen. The grilled calamari pairs very well with the blood oranges - they also served up ample portions of the calamari.Best entree to order is the Dover Sole! The fish is prepared table side and the tomato tart compliments the fish very well. The beef stew also tasted like it might have been stewing over night and actually seemed to melt right in your mouth. To top it all off, the service was exquisite!

Anyway it has a sweet start and smoky finish and was definitely my favorite thing there. Restaurant week menu was good but the pasta was just a bit too oily. Quail was tasty but I had forgotten you have to maneuver around bones with quail! Dessert however was perfection - I got the chocolate cake which comes plated very nicely with ice cream.

4.0,9/21/2017,"Great vibes and close to work! Is there really much more you can ask for? I found this little gem from a recommendation from a co-worker. This review is just for their rooftop bar. The rooftop bar has the perfect ambiance with the string lights, large space, and younger professional crowd on the weekdays. All the waiters I engaged with were super welcoming and extremely nice. I got my order put in right away and they came to check on the group plenty of times. At 6pm the bar was starting to get crowded. I recommend coming here early or getting a table so you can have a comfortable area to hang out at.Price- Be prepared to pay premium prices for drinks. A glass of wine will run you $15 and a Budlight $9. Considering this is midtown this is pretty normal.Overall, I really enjoyed the feel of the place and love the ambiance.

3.0,7/26/2017,"I went here for a restaurant week dinner and the first and second courses were amazing. We also had the wine pairing to go with our meal and we both loved the wine picked for our dishes and really appreciated the sommelier who explained what we were drinking and why he chose it for us. I was really disappointed when it came to dessert because I chose aretsky's because I was really excited about having the peanutbutter cup dessert that was on the restaurant week menu. I have celiac disease and had called in advance to see if it was gluten free and when I found out it was, I was very excited since I am unable to eat most desserts. Unfortunately they said they were out once we got to dessert so I got the flourless chocolate cake instead which was good but not great. My date had ordered the sorbet for dessert but instead they also brought him chocolate cake plus the panna cotta to make up for the peanut butter cup not being available. When we told our waiter that he had made a mistake and that we had ordered the sorbet not the second cake, he told us that he had gotten confused when taking our order but then didn't take the extra cake back or bring out the sorbet so my date was disappointed with his dessert as well since he didn't get what he ordered. I also felt that the waiter was making light of my meal needing to be gluten free and made a joke about it at the beginning of the meal which I don't appreciate. It's a medical condition and when I'm dining especially in a nice restaurant, I expect my dietary needs to be respected. Our appetizers and main course were delicious however the attitude of the waiter and the mistakes with our dessert tainted the meal a little.",0,0,0,Dylan G.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",246,12,0

Compared to the rooftop, the bar downstairs in the dinning room is better. The deco is classic. I love the posters and pictures hanging on the war. Service is perfect. The menu is not overwhelming but everything is well prepared. There were five of us so we ordered pretty much every entree except the 45-day aged ribeye for two.

No loud, distracting, obnoxious music. No loud crowds. Decor is tasteful. This is what a first rate dining is meant to be.Side note: unlike many other high end places, they do NOT skimp on Restaurant Week menu. 2 meat dishes, both decently sized, both super high quality.

3.0,4/15/2016,"I don't typically write restaurant reviews. If a place is great, I tip extra well and return. If a place falls short, don't go back. My experience at this restaurant was so weird, however, that I feel like sharing. First, let me just say that all the food we ordered was great. Cooked to perfection and seasoned beautifully. Five stars on food--it was spot on for the price point. This is why I still give it a decentish rating. I don't want to denigrate the staff on account of the management's foibles. Second, let me say that the regular waitstaff we had was unfailing nice and apologetic for what ultimately folded. So what did unfold? Well, it ended up taking over an hour and fifteen minutes to get our entrees, despite the dining room being roughly 60% full. Sure, that happens and is not worthy of a review in and of itself, but the reason I mention it here is because the lead waiter, a French gentleman, made a point of coming to our table and explaining that the delay was because they had a food inspector visiting. This explanation came, of course, right after another waiter apologized that they could not include a lemon peel in my second sidecar (there was one in my first) because they had to ""throw the fruit away"".  What?  Why does a high end restaurant have to throw all of its lemons away and slow service to half of the normal speed just because an inspector visited? My hope would be that a high end restaurant wouldn't have to change a thing (let alone suddenly throw away fruit) when inspected. But, alas, not here, it seems.  This turn of events was rather troubling, to say the least. Following our long-delayed and troublesome dinner, I tipped, signed the check and added a short message on the receipt copy that noted, in a polite way, the awkwardness of being informed that a visit by the health inspector would result in extreme delays in service. I was ready to leave without thinking about it again. But then the lead waitress, a French lady who was also the lead porkchop cutter, took our check while we were still chatting in the seats. Since when is that proper etiquette, by the way?  Never seen that happen at Jean George or Betony, for example. To add to the awkwardness, I then watched her crumble-up and throw away the message I wrote while we were walking to the front to get our coats. I'm half tempted to now challenge my tip with the credit card company on principle since she couldn't defend it without that receipt. (I won't because it would screw the regular waitstaff.)  In any case, it was a sudden and rude ending to an awkward and questionable experience.  In sum: the food was great, the service decidedly mixed, and the awkwardness/shady-ness was unnecessarily pronounced. This place is questionable.",2,0,0,W Z.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0

The restaurant had a relaxing ambiance with a live strings duet playing soothingly in the entrance. Started the meal with the sunchoke soup that was prepared with a nice creamy base and topped with tobiko, pieces of trout, and pickled onions. I was mildly disappointed with my uni bucatini which was too plain for my taste- seemed like butter and breadcrumbs were the main ingredients to this dull dish. However, after expressing a slight dislike to the dish, the server immediately brought it back to the kitchen and had the dish completely revamped with a wonderful marinara sauce, pancetta, mozzarella cheese, and garnish. Such a nice improvement. If I were to go back, I would definitely try the carrot and ricotta gnocchi that a lot of my friends enjoyed. Although small, beautiful presentation and incredible texture and flavor to the gnocchi.  Would highly recommend the chocolate pave cake that I got for dessert.

Their AC didn't seem to be working properly so the room was quite warm and stuffy but the staff did everything possible to rectify the problem. The staff alone gets 5 stars. No guest ever had any issues where they didn't have a drink on hand or had to wait but a moment to have a refill. They are stealthy with getting used plates and glassware out of the room and very warm and courteous as well. Can't say enough about the team that worked my event that event. The food again was superb. I usually don't expect too much for cocktail reception fare but they outdid themselves from the passed hors d'uevres to the selected hot and cold stations. Each stationary food station were never empty in selection and they kept a rolling replenishment so guests again never had to wait for anything.

5.0,9/28/2015,"I found this place via yelp after my previous boss asked me to go out to lunch before he headed out to his new job in Silicon Valley. He'd never been here, but it got 4 stars and a good menu so what the hell.I made a reservation online for 2 at 12:30 pm. I confirmed over the phone and was asked whether I wanted to be seated on the terrace or inside. Based on recommendations I went for the terrace... fall was looming around the corner so you got to soak up the sun while it's still out shining.When I arrived exactly on time, the nice hostess checked again on my seating preference and then escorted me up a couple flights of stairs to the terrace. It was beautiful out and I liked the space. Working less than a 10 minute walk away, I'm surprised we've never been here for after-work drinks. My boss was 30 minutes late and I didn't even mind. The waiters were attentive and filled my water, but not overly so and gave me space so I could wait in peace. It felt nice to sit and chill outside. I could tell most of the people around me were there on business meetings. I also appreciated the little pillow that made sitting up against the wall much more comfortable.My boss arrived. I have no idea what the thing they bring out in place of bread is. It was like a flat, herby bread stick. It was good and I could have eaten all of it, but I kind of wish there was a spread that came with it. Neither of us had drinks because that's been standard work policy. I would love to have wine every time I eat out at nice places during work hours, and I would love to try cocktails at Aretsky's. Sigh, maybe on another non occasion.I had the Seafood Paella. It was amazing! It came with the shrimp heads on and everything. I just love that. Definitely gives some other paella places in the area a run for their money. I will 100% be back and I'd like to try drinks and some other things (oysters!) and update my review.",5,2,3,Chelsea B.,"Secaucus, NJ",329,335,187

My guest is from argentina and has a fairly high standard for meat and meat preparation. he cut into the steak and said 'perfect!'.. now that's a feat. i felt very attended to by all staff, and they were pleasant. the host came to ask how all was, and was also very pleasant. definitely a suit type place, and they can get a bit loud (after a few scotches i suppose).. but overall, a pleasant time and good food for a classic ny steakjoint.",1,0,0,Lauren B.,"Manhattan, NY",111,43,1

5.0,8/11/2015,"Thoroughly enjoyed my dinner here last night. My dad and brother and I took advantage of Restaurant Week and joined the business men and lawyers who make up the majority of the crowd. The restaurant has an old-boy club feel, but not in an obnoxious way. The maitre'd and waitresses and hostess were all just as kind and attentive to us as they were to the high-rollers, something I always appreciate. The food was superb: grilled calamari with watermelon and bibb lettuce (the watermelon is something I never would have paired with calamari, but it worked very well), the tomato consomme (not my favorite, but interesting), red snapper (I only had a taste but it was delicious), and bucatini (my dish and by far my favorite: creamy while still somehow being light, pasta coated in breadcrumbs without feeling like the carb bomb that it was - I finished the entire plate). We had sorbet to finish, which was very complex - maybe a berry/red wine/rosemary sorbet? We had different wines: rose and sancerre, both of which were recommended by the sommelier and both delicious. Service, ambiance, and food were all top notch - I would certainly come back if someone else were paying!",3,0,2,Perry T.,"Manhattan, NY",100,444,0
3.0,8/9/2015,Came here for restaurant week in the summer of 2015. It's a classy place and the decor is elegant. I was a bit underdressed and I would recommend wearing a polo or button up for men. The food overall is decent. I had the buffalo mozzarella with peaches for the appetizer. The vinegarette they drizzled on the peaches did not pair well. Otherwise the mozzarella was pretty delicious. For my main I got the lamb loin and lamb belly dish. The loin was cooked perfectly and was melt-in-your-mouth superb. The lamb belly was a bit funky and there were pieces of small bones or hard stems in it. Im not sure exactly what it was but it was distracting and difficult to eat the belly. I dont mind gamey lamb but if you do then don't get the lamb belly. I had the the sorbet for dessert to clean my palate. Overall the food was presented well and tasted okay.

5.0,8/9/2015,"We came here for their restaurant week special.  It's definitely a fancy spot and on a regular day you can easily rack up $100 for one person.  One reason I wanted to come here was to try their uni bucatini.  I've heard great things about this dish and thought it would be perfect to come here to explore.  For apps i got - grilled calamari- perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection, he got - poached pear with mozzarella which was good.  Main dish- I got the uni pasta and it was just as good as I imagined. The pancetta was perfect with the bite of pasta - added a nice saltiness to it.  He got the lamb belly and loin which was also great but small.  We finished off with pound cake and chocolate pave- which was very rich but tasty and the sorbet seemed freshly made!  You also get complimentary bread while you wait so eat up because portions are small!  After dinner we scoped out the rooftop bar.  Now it's only 2 flights up so you don't get much of a scenery.  Plus they had bushes covering the opening to look out so it's really just great to enjoy the weather vs the scenery.  The drinks are expensive but i loved the mixology.  Killer Old fashioned but honestly couldn't taste the added maple and pecan flavor twist they added to it.",9,4,7,Neha M.,"Garfield, NJ",846,1124,396

I had the brussels sprouts salad ($19), which was perfectly (and lightly) dressed, and the mushroom lentil burger ($23). The vegetarian burger was DELICIOUS. I wish it came with fries instead of the healthy chopped up beets and tomato-- overall a bland side-- but it was a fantastic vegetarian option.

And the coconut pound cake looked like two Twinkies on a plate and tasted old and dry.

5.0,7/29/2015,"I do not recall how I came about Aretsky's Patroon, but, once I learned of it, something about the gorgeous pictured of the restaurant really called out to me.  Though it had been on my wish list for years, I only recently made it to the space for Summer Restaurant Week.  The menu drew me in instantly, and we jumped at the chance to make a reservation.  I arrived at the restaurant and opened the heavy red door, which led me into a breathtakingly classy dining room.  I was greeted by an amiable Frenchman that helped me check my bags and escorted me to the table, despite the fact that my brother had not yet arrived for the reservation.  While I waited for him, I studied the list of intriguing cocktails and notable wines, so that once he did show up, I was ready to order my glass of 2013 Mercer Pinot Gris from the Yakima Valley in Washington State.  It was exactly how our server described it - bright, fruity, and with low acidity.  My brother's 2013 ""Felino"" Malbec from Vina Cobos in the Mendoza region of Argentina was fruity and smoky at the same time, but the complexity faded quickly.The meal began with 6 Parker House Rolls served in a warm skillet.  The tops of the buns were a bit crunchier than I typically like, but still possessed a moist interior and expertly salted crust.  They were served with the obligatory butter, but certainly did not need it.  When it came to the 3-course, Restaurant Week menu, we decided to begin with the same appetizer, the Grilled Calamari.  A plate arrived that displayed a large leaf of Bibb lettuce topped with the calamari and chilling besides cubes of watermelon.  The circles and tentacles had been marinated in a chile-lime vinaigrette that was savory, sweet, and bold.  The calamari remained tender and paired perfectly with the watermelon.  Despite the boring plating, the dish was delightful!  From here, I ventured off on the fish path, while my brother stayed on the land.  His Lamb Loin and Belly combination was spectacularly cooked.  The belly had a smoky, crunchy and bacon-like quality, while the loin was moist and savory.  His protein was served with a Mediterranean-style puree sampler of golden raisin caponata, smoked eggplant puree, and charred tomatoes.  My Steamed Red Snapper was lying on top of sautéed shiitake mushrooms and spinach and was enhanced by lemongrass and soy butter - a heavenly mixture I could eat every day.  We were on the same track again for dessert, both selecting the Chocolate Pave, a mousse-like cake that was rich beyond belief...but in a good way.  The decadent pastry was topped with crunchy macadamia crumbs, served with a sweet mango-passionfruit sorbet, and plated alongside a tart passionfruit curd.  Each bite was pure decadence that I did not think I could finish...but, somehow, I did!Lastly, I just have to mention the spectacular service that we received throughout the meal.  We were consistently asked if we needed anything else and how we were enjoying our meal.  Plus, this was all inquired about in such a gracious manner that it was appreciated rather than causing irritation.  Despite the upscale atmosphere and high prices, the maître d' made us feel right at home and on par with the rest of their patrons who were splurging on the full menu.I simply need to return and sample Aretsky's Patroon's regular menu.  It should be noted that the place is open for both lunch and dinner, but only on weekdays.  They also offer several party rooms and a rooftop lounge.  Consider yourself informed and go check it out!",12,4,10,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

The $35 Restaurant week special for dinner made it affordable even for teens, and we were just dazzled by the epicurean quality of the prix fixe menu!   The boys have now had an experience at one of the truly great NYC restaurants!  The lamb dish was original and succulent and full of extra touches I had never expected; the fish was melt-in-your mouth with oyster mushrooms,  the desserts unusual and delicious.  The staff was attentive and nice as could be.

I then had to go to the bar to get a menu. We ordered a salad and a steak to share. It took 40 minutes to come out. We politely asked can you check on our food and that's when the attitude turned on. Long story short, we asked to split the bill and the waitress responded ""I won't do that"" under her breath. We ignored it, put all of our cards on the bill. Needless to say, New Yorkers stay away.

Water and menus were presented timely. Since it was restaurant week, my date and I decided to order from that and save a little money. The menu had 3 choices in appetizer, 3 choices in entree, and 3 choices in dessert. I ordered a salad for appetizer, wagyu beef stew for entree, and a lychee-raspberry fool with a latte for dessert. After ordering, the server brought us a warm salter bread bun with butter. The food was not anything special in my opinion. The salad was a little bland, the vegetables in the wagyu beef stew stole the show, and the dessert was a little on the sweet side. The presentation for each dish was amazing, but the food wasn't out of this world. The ambiance was romantic, the servers were amazing, but the food was ok.

(Several other members of my team went out for fancy dinners with other clients, and the general consensus was that our experience was by far the best)The service, for one, was stellar. The atmosphere was what you'd expect from a restaurant of this price and location, so I'll mention an anecdote that took place about 2/3s of the way into the meal. One of the dinner guests flagged down a waiter to ask if there was any shellfish in the entree he'd just begun sampling. There was just a hint of something that was giving him a slight allergic reaction, so the waiter assured him that 1) they would swap out the entree for something else if he wanted, and 2) they had epipens in their first aid kit in case anything more untoward occurred or progressed. That really stood out to me, since a few of my friends are highly allergic to various triggers and that small preventative act showed really thorough foresight on the part of the restaurant. We had a grand time, and halfway through the appetizers, more than 8 of us spontaneously decided to get the Caesar salad (made tableside!) after watching another guest enjoy his order. The staff gamely brought by a beautiful portion of fresh leaves and dressing ingredients, and even catered to our request to make two dressing batches - one ""light on the anchovies"" for the faint of heart, and another one extra-hearty with all the leftover anchovy essence for those of us who appreciate the finer things in life. The wine was great, the food fresh and hot and cooked exactly to order - no small feat for a large party like ours - and we all walked away highly impressed and in good spirits.

5.0,2/21/2014,"The first stop for Winter NYC Restaurant Week 2014 was a last minute reservation for Aretsky's Patroon. My best friend and I were due to have a night on the town and but since we're both feeling our age these days, a nice dinner before heading home had to suffice. Upon arrival we were seated immediately in a big comfy booth.We decided to split everything down the middle to get a taste of everything. My order was the Grilled Quail appetizer, Wagyu Sirloin entrée, and Housemade Sorbet dessert. Quails, being so small, tend to be easily overcooked and become dry. Their quail app on a bed of kasha and oyster mushrooms was perfect. I noted that they never asked what temperature I wanted my steak in which my friend reminded me that great restaurants will never ask you that as they know what the optimal temperature for their meat would be. I guess she was right because the Wagyu Sirloin was perfectly succulent. There was a slight char on the outside with the center on the rare side. Just how I like my steak. The sorbet was a trio of Papaya, Blood Orange, and Pear. Each was distinct in flavor. My favorite was the pear.She ordered the Roasted Garlic-Onion Bisque appetizer, Roasted Cod entrée, and Pear Crumble dessert. The bisque was intensely flavorful. So flavorful in fact that when I got home I still smelled the garlic in my breath. It was so good though that it was worth having vampire repelling breath. I was afraid the cod would taste bland after starting with the steak and then switching halfway through but that wasn't the case. The cod was nicely seasoned and black risotto it came with was quite interesting. It had us wondering just how black risotto is made. I didn't try the pear crumble as I was too engrossed with my delicious trio of sorbets so no review for that unfortunately.We paired our meal with a glass of their Pinot Noir and a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. The bottles here were a little pricey and there weren't wine specials on the restaurant week menu so we opted to just have a glass each. The wines were very good.The service was very attentive all night. Our waiter checked on us multiple times as did the sommelier. Our glasses were always filled. Our dishes came out perfectly timed. After we finished the appetizers our entrees came out a few minutes later and the same went for the dessert.The crowd here was quite obviously wealthy businessmen from the surrounding buildings. Just about everyone was in a suit and tie. I guess that explains the outrageous prices on the normal menu. All hail Restaurant Week menus!",3,0,2,P C.,"Brooklyn, NY",235,206,145

As for the restaurant, it manages the trick of balancing full steakhouse service with a menu of other options that don't seem to be an afterthought.  When you and another guy in your your party order the porterhouse for two and a big Napa Cab, the people in the party ordering the catch of the day and splitting a Chardonnay won't get a look of pity from the waiter.The main dining room is simple and straightforward.  Not too noisy and tables not too crowded, helped along by a mellow business crowd that's more likely to be thinking about making the train to Greenwich than the curtain at a show.",4,1,0,Matthew D.,"Scarsdale, NY",4,339,0

I was there on a Friday evening with friends and the  atmosphere was intimate enough that we didn't have to shout but there was enough people that If we wanted to branch out we could have. We enjoyed a good bottle of Spanish Rose however, it was served warm. At over $40 for the bottle this was annoying. We had to ask for a bucket of ice more than once. The roof menu is shameful. The selection is gray at best and the potions don't fit the fun atmosphere; hardly meant for sharing. my friends ordered the tinniest beef slides for $14 you get a total of 2 burgers. The best I could do was spicy fries with truffle mayo $10 and roasted peppers $9. The fries were soggy and the peppers were chard.

The plan was to hit the rooftop bar, but we needed to while away thirty minutes or so while they readied for opening. This turned out to be quite serendipitous. I loved the dark, wood-paneled interior bar, set off the main dining room. I felt like we were in our own private speakeasy, away from the hustle and bustle of the city streets.George made excellent, old school martinis and happily served us oysters on the half shell - delicious, briny east coast beauties - and a plate of radishes with salt and butter. Simple and elegant, this was the perfect way station on the road to dinner and the Eugene O'Neill theatre. I only wish we'd stayed there and not ventured upstairs to check out the famous rooftop scene.

The rooftop bar area is nice and comfy.  Since it was a Monday night, the place was not busy so we had no issue to grab a table. First thing we noticed was $9 beer (for bud as well). Cocktails were around $15. The boys ordered scotch on rocks, I ordered gin blossom and another cocktail, and the other ladies had a couple of glasses of wine. I personally did not think the cocktails are worth the price. For start, they use tall glasses filled with tiny cubes of ice that water down too quickly. By the time I am half way done, it was all water. For $15bucks, I expect something along the line like Pegu quality.Appetizers - we ordered a couple of fries, chips, sliders, pull porked sandwich and they gave us free donuts (i think they were free).

The table was in a great location and the service was great. Each of us ordered a different salad for appetizer and my husband ordered the crab cakes. He said the crab cakes were delicious, and didn't offer me a bite - so they must have been gooood! I had the Caesar salad and I was really impressed. They made the salad table side, and it is the best I have ever had. For entrees my husband ordered the filet, my father-in-law and I ordered the roasted chicken and my mother-in-law the dover sole. I was impressed with everything. The chicken was moist and full of flavor. I did not try the steak or fish. But the dover sole was deboned table side and prepared beautifully. Everyone was really happy with the meals. For dessert, I had the pumpkin bread pudding which was an interesting twist to regular types. But, being a fan of pumpkin, I loved it. My mother-in-law and I also ordered cappuccino and they were the perfect amount of froth and milk. The server also made a cute little heart shape in them, which I thought was a cute touch. I was really impressed with everything here, but mostly I was impressed by the owner. He came to our table towards the beginning of the meal, introduced himself, and spoke to us for about 10 minutes. He seemed to really care about the service that was provided and also showed that he was really concerned with our satisfaction in our experience.

Meal:- Shrimp cocktail: large, crisp, firm, shrimp. A sizeable portion.- Crabcake: delicious! The only breading on this was on the outside. No filler in the inside, how a crabcake should be!! Wish this was an entree, my favorite of everything I tried!- Grilled Fish of the Day: Striped Bass. The fish melted in my mouth and was on a bed of perfectly seasoned broccoi rabe. I wish the fish skin was crispy though...- Hot Fudge Sundae: reminded me of childhood. Simple, classic, fudge on vanilla.- Warm Dark Chocolate Cake: Chocolatey, rich, and warm. The inside spewed out with every spoonful. Good, but I've had better.- Ice Cream: These are homemade. Got the vanilla, banana, and strawberry. They were rich and creamy however the scoops were SO SMALL! At $10/scoop, serving should be larger. All in all, I think the dessert was overpriced and service was mediocre.  The waiter seemed preoccupied and bothered when we asked questions.

Not quite the elegance I was expecting. However, the downstairs area, offered a more formal, less happy hour-ish environment. The head maître d and the staff were aware it was our anniversary dinner, a nice touch, considering we made last minute reservations. We ordered the fried artichokes and the grilled octopus as an appetizer. They were both tasty and well presented. The fried artichokes were a little regular and the batter wasn't really that special. The dipping sauce was delicious and complemented the bland batter. The octopus was grilled and season nicely. I would definitely recommend it. We had the porterhouse steak for two that was on the specials menu for that week. The steak was carved, cut and served table side. The meat was tender, as a porterhouse should be, but slightly over cooked on the outside. Giving it a slightly charred flavor. It was a little mistake on my behalf and certainly against my rules of ordering food in certain restaurants.  Order steaks, in steak houses. Order fish, in seafood spots. And so on.

We started with the fried artichokes, steak tartar, and crab cake. Each one was better than the last. At almost $20 an appetizer (portions aren't huge), we should hope that they are delicious, and they are. Boyfriend had the sirloin which he said was one of the best steaks he's had in the city. I had the grilled lobster and mango salad which was light and summery and not heavy at all. If anything, I could say that he lobster pieces could have been a bit more buttery or moist, but it was still a very tasty dish.Finally, we finished with the key lime cheesecake that we split. AMAZING. It came with lychee sorbet and pieces of mango on the side. It was the perfect summer dessert and we couldn't get enough. We were already so full from dinner, but this dessert deserved to be devoured.The service was also wonderful. The waitstaff and manager were attentive and friendly. I think the only possible aspect that detracted from the experience was the table next to us with five very loud boisterous people who sometimes yelled and talked so loud (alcohol definitely played into that) that it was a bit hard to hear each other speack. If it weren't for the fact that I really wanted a romantic atmosphere and experience, the loudmouths would have been fine (and really that's not the restaurant's fault).

The drinks are pricey (I think a bottle of Amstel Light set me back $9, which is expensive even by NY standards), but the high aluminum roof provides a nice open-air feeling. The finger foods are delicious as well; I'd highly recommend the sliders or the pigs in a blanket (which had just the right level of crispiness). Aside from expensive drinks, the only downside is that if it does get crowded, you may be standing for a while. There are a fair number of tables and chairs besides a spot at the bar, but if it's a gorgeous Friday afternoon, you're going to be hard-pressed to get much personal space.

4.0,8/25/2010,"I really, really like this place. It is an excellent overall dining experience. Very good food - excellent example of modern-American cuisine with a substantial nod to tradition. Expect the usual, but done exceptionally well. The steaks are great and cooked perfectly and the desserts are awesome! Thanks to Mr Aretsky we tried them all! Mr Aretsky is a real gem! The fact that he still floats around shaking hands and making genuine conversation with his patrons - looking after them with superior style and rat-pack reminiscent cool - is great! Some have accused it of being masculine, but I like that about it. It has a smart, clubby feel without being snobby or exclusive. The staff are very good and pull-off the business/casual vibe very well with relaxed yet professional service. Excellent business lunch venue. Busy and lively. Super keen to try fried chicken Fridays! A top notch American dining experience. The new roof-top bar is fab. The half-covered terrace is great and it means you can still go there on steamy, wet summer afternoons for a cold beverage. And yes they do smoke cigars up there - deal with it - it is part of what gives this place its old-style cool. That said, the roof-top is by no means a smokers-only kind of place.  When I was there, there was only a faint hint of cigar smell about and the ceiling on the covered area is very high, making it well ventilated.  You are welcome to smoke cigars up there, yes, but it is just as much a nice place to grab a drink with friends and colleagues.  I hope they really do keep it open year-round.",2,0,0,Leaf W.,"Canberra, Australia",1,11,0

I was in heaven.I went to the cigar lounge upstairs - small selection of cigars but I enjoyed it. This rooftop place has a very different vibe than Club Macanudo.

My friend, who also goes by as Mrs. T and I went for pre-fix lunch. There was a choice of two for appetizer, entree, and dessert. Both of us choose the opposite of each other.The appetizers was good, I choose a pate meat platter and other T choose the salad. Entrees, I choose the monkfish and friend chooses the steak and fries. Monk fish was delicious, firm and juicy, and surprisingly a big portion. Tried the steak, meat is tender and fries were good. After eating our entrees. my friend is preggers and she was still hungry. The portions were not small, but she is preggers. So we ordered the crab cake appetizer. We got one round patty of a crispy breading all around, and the meat was not a lump of crab meat but made of loose crab meat. That was so disappointing and at $18 it should be a huge lump of crab meat. Our desserts came and they were good. I got the mango sorbet,  very refreshing til the very end. My friend choose the cherry tart crumble with ice cream. That was delicious but more crumble with less cherries would have been better. Overall, I would come back during restaurant week. Two options as your choices for each category is a bit of a downer when this place can give you more options to choose from.  They are outrageously expensive. This place has a elegant ambiance and service was attentive. Old school in suits are known to come. We came here last Friday at 1 and this place was deserted. I was surprised that more people would want to try this place during restaurant week. There was no one sitting next to us and that was great not to hear anyone else conversation.

5.0,3/5/2010,"If you love fried chicken, love food that tastes like its home cooked (and no, i dont mean in your home, but in the home of someone who can cook their a** off), and love to experience something different, make sure to take a Friday night and visit Aretsky's Patroon for their fried chicken dinner night.Dont be scared off by some of the yelpers lukewarm reviews, because they dont matter, this is totally off their regular menu.  Friday Nights, Chef Charles Gabriel comes down from Harlem (with his skillets) to bring southern cooking to midtown manhattan and he does it perfectly.  $25 will get you three pieces of perfectly seasoned, perfectly fried chicken, with two sides (candied yams, mac n cheese and black eyed peas are the must-haves) and a great big piece of cornbread to go with it.  As if thats not enough, you will also get banana pudding that tastes so homemade you'll think you grew up on it, and it will remind you of something amazing your grandma used to make (even if your grandma never did).  Do yourself a favor and order a green tea with your dessert, served in a french press with real tea leaves.  Add in live jazz by a 3 piece combo, a room filled with fantastic black and whites of old New York (Im guessing 40's) and you've got a really fun night.  The service is a touch on the slow side, but I'll be generous and call it 'unrushed'.  I dont know how long Fried Chicken Fridays will last at Patroon, so make sure you get there while you can.  Hopefully, it will become a permanent fixture, cause Im looking forward to going back as soon as my cholesterol drops back to normal.",5,1,2,Debbie W.,"New York, NY",181,497,6
2.0,2/18/2010,"""Good afternoon, Patroon."" Giggle. If only the place was as fun as that sentence. My boss goes to dinner there regularly, so I figured, ""Why not make a reservation for Restaurant Week?"" I'll tell you why not. My superior is a corporate attorney nearing senior citizen status. Anyone with half a brain would realize that the man most likely has a VERY different preference as to vibe than I do. But guess who must have received a lobotomy no one told her about and was, therefore, super surprised to encounter a stiff and old-school (and not in a charming way) atmosphere? Uncomfortable...I hoped that once we moved on to the food, our lot would improve. Not so much. I ignored the lackluster prix fixe menu and went for the Pan Searled Loin of Venison. Very Disappointing: absolutely no flavor. Where are my spices? pepper? salt? Bueller? Le sigh.My companions, who opted for the RW menu, seemed more pleased. I'm not a pistachio person, but if I were, I would have enjoyed the Pistachio Mousse dessert I sampled: creamy and interesting (shocking adjective, considering the locale).On an unrelated-to-my-personal-experience note, I hear The Wine Cellar (capacity: 12) is a great option if you're looking for a private meeting location.
