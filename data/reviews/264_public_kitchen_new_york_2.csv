3.0,4/20/2019,"Food was very ""eh."" They attempt to amp up their dishes, on the menu everything sounds delicious but the food doesn't live up to the expectation by any means. And relatively bland.Menu said angel hair pasta with pistachio pesto and some other interesting additives (I don't recall), the pasta was thicker than angel hair closer to spaghetti size and tasted just like plain spaghetti and pesto.Strip steak, medium, was over cooked and not tastyFritto Misto was literally just a few shrimp scallops etc fried and served on plate (but I guess that's what it's supposed to be) Several of the dishes had grilled fennel as a garnish or served along side the main dish including two main courses. Couldn't think of anything else? The three cheese black truffle pizza was good (but anything with truffle on it is delicious...if you like truffle)Everything else was just mediocre at best.The service was below par. Waiter was not patient and it seemed they were rushing us out from the moment we sat down.The waiter would not put our appetizer order in until we ordered main course and mumbled something about us having to wait for main course if not submitted at the same time. After he said this and I was already feeling rushed, I specifically asked him to make sure there is a break between appetizers and main course, he seemed confused and again mumbled something not relevant to my request, I repeated my request, that there be at least a 15 minute break between courses.Whilst some guests were still eating appetizers the wait staff was already clearing the table, took everyone else's appetizer plates away and the dishes that they were served on while someone was still eating. This was probably only about 15 mins after we were served the apps. After everyone was done eating, about 5 or so mins later I along with a friend went to use the restroom, when I came back the main course was already sitting on the table. The others said it had arrived 5 or so minutes ago and everyone was waiting for us to return to eat. So the main course came to table about 10 mins after appetizers and was served while 2 of 5 were missing from the table. The ambiance and vibe was fine. Nothing incredibly special, but was nice.",0,0,0,Daniela V.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,0

3.0,3/31/2019,"Food and drinks were very good. Overall ambiance was very modern and impressive. Unfortunately the service was terrible (very slow and our server was rarely seen). Took 20-30 minutes before even acknowledge by server and got our wine order. Much longer til we even got apps then food. The restaurant was extremely loud on a weekend night, making conversations challenging. Not worth the price. Likely better on a weekday night.

5.0,3/25/2019,"We really enjoyed ourselves here. Right when you walk in, the entrance is very beautifully decorated with lots of greenery, plus they've got these really cool escalators draped in LED lights. Before we got to the restaurant we took a stroll through some kind of juice bar, a mini Cafe and some sort of shared workspace.Now onto the food. Overall it definitely hit the nail on the head. Only complaint is that the pizza portion was too small! Kale salad - chopped finely, crunchy, great addition of mint, and we needed to order two of them for our group of 4Tuna tartare - very fresh, nice rice crackers, but lacked some acid flavorPizza - we got the marinara (fabulous, covered in basil) and the truffle. Both were great, and the truffle really packed in a lot of cheesy flavor.For the mains we got roasted cauliflower (very good, mustard vinaigrette), roasted carrots (very spicy), a pasta with pesto sauce and a veggie burger. I liked the veggie burger. Bun was perfectly toasted and it stayed together, unlike some other veggie burgers I've had. However, it was very ""beet""y. Yeah, lots of beet.All in all, highly recommend to try it out. We came on a Sunday night and it was pretty empty but I've read some reviews say that it gets packed on Saturday nights.",0,0,0,Hal D.,"New York, NY",219,147,305
5.0,3/16/2019,"Since this restaurant opened up for business, the food critics gave this establishment such harsh reviews with insults after insults. However, I believe they had some personal issues with Chef Jean-Georges, respectfully.  I made my reservations for an early dinner at 5:30pm and I guess my reservation time was a bit too early for staff to prep. They were having a meeting and a new wine tasting. So the Hostess offer me and my date some cocktails on the house, for the unexpected wait, and I opted for one, so my date can sample. And it was the Raspberry-lychee Bellini. The drink was superb with the combination of the raspberry highlighted our tasting palette. As we enter the restaurant, I was totally in awe with the decor, atmosphere, the staff warmth and last but not least, the cleanliness as if Public Kitchen just open for the first time. The chef gave my date and I, a couple of complimentary plates. The first plate was a high quality tuna tartare with ginger and chives. The next plate was a lightly battered seafood dish, consist of scallops, shrimps and calamari. It was delicious right along with my entree of rigatoni's with meatballs in a deep rich red chili paste gravy. We also tried the mozzarella with tomato and chili flake pizza and that tasted like an authentic New York Italian style pizza. I became a instant fan. My date wanted the signature PK burger and she loved it. She could tell there meat providers are from the meat purveyors company. The hotel complimented every public area around the restaurant. The wait staff (Carlos) was very attentive and I felt we were given first class service or VIP status. I shall return and may stay a weekend here at this hotel just to stay close by and try their whole menu. Thank you PK for your hospitality and great quality food.",0,0,0,Mental O.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,21,1
3.0,3/7/2019,"We came here with a group of 5 for dinner on a Saturday night and I'd give it 3.5 stars.  The reason for rounding down from 4 is more service driven than food driven. It took forever for us to be seated, and then acknowledged, took a long time for our drinks to come and then food didn't all come at once.We ordered the black truffle pizza with cheese and farm egg.  This was probably the best thing we ordered and if any of the ingredients sound good to you I highly recommend this.We ordered a salad as well, I believe it was the Caesar salad, and I thought this was quite tasty.Our last appetizer was the spicy tuna tartare, which was also quite good, though a pretty small portionMy main of scallops was just OK, I could've used a bit more searing on mine.I'm not sure if I'd come back, they do seem to generally have reservations available so I probably would if I'm in a pinch.",1,1,1,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634
5.0,3/5/2019,"Wowwww!!! I am very impressed with this place. I mean I had high expectations regardless but the actual dining experience is amazing. My boyfriend had his birthday dinner here and we changed the reservation a few times--to which the staff was incredibly understanding and prompt. The drinks were fabulous and STRONG (a little pricey--but you're paying for quality) mostly everyone at the table ordered margaritas. Everyone really enjoyed their meals. I had the monkfish which was very tender and flavorful (they warn you it's salty but it's really not), the tuna tartare appetizer is a must have as well. The restaurant was pretty busy but all the staff was more than willing to help and step in with requests from our table whenever our waiter wasn't around. Definitely recommend if you haven't been!",0,0,0,Melissa C.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",2,11,15
4.0,2/16/2019,"Really nice atmosphere. Very beautiful interior and great for a romantic dinner. The staff was really attending and our waiter was extremely friendly. I love a good customer service. The food is serviced fairly quickly. For appetizer, my date and I order fried calamari. Very airy and crispy. I loved the gentle and flavorful taste. The chef sent us potstickers to try, and not quite sure how to explain it, but it was pretty good. The cocktails are good, but when we order the same drinks the second time, they were presented slightly differently. For example, the second time, my date's drink came with apples, however it did not the first time (I guess they forgot, which I found it annoying). Next, the main course. I got the black truffle pizza. It seemed like that's one of the popular dish, but I found it disappointing. It's a little dry and salty. I'm not even sure they gave us the eggs, because I did not see any yolk. The rigatoni meatball pasta was very delicious. I loved the hidden crunchy-ness to the pasta, and the meatballs tasted very fresh delicate. Lastly, for dessert, we order the chocolate cake. A great way to wrap up our dinner. Overall, the presentation of the food was beautiful prepared. Although the truffle pizza didn't meet my expectation, I had still had a great overall experience here. Good food and great staff.

2.0,2/9/2019,"Went yesterday as part of restaurant week and was quite underwhelmed with the food. -Appetizer: fluke sashimi, crushed olive, lemon chili- good. Similar to a ceviche but less acidic.-Entree: organic fried chicken, spinach, buttery hot sauce- I was expecting a more traditional buttermilk-style coating but instead got more of a tempura/pankoy crust which I did not care for and peeled off. I really wish a description of the batter would have been included. Unfortunately, the dish really just reminded me of fancier version of sweet and sour chicken from basic chinese food places. The only good thing I can say about the dish was that the chicken was juicy and quite large but overall did not have much flavor. Would pass on this.-Dessert: passion fruit pavlova with whipped cream- this was essentially crusted meringue filled with passion fruit sorbet, the latter being the ""best"" part of the dish. The pavlova was rather bland in contrast to the tangy passion fruit. Would not recommend.Overall the service was very good but the food was just okay. Could have done without going. Would not recommend.",1,0,0,Ana D.,"Manhattan, NY",2,106,166

Decided not to wait to have fish cooked properly, asked for manage that never arrived. Asked for check and they had the nerve to charge me for the Kale salad, unbelievable.

3.0,1/31/2019,"Tried Public Kitchen on a weekday for restaurant week. Was able to get a reservation fairly quickly on OpenTable for the time slot that I wanted. Debated on their regular menu vs restaurant week, but opted to go for restaurant week instead. Started with the tomato soup which was prefect for a cold rainy day. Next for the entree I was between the chicken and salmon, the waiter recommended the chicken so opted to go with that, but it was poorly done and the sauce was just basically hot sauce thrown on to the plate. Should've gone with the salmon which I regret now. My friend had the hake which she thought was good. For dessert both of us ended up with the chocolate cake which was delicious.

2.0,12/15/2018,"Came here with a large group, about 10 of us, for a friends birthday. We made a reservation a few weeks in advance, which I recommend. The first thing I will note is that the ambiance of the hotel and the restaurant itself is very nice. We liked exploring the hotel and the garden of the restaurant before sitting down to eat. If you eat here, definitely check out the rooftop of the hotel and the restaurant garden. With that being said, the hotel is a little bit annoying with entry to its different parts. We had to exit the hotel and re-enter from a separate entrance to access the rooftop, and the bouncer was not particularly friendly and almost gave us a hard time, despite the fact that we had just eaten at the Public Kitchen. Regarding the restaurant experience itself, the food was actually pretty good. I tried a bit of the Black Truffle Pizza and I ordered the Grilled salmon as my main dish. Both dishes were delicious. However, the service here was absolutely awful. Our food took easily over an hour to come and we found ourselves waiting around at multiple points with our server nowhere to be found. One of our guests arrived late and wanted to place an order but never had a chance because our server never came back. We even debated skipping dessert because we had been sitting around for 2 hours eating and service was so slow. Overall, ambiance and food was good but the service and staff of the restaurant and other parts of the hotel (rooftop bouncers) are extremely poor and do not know how to treat guests.",0,0,0,Maya E.,"Manhattan, NY",306,140,96
2.0,12/6/2018,"While their hotel is very nice...the restaurant gave us such an unpleasant night...like...how this place is managed is ridiculous.1. Waited almost 30 min + for our main dish..the manager/host and the server came to our table like 5 times saying it's coming soon with no explanation..but sometimes that happens in restaurants... at least they were aware so whatever..2. The lady who wasn't our main server but helped our table, seemed to not understand English...I asked her to check the name of the wine that I was having..her facial expression seemed confused....and she disappeared for 15min and someone else brought an extra glass of wine...uhhh...strange...?? 3. Even a order of a glass of wine took forever to come....the place was not even 70% seated and they have so many floor staffs...so business cannot be an excuse...4. So the reason I asked to check my wine was..because it tasted the same as my first glass even tho I ordered a different one... Not surprisingly, on our bill, I was charged for two glasses of the same wine.

We also started with the squash onion rings dipped in a chipotle cheese sauce which was my favorite of all time! The fluke was a great option if you like sashimi. I am not a pizza fan except the black truffle pizza is Devine! My favorite pizza ever (but who can go wrong with truffle?) the steak was good as well as the lamb. The fish was subpar though. I believe that was the sea bass. Besides the fish, my only other complaint would be that when I asked the server if they had Riesling, she said only one that was really sweet, so I ordered the Chardonnay. When the manager came by to tell us the specials he mentioned a Devine Riesling that our server never mentioned. Upon ordering that, our waitress still had no clue what it was but it's ok!

For an almost $20 glass of wine it was served in what looked like a small water glass at a casual cafe, certainly not a restaurant by any renowned chef. The pork chop was a sad sliver of bland white meat with a long bone and some equally bland brown stuff piled on top. I almost sent it back but figured anything they sent back out wouldn't be worth the wait anyway. The side brussels sprouts were good so I ate mostly that. If it weren't for the storm I wouldn't have eaten here. And now I know in the future I'd be better off going to the hot deli from Whole Foods at the end of the block.

Had several appetizers; tuna tartare was a classic Jean-George preparation and actually better than many of his restaurants (except JG original NY)  as his signature appetizer. The truffle pizza was amazing and the potato pancake with smoked salmon had more than enough salmon. Squash potstickers were very good as well. Can't wait to go back and try others items on the menu.  We had gone for lunch and the menu at dinner is just similar with several entree additions. The service was excellent and the wine list was extensive with both glass and bottle options.  Well with the price paid for excellent food with the Jean-George quality of food.

The wait staff was warm and made us feel welcome and taken care of.  Food is outstanding.  I am not a pizza person, never like it actually but after trying their Black Truffle pizza, I cannot claim that now. My husband enjoyed his black cod tremendously, but found it too small a serving.  I believe he would have ordered another one had it not been for other foods we have on the table ;-)  Our friend liked his duck order very much.  I don't drink, but my husband and our friend enjoyed their wine as well.  Then came dessert which is my favorite part of the meal.  We had 3 desserts:  Bomboloni, Flan and the Lemon Merengue Tart.  First two are ok but the Lemon Merengue is delicious and an absolute standout. My husband mostly sticks to chocolate for desserts and never like lemon but he is now a convert. After the first bite, he is hooked.  The taste is very balanced, not overpoweringly lemony.  It's the best lemon dessert I have ever tasted.  Heavenly...just melts into your mouth!I also thought worth mentioning was the fact that the wait staff , prior to getting our orders, took it upon himself, to ask for any allergies we have.  I think this small touch shows the extent of care and details that must have gone into their training.  I would say we dine out quite often, most times with our daughter who is allergic to tree nuts, and we generally have to mention this issue, and bring it up ourselves before ordering.  So, I was pleasantly surprised that he beats me to it.Bottomline is we enjoyed last night's dining experience very much and would definitely go back.  That said, we will not hesitate to recommend this to all our friends as well.",0,0,0,Lily T.,"Manhattan, NY",1,39,0

It was truly enjoyable and came together with in-house bread and olive oil.For entrees, our friends selected the night special which is tomahawk steak which is good for 2 or 3 people served with mixed vegetables and potatoes, while I chose Rigatoni with meatballs. Others chose Salmon and sea bass dishes, but it was the tomahawks steak that stood out that night; it was huge, mouth watering and cooked medium well.We concluded our dinner with lemon meringue, chocolate layered cake and ice cream to share.

3.0,8/29/2018,"PROS:- good service from our waiter, Carlos. - gorgeous garden area - well made drinksCONS:- sloppy service from the kitchen - poor communication from the other staff- high prices for ""just okay"" food- cheeseburger debacle. Read in my reviewMy friends and I came here for Saturday brunch to celebrate my birthday. In my reservation I requested an outdoor table in their garden. When we were seated, I asked if we could be moved to one of the booth seats at the back. For a 1pm reservation, the place was only about a quarter full. For a seemingly simply request, it requires the manager to come out and assess the situation with one of the wait staff. We saw them walk past our table but nobody told us whether we could move or not. About 15 minutes after we had already received our first drink, I flagged down the waiter I had asked about moving. He looked at me confused and said, ""didn't anyone speak to you about it? That's why we these came out"", and motioned upward to the shade sails that had been extended. Okay. Not sure why they assumed we wanted to move for shade but I reiterated that we actually wanted to sit in the booth. He said he'd have to ask the host. She came out and told us no. That was fine. Another waiter then came up to us and asked if he had wanted to move. I said yes but we'd been told we could not to which he said it wouldn't be a problem, and be moved us. This was our waiter Carlos, who out of everyone we interacted with at Public Kitchen provided the best service. We ordered our food. Salmon latkes, chicken samosas, cheeseburger, kale salad and the grilled calamari. The latkes were generously topped with salmon though the latkes were super thin and more like a latke crisp! The samosas were delicious and full of taste. The calamari was also a great choice. The kale salad was lovely however not the freshest or full of crunch. I don't know if the hot day had prematurely wilted the leaves. Now, the cheeseburger. According to the menu, it comes with ""frizzled onion"" but it came without. It was sent back. It returned with many onions but...no cheese. Carlos was very hospitable about the situation and had the kitchen make another while suggesting we keep the cheese-less cheeseburger so that my friend wouldn't receive her new burger long ago we had finished eating. The manager also came out and apologized. The cheeseburger was taken off the bill. This was all appreciated but it's crazy that one meal had to be remade three times! We also ordered dessert. The bomboloni and lemon meringue tart. The bomboloni was average but the tart was great. Their cocktails are nice and very well made, but pricey. Ultimately, I wouldn't rush to return here. For the brand of Public Kitchen (and the hotel) I would have thought we would have had a much less problematic experience. While the food was mostly all good, it's also not spectacular for the overall price.",0,0,1,Su J.,"New York, NY",2,55,32
5.0,8/23/2018,"Big reason i am giving this place 5 stars is because I came here with a party of 8 people. One of my friends is allergic to dairy , she made it known and asked to make sure nothing was made with butter. The food came out, and apparently it wasn't communicated to the cooks or wasn't written down. The thing is, it's hard to tell if there is butter once the food comes to the consumer. The waitress noticed, and took the food back to the kitchen and gave our table a bottle of wine since she had to wait an extra 20-30 minutes for her meal as we all ate. It is wonderful to see a place that takes allergies seriously. I will come back. As for the food I came her for dinner and had the Spicy Tuna Tartare ( loved) and I had a pasta dish I don't see on the menu which had meatballs. This was also cooked very well. We ate outside, and all in all it was a great experience. A little tricky to find, but worth it.",0,0,0,Andrea G.,"Manhattan, NY",18,84,96

4.0,7/30/2018,"The food here is absolutely wonderful. And despite the number of seats in the dining room, the staff remained friendly and attentive throughout the meal - even during the dinner rush. My favorite dish of the evening had to be the broccoli dip. It comes with a grilled pita covered in everything seasoning and - when combined with the guacamole-like broccoli dip - made for a very satisfying bite. Other dishes I can recommend: the popcorn, tuna tartare, and squash blossom pizza were all out of this world. Honestly, my only regret of the meal was not taking a peek at their dessert menu. The most interesting dish I had was the cauliflower side. I had no idea it would be an entire head of cauliflower! But, it was perfectly prepared and the mustard sauce was a very nice touch. For such a high-class eatery, I'd say it's a steal for the price. I would definitely order it to share too. Whether you're staying at the hotel or just looking for an elegant dining experience, I'd definitely point you in the direction of Public Kitchen.

2.0,7/28/2018,"Four of us went for dinner for a birthday celebration. We all live nearby, so no one was staying at the hotel.The Good: We sat outside in the backyard courtyard. The atmosphere was lovely. The food was quite good.The Average: The servers were very nice, but the service was overall just OK. The waiter forgot to mention the specials and it took three requests to finally get lime for my water.The hallway to the bathroom was unreasonably dark and somewhat creepy. Several of the stalls were without toilet paper.The Ugly: After dinner we wanted to get a drink at the rooftop bar. We asked in the restaurant how we could get up there. Since we were not hotel guests, we could not access the roof by the elevators. That is sensible, and we completely understood. We were told we needed to go outside and enter from the front of the building. We attempted to do that. There was a roped off entrance and we were told we could only go in if we were ""on the list"". We explained that we just came from dinner in the restaurant and were told we could go to the rooftop bar by accessing the outside entrance. We were then told we should return to the restaurant and ask for ""Diego"" to get further instructions as to how we might get in. Really?I know this is an Ian Schrager Hotel, and maybe they are trying to recreate the guest experience of the original Studio 54, but making us feel like we had to ""beg"" to get in, after spending several hundred dollars for dinner, was just rude and elitist. If only those with prior reservations or VIPs are able to access the rooftop bar, we should have been told that from the start.I have lived in NYC my entire life. There are numerous high end restaurants and bars where patrons are treated like royalty. This was certainly not one of them. The food and atmosphere were very nice. Ordinarily, I would have planned a return visit in the future. However, after being insulted, my friends and I will not be returning.",1,0,0,Bonny B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,0

4.0,7/2/2018,"Stayed at The Public Hotel during my short visit to New York. the company I was with hosted a cocktail hour in the garden outside of the Public Kitchen, and so by the time it was over it was pretty late, and was looking for some food for dinner. Decided since it was late and most restaurants were closing in the area, we decided to have a seat in the hotel restaurant. Service was a little strange with multiple servers coming to our table at some point to get our drink order, food order, etc.  Even though their dinner menu seemed pretty upscale, I decided to go with the cheeseburger. I always worry about how good the cheeseburger is going to be on a menu full of pretty upscale food. I had nothing to worry about though, the burger was really delicious and flavorful.  Fries were not so fresh, but by the time we ordered it was probably closing time so I didn't have very high expectations. I was pretty happy with my meal though, and even had a slice of the mushroom pizza my guest ordered, and even that was delicious.  We also had an appetizer I can't remember the name of, it was a spicy chicken dumpling of some kind with cilantro dipping sauce I believe, this was also very delicious. I was very pleased with my meal, and grateful we were able to be served even though it was so late and I am sure they were trying to close up shop.",0,0,0,Rachel M.,"Auburn Hills, MI",6,114,179

2.0,6/22/2018,"If pretentious and trendy is your vibe, this place is for you. I came with a group, we ordered several apps, and they were excellent, namely the tuna tartar, octopus, and burrata. The entrees were meh. I had the sea bass, which apparently they were out of and had to replace with red snapper. It was completely flavorless, which is unacceptable for a pricey dish. My husband had the duck, which was over cooked. I've had much better. Dessert was good. Drinks are insanely overpriced. $18 cocktails?!The big kicker for me - and the big reason behind my 2 star review - is that after our group left (after spending 3 hours and A LOT on dinner) we were told by the ""bouncer"" to go stand somewhere else and to essentially get off their sidewalk. WHAT. This reminded me why I hate places like this and stay away from them. It's for the crowd that thinks they are better than everyone else. Not my scene!

4.0,5/27/2018,"The Public Kitchen has a down-to-earth setting with floor-to-ceiling windows that look out to its lush indoor garden. For starters, we got the green chickpea and spring garlic pot sticks with crispy leeks, dipped in sweet chili soy sauce. It should be noted here that I am a dumpling snob - any signs of inferiority (i.e. bland fillings, non-al dente skin, overstuffed spillage) will have me deserting (no pun intended) the dish in no time. This, however, was an explosion in the eating hole - you can at once taste the garlicky goodness with distinct hints of all the vegetables infused. Amazing, though non-traditional to say the least.Next came their signature black truffle pizza with a farm egg baked on top. This was pretty bland compared the kaleidoscope of flavors that we just ate, but you can't say it ain't fresh. The runny yolk oozed onto the collage of cheeses, soaking the charred dough so it's easier to chew. If you were smart, you'd keep the dumpling plate on the table so you can dip into the sweet chili sauce.Feeling more adventurous by the minute, we ventured into their famed veggies with some red curry roasted carrots with coconut and lime. To be honest, I couldn't really taste the curry, but the coconut added a bit more sweetness to the already farm-fresh sweet carrots. Eating veggies makes you feel like you don't need to hit the treadmill just yet, so we both ordered desert. I got the raspberry and vanilla tartufo bathed in a sauce of seasonal cherries. It was...sour. And the cherry sauce was very authentic to its nature - sour as well. So if sour is your thing (and it ain't mine), this must have been delicious.All and all, the Public Kitchen stays true to its mission - a farm-based, green initiative that brings farm-to-table cooking to life in a very accessible, millennial-friendly way.~4/5 stars for its calming ambiance, on-point service and overall freshness~",4,1,1,Kelly W.,"New York, NY",148,22,344
2.0,5/21/2018,"We live in the city, thought we'd try this out. Upon entering the bar area, I noticed it's combined with a coffee bar. One very long bar serving alcohol on one end, coffee and muffins on the other (obvs at different times of the day). Who wants to unwind with a martini fully aware that someone sat in the same spot a few hours earlier wolfing a muffin and a latte before their morning conference call? Similarly, who wants to begin their day with breakfast where people have been partying hours prior? It's a compromise Public Kitchen repeats maddeningly. For instance, the Maitre'd finds reservations...and then seats people, thereby compromising his job by leaving his post with a terse, ""be right back"" to other waiting diners. It's a small fail, but immediately the restaurant broadcasts ""inefficient and cheap,"" (or just disorganized) despite the pretty (if a bit cliche) Ian Schrager hallmarks--the warmth of the copper, especially around the escalators, the blending of living  greenery with focused lighting. In fact, one is reminded of more vital properties such as the Delano in South Beach, but sadly, it's ultimately a reminder you're not in South Beach, you're on an otherwise unremarkable block of the LES best suited to vehicular, not pedestrian, traffic. Anyhoo...we sat outside in the garden, which was a nice space, but the staff seemed uncoordinated and couldn't manage bread, drinks, and lighting the damn candle on the table. Staff were diverse and cool, but it seems like the hiring manager was going more for a look than competence. If they were going for aloof, they ended up with mildly resentful. Personally, I'd rather have a boring, nerdy server nail it perfectly than have some curated hipster doofus make fifteen small errors. The food was pretty good. After all, it's a Jean-Georges joint...but that's just the thing. It's not. It's Jean-Georges food at an Ian Schrager restaurant. There's not even a suspend-disbelief moment that this is anything but slapping a sponsor's decal on the hood of a car before a race. So the food was mostly quite good, but not enough to make up for the fundamental errors. All in all, it's a pretty place to go for drinks. And if I were staying in the hotel and ordered room svc, I'd be impressed by the food. Maybe that's the best way to enjoy Public Kitchen: remove all of the poor service and compromises and just pay for a room and have someone wheel it in for you and then exit. We won't be going back, but hopefully they figure it out. In time it could be a winner.",0,0,0,Corky L.,"Manhattan, NY",2,30,0

1.0,4/5/2018,"The waitress spelled some olive oil on my wool coat during my visit to the Public Kitchen in January and the way the management handled this situation is absolutely unacceptable. Right after incident happened one of the managers approached us and comped our drinks ( which was a really nice gesture) and promised that he would take care of the dry cleaning, he gave me his card and told me to send the bill to him as soon as i get it. It sounded great so I left without a doubt. After the cleaning was done, I've sent the email with receipt to general manager Walid Almaaz. No response. I waited a week, and sent another email. No response again. I called him. Somebody on the phone told me, that Walid was on a vacation (as a general manager he doesn't have anybody to take care of his emails, while he is on vacation?). I waited another week and called again. When I finally spoke to mr. Almaaz, he told me, that he doesn't work there anymore and I should reach out a manager on duty. So I called to the Public Kitchen and spoke to Christos (not sure, if that is correct spelling), he took my info, and said, that he needs to ""investigate"", and he would contact me later. It's fine, I understand, he needs to make sure, the episode has actually happened so I waited another week and nobody still reached out to me. I called again, the hostess asked my name, after that, she said that the manager was busy and he'd call me later. I waited and no one called me. I've called in couple days after - same story. Hostess asked my name, talked to manager and gave me the same answer - that he would contact me later. Its not even about the money for dry cleaning anymore it just shows that the Public Kitchen doesn't care about its clients, which is very upsetting as I trylly enjoyed coming here for brunch.

While this may seem minor, when the restaurant is charging $188 per person (not including drinks), you expect the service and the food to be on point. Spending $500+ on dinner for two is a lot of money, and I would expect the front of house staff to provide service commensurate with the price tag. Again, I've had much better service going to Applebee's or Denny's. If this is how Jean-George restaurants are run, I'll take my money elsewhere in the future.",0,0,0,Cornellian C.,"Ithaca, NY",0,5,0

The fluke and potstickers were decent, but nothing special.Cocktails were boring and wines were overpriced.For entrees, I had the bass which was hard to eat. The fillet was thin and not crispy on the skin side. The dish had no texture, as the cauliflower tabouleh underneath was soft along with the sauce on top which was a puree. We also ordered the lamb chops and chicken murphy.Lamb chops were very fatty and hard to eat. It came with a sauce, which just tasted like a homemade BBQ sauce and didn't compliment the dish very well.The chicken murphy seemed like chinese take out General Tso's....Unfortunately this was a completely let down..

The décor is very, very minimalistic. In fact, there really isn't any décor, but it works for the space. Service is quick and the servers are very accommodating. The food, however, wasn't that great- average at best. This was surprising to me because I usually really enjoy the Jean-George experience. I would definitely not recommend coming here with high expectations in mind. STAY AWAY from the Frico- so gross (hard cheese with popcorn stuck to it). The pizzas were stale and bland. There wasn't anything innovative, new, or exciting about the food (which is what I expected), but honestly I don't think most people minded. They were mostly all there for the scene anyways.

I expected the restaurant itself to be nicer considering the hotel it resides in - the rooftop is done up well, and not to mention the public has a certain ""reputation""! It does still have the same chic vibe thoughThe menu is supposed to have a theme: the chef's worldwide travels, which is reflected in the splattering of dishes (Italian, Thai, Mediterranean inspired)There were only two dishes that stood out:The burrata - the burrata itself was of great quality, and the figs and hazelnuts made it even more deliciousBlack truffle, farm egg pizza - the pizza crust was perfectly thin and crisp (probably thanks to their wood-burning oven), and the egg was runny. It is quite a portion though (6 slices), so we definitely over-orderedThere were quite a few misses too:Rigatoni with basil-pistachio pesto and brussels sprouts - very average pasta, the only saving grace was the basil-pistachio pestoRed curry roasted carrots - this was a very disappointing dish, especially considering what Jean-Georges can do with vegetables (think abcv)The wine list was good, service not so much - we had to wait 30 minutes for our table despite having a reservation and there being a bunch of empty tables in the restaurant, we had to flag down our server every time we needed something, and the manager thought it appropriate to adjust her pants in the middle of the dining roomPS: considering how hard it is to get a reservation here (aka a month in advance for a Fri/Sat night), don't be bummed out if you can't get one here, and head out elsewhere instead",2,0,0,Sargam M.,"Manhattan, NY",81,163,0

1.0,11/22/2017,"My girlfriend and I dined there on our last night in NYC. Hoping for a quiet, romantic dinner in a restaurant with atmosphere - we were bitterly disappointed. Prior to dinner we had had drinks in the roof top bar which was a great experience. We came down for dinner at our reserved time and were told we'd have to wait another 20mins. After being seated the first thing that hit us was the noise. Oh the noise. If you're from NYC then maybe this is normal but for us it was very uncomfortable. We couldn't talk to each other properly and without almost yelling at each other. The entree of pancakes with avocado was okay but tasted quite oily and a bit like a deep fried pizza. Also the avocado was unexpectedly spicy. The first plate was pesto penne which was quite nice and chosen as it was one of the few items without chilli. With that said it still had a bit of a bite. Our other plate was a creamy chicken dish which unfortunately my girlfriend couldn't eat due to the amount of chilli in it. I love spicy food but the chilli hadn't been mixed through properly and clumps of chilli are not the best way to enjoy a meal. We chose not to have dessert and left feeling let down. The menu appears to be focused around chilli to perhaps hide lack of creativity in flavour. The worst part though really was the unbearable noise level.",2,0,0,Al G.,"Kambah, Australia",0,1,0

SKIP! shrimp toast - absolutely awful. This one was one for the books. Was expecting something yummy like ABC's crab toast but this was like you took old stinky shrimp and blended It in a blender with gelatin and then put It on Wonder white bread. YUCK YUCK. So weird. Truffle pizza- weird doughy crust and the goopiest grossest cheese. How do you mess up truffle pizza???!! Stomach ache pizza. Kale salad - how about you actually toss the salad with dressing so it's not dry and nasty? Kale is a harsh lettuce and needs dressing and a bit of massaging to be even close to decent (easy to digest for that matter) why would you serve us a salad with 2 drops of dressing drizzled on top? just bizarre. Pesto rigatoni - whatever...nothing to write home about but not terrible. Carrot cake - BEYOND AWFUL DO NOT ORDER. This was dryer than an old boot!!!

2.0,10/24/2017,"We went here with a couple friend of ours who often cooks phenomenal meals for us at their apartment. Unlike our friends, we haven't lived in NYC long enough to have a rent controlled apartment (our friends are about 30 years older than us), so our apartment is too small to host them for dinner. And so, we decided to treat them to dinner here. BIG MISTAKE!Unless you're the type of person who has enough money to pay people to read your yelp reviews, you will likely be made to feel like a 2nd class citizen. I worked as a waiter/bartender for several restaurants in my formative years, so I try not to criticize service unless it's absolutely warranted. Like most average people out to a nice dinner, we wanted to have a special night where we could enjoy each others company, converse, and feel fancier than we actually are. This is not the place to do that. After being seated our waitress pushed us several times to decide on drinks. We weren't ready to order drinks, but after her 4th visit to our table within 7 minutes, we arbitrarily decided on some. Her annoyance with the fact that we didn't order a bottle, as she had suggested, was quite apparent. Unsurprisingly, the fact that we had the nerve to take our time enjoying our drinks before deciding on our dinner was unacceptable as well. I lost count of the amount of times our waitress came to our table to push us on our meal choices. When we finally did decide, she made it clear that we didn't order enough food (we ended up with leftovers), but she would put in our order and the food would come out in no particular order. The food came out, and was enjoyable. Perhaps the fact that we didn't see the waitress for almost the entirety of our meal made it taste even better than it actually was (see the most recent Eater write up). When it came time for dessert we ordered two dishes which were so-so and then paid the bill. But, BEFORE WE WERE ABLE TO FINISH THE DESSERT WE HAD PAID FOR WE WERE TOLD WE HAD TO LEAVE BECAUSE THEY NEEDED THE TABLE. Glad to see I wasn't the only one who had this type of experience. I was very fortunate to grow up with grandparents that took us out to meals at fancy places, so I know that this is not the typical treatment.

However, upon sitting down, the host informed us that the kitchen closes at 3:30, and we'd have to order immediately. The bday boy was running late (long story), but I ordered multiple dishes to share. We got the butternut squash dumplings, the truffle pizza, the pesto pasta, a chicken sandwich, and tuna tartare. No exaggeration, all those dishes came out within 7 minutes of ordering. We sat with five hot dishes in front of us. Our drinks hadn't even arrived yet, nor had our friend. Regardless of whether our friend was late or not, the pacing was completely off. I understand wanting to close the kitchen, but then don't take 3pm reservations. Oh! And they were out of smoked salmon so we couldn't order their signature lox and latke dish. This was pretty unreal. Again, I realize we're the last seating, but really? It's your main dish! They were also out of limes for my seltzer.The food itself was good, as was the presentation. I particularly liked the tartare, although it isn't a unique dish. I also thought the dumplings were perfectly done. The truffle pizza, however, was way, way too rich. I got a stomach ache from one slice. The pesto pasta was an interesting dish, with pistachio and Brussels sprouts, but I wouldn't visit for it. We got chocolate cake for the bday, and they were happy to use our own, funky candles. I can't believe how expensive a tiny slice cost. It's tasty, though, has wafers in it.More generally, I loved the restaurant's vibe. I wish we could have sat outside, but I guess it isn't ready yet.

She didn't give us any time to make a decision and seemed annoyed when we wanted some time to look at the menu. My friend ordered the pesto pasta and asked to remove the additional nuts that came on top of the pasta. As soon as the pasta came out the waitress asks my friend if she's allergic to nuts since the sauce has some. Don't you think the waitress would've brought this up when my friend first ordered? Thankfully she wasn't allergic. Everything we had was amazing. It was just the service that sucked. To top it off the waitress brought us our check with an additional item that we didn't order.

We got a black truffle pizza to share, and if you like truffles, I definitely suggest. For main, we went with a cheeseburger and Maine lobster. Each of these came easy to share (cut up) and everyone got a taste. Both AMAZING. Finally, for dessert (total overkill), we went with the chocolate cake with the peanut butter ice cream which was incredibly delicious.

The servers do warn you that dishes come out separately which is a trend I don't love because it just seems like a thinly veiled excuse for a kitchen that can't get it's timing right. The busboys were remiss in giving us basic items like cutlery, or taking them away too soon. Two diners in our party ordered the same dish, and one of them had to wait an additional 20 minutes for his after we had already waited for 45 minutes for our mains. The busboy ironically cleared his cutlery away as he was awaiting his delayed food. The manager came out to apologize but even after that, there were serious issues in service (coffee served at least 15 minutes before desserts ever appeared). The only item that was comped was the main course that was delayed; I didn't expect any freebies but a round of drinks or even desserts would have built more goodwill.

The menu is the norm farm to table splendor of devine flavors. Having enjoyed Jean Georges many restaurants, this one does not disappoint.Dishes are meant to be shared. Start with the popular tuna tartare on avocado with ginger yuzu and rice puffs. Shrimp toasts are lovely with water chestnut, pear, mustard purée. Silky butternut squash minestrone. Fire grilled margarita pizza with chipotle chili powder with just the right texture of charred crust. Drinks are all good too.

3.0,9/20/2017,"Upon entering this chic modern hotel.. my first impression was ok where do I take my first awesome pic! Public kitchen is located right in the back of the hotel as you walk pass the mesmerizing escalator that entices you to take out your phone and snap away. We needed to make reservations 1 month in advance for this booked spot.  Finally today we got to try out this place and I was really pleased with the appetizers. Although the portion was small and quite pricy, it was definitely worth it. My favorite items ordered was :Sliced fluke pickled cherry peppers sea salt sesame (highly recommended) Corn and basil potstickers (you definitely taste the corn) Spicy tuna tartare, ginger,  yuzu puffed rice cracker (amazing!!!!!) Shrimp toast, water chestnuts, pear jam mustard (least favorite on my list, it was blah for me) As for my entree I ordered the:Seared salmon manhattan clam chowder chili oil,this would've been great if I would've let the waiter know ahead of time to cook my salmon well done. If not it comes out cooked on the outside but a bit raw on the inside. The dish pairing with the clam chowder on the bottom was delicious and creative. My bf got the Soy garlic marinated steak, broccoli fermented black bean sauce (good pick also) Our friend got the Roasted hake, tangy-spicy stewed peppers, crunchy potato flowers (he wasn't thrilled since hake is from the cod family so its got that fishy smell) Overall, the appetizers take the trophy over the entrees. Great spot with lit candles, intimate setting to sit back have a nice glass of wine to pair with one of the recommended appetizers.

Public hotel is definitely living up to the hype of the new trendy did I mention? Oh yea pretentious spot to be.Once we checked in at the hostess desk, we were seated immediately. Our waiter was very friendly. And accommodating. One of my friends didn't know what to order and the waiter surprised him with a great dish that he was sure my friend would like. And he was right! My friend loved it (order the sliced fluke pickled cherry peppers) this was bomb! We ordered a few appetizers before our entrees arrived. Corn & basil potstickers, tuna tartare and shrimp toast.  All small portions and very tasty.  For the main course I got the soy garlic marinated steak.  Ordered it medium, but it came out little less than medium, the dish was delicious  and still edible for me so it wasn't an issue.  The marinade on the steak was the deal breaker for the steak for sure. Delicious and perfect pairing. Not to mention you get a side of broccoli. Gotta get those greens in.

The hostess was a bit off - we asked for a table, and she kind of hummed and wandered off, wordlessly grabbed our menus and then led us to our table. This set the tone for the rest of our service - our server would have odd bursts of fake smiles and energy whilst completely ignoring us when we attempted to flag him down - particularly when he realized we weren't ordering alcoholic drinks. We ordered the basil/corn gyoza to start - a unique, refreshing take on dumplings. For some reason, this was the last dish to come out, but it was the star. The fried chicken sandwich was bland and boring in comparison, though super garlicky. The truffle pizza was amazing, but a bit oily and charred for my taste.

3.0,9/10/2017,"I've been to public kitchen twice now, and have mixed feelings. To summarize: this restaurant has potential to be great, but in my two visits it has fallen well short of the mark.The space is beautiful, great atmosphere. The food is good. Not great... but worth the price, which isn't too crazy. Unfortunately, the service is a dumpster fire. On my second visit the restaurant was half full, but the waitstaff couldn't keep up. When we arrived for our reservation, we gave our name to the hostess, who wordlessly picked up the appropriate number of menus and walked off into the dining room. We hesitated and then followed. Taken alone this was strange manners but forgivable. In the context of the rest of the meal it was a harbinger of the service to come. Food was coming out cold, they had two managers delivering food despite having about the right number of waiters for the half full space, and there were lots of missed details (ex. Only refilling the coffees of half our table and then walking away). I heard someone at the table next to us flag down the manager and claim that they had been seated half an hour before but still hadn't had anyone come to their table. So the service was performing poorly in general but what we found especially strange was that there was that no one seemed to care. The servers were lackadaisical at best. Typically I would chalk this experience up to a bad day, which is what I did after my first visit. The service was similar that time, so I waited a month so they could iron out any kinks and gave it another go. The service had actually declined by the second visit rather than improved. I hope this restaurant can find their stride in the long run. We've come to expect a lot from both Vongerichten and Schrager, but this one is a dud so far.",4,0,0,Matt F.,"Manhattan, NY",180,4,0

Hence I suggested meeting here. A place to see and be seen.He got the steak in fermented black bean sauce and garlic, decorated with chili pepper and broccoli. Lovely players yet both of us felt the meat was slightly too salty to our liking. Not a top notch cut; given the moderate price , prob shouldn't be surprised.I got the watercress, baby kale salad in spicy herb avocado dressing , horseradish. Optionally, topped it with grilled salmon, medium rare . The salmon was exceptionally prep, just the way I like it. The dressing a bit too acidic; I would reimagine it better with tahini sauce rather than mixed with horseradish. It went very well with the Grenache I picked.

2.0,8/27/2017,"Sorry, folks. My experience here in no way measured up to what others have described. My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast one weekend around 10 AM. We got seated immediately (it was half empty), and my boyfriend had great coffee. Unfortunately, things went downhill from there. Our server took our order promptly, but then it took around 40 minutes for our food to arrive, which was pretty ridiculous given that the place wasn't even close to full. There was no explanation as to why things were taking so long and no apologies when we finally got served. I ordered the goat cheese and spinach omelette, which was fine and not dry (my usual problem with omelettes), but it wasn't worth a 40-minute wait. The presentation was also pretty pathetic. It came with about 5 home fried potatoes and a few sad cherry tomatoes. It looked almost as if they had run out of the sides and given me whatever little bit they had left. The potatoes were bland, and the tomatoes were fine, but sort of mystifying as to why they were part of the meal. No complaints about the rye toast. My boyfriend got the French toast with peaches, bacon, and maple syrup, except that there wasn't a peach in sight when it arrived, just a few anemic looking strawberries. The French toast itself was, to be blunt, awful. I had a bite and couldn't even finish it. It tasted like batter--meaning it was utterly flavorless--and was partially charred. He tried drowning it in syrup and butter to perk up the flavor to no avail. He thought about ordering something else, but we opted to pay and leave instead given how long the food had taken to arrive.

I'm always skeptical of celebrity restaurants because they are generally invariably disappointing. However, I'm a big fan of JG's other restaurants (ABC Kitchen/Cocina, Perry St) and so I wanted to give Public Kitchen a try. We came here for brunch - and I was very pleased! Space is bright, airy and very trendy in the back of a hotel with surrounding gardens. We ordered the basil/corn gyoza, smoked salmon latkes, and the black truffle pizza.Complimentary bread - stiff and flavorless. That's okay though, bread can be a huge plus but is not a dealbreaker for me.Basil/corn gyoza - delish. Usually I am against ordering vegetarian dishes (tbh, I kind of hate vegetables) but this was worth it! Delicious and surprising, the best combination of flavors.Smoked salmon latkes - tasty, but nothing special. Basically, tasted exactly how you might imagine. Given the price, dishes have gotta be at least a little bit special. Would not order again.Black truffle pizza - yes, yes, a thousand times yes! A thick cheesy chewy truffle-y gooey (mm runny egg) type of pizza - so, not for the thin crust purists. Warm and delicious. Perfect for breakfast. Large portion. Reasonably priced for NYC. Reservations needed.

Atmosphere- Modern design typical of Ian Schrager, open and airy with windows onto back garden, sleek concrete floors and marble tiled walls.- Large comfortable space with plenty of room between tables.- Partially open kitchen with wood fired oven and grill.FoodVery good!  We began with the Beet and Strawberry Salad with Pickled Shallots and Pistachios ($14), a heavier salad given the main ingredient but nevertheless well-balanced.  The Corn and Basil Potstickers ($14) had a delightful pan fried crust, and delicate fresh wrappers, though you get only four smallish dumplings for the price.  We could not resist trying the Black Truffle Pizza with Farm Egg ($22), a VERY decadent treat that tastes as good as it looks.  For main, we selected the gigantic Beef Short Rib ($34) which was on special that evening.  The succulent meat had a deep, smokey flavor from the wood burning oven which made for true depth in flavor.  Hope it goes onto regular menu.  To conclude, the Basil Panna Cotta ($11) was a nice palate cleanser with amazing basil flavor.BeverageSampled several of the cocktails seated at the bar, all of which were enjoyable and at a good price for NYC ($15).  The Passion Chili Sour in particular stood out as well balanced and refreshing.  Ginger Margarita, Pineapple Spritz and Royale were also nice.With dinner, we ordered a bottle of the 2008 R. Lopez de Heredia Viña Cubillo Crianza ($66) which paired nicely with our short rib main and was priced reasonably versus retail.  Wine list is ordered in terms of how selections pair with various dishes, helping quickly select a bottle that will match the overall meal.  While the list has a number of interesting selections, I wish they had more $75 and under bottles.Service- Our waitress Charisse was exceptional, very attentive and great at guiding us through the menu.  One of the better waitresses we have had in a while.- Bar area still working out some kinks.  Not addressed nor taken drink orders despite making multiple eye contacts until we finally got a seat.  Took a very long time, but once served the bar tenders were very nice.",2,0,0,D.

I was intrigued by the truffle and egg pizza, so I gave it a try - it was rich and buttery with huge truffle flavor, and I highly recommend it as I haven't seen a pizza like it in the city. If it's not on any Best Of lists yet, it should be. My husband enjoyed the steak with fermented bean paste (I tried it as well and it had a wonderfully smoky wood-fired flavor) and my daughter was thrilled with her salmon dish.I would recommend this restaurant for a date night or a business dinner as well as just for a family night out - it is elegant but not pretentious, the service is outstanding, the cocktails are creative, and children are not just welcome but doted on. Thank you for a delicious meal! We will definitely return.",0,1,2,Brenda A.,"Santa Clara, CA",66,95,259

4.0,7/3/2017,"An incredible dining experience, but a few new restaurant kinks need to be worked out before this one can earn 5 stars in my book.  The drinks were really good and a great way to begin the meal.  The waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and made great recommendations.  We order the basil pancakes as an appetizer and we then watched as they were delivered to the table next to us.  We finally received an appetizer, but it was not the one we ordered.  Thankfully we were told it was on the house and we were able to experience the amazing pot stickers.  The basil pancakes were good when they arrived, but the pot stickers were definitely the clear winner.  My dinner arrived first and then my boyfriend received...a plate of carrots.  We said that this was not the ""entree"" he ordered and soon after his steak arrived.  The chicken entree was very good and I would order it again.  My boyfriend's steak was undercooked, but still good.  Despite my boyfriend noting on our reservation that we were celebrating my birthday, nothing was done by the restaurant.  We still had a lovely meal and would return to try other things, but it was not the 5 star experience we had hoped for.",1,1,2,Ally B.,"Manhattan, NY",13,218,515
5.0,6/29/2017,"This meal was as good as it gets.It is a sampling menu and I find that at most restaurants like that, they waiters tell you to order way more than needed, but at Public Kitchen it was the perfect amount.We started with the kale salad. It was amazing, but my least favorite of everything we got. If you go and don't get the Tuna Tartar, you are doing it all wrong. I want to eat this dish every day for the rest of my life. We then had the truffle, egg pizza which was perfect and then the cauliflower. I am so not a mustard fan, but I have to say it worked so well on this dish.We had the hake and salmon as our main course. I wasn't obsessed with the hake, but I never really am. The salmon, though, was amazing. Our desserts were the Tartufo and linzen. The pistachio ice cream was so good, I wanted a whole bowl of it, and so was the strawberry linzenOur waitress was Nikki and she was so good and attentive. You are lucky if you get her.I have generally been disappointed recently in the restaurants around NYC. However, Public Kitchen gave me hope that the food world is coming back. Definitely walk around the hotel after, Ian Schrager did a great job of designing it.",1,0,2,Samantha S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",302,39,27
5.0,6/26/2017,"Went here last week for dinner and was blown away. Not only was the food absolutely delicious (you must order the Frico!) but the service made the night extra special. The waiter was attentive to all of our needs and the wine the sommelier recommended was a perfect pairing. The atmosphere, both inside the restaurant and out on the garden terrace, was perfection as well. Can't wait to come back!!",0,0,1,Georgia C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0
5.0,6/25/2017,"I came here this evening with my Mom and her boyfriend who are visiting me in NYC for the first time and we were absolutely blown away. To start, the restaurant is gorgeous, perfectly lit, and spacious. The music is great and not too loud as hotel restaurants often are. Our server Brad was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Additionally, while he was our primary sever, there were several other men clearing dishes and checking in on us throughout the night that were equally as wonderful and atentive.  Last but certainly not least, the food was to die for. I might note that my mom is a fantastic chef herself and I am always anxious to take her out as she is so often disappointed. With that said, this was evidently not the case this evening as I witnessed her scrape the last drops of sauce left on the plate on multiple occasions. We had the tuna tartare, basil pancakes with guacamole, and the corn Thai basil potstickers to start which were all unbelievable. Our personal favorite was the potsticker dish which had a beautiful sweet, spicy, smoky sauce. For mains we had the lobster, the steak, a margarita pizza, and the roasted curry carrots. The lobster had crispy onions and corn which were covered in a light buttery lemon sauce. It perfectly balanced richness with flavor allowing the lobster to be the star (as it should be). The Pizza was delicious and had a wonderful crust that was both crispy and soft. There was a perfect cheese to sauce ratio and the mozzarella was exceptionally flavorful and gooey. The steak was TO DIE FOR and I am not someone who typically loves steak. It was perfectly cooked (medium rare) as it melts in your mouth while also having a crispy seared exterior. Also, the soy marinade was ingenious in an unexpected way. The carrots were also amazing and they were accompanied by a tangy sweet lime yogurt sauce. Even though we were extremely full after this feast, we decided to split the tartufo per Brad's recommendation. I must say I was highly skeptical of this dessert as I generally do not like fruit mixed with chocolate. However, I was once again pleasantly surprised as the creaminess of the pistachio perfectly balanced the richness of the chocolate and the tanginess/sweetness of the cherries (reminded me of the odd melon prosciutto combo)This meal was an unforgettable experience and I am so grateful to the staff and chefs that made it possible. The only reason I would ever consider giving this restaurant less than 5 stars is because I worry that in time it will become too popular and I won't be able to come back.",2,0,0,Liana N.,"Orinda, CA",428,10,3
5.0,6/25/2017,"Dinner for 3 last night was amazing! Everything on theMenu was absolutely delicious, the vibe was very cool/Chic, and staff was super attentive and friendly. There's a sommelier on hand if you need a great wine reccomendation, cocktails are superb too. To start we had the basil potstickers (so good we ordered another one), tuna tartare, and burrata. I love burrata and the heirloom tomatoes were to die for. Next we ordered the truffle pizza with all its yolky goodness and the shortrib. For dessert we had the raspberry cheesecake and the peach cobbler- both perfectly composed dishes. 5 stars all around.",0,1,0,Melissa P.,"New York, NY",22,85,10

I cannot express in words how great the atmosphere is, how wonderful the staff are, and above all how wonderful our Somm Jillian was. She was insightful, witty, more than helpful, and the pièce de résistance.

5.0,6/23/2017,"A really fantastic meal, with an interesting menu concept. Service was impeccable, and staff knowledge was very impressive considering the restaurant and team is still in its infancy.

5.0,6/23/2017,"Public Kitchen was, simply, one of the best dining experiences I've had in New York. First - the hotel itself is absolutely immaculate.  It has a modern feel - with sleek design elements, as well as accessible and logical details.  It definitely delivers on the promise of ""luxury for all.""There are several new spaces to check out - but I'd say the best to start with are Diego (for a cocktail and the INSANE views) and Public Kitchen (for the incredible food.)Exec chef Tom McKenna DELIVERS, in a big way.  There's a half-open kitchen, which I always like - you can see the chefs working behind chic pendant lights.  We tried A LOT of dishes, but the standouts were the Frico (which I'll get to in a second,) the potstickers, tuna tartare (Ben's favorite), and the asparagus pizza.FRICO - where have you been all my life!? It's a layer of crispy popcorn covered in thin, crunchy cheddar and dusted with herbs.  Completely addictive snack that I predict will be the runaway favorite dish here - they'll need to watch out for copycats.The Asparagus pizza was another standout - I'd never had this type of combination before, and the superthin sliced asparagus contributes a fresh flavor to the light dough, topped with generous servings of pepperoni.  Outstanding - a tough grade to achieve in a pizza-obsessed city like NYC.Service was prompt and polite, not overbearing.  The rose champagne was flowin' on a beautiful June evening.  This innovative team is really raising the bar for accessible high-end cuisine.  Public Kitchen has already hit their stride, and I can't wait to come again.",10,7,8,Emily R.,"Manhattan, NY",452,361,4
