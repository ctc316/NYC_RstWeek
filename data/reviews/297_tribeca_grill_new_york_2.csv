1.0,4/29/2019,"One of my worst experiences ever. The service was just fair.  As for the food, a nightmare!  Was recently there with three others for dinner and all of us had issues with the food. From over cooked & dry to under cooked.  Started with the mold on the bread & sand in the salads.

4.0,4/8/2019,"So why would anyone come here?  Its certainly not the food, the bar is ""OK"", but the main reason is the wine list.  Serious collectors and aficionados come to spend $$$$ on wine, some allocations which simply cant be found elsewhere.  THIS is Tribeca Grill.  Get something simple like a rare filet and splurge if you know your DRC from your DOC.  Corporate expense account may be required if you didn't invest in the series A offering of Google.",0,0,0,Jelly B.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,49,8

2.0,2/27/2019,"I'm sad.  Tribeca Grill is pretty much a downtown institution.  We decided to try it for brunch on a Sunday.  I made a last minute reservation and we headed straight over.  The restaurant was maybe 1/5 full when we got there.  We were seated immediately by a very friendly hostess.  We ordered:CORNBREAD - Seemed fresh but quite dry.  1 MIMOSA - Standard mimosa.  1 BLOODY MARY - Dining partner got a Bloody Mary and was very excited about said Bloody Mary.  Upon receiving it, he mumbled something angrily to himself under his breath and immediately grabbed the pepper grinder from the middle of the table.  Conclusion: definitely not a good Bloody Mary.  EGG SANDWICH ($11) - scrambled eggs and cheddar cheese with pesto on a roll and potatoes on the side.  Very mediocre; not a lot of flavor and the pesto was extremely oily.  Did not like the roll.  EGGS BENEDICT W/ CANADIAN BACON ($19) - Oi.  This was not good.  Very bready muffin base, not good.  Extremely fatty Canadian bacon; hardly any ""meat"".  Hollandaise was not truly a hollandaise and had more of a consistency / color of spicy mayo.  The one good thing that I was surprised by? - the cook on the poached egg was perfect.  Who would've figured?  CAPPUCCINO & HOT CHOCOLATE - Standard drinks.  All in all, we were there for almost two hours.  Service, while super nice, was a little slow given how few people were there.  Would consider coming back for dinner, but won't return for brunch.",1,0,0,Jenn P.,"Manhattan, NY",285,134,933

Hands down the lamb parpadelle was to die for and their steaks were all cooked to perfection. The chef (Brenton I believe) really knows how to whip up some extraordinary seasonal dishes. Out of this world! The servers pay attention to every little detail and literally almost every request is adhered. The sommeliers really know what they're doing when it comes to wine selection and don't try to upsell you like most restaurants these days. This place is genuinely awesome and honestly a must try.

We were told the bartender was ""new"". The Caesar salad was SUPER fishy. I know some people love that, but, I thought the server should have provided a heads up. We both got the brown butter sage ravioli, which we were told by our server was amazing. This is a dish we have had many times at other restaurants. This was a poor representation.

3.0,10/28/2018,"On decor and atmosphere alone, this place gets 5 stars. It's a very inviting set-up whether it's for after work drinks or dinner.I recently went here for happy hour to meet with my sis. She had been dying to try it so I gave in. We sat at the bar and ordered happy hour wine and a number of small plates/apps from the happy hour menu. We had the grilled octopus, chicken fingers, buffalo mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto and a cheese plate. The grilled octopus was my favorite--served on a bed of some type of red pilaf rice like grain. Unfortunately the chicken fingers had zero flavor. It came with what was supposed to be a dipping sauce I was hoping would help, but it was basically ketchup so I ended up feeling like I was a kid eating bad nuggets with ketchup. The buffalo mozzarella was okay, but the quality of the prosciutto was not that impressive to me. I did enjoy the cheese selection they offered but I suppose that's harder to mess up.All in all it was a decent experience. Service at the bar was fine, not exceptional. And no it wasn't crowded at all at the time so that wasn't the excuse.I doubt I will go back for anything other than drinks but it's a food place to catch up with friends.",3,0,0,Garynn N.,"Brooklyn, NY",219,126,139
2.0,10/26/2018,"I was not a big fan.  I brought a client here because he was a De Niro fan.  On first entering, the place was Gorgeous but the experience went down hill from there. The server was very inattentive and was difficult to find when drinks were empty (which was constantly). I found the food to be very over priced for the quantity and quality of the food. I had the filet mignon which was over cooked and under seasoned (come on.  Salt and pepper is not that hard). For dessert I had the creme brûlée which was average to good (sadly it was the highlight of the meal).Overall you go here because of your you are star struck with De Niro.  Out side of that, it's not a place I would go to again.

I highly recommend the pan roasted salmon, the Amish chicken with the cheeseburger. Overall a 10/10 experience. Followed by dessert of the chocolate cake and it was rich and flavorful that it was a legit an explosion on chocolate in my mouth. I've never appreciated it more so to speak.

Everyone deserves a second chance so when my colleague suggested we go there I was apprehensive but agreed. What a mistake that was. If your in the city don't waste you time or money in this dump. The only thing worth anything in here is the bar from Maxwells Plums and trust me this is far from a Maxwell Plums.

They seamed inexperienced. Everybody got their dishes wrong and when they tried to correct it they bumped at each other and almost spilled the food. My uncle didn't get his dish with ours. After a few minutes of awkward confusion it turned out the waiter had served my uncle's dinner to a different table. Luckily he managed to retrieve it before the food was touched. Yikes!The great thing about going to restaurants with my family is that we get to have a bite of each other's food. That way if anyone order a not so good dish if we decide to come back to the same restaurant we order something different. Sadly, for the first time ever every single course my family ordered SUCKED big time. Food was just plain mediocre all around!!! Even the bread roll brought to our table was stale and tasteless. Appetizers: Lamb meatballs (just ok. They were nicely seasoned, but they were served cold and that made them taste greasy). Calamari (poorly seasoned and lacking that needed crisp). Main Courses: Pork chop (Horrible!! Not seasoned properly and undercooked! It came in what I can only describe as a tasteless watered down messy pool of cold broth with raw veggies floating around). Filet Mignon just MEH. It was served with a small portion of regular mashed potatoes. Absolutely NOTHING special about it.

I dined there on Friday night with 3 friends, and it was superb from start to finish! I had a cocktail with the featured mescal (freaking delicious!) and it was phenomenal. For dinner we tried the octopus starter, salmon tartare, fresh PEI mussels, fried calamari with an incredible aioli, beet salad, and wild mushrooms. They were ALL amazing! For dinner we had the cod, the duck, the pork, and several sides, including the best Brussels sprouts any of us had ever had! For dessert the banana thing (not the correct name!) was outrageous as were the chocolate cake and the Tahitian vanilla creme brûlée. The creme brûlée was the BEST I have ever had - anywhere ever!

And like most American restos, as soon as we sat down our server pushed the alcohol menu. This is when we slow our server down and order our way. I started with the grilled octopus which was absolutely light and lovely and went really well with the bed of chick peas. Would go back just for that! Then I had the lobster cavatelli which had excellent layers of flavor with the kale and sweet potato. Only thing?  Would have loved that dish to be more rustic with bigger dices instead of the tiny evenly squared pieces I got. It looked too manufactured like it was produced by some machine rather than a chef. Oh, and I stole a few of my husband's scallops that were done to perfection and teamed up perfectly with my lobster. Would definitely hook that up again!

The bathrooms are kind of scary in the sense that you have to seemingly leave the building and go down to a basement. I found myself questioning if I was going the wrong way the entire time. I felt like I was trespassing. Either way that's not at all a strike against the restaurant. It was just weird. We had a prefix choice for lunch. I ordered the arugula/mozzarella/tomato salad, followed by an veal, lamb, bacon fettuccini ragu, and finished off with a creme brûlée. My salad was pretty good, no complaints there. The Ragu had a good flavor to it and tasted like fresh pasta. The creme brûlée was my favorite. It's one of the best I've had. The service was great. Everyone was kind and despite how I drink water like a fish, they always kept my cup full. Food did take a while. We arrived at 12:30 and received dessert at 3.

The bottle beer was good though, as I do like it a little warm. The other positive is that it was convenient to where I had to go, but please don't be fooled like I was.

3.0,10/13/2017,"3.5 stars. After a viewing of an indie flick at the Tribeca Screening Room, a few of us decided to come here for drinks/food tonight.. I had already eaten prior to the viewing, but was able to squeeze in an appetizer.There were 5 of us and at the start, it seemed like an eternity to get some water let alone a wait staff employee to swing by. Service was pretty sluggish at first.Once they did come by, service became more consistent. The table placed their order for apps (to share) and entree. I was content with a glass of wine and appetizer to myself.My app served as my main and I selected the grilled octopus which was accompanied by some beans (lima?) and on a bed of black squid ink. I chose a glass of Reisling to accompany it.The rest of the table selected meatballs and octopus to share and pasta for main (with pesto, lobster sauce and Bolognese). They also drank wine.Verdict?While the flavors/ aroma of the apps and main  were distinct and delicious, I really didn""t have to be concerned about getting too full ( I should add that we also received a warm dinner roll to start).In other words, the portions really raised my eyebrows. My selection was one thin 5 inch octopus strip and honestly for $18, it was laughable. Everything else brought to the table smelled good but again, the portions were skimpy.The group was also feeling dessert of which a pumpkin cheesecake and blackout cake was ordered. I didn't taste either.So yes, while the food appeared and tasted good, there just wasn't much of it.Luckily, I had a first dinner since I walked out paying $40 for one appetizer and a glass of wine (including tip/tax). Could probably consider it a dessert.Btw, ambiance was lovely.",0,0,0,Johanna B.,"Brooklyn, NY",468,560,1574

As it was dark on our last visit we were surprised how vibrant the neighborhood was seeing it in the daytime. Wish the weather had been just a bit warmer to eat outside but inside was warm and inviting. We were welcomed by the hostess and shown to our seats. They knew about my wife's allergy and were very accommodating. Our waiter was Fantastic. Really nice and he actually acted like he cared about my wife having an allergy. We each had the 3 course price fixe lunch meal. I started with a Caesar salad, the farm raised Amish chicken and then a Creme Brule for dessert. My wife had the beet salad, the salmon and the chocolate cake. Everything was perfect. My salad was delicious but was huge. Really to much for one person. But it was tasty. The chicken was perfectly cooked and they gave me extra fingerling potatoes as i am not fond of the greens they were serving. Really tasty and delicious. Many times when my wife orders salmon the chefs either send it out dry because the sauce they have already prepared has shallots in it or they will make up something that is not very tasty. Almost as if they try and punish you for having an allergy that asks them to do something out of the ordinary. This kitchen did not do that and the salmon and sauce were perfect. And well the desserts were sweet and wonderful and as a special treat our waiter brought out a basket of fresh hot delicious doughnut holes just out of the fryer. Wow!

3.0,7/3/2016,"As someone who works down the block, I come here quite often for a drink.  This place's big allure is that it's co-owned by Robert De Niro and is often frequented by celebs living in the neighborhood.  The space itself is quite beautiful and open, with massive light fixtures keeping the space on the dimmer side of well-lite.  They have plenty of tables for grabbing a full meal (with a few tables outside overlooking Greenwich St), with an oval bar in the middle of the room (which can get a bit awkward as the room fills up).The food is generally good, with a clearly American menu (the Long Island Duck Breast is exceptional).  That said there isn't much of a ""wow factor"" with the menu, so you're paying a bit of a premium for Tribeca/De Niro over the complexity of the menu itself.  That said, the bar menu does not disappoint.  Do yourself a favor and at least try the chicken fingers (the honey mustard is so good that patrons tend to ask for the recipe) and the burger (which if I recall, is on an english muffin).  The drink menu is fairly diverse, ranging from cocktails to Icelandic beers (again, all a bit overpriced).  Service behind the bar could probably be improved a bit (they get overwhelmed quickly) but they are very welcoming and inviting.All in all, definitely one of those places that every New Yorker should try, but you probably won't be blown away by the experience.",0,0,0,Matt K.,"New York, NY",262,93,22

My mother, who absolutely cannot stand the thought of curry could taste a slight bit of the spice in the soup but still enjoyed it anyway, that's how great it was! The outside of the chicken was crunchy and buttery, soo good. It was a bit undercooked for my liking, bit I still loved every bit of it. The barley and squash on the side was equally delicious. Tribeca chocolate cake was to die for. Tried some of my mom's crème brulee..and wow..spectacular! Almost better than the chocolate cake.

2.0,5/9/2016,"I was disappointed with my experience here. I have heard good things, and its a well known traditional new york city spot. Also owned by the awesome Mr. Robert Dinero. I came here for a friends birthday, the ambiance is really great! To start, i ordered a manhattan up, and it was a terribly sad pour- my martini glass was less then half full, and my friends next to me was full. In addition, I used to be a bartender, and know how to pour a proper 3oz drink. When I asked the waitress if she could have my drink remade she just sorta shrugged me off and told me i was wrong and that it was a good pour. Fine, whatever- drinking licenses are expensive I get it. I started with a caesar salad: It was bland, and too small with literally nothing on it. It was a brown bowl with a few romain leaves and some dressing, and a couple croutons. I was really disappointed. Then for dinner I ordered the scallops, with risotto. The scallops were really tasty, and cooked great. The risotto was again, really sad. It was like flavored water with uncooked rice. It may sound silly to be so upset over a bowl of rice, but a place with this stature should know better then to serve severely undercooked risotto, I didnt even eat it! A major disappointment for me only enjoying a few scallops for $35. Lastly, after dropping our bill the waitress disappeared for literally 25 minutes. We were at a birthday party and had a show to catch and she made us have to track her down. We also missed some of the beginning. Thats just such a small little thing that any respectable waitress should know not to do. Over all pretty disappointed, the risotto was the worst of it all.

Now I wouldn't say this is the worst dining experience I have ever had, as staff was extremely polite however- total let down in overall service and the food was Meh. I am a foodie and restaurant week is one of my favorite events of the year and this was my first restaurant to try and it was sooooo disappointing!We came the day after the big storm, not too many people dining. Once sat, the server didn't approach with menus until about 15 mins after. Very sweet and polite however made us wait throughout the meal too often and they didn't appear to be understaffed, we were approached more by bussers. Now the food- I had the Spiced Sweet Potato Bisque, Pan Roasted Amish Chicken Breast, and Pumpkin Bread Pudding. Boyfriend- Caesar Salad, Scrambled Eggs, Tribeca Chocolate Cake.Now the bisque was yummy but had barely any of the sheep milk yogurt which was best part. The chicken breast was tough, black barley under cooked and will leave you hungrier than when you came in since it was inedible, and my bread pudding taste of canned pumpkin with soggy bread and the gelato taste of freezer burn. The caesar salad tasted bitter and the greens were changing colors-seriously??, eggs were nothing special, bacon not at all crispy, chocolate cake was stale and had that crusty edge ageing as if it was in the fridge for days. Only saving grace was the side order of fries I ordered as they were fresh cut, nice salt.I also have to add that my coffee cup and milk pourer both had cracks. Also going to the bathroom is a mission and doesn't feel very safe. You must go through two different exit doors, down two sets of stairs that gave me a firehouse vibe with the coloring and all the photos  on the walls and then finally down a barely lit hall to a ladies room that has dim lighting, I have never peed so fast in my life lol.All in all I wouldn't visit Tribeca Grill again and do not recommend. If it wasn't restaurant week, I'd be super pissed  if I spent their regular menu pricing. Our bill was about $80-$85 dollars with tip and NOT worth it.

My friend and I both ordered the $25 3 course lunch. The Caesar salad was good. It was a little over seasoned in my taste, the dressing was a little too strong but it wasn't overwhelmingly creamy. There was a bitter aftertaste that I found interesting but was sometimes too much. I ordered the salmon and my friend the chicken breast. The salmon was a perfect texture. The skin was seasoned really well, I wish the salmon had more of those flavored. The mushrooms and beans with the salmon were light and complimented the salmon great. The chicken breast was really tender. The squash(?) sauce was surprisingly sweet and really complimented the chicken. The rice was ok. The desert was probably the best part of the meat. I had the TriBeCa chocolate cake which was really rich and chocolate-y. Not overwhelmingly sweet. My friend had the coconut sorbet, which wasn't even part of the restaurant week menu but our waiter included it as part of that menu anyway (we didn't pay extra for the sorbet).

It was typical NYC spot with good atmosphere,  Good service,  nice bar and beer and wine options  (although not too many on beer). Now the food. We had a number of appetizers with the portion size being quite small. Presentation was ok but not extravagant.  The octopus was very chewey and i expected much better. Other appetizers ordered at table were as expected but nothing that wowed me. The main course had some great options like the duck and the lobster pasta. Both of those were extremely good.  Unfortunately i didnt order them and went with cod and risotto.  Cod was cooked well but flavor was uninspiring.  The risotto was terrible. At this point i forgot what they were going for but it only tasted like butter and if you tilted plate you could see how the oil juat pooled to one side.  I didn't bother eating it after one bite.The place had some nice offerings and good atmosphere and i would go back for a good meal.but if you are looking to be excited and wowed try something else",0,0,0,Nahuel Q.,"Tenafly, NJ",0,6,0

On the recommendation of the waitress we started with the soup of the day (creamy cauliflower with toasted pine nuts).  It did not disappoint.  It wasn't exactly the low calorie option but it was delicious.  For mains my wife ordered the eggs benedict and I ordered the burger with blue cheese.  The eggs benedict was delicious with perfectly charred ham.  The burger however was AMAZING!  Some restaurants can be a little skimpy when you get blue cheese.  Not the Tribeca Grill.  The burger came topped with a heaping portion of melty and delicious blue cheese.  The burger was perfectly cooked and juicy.  It did not disappoint.  This is a great neighborhood restaurant and we are looking forward to returning for dinner.,0,0,0,Justin S.,"Jersey City, NJ",20,44,17

It took over 5 minutes  to even get approached  with menus  after being seated .  Keep in mind  there were at least 10 wait staff in the restaurant at the time . The eggs benedict was fine however the chicken scallopini was ridiculous. There was one 3 ounce piece of chicken on the plate buried under the arugula salad, pretty crappy for $21. It took 10 minutes to be served and had to constantly bother The busboy to get a coffee refill which was cold and bitter to the taste. Would never go back again.

4.0,8/10/2015,"TG has been on my to-do list for a really long time. So I was happy to see that they offer a Restaurant Week brunch on the weekends, for $25/3 courses. Not a bad deal if you go for more the ""lunch"" (which I always do at brunch), versus overpriced egg dishes. My girlfriend made a ressie and we came here on a busy Sat at 1:30 with our fiances.  We were seated promptly even though only there were initially only two of us for a good 10-15 min, and because my friends were running behind, they kindly allowed us to order for them so the first courses came out when they arrived.   I had the:- chilled corn bisque which was so refreshing with nicely pickled enoki mushrooms - the Chicken scalloppini which was really awesome: very thinly pounded, well seared, seasoned and came with fresh arugala, corn, tomato and red quinoa. Yum. - The Italian panna cotta which was custardy but more tart/yogurt in taste over sweet, Vanilla-y panna cotta. This I wish was more traditional. My friends had about the same, except that one of them decided to do the :- Summer Lentil Salad (looked fresh and good but did not try)-The chilled poached salmon (very light, healthy looking) - almost Scandanavian-y-The Key Lime Cheesecake, which fiance had a bite and said it was delicious and sweet. My fiance did not go for restaurant week and instead just got the fine goat cheese omelete which was so light and fluffy and came with grilled potatoes. I will say, that the portions were very small. Even for the omelete, it was tiny for $15. But that being said, I'm actually dieting (trying to!) so I didn't mind too much but FYI. I would take them up on their RW deal. Service was incredibly prompt and polite, and were patient with pacing the meal as two of our friends arrived late.Probably inferior to Locanda Verde and/or Nobu... and it's in the same resto group, I believe.

The food wasn't over the top, it was a more simple menu with a twist here and there, but all our meals tasted great. My jalapeno lime corn bisque as an appetizer and thoroughly enjoyed it. Just the right amount of lime and spice to cut through the creamy bisque. My mom and I ordered the grilled chicken scallopini, my sister had the chilled salmon and my dad wanted the classic scrambled eggs and applewood smoked bacon. All plates were almost licked clean after that. We ended with great desserts also, all of us trying to get a taste of each one. Out of the key lime cheesecake, chocolate cake, and the panna cotta, the cheesecake definitely hit the spot.

Took at least another half hour before our cheese plate came out and minutes after came our main dishes. Maybe it was because it was end of night and the place was slowing down there was a general lack of attention, but still  no excuse for the lack of service.

The staff tried to accommodate us by moving us to a quieter table near an A/C vent, which helped somewhat.  We ordered cocktails - excellent at $12 a pop - and a green salad with blue cheese and shrimp tempura for starters.  Both appetizers were delicious and generously proportioned.  For entrees we had the grilled salmon with arugula and Tuscan beans, and the pan-seared scallops with carrot risotto.  The food was good, but at $35 the scallop entree should have come with more than three medium sized scallops. No excuses for that. The $10 S'mores dessert was disappointing except for the tablespoon (couldn't they have given more?) of pecan ice cream that came with it.

Both of us love food that is highly seasoned and flavorful- so for us to say something is too salty really requires A LOT of salt. We could not enjoy either of our meals as the flavor was drowned out by the overbearing amount of salt. Also, usually lamb shanks are super tender, but this one was dry.

3.0,3/13/2015,I went during restaurant week and really enjoyed the food.  I dined with two girlfriends and sat at the bar while waiting for my table.  The bar was a nice wrap around bar and made it easy to have conversations and hear yourself.  The set up for the trip to the bathroom is confusing as there was a meeting upstairs with a bunch of construction type guys attending and walking through the restaurant.  So it was just weird because the flow changed from dressy/casual to sporty/dressed down.  I got the impression this establishment was more formal/dressier than it actually is.  Not a deal breaker but just a data point.  The service was amazing!,0,0,0,Ms. D.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",2,14,1

My friends and I were probably the most casually dressed table there..loll I had a reservation for 6:30pm.. and we arrived and were seated right away. Our server, Nicole was cute and very knowledgeable about the menu and the extensive wine list. A note about the wine list.. It's more than a list.. more like an Encyclopedia! The book was like 5-6 pages long, with well over 100 wines.. It was very impressive! 2 of us ordered a glass of wine each, to accompany our meal.  We opted for the restaurant week menu. My friends and I all agreed on the Salmon Tartare app.. 2 of us got the pork chop and one got the Atlantic Salmon. And 2 of us ordered the Chocolate cake and one had the Creme Brulee. We didn't wait long for the food to come. Maybe 15-20 mins between each course. Salmon tartare  was very tasty! Tiny pieces of salmon, avocado and mango chopped together. Was very fresh and light. A perfect appetizer! The pork chop was AWESOME! Tender and juicy and very flavorful! And my dessert, the chocolate cake was okay. It was accompanied by house made whipped cream, and it wasn't too sweet, but I've definitely had better. Service was on point. Water glasses were refilled promptly.

Sadly I had to let him know that times had changed... and I wish someone would let the restaurant know! The menu was straight from the '90s, down to the little dinner roll we received at the start of lunch. Some of the highlights: Seared tuna with sesame noodles, proudly proclaimed as Ahi.  Turkey Club, Chopped Salad, etc...  Once edgy cuisine, it's now the highlight of the ""fancy"" restaurant in your hometown suburbia.  There's no way the certainly excellent cooks in this restaurant are challenging themselves or the diners. Of course, the service is great, as is the location, and the wine list had a wonderful page of reasonable picks. We had a delicious Rhone red.  All in all, the entire place seemed a little old... and the insanely difficult to get to bathroom filled with newspaper articles from twenty years ago encapsulated my experience perfectly.

I don't think a restaurant deserves 4 stars if the cook over cooks your meat - I don't care the excuse - there isn't an excuse for overcooked meat!  2. We ordered the burger with the fries.  I throughly enjoyed the fries - which is why I bumped up my review from 2.5 stars to 3. They were cut and seasoned well. 3. I see mixed reviews about customer service. My friend waited 6 minutes before his water glass was refilled.  Note: the restaurant did apologize for our overcooked meat and compensated us with cookies bc we were constricted with time - the cookies had nuts- my friend is allergic to nuts - he wasn't too happy ..   From what I've tasted and my experience this is honestly an overpriced restaurant in the Tribeca area.

We had an reservation for 6:30 and it was fine but we had the table closest to the front and although the restaurant was fairly empty at the time, they would not move us. Ok, I get that and it was really not an issue anyway. We had some wine and the sommelier was very helpful but did not seem experienced or knowledgeable. Still, the evening was going well until the food arrived. Both my business partner and I ordered the NY Strip steak medium, and the other was the filet. Now my steak was so tough it barely cut with the steak knife. Fortunately, there was a very tasty spinach side that made it at least go down. We were all starved so we just ate it, and since it was a business meeting, nobody said a word at the table. I found out later that the other steak was just as tough, and the filet was not enjoyable either. That was probably why he barely touched it. The place was nice, and the staff was friendly and courteous, but the food was not good at all. I doubt I will go back. We should have just went to Wolfgangs around the corner. Oh well.

The burger was served on an English muffin and came with a slide of fries. I got mine with a slice of cheddar, but my manager opted for the cheese & ale sauce. Overall, the burger was good - cooked as I requested and had a decent amount of flavor. I wasn't blown away by the burger and I didn't think the meat was seasoned exceptionally well. My manager on the other hand raved about the cheese sauce and he really enjoyed his burger. Verdict: Not a very memorable burger, but may go back and try something else.P.S.

4.0,3/2/2014,"I want to begin this review by giving our waiter, Carlos, 5 stars . . . and then some. He was perfectly attentive, but not overly so, and he did something I have never before experienced in a restaurant in New York (or anywhere else): when we were placing our orders, he asked after any food allergies. My boyfriend said that while it wasn't an allergy, he cannot eat cilantro. Carlos assured him that they don't use cilantro on anything. Then our appetizers arrived, and I offered a spoonful of my soup to my boyfriend. He was about to accept and then noticed suspicious green leaves sprinkled atop my soup. ""Is that cilantro?"" I ate a piece raw, and it was, so he declined the taste. Let me make clear that we said absolutely nothing to the waitstaff. A few moments later, Carlos appeared holding a small cupful of the same soup, sans cilantro garnish, for my boyfriend to try. Now THAT is outstanding service.Now, I should qualify this review by saying that I went for brunch during Restaurant Week, so we were treated to lower-than-usual prices. However, for my $25, I thought we received more than generous portions of everything, particularly for a brunch. I ordered the chickpea & tomato soup, salmon, and glazed pears with cake for dessert. The soup was tasty, although definitely nothing terribly out-of-the-ordinary; the salmon was very good as was the white bean side it came with; and the pears/cake were, again, fairly average.I'd probably pay the place another visit if it weren't so inconvenient for me to get to, especially because they have a maple syrup Hot Toddy on there that looks scrumptious! As it is, I'm unlikely to return. But the Grill certainly deserves a solid four-star rating not only for the food and service, but also because it can easily accommodate large parties (our party of 4 was probably one of the smallest there) and--in spite of having very high-class decor--is child-friendly (several other parties close to ours included children).",2,0,2,Allison G.,"Jersey City, NJ",20,25,0

I loved the way the kale was cooked. The dessert was 1/2 great.  It was a roasted pear with sorbet on a cake.  The pears and sorbet were amazing but the cake itself has a corn bread/almond taste that was very subtle.  The cake itself wasn't moist or fluffy.

4.0,2/24/2014,"I came here on Restaurant week so I was treated to a way cheaper price then the usual here. Needless to say it was a beautiful day out and my friend and I met up in Tribeca specifically to try this place out. Take advantage of the sale if you will. Tribeca is one of those neighborhoods that you either adore or despise. That day was phenomenal from the weather, to the amount of people out, to the way the sun hit the water it was just perfect. When we arrived we crept inside and were greeted pleasantly. They offered us seating in door and out and we opted for outside (Always out if it's available and nice enough). One thing I noted was how delightful the staff was even though we were just two hood chicks from Queens lol They don't discriminate. Most ritzy ditzy spots try to send you in the back to wash the dishes. They were so nice here.We were seated out side and blessed with nice glasses of water. Water in fancy glasses always taste better than water in plastic. Every spot should know that by now. For appetizer I had the sweet corn bisque. Ahhh.. corn...bisque...sweet. It was wonderful. As i began to sip I realized I had never really had like a corn soup situation but this was good stuff. I decided I would have to look in to creating something like this at home because it was perfectly sweet. I tossed some black pepper in the mix for a little kick and thoroughly enjoyed it. For my main dish I ordered the Herb Roasted Salmon. It was a delightful piece of salmon. Cooked perfectly. It had a nice flaky-ness and was still moist. The herbs on top were delicious as well. I also had the pennette in a pesto sauce. It was a nice size serving of pasta. Cute little penne noodles, all green and adorable. My favorite color. As much as I like pesto sometimes it can be overwhelming. Here it was done nicely. Not too over powering and still very flavorful. For dessert I ordered the blueberry cheese cake and I tried some of my friend's warm peach tart. Both desserts were delicious and if I had to return I don't  know which I would choose over the other. The warmth of the peach tart made it very satisfying and soothing. But the chill of the cheesecake and the tart from the blueberry was really good as well.All in all I really enjoyed my meal here and the whole atmosphere was nice. Would I come back outside of restaurant week? Hell  no! I don't have the funds for the regular prices here.. actually I do but I'm not willing to spend it lol.

5.0,2/22/2014,"This is a superb Restaurant Week option. I've often found Restaurant Week menus to be hit or miss with smaller portions, cheap desserts and unappealing entrees, but that's definitely not the case at Tribeca Grill. I had the beet salad, smoked ricotta ravioli and the raspberry cheesecake, and all three were absolutely delicious. (The cheesecake was actually more of a tart, with a hint of lemon--divine!) My husband had the short rib pierogi, the pork chop and the warm apple cake. I have to say the pork chop was the overall winner. Perfectly seasoned and prepared. Add to all that top-notch service and one of the best tempranillos I've ever had (from the Dave's Picks section of the wine list), and it made for a truly wonderful evening. We were actually a bit surprised because it was so easy to get a table--we showed up about 45 minutes before our 7:30 reservation time and had planned to sit at the bar, but we were immediately seated.

However, it was nothing I couldn't make at home.For my entrée, I had the Pan Roasted Hampshire Pork Chop with spiced sweet potato purée & kale, creole mustard sauce. At first glance, the chop seems huge but after chopping away the bone and the fat, there was a very miniscule amount of meat. The chop was a little too tough. The kale was undercooked. We ended with the Banana Tart with malted chocolate pecan ice cream. The ice cream was good, but the tart was just missing something. It was not sweet or caramelized enough.There was nothing special about the atmosphere. I didn't feel like I was experiencing a fabulous dinner, just sitting through it.",0,0,0,Michelle B.,"Huntington Station, NY",816,1320,3063

The ravioli were served in a cream sauce made entirely of white creamed corn.  No skins at all.  Looks just like any other cream sauce until you taste it - wonderful.We found their portions quite generous and an excellent value.  Considering the quality of the food, the polished service and the ambiance I'd say it was very reasonably priced.The restaurant is very nicely appointed and draws an upscale crowd.  Lots of windows for natural light, a number of tables outside.  Just a nice looking place.I would highly recommend the Tribecca Grill.",0,0,0,Jim K.,"Vineland, NJ",7,151,15

My friend kept complaining to us that as the waiters passed by they kept hitting him in the head with their elbows and so eventually he got so fed up that he stopped every waiter that tried to pass behind him and asked them to walk around another way.

Our main courses came out and I cut into my Filet Mignon (ordered medium) and it was cold but cooked appropriately.   This filet was not slightly warm, but cold as in chilled (50 degrees maybe).  I touched the steak and it was cold to touch as well.  I asked my friend's wife to try her steak as she ordered the exact same and her's was chilled as well.  We sent them back and literally 2 minutes later, new steaks were at our table.  These steaks were warmer but now very rare.  We ate them as we didn't want to be those people that moan.  The waiter was cordial enough.  The other 2 main course were good I was told (Scallops and Pasta I believe).The whole situation was weird.  I felt like the steaks were pre-cooked beforehand and put in refrigerator to be warmed and sent out to the customer at a later time.  I am not sure how the 2nd steaks were cooked so fast (even for rare).  The whole meal tasted like an average banquet/wedding plate which made me wonder.  There was some kind of banquet going on upstairs and I wondered if we got 2 extra steaks from that venue? Anyway it did not leave me very impressed at all....was going to give it one star but maybe it was just a really off night.",4,0,0,Patrick R.,"Ann Arbor, MI",5,20,2

4.0,9/21/2012,"I had a very nice dinner here with some coworkers while visiting NYC. First-the art in the restaurant was all painted by Robert De Niro, Sr. (the actors dad). It is some really neat looking stuff. Also, the menu backs were painted by him as well. They even gave me one to take home with me, which I quite appreciated.The ambiance is nice. While it has an open floor plan, it still feels private and intimate. I can definitely see having a nice date here. You get a nice view of the hustle and bustle outside in the Tribeca area, and that is pleasant to see and people watch. The food was very good. We had the Seared Tuna appetizer which was exquisite. For my main course, I had the House Special Duck Breast with couscous. It was amazing. I am not a big duck fan at all, but this duck had a tamarind glaze and was cooked to perfection. It tasted almost like a fine steak. I would highly recommend it. They had some other unique dishes like swordfish, and I tried some of that as well. It was very good, also. This isn't too pricey of a location by NY standards, either. Definitely give it a try!",2,0,0,Bryan W.,"Buford, GA",50,142,16
4.0,9/9/2012,"The food was unexpectedly really good! I had low expectations because the decor/ambiance was that of a trumped up Ruby Tuesday's--Bobby D what were you thinking when you deco'd this place?! The feel is basically that of a family restaurant and sports bar combined. There's outside seating and given good weather it could be awesome. The night I was there it was humid as hell so we sat inside. Air conditioning is a modern luxury that we should never take for granted. The hostesses were inept. I saw numerous empty tables set for two yet I and the mister waited about 30 minutes at the bar for a table until one was ""available"". Once seated service was relatively good.  Not amazing, but okay, you could tell server chick had a lot on her mind and taking our orders was interrupting her train of thought. Apologies. Once the food arrived all was forgiven. The cocktails were a little watered down (sad face). Please note when I say ""cocktails"", I'm talking about whiskey and ginger ale, so the weaknesses is not as permissible as would be if I was getting a ""girly drink"" (apple martini, cosmo, etc.). The bathroom is downstairs and it is there that you will see the glory of Bobby D.

We didn't expect to see Robert DeNiro or rub elbows with high profile  celebrity-types, but we did expect exceptional service, and this we received in spades. Five of us have been to the best of them and the worst of them in the past month, and Tribeca Grill was hands down the best. Where a lot of the high-end and unfortunately over-rated restaurants have failed is the fact that they skimped on service, quality, presentation and taste during restaurant week, however Tribeca Grill maintained their integrity and quality and excellent service:) i highly recommend the pork chops",0,0,0,Grace Lee A.,"New York, NY",42,311,54
1.0,8/27/2012,"Quick disclaimer: former New Yorker, not an ""unhappy tourist on a rant"".Had my birthday here 3 years ago - excellent time, great food, perfect service, no complaints. Been back a couple of times since, last time about two years back - again, very good. Oh, how the time flies.We were surprised being able to walk in with half an hour's notice, when a ""6-top just opened up"". On a Saturday night. In NYC. We should've known something was amiss. And so it began...The food - where do I start? As we browsed the menu, we found ourselves using deductive logic to narrow down our already limited choices. Our eyes drifting to the kids menu was certainly a clue, sadly one we chose to ignore.Process of elimination yielded pork chops, herb roasted chicken, swordfish, kids pasta, and a kids burger. Although not without flavor, the chops' toughness and unimaginative presentation left the side of mixed beans the best part of this dish. The swordfish preparation was likewise found wanting, with the ""sauce"" offering a thin, lemony cover for the skinny tilapia-like presence on a plate too small for the portion.Herb ""chicken"" presented a convincing argument against genetic engineering. A lab error is likely the best explanation for what showed up on this particular plate, as I refuse to believe an actual kitchen produced this glazed, dry, cold, rubbery mess. The overturned bowl of shredded paper pretending to be a side of mashed potatoes rounded out this entree.Not content with a single appearance, this dish made a second one - on our check, despite having been replaced with a plate of scallop-like items on a bed of risotto, delivered too fast to cook them thoroughly. No explanation or a single apology was offered.The kids pasta, admittedly an afterthought for most menus, was a hastily thrown together pile of boiled spaghetti, sans sauce, butter, flavor, salt, anything. Yes, it's an accommodation, we get it, but an easy opportunity to please your patrons - an opportunity missed this time.The kids burger was clearly in the running for the redeeming dish of the evening, until the missing bacon, despite two requests to the server, sabotaged its chances.I was disappointed, and I don't say that lightly. The service was sub-par. All the whispered pleasantries and reverent waist bows by the servers failed to mask a simple yet stark truth - the place has gone downhill.Just a couple of years ago, you had to fight your way up to the bar for a drink here. Nowadays, it's become a name-dropping tourist trap trading on its past glory to ensnare unsuspecting out-of-towners.Stay away and tell your friends. I know I will.",1,0,0,Sensei D.,"Washington, DC",0,15,0

The restaurant has windows on the west side of the main dining room which allows the afternoon sun to fill the space. Decor is modern and classy.... not stuffy. Service was exceptional all-round.   I ordered a wonderful dinner from their Grand Prix menu... the presentation of the appetizer and main course were first-rate. I ordered a glazed chicken and was blown away with the unique flavors. Creme Brulee for dessert was some of the best I've tasted.  Hallway to the bathroom downstairs has some unique memorabilia featuring co-owner Robert Deniro.In New York City you never have to eat at the same restaurant twice....

2.0,8/24/2012,"Oh Robert de Niro. I expected more from you. I guess when you have such a prolific acting career, you can't really devote as much time to a restaurant. Sigh.My sister, her manfriend, and I went her for brunch on one of those perfect New York summer Sundays. Sadly, our brunch was less than perfect. The place (very neatly decorated, I'll give it that) was fairly deserted, but it took FOREVER for our waiter to drop by our table. When he brought our drinks, he spilled probably an ounce of my sister's on the table and didn't offer to make her another one. I mean, that's probably about $3 of the $14 cocktail! They were good though--I had a twist on the Pimm's cup with cucumber and orange, Sister had a sort of fruity martini, and Manfriend had a mimosa made with gin. My chorizo eggs benedict had a perfectly poached egg and a divine hollandaise, but there was twice as much English muffin as there was egg or sausage. Sister's banana french toast had three slices of banana over four large pieces of bread. And Manfriend's biscuits and gravy consisted of two teeny biscuits, probably three inches in diameter.Sorry, Bobby.

It was pretty good, better than some salads with just cheese in it.  The salad didn't feel overwhelmingly oily.The duck was really good.  I actually enjoyed it.  Just take the skin off because it was a little charred.  Luckily, it didn't ruin the taste of the overall dish.  Overall flavor of the dish is an earthy one.  Even though the menu doesn't mention mushrooms in the dish, it certainly tasted like there was.  I would recommend this dish.The salted caramel crisp. Is really sweet. I could only eat half and I was satisfied. There was another dessert option, banana tart. Visually, the tart looked much better but unfortunately, I did not get a chance to taste it.

Thi swas was outstanding- the mousse was very creamy and went well with the toasted crusty bread and the speck chewy smoked meat goodness. For the main course had the Spice Rubbed Lamb Loin which included Quinoa, Garden Vegetables & Sunchokes, Romesco Sauce.

The smiling host quickly led us to a booth at the back of the restaurant (behind the bar area for those familiar with the place.) Shortly after we were seated we were offered bread, water & menus. I quietly appreciated the efficiency of the quite efficient wait staff. I agree with Remy R.'s opinion regarding the staff (her review 4/23/11). My son made up his mind rapidly & selected the Pan Roasted Atlantic Salmon with Caramelized Beet & Apple Chutney set in Sunchoke Purée ($27). The beets were a mix of purple & golden but I wouldn't describe them as a ""chutney"". Roasted & carmelized is more accurate. I decided on the Soup of the Day (a small square bowl for $12) which was a silky smooth cream of parsnip with a few pieces of crab at the bottom. I enjoyed it quite a bit. I also ordered a Butter Lettuce SaladPancetta, Tomato Confit & Maytag Blue Cheese Dressing  ($12). The salad was tasty but REALLY needed something sweet to offset the tartness & sourness of the dressing & tomato confit...chunks of pear, roasted pecan pieces with brown sugar, or even dried cranberries would have added the sweet to the bite of blue cheese & (I believe) sundried tomato confit.

But the menu... mouth-watering offerings such as short ribs, foie gras ravioli (truly decadent), and seared scallops with chanterelle and corn risotto... amazing. SO much more than steak, and they really don't bill themselves as a steak house - apparently it just gained that word-of-mouth reputation over time. Fortunately, I was dining with a few other people, so we all ordered different meals in order to taste all of the best-looking items. I can't recommend the foie gras ravioli enough; the risotto was also to die for.

I debated between 2 & 3 Stars and decided the current yelp rating is misleading and needed to be reduced. First off they had no beer on tap. A place like this should at least have one beer on tap. It has a large welcoming bar. I can understanding not having a laundry list of draft beers but one or two will stay fresh. This was a negative.Second this place feels like a flash back to the mid 1990's. It feels worn and seems like it hasn't been updated since 1995.I started off with the Braised Short Rib Pierogi which was fine but nothing special. It was overwhelming beefy. The sauce even though it was horseradish wasn't noticeable.We had the Seared Sea Scallop and the Herd Pappardelle. Both were all salt.

Not only were we seated right away, but when we let our server know that we were in a bit of a rush, she was more than accommodating to make sure our food come out promptly. I ordered the Moroccan Spiced Day Boat Cod that was served with an eggplant puree and couscous. DELISH. The portion size was perfect, and the flavors all complimented each other. My friend ordered the Red Snapper and just from the small bite I tried, it was also delicious. The rest of the menu looked amazing, I'd love to go back and try the sweet potato gnocchi. I really can't praise our server enough because she was able to get our food to us and the check in plenty of time for us to be out the door for the film we were catching, and she was so nice about it! I did find it funny that a few couples my friend and I saw waiting at the bar at Locanda Verde, when we were waiting, were now at the bar / getting seated here at Tribeca Grill. I will definitely come back and recommend this place to my friends. I knew the place was getting at least 4 stars before my wine was served to me!",2,0,0,Remy R.,"Niagara Falls, NY",24,46,0

5.0,4/19/2011,Really good. Came here for restaurant week. I had the butternut squash soup and the gnoucci and my friend had the salad with the blue cheese and the trout. For dessert I had the panna cotta and he had the chocolate bread pudding. Everything was fab. Flavorful without too much salt. The soup had a lot of apple flavor so it wasn't like just eating a bowl of cream. The gnocci were firm and tasty. The trout was fresh and flaky.

5.0,4/19/2011,"This is my favorite restaurant in Manhattan for many many reasons. I have been here a ton of times, most recently on Saturday evening. I am going to randomly bullet point my reasons for loving this place:- the atmosphere- the dress code is not strict I have both dressed up and down coming here and no one ever bats an eye. - the wait staff are super - the food is super- the prices are very reasonable- the wine is divineThe food is always really good, reasonably priced. I've had Beet Salad, Short Rib Periogi, Red Snapper,Seared Tuna, Scallops, Filet of Beef, Roasted Duck Breast, the desserts are amazing too. I am a red wine drinker and the selection of glasses is impressive and I tend to opt for the Merlot or the Pinot Noir, both excellent. The wine list is impressive and there is a sommelier floating around at all times too.The bar is casual and makes a mean pre-dinner cocktaill, if you are that way inclined, which I am :)I have many good memories of this restaurant, and have taken many people here in the past few years, all impressed.

Our waiter was good, we got our drinks right away, that was good. There was a really long period of time between that and when we got to order our food. But the food came quickly. I had the sweet potato gnocchi, which was just good. It wasn't mind blowing, it wasn't even like wow.

4.0,2/24/2011,"Thanks to a Twitter contest run by Continental Airlines, I won a $150 gift certificate to Tribeca Grill, a part of Robert DeNiro's Myriad Restaurant Group that also includes Locanda Verde (where I was taken for my birthday dinner), Nobu (still on my list) and Corton. With Valentine's falling on a Monday, Mike and I decided to change things around a bit and made a reservation for Sunday night, allowing us to take our time and get more bang out of our gift certificate buck (the actual Valentine's Night prix-fixe was almost double what we ended up paying for our meal).Since this was an evening for Mike and I to just enjoy, I didn't take any pictures, but I did want to write a little something to express how happy I was with this meal. The first thing I'll say is that the prices are VERY reasonable starting with the wine list through appetizers, entrees and desserts. The decor is laid back but warm and inviting. The restaurant operates on more of a casual and not-stuffy environment, which is refreshing when you compare it to similar Manhattan restaurants. We saw people in jeans and children coloring, but still felt right at home dressed up for a nicer meal. After flipping through a novel of a wine list (Tribeca Grill is known for their amazing wine list featuring the largest selection of Zinfandels in NYC and the largest Châteauneuf du Pape selection in the world), I decided we were celebrating and should order Champagne. Of course I could have picked a $1200 bottle, but I thought that would be a bit much. We settled on a bottle of Crémant de Limoux, Domaine Laurens, Brut n.v. ($40) and it was delicious! I love the way Champagne bubbles settle and pop on my tongue.For appetizers, I ordered the Duck Confit Salad with Lola Rosa, Sundried Cherries & Honey Yogurt Vinaigrette ($12). This could have been a meal in itself. The duck was still on the bone, but was so juicy and tender. The salad contained the perfect amount of greens for a starter, and while the cranberries lent an excellent amount of tartness, the light dressing really finished it all off well. Mike had the Sautéed Jumbo Lump Crabcake with Cauliflower, Raisin & Tomato Chutney ($19), and it was the most amazing crab cake I've tried in a long time. I kept sneaking bites. The chutney underneath was tasty as well, and while Mike didn't care too much for the cauliflower, I had no problems finishing up the last bits, which tasted lightly of curry.Onto entrees, I had a very hard time deciding. Finally trying to get in my Omega-3s, I settled on the Roasted Red Snapper with Chanterelle, Bacon & Swiss Chard Risotto ($29). To be honest though, it was probably the word ""risotto"" that sold me, and maybe the word ""bacon."" This turned out to be a brilliant dish. One would think that fish and rice would just be mush and mush, but between the super crispy skin of the fish and the crackle-in-your-mouth bits of bacon, it contained a great textural mix. The giant mushrooms were a lot of fun and I still got some fiber out of the swiss chard. It was also a huge dish, and I ended up taking about half of it home for lunch the next day. Mike ordered the Grilled Filet of Beef with Garlic Whipped Potatoes, Sautéed Spinach & Crispy Onion Rings ($35), and I think it was the perfect dish for him. The meat was super tender and was complemented nicely with the crispy onion rings. When they say garlic whipped potatoes, they really mean garlic, and some of that rubs off into the spinach, but we are both huge garlic lovers, so this was great. Just about everything on the dessert menu looked delicious, but since it was Valentine's Day and we're (well at least I am) corny, we had to pick something with some chocolate, so we picked the Banana Tart with Malted Milk Chocolate Pecan Ice Cream ($9). Also, throw in the fact that we're dorks and wanted the bill to come out to exactly $150, we ordered up a hot chocolate ($5) as well. The hot chocolate was creamy and came with two biscotti cookies for us to dip and share. The banana tart was different from most desserts I've had as they weren't afraid to go for it with the bananas. I love bananas so I was totally great with this, but if you're not a banana fan, this isn't the dessert for you. It was decadent without being overly sweet and the ice cream with the malted flavor was a nice touch.I would highly recommend Tribeca Grill for both special occasion dinners and for a regular night out. I hear they also serve an excellent brunch that is meant just as much for locals as it is for the guests staying in the Greenwich Hotel above.",3,1,1,Yael M.,"Norwalk, CT",145,152,0

3.0,2/9/2011,"As my first stop for restaurant week, I was very satisfied with the quality of service and choice of prix fixe. I ordered the butternut squash and honey crisp apple soup with molasses creme fresh which was very creamy and sweet with a taste of apple sauce. the main was the pork shank. The quantity of pork was small but considering its restaurant week, I wasn't expecting a whole lot. It was soft and well cooked. I ended with the vanilla panna cotta. Very tasty with the black mission fig coulis on the side. I had a glass of white and red wine which went well with the overall dish. My gf had the venison and juniper berry sausage with braised red cabbage. The sausage was very lean and the cabbage was, well, braised. For the main, she had the pan-roasted brook trout with saffron couscous, eggplant purée and picholine olive tapenade. The trout was cooked properly, very soft and did not have any fishy taste. Dessert was the chocolate bread pudding with salted caramel ice cream. The bread pudding was very chocolatey and felt like a chewy chocolate fondant. As for a drink, she had the Ginger blossom, which contained tanquaray, elderflower, Ginger. A bit strong for the people not used to strong alcohol but you can definitely taste the Ginger which makes it taste good. Service was very good. The waitress was always on top with things and constantly made sure the wine glass or water was not empty. The food came timely and there were no mistakes. Overall, for service during restaurant week, it was a very pleasant dinner.

3.0,2/3/2011,"A group of us came here for Restaurant Week and honestly, I wasn't impressed. I definitely didn't go with much expectation. The decor wasn't extraordinary, if it weren't for the high ceilings, I wouldn't have enjoyed it much at all. Between the five of us, we had butternut squash & apple soup and chopped sausages on diced beet for appetizer, pork shank and trout on a bed of couscous for entree, and warm chocolate cake and apple tart for dessert. The butternut squash and apple soup was comparable to the squash soup I had last week at One if by land, two if by sea and in fact, I think the apple added more zest and character to the dish. Pork shank was definitely on the dry side - marinated well but didn't really bring out the flavor... My trout was excellent but can be a bit salty to some people. Warm chocolate cake was delicious and my other friends raved over the apple tart. I also got a glass of pinot noir because I just wasn't too excited about the food... Anyways, all in all, not a very exciting establishment but a good place to meet up with friends (noise level was perfect). The other plus - service. Excellent excellent service.

3.0,2/1/2011,"Picked this place for my birthday during restaurant week hoping to be wowed. Wasn't.Maybe I started out on a bad foot with our elderly waiter who was not amused when I asked if I could get a pitcher of their ""Merry Christmas for the Family."" Clearly, he was not about my party of 7 having a merry Christmas because he gave me a pretty pointed look. Good thing I already had a few shots in me, so I let that one slide. However, I think he deliberately tried to avoid me the rest of the night.That aside, food was good. A couple of my friends raved about the sweet potato gnocchi. The trout and I got along swimmingly. I was a big admirer of his crispy skin, but nothing else about him was too memorable. Didn't hear much from team pork shank, but I think they enjoyed it enough. My apple tart was very good and the bread pudding had a solid following as well. The real star of the show (aside from me, of course) was the salted caramel ice cream. I had a friend who was adamant about asking for a tub of it, but I had already learned my lesson with the pitcher.I do appreciate that they didn't rush us at the end of dinner, despite our going past the 9pm cut off for the next party, but this was mostly b/c they were slow on getting our check.In the end, I think Waiter Grinch warmed up to us because he offered to take a group picture for us (I think my million dollar smile--aka beyond-buzzed beam--finally won him over.). Not the pitcher I was looking for, but I forgive him b/c he might have been hard of hearing? I kid. He was a good sport for, for the most part, putting up with my drunken foolishness.

3.0,1/28/2011,"Drew and his Myriad Restaurant Group really let us down on this one. As great a guy as he is, the food was as expected, unamusing. The 2011 Winter Resty Week $35 Dinner Menu offerings were somewhat redundant and the desserts overshadowed the apps which overshadowed the mains. Our friend ordered the squash app and sweet potato main since he's vegetarian, but why have 2 similar vegetables highlighted back to back? Fail there. Still packed, but we think its best years are behind it. Once deemed the place to see and be seen, this venue is no longer that. Not an EPIC fail, but we left unamused and walked over to Locanda Verde for a second helping of dessert.2011 RESTAURANT WEEK - DINNER MENU Ordered:-Venison & Juniper Berry Sausage - w/ braised red cabbage, safe but inviting starter, a good start-Braised Pork Shank - w/ black eyed peas, andouille sausage & mustard greens - my protein was tougher than expected and served on top of what tasted like a mascerated cherry mixture and beans, even that outshined the lackluster pork-Roasted Apple Tart - w/ brown butter ice cream & walnut streusel, the brown butter ice cream was the star here, but the tart was pleasantly flaky and buttery, as expected. Also tried:-Warm Chocolate Bread Pudding - w/ salted caramel Ice cream - def better than the typical one you get @ JG restaurants, but not mind-blowing, medium density cake, solid ice cream.Indifference would be the word used to describe this once bustling and still somewhat busy restaurant. Attention to detail is still there, as the host graciously guided us to another two top after noticing our initial wobbly table. The desserts saved them from losing another star. We like Aaron Sanchez (Centrico) and all, but we fear the caliber of food at Myriad's sister restaurants are downhill as well, as this set the pace for me to question the veracity of their food. After all, Nobu didn't wow us either. Put it this way, we would never bring this place up in conversation or recommend it to a friend. An enemy, maybe.

I like to go to a restaurant and leave craving something that I ate. That's when I know, I'll be going back.

Indeed, very helpful and insightful. I ordered a Maytag blue cheese and endive salad and since I was carb depleted, a side of french fries. My friend had the crabcakes and a side of mash potatoes. The salad was fresh and flavorful. The fries, very ordinary. The mash potatoes bland and flat.The highlight of the evening was an assortment of cookies. Now I know what you are thinking.

A side of whipped potatoes helped make this first course more substantial. For the main, my halibut with lobster/shrimp ravolini was awesome. Easily Top 5 entrees I've had all year. Dessert was the chocolate caramel panna cotta & 'peanutella' sandwich. So good. The atmosphere seemed classy but not pretentious. The dress ranged from power suits to jeans and tees at the bar.

I had no idea that this was Robert DeNiro's restaurant until you see his movie posters and face plastered near the bathroom. while this restaurant is considered upscale, I felt like a lot of people from the neighborhood probably go there and everyone knows your name. I actually ran into an old friend from college here and same with others from my table. Our service was really great and everyone was really friendly, especially the waiters given that we were asking them all these questions. I ordered the octupus salad to start, which I wasn't really sure to expect, but it ended up being warm grilled octupus with celery and other veggies served with some sort of vinagrette. For my entry, I ordered the duck breast that was cook medium rare as the chef recommended. I don't know if I've ever gone to a restaurant where they ask me how I want my duck cooked, but the recommendation was great. It was a served with asparagus and some sort of carrot puree. Lastly, I ordered the cheesecake for dessert. Luckily, we all coordinated and one of us ordered the creme brulee, one ordered the chocolate cake, and I ordered the cheesecake and we could play dessert roulette with our desserts and let everyone try each other's desserts. I had a really good time at Tribeca Grill and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a nice place to eat.

5.0,7/31/2010,"Julie/JuliaIt's Restaurant Week ""RW"" and I'm behind on my dining since I've been traveling.  Today is sat night and no RW menu around right???  not true.  There are a number of places and Tribeca Grill is one of them.  Didn't want to come here at first since I already done this in the past but ohhhh I'm so glad we did....FOR Me this place is a true restaurant experience from the moment you step in the door.  The greeting is always warm.  Whether you are seated right away or wait at the bar in the center of the restaurant, you feel like the staff is taking care of you.The RW menu is always a selection of something from their main menu and has 3 apps, 3 entrees, and 3 desserts to chose from.  They never short change you for RW and the portions are pretty large even for a big dude.  You will leave this place full...Surprisingly, I ended up with the chefs special instead of doing the prix fixe.  It sounded so lovely when described and I really really wanted a mini iceberg salad to start and that wasn't on the RW menu.5 big stars to the iceberg lettuce.  They call it a mini wedge because they cut it up into smaller pieces and mix it with bacon and roasted tomatoes in a blue cheese dressing.  Put it all together and this was ""LEGENDARY"".  Best one that I've ever had...Entree was a red snapper which like i said was the special of the day.  Excellent flavor in a red oil based sauce that I can't describe.  Made with cherry tomatoes, potatoes and delicious olive's.  The entree was oh soooo satisfying.... The gf had the RW menu special and started with an octopus salad  app.  Great flavor and large portion made it an outstanding start.  Her entree was a roasted duck.  It was made rare and we sent it back to be cooked a bit longer.  They re-plated it and the entree looked sooo much better and tasted better as well.  Done with bok choy and mushrooms as sides.Finished with coffee and the dessert from RW menu which was cheese cake.  Very unique as it was a long rectangular cheese on top of a graham cracker with berry like filling on top.  Delicious.  a small scoop of vanilla gelato accompanied the dessert.The wait staff is so attentive that I never have to wait to ask for something.  They work as a team as i am being served and assisted by 2 main waiters.  There's a dedicated bread man and servers are quick and efficient.  The team works in unison to satisfy the diners and I was thoroughly pleased.What a great meal and fantastic experience.  The 5 stars is not for the food because I've had better.  It was for the experience from end to end.  The fact that I know as I walk in the door that I will enjoy myself and be able to feast on excellent creations from the kitchen and that the sole purpose of everyone working there is to satisfy me is enough to give this place an upgrade from my earlier rating of 4 stars to 5 stars.....",2,0,1,JulieJuli A.,"New York, NY",151,210,52

3.0,7/13/2010,"Restaurant Week Dinner: I am generally more forgiving for restaurant week... Have been here before for Restaurant week lunch and decided to return for dinner. They have a well-balanced sampling of the menu for restaurant week and I appreciate that. The restaurant is spacious and feels more like a small city spot than NYC. Our server was great, brought two samples of wine over for me to choose from and her recommendations were spot-on. As for the menu choices: The Heirloom tomato salad uses the term loosely, as the tomatoes were more garden-variety cherry and roma tomatoes. The fennel salad is a better choice. Goat cheese ravioli is generous in portion, but the cheese can be a little overpowering. The salmon, though it was supposed to be served with Sunchokes, was lacking, and I neglected to ask about them, but would advise that diners confirm they are available. The salmon itself was a little overcooked on the outside and near raw to the inside, more like a ""black and blue"" rather than medium rare, but again, it's restaurant week, so I forgive. Dessert was great, had the truffle chocolate cheesecake, would have also liked to try the Financier. Despite a few pitfalls, mostly due to gaffes in the marketing rather than the food, and taking into account the restaurant week pricing, we did have a lovely evening.

While food was solid, I just didn't really agree with all of it.  My octopus salad had excellent fresh ingredients, but I thought the celery leaves it was paired with was an off choice.  The red snapper, while on top of a perfect orzo/vegetable pilaf, seemed too salty and over-crisped.  I had this yogurt sorbet with maraschino cherries on some kind of cake for dessert and thought the sorbet just seemed like an off pairing as well -- so see what I mean? I think the chef is better off sticking to classics if he or she can't seem to create the wow factor in the mouth, which is what appears to be the effort here.

The spiced chestnut soup app with braised oxtail was creamy and sweet without being overpowering or ruining my appetite. My roommate had the braised octopus salad, which had a light and refreshing flavor, though the octopus was a little tougher than I would have liked.I really enjoyed the pan roasted brook trout, especially when accented by the sauce and crab & potato puree. I know a previous reviewer didn't find the sauce so appetizing, but I found it pretty pleasing. I did, however, find the bed of greens to be a bit much. In smaller bites with the fish it was fine, but at the end of the meal the spinach was an unappetizing glob left on my plate. My roommate's venison was wonderful, tender and well-cooked, and offered a nice kick by the lingonberry sauce. The desserts were pleasant, though not earth-shattering. The pineapple upside-down cake was light and fluffy, and the chocolate hazelnut mousse cake was fairly rich and had a nice balance between hazelnut and chocolate, as I've found some desserts go a little too heavy on the hazelnut.The service was attentive and polite - the waiter was extremely helpful when we were trying to decide what bottle of wine to go with, even though he wasn't the sommelier. The only complaint I have is that the establishment is really quite noisy - the ceilings are pretty high and the walls are brick, so there isn't really anything to absorb the sound.

2.0,2/3/2010,"Unfortunately, I was not impressed by the prix fixe options for restaurant week. For an appetizer I chose the beet salad because everything else looked strange: octopus salad, spiced chestnut soup, or lamb sausage. Maybe I'm not cultured enough but I would have preferred a green salad to start. Similar to other reviewers who tried the braised short ribs, I found it to be too buttery and mushy. Part way through eating it I realized I didn't need to use my knife to cut through it. Ribs are, of course, a fattier and more tender cut than others. It supposedly comes with ""Brussels Sprouts, Chanterelles & Pancetta"" but I could barely recognize them because they were chopped so small and saturated with oil.The Myriad Restaurants are known for their excellent wine selection--but I wish that for us budget restaurant week folk there had been cheaper by-the-glass options (lowest red was a $9 Merlot).",1,0,0,Courtney A.,"Boston, MA",5,29,0

I thought that I was going to be amazed by the food and will always want to come back. The food wasn't as good as I was expecting. It was restaurant week so I got lamb sausage with cheek peas as an appetizer, salmon as the main course, and pineapple desert. The lamb sausage with chick peas was unoriginal. I can go to the nearest supermarket and purchase some sausage, cut it into two, and serve it with chickpeas and spaghetti sauce. My main course was salmon with several peas. I didn't know that they were going to cook the external and keep the inner raw. I would have asked the cook to make it well done. I think it brings out the flavor. I didn't mind the soft texture I felt from half raw half cooked salmon. It would have been nice if the waiter has asked what style I would like the salmon. The pineapple desert was good.For 30 dollars, I wasn't full yet I wasn't hungry. I might have been just right. The decor is amazing but I would expect more from a restaurant that is partnered by Robert Deniro. My waiter was very kind, although I was shocked when he asked me if I wanted tap water. I was wondering if that was reverse psychology in which he was trying to make me buy wine because tap water isn't good enough at this restaurant.

You don't check to see the exact time you were seated so you can yelplain (yelp + complain = yelplain) about it the next day?). The wait wasn't altogether too bad considering I got to eavesdrop on the most excellent conversation by the man sitting next to me at the bar. I would elaborate on this conversation, but I'd feel (sort of) bad. Also, this review isn't about that. What this review IS about is what I liked about Tribeca Grill. First off, it's DeNiro's restaurant. There's something totally legit about that. Like when a friend asks, ""hey, where's your dinner tonight?"" you can casually reply ""oh, just going to DeNiro's restaurant down in TriBeCa...no big deal"" and look away, all blase but really feeling super cool on the inside cause COME ON, we all know that it is a BIG DEAL. But I digress...The restaurant itself is warm and open. There's a lighting thing that they have going there that makes you feel at home/in a mobster movie/really posh. I liked that. As for the food, I had: the Roasted Baby Beet Salad which was OK, the Black Truffle Cavatelli w/Wild Mushroom Ragoût which was really good, and the Chocolate Hazelnut Mousse Cake which was amazing. Pretty good build up. The service was prompt (after we sat down to eat, anyway). My only major comment was that the bathrooms were located somewhere downstairs...to get there you had to go through an unmarked door and down two flights of shady looking stairs. Although, that may or may not have added to the overall experience in a positive light, I'm thinking that after a few glasses of wine it might be just downright confusing.Bottom line: Come here with a colleague.

(It was mentioned on a Gossip Girl episode I saw recently, so it was in the forefront of my mind when I was reading down the list of participating restaurants.) The Grilled Lamb Sausage appetizer was very good. The meat wasn't spicy or burned, as I feared, but rather downplayed, mild. The bed of chick peas was also a nice touch. Sadly, the rest of the meal didn't quite match the high bar set in the beginning.I was initially excited about the Red Wine Braised Short Rib entrée because, as soon as I dug into it with my fork, the mass of meat fell apart. (YES! Pulled beef! ... Don't give me that look, it's the little things in life... ) But it turned out to be over-buttered and overdone. The bovine was essentially stripped of its taste. Bleh.Last, came the New York Style Cheesecake. It was fine. (I've had better. But I've had far worse, too.) The solid, rather than creamy, texture was to my liking.

I actually went off the RW menu and got the beet salad and scallops sans bacon (I only eat seafood - pesco vegetarian?), the beet salad was very refreshing, and not overdressed.

3.0,1/11/2009,"Tribeca Grill probably worked better in 1990.  Now, the weird lighting fixtures and post-industrial setting are about as outré as the set of Friends.  I wouldn't lead with a critique of the decor, but it's notable (in my mind) given the asinine reservation policy.  Apparently because the restaurant suffers unduly from the maddening crowds, parties of 5 or more must display their commitment in making a reservation by leaving a credit card for deposit.  That policy is fine at places that need the space.  But when you're at 20% capacity on a Sunday night, it's de trop.Otherwise, the food is strong, though wholly by the pricey book.  A rare tuna appetizer was promising, though review of the plate revealed about a dime bag of tuna amidst a vast pillow of noodles and pickled goods.  The duck entree was, however, very good (at $29).  Red meat ($33-$39) seemed to be prepared better.Desserts were fine, and a rye Manhattan was made accurately and well.  The staff was appropriately behaved though our waiter belied TB's practiced cool with the nervousness of inexperience.  He was good, though.I'd go if TB were in New Haven or Scranton.  But it's no longer such a draw in New York.",2,0,2,John B.,"Brooklyn, NY",93,526,0

4.0,12/16/2008,"I read past reviews before coming here and I was not expecting much but HELLO! The food was SO good!Just one negative point, the location of this place is  so inconvenient.  It's very deep into Tribeca and took me and my coworkers quite a long time to get there in a cab from Midtown East at 6pm.  I suggest going here only if you live or expect to stay in the area a while. I started with the Crispy Sweetbread, Lomo & Forest Mushroom Salad. It was the first time trying sweetbread for me and I thought it was really good. It had a soft smooth texture to it and the crispy surrounding helped make the sweetbread taste very savory.  The salad overall was really good since the roasted pumpkin, figs and balsamic added a sweet tone to the dish to balance out the more earthy tastes of the sweetbread and mushrooms.I tried the Coconut Rock Shrimp Tempura. Which was pretty good for the type of appetizer. In general, I'm not a fan of fried battered shrimp since I find it too greasy and heavy on the stomach but this had some pretty strong flavors that made up for the slight oiliness.I also tried the Sautéed Jumbo Lump Crabcake. This was amazing. The crab pieces were big and flavorful and there was no strong fishy smell/taste. For the main dish I had the Red Wine Braised Short Ribs with Whipped Parsnip Purée, Brussels Sprouts & Applewood Smoked Bacon.  The meat was so tender and juicy and the sauce was slightly sweet, really really good!  The brussels sprouts were perfectly cooked and not over powered by the bacon.I took a few bites of the Seared Sea Scallops with Chanterelle & Corn Risotto, Black Truffle Madeira Vinaigrette and found the scallops a little salty but the  risotto was top knotch. I love corn in my risotto especially if it's fresh corn and it sure was since it had a slight crunch when you bit into them.All in all a VERY satisfying meal. Not sure if I would go again because of the distance but I don't think you'd have to twist my arm to change my mind.",1,0,1,Angela I.,"New York, NY",46,52,0
4.0,12/13/2008,"The Tribeca Grill has been on my list of restaurants-to-try for a long time, and I finally made it this past week. While I was hoping to get a glimpse of Robert DeNiro in person (which didn't happen), I did have a lovely dinner. The high ceilings, not unusual for the Tribeca and SoHo neighborhoods, really create a nice atmosphere at the restaurant. They allow for beautiful and interesting lighting fixtures, and given that it was December, a nice display of holiday decorations, too. Each table has a number of servers, each doing one specific function from taking orders to serving bread to placing silverware. Be sure to pay attention to who your actual waiter is, just in case you need anything; it will save you time if you're looking to catch the right persons' eye. The food is very unique and delicious. For an appetizer I ordered the Coconut Rock Shrimp, which was really amazing, and quite a large serving. I was specifically impressed with the size of all the appetizers that were ordered at the table. I heard the Crabcakes and the Sweetbreads were also very good, though I didn't personally try them. For my entree I had the New York Strip Steak, though I wish I'd ordered the Filet Mignon...I somehow missed that on the large menu. And I also shared an entree order of the Seared Sea Scallops over a bed of Risotto, which was the BEST dish of the night. The sea scallops were very salty, which I liked, and of perfect consistency. But the risotto was what really blew us all away...it was incredibly tasty, made to perfection with truffle oil. The one major downside to the restaurant is the location of the restrooms, which are hidden away in the basement of the adjoining hotel, through two cryptically-marked doors and down a flight of stairs that look like they belong in a firehouse. After a few glasses of wine, the long journey to the restrooms is not very fun. Overall, my experience at the Tribeca Grill was fantastic, made only better by the company with whom I dined.",4,2,2,Krista J.,"Brooklyn, NY",749,1181,35

4.0,11/12/2007,"YAY!  A semi-nice restaurant in New York that I actually like!  I have had a bad run with purportedly ""wonderful"" and expensive places in NYC, so when my mom and her boyfriend got a recc for Tribeca Grill from the concierge at their hotel, I figured I was in for another pretentious-presentation-high-priced-tastes-like-ass meal, but hey, I wasn't paying, so who cares?  I was so wrong.  We got in right away on a Friday night around 7:30, with no reservation (thank you, sucky weather) and had a really nice meal all around.  The wine was good (selections for by the glass were slim, but tasty), my tortellini was pretty delicious, the lamb my mom had was good, and her boyfriend's venison was good as well.  The service was attentive and the decor was flattering.  I really liked this place and plan to keep it in my eating rotation.  Prices were not cheap, but they weren't astronomical either.Oh, and we walked in soaking wet from the rain and in jeans and no one even cared.  It reminded me of Austin (where I'm from), where the big question is not what you're wearing or how you look, but can you pay for your dinner?  I miss that.",3,0,2,Sarah P.,"New York, NY",10,38,0

At that time, I would have given it four stars.I returned to TG earlier this week for a friend's birthday. It was my suggestion, after that memorable meal boyfriend and I experienced. Somehow it didn't live up to what I remember it being. I ordered the short ribs this time. They were very good, but not of what I would consider to be Bobby de Niro quality.

I really wanted to like it.  The short rib was just OK.  It was well cooked.  The sauce was what made it go from a possible great dish to just OK.  It just didn't have the exciting flavors I was hoping for.  It didn't pair well with the side dish (not that the side dish was going to pair well with anything).I would go 3 star, but dessert, wine, and my dining companions' dishes all went well.  I'm going to chalk this up to either a) an off night or b) an off dish.  I'll try it again and update my review.  Stay tuned.  In the meantime, stay away from the short rib.",1,0,0,Aaron S.,"Mercer Island, WA",3,27,0

I came here for RW because I heard it was good and there was a good veg. option for my friend. From the moment we sat down and did not order wine-both of us had to get up early the next day-our waitress looked annoyed and acted cold. Considering it was RW you would think she wanted to turn tables faster but after dessert we told her we were finished, yet waited at least 20 minutes before asking someone for the check cause she disappeared. The food was a little disappointing for me. The cauliflower soup was good but too watery and the scallops didn't seem as fresh. My friend liked her tomato and feta salad though. I ordered the bass because I had recently eaten shortrib, and the fish tasted bland and just ok texture. For dessert I sampled the chocolate cake which was pretty good.

4.0,7/30/2007,"I stocked up on Restaurant Week reservations this summer after missing the previous season's because of school and work. Tribeca Grill was the last reservation I had on the last Friday of RW. My original reservation was for 9:30pm for 4, however when a good friend of mine came to the city for that night, Tribeca Grill effortlessly changed my reservation to seat 5. The decor was jovial with rich colors, the overall atmosphere was much louder and more  casual than the other restaurants I had been to earlier in the week (Butter, Park Ave Summer, Brasserie, Bolo). The crowd was mainly in the late 20s to late 30s. We all ordered from the RW menu. I initially thought the Cauliflower Soup with Bay Scallops was a strange combination but it was rich, creamy and delicious. For the main entree, I ordered the Roasted Striped Bass. I'm more of a fan of Chilean Sea Bass and found the Striped Bass to be tougher and less flavorful. The dish was a bit bland with too much lemony taste. I didn't finish the dish. For dessert, I ordered the Vanilla Panna Cotta - nothing spectacular. The panna cotta was not as creamy as I would have liked and I could barely taste the vanilla. However, the waiters were polite and attentive. The atmosphere was perfect for a medium to large party. I felt like I could talk comfortably without being overheard by the other table. Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere more than the food. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could.  Tribeca Grill was very classy but I would rather go to 3 of my other 5 RW restaurants again before trying Tribeca Grill a second time.",0,0,0,Michelle Y.,"New York, NY",20,59,23

The decor, ambience and service are quite nice - gotta hand it to De Niro, as the paintings by his father and the overall decoration lend a nice atmosphere to the place. It's certainly a nice place to take that special someone, but Wolfgang's down the block is better if you want a good steak, and Thalassa across the way is equally nice in terms of elegance and ambience.

3.0,4/11/2006,"My experience seems unique from the other reviewers but Tribeca Grill was, overall, just a disappointment to me and both of my companions.We made a reservation for 8:45 on a Saturday night and arrived at about 8:35. A little early so we waited at the bar... until 9:25. I don't know, but a 40 minute wait with a reservation (even on a Saturday night) seems like a bit much to me.I found the service to be kind of spotty. Although we got attention kind of rarely, when we did it was usually very good. This might have been because it was a Saturday night and they were fairly packed but it seemed like her other tables she was serving got more attention than ours. The ice water that we first asked for never came but we decided to have a bottle of Pellegrino and that came quickly enough. Then, we sat with our menus closed, ready to order through about three rounds of eye contact until the waitress came to take our orders. All the food came very quickly, though.We started out with the Ginger & Lemongrass Poached Shrimp, Duck Leg Confit,  and the Poached Maine Lobster. They were all decent enough, but nothing special. We followed up with the Grilled Filet of Beef, Black Trumpet Crusted Rack of Lamb and Grilled Atlantic Salmon. I had the filet, which came with Garlic Whipped Potatoes, Sauted Spinach & Crispy Onion Rings. Every part of my entre was bland and terribly unexciting. My friends didn't speak highly of their entres either.Considering that I hadn't eaten very much earlier in the day and that hunger is the best spice, I think the food should have tasted much better.

We finally went here last week with a whole passel of family for restaurant week this year. I always find that restaurant week is a bit of a gamble - sometimes the three or four prix fixe choices are really boring. And sometimes they're cooked badly and not representative of the true flair of the restaurant at all. That was not the case at Tribeca Grill - the three prix fixe options were pretty good - starters included a chestnut soup, blue cheese and endive salad, or a roasted quail appetizers. I went with the goat cheese ravioli for my entree, but I tasted the short ribs and the bass - both were very, very tasty.

5.0,7/15/2005,"Co-owned by restaurateur Drew Nieporent and actor Robert De Niro, the Tribeca Grill helped this once desolate section of lower Manhattan become a popular tourist destination. Since it opened, the neighborhood has evolved from a primarily industrial district into a lively area known for its many art galleries, boutiques, upscale eateries, and overpriced residential lofts. Located on the first two floors of the Tribeca Film Center, the restaurant is housed in a historic 1905 warehouse that was once the Martinson Coffee factory. With its high ceilings, exposed brick walls, and oversized windows, it retains the character of its surroundings while preserving a bit of history - the large mahogany bar is from the legendary Maxwell's Plum restaurant. All the artwork on display is by De Niro's late father. It's difficult to say which is the bigger draw here - the outstanding contemporary American cuisine or the possibility of sighting a celebrity at a nearby table, a regular occurrence given that the restaurant's investors include actors Bill Murray, Sean Penn, Ed Harris, and Christopher Walken, dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, and artist Peter Max. In the event you're here on an evening when the stars are a no-show, it won't be a total loss, because there's nothing disappointing about the food. We started with a generous portion of rare seared tuna served with spicy sesame noodles and pickled vegetables, and roasted spiced shrimp accompanied by mango, papaya, and avocado drizzled with a coconut-lime vinaigrette. For our main courses, we selected braised short ribs, tender and meaty, served with a porcini mushroom and chicken liver mousse, spring onions, and sweet carrots, and a perfectly grilled Atlantic salmon, with shiitake mushrooms, English peas, and a potato puree flavored with horseradish. Pricey but worth it, celebrity sightings or not.",3,0,3,Gourmet G.,"San Francisco, CA",99,2099,2099
