4.0,2/17/2019,"I brought my mom here for dinner, and without a reservation on a Sunday night, we got seated within twenty minutes. The atmosphere is classier and attracts an older and more upscale crowd. There were a few big families celebrating birthdays, which created a warm vibe. We were brought a bread basket with an olive spread, which was actually the star of the night. She got a spaghetti with tomato sauce and I got the grouper. I loved my entree and thought it was worth every penny, especially since the filet was a hefty seven to eight ounces. I asked them to replace the potatoes with lentil salad, which they did. My mom's dish, however, was very oily and undercooked, even though she specifically asked it to be well-done. All in all, I was content, but her very plain dish could've been more quality. They also brought a few pieces of complimentary dessert, which was fun to try. The service felt lacking, maybe because we were a small party and sitting in a corner, but certain things took longer than they should've. I do recommend this restaurant for a classy ambiance or pre-theater meal, especially if you're looking to get a bit dressed up or celebrate a special occasion. I'll admit I felt out of place here in my leggings and UGGs!",3,2,5,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",978,2060,1393

5.0,2/8/2019,"INCREDIBLE gluten free food and wonderful service! We walked in about an hour before seeing a show and there were no tables available. The hostess brought some chairs and sat us at the bar until a table opened up. She brought us the menus while at the bar and took food orders from there to make sure we had enough time to enjoy our meal. She gave us a 4 seater table instead of having us wait for a 2 seater and was so kind throughout the evening! I have celiac and my boyfriend and I ordered a gluten free gnocchi with bolognese as well as gluten free ravioli with marinara sauce. Both of them were amazing - the gnocchi melted in your mouth and was the best thing we ate in 4 days in NYC including several Italian restaurants! The sauce was superb, very flavorful and well seasoned. My boyfriend loved his old fashioned drink as well which strengthened in flavor as it sat.

It was Wednesday last week, it was a very cold night, however they were fully staffed. Despite being NY restaurant week the restaurant was virtually empty. There were only 4 or 5 tables filled. The staff were very attentive although they did forget side orders. The food was ok, nothing to rave to about. My colleague ordered the restaurant week 3 course special. I ordered a la carte and had steak. We both agreed the wine (our choice was great) the food was not. It was not terrible, it was a solid average. I would not return based on the food that night.

3.0,2/1/2019,"Came here for a private event upstairs for work and the menu was not impressive. The food was actually pretty bad. Maybe the food was catered elsewhere? But it is a restaurant so I am not sure. The lasagna they served was frozen..multiple frozen veggies in the middle. That was a huge turn-off. The appetizers were good though but I couldn't help but wonder if these were frozen as well then just baked. The event space is narrow, long, limited in seats, and their timing of the food was so off.

5.0,6/23/2018,"At first, I was pretty skeptical of coming here because it didn't have many reviews. But this place surprised me by being a good fancier restaurant for dinner, with great service and food. The server was very friendly and joked with us. The restaurant is very flexible in what dishes it could make for customers. For example we saw the special event that was happening: the black truffle festival, and we were excited bc we thought there would be truffle fries. Turns out they didn't have it, but we asked and they said they could make it for us. The food is great especially the shrimp risotto and lemon cake.

3.0,6/19/2018,Had dinner before a show at the Town Hall yesterday. The staff couldn't have been nicer or more attentive. I had the calamari and zucchini fritte and my companion had the roasted Cornish hen. It all was ok. The calamari could have been better it was a little on the chewy side but the marinara dipping sauce was good and the Cornish hen was swimming in sauce which had a spice in in that overwhelmed the whole dish.

5.0,5/28/2018,"Understated, modern elegance is what you'll find here along with table linen service. Food dishes are sophisticated and absolutely gourmet, will please any foodie. Adding onto that, the dining experience is very relaxed, you won't feel you're being hurried through your meal. Because it's not a hurried experience allow for extra time if going pre-theater. I had the eggplant parmigiana and ordered fried polenta sticks as a pairing. The best polenta sticks I've hand in the U.S. and the eggplant parmigiana took eggplant parmigiana to a new level. It wasn't as heavy as the dish can be, melts in your mouth. We ordered both hot molten chocolate lava cake and ricotta cheesecake for dessert. Best lava cake I've ever had, it was ridiculous with a complicated almost chocolate-espresso flavor not as sickeningly sweet as some make, it was refined cooking. The cheesecake at first surprises. It's not heavy like most cheesecakes. It's way more understated and super light and was refreshing to the palate with a refined strawberry compote on top. While it was a new taste in cheesecake, I loved it. This will be my go to place in the theater district. Upscale but understated. Modern but has an old world charm in that it's like those other great theater row restaurants that are slightly submerged below street level making it feel like a tucked away hideaway. I recommend icon parking at their 350 West 50th Street location for parking but reserve on line to get great parking rates. Has an exit on 49th near 9th so it's a short walk to this restaurant and not a cramped parking lot like most. Thanks to Etcetera Etcetera I had a very special reunion with a college friend.

3.0,4/8/2018,"Etcetera Etcetera is just about as standard as it gets. I suppose that makes sense, given the name. ""It's an Italian restaurant in the Theater District complete with salads, pastas, and mains, ranging from surf to turf.......etc., etc (in other words, the rest you can easily deduce from there). Everything is expected and nothing is bad. It's a solid, reliable option when it comes to getting your pre-theater fix. I wouldn't go out of your way for it, but I'd say it's more appealing than most other restaurants in the area. Came here at 6pm for a pre-show meal with the bf and the family. It's removed enough from the Times Square insanity (closer to 9th ave), which is a plus. That said, the ambiance is a tad strange. Dark, but not in an intimate way. A red-and-black color scheme, not Horror-level ominous but a tad unsettling. Overall, though the space had a nice energy--very full on a Friday night--certainly facilitated by good service.Drink-wise, nothing spectacular. Hit-and-miss.The cocktails are okay, the wines (those offered by the glass, at least) are mediocre-average. The five us ordered cocktails to start, swapping all at the beginning to get a sampling. Though the cocktail menu isn't up on the website, I can offer a few thoughts--the Sazerac is solid (not too strong on the absinthe, always a plus in my book), the namesake cocktail (the ""Etcetera Etcetera"") was juvenile attempt at an off-brand Jolly Rancher, and the bourbon/gin/cucumber concoction (called the ""Mr. ____ ) my sister and I ordered was probably the nicest offering of the bunch. Wine-wise, I tried a glass of the Sauvingon Blanc with my meal, and it was disappointing.IMPORTANT NOTE for cocktails: one strange quirk (yes, I'm aware that's redundant) is the pours. You'd think management strongly discourages all toast-making (the alcohol kind, not the bread kind), and perhaps drink manners altogether. They'll bring your glass and shaker over separately and proceed to pouring the shaker's contents into your glass--higher and higher--as if to imply a fierce belief in surface tension. This will require you to recall how you once learned to bob for apples at a county fair, hoping that muscle memory serves you well. In other words, ""Look, ma! No hands!""The food here is best categorized as ""safe"". Nothing wowed me, and many of the dishes blended together. I suppose I shouldn't be too surprised--in the Theater District (which I avoid at all costs), a restaurant needs to have mass appeal. They're playing to their audience. I shouldn't have been expecting anything wildly creative here. It's a broad menu, nice variety of options, something for everyone. I'm not even sure Etcetera is doing anything wrong--I'm probably just a pretentious little snot at this point because I dine out so much. Anyway, here are our eats, below:Kale, Radicchio, Endive and Quinoa Salad w/ Apples, Toasted Almonds and Gorgonzola: BDecent, though nothing spectacular/memorable. None of the salads looked particularly noteworthy here (and they all seemed quite similar to one another) but this one seemed like one of the better options. Decent flavors, though I could've done with a bit less gorgonzola. It wasn't as flavorful as I was expecting so the sweetness of the apples was a nice addition.(Special) Radicchio, Endive and Soft Boiled Egg w/ Duck: BConceptually confusing. It was one of the nightly specials so perhaps they were trying something new out. All components involved seemed like they could be promising, but the execution fell flat for me. The duck was kind of just ""there"" and didn't really play an important role. I love duck, and this felt like a throwaway. Thin, chewy pieces hidden amongst, yes, more endive and radicchio! It's a good thing I like endive and radicchio and I do like what they have to offer as far as texture goes. White and Black Sesame-Crusted Roasted Salmon w/ Lentil Salad and Cherry Tomato Vinaigrette: B+Well-cooked piece of salmon (props to them for asking how we'd like it done--I don't often hear that with salmon), nice presentation. A safe dish, but good flavors. I enjoyed the crunch from the seeds, but otherwise nothing was standout.(Special) Pistachio-Crusted Rack of Lamb w/ Mashed Sweet Potatoes and Roasted Vegetables (special): A-Our best dish of the night. I've seen pistachio and lamb paired together before, and they complement each other nicely. Rich and nutty, cooked well, nice accompaniments.",6,1,1,Molly T.,"New York, NY",887,463,1480

I honestly gave them 2 stars based off service- it was the only worthwhile attribute. The food absolutely does not deserve 2 stars. It's run of the mill Italian food that's served to appear high end, which it is not. The pricing far exceeds quality and quantity of the dishes provided. All 5 guests in my party ordered different items off the menu, and all 5 items were consistently small dishes. None of which, were filling in the slightest.They do have gluten free options but beware the ravioli is literally 5 pieces of pasta and tomato sauce... but you guessed it extremely over priced!

It was a little tight but not uncomfortable by any means and they were certainly accommodating. The food is delicious but definitely order the full size since the half portions were somewhat tiny and the full sizes were only marginally larger. The staff is very nice and we're quick to answer any questions or put in any last minute orders. Dessert is incredibly here, their chocolate pudding dish is very rich and, as they will tell you, is their most popular dessert, which is by all means a rightfully deserved title. My brothers fell in love with the chocolate cake. The banana semifredido and mango creme brûlée were unique and delicious as well. This is certainly a place to dress up for as the restaurant decor and the customers are all quite fancy.

4.0,5/14/2017,"Nice spot for an upscale Italian brunch. They had a lot of nice specials for Mother's Day, but we stuck with the original menu. Italian meats board to start - served with these delicious little crispy puffed bread bites. All in all a little salty but in a good way. I had the crab cake Benedict for main - crab cake was outstanding, a bit heavy on the filler but very much Italian style, the hollandaise sauce and greens gave me a weird super salty bite from time to time, but overall it was a nice dish. My celiac husband had the gluten free tagliatelle with bolognese and would definitely go back for it. For dessert we had the mango creme brûlée and the chocolate pudding (owner's grandmother's recipe). Both were delicious, the mango compote won't please creme brûlée purists, but I enjoyed it. The chocolate pudding was bittersweet but in just the right way. Our Cabernet was the wrong year listed on the menu but still lovely.

1.0,8/11/2016,"This restaurant didn't nail a single aspect of service with the unique exception of the support staff, who were admittedly spectacular. If these 4 & 5 star reviews are coming from New Yorkers, their standards are low and my local denizens are doing the community a disservice.I will say that the support staff was exceptional-warm, hospitable, and attentive.Our server was abysmal, and after we informed him that we weren't having drinks, could not have been less interested in us. When he got around to taking our order, he informed us that they were out of fried green tomatoes (absolutely understandable-I work in restaurants and am fully aware that items get 86'd). That said, he felt the need to elaborate and tell us that they had been 86'd for weeks... Guys, reprint the menus, or at the very least tell guests when they start looking at the menu when an item isn't available, it's a win/win no? I certainly don't recommend winging it and telling the guest that ""green tomatoes aren't good right now"" because, it's tomato season...The fusilli with seasonal vegetables was embarrassing-I cannot imagine a chef in New York City being proud of the insult of a dish that arrived, and the audacity to charge $24 for dried pasta drizzled with frozen vegetables would be impressive, if it weren't so offensive.We saw our server zero times throughout the meal. We tried to order a soda which we watched dying on the service bar for about 5 minutes before a member of the service staff was able to run it; and despite the tiny (50+ seat?) dining room, had to flag him down to get the check. I hadn't planned on writing a Yelp review, and had hoped to speak with the manager on the way out but she was nowhere to be seen.Etcetera Etcetera wouldn't survive a month if it weren't for the location.

3.0,7/17/2016,"With a name like Etcetera Etcetera, one would expect this establishment to have a whimsical quality of sorts. Perhaps it would have an eclectic menu fusing together several cultures and/or areas of the globe. Maybe it would feature a slightly rustic but classy decor, with quirky servers clad in button-down shirts traversing the aisles on scooters.But this place exhibits none of the above, which makes the name choice quite bewildering.One walks in to Etc. Etc. and is greeted by a young adult dressed in a fashionable but casual manner, but beyond this point, one sees a dimly lit space dominated by square tables and chairs laid out in typical grid fashion. Plates, silverware, and napkins are of the usual variety. Personally, I felt like I was immediately entering another dimension of sorts.As for the members of the waitstaff, they are all identically dressed in a standard uniform. On the whole, their body language and speech is quite formal. If you were to leave your during the meal, you would return to your seat to find your napkin perfectly folded and placed in the exact center of your eating area. Yes, it is *that* type of place. One might ask whether or not the ""Etc. Etc. Elements"" are part of the menu, but in my humble opinion, the answer to that question is largely a no. The ""Handmade crescenza ravioli with fava beans, oven dried tomatoes, basil oil and pecorino"" (half portion, $18) was indeed tasty but hardly inventive. Furthermore, the ""Handmade potato gnocchi with pistachio-arugula pesto, french beans and stracciatella cheese"" (half portion, $19) was dominated by the taste of the pesto. While I think pesto is delicious, it completely overpowered the French beans and stracciatella cheese to the point where they should have simply been removed. Their best tasting dish, in our group's opinion, was the ""Homemade gluten-free tagliatelle"" ($28) with tomato sauce and vegetables, which was prepared pretty much according to its name: pasta and vegetables cooked with tomato sauce.The reader may be wondering why I am being particularly picky with this establishment. The two main reasons are price and portion size. The ""half"" portion appears to be a fraction of a ""full"" one and yet is disproportionately more than half the price. At $16-20 for half portions and $24-29 for full portions, one would expect a certain uniqueness in plating, technique, or introduction of more complex flavors or ingredients. Indeed, their pasta, being homemade, is quite flavorful, and the ingredients used are fresh and top-notch. However, these positive points, along with the restaurant's tourist-filled, prime location near the bright lights of the Theater District, do not give Etc. Etc. a free pass to avoid inventiveness, which is generally expected for a restaurant of this caliber in Midtown Manhattan. In any case, I would not dismiss Etcetera Etcetera completely and would say that it is worth a try if you are in the area.",1,0,1,Calvin A.,"Jersey City, NJ",162,141,0

The service was impeccable and I topped my meal off with a dark chocolate gelato and Italian cookies that I had to take home because too full. A must try place!

They only dish that was just ok was the Veal Meatballs, they were too tough and chewy.  The waiter also erroneously ordered the half portion instead of full portion of my hubby's dinner and he had to wait for his other to come out after I was done.",0,0,0,Evelyn D.,"Baldwin, NY",0,33,22
4.0,5/23/2016,"I'm not usually jazzed about Midtown restaurants in general but this one turned out to be a great choice for us since we needed to catch a Broadway show.   I loved the fact that it was upscale but non-commercial and our dinner service was friendly and efficient.  This particular evening, we went all out.  After walking around for 8+ hours, we were ready to eat a house and didn't hold back.  For starters, we shared the warm octopus salad, the baby arugula salad and the complimentary focaccia bread with olive tapenade.  All disappeared from our table into our bellies within 5-10 minutes.   Portions are huge too!  I especially enjoyed the octopus as it was so tender.  4.5/5  The arugula salad hit the spot as well and would be a 5/5 if it was just a tad less salty.  For our mains, I had the grilled artic char with the lobster mashed potatoes and broccolini but also shared a half order of the basil spaghetti with lump crab.   OMG, what a huge portioned entree but hey, I still managed to clean off that entire dish.  The char was coated with a nice crunchy herb coating and cooked ever so perfectly.  I also loved their version of the lobster mashed as well.  I believe they used sweet potatoes as opposed to regular white potatoes and the broccolini was tasty and snappy.  4/5I probably could've passed on the spaghetti with crab though.  It wasn't bad but wasn't memorable either.  The sauce just didn't have much kick to it and the pasta could've been cooked more al dente.  3/5 For desserts, we shared a trio of gelattos/sorbets and the risotto cheesecake.  The dark chocolate and lemon flavors were a great hit while the cheesecake was noticeably underwhelming.  You can tell that wasn't made in-house.  Overall, a winner.  If you have to dine around the Broadway area, this is must try!",3,0,2,Sonia N.,"Boston, MA",610,398,2815

Super delicious but pretty expensive for a half dish. Also, the portion was really tiny. I don't have a huge appetite and I was full off that entree mainly because I scarfed down the bread they give. For those with bigger appetites, definitely go for the full size. (Talking to you, dudes.) I ordered a drink which was also ridiculously expensive. (Boo.)The atmosphere was nice.

It kind of got a little monotonous after the sixth mouthful and It definitely could have been hotter in temperature. The vegetables were great. There were plenty of them and they were well cooked. The food just needed a little something else to take it from good to great.Having said this though this was the perfect choice of restaurant in the end because after the meal we were left to chat for as long as we liked.

3.0,2/16/2016,"Prior to coming here for restaurant week, I had never heard of Etcetera Etcetera. My friend and I had made reservations for 730 but had arrived early so we took a seat at the bar and got some drinks. Being the end of a work day, we both desperately needed drinks and wanted to get buzzed before dinner.The bartender seemed a bit busy but was still able to attend to us. My friend was able to decide what she wanted immediately, amaretto soda. While I was being nitpicky and couldn't commit to anything. My eyes eventually spotted the Vesper, a classic James Bond cocktail, and I had to have it. I had tried making it before and failed spectacularly. Etcetera Etcetera's version, was delicious and very strong. Major kudos to the restaurant for having this classy drink on the menu for pretentious people like me. Ordering from the prefixe menu for Restaurant week we had the Grilled Portobello Mushroom and Potato, leek and saffron soup to start. The mushrooms were delicious and made me regret ordering something else. The Soup was not particularly spectacular. I expect a cream soup with saffron to have a different hue than what the soup actually had. For our main dishes, we ordered the Pan roasted sea bass with eggplant caponata and olive oil mashed potatoes & Mascarpone and spinach ravioli with sweet butter and sage. The sea bass was pretty unique, and had a great flavor to it. I do wish that the skin was a bit crispier. The Ravoli were plump bursting with flavor. I did wish for a bit more ravolis though. It seemd a bit lacking on the plate compared to the Sea BassFor the dessert we ordered the Selection of homemade gelato and sorbetto & Homemade apple tart with vanilla, caramel and whipped cream. Since I don't really remember the flavors that we ordered, I'll assume that it was not spectacular. The apple tart however, was excellent. It was a skinned apple that was caramelized on top of a pastry. I loved the fact that instead of using sliced apples they kept the apple in one piece and caramelized the whole thing. The pastery however was a bit hard. Even though it offered a textural difference, it seemed way too out of place. Cutting through the apple to hard pastry resulted in the knife cutting through and hitting the plate really hard. Overall, Etcetera Etcetera is a solid restaurant pick.

The slightly bitter (but delicious) ravioli was offset by the slight sweetness of the eggplant parmesan and it made for a delightful experience.",0,0,0,Brian M.,"Setauket- East Setauket, NY",0,14,0

The day of our dinner, they offered complimentary coat check. Our server always made sure we were ok several times during our meal without being annoying. The meal itself was great. I had a house salad that was presented nicely and tasted great. My fiancé had something lemon with mushroom, which was really good too. We both had sea bass, which was made very well - the skin was crunchy (but not too crunchy) and the meat was moist. Well done! The dessert wasn't anything special, not amazing.

2.0,1/27/2016,"Flaccid and disappointing.Literally left a bad taste in our mouths. The try-hard lounge music playing just a little too loud in the background did nothing to help or hide the tacky decor of this sham of an Italian restaurant. I am an avid lover of Italian food and the ""lasagna"" they serve here made me want to weep. The pasta was overcooked to an inedible point, unless you convinced your brain that you'd actually ordered a stew. The fact that it was green pasta did nothing to help the dish's aesthetic appeal or its uninspired flavor. The veal was unremarkable, which should never be said of a dish that cost the life of a baby cow. The fact that the dish was almost $30 is laughable in retrospect. Should've gotten like 3 burritos at Chipotle instead. My date ordered the sea bass, one of the three entrees being offered for Restaurant Week (an option we foolishly passed up for a la carte options because we're picky skeptics). The fish was served soggy skin up and if you're not a fan of steamed fish, steer clear of this dish. The fish meat itself was wet and nearly flavorless, the skin was gelatinous. Let's not even speak of the pile of strange, brown, wrinkly vegetables that the fish was served on...have you ever even had real caponata? I can't even. My date, who has a passion for potatoes, shockingly had nothing to say about the measly dollop of mashed potatoes that, when mixed with the ""caponata,"" sadly only contributed to the overall mushyness of the dish. Oh, we also ordered some sides as appetizers before all that. But the dishes aren't even really worth talking about, to be honest.We didn't order dessert, which is a rarity when we go out for dinner. We had completely lost our appetite though we still felt unsatisfied. Looking back, despite our dissatisfaction, I notice that we actually wound up ordering some of the most expensive menu options, at the recommendations of our hostess. Coincidence? I think not.

I always suggest this place to anyone looking for quality Italian food. Two things I find hard to swallow in customers reviews:1. The ambience and size of the establishment in NYC, that also has hand-crafted and designed food; how cheap do you expect it to be?2. These humans work in Hospitality, they are not servants.The owner has greeted me every time I have been there, not needed but nice to see a working man, the server took note of how I'm 'the only person to have ever pronounced that properly' when ordering the Scialatielli pasta - I'm not sure if it's still on the menu but I have always had a more than pleasant experience at Etc, EtcThe Veal pasta being my absolute favorite, I would still recommend this place to anyone in the city. My friends know to come with open arms/mouth/eyes when they go out to dine with me. The style and art of dining is something that is lost; nowadays it's often met with arrogance, a lack of knowledge, and even worse - a sense of entitlement often judged by people who know nothing about food or service, let alone how to cook. (this isn't your ma's kitchen)I will always defend those who work hard in the industry; this is someone's 'baby,' someone's pride and joy and when I go to Etc, Etc., it definitely shines through.Thank you for being one of the few places in NYC I can look to for fantastic food!- L.O.",2,0,0,Lucky O.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,13,1

3.0,10/19/2015,"Ahhh, Etcetera Etcetera...This restaurant is so aptly named as it really is just like rest. I really wanted to like this place, but it's yet another cliche Theater District Italian restaurant serving average food with above average prices. My fellow Yelpers may be using the phrase ""hidden gem"" a bit too fast and loose on this one.Came here on a Friday night with the SO prior to watching Curious Incident. After enduring the hell that is Times Square to make our 6pm reservation, we were greeted by the host and were immediately seated. The interior has a relatively modern feel -- very clean, grey tones throughout with some heavy red accents, a contemporary back-lit bar, along with some bizarre rugs and other decor (which looked like haphazardly rolled/folded bed sheets) lining the walls. All together, the aesthetics were a bit odd, but nothing to make a fuss about. To start, the SO went with a sav blanc ($11) and I ordered the Old Fashioned ($16). While she liked the wine, I was unimpressed by the cocktail. In the spirit of Halloween, the orange peel and a cherry were frozen inside a brain-shaped ice cube. I was unimpressed. I'm usually all for novelty, but not when it compromises the flavor of the drink, especially one so expensive. When in doubt, keep the cocktails simple please. For our dishes we shared the following:Burrata ($17) - Really fresh and tasty. The pesto and balsamic really worked well together.Brussel Sprouts ($9) - Decent. Cooked well, not too oily. Served with pancettaSquid Ink Pasta w/ Lobster ($27) - Bland city. While the dish looked great (the head and tail in my pic are just shells to pretty it up), the flavors were completely muted. Couldn't even really taste the lobster meat.Sea Scallops ($30) - Good, not great. Bacon wrapping was a nice touch. No major qualms with this dish other than the price. Four scallops for $30 is a bit too steep to me.As for the service, it was unusual. We had three different servers throughout the evening, which made it a bit confusing who to ask questions to or look to for drink refills. That said, all the servers were still quite friendly and gracious. We skipped dessert and the check came out to $160 with tax and tip. That number includes two wines and a cocktail as well, but even so, it's way too hefty a bill given the mediocre quality of the food. If I do come here again, which is very unlikely, maybe I'll give the prix fixe menu a try for $38.

The lasagna was the envy of those around me who picked chicken or salmon - much better choice to go Italian here and not the bland salmon or chicken, apparently.The dessert - I asked for a nut mousse, and got a tiramisu.

Great Italian food that is inexpensive enough to have a casual dinner, but with an ambience that is nice enough for a date or a family.

The Gluten Free options are superb. This is the first place I know of that serves gluten free gnocchi and ravioli and does it really well! Like, reminds me of food in Italy kind of well!I ordered the gluten free butter and basil gnocchi. The plate was middle to large size and I wiped it clean. The ingredients were simple and basic and I was missing something in the dish because I generally like more complex flavors. My husband had the spinach filled gluten free ravioli and to me they were also simple but good in true Italian fashion. Service was good. Nothing stood out which is a good thing.The only thing I didn't like was the price tag. I think $30 is a lot for a pasta dish even with gluten free premium included.

3.0,6/22/2015,"We heard about this place from a recommendation from a friend for a spot before a Broadway play.  FYI-it's a bit of a walk in heels to see Wicked.  I made a reservation a week before on Open Table without any trouble.  We arrived exactly at our reservation time and were offered a table near the stairs to the bathroom or upstairs.  We sat upstairs because the table near the stairs looked like a spot where one of us would get banged into a lot.  I was a bit disappointed by upstairs because it lacked any ambiance.  Also a table with rowdy children sat near us.  However the waiter made up for the lack of ambiance.  He was knowledgable, friendly and accommodating. To begin they give several types of bread with kalmata  olive spread.  It was a delicious combination.  The food came within five minutes of ordering, but I think they did that to ensure people make their show.  I ordered the truffle gnocchi upon reading recommendations on Yelp.  It was decent, but didn't look like the picture someone posted on Yelp.  It didn't have anything besides gnocchi and a cream truffle sauce.  A half portion would have been enough. The person I was with ordered the basil pasta with crab and peppers.  It was okay but tasted like a dish I could easily duplicate. The waiter brought over a plate of small complimentary cookies after we finished.

The octopus salad was good, tender pieces of octopus with tomatoes, warm fingerling potatoes and if I remember a mustard based dressing?? The burrata and tomato salad was delicious. The bread with olive tapenade was awesome. The portions are enormous (great for sharing but if you intend to eat it yourself I recommend getting the half.) The Brussel sprouts were my favorite- simply roasted with pancetta. The wine was very good. The service was great.

There are just way too many better Italian restaurants in the city to ever waste time or money in this one.- The ambiance is just meh. A mix between midtown business clients and tourists getting a meal before the theater. Not that there's anything wrong with either of the two crowds, but you are not going to get the fun/intimate gem-like spot type of vibe here nor is it really business-like enough to have a real client dinner at this place.Verdict: If the wind blew this restaurant away or this place disappeared because of some magic spell of a fairy, nobody in town will really miss it or notice it being gone.

4.0,10/27/2014,"Came here for brunch yesterday after reading the reviews, and my friend and I were both thoroughly pleased! Upfront I should say it's a classy place, not a loosey boozy brunch spot. It's also worth noting that the classiness tends to attract an older, better dressed crowd. I was honestly a little embarrassed in my jeans and tee -- I recommend dressing a little less casually if you want to fit in. That said, my being underdressed did not affect the service at all and everyone was wonderfully attentive and helpful throughout our meal.Now for the food! First: the bread basket. I'm not sure what kind of bread it was on the one side of the basket, but it was really really good; seemed like one part corn bread, one part focaccia. The other side of the basket had about 6-8 mini muffins in blueberry and cranberry flavors (and maybe another I didn't get to). I love brunch baskets with variety! For brunch itself you have a few options: $25 brunch prix-fixe including a drink (alcoholic OR juice + coffee), salad, and entree, the $25 year-round ""restaurant week"" lunch prix-fixe with app, entree, and dessert, and the regular lunch menu. My friend and I splurged quite a bit, ordering two lunch entrees plus the brunch PF for just the two of us. The mimosa came with a raspberry floating at the top, which I'm a sucker for (it's the little things). The prix-fixe salad is sizable and perfectly dressed. For my entree I got the souffle omelette with mushrooms and goat cheese -- it was SO. GOOD. I couldn't finish it, it was so much food between that and the truffle gnocchi my friend and I split in addition to our meals. But the omelette reheated surprisingly well this morning and splurging on the extra entree for the gnocchi was 100% worth it. The gnocchi were light and fluffy and the parmesan black truffle sauce was heavenly.As if we hadn't already indulged enough, we also split the pumpkin ice cream for dessert and were very happy. The cookie crumbled on top added a delicious crunch and the raisin sauce to pour over really brought everything together. Though it was nearly empty when we got there (around 11:45), it definitely filled up more by around 1pm. So make a reservation or come early!",2,0,0,Devin S.,"Woodside, NY",88,255,13

My appetizer was an easy arugula salad with fresh shaved Parmesan, it was simple and delicious. I was able to also taste the eggplant stuffed with smoked mozzarella, it was good, but I preferred my salad. My entree was skirt steak (perfectly well done to my liking) with potatoes and spinach. Yummy! I shared the shrimp risotto with my husband: it was everything you'd expect in a risotto, creamy, rich, filling and perfectly comforting. The meal description said it was prepared in a pistachio pesto, I have to admit that I didn't taste any of that nutty goodness but the dish was great. Desserts were either a chocolate lava cake or a trio of sorbets. Of course I indulged in the cake that was PERFECT, warm, creamy, and decadent! Our tea/coffee came with sublime mini sweet bites, it was a perfect closing touch to a perfect meal.

This wasn't typical ""American Italian"" in that dishes weren't heavily (or sauced) at all, so if you want traditional (or what we consider traditional Italian) this may not be your spot. My brother asked if they could make chicken parm and the waiter said no, the chefs are from Italy and chicken parm is not an Italian dish. Honestly, I prefer the less ""fancy"" American-style Italian we all know and love, but this was a nice change and I'd recommend it. I should also note that it was definitely a little pricey.",0,0,0,Kara M.,"Manhattan, NY",480,227,524

We were out of towners, delayed by the train and worried about making it to our Broadway show in time, but they were fast and attentive, while making us feel not rushed at all. So welcoming. Ok the food... wow. It is not cheap but absolutely worth every penny. We started with an amazing salad with toasted pine nuts, arugula, avocado, hearts of palm, tomatoes and shaved pecorino with a light dressing. After reading other reviews, my daughter and I got the half pasta portions  and it was just right. She had the gnocchi with chanterelles and asparagus which was homemade gnocchi and the best we've ever tasted. I had the pistachio risotto with shrimp. OMG it was soooo good. Our waiter suggested a a special cocktail they make there involving fig vodka and some other stuff and it was delicious. So glad he steered me to that lovely drink. They bring you A-mazing roasted tomato focaccia bread with olive tapenade. Addictive and worth every carb splurge. They bring you a plate of sweet little cookies at the end, they were excellent.

Bread/pastries were very delicious, especially when mixed with the jelly they provided. I had the minestrone soup, which was absolutely delicious.

I split a small order of the spaghetti with crab meat and roasted peppers and an order of the pappardelle with duck ragout. The pasta themselves were all cooked very well, although I thought the roasted peppers didn't work as well with the pasta dish. We split an order of the ricotta cheesecake, which was decent but not like Pepolino's. The noise level is not too bad, although the space is a bit cramped and his its bathroom somewhat concealed; it's through a door that's inconveniently in the middle of the dining room, which is a bit peculiar.

5.0,1/31/2014,"As my family and I crossed the George Washington bridge into Manhattan, I became nervous. We were on our way to see a broadway play, and our dinner plans were in shambles. Sure, I had reservations for a restaurant, but I never checked the Yelp reviews. (Amateur!)I won't mention any names, but Yelp, you tore this place apart like a puppy on a newspaper. I had to act fast, so I searched and saw Etcetera Etcetera was a favorite amongst Yelpers. After calling, I learned there were reservations available for the night, and I quickly booked the place sight unseen. As my family and I trudged through the slush and snow on one of the coldest days in history, we started to fantasize about this meal, one that would satisfy a seven-hour fast despite still knowing nothing about the restaurant.When we arrived at Etcetera Etcetera, I opened the door and glanced in--it was dead. Dead in a bad way. Only one couple was seated in the entire restaurant, and staff was crowded around the bar conversing amongst one another. If you've ever had bad service before, you know these are two gigantic, football field-sized red flags signaling exactly that. Now the anxiety really kicked in. Had Yelp let me down? I'd been hyping this place up all afternoon. If it sucked, my family would deem me unfit to pick restaurants forever and I'm not about that life. As I held the door open for sister, mom, and dad, my morale depleted as each passed in front of me, like I was coaxing each one toward an unfortunate fate.Then, I walked in. As if the restaurant manager blew an air horn, the staff sprung to life like a sports team running a game winning play. The hostess, bright and cheerful, greeted us immediately. The bartender went to his position behind the bar, servers tended to things around the restaurant and I was utterly blown away. I thought we had just left the broadway play, but this was shaping up to be the better performance of the night.Since the restaurant was so empty, I was especially observant during the walk to our table. I had time to scan the walls and look at the ornately-shaped lights mounted between each table, the deliberate placing and quality of the cutlery, and a general ambiance where one can assume their wallet will suffer greatly by the end of the night. If our entire dining experience with Etcetera Etcetera were a play, our waiter David was the director--orchestrating each ""act"" of our meal to make sure it was just right. His delivery and presentation of both the wine and food menus were nothing short of the most descriptive and passionate presentations I'd ever experienced. When asked for a particular wine, David mentioned it wasn't his favorite, and suggested another type, one we had never heard of. Of course it was delicious, and from then on we trusted his every recommendation--the equivalent of kicking back and enjoying a show. The olive tapenade, a macerated olive-oily spread served at the table with focaccia bread paired perfectly with the sweetness of   our wine, and became extremely addicting. This guy was good. Our fried calamari was crunchy, yet tender, and not overcooked. Although the small ramekin of fra-diavlo sauce was the perfect dipping companion, we quickly ran out. This wasn't a problem for long, if you're catching my drift.The burrata (mozzarella with ricotta cheese inside) was delicious. The green and red tomatoes that accompanied this artistically-crafted ball of cheese were bright and fresh, yet not overpowering. David mentioned Etcetera Etcetera hand-made all their pastas in house (with the exception of vegan dishes) and recommended the house specialty, Alla Bergamasca Casoncelli, a triangular ravioli stuffed with veal, raisin and amaretto filling topped with brown butter, pancetta and sage. Hearing each of my family members pass on this suggestion, I capitalized on their mistake. I tried the other dishes, and they were all great in their own way, but none of them compared to my little heaven pillows. I fully understand the wonder that is brown butter, and that it could probably make an old shoe taste good, but the way this sauce was able to coat and stick to the pasta meant you could get more of it per bite. And although I normally wouldn't associate raisins with pasta, when combined with this brown elixir the resulting flavor combination was so good, I'll return just to have it again. Finally, the chocolate mousse, tira misu, and specialty coffees including espresso and cappuccino were top notch. I have absolutely nothing but praise for this restaurant, its staff, and the cuisine it produces. As we left the restaurant, which was now absolutely packed, I realized I owed Yelp a serious thank you. I'm not sure if you can top this joint, but I'm eager to find out.",7,2,1,Mike R.,"Montgomery, NY",19,59,234

Went there with my family of 4 around 5:30PM right after a matinee show on one of the coldest nights and right after a major snowstorm. Made reservations on line with Open Table and walked in and immediately greeted by the hostess, bar tender and wait staff, all with a smile and welcoming us to their restaurant and the warmth. They only had one other table filled but within the hour the place was jam packed. David our waiter was entertaining, enthusiastic and made great suggestions. We started with their Burratta mozzarella with ricotta inside. WOW. The Fried Calamari was tender, and tasty. I had the Branzino and was perfectly cooked and flavorful. The veal ravioli with raisins and the basil spaghetti were to die for. All the pasta is home made. Liked the complimentary dish of biscotti with my cappuccino. Will tell my friends about it and all will return when back in the city.",0,0,0,Lou R.,"Montgomery, NY",2,16,0
2.0,1/21/2014,"I felt I needed to expressed my complete dissapoimtnet with our dinner on Saturday evening, Jan 18th. We arrived at 4:40pm, for our 5Pm reservation after coming directly from the Braodhurst Theater just down the road. My grandmother being 84 years old, we wanted to get her out of the cold and thought 20 minutes wasn't to terribly early. A drink at the bar while we waited would be fine after such a great show. The door was unlocked, so we entered. The staff was in the back having a meeting over their family meal, so we waited for someone to approach us, trying not interrupt their meal.  First of all, who has a meeting and family meal 20 minutes before dinner service? We waited ten very awkward minutes and still, no one had even addressed us. Another group of four entered and we began to tell them we're not quite sure what was going on but we've been here for about ten minutes with not even a hello.  We were waiting for the cameras to come out, and the ""What Would You Do"" host to come out from the kitchen. Now there were 11 of us standing near the bar unsure of what to do next. Conversations started about the show and how awkward this experience has been when we were rudely asked to quiet down from the manager, as there was a meeting going on. With that, the four top left saying they had never been treated so poorly. We would have followed but being that we were in the theater district at 5pm, we weren't sure we could find another restaurant. Plus, I didn't want my family and grandmother walking/standing out in the cold. After another awkward five minutes we were finally spoken to by the bartender asking, ""is anyone was helping us"". I said no, NO ONE has spoken to us, besides the shushing during your meeting. Finally, we were seated and I will say the food and service was great. We felt Mr. Hyde had replaced Dr. Jekyll as our service staff.  I knew exactly what was going on, the staff couldn't have cared less because our table of seven could have been filled with new patrons in five minutes but that's not the point of hospitality and good customer service. Our check was close to $400 and I would have much rather spent my money elsewhere.  I will not return nor recommended this place to anyone, which is unfortunate.",7,0,0,B-rad W.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",50,11,2
4.0,1/21/2014,"This was just a fun Saturday night dinner for me and a friend. I got both the special appetizer and entree. The salad was a spinach with Parmesan, pancetta, walnuts and a mustard vinaigrette. I really liked it. Nice combination of flavors. My entree was arctic char. The fish was cooked very nicely, and it had great flavor. Then for dessert I got the espresso panna cotta, which was luxurious and creamy and smooth, everything panna cotta should be. The coffee here is also quite good. The service was great but got worse toward the end when it took 15 minutes to bring the bill.

Both nicely sized and a great beginning to a meal. The pappardelle pasta with duck ragout was excellent. Something I would definitely order again. The atmosphere was also great.

Here are our thoughts on what we ate:Complimentary bread basket with olive tapanade- Really tasty and I don't even particularly care for olives. I loved it.Eggplant lasagna- simple, perfectly cooked crisp eggplant cheesy and tomato goodness.Gnocchi- Rich, decadent creamy, truffle loaded and light as air.Calamari- perfectly cooked with warm slightly spicy marinara, lemon and lime wedges- delicious.Seafood risotto- absolutely fantastic! perfectly al dente and each bite had a subtle taste of clam, mussel, or shrimp. Good wine flavor as well. Loved the hell out of this one.Rosemary scented fries- very solid.My daughter ordered lemon aid and received freshly squeezed lemons and water with only a hint of sugar- best ever.

1.0,11/10/2013,"- Small Portions Over Prices and POOR Service -This evening we decided to try Etcetera Etcetera  for dinner before a show.Little did we know the disappointment we were in for. We entered this nicely appointed restaurant based upon what we had read here on Yelp. That was our first mistake!The portions were extremely small, so small that I would say ridiculous, especially at the inflated prices charged. My choice from the extremely eclectic menu was a simple plate of veal meatballs, which the menu placed with French fries. No vegetable came with the dish. After an extended wait to get the waitresses attention, she agreed to serve my meat balls with spaghetti. When my dinner arrived, there sat three lonely and minuscule meatballs on top of something they called spaghetti. Even with an appetizer of fried calamari, I was left starving. So this evening I indulged with desert and chose the cheese cake. Oh, another mistake. My slice was so small that in three forks it was gone. Now for the biggest insult, my three meatballs came to $21 and my almost non existent desert was $9.I for one could never in all honesty recommend Etcetera Etcetera to anyone.Slow service, ultra small and portions and over, no REALLY OVER  priced at that, this is not my sort of place to eat.",3,0,0,Steven S.,"Southampton, NY",0,17,0

I don't usually pay much attention to stuff like, but they really did an excellent job here. I had a pretty standard, but tasty black gold margarita to start. Their cocktail list is extensive and inventive.To start we had a special tuna antipasto dish that was excellent. Lots of fresh tuna, cannellini beans, and crisp tomatoes. It was a great start to the night. For dinner I had the caramelle pasta, which is sort of like ravioli, but shaped like a wrapped salt water taffy. Deliciously filled with ricotta cheese and spinach and topped with arugula and prosciutto. Fairly light for a pasta dish and I would highly recommend it. To finish the evening off we had pistachio creme brulee that was really creamy with a thin and crispy top. A very large portion too!

The El Fico fig vodka cocktail with cucumber and lime juice was amazing and worth the pretty hefty price. I chose the skirt steak. It was a bit tough but flavorful, and I enjoyed the accompanying sides of asparagus and potatoes. My server was great, attentive and fun. They get kudos for having a charging station for phones at the host stand (Other restaurants in Manhattan: Please take notice.).

I was a bit skeptical at first because of the ease that came with making a reservation here, since every other decent restaurant in town was booked solid for three weeks. And then when I called to push back our res, there was no issue, but I was wrong! They were just being polite.And then we ate.And we drank.To start I ordered a peach Bellini, not too bad. My man wanted tequila, so he let the bartender decide what to make for him, and he was really pleased. I recommend that! The food! The food was great. I have one issue with the appetizer we had, though. We got the burrata, which was creamy and went well on a piece of focaccia, but it was just SO cold. Like, right out of the freezer, yes freezer, cold. I could taste the freezer on it, which was unfortunate.Our mains were good. We ordered half portions of two dishes: the mustard seed paparadelle in a duck ragout and the basil spaghetti with crab meat. I loved my mustard seed pasta, it was so different, kind of smoky and sweet at the same time. My man enjoyed his as well, but the pasta was undercooked. It could have used another 3 minutes in the pot. Our dessert was yummy too. I had the hazelnut semifreddo, which was just right. The presentation was lovely and it was just the right amount of sweet. My guy had the creme brulee, or the Crema Bruciata (he made me tell him how to pronounce it!) and he enjoyed it as well. It wasn't as sweet as I am used to, but it was damn creamy and I liked that.Overall, service was decent.

In a very stylish comfortable setting some really great food is being served here. Its an Italian influenced menu with food that is well prepared and fresh. My friend and I shared I ordered the prix fixe dinner, a bargain at 35.00 and my friend ordered the veal meatballs. we shared the p.f app of Pancetta, borlotti bean and onion polenta with coppa and taleggio cheese which was generous in portion and a nice mix of flavors. For the main courses the meatballs were tender, well seasoned and delicious. I had the sauteed sole with tomatoes, capers and olives served with spinach and mashed potatoes. The fish was cooked to perfection, moist and nicely complimented by the sauce. We ended with coffee and cappuccino, a complementary small plate of various cookies was also served. My desert of bread pudding was the only disappointment of the meal as it was served cold and was somewhat dry. It really needed a sauce to soak in to the pudding. The hazelnut ice cream , I love hazelnut, was very satisfying. What also makes this place rise above the rest is a very professionally trained staff that provided service as good as any Ive experienced. Professional and welcoming from waitstaff to busboy everyone did their job efficiently without being intrusive. Even the little touches such as refolding my friends napkin when she left momentarily  or making sure the water glass was refilled without being asked showed an awareness that a good restaurant is not just about the food but also about the service. There are plenty of times when you need to catch a quick meal to make a show thats the main criteria for restaurant choice.

The Mango A go-go might be a bit strong. As for the food, we had Tagliere di salumi con gnocco fritto, which my GF was crazy about. She also had Gnocchi di patate con tartufi neri, funghi misti e caprino, which she said was very filling and good. I had the Bistecca alla griglia marinata al limone, prezzemolo e aglio arrostito, which was steak. It was nice and juicy, flavors were great.

3.0,9/30/2012,"This is a lovely, interesting room with an ambitious menu. My greek salad was inventively presented in a ripe, decoratively carved yellow tomato. Had the stuffing been less tilted toward feta, and more toward flavorful and crunchy vegetables, it would have been better, and had the yogurt dressing been more discernible in flavor from the feta, that would also have been good. Some dill, perhaps. My grouper was a little salty when paired with a fairly salty vegetable side of fingerling potatoes, artichokes and olives, and the artichoke was tough. The fish was also a little drier than optimal. The fried green tomato side was perfectly done, however.The service could be more attentive.

We walked into the restaurant around 9.30pm and were greeted by the smiling owner. Since we didn't have a reservation and the restaurant was full- we were seated at the bar and offered a drink. We decided not to look at the drinks list, but asked the bartender to make something for us. He brought us the restaurant's signature drink called Etcetera Etcetera and it was simply delicious.By the time we were half the way through our drinks, our table was ready. As soon as we sat down, we were asked if we wanted something else to drink and the waiter was really helpful with wine recommendations.We were quickly served with a breadbasket containing different kinds of homemade focaccia and an olive tapenade. Even though it's meant to just calm down our hunger while we waited on our food, we had a really hard time not eating the whole thing- we did end up asking for an other round of focaccia!For appetizers we ordered the Fried Calamari (the tomato sauce that comes with it is amazing and we even ate it with the focaccia), the Insalata di Tonno was a great mix of hot and cold appetizer, and some vegetables to nibble on which I forgot what they are called.We were in the mood for pasta and chose the following:Casoncelli alla bergamasca -a kind of homemade ravioli filled with veal, raisins, bacon and sage- might sound as an odd combination but the mix of different tastes complemented each other amazingly.Sciallatielli con granchio e pepperoni arrostiti- half the way through her dish, my friend said that even though she might be full, there is no way she is leaving even half a speghetto on her plate.Tagliolini di spinaci all'aragosta- I could eat that every single day, so simple yet so tasty. I love the fact that everything we had is made fresh, using simple ingredients and tasted delicious.At this point the three of us could barely breathe, we were that full...but as girls often do, we decided that we could not leave without trying the desserts.Two chocolate lava cakes and a tiramisu later, it was clear that we would be back really, really soon!

My husband had the onion soup and the steak. All the dishes were very good. The pasta was very fresh and the  steak was cooked perfectly. The soup broth was very hearty and not too salty.

4.0,10/21/2011,"Original Review 2/24/11: We tried this place last night (in part based Yelp recommendations) and we were not disappointed.  We arrived early and sat at the bar waiting for our son to join us.  The bartender was very friendly and helpful with suggestions from the menu.  There were 9 wines available by the glass in the $9 to 10 range.  The Prosecco and the Malbec were both nice.  For dinner, the Caprese and pumpkin ravioli were good starters.  The casoncelli (veal, raisin and amaretto stuffed ravioli), the veal meatballs with EE French fries, and the meaty, falling-off-the-bone lamb shank were great entrees.  The wine list included numerous bottles in the $35 to 40 range, including a young Croze-Hermitage which we found excellent.  Coffee and cappuccino were good and came with complimentary cookies.  The profiteroles were just OK - would have been better with ice cream instead of the lemon cream filling.Update 10/21/11: Returned for a pre-theater dinner last night. This place is very nice!  The menu has a great selection of pastas and entrees -- so many good options it's hard to pick one.  Decor and service are excellent.  The $35 price fixed menu was a good value with mixed greens topped with thick parmigiano shavings, a succulent veal breast and delicious apple raisin tart for dessert. The Caprese is even better than we remembered and the pasta is available in two sizes, which is nice. We had a nice NZ Pinot Noir for about $40.

I must admit, I'm not a huge fan of lasagnas, as I think the fun in ordering a pasta dish is being able to twirl it to your hearts content, but this one was TASTY. The noodles weren't drenched with meat sauce, which was to my liking. After reading multiple Yelp reviews, I ordered the papardelle with lamb meatballs, which was also delicious.

4.0,5/11/2011,"Found this place while browsing restaurants in my neighborhood. It looked more upscale in the photos than in person. But I actually liked the decor very much. I'd describe it as an elegant modern motiff. (whatever that is)The food is pretty unique and innovative for an italian restaurant. It was refreshing in a way. As much as I love traditional italian places like Celeste, it's nice to change things up a bit and see someone experimenting a bit with italian flavors.I had the Tagliatelle pasta with mini lamb meatballs, oven dried tomatoes, arugula and Pecorino Romano. The meatballs were indeed tiny - they were slightly larger than a pea. I really liked the ribbon pasta texture. The flavoring was a nice balance between the sweetness of the tomatoes and the sourness of the pecorino.My friend had the Veal, raisin and amaretto filled ravioli with butter, pancetta and sage. Those flavors pair together wonderfully. Butter and sage are a godly combination and it wasn't surprising that I really enjoyed the raviolis.Can't wait to come back and try some more of the innovative dishes like the pasta made from red beets.",2,0,1,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",288,574,317
5.0,4/21/2011,"In a city bombarded with Italian food, how does someone choose? Well though I believe there are numerous amazing places to have authentic Italian in New York, Etcetera is definitely a favorite!When you walk in the atmosphere is fresh, new and modern but by the time you leave you will feel like part of an Italian family.  The pasta is made fresh in house as is the amazing bread served with the most amazing olive tampenade I have had since my aunt made hers from her very own olive trees!My favorite dishes? Gnocchi with truffle sauce (need I say more?) and the Scialatelli with crab meat and sweet roasted peppers.  Delizioso!!!!",0,0,0,Fatima F.,"Brooklyn, NY",185,23,1
3.0,4/15/2011,"Ok, they've got some innovative pastas here but the food is too pricey.  I came here last night (Thurs night) for an impromptu birthday celebration with my friend and her bf.  She picked the place, I guess not a bad pick for the growing trendiness happening in Hell's Kitchen (a laugh).  It is definitely trendy too- not your rustic, homey Italian joint (which I much prefer).  And what's up with that dopey name for a restaurant? Etc, etc? I don't know... but their food is just as passable as the etc. expression (alas I digress) Ok, so I sort of lied. The food is good but again, not for the value. We started off with a pretty decent bread basket ( I was hungry since I ate most of it ha)- cut up, cold/room temp foccacias, but some pretty awesome ground up olive spread. Me likey. Don't go for this if you don't like olives- it was salty.We looked at the menu, and I have to admit I didn't even look at the mains- because I'm all about the pasta!  My friend's bf did end up getting the snapper (not my favorite fish)- done very plain and simple. Minimal seasoning, steamed, with herbs- solo. I thought it was a plain dish but that's just me.  My gf and I got pasta and we had a tough time deciding. Our waiter recommended so many:-Orechiette-too boring for me-Gnocchi- what my friend got- she said she didn't like it; it was too heavy.  I thought they were a wee small. I like cream sauce and tons of cheese- so this I didn't mind. It was just ok though, not heavenly like the clouds of awesomeness at: Ciano, Dovetail (according to my friend), Uva, and Baccaro-Agnolotti- what I did get, it was different, something I never had before. It's a ravioli filled with beet puree and goat cheese (love that combo!), with crispy fried basil atop and shaving of parm cheese and pepper. -I asked about the papparedelle with duck ragout because this always interests me, but passed because the waiter didn't specifically say anything about it. I wanted this because I wanted meat, but of course duck ragout is never much meat.All pastas for full portions are $20 (appetizer portion is $12-13).  The portions were ok (not too meager)- regular, Italian style. We also ordered a quick app to share (sorry this is such a backwards reward)- the cured meats plate.  This was a little disappointing because it was only prosciutto, which is my least favorite meat and this wasn't stated on the menu.  It was fine though (not too fatty), but I much more enjoy soppresata.  The plate also came with some pickles, and weirdly, some puffed, deep fried wonton wrappers. Not sure how they fits.And we had some extraneous items- my friends a glass of wine each (I think?)  Malbec- it was nothing special.  They gave me a smaller, less formal red wine glass.  $9 a glass I believe.As for the server, he was a fun guy; energetic, timely and informative. The only weird thing is that he gave us the wine menu initially and didn't come back with the actual food menus until we asked for it, 10 minutes later.   We didn't ask for dessert (they had some interesting choices: hazelnut panna cotta, ricotta cheesecake, pumpkin creme brulee- a twist on all the classics. And the classics, such as tiramisu).  Our waiter brought out some customary cookie bites, and biscotti and other petit fours- it was really nothing too great. All in all, a decent pasta place but way too expensive. Total bill for 3 came to some $120. I am forever on the quest to conquer more Italian joints with homemade pastas, so I won't be returning.

3.0,2/8/2011,"This place has a decent atmosphere with acceptable service, but the food was rather mediocre to be honest. We ate here before a theatre engagement, and chose this restaurant because it was nearby. We ate off their special restaurant week three course menu for $35 and were rather underwhelmed. The seating was nice, they didn't crowd you, which is a nice change from many restaurants in the city. Reservations are recommended, especially on the weekends. I see many people raving about the bread here, I don't really understand why. The bread was COLD when they brought it to the table. Not room temperature, but COLD, like it had been in the refrigerator. This was kinda offputting especially when you expect bread to be warm when brought to the table. The focaccia slices were salty, the rustic bread was just ok. The black olive tapenade that they give is average (had much better at other local places) and with the saltiness of the olives combined with the saltiness of the focaccia, it was hard to eat. The salad I got offered a nice selection of baby greens, but the dressing was very bland and lacked a good balance of acid and fat. The cheese that they shave on top really doesn't fit the flavors of the salad, a shave of a parmesan or romano would fit better than what they used. The main courses were SMALL. Two of us decided to share two entrees to get a little variety. One was a braised beef dish served with roasted potatoes and broccoli. They gave you three tiny flourettes of brocolli (how generous), 4 quarters of baby red potatoes (equal to ONE baby potato) and two thin little shavings of beef (if there were 2oz of beef there I would be shocked). The sauce lacked flavor and definitely needed salt (which they don't provide to you on the table btw), the potatoes were ok but nothing special, the broccoli was over cooked and a bit soggy. The other dish we tried was roasted vegetables (eggplant, zuccini, squash, onion, etc...) with a red sauce over bow ties. The sauce tasted really bland and much like jarred sauce, and the ""roasted"" veggies were largely undercooked which made eating the dish unplesant. The star of the meal was by far the desserts. I tried a vanilla custard tart with pine nuts and it was quite good. The other dessert option was a trio of spumoni, gelato and sorbet. This was also quite good. They addtionally give you some home made biscotti and small confections which were perfect for dipping in some coffee or dessert wine. I think this was by far the best part of the meal.",0,0,0,Michelle M.,"Port Jefferson Station, NY",49,235,12

I am not sure but it was wonderful to mix the cool cheese into the hot pasta dish.  It melted and was so creamy.  Everybody else at the table seemed to enjoy their meal too.  My mom didn't order off the RW menu and instead had the basil pasta.  I have never seen anything like it before, but it was very tasty.  I would go back to have a whole plate of that.  The dessert was ok, but not a highlight.Oh, and their breadbasket was so good.  Definitely recommend.",0,0,0,Sarah G.,"Brooklyn, NY",48,204,3

Water was always filled to the brim and the breadbasket was constantly replaced.  When we asked for things, they were prompt and friendly. Food: Quite delicious.  We had lasagna, lamb shank, meatball, Cornish hen, and the pumpkin ravioli.  The lasagna was excellent - i believe it was veal - the perfect combination of cheese, sauce, noodles, and meat made my palate happy.  The lamb shank was falling off the bone tender.  I found it to be a little on the salty side but the bitter broc rabe balanced it out pretty well.  the ravioli was very ""pumpkin""-y.  The sauce was a bit salty but the filling was not.  Candied/dried fruit garnish was the most memorable thing on the dish - I think this was the weakest dish we had at our table.  The cornish hen with roasted potatoes and zucchini was cooked just right.  The meat ball dish - does not come with pasta but with a side of rosemary french fries - was quite interesting.  It is a bowlful of meatballs - and literally meatballs in marinara. Surprisingly, though, the meatballs were juicy and delicious.We ordered 3 appetizers: salmon tartar, a meat sampler dish with puff pastry, and prosciutto and melon.  The tartar was by far the best appetizer - bits of salmon and avocado with a hint of salt and acid (forget what it was...lemon?) - and the meat dishes were not that memorable - maybe because i'm not a fan of cured meats.Ambiance: Romantic and quiet - but kind of small.

Anyways, my dining experience at Etc Etc came out of a dire need to eat dinner with my friends before deciding to wait in line for SNL tickets. We quickly researched on Yelp, and found this place. Etc Etc is a mixed bag. The staff is friendly, but the service I go was lackluster. I made a reservation at 8:30PM and my party arrived a bit early. It was pretty packed and they told us that they would have us seated by our reserved time. Cool, except it didn't happen. We waited another 45 minutes to get seated, which doesn't earn many points in my book. Even the manager seemed stressed out about it; my friend pointed out that he was pulling at his hair after the hostess told him that we've been waiting. The food is a mix of good and bad as well. I ordered a pasta dish, which was pretty good except it did not in any way justify its price tag. My friends all got this fried chicken filet with mixed greens on top. They also complimented the dish, but for some fried piece of meat and salad, again, not worth the price. The best part of the meal was the free dessert tray they gave us at the end. It was a mix of small pastries and chocolates, both were quite delicious. The bread tray they give you before your meal is also good, with a good assortment of different breads. The interior, however, was quite nice. Well decorated and aptly lighted, the dining area presented itself as simple and sophisticated. It created a great casual atmosphere that can be fully appreciated when dining with a very small group of friends.

I accepted.When we got there, they had combined a bunch of rectangular tables and a round one (so it looked like a thermometer! or....). We were pretty squished, but the host was so gracious with us completely blockading the kitchen. Our waiter handled us wonderfully (wine/champagne quickly served, orders quickly taken and delivered).

Are you one of those people who likes EVERYTHING?Server: No, I'm actually a picky eater. Wait, there is something on the menu I DON'T like. I don't like the baby octopus salad.Not knowing what to order because you want to order everything: I guess it's a good problem to have, right? We ended up ordering from the prix fixe Restaurant Week menu. Appetizer, full-sized entree, and dessert = $35. Not bad at all. And we didn't order the baby octopus salad.Staff was friendly and accommodating (it took us forever to decide what we wanted to eat).The salad I ordered was your standard salad - nothing to scream about, but not terrible. Squid ink linguine with seafood was interesting! The pasta was homemade (yum), and the dish as a whole was very flavorful without being overpowering. The basil was a nice touch. The sorbet was the more boring of the dessert choices, but I got three scoops - lemon, berry, mandarin - and they were pretty good. I liked finding chunks of berries in the middle of my (berry, obviously) scoop.My friend ordered the barley and lentil soup - nothing to scream about. The pork scaloppini was tender and cooked just right. Her dessert, strawberries with balsamic vinegar compote with yogurt semifreddo, was really interesting. I didn't order it because I don't like yogurt. Turns out I'm not too crazy about balsamic vinegar on my strawberries either, but to each his own.If I go back, I might have to try one of their signature cocktails (moderately priced at ~$11), or have a beer, if anything ($5!).

We actually ordered a risotto special as another starter, and the perfectly prepared risotto was just wonderful in its simplicity and flavors- quite a surprise.  Things only got better -my simple rosemary roast chicken/roast potato dish and my companion's ravioli special were both fantastic.  Although my chicken dish was very simple, it was seasoned perfectly, roasted exactly right and with a little touch of citrus it truly transported me to an evening out we had in Rome.  Although I thought we ordered the mushroom ravioli, I believe we ended up with a goat cheese ravioli special - which was again simple, but so tasty.  Based on the two specials and our fabulous waiter who was so friendly (and we could see he was being as friendly to all the other customers) - we will return.",0,0,0,Matars Z.,"Rockville, MD",0,79,0

Usually the next step after a no thank you to desser is the check...waited about another 15 minutes for that.  Gave him my amex and after he ran it he came back and told me he just heard about my entree and the only thing he could do was take my husbands 5 dollar beer off.  i told him, "" you never even checked on us or offer me anything else.  he said come back again, request him as a waiter, and he'll take care of me.  Oh really?  As good as he did this time?  There will never be a next time.  There are too many places in NYC that can make a martini and have good bread to deal with that crap!!",4,0,0,Merry L.,"San Diego, CA",79,139,3

My friend and I have not seen in each other in quite some time, so after we ordered we were engrossed in conversation.  I kept thinking that the salad was taking too long but did not want to interrupt my friend while she was speaking so I did not say anything.

I ordered the chocolate mousse and a whiskey beverage (can't remember the name!!) while the lady had sorbet and a Malbec.Now, here's the thing. It was alright. The mousse was very tasty, but it was rather small for $10 and had pretty-looking-but-not-much-else extras like a raspberry coulis zig-zag barely thick enough to taste. The cocktail was a little weak and not as tangy as I had hoped, and the mood was rather spoiled by extremely loud mini-skirters on the adjacent table.It was an 'if only' place for me.

3.0,6/29/2008,"Midtown scares me.  Primarily, I am afraid that the throngs of tourists wearing foam statute of liberty crowns are going to go crazy when they can't get the best view of the flute band.  Sadly, the rest of my family seems to be petrified that they will be attacked by roving bands of kids on skateboards if they venture below 14th Street, so we're kind of at an impasse.  I lost this time.We went to this place, it seemed kind of sleek and hip based on the pictures.  It was for the most part, but all the sleekness and hipness was definitely made of cheap plastic.  My meal was up to par, but apparently there was a fish plate that didn't really cut it.  So, there was a discussion with the waiter who told us that the ""chef was in a hurry to get out"", which, even if your customers are acting more than unreasonably, is not the best excuse you should be able to come up with.  Granted, it was pretty late, but if you're going to take reservation at 10pm, you should be prepared to serve quality food at 10pm.I'm giving it three stars because my steak was great.  This place is nothing to worry about, as long as the chef doesn't have a date.",2,2,1,Matthew N.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,56,0
4.0,4/2/2007,"Excellent food and excellent service.  I set my expectations pretty low for any restaurant in the theater district, so I was especially surprised and happy to have such a good experience at Etcetera Etcetera.  Everything we ordered was delicious, but the veal ravioli was the real stand out of the night.  The atmoshere is trendy and sleek - a great place for a date or a night out with friends.",3,0,2,Amanda W.,"San Francisco, CA",3,15,0
5.0,4/1/2007,"Etc Etc is AMAZING!  This is the perfect place to drop by for ""Bar Bites"" ranging in price from $6-$12 pre-theatre,  just for cocktails and delicious rosemary breadsticks, or for amazing authentic northern Italian cooking.  They also have a 2nd floor event space that can be reserved for groups of 20+ (my birthday) or the entire floor for a seated dinner of 100 (my wedding reception)Don't miss dropping in for a terrific signature cocktail or their new amazing weekend brunch!",3,0,0,Benjamin M.,"NY, NY",316,31,9
1.0,1/31/2007,"I'm really surprised at the previous reviews.  This may be one of the least memorable dining experiences I've had in NY (and I've been here for 7yrs.)  Went here for my birthday and every single person had at best, mediocre dishes.  One friend of mine commented that he felt angry that places like this manage to survive in Manhattan.  The shrimp brochette is very basic (tho' the pic on the website looked lovely.)  The only decent app that was ordered was the melon w/ proscuitto and dates... and by decent I mean it didn't suck.  Even that dish wasn't anything special.  As for the veal raviolis w/ pancetta, I can only say `wow'.  Terribly dry and grainy on the inside, like coarse sand.  No sauce.  Just loads of pancetta dumped on top.  Pancetta may be heaven-sent, but on this dish all you taste is salt.  The whole dish could be summarized by `sea salt over dough w/ sand'.  The salmon was dry, served w/ two pathetic florets of broccoli and the most basic mash.  The pasta dishes tasted like they were made by a freshman college student.  Perhaps I'd be more forgiving if the bill didn't come to $70 per person (not even with desert.)  I could go on and on.. but I won't bore you anymore.  This place is just shocking. SHOCKING!  Don't go.",2,2,0,Jes S.,"New York, NY",6,16,0
5.0,5/22/2006,"I am so psyched that my 100th review gets to be for Etcetera Etcetera as it's one of my favorite little places in the city.  Too often overshadowed by it's big sister Vice Versa (yelp.com/biz/v1M1HIQBVwY…), Etcetera Etcetera is a sleek yet cozy little place in HK with an inspired menu of deliciously reinvented American standards, and a friendly, acommodating staff.  I had a small gathering here last year, and they could not have been more wonderful - even gave us trays of free appetizers!  Go here and enjoy!",6,0,3,Sam P.,"New York, NY",1869,875,636
