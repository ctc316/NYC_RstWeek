4.0,4/20/2019,"Small Steakhouse in an out of the way part of Astoria(near Triborough  Bridge). Great service very attentive went with a group for  birthday. Steaks were great service wonderful. Nice to go to a neighborhood steakhouse. Also the wine list is cleverly put together, with a nice selection of affordable wines that compliment the steak.

5.0,4/15/2019,"This restaurant is one my favs. I think the food is great but its the service that's impeccable and makes you come back every time.  I know this is a reach but I might even pass on one of the weller known steakhouses like Peter Lugers just because you are not treated like just another paying customer but with so much respect and attention to detail is just insane here.  When i come into the restaurant by myself on one my ""me nights"" they remember when i have my wine (when the main meal comes out) to what I order and to even knowing i may want a charger for my iphone!  Sometimes i may not come in months and the owner remembers.  You truly feel part of the family here and the Sinatra music only enhances the mood here!",0,0,0,Noel G.,"New York, NY",1,3,3

3.0,4/7/2019,"Well this was our second time going to Meet the Meat. We showed up on time for our reservation that we changed to an earlier time. The bar was full of guys drinking and being loud...very loud. When we were finally seated 10 minutes after arriving we were greeted by our waiter and the owner once again. His hospitality skills are second to none. That's the truth. We went with the Canadian Bacon and Shrimp Cocktail starters and while the shrimp was great, the bacon had a LOT of gristle. For a bacon app in a restaurant like this to be full of gristle...we were shocked. Then we went with the Tomahawk Ribeye for two, creamed spinach, and mushrooms. The steak was a tad overdone, but it's to be expected I guess with a piece of meat that big...but the killer was that it was very underseasoned.  That too wasn't expected. While the meat was tender...again, the trimming could have been better because the amount of un-rendered fat was a disappointment. Especially for a $100 cut of beef. The creamed spinach was fantastic as were the mushrooms. Dessert was the NY Cheesecake and the Chocolate Mousse. Both were absolutely fantastic and the star of the meal. Yes, dessert was the star of the meal at a STEAKHOUSE...All in all, it was an OK night...but I'm afraid we won't be going back anytime soon.",0,0,0,Steve A.,"Middle Village, NY",10,34,7
4.0,4/5/2019,"My sisters and I were having a spa day and then were trying to last minute find a good place nearby before driving back to PA. We found this little spot on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Cute little spot and the name was kind of deceiving. Inside it is a small intimate white table cloth restaurant with a little homey feel. The server came right over and took good care of us. We tried the Caesar salad which was the only part of the meal I didn't like. It was really fishy tasting. We got three slices of the Canadian bacon... definitely a must try! It was amazing. Then we tried the French onion which was possibly the best French onion I ever had. Then we shared the bone in ribeye and ny prime sirloin. We asked for medium but it was alittle on the rare side for us and they had no problem upcooking it. The bourdeglais sauce was out of this world, both steaks had so much incredible flavor! Then all the sides were fantastic. Fries, hashbrowns, broccoli rabe and mushrooms. Everything was super hot which is how I like my food. Lately we paid and then checked the bill. They added two extra wines to our bill. They acted likes it was a problem to fix when quite frankly we were upset they were trying to add two extra drinks to our bill that we didn't order. That kinda stinks to end such a fabulous meal on that note. However I have to say what a pleasant surprise. If your in the area, do try!",0,0,0,Candice S.,"Easton, PA",6,74,114

4.0,2/25/2019,"Third time here, I guess it's time to finally write a review. A small establishment with great steak and sides. They are kid friendly which is a plus but they don't offer any kid items on the menu. Just have them share with you would be the best bet unless you're eating medium rare steak like I was and had to order my toddler a burger with fries but the burger was super well done and dry. She only ate very little of it, probably should order a medium burger.  We were able to snag a table of 9 on a Sunday night through opentable the morning of which was great. When we arrived the table was already set up for us in the middle of the restaurant. What we ordered: Canadian bacon slab, mussels, crab cake, potato hash, steak medallions, bone in ribeye, branzino, cheeseburger, burger, vegetable platter, Mac and cheese, broccoli, Brussels sprouts and creamed spinach. Mussels appetizer was what my friend raves about so when we all tried it we loved it. I don't eat mussels but that sauce was so good. We had to order more bread just to finish the last drop of the sauce from the plate. The crab cakes I didn't try but everyone else said it was pretty good. The bacon slab was alright, can't compare to the one at Peter Lugers. Everyone but the kids loved their entrees. The burgers were a bit dry when we asked for a medium well but came out as well done. The ribeye was cooked to perfection, a medium rare for me and it was so big I had to take half of it home. Branzino was good, vegetable platter was huge for my vegetarian friend but she liked it and she had to take it home. The steak medallions were good my friend ate it all. My favorite side was the Mac and cheese and Brussels sprouts. Very flavorful. My friends toddler loved the creamed spinach. The broccoli was watery and nothing to write home about. The potato hash was good and had the caramelized potato skin pieces in it. Highly recommend this place for any special occasion or when you just want some steak. If you bring a cake in just know that there is a $30 cake cutting fee which we did not know about at all.  There's street parking here and sometimes you have to drive around a few times to find a spot. If you have reservations I suggest coming a little earlier to find parking.",1,0,1,Francine Y.,"Queens, NY",145,282,1669

5.0,2/16/2019,"Once again, Yelpers came through when searching for a steakhouse just outside of Manhattan.

I was a bit embarrassed to take pictures of the food but let me tell you what I had to eat. For appetizers we had grilled scallops and crab cakes....absolutely delicious!!! And I had medallions with the mashed potatoes and my husband had the filet mignon with asparagus and mashed potatoes.

4.0,1/27/2019,"First of all I was scared that I wouldn't find parking, but this is near a residential area and so it was not bad at all.  There is a patio, where i'm sure during the summer has outdoor seating.  The ambiance is very nice great for apecial occasions. Servers were great. Food was good except 1 thing, we ordered scallops and there were only 3 pieces! We ordered grilled octopus, which was real good, was not overcooked and cooked perfectly.  It is restaraunt week and so we had the pre fixe menu, which included an appetizer, entree, and dessert. My boyfriend ordered the NY strip, and my bff and I ordered the filet mignon. They cooked the steaks as we ordered. Overall our experience was great, just those darn scallops. Oh and I almost forgot, we also ordered the scallops and octopus seperately. They are not part of the pre fixe menu. The steaks came with mashed and a very small side id green beans and so I ordered the creamed spinach, which was awesome.",1,0,0,Cathrine S.,"Bellerose, NY",357,17,18
5.0,1/27/2019,"Came here with my boyfriend for restaurant week. The ratings are true. The service was great and the food was delicious. For appetizers, we had the sautéed mussels, meatballs, and blue point oysters. I love how the tomato sauce and meatballs tasted homemade - the meatball had this amazing crunch on the outside and the inside was juicy and tender. The sautéed mussels paired nicely with the tomato sauce. I didn't eat the oysters but my boyfriend said the blue point oysters tasted fresh. For entrees, we had the NY strip steak and filet mignon. Both entrees come with mashed potatoes and green beans/carrots. The steaks were cooked correctly and seasoned nicely. Not too salty! Mashed potatoes taste homemade, I loved the potato bits in the mash. Green beans/carrots had a nice vinaigrette on them. For dessert, we had the cheesecake and chocolate mousse cake. I loved the cheesecake, tasty graham cracker bottom. The chocolate mousse cake was a bit too sweet for my palate but it may have been because I was so full hahah. Service is great, everyone is so friendly and attentive. I would definitely come back and recommend this place to friends and family!",0,0,1,Victoria L.,"New York, NY",11,42,22

5.0,1/14/2019,"I can't say enough good things about this place.  My boyfriend and I initially came here because I got one of those yelp emails talking about restaurants in Queens.  We were not disappointed.  I lived in Astoria for 8 years and would typically go to Manhattan if I wanted a steak.  I no longer have to do that.  Meet the Meat has a cozy atmosphere and the owner makes us feel right at home. I loved the background music and just the whole vibe of the place. We have been back 2 times since and were greeted like family.  Our favorite server, AK, always remembers us and what wine we like to order.  The whole staff is knowledgeable about the menu, the cocktails are on point, and the food is excellent.  We love this place and want to eventually try everything on the menu.  For starters, the Smoked Salmon, Blue Point Oysters, and Grilled Octopus are all solid choices for an appetizer.   The Bone-In Ribeye was delicious but my new death row meal is their Prime Sirloin.  It was perfectly charred on the outside and the right amount of pink on the inside. The flavor was incredible.  I enjoyed the truffle fries as a side along with the creamed spinach.  The cheesecake did not disappoint for dessert.  Their wine menu is reasonable.  This is my new go to spot for an overall great dining experience.",0,0,0,Marianne L.,"New York, NY",5,7,0

I had never heard of this place despite being an Astoria resident, but it delivered. Look, it's not Peter Luger's, and I didn't expect it to be, but you can get a damn good steak here. We shared the grilled calamari appetizer, each got a French onion soup, and split a prime sirloin with a side of creamed spinach. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare of course), and once we added a dash of salt it was excellent. The creamed spinach was by far the highlight - you won't be sorry.

2.0,12/29/2018,"This diminutive​ restaurant in Astoria, Queens, houses a steakhouse​ that can have tremendous potential.​ Upon entering, you are immediately greeted by a Maitre d who quickly escorts you to the table. During our visit, a small party of about 10 were seated and enjoying their time denoted by laughter and cheer.  Including that boisterous table, there appeared to be two other tables that were occupied.  Once seated, I noticed about 3 other tables that were not seated and that's it in total, as far as the available seating in​ this sparse area.  Incidentally​, the restaurant is contained within a small mini-mall just feet away from​ Ricardo's Caterers near the Tri-boro bridge.My dinner guest and I​ started with appetizer's of raw oysters which were fresh but small as well as the scallops which were excellently cooked but needed a pinch of seasoning to compliment this seafood. To balance our palate, we shared a bottle of Robert Mondavi Cabernet to accompany the expectant king of red meats. As a self-proclaimed carnivore​ with the former Ben Benson's, Smith and Wollenski's, Gallagher's, and Peter Lugar's as well as many others under my belt, I stand to​ believe that I am a fair critique of red meat purveyors. With that in mind, I was disappointed with the quality of meat served.  While the service was outstanding from the very beginning until the very end of dinner, the Porterhouse which was ordered medium rare, needed a strong blast of intensified heat that most steakhouses have, in order to infuse a crispy​ char on the outer layer of this steak. Our steak this evening​ was presented with an anemic​ and pale outer layer that reminded me of a diabetic end-stage​ foot that needed to be amputated. My guess is that we arrived on the latter part of the evening and thus, the restaurant had to thaw out the frozen meat by unconventional means resulting in the inability to achieve​ a char.  If this was the case, the restaurant's management had an obligation to ""86"" this dish and consider advising on an alternate dish. Unfortunately, neither was considered and we were left with this bad first impression resulting in the pilfering of $85.00 from my coffers and a total of 250 including tip, for my ticket outta there. The steam spinach was a no-brainer​ and the creamed spinach was a smooth and delicious finish.In retrospect, I have mixed feelings for this place. While the service was undeniably very good, the name of this restaurant is not a barometer nor a guide where great steaks come from.  Instead, it is named after a forum where vascular surgeons discard their remnants after a days work.",2,5,0,Larry L.,"Bronx, NY",25,36,67

4.0,10/3/2018,"Located in what feels like a far away from the hustle and bustle part of Astoria, Meet the Meat is a little steak oasis.

4.0,8/15/2018,"Came here for dinner, and ordered off the restaurant week menu. This is one of two places in Queens that offers Restaurant Week for Summer 2018. The restaurant is rather small with no more than 10 tables in the dining room, some outdoor seating in the front patio, and seating at their full bar.We started with the crab cakes and mussels. The crab cakes and mussels were both tiny portions. Neither of the appetizers were particularly impressive. For the entree, we both ordered the strip steak - medium rare. The steaks came out a little more on the medium side, but since they were so nicely flavored/charred, it didn't bother us too much. The steaks were served with a small portion of mashed potatoes and green beans/carrots. We also ordered a side of creamed spinach. The creamed spinach was a little mushy for my liking - the texture of the spinach wasn't there, it was more of a puree texture. We paired our meal with a glass of red wine, and ended our meal with the tiramisu and NY style cheesecake - both of which was good, but we were way too full to finish it. Service here was great - our waiter was very attentive.

My nieces had the burger and fries which they shared. We didn't have high expectations but all our meals were excellent. My NY strip steak was a  perfect medium rare. It was well-seasoned, juicy, and full of beef flavor. My husband had the fillet mignon which was tender, medium rare, and also flavorful. I was told that the lamb chops and salmon were also delicious. The side dishes were weak. The mash  potatoes was nicely  presented but bland. The green beans were  blanched and not seasoned. The appetizers were good but not great. The desserts were also just good.Overall the meat was terrific and this is one of the few places I would go back without it being restaurant week.",2,2,1,Angela L.,"Queens, Queens, NY",2,96,23
3.0,8/12/2018,"I came here with my family for restaurant week. We ended up having three members order off the restaurant week menu and shared our dishes. We had the mussels, crab cake and the half clams as our apps. I enjoyed the fresh calms and crab cake. Mussels will be in a tomato base soup. For our entrees, we had the NY steak, filet mignon, and lamb chops, off menu chicken parmigiana. My lambs were not very well seasoned but cooked to my liking. The two steaks were seared well but nothing amazing in flavor. Our entrees came with a spoonful of mash potatoes and some green beans. The dessert was probably the best part! We tried all three chocolate mousse, tiramisu, and cheese cake. The mousse was very rich and sweet, tiramisu was my favorite due to its taste and texture, and the cheese cake was a bit dense but good as well. Only tried this place for the restaurant week appeal but won't be dining here again.Service was impeccable. They were always attentive and quick service.

My lamb chops were perfect(tender juicy and flavorful without being overly seasoned). My husband enjoyed his filet mignon. The manager and (I'm assuming) his wife were very personable and sweet when my baby got a little rowdy.

I wish I could say I loved it, but it fell so short of the amazing steakhouses in NYC.I came here with my girlfriend and out two friends for restaurant week. We all ordered off the restaurant week menu and then we got a bunch of sides to share. We got crab cakes and buffalo mozzarella for appetizers. Both were nothing special. The crab cakes were just little, dry, hockey pucks. For our entree, we all ordered filet mignon. They were all fatty and none of them were cooked to the temperature we ordered. It came with mashed potatoes and green beans, which were fine just tiny portions. On the side, we ordered creamed spinach (worse than green giant), onion rings (burnt), and Mac and cheese (tasted like boxed.) Dessert was fine. We got cheesecake and tiramisu. Again, nothing special. It tasted like what you would buy from the bakery at the supermarket.

I feel really bad for giving 3 stars because hes such a nice guy. However the service is kinda slow. They only have a few servers, and they were all helpful and polite, but again the service was slow.

4.0,8/1/2018,"When my GF told me about restaurant week I decided to look in my own backyard of Astoria...Yes Manhattan has all the good stops for this event, but I work there almost every day of the week and it's nice to be in your own apt after a good meal and not have to battle with the MTA....that's a review that's been told too many times. Anyway Astoria had only two choices so we went with the steak house over Italian.Born and raised in NYC you know a few things about steak houses. 1- although Brooklyn claims to have the best I still have to lean towards Manhattan for a true Steak House experience and 2- have you ever been to Keens chop house? If you have enough said.So with that I always keep an open mind when I'm outside of my Steak House comfort zone.  Meet the Meat did not disappoint, I ordered the Bone in NY Strip Steak cooked medium (anything else and your just wasting tour time with beef) and my GF was really excited about the lamb chops. As sides I had the mushroom Mac and cheese and my girl mashed potatoes with steamed spinach. The cook was spot on, my steak full and juicy and the lamb was smooth and full of flavor. Our sides didn't let us down either. Now just so you know we went for the prixe fix but ordered from the regular menu. All told with two glasses of wine three beers and no desert the bill with tip was a little steep $176.00. the staff was amazingly attentive and the cooks were excellent.

3.0,7/29/2018,"I ate here the other night with my son since this restaurant offers a restaurant week menu.  I have never participated in any of these promotions since I'm of the mind that you usually get what you pay for and that was pretty much the case at Meet the Meat.  We were given some bread that was ok  and we started  with the mussel and crab cake appetizers. The mussels were  decent at best  but the sauce was a joke. It was accompanied by  a very bland and uninspiring Italian tomato sauce that tasted like it came from a jar.   To be honest I really couldn't believe it. The crab cakes tasted pretty good and came with a  good mayo based dipping sauce . The problem was even though it tasted good where was the crab ? I have had many crab cakes in my time but we could not find any pieces of crab in the cakes and certainly no chunks . It looks like they  pureed a small amount of crab  into the mixture and it was hard to discern much taste from the crab. We ordered the strip steak (  about 10 oz) and the rib lamb chops ( 4 of them , both entrees were ordered med rare). These came with a small ice cream scoop portion of mashed potatoes and a few string beans with some shredded carrot on top .  The steak and chops were done rare but we didn't have a problem with it since they tasted good but certainly not in the same league as some  of the better Manhattan steakhouses as some yelpers  have claimed. We ordered two bottles of wine from their very reasonably priced list . You rarely if ever find decent wine prices in NYC steakhouses so that' is a definite plus when dining here . We finished with the chocolate mouse and cheesecake . The cheesecake was very good and the mousse cake was excellent.To sum it up this is a decent steakhouse option if you don't want to go to the city and pay allot more but as I pointed out before you usually get what you pay for  and  again that was the case at this establishment. Perhaps their regular menu is better but in the future  I will  opt to pay more and eat at the better steakhouses in Manhattan. Total cost with 20 % tip = $185.PS: The service was excellent !",0,0,0,William O.,"Astoria, NY",0,22,7
5.0,7/27/2018,"Very inaccessible if you don't own a car like myself but still very much worth the trek . Ordered off restaurant week menu as their options were a lot more extensive than any other I saw . I'd start with my most disappointing part of my meal which was the appetizer . Not a deal breaker but the Buffalo mozzarella cheese on top of two triangularly sliced tomatoes was not very appetizing . My fault though for choosing it as I didn't have much outside of numerous shellfish options which I don't eat.  It was immediately forgotten though with the filet mignon and lamb chop entrees . The filet mignon was some of the best steak I've ever had . Ordered it well done but it was exceptionally juicy and tender . Likewise with the lamb chop as the wife practically started eating the lamb bones when she ran out of meat. Both entrees had very healthy portions of meat to begin with and included  overly plated mashed potato and a bed of asparagus and shaved carrots .  The deserts well , it wasn't my favorite but they were good . The tiramisu was surely the better option when compared against the cheesecake . Multi layers of flavors and enough of a subtle crunch without being too sweet . Overall , serving some of the best meat I've had warrants a 5 star but it was surely aided with great service from the five or so fellow staffers as well and very fair pricing . Will definitely do the long trek again to sample more of their menu .",4,1,0,Kern C.,"Brooklyn, NY",48,247,51

4.0,6/3/2018,"Just another night out for dinner and fell on this gem right in Astoria. The name ""'meet the meat"" left me to believe it was a butcher shop. We started off the crab cakes which weren't all that great. They accompany the cakes with tartar sauce which isn't my favorite and also the cakes weren't lumpy enough. The cocktails met my standards I got the lemon drop with tequila which definitely hit the spot. When the steak for two came out(which we got medium) I was shocked at how tasteful it was. I was on the edge as every place doesn't make the steak the same. I will say that they make a better steak then a lot of these big name steak houses out there( won't mention any names). Service was great from beginning to the end. Manager checked on us several times to make sure we were taken care of.

The server didn't present a bottled wine list, only by the glass...Then we ordered the scallops. They were ok. Admittedly they were slightly on the overcooked side because they made that rubbery squeak sound when we chewed them.Then we ordered the steak for 2 ($82), when it came out the second time it was delicious. Unfortunately initially we had to send the steak back. We ordered it cooked ""medium rare"" and we got it with parts cooked to preference, some cooked medium, and one side cooked well done. (The meat was grey). Now typically, I would NEVER send food back, but at a restaurant that prides itself on being a $$$ steakhouse, there is no excuse, especially for the price.Overall, the experience was good, and perhaps I'd even try it again to see if we can get a better experience. Now, I know this is nit picky, but I wish they were a little more detailed.

We also ordered a Texas mule and a lemon drop martini. The drinks were quite refreshing and on the sweeter side which I much prefer.  We were not that thrilled with the scallops. For me the flavor was not that great and it lacked that sweetness that scallops could have. They were well cooked though, it wasn't rubbery at all. The porterhouse we ordered to be Cooked medium came out juicy and well seasoned. The vegetables were good and paired nicely with the steak.

Our waiter was so attentive and I swear before we could finish our sentence for something that we needed, it was ALREADY on the table that's how quick things were coming to the table. I ordered off the restaurant week menu, which was fantastic! I had the NY strip which was Hands down the BEST steak I had. Cooked to the absolute perfection. My mom had the Prime rib and my Sister in law  and husband had the salmon. Everything was cooked well. Sides were also good Mash potatoes, broccoli and asparagus. Oh! And the drinks, were made well.

5.0,2/8/2018,"Let me start off by saying this restaurant delivers one of the best service I had ever received.  The moment my boyfriend and I walked in, we were seated immediately. We already knew we wanted the Porterhouse for two, side of cream spinach and red wine. The porterhouse was delicious, cooked to medium rare, rich and savory. Paired with the red wine, the combination was heavenly. Our server was extremely accommodating, made sure we were happy. The manager or owner I believed made our dinner night very special. He truly knows the meaning of service, we had a wonderful talk about hospitality service and commend his liquor selection, because it was one of the reason we dined in. I want to give him special thanks for a wonderful evening, and definitely will be coming back.",4,0,1,Victoria Q.,"Queens, NY",296,47,35

Adnan, the owner, met us at the front door, confirmed our reservation, and seated us at a table with a window view. Pavel was our server and made helpful suggestions about wine to accompany our meal. My husband had crab cakes which were flavorful and full of crab rather than fillers. I had very fresh buffalo mozzarella with tomato and basil. My husband liked his filet and my strip steak was cooked perfectly. The vegetable accompaniment was small and mashed potatoes were not hot but the extra Brussels sprouts were fabulous.

2.0,1/31/2018,"Let me start by saying I was going to give this place a 4 star review. My wife and I went and split the french onion soup, crab cakes, the filet with mashed potatoes and green beans and the chocolate mousse cake for desert. The service was very good when we were there. The French onion soup was excellent. The bread was good. The crab cakes were good (not exceptional but i enjoyed them.  The filet was good, but not exceptional as well. It was cooked perfectly to medium rare and the was just a little char that added some flavor. The taste was good and juicy but compared to other high end steakhouses (which to be fair are a little more expensive) it was just a bit lower on the overall flavor. It tasted good but could have used just a little bit of seasoning/marinade even just a bit of salt and pepper. I also enjoyed the chocolate mousse cake which was very good. So overall I would rate this place 4 stars. However, my wife wrote a review of this place. She gave them a 3 star because she agreed the steak could have used a bit more seasoning which I would say was a but harsh because the food was good and the service was very good but its her opinion. Overall her comments were not that bad. The owner responded like Donald Trump! He got defensive and insulted my wife. Not very professional at all... Therefore I dropped my review to 2 stars (And should probably go to 1)",2,1,1,Jon C.,"Brooklyn, NY",209,219,186

They tried there best I must say but they need to have more servers.

We got a mixture of sides. The mash was perfect. The broccoli was great, maybe a little on the hard side, but still great. The onion rings were tasty.

We had the steak sandwich which was pretty good but it had too much sauce for  my daughter's taste. Also no side dish came with the 15 dollars sandwich which I thought was a little stingy. We also had the prime rib with the bone which was very good but too thin for 40+ dollars. The cheeseburger wasn't that great, Bareburger is better.

It's tucked into a quiet part of Astoria but once your inside you feel like you are in a fancy Manhattan restaurant. We had a reservation and were promptly seated. There were a few full tables and family outside. Throughout the evening we were attended to promptly by the waitress and the owner, which I think is a nice change of pace. They were sincerely friendly and answered any questions that we had. We ordered the RW menu and were able to supplement with additional items that weren't included. All of the food was delicious. We ordered filet mignons which came with a side of mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and some salads. Everything was flavorful and portioned perfectly. Of course there was a bread basket which was good but not the best I've had. It was pretty generic Italian bread.

So unappealing to look at. Also services with a vinaigrette that was described as being Italian but was instead a heavy mustard base.Only steakhouse that I know of that doesn't offer a Ceasar salad. Paco, perhaps the second waiter ever to earn less than my standard 22% tip. Bad service can make or break your entire dinning experience...no question he broke ours.Garlic mash potatoes that had no flavor and was very dense.Creamed spinach had plenty of nutmeg but lacked a little creaminess.Coffee was good but a bit on the weak side.There are too many good steakhouses to ever consider coming back.",1,2,0,Pauline C.,"West Palm Beach, FL",98,196,179
3.0,8/18/2017,"Rating: 2.5 stars The food was very average to me. I know a lot of cheaper restaurants that have amazing food and this place didn't really wow me. For appetizers, I got the Sautéed Mussels and Buffalo Mozzarella. The sauce for the mussels was pretty good, but the mussels looked shriveled up and was tiny. The Buffalo Mozzarella was decent and I didn't really have any complaints. For entrees, I got the Filet Mignon and Lamb chops. The Filet Mignon was kind of dry and flavorless even though we asked for medium rare. In fact, we had to put more salt on it for flavor. However, the Lamb chops were juicy and delicious. Lastly, for dessert I got the Tiramisu and Cheesecake. Both were on the sweeter side, but I think I would suggest the Tiramisu since it wasn't too sweet. The service at this establishment was superb! The waiter came over to check up on us and was extremely attentive. The main reason why I only gave it a 2.5 star was because there was a tiny fly in my water. This was a major turnoff.

5.0,7/31/2017,I came here for restaurant week with two friends and everything was excellent. Since one of my friends was running late we sat at the bar and enjoyed a MTM martini (passion fruit). This drink was delicious however a little weak in the alcohol content for my taste but still so tasty I had two while we waited.Once we were seated I tried not to eat too much of the fresh bread since I wanted to have plenty of space for my meal. I started with the crab cakes which were tasty and they give you two which I found very generous. As my entrée I went with the filet mignon which was cooked to perfection with a side of mash potatoes and green beans. Everything was cooked and seasoned wonderfully.I was stuffed by this point but I had to try the cheesecake since I feel its a staple at a steakhouse. However I wasn't impressed by my dessert and I did enjoyed the chocolate cake and tiramisu that my friends ordered more.Apart from the great food one thing that stood out about this place was the service.

The creamed spinach was light and creamy, not overly rich like some of the other places make it. And the potato hash was a great pairing to the meal.

4.0,6/19/2017,"I'm all for steak at steakhouse but getting a little tired of the typical BIG NAME shops like Lugers, Wolfgang and the like. So for Father's Day Dinner we decided to try something off the beaten path in Astoria. Enter Meet The Meat! While we have been discovering a lot of good restaurants in Astoria, MTM is a nice addition to our growing list of LIKES! Living proof that a good steak meal and good wine does not have to break the bank. We started off with some warm bread. I always have to give restaurants with warm bread an extra thumbs up for putting in the effort to warm up their bread! Warm bread always beats out the cold hard bread baskets that some big name shops (I will not name names) fail to do!  We started off with the grilled octopus and grilled scallops. Both were grilled just right. The octopus had a slight crunch. Not burnt. Just the right amount of browning. Flavors ever so lightly with a dash of salt. Enough for you to taste the freshness of the octopus itself. It was tender and kept me coming back for more. The scallops were grilled just right. Not chewy at all. Great flavor. Our party of 5 shared the porterhouse for 2 and a ribeye as well as a piece of salmon. While the steaks that came out were a little thinner than I am used to (I'm used to almost 2"" thick steaks), the flavor was excellent. I doubt the steaks were aged for the price we paid but they tasted really good at medium rare! We also had two bottles of wine. Chateau de Pez Bordeaux and a Barbaresco Barolo. Both very good wines. For dessert, we had the key lime pie and the tiramisu. I liked the tiramisu better than the key lime. The key lime was a little too sweet for my taste. Nevertheless a great time was had. Even the super picky fambam raved about the meal two days later. Def a good option of you want to have good steak in Astoria without breaking the bank. Service was attentive and friendly.",1,1,2,Sylvia L.,"Brooklyn, NY",154,477,716

My bf and I ordered steaks with a side of fries. The bread basket we received before the meal was clearly old. The steak was great. Juicy. The fries weren't edible. They were definitely not fresh. I ordered a mixed drink initially it was made correctly and when I asked for a second round of the same drink, I received something different. Not to be nit-picky but I guess I'll also mention: be prepared to hear a loud screeching noise coming from the legs of the chair rubbing against the floor when you push in or out of your seat (Kind of reminded me of nails on a chalkboard).

As for food, we ordered the porterhouse, rib eyes a bunch of different sides. Scallops. Seafood. Crab cakes. It was all very good. Meat was cooked just the way we asked. The sides were a bit bland.

When we arrived, the restaurant was completely empty with the exception of one other group. The ambiance gave a classic steakhouse vibe, but in a slightly more casual environment. Service was also good. One of our waiters seemed like he might have been new, and his answers to our questions gave us the impression that he was still a bit wet behind the ears. Even so, he did a fine job. The other gentleman who was assisting in serving our party checked on us multiple times to ensure we were happy. We ordered the grilled octopus, which was phenomenal. We also ordered the bone in ribeye, porterhouse for two, creamed spinach and mushrooms in bordeliase sauce: all wonderful choices. Our steaks came out cooked to our requested levels of doneness and I can't emphasize how reasonable the prices were!

4.0,4/23/2017,"The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because the butter they serve with the bread was frozen and the drink was way too strong. Those were the only downfall of this restaurant. We asked for more ginger beer for our Texas mules and the drink issue was resolved very quickly. The butter was very annoying, we can tell a lot for customer service if butter is served frozen.... However everything else there is top! The server PACO was a great true gentleman that took great care of us with all we could eat peasant breads warm with olive oil, getting our drinks quickly and making sure our table was always on point. The steaks do not come with sides. The entire place as any steakhouse is completely a la carte. We had the ribeye we had it medium well they cooked it to perfection. The sides we had were the mushrooms and mash potatoes. Omg you must at least have the mushrooms because they are like a sauce and they have the perfect spices to marry with the steak it is absolute heaven.We had some coffe and some chocolate mousse cake to close the n oh ght and the desert was also perfection.

Appetizers (crab cakes, grilled octopus, French onion soup) were fantastic. A few more drinks. Then comes the highlight of the evening - the perfectly grilled and soft as butter steaks.

5.0,1/24/2017,"I don't even know where to start! Been here about 3 times in the past 6 months and each time it's just as consistently good or even more. My first visit was on a weekday in Aug for the bf's birthday, I needed to find a decent, casual steakhouse that didn't have that snooty ambiance you find at other REAL steakhouses that aren't Outback or Longhorn lol. (The bf does not like dressing up) Needless to say, I found MTM on yelp, saw the prices were very reasonable and decided to give it a go. Making a reservation is a breeze, as they are on the OpenTable app (which I used, last minute for all 3 occasions) and there's usually always a good amount of times available. The service is very warm and extremely polite from the owner, Adnan, greeting you as you walk in and then Paco and the other young men taking and serving your orders. I didn't even mention it was my bf's birthday the first time because he doesn't like the extra attention but from the level of service, it felt like it was both our birthdays :) What's even better is that this isn't the type of restaurant where the waiters constantly hover above you, but they do always make sure your water is refilled  and the foods tasting good. The food! First time: got the grilled calamari as an app, then porterhouse for 2, creamed spinach, steamed broccoli and asparagus (which Paco suggested to have it with. Sautéed garlic, yes!), and of course the hash browned potatoes. Everything was to die for. The calamari was not at all fishy or rubbery, definitely as fresh as possible. I usually cut off all the fatty, flubbery parts of the steak but this steak was pretty lean and so tender that I just ate it whole and to my surprise, even the fatty parts just melted wonderfully. The sides were also really good; the creamed spinach was the perfect balance and not drowned in cream and salt (ahem Gallaghers), the veggies perfectly cooked and garlicky, and the potatoes were crispy yet soft perfectly seasoned chunks. For dessert, we kept it simple and got the lemon sorbet which was a pleasant end to our great meal- it was slightly tangy but more creamy and vanilla ish. As we left, I promised Adnan I would return I'd bring more and more  people next time, which is what happened the next 2 times :) On one visit one of my cousins was like is the owner your friend, ""he's super friendly?"" , no but he's awesome. Trust the service to still be phenomenal even if he's not there like my last visit 2 Sundays ago. 5 stars. Try the burger and grilled octopus! Try everything! *No complaints overall but rather a suggestion to describe a little better on menu that the ""steak sandwich"" is marinated, saucy, open faced and comes alone.

4.0,1/11/2017,"Is it fair to compare Meet the Meat to Peter Luger's? Probably not. But anyhow, I had a great time at Meet the Meat for my boyfriend's birthday. I was able to easily make and modify my reservation via Opentable. For a Tuesday evening, the restaurant was pretty empty so I probably could've gotten away with not making a reservation at all. (But we all need to rack up on those Opentable points somehow..) We ordered the Porterhouse for 2 after much contemplation on how much fat and flavor we want out of our steak and decided the Porterhouse is the best of both worlds. I was slightly disappointment that the Porterhouse lacked both fat and flavor; simply said, it wasn't melt in my mouth to die for amazing steak. BUT, it was a overall great piece of steak, especially those last pieces closest to the bone. While we couldn't finish the Porterhouse for 2 at Peter Luger's because it was too oily, we finished the steak here AND our side dishes here AND still had room for dessert.The sauteed mushrooms and mashed potatoes made great side dishes. And obviously my glass of Cabernet complimented the whole meal very well. If I don't want to wait 3 months for a reservation, I would come here. But if I'm not dying to have steak right this second, I would go to Peter Luger's and pay approximately the same price and get all that fat and flavor I was craving.",2,1,1,Janice F.,"New York, NY",95,138,60

Simply present the emailed certificate to the server on your smart phone or other portable electronic device, or provide the server with your unique gift certificate number.

5.0,10/29/2016,"My wife and I decided to try MTM on my birthday after a year of talking about. We arrived on a Friday around 5:45pm.  Being so early we were the only ones in the dining room.  We were greeted by the staff and Paco, the head waiter, showed us to our  table. He was very friendly and accommodating throughout our meal as well as the staff.       We looked at the drink menu and decided on the MTM martini and my wife chose the Cosmopolitan. I really enjoyed the MTM with the juice mixed in it. I always enjoy having my dessert first so opted for the tiramisu since it was made in house. I would've ordered the key lime but it wasn't made in-house and they may or may not have been ordered from Steve's Keylime pies which is great but I've had a bunch of their delicious pies and wouldn't have thought it special since I've eaten it so often.      We had eaten at Peter Luger's a month earlier and decided to try MTM's tomato and onion salad. MTM's price was a little more than half of Peter Luger's but unfortunately was only half the size. Peter Luger's tomato and onion have a 4"" diam. and 1/4""thickness.        We decided to try the grilled calamari. It was good but the generosity in of the number pieces as seen in other reviewer pics was lacking. I was surprised how few pieces we had gotten.       The porterhouse for 2 was cooked to medium and was very tender and tasty. The fat was crispy and delicious. I felt the steak  at MTM was tastier than Peter Luger's and it didn't need any sauce but was curious as to what sauce was available, as per another review. Unlike some places this steak doesn't come with any side dishes and would have to be ordered separately if interested.       We ended our meal with Mexican coffee and Jamaican coffee prepared by Paco both were equally tasty.       We would definitely come back for steak but wouldn't order again the tomato-onion salad or calamari.",0,0,0,Pacita G.,"JAMAICA, NY",0,25,13

The scallops were ok, they were pretty small. The salad and oysters were really good. Then we ordered the porterhouse for 3 and the bone in prime rib. They were both delicious. The sesoning was good and it was cooked exactly how I wanted my steaks to be, medium rare. We ordered sides of cream spinach, hash browns, asparagus, and mash potatoes. The sides were good not to heavy. We were very full at the end of the meal and didn't order any desert. I would definitely come back here again.",1,0,0,Michelle Y.,"Jackson Heights, NY",53,25,72
5.0,8/2/2016,This place ranks up there with all of the big name steak houses. It is also a little less expensive. The food was cooked perfectly!  We had the Shrimp Cocktail and Seared Scallops as appetizers and Porterhouse for entree. All were extremely tender and flavorful. The creamed spinach was one of the best we ever had. MTM is now one of my top steak houses which I will definitely return to.,0,0,0,Eugene K.,"Middle Village, NY",0,5,0
4.0,7/28/2016,"I came here with my husband and two friends a couple of nights ago. The steaks are FANTASTIC!!!!!! I got their special that night, the bone in filet mignon and my husband got the bone in rib eye. It is totally worth the trek out to Queens! They also were really nice about us bringing our own wine, the corkage fee is $20. I'm giving it 4 stars only because I wasn't too impressed with the rest of the food (sides and appetizers, we got creamed spinach, hash browns, mushroom, and baked potato as well as a scallop appetizer).

4.0,7/21/2016,"First....guys.....you HAVE to change the name.  It reminds me of a porn title or an advertisement for a gay club.That notwithstanding, this is hands down the best steak in Astoria, and perhaps one of the best in Queens. (only been to a dozen or so, which did not measure up to MTM).  The Premium cuts of meat are a testament to the quality of food.  And, the chef cooks it exactly to your order.  True professional - not a minimum wager found on the help wanted ads on Craigslist.The sides are also cooked to perfection, with alterations being made at our request.  Again, a truly professional back of house. In addition, the front of house service was both excellent and professionl.The final bill will cost you half of a ""Sparks"" or ""Smith and Wollensky"" yet deliver the same meal.  After meeting the owners, I discovered they were old ""Sparks Steak House"" employees who had exported their secret to Astoria.  Well done, fellas.   I will be there a lot.",0,0,0,Phil K.,"Denver, CO",0,6,0

4.0,7/16/2016,"The service was excellent! I loved the care and attention we received. Mr.Adnan was very friendly and gracious. The food- my boyfriend and I ordered for appetizer was the grilled calamari and it came with a salad. At first we thought the Calamari was heavy on the garlic but when we incorporated it with the greens and the lemon juice it was a merry blend . The texture of the calamari was just right! Not chewy because it was over done. Now for the steak my boyfriend ordered a filet mignon rare with Brussel sprouts and he loved it! I tried a piece of it and it was cooked rare perfectly. I ordered a prime sirloin with mashed potatoes. The sirloin was cooked perfectly! The mashed potatoes could use a little more flavor but it wasn't entirely bad. We will certainly go back! It's a great unassuming place, staff is warm and friendly and I like the atmosphere, the music was also pleasant. Thank you Mr. Adnan!",0,0,0,Bibi A.,"RICHMOND HILL, NY",0,14,1

A guy with all the class of the old days but 110% today's biz owner.  Smart guy.  Classy.  Excellent restaurateur.  The food was insanely good.  So good my girl just got the filet.  No sides.  No sauces.  And she said it was one of the top meals of her life.  The music in this place is even fantastic.  Old standards from Billie holiday to frank to dean to...Harry connick.  It's kinda like that place Henry Hill takes Karen on their first real date.  Minus the lounge acts.  Go here.  Tell your loved ones how good it was.  I'm gonna be going back very soon,1,0,1,Danny B.,"New York, NY",0,45,11
5.0,7/11/2016,"We returned at my girlfriend's request for her birthday dinner, excellent Porterhouse for two once again, along with sides. With it late on Tuesday July 5, day after the holiday and a weeknight, we had the dining room to ourselves until nearly the end of our meal. Paco was the waiter and as the first time we came, was very attentive and personable. He even handled the rude man and also rude boy with his seemingly nice mother that arrived late with far more grace than he received. They inexplicably chose to sit at the table right next to us which we thought was a bit odd since literally the entire dining room had no one else in it, then once we were forced to hear their conversations and the way the man treated Paco, we hastened our exit. My girlfriend was even brought a delicious slice of double chocolate cake with fresh fruit and a candle when I had mentioned in passing that it was a birthday dinner. Very thoughtful and generous of him not putting it on the bill. We'll certainly come back as soon as we can for our next special occasion!",0,0,0,Sean V.,"Astoria, NY",2,23,0
4.0,7/9/2016,"My girlfriend and I had fun at mtm.  Not fun like you may be thinking but fun in how we were forced to laugh at the evening. I think a list is easiest to share our experience.  1. Before we were both sitting I was asked if we wanted something to drink. Funny that a drink order should be asked to both guests.  I suggested the waiter come back after my date was situated.  2.  The next attempt for drinks was solicited without a drink menu. But a quick-thinking water boy slipped these papers into the headwaiter's hand like a relay racing baton. Results, a beer and a soda. 3.  Ahh, finally come the subject drinks. Nice - the waiter is pouring my beer into a chilled glass. Pouring. Pouring. Pouring. Okay the glass is crowned with a head like a sultan. Perfect. But wait!  The beer pouring scene has become a challenge to the waiter to drain every last drop into the glass.  Only after my direction to Stop and please just leave the bottle with me and the remaining beer did the flowing stop. Just weird. 4.  We peruse the menu and select a house greens salad to share. 5.  Next comes another employee. Not the waiter. Not the water boy (we hadn't gotten to meet him yet). I'm guessing this well-dressed man is the owner that wants to take our order. Great. A selection of sides is ordered.  One steak is ordered. How would you like it cooked?  Medium please. Another steak is ordered. And off he goes. 6.  Next the salad forks magically disappear. What the heck?   Maybe those forks were old and needed to be replaced with forks that only come after the salad is served.  I don't understand.   The salad was as-titled House Greens. Plenty of greens but not an accessory to be found other than a tomato wedge. 7.  The Nicely dressed man comes back to ask how that other steak was to be cooked.  Normally these instructions are taken with the order. Just weird. 8. The salad plates were cleared9.  The steaks came looking wonderful but very lonely on oversized plates. Followed by the certified pepper grinder who delivers the amount he feels as sufficient despite my attempts to request more of the black gold before he turns and scurries away.  I don't get it. 10. Three sides were received. The sautéed spinach and garlic was best. The sautéed mushrooms were swimming in a dark brown sauce overwhelming any mushroom flavor. The mashed potatoes were delivered cold. I don't understand. Cold.  I ask for a replacement bowl and receive a serving at a slightly higher temperature.  I still don't understand. 11.  The meal was finished and the plates cleared and aside from the above we were pleased.  12.  The place is nice, smallish but well fitted with fine chairs and tables.  Which, when being reset, caused a loudest of grinding noises not unlike that of fingernails upon a chalkboard. 13.  Well it was time to go but not wanting to skip on the bill I walked to the cash register to request my check.  I shared a few of my observations with the nicely dressed man who was very willing to adjust the check and buy me a drink. Maybe next time. All in all - nothing was terrible but 5 stars are 5 stars and 3 stars are but 3. I think the owner should hire more waiters and let them do their job. He should just observe from a distance and provide guidance when needed. Yes. I will return. Second visit was not as crowded. Not as twilightish. Portions are extraordinary and selfish.  I'll be back for sure.",2,2,1,Bill S.,"Niagara Falls, NY",89,39,1
5.0,7/3/2016,"For a year our friends have been telling us about this place. Finally, last night we decided to give it a shot. We are excited to add it to our list of hidden gems. We went right to the entrée with a porterhouse steak for two, side of onion rings, creamed spinach, and an affordable bottle of Chianti. This made for an overall great meal. Here's why:The temperature of the steak was as ordered (medium-perfectly cooked).The texture of the steak was impeccable, melted in your mouth. The house-made steak sauce was a perfect compliment, if you desired. The creamed spinach was fresh, not overly saturated with cream. One of the highlights of the meal. The service was top-notch. Our waiter, Paco, knew his product to the 10th degree and only appeared when you needed him. The owner, who was also present, creates an atmosphere that is intimate and comfortable. It is obvious that the management takes great pride in the overall experience.

4.0,4/17/2016,"Stopped in on Easter Sunday, 3/27/16 with my boyfriend for an early dinner. I had been craving a good steak but did not want to venture out of my neighborhood. I had driven past Meet the Meat quite a few times and always wanted to try it. Prior to entering this establishment I read quite a few of the reviews. They had a positive rating of four and a half stars so I proceeded to read the negative reviews because it's nice to get both perspectives. I was not at all moved by any of the negative reviews because many of them seemed very trivial, comparable to a whiny child.I called prior to eating there just for confirmation on a table and making sure they had operable hours due to the fact that it was a holiday. As soon as my boyfriend and I walked in, we received a warm greeting from the owner who said he remembers us calling because we spoke to his son. In that instance I felt like the place was very homey and they cared about their customers. We were quickly seated in a corner table that was very cozy, which I loved. We were quickly handed drink menus. My boyfriend ordered a beer and I had a Cosmopolitan. I must say, my drink was very good. The beer was served in a chilled glass. After receiving our drinks, we were brought the dinner menu. We got the porterhouse for two (medium), creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. The food came out very quickly and was rather tasty. My only complaint is that the food was not hot enough, temperature wise. It came out rather warm, the sides included. I would've preferred seeing some steam. But I digress, the steak was cooked very well and the creamed spinach was fantastic. I definitely recommend getting the creamed spinach as a side. Throughout the entire dinner, we were constantly being checked on and that was a big plus for me. Their customer service skills are excellent. I would definitely go back.",2,0,0,Tricia D.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",3,6,10

4.0,3/23/2016,"I met a group of friends here for dinner on a Saturday night. I'm a Texas boy; in Texas cattle is king, and this boy knows and adores his steak. Coming from Houston where steaks are plentiful in the supermarket and cheap enough to eat on a regular basis, it is rare that I go more than a week without my beloved bovine. It had been several weeks since my lips last caressed the tender love of prime cut, and I had withdrawals. I waltzed in the joint starving, and satiated by the aroma of the glory that surely awaited me. The cocktails were fantastic, the oysters equally so. The sides were fairly steakhouse standard-fare, but the Creamed Spinach stood out with me. I love creamed spinach, had high hopes for this one, and boy did it deliver. The steak was glory. A few pounds of heaven brought forth and placed on a platter in front of me as if by divine intervention. The table was sharing several powerhouses ""for two"", and I begrudgingly acquiested to an order of medium-rare. I'm a rare kind of man, anything more and you sacrifice the glorious flavor of beef that lustfully subdues the senses. I was not to be left wanting. The steak was perfection. Buttery, well aged, and triumphant with flavor like a Roman Centurion coming home from battle victorious to the march of all of Rome's pomp and circumstance.  For desert we elected to share a pecan, and key lime pie(s), and a cheesecake. All were fantastic. But, the pecan pie stood out as the prima donna of desert. Buttery, flaky, perfectly balanced sweetness; perfection. Meet the Meat unreservedly deserves my approval. You can bet your lucky star that I'll gladly return.",2,3,0,Clayton H.,"Queens, NY",26,89,13

We were in the mood to try something new from our usual go-to steakhouse, Destefanos, in WIlliamsburg.  We were more than satisfied with ""Meet the Meat."" Upon arriving we were greeted by the owner. We shared a porterhouse for 2, with a side of creamed spinach and a side of steamed broccoli. Everything was above and beyond our expectations. The steak was cooked perfectly and was flavorful enough to stand alone without sauce needed. The sides were delicate and delicious as well. Throughout the night the owner attended to us and made sure we had everything we need. He even offered us a drink to end our nights but we kindly declined.

Another guy who was either the owner or manager was posted up by the bar checking on tables and ensuring everyone was taken care of the entire time i was there.Food: The steak I got here can easily be compared to the likes of Keens steak house and Smith and Wolinskys in manhattan which are both far more expensive. It was perfectly cooked and clearly a very high quality piece of meat. The attention to detail was clear, the table bread was sliced and toasted with olive oil and the sides were all great.

But my fiancé kept saying the owners should do something and Im starting to agree with her. If this restaurant wants to be known as a great Steakhouse in NY I think the name can hold it back.There were a couple other issues with our visit, but for the most part we enjoyed our dinning experience, the staff and owner were extremely friendly and you could tell they truely cared about their customers. The food was good and its was reasonably priced. My issue were minor and if properly addressed can be fixed easily. We ordered the steak for 2. We asked for it medium rare but it came out over cooked. The flavors were there but it was dryer than usual. Also at a steakhouse when you order the Porter House for 2 the plate usually has the juices from the steak that you can spoon over. However our plate was dry. I suggest the chef leave those juices to give it more flavor. Last was the option of steak sauces. This may be my opinion alone but i like a nice steak sauce. Our options here were A1 and a brown gravy. If they could work in a Cocktail sauce it would have gone a long way with me. Overall this restaurant has some growing pains but if they can fix their issues this has potential to be a nice Steakhouse in Astoria.",9,1,1,Joe G.,"CANAL STREET, NY",59,144,16

Paco wheeled out our Porterhouse for two-hot, juicy, and to temperature as ordered, accompanied by mashed potatoes and mushrooms.

4.0,12/27/2015,"Food - 4.5  stars, the food is great. I give a minus .5 stars because the potatoes portion was a bit smaller than I expected. They are supposed to be big enough for 2, but my boyfriend and I had to get an extra portion. The meat, however, was cooked really great. We also had grillled calamari. I was pretty impressed with that.  The asparagus was OK --it lacked flavor. They also could improve on food presentation. One steak alone on a large plate seemed lonely. Don't places usually have something to improve the aesthetics- even if it's a little leaf?Drinks: They have a bar, but the bartender is also a waiter? Sort of confusing. Also, I suggest that they expand their cocktail menu beyond just martinis + a cosmo. Price- Great!! For great steak, I can't believe we paid for a portion of the price as other steakhouses in the city we've been to. Service: Okay, everyone is extremely nice. Overall, I give it 4 stars on service. I think it's a bit confusing however to be served by multiple people, including our bartender, the owner, and some other 2 people. What I enjoy about going out often and am used to, is one person tending to my dining requests. Location: It's not in a prime location in Astoria - a bit of a trek..Many restaurants in Astoria are located near the subway stations (i.e. Broadway, 30th Ave, Ditmars) This place is tucked near Astoria Park. All for walking, but I think they should definitely consider a different location if space opens up along the more busier locations in Astoria. Overall, I'd give them a 4.5 stars. I think they are doing well for a new establishment, and I think this place has great potential to grow. I hope they take my critique as great pointers for improvement.",0,0,0,Mai T.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,75,6

5.0,11/11/2015,"Aside from it's arguably tacky name, everything else about this place is anything but. This place has all you want and expect from a legit steakhouse: reasonable prices, top quality steaks, and impeccable service.Came here on Halloween night with a bunch of friends. About half the crowd inside the joint were wearing costumes, it was a riot. We particularly took a liking to a Superman and Catwoman couple sharing a very romantic dinner. Though I'm not sure Batman was pleased about it. Haha anyway, the interior is quite spacious and the vibe is fairly old-school and comfortable, but with some modern finishes (white table covers, dimly lit, with a chic brick-lined wall in the main dining area). Our server was super friendly, very attentive and helped answer any questions we had about the menu. We decided to skip appetizers and just order our steaks along with various sides.For my steak, I went with what this place is known for, the filet. I'm typically not that big a filet fan as I typically gravitate toward fattier, more flavor cuts, like a ribeye. I'm honestly not sure if they dry-age or wet-age the steaks here, but what I am sure of is that this filet was bonkers good. My steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare and insanely flavorful. The sear done on both sides created the ideal crust for texture and helped to lock in all the those meat juices on the inside. Drool city. Well worth the $35. As for the sides, they were equally on point. The creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, and asparagus were the perfect accompaniments to all the meaty goodness. And as for service, it doesn't get any better. I already mentioned our awesome server, but the owner, Adnan, was such a delight and continually checked in on us throughout the evening. A couple of us decided to park ourselves at the bar after the meal and order a few rounds. Even though we probably a bit rowdy at that point and were there well-beyond the normal closing time, Adnan and team continued to wait on us until we finished our last drink. Those things do NOT go unnoticed in my book. I really can't say enough good things about the staff. I tend not to use the term ""hidden gem"" much on here, but in this case it's completely warranted. Well done, Meet the Meat. Thank you for respecting the tradition of fine dining sans the pretension.",3,1,2,Joel P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",195,78,141

We got the creamed spinach and mashed potatoes as our sides. Both started off with the French onion soup, and that was amazing! Best soup ever. I might go back by myself sometimes just for the soup. Seriously a wonder this place exists hidden deep in Astoria. A must go! Oh and don't forget to sit down and order the Louis Martini can. Also great wine!The only recommendation I have for this place is to bake the mashed potatoes, after they're in the bowl, and maybe add some garlic during preparation.

Our Anniversary night began with a spoiled four year old who didn't wanted to stay home alone with the babysitter... Anyway needless to say we were running extremely late for our reservation so I called, to my surprise instead of getting some angry hostess on the other side I got this kind understandable man who told me that he will hold our table and to take our time (it was actually the owner)After finally making it there our night started with an amazing bottle of Cab with one of the most tender and delicious octopus ever, four our main course we had the porterhouse for two which was cooked to perfection! It just melted in our mouths! We got as sides the sautéed mushrooms and a baked potato. The food was on point perfectly cooked and you can see how much effort and passion is put in every single of their dishes.Having worked as a server for more than 10 years my expectations every time I go out to dinner are very high and boy did they deliver! Our server (Paco) was probably the most amazing, courteous, professional and knowledgeable server I've ever come across, seen him work was a pleasure he was absolutely perfect. Next time we go and trust me it will be very soon I don't care how much we have to wait to be on one of his tables.To our surprise the owner knew it was our Anniversary and gave us a delicious piece of tiramisu while thanking us for our business.

We didn't have a reservation but they happily welcomed us. The restaurant was packed, which is always a good sign as far as I'm concerned. The wait for a table was not long at all.  Once we were seated, we both were so happy we decided to come here and not go into Manhattan. I'm really picky when it comes to service and we were not disappointed.  The staff was really attentive and really knew their stuff I ordered the crab cake appetizer and my husband had the baked clams and they were both so delish and our server suggested cocktails that complemented our apps.  I had the filet mignon for my entrée and my husband ordered the medallion of beef which was so damn good !!! tender, juicy, cooked perfectly. Our server also suggested a beautiful cabernet wine to accompany dinner and it was damn perfect.  Ohhh, I almost forgot the mention the side dishes !! Holy Moly !! The mashed potatoes were whipped to perfection, we also ordered the creamed spinach which I'm kind of embarrassed to say I almost put my face in the bowl to lick it clean because it was so good. As stuffed and happy as we were with dinner, our server offered us dessert and coffee and after dinner drinks which I was going to refuse but when he came to our table with tiramisu and two forks and told us since it was pleasure to have us, dessert was on him, how could we refuse ?! and it was so creamy and dreamy that I just smiled for the rest of the evening, I couldn't even speak anymore.  Everything really hit the spot for this picky foodie. :)",2,0,0,S D.,"Flushing, NY",8,13,2
1.0,10/25/2015,"To illustrate this establishment in a nutshell, if you're looking to sit and wait long periods of time to receive any sort of service this is the place to frequent. The restaurant staff seems friendly and welcoming at first, but after you are seated prepare to experience a great deal of neglect.The place is extremely unorganized for a yelp rated five star establishment with multiple reviews. On numerous occasions we were forced to wait to have our orders taken. Followed by waiting even further to have our food brought to us. The only place I would wait two hours to have my food serve to me is if the pope himself was serving it. But wait there's more! When we actually received our food it was either too cold, too seasoned, undercooked or overcooked (in regards to the steaks). As I attempted to calm myself down thinking the place may be very busy this evening, I looked around at other tables and noticed everyone else had the same issue. Nevertheless, I thought perhaps they were short staffed in the kitchen. Even then as a long time manager in a massive public establishment myself, I would walk around and speak with the patrons offering some sort of explanation. Bottom line, I would never go back to this place and the only reason I didn't leave after 15-20 minutes of neglect  was I didn't want to ruin my friend's birthday evening.",3,2,2,Ruben I.,"Rego Park, NY",2,4,0
2.0,10/25/2015,"After hearing about this place and seeing everyone giving this restaurant  5 stars I was excited to go here. Never have I been so disappointed with the quality of service or quality of food. It took an hour to receive a menu another hour and a half for appetizers to come out and about 3 hours to get our main meal. We ordered steaks, soup, and a few side dishes. Side dishes were cold when served already. We asked for a medium steak and either got rare or over cooked piece of meat with absolutely no flavor. No salt especially and very dry. Soup was overly salted. This was the worst experience I've ever had with a restaurant. The only reason I did not get up and leave was because it was a birthday party otherwise I would have. The only reason I did not give this place a one star is because the waiter was very kind and took the dishes that no one touched off of the overall receipt. I would not recommend this place.

1.0,10/24/2015,I'm highly disappointed! I was excited to see 5 stars and try this place for my husband's birthday dinner but the service is awful! When we got there the place was pretty empty and our waiter informed us that it was his first day. Once our food came out we never saw our waiter again. As we ate it started to get packed and the restaurant was so loud. The place isn't that big but it was super loud to the point where you had to talk very loud. I will say the quality of the food was very good and the meat was cooked well but there was no flavor or seasoning in anything. The hash brown potatoes are just home fries. The owners son came to see how we were doing. Our waiter was then servicing a table of 12 and we never saw him again. Then two women came to see how we were doing and explained it was very busy and the kitchen was crazy. After we finished dinner it took 15 minutes to get our dessert menus and another 30 minutes before someone asked for our dessert order. We finally got our dessert and asked for the check. Another 15 minutes for someone to take my card. Ugh! Even the table of 4 sitting next to us were feeling the same way. It was our first time ever giving a 10% tip.

4.0,10/8/2015,"I know I'm breaking the trend of all the five star reviews here, but I'm being generous with four stars.  I think it's a three star restaurant but the fourth star is for the excellent service, warm and clean décor and good wine list.  The filet mignon was very good, but a little over the medium I requested.  The mashed potatoes were good and the spinach was too.  I think the food is good, (have I mentioned that?) but it lacks something, a little soul perhaps.  It's not enough to put a piece of good meat on the plate, even for the minimalist.  I think the restaurant could go from good to great if they dialed in a few things: 1. add some creative sauce options 2. spruce up the sides ie: truffle mashed, parmesan dusted fries, something more updated than the old classics. 3. plate the food with some flair.  I think with a few adjustments the food can be more visually appealing and updated from the 80's to today's globally inspired twists on classic fare.  The major positive is that while not cheap, it's still about 15% to 20% cheaper than some of the better known steak houses in Astoria.

The owner and staff are consummate professionals who clearly and sincerely care about every guest, and they went out of their way to make sure we had a flawless experience. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. It's worth traveling to from other boroughs. We will be back again and again for sure! This is our new go-to spot, not only for world-class steaks, but also for an all-around happy and memorable dining experience.",1,0,0,Hank S.,"Rego Park, NY",0,3,1
5.0,8/25/2015,"1) It's a steakhouse in Astoria. And no - I am not talking about some mediocre places that call themselves as steakhouse... This is about as good as steakhouses can get. Oh did I mention that it's in Astoria and that I don't have to spend $40 in taxi fare or wait 47 minutes for the darn N train to come in the evening after they cut off the Q train? 2) We ordered (1) grilled calamari (2) porterhouse for two and (3) Argentinian wine...and what do you know? They don't charge an arm and a leg for the drinks OR apps... Yes! After a steak meal, I still have two arms and two legs! Hallelujah! 3) Steak was cooked to perfection. No, it wasn't drowning in some A1 sauce - but nice coating of salt & pepper. When you do it right, that's all you need. 4) Service - it seems like they were still figuring things out, but otherwise, cups were filled quickly, and they paid attention to us without stalking about how many pieces we've had.5) Overall - it's a place that I would definitely go back. Good bye steakhouses of Manhattan! Sam's rating: Praise the Lord!",1,3,0,Sam C.,"New York, NY",92,16,1

5.0,8/22/2015,"As a lifelong New Yorker I have to say that MeetThe Meat can proudly be mentioned in the same sentence as the ""better known"" steakhouses in New York. My wife & I had their steak for 2 cooked perfectly to medium rare as per our request. We also had their mozzarella & tomato which was delicious as well. The owners of this place clearly know what they're doing (I got to speak to one of them & he's been in the restaurant business for over 25 years). Their prices are also very friendly & are a welcome to the typically over priced restaurants in New York. Thank you for opening up & I look forward to going for dinner again in the near future.",4,0,0,Adam S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,25,2
5.0,8/21/2015,A unbelievable find when I was walking down the street in Astoria.. As delicious as any steak I've ever had and the the price is right! Adnan the owner is a class act. Definitely check this spot out if your in Astoria and in the mood for a tasty affordable steak... Good job guys..,3,0,0,Johan H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,52,5
4.0,8/18/2015,So this is for their seamless delivery.  1st time I ordered was very disappointed as they sliced up the steak and it was way overcooked.2nd time I ordered asked them to cook less than I usually get and not slice it up and came out better.  Overall no steakhouses in Astoria that deliver so if I was in the mood I'd get it but be very specific on how you order.,0,0,0,Ash D.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,8,1

5.0,8/10/2015,"Friend of ours highly recommended this place and after appetite building few pitchers of beer at the Bohemian Beer Garden which is down the block, we decided to go and try it. It was even better than expected. Food, service, ambiance all five stars.Most of all, I liked their well selected and very low marked up wine list, which is not the case with most steakhouses.",4,1,0,Asdren K.,"Manhattan, NY",1,22,2
5.0,8/7/2015,"Great steak place in Astoria . I have never eaten octopus nor ever intended to but my friends coerced me into trying it as it was the best grilled octopus they'd had. Ended up getting another order. Ventured to the outdoor seating area for an after drink where the owner chatted with us and the chef came out to greet us. Oh yeah, my slice steak in bordelaise sauce was amazing.",2,0,0,Luis T.,"Bogota, NJ",47,4,1
5.0,8/4/2015,"Exactly what I was looking for in Astoria! A place with delicious steak and outstanding service. Hands down, this is one of the best steakhouses outside of Manhattan. Great location and personable service. The owner/manager Adnan and the staffs will take care of you like your family. I highly recommend and will be going back to dine again!",2,0,0,Kitty C.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",28,62,24
5.0,7/30/2015,"This steakhouse just opened a month ago and it is such a great added treasure to Astoria. The food was simply outstanding. Was curious when I saw all five star reviews for a new restaurant, and I was not disappointed. The steaks were cooked to perfection. From the shrimp cocktail to grilled calamari to the super fresh oysters to the hash browns, to everything. Place is great. Tiramisu was heavenly. The owner is about the warmest, kindest, caring restaurant owner I have ever come across. A gift to Astoria. A must go. Great wine selection as well.",3,0,0,T P.,"LONG IS CITY, NY",0,2,0
4.0,7/18/2015,"Great Restaurant overall! I have to say this is a wonderful addition to Astoria since there are not too many steakhouses in the area. We started with the broiled shrimp.  It was very lemony but lacked salt. The steak was grilled to perfection. The creamed spinach was really good. The french fries were a bit of a disappointment - standard frozen french fries deep fried golden brown. It would be best to use fresh potatoes and fry them!!!  I hope they change that on the menu!! We were so full we could not order dessert!! I wish I saved enough for it, but maybe next time. All in all, we will definitely be back!",0,0,0,Sabrina S.,"Jackson Heights, NY",48,17,6
5.0,7/5/2015,This was our first visit to a new steakhouse in Astoria...it was fantastic!! Same quality of steak you would find at the top Manhattan places at half the cost. Service was attentive and knowledgeable. Good wines at a reasonable price. I will definitely be back.,4,0,0,Charlie K.,"Long Island City, NY",0,2,0
5.0,7/4/2015,We just returned from our first visit at Meet the Meat and was very impressed with this new resteraunt! The place is beautiful  and the staff  is very friendly and attentive! We were a party of four with a toddler  and they made us feel very welcome. For appetizer we got the grilled calamari which was tender and delicious. We also tried the shrimp bisque which was outof this world. A member of the party also tried the french onion which was also outstanding.  The steaks for the main course  were amazing and mouth watering. You didnt even need a steak knife really thats how buttery the meat was. Will definitely  be back !,5,0,0,Alessandra K.,"ASTORIA, NY",49,2,0
5.0,7/1/2015,I went in for lunch with a group of 5. Everything was delicious and the wine prices were extremely affordable. The steak sandwich was cooked to perfection and delicious.

5.0,6/29/2015,"This was my first visit. Went with a group of six. The atmosphere is very warm and welcoming.All meat cuts served were made to perfection. We could not leave without having some desserts - all very good.The service was very efficient and friendly.This is one of the best Steakhouse places we have tried outside of Manhattan. Will return here to try some of the other menu items. If they consistently produce the same quality of food and provide the same level of friendly service that we experienced, then anyone dining here should be very pleased.",3,0,0,A K.,"Murray Hill, Manhattan, NY",0,27,4
1.0,6/27/2015,After giving 5 stars and as promised we went back to Meet the Meat for Thanksgiving and let me tell you something: it was the worst decision ever.The service was absolutely horrible!! We were a big group. They separated us in two different tables (even though we had made a reservation few days before).  Nobody cared about us. We complained few times to the owner and nothing changed. It took them 6 hours to serve us and we all left before desert. The food was good but our Thanksgiving had a bitter taste. We left the restaurant disapointed and I can garanty that none of us will ever go back again.,7,3,1,Val B.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",0,15,6
