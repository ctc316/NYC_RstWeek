3.0,4/21/2019,"Would give 4 stars for the food, our waitress and the beautiful setting but definitely only 1 star for the woman up at the front desk, who was pretty awful.We had a reservation for Easter brunch at 1pm. We booked on open table weeks in advance and it doesn't say on that site that you actually need to buy general tickets for entrance to the garden in addition to reserving at the restaurant, which is frustrating, given how expensive the restaurant is and that we weren't planning to go to the garden after, but we tried to roll with it and waited in the very long ticket line (because it's a busy day, which is reasonable) and luckily got there early. We called the restaurant at 1:05 to explain that we didn't know we had to get tickets and that the line was very long, so we would probably not be at the restaurant until 1:10, asking if they could please hold our table while we got our tickets and walked over. The woman on the phone was incredibly rude and dismissive. She said ""someone from your group called and cancelled the reservation (absolutely not true), and you're already late (by 5 minutes at this point), so you have no table anymore."" It looks like the *restaurant* cancelled our reservation at 12:30 for no apparent reason, and sent us an email at 12:30 (which we didn't see until after), while we were already there, our family had driven in from out of town and we were waiting on line for tickets. Rather than acknowledging their mistake she continued to aggressively blame me for the cancelled reservation, and said if we arrived, even in the next few minutes, we would not have a table. It took arguing with her and getting the manager on the phone to finally get them to admit their mistake (kind of) and make sure our table was ready when we eventually arrived only 10 minutes after our reservation.We go to the garden all the time and this is the first time we've eaten at Yellow Magnolia. The woman at the front desk made a very nice holiday brunch really unnecessarily confrontational and stressful. I'm glad we finally got to sit down and enjoy our brunch but I'm not sure we'll come here again because of that interaction.",0,0,0,Sebastian M.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,20,0
4.0,4/6/2019,"This is pretty much what you would expect for a food stand in a park with hot dogs, hamburgers, salads, and more basic entrees. Beverages such as $4 water bottles and soda wine and froze. You can pick up snacks here too. There is outdoor seating and places to sit in the garden to enjoy your purchases. It is right by the bonsai room and the cacti too as Well as the conservatory room.

3.0,4/1/2019,"Went on this past casual and sunny Saturday afternoon, one of the first days of the Spring season. Unfortunately, I feel like I had higher expectations that weren't really met. I should have done my research beforehand, but you cannot just go inside to eat here. **NOTE: We had to purchase a $15 adult entrance ticket to the Botanical Garden in order to go inside the cafe, as this is a part of the garden. (Side note: Luckily, it was a nice day to enjoy the walk outside, but not many flowers have bloomed yet to our visibility. Sad D:)Food was pricey considering the food wasn't anything extraordinary. The food tasted light and healthy, but you can get this type of brunch anywhere you go in NYC.The venue is beautiful, but considering it was greenhouse-like, as in floor to ceiling window type of deal, it was VERY warm indoors. Beautiful to eat at, but very uncomfortable to sit through a long brunch to chit chat over. I was sweating while brunching, which probably tainted the experience a little, but that's what you get for all of the incoming sunlight which was very pretty. If ambience is more important than pit stains is for you, then go and take all the instagram photos you want! (Even though, I think that it was not as nice as the photos make it look inside :/ ) On the upside: It was defintely cooler when we stepped back outside to leave! During our meal, one of the cocktail waitresses/servers accidentally knocked over my cocktail glass over the table. She was quick to replace the drink which was kind, but no other compliments were given after that. All in all, the cost per person which was a shared biscuit appetizer, one egg-based dish each, and one cocktail each came to $37 + $15 to enter the garden. It's the price you pay for the experience I guess, but next time, I might just do a picnic at Prospect Park for half the price and probably more things to look at.**Out of fairness, this review is based on the overall experience because I had to pay to get into the venue in order to eat at the restaurant.",0,1,0,Jinnie K.,"Brooklyn, NY",325,74,95

2.0,2/9/2019,"I'm a BBG member and was glad to get reservations during restaurant week as the regular cafe menu is quite expensive for what they offer. The roasted broccoli appetizer was good, my friend ordered the salad with shaved parmesan which was fresh. However, we both ordered and had to send back the main course fried chicken with wild rice and collard green slaw. The small fried chicken cutlet tasted old and more like frozen breaded chicken, not freshly made. The wild rice was watery and equally tasteless. We tried the test tube of habanero and honey sauce they put on the plate but it did not enhance the dish. My friend reordered the chicken, hoping it was just some fluke, but I substituted the falafel with beet hummus instead. Unfortunately, the fried chicken did not improve, and the tiny falafel plate was also bland and oily. Save your money and go to the canteen outdoors in the spring. The food is much better, and it costs less than half the price.",1,0,0,Annette L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,0
5.0,2/1/2019,"Wow ! So I went during restaurant week and got an excellent lunch at a good price. I ordered the broccoli and fish tacos. The broccoli was great - oven-roasted with a side of aioli and chilli powder flakes that remind me of what they serve in Japan. And the fish tacos were excellent ! I added a few drops of the sweet yet spicy habanero sauce on the side and gave it a little kick. Also, I had some biscuits with jam and brown sugar butter. I forgot that the butter was ... butter and accidentally took a huge bite. Well worth it !",0,1,0,Chris H.,"Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn, NY",7,81,332
4.0,1/6/2019,"The food was delicious and well seasoned, I ate the scrambled eggs with sausage, home fries and salad; everything was cooked to perfection.  The lobster eggs Benedict that Mariel ate needed a tad bit of wow factor, maybe a little spice or sweetness.

3.0,6/27/2018,"It was okay. pretty expensive for smaller portions. I am a vegan so I had the organic strawberries salad with macadamia nut ricotta and crostinis- the crostinis tasted burnt but the salad itself was pretty great. (just not sure if it was worth 15 dollars)? my mom got the roasted broccoli and that was divine. I am glad they have vegan options here, but it is on the pricier side. I wish we went to the canteen instead and had the impossible burger! (or maybe the BBG could let us picnic in their gardens, due to the price of admission)?",0,0,0,Kai L.,"Islip, NY",0,14,3

5.0,6/25/2018,"What a gem! If you're coming the the gardens, the sit down café is definitely worth it. We ordered the biscuits for two, the Mac n cheese, a burger, and the ancient grain bowl w/ chicken. Everything was absolutely fantastic! The burger was decent, nothing super special, but I LOVED my grain bowl; it had a ton of fresh avocado and flavor, and was so much food that I actually had it as lunch for the next day, as well. Our waiter (I wish I got his name!) was so kind too, and gave great advice about which food to get.

3.0,5/28/2018,"So I was pretty excited to visit this place on MDW - I know that this place recently opened and the reviews have been really good. Service overall was pretty good - it was a bit awkward in the beginning because what I can only assume was a new waitress took our drinks order and another waiter came over and promptly told her that it was his table and explained which tables are his and which were hers. But anyways - after that hiccup service was pretty good. We were here for a snack/small meal, we ordered a beer each (I had the Brooklyn IPA, I think it was $7) we ordered the biscuits with molasses butter and jam (which was really good ) and the French toast. I have never spent $18 bucks on such mediocre French toast. Dried out and and just so extremely dry and disappointing. The reason I gave 3 stars was because of the biscuits were good and the view of the pond / garden was pretty nice.",0,1,0,Natalia M.,"Jersey City, NJ",119,57,121
5.0,5/22/2018,"Ok, first of all, you must know two things:1) this cafe is still relatively new and working out the kinks2) you will need to pay to get into the gardens to eat there UNLESS it's a free entry period like free Friday mornings etc. 3) on weekends you need a reservation  i've been here about three times in the last few months and the food is consistently fresh and yummy. It's a little pricey, but they use a lot of locally grown/sourced ingredients. The service is great, all of the girls who hostess are very friendly and accommodating whenever possible. Servers are attentive and engaged. Great spot for a date, family outing (I always see families with babies or children at some of the larger tables), or even alone. I love it here.

3.0,5/12/2018,"I went here today for brunch with my family. The restaurant is much smaller than I expected with a limited menu. I ordered the smoked salmon dish and it was good but nothing special. My daughter ordered the Mac n cheese from the kids menu and didn't like it because it was too ""cheesy"". My mom ordered the lamb dish and said it was mediocre. My husband ordered the frittata and was very disappointed. He said it was so salty that's all he tasted. He also felt the portion was small. My daughter and dad ordered the cheeseburgers and they enjoyed the burgers. I had a pleasant time, however I do not see myself returning. We didn't think the food was worth the price.

3.0,5/5/2018,"I came here on the first weekend in May while the Cherry Blossoms were in bloom. It seemed like all of Brooklyn was at the Gardens today. I had a 12:45 reservation for the restaurant, which was packed. People without reservations had to wait for over an hour and a half. We were seated, but since not many tables were open, we had to sit at one of the high top tables, which are somewhat uncomfortable. The service was not good at all. None of the waiters or waitresses were rude or nasty, but they seemed inattentive and everything was moving very slow. Now, I understand that it was a very busy and crowded time. But for example, we ordered the biscuits for our appetizer. Many other people were ordering the same thing, and it seemed like everybody but us was getting them. Even people who had arrived after us were served first. It is things like this that brought down the level of service. Things like the fact that the waiter did not refill our beverages, and I had ordered a soda that tasted terrible, so I got something else, and the waiter did not check to make sure the new drink was good. I even saw one of the restaurant employees arguing with an employee of the snack bar outside. I'm not sure of the circumstances, but it looked very unprofessional. Also, the waiters made a mistake and brought out our entrees before we were given the biscuits, so we had to send it back. We finally got our biscuits, and they were pretty good. A bit dense, and the fruit preserve served with it was bad. For the entree I had the Magnolia Fried Chicken. Fried chicken is something I almost never eat, but it was very good. I also liked the ""slaw"" that it was served with. I felt like a Southerner. My friend had the Ancient Grains Bowl. My friend thought it was good, not great. They found the pickled eggs that were served with it to be too salty. I did not try it. Overall, the service was bad, the food was alright, and the decor and feel of the space made me feel unrelaxed and tense. It was not terrible, but it falls into my ""mediocre bucket"" and I will not be back anytime soon.  This restaurant is part of the Patina Group, and it is too bad, because their other restaurants, such as Naples 45, the Sea Grill, and Rock Center Café are all very good. Oh well.",1,0,0,Matthew A.,"New York, NY",1,17,19
3.0,5/4/2018,"Hm.  I think I was overly excited to come to the cafe and my expectations were not met.  It photographs beautifully and looks like a large, elegant space.  Had a one hour wait on a WEDNESDAY in fact.  The structure and decor is cool but it's way smaller than it looks, was very hot even though AC was pumping.  We ordered the roasted broccoli which tasted like cigarettes.  Husband's burger was okay and had a flavorless sauce.  My salad was okay but again lacking in any distinctive flavor.  We skipped dessert but the bill came to $90.  Of course, it's better than your usual overpriced $13 sandwiches but I found the experience to be underwhelming, esp with all the info about famed chef etc.Tip: make reservations on Open Table, even after you arrive.  We were told to wait 1 hour but were able to skip the line with a reservation booked on my app.",1,0,0,Chris K.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",13,98,6
3.0,5/1/2018,"I was excited to try the biscuit box but it ended up being the worst part of the meal. The biscuits were ok, definitely had better. The butter that came with them was hard and not spreadable at all. The jelly was berries in a watery juice. If you love biscuits with jam and butter this will leave you with an unsatisfied craving for the real thing. Im trying to keep in mind that there is an emphasis on all natural health food here. The fish tacos were good, and the burger was well liked. The staff was friendly but a little awkward like they had no experience.

Vegan., vegetarian and gluten-free  options in addition to burgers, steak, and a delicious looking Reuben sandwich. We had a daikon salad, which was excellent, as well as the ancient grains salad - a delicious combination of quinoa, brown rice, greens, avocado and a pickled egg (that tasted like smoked mozzarella).

2.0,4/10/2018,"Update*On April 8th, I was finally given a refund. (soon after I posted my previous one star review)  Still really bizarre it took 3 weeks for a refund when I tried multiple times each week to remind them about it. Adding a star back because I was eventually given it. I will stick to my opinion that the customer service is horrible, it's overpriced and the taste of the food is mediocre. The good parts about this place is that the environment and food is aesthetically pleasing and comfortable. Overall, it's not worth the visit unless you're famished at the Brooklyn Botanic and need somewhere to eat asap. --------------------------------------------------Giving it a one star because the customer service is HORRIBLE! I have only been here once and it will most definitely be my last. Visited on March 18, 2018. The waitress was foolish and broke a plate during the visit, I had only ordered the ancient grain bowl and it took about twenty minutes for the food to arrive. The food was way overpriced but plated nicely. The taste was decent, I ordered it without the egg (same . After I left, I realized I had been double charged. The total being $34.15 when I only ordered one order (without eggs). Two days later, an extra $17 was being pended but later disappeared. I have called the restaurant at least 10 times asking for them to fix the problem, and have spoken to the useless manager several times. It has now been over three weeks and I'm still waiting on these annoying jerks for the refund. Their excuses have been to ""wait for a week"", ""wait until Monday"", saying they'll ""contact back"" (and don't), saying they were ""too busy"" to contact, now saying to wait another 5-7 days.

We decided to catch a Saturday afternoon lunch here after visiting the BBG (yes, you need tickets to get into the garden itself...likely not worth the trip to this place unless you are already wanting to come to the gardens). The place was not all that busy when we arrived, so the one staffed waiter seemed fine. That is, until a couple more tables came in. Our water glasses did not stay full, he forgot our order several times (one drink never came), and the while the food had some interesting and unexpected flavors, there were several basic execution flaws (the worst of which was a global lack of salt). The Daikon Noodle Bowl, although under the ""Greens"" section had no green vegetables on it and the flavor profile seemed overpowering and unbalanced. The fish tacos were bland.

5.0,2/9/2018,"One last restaurant week fling brought us to the Yellow Magnolia Cafe today.  It is located within the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, next to their Conservatory.  We discovered that their restaurant week offerings were an ideal preface to a tour of the Conservatory and it's myriad collection of plants from different biomes.Cream of cauliflower soup was my choice for a starter.  It proved zestful, spiced with pepper and rosemary, the sort of delight I would love to create at home if my reverse engineering skills could serve me well.  Cauliflower isn't know for its  strong flavor but it provides a great platform for absorbing them.  The chef knows her soups and how best to use cauliflower to better a cold day out.Chick peas are the usual prime ingredient in falafel, at least here in New York.  Our chef surprised us by relying on fava beans as the base.  Here I draw a blank in trying to guess the flavoring ingredients, possibly cardamon, a hint of cumin, maybe.  Whatever its recipe, it proved delightfully different.  One of the great things about cooking, that is akin to music, is its ability to offer interpretations that differ from the original, and can often yield equal or better results.  You just need someone with the spirit of adventure, willing to try the changes.  Enter the fava, exit the chick.  The falafel balls were served with hot sauce (again different from the usual humus paste) and leafy greens on a grilled pita round, also deliciously spiced, and topped  with a parmesan  crisp.Dessert?  I chose a coconut pudding to end my meal, a thin delicately flavored coconut yogurt laced with chia seeds and decorated with toasted coconut shreds and persimmon chunks.  The house Chardonnay proved a balanced accompaniment for my meal from start to finish.  Add to all this an attentive and cheerful server who knows what's going on in the kitchen and is willing to answer queries from curious wanna-be cooks, and you have a truly enjoyable experience that goes far beyond just eating out.And, again, timed right, you follow dessert with a guided tour of the Conservatory to enhance your knowledge while burning a few calories.The Yellow Magnolia Café at the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens; do it.",0,0,0,Wilhelm F.,"Staten Island, NY",39,69,46

It's peaceful & barely anyone around so we got to explore around a bit after we ate lunch in this pretty & modernly designed cafe.

We only remember one of their names (Andrea) since her name was on the check but again both were lovely. Even though there were only 2 other tables occupied, (l'm sure it was due to it being winter & on a Thurs, which my Bday fell on) it was nice & felt like a private room, almost. The food was pretty delicious. We were surprised at the portions, we thought since it was ""restaurant week"" & usually places serve small portions for the prex fixe menu during that time, we were expecting the same, but no, not here!

While walking away, we noticed people sitting in the next building and I told my husband I wanted to peek in the window and see what those people sitting over there, were doing.  When I realized it was a restaurant inside the garden I immediately wanted to try it.  My husband's hunger let him be pursuaded and we were seated immediately.  My husband and I had to switch seats because they were different.  I usually gravitate to the bench/cushier seats and my husband makes do with the harder wooden seats, when they are different but the seat with the cushion was actually too squishy for me to feel comfortable so I requested the hard char, which was unusually comfortable for a hard chair.  My husband loved the cushier chair so we were both quite pleased!  We got to watch the rain drops bead up on the curved windows and full nighttime roll in on the cloudy evening from our cosy chairs.My husband's beer came quickly and they were able to make the BBG's cocktail special of the evening for us, even though it wasn't on the cafe menu.We started with the biscuit box and the biscuits were warm and fluffy, yet flaky.  The caramelized molasses butter and homemade jam were just gilding the lily.  My husband, out of character, had the fish tacos and loved them.  He isn't a fish fan but he is a taco fan and they came with 3 tasty fresh tacos.  I ordered the fried chicken with the homemade honey hot sauce.  The fried chicken was crisp and unexpectedly boneless, breast meat. Since i'm a dark meat fan, it's not my ideal part of the chicken but it was excellently prepared.  The honey hot sauce came out in a dropper bottle and was described as initially being sweet with a slow heat.  I was properly hopeful for a properly spicy sweet hot sauce and was mildly disappointed.  It was tasty but it wasn't HOT.  It had a slow soft burn at the end but as a person who likes spicy food, I would describe it as between light and medium spice.  The dropper was overkill presentation if I used the whole bottle on the first piece of chicken and wanted more...  But that being said the dish was TASTY and I would have it again, in a heartbeat!!!  We tried to order dessert but they had sold out of the only dairy light dessert option so we had to pass on dessert.  So now we'll have to go back to test out their dessert chops :)When the check came, we were pleasantly surprised.  We had great food and drinks and it cost us way less what we usually pay for dinner+ drinks in the neighborhood.  It ended up being a great date night and we were sad to learn they can only be open during garden hours so there will not be any more dinners from them until the next member night, next summer.In the meantime, I will be taking my parents there for lunch, the next time they visit when the garden is open!",0,1,1,Lady M.,"New York, NY",7,60,18
2.0,9/10/2017,"Atmosphere - 4/5, Food - 2/5, Service - 1/5, Overall Value - 2/5I came here for Sunday brunch and spent 2 hours here (not by choice).  The service is very sub-par (amateur-ish) and terribly slow.  The restaurant was not even half filled, and it was so difficult getting a waiter's attention.  I even started looking around to find our waiter and not only was she nowhere to be found, the other servers and host completely ignored me even though it was obvious I was looking for my absentee server.  The last 25 minutes of our time there was spent waiting for the check.  The meal should have lasted half as long as it did.The food is decent but nothing to write home about.  I had a salad that was chopped oddly and too heavily dressed.  My glass of white sangria tasted watery.This is definitely no comparison to the Hudson Garden Grill at the NYBG in the Bronx, which is an absolutely wonderful botanic garden dining experience with a great menu.",1,0,0,M N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,0

I thought it was just a fast food type place but we went in and it was a restaurant. A nice, casual and family friendly restaurant. We accidentally went in thinking it was like Panera Bread. But I was totally wrong. And I kind of glad that we went in thr accidentally, haha. The food was excellent. I don't remember the name of my main dish I order but it was delicious.

The food was not fresh and they couldn't get a medium rare burger right. Not even the bun. Beautiful setting and nice people but as a member of the gardens I can believe this is part of the experience. I am dissatisfied and disappointed. On the other hand the canteen is just what you expect and a great time. We should have stayed in the heat among the fireflies.",0,0,0,David B.,"Brooklyn, NY",87,31,3
4.0,7/3/2017,"A group of five of us unexpectedly stopped here for lunch and had an exquisite meal. The decor is spare, pretty, but nothing spectacular. (Of course the decor outside is amazing.) But when our lunch came, we were surprised and delighted at the elegant presentations. Sometimes playful, sometimes mysterious, sometimes simple but elegant. The flavors and tastes were delicious and everyone was very pleased. (The one person who ordered a classic cheeseburger was probably the least so-- but it was an enormous and juicy burger!.) We will definitely be back!",0,0,0,Maggie M.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,39,19
2.0,6/10/2017,"Mediocre experience with lots if room for improvement. We ate here on a Saturday restaurant was not busy with multiple tables empty but was told to expect 20-25 min wait. Wait ended up to be 5 mins. Sat down was given menus.  No waiter or water for over 10 mins. Suddenly our waiter arrives to fill 2 of the four glasses of our water, said would return shortly, never returned to fill our glasses 5 min later another waiter walked by with a water pitcher and we flagged him down. 10 more min later he returns to take our order, so from the kids menu:2 children hotdogs, 1 order of children fruit salad with came with drinks and dessert. Adults shared a salad and entree.  Hotdog was just hotdog, no chips, fries or any side with buns that were burned. The child's fruit salad was:6 small red  grapes two pieces (the size of a quarter and not slices) of cantaloupe and 3 thin slices of oranges in a glass container; this was a rip-off, my kids snack cup held more fruit that this entree. Don't order it!!!  Kids eat and finishes, adults still waiting for their meals and drinks. At one point a hostess comes over to clear the children's plates and asks if we want our check!?!!  We were baffled informing her that we haven't even started, no drinks , no salad/entree.  10 more mins later the salad and entree arrives together, drinks arrive afterwards.  Beet salad was fresh and delicious. Pastrami sandwich came with undressed mustard greens. Sandwich was good but it was weird eating the dry greens. Atmosphere was light and refreshing. Service needs improvement.    Certain sections of the food could be improved as well.   Lunch took over 2 hours. Only reason to return here is to eat indoors with the air-conditioning on a hot summer day or with the heat during a cold winter.",1,0,0,w y.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,10,0

5.0,5/1/2017,"Fresh ingredients, refreshing atmosphere, great taste. Menu caught my eye strolling through the garden, glad I pursued my stomach. As a hungry Italian the word ""quinoa"" could throw you off, but let me tell you one of the best burgers ive had in a while, yes a healthy burger, grass fed, and it certainly filled me up. Dipped the ""purple chips"" (Sorry not too familiar w non-toxic alternatives.) in the remainder of my brother's chicken and dumplings so for as far as I could tell that was a win. Mom's salad also had some fresh ingredients I hadn't heard of but together with the dressing it tasted amazing. The healthiness is just a plus to the great flavor, hope to come back and try dessert.",2,1,1,Olivia P.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",1,4,0

Others at my table had the burger and fish tacos and they raved about both. This is a great addition to botanic gardens!",1,0,0,Rachel M.,"Brooklyn, NY",163,26,0
2.0,4/28/2017,"If the Chef Rob Newton or whoever runs this place wants to run a top notch place and have Yellow Magnolia have a good reputation, they better crack down asap.  While we enjoyed the food, the rest of the experience would not have us hankering for a return visit; in fact, not. My mother and I were hoping for a nice ladies restaurant experience before walking the gardens.  Upon waiting for a table (understandable), my mother visited the bathroom facilities and brought to the attention of the hostess that they needed tending to.  The hostess's reply was that the bathrooms were the responsibility of the Garden.  Now after a long wait for the food and asking the waitress a couple of times for a spoon, upon departure wanted to use the bathroom facilities as well.  An hour later, they still needed tending to - the ""bath"" that I visited, the floor was wet and the room smelled of, well I tried to find a polite word for piss and all I could find was urine, so basically the ""bath"" smelled to high heaven of urine.  And to top it off, there was no place to hang your bag or jacket, you certainly didn't want to put it in the floor.  Sorry for such a gross review, but whatever we may have enjoyed of Magnolia's was totally ruined by this component of the experience, not to mention the attitude of the front desk.  Someone roll up your sleeves and get to it!?!",0,0,0,Pat K.,"East Hampton, NY",0,12,1

3.0,4/17/2017,"After spending Easter in the Garden; we were all hungry and opted to eat here. The wait was pretty long due to the place being crowded. They allow you to check in,give your name, and they will reach out to you when it's your turn.Ambiance: 5 out 5: the ambiance was great here. The side panel windows reminded me of Del Frisco--I would say if you get a sit along the right side you're in for a great view of the garden.Service: 3.75 out 5: the wait was pretty long, I understand it was Easter, but we were told 30 minutes, but seemed way longer. Also, the food took quite awhile to arrive. The initial order was only two cheeseburgers and fruit salad-- the burger was excellent though. So much so, I had to order a third for my daughter who wanted her own. However, two burgers and a fruit shouldn't take 25 minutes! The server was friendly and accommodating, but I did have to request the check three times. Prices: 3 out of 5: it's relatively expensive. The cheeseburger ($16) came with Terra chips, not fries which I wasn't thrilled with. My biggest gripe was the fruit salad; I wish I had taken a picture, it was just mostly grapes and cost $15-- that's outrageous. The entire order came to a little over $100 for three cheeseburgers, fruit salad, two coffees, slice of cake, one Stella and one Pinot Grigio. This wouldn't be bad if it were an outside restaurant, but at the Botanical Gardens??In sum, good views, long wait, high prices and pretty good service. With everything in life there are pros and cons-- so this place is more of a 3.5 because we had a nice family Easter, but bring your patience and some cash with you for this place.",5,4,1,Jason R.,"Brooklyn, NY",400,480,1763

1.0,4/14/2017,"TL;DR Overpriced for mediocre food - bring a packed lunch or go to the canteen next door instead. The waiter told us this place two days ago (4/11/17). So I'll make a disclaimer first that these might just be growing pains for the restaurant. The space is very open and inviting with a one wall of sloping glass facing the gardens, giving the feel of being inside a greenhouse. We asked to try the Boudreaux, but when our waiter came back he said they didn't have the merlot because their distributors hadn't filled all the orders yet. (They don't even offer merlot here lol) Decided on the pinot noir ($15) which was tasty but I guess our waiter was new because he filled it only about 2/3 of the way (we saw other glasses at other tables filled much higher) but he was nice so whatever. We ordered the fried chicken ($16) and the burger ($16) cooked medium. Keep it simple right? We counted 8 waiters serving about 20 tables, half of which were empty at the time of our visit. They all seemed busy, yet our food took more than 30 minutes to arrive, perhaps because the chef was too busy talking to other patrons to attend to the kitchen. The hostess was very kind and apologized.The food arrived finally. The fried chicken had a nice crunch, but the meat itself was rather tasteless, and the two sides were also unremarkable. Money would have been better spent at Popeye's. I ordered my burger medium, but it came to me basically raw on the inside. So after half an hour waiting for this burger, we had to send it back. It arrived again 15 minutes later basically well done and burnt. For a grand opening, we were not impressed. Too bad this place will probably get away with shitty food and service given it's the only table service option in the gardens. Management needs to train its staff better and the chef needs to spend less time schmoozing and more time actually attending to his cooking. This experience really put a negative spin on our entire visit to the gardens. Would NOT recommend.",3,0,0,May K.,"New York, NY",25,169,420
5.0,4/13/2017,"An absolute gem! Very interesting menu that is refreshingly light with a few more substantial plates as well. I had the ancient grain bowl which I must say was one of the more delicious things I've eaten in a while. A variety of grains, some spicy greens, avocado, a delightful egg all with a killer mushroom broth. Get it.  My son had the cheeseburger which was juicy, cooked perfectly and gone in seconds. Chef Rob Newton hits the mark and the place has only been open a few days. Nice job by the Brooklyn Botanic Garden on getting some top quality food to add to their beautiful setting....",1,0,1,Paul T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,10,0
