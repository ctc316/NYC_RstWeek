4.0,4/25/2019,"This is one of the only actually lovely restaurants in the Macy's to Times Square area. I know a lot of restaurants market themselves as nice, but they're mostly tourist traps around here. Stella 34 is consistently good and the atmosphere is really lovely. I work in midtown west and live on Long Island (ugh) so this was a really good find for me. I can meet friends for dinner before heading home. I don't drink, but the bar there is very pretty, seems like it would be a good meeting place for friends or a date. It can get a bit loud because of the high ceilings but it doesn't matter much. Shaved brussels are amazing.",0,0,0,Steph R.,"Amityville, NY",70,48,2
5.0,4/14/2019,"Highly recommend the veal meatballs! Eggs Benedict brunch option was also very good, eggs perfectly cooked and bread toasted but also soft. The squid ink pasta was very good as well, although it was pretty sour. Wagyu beef tartare was also very good, consisting of small bits of beef mixed with assorted vegetables. I do think the dessert menu needs to be expanded though, none of the options seemed to be very outstanding or particularly special. Service was fast and professional, the lighting and ambience perfect. Noise level was low, although when I went it was fairly empty still (12 pm).",0,0,0,Winnie S.,"Bryn Mawr, PA",199,12,19
3.0,4/8/2019,"The view is what makes this restaurant worthwhile. The service on our visit was below average however. We were sat next to the wait station and a group of four wait staff continued to gather there and either gossip or chat about their personal lives. We could hear them word for word as we were less than a metre away. It's one thing to behave so unprofessionally but on two occasions we were needing their attention while they were all too busy chatting. I'd expect more from the appearance and pricing of this establishment. As for the food, the pizza portion size and price were a positive. The pasta size is smaller and a bit more expensive but still tasty.",0,0,0,Megan J.,"Salisbury Downs, Australia",0,3,0

5.0,3/25/2019,"Fantastic meal and service. Located on the 6th floor of Macy's Herald Square. Amazing views of the Empire State Building, make sure you ask for a seat near the window.We passed on the Prix fixe menu. The meatball app is a must and so is the pizza. I went with the clam pizza which was big enough to share. It was flavorful but a little spicy, ask to go lightly on the red pepper flakes if you are sensitive to spicy foods.The cocktails are pricy at $15.00 each but worth it. You have to definitely get dessert and the gelato was amazing. Highly recommend!",6,2,5,Natty C.,"Hoboken, NJ",502,228,1035

When I walked in, the host greeted me with a smile and a genuine hello and asked me how I was doing. They sat me quickly in a quiet section. My server, Luis, was excellent! He was extremely knowledgeable about the menu, offering many different food and drink suggestions, and answering any questions I may have had. He again, was very friendly and frequently checked up on me. He made an effort to have a genuine conversation with me while staying attentive to the other tables in his section as well.

5.0,2/22/2019,"Was spending the evening in Manhattan around Christmas time window shopping and visiting Bryant Park. Was looking for more than just a quick meal. Wanted something nicer so my husband and I decided to make a reservation at Stella. We were greeted promptly and even seated earlier than our reservation. The waiters were attentive and informative. They made sure our glasses were never empty and there was enough bread on the table at all times. We ordered: Di Verdure Salad, Octopus, Zucca Pizza, Wood Oven Roasted Vegetables, Meatballs, and Ravioli. The food was delicious and well-seasoned (a big plus for my husband's taste buds). The Assistant General Manager, Shari, came over to greet us and made sure we were having a great experience. Try getting a seat by the window for the view for a nice view of the Empire State Building. The feel of the restaurant was nice, trendy, lively, and fun. It's great for a date night, friends, a girls night, or out with the family. It was especially beautifully decorated around the holidays.

4.0,2/18/2019,"I had been here at least 5+ times now and I am surprised that I have not reviewed this restaurant yet.What I like.....- This restaurant is conveniently located for me, right inside Macy's at Herald Square.  Not many restaurants in this area accept reservation.  I always requested a table by the window and they always honored my requests.- It is spacious, clean, modern and has a nice view of Empire State Building.- Once with a group reservation to celebrate my kid's graduation, surprisingly they gave us the private dining room (however, many wait staff came in to use the register)- Management is excellent to respond on any issue- I had tried their pre-fixe lunch, pre-fixe dinner, Valentine special and truffle special menu and they were usually good and reasonable price.- They serve gelato from Italy and they even have rice gelato- food that I love     - butternut squash soup      - calamari     - butternut squash ravioli     - pork belly     - AffogatoWhat it can improve (I like this restaurant and I want it to be successful)- invest into wait staff - I guess there is a lot of turnover.  Some do not offer the pre-fixe menu until we ask.    - 2019 Valentine dinner was disappointing compared to 2018.  Don't know if this was due to being full house compared to last year, but our food and service did not meet our expectation.  First, we did not like the Valentine's menu, not a big deal since we had our favorite items and we ordered from the regular menu.  My butternut squash ravioli was different from the last time I ordered.  This time I got 'wonton' style pasta.  It was doughy and the proportion of stuffing and pasta was just not right.  I don't understand why it was changed if it was an excellent dish before.  The medium rare sirloin steak was not seared properly and came pretty raw.    We got a package of chocolate pancake mix in 2018 which was a nice gesture and they skipped it this year. - I like this place because it was spacious.  For my last visit, our table was very close to the next table.",3,0,1,LoveToEat Z.,"New York, NY",9,315,1169

3.0,2/17/2019,"So for Valentine's Day I wanted to try something different.   Something I haven't thought of before.  So when I saw a restaurant that exists in the most popular Macy's I figured, ""sure"".I'll start by saying I'm adopted and my family is completely Italian and I just got back from my Italy honeymoon.  So expectations of Italian food...the bar is set pretty high.You get to Macy's, it's on the 6th floor tucked away in the back.  It's not necessarily completely visible when you get up the escalator.  You go in, they seat you, definitely has a feel of a Trattoria, but a very large one.  Waiter was super nice, was helpful.  They asked if we wanted bottled or tap water just like in Italy.  Sparkling or still.  We ordered bottled and it was...it was water.They use tongs to hand you a slice of pre sliced bread and had olive oil on the table but did not offer fresh pepper or anything for the olive oil. Bread was, just bread. Nothing too special about it.We opened with Arancini, tiny rice balls that were delightful.We ordered Prosciutto with Mozzarella di Buffala, Egg Plant Parm for me.  So the prosciutto was a little disappointing, but again...I had prosciutto from one of the best places in Italy so, the bar is raised.  The mozz itself was decent.My eggplant parm was definitely tasty and I'm sorry I didn't take a picture of it, but it was sliced paper thin, so I finished it in about thirty seconds.  It was like a thin pancake version of eggplant parm.  Again, delicious but just not my taste in the way it's prepared.Now where it really fell off for me was the cheesecake.  We ordered cheesecake to share for dessert and it was super strange.  Totally it what you would expect from a cheesecake. It had some gelato or ice cream on top which was the best part.",1,0,0,Robert H.,"Queens, NY",570,25,69
5.0,2/11/2019,"Came here for dinner to celebrate a birthday recently and had an amazing evening.First off, the food was delicious! The calamari was fresh and crispy and paired great with the Napoli salad. My date and I shared the lasagna for 2 and a bottle of wine which was all reasonably priced for Herald Square. The service was great, our waitress was super attentive and very friendly. We had one small mishap with our side dish that came out wrong but the manager, Shari, quickly brought out the correct dish. We had left a note on opentable that we were celebrating a birthday but never mentioned anything once we got to the restaurant.Sure enough after dinner the manager had come and brought us dessert and wished me a Happy Birthday.

5.0,2/11/2019,"I'd been meaning to check out Stella 34 for awhile now. While I'm not an enthusiast of Midtown Manhattan, Stella felt like a hidden oasis among the hustle and bustle of Herald Square. Our waiter, attentive and exceptional, seemed well versed on the ins and outs of the menu, and was able to answer all of our questions; we even ordered a couple of his recommendations: the wagyu beef tartare and the zucca pizza. Both were delicious, especially the pizza (butternut squash on pizza, who knew?!). We also ordered the squid ink pasta (my dish) which blew me away. The chili and lemon really added something special to the dish; it was flavorful and absolutely mouth-watering. I had a taste of the pork belly, which I'm definitely going to order next time!For drinks, go for the serrano margarita or the blood orange punch. You won't be disappointed. And for dessert, the apple crumb cake. I'd come back even just for that (and I'm not really a ""dessert person""). Thank you to the wonderful hostess and great staff for really taking care of us.

The servers here kind of suck, they are not too responsive and not friendly either2. Food was mediocre at best. I thought their truffle soup tasted like reheated carton milk with a few drizzles if olive oil. So bad had to exchange it for a salad, which I was happy they complied with.3. A server spilled water all over another customer while he was handing her something... he apologized but this kind of carelessness is evident of the staffs poor training...TLDR; will not go back.",2,1,0,Jenny L.,"Brooklyn, NY",220,102,48

So rule number one is be on time? They don't play.This time we opted for a later lunch and skipped the rush and I'm glad we did! We got to pick the perfect table with the best view of the Empire State building. The service here was pretty standard and our meals were good but nothing amazing.

4.0,1/2/2019,"If you are in midtown (west) or shopping at Macy's than this is a convenient and more than passable restaurant. There really aren't too many decent restaurants around the area so this is a good choice. Yes you have to fight the crowds at Macy's but once you are in the restaurant its worth it.As the menu states all the pasta is made in house and as promised is al dente. There is also a large pizza selection. I think we've gone through the whole pasta menu selections and all have been good. There is a paccheri pasta with a good beef sauce, a good linguini and more than decent eggplant parmigiana.I'm not sure this qualifies as destination dining but if you want a break from shopping than this is a good restaurant.",0,0,0,Ricky D.,"New York, NY",34,131,0

4.0,1/1/2019,"We were looking at the Christmas windows and ended our trip at Macy's, so we decided to eat here. Overall, it was fine, but probably not a place I'd go out of my way to come back to. We arrived about 6:30 and were seated immediately. I opted for the raspberry lime mocktail, which ended up being more cranberry/sprite than raspberry/lime, but it was adequate. I opted for the calamari as my main as I wasn't too hungry, and my fiancée got the shrimp risotto. He quite enjoyed his dish, and it did look very good. The calamari was okay- not tender, but also not quite rubber band consistency. The batter definitely had a spice to it, and I think that improved the overall dish. (Though there were a few ""naked"" pieces, which I found odd.) We didn't wait long for our food or check and our server was pleasant and water always kept filled. The view here, as others have mentioned, is quite nice. On the way out, I did notice they also have a gelato counter- I'll have to keep that in mind when the weather warms up and I'm in the neighborhood.",1,1,1,April H.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,301,373
1.0,12/30/2018,"Just finished dinner here and unfortunately we will not be back. After living in Manhattan for almost a year, my boyfriend and I have eaten at many places in the city and unfortunately this has been the worst dining experience we have had. Our waitress was extremely slow. We were seated at 8:20 and the restaurant wasn't even busy - so I'm still really confused on what the hold up was. The table next to us was seated about 10 minutes after us and received food before us. The food was good - we ordered a pizza and the Anacini (risotto balls). We were looking forward to the dessert menu but our waitress never came back. We sat with empty plates for nearly 10 minutes before anyone came back to check on us. There is just no excuse for this. Especially when there is barely anyone dining. A different waiter finally came to pickup our plates and then returned within 2 minutes with our bill (fastest service we had all night). Unfortunately, we were never asked if we'd like anything else - which we were going to order espresso and gelato. Just save yourself the time and money and go to Serefina or even the McDonald's down the street would have been way better!Also - I find it interesting that the business manager is only replying back to positive comments vs. negative comments.

We paid almost $300 for only half the portion size each entree we got, mind u I have eaten at a ton of Italian restaurants in nyc, as I was born and raised here, but the portions were so small my family said they were still hungry and had to eat at home later... hahaha. O wells, I guess they wanted to make more money and serve kids size portions for everything including pasta which should have been filling I suppose. We ordered the mushroom pasta, clam pasta and risotto, two lobsters, sirloin steak and the two pizzas and more food (which I don't remember)...ordered over 11 items of food.We had 9 people and was still hungry afterwards. Def not a place to get full in I guess... prob would not come here next time as there are many other good choices here in nyc! The waiter was not so attentive as well, my sister in law found a fly in her glass of water at the table. The waiter said the fly was thirsty lol , but it worries me as he didn't take that too seriously. And worries me about the other foods as well.Also I called in about rsvp two hours ahead and we arrived on time and we waited 20 mins for a table still, we sat by the bar and no one offered us water, which I thought should be common courtesy ....Would I recommend this place- yes for the views and decor but NO for the food and service and value!!

The only negative review I have is that the wait between getting our initial first drink and between getting odinner courses were slightly on the long side. Other than that, it's all up hill from there. The drinks were very good and well crafted. We had the Ricotta Fritters as our appetizer. They perfectly fried yet light and airy at the same time. For dinner, we had the butternut squash raviolis and sheep's milk ricotta stuffed agnolotti. Both were house-made, simple yet had big flavors. Definitely would recommend both dishes and appetizer as well. And last was the dessert. We had the apple crumb cake that was infused with a hint of basil and topped with a creme gelato. The hint of herbaceous basil played very well with the sweetness and creaminess of the rest of the dish.

Both the Risotto and the Eggplant Parm were delicious. The Eggplant Parm may have been a smidge better than the Risotto but both were excellent dishes. The tiramisu was very creamy and amazing!

No. We were told to arrive 20 minutes before our 8:15 reservation, but we weren't allowed in until 8:20. Try asking little kids to patiently wait for 30 minutes, at that point I deserved a portion of the gratuity. When we were finally in the pastries were already set on the table and they were okay. Nothing to brag about. Croissant was really sweet. And, was that even a New York bagel? The scallion cream cheese was delicious. Granola yogurt delicious. But was I oooing and awwweing, nope. The kids received hot chocolate that was amazing! We were then served cornmeal pancakes, the crispiest stringiest hash ever, and sausage and bacon. We left most of the food, it wasn't good. Our server was so busy, that we sat without any drinks for a long time. I ran up to the bar and grabbed my own Bellinis. Server was nice, but not worth the gratuity you paid. What really killed the experience was how unorganized it was. I was told to wait until someone came and led me to take my pictures with Santa. I waited a LOOONG time. Then I finally gave up, got up, and took my pictures. The greatest part of this experience was meeting Santa. He truly made this experience beautiful and worth it. The balloon guy and the cupcakes we took home was cute too. Will I ever do this again here. Never. Cost was $218 for a family of 4 and gratuity was included. This was a silver seating.

Cons: The shrimp risotto dish was poorly executed from the flavor to the texture (huge chunks of un-chopped artichoke hearts in risotto was a bad idea), and the small amount of shrimp was underwhelming (it seemed like 2-3 shrimp were cut into bite size pieces and added to the dish). To add, our waiter was not very attentive (never came over to ask how was our meal after the food runners delivered our food, only came to fill our water more than halfway through the meal, we were not offered dessert, and immediately rushed to offer us the check, and we had to correct asking for the dessert menu).

My brother ordered a steak  medium and Jonathan our server realized by one glance it was over cooked and took it back. We were so happy because he made the experience for us.

From his first stop at the table, to getting the check, he was enthusiastic, very attentive, and made great recommendations. I had the agnolotti which were absolutely perfect! My 3 dining companions were also delighted with their meals. I also had the lemon gelato desert recommended by Thiago. It was a delicious ending to our meal. I will be sure to recommend Stella 34 to my friends and I will not hesitate to make repeated visits to this fine establishment when in the vicinity.

4.0,10/27/2018,"Ok, so I don't normally eat at restaurants inside of department stores; do you? Well, let me tell you how I ended up at Stella in the first place. Over the years, Macy's has been my go-to spot for last minute fashions when my wardrobe says ""not tonight"" - and recently, they launched a rewards/loyalty program of which I am a Bronze member. So with that being said I recently received an invite for a day of glam at Macy's Herald Square. The ask was simple, you spend one hour with a stylist (I got Joe, he was amazing) and you received a $100 gift card (you and your guest) to Stella's and a $25 Macy's card as well. As you can see, I took full advantage of this opportunity. So much so that I went back the following day. As for Stella's, what can I say, the food and service was superb. Honestly, I didn't care to much for the layout of the restaurant but other then that, the next time at the midtown Macy's, I'll probably make an afternoon of it and have dinner upstairs in the restaurant. I was able to enjoy several dishes and I must say, the pomegranate lemonade was delicious. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to great service and excellently prepared food.

4.0,10/22/2018,"I was looking for an Italian restaurant to take a friend who was in town from Penn Station. The location is ideal and is only a few minutes from the station so it's a great bet if you're in need of such a place.You can get to the restaurant via the escalators or the elevator. If you use the escalator, go to the 6th floor and be sure to go to the back. All the signage can be a bit confusing but once you turn right when you get off the escalator, keep walking and you should see it. I had a reservation but it didn't seem too packed and likely could have got a seat if we just walked in. It's a bit of a hidden gem, perhaps?The view of the city is lovely and the decor is modern and chic. I'm sure the night views are especially breathtaking but the daytime view was splendid too.Now, for the food. Can't speak to anything but the lunch menu --specifically  the pasta and the gelato, which were both fantastic. I had the Shrimp Risotto and my friend had the Agnolotti and both were good though I preferred my Rizotto. We also had the pear and almond crunch gelato and both were excellent. I was a bit worried about the service given some of the reviews I saw earlier, but those most have been off days because the service was impeccable. The waiter was patient and attentive but could also tell that we were having a catch up so left us be -- showing presence of mind. We spent two lovely hours there and never felt rushed at any point.

Risotto has a disgusting aftertaste that left me running to find something sweet afterward so I would not throw up. Kids Spaghetti was barely cooked. Stomach still feels nauseous even after leaving.

Why is it so bland, overpriced and boring? My major complaint is about tipping, though. New York City service workers feel they -deserve- a tip for their subpar work. So far, I have not been impressed by service in these restaurants. Particularly this one. I couldn't imagine begging my customers for extra money for literally doing an average job.When I didn't tip, this Indian boy asked me if I'd like to leave something extra. I told me no and he stared at me like I slapped him Mom. I told him the food wasn't good, and I had to sit next to three Koreans who were extremely loud which ruined my romantic evening. Besides that, all he did was bring me menus and a crappy pizza. Hey, thanks. Here's more money! What a joke. Get real, NYC. Your service industry sucks.",2,2,1,Bronson A.,"Bothell, WA",0,42,0

Lots of truffle slices. Other choice Osso buco of veal with fresh corn polenta and black truffle jus. Veal was very tender.. fresh corn a little too sweet. Would have liked dried polenta better.

5.0,3/14/2018,"Definitely a hidden gem on Macy's 34th Street 6th Fl. I was taken here to have dinner and I must say my friend made an excellent choice. We arrived here roughly around 5pm with no reservation and were immediately seated. I forgot to ask the first waitress for her name but I definitely remember her by her crystal blue eyes, blonde hair and angelic personality. She had asked first if we wanted tap or sparkling water. She then proceeded to give us sufficient time to review the menu. By the time she was back, my friend ordered a drink which seemed vibrant (eye catching) and as per his opinion, the drink was amazing not too sour or sweet just right in the middle. Finally, we ordered away! For a small plate we had octopus with chili flakes accompanied by a chick pea salad. I ordered the beef rigatoni and my friend ordered branzino. The presentation on the plates was beyond exquisite and the food was nothing short of flavorful. One thing that truly made this experience unforgettable was the attention. My cup of water kept on getting refilled numerous times (about eight) and never did my cup go empty and never did I feel like the waitress was intrusive. Sadly, our lovely waitress' shift was over but then came Angelina! She was really sweet and definitely attentive. As for the remainder of our dinner, we satisfied our sweet tooth with Tiramisu and we were honored to be complimented by the chef with sorbet. In addition, I had ordered the ruby sipper (tea) which was recommended by Angelina. The tea was the perfect blend of flowers and just the correct temperature (not too hot where you burn your tongue). In essence, my friend and I absolutely had a remarkable experience. The staff definitely soared to transcend expectations and I will absolutely be recommending this to colleagues, friends and family.",1,0,0,Andrea M.,"Jamaica, NY",1,30,33
1.0,3/4/2018,"If you are lookoing for an overpriced Italian low class eatery with very limited menu options and exceedingly rude staff, this place will fulfil your desires plentifully.I had a misfortune of bringing my parents in law who traveled to NYC from China to this unbelievably low standard joint. Granted the view out of the window was impressive and the ambience was welcoming, the rest of the criteria you could possibly use to evaluate a restaurant could be rated 0 out of 10 on every count. Out of the desire to show off personal wealth and financial independence, one might argue that the decision to waste $200 on a dinner doesn't come easy. However, when you are trying to impress your parents in law, the logic goes: ""It is worth it, as long as you get high-end experience you expect"". Well... not at this restaurant...Here is the step by step breakdown:- we walked in were greeted and seated as expected- asked for 4 hot waters since it was freezing outside (it is a Chinese thing with the water: healthy, warms you up, and free). At this point the server raised her eyebrows as if I just ordered one meal and 4 forks.- water came in dirty cups with unidentified black particles floating around and reeks chlorine- I took a trip to the bathroom while my fiance placed the order. I told her to proceed ordering without me since I did not my parents in law waiting. While I was in the bathroom the chef informed them that he will not proceed with the order until I return because all orders supposed to come in and get served together. Wait what? After we have expressed our reasonable concern, the server said she would ask a manager to come and resolve the issue. Manager did not come and instead sent the server back with a message that 'as an exception' they will take orders at different times.- under pasta section there was a meal with shrimp which I wanted. But the server explained to me that it came with a side of rice. I said that I would like a different side. The server said it is impossible. I challenged her logic by saying that if the side is available and the shrimp is availble, it is quiet possible to combine them. She said she would call a manager to resolve the issue again. The manager however did not find this issue worth his time and once again sent the server back with another message: yes, as an exception  they could exchange a side (something that would be done without hassle at any Fridays or Applbees or any other more casual places).- at that time my fiance asked the server that perhaps I could get another meal with shrimp. Her response was: ""it is all in the menu, just read""- i decided not to order anything at this point only because it because it seemed too much trouble for the staff to accomodate customers.- the manager showed up by the time we were finishing up eating what we had and asked if everything tasted well. He was given an honest answer that everything indeed tasted well, although any other concerns were never addresses despite the manager's full awareness of the situation.- I never leave no tip. If the service was unsatisfactory I usually leave 10-15% and if I liked everything 25%. In this case, I left no tip and wrote a message on the receipt hoping it would reach somebody in this business who cares at least a little bit.",5,0,0,Arthur B.,"San Diego, CA",73,26,11

Yay.   I was worried that it would feel rushed and noisy but as soon as you walk behind the grey curtains that delineate the restaurant entrance it's a different vibe.  To your left are enormous windows with great midtown views and to your right is a busy (5 PM) bar and open kitchen. We were seated right away, there is ample seating.  The server was very professional; our water was always full, cutlery replaced, and table swept up between courses. She was very friendly and helpful without being intrusive and cloying. We got the verdure to start, along with the complimentary bread choices. We asked for an entree to share for two and were recommended the lasagna per due. I don't know how you'd say 4 in Italian but that's about how many people that dish is really for. Or bring a bigger stomach. Left overs came home to make room for dessert. Dessert options are varied but we stuck to affogato which was poured over tableside. Nice touch. Pleasant surprise.

Tonight, I had a delicious focaccia appetizer with broccoli rabe; spicy parpadelle with a neat sauce--at this point I was quite full, but the short rib was just ""one"" piece, so no problem at this point.

3.0,1/14/2018,"I like Stella, in fact I have been there quite a few times, but lately, it's been hit or miss. While we have had some good meals in the past I was super disappointed by the experience I had today, mainly because of service issues. I made a reservation through Open table, and when we got there we were a little early, but they accommodated our table anyway, which we appreciated. When we got to the table, the hostess made a point to tell us that they aren't really all the busy on weekends, so I was surprised that we didn't see the waiter or have menus or water brought over for about 10 minutes. When the waiter did come over, he didn't really interact, he just kind of gave us the menu's--I still don't even know his name. From there on, the experience just kind of became about trying to hunt down the waiter---first to order, then for olive oil to go with bread, then to get more water. In fact, he wasn't even the person who dropped the meals--another team member did. Our waiter ran by the table and shouted ""Bon Appetit"" before ducking behind a curtain. He never came back. Not to check on us, not for refills, not for salt and pepper, not for anything. In fact, I had to flag down and ask somebody else for both the check and a box. There were plenty of times the waiter, and other staff members, walked passed the table and nobody checked on us.

3.0,1/10/2018,"I had fond memories of enjoying my first meal at Stella 34 Trattoria and was eager to refresh those thoughts with a subsequent visit.  Upon first glance, the restaurant felt like an elegant cafeteria, located in the corner of Macy's 6th floor Home department.  However, we were lucky enough to get a table by the window, overlooking Herald Square, which elevated the vibe (literally) and allowed us to forget that we were dining in a department store.  We decided not to order any beverages on this trip, saving our funds for an array of dishes from their alluring menu.  We placed our order and sat back to tease our taste buds with slices of sesame semolina and white Italian breads.  The seeds on the semolina made it much more flavorful than the other variety, but both could have been softer and fresher.  We started with the Verdure and Polpettine appetizers.  The first consisted of wood-oven roasted brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and golden raisins, which had been baked in a pine nut agrodolce.   This sweet sauce formed a light caramel over the vegetables, making them appealing to even the most carnivorous diner.  However, I found the included pine nuts to have a bit of an old, dusty flavor that interfered with my love of the heavenly brussels.  The second appetizer was a plate of three Veal Meatballs, served over a slightly funky sheep's milk ricotta and covered with a sweet and chunky tomato sauce.  The spheres of meat were slightly dense, but extremely flavorful; and I really enjoyed the marinara.  When it came to selecting main courses, we skipped the pizza and sandwiches, ordering our carbs in pasta form instead.  The Spaghettini Alla Vongole began with angel hair pasta that was topped with cockles, chopped clams, yellow tomato, garlic, anchovy, chili, lemon zest, bottarga, and bread crumbs.  The spaghetti was cooked well, but the remaining ingredients were added haphazardly.  The cockle shells were empty; my one clam nugget was miniscule and tough; and the tomato skins were all that I could see.  Perhaps the tomato's juices were used in the light broth on the pasta, but I would have liked more of the fruit than just its skins.  The dish had some great spice from the added chili, though.  My brother had even proclaimed, ""This is good, but something is missing...""  Well, I told him that it was not the flavor, but the substance!  The Linguine Al Funghi was certainly a heartier dish, with its inclusion of fresh, wild mushrooms; spinach; and stracciatella.  The rich mushroom broth and creamy cheese melded together to form a light alfredo-type, cream sauce that made us feel indulgent.I was definitely surprised by the level of creativity and flavors on Stella 34 Trattoria's menu, given its location.  Despite some minor improvements that could be made, the restaurant offered a nice haven from the shopping madness and making it worthy of a 3.5-star rating.",2,0,1,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

It seemed like the place to grab something fresh. I was not greeted or seated in a professional and friendly matter. After we sat the waitress asked me if I wanted a drink. I ordered a lemonade type of drink, she came back with another drink with cranberry and told me she made a mistake in the order but wanted me to try it anyways an of I didn't like it she would change it back to my original request. So I tried it, hated it and thought that was weird. A pregnant woman knows what she wants. Right behind me I saw the brick pizza ovens and thought let's order some pizza! We ordered a vegetable pie. There were beans and peas on it. It was terrible! The veggies were undercooked and bland. No flavor what so ever. I expressed my thoughts to te waitress and we ordered a regular cheese pie. My child decides she wants spaghetti. So we order from the kids menu spaghetti and sauce on the side. I was shocked that they actually would serve that to someone! The spaghetti was so thick like noodles and rubbery it had been microwaved, I flipped it and touched it in the bottom and it was frozen! I asked the waitress and she had the audacity to look me in the face and tell me that they don't microwave their food and that they don't even have a microwave in the building. I didn't want to start problems so I calmly told my daughter not to eat it. By that time our second pizza pie arrived which we had one slice of, it tasted ok but it was so watery and the dough was so under baked it was just slimy and disgusting.

3.0,8/31/2017,"After registering for our wedding in Macy's all morning, we were famished and came across this cute little spot on the 6th floor - nicely decorated and with a pretty view over Herald Square, so we decided to stop for some lunch and a cocktail.Overall, the food wasn't bad, just overpriced for what it was. They start you off with some bread and olive oil which was tasty but not warm or anything special, but good regardless. I had a mimosa and he had a vodka soda to start, priced as you'd expect for Macy's in Herald Square of New York City I suppose. I had the appetizer size Caesar salad with chicken and he had the oven baked chicken sandwich. The salad was plain, mostly tasted like lemon and lettuce, not very flavorful and I wish the chicken was grilled rather than pulled roasted chicken, it just would have given it a bit more flavor. More cheese or croutons or something would have helped too. It was the perfect size for lunch, I couldn't imagine eating a large one in the middle of the day! The chicken sandwich was a tastier option but pretty odd, almost like a mix between and panini and quesadilla? Strange but good flavor.It was a pricey lunch and I can't say I'd like to eat it again, it's a pretty cool space and clearly a tourist spot but, since we live here and know there is much better food nearby, and so we won't be returning (except for maybe the gelato next door?!) but if you're trapped and hungry, it's a decent spot and the pizza is probably the way to go!",3,0,0,Shaina F.,"New York, NY",75,281,371

So we just ordered our food off the regular menu. I got the 'hangover pizza' which was amazing. Both me and my boyfriend loved it.

2.0,7/18/2017,"The entrance to this restaurant is from Macy's corner. Go inside and take the escalators up to the 6th floor.Came here on a gloomy, drizzly Friday evening after work. The place was half empty. Sat by the window with a view on the backs of a few skyscraper offices. The interior has a cozy, upscale, clean decor and vibe. Pleasantly quiet and relaxing.Our waitress was lovely and several waiters and even a manager dropped by to check on us. No comments about the swift and courteous service. The food was overpriced--which is to be expected in Herald Square & Macy's areas. We ordered calzone pizza. It was not worth $18. It was bland and underwhelming. The dough was tasty, but there was barely any stuffing of cheese, arugula, olives, and prosciutto inside. Small sized pie/pocket. A disappointment. Enjoyed the complementary bread and extra virgin olive oil from the table much more. Their coffees and teas are solid, but nothing extraordinary and definitely not worth the price. The highlight was the gelato. Got medium cup with two flavors for $7. The cup is tiny and barely holds the two minimal scoops. The strawberry flavor is a miss--has a very chemical & unnatural taste and was too sweet. Yuk, left a horrible aftertaste. The pistachio was the save. Perfectly creamy and rich, not overly sweet. Could've ate a bucket of that pistachio gelato. Get it if you're craving a solid end to your meal here. All other desserts are overpriced at $10 apiece for underwhelming cheesecake of small piece of pie.Overall, a nice facility but overpriced and underwhelming food. You can find better for your money.

It also took an hour to get bread, and it wasn't even crowded... we were a party of 8, and for some reason it was just so impossible for the staff to serve us. My mom's iced tea didn't even come until our food came. The waiters here for sure need training, because I don't think it should take an hour to get bread that should be there after you get your drinks. We knew something was up with the service when our waiter didn't even write down our orders down for our drinks. We had to ask for thing like parmesan cheese 3 times from 3 different people. If it was crowded these people would be in a huge pickle. I could go on and on about what went wrong but if you have a lunch break for work and you want to be an hour and a half late, go here!

Pretty decadent, and really delicious! The main course was a wood oven grilled halibut cooked to perfection, flaky, moist, totally delicious. Came with peas and morel mushrooms, preserved lemon sauce. To top off this scrumptious lunch was a créma caramella di nociolla.

The interior, the views, the service, the food were absolutely first-rate. The margherita pizza was really good and my guests enjoyed their various pasta dishes a lot. The staff were super professional and so sweet that they were able to accommodate a surprise birthday dessert that my sister and brother organized - first, the yummy robiola cheesecake, followed by cupcakes (from elsewhere) with their ice cream in the middle.

To me, it would already have a built customer base that to really pull in non-shoppers it has to be good because why the hell would you even try to combat 6 floors of shoppers to come eat here? But alas, the food is really yummy. The low point to the meal...our service. It took far too long to get our initial glasses of wine. Our appetizer arrived just seconds after our wine and that should have come out much sooner. Especially since we ordered our wines well before any food. I imagine it was a bit slow cause of the holiday season traffic...The verdure appetizer was delicious. I also loved my mushroom fettuccine! Mmmmmm. It was homemade and full of flavor.

The entire experience from start to finish was just delightful.We came without reservations and we were promptly seated. I could see this place could get crowded but it wasn't when we were there. The view from the restaurant is beautiful, you can see the Empire State Building from the huge Windows and the ambiance is very modern, whites, grays and brick ovens galore! They started us off with a few pieces of bread and there is a carafe of olive oil to dip, which is a nice touch.We ordered the arancini, fried risotto balls with sausage and tomato sauce. These were fantastic. I'm a huge fan of rice balls in general and these did not disappoint. The sausage inside the arancini was to die for.For dinner we both got their pizza. My husband ordered the margarita pie and I ordered the vongolle pie, which had clams, bread crumbs, cheese, and red pepper flakes with like a kind of cream sauce. My pie was so amazing!!! Literally one the of the best pies I've ever had and it was definitely because of the dough they use. I even had to ask our waiter if they made their own dough or get it from somewhere. He said that a lot of ingredients the chef uses are imported from Naples Italy which makes sense of why it is so good and the dough is made in house. I actually ate every bit of the crust of the pie which I never ever do because it was that good. My husband loved his classic pie and I am ashamed to say we both finished our pies! Which is really just not necessary and disgusting but they were that good. Also our service was on point. Our server was quick and friendly. All in all we really enjoyed our experience here and the food is just awesome. If you are in the area you definitely need to make a stop here to get one of their pies.

4.0,12/1/2016,"My family and I visited Stella the day after Thanksgiving for lunch. It was perfect timing because the entire store was filled with Christmas decorations and joy. The restaurant is actually located within the Herald Square Macy's, the 6th floor if I recall correctly. It has a very clean, sleek design with an open kitchen for diners to witness the food being made (which I always appreciate so you know how clean and fresh your meal preparation is). We ordered the combo meat and cheese plate to start. I may be biased because I don't think you can ever go wrong with prosciutto, peppered salami and cheese but it was divine. Watching the chefs slice the prosciutto right near me had me drooling.The hard part was deciding what to have for lunch since every passing dish looked scrumptious. We decided on the veal meatball sandwich, the salami pizza and an all veggie salad (sorry I can't recall the exact name of the salad, as everything was in mainly Italian). I didn't have the salad but my dad had no complaints. I did have the pizza and sandwich. The veal meatballs were perfectly cooked and not to ""gamey"" with tons of sauce. The pizza was thin crust with just the right balance of cheese to sauce to topping ratio.

1.0,11/28/2016,Macys should be ashamed to have this establishment in its signature store. The service was beyond horrible. We sat at the bar and proceeded to wait 15 minutes before anyone even looked at us and then we still had to ask to be waited on. We also asked that he clear away the dirty dishes in front of us. I asked if the happy hour applied on Saturdays and he gave us a happy hour menu. The bartender then proceeded to ignore us for another 15 minutes by stocking the bar and wiping down glasses. I thought it was customary to wait on the customers first. We then asked someone else to take our order and he was beyond annoyed to be helping us. We asked for the happy hour drinks and were told happy hour does not apply on Sat. So why did the other bartender give us the happy hour menu?? AT that point we were so disgusted we left and no one cared one bit. I have eaten here before and the bar service has always been snobby but never this bad.

Then the shrimp dish was super salty and the quality of shrimp was just mediocre. They should serve this dish with some grain or a basket of bread, but they come around with thinly sliced sandwich bread looking loaves.Service was really friendly though, and our server was very accommodating. $85 for a very underwhelming lunch -- not recommended unless you are starving.

The manager, and other employees, jumped right to break it up...glass broke, as well as bottle of wine that stained the manager's suit jacket.  The waiter apologized for the disruption and things got back to normal pretty quickly.  Unfortunately, that's the memory I have of this place.  I would give them another chance if in the area, but would not make a special trip out there.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place to others...nor would I discourage someone from go here.  I'm neutral :) Happy Yelping",9,6,8,Joey A.,"Brooklyn, NY",455,134,649
3.0,11/7/2016,"For a place with lovely reviews, I was quite disappointed with the service. Our server not only forgot our drink orders (6 waters and 1 Diet Coke), but also mixed up our orders when serving us. The wait between the appetizers and the main course was also quite long (20-30 minutes). The food, however, was all fresh very fresh and well prepared. The duck liver pate was wonderful, and the calamari was fried in a crispy way where it didn't feel like it was soaked with oil. We tried the whole assortment of their pasta primi dishes, and were quite pleased. For pizza, however, we tried the funghi and vongole pizzas - I loved the sauce on the vongole, but was a bit disappointed with how flimsy the pizza itself was.

All white, very clean but not a fancy one, almost cafeteria style, but the view is amazing. We were seated by the window over looking the Empire State Building and watched it change colors as the sun went down. The service was very good, and informative. I asked which pasta dish was better the Rigatoni or the Paccheri Napolitana, I was told both were good but the Rigatoni was made with buckwheat pasta and some thought a bit chewy. I decided on the Paccheri. This was with a beef ragu and caramelized onions and Parmigiano-Reggiano, surprisingly one of the best pasta dishes I've ever eaten. We decided to get the Bistecca, wood oven roasted prime rib with charred marinated treviso and roasted Yukon potatoes, this dish was as good as any 5 star steakhouse in Manhattan. This restaurant is privately owned and is not part of Macy's, they just rent the space. It's very large and by 7pm was packed. They have 3 wood burning pizza ovens imported from Naples and next time I have to try their many choices of pizza. Great hidden gem to stop in when shopping midtown to have a very tasty meal.

We also tried the smoked salmon appetizer, which we thought was small and not terribly interesting. Our entrees were the osso bucco made with lamb (!), very good but the accompanying vegetable purée came out like soup; and the eggplant, which was baked to perfection, but with a wholly uninteresting tomato sauce.For dessert, we had chocolate and hazelnut gelato (hazelnut was better), and the tiramisu.Unfortunately, we had to wait about 15 minutes for our cocktails to arrive after ordering, and there was a relatively long pause between the appetizers and entrees.

The place is on the 6th floor of Macy's and as soon as you step off the elevator you are there.   The decor is very stylish and airy with large windows with spectacular views of the Empire State Building.    For starter at our waiters suggestion we got the Arancini which was three small rice balls with sausage and mozzarella filling. The presentation was very nice and the arancini were rather light and tasty but nothing amazing and the tomato sauce was weak.    For a main I got the Vongole pizza which was clams,creme fraiche,roasted garlic,chili pepper flakes and preserved lemon. The pizza was good despite two major issues 1) the clams were all but invisible,barely there and not lending any of the briny,sweet taste they are known for and 2) an over dose of chili flakes, now I like heat hell I grow my own Ghost chili's but this was just overpowering the other tastes. The balance was thrown off and I was scraping them off. The star of the pie was the preserved lemon as it really brightened everything up. The garlic was crunchy and the sauce was good. The crust was very nicely done. Light and crispy. With more clam and less pepper this could've been an all time great pie. Would be willing to try another kind next time.    The Princess got a salad and the big problem here was most of the lettuce was limp and in a few pieces rotting. I called over our server who offered to make her a new one which she felt bad but they talked her into it. The next one was a bit better but the greens still seemed limp.

Had a beautiful pasta dish, but the pasta was way too al dente. I was actually concerned that the extra chewy noodles were going to give me a stomach ache but I convinced myself to eat it because I figured the extra chew would provide more fiber :P Really, the 3 stars are for the fun, business chic ambiance of the place and reasonable price of the food.

We started the meal with Arancini- fried sausage balls with ricotta, fried calamari and marinara, and Verdura- roasted Brussels sprouts and cauliflower with pine nuts. The pizze were too tempting to resist- the diavoli was spicy with sliced sausage and tomato sauce, the margherita was simple and oozing mozzarella, the primavera was proof that peas and asparagus belong on pizza, and my personal favorite, the funghi was loaded with a variety of savory mushrooms. Come for the view, stay for the fantastic Italian food.",0,0,0,Elizabeth H.,"Manhattan, NY",161,4,2

Many of the waiters were upset with the manager because reservations were being made for as late as 10pm even though the restaurant closed at 9:30. The staff were so angry and kept talking amongst each other so often that I wasn't given a refill until I finished my food and we never got a straw or silverware.

Too bad. For a 14 dollar glass of wine one would expect to taste the wine first but this was not the case here. Service below par...think they are understaffed.

It also has a nice modern touch to it and offers some pretty awesome views of the empire state building. Definitely a great place to come if shopping at Macys. I had one of their personal pizzas and an order of calamari. Both were very good. The pizza was fairy think crust and was the perfect size for one person. The calamari tasted fresh and the sauce that accompanied it was very good. They also have a pretty good cocktail menu to accompany the meal. Overall a very cool spot that I never knew existed here.

Not at all-- not even close. Was it fine? It was fine. The place has a weird quasi upscale meets Barnes & Noble Bookstore Cafe vibe.. but it serves drinks.

I decided to eat vegetarian, and started with the cauliflower soup and the verdure for appetizers.   They came right away.  The soup was good- creamy with black truffle- but a little bland.  The verdure, however, was horrible.   Undercooked Brussel sprouts and way too much garlic.  After 30 minutes, and our server disappearing, we finally flagged our, apparently, nee server down to check on our food.  The manager came over and apologized and said it wouldn't be more than 3 minutes.  It came right away and I must say that my eggplant parmesian was excellent.  My husband got the shredded pork pasta and loved it.  My son also loved what he got, but he said he waited so long that he forgot what he ordered.   Bottom line: if you've got the time, go ahead.",0,0,1,Rena M.,"Vista, CA",393,78,2

The Arancini had a nice crunch to it with the melty mozzarella in the middle. The sauce that came with it complemented it well. Calamari was also nicely done. Normally squid can be really tough when not cooked properly or of poor quality, but the calamari here was soft and tender with a flaky crispy coating.

3.0,2/2/2016,"Nestled inside Macy's of Herald Square, entering through the Louis Vuitton side of the department store will lead you straight to the elevators and to the 6th floor. Our party of 3 didn't have reservations but to my surprise the weekday lunch hour was bustling with people, but we were seated within five minutes. The entire dining space was filled within the next hour we were there. Maybe because it was restaurant week there were many guests or maybe they are popular for lunch anyway, who knows. First, the artistic wall paintings and the pizzas being fired up in the back caught my attention, but then the view from the 6th floor wasn't shabby either. We quickly decided to settle on the three course restaurant week menu, as the items appeared to be on their regular menu as well after perusing through the two sided paper menu. We each had a share of everything we ordered including the zuppa di cavolfiori  (cauliflower and black truffle soup, rosemary salt, garlic crouton), ravioli di taleggio (taleggio stuffed pasta, brown butter, red endive, hazelnut), pizza di parmigiana di melanzane (tomato, eggplant, mozzarella, parmigiano reggiano, basil), pan d'oro (lemon glazed sweet cake, lemon zabaglione, dried fruit compote), & millefoglie di melanzane (sweet roasted eggplant, brown butter financier, milk chocolate and hazelnut mousse). The zuppa was creamy and delectable with hints of black truffle. The ravioli was also one of the highlights of the meal as the taleggio cheese was rich. The pizza was unfortunately a disappointment...very bland, unremarkable crust and didn't carry the flavor expected. The desserts were also nothing to write home about, especially that the lemon glazed sweet cake wasn't even cake...it was a brioche with lemon flair. That I couldn't bring myself to finish along with the pizza. I also wished that our meal was not 2.5 hours...it would be impossible for those to come in during a typical lunch break.

For a tourist experience this could have been a disaster for my kids. Hello, an amazing A cappella group sang Christmas carols to us while the waitress was taking our drink order. Can you say Balenie for breakfast. It wasn't the best Balenie I've had, but I like their version.We ordered the breakfast pizza.... Strange version of pizza with a egg yolks on top. The pie was actually pretty good.The poached eggs were amazing as was the frittata.But the best part was the pastries they served before breakfast. I'm talking flaky mouthwatering yummy croissants, plain and dark chocolate, shortbread scones with all the fixings and various other delightful bits of yumminess.When Santa came to visit, he remembered exactly Who are our children are.

4.0,12/4/2015,"Ahhhhhhhhhhhh. Yes, that's a sigh of relief. I was looking through my Yelp photos looking for something happy. Seems like the two reviews I wrote today brought me down lolStella! I love love love Stella. Nestled in Macy's Herald Square department store 6th floor is this nice restaurant with views of the Empire State Building and the madness down below lol. Make sure to ask for a window seat, you won't regret the bit of wait. We ordered their arancini, two kinds of pasta and the shrimp entree to share. The risotto balls are delicious, moist rice held together by mozzarella and sausage. We got the Creste Di Gallo and Paccheri Napolitana. The first pasta as our nice server mentioned was named after the way the pasta was shaped like a rooster's comb. It had rock  shrimp with a spicy sauce. Pretty good, but I liked the second pasta better. It's a simple beef tagu with parmigiano-reggiano. Simple yet really satisfying.The Scampi I would say is not your average Shrimp scampi from Red Lobster lol. It comes with  about three pieces huge shrimp. Don't be afraid to suck those shrimp heads people, every flavor is in there. And yes, we sucked the heck out of those. Reallllllllllll good! Weirdly tho they come resting in what looks like soup or broth. Menu said ""seared prawn escarole white bean brodo de herba marina, roasted garlic, chili, lemon"". It was ok but that great Shrimp saved it. To top the meal we got gelato. Vivoli gelato! Ok, I must admit, what got me to finally want to come here was this. We missed this in Florence. We searched hi and low for this when we went on vacation and when we finally got there, it was closed for the week. August is the time for Italians to go on vacation and establishments apparently go on vacation as well. And Vivoli was on vacation those days we were there. Sooooooooo that means I got nothing to compare the American Vivoli. In any case, it was still great. The chocolate I can probably do without, but definitely get the hazelnut. Did I say it yet?

Everything was delicious, perfectly seasoned, and cooked exceptionally well. I would definitely recommend these dishes. My favorite out of the three is the linguini ai funghi.

At this point we decided to just order pizzas and everyone is going to share because those shouldn't take to long...wow were we wrong! It took well over 35+ minutes to get 3 wood fire pizzas seriously way too long.  Well then it clicked...we went on a pizza tour earlier in the week and the guide said never order pizza in Manhattan because it's full of grease because of all the processed crap they use and yes this pizza was full of grease and drowning in olive oil...it wasn't disgusting but nothing like you get out in Brooklyn.

The appetizers are amazing: definitely recommend the risotto meatballs and a salami/cheese plate (we had mozarella (sp), goat cheese thing, pork salami, fennel salami). Duck liver pate was also awesome! Entrees less impressive. We had rotisserie chicken and spaghetti with pulled pork. Chicken was great, but the spaghetti overly salted, like many places are doing these days, and as I said in another review, all the more puzzling given the NYC Department of Health's major ""push"" to lower sodium (I'll save the debate on the quality of the anti-sodium evidence for another time). Here's how bad that was: I ended up with drymouth about an hour afterwords, then had to wait another 40 minutes before I got off the subway to get some water. That's a total of 100 minutes of drymouth.Why another star off? Service really spotty. Forgot to bring my ice tea, plus it's really hard to hail a server if you need stuff like more bread. Dessert also took forever. ""How hard is it to slice a cheesecake,"" asked person next to me? INDEED.

Diners were mainly female, but if there were males with them, they were very posh. The hostess was really nice and seated us as soon as my friend arrived. We got booth seating - woot!Things we ordered:Linguini Al Funghi - my friend's mushroom linguini was a very small portion. She said it was tasty but definitely not worth $21. I was actually embarrassed that my portion was about double hers. They should increase the pasta in this dish, because then it's super awkward when one person at the table has a small dish!Salad Di Verdure - endive, green beans, cauliflower, tomato, radish, shaved brussels sprouts, crispy shallots, pine nuts, golden raisins, red wine vinaigrette. I added chicken to it, which was a $5 charge. I thought the portion was large, but the ingredients just weren't fresh, and were actually kind of soggy and lame. Maybe I caught them on a bad day, but I thought the salad was just mediocre.

4.0,8/9/2015,"I ate here before the final night of the U2 i+e tour at MSG.  It is literally right around the corner from the Garden and the reviews (which I have come to rely heavily upon) seemed very positive.  Finding the restaurant was a little complicated (mostly because I came in from the 34th street side).  Once I found it I was a little taken aback by the bright white interior.  It's a lot of marble...nice, but it took me a few to get used to.  We were promptly seated with our reservation and had a great window seat looking up at the Empire State Building.  The food was good.  It wasn't what we were looking for, but it wasn't bad at all.  Servers are very attentive, drinks very good, and there's an elevator in the restaurant that takes you straight down to street level...I wish I would have know that before my adventure through home goods in Macy's.  I'd go back and have an appetizer and a drink, but I think I am more of a southern Italian fan.  You should absolutely give this a try though.",1,0,0,Brian C.,"Sanibel Island, FL",2,27,45
4.0,8/7/2015,"I had an excellent time here! I waited at the bar for my friend to arrive and I enjoyed a bloody mary. The drink took quite some time to make but it was ultimately worth the wait. A bit pricy at $15 but definitely what I expected for Midtown in a somewhat upscale place.We ordered two appetizers, risotto balls and an octopus over mashed chickpeas.The risotto and cheese balls were out of this world delicious. I might come back just for these.I'm a huge fan of octopus and this appetizer delivered. Although I've never had it over mashed chickpeas before (basically with hummus) it did go well together. I prefer it without the hummus but won't hold it against them!For our main course we ordered a margherita pizza. This was by no means the best margarita pizza I've ever had but it wasn't bad either. I wouldn't come out of my way for this pizza.The ambiance is awesome - mostly white and very bright with sunlight on a clear day. Totally forgot I was in the middle of Midtown, nevermind a Macy's!Our server was attentive for the most part but we did feel left alone at some point where we needed things. These were infrequent but noticeable. One nice touch I liked is that the staff asks you if you have any food allergies at the start of service - very smart.Don't leave without having the gelato.

2.0,7/29/2015,"I came here for dinner reservation with my girlfriend for restaurant week. Firstly, I was fairly disappointed right off the bat waiting for someone to seat us. No one was there to greet us until 10 minutes later so I'm guessing they must be understaffed. We ordered from the restaurant week menu so I wasn't expecting much. Waiting on the waiter/waitress for service was what greatly ruined the whole experience. I further believed they were understaffed because it became extremely difficult to call on someone to either give us the check or call for dessert. The food dishes still seemed underwhelming and wasn't at all satisfying except for their pasta dish. Dessert was as expected and was pretty tasty. The restaurant's design was what made itself pop out. It was very modern and refreshing, one of the few good things about this restaurant.

It's so light and savory. This restaraunt is conveniently located on the 6th foor of Macy's, Herald Square. I always grab a window seat to look at the view. It's awesome.

2.0,7/16/2015,"I made a reservation for lunch at this place in Macy's, and that's where the trouble began.I arrived at 2PM for a 2PM reservation. People with no reservations were told it would be 10 minutes. I waited almost that long before my guest and I were seated.Over the course of the meal, a glass of wine I ordered came 15 minutes after I asked for it. My guest ordered coffee - twice - that didn't come for over 20 minutes, and when it finally did, it came not made as she asked. When we asked for cold milk, warm milk came a few minutes later and I basically had to get a manager to get a glass of cold milk.The food was fine. I had the pasta with mushrooms - the fresh pasta was not quite al dente, as it should be served, but acceptable. The sauce was very nice. My guest had a pizza which she enjoyed. My wine was great. Hers was not as it was described and she drank less than half of it.It never seemed like we had a ""waiter."" It was catch whoever you could as they raced by, and hope they actually took your order. There seemed to be zero concern for service on the part of the staff, with the exception of one young man who was very nice and the aforementioned manager, who got the cold milk himself - evidently, that was too much to ask of the wait staff.The food was good, if not exceptional, but for the price - and it's not cheap - I expect the staff to not act like they are doing you a favor if they bring something to your table.

When the waiter came by, he didn't bother making eye or voice contact, but made a heavy sigh as he shoved menus at us.I told him we wanted to move to a different table because of the heat.

The meat and cheese platter had 4 different cheeses (mozzarella, parmesan, goat, and something else) and salami, as well as, pickled carrot, olives, and thin pita-like chips. The brussel sprouts were my favorite! The brussel sprouts are sweet yet savory with walnuts, and golden raisins.I had the beef ragu ($20) which was delicious. The pasta was cooked perfectly and it was freshly made. It was small chunks of beef paired with yummy pasta that looked like insanely oversized macaroni. I finished it all. :)Location-wise, it's easily accessible. It's located in Macy's at Herald Square and you get a nice view of Herald Square from above.

The lobster bisque was creamy and bursting with flavor. There was four small pieces of lobster claw and some fennel in the bisque. The lamb agnolotti was very tasty. However, entree portion was small enough to be considered an appetizer. My cannoli was very light and crunchy. It contrasted nicely with the coffee budino which was rich, sweet and the right amount of coffee-ness. I liked the pudding consistency of the budino but I couldn't finish it because the sweetness eventually overwhelmed my taste buds. The side bread was terribly dry, hard, and stale.

So let me talk about it a little.Let me get out of the way that this was clearly pre-assembled, chilled, and then reheated for my joyous consumption. The only reason this isn't a 5-star review is that it was a bit cold in the middle. But oh MAN. I don't know what kind of ham or cheese it was, but that was, bar none, the best-tasting ham and cheese sandwich of my whole life. I mean, I'm 23, so I've got a lot of sandwiches ahead, but I'm gonna remember this one.Also, chocolate gelato, pretty tasty.

Had the Misto plate of 5 cheeses, split a pizza and a pasta.  Everything was wonderful.   We sat at the bar as it was a casual catch-up and just wanted to a unwind after a chaotic day.  I highly recommend it.",0,0,0,Barbara D.,"Denver, CO",462,395,9

The soup was definitely over salted and the polenta was nothing special at all (fresh corn mushed with seasoning and topped with parmesan).

Thoroughly disappointed, but let's save that for another review. This time, saw the advertisements on the walls as I rode the escalators for a restaurant we had not known about. Decided to give it a try. It was 2:00 in the afternoon, and the place was comfortably busy, although I was surprised to find the bar full with men in suits. I'm sure there is a story there. We were seated, and promptly attended to.  Our waiter was really friendly, offered us recommendations and throughout, checked in on us to see if we needed anything else. We split a salad and pizza. The salad was endive, fagiolini, cauliflower, tomato, shaved brussels sprouts and more. Nice assortment of fresh items that combined well.  The pizza was a simple Margherita, baked in a wood fired oven.  The crust was super thin, crunchy on bottom, and tasty.  The menu had so many other items that sounded great, but we just wanted a light lunch, so we were done for the day.  We'll definitely eat here again on our next shopping trip.",0,0,0,Marc W.,"Bradenton, FL",31,143,53

When we asked the waiter to remove the charge for the desserts, the waiter and the manager were profusely apologetic, but we did not order apologies or excuses, although they offered them in abundance as they took off the impermissible charges - and offered no discount for the oversight or for permitting a dog to eat in the restaurant with its owner.The restaurant is pretty in a sort of sterile, modern way.  The filthy dogs offer interesting contrasts.",0,0,3,Vir G.,"New York, NY",0,20,0

If you cannot guess my parents are deserting eaters. They know what they like and the love Stella 34. The location is on the 6th floor of Macy's Herald Square. The concept is open and spacious. The space is meticulously clean; which is hard to believe because of how large and how white it is. The servers are also not what you expect: they are professional trained servers and not unemployed actors / actresses. They know the menu every different permutation. Substitutions are not an issue and I have yet to see any order come out not how someone ordered. If you come often the servers get to know you as well as the hostesses and will seat you at the same table over and over. It basically creates a favorite table vibe for the patrons. My parents have relationships with the servers that extend past the restaurant. The food is fresh and well prepared. Everything I have eaten is delicious. I have yet to get something I have not liked. I will recommend that after lunch or dinner order the hazelnut gelato. It is awesome.

The salad came with a very healthy portion of duck - almost too much for a lunch portion. It was my first-time trying Ramps they were delicious. They bring out bread at the start of the meal - try the Semolina. The experience was not the best as our waitress was a bit scattered.

4.0,4/17/2014,"Stella is a great addition to Macy's Herald Square. The restaurant is very beautiful and spacious, and not at all what you would expect to find in a department store. It's a popular place to eat for Macy's employees and tourists alike, and with good reason.I had the pizza with eggplant and ham, and it was incredible. The dough was perfect, the portion was generous, and it was as good as pizza could get. I also tried the salad with cauliflower, raisins, and other goodies, and that was very good as well, but not as impressive as the pizza and other entrees on the menu. The names of the dishes were in Italian, so I unfortunately cannot remember what they were called.The downside to Stella is that it is very expensive Italian food. The pizza cost $19, which is pricey, even for Manhattan, and the salad was also around that price. So even though the food is great, I wouldn't come back that often because Manhattan is full of great Italian restaurants.

3.0,4/16/2014,"Here's the deal.. the restaurant breaks out into two styles. there is a cafeteria style and a sit down restaurant portion.  My 1st time here was within the restaurant section.  I/we showed up without reservations and told there was a 45 min wait. (for lunch???)  Okay, no problem we sat at the bar.   The clientele is hybrid of shopper/tourist/business man  Our service was very friendly and attentive, the restaurant appearance was open, bright and clean and offered interesting views!  The open kitchen was a bit noisy but quite amusing to watch.  Our group seemed to enjoy their food, I had the veal meatball sandwich  The meatballs were excellent!  However I wasn't a fan of the pita style it was served in, and for $16.00 ???  wow!!!  I thought that was outrageous!!  Others enjoyed a salad and a pizza.  Both gave a ""thumbs"" up.  But admitted they weren't blown away!   Overall I'd say the place is definitely good if you're shopping at Macy's and want to grab something quality to eat!  I did think it was on the expensive side.  So overall  I would say it was ""good"" and ""nice"",  but I don't see myself rushing back.  Clearly with a 45 minute wait for lunch...it's doing fine without me...

2.0,4/7/2014,"My friend and i decided to give this place a chance since it was raining hard outside and my friend didn't have an umbrella and didn't feel like getting out of Macy's.  We went here for dinner. First the service was subpar, they did not even give us bread until we asked for it. When we got the two slices of bread it was stale, tough and old. Yes only two slices, not a whole basket of bread and we only got two slices cause we asked for one of each type of bread otherwise they were only gonna give us one slice. Very cheap on the bread. Secondly, the food was small portions and cost over $20 a dish for pasta. A super small bowl of soup was $10. Totally not worth it. I ordered the prescuttio salami salad and the chicken soup and my friend got the cuttlefish twist ink pasta and our bill came out to be $30 per person (include tax and tips). Basically if you want good Italian food, Don't go here. You will not get full and food is over price. I recommend Tony di Napoli or Buca di Peppo in Times square for authentic Italian food with big portions at a reasonable price. Side note: It seems this restaurant is more of a novelty and probably for tourist.

3.0,3/2/2014,"I've been to Stella before and it was okay.  Nothing mind blowing about the service or the food, especially for the price.  But my coworkers wanted to go, so we went to lunch for restaurant week.When we first arrive, there was no wait and we got seated immediately.  There was someone to bring us water and inform us of the specials for the day.  But when it came to taking our order we had to wait a long time for our waiter to arrive.  Then when placing our order, my coworker selects Chiacchiere for a dessert, where the waiter stops her and ""recommends"" that she selects something else.  Apparently he is allowed to- tell us that he doesn't like it, but if we were to assume it on our own he wouldn't disagree.  The whole thing was extremely awkward.Then the first course arrived, Verdure - brussel sprouts and sauce were delicious, Seared Tuna with citrus and fennel salad was okay, nothing overly spectacular.  The other coworker ordered Calamari which was fried to perfection with an amazing cocktail sauce.  Then we waited a long time for the second course.  And maybe I'm complaining about how long it took because we were on our lunch break and had to get back to work, but it felt like forever.  We ordered the Shrimp Pagnotelle, which is basically a deep fried shrimp and lettuce po'boy.  The bread was not too thick and balanced well with the shrimp and sauce, but is not something I would ever order again.  My other coworker ordered a Margherita pizza - thin crust, oven baked, and the usual tomato sauce with random spots of mozzarella cheese.  Again, not worth the $15.  By the time the waiter came to collect our plates before dessert, we had already been sitting there 10 minutes waiting.  I even had to ask him to bring out the check with dessert because we were so late.  He seemed so confused that I had asked him to bring us the check already.  But eventually he came back with the Chiacchiere - fried dough with powdered sugar with chocolate and caramel sauce and my Stracciatella gelato.  I agree the Chiacchiere was not the best dessert, the dough was fine, but was very dry.  Especially when you combine it with chocolate sauce, it doesn't help the dryness.  The waiter asked us how they could make it better.  I think it was lacking either whipped cream on top, or maybe even vanilla ice cream with it.  Overall I would have only given them two stars for their service, and an extra star for the tasty first course.  The rest of the food was ordinary and I would not go back there because it's so expensive.",3,1,1,Evelyn Y.,"Manhattan, NY",251,18,11

5.0,2/22/2014,"I found this restaurant on Yelp and made reservations on OpenTable. Stella 34 Trattoria is one amazing hidden Italian restaurant in NYC inside Macy's Herald Square on the 6th Floor. It has amazing an view of the Empire State Building. It is elegant, chic, and has great ambiance. We came here for dinner last night. We ordered calamari and arancini for appetizers. The calamari was amazing. Nice, soft, and crunchy at the same time. It was a little bit on the salty side, but it still tasted great. The arancini is fried risotto balls with some type of tomato sauce. That was pretty good too. For entrees, we ordered Strozzapreti Con Seppie and Paccheri Napolitana. The Strozzapreti Con Seppie is cuttlefish ink pasta. It was a bit on the spicy side, but it tasted so good! It would have been even better if it wasn't spicy. The Paccheri Napolitana is a beef ragu pasta. That tasted really good and it's probably one of the most popular dishes here. The pasta dishes were amazing and fresh. We could only imagine what the pizza tasted like here. I would definitely come back to this place to have their pizza. :)For dessert, we ordered the olive oil pound cake and gelato cup with pistachio and chocolate chip ice cream. The gelato flavors were great and the pistachio ice cream tasted like it was freshly made. The olive oil pound cake was good too, but it wasn't sweet as a dessert. Like I said, the food was great and fresh. I And the ambiance is great. I would definitely come back many times in the future. It could be my go to restaurant from now on. :) In addition, pricing is decent and the service is great! The waitress even asks about any food allergies as if this was a 4 star restaurant! And I do have food allergies and told her what I was allergic to, but I know that the items we ordered wouldn't have any of the things I'm allergic to.

1.0,1/5/2014,"I was very excited about this place.  The food was okay.  Nothing special.  The view if you can get one is spectacular, especially during the Christmas season.  The service is the worse I've ever received.  In any city.  Ever.  We had the hostess seat us, then one female server that brought us water.  We already had cocktails (half empty) from the bar while we were waiting for our table.  Didn't see a waiter come to our table for another 10 minutes.  Maybe it was because they were busy handling complaints from 2 tables adjacent to us about the service and inaccuracy of their food orders.  Finally, a very agitated server comes to our table and asks, ""what do we want to eat?"" No hello, welcome, talking about the menu, ask if we're okay on drinks (which are gone by now).  We order our pasta dishes and he hurries off.  20 minutes later.  No food, no refill on water or opportunity to re-order cocktails.  No complimentary bread that most tables around us received upon receiving their waters.  My husband decides that he will go to the bar to get us cocktails.  Mind you, our ""server"" has been by adjacent tables and looked our empty drinks dead in the eye only to scurry off again.  My husband arrives back to the tables with cocktails (delicious by the way, the peach bellini reminded me of the notorious Bellagio cocktail).  A food runner comes by with our pasta dishes.  No server for another 10 min.  He finally stops by our table to ask how the food is, and says ""you know, you could've ordered drinks through me.""  I politely inform him that we would have loved to, but he has not stopped by our table in some time.  Before we even finish eating, he drops our check.  What if we want dessert?  Coffee?  Another cocktail?  I will NEVER EVER be back.  Macy's deserves better.",0,0,0,Erica M.,"Coppell, TX",0,36,0
4.0,1/2/2014,"Slow service but good food. It's a little strange to be at a restaurant like this in Macy's as it is much nicer than you would expect a restaurant in a department store like Macy's to be. We aren't talking Barney's or Bergdorf's here, yet the Stella's could easily be in either. I was a little upset when it took 15 min to bring our drinks and then the entrees came out prior to the drinks. The point of a cocktail is to enjoy it, atleast in part, prior to getting your food. Don't bring out the dinner and then drinks after. The host realIzed my displeasure and sent over a complimentary appetizer which was a nice gesture.

We were going for Thanksgiving dinner at 6pm and unfortunately this was also when people started crowding the doors to get in for early Black Friday shopping. We had to walk through a small mob of people to actually get into the building then wait for a woman to check our names on the reservation list before we could actually go into the restaurant. This was fine and wouldn't have been a typical experience if it hadn't been for the holiday but I can't help but feel they could have organized this better.We were seated near the kitchen, which is open to the dining area so that you can see them working and cooking. If you like listening to what goes on inside a kitchen it's great, if you don't enjoy that then you should ask to be seated somewhere else. Service was very professional but it seemed a tad overwhelmed, we had about 4 different people over to our table within 10 minutes all assuming we hadn't been helped yet. Wine service was very professional and while our waitress was allergic to wine she was much more helpful in picking out a good bottle than I've seen at other restaurants. She was able to describe all their flavors and also knew which were the most popular.We had a prix fixe menu so we didn't really get to chose any items from their standard menu but what we had we enjoyed. We got much more food than we could eat and were pretty full by the time we finished our appetizers. We both ordered the traditional turkey entree and it was cooked perfectly, not dry at all.Dessert was delicious, I ordered the pumpkin pie and my date ordered the apple crostata.

Try the fried calamari or meatballs as appetizers. The risotto balls were a little to mushy and not too hot so I would not have them again. The eggplant and salads are also great and very Italian.

I waited in line for just about everything and by the end of the day saved maybe $10?Won't make that mistake again.Anyway, the highlight of my day was lunch at Stella! Who would have thought a fantastic restaurant would exist in Macy's?Food: *I had the Verdure salad. This was delicious and reminiscent of a salad I used to eat at Gulfstream in LA. My only suggestion would be to add a bit more protein. For a $13 / $18 salad (depending on the size) I don't think this is an unreasonable request.*My husband had the Turducken. Not sure how to spell this, nor do I really want to know. The second he ordered this I knew it was a mistake because 1. nobody should eat 3 meats at once, and 2. my husband is picky and doesn't like dark meat. But I've been told I'm ""bossy"" so I kept my mouth shut. Ultimately, this sandwich went back and out came a delicious pasta instead. Thick spaghetti noodles, a fabulous tomato sauce. Amazing. He loved it.*My daughter had a Margherita Pizza. I wanted to insist she try something different but truly, the Macy's crowds had sucked all my energy away. I let her go with the pizza and she was thrilled. *We shared the Italian cookies and some gelato for dessert. Not sure why the gelato came in a paper cup with plastic spoons? The cookies were delicious!Service: Top notch. Even when my picky husband requested a new entree, the waiter was super gracious about the entire event.Ambiance: This place is gorgeous.

5.0,9/27/2013,"Stella 34 Trattoria is a clean and modern styled restaurant on the sixth floor of--this is happening--Macy*s. (I know.) I was initially a bit afraid of the restaurant choice but let me say, IT IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!Love the ambiance--it's extremely refreshing! Amidst the chaos of shoppers, piles and racks of clothing, and--did I mention--shoppers. No really, tourist shoppers who blindly veer into walkways while looking in every direction but the right one. It's like being in Times Square where they are all looking up and drifting as they walk and, if you're really lucky, stopping out of nowhere. THAT (that = hellish chaos).And then, whew, air, breathing, it's not a mirage--Stella 34 Trattoria.Already worlds happier than seconds before, the night's experience continued to climb up and up.To start, we had a few vegetable small plates to share. Not only were they super delicious but they were presented beautifully.The plating of the food stayed much in the theme of the restaurant, there was a lot of white with vibrant pops of color. The white dishes emphasize the rich color combinations within the dishes, each one looking exciting and enticing--you just have to dive in!Once you do dive in, it's incredibly flavorful. Clean and flavorful. By clean, I mean every ingredient stands out in the right way--with purpose. It's impressive.The dining experience at Stella 34 Trattoria quickly turns from pure enjoyment to curiosity over every item on the menu. Each item that we ordered was so good it made me want to try all of those dishes that I ruled out in the decision making process. (I suppose that's what brings people back to a restaurant. But in the moment I felt like a four-year-old having a tantrum because I want to eat more than I know I am capable of and would result in getting sick. I literally almost ordered a pizza after finishing my meal because my grandmother's looked so delicious.)Beyond my obsession with the food plating, style, flavors, and overall deliciousness, is the service. THE SERVICE IS REMARKABLE. From the moment I entered the restaurant and was greeted, I knew I was in for a proper evening.You see, I was offered a table before the rest of my party arrived. I was also given the option of enjoying a drink at the bar, or relaxing in the large lounge. When two more members of my party arrived, they were directed to the lounge--""there is a pretty girl waiting for you in the lounge""--I believe that she made a note of my location in her system. (fabulous service and compliment--too sweet!)Wonderfully, that type of service extended to our waitress Sam. She was truly fabulous and extremely knowledgeable of the menu. She was able to have fun with us in a completely professional manner which only added to the exceptional experience that we had at Stella 34 Trattoria.And then there's dessert (yes, I'm back on the food. And while I'm there, my ""Tortino Di Melanzane"" was excellent. I want it again right now as I drool over the photo I took of it). THE DESSERT IS JUST AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE DINNER! It's composed and thoughtful--just look at those textures, yum.THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS BEING TOO PREPARED--AND STELLA 34 TRATTORIA OBVIOUSLY KNOWS IT! Shopped too long and don't have time to cook for the family? Just don't feel like sitting down to a meal? Like a moth to a flame got pulled towards the lit display case filled with deliciousness?Yes, they have it all! Not only do they have a prepared food section--I know, ""not only""--but they have a gelato counter, too. Amazing. Take it all with you--no fuss, no muss. What a perfectly thought out experience!

The asparagus was burnt. My mom had the sea bass which she said was average. I tasted it and I would say it was dry.For what you pay here, the food should be better.

I had the best meals of my entire life here - and I say ""meals"" because I had a full 8 courses, and sampled all the plates of my dining partners along the way.This restaurant is ideal for tourists but also an undiscovered gem for locals. The chef has a focus on using fresh, in-season ingredients, which happened to be peas at the time of my visit. Every plate I hade melted in my mouth and was very clearly inspired. There was a starter bruschetta that included something I like to call (as a Texan) buttery pig cheek. Phenomenal! I was served a spicy pasta that was also clearly made in-house. I savored it.Then there was a salad course where my dining partner had octopus in hers. Try it - it's amazing. The following fish course was fantastic. Then I had pork that was served with a cherry sauce. I'd had the same pork cut the previous night at Lincoln Ristorante to much disappointment. This pork cut was...cherry heaven, and exactly what I'd been wanting.What made this experience so pleasurable was not just the high caliber of the menu, but also the care of the wait staff. Service can truly make or break any restaurant, and this one stands far and above most! I highly recommend this restaurant to tourists and locals alike - and that's a rare recommendation!Everything about Stella 34 from the greeting and entry, to the kitchen to the table service and dining atmosphere is five stars.

4.0,8/17/2013,"I was very surprised to discover this amazing new restaurant in Macys. I have been frequenting Macys as far back as I remember but never thought about it having quality food, until now. If you head to the back of the 6th floor through the bedding section (as of 8/2013 that is what is there, with all the remodeling this might change), you will stumble upon quite a fancy restaurant. I arrived on a Friday afternoon and did not need reservations although there was a decent sized crowd.I ordered Chitarra Alla Pomodoro (long square pasta, san marzano tomato sauce, stracciatella cheese, basil) and had them add veal meatballs to it [which I think was an excellent idea, it definitely enhanced the flavor of the pasta]. Everything was cooked well and it was fresh and delicious.For dessert, I ordered Graffe Napolitane (fried brioche, pistachio, crema, and strawberry gelato, whipped cream). There were three pieces of brioche each filled with a different flavor of gelato. The presentation was lovely and it was flavored nicely.I sampled the Chicken Ceasar Salad (which came topped with a piece of sardine. I was not a huge fan of the salad, but the sardine was delicious. It reminded me of excellent sardines that I tasted in Spain. It was fresh and seasoned perfectly. The service was great. The staff was very attentive and had no problems making adjustments to our orders. I will definitely be back to visit this place and try something new on the menu. The portion size was good but the price is more of what you would expect at a higher end store such as Nordstrom or Bloomingdales. For three people, we paid about $95 (One starter, two mains, two desserts, two drinks, and tip + tax).  I gave it a 4/5 because it is not the best Italian food I have ever had but it was quite delicious. Also the portion size, while filling, definitely left a little to be desired for the price. Regardless, I do believe it is worth checking out :)",2,0,0,La Viajera M.,"New York, NY",45,68,14

After my amazing brussel sprouts a ilili, I don't really think I can ever eat brussel sprouts the same way again. These ones were a little sweet for my taste.My brother got the eggplant parm and I just got a margherita pizza. It was good, but I think Vezzo has better pizza of the same style.The restaurant is pretty cool with fun paintings of different celebs all around and nice views of the city.

I now find it more glamorous than the more expensive (and snooty) malls out there in Manhattan.The new Stella restaurant on the 6th floor is a testament to how gorgeous and sophisticated (and more expensive) Macy's is becoming.Ok, regarding Stella, note that there are two components to the space: the cool cafe lounge and the equally cool but more formal table+chairs restaurant.I've tried both. Both have awesome food and the customer service is even more awesome. The prices are expensive but think of it as paying for the almost-hotel like service you'll be getting. The wait staff certainly deserve the tip.I normally just hang out at the cafe. Mostly because: I like their couches, the window views are more stunning (makes Manhattan look like Paris) and the food is packed and ready to pick up and eat at one of the small tables there.Downside:I wish the cafe had easy access to pitchers of water, so I won't need to bother their understaffed cafe just for a glass of tap. Similar to what Starbucks does.Correction:I mistakenly mentioned earlier that the bathrooms are far from the cafe and at another area of the mall. I was wrong. That was the case when it was newly opened and constructed. I was misinformed by one of the staff. I was just there today and they actually have an in-house bathroom that was not only regularly cleaned and maintained by staff, it was also as glamorous as the restaurant's decor.

4.0,5/28/2013,"Went here for a special night with my beau! Food was incredible! I ordered the Paccheri Napolitana pasta, and the beau ordered the Quattro Stagioni pizza. Both were extremely tasty! The only complaint about the pizza that the beau had was that each topping was split on each slice, (all of the ham was on one slice and all of the eggplant was on another etc.) Even though that may have been the cook's intentions for us to eat it that way, we both much preferred it when the toppings were all mixed together. For desert we had the Pizzetta Dolce, which was surprisingly delicious! (They use the crust of the pizza dough and spread the insides with house-made nutella) My only complaint, isn't really a complaint at all. I get uncomfortable when service is too nice/talkative. And they were very nice, and tended to our every need...which is great.",4,1,1,Cathy L.,"Manhattan, NY",54,42,1

5.0,5/17/2013,"As I've said before, I'm very impressed with the renovations that have been taking place at Macy's, but Stella 34 is the most surprising new addition and my favorite yet.  Keep in mind that the gorgeous, modern space with sweeping windows, mosaic tiles and large, aesthetically-pleasing wine refrigerators used to be a dingy stock room full of pillows.  Yes, I say this as a former employee of the bridal registry department.  Based on the interior design alone, this restaurant is something special. I came here last night with my sister as part of a girly evening.  The service was impeccable and everyone was extremely friendly.  Often times, it's difficult for my sister to find things she can eat at Italian restaurants as she has celiac disease.  This was not the case at Stella 34: rice crackers were brought to her on a separate plate from the bread basket and she was able to substitute gluten-free pasta for any of the pastas on the menu.The food was, in one word, stellar.  I ordered the Paccheri Napolitana after seeing a woman at the table next to us eating it.  The large tube-shaped pasta was al dente and delicious with a tomato sauce full of meaty chunks, cheese and caramelized onions on top.  I did not leave a speck of food in my bowl.  My sister raved about her pasta which was a modified version of the Chitarra alla Pomodoro, especially the basil-infused olive oil the chef used.I am still in disbelief that I had such a flawless dining experience in a place where I once did inventory on bedding.  I've already made plans to return and urge you to try this restaurant.  Not only is it peerless for an eatery in Macy's but it's excellent in general.",4,0,0,Caroline B.,"New York, NY",457,1247,36

4.0,5/7/2013,"We came here for lunch on a weekday. Had some trouble finding it since we wound our way through Macy's interior. Thought that the directions to Stella could have been better placed. As other reviewers have mentioned, this is in the corner, very inconspicuous at first when you walk down the aisle towards it. But once you step past the gelato shop, everything opens up!The decor is pure and elegant, gives you a very peaceful and calm feeling. The windows let in such much light it's really very pretty.I sat with my back towards the Empire State - very gorgeous view on a bright sunny day. We ordered:- (pasta) PACCHERI NAPOLITANA large hollow tube-shaped pasta,braised beef ragu, caramelized onions, parmigiano-reggiano 19- (pizza) MARGHERITA san marzano tomato, mozzarella, basil, pecorino-romano 16Oh I love the pasta! Pasta was cooked al dente, very chewy. The sauce was sooooo tasty and delicious! Because the pasta was chewy, every bite brings out the flavor more so take your time to chew it and savor it in your mouth!The pizza, toppings wise, it's amazing. Gobble it down while it's hot! I was a little disappointed in the crust though, it's slightly tougher than I thought it would be, I was expecting it to meet part of the Vera Pizza Napoletana standards (more about this certification here: americas.pizzanapoletana…); very soft, chewy crust. But it was good enough since the chef doesn't hold that certification. We also ordered a pistachio and tangerine gelato. The pistachio was thick and creamy. The Tangerine was refreshing and cleanses your taste buds. Was definitely a good meal and will return!",1,0,0,Kelcey K.,"New York, NY",1,60,5

This was a very beautiful day today and dining there just gave me a healing time... :)The food is great too. I had the Pomodoro pasta and Quartrro pizza was great. The pasta was perfectly al dante and the sauce was just enough to coat all of it. (I personally do not prefer a pool of sauce.) The best part is their pizza; they have their own brick oven and you can watch them baking the pizza from your table. The pizza was thin and crisp and adequately chewy on the edges. Loved every bite of it! :)The staff was amazing too. Very attentive and helpful with menu selection. I just want to recommend this place to anyone who wants to appreciate the great weather indoor just as much as you can do outdoor, while enjoying good service and food.

The staff was extremely accommodating and our server Anthony was friendly and attentive. A+ for ambience and service. My table shared the mussel, prosciutto and mozzarella appetizers. The mussels and prosciutto were satisfactory but the mozzarella was inedible due to its mealy texture. For my main course I had the Linguine alle Vongale which I wanted to love but the pasta was severely undercooked and starchy. The desserts and my $13 glass of Sauvignon blanc were similarly underwhelming.

5.0,3/20/2013,"I was here the other day with a group of 4. Fantastic experience all around and a great restaurant addition to the otherwise mediocre offerings in the neighborhood, if we can even call midtown/central - herald square a neighborhood.  -Service: Very impressed. It may have been that they just opened but servers were incredibly attentive as were backwaiters and management.  Glasses were always full and detail of knowledge of menu items was noticed. Although one of the backwaiters was incredibly talkative - not sure if that's a part of the regular experience or if she was bored or trying to be flirtatious.  -Food: The baby octopus was very tasty and scallops were perfectly cooked. Others had flounder, the eggplant and lasagna - I tried a bit of each and although still liked my scallops the best, would not have had an issue with the others. Tiramisu was good but it was the hazelnut/chocolate tort that really rounded out the experience - so delicious. Next time we'll try out the pizzas as that seems to be their specialty - it's white oak wood burning ovens in case you're wondering.-Ambiance: It's tough to argue with views over herald square and of the empire state building. Very serene environment when we went, but I would concur with the consensus that the view of the bedding section of macy's during peak weekend/holiday days would change the feel.I definitely recommend trying this place out.

We looked at the menu and there were so many things we couldn't pick which so we just picked a bunch.  The brussels sprouts and cauliflower were delicious, tuna bruscetta amazing (seriously, I didn't even want it and was shocked when I tasted it) polpettone (good), caponata (delish but a tad salty) and cauliflower pizza (yum).  To round out we also the Napoli salad.Main courses were the lasagna (with kale, bechamel and sausage, my hands down favorite lasagna EVER.  I'm not kidding.)  Also ordered the pork chop and roasted chicken.  I was so consumed with the lasagna that I didn't offer any to my friends, but they loved their food too.  Dessert: Yes, we were bad.  We got the the rice gelati (really great), hazelnut torte (good but a bit too chocolatey for me) and the lemon dessert.  Another hit out of the park and I didn't even order it.  So give it a shot. The service was excellent (I was a pain about which table they sat me at) but once I sat, it was all good.  They even asked if I was on a lunch hour to make sure I wasn't late.  I thought for a second I was in a Danny Meyer restaurant.We also went back after shopping in the store for coffee ordered from the counter and sat in the front.  It was great to have that option.",2,0,0,Teri J.,"Bronx, NY",1,38,5

3.0,3/14/2013,"After hearing that my beloved Vivoli is coming to New York, I knew we had to come try this place out. Times did an article, and through several outlets, we went with the expectation of an authentic Italian restaurant with a modern spin. 1. I think Eataly definitely set up a high standard competition wise. Granted Eataly has been going downhill since it first opened, their food was fantastic and the atomsphere was great. SO. while dining, looking at people shopping for pasta is better than looking at people shopping for bedsheets. i don't know what you can do, but maybe try putting a wall perpendicular to the frame of the door, so you are not blocking the door either, and customers would see mostly just a wall in their limited view, instead of bedsheets. 2. Portions. I understand it's a New York restaurant and I'm not expecting a plate full of food. But arancini should be the size a quarter to my face, not the size of my eyeballs. But it's 6 dollars for two piccoli arancini, I'm willing to let it go. 3. Pizza. Man I came here expecting it to blow me away. This is good pizza. amazing? not so much. Yes a special feat about neapolitan pizza is it's thin crust. But you do not have to make it so thin to the point where there's a hole ripped in my pizza. Secondly, having the right ingredients will not guarantee one to make the perfect neapolitan pizza. a good change for you guys is probably the cheese. make the sauce, make the cheese, every morning. and you will have the best damn pizza anyone will ever eat. That's the secret of Da Michele, simple as that. Also even in the competitive pizza world in New York. I would not rank this in my top 3. Try keste, try numero 28. 4. Atomsphere in general. im going to take a wild guess that this is an Italian restaurant put together by an entirely american team (it is a restaurant group after all). no real italian restaurant would be playing nek (as much as i love him). but then again this will mostly cater to tourists. so whateves. it's fine. 5. Vivoli flavors offered on the restaurant side. needs MORE chocolate. my god. MANY of their great flavors are not there. tiramisu?!! rum?!!! gianduia?!!! AMARENA?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! except for the pera, the pera is there. the gelateria closes at 8, so if you are dining, you risk not being able to taste half of Vivoli's flavors. So this for now. is a solid 3 stars. The restaurant is just opening up, im gonna give them time to smooth things out. Im coming back to try the pasta. and im gonna try out other flavors of the gelato. The place got lots of potential, don't mess this up!",0,0,0,Ren X.,"Manhattan, NY",24,83,26
4.0,3/14/2013,"I had lunch here yesterday and was very pleased.(*Disclaimer -- I work in the building.*) Luckily I was able to get a same-day reservation for lunch.  Stella 34 opened officially on Monday, and I heard from one of the launch managers that the restaurant is booked 3 weeks straight for dinner!  Based on the clientele there for lunch (fur coats, huge sunglasses), I believe it.To start, I had the veal meatballs and the calamari.  The meatballs were like butter!  I almost couldn't taste them BECAUSE THEY MELTED SO FAST IN MY MOUTH.  The calamari was light and tasty but just a little salty.For entrees, my companion had the misto salad with chicken, and she said it was good enough that she didn't need to salt and pepper it (kindof a big deal for her).  I had the Paccheri Napolitana, which is tube-shaped pasta with braised beef ragu.  Omg.  It was delicious and homey, but heavy so I only ate half and took the rest home for breakfast.  I did think my dish was also a little salty.For drinks we enjoyed some of the loose leaf teas, which were fresh and fragrant.  And for dessert, we shared the Delizia al Limone, which was a merengue-covered lemon curd with lemon gelato on the side.  I actually felt like the lemon gelato was exploding flavor in my mouth.  I can see why the chef wouldn't have any other brand than the Vivoli -- this is their first foray into America from Italy!  In addition to the dining area, there is a private dining room and a more casual to-go area near the gelato counter.  I anticipate Stella 34 will become a dining destination in desolate midtown.  Oh, and did I mention my floor-to-ceiling view of the Empire State Building while I ate?  (Picture posted to the main page.)  I can't wait to come back here and try more of the menu.",6,0,3,Dione D.,"Atlanta, GA",104,606,455

During my first weekend there, she gave me a walking tour of Florence, and I will never forget her telling me about VIVOLI--the *best* gelato in all of Florence. I, being a foreigner, fully trusted her advice, and I later tried it with my roommate and was hooked. I took everyone I knew there-my classmates, my parents, my sister--shoot I'd even go by myself whenever I felt like taking a walk!I tried a lot of gelato in Italy, and Vivoli really was the best. Their gelato is so smooth, creamy, flavorful, and melts in your mouth like heaven! I really can't describe it in words, but every time I think of Florence, I think of Vivoli gelato.I am just so glad that one of my greatest memories of Firenze is finally here, in our grand city. When I was handed the gelato, I was so excited to see that even the cups designs are the same! Once I tasted the sweet gelato, I was immediately taken back to 2009, and I felt like I was a bright eyed college student again. It is just as good, and just as blissful!I will definitely be coming back here for more. Thank you, Stella 34, for bringing the best gelato on earth to NYC!!!!",3,0,1,M.L. P.,"Queens, NY",1,14,5

5.0,3/5/2013,"I have had the ""buona fortuna"" to dine at Stella 34 Trattoria through their opening training.  With a dedicated express elevator from 35th St & Broadway, I was whisked from the frenetic energy of Herald Square to a shimmering modern white space appointed with cool blue & soft yellow accents, much like the Neapolitan flag (Naples inspires the menu) ... and definitely projecting a Italian coastal vibe.  Servers sport cool blue linens.Must dos:Share a few ""Piccolo Piatti"" plates.  I'm fond of the octopus, the Brussels sprouts & cauliflower in a honey white balsamic glaze from the wood burning ovens, the meatballs and the olives.Get a pizza - classic Neapolitan selections plus modern twists on Italian flavors -- The flour is ""Caputo"" imported from Naples, the 800+ degree ovens are wood burning, the San Marzano tomatoes come from the foothills of Mount Vesuvius.  This is the lightest pizza you will ever have - along with some great combinations like Meyer lemon and cauliflower.Get a pasta - The chef makes all pasta in-house, even the dried stuff.  The extruder was imported from Italy.  Speaking of, the chef, Jarett Appell, is not only a ""Master Piazzaiolo Napoletano"" but also received his diploma in Mastery of Italian Cuisine from school in Colorno, Italy.  No wonder the pasta forms are traditional to Naples - paccheri, strozzapretti, etc.Get your vino on - 100+ bottles. All Italian.Sit with the Empire State Building over your shoulder -- or if you're a tourist, sit facing a window and see the majestic tower throughout your meal.  In a city filled with views, there's something special about this one.  Let's face it, without trekking over to the Ace Hotel, there's not a lot in this neighborhood at the moment so Stella 34 Trattoria brings some welcome authenticity, quality and modern design aesthetic to Herald Square.  Plus a pretty banging soundtrack that seems to be a mix of modern Italian with Big City favorites.And lastly, get your Macy's on.  I'm only half kidding.  With the express elevator at the 35th & Broadway entrance, you really don't even have to enter the store, BUT let's face it, much like reading the New York Post, going to the World's Largest Department Store is something we all do, even if we don't talk about it.",7,4,3,stewart s.,"New York, NY",113,83,25
