5.0,4/17/2019,"This place is a delight, in crappy FiDi. Went there for a team lunch, arrived at midday and it was totally empty. By 12:30pm it was almost full. We all had the Schnitzel, and it was friggen delicious. Perfectly fried, still juicy, and it had some lovely (authentic Austrian) sides that I don't know the name of. I was like starving - and I thought to myself ""I wish this was a slightly bigger serving size"" - but then I realized I DIDN'T need to eat until loosening the top button was necessary. And I was happy. Atmosphere was so nice - its a cozy, restaurant. Perfect for a date, work lunch, or just when you NEED to eat schnitzel (which happens more than you think).",0,0,0,Lisa L.,"New York, NY",76,31,2

4.0,3/2/2019,"This place is such a pleasant surprise! It's in the quiet part or FiDi, 2 blocks past the Trinity Church and a bit away from the Freedom Tower. When I was looking for the place I was genuinely confused by the location. My friend and I went for lunch and were hoping to get seated a bit early because she had a meeting afterwards. We got there and the woman greeted us sort of rudely, saying, ""we open at 12"" and walked away. We were not impressed. We walked around for a bit, came back, and was greeted by a man. He was super nice, not too attentive and overall changed the experience for us. I'd say what really got us...THE FOOD! The menu is nothing special but the quality of ingredients were clearly superb. I just got the classic burger and my friend got some sort of pasta with swiss chard? I'm definitely gonna recommend this place to my friends. I recommend you make a reservation on opentable though. At first we thought it would be dead because it was lunch, but not long the entire place was packed.",0,0,0,Argina G.,"Sunnyside, NY",0,13,0
4.0,2/27/2019,"Came here for a work lunch and enjoyed a nice meal. We started off with some drinks (they only have a selection of wine and beer, despite there being what seemed like a bar in the back) and ordered some appetizers for the table. We got the grilled french carrots (minty, kind of odd), crispy brussel sprouts (not vegan), roasted cauliflower, and pommes frites for the table, all which were delicious. As the resident vegan of the bunch, I ordered the whole wheat and avocado, with a side of butternut squash soup, but found both to be pretty disappointing. The avocado toast was really just be avocado puree and the soup was rather bland, but I enjoyed having options to eat that weren't just salad. My coworkers had a range of items, from the Schnitzel to the duck, and all enjoyed their meals. I think the highlight for me were the appetizers, but I wouldn't go back on my own dime. I'm certain my coworkers would, though!Tl, dr: We picked this spot for its location and wide range of options, including vegan ones, and everyone left satisfied. I wouldn't recommend this for vegetarians/vegans, however, as the food fell a bit short, but for the main dishes and overall experience, I felt 4 stars was warranted.",0,0,1,Olivia S.,"New York, NY",144,47,54
3.0,2/26/2019,"Cozy atmosphere, good service. They definitely have vegan options, I'll give them that. Had the crispy cauliflower. Was tasty. Also had the chick pea stew which was lacking. Both items had a non-vegan ingredient removed but not sure anything was done to round out the experience for the vegan version. The stew... was just not impressive from a flavor or texture perspective. The fries were good but a little too thin for my preference - very shoe string.",0,0,0,Molly N.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",13,89,87

Schilling was new my hotel so my coworker and I went there for dinner one night.We ordered both the wiener schnitzel and the housemade tagliatelle. The schnitzel was a delight, but the tagliatelle was to die for. It was one of the best meals I've had in months. The flavor palette was complex and flavorsome--the pickled Thai chilies gave the dish a subtle Eastern spice in this Western dish. The tagliatelle was soft but not too soft and the lamb shoulder was tender.I enjoyed the tagliatelle so much that I came back the following day for seconds before flying back to Chicago.",0,0,0,David Q.,"French Quarter, New Orleans, LA",7,7,6

2.0,1/2/2019,"Being from Europe, I'm always on the hunt for good and authentic food from that side of the world. Living in this neighborhood, I've walked by Schilling numerous times and we finally decided to give it a try. We made a reservation and headed there for dinner, hungry and excited to try their take on Austrian food. Upon entering, we really enjoyed the decor inside, but were confused on where to go to check in for our reservation. There is no traditional Host stand, which we don't necessarily care about, but having some idea on where to go would be more efficient. There was only one table of two people in the front of the restaurant, whether there was another section behind the bar is unknown to me. We waited, standing around incredibly awkward, for a good 10 minutes until a tall lanky blond guy came by, looking annoyed when he saw that we were going to seat ourselves. Rude as they come, as if we interrupted him. We asked to sit by the window and he said he has to check first, but the restaurant was empty, despite the other two patrons. (Only two more people came an hour later). He not so graciously let us sit by the window. He was short and abrupt in taking our orders and never checked in, so the service was pretty abysmal at its worst and mediocre at its best. The food was decent, not authentic and the portion size is desirable, especially what they charge. A handful of fries for the price they charged is a bit steep, but they were tasty - I will give them that. I had asked if my dish could be made without the chili and the rude waiter said yes...but I still got chili and my mouth was on fire. I'm a weenie when it comes to heat levels and most Austrian or German foods are rarely spicy...so not only was it not authentic, it was also not enjoyable for someone that can't handle the heat. I did mentioned this to the woman that cleared our table, that my food was spicy and she just laughed.After someone else delivered the food, he never showed up again and I was stuck with really spicy food. Then we had to flag someone else down so we could pay for our meals. We had planned to try one of their desserts, but because of the poor service and the lackluster food, we decided to cut our loses before we are even more disappointed. I had really hoped to have a better experience, because it's literally across the street and while I have nothing against someone's different take on different cultured foods, I had hoped for more. Considering this is NYC with an abundance of amazing restaurants, this will be a one time place for me - I would have given the food another try, but the waitstaff is what killed it for us. Being non-attentive is one thing, being rude is another and killing the vibe what could have been an awesome restaurant is really sad. I'm not one to ask to be waited on hand and foot, but if you are working in a service based industry, there is an etiquette where I do expect to be treated politely and that did not happen here.

2.0,12/14/2018,"This was a one time place for me. Without going into too much detail, our wait staff just really killed the vibe for us. We wondered in late on Saturday night, because it was dead, and were excited to try something different and not have to wait. When we asked our waiter what he recommended said ""everyone gets the schnitzel"". And that was it. We asked about wine and thank god he brought over the bartender who was a sommelier. He recommended a lovely wine. Then we order the cauliflower which was DELICIOUS, very flavorful, has cauliflower ever been called flavorful?! haha we then ordered the housemade tagliatelle and the wiener schnitzel. When I asked how the tagliatelle was our waiter told us ""if you want noodles, i'd go to an Italian place."" Although I appreciate the honesty, a recommendation other than ""everyone gets the schnitzel"" would have been appreciate and I feel is not asking too much. So unfortunately, along with the piss-poor recommendations from him, the rest of our services was under par and our tip reflected that. The bar tender and the hostess were lovely.

Food was delicious - we got the chicken liver mousse, the tagliatelle, and the wiener schnitzel and the drinks were amazing. The issue was the service was so so slow.  I don't know if the service is just slower on this day because it was a Sunday but it took forever for someone to take our order.

I asked why he couldn't give me someone else table and had the same excuse to other guests instead and he was shocked by my request. So its ok to mess with my dinner but not ok to mess with someone else dinner.I was placed on a middle table squeezed in between other people for a business dinner so very disappointing time.No one told us about any food, no one suggested anything, and during the time we were choosing the food, the waiter walked out to speak with people by the door twice leaving us talking.Pretty bad and expensive place for such ordinary food and people.",4,0,0,Rodrigo G.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",67,145,21
3.0,9/18/2018,Had dinner while in town on business. Seems like a nice neighborhood place. Server was friendly and professional.

4.0,9/7/2018,"Cozy little spot in FiDi serving up solid platters of food. Apparently this place is Austrian, but I wouldn't have been able to tell by the menu (with the exception of the schnitzel, but one schnitzel does not an Austrian restaurant make). The offerings leaned heavily on the vegetables, with only the mains being pretty meat-centric.Bread service consisted of housemade focaccia with white bean spread - yum! We ordered the tagliatelle with lamb and the night's special of roasted branzino with succotash to share. The pasta was maybe a touch overcooked, but I really enjoyed the heartiness of the lamb ragu. Branzino had a great crispy skin that gave way to perfectly cooked fish. Not to be outshone, the succotash surprisingly was the perfect summer dish - you could really tell that they used fresh ingredients, and I don't even usually like squash.Dessert was the only ding - we split the mascarpone, which turned out to be essentially a less tasty version of a tiramisu. Skip, for sure.Would definitely come here again if I were in the area. The place was pretty empty at 7PM on a Thursday, so I'd imagine it's the perfect neighborhood place to drop by.",3,1,1,Yuting Z.,"Manhattan, NY",435,332,543

3.0,7/24/2018,"Stopped in after an exercise class nearby to get dinner with K.C., M.Y., and a friend from out of town. The cute restaurant front opened up to the street for the warm summer night. We were pleasantly surprised that it was restaurant week and K.C. having been here before recommended the shrimp for the appetizer, steak for the main, and strudel for dessert. Give there were four of us, we just decided to go ahead and try all the restaurant week menu. For the apps, I definitely thought the shrimp really hit the spot. A touch of garlic, a nice little kick of spice, savory pureed white bean, and parsley to finish made the shrimp savory, a tiny bit spicy, and all sorts of wonderful. The chickpea soup was nice and hearty but maybe more suited for a colder day and the iteration of restaurant week that occurs in the winter. The third appetizer, the crostini, had a very well made pesto atop cheese and topped with grape tomatoes with sunflower and some olive oil. Very delicious but slightly small for sharing. So two out of three isn't bad as far as appetizers go but they forgot that we had ordered two shrimp, one crostini, and one soup and brought out three shrimp instead. Onto the entrees! My friend had touted this hanger steak and being on the verge of fantastic so I perhaps expected more, but it was just okay. The sear was good as was the seasoning but it just wasnt super special. The risotto, unfortunately, also let us down. The rice was cooked well and had a nice light mix of cheese and peas but the lemon flavoring was either lost among the other entrees we were eating or was woefully lacking. So... well cooked, not super special. We ordered the schnitzel as our last entree and thankfully it did not disappoint. Pounded thin and breaded beautifully, I would come back for more. My only complaint? Maybe more of the lingonberry sauce and side of potatoes to go with the dish.For the desserts we got three strudels and one tiramisu. The strudels were nice and flaky but ever so slightly underdone. The apples plus roasted walnuts did add a nice texture to the dish though. It was accompanied by a side of whipped cream which allowed the dish to stay nice and light.So why 3 stars? Well getting the order wrong wasnt great but was forgivable. Somewhat bland entrees, a bland appetizer and a small appetizer and total 60 a person even during restaurant week was kind of the kicker. All in all, some decent food, but not all of it is spectacular for restaurant week. Maybe I'll try again in a few weeks and have to update my review!",0,1,0,Caroline L.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,94,56

1.0,5/14/2018,"Decided to try this place out since it was different from the local steak joints.  The place itself is small but decorated nicely.  However Food wise ... it was mediocre at best. It states Austrian  food but really only has a few native Austrian dishes. They tried to state they had a ""Uni pasta"" special ($30)... but about the only Uni they had in the dish was the title to the pasta. In short there was none.  As for service...slow. After much delay they brought out the wrong order. The waitress was unable to identify their own pasta dish when questioned if this was the Uni pasta. The chef came out to explain but gave a explanation that the Uni was blended with the butter sauce.  It was replaced with another dish but when the bill came it was still charged to us.

4.0,4/10/2018,"Went here with a friend to check this place out for dinner after reading some good reviews. I made sure to make a reservation--and it's a good thing I did since it was a full house.After perusing the menu for a bit we decided to split a trio of vegetable dishes: Brussel sprouts, asparagus, and the broccoli and kohlrabi salad.The Brussel sprouts were very good, though a touch heavy on the acidic flavor for my taste buds. Nevertheless, they were perfectly cooked and paired well with the pomegranate seeds.The asparagus was also decent--though I felt it was a little bit plain overall. Again, they were perfectly grilled and had that nice char, but nothing ground breaking in terms of flavor.The broccoli and kohlrabi salad was excellent. The veggies were grilled to perfection and the sauce it was served with was delicious--I found myself using it to dip all of the other veggies from the other dishes too.For my main meal, I went with the sea bass. The sea bass itself wasn't the greatest, as it was a bit on the fishy side, but it was cooked well. The puree and braised leeks were very tasty and the portion size was good.Overall, this place is a cute, hidden gem in the FiDi neighborhood that serves up quality food at a reasonable price.

Given the location and time at which I went, it's no surprise there were a few strollers and babies throughout the restaurant. Even with that in mind, I loved how Schilling offered a classy vibe while also catering to the family crowds. This is a great place to come with friends, or your babies and sip on classic cocktails with a Schilling twist. They even offer a ""happy hour"" until 6pm daily, which gave us a bit of a discount on the drinks we had. Our table of six was not very unique, and ordered three entrees among us all: The Wiener Schnitzel, Schilling Burger, and the Pan-Roasted Sea Bass. I'm not a schnitzel fan, and Schilling didn't bring me to the dark side of Schnitzel loving.... I'm glad I stuck with my tried and true favorite of the Sea Bass!

5.0,2/13/2018,"TLDR: hidden gem in FiDi; fantastic austrian food and drinks; exceptional service; cozy atmosphereMade a reservation for a group of 3 on a Wednesday night at 8pm for Restaurant Week, Winter 2018. When we arrived, the restaurant was packed and the hostess apologetically told us that our table wasn't ready yet but suggested that we grab seats and drinks at the bar while we waited. Upon walking in, we were all drawn to the cozy ambiance of the restaurant, with its warm lighting, dark wood communal tables, cushioned seats, antique decorations, and wood paneled ceilings. The music also helped to set the mood with classics by The Cars, The Beatles, John Lennon, and David Bowie playing in the background.While waiting at the bar, we ordered a ciao! vienna (gra'it grappa, disaronno, oregat, passion fruit, & mint), wild passion (mezcal, passion fruit, citrus, & hibiscus), and bourbon cupcake (bourbon, pomegranate, ginger, citrus, & spiced egg foam). The bartender was very nice and it was interesting to watch him expertly craft the cocktails. I found the ciao! vienna to be fruity and delicious and my friends enjoyed their drinks as well. Even though it took 30 minutes for our table to free up, the time seemed to fly by and our waitress continually thanked us for our patience. Once we were seated, our waitress gave us time to look over the menu and gave us recommendations on the best choices on the Restaurant Week menu. When I flagged my nut allergy, she was very careful with ensuring that there was no cross contamination in the kitchen and provided an alternative dessert option for me not listed on the RW menu. I ordered the shrimp ajillo (garlic, parsley, chipotle aioli), skirt steak (chimichurri sauce, potato, onion, and pepper vegetable medley), and panna cotta (graham cracker streusel, fruit).The shrimp ajillo was cooked perfectly and was full of garlic flavor and other spices. I was surprised at the generous portion size, as there were probably 7 large shrimp on the plate. The skirt steak was phenomenal as well--tender, juicy, and full of flavor from the chimichurri sauce on top as well as the vegetable medley. Lastly, the panna cotta was the perfect way to end the meal, as the smooth, sweet dessert was complimented well by the crunchy cinnamon spiced graham cracker and sweet strawberry topping. The three-course meal was portioned perfectly, as we all felt full at the end of our meal, but not overly stuffed. Between the excellent food, cocktails, service, and ambiance, would definitely recommend checking this place out if you're ever in FiDi.",0,0,1,Amanda W.,"London, United Kingdom",242,96,259

That being said, the selection and food was still dope.Atmosphere: Small, intimate, packed, and loud. Had reservations for 4 at 8pm on a Friday night. We weren't actually seated until about 8:15, but that's no biggy. There is one LONG table in the middle of the space, but luckily we had our own table for four in the corner near the window. Food: RW menu at the actual establishment had the following the night I was there: For appetizer, shrimp ajillo, pistachio and ricotta toast, and an octopus salad. Dinner was currywurst, spatzle, hanger steak. The dessert was apple strudel or affogato. I had the shrimp ajillo, the hanger steak, and the affogato.First, they give you this soft, rosemary focaccia. It is so soft and fluffy and amazing and addicting.Shrimp ajillo was plentiful! Shrimp was perfectly cooked, large, and the chipotle aoili had a nice kick to it. The Hangar steak was cooked to medium rare perfection, and the bean/potato side dish that accompanied it was so damn delicious and full of herb flavors. I tried my partner's ricotta which was smooth, but the bread was a little too soft and dense. The spatzle was good and creamy, but definitely on the heavier side, although the greens were perfectly steamed and the crispy onions on top were amazing.  The currywurst sausage was super flavorful and the fries were perfectly crisp too. Affogato was DELICIOUS. Gelato was nice and creamy, but the espresso was a bit too strong for my taste. I couldn't drink the rest once I finished the ice cream, haha.Service: Okay. He asked if we wanted more bread, and we said yes, but he never returned with it throughout the entire night. In addition, my partner said he wanted the affogato, but he brought out the apple strudel for him, and when he told him he asked for the affogato he kind of tried to argue that he said strudel. Eventually he brought out the right dessert, but I mean, that rebuttal was a bit unnecessary.I'm inclined to go back because the food is unique and delicious. Love me some Austrian food now.",2,1,2,Tiffany O.,"Newark, NJ",314,516,1390
5.0,2/1/2018,"Had dinner here at 6pm on a Wednesday evening. Made a reservation the night prior. It's not a large restaurant so I'd recommend reserving a table. There are about a dozen tables and a long common table in the middle for seating. There is a bar but only about 6ish seats. I was immediately greeted by very friendly staff.  There were drink specials   To which I ordered the Alpine Dew. Fabulous cocktail!For an appetizer, I had the fig & raddichio salad. Highly recommended. It's part mildly sweet with a subtle tart from the raddichio that's been I think grilled. It's paired with grapes and a lovely cheese. The main course was sea bass. Very well seasoned and skin crisp. Yum!Dessert was the Mascarpone. It has bits of ladyfinger and almost reminded me of a tiramisu but a lighter less heavy version.

I have to say, this was an excellent start to our culinary adventures.One taste here and you quickly understand that this chef takes his food very, very seriously. We had the prix-fixe menu, that- along with being generously proportioned- kinda, sorta blew our mind. Not even a minor misunderstanding regarding under-cooked chicken livers (they taste better well done in my opinion, and definitely safer that way) could make this less than a 5-star meal. The taste is definitely there...Additionally, the restaurant, diagonally across the street from a raucous beer hall, was very pleasant for a warm summer night. The light and bright ambiance was spot-on. The only issue of course is that this restaurant is way down in FiDi... BUT... BUT.. about 3 minutes from a subway stop.So, yeah, great restaurant.

She also said that we should keep the spatzle, free of charge, which we thought was a nice gesture. It turned out to be the best thing we ate.  After that, our waitress disappeared. Another waiter brought the schnitzel, which was mediocre at best. We finished our meal and waited 15+ minutes for the opportunity to ask for the check since there wasn't a single member of the waitstaff in sight. Ultimately, a new waitress brought us the check, which we were surprised to see included the spatzle. When we inquired about it, our original waitress reappeared and let us know that the spatzle was included in the check because we said we would keep it.

Could've chosen a restaurant closer to the theatre district but how often do you get to try upscale Austrian food? MTA was a mess because of bad weather so we didn't arrive until 5:30, but that's when the kitchen opens anyway so no harm done. We were still the only ones dining for at least 30 minutes, I don't know how crowded they get as the night goes on. But as a result, our service was very quick and attentive. We shared the housemade ricotta crostini and crispy artichoke & grilled ramps to start. These two were honestly the highlights of the evening, both were full of flavor, especially the crostini. I had the roasted chicken with green garlic farro, wild mushroom velouté and my girlfriend had the wiener schnitzel. Note that their in-house menu is not the same as what's on their website! I was really looking forward to getting the housemade tagliatelle but the dish being offered was very different to what was on the menu :( the chicken dish was good! As was the wiener schnitzel. Nothing spectacular though. We each had an apple strudel for dessert, as well as an espresso and americano (their only coffee options). The strudel was good as well: warm, flaky and served in a vanilla sauce with a very small dollop of fresh whipped cream. However it still didn't quite measure up to the start of the meal. C&M fizz cocktail was light and refreshing and I had a glass of one of the Austrian wines, also nice! Service was fine, a couple small miscues such as forgetting one of the strudels and not refilling on water very quickly.

I'd say this restaurant is a solid 4.5 with a thoroughly delicious menu from top to bottom. Although they feature authentic Austrian food, you don't have to be accustomed to European cuisine to enjoy an evening at this restaurant.Situated in the shadow of the new World Trade Center, tucked away on a quiet street in the Financial District that empties each day after the Stock Exchange closes, this hidden gem is one of the top-rated Manhattan restaurants on Yelp for a reason! The cooking is phenomenal, the atmosphere is vey romantic, and the service is fantastic.We began with the salami spread, which is to die for, highly recommended!!! In fact, get two or three and share them with the table!!! We tried the mussels and clams in a soup-like presentation which was pretty tasty as well. The schnitzel was impeccably flavorful in all its deep-fried goodness. The spätzle was not as cheesy as I had hoped, but was very good.

4.0,1/27/2017,"Came here for RW dinner last night and was very pleasantly surprised.We got the beef tartare and the romaine salad to start.  The beef tartare was OUT OF THE WORLD good.  Omg.  I have to go back just for this.  It was honestly the best beef tartare I'd ever tasted and I had quite a few.  The romaine salad was just okay.  We both thought it wasn't cleaned very well because there was definitely quite a lot of sand and stuff in it.  Very gritty.  I actually had to clean the bottom of each leaf because it was still grayish with soot.  Definitely don't get the salads there.  But honestly, who usually does anyway??  We only got it because we wanted to try as many dishes as possible so we got two different apps (they only have 3 with 2 of them being salads).  Probably should've gotten two beef tartares.The entrees we got were the mushroom risotto and the icelandic cod.  Both were delicious. The cod was lightly fried and despite it being fried, it was overall very light.  The risotto was freaking delicious but was incredibly heavy. Good thing we split it because half of that was more than enough.The broccoli rabe (complimentary side) was actually not too bad.  I really don't like broccol rabe so I had asked for a substitute and they said no :(  At least it wasn't as bad as I remembered.For dessert, we got both of the ones offered: tiramisu and the apple strudel.  Both were good in very different ways.I would definitely go back to get their melt-in-my-mouth delicious beef tartare and another entree.  I was a little disappointed that they didn't have the schnitzel as a RW offering.  It's a traditional austrian food.",2,1,1,Stefany W.,"Manhattan, NY",202,214,33
4.0,1/25/2017,"On the basis of a Friday evening happy hour I can give Schilling a solid 4-star rating. The entrees look good but I'd have to have dinner there before I add the last star. We spent over two hours drinking wine and eating appetizers, with periodic check-ins from the waiter. Good, friendly service. The small plates we tried were excellent (some vegetarian apps and crostinis) and the wine was good, although pricier than it should have been during happy hour. The ambience is lovely, and as it started to fill up for dinner, the relaxed feeling remained. Certainly worth a stop after work or on the weekend if you're in the financial district.

4.0,12/16/2016,"We came here on a Tuesday night for dinner since I live in the neighborhood.  One thing I wasn't aware of is that the online menu may differ from the menu at the restaurant because of seasonal items (the mushroom ravioli was not on the menu).  Our waitress was nice and attentive. I liked the environment and decor as well. To start we ordered the lemon and basil homemade ricotta crostini. It was rich and light at the same time. We didn't particularly care for the lemon peels that were one of the toppings so we took them off. I ordered the Young Chicken which was cooked perfectly. While interesting, the sour dough bread salad was a little too soft for my taste.

4.0,12/13/2016,"A friend recommended this place to me when I moved to FiDi... Can't believe it took me two months to try this place though I live just round the corner! The restaurant is not big, but it feels warm and cosy on the inside. There are two long communal tables as well as smaller tables on the side if you prefer to have some privacy (these tables are still really close to each other though).My friend and I really enjoyed the complimentary bread and had to stop ourselves from having too much! We both had the schnitzel for our main, which came with potato salad (we replaced this with fries), cucumber salad and some fresh greens. The only grouse I have is that the greens were tossed with too much dressing. Other than that, it was a great meal. The pork was moist and wasn't greasy, and I really liked the lingonberry sauce that came with it. The cucumber salad was really refreshing too. The fries came with dijonnaise and ketchup on the side. The ketchup was a homemade one I think? There was another flavour to the ketchup which we could not figure out, but we absolutely loved it. We probably ate too much fries with that ketchup...The friend who recommended this place to me said that Schilling does a good burger and fish too.

It is absolutely adorable (apologies if that offends the Schilling crew, but it is), and it needs to be the beacon that guides similar establishments into this part of the city. The simple rustic charm is a perfect fit in this neighborhood. It is especially wonderful in warmer weather when they open the front wall and you feel like you are sitting outside. The cocktails and wine are delicious, as is the food. I have only had one meal that I wasn't a big fan of, the prawns, but everything else has been great! Schilling works as a great date spot or get together place for friend and family. There are long tables, so you can accommodate a larger group (I was there with 6 and it was fine).Definitely check it out if you're by the WTC!",4,0,0,Maria D.,"New York, NY",98,82,9

It has a nice trendy vibe and but feels laid back at the same time. They did a great job. Not going to lie, I was late getting to the dinner so our friends ordered the apps. They were a variety of different toasts and spreads so I don't know exactly what they were but they were absolutely delicious! I tried them all and couldn't stop eating them. They have a good variety of cocktails and wine. For my entree I ordered the schnitzel. The pork was pounded thin and the breading was light. I had it with fresh lemon and the cranberry sauce it was served with. It was a perfect balance and the portion was just right. I typically don't finish my meal but there was not a bite left on my plate and I didn't leave feeling grossly stuffed. The dish was served with a cucumber salad and a potato salad. Again the portions were perfectly sized. The service was great and our drinks were always full. Will definitely be returning to try more of the menu!",1,0,1,Molly S.,"Long Island City, NY",96,89,144

5.0,11/13/2016,"Absolutely top notch!  My son and I were NYC to visit the 9/11 Museum and wanted to enjoy dinner someplace nearby before heading home.  We love trying different cuisines, and when I saw the yelp reviews for this place I knew we had hit a home run; you just don't find good Austrian food in Jersey.  I had an appetizer of duck rillette that was decadent, but perfectly portioned so that you didn't feel like a glutton after eating it.  Sadly I didn't have enough of an appetite for a full meal, so I followed with the roasted beet and apple salad as my entree, and I loved the contrast of the tart yogurt dressing against the sweetness of the main ingredients.  Our waiter recommended an Austrian red that was wonderful and complemented both dishes.  My son liked the starter of honey roasted squash, and raved about the spaetzle.  We shared an apple strudel for dessert and it was just the right way to end dinner.  Service was great, we felt very well attended to.  Loved the ambiance of the restaurant; we arrived early so we were able to sit at a private table, and it felt like a very intimate space.  Later as it got busy it felt more like a joyful neighborhood gathering as the communal table filled and people congregated at the bar.  If I lived in the area I would certainly be a regular here!",0,0,0,Susan B.,"Bridgewater, NJ",0,30,0

5.0,10/28/2016,"If I could give them a billion stars, I would.I moved down the street from Schilling and walked past the restaurant 100 times. I finally went over to take a look at the menu and get a good glimpse of inside.Decor:Rustic, very modern yet relaxed. My dream decor for a restaurant. Such a relaxed vibe and wait for it...it is in a garage! When the weather is nice, the restaurant opens the door so you are basically inside but yet sitting outside at the same time as the front of the restaurant is completely open.Drinks:Amazing cocktails. I have a very sensitive stomach and have to be very careful what I eat or drink (nothing fried or too acidic, the list goes on and on). They have a wonderful array of cocktails and their bar itself is awesome. I have come here just for drinks at the bar. Mixology-feel to the drinks and all carefully crafted.Food:Let's get down to business!Things that I have tried:- Mushroom risotto special (made with 3 different kinds of mushrooms) - I'm not usually a fan of risotto because it is too heavy for my stomach but when they mentioned that it was made with 3 various types of mushrooms, I just had to try it. This was SO light. It was extremely rich but I didn't get that heavy feeling like I need to chain myself to stair-master ASAP.- Chicken - SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good. Chicken in my opinion is very hard to cook. It dries out so quickly and is hard to get it flavorful and moist enough to make memorable. This chicken was beyond memorable.- Steak special (to be honest, I can't remember)My girlfriend is soy free, gluten free, and vegan. She had a lot of options to choose from (other than just a salad) and absolutely loved every bite.People:People? What could this section be? This place is amazing to meet others! There is a very long community table in the middle (which I love) and people are very friendly. Every time that I've ever dined at Schilling, I have met the other tables and people around me.

1.0,9/21/2016,"Our experience at Schilling was extremely disappointing to say the least. Considering the reputation of Eduard Frauneder, we had high hopes for a fantastic dining experience. The interior space is charming, with warm decor and lighting, but that's where the warmth and charm end.Unfortunately, they crammed way, way too many chairs in a very small, narrow space and you end up elbow to elbow with the person next to you, hearing their every word. At the same time you are wondering where in the world your drink is since the restaurant does not adequately staff servers and those they do employ seem to care less about your dining experience or if you made a reservation in advance. If you're a party of two, you'll end up at one giant communal table, and that makes sense if you're at a BBQ joint, but when you're paying $30 per entree or approx $100 - $150 for a dinner for two (with drinks & tip), you don't want to touch elbows with the stranger next to you and smell their cologne.I can't speak for the food, since we ended up leaving due to the awkward, uncomfortable seating and poor, inattentive service, but I'm sure the food is probably the one element that delivers as expected.The talent of the kitchen staff, along with the artistic interior design, is betrayed by a floor plan that was clearly a onstruct of investors and their greed, which unfortunately ruins the entire dining experience. Restaurant owners must remember that ambience and service are just as important as the food for an establishment of this price point and this clearly isn't the case at Schilling.",6,0,0,Angel H.,"Manhattan, NY",2,5,0

3.0,7/9/2016,"When I think Austrian food, I think big. Schnitzel and beer and space to move your elbows.  The space (an old garage) is not large--actually we were quite cramped. The beer was not in a stein, or a glass, but what looked like an oblong champagne flute. There were too many tables, to a point where servers had to excuse themselves as they squeezed through. We had 8 people in our party--I would advise against having a large group.The food was good, so if there is a reason to go, that'd be it. The appetizers were tasty, but along the same lines as everything else, smaller than expected. I safely ordered a schnitzel, which was normal sized, and very good. But they botched part of our order, producing two too many schnitzels and and not enough spatzle. I felt as if Schillings is trying to overly city-fy a very un-urban theme... if that makes any sense... Like shrinking things and sticking them into a garage is cool for some things, but not for all.

Warm lighting, with small lights over the tables that give a nice golden glow, and, from a practical point of view, make it easier to read the menu and see the food. Shelves, one on each wall, hold decorative artifacts that make me think of 50's or 60's European design. The place was not too loud, but that might have been a function of the small number of people in it at 10 pm on a Tuesday. It looked like a great to get some excellent food and hang out with friends, as several groups were doing.I had the Weiner Schnitzel, which was great. Light breading, tasty tart potato salad and a good creamy cucumber salad.  I would go back again just for that.For dessert I had the cherry strudel, and I can't recommend that. I expected more cherry flavor than I got. Portions are of modest size, probably the size we should be eating, rather than the bloated servings that would feed 2 at so many restaurants.
