2.0,3/16/2019,"I mean what can I say- we went for brunch with two kids.  (Ps - I get that no one feels like waiting on kids at brunch - but it's park slope so it kind of comes with the territory.) Had a reservation. Our section had two other tables seated when we arrived.  Two other tables sat after us. It took about 15 minutes for someone to come take out order - which honestly we should have just left at that point because we had kids with us - so that's on us. The food came out about 40 minutes after we ordered. which if you have kids a you know is basically unbearable.  By the time we got our food, one of the tables seated after us was already finished and one of the tables seated before us was still waiting. Got a BS apology about how the kitchen was slow. The food was fine. Not bad not great but fine. Unfortunate experience all in all, could have caught them on a bad day I guess.

2.0,2/15/2019,"The food wasn't great. I ordered the lobster bisque which had no lobster in it. It didn't even taste like lobster bisque. My boyfriend ordered a filet mignon which had no outer char or crust; it just looked like a gray, lifeless, sad piece of meat. There was a baby cockroach running up and down the wall. For the prices they charge, you would think it'd be better quality. This is like a Gordon Ramsey's kitchen nightmare.",0,0,0,Karin C.,"New York, NY",0,21,0
3.0,2/12/2019,"If you stop in, get the seared foie gras. Seriously. It's great.But honestly, don't expect the best steak of your life. Or even a very good one. But it's cheap, which is a hell of a selling point (most a la carte options in the $30 range).I got the 16oz ribeye (which was wet aged, which I'm not a big fan of). It was a bit overcooked (ordered medium rare, and it was pretty medium except for the exact middle). Other than that, it was spiced fine. My friend's filet mignon was similarly overcooked.Also split a few sides - the mushroom spaetzle (very good and mustardy), and the roasted Brussels sprouts with hazelnuts (also good, but could've used more char).Their beer selection is surprisingly top notch, but way overshadowed by their gigantic wine list (the numbering went into the 400s). All price points and styles. The Argentinian malbec we had was good for the price.One last thing to fault them on was our seating situation. Inside was full, so we had a table in the front courtyard area, which was heated (but barely). It was one of the coldest weekends of the year, so it wasn't exactly a pleasant experience (I was wearing heavy wool socks and boots, and my toes were still freezing and getting numb).",3,2,4,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",884,3337,12015

We came for brunch, I ordered the braised short rib eggs benedict and my husband ordered the cobb omelete, but he switched the blue cheesse for cheddar. Both were absolutely delicious!!I also came for lunch. We ordered the lobster bisque, crab cakes, and jalapeno burgers.

1.0,2/3/2019,"I wish I could like Benchmark. I mean the space was charming but small. Tables were a bit too close for my taste and service was quite slow. But nothing prepared my brother and I for our selections. My brother ordered the Scottish salmon with fennel and chorizo, a fingerling potato ragout and piquillo pepper broth. The salmon was the size of a bisquit you would get at Popeyes with at least two pieces of chorizo. I guess everything else was place right under the ""biscuit"" as there was nothing else to view on the plate. As for my order,  the American Kobe culotte steak was even more minuscule than the salmon. The steak amounted to 5 slices of meat but at least they were a little generous with the creamed spinach. I can tell you I've been fed better portions at other establishments for a lot less. If you are starving and looking for a place to eat, my advice to you is to skip Benchmark.",0,0,0,Marilyn H.,"Brooklyn, NY",47,33,0

3.0,12/26/2018,"I went to this location for Restaurant Week with my family. First off, I just want to point out the amount of fruitflies inside this place is insane and one of them flew into my glass of wine. I told the server about this and was hoping he would pour me a new glass from the counter. Instead, he dumped the entire glass of wine and poured a new glass from the bottle I've ordered; that's ridiculous!! The customer service was pretty good and as of the food, it was not anything special. The ribeye was pretty dry and the porterhouse was actually the best dish. The dessert at the end was....eh.

I have eaten at Benchmark a couple of times and thoroughly enjoyed the food and the service.  So, I was very happy to see them listed on Seamless and placed an order.  More than 30 minutes after the projected delivery time, I called the restaurant to follow up.  As soon as I said I was checking on a Seamless order the line went dead... I called back and -trying to take the high road- said I just called to check on a Seamless order and got disconnected.  The hostess replies we're not on Seamless, without at all acknowledging having just hung up on me.  When I explained that they were in fact listed on Seamless and I had placed an order, she went to speak with someone.  She returned and said she was told to tell me that they were dealing with a full restaurant and essentially I'll get the food when I get it.  About 30 minutes later the order was summarily cancelled.  I will never patronize this restaurant again, in person or otherwise.",0,0,0,Linda D.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,1,0

5.0,10/9/2018,"Absolutely wonderful. I came to benchmark on 10/5, my 25th bday and had a wonderful experience. My two favorite things are steak and mash potatoes (and maybe the 3rd is not leaving BK on the weekends); benchmark met all my needs. We started our dinner with the scallops ($11/3 per serving). When i tell you these were the most delicious, buttery and most succulent scallops i have ever taste OMG amazing!! So good we had to get two orders!! The wine list at benchmark is about 12 pages - super extensive when you are used to buying Barefoot and yellow tail - but have no fear, the waitresses are super informed on their wine list and helped us pair a beautiful red for $40. For dinner we had the 24oz rib eye that was absolutely amazing!! very tender and juicy! we paired the al a carte option with the mash potatoes (of course) and cream spinach, very very good.

2.0,8/3/2018,"Went here for dinner tonight and was disappointed. Had an 8pm reservation, but weren't seated until 8:40. The inside of the restaurant is small, and as a result, very loud. Had to ask several times just to get bread. Server was friendly, but not attentive. Had to ask multiple times for more water and it was never refilled unless we asked several times. Food is expensive and not worth the price. Filet mignon was barely cooked and had no flavor. Additionally, the filet mignon entree portion was very small. Brussel sprouts were soggy and flavorless. Bread pudding was meh and the bourbon ice cream it came with was overpowering. Home fries and mac and cheese were decent, but nothing special. The only highlight of the meal was the cookie dough egg rolls and the butter that came with the bread.",0,0,0,Nicole R.,"Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY",79,37,13
2.0,8/2/2018,"Well let me start by saying the wait staff was very attentive and possibly the only reason they get two stars. My wife and I ate here last night for restaurant 'week' my wife got the split pea and mint soup with lobster.. she ate one bite. Lobster looked and smelt as if it had spoiled. I got the white peach salad and it was the highlight of my meal.  For an entree, she got their lentil, olive , cod mixture . I had a stuffy nose and I could smell a horrid smell coming from it. She said some lentils were cooked other not. It was full of salt. I ate the 'filet mignon' I ordered it medium rare. What I received was a pile of salt , prime rib cooked medium with a side of salt and mashed potatoes with extra salt. It was laughable. We drank 4 bottles of tap water because of the salt intake. Dessert she got the Panna cotta which shook like jello- she ate two bites. I got the something egg roll. It was an egg roll stuffed upside down w Chocolate goo moose , with coffee ice cream and walnut slammed dunked onto the plate strewn about. Also ate two bites.So overall -- horrendous. Will not return. Will not speak of this salt factory again.",2,2,0,Josh B.,"Mineola, NY",0,5,0

3.0,6/29/2018,"Don't go on your anniversary if you want a guaranteed good steak meal. I really loved this place for restaurant week but when my bf and I returned for our anniversary we really had a bad experience. The food wasn't cooked as well and our waitress was inexperienced.I came here for restaurant week winter 2018 and it was sooo good. I got the scallop appetizer, steak entree and the cookie dough egg rolls for dessert. The appetizer was ok, but the steak was cooked perfectly, but the dessert was something I've never tasted before and left me feeling like I needed to come back.Unfortunately when I returned for dinner this week, i was extremely disappointed. I ordered an a la carte filet mignon and it was burnt on the outside leaving a bitter taste, though the inside was cooked medium rare. Our waitress brought my drink in a cracked glass, she forgot olive oil for the bread, and forgot the side dish to our steaks. We ordered Brussel sprouts and they came when our steaks were almost gone and the brussels weren't fully cooked. They weren't crispy like cooked brussels should be.Overall I enjoyed this restaurant during restaurant week but I was quite disappointed in my latest experience.

4.0,5/31/2018,"1st the bad - we had early dinner reservations at 5 PM for 4 of us. We rec'd a voicemail from Mark at the restaurant with no explanation. When we tried to return the call (3 times) no one answered. We arrived at about 4:50 to find out what was up - they were involved in a party that was finishing up. So we waited until about 5:20 PM when one of us went in to see whether or not they were going to seat us. And they did. It was odd, however that no one came to get us since we were sitting right in the entrance patio.  We were shown to our table, which was very nice. We ordered drinks only to learn that they ran out of a scotch that was on the menu. They brought a half serving, and stated they would only charge us for half. Right there we should have known! Seriously? You should've just comped us the 1/2 drink (not to mention we later learned that the cappuccino machine was broken and we couldn't order that either!)Now for good, and there was plenty. Our server, who was new was terrific. He was more than accommodating & quite professional. The food was very good. Everything that was ordered was enjoyed by all. That would include the scallop appetizer, the salad, the tuna entrée, the filet mignon and the salmon entrées.  Coffee was good - dessert was fair. Overall, it was a pleasant evening given our servers good humor and quality service. A note to the owners - when you mess up as you did, you should, at the very least offer your guests a glass of wine.  By not doing so you effectively developed zero good will.",1,1,1,Robby D.,"Locust Valley, NY",2,79,19
2.0,5/19/2018,"This is review of a recent brunch experience here. Perhaps their dinner is nice, but my brunch was forgettable at best...We've been to Benchmark before and I remember it fondly, but most recent visit left an unfavorable impression.We wanted brunch and Benchmark was nearby.I ordered an omelette with mushrooms and cheese. The plate looked so bland and boring it was sad. Just yellow on yellow. No color. It could have been spruced up with some basic greens.Toast was like a limp d*ck - just completely lacking in texture or crunch. Almost as if someone microwaved bread rather than toast it.Potatoes were cooked to hell. Just completely solid with burnt crunchy skin.Omelette lacked any seasoning - no salt, no flavor...On top of that - they have house ""ketsup"", which frankly tasted like tomato paste with sugar. I'm not normally opposed to inhouse ketchup or sauce, but it tasted like absolute crap and a nice Heintz could have salvaged lack of flavor on the dish.What really pissed me off enough to leave a review... coffee was $3-4... Not included with brunch even when people pay $22 for brunch combo? Really?And OJ was $8, but not fresh squeezed... rather cheap tasting Tropicana from a carton.Honestly I could have cooked much better meal at home for $3 total.PS. Service and atmosphere were fine. Just food and pricing were pathetic.",0,0,0,Lenny Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,81,158

To try to save the brunch, I asked them to pack our meals to go then ordered a Kobe steak which was very good and tasty but really didn't look or taste like real Kobe beef.

2.0,4/17/2018,"I've been here a few times and in the past have had excellent food and service. To be sure..I've had great meals here where the servers, in the middle of a weekend dinner rush, did not miss a beat and just killed it. This makes for a great dining experience and return customers. Well, last night was a bit different. We were a party of 4.. drinks, apps, steaks, couple bottles of wine etc... The food was still good but the service was just not what you'd expect at this restaurant's price point. While taking our order, when asked about recommendations, our server replied 'steak'. Got it, we're at a steakhouse after all. Then I practically had to force the guy to engage me about any available specials. Maybe just an off night for him but he just seemed disconnected. Not the end all, we still enjoyed our meal.Then towards the end of the meal I got up to use the bathroom and as soon as I walk in (one bathroom in the restaurant) someone is knocking. I open the door and it's our server telling me the bathroom is out of order. I was surprised at this because it did not appear to be out of order and he did not get specific about the details. He then asked that I use the bathroom at the bar around the corner. (I kid you not) Ok so I walk over to LOKI and use the bathroom. Here's the thing: If your one bathroom is not working (I had the feeling they had a clogged toilet) would you not be attempting to fix it (no one was) rather than send customers around the corner????

3.0,11/27/2017,"While staying at a friend's over Thanksgiving break, I made a last minute decision to dine out for the holiday. After looking through several options, I finally landed upon Benchmark as my destination. Upon entering, things seemed a bit chaotic from the get-go. The staff never really communicated with me, aside from taking my order. And during my meal, I saw them force a large group to wait 30+ minutes outside and turn away two couples with strollers, claiming there was no room for their baby's accessories. Also, given how tightly packed the dining room was, my chair at the bar was constantly bumped into my patrons and staff alike (rather annoying when you're trying to put food in your mouth). As for the food, it was pretty good. But, nothing to write home about. The best thing I ate was the peanut butter dessert. Although, I was a bit bummed out because the menu stated it came with ""grape sorbet"". I'm guessing they ran out though, because mine was accompanied by a chocolate gelato, which while delicious, wasn't what I ordered. It just would've been nice to have known ahead of time in case I wanted something else. A few other thoughts on my meal -- the appetizer--beef short rib--was far too fatty. I almost feel as if it wasn't trimmed enough beforehand. And finally, my main dish of turkey and fixings was good for the most part. Though, I'm not sure it warranted the high price tag. The two things I remember most were the turkey that was a bit undercooked and the mashed potatoes that had the texture and consistency of paste. A bit more seasoning would've done wonders for the other items too. All-in-all, it was an OK experience. If the price had been a bit lower, I'd be more inclined to give my meal a higher rating.

1.0,11/8/2017,One of the worst restaurants that I've ever been to! What a huge disappointment. We really want to support our local restaurants but this place was such a terrible experience that we'd never go back. The meat tasted terrible; the fish was under-seasoned; the drinks were disgusting (tasted sweet/sour); the sides were cold & possibly prepared way in advance based on the texture/color/taste.

4.0,10/15/2017,"Gated curbside appeal that opened to al fresco seating in an enclosed secret garden type of way. Ushered into a welcoming living space that felt like there should've been a hearth and piano as it looked out into the garden from three  brick-lined bay windows. The brick matched the wall upon where they upended a stylish bar and blended nicely with the elephant grey interior. Perched comfortably on a corner bench with cushions, we nibbled on mini red velvet chocolate chip muffins with butter as we presided over brunch. I opted for a meat and cheese omelet while my companions ordered the biscuits and gravy, crabcake eggs Benedict and a triple veggie omelet. The 3 egg omelet was among the fluffiness I've had; it encased the most generous and belly satisfying mixture of creamy mild goat cheese folded over a bit of chewy melted gruyere stuffed with chips of fried hard bacon. Wow, I didn't even touch my roasted potatoes and wheat toast that came on the side. It was so, so good dipped in  their housemade spicy catsup (I think it's a mix of BBQ and ketchup) that I put away what felt like a 6 egg omelet with half a pint of cheese. I did try the crabcake Benedict- just a full bite, and it was yummy. Fried golden and topped with a runny poach egg with just a touch of hollandaise, it was crabby fried goodness.Benchmark sets a standard for brunching in style and flavor.

My medium-rare burger was cooked perfectly, but would've been perfect with another pinch of salt. If you're a bit hungrier that day, they offer a pre-fixe lunch menu for $23.

Very middle of the road experience. Service is good, the outside seating is fine and the food was good but lacked punch and flavor. Everything we tried, had something delicious on plate with other items that seemed an afterthought. Had the scallops for app which was my fave course of the day. The scallops were cooked to perfection and the corn puree was fine. Hubby had skirt steak app which was odd, delicious steak stacked with raw tomatoes and cheese.For mains I had the fillet which looked and tasted pre-prepared, more like a roast than a grilled steak. The accompanying truffle mash was delicious. Everything on the dish was either room temp or cold. Hubby had mushroom pasta which he thought was ok.For dessert we both had the key lime cheesecake. It was oddly grainy, when i mentioned to waitress she said its the base and I had to explain that it was the actual cheesecake that was grainy to which she said, that's because it is made fresh.

He asked for medium rare, closer to rare but it was unevenly cooked so some of it was a bit more medium. He asked for it to come with Brussels Sprouts but no one mentioned it comes with bread crumbs; he chose it as the healthy option but the bread crumbs took away from it. The one negative comment is the service. It took forever to have our order taken and forever to get the food. The chefs kept incessantly ringing the bell, and the waiters and waitresses (we seemed to have more than one) either didn't hear it or didn't care, at least until the chef rang it more aggressively.

4.0,4/24/2017,"Very impressive restaurant offering both traditional steakhouse fare alongside a broader, more extensive American menu.  Came here on a family outing and most of us went for the steaks - the Filet Mignon was excellent.  Two of us ordered Medium and one Medium Rare - they were all cooked nicely, though there was really no appreciable difference between them (if anything, one of the mediums was definitely a bit less cooked than my medium rare).  But the flavor was excellent.  The one misfire for me is their creamed spinach - it tastes like spinach that has just had some random cheese sauce dumped on top of it - not of the perfect blended unctuousness you expect from good creamed spinach.  But other than that, a very solid steakhouse experience.  Our one vegetarian in tow greatly enjoyed the Roasted Acorn Squash, a half squash stuffed/filled with curried quinoa and wild mushrooms.  Generally not a huge dessert person, but the highlight of the whole meal for me may have been the Pecan Bread Pudding with Bourbon Gelato.  You might think that a Bourbon Gelato might be overkill with your third bourbon of the night.  But you'd be wrong. Cocktail list sounds interesting, but turned out to be a mixed bag for us - the cleverly-named Rye 'N Gosling's was a disappointment for my wife - with Old Overholt Rye, Gosling's Black Seal Rum, Grand Marnier, Ginger Syrup and Lime, it was billed as a combo of a Manhattan and a Dark 'N Stormy, but was not distinctively either.  The Big Kahuna Bourbon (Beer Barrel Bourbon, Stone's Ginger Wine, Pineapple, House Sour, Fresh Basil), on the other hand, was incredibly enjoyable - like a slightly tropical take on a whiskey sour.  Nice, diverse little beer and wine lists offer enough to pair with whatever food option you go with. Friendly service extended from before we arrived, as they accommodated our need to push our reservation back an hour to the informative and friendly staff.  The interior of the restaurant is small and charming, but the exterior has an extensive tented area which is incredibly well-heated and comfortable to sit in.",3,1,2,Rob W.,"Brooklyn, NY",238,389,571

She looked under the brown paper.. she noticed there was a huge yellow stain (maybe egg?)... anyways... she mentioned it to the waiter and he apologized and changed it for us while we were sitting and mind you I already had an appetizer on the table... which I was annoyed that we had to move everything off the table to replace the table cloth. My salad, the organic seasonal lettuces, was great. My short rib eggs benedict though on the other hand was absolutely tasteless. The short-rib was good, but the whole dish overall was disappointing. I had to ask for salt and pepper to season it myself. Both my friends ordered steak and eggs, medium-rare. The steak portion is nice, but they were a little disappointed as well that the steak was no where near medium rare. The staff itself was nice but I felt as if they were a little negligent. The waiter didn't come by asking if we wanted another drink and when I was done with my appetizer, I was moving my plate to the end of the table and as a bus boy was passing by the table, he did not take the plate.

We tried each others plates and both agree that the gravy sauce was completely undercooked. It was still a stiff thick flour base and dried up and got pasty the minute it came to the table. It was as if the chef didn't let it sit or didn't have enough liquid to roux ratio. It was also very bland with little to no sausage meaty flavor. The biscuits were regular, they did not seem homemade at all. My crab cakes were ""okay"" but the Benedict sauce tasted like it came from a bottle and it wasn't house made. Also there orange juice was Tropicana, not homemade either.

I ordered a burrata mozzarella salad that was a special that day and the bone-in ribeye. It was extremely under cooked. Now i do not mind my steaks rare but I ordered it to be medium. This steak was 100% raw in the middle and should not have been served. After cutting into the steak, I must have taken 2 bites and did not even touch it after, the waiter did not even come over to ask why I was not eating it or if everything was good with the food. He just took the food away when we were finished. I made an emphasis to tell him about my steak and he told me that he would tell the chef about it. Regardless of this whole experience, I still left a 20% tip and me and my girlfriend had to go find food elsewhere. I paid $120 for my meal in cash and would probably contest the charge if i paid with a credit card. This was probably the worse restaurant experience this year.I would not go to this place!!",0,0,0,Igor L.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,144,2
3.0,9/8/2016,"I came for lunch with a group of 6 and think it's worth coming back to try the dinner menu. I gave 3 stars because the crab cakes were average, but I don't think crab cakes are their specialty. I don't recommend the crab cakes. Very little crab and A LOT of filler. The chicken pot pie, lobster bisque, and Joe's breakfast special all looked good though I didn't try any of them.

3.0,8/10/2016,"8th anniversary dinner. It was a Monday and Destefano's was closed. This came up as a steakhouse and they had a Restaurant Week menu. Perfect. 8pm reservation on a Monday. The hostess was so nice and welcoming and made sure to ask if we wanted to sit inside or out. Both areas felt very relaxed and romantic, but we chose to eat inside.  Both the hostess and waiter kept letting us know they were very busy and took our drink orders right away. The bread basket was nice and warm with some delicious spicy butter. So far, so good. I did really enjoy the ambiance of the place , it's perfect for a date or anniversary, but really we're here for the food right? Well that's where it fell short. We didn't order from the Restaurant Week menu because we didn't want to overeat and have leftovers, so we each ordered a filet mignon, mine was ordered medium rare and hubby's was well done, which came with a side of purple potatoes gratin, pesto, and carmelized bone marrow. I'm getting fancy guys. We also shared a side of creamed spinach and Brussels sprouts.  We did wait a bit for the entrees to come out, and when they did we were disappointed. First, we only received 2 slices of meat. Now I don't want to compare, but I'm going to. I've eaten at a few steakhouses, and we've always gotten a full piece of meat. For $30 I should be getting a full piece of meat. Second, it was dry. Hubby's was bone dry and mine, even though it was medium rare was dry too, even the medium part which was still red. The sides were just okay, hubby was not a fan of the Brussels sprouts of the potatoes. I found them mushy. Nothing had good flavor, expect maybe the creamed spinach but that's not too hard to mess up. I think the best food part of the meal was the drinks. Hubby had a drink called Southern Punch was was delicious and my white wine was crisp and flavorful. I was so disappointed by the food because everything else in the experience was actually great. It was still a nice dinner for us, but overall the food left us lacking. I would consider coming back for brunch only because I really liked the rest of our experience.",0,0,0,Suriyati B.,"Queens, NY",35,276,9
2.0,8/7/2016,Service was slow with no apologies. Steak for two is more like a steak for one! If you order the filet mignon you don't actually get a full filet. It's more like two slices of filet mignon. Felt ripped off!! The prices reflect and entire piece of meat and a steak for two should be a size that satisfies two people and then some.

To get to the punch, the food was solid. Nothing amazing, but hit the spot. I had the Eggs Florentine which was yummy and it came with potatoes. We all had their blood orange mimosas. Good stuff. Aside from the food and decor itself, the service was a weird one. Our waiter seemed unattentive and cold. We all agreed he gave really odd vibes and stared at us down like we all had three heads. He had literally no sense of hospitality and we all felt uncomfortable. After we were done, we also waited a fairly long time before getting our check. Props to the busboy however as he was much more on the ball and friendly, refilling our water when needed and actually acknowledging our ""thank you""s.Overall mainly because of our waiter, my rating of this place gets dinked two stars because the food was decent but the service was again, a strange experience.",2,1,1,Alex O.,"Queens, NY",117,226,24

It was a paper type of cover so I had to tear it off as i was gross out from being seated on a dirty table. However, it was a busy busy Sat. night there and it seemes as if thought they were short staffed, so I give it a pass. Otherwise the service was decent, the food was delicious, the wine was wonderful and most of all the desert was amazing.  Ordered: starter dishes scallops & short ribs, Main dish: Scottish Salmon, Filet Mignon both great dishes.

Dessert was also delicious as many have recommended here on yelp I had the cookie dough egg roll - which I liked a lot - my friend had the sundee.  My one complaint was that it was very warm in there (even before I had a drink).  I will be back in the future for sure, but I know that I will wait for ti to be cooler out and request to sit in their lovely tented outdoor section.  Good eats - Salutee and enjoy",0,0,0,Joe B.,"Brooklyn, NY",32,246,18

My husband had the Bone in Ribeye and I had the Kobe.

1.0,6/18/2016,"Unfortunately, my first Yelp review...I first ate at Benchmark three years ago, and it clearly did not have any lasting impression as tonight was the 2nd time I came back (and only because we had a gift certificate we reluctantly had to use). READ the reviews before going to this restaurant...the negative reviews are all consistent and absolutely true. Service: Slow, indifferent, various servers, lacking knowledge, slow,...not caring about food quality or satisfaction of their customers...Food: One word: DISTGUSTING...from start to finish...this is not an exaggeration...my husband (who is in the food industry) and I have never had such a horrible dining experience...and to think, this is acceptable in Park Slope, Brooklyn.  The quality and preparation (or lack thereof) of the food was disgraceful. There appears to be no supervision in the kitchen, no expeditor, no oversight, no quality control, no head chef. If there was, our food would never come out the way it did.Mac & cheese: My toddler son took one bite and pushed it away (and not because it was too ""fancy"" for him). Completely overcooked, mush pasta shells, covered in flavorless cheese and a ""wanna be"" Béchamel sauce. Scallop appetizer: Quarter sized scallops, overcooked/rubbery, too much ""sauce"", too many ingredients. #wayoverpricedBurgers: (We were too ""scared"" to order anything else on the menu, especially at the higher price points b/c of the horrible first two choices.) We both ordered our burgers medium. Both came out raw. I ate around the edge of my burger, which had a horrid taste (and after taste) to it and left the entire center of the burger on the plate. French fries were not hand cut, drenched in salt and large peppercorns and ironically, tasteless.  The burger really turned my stomach. I told my husband not to say anything, as I do not like complaining/conflict/etc...Dessert: Strawberry shortcake: Unrippened (maybe even old) strawberries tossed on top of a store bought, MICROWAVED, shortcake (disgusting), with one small scoop of ""gelato"". We ordered one scoop of vanilla gelato for my son with some whipped cream. He took two bites and pushed it away (just like his mac & cheese). The whipped cream, which was homemade, was without any taste. What can one say when a toddler won't even eat mac & cheese, french fries, vanilla ice cream, or drink the milk that is served.  As the waitstaff came and went, and saw that our plates contained the very food they served (untouched), they never once asked if there was anything wrong...are you that oblivious and lacking proper training in customer service?I walked out, unable to bear any more of Benchmark. My husband called the restaurant after we got home and after he continued to think about how horrible his dinner was. Ryan, the ""owner"" was indifferent, unconcerned, yet ""mortified"" at our experience. He also advised us that tonight was our ""waitress's"" last night...my husband replied, ""she certainly acted like it"". But, what will he do to improve the quality of his food?...probably nothing...READ the negative reviews...all consistent...horrible kitchen staff....poorly trained...lacking food knowledge...you need to train your kitchen staff how to cook...or get people in there who know how to cook...Don't say you weren't warned! #neveragain #nothirdchanceshereExcuse any typos...",3,1,0,Alex M.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,83,137

2.0,3/14/2016,"I visited during restaurant week, February 2016, and boy was it pouring that day. I went during lunch time with my mom and brother - they jested it was a hole in the wall but given it was hard to find and barely had visible signage on the outside I really can't rebut it too much. It was an intimate place and tight with seating, thank goodness it was slow because of the rain. There was a full bar but it was not the time or mood for a drink. It was well lit and tables had linen tablecloth but had a brown paper on top - I guess to make easier cleanup for the table. Service was okay and surprisingly slow considering there wasn't too many people there. It took a while before our waiter decided to give us menus then another wait for him to think that maybe we wanted to order as well. Either way the menus (outside of the restaurant week prefix) were a bit limited - my brother isn't a beef eater and the chicken selections were practically nonexistent and the waiter let us know there's no substitutions on the menu... Well I had the crab cakes and delicious falls short of how good they tasted... the beef short ribs was okay but it could've used a bit more seasoning and for dessert I had the cookie dough dessert with ice cream - because the bread pudding wasn't being served (which is what I mainly came for) - and it was not a good choice. It wasn't my cup of tea because it was like a melted exploded cookie with more chocolate than anything wrapped up and the coffee ice cream it came with was just nasty especially since I'm not a coffee person. The place had its highs and lows, the kitchen being next to the bathroom, seats being so close together, plus it didn't seem like there was not any type of insulation because the place was freezing.

4.0,3/3/2016,"Local Brooklyn eatery which seems to be serving up decent steaks and other fare.  Yelped it and was surprised to find it tucked between two buildings past an alley way.  This was definitely a find whose steak was decent and prices not outrageous.  The rib eye had a good char and flavor so if you're  in a carnivorous mood, this place can be your fix. The seared foie gras was very good as a starter as well as the short ribs 3 ways. I made the short ribs a meal with its ample pieces.  The meat seemed sous vide so it was quite tender.  Also thought the spaetzle was a savory side dish but maybe a little too fussy as an accompaniment.  I would have enjoyed just a plain buttered spaetzle instead of the sauce and mushrooms it had.  If you want it as as main dish, then all the acroutements would be fine but as a side to a good basic steak, I like unadulterated starches.  Plain rice to me would've sufficed.Didn't have room for dessert so will have to come back to report.  It was a perfect round up to weekend eating fest and birthday celebration.   Hope our little local steak place discovery doesn't get so popular that we have to make a reservation which you can and which we did but wasn't really needed the Sunday evening we went.The back end of the alleyway just before the entry way is enclosed with one of those event tents and is an extension of the dining room.  It's an odd arrangement but with a large space heater, extra seating is available if you're a large party.  The bar is not big but there if drinks are all you're having.It's has all you need for a neighborhood go-to place for basic better than diner food!",2,0,1,Wailana W.,"New York, NY",59,309,1103

1.0,1/29/2016,"As others have said, Restaurant Week fail. Advertising a trendy, fine fish and then replacing it with a clunky cheap fish when customers actually arrive is called a bait and switch. I happen to be nursing and can't have swordfish, but I wouldn't want it anyway. Several items from the full menu were suggested to me as a replacement, but of course could not be substituted into the prix fixe. I'm not going to drop a couple hundred dollars at a restaurant whose management/chef shows such disrespect for costumers and for food, so we left.

2.0,1/29/2016,"The restaurant week menu seemed to be of little concern to them.  The fish displayed online was different than what was offered when I arrived.  Because of this, I then changed my menu plans.  I got the beat salad.  It was bland.  No flavors.  It was very simple.  The filet mignon that arrived was cooked to 2 different degrees.  I ordered medium rare.  The filet was sliced in half, I'm assuming to assure its temperature, and it was served as is.  One half was very rare and one half was closer to medium.  Did they intend that I average the 2 temperatures together?  Then the dessert came, which was unique to the restaurant week menu.  And again, the cheesecake was subpar.  It was burnt around the sides.  This was my first experience.The service was great and they kept refilling the water, but that was the only positive.And to top it off, I used one of the wall outlets to charge my phone and now my phone no longer holds a charge.  I'm looking into this using my warranty but the whole experience leaves me feeling unsatisfied at best.",0,0,0,Jordan J.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",15,11,1

The space inside can be small and a bit loud, so recommend sitting outside. The quality of the meat is high, and the filet and rib eye both deliver. The bordelaise is spectacular.

5.0,11/22/2015,"At first I thought it was a little pricey and the menu was tiny. They were booked full except for seating outdoors. They only had 3 servers which made service a little slow for a booked full dinner service. The waitress was really polite and the waiter came by many times to refill our water and give us more bread while we waited for our food. The duck liver was cooked perfectly and very appetizing but the serving isn't something to be shared with. It's only enough for one person. I don't like chicken breast because it's always so dry wherever I order some ""tender chicken breast"" but eating it at Benchmark was a whole new experience. It was so juicy and tender with stuffing. The sauce was creamy. One thing I dislike was chickpeas because whenever I order it, it's so gritty and dry. The chickpeas that came with the chicken breast was soft. My friend got the tuna ahi. He said  he thought it was amazing but he liked my chicken breast meat better. I liked his tuna ahi better though. Anyways, after that he ordered coffee and he said the coffee was better than any other cheap because it didn't have that sour taste after. I guess I was more used to cheap coffee and I missed the bitter sour aftertaste. I think if you get coffee there without milk it'll taste better because putting milk in it makes it taste like warm water. Then we go desert. My friend got the strawberry shortcake. I got the cookie dough eggroll. I definitely recommend the cookie dough eggroll. You get instant food coma after the first bite.",5,3,4,Susan Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",128,59,74

4.0,8/8/2015,"Do I think Benchmark has one of the best menus and flavours in the city? Yes!However the service was terrible. Our waiter was so astutely confused, it makes me furious. Hopefully management can cater and solve the problems. 1. Know your food, when a waiter doesn't know anything on the menu, he doesn't deserve to be employed. 2. Mention aoli- if your patron asks about aoli on all dishes mention it on the main! 3. Your job as a waiter is to read people, and offer them service. When I'm out of water it's not ok, and when we are engaged in a convo, don't try to pack away our plates when there's food on our plates. Don't you dare rush me on a 200,00 ticket amongst 3 people. 4. When we order drinks for food, the gap bt food are drinks shouldn't be tremendous, and if you're so vapid either don't work as a waiter, or ask, better yet listen when we say we want our beverages with our food. 5. When a customer orders a soup, don't steal half of it away in your container. That leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 6. If management can't hire competent staff, perhaps the best way to deal with them isn't by the kitchen yelling at them. As entertaining as it was, not with the ambiance ur trying to create, not when were spending at least 75.00 pp for dinner. 7. Don't treat ur clearly knowledgable customer as a moron, when one says well done, don't ask if he knows the meat will be hard, consequently when one asks for meat to be med raw, don't say it'll be pink.

It was just a fabulous setting and fun atmosphere. I am still getting compliments from our guests.  The food was fantastic and the staff did a great job getting everyone served which was no easy feat since the ceremony was attended by well over 100 people including 21 children.

Everyone told us that they had the most fun there and that it was one of the best receptions that they had ever been to.  Mike and I wholeheartedly suggest this establishment to anyone looking for a place to hold an event.  Our reception has left us with so many wonderful memories, and we are looking forward to celebrating many anniversaries there at Benchmark in the future.  We will always appreciate the staff's hard work, and help in making our dream vow ceremony and reception come true.  Sincerely, Claire and Mike and of course, Liora Rose",4,1,7,Claire M.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",82,12,6

1.0,5/16/2015,"Just had an extraordinarily disappointing experience! It took approximately 25 minutes for a salad to come out, then 15 minutes later they brought the same salad to our table, which obviously meant that they have not fired our main courses.  When the meals did come another 25 minutes later, it was clear that they have been sitting under a lamp for a significant period of time (sauces had film on them, eggs were dark and stale on the outside). My friend's steak was medium-well even though he had asked for rare.  I had asked for a side salad instead of breakfast potatoes, and then somehow got french fries. Two coffees were never refilled the entire hour and a half we were there. No one brought a steak knife. No one brought salt-and-pepper. No one asked how our food was.  The most bizarre thing was that these things have been promised to us, like a steak knife and a refill on coffee. And they never materialized. The table behind us actually got up and left before their food even came out, so there was clearly some kind of systemwide failure today.

The oysters are blue points from Long Island and were fresh and tasty.For an appetizer I had the pan seared scallops with risotto. They were cooked perfectly with a lovely, buttery sear. I only wish this came as an entree because I could eat 10 of those plates. That's how tasty it is (the wait staff did say I could get it as an entree, so that is awesome). My partner had the ribs three ways, which was delectable as well. For dinner we each had the filet done mid rare. It came with some potatoes, vegetables and a parsley pesto sauce. The pesto was perfect to compliment the meat and rich potatoes. It had a pallet cleansing aspect that let you really savor every bite. The meat was cooked correctly. For dessert we had their house made cookie dough egg roll. Who ever came up with that is a genius. It has salt, sweet, hot, cold, crunch and more. It is also the dessert you get for free if it's your birthday. The service was good. It may be perceived slow by some, but if you are with guests you have a nice atmosphere to talk and bond.

4.0,3/29/2015,"I stumbled upon Benchmark after deciding not to trek out into the city for Restaurant Week. Being only 1 out of 3 Brooklyn restaurants to participate, I'm glad I was able to experience this place.Tucked away in an alley in a Brooklyn neighborhood, the decor reminded me of a very classy restaurant on a cruise. It may have been the layout of the tables and the shape of the windows. Make note of it the next time you go. The bar is beautifully lit and grand and the entire wait staff was more than accommodating. As per the typical 3 course meal, I chose the seared scallops as my appetizer, the shrimp crusted halibut as my entree and the grapefruit honey cheesecake with rosemary ice cream for dessert (yum).The seared Scallops were bedded on top of Black Winter Truffle Risotto, Kabocha Squash, and topped with crispy Proscuitto. The creaminess from the risotto along with the sweetness from the squash melded beautifully with the saltiness from the proscuitto. The combination of all three complimented the plump and juicy scallops, making it a very cohesive dish. For my entree, the Shrimp Crusted Atlantic Halibut with Mashed Sweet Potato. The sweet potato wasn't your typical orange sweet potato yam but it reminded me of Korean yam or 'goguma'. The halibut was soft and flaky which went exceptionally well with the hearty mash. Dessert was a Honey Cheesecake with Rosemary Ice Cream. The cheesecake was rather heavy and reminded me of a blondie more than anything. The Rosemary Ice cream on the other hand was really refreshing and light. Overall, I was really impressed with not only the food but the ambiance and service. Best of all, half off wine bottles on Mondays which is a always a hugeeee plus for me!I would definitely consider coming back even without the Restaurant Week special.

Still no food. The table next to us, which ordered a few minutes before us, got there food about 45 minutes in, sent one dish back, got it returned to them, and still we had nothing. At that point, finally, our waiter acknowledged over his should to us, ""your food will be right up.""  This was after an hour.  When it hit 2pm we left $10 on the table for the bussers and and coffee/tea and left, because there was no one even on the floor to flag down and ask for the check. The hostess opened the door for us and wished us a ""great day"" probably because she thought we already ate. I understand it was a crowded brunch, but to not know that someone was sitting there, without food or acknowledgment for over an hour is just poor management.  Even a backed up kitchen shouldn't take that long, someone made a mistake and there wasn't enough staff working to fix/notice.Too bad, the menu looked good.",1,0,1,Steph D.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,123,1

4.0,2/20/2015,"My friends and I decided on brunching it up here (yes, I made the word up but it sounds like it could be a legit word) for my bestie's bday. Finding a parking space in Park Slope wasn't too difficult; actually, it was pretty darn easy considering we found a spot right in front of the restaurant. Alright, maybe that was mostly luck. Located alongside Loki's, Benchmark's storefront is an outdoor patio room shaded by a white tarp. You have to bypass the outdoor seating area before entering the restaurant and boy were we happy to get inside. It was ten degrees outside! Eagerly claiming a booth, I noticed that the decor was rustic and warm. Soon, our waiter came over and informed us that the pipes broke (understandable, considering the crap weather) but their sister restaurant next door had two bathrooms. Ordering off their Winter Restaurant Menu, I requested their pan-seared crab cakes with southwestern slaw and chipotle aioli. C* ordered the Maine lobster bisque and B* got the braised beef short rib. bit.ly/1ztMBj5Wow, my crab cakes were perfectly crunchy on the outside, moist and flavorful on the inside. The slaw had a bite from the crisp jicama slices and the chipotle aioli provided my appetizer with the kick it needed. bit.ly/1CWI5Nu 5/5B*'s beef short ribs were tender and succulent. Her parsnip puree complimented the ribs beautifully and the verdant parsley pistou gave the heavy dish a refreshing lift. bit.ly/1vPYgXP 5/5C*'s Maine lobster bisque was nothing to write home about but it was warm and hearty. The drizzle of pesto helped give this broth some dimension. 3/5Finally to our entrees. I ordered the salmon with fingerling potatoes and spicy chorizo. bit.ly/1AYRWn1 The salmon was moist and the potatoes were cooked so well. I didn't care for the chorizo, which C* gobbled up anyways (yay, no waste!). I thought the meat and fish didn't compliment each other well. B* and C* ordered the Benchmark burgers, which came with their homemade catsup and garlic aioli. bit.ly/1DBQLvD Their fries were just yum. They must have been fresh off the fryer and then lightly tossed with salt. B* and C* said that the burger patties were thick and juicy, like really really thick (""Like thicker than my thumb!""-B*). We were stuffed beyond our limit, but then the desserts came. Boy, did we try to delay that. We told our waiter to take his time bringing our last course to the table (""Walk slowly!"") B* got the chocolate mousse and dulce de leche gelato with pistachio crumbles. C* and I received the strawberry white chocolate bread pudding with vanilla bean ice cream and lemon caramel. bit.ly/1vPYPRs I am sad to say this but I enjoyed B*'s sinfully sweet dulce de leche gelato over my dense and chewy bread pudding (I love my bread pudding!). I, however, did enjoy the chunks of macerated strawberries they embedded in the pudding. Overall, our experience at Benchmark was highly enjoyable and satisfactory. Would we go there again? Maybe if we stumbled around the area. Personally, I felt that their sides were better executed than the main dishes themselves. Those fries were cleaned off the plate and the gelato was scrumptious. If B* didn't claim that dessert, I would have stolen it from her. My last comment is that I commend them for making their own condiments. Next time, we will consider ordering from their tempting wine menu.",5,1,1,Tina C.,"Plainview, NY",518,122,844
1.0,2/16/2015,"Me an my husband totally love the place, and are not strangers to say the least. The food is usually cooked to perfection and the wine list is great and versatile as well.However, yesterday, Valentine's day 2015, was a complete disappointment from an old friend like Benchmark.First, the place was on a prix fix menu (which is understandable) and it was completely overpriced. I say that for few reasons: the portions were very small, though delicious. On a regular day I would pay half of that price and get a normal size serving and not these ridiculous portions that could barely fill up a young kid.Second,  If you were to add wine pairings you would pay extra $35 per person only to get 3 shot glasses filled with wine, to be served 1 glass with each dish.Third, in my honest opinion, Benchmark made a crucial miscalculation regarding the ratio between the number of their guests and their true capacity to produce a well balanced dinner for such a busy day. I was waiting to receive my first plate for over 15 minutes, and so was with the rest of the servings, excluding the desert which took over 20 to arrive at out table. I only feel bad for the personnel who running crazy over the place and still could not satisfy the guests.I believe that Benchmark is long time in business, therefore I don't understand how they would make such a miserable mistake. I really hope that they are not planning to make this a way of action on busy days like Valentine's, because if greed overpasses the quality and the good will to serve your guests, then Benchmark is going down at a fast rate.I will sure be back to Benchmark because the food and the atmosphere are wonderful, but hopefully they will conclude their conclusions and this mistake won't repeat itself.",1,0,0,Ira B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,0

3.0,1/18/2015,"We were seated within minutes of our Sat night 7 pm reservation.  The restaurant is small and cozy with lovely decor. The server came over quickly and answered our questions about the menu. We both ordered the culotte steak and a side order of the charred brussel sprouts. When the brussel sprouts arrived (not charred by any means), they were covered with a crumb looking topping. My friend asked if it was a nut or bread crumb topping, to which she replied bread crumbs, and we requested it without that, since my friend has a wheat allergy. We got a fairly dirty look from the server, but explained we would have asked for it without had it been described as such on the menu. Looking back at the menu today, it is described as having a hazelnuts- so seems the server was not familiar with the preparation, and we missed out on something that may have well made it a decent side dish.  My culotte steak was rare, rather than medium rare. Fortunately, that was fine by me.  But why is it necessary to slice my steak for me? Both the steak (while very tender) and the creamed spinach ( a bit gloppy) were woefully under seasoned, and I needed to request salt and pepper since the shakers were not on the table.

It's the holiday season and we fully understand that restaurants get booked. But the whole approach when we asked to be seated inside was utterly disturbing. I noticed a few open tables and asked nicely if we could have our family be seated in one of the open tables since I've eaten here in the past and had a very pleasant experience. Instead of the host apologizing for not having any tables available, he made a remark and said that we took the last reservation for the night and that the only table available was the one closest to the door in the canopy outside!! Really??!?!  Trust me, I would've taken the table outside anyway and wouldn't have waited.I must say that the approach could've been better and as a customer it would've been more pleasant to hear him say that the next available table for 4 people to sit inside will be an hour or so wait, two hours or something!!! Instead I felt that this jerk guy was calculating my group to determine if we were fancy enough to sit inside the restaurant. As for the food, there was a reason I returned with my family. Excellent pork and their meats were aged and seasoned perfectly. The lobster salad was delicious.I just wish the greeting could've been better.

It had huge chunks of lobster meat and was very tender but the jalapeno peppers made the dish a bit too spicy for me. For entrees we got the veal porterhouse, ribeye, duck and the american kobe. The veal porterhouse was alright, nothing to really write home about. The duck was pretty good and the flavors were definitely there but a bit overcooked. We had asked for the ribye rare but it came out almost medium which was pretty disappointing since the flavor of it was good. The american kobe was cooked perfectly and one of the better entrees of the night. We also got the fries and brussel sprouts as sides and both were really good. They were huge portions and only $7!

1.0,9/30/2014,"My hubby & I have been coming here since it opened & have to say it WAS our go-to place in Brooklyn.  Showed up for the first time without a reservation last Sunday and was treated like we had the plague. Previously, you walked into the restaurant to be seated, so I did like I always did and walked to the doors.   A new spot for the ""hostess"" has been set up at the entrance of the outside dining area.  Was never there before, it's in the corner, in the dark & not noticeable, but then again, if the ""hostess"" was there to begin with, problem #1 would have been avoided.  I am literally at the doors of the restaurant and SHE, whatever her name is, comes barreling at us and demands to know if we had a reservation, not asks, demands.  Then marches us back to her station at the front & nastily starts poking at the screen to see if she had any seating.  I point out the available table for 2 and she then huffs, actually huffs as she takes us to our table.  WTF? Rude much?  Customer service at it finest I see!   We're looking over the same boring ass menu with its 6 tired choices & all I thought to myself is, I'd rather go to the Chip Shop right now.  Time to change it up chef!  Apparently the place was packed.  It has a closet-sized kitchen & the staff obviously can't handle a crowd.  If that's the case, stop adding tables & stop sacrificing the quality. The food here used to be exceptional.  Everything was meticulously prepared & delicious. Now its just overpriced mediocrity at best.  First thing I ask for is bread because I'm so hungry I'm ready to chew my own arm off. Our server, Dave, the highlight of the night, is pretty damn awesome & obviously knows what he's doing. The hubbs orders his usual, lobster bisque - was rich, thick, silky with huge chunks of lobster, now it a runny, watery, mess sans lobster. After soup we get a generous portion of 3 slices of bread.  Hey Thanks!! Why did everyone else get a basket & we got 3 slices on a plate? Meanwhile, throughout the night, anyone who passed my table would fill my glass of water.  How about you leave my water alone & get me my damn food! Hubbs orders double order of scallops over bed of risotto as main course.  I order the filet mignon, medium.  All meats are prepared under here so I know ordering a medium will get me a medium rare.  Half hour later, water refilled 50 times, scallops come on a bed of soupy, overcooked, bland risotto.  It looked like slop on the plate.  Gross!!  My filet mignon should have had a warm red center with perfectly charred exterior.  What I got was hockey puck exterior with a cold, blue center. The pesto on my plate left a nice oily streak & the gratin was a purple mess.  Ordered a side of spaetzle, got more mushrooms than dumplings and also ordered a side of goat cheese mash, no goat cheese & flavorless. Took 2 orders of mac & cheese home for the kiddies & I swear I wanted to jump in my car, drive to the benchmark & smear it someones face. So overcooked, that the pasta lost its shape. It was supposed to be shells with Wisconsin  white cheddar & smoked pork. NOTHING!!! No flavor, no cheese, no pork.  I paid for that shit??  Unbelievable!!   It's a shame really.   You used to be one of those awesome Brooklyn hidden gems, and now you just suck.

The burger and fries were so tasty and I truly enjoyed the crabcakes.  Dessert was ok. They did not have the bread pudding so we had to settle for the egg roll and the chocolate dessert.

3.0,8/13/2014,"Decided to come here to take advantage of the Restaurant Week menu. Since we're from Brooklyn, this was one of the handful of BK options so we gave this place a shot. Ironically, we didn't order anything off the RW menu. The choices were fine, but the regular menu seemed more enticing -- and the prices were not much different compared to the RW deal. Since it was a nice night, we ate outdoors and it wasn't too packed on a Thurs around 7.Our selections:Spiced olives for starters. A nice portion in a small bowl. Not all olives tasted ""spiced.""Organic Lettuce salad with goat cheese was decent. Nothing too special. The portion was good for two people.I ordered the filet mignon with purple potato gratin and crispy marrow on top of this green pesto sauce. I requested medium rare and I got exactly that. The meat was soft and juicy. The flavor was great, but I didn't finish the gratin. My husband ordered the American kobe in medium rare. It was good too, but not as tender as the filet mignon. Both of the presentation was nice.For dessert we ordered the fresh strawberry white chocolate bread pudding with vanilla gelato. I just remembered there wasn't any fresh strawberries, but there was some pink drizzle garnished atop of the dessert. The vanilla gelato was the best part.Overall:The service and decor was fine. The food was decent, but I wasn't too wowed. Not sure if we'd come back again. Might seek other options around the hood first.",1,0,0,Kathy C.,"New York, NY",2,26,4

4.0,8/7/2014,"Went here for restaurant week with my boyfriend and had amazing food! I ordered the BBQ pork turnover and it was delicious, the fillet mignon was actually cooked medium as I ordered rather than medium-well (a lot of places don't get it exactly right), and I had the most delicious dessert which I have to go back for and get another because it was so yummy: cookie dough egg roll. The cookie dough egg roll was served with coffee ice cream which I am not a fan of... Would have been better with simple vanilla ice cream. Next time I will have to ask for a substitute of vanilla for the coffee ice cream but if coffee ice cream is your thing then I am sure you would like that.Only cons I would say was the wait staff seemed to forget about out dessert as they cleared out plates and we waited another 20 or so minutes for dessert.

3.0,8/3/2014,"Sat outside on a lovely night for dinner during restaurant week 2014. Our waiter was pleasant and we put in our order for drinks and meal. Within three or four minutes our appetizers were already on our table...no drinks, but appetizers. Happy to have been served so quickly but it did feel slightly rushed. My boyfriend absolutely loved the pork turnover and I thought the chilled pea soup with lobster was also delicious. Halfway through appetizers, our drinks arrived. At that point I noticed that other tables had been given a breadbasket but we had not. I was disappointed by this as a piece of bread would have been perfect with my soup but I didn't feel the need to ask for any. After our appetizers were cleared away, suddenly our bread basket arrived...appetizers, drinks, bread basket. What!? Very disorganized obviously. For main dishes, the filet mignon was excellent (nicely cooked) but the acorn squash was quite mediocre. It was a half of an acorn squash filled with quinoa. There was nothing interesting about it. Not the greatest vegetarian option.Then came dessert. The panna cotta was good although it was the cookie dough egg roll that was truly memorable - a total overload of sugar but heavenly for anyone with a real sweet tooth. Crisp egg roll shell filled with warm, gooey chocolate chip cookie dough. All in all, food was good but service was disorganized and inconsistent.",4,0,1,Sol C.,"Cambridge, MA",176,625,950
1.0,7/29/2014,"This is the absolute worst dining experience.  At the beginning of the meal as I stood back by the kitchen waiting for the restroom I heard a server say, ""Wait, these aren't nectarines...""  As she picked up a salad which had been described with the accompanying fruit.  The chef (if it's at all possible he could have been a chef) didn't respond as she picked up the dish from the line.  This interaction proved to me that whomever was in the kitchen did not care at all about what the guests were experiencing in the dining room.  When I got back out to the dining room the guest next to us had asked to send her hamburger back to the kitchen as it was ""still frozen inside"".  After her dish came back to her a second time she sampled it and then waved the manager down again to inform him that it was still frozen and to please ""just take it off the check"".  We hadn't even received our drinks at this point and I was certain that the whole experience was going to continue to go downhill. Our dirty martinis were terribly over-brined. We ordered a ceviche which looked as if it had drowned in green, tasteless sauce.  My boyfriend took one bite and pushed the dish away from him.  The fish was bland and the shrimp were tiny, frozen rock shrimp.  When the server came to pick up his completely untouched dish she didn't inquire about his experience, but just thoughtlessly took the plate away.The service was completely inattentive, probably because they knew what a terrible experience everyone in the dining room was having. The food was terrible from start to finish.  Our ""rare"" bone-in Ribeye was well done and charred all the way through, the creamed spinach was inedible, and the potatoes were grainy and tasteless.  We asked to speak with a manager at which point we sent the entire meal back.  After the interaction with the manager our server dropped the entire check without having taken off our meal, which just further proved the complete lack of communication between front and back of house.  We both sat there in complete disbelief for several minutes until another waitress came over and hurriedly apologized for delivering the ""wrong"" check.",5,0,1,Pepper P.,"Brooklyn, NY",32,82,28

3.0,7/8/2014,"3.5 stars.The meal was a belated birthday gift for one of my friends. Being that she loves her food, I am sure she did her work researching on Yelp to find Benchmark. I made reservations at 6pm on a weekday, just in case, but only three other parties joined us by the time we left around 8pm.They have half off bottles on Mondays so we popped a bottle of sauvignon from The Paring. The waitress recommended it, saying it was a sister vineyard of some other one, in which they were selling bottles at $200 each. Yikes, The Paring costed us $30 and it was a decent wine that tasted fruity and then left us with a dry after taste.We shared the scallops and the foie gras appetizer. I wasn't thrilled about the scallops. The three of them came out in different sizes and they weren't impressive in size. The risotto under it was tasty though with a nice crispy bite from the shreds of pancetta. The foie gras, on the other hand, was delicious... It went really well with all the flavors, especially the pineapple! Again, the portion was quite small.She ordered the cullote steak medium but it came out more medium rare. She didn't mind and it tasted alright. I had ordered the bone in ribeye and didn't realize it was going to be gigantic for me... More than half of it went into a doggie bag. It was tender and fatty, a bit unevenly marbled, but it was at a very good price! I say if you like a saltier dry rub, go for the cullote. We ended our meal with the cookie dough egg roll based on other reviews. We both thought it was way too sweet unfortunately. The espresso ice cream made it slightly better once we started eating it with the egg roll.Benchmark is a very quaint, small steakhouse. It would be very good for dates if you don't want to venture out of Brooklyn for some steak and our waitress seemed super nice.

So we started our trek to the restaurant and fairly excited to try a new place. We walk up to the hostess and she tells us that she gave away our table because we were a half hour late. We asked to speak with the manager and he tells us the same thing and why didn't we call him. I asked the same thing.So you could guess my reaction wasn't to pleasant. We left the place with a very bad taste in our mouth and wouldn't ever recommend this place to anyone. If you are looking to eat at this establishment, show up the day before or they will give your table away.  Mind you they had plenty of seating still available, it was that we showed late and didn't call them.

5.0,6/3/2014,"They say beauty doesn't last forever. Stop scaring me!Besides, I know that's not true. Look at Benchmark. No way this place could ever look bad. This is one of the most gorgeous places to dine in Park Slope. If it's not freezing cold or super hot (you know, the only two types of weather New York has), you must take advantage of the gorgeous open front. There's nothing better on a nice evening. The ambiance is fantastic. Do yourself a favor and check out the pictures. Words do it no justice. I've been here several times with friends or family and never had a bad moment. The closest time was when we came and I got a waiter I had never seen before. The kid seemed real young and inexperienced. After forgetting our order and botching things up, my friend started ranting and raving that the kid was high. I assured him, no way this kid was high. After two more interactions we were all convinced the kid was high. My friend isn't the most patient of people and was letting his anxiety get to him. I told him to chill. I spoke the manager very politely explaining the exchanges we experienced. She came over and quickly rectified the situation. Questions were answered, my friends got their correct orders and we all got two drinks comped. Except my friend who was having a meltdown. He only got one. Being chill goes a long way. I love their soups. Whether it's a lobster or corn bisque, it's always fantastic. The pork chop is huge. One of the biggest and tastiest I have ever seen. Their stuffed meatloaf is heavenly. The duck confit is delicious. Obviously though the stars are the steaks themselves. The filet mignon is butter. Loved the New York Strip. For dessert, I'm a sucker for their cookie dough egg roll. Yeah, you read that right. It's with espresso gelato and I hate espresso. That's how good it is. Their cocktails usually have funny names, which make me laugh. The cocktails themselves though are no joke though. They pack a strong punch. It's like a bodybuilder named Melvin. Very deceptive. Fantastic beer and wine menu as well. In the end, this is wonderful steak place, right in the heart of Park Slope. Go on through and tell them Mitch sent ya.They have no idea who I am. It would just be funny if people keep telling them that Mitch sent them.",10,11,7,Mitch E.,"Brooklyn, NY",846,1050,451
5.0,5/31/2014,"I've now been to Benchmark four times - twice for dinner and twice for brunch - and it has been excellent each time. For dinner, the specialty is steak, although they have several fish and non-beef options, as well as daily specials which encourage repeat visits. I've had the duck and the filet mignon, and both were cooked perfectly with tasty sides/sauces. What sets this place apart as a steakhouse, however, are the prices, which range from $25-30 for all but the specials and larger cuts. While Peter Luger is in a class by itself, I notice no difference in quality between Benchmark steaks and those at Manhattan and DC restaurants that now cost upwards of $40, and certainly into the $30s. The closest comparison is Ray's the Steaks just outside DC, which also serves reasonably priced, top-quality steaks.Other highlights of Benchmark: Cocktails -- very tasty, strong and inventive. These are not the kind that you often see where a bunch of obscure adjectives suggesting a creative cocktail mask what is essentially an Old-Fashioned or Manhattan. Prices are what you'd expect for a nice restaurant in Brooklyn now - $11-12. They also have a huge wine list that we have yet to try.Dessert: We've had the chocolate trio both times, and it's basically a twist on a sundae that's absolutely amazing. Highly recommend.Decor: Benchmark is nice both inside and out -- lively but not too loud indoors, and one of the nicest outdoor, non-garden seating areas you'll find. The outdoor seating is in front of the restaurant, but not adjacent to the street, so much quieter than most. Brunch: It is very good -- the duck/goat cheese omelet was delicious, and they have all of the standard brunch choices you'd expect, although not as many original or creative options. The bloody mary's were solid, and as mentioned, the outdoor seating area is ideal for a nice weekend brunch.All in all, this has become one of my top two or three favorite restaurants in Park Slope.",6,0,2,Russell B.,"Brooklyn, NY",116,9,0

5.0,5/14/2014,"This was our second time here so I feel like I can accurately declare that I wasn't just tipsy the first time, this place truly is a culinary experience to be had. First time we dined, we started with the seared foie gras and the short rib trio, then had the filet and the pork chop. While everything was truly delicious, the pork chop... out. of. this. world. So the next time we went last night, we of course got the pork chop again, but switched it up for everything else. We started with the lobster bisque and scallops. The lobster bisque was delicious. The scallops were the best I've ever had, just inexplicably tasty. Then we had the pork chop and the duck this time. The duck was delicious, perfectly tender and rich, everything you want from duck.Then.... what we didn't have room for the first time, we sprang for this time... the cookie dough egg roll with espresso ice cream. Made me wish that I hadn't gorged myself on the rest of our amazing meal so I would have room for this heavenly creation. Finished it off with a yummy pineapple coconut sorbet for a palette cleanser. The service both times was very attentive and friendly. When the outdoor seating isn't available it's quite a small space, but has a very romantic atmosphere. Prices are exactly what you'd expect from a casual fine dining restaurant in Brooklyn but in terms of fine dining period, this place is quite cheap.

I went here this past weekend for a friend's bday. Since there were a bunch of us we had a pre fixe menu. Initially I wanted to cry because nothing on the menu sounded appetizing. After the meal, I wanted to cry because everything was so good and I was about to slip into a food coma. This place is really tiny. I'm surprised they were able to fit all of us. There were 16 of us in total. But after having to add a few extra tables to the end, they found a way to make it work. The staff was really great and attentive. They were right there whenever you needed anything. Despite being a bunch of us, we never really had to wait long for drinks or our food. Now onto the food. For appetizer I got the scallops over risotto with prosciutto. The scallops were really good but this dish was all about the risotto. It was some of the best risotto I've ever eaten. My entree was filet mignon with purple potato gratin. The potatoes were good but definitely not the best potato gratin I've ever had. I like my gratin a bit more creamy and cheesy. My meat was so good. I ordered it medium rare but it was closer to rare. I didn't mind it all. I like my meat rare but other people might have an issue with it. I literally scraped the plates of my first two dishes clean. I was so full I did not know how I was going to get through dessert. I'm a glutton who would never say no to cookie dough, that's how I got through it. I ordered the cookie dough egg roll. I don't even know what the other two choices were but once you see cookie dough egg roll, do you really need to look any further? It was amazing and anyone who comes here should get that.

1.0,3/4/2014,"After we left, my girlfriend and I agreed that this was one of the worst dining experiences we have ever had in New York.We decided to come for restaurant week. We had a 8:30 reservation and when we got there the hostess said they were ""running slow"" that night and that if we wanted a table inside (a reasonable request for NY in February), it would be a 25 minute wait. What was the point in making a reservation in the first place? They also had my phone number, but never bothered to call to let me know that our table would not be ready at 8:30. She said our options were to wait for the table, sit at the bar (which was in a high traffic area and very high up to eat a meal at), or sit at a table outside (in the 20 degree weather). And to top it all off - she didn't even apologize.We were going to sit at the bar when she told us they just replaced the propane tank for the heater outside, so we decided to sit outside instead. I was expecting some kind of complimentary item - or something to show they actually felt bad for messing up our reservation and to show they cared about our business - but nothing came. I also point out that I overheard a table next to us complaining that they were forced to sit outside too (they had a 7:00 reservation) - I felt even worse for them because this table sat out there BEFORE they refilled the propane tank. To top it all off, they were celebrating their poor kid's birthday.Our waitress was very nice and apologetic when we told her what had happened.  My girlfriend ordered a glass of the tempranillo, and was told that they were out of it (and the malbec). We both chose the cabernet instead, which was very good and easily the best part of the meal.We both ordered the scallop appetizer. It was OK, scallops were cooked well, but not memorable.  We also both ordered the filet mignon. This was a huge disappointment. The meat consisted of 2 hacked up slabs of filet. The horseradish mashed potatoes were inedible - and I LOVE mashed potatoes. There was so much horseradish in them that you couldn't taste anything else.  There was also supposed to be creamed brussels sprouts with the dish - I thought that I saw brussels spouts mixed in the mashed potatoes, but my girlfriend disagreed and thinks they were left off the plate. Even if they were mixed in with the potatoes, the description on the menu was very misleading.We ordered the chocolate cremeux and the cookie dough egg roll for dessert. The  chocolate was fine, kind of bland, but the ice cream was very tasty. The egg roll was interesting - I didn't love the combination of the fried egg roll with the cookie dough.Overall, this was a very disappointing experience and not even close to being worth the $120 we spent on the meal.

3.0,3/3/2014,"Went for a midweek dinner during restaurant week. Showed up without a reservation and the hostess acted disgusted at us and acted like she was doing us a favor to see if there were any open tables. After waiting for a bit we told her we were leaving and then we magically got seated immediately. Aside from that the service and dinner was pretty good. Scallops were not very good, but the short rib was awesome. Filet mignon was cooked nicely and the polenta was also very good. A little more expensive than I'm used to, and not worth it in my opinion.

We were already frustrated with the traffic but so happy to finally reach the restaurant for our 3pm reservation (we arrived at 3:11pm). The hostess very rudely let us know that we would not be allowed to sit for lunch or anything at all, even though we made a reservation and there should have been a table waiting for us.

4.0,2/11/2014,"Second time at Benchmark this past weekend, and I was really satisfied once again.  As quite some time has passed since the first, this rating is only based on the most recent.I had the Lobster Bisque to start, and then the Pork Chop meal as a main.  Both were very flavorful, plentiful, and happyful?The bisque although not as creamy as other bisques I've had before, had a ton of flavor and spice.  For those who don't like a peppery-infused flavor, this might not be something for you.  Great portion as well.The pork chop was about the size of War and Peace, and was cooked perfectly.  Such a perfectly tender cooked piece of meat, which still maintained the juices effectively.  I have found that people sometimes tend to make pork dry, but in this case this was not so.  A little on the salty end as I got closer to the bone, but still was a great taste.  This came with a polenta puree and I believe apples as well.  Both were great adds.  I forgot to mention that there was I think an apple cider based sauce on the pork and plate which was amazing!  I really can't say anything bad about this item.Other folks at the table got the American Kobe steak which was decent.  Medium means med rare, FYI.In my humble opinion, Benchmark offers such a great variety of meat, fish, and vegetable related entrees and appetizers that it is really a good option for small and larger crowds alike.  Ambience is nice - we sat in the heated atrium which is like a Bar Mitzfah style tent with a heated lamp, and even in the 20 degree weather it wasn't bad at all.I'm definitely going to go back to Benchmark - the spot has so much to offer.",3,0,2,Luke W.,"Brooklyn, NY",227,112,9

We sat promptly, she asked to take our coats to coach check...nice gesture. We had a cocktails and wine- pretty good. Special of the night was a new england clam chowder and tbone steak, which we ordered. We also ordered lobster bisque as a starter. Clam chowder was DELICIOUS, the lobster bisque was good, would've loved it if there were chunks of lobster in it, as I like it. Along with the tbone steak which we had cut up with a side of dipping sauce, we ordered the potato puree(mash) and creamed spinach sides. The steak was ordered medium and it was delish, the only thing I did not enjoy was the outside of steak - it was a little too burnt but the middle was made perfectly. The potato puree (mash) was good, however we did not enjoy the creamed spinach and we are creamed spinach lovers. Not sure how they make the cream but it was just okay.

That is at no fault to them but I figured I would share my dismay. One thing they can control though is a $3 cup of coffee, sub-par coffee.

It was certainly tasty enough, but for $11, I was kind of expecting the infusion was done in-house. The lack of sediment in the drink led to me to discover that huckleberry vodka is just another dumb sweetened vodka you can buy in a store. I didn't order this, but given my experience, I would also be suspicious of 'Black trumpet rubbed tuna'. I am picturing a fishery where they have a single black trumpet mushroom under glass, and they put the tuna in the same room as the mushroom for a few minutes.- Risotto underdone, to the point where you had to chew the rice a bit.- Brussels sprouts (over? under?)done, to the point where I thought I was going to sprain my jaw trying to eat them all. Absolutely unacceptable at a $50/person place.- Sourcing bona-fides dubious. All the beef is 'pasture raised', but the menus and website say nothing about where.Now on the other hand:- The burger was pretty darn good for $13. Nice crispy char on the meat, cheddar cheese apparently sourced from cheese heaven (so rich!), and they make their own ketchup (this time I believe it). - Ambiance and lighting are very relaxing, and service is warm and functional.Basically I would go to this place, chat with the staff, and eat the burger.",0,0,0,Bret H.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,186,7

Both tuna and meat were cooked to perfection, juicy and delicious.Beautiful presentation, excellent wines and cocktails -- and reasonable prices.

I could not be happier with the experiences that I have had at Benchmark. I will be back several more times before I am dead.If a reviewer gives this place any less than 5 stars in his/her review, maybe they are in need of a personal review. If you give it 4 stars, for what culinary experience are you reserving that fifth star? Anything less than 4 stars, you probably experienced some sort of human error for which a little patience and empathy could easily compensate. Where is your ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes? Perhaps there is no helping you because nothing will ever make you happy? Benchmark is awesome.",5,0,5,Conor H.,"Brooklyn, NY",84,3,0

The food is always fantastic & service is always great.If you've never been here, I suggest picking a day with gorgeous weather and getting yourself a reservation for dinner outside. The patio is lovely! My picks:Drink: R-Train (The bartender Spider makes a mean one), and lately they've had a Huckleberry Lemonade that is super tasty, especially on a warm day.Meal: Go with friends, order a la carte (Filet, medium), and get some sides to share (Hand Cut Fries are to die for, and Mushroom Spaetzle is delish).Also can't go wrong with the Ahi Steak or Burger (medium, add bacon and cheddar... yeah I went there...)Dessert: Cookie Dough Egg Roll. Don't ask questions, just do it.What can I say, I live in the area and this is one of my go-to spots. I've had dinner here more than brunch, but I've never had anything here I don't like.

My french toast was pretty burned and ice cold. My husband's Benedict was pretty good though.  Then the waiter poured coffee into my tea.  When I caught that he apologized and took my tea away and said he'd bring a new one.  About 15 minutes later he finally came with the tea on the same tray as 2 mimosas which he accidentally dropped, shattering the glass everywhere. He was very flustered by this that he knocked over my piping hot tea and it spilled all over our table.  The restaurant was relatively quick to pick up everything and move our food (not us) to another table.  We eventually asked if we could just sit at the other table and they reluctantly said we could. They brought us mimosas and orange juice as an apology but I really just wanted my tea.  Another 15 minutes goes by and we finally get my tea and new water glasses.We were so uncomfortable that we wrapped up the rest of my french toast and got our desserts to go.

With a disaproving and annoyed  tone in her voice she sort of brushed me off with a simple answer and took the order... That said, the whole thing was a waste of time because the specialty drinks we ordered were pretty bad. We ordered a few appetizers as well. The foie gras, (which was very good I must say), Duck confit salad (dry tiny morsils of possibly duck.. but who knows) and the cheese sampler platter (so so..) . Once we were half way done with our drinks every single waitress was coming up to us every two minites asking if we would like another round.

4.0,4/9/2013,"Benchmark is a steak place, but their vegetarian dish blew me out of the water.  On a chilly day, the acorn squash stuffed with curried quinoa and vegetables was just what I needed to warm my insides.  I didn't even think I liked quinoa (just sounds pretentious), but this had been cooked with creamy coconut milk and the perfect combinations of spices. It was amazing with the tender squash that surrounded it.  I had to take half of it home because it was in the middle of a 3-course meal, but it was just as good for lunch the next day.  My first course was some kind of salad that I remember being pretty good.  I had the cookie dough egg rolls for dessert, which were out of this world delicious.  The hubs enjoyed his appetizer and dessert, but was kind of disappointed with the crabcakes, which had filler in them.  He was stealing bites of the curried quinoa, too.The atmosphere of Benchmark is quiet and romantic, and the patio is very quaint.  The fact that it's set back from the street makes it seem removed from the world.  The surveying equipment on the walls is cool.  I would definitely recommend it as a date spot or place to take your out-of-town parents.  If you have a weird schedule like me, the prix-fixe at lunch is a nice little indulgence.",1,0,1,Briana H.,"Brooklyn, NY",104,177,20

However, we really enjoyed ourselves and I thought the meal was fantastic.The ambiance is great -- it's intimate and inviting, and very warm. I loved the exposed brick and earth tones, and our corner half booth/half table was incredibly cozy. Our service was good. They were also having a 1/2 off bottles of wine special that night. We of course took advantage of that. I also tried the Southern Punch (because it had St. Germain in it and I have to order anything that includes it). The cocktail was made with their house-infused tea vodka, and was delicious.All of our food was really incredible. The scallops were large, sweet and perfectly cooked. The short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth tender. The Filet Mignon was perfectly cooked, and one of the best pieces of meat I've had in a long time (sorry, Hubby - haha just kidding!). It came on top of this brussel sprout-mashed potato concoction that made me want to lick the plate.Desserts were also all incredible.

Six of us came here for a b-day brunch this passed weekend and since I had never heard of this place, it was a pleasant surprise for me. The muffins they start you off with are yummy as are the choices of cocktails. I settled on the bloody benchmark, as did one of my friends and we were very pleased, although next time it'll be the 'up in smoke' for sure. They have a special for 14$ which included an appetizer and entree. Even though I'm not a huge fan, I ordered and really enjoyed the gazpacho. My entree was the benchmark burger and I was very impressed since this place is not solely a burger joint. Other entrees at the table included the eggs florentine, benedict and frenchy omelet as well as another burger.Service is very pleasant and attentive. Never pushy and knowledgable. The food did take some time to come out, but I don't mind waiting a little longer for good food. The price tag wasn't too bad, around $120 for six.Really want to come here in the spring/summer because they have significant space for outdoor dining it seems. Even in the winter they set up tents with heat lamps so you can enjoy the best of both worlds. Inside is clean and comfortable. You never feel like you're on top of anyone and you're not shouting your conversation. Will come here again, both for brunch and hopefully for dinner.",1,0,1,Anthony F.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,14,0
1.0,3/3/2013,"How anyone can say the food and/or service is good at Benchmark has clearly never been to a decent restaurant. i've been twice and both times it was a shitty experience.First time was New Years two years ago and we were rushed thru our mediocre meal. I don't remember all that much now but I think that says something.Now....my meal today is what has prompted my first Yelp review. The waiter looked at us weird when we asked that at Noon we get two Bloody Mary's. Don't give me a skeptical look when I order a drink. The drinks did not arrive at Noon. It took the bartender 15 minutes to make them. Were they any good? I had to rush home to make my own because their's was so bad. Drinking it now as a type.My girl's omelette was made with pre-shredded cheese that was not melted. If you can't make a decent omelette you've got a problem. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger. The bacon did not come out with the burger and the cheese was on the wrong side. Who serves cheese on the bottom? They don't have normal ketchup, they have something called Catsup. If you serve your own ketchup it better be good. Overall, the burger had no flavor and all the problems up top make this burger a poor attempt at an American classic.The two dudes next to us got their food in maybe 5-10 minutes while the couple on the other side waited 30-40 minutes for their food. They both ordered at the same time. The bus boy poured me water when I had a pitcher of water on the table. The waiter started to pour coffee into my green tea. When I protested he spilled the coffee on the table and then said ""oops I missed"". Then did not clean it up. The list goes on and on. And you would think that all the problems above would be enough. But oh no...I have one more.The girl next to us is wearing a t-shirt with a kitten on it. The waiter says ""I like your shirt. There is a great Confucius quote about cats."" Nobody cares about your damn quotes especially when it's from Confucius and about cats.I will never go back and strongly suggest you do the same.",2,0,0,Shane J.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0

The atmosphere inside is super cozy, with a bunch of candles and mirrors, but nothing to extravagant.  It is small, but actually still pretty quiet and peaceful.  We were seated very quickly, given water and bread, and asked about our selections for the evening. My aunt informed them of her gluten allergies, and they answered all her questions with a lot of options and alternatives.  We both ordered off of the Restaurant Week menu, which did not disappoint. She started with the scallops, and I the short ribs.  Both were perfect portions for an appetizer, and had amazing sauces on top of them.  I can't tell you what it was, but it was green, not pesto, and delicious!!! For the entree, I ordered the acorn squash with quinoa, wild mushrooms, and other winter vegetables.  I was floored when half of a roasted acorn squash was set down before me and had been filled with the quinoa mixture.  It was beautiful and delicious.  My aunt had a wonderful filet with brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes.  She said it was incredible, but I was too consumed with my own food. For dessert, I had a to-die-for piece of banana peanut butter bread pudding.  It had a scoop of vanilla gelato with it... words just cannot describe.  The bread pudding was warmed, and the combination of the two was just out of this world.  I would go back just for that.",2,0,1,Samantha B.,"Manhattan, NY",35,21,0

1.0,1/2/2013,"We came here for New Years- the menu looked great and we thought we would take a chance. We were sat 30 minutes after our reservation because our table wasn't ready yet- annoying since we were on a time crunch trying to make the fireworks in the park at midnight.  Once we were sat, our server took a good 10 minutes to greet us and he was so underwhelmed, you could tell he was not happy about having to work New Years Eve which made us a little uncomfortable. The first course was great- the lobster was tender and fresh (although there was really no reason to include artichokes, the two flavors don't really mix well) and the scallops were very tasty, even though they might have been a little undercooked. For the second course we had the soup (porcini mushroom bisque with truffle)- inedible.  It was almost sour. For our main course we ordered the Porterhouse steak for 2 (an extra $20 per person) which we would have been happy to pay extra for but the creamed spinach and mashed potatoes were cold.For dessert we ordered the caramelized banana split and their version of a tiramisu- both which were gross. The banana was wrapped in a wonton wrapper (there was no indication that was going to be part of the presentation) and the tiramisu had a carbonated sensation which was just weird. Overall we were bitter about paying about $300 for our experience and having the best part be the bottle of wine that I ordered. If it wasn't for the rush to go see the fireworks, we would have spoken up about the service and food, but there just wasn't enough time.

2.0,1/1/2013,"My review is specifically about our New Year's Eve experience. Holidays are key for any restaurant to provide stellar service, excellent food and unique environment. Benchmark missed the mark on 2 out of 3. It wasn't for their lack of trying we don't think but it ended up really ruining our night. They had pre-assigned tables so that didn't leave any room for flexibility. We were the first of two tops to show but they sat others ahead of us because it was their pre-determined spot. Left us waiting at the bar for 20 minutes past our res-NOT good for NYE dinner timing. We did get a round of free drinks but bc of lack of communication bw staff and mgrs we were asked to pay and had to relay the comp info. Once we sat at our long awaited table, they gave us the seat next to the screaming babies and loud game playing 5 year olds. The staff was showering them with attention and praise even though the surrounding tables were uncomfortable and frustrated with the environment the family imposed at 9:30pm.All of the food except my husbands steak was a HUGE disappointment. Dry, overcooked and bland. You could tell everything sat under heat lamps and was precooked long before dinner service.We left before midnight bc we just couldn't get over the disappointment.Again, service was great overall but give these people something to be proud to serve and flexibility in seating that allows customers to be accommodated on time.Thanks for reading and best of luck.",2,0,0,Stephanie K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,1

2.0,11/24/2012,"We were looking for a interesting restaurant in Park Slope that could accommodate a fairly large group (about 15). Not as easy as it seems as but we came across Benchmark and it looked interesting enough to give it a whirl. The restaurant is big enough for two fairly large parties plus a scattering of other tables. One strange thing was that when we entered the place, we came into a private dining area and had to walk through where people were eating to get to the hostess station. A little odd but glad we weren't dining in that room. The interior was nice enough but unassuming.Service was mixed. The wait staff was very nice enough but a little discombobulated as you will read about later some more. After our large party settled in, we started with a round of appetizers. I started with Organic Seasonal Lettuces of crisp yucca, black pepper roasted strawberries, goat cheese and truffle vinaigrette. I wasn't overwhelmed and a fairly small plate for the money. For my entree I had the Scottish salmon done quite nicely. It came with chorizo and fingerling potato ragout. The wine menu was extensive and we enjoyed a nice and inexpensive Oregon Pinot. Ordering the wine took a bit of time as it took a while to get the wait staff's attention. On the downside, I had ordered a side of charred Brussels sprouts with pancetta and hazelnuts. It was basically inedible as it was significantly undercooked prior to grilling and hard as a rock. Lastly, we ordered some group desserts and coffee. The desserts were fine but the coffee was cold as can be. Apparently they turned off the heater on the coffee urn hours previously and they didn't even notice it when they poured out the coffee for 6 people. In both cases the staff was apologetic but in the end it's made me reluctant to come back - there are a lot of other places to try. I should note a number of the other guests there liked their entrees, in particular the steaks so all was not lost.",1,0,0,Chris C.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",19,187,94

3.0,9/23/2012,Solid restaurant but feel it is a bit overrated from the expectations I had from reading other reviews.  Went on a Wednesday night & did not have to worry about dealing with crowds or a loud environment.  My girlfriend & I had an appetizer that was a special that night but not normally on their menu so I will spare the review.  My girlfriend & I split the Seared Duck Breast & the Kobe Culotte Steak.  Both were really good but nothing out of this world.  The service was good and the atmosphere is decent...nothing spectacular.  I will say that there French Farmer cocktail is really unique & worth stopping by the bar for if you're in the area.  They also make a real good Dirty Gin Martini.  I recommend stopping by at the bar for a drink & having an appetizer before deciding on dinner.,1,0,0,Brian D.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,19,19

3.0,8/7/2012,"I enjoyed this little spot in Park Slope. I was excited to visit NYC for work during restaurant week.   I was staying at Hotel le Bleu a few blocks away and needed a restaurant in walking distance.  I only got as far as the outdoor seating area, so I can't comment on the inside of the restaurant, but the outside was great - perfect spot for a mid-summer night's dinner.  We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation.  There appeared to be plenty of tables open, but the hostess made us wait for one specific table to be cleaned before we could be seated.  No biggie - we were early.  Once we were finally seated, our waiter introduced himself, brought us water, then disappeared for awhile.  Honestly, I was visiting with a college friend and we were catching up on 5 years of stuff, so that didn't bother me.  My food was great.  I ordered corn bisque, the filet and something chocolatey from the restaurant week menu.  I was especially impressed with the corn bisque.  My friend, a vegetarian, wanted to order the macaroni and cheese from the regular menu.  Unfortunately, the mac'n'cheese came with some kind of pork in it and the waiter told us it could not be altered.  I find it strange that a restaurant has only a meat version of macaroni and cheese, but since there was something else on the menu for her to eat, we let it go without a fuss.Overall, if I were back in the area, I would absolutely check it out again.",0,0,0,Danielle Y.,"Gaithersburg, MD",218,15,1
4.0,8/6/2012,"My wife and I and another couple really enjoyed our dinner here. The style and ambiance of the place is great. We sat inside as it was a pretty hot and humid evening, but on a crisp fall evening or warm spring night dining outside would be perfect. The food was excellent. We had the scallop app and it was very good. We all got steak: two kobes, a filet, and a ribeye. Each was cooked perfectly. The goat cheese mashed potatoes and the purple potato gratin were excellent sides. My wife also go the roasted brussels sprouts and said they were fantastic. They have a nice selection of wine that ranges from a good deal to very expensive. (We went with the good deal.) This is def.  a great date place or a place to bring family who is visiting from out of town. It's def part of the rotation now.The only reason this is 4 and not 5 stars is the service. It can be spotty. For the most part our waiter was good, but two things stood out: When asked by one of us ""how the meat was raised"" he seemed flumoxed. Now, Benchmark markets itself as a local and farm-to-table place, so it's certainly not a crazy question to have an answer to.Also, at the end our waiter vanished. Okay, so he took a break or whatever. But he just vanished and then it took forever to get our check. We had to ask another server three times for it. It's not that big a place, nor was it that busy.These are relatively trivial issues, but as Benchmark is a bit more upscale than others in the area, I guess I'm being a little more harsh than I ordinarily would.",0,0,0,Tom W.,"Charleston, SC",3,60,0

2.0,5/18/2012,"this review is more for the staff and managers than for other customers..  For food I recommend, for service don't even bother.  I took my mom there for brunch and was left in the pay no mind table.  It took 5 minutes to get water alone, and about 5 minutes to get glasses to drink from after that.  The salad was good, but too bad we didn't have any utensils to eat with.  Finally they brought us settings.  The main courses were brought I had the eggs benedict, I asked for salt and pepper and some Ketchup and hot sauce.  It never came I broke  my eggs and they were cooked pretty perfect but I wouldn't know how good it was fresh cause i still didn't receive my condiments.  My mom ordered the steak, looked great but she did not have a steak knife only a butter knife.. at this point I had to get up go to the hostess counter to be greeted by a snobby asian mix looking girl who said she'd bring over a knife, salt and pepper over right away she did in about 3 minutes.. She asks if she can bring anything else I looked down and looked at the knife and said yes please bring me a clean steak knife (it was noticeably filthy like someone cut into a piece of cheese with it) she grabbed it in a huff, mumbled something and shuffled off coming back dropping the knife on the table and walking away.  At that point my eggs were drying up a little, so I didn't really get to enjoy them.  Now for dessert.  We were so full we asked to have our sweets wrapped the waiter said Nope the kitchen is backed up i said how about this you bring me containers i'll pack it myself he said SURRREEEE no problem.  Great.. well the dessert came out with a bus boy.. still no sign of the waiter, couldn't even eat them because Guess What...  we had no spoons or forks!!!!!!!   Finally after the cakes are all nice and warm the waiter comes out with a surprised look on his face and hands us the containers... no thanks just give us our check of course he was on top of that a 100$ bill for having to run around to get my own silverware condiments and for a dessert I couldn't even eat or pack cause it was too melty at that point..

4.0,4/23/2012,"I really like this place.  Slightly off the beaten path down an alley on 2nd Street, the place is intimate, warm and inviting.  I first ventured here on a Monday night, only to discover that Mondays are half-price off the entire wine list!  At some places, that's not a big deal, but Benchmark's wine list is rather impressive, with some serious gems for the taking.  If you're an oenophile on a budget, come here on a Monday.  Otherwise, the menu is your basic ""New American"" list with a slight steakhouse orientation.  Their meat is fantastic, as evidenced by the ribeye steak and the burger I had, both of which were delicious.  The burger was so good, in fact, that I commented to my wife that I saw no reason to ever bother with Bonnie's burgers around the corner.  For $2 more at Benchmark, you get a burger that is infinitely better, imo.Let's not forget the outdoor space.  The alley that you walk down to enter the main dining room doubles as an outdoor seating area during the warmer months.  It's lovely, feels very private, and is a great spot to just chill with some drinks and apps, or have a full-blown meal.  The last piece of info I'll leave you with - and this is of paramount importance - is this:  even if you're stuffed to the gills, blind drunk, or extremely short on time, you need to do something when you come here.  You need to order dessert.  Sounds simple, and it is, but don't let yourself be talked out of this by anyone.  (Cue the caps lock)  COOKIE DOUGH EGG ROLL.  Miso caramel, espresso gelato, and walnuts.  I think I just cried a little.",5,2,2,Joe L.,"South Orange, NJ",317,398,322

The acorn squash was so interesting. I'd never had it before but wanted to see what it was like; it wasn't the consistency I expected but it was so smooth. It was served with a little mashed potatoes (to keep the roasted squash in place), and the plate itself was appealing to the eye. Two open faced roasted squash halves on a plate. Simple and elegant. The dessert was good but nothing I'd scream to the moon about. The real piece de la resistance was the short rib appetizer. There was some sort of balsamic reduction on it. God.

3.0,3/11/2012,"Ok so, I was craving a steak and rather than spending $300 for 3 people at Lugar's we decided to stay in the Slope and try Benchmark.Benchmark is a cool looking spot tucked back off 2nd St, one of the Slope's most beautiful streets. The long outdoor seating area looks great for summer dining or drinks and butts up against a small dining room, elegantly decorated, with a small bar and high ceilings.We were greeted by a friendly and accommodating hostess and seated immediately for our 7:30 rez. The wait staff was also friendly and accommodating.FIRST COURSE:After a cocktail we were served our apps-Short Ribs, Scallops and Foie Gras. All were tasty and well prepared. The short ribs were excellent, a trio of nicely portioned carne.Scallops (3) served over a risotto were also very nice, perfectly cooked and seasoned although the risotto was a bit undercooked.The Foie Gras was just OK and seemed slightly undercooked, but overall very flavorful.MAIN COURSE:We tried the Ahi Tuna, 24 oz Rib Eye and the Duck Breast.Our sides were the Brussel Sprouts, Goat Cheese mashed and Home Fries.We also ordered 2 glasses of the Napa Creek Cab to arrive with dinner.The Ahi was pretty good although, a bit over cooked for our ""rare"" request. My 12-year old, a gourmand in her own right, enjoyed it. Unfortunately my wife and I were very disappointed with our selections.The duck was over cooked, dry, and bland. The menu said ""Leg Confit"" but my wife couldn't find any or it was so little it was indistinguishable from the sweet potato hash.My  wet aged, corn finished, 24 oz rib eye was a $32 disappointment. Although clearly a prime cut, it was also under flavored and fatty. It wash't until I got close to the bone that there was any real flavor.  I found myself covering each bite with the mashed potatoes, which were excellent.We are all big fans of Brussel Sprouts but these were so heavily peppered that they were inedible by my wife and daughter. It also seemed like all the pancetta and hazelnuts were piled in one corner of the small cast iron pan and not infused into the dish.The home fries were actually good but definitely order the Habanero Salsa on the side. We did assuming that it would be on top. Good move, it was not for the faint of heart.One note on the Napa Creek Cab  (by the glass selection)- make sure you like oaky wines b/c this one must have lived in the tree not the barrel.DESSERTAfter we finished we were upfront with the waitress and she was very appreciative of our candor and removed the sprouts from our bill and comp'd us the Cookie Dough Egg Roll dessert that was tasty but small. We ordered espresso and the bread pudding, which was OFF THE HOOK delicious.COSTThe bill, with 3 cocktails and two glasses of wine and tip was $280. We tipped on the full bill before comps. One last thing, we are very cool with LGBT but the 2 woman sucking face at the bar should get a room...My 12-yr old daughter couldn't stop starring. IN SUMOverall, we should have gone to Lugar's for the extra $20 and a guarantee of a great piece of prime porterhouse rather than a less than stellar rib eye.It's a shame that the meal was so inconsistent. RATINGI'm giving a more than generous 3 stars because the waitress was so nice and accommodating.

4.0,1/17/2012,"Went here for Restaurant Week, and specifically picked this placed because they had grass-fed filet mignon. I couldn't tell the difference, but all the steaks were great. I had the braised beef  short ribs, filet mignon, and the cookie dough eggroll. The egg roll was so good; it was warm and went well with the cold espresso gelato. Wife had the trio and American Kobe. We also had the fries, which were decent on their own, but the aioli dipping sauce was the perfect condiment. Overall food was excellent and service was great.

4.0,1/16/2012,"I wandered in there accidently for early dinner on Fri.  I'm just looking at the reviews now, and perhaps you shouldn't go during restaurant week or for brunch.  As someone else said - it's a steak house.  The NYStrip with the bone in was delicious and large enough for two meals.  The scallops were wonderful.  Butternut squash with quinoa was fine.  Smokey beer was unusual and a nice addition to the steak.  We were warned that medium rare meant that the meat was served with a center that was a bit cooler than usual, which meant a flavorful dish that was not overcooked as it often is.  Wait staff was helpful.  On another day, their New Year's eve special (my wife and I chose Porterhouse for two) was wonderful, and the special holiday price was fine.",2,0,1,Jack C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,26,0
5.0,12/12/2011,"It's gotten mixed reviews, mostly for service and attitude, but they seem to really have gotten the memo: everyone we dealt with was outstanding -- host, bartender and especially waiter. All were gracious and friendly without being overly solicitous.  Lots of good guidance on menu selections, without being pushy or pretentious. They let us sit for 3 hours on a Sat night, and checked in on us just enough. (When we looked at our watches and saw how much time had passed, almost felt bad we had taken the table so long!)This might  just be the best restaurant in the whole area that takes a reservation (sorry, Al Di La, James, etc. -- I just don't have the time or patience for your indifference to my convenience). I'd certainly put it above Rosewater, Applewood and a few others in that tier.My momma taught me that when you go to the steak place, you don't order the fish, but . . . my wife and I got tuna and salmon, and were really satisfied. Among the best we've had of (let's face it) a pretty tired, cliched offering. They were both great pieces of fish, generous portions and excellent, creative preparation. The other couple got steak and venison and were very satisfied (steak was a little salty, and a half-notch too thin and too rare, but friend admits he's almost impossible to please!). Fries, salad, spaetzle, drinks and dessert all wonderful, too!

A dessert menu that will make you cry (in a bad way, especially if you - like I - have a religious hatred of white chocolate). More on that final point: The Chocolate3 (cubed, actually, typographically - but the waitstaff called it a trio) was actually a glass full of melted gelato, chocolate sauce and decomposing cake pieces that looked a lot like how I imagine my vomit might appear if I ate a normal Brownie Sundae at some other restaurant and then stuck my fingers in my throat. Extremely disappointing - wish we had just gone down the street to any one of a half-dozen restaurants on 5th Ave with much better dessert - or even grabbed a cone from Uncle Louie G.  Even the fat-free greek yogurt I have in the fridge at home sounds better at this point.Our waitress totally forgot that my wife asked about their tea selection with the intent (obviously) of ordering something.

1.0,8/29/2011,"My boyfriend and I went for dinner at Benchmark before stocking up on groceries on a Friday night. A bad mistake... First of all, the service was all over the place, we waited up to 45 minutes for our main course and almost got to the store too late. The waitress obviously did not have any knowledge of wine, and the waiters kept getting the tables confused - we were offered other peoples food as well as wine, despite the fact that we obviously already had drinks on our table. When finally the entrees arrived we were starved despite the fact that we had an appetizer. Secondly, the food... Where do I start? We both ordered steak, which I though would be a safe choice at a steakhouse, but we were sadly mistaken. My boyfriend's ribeye was sinewy and barely lukewarm, and my filet mignon was soggy, lukewarm and tasted like liver. I go to steakhouses all the time through my job, and I have NEVER had such bad steak. The temperature at which the steaks were cooked must have been too low, because the nice sear of the surface you normally get was just not there, and the inside (I ordered my steak medium-rare) was just mushy, not tender as it should. This was ten times worse than the leftovers I have taken home from real steakhouses! The only saving grace was the fries that were decent, and that's what we ended up filling up on. With that quality of food we gathered it wasn't worthwhile sending it back, and we didn't have time for it anyways after the long wait. Over all, this was one of our worst eating experiences in Brooklyn. The only positive thing about the restaurant is their outdoor space which is lovely. Not lovely enough to make us go back though.",0,0,0,Monika A.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0

What a delight to encounter a beautiful, shaded patio behind the corner bar (please see my pict) with tablecloths and flowers all over the place.  We plopped ourselves down and waited to see the dessert options.  Wow, everything sounded good from the ""Chocolate"" to the ""Raspberry Bread Pudding"" we couldn't decide so we ordered 3 different desserts and a few cappuccinos.The cappuccino reminded me of the traditional Latin ""Cafe con leche"" with it's depth and creaminess invading my nostrils.  The ""Chocolate dessert"" was delicious with a mixture of chocolate cake, chocolate ice cream, chocolate mouse that just melts in your mouth.The best dessert was the Raspberry Bread Pudding.  We were all staring down each other to see who would lift their spoon first to get that last heavenly bite.The restaurant was nice in itself, with brick walls, nostalgic memorabilia lining the walls and the rounded, arched  windows and doors, reminiscent of an old style carriage house.Wait staff was very friendly and the place looked quite upscale for a carriage house.  Good dessert and coffee.  I want to go back just for the bread pudding.",2,0,3,Emily Y.,"Kew Gardens Hills, NY",87,443,456

So the food comes out, first the salad, then the rest of the meal.  My meal looked decent and tasted decent...thought the chicken was a bit questionable, I was worried if it was cooked properly, so after poking at it a couple of times, and cutting it, it was cooked, but still had me worried. The bf's meal looked scary...the breakfast potatoes looked like sliced raw potatoes tossed in grease and  he said the short rib tasted like boiled meat and lacked flavor...he picked at my fries because they were good and crispy and stole some bacon from my sandwich to try to make his eggs a little tastier.  So we finished our meal and it took about another 15 minutes for our waiter to come back and ask if we were ok, if we wanted dessert...we just asked for the check because we wanted to leave.  Yeah, I will not be going back to this place EVER!Excuse me as I go pray!",4,0,0,Judy C.,"Brooklyn, NY",39,240,9

1.0,4/3/2011,"Oooooooooh i feel really bad about this, and I've put it off for so long but benchmark is just a big huge fail. We've given it 3 whole hearted tries, and each time has been bad bad bad. First visit (previous review) we were the only people really in the restaurant, and that burger was just so tasty I figured everything was fine & we'd surely be back for said burger sometime. Then last weekend, stone park had a longer wait than usual and so we meandered down to benchmark. We were seated immediately outside - it was cold but sunny, and we were bundled - and promptly forgotten. 10 minutes went by, then 20 with no coffee, no water, no menu nothing. Finally our patience ran out and we awkwardly left. It was completely nuts, it looked like one poor over worked girl was covering the entire patio alone - a good 15 -18 tables. Stone Park was waiting for us when we got back. We should have learned our lesson. This weekend, weather was gorgeous so again a longer wait than usual at stone park. This time though we couldnt' wait, the bf had to get to work. So we gave benchmark another go. We were told 15 mins. As we waited, we saw another couple seated before us. I approached the host and he didn't acknowledge what had happened, but all afluster, he rushed to seat us. Took about 10 minutes to get water and I had to be a little pushy to order coffee and bloody marys with our water - but after experiencing how long you have to go between having a servers attention i thought i'd better take advantage of it. Food took what seemed like a VERY long time, and when it finally arrived... OH the disappointment. I had crabcakes benedict, which were rather cold and don't appear to be made in house. The poached eggs were perfect, but the hollandaise had broken into a really gross glob on the side of the eggs, leaving only a slick of grease atop. the accompanying potatoes were grey and sad and greasy, resembling a pile of brains. Oh, and cold. The bfs biscuits and gravy were cold, and had clearly been sitting out - the gravy had a skin.  I'm sorry benchmark, we won't be back.",3,1,0,Miranda R.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",13,313,4
4.0,3/31/2011,"""Dine in Brooklyn"" Adventure # 2:My boyfriend and I went walking up 5th* Avenue looking at menu after menu trying to find which restaurant we would enter for our 2nd ""Dine in Brooklyn"" experience. After stopping at a few windows we finally chose ""Benchmark"".First Impression: The entrance is really pretty with rows of out door seating. The inside of the restaurant is warm and classy.The first thing they will ask you is whether or not you have a reservation, so I suggest you one. Appetizers: I went with the Goat Cheese & Strawberry salad. The strawberry balanced the bitterness of the greens and the moistness of the cheese very nicely. Entree: My boyfriend and I both went for the Steak with Potato Puree'  and [fancy word for spinach place here]. The steak was delectable, compliments to the chef!My overall review: Atmosphere: Warm and classy. The historic theme makes it that much more appealing. Kudos for the low jazz & classical music in the background. Food: Amazing. Presentation was very complete and beautiful. Service: The servers aren't the friendliest.  Its one of those places where you're sized up at the door & treated according to how much they think you'll spend there. The quality of the food definitely makes up for the snootiness of the staff. But they are still a bit snooty. Thumbs down for: SnootinessMis-leading the innocent 2 for $25 ""Dine in Brooklyn"" goers into paying $60 for their meal. ($25 each in tiny letters at the bottom of menu)Thumbs up: The Chef knows what he is doing. The managers really seem to care about maintaining a professional and well put-together restaurant.  I gave ""Benchmark"" 4 stars because the food is top notch. Great place.

1.0,3/26/2011,"A poorly constructed, poorly executed menu here.  Careless service and overpriced faux-fine dining is what you can expect to find at Benchmark...with an attitude.We made reservations here to take advantage of ""Dine-In Brooklyn"" and were planning on doing the pre-fixe menu here.  We were sweet-talked by the lovely wording on the regular dinner menu and decided to splurge on the full price choices, mainly because we desperately wanted foie gras. Our foie gras appetizer showed up, and it looked like someone had prepared it in 2 or more of the following methods: microwave, boiled or deep fried.  It was over cooked, wrinkly, shrunken and dry.  Certainly disappointing, as we are huge fans of foie gras.   A duck confit salad with lardons and a poached egg sounded great on the menu, and was a huge disappointment on the plate.  Undercooked lardons, TONS of undressed frissee, a sloppily poached egg and next to no duck.   I ordered the burger medium and when it came, it was completely rare inside.  I asked the waitress to take it back and put it on the grill a bit more and she decided to argue with me instead, insisting that ""medium is pink throughout""   I am a chef and I have a pretty good idea of what a medium burger should look like. I was very close to asking to speak to the manager before she reluctantly picked up my dish and walked back to the kitchen.  I will say the house-cured bacon on the burger was the best bacon I have ever had in my life and if you are a bacon person, you must have it (order only that and get it to go) A friend ordered the pork chop which had a really great description on the menu but was horribly undercooked upon arrival and 50% of it was completely inedible to do being sincerely raw.  The 24 dollar plate consisted of not much more than the huge undercooked pork chop.  Service was inattentive and rude.  We were not asked once by the waitress about the food, even after something was sent back to be cooked further.  Not offered ketchup for a burger, pepper for a salad or refills on drinks.  A side order was incorrect when it arrived at the table because the waitress didnt seem to think it was important to write down a changed side for an entree.  They did not forget, however, to charge us $2 dollars extra for the switch.  Not something a fine restaurant does.  We skipped dessert after 2 already disappointing courses.  We were the last ones in the restaurant at about 11:30 and by last ones, we mean only people in the room.  The entire staff had gone back into the kitchen to get ready to close up, and we walked out without being thanked or even noticed.  Skip Benchmark if you're in Park Slope",3,0,0,Samantha M.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",5,17,0
1.0,3/20/2011,"Oh Benchmark, how ye disappointed, when it would be so easy to do better. Came here after not getting into Stone Park, like many others. Ordered the Bloody Benchmark, which is a bourbon inflected version of the bloody mary. Superb from the first sip! And it had beef jerky in it. I inspired my friend to order it. From the moment her drink was delivered, the first sign of doom. Her drink, garnished with a lime instead of celery and beef jerky, was not the same drink as the one I ordered. We told the waitstaff and they argued with us about it, and replaced the drink with another that tasted the same. The bartender screwed up, people, just make it right. Can't recommend the drink because I'm not sure if they can make it the same way or if they were being rude or what. Major fail. It took an hour and fifteen minute from the moment we sat down to when our burgers were delivered. Serious flaws in the delivery of orders to the table. All our burgers were overcooked, naturally--they sat too long. I can't imagine anyone's benedicts were cooked well either with the state of the service. I don't want to blame the waitstaff, and they seemed harried and used to the aggravations of not being able to deliver the food. Maybe they just went completely off the rails today (everyone else around us seemed equally befuddled), but I would never go back. Kitchen seems potentially talented (though they ruined the dry aged beef by overcooking it and not delivering to ordered ""medium"").

And that is what I thought as I stumbled down this little side street, down the Narnia-like, snow covered walkway, past the tables buried in the stuff to the cute carriage house restaurant with Nicole M.Nic had a hankering for steak and her magical powers of persuasion derailed me from my plans to both attend a UYE and go to Brooklyn Contra for some old skool dancing. Why I had these plans in the first place is beyond me, too.When we came in, we were told there were no available tables and were awkwardly seated at the bar in the middle of a strange photo shoot, where a girl was posing with her glass of wine and a guy with a giant camera took photos of her. Erm. Ok. Then after we had drinks we were told there was a table. Organization fail. The menu was taken over by restaurant week, so we ended up getting way more than just that steak. I had the braised beef shortribs and the filet mignon, and both were lackluster at best. In theory, both dishes were cooked just fine but they had no flavour to them. Like a Shakespearean play read by high schoolers -- the words are all there, but the essence and the poetry is lost.They also messed up my dessert order so there was about 20 minutes while N had her delicious looking dessert while we waited for mine. I ended up getting the cookie dough eggroll (with miso caramel) purely for the weirdness factor, but it was surprisingly good and probably my favorite part of the meal, tying with the Tempranillo I was drinking. Overall, perhaps worth another try not during restaurant week.

The mac and cheese was under seasoned. Overall, the food was very good, and the atmosphere was pleasant and relaxing. Service was attentive and friendly.

We were actually quite hesitant to ask at first as the fact that there were no salt and pepper on the table meant that whatever is served is supposed to be well seasoned.  But we wanted to enjoy our steak so we asked the waitress who at this point became surlier and kicked the door of the kitchen to obtain the seasonings for us.  Fortunately,  I was the only one who witnessed this.  I did not want to bring about any discomfort to my guests so I kept silent about this.  At this point, I was wondering whether she hated being asked for requests (hey, you're in the service industry!) or if she took it personally that we found the steaks a little taste challenged.I would have scurried out and skipped dessert but I wanted to be the gracious host so we ordered coffee and asked for the grapefruit - honey cheesecake only to be told a few minutes later by who seemed like the  manager that it was not available.  I asked him what he would recommend and he said that without a doubt it was the strawberry shortcake.  Yeah, right --- it came like a messy flop!  How would I describe such a disastrous dessert - dried out chiffon cake covered with whipped cream and topped with a glop of dulce de leche ice cream and surrounded with slivers of strawberry that apparently were sliced with a knife that was just used on onions.  It was so birzzarely disproportionate to the presentation of the other dishes that I really think it was the chef's way of seeking vengeance for our having had the gall to ask for salt and worcestershire.  I wish I read the yelp reviews before deciding to come to this unwelcoming place.  On the other hand, this experience has made me sign up for yelp so that my voice could be heard!",3,0,0,Nanette G.,"Manhattan, NY",59,7,0
5.0,10/26/2010,"Any time I make the trip to New York, I will be sure and include a trip to Benchmark located in Brooklyn! The food and atmosphere are incredible. The waitress was polite, personable and attentive. Because Benchmark can fill up fast, especially on the weekends, I would be sure and make a reservation (this is Park Slope we're talking about). So, let's get down to the food. Even though there were only three of us, we managed to try every course on the meal. Prepare yourselves! We started with the organic seasonal lettuces-fresh lettuces, bright, powerful flavors; spicy lobster salad and seared sea scallops. To die for! Then we had the yogurt fried label rouge half chicken, grass-fed filet mignon and the American Kobe culotte steak. While everything was delicious, I loved the American Kobe culotte steak the best. So juicy and flavorful! For sides we ordered the goat cheese whipped potatoes (so airy, fluffy and creamy!), the truffled mascarpone mac and cheese (I could have eaten the entire plate myself) and the hand cut fries...I'm salivating just thinking about the meal! Every bite was just as new and fresh as the previous. The flavors exploded in my mouth! Interestingly enough, the last statement applies to everything I ate... Dessert could quite possibly have been my favorite. We ordered the cookie dough EGG ROLL. Yea, you read that correctly. We also had the chocolate 3 which is three types of chocolate custards plus malted and chocolate cakes...sinfully good. I can't remember which wines we ordered, but we tried several different bottles, all of which were great.

The hand cut fries were wonderful and made us look forward to trying lunch or dinner here.The Eh: The coffee...for how great the food was it was sad to be paired with watered down drip.The Bad: Service. Our server only came by twice and when she took our order she responded with so much judgment and anger in her tone that we almost thought we were trying to order something not even on the menu....In the end - we would like to go back - but very much hope to get a different server.

2.0,10/19/2010,"had been really excited about eating here but was seriously disappointed. Like other reviewers, we had a hard time with service, starting with getting the hostess to seat us. First she told us there was a wait (although there were 5 or 6 empty tables within my eye sight) then she actually interrupted herself from slowly seating us, leaving us to stand around aimlessly some more, to go in search of a cocktail menu. Couldn't hear her explanation but she even sent a couple of other parties getting there couple of minutes after us (they weren't closing yet so that's not it). It was late and the food did come slowly but  if the issue was just that the kitchen was backed up, why not tell us this while seating us & taking any drink orders??The food was really disappointing, aside from the delicious coffee & pretty damn good mimosa.They were out of the the biscuits & gravy I wanted so I ended up with an omelette which was mediocre at best - before i realized it was undercooked & runny in the middle. Left my toast uneaten as well since it was dry (I tried to get butter or something for it but decided the focus for getting some help from the waitstaff should be about the runniness of the eggs.)I will give them credit for immediately saying my food would be no charge & offering me something else when I showed waitress my omelette (sadly not everyone does this) but by that point it was nearly time to go so i passed on trying something else. I do absolutely love the look & feel of the space, the outdoor courtyard was really great to sit in on a sunny fall day but I need more than a good location unless I'm just there for drinks...  I'll also say that my waitress was lovely, though not incredibly attentive, whereas the hostess may have actually been asleep or thinking she was elsewehere...",2,0,1,Bec F.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,10,0
1.0,10/18/2010,"Overrated, overrated, and overrated.  I only went to this place because I had read reviews of good food and potential for greatness, but how wrong that was.  The food is merely mediocre at best - the sliver of foie gras served for an appetizer was overdone to the point of being burned on the edges, and the rest of the dish was plate filler, nothing of substance.  For a main course the 24 oz rib steak on the bone first came out underdone, looking like  a slab of meat with no browning on the outside, and totally red all through, not seared at all.  I sent it back and it came out medium, which I tried, but found the meat to be tough since there was no marbling whatsoever and no fat to make it tender.  I sent it and the totally undercooked, not golden in anyway but tasting of vinegar, fries both back and said I didn't want them.  This was besides having to wait 10 minutes for a glass of wine and then having to flag down a waitress for a 2nd glass and to get attention to the unsatisfactory food.  What a waste of my time and money when I could have eaten at Stone Park Cafe around the corner, and knowing that made me even more annoyed.  Young people who don't know what they're doing seem to be running the place.  And they're probably the inexperienced diners giving the good reviews here.  I saw extremely slow service in a nearly empty restaurant.  And the place smelled of cleaning fluid when I first walked in, followed by a musty odor they were most likely trying to cover up.  The space is interesting, though, formerly an old ice house behing the homes.  PS Tell the chef there are other spices besides sea salt; it's on the bread, the steak, and I think the foie gras too!",1,1,1,Linda W.,"Staten Island, NY",1,10,5
1.0,10/10/2010,"I'm going to be honest, I didn't eat here. I have tried to twice; the first time the restaurant was closed, the second time was today. We walked in at around 2:15 and TRIED to find someone to seat us.  One waitress maybe looked up, but didn't say anything. In short, no awareness as to people walking into the restaurant. Come on people, pay attention!Once we literally flagged someone down, we asked for a table for three and the girl told us there were no tables available, that we should have made a reservation in advance. Uhhh what?  The place was not crowded and there were at least 5 tables with empty dishes waiting to be cleared. I subsequently went down the street to Stone Park Cafe and got a table in 15 minutes. Sorry Benchmark, you lost over $70 in business today. Seriously folks, go to Stone Park Cafe.

1.0,10/10/2010,"I wish you could give one rating for the food, and another for the service.  Because the food was good - the steak was beautiful and simple, most of the sides great (don't bother with the wild mushroom spaetzle and arugula - not as good as it sounds), ambience nice, and so on.  But the SERVICE - from the waitress to the management, it was the worst service in my 11 years in Brooklyn.  Owner of Benchmark, please read on, because you may want to seriously consider sending the night manager on Oct 9, 2010, to Management 101 class.  This is how it went down.  We ordered a bottle of wine, but had pre-dinner drinks so the waitress said she would bring the wine (red of course) before the steaks.  Fine.  Before the steaks arrived, the waitress was nowhere to be found and I asked another one about the wine.  She said she would.  Nothing happened.  Then, the manager dude brings the steaks and says:Manager: ""Ok, who ordered the bordelaise?"" Me: ""No one did.  I ordered the au poivre.""Manager: ""This is probably it."" [it wasn't]Then I asked about the wine again, and seriously we were pretty far into our steaks when the manager shows up with the wine and in the most awkward, unapologetic silence opens and pours it.  It was so uncomfortable.  And normally I wouldn't have done this, but my mom was with me and this was supposed to be my birthday dinner for THE LOVE, so I calmly approached him at the bar area and requested an apology.  Long story short, I did not get one.  He was ""sorry [I] felt that way"" about the service, but he stated he would not apologize. It was worse than a fight with a stubborn ex-boyfriend.  I mean, huh?  Wow.",2,2,0,Kim K.,"Brooklyn, NY",43,21,0
3.0,10/9/2010,"I chose to try this restaurant mostly because of the menu and price range.  The outdoor seating is very nice, almost like a hidden gem. ALMOST.  The food and service was mediocre.  We asked our waitress for milk with our coffee 2x, she never brought it to us, so we had to ask the hostess.  Our food took a bit longer than expected, and since we were parked at a meter on a Saturday afternoon, didn't want to risk it.  So we asked another waitress how much longer.  She brought the food out right away.  Boyfriend ordered the steak&eggs, they gave him chunks of steak cut up, I was expecting a whole steak.  Also his toast didn't come with any butter or jam.  The short ribs with eggs benedict was definitely good though, and this is part of the $14 brunch prix fix menu.

4.0,10/4/2010,"Really lovely spot, especially for a gorgeous fall morning (alright...afternoon. We were there for brunch).Totally worth the ""trek"" from Manhattan. Got off at Bergen and strolled down 5th Avenue to Benchmark. Very nice location. We ate outside and the courtyard is quite nice (can see what people meant by the triangle shade things, although because it was alternating between cloudy and sunny we weren't bothered by excess sun).We did the $14 brunch prix fixe with two of the organic mixed green salads (really nice with grilled strawberries, goat cheese, and a baked slice of yucca wrapped around nicely-dressed greens). I had the bourbon-smoked salmon bagel while my husband had the burger. We were both really pleased with our dishes (note: the special ketchup made on premise is fine, but nothing special, although the fries were incredible. and, my salmon was a LITTLE too salty, but that being said, also super generous, so I just left a little and didn't eat up all the capers like usual).Nice selection of teas and desserts looked good, although we didn't try any.I will say that I get what previous reviewers meant about the service. A little slow and they tended to forget about us, but luckily since we weren't starving and since there wasn't anything wrong with our meal, it didn't bother us as much as it might have...Would definitely return!",3,1,1,Vespa R.,"Stockholm, Sweden",12,113,12
3.0,9/20/2010,"Went here for bunch with four others. Were able to get a brunch time seat no problem. Only 2 or 3 tables really for groups, rest are all two seaters. The patio area is really nice, but on a sunny day it could get very warm if you aren't in a shaded spot. The canopies overhead are more for decor than usefulness. I'd agree with a previous review about the waitstaff. They seem very nice, but they aren't very attentive. Took us awhile just to be greeted at the entrance. Our waitress had to check to see if they had skim milk or half-and-half for our coffee drinkers (they didn't, only milk). Food was pretty good. A few of us thought some dishes could use a bit more salt or seasoning, but wasn't bad. I got the croissant sandwich. Nice big croissant and a nice big piece of sausage on it.Lastly, one of the few Prix-Fixe brunch menus that didn't have a cocktail/drink included.",0,0,0,Jason K.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,38,12

She'd requested steak, so I researched some places in the nabe, and decided upon Benchmark.To mention, it was raining...so the front courtyard area was basically off limits. In fact, we weren't even sure they were open, until we sauntered past the garden seating into the actual restaurant. Off the bat, the place was unpretentious and quaint. Not a huge room, which we liked.The food was top notch! My parents both ordered the Kobe Culottes, and raved about it. My boyfriend ordered the Pork Chop, which was giant and dinosaur like. I ordered the yogurt-friend chicken which came with a delicious side of Truffle Mac & Cheese. We then topped the evening off with some dessert: Strawberry Shortcake and some chocolate ensemble. Delish!!!! The service wasn't bad also, but I could understand based on others reviews how things could fall off a bit if they were busy. It seemed as if the joint needs a little bit more gel when it comes to the staff.4 stars instead of five because: 1. it was pretty dang stuffy in the place. The gentleman behind me actually had to ask the wait-staff to turn on the AC as his ""children were perspiring"". 2. When we received our artisanal cheese platter from the busser, no one informed us what we were eating. We then had to ask our server 3/4 of the way through eating the selection, what in fact we were putting in our mouths.

2.0,8/8/2010,"I've heard some really good things about this place, so we finally decided to drop some money on a date night there. When we arrived, it was difficult to tell if we should stand by the street entrance or walk through the courtyard into the restaurant. A hostess eventually walked over to us, but a lot of other guests had no idea where to go upon arrival. I think the proper thing to do is walk through the courtyard. The setting is gorgeous, possibly one of the nicest outdoor eating spaces in Brooklyn. Lots of room in between the tables, so we ordered a couple steaks and some wine, and settled in for a nice meal. After 20 minutes of asking the bread came. After another 15 the steaks came out. We both ordered them medium-rare. The ribeye was cooked right and tasted good but the strip was literally cold on the inside. I had to send it back, twice. After the second return it was finally cooked enough. Asked for the wine for the third time by now, and when it finally arrived it was literally the most meager pour I've ever seen at a restaurant. Sides of brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes were good, if unimpressive. I asked for salt and pepper several times and never got it.The waitresses were frazzled, hard to find, and clearly in over their heads with all the send-backs, and the busboys/ runners were running around like chickens with their heads cut off, and never cleared any plates or the empty bread basket. Stuff was still piled up on the table when we left.The couple at the table next to us was having difficulties, as well. They never got their sides, and were discussing how the quality of the meat and service wasn't up to steakhouse-level. I agree with that. I'm not dropping $45 on the strip, but $30 is still a lot for an entree, and I was hoping that it would be cooked properly and at least have some dry-aged flavor. When I want to drop a lot of money on a restaurant in the Slope, I go to Al Di La or Rose Water, and that won't change. I really wanted to like this place- I was hoping for a standby neighborhood steakhouse, but this place was just so unimpressive on so many levels for the price.  I won't be going back, unfortunately.",3,0,0,Dan M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,25,0

For my meal I had the sea bass & my husband had the ribeye steak. I loved my bass, served with black lentils & artichoke. I also ordered a side a goat cheese mashed potatoes. They were perfect.

5.0,7/18/2010,"If you want to cast a spell and make someone yours (or just REALLY impress an obnoxiously hard-to-please friend), invite them to join you for dinner at Benchmark on a sultry summer night.Eager to check this place out from first sight (it has an eye-catching setup for Park Slope, with inviting candle-lit tables spread across an alley on a quiet brownstone sidestreet), I finally had the pleasure last night.Skeptical because we read mixed yelp reviews before heading over, our main concern was that it would be all ambience, and not much else.  However, prejudice began to melt right about the same time as their homemade roasted garlic butter spread without apology over warm oven toasted bread.  While seated outdoors on the romantic foilage-filled patio, we took in the sounds of a trickling water fountain behind us, and the beckoning waves of sail masts that hung overhead to provide shade for midmorning mimosas.  I imagine it would be difficult to not fall in love with your dining companions in this environment.  Lucky for me, I was already in love with mine.We began with two soul-stirring glasses of Melbac, and the appetizer special: zucchini flowers lightly battered with tempura flakes (tempura always running the risk of being too oily, was perfectly prepared as light and delicate here)...each of two generous flowers were carefully filled with crabmeat and a spot of artisan cheese and laid over a tasty swirl of avocado sauce, then joined on the plate by edamame, crisp bacon bits, and chipotle reduction.  it was riDICulously divine.dinner was a fresh angus burger with handcut fries and homemade ketchup...incredibly delicious, but the only weak spot of our experience at Benchmark was having the burger arrive rare despite requesting medium.  this was painlessly resolved by our prompt and friendly waiter, who ran it back to the kitchen and returned it near perfect just 3 minutes later.  despite then being almost well-done, the burger retained its juiciness and explosive smoky flavor, perfectly punctuated by the tangy home made ketchup and crispy sea salt fries.our other entree was an appetizer selection paired with a a side dish: pan seared sea scallops and oven roasted brussels sprouts with crispy bacon.  can you say HEAVEN?!seriously, we were the last table seated and running on slim time to catch a movie.  Never before have I been seated last in a restaurant without being made to feel like an unwanted intruder by overtired waitstaff.  But at Benchmark we were greeted warmly, served promptly, the table was cleared to spotless perfection between each course, and we didn't see the bottom of our wine glasses until dinner's end.Benchmark is a BIG win not only for Park Slope, but for the borough of Brooklyn.  so pleased that it's not just another pretty face :)",6,2,4,Leslie W.,"New York, NY",67,44,13
5.0,6/17/2010,"My girlfriend and I just moved to Park Slope.  This is the dining experience we've been hoping to find.  We ate there last night.  I've never written a review before.  So... Benchmark prompted my joining Yelp.   I've had 5 truly remarkable burgers in the past 5 or so years and and Benchmark just landed itself squarely at the top of that list.  I had mine medium rare with cheddar, my girlfriend had hers medium with blue.  We both loved them.  The flavor, texture, and tenderness of the meat was incredible.  (The size was also right on - I'm guessing it was a 1/2 pound, maybe slightly larger.)  Perfectly matched with a slightly sweet sesame seed bun.  Equally impressive were the hand-cut fries that came with - piping hot and perfectly salted.  Unlike many places I've tried lately, they not over-salted - the potatoes were able to speak for themselves - and they were light in texture and didn't feel heavy on the stomach either.  They  even remained delicious when attention was turned fully to the burger and I was not able to return to the fries until about 15 minutes later.  Having been to so many restaurants that put out a great burger but missed on the fries (or vice versa), I'm pleased as can be to find a place that finally got both perfectly right.It was served with aioli and smoked chipotle ketchup.  Both homemade.  These were the master touches.  I love the flavor of mayo on my burger but don't like how weighty it can be - the aioli was the perfect solution - light and zesty.  The ketchup was fantastic.  In their own bottle, hand-stamped label and all.I think the only criticism I have for the burger experience is that the red onion was cut too thick to my liking.  This is so minor, it hardly bears mentioning, but maybe Benchmark will read this....  We also ordered a side - brussel sprouts and housecut bacon.  Again, fantastic, roasted flavor.  We found that the side, while delicious, was unnecessary.  The amount of food that came with the burger was plenty and we ended up taking the sprouts home.  The meal was rounded out with Ommegang Rare VOS.  Just seeing Ommegang on the list was enough to get me excited.  Their Belgian White (Witte) is one of my favorite beers out there right now.  I had never tried the Rare VOS before.  Their amber ale, it is equally delicious, slightly sweet and creamy, and paired wonderfully with the smokiness of burger.  The surroundings - this is what got my attention the first time I walked by.  Benchmark has a gorgeous, deep patio that looks like it was taken from a Tuscan villa.  The tables are spread out and the vibe is laid-back.  There's a garden just outside the front door to the restaurant.  It's a wonderful outdoor space.The staff were super attentive and friendly, never intrusive, happy to answer all our questions (and beam while we heaped praise upon the kitchen), and made us feel right at home.  Couldn't ask for more from the whole experience.  I have a feeling this will become a fairly regular treat for my girlfriend and I.",0,0,0,Jonathan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0

1.0,6/12/2010,"I've walked by this restaurant several times and finally decided to stop for brunch this morning since it was fairly empty; only 2 other tables, although 5 more parties were seated while I was there.  Not one of my wisest decisions.  The courtyard is quite charming, however that was the only positive thing I can say about my dining experience. Neither the food nor the service merits a return. After promptly receiving the menu and water I waited quite a while for the waiter (who was apparently overwhelmed with the one other table he was serving at that point). I ordered a bloody mary and crab cakes benedict. The drink came fairly quickly, the food was a bit slow to appear, but not unreasonably so. Neither was brought by the waiter. He did stop by about 10 minutes in to ask if everything was ok; since the food was not his responsibility, I said it was fine. That was the last time he acknowledged my presence.  Again, probably overwhelmed since he now had a total of 4 tables to take care of, although he did manage to go often to the other tables to check on them, bring drinks, coffee, etc. On to the food and drink. The bloody mary ($9) tasted like they had poured salsa over ice, and it had the same consistency.  Peculiar, but not horrible. Not that I would want to drink it again.  The crab cake benedict ($13) was... unfortunate. The egg was poached beautifully and the hollandaise sauce was actually subtle and quite lovely; however the whole dish tasted only of red bell pepper. The crab cakes were composed almost entirely of breadcrumbs and diced bell pepper with a miniscule amount of crab. The side of potatoes was soggy, unpleasant and room temperature. No attempt had been made to reheat them, and they were clearly prepared in well in advance of serving. The onions had been cooked so long ago that they were actually sticky to the touch. I thought I could at least order some coffee. Well, the best laid plans... After putting down my fork and napkin I waited.  And waited.  And waited.  After about 45 minutes of waiting for the plates to be cleared or the waiter to come to the table, and during which time the waiter walked by my table repeatedly to serve the 3 other tables ignoring my attempts to get his attention, I gave up. I calculated the bill and the tax ($23.81), left $24 on the table (only because I did not have sufficient change to leave 81 cents), and walked inside to tell the hostess that since the waiter could not be bothered, I had left what I believed I owed on the table.

2.0,5/23/2010,"Happened upon this place for brunch this morning.  Party of 4 adults, one toddler.  The courtyard was beautiful but unfortunately, we didn't have reservations and were told we could only sit inside.  We were hungry, so we agreed.  We were seated and our drink orders taken almost immediately.  After mulling over the menu for a while, the waiter/manager came to take our order.  We ordered and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  After about 30 mins, the waiter came and apologized for the wait, telling us our food would be out shortly.  At this point, no one had offered to refill our coffees, but we managed to flag down a bus boy.Our food arrived and immediately it was noticed that the toddler's pancakes were raw in the center.  We summoned the waiter, he apologized, and sent them back.  The rest of us began to eat slowly waiting for the pancakes.  After about 10 mins, they arrived, burnt on the outsdied, slightly less raw in the center, but still not cooked fully.  We summoned the waiter again and let him know.  He apologized again and sent them back to the kitchen.  At this point, we assumed that the next item made in the kitchen would be another plate of pancakes.  The waiter assured us they'd be removed from our check.  We waited another 10 mins or so, and finally they were cooked to satisfaction.At no point during all of this were we asked how our food was or if he could get us anything else.  Thankfully the toddler was in good spirits and not too upset about waiting for his food.  I can't say the same for the rest of us.  The food (minus the pancakes) was pretty good, but nothing so original that it's worth surviving the service or the kitchen issues.  Seems like it's pretty new so hopefully they'll figure it out.",2,0,0,sarah K.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,95,1
3.0,5/17/2010,"Another new restaurant that opened in the Slope, Benchmark has the potential to be great but for now, its just alright. The atmosphere was lovely - we sat outside for brunch in a shaded area and just took in the scenery on one of the nicer Sunday afternoons of the year. Perfection. Our waiter was equally wonderful - attentive but not overbearing, and definitely attuned to attitudes of the table as a whole. Honestly, he was probably the best part of the whole experience. Well, that and the cocktails, all of which were inventive and delicious (definitely try the Bloody Mary). Unfortunately, excellence stopped with the drinks. The food took just a little bit too long to come out and, when it finally made an appearance, we were missing components of meals. One meal -- the garbage salad -- also had to be returned due to a kitchen error (they put shrimp in the salad when it wasn't listed on the menu and the person who ordered it has a shellfish intolerance). It's important here to note that the waiter was very apologetic and attentive, getting another salad out right away. Unfortunately, that salad was also incorrect ingredients wise and frankly, the size of it was underwhelming for the price ($13). The food, once it all arrived in the proper and complete manner, was delicious (save the salad). Particularly good was boyfriend's steak from his steak and eggs.Hopefully Benchmark can get past their growing pains phase and the kitchen becomes better attuned to the menu and amount of time it takes to get an order from ticket to table. If it can do that, the restaurant will be very successful, having already created a decent menu and hired an experienced and charismatic FOH staff. Benchmark, I'm going to give you a month or so, but I'll definitely be back to give you another shot.",0,1,0,Lindsay D.,"Roslindale, Boston, MA",159,395,5
3.0,5/14/2010,"The location and the food are so good that it's worth the visit, but the atmosphere is so lacking that it doesn't quite seal the deal. Set back from the street with the gorgeous garden out front and all the original brickwork, the building that hosts Benchmark has so much going for it, but all the little details inside strike a false note-- lighting too bright, music too loud and unoriginal, paper covering the tablecloths, and way too loud. Luckily the food is delicious-- my boyfriend's steak was better than my lamb, but both came with delicious sauces and sides (the goat cheese mashed potatoes!) that more than made up for it. Some things were better than others-- the scallops appetizer great, the house-made cocktails not so much-- but the meat is the main attraction, and it really succeeds.I'm rooting for Benchmark, if only for it to make good use of the much-missed back patio of Loki. Hopefully they can fix some of these atmosphere issues to match the quality of the food inside.",0,0,0,Katey R.,"New York, NY",0,5,1
5.0,5/9/2010,"Loved it!We went here tonight for a family Mother's Day dinner, and out of 4 appetizers, 4 mains, 2 sides and 3 desserts, there was not a bad one in the bunch.  The short rib Trio was fantastic, and a real bargain at $13; very generous portion.  Everything, for that matter, was generously portioned.  The steak was great and even had that great steakhouse salt crust if not quite as charred as say, Luger's.  We had Spicy Lobster salad appetizer which was a big hit; I will say the tuna steak, while a great piece of fish, didn't excite me (not my main dish). I shared a 26-oz Porterhouse (a special tonight) which was delicious, creamed spinach (very good), and handcut fries (ditto).  Star of our desserts (in my opinion) was the grapefruit-honey-ginger cheesecake which sounded like it could have been awful but was a perfect blend of flavors, and very light.  The chocolate x 3 was good but to me not great, a little muddled.  Wine list by the glass was nicely chosen and cocktails we began with were also tasty.   I did read about less-than-great service here on Yelp but ours was just fine; busy night at the restaurant too.  They must have been hurting not being able to open outside on a holiday night but the staff had it all under control, or did on our part anyway.  That is some seriously large outdoor space so I will wait to see if that helps or hinders service in the future....but all in all one of the best meals I have ever had in Park Slopeif not the best.",2,0,1,Lisa R.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,81,0
2.0,5/3/2010,"The setting is lovely, but that's about it.  Was part of a table for 4, ordered scallops and chilled artichokes to start and the scallops were great, the artichokes barely passable.  We had tuna steaks and burgers, they were fine, not great, not bad.  Though the food was unimpressive, the real problem was how long everything took.  The entire experience was probably about 2.5 hours long, with the majority of that wait time before any food hit our table.  It was 9, and the place wasn't packed.  When we ordered, after getting up to ask for menus, then wine, then to order, the waitress informed us that well done tuna steaks will take longer, because they are well done.  Now, I laugh at this dining partner everytime she orders well done tuna, but I also know that the difference in time between rare and well done isn't substantial enough to mention when ordering.  We are usually a very gracious table, but this was too much, and the waitress wasn't attentive at all, we were literally ordering wine from busboys (who did keep our water glass topped off), and going in to the wait station to check on our food.  The GM did offer us a free dessert, but we were so tired of being there, we opted for tequila shots ($14 a pop for Don Julio?  Really?)  which they graciously provided.  I may go back for brunch because the garden was lovely, but it will be a while, they have a lot of kinks to work out.",2,0,1,Jessica N.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,22,0

1.0,4/30/2010,"I'm not quite sure where to begin my remarks. I take food, as I do life, very seriously - a trait quite familiar to those accustomed to my culinary proclivities. I also take little pleasure in scathing a restaurant, particularly a newcomer in a truly appealing setting. ""Benchmark,"" however, failed in too many ways to escape this fate. An hour ago, I left the majority of a Kobe beef steak on my plate, and declined *both* an offer for a complimentary extra glass of wine or a dessert on the house, in favor of finding protein elsewhere... after my stomach finally settles.A friend and I recently strolled past ""Benchmark"" and made a pact to try this recent addition to the neighborhood for dinner, in part because it is off the beaten path in a genuinely beautiful building, and in part because the menu looked promising. We chose tonight to introduce ourselves to the establishment, and unfortunately both regretted the experience. The most obvious problem - and the reason that both our waitress and the host offered us complimentary items - was service. A dining process involving only appetizers and steaks required nearly two hours, and involved nothing whatsoever to tie us over during the wait. Oddly, there seemed no lack of wait staff and bus boys, considering that the restaurant is not exceptionally large for Park Slope, so I concluded (in a very forgiving moment) that the kitchen must have simply been short staffed.That said, I will happily wait hours on end for excellent food. I can cut any restaurant some slack for a single service issue. ""Benchmark"" fails because virtually everything these two diners experienced was over-promised and under-delivered.  I am not lamenting a single shortcoming, so much as documenting a global failure in execution. The menu - upscale and ambitious, in both price and content - could almost have served as an exposition of the kitchen's culinary shortcomings. It appears exciting from the front, but upon closer examination, each selection devolves into a complication of loud ingredients or a demonstration of miscellaneous gastronomic froufrou. Dishes don't anchor themselves on a stable platform and then leap into bold directions -- they bounce haphazardly, as if selected to please patrons who would rather appear sophisticated than revel in understated confidence.It was a bad time for me to be bold and order the veal sweetbreads as an appetizer. I expected ""rich,"" but instead received ""new money."" Somehow, the caramelization clashed with the natural flavors of the meat, as if sugar had been added to the cooking process indiscriminately. The plate was topped with a sauerkraut that I initially applauded for its use of tarragon-infused vinegar. Sadly, I quickly discovered the complexity screamed out against the veal.Considering the number of steaks listed on the menu, and the relative ease of cooking one, I simply can't forgive having been presented a portion of Kobe so rare that it was barely warm on the outside, purple and *very* cold on the inside. I ordered it ""medium"", had already waited over an hour, and was starving, so I tried to eat it anyway.  It's worth noting that I'm not particularly fussy about my ""medium"" - anything close is fine with me - but what I received wasn't even an honest attempt. To me, this suggests the kitchen was either incapable of preparing a steak, or so arrogant that they believed the customer was wrong.Not that I should have harbored concerns about Mad Cow disease; any incidence of these undesirable prions would have been thoroughly eradicated by the kitchen's hysterical application of salt - in the sauce AND on top of the steak.The goat cheese mashed potatoes were nearly spared this fate, but by the time I worked my way through half the portion, their increasingly brackish rasp was beginning to make me contemplate my blood pressure - and more water, which wasn't coming fast enough. Between the loud, clashing flavors and the salt, I'm left wondering if this might be an opportune time for the chef to quit smoking. On a side note, this restaurant is also now benchmarked as the only eating establishment in my 35 year life where I (gasp) returned a glass of red wine (I'm Sicilian, people!), after finding a $10 portion of Bordeaux so acidic and cloyingly sweet that it could have been poured from a box. I switched to a vastly superior Malbec, which ultimately provided the lone example of subtlety and balance in my entire dining experience this evening.Judging from the number of other patrons at ""Benchmark"" tonight, I sense that this restaurant may become the latest to enjoy success because of posturing socialites, rather than culinary skill. The host, knowing we had faced an unreasonable wait, ultimately did not charge for our appetizers. This action alone spares Benchmark from earning my dreaded ""poo-poo"" rating - but just barely. Ouch.",5,2,1,Joe M.,"Brooklyn, NY",48,45,7
4.0,4/30/2010,"I was looking for a restaurant to replace my beloved Tempo which closed last June.  Not sure if I've found it here, but I took my mother for her birthday and we enjoyed it very much.   It's tucked away on 2nd street, away from traffic and other street noise.  Small bar up front, where the host warmly greeted us and took us to a table in the back, which was my mother's preference, away from the table for two available at the front near the bar.  Small, not good for kids inside restaurant proper, but outside perhaps room for carriages, strollers ect.It's a steak house and we had the fish, but I will return to try the more ambitious items on the menu.  Soft shell crab, white sea bass with morels, salmon in chive cream, wine, port, bread pudding and one of the creamiest creme brulees (with a hint of curry) I've enjoyed to date.  Wait staff and host were attentive, but not obstructive and everyone looked to be enjoying the food.  Overall, I would recommend and would return.  If I had one complaint it would be the amount of the pour on a glass of wine.  On average for the price (which if it is over $9 a glass is, in my opinion, pricey for a malbec)  I enjoy ""3 fingers"" in my glass and the pour seemed more of a ""shot"" of wine than an actual serving.  I also like to have my wine served in a glass with a stem, not a tumbler or tom collins glass, but that's just my preference because I'm less likely to knock over a taller glass than a short one.  Clumsy?  Perhaps, but satisfied and looking foward to my next visit.",0,0,0,Jenny M.,"Brooklyn, NY",39,224,90
1.0,4/28/2010,"Can the previous reviewers really be serious?  Are they paid by the restaurant to write these reviews?  Was I actually at the same restaurant?!The setting, to be fair, is beautiful.  The garden will be a terrific draw in the summer, especially for the kiddies (they even have a fenced garden for the rugrats to run wild).  But that's where the good stuff ends.  Service was patchy (waiter completely forgot to take drinks order for one of our party, he didn't know the wine menu, his timing was all over the place), the menu read like some kind of Top Chef elimination round (what the hell is ""banana guacamole"" and why were there at least 2 dishes that served ramps?);  but what completely flummoxed us was how badly executed the food was.  We'd read such great reviews! (ok so they were mainly on this site, which is why I felt compelled to fill people in on the reality).I ordered quinoa in some kind of squash thingy which was overspiced and completely cold.  My friend ordered a burger that was raw (she didn't complain but she also didn't eat it), my husband ordered NY strip that was so undercooked he sent it back.  The only person who was happy was my friend's husband who basically asked for his meat raw.  All that, and the bill came to nearly $300. For four people. For two courses and a couple of glasses of wine each.A good quality steak restaurant that doesn't try too hard would be a welcome addition to 5th Avenue.  Why do chefs and restaurant managers have to go and screw with something that could be so easy to do?  Just be a good steak restaurant.  That's all we ask.",5,2,0,Fab E.,"Brooklyn, NY",83,43,0

I especially appreciate the efforts to serve pasture-raised meat at a steakhouse. My issue was with the atmosphere. I was hoping to sit down for a relaxing, romantic meal with my boyfriend. However, something about the space wasn't conducive to this - not sure exactly what it was - combination of large, formal chairs, too-large table so we were sitting far from each other, the room was open and quiet so we couldn't create a veil of privacy to get cozy and chatty.

5.0,4/12/2010,"Park Slope has some great restaurants, but what we've definitely been missing is a true steakhouse, and Benchmark fits the bill nicely.  The menu is extensive--you can order composed entrees, or steaks a la carte.  My giant 11oz filet mignon was cooked to medium rare perfection. You can also choose from a variety of sauces, though I ordered mine plain and it was still very flavorful.  Sides are served a la carte as well, and just thinking about the goat cheese mashed potatoes is making my mouth water.  The seared scallops we ordered as an appetizer were awesome, as was the chocolate trifle we had for dessert.  The staff is friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere manages to be chic, without coming off as haughty and ridiculous. The bad news?  The prices are a little steep, but I don't mind paying for quality eats.  The worse news?  The restaurant's cute outdoor patio takes the place of Loki's outdoor patio.  That said, it would definitely be nice to woof down a nice steak on that patio when the weather gets a little warmer.So, seriously.  Go there.  Now.  Run, don't walk.",3,2,3,Amanda S.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,115,0
5.0,3/15/2010,"I can't recommend this place enough. It's my new favorite restaurant. I will be back next week.Benchmark has been open for about a month now, but it's clearly going to take some time to build word of mouth thanks to its just-off-5th-ave, through-an-alley-on-2nd-st location. When we went last night we were the only people there for most of the meal. But what a meal! I had the Black Trumpet Rubbed Tuna, and it was truly the best meal I've had in a long time. My girlfriend had Filet Mignon and loved it as well.Prices are typical of the nice restaurants in the neighborhood: in the mid 20s for an entree. $7-12 for a glass of wine. Extra-fancy steaks are available a la carte for under $30.The decor is nice. It's a quaint, exposed brick, converted carriage house.
