The atmosphere was very comfy and warming.We ordered the oysters, bacon and salad for appetizers and they were delicious.The oysters were very fresh.They cut up the bacon for us to share.We had 4 people and ordered a porter house for 3 and portion was perfect.The porterhouse was cooked perfectly. It was very tender and juicy.We got cream spinach and asparagus on the side and they were very tasty.For dessert, I had the brownie sundae and it was the perfect end to the dinner.The waiters were friendly and they did not rush us to leave.Great place to go to and will definitely be back.",0,0,0,Kitty Y.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",85,61,121
5.0,3/8/2019,"Arguably the best steakhouse in NYC. Mike is an amazing bartender. Very personable and makes a hell of a drink. Start with a slice of heaven,  I mean bacon for an app. Then get the baked clams they are a perfect choice. I've never had a steak that wasn't cooked to perfection here.  I've been here several times and have never had a bad experience.  Last night I was with a large group for a 50th birthday party. Our waiter Hugh was on point. Taking care of that many people is not easy and he handled it with ease. I'm glad I found this place years ago.  I'l keep coming back for years to come.",0,0,0,Kevin G.,"Nanuet, NY",5,18,0

5.0,2/24/2019,"OMG!  What else can be said.   Yes it's expensive, yes it's a bit stuff to deal with the staff, but what you may miss in the price and first impressions you will more than make up for in they truly simple but delicious food they serve. First off the Guinness is soo smooth.  I have never had another one that tasted this good without being in Ireland.  The staff has a special place and they know it.  They kind of came across as highbrow, but hey it is a great small NY steakhouse.  Let's start off with the appetizers,  I ordered there Caprice salads and Thick sliced bacon.  I was blown away... seriously it's wintertime and you do lot expect to have something this fresh tasking.  I pride myself in finding places off the beaten path to try new and fun foods. The bacon is crazy good, a little char, great rendered fat, and the taste..  crazy mix!!! The main course was a cowboy ribeye.  This was cooked at an internal temp of 126f finished with a great sear. Excellent Dinning! Thanks for reading my traveling rambles -Sepi",0,0,0,Cris E.,"Ankeny, IA",19,58,12

4.0,12/24/2018,"Great food and exceptional service! My bf and I have the tradition of going to a new steakhouse every year for his birthday and 2018's selection did not disappoint!We had an early 7pm reservation and were welcomed promptly upon arrival. They have a coat check which was a nice touch. First impression of the dining room was that it was very nice and elegant. After we were seated our server Meredith came over to introduce herself. She was awesome and very funny. A few moments later one of the servers brought over two bread rolls. I'm a super fan of the starter bread at steakhouses but I was a little sad these were hardly warm and were served with hard butter. For the appetizer we got the Bang Bang Shrimp - 3 delicious jumbo shrimp lightly breaded and served with chipotle mayo. They were sooooo good! Def. a favorite of the night. For our entrees we decided to share the 40oz Porterhouse steak for 2, the lobster mac and cheese, and a side of mashed potatoes. The steak was spectacular! Not only was it cooked to perfection but the presentation was amazing as well. It came out in this sizzling plate still laying in all its natural juices. The lobster mac and cheese was just ok, it was somewhat bland and I felt that it was lacking both a substantial amount of cheese and lobster. The mashed potatoes on the other hand were delicious! We were really tempted to get a second order but we were too stuffed. Needless to say we had no room for dessert! We also didn't get to try any cocktails but as far as the menu goes its mostly wines with about 4-5 specialty drinks; some of the options included an old fashioned, a mule, a martini, etc.Prices are a bit steep, I'd say $100 p/p at the very least but I think its worth it. While I do think there's a bit of room for improvement, the service makes up for the little mishaps. I will def. be coming back during Restaurant Week as I've only seen amazing reviews with regards to that!",24,12,22,Rossy M.,"New York, NY",2413,357,1200

5.0,12/9/2018,A hidden diamond! We have been to Mark Joseph a few times and have never been disappointed. The staff are very attentive and made each of us feel very special.

3.0,11/28/2018,"I am going to be painfully honest with this review......we had intentions on trying a REALLY nice steak restaurant during our Thanksgiving break.  My expectations were high as we were willing to pay for a meal that would leave us craving more (that is part of the traveling joy....to find places you can not live without). We poured over the menu during our lunch and ordered lobster bisque ( which lacked in the area of having actual lobster and used fillers) however the French Onion Soup had the perfect amount of melted crisp cheese. The wedge salad was nice and fresh, crisp and the dressing / bacon ratio was perfect.  The steak sandwich was tasty, the steak was cooked perfectly, and so were the onions.  Fries were nice and fresh.  The bread was not stellar by any means, but the taste worked.I ordered the sirloin and was really disappointed that the steaks were over cooked (3 of them).  Not certain if that was a result of the hot plates they are served on, but there is nothing more disappointing than an over cooked steak at a high end establishment. The servers were very gracious, and offered to replace the steaks, but to be honest, I was so in awe they were cooked incorrectly that we just ate what was served. The lobster mac & cheese had nice amounts of lobster, but zero cheese could be found on the dish.  The pasta was cooked nicely, and the presentation of everything was handled with care table side - but the overall experience was not at all what we had hoped for. I will say I am well versed when it comes to fine dinning (or any dinning for that matter).  The next time we are in NYC we will seek out a different steak option for our family of 6.",1,0,0,Heather K.,"Orlando, FL",16,115,123

2.0,10/13/2018,"What a highly disappointing experience. My husband wanted to take me out to a nice restaurant and had been there a while back. He said the food was wonderful. It may have been in the past however, there were too many negatives to make up for one good steak. Our bill was $250 for 2 people so at that price I expect Perfection and the highest quality ingredients. It began with my wine being served in a dirty glass it had food stuck on it and lipstick marks. As an appetizer, we had the fried oysters however, I believe that one of them may have not been cooked as long as necessary to kill off any bacteria as within the hour I had gotten sick. There didn't seem to be anything else that would make me ill that my husband hadn't eaten. There were two good experiences: the waitress was very friendly and the service from the all the service staff was extremely attentive. The silverware and the plates were all scratched and old and had seen much better days. The lobster mac and cheese was bland and uneventful not much better then a box of Velveeta. I mostly left this review to let people know to avoid the oysters and thereby avoid getting sick. I do want to say that the steak was cooked perfectly and was tender. But at $60 I would expect that.",1,0,0,Patti R.,"Highland Mills, NY",0,5,0

Porterhouse: cooked perfect, tender & perfect amount of char. Their steak sauce, a sort of cocktail slash sweet Asian duck sauce hybrid keeps hooked.

4.0,8/17/2018,"We always think of MarkJoseph Steakhouse especially when it comes to restaurant week. The thought of its bacon and steak simply had kept me up at night until now. Menu was decent without some crazy surcharge.We got a late time slot (8:15pm) as the restaurant was busy probably due to tonight being the last day of RW plus it's a Friday night. As usual, all of us opted for bacon and the 20oz sirloin steak.Bacon: it was just done perfectly with the right amount of fat. Yummm!Sirloin steak: although the portion seemed a bit smaller compared to the previous years, we were actually so full that some of us almost had food coma. It also came with cream spinach and mash potato.Dessert: half of us got the fresh berries and the other half got ice cream (chocolate and mango). Pistachio flavor was offered last year but it wasn't this time. They were small but was just enough for us.PS: the steak sauce was awesome! Great for the steak and even the bread.

4.0,8/8/2018,"Our very first experience to MarkJoseph tonight during Restaurant Week.  The food was good and well presented.  Try the steak sauce, it's amazing! Unfortunately our waiter Rob/Bobby was not attentive at all.  He actually made us feel like we somehow pissed him off and he purposely ignoring us! We struck up a conversation with the table next to us, and observed for the first hour how great their waiter Michael was! Trust me, they even noticed how we were badly neglected by our waiter. We finally had to asked Michael, who was attending to several tables in the area, to take over our table.  He was amazing in his delivery and continuous follow-up.  We also happen to have met the Manager, Jenna, a very charming, elegant women who after taking with her about our dining experience, was very compassionate about our concerns.  Jenna, thank you for all you did and for the steak sauce!

5.0,8/1/2018,"We've made MarkJoseph our go-to for Restaurant Week 2 years in a row and enjoyed every minute of it!  Last year, our family took up a table for 10 and this year my other sister joined us with her brood for a total of 15.  We were seated at the same table both times, but this year they had to extend it with another one.  Despite the large group, we were taken care of extremely well from making the reservation, to greeting by the hostess and by the outstanding waitstaff.The RW prix fixe menu includes a 3 course dinner with some nice choices.  For appetizer, your choices are Mixed Greens, Caesar Salad, Baked Clams or Sizzling Canadian Bacon.  Grab your posse and you can share different apps.  Main course choices are Bell & Evans Roast Chicken, Wild Salmon Fillet (8oz), Filet Mignon (8oz), Sirloin Steak (20oz) or Lobster Mac & Cheese.  All main courses come with Mashed Potatoes and Creamed Spinach sides, except the Mac & Cheese.  It's safe to say that we had just about ALL of the above (except maybe the chicken), plus my other sister wanted to try their Jumbo Lump Crabcake.  I think last year one of the choices was Lamb Chops, but was not available this year.I really loved how the Sirloin was served.  Mine was cooked medium-rare (as steak should be done), sizzling in a pool of crackling butter, individually sliced off the bone with nice pink centers in each slice.  I can't think of a better way to eat a steak.  Then afterward with no regard for niceties, I was gnawing on the bone to get the last bits of flavor.  My sister's dog was not getting this one.Finishing off the meal with a choice of dessert were Warm Brownie Sundae, Scoop of Ice Cream (Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry or Pistachio) or Mixed Berries & Cream.  I don't know how they made the homemade whipped cream, but it was the densest whipped cream I've ever seen, even thicker than Kool Whip.  This ranks up there with some of the best dining experiences I've had in NYC and we'll be back for some future family gathering or occasion to indulge in some high-end meat!",18,9,13,Chun M.,"Queens, New York, NY",742,585,6677

But today's meal was so good I felt almost remiss in not sharing. Apps: bacon is perfect. The gold standard. Not too fatty, not too undercooked. Just delicious. Wedge salad was perfect too-neatly divided among those interested in partaking. As it should be, the star was the steak. 6 people, 6 steaks, 5 cooked perfectly, the other quickly replaced. So good it scarcely bears describing. Sides were delicious. Brussels sprout special was exquisite.  Cream spinach terrific as usual.

My friend had long island ice tea with fried oysters omg delicious again best fried oysters to date!!! For our main course we had the porterhouse.  With the spinach.  My friend like her steak medium rare and I like mine medium well. So we got the steak medium rare because the waiter said we can sear the steak when it comes.

5.0,2/17/2018,"First, this is a REAL steakhouse & as such expect it to be expensive so come prepared. I was not there for restaurant week & kind of glad I waited until after because we found no wait time to get in. It was a spur of the moment decision for our last night in NYC. We didn't make reservations. Arrived at about 730pm & were promptly seated. They do not have kid's menus & all items are a la carte. However they were very accommodating to our kids and made them spaghetti & chicken tenders (which were not on the dinner menu so thank you!) The kids' food was really good and were big portions. Now that the kids are taken care of it's time for the adults. Ordered one bacon appetizer & to our surprise it was one bacon strip - so we thought that was comical. But it was really thick (something hard to appreciate in the pic) and was delicious. The cowboy ribeye was a large and tender cut of meat that was super delicious. The lobster mac n cheese was good but could use a lot more lobster. The star of the night was the pork chop entree. It was two huge, tender, & super juicy chops in a spicy marinade.Service was excellent and our server was super attentive and had a great sense of humor.

3.0,2/3/2018,"Restaurant week review It was average. I wasn't really impressed by any of the 3 courses. Appetizer was baked clams. This surprisingly was the ""best"" course. And not because it was fantastic ... more so because the following courses were subpar. Steak was cooked perfectly to medium rare but it was flavourless. I don't think they added any salt. There was a little herb seasoning, but it wasn't sufficient. Now I usually don't add much to my steak, but a little salt and pepper really is vital imo. And unfortunately the meat wasn't flavorful to warrant being so light on the seasoning. Desert consisted of brownies and ice cream. Brownies had a burnt taste and also were fairly flavourless. Ice cream was okay I guess. The restaurant week at Delmonico's (which is fairly close) is much better in terms of taste and atmosphere.Will not return, despite working really close.",5,1,2,Angelo B.,"Westfield, NJ",206,710,700

The house dirty martini was superb with the best blue-cheese stuffed olives (even better than Capital Grille which was the best before.) The lobster bisque was very good, and my son loved the mango sorbet.Lets start with the good - which some may say all restaurants should do that, not all do- Greeting: they walked me to the reserved party- Appetizers: the waitress made sure that we knew the sizing - so, we ordered the right amount- Steak doneness: the waitress correctly nudge me to order Medium Rare Plus versus Medium Rare- Serving: they distributed the side dishes for me. Also offered to cut my tomahawk steak so we can share family style- Attentiveness: After the waitress introduced herself, services including water were prompt and timely.Here are areas for improvement:- Appetizer - while still great, some bacon pieces were burned. The calamari was a bit overdone though the portion was large.- Service: While the service was great once the waitress had stopped by, I was there for almost 10 minutes without water - and I couldn't get anyone attention despite there were only two tables served at the time.- Steak: The waitress was good in her steak doneness recommendation - but my steak was served to another.

For dessert I shared a molten chocolate cake that was good, but it would have been better with a scoop of ice cream. They put a scoop of whip cream instead, which was odd.Only thing I didn't really like was our table was an odd shape and the servers had to reach across me at least 10 times during my meal to give my coworker her food or water.

Classy place, bar was packed and the restaurant became busy as the night went on with holiday gatherings and business dinners.We ordered the hot seafood appetizer which was very good, stuffed clams, calamari, lobster and mussels. I could have just had that and stopped, BUT I did order the bone-in sirloin strip before I had the appetizer. I ordered the steak medium as I like it lightly pink in the middle, steak came out medium rare. Waitress did offer to put it back in the oven but they serve it sliced and would have dried it out.Two others in our group stated the steak came out less what they ordered. The only negative is we had to wait a good 25-30 minutes between appetizer and the steaks being served. The place was busy so I will have to try it again after the holidays.

So what makes MarkJoseph comparable to Peter Luger? Well, for one the menu certainly has a lot in common...but there are subtle differences in taste, portion and of course, execution. The porterhouse I ordered was delicately prepared to my extensive preferences, and the service between each dish was accurately timed to our pace for the evening...all of which were executed flawlessly!

Not serving regular customers for not apparent reason is OK?Really think about that. The bartender can just decide not to serve you on a whim.  The hostess offered to buy our drinks for us.  No explanation. was offered  No apology was given. Really what can be said.  It is so INSULTING, DEGRADING  and DISGUSTING.  I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars there in the past.  I have even donated five hundred dollars to a charity for Autism that a staff  member there worked for.  I have been a regular for years.  I invited people to be my guests here and this is how ALL 3 OF US ARE TREATED!I will say that I am a woman.  I have had several conversations with other patrons regarding the fact that he does not give the same level of service to women that he does to men.  It is a neighborhood place that people all talk to each other. My family lives near by.   Tito does not get great reviews. Get ready to wait on drinks while he chats with friends or the hostess.  Alway chatting with the hostess!I guess Tito has a very good friend in the owner.  It is costing the owner money.  I'm not the first to swear off the place....I won't be the last.  Too bad for the owner that Tito does NOT respect him the same way.  If TITO did respect the owner would never treat a loyal customer that way.  So now I have to ask myself ....why is the owner OK with TITO  treating women customers like 2nd class customers?  Why does he keep him there?I called the restaurant before this was posted.  8 hours later no response.   I'm sure complaints about TITO are NOT UNCOMMON!   When I spoke with the person who answered the phone she never said...That doesn't sound like Tito... no statement like Tito would never treat a customer poorly  ..I said to her I'm sure I'm not the first to complain.  Response   No you are not the first.  ..SHE said on her own that TITO  does have a bad personality!  Edit....a friend pointed out to me that my nephews wife is Asian.  Maybe that was part of Titos attitude. Perhaps he just doesn't like Asian people.   Discrimination maybe what this is.   EDIT #2   24 hours later.   No call from the owner. NO APOLOGY  EDIT #3  It took several days for anyone from the restaurant to even call.  They did apologize but  really they did nothing else.  TITO remains employed there.  The owner was actually kind of rude to me on the phone.  NOT another dollar will I ever spend there.  HOW could they expect someone to return to their restaurant after that? They don't really seem to care that he treats someone that has been a loyal customer for many YEARS before Tito even worked has been treated absolutely AWFUL. I guess the attitude STARTS at the top.  THANKS FOR NOTHING AFTER YEARS OF PATRONIZING YOUR RESTAURANT.I'm not on Facebook ....but I will be finding someone to share this there.",0,0,0,Joanne G.,"New York, NY",5,21,0

My friend and I shared main course - 3 piece lamb chop and sirloin steak, both served with cream spinach and mash potatoes. Even though I requested medium for my lamb, it was more on the rare side, but the sirloin was perfectly cooked - medium rare, sides were good and creamy. We got ice cream for our dessert-pistachio and vanilla ice cream topped with cream. Will definitely come back.",0,0,1,S L.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",2,13,10

4.0,2/4/2017,"It's restaurant week so we traveled into Brooklyn to hit what I deemed one of the better deals of the week. It wasn't too busy late on a Friday night which was somewhat surprising to me, but I figured it was due to the cold.Started with the mixed greens with balsamic dressing, it was nothing to write home about in hindsight I should've had the bacon which looked absolutely delicious. As an entree I chose the 20 oz sirloin. It was cooked perfectly and they come out sizzling hot! They slice the meat off the bone for you which I really enjoyed and the waiter serves the steak on your plate for you ( unnecessary but I guess part of the experience). It was a really nice portion paired with the mashed potatoes and spinach for the price.Finished with the brownie sundae. Much smaller than I had anticipated but still filled the sweet spot to top the night off. I must add the ice cream there is some of the best I have ever had as is their fresh cream, absolutely delicious.Waiter was nice and attentive, overall great experience I will return!",2,0,0,Trent T.,"Nutley, NJ",53,186,439

I had him before and he wasn't friendly last time, but I didn't mind too much back then because I thought maybe he was having a bad day. However, last night, with the same server and same treatment, I have concluded this waiter doesn't like kids. This steakhouse is located by the financial district, more business-like than for family.

3.0,11/11/2016,"My buddy wanted a nice steakhouse for his wife's 40th birthday so we ended up picking this place.It's on a cobblestone street near South Street Seaport and it's a quaint location and quite nice inside...I had called ahead and asked about corkage and they said they allow up to 2 bottles. The first waiter opened one the proper way and decanted it in front of me. I had told him to decant the second one, he gave it to another guy who just started opening the bottle and pouring into the decanter. I asked if I could smell it first and taste it, and he said ""well, you brought the bottle sir, there's nothing we can do if it's bad""... hahaThat wasn't the worst part. It was a table of 8, and we had two seafood entrees, a steak for four and a steak for two, and then decided to go heavy on the appetizers. So we ordered six of them for variety.Not only did the waiter not warn us that each side was the size of a giant full plate, but that he took the liberty of doubling up our order for us since we were sharing them all family style.What 8 people would need 12 sides (having all the entrees each)???He was well intentioned I guess and kept apologizing, but given the size of each side, he should have simply stated ""those are very large, might be a bit too much for this table"" ?In any case, steaks were solid but nothing to write home about. Then we decided to get some desserts for the birthday girl... and he tried to double the order... again???!!!We split the bill among some cash and some credit cards... the final bit of nuisance was him genuinely asking if we were unhappy with the service? (Waiter-speak for ""why did you tip me so little""?)We told him to count the cash again - the tip was a little over 19%... not the greatest, but not exactly stingy either...Given all the steakhouse choices, don't think the next steak dinner will be here anytime soon.",5,2,0,Abul R.,"Brooklyn, NY",54,304,181

4.0,10/5/2016,Always make an effort to take the trip here for restaurant week. Hands down probably the best resto week deal out there for a steakhouse.  The service is always top notch all through the restaurant. They also stay on target for the resto week price fix amount.  None of the random supplement add-in prices. App: had the slab bacon slice which is unheard of getting for resto week at any other steakhouses for the resto week menu.  Most other places you'll probably get a salad or soup offering at best. Main: 20 oz bone in sirloin which is flanked by some awesome mashed potato and creamed spinach sides.  Steak comes out sizzling and they do the standard cut after presentation. Really is alot of food for resto week. Dessert: brownie w the ice cream on top. nuff said. who's ever said anything bad about a warm brownie w some ice cream?Drinks: nice bucket pours on all your spirits like a proper steakhouse should.,1,0,0,Donny H.,"Manhattan, NY",1,35,56

First, to address the main course: the Porterhouse Medium Rare Steak for Two: impeccably prepared, so delicious!  My Manhattan was good as was my wife's glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. Ordered a standard Mac and Cheese for my kid and it was super tasty with a perfectly broiled crust. Also got a greens salad, a beefsteak tomato and a side of broccoli. No complaints. The service was also fast, easy and efficient.The atmosphere is casual, which I like, but felt a bit like a sports bar. They were playing an eclectic mix of music, heavy on the classic rock including Journey and AC/DC, with a some more modern Red Hot Chili Peppers and an occasional Jazz piece.  Not what I was expecting from a $$$$ steakhouse, but if I lived here in Manhattan, I'd definitely come back...",0,0,0,Ron L.,"Oakland, CA",19,88,21

4.0,8/17/2016,Excellent choice for Restaurant Week. This is a meal worth every penny. I had the sizzling bacon appetizer and 20 oz sirloin. The bacon was a nice thick cut. They didn't skimp for a prefixe menu. And the sirloin came sizzling and a good portion. Creamed spinach and mashed potatoes came as side orders. Considering no up charge for the steak I would say this was a very good value. I would return outside of Restaurant Week.

This time, I came on a Thursday night for restaurant week with 8 people. We ordered the sirloin steak and it was still good, but could've been better if it was a bit hotter. But I can't really blame them since we were with a fairly large party and the cooked steak has to wait for the other steaks to be done cooking before it gets served. Nonetheless, it was still good, but if you come with a smaller party, the steak would probably be hotter and taste better. I tried the lamb chops and they were pretty good too. The creamed spinach was tasty. The Canadian bacon was fatty and delicious. Vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth .",0,0,0,Ada W.,"Brooklyn, NY",236,269,596
4.0,8/10/2016,"I came here with a group of girlfriends for Restaurant Week this week.  It is right by Seaport - so great for date night, and in a very cute area. I've been here before, and always found the food and service to be nothing short of great.  And of course, this third time around, our table had Ingrid as our server.  She was amazing, funny and attentive.  We started off with a bottle of wine, and since the one we chose was out, she came back with a recommendation and we went with it.  She made what would be a great dinner, even better. (so 5 stars for you).  We all ordered off the RW menu.  I had the bacon, 20 oz sirloin steak and brownie (which also happens to be the same thing I get every time I come here).  Bacon was good as always, I even ordered two to-go at the end of dinner to bring home.  Tip: dip the bacon in the steak sauce, it is good. My steak came out sizzling, and cooked medium well just as I asked.  The baked clams are good - however sometimes I find that they put too much breading on it. My friends who ordered the filet mignon also complemented how perfectly the steak was cooked to.  One of us ordered the lamb chops - it was good, but she wasn't a huge fan of the minty sauce on the side.  All entrees came with mashed potatoes and cream spinach - I don't care much for these only because I dont like the texture but I heard they're good.  Brownie was good also. Everyone was satisfied with their meal and left happy.I think MarkJoseph is one of the better steakhouses I've visited so far.  The food is always quality even if you come for RW, and the servers are always so nice.  Yes, I will be back again and again. my only complaint is that when I came a week ago (party of 2), I was seated at a table in a room obnoxiously loud and obviously drunk annoying Wall Street business men.  They were cursing, yelling, and stumbling.  I could barely hear my friend over the loudness of them. The dinner and atmosphere reverted back to normal once they got the check but the dinner was still not as top notch as the second time I went back.

5.0,8/8/2016,Came here for Restaurant Week. The best steakhouse (I've been to several). From start to finish everything was on point. We had a great server Mike (I think he's the best in a long while). He explained the menu and also have suggestions. Our reservations were for 2:30pm and when we got there it wasn't crowded at all  the ambience was calm. For appetizers I had the baked clams while my sister and cousin had the Cesar salad. The baked clams were perfectly cooked and  seasoned.  My sister and cousin said the salad was good. For the entree my sister and I both had the 14oz Sirloin Steak (medium well) and our cousin had the 8oz Grilled Salmon all of which came with mashed potatoes. The Sirloin Steak was oh so tender. It was full of flavor and was perfectly seasoned. We didn't even need the steak sauce. It was just perfect on its own. The mashed potatoes were an added bonus they weren't overly mashed. They were like fluffy clouds. Couldn't tell how the Grilled Salmon was since my cousin didn't want to share (but I'm guessing it was pretty good since it was gone in no time). For dessert my sister and I had the mini Brownie Sundae and our cousin had the Chocolate Ice-Cream. If I wasn't full I would have asked for another Brownie Sundae. The brownie was so warm and moist and the vanilla ice cream on top was just right.  Not a fan of chocolate ice cream so I didn't try it.

We each had the 20 oz. sirloin (medium rare), which is served precut.  It was cooked perfectly. Paired with the steak were mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. The creamed spinach was perfect- you will want to lick the bowl clean (we sure did!) The service was phenomenal. We were lucky enough to have Michael as our waiter.

In my prime time, I came here 3 times in a month. I reallllllllyyyyyy love this place. Can't go wrong with a slab of bacon can you? The mojito here is the bomb. When it came, it was so good we all took turns taking a sip and all our reactions were the same ---- MMMM. Like how good can a mojito be? It tastes the same every where! But first sip, it was way better than expected! But on a side note, the taste varies by the bartender making it so good luck. Steak is cooked perfectly; if you order medium rare you're getting medium rare. I hate places that over or under cook your order. If you can't grasp how well to cook a steak, you need to reevaluate yourself as a chef in a steakhouse. Service here is perfect, people are friendly and welcoming.

It's nice and soft and freshly baked with just a hint of onion.  Be careful not to fill up. It's just that good! I ordered the French onion soup which was oozing with cheese and piping hot. I ordered the special  night which was a filet mignon topped with a bernaise sauce with jumbo lump crab and asparagus. We ordered sides of creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. Just a note that the sides are enough for two. The creamed spinach was DELISH and the steak was so tender and flavorful. For dessert we topped it off with a classic NY cheesecake with a dollop of whipped cream.

Now, the star of the show.... The 12oz (or 14?) NY Strip steak.... What can I say! First of all, it's a different feeling when you hear your steak approaching the table. The sound of the sizzling meat in the butter...literally makes your mouth water. The first bite after it being served on to your plate and being drenched in its own butter.... Fabulous!! Steak was Ahhh-mazing!! Perfectly cooked medium. Little more charred towards the bone, but that happens. Perfect ratio of meet to fat to bone. Great stuff!!Our server was great.

3.0,2/3/2016,"Came here for RW, and honestly kind of dreaded the trip here. I came here thinking worst case, if the food is bad, I'll go over to Nelson Blue and make up for the night.Apps: Clams - DOPE- I can see some people saying it was too much breading, but those people can just pass down them baked clams this wayBacon - DOPE - What can I say? It's slick cut bacon.Entree: Sirloin - DOPE - comes in a searing hot plate, so if you want it cooked more--use the plate to cook it up. Perfectly seasoned steaks Lamb Chops - DOPE- I was worried that it'd be too gamey, but to my surprise it was delicious with or without the mint sauce.Sides: Mashed Potatoes--standard but good nothing to write home about.Creamed Spinach mine tasted better than my gf's but a little extra buitter fixed that. I personally thought it was made well, but as my gf is not a huge fan of a lot of vegetables, the bitterness was something she wasn't a fan of.AS a side note, that piece of bread they give you at the beginning of the meal, I dont' know what but I found myself craving more of it--it seems so simple but it's so surprisingly good that I was tempted to try and steal my Gf's piece.IF I had to fault them for something--their ""STEAK"" sauce... it's like a spinoff sauce from the red Chinese roast pork sauce. Why?.... LUCKILY none of the meets needed sauce so I suppose it's just as well (maybe they did it as a troll move for the fools who want to drown perfectly good meat in sauce)Either way if this place wasn't so far out of the way, I would probably take another stab at it",1,0,1,Alexander L.,"Brooklyn, NY",351,412,82
5.0,2/2/2016,"It was truly a pleasure to be here today, and participate in restaurant week. Just when we were searching for a go to steak house for us both, this popped up on the search.We came in during lunch, made reservations that honestly, we're not necessary during this time. We had seen a lot of pictures of this bacon that everyone was having, and though it was not included, we had to give this prize a try, even our waiter suggested it. A real prize it was. Spectacular. Smoky, charred, candy deliciousness start to finish. Something you take a bite into and say ""woah"". With or without their special steak sauce, it is a must try for anyone. A turn revert anyone back into a meat eater type dish.This was followed by two, divine steaks. The chefs here cater to the beef, and most importantly let the steak be a steak. The sirloin arrived at our table, sizzling 14 Oz steak and I'm starving. Where it would typically dusturb me, our waiter took the liberty of chopping my steak and serving it displaying the perfect medium I had asked for. Every individual piece of this steak cooked to perfection, and there was so much waiting.We also had the filet mignon, superior in taste, the flavor of the beef shined through. Tender, meaty, and the right temperature, this cut, I couldn't tell you which I preferred.The experience here was lasting as the staff is kind and dedicated, the food, made to perfection and leaves you wanting more.Restaurant week or no, will be returning for another steak here soon.",1,1,0,Devon O.,"Brooklyn, NY",117,216,516

4.0,1/30/2016,"Located near Brooklyn Bridge in the Financial District, MarkJoseph lives up to its solid reputation as a New York City Steakhouse. I had dinner here during Restaurant Week. From the fixed menu I chose the baked clams, 20 oz Sirloin Steak and the mini brownie Sundae. In addition, I started with a side order of their Canadian Bacon. One thick slice of that bacon was a great way to open up my palate for the baked clams, and of course the main entree. I always order medium rare at a fine restaurant, and the steak was exquisite. It came with two relatively small sides of mashed potatoes and creamy spinach. The mini brownie Sundae was just that, a small cube of a brownie topped with ice cream. Although a bit smaller than what I wanted, the chocolate had a strong, rich flavor and didn't disappoint.

5.0,1/23/2016,"Now that it's currently Restaurant Week again, if you're craving for steak and haven't been to MarkJoseph... I highly suggest you to make a reservation now and RUSH OVER THERE! I decided to write this review noticing this might either be my 3rd or 4th visit to them because my boyfriend and I loves this place so much especially for restaurant week. Simply the menu is the most worth it for your $38 dinner meal. The service has always been so warming, welcoming, and fantastic. This year unfortunately, I don't know why MarkJoseph decides to hide their menu on the restaurant week website... But I sure do hope it's still the same as it been for the past two years. APPETIZERS - Canadian bacon, casino clams or salad... I've always got to try all of them since I come with atleast 4 people. The Canadian bacon is a MUST, a little thick, savory and sweet. The casino clams are a little on the small side, but still good as well.ENTREES - 20oz sirloin steak & lambchops are my top two favorite that I opt for every time I come here, ESPECIALLY THOSE LAMBCHOPS! The sweet jam sauce for the chops compliments the perfectly cooked, seasoned and subtle lamb flavor so well. The 20oz sirloin steak is your standard solid steak you've had at Peter Luger and other steakhouse, sizzling on a platter, sitting on clarified butter and its own juices... Always cooked perfectly to desired temperature. Each entree is also accompanied with cream spinach AND mash potatoes which were also delicious. I've tried the filet mignon and it came a little over cooked than expected and was only mediocre.DESSERTS - warm brownie sundae, mixed berries with homemade whipped cream, or ice cream of your choice. All the desserts were fine and satisfying as well.Overall, I always visit during RW when the menu has been the same and I leave very happy with the food and completely full for a great deal. I would definitely even try it on a regular day. My mom was soo pleased with her birthday dinner here as well that happened to land during RW.",6,2,4,Monica P.,"Brooklyn, NY",432,222,440
5.0,1/22/2016,"I came here for rw with a group of 9. We made reservation for 6:30pm, our table was set up and ready for us by the time we arrived. One of the things that appealed to me about this restaurant is the easy parking, parking in the city is a hassle. We were able to score 2 spots right in front of the restaurant for free!!We ordered 2 orders of oysters and 2 bottles of wine to share among us. I'm pregnant so I didn't get to try the oysters but my husband said it was very fresh and plump. My husband and I we shared the baked clams and bacon for app. We both thought the bacon was amazing but the clams were just okay, nothing particularly special. Next we also shared our entree of 20oz sirloin steak and lamb chop. This is where the 5 stars comes in, it's the steak, it was cooked so damn perfect. I order medium rare everywhere I go, but it's always a little off or theres too much blood on the plate. But at MarkJoseph the medium rare is done so so perfect down to point where there's no blood on the plate and stays medium rare even though the plate is still hot and sizzling! The lamb chops was also fantastic, rich in its natural flavor and cooked perfectly. I didn't like the sauce that came with the lamb chop, it tasted minty and weird. But I'm sure someone else probably will love it, it just wasn't my cup of tea. Lastly we shared a brownie with vanilla ice cream and pistachio ice cream, there was too much whip cream and the ice cream was kind of melted. But then again it was probably because we were a big group and by the time they scooped everyone ice cream and bought it to the table, it's bound to cool down a bit. The server was nice, she wasn't around much. Which is the way I prefer because I was with friends that I don't get to see often and we have a lot of chatting and catching to do. But was available when we needed her. And I will definitely come back here again, whether it's restaurant week or not. The steak is worth every penny!",3,0,1,Joanna C.,"New York, NY",154,21,39

4.0,9/29/2015,"Went with two old friends after a day in court. They were shooting a movie or show on the street where the restaurant is located. Some lady tried to tell us that we couldnt walk through there, so we did what the typical Bronx dude would do; we walked through there anyway and looked at her like ""this bitch is buggin"". Anyways, to start off, we shared a plate of fried calamari. The portion was huge and the taste is definately amongst the best fried calamari I've ever had.   For entrees, one of my boys ordered the Seafood Fra Diavolo. I didnt get a chance to taste it, but according to him, it was delicious; but it was a little too spicy to fully enjoy the taste of the seafood. My other friend ordered a custom dish that wasnt even on the menu; some sort of Lobster Linguini. The waitress didnt hesitate to please his appetite, and ran over to the kitchen just to make sure it wouldnt be a problem for the chef to prepare the custom dish. I know he definately enjoyed it, because he ate it so fast, you might as well say he sniffed the entire meal. As for my order, the T-bone steak was a good size, not too fatty or boney; kinda like a porterhouse for 1. It lacked flavor though; perhaps not enough pepper or seasoning. Also, my Penne was what really stood out. Great mix of cheese, with the nice crunchy crumbs on top. Kinda reminded me of the Lobster Mac and Cheese served at Capital Grille. All of that for less than $200; not bad for a quality steakhouse.   Overall the decor was impressive, all the staff were helpful and checked up on us frequently, and from the looks of all the pictures on the walls, apparently a bunch of celebrities have been to this spot.

My 8oz fillet was cooked perfectly and was served with sides of mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. I thought the sides were a little bit small portioned but they tasted great with the steak.

Both were cooked well and came with creamed spinach and mashed potatoes.

4.0,8/7/2015,"My bf and I came here for restaurant week last night. We ordered the canadian bacon, baked clams, lamp chops, 8oz filet mignon, berries and cream, and mini brownie with french vanilla ice cream. Our waiter was friendly and courteous.We were given iced water as soon as we sat down and bread soon after. We were both starving so the bread went by fast and the appetizers came out quickly. The bacon was thick and juicy and fatty. They gave my bf such a big knife to cut the thick bacon and our waiter offered their house steakhouse which was sweet to offset the possible fatty, satly taste of the bacon. The bacon alone was great if you like fatty and juiciness. But I also liked it with the steakhouse, the sweet was a perfect offset to the salty aftertaste of the bacon. I haven't had baked clams in awhile, so I was excited to have some again. The baked clams came in 4, but it was just okay. There was a lot more bread crumbs than clam and the bread crumbs were bland, it needed more flavoring.The lamb chops and 8oz filet mignon were cooked medium. The lamb chops were so tasty and easy to chew, definitely a good choice. The filet was cooked well, but not as flavorful, I had it with the mint sauce and the steak sauce and it was okay. The sides of creamy spinach and mashed potatoes were great together and separately, but nothing special.The dessert was good too. My bf got the small brownie with french vanilla ice cream and I got the berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries) and cream.

1.0,8/4/2015,"This review is for restaurant week only.A few coworkers and I decided to try this place out for restaurant week during lunch. So I called and made reservations for a party of four at 1 pm. When We arrived, the host look surprised our reservation was for four. She had mistakenly put down two instead of four. That's not a problem as she was able to fix it and got us a table quickly. As we seated, we waited for our server to arrive and give us our menus. About 5-10 mins, the waiter arrived at our table and quickly dropped off the menu, left without saying much, not even a smile. Rude. He returned to our table about 10 mins later and asked if we were ready to order. I asked for the wine menu, I mean its Friday after all. He went and fetched our the drink menus and disappeared for a good amount of time again! Now why couldn't he have brought the drink menu along with the regular menu all at once. That could've saved us so much time. It's ridiculous that we even had to ask for it. We ordered a bottle of Merlot.. which was the probably the highlight of our whole dinning experience at MarkJoseph. As we sat and play the waiting game. We noticed the table next to us had gotten their food already and was half way done.The fact that they were seated after us. Now ain't that something. As we were finishing up our bottle of wine, still with no food in sight, our patience were wearing thin. I flagged down our waiter and asked where was our food. His answer was ""oh it takes a while to cook the medium rare steaks."" and flopped away again. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?! It takes a while to cook medium rare steaks?!?!? WTF ARE YOU COOKING IT WITH?! MATCHES!?!?We placed our orders at 1:20 and this is now 2:15 and still no food on our table. When the table next to us arrived at 1:30, finish, paid and left at 2:30. That is just unacceptable. At 2:35, We were done playing this waiting game. We decided to just have our steaks to go. As I was looking for our waiter, the bus boy brought out our food. Sadly, we decided it would be faster if we just stay and quickly finish our meal instead of having them wrap everything up. Cause god knows how long that would've take.My coworkers and I all got the 14oz sirloin steaks. It would've up our experiences had it been delicious. Sadly, it wasn't even up to par. My steak was flavorless and cold. Can't believe we waited over an hour for a flavorless piece of meat. Especially when rushing against time, it was impossible to enjoy our meal. It was one disappointment after the next. Like I said, our wine was definitely the only positive outcome out of it all. Thank goodness for alcohol. Cheers!As most people would agree, lunch breaks are within an hour time frame. And being in the restaurant industry I'm sure they know most people don't have the luxury of waiting over 40 mins for their food. So please step your game up.

There were only four clams, but I thought it was enough to sample. That was great as well. For our main course I ordered lamb chops and he ordered steak. To be fair, I thought the lamb chops would be small so when these came out it was amazed. They were flavorful and I was almost full after the first one. Although one of them was mostly fat, the dish as a whole was delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly and was good as well. For dessert we had the brownie sundae and the berries and cream. The sundae was a perfect proportion. It does have walnuts in it which I didn't mind. The berries and cream were a light and not super sweet. Overall the food was great and the service was excellent.

The food was good, especially the baked clams and the sirloin. We sat down a little after 9 and didn't get our entrees until 945.  Clearly other tables had the same issue for the wait not only to be seated but getting their food since after 9:45 when they should be closed, many tables around us were just getting their appetizers. The place looks very much like a regular NYC steakhouse but. DO NOT sit by the electronic registers or where the waiters go back and forth to the kitchen and get utensils and plates because all you will hear is them cursing at each other for knocking into one another or them spilling food and sauces rushing out of the kitchen. Unfortunately....my boyfriend and I didn't know that and we had a lovely chorus of waiters dropping the F-bombs during our expensive meal. It's sad because my boyfriend and I both work in Wall Street and we would have liked to find a steakhouse to bring our clients and friends but not if the waiters are going to swear like sailors.",0,0,0,Karen H.,"Schaumburg, IL",19,15,1

5.0,7/27/2015,"We came here for Restaurant Week last Friday evening in a group of 5.  It was our first time dining here.  The restaurant is located very close to the water. It is an old brick building in a neighborhood with cobblestone streets. The area has a great old-timey feel. The restaurant itself felt very cozy and inviting.We were seated immediately upon arriving at 7pm. The place was empty when we arrived but by 7:45, it was packed.We ordered off the RW menu. Everything, I mean everything that we had that night was superb and we all agreed that this was one of the more memorable RW meals that we've had. In the past, when we did RW, we found that many establishments gave you substitutes to make  up for the lower prices for RW. They would give you smaller portions or cheaper cuts of meat, etc.  The whole point of RW is to give prospective customers a chance to try the place at a lower price point. But if you go and serve them something not up to normal standards at your restaurant, then it would have been a waste of time for both the business and the customer.We really appreciated the fact that MarkJoseph basically served items from their regular menu at adult portions on the RW menu. The bacon was so good! Everyone MUST try the bacon for appetizer. It was a huge chunk of meat that was perfectly smoked and salted with just the right amount of fat.The 20 ounce sirloin steak was AMAZING! I love steak but usually find that it's too greasy for me to eat more than 2-3 bites. I've had good steak from all over the place. I've had the good old standy's at places like Peter Luger, Ruth's Chris, and Old Homestead, among others so I have some points of reference. The steak that I had at MarkJoseph's beats out ALL of the above. The steak was lean with just the right amount of fat that was't even visible but you could taste the tenderness in the meat. I got mine medium rare.Two people ordered the lamb chops and the plate came with 3 large lamb chops that were served with a side of spinach and mash and a mint sauce.  The lamb chops were so tender and cooked and seasoned to perfection.For dessert, we ordered ice cream and brownie sundae. The pistachio ice cream topped with home made whipped cream was really nice.  The warm brownie sundae was on the small side but it was a perfect ending to the perfect meal.  It was so good that we are contemplating going back a second time before this RW is over. It was that good.",6,1,2,Cin C.,"Fort Lee, NJ",231,244,1007

Ordering off the restaurant week menu, my friend and I started with the caesar salad and the thick slice of Canadian bacon followed by the 8oz filet mignon and the 20oz sirloin steak.The salad was well dressed and the bacon, while it was a thick cut, could probably have been rendered down a bit more. My steak was delicious. Cooked to my asked temperature of medium rare and it absolutely melted in my mouth. My friend's sirloin steak was HUGEEE. Looked mighty delicious though.We both ended with a mini brownie sundae. It really was quite small but the brownie was very rich and who doesn't love ice cream.

3.0,7/3/2015,"Continuing our birthday steak dinner tradition, my sister treated me to steak dinner at MarkJoseph Steakhouse.I chose MarkJoseph based on some pretty good yelp reviews and also that they offer a large (36oz.) single-serve ribeye!Atmosphere was quite different than some of the other NYC steakhouses I've frequented as MarkJoseph was really more casual than say a Keens or Striphouse.  In fact, during my meal I saw one customer in shorts and another wearing a Hawaiian shirt.Be it me to be the fashion police but still considering the reputed reputation and price point for the restaurant, I was expecting a more professional clientele.  Honestly, I felt a bit overdressed with my blazer, shirt and tie (I had a earlier business meeting, so it kind of worked out).Decor for the restaurant was generally solid, but I felt the entire dining area could use a bit of an overhaul.  It had neither the cool sleek look of Striphouse, the traditional stoic look of Keens, nor the modern elements of Quality Meats; falling somewhere in the middle.One thing I have to mention was the very disappointing state of the men's bathroom.  I took a brief break to freshen up and upon entering the bathroom I felt I was transported to a bathroom in an old school Chinatown restaurant.  Did I walk into the employee's bathroom?Unfortunately that wasn't the case; the bathroom's level of cleanliness and condition was suspect at best, and I will leave it at that.Now onto the more appetizing aspect; the food.- We ordered two seafood appetizers consisting of the Tuna Tartare and Fried Oyster with Spicy Remoulade.Both were excellent.The Tuna Tartare was pleasantly a larger portion than I expected and it was really quality fresh tuna seasoned ever so fragrantly with sesame.Fried Oysters were delicious as well; no briny taste and fried nicely with a light and crispy batter.  The Remoulade was a nice pairing to the oysters; slightly creamy and tangy (tasted some nice Horseradish flavors).- We each ordered the mammoth 36oz. bone-in ribeye steak medium rare and they looked to be every bit of 36 ounces.The steaks had an epic char on them; in fact I felt it was charred better than any steak I've eaten so far which really enhanced the flavor (look up the Maillard effect to really understand this magical phenomenon).However this is where I was disappointed.  First off I noticed my steak was visibly smaller than my sister's steak.  Maybe they weighed the same (maybe one had more bone), but just offhand she was served a steak clearly larger than my steak.Secondly, my steak while a perfect medium-rare at the first outer layer of the steak; revealed to be clearly a medium getting deeper into the center.I had already eaten a good 1/2 of the steak, so I felt it inappropriate to complain about this so far into the meal.Nonetheless the steak was still juicy and was quite robust in beef flavor; still can't get over that yummy char though.My sister's steak was just the right temp (medium-rare as well) which seemed to hold consistent throughout the remainder of her steak.- Sides to accompany the steaks were steamed Broccoli Rabe and Hash Browns.The steamed Broccoli Rabe proved to be a nice refreshingly light dish considering the other elements of the meal.  The Rabe was fresh and had a mouth pleasing slight bitterness to them.Hash Browns were cooked to a nice crisp and exactly the way I like itService was very solid as our waiter and server were both attentive and very well informed.A mixed bag is the best I can say; obviously some high points and some negatives.Again I wish yelp would allow for half stars, as MarkJoseph would get 3.5/5 from me, but considering what I was expecting MarkJoseph was a tad disappointing.",3,0,0,Edward C.,"Matawan, NJ",163,350,1427
2.0,7/2/2015,Maybe its because i was full?  Maybe it was because i have this certain expectation when it comes to tuna tartar?  Maybe im not a foodie after all?  Maybe I should have ordered steak?  Anyways whatever the problem was it just wasnt there for me.  Sidnt order steak but instead ordered the tuna tartar which was the nastiest thing i ever put into my mouth. i took 3 bites and i was done.  Would you like it go madam? no i most certainly do not.  Not mad they didnt takenit off my bill either (lesson learned)  Bacon was good but it would be orgasmic if they had that tangy honey mustard or something.  Like i said maybe i shouldnhave ordered steak? dont think ill be back.

5.0,4/8/2015,"This is my first review on YELP, but I felt compelled to write it in defense of this excellent restaurant after reading a recent review from ""Linda"" regarding her experience the other night. The details of the events, and most importantly professionalism of the staff from the manager down to the bus boys are grossly misrepresented and I hate to have the reputation of one of the city's best neighborhood restaurants tarnished. Please forgive me if this is poorly written as unfortunately my applications to be a Lawyer and prestigious NYC private school teacher were rejected and therefore my financial and social status may result in a few run on sentences or poor grammar.I happened to be seated at the actual bar that evening watching the Rangers game with a few friends, and chatting with the bartender who happens to be extremely well liked by all customers as any regular patron of the restaurant can attest to. Around 8:50 a comment came from a table (which I now know to be Linda's) towards the bar in a condescending tone saying ""you gonna put the national championship game on"" that made myself and all three of my friends take notice. There was no ""excuse me, can you please"" or ""if possible can you please put the hoops game on"", and the tone insinuated that it was somehow a mystery to the bartender and everyone else in the restaurant since he was shouting, that one of the biggest sporting events of the entire year was on. Despite the rude tone, the bartender said yeah no problem it starts in a little bit we'll put it on. Linda's friend (fat guy with glasses) shot back immediately, well how bout now it's starting. At this point we took the liberty to inform this rabid NCAA hoops fan that tip off wasn't for at least 20 minutes at around 9:15. Another rude comment fired back saying it starts now, mind your business and another order was directed at the bartender to turn the game on. The bartender politely said I will  make sure it is on for the start. Over the next 15 minutes, numerous comments came from portly glasses guy about the game, and he provided the entire restaurant with a minute by minute count down. Finally, he flagged down the hostess, a waiter, and bus boy letting them know the game was starting in 6 minutes and he did not want to miss tip off as if they hadn't been able to hear his barking for the last 20 minutes. Once again the bartender politely interjected and said I promise it will be on by tip off, do not worry. This did not quell comments from the peanut gallery.Now again, since I am not a lawyer or prestigious educator of new york city's most privileged youth, maybe the technology I use is a bit out of date, but in my world it only takes a few seconds to change a channel so a 6 minute window didn't seem all that crazy to my friends or me. Sure enough the bartender, after helping other customers at the bar, excused himself for a second to go change the channel and turn the game on. Sure enough, despite these NCAA fanatics assertions of a 9pm tip off, there were two minutes to spare for us to catch some commercials and commentary before tip. Normally I would expect this to make everyone happy and any tension should have been relieved so everyone could enjoy the game. Unfortunately that did not quell team Linda. As her heavyset friend with the glasses continued his comments, with his speech becoming more slurred by the second. Clearly he was intoxicated and now he was not only being demeaning to the staff, but also yelling at the other patrons who were asking him to calm down and treat everyone with respect.The first four minutes of the game were exciting as one would expect, so we found it unfortunate that Linda and her table missed the action since they didn't even bother to turn around and watch the game once it was turned on after all the commotion they caused. A few minutes later after some more antagonizing comments to basically anyone within shouting distance they got up to leave. These stewards of society then left with one final comment to the group sitting at the bar ""If you want to settle this we'll be at Nelson Blue waiting"". The tone of his voice intimated he was looking for a fight, though the suggested setting and his general appearance made us question whether he was offering to by them some cosmopolitans to bury that hatchet instead.  Needless to say the other patrons decided not to take the belligerent upholder of the law on his offer and remained at the restaurant to enjoy the always generous hospitality and great food.In response to Linda's threat of never returning, I doubt that the restaurant and anyone unfortunate enough to be eating in the same place will be missing the condescension and look at me I'm a big shot attitude of her and her friends and their whopping $400 spending sprees. I for one, can't wait to go back. PS get the pork chop with hot pepps. Bzzzp",2,0,2,Matt C.,"Battery Park, Manhattan, NY",1,1,0

1.0,4/6/2015,"At a supposedly reputable steakhouse, I expect the staff, including the bartender, to treat each of the patrons equally and with basic civility.The bartender (short, spiky gelled hair, appeared in his late 20's or early 30's) tonight was so rude and unprofessional that it almost caused a full blown fight in the restaurant.  He could not have handled the situation any worse. I was with 3 others seated in the bar and at 9:10pm we asked if one of the 3 TVs in the bar could be turned to the NCAA National Championship basketball game. Tip off was scheduled for 9:18. Instead of saying sure or any of the other many possible responses that would have been appropriate, he responded rudely and blew us off. He smirked, mumbled and continued talking to his friends who were seated right in front of him. It was blatant, unnecessary and bizarre.His attitude was as if he was insulted that we asked. He made a comment like ""yeah I know the game is on"" as he rolled his eyes and turned away from us. We said ""oh ok we thought tip off was coming up"" and he sarcastically said ""you got 8 minutes"". He then proceeded to wait all 8 minutes to put the game on. It was unnecessary. His friends egged the situation on by telling us to relax and by cursing at us. The bartender grew ruder and more confrontational when we again politely asked if they could put the game on. One TV had the Astros/Indians game and the other 2 TV's both had the Rangers game so clearly he could have put the hoops game on one of the TV's.A back and forth ensued between my group and the bartender and his friends. It was something I had never before seen in an upscale steakhouse. The bartender, instead of stepping in to calm a situation he caused, stood silent with a rude smirk on his face. It wasn't until the hostess and waiter got involved and apologized that the situation diffused and we left.Not only was the bartender completely out of line in rudely blowing us off and speaking to us when we made a simple request but his friends escalated things to a level you rarely see at a dive bar let alone a fancy steakhouse in the south street seaport. After rushing to finish our $400 meal, we left quickly.

4.0,2/26/2015,"Came with a few friends to sample out their restaurant week menu and was satisfied with the meal. There was no wait for a table since we had a reservation. Restaurant was packed with a more dressier crowd so the atmosphere seems more upscale than expected. Drinks and water was served promptly and the friendly waitress often checked in to see if we were ready to order.For appetizers, we tried their fried calamari (not on the restaurant week menu), fresh salad, bacon and baked clams. Calamari was unremarkable but was good enough to fill my craving. The Cesar salad is just a salad...you make what you want of it, I'm not about the salad life. The thick cut of bacon, though a bit on the salty side was a nice start to the meal and was probably the best appetizer on the menu. The baked clams are best explained as four small garlicky crusted clams on the shell with a touch of broth inside, an interesting taste but not something you'd want at a steakhouse.(((commence long wait for our entrees)))but for dinner service at a small restaurant like this packed on a Wednesday night, it was acceptable and plus we had plenty of conversation to keep us busy.The entrees were tried was the 8oz  filet mignon, 20 oz porterhouse steak, and the salmon. The plating at this restaurant seemed dull but who cares! It's a steakhouse! The filet mignon was great. I asked for medium rare and got exactly that. To compare it with the porterhouse, it has a more juicy savory texture. The porterhouse (also medium rare) was more crispy yet juicy AND the best bang for your buck if that's what you're looking for. As expected, the salmon was cooked to perfection and stayed juicy while not over cooked.Desserts took a bit of time to reach the table. Most of us got the mini brownie sundae. A delicious small chuck of brownie with a matching mini scoop of vanilla ice cream with caramel drizzle. My friend got the ice cream which came as a scoop with an equal scoop of fluffy flavorful cream. Both were great and from the looks of other tables, the fresh berries and cream seemed like the more refreshing choice at the end of the meal.

3.0,1/9/2015,"Just sat down to dinner and ordered the pork chops.   It wasn't the best choice. The chops were done medium but difficult to cut even with a steak knife. The sauce was an excessively spicy pepper sauce.  Had to grab for the water.  The maître d' was gracious, checking on how things were.  She suggested mashed potatoes to complement the pepper sauce, and brought over a generous dish of spuds. Now I have eaten here a couple times before and found the food superb.  As good or better than Peter Lugar's or Wolfgang's. But that's what you get when you don't order steak at a steak house.  To be fair my son ordered well, the fillet Oscar.  It was tender and absolutely delicious!   It was too much for him, so I finished it.  So the chops get 3 stars the steak 5 stars.

3.0,1/5/2015,"Came here with the BF one night for dinner and had a small two top up against a wall in a smaller side room.  There was a hole/window in the wall that opened up into the bar area.  The room was packed and it felt very congested in the room.After being seated our server greeted us and he was super duper nice, actually the main reason why I'm even giving MarkJoseph at least three stars.  The food was mediocre at best and as I said prior, the ambiance lacked the real feel of a steakhouse and had too many people crammed into a tiny space.  Maybe it was an off night for the kitchen when I went, but my steak was just not up to par; and with a 4-star rating I expected a lot more.I don't see myself ever wanting to make the trip to this particular steakhouse again, but I am willing to give it another shot since the service was really great.  We shall see ...",5,3,4,Pia V.,"New York, NY",1913,894,1648

2.0,11/13/2014,"Pardon my French, but what the f*ck happen with MarkJoseph's??This used to be my favorite, under the radar,  steakhouse in Ny. I was so proud to recommend it to any one looking for a great steak at a fair price. To me the quality of their meat always held up to the Old Homesteads and Peter Lugars of the city. Sounds crazy I know, but I always left extremely satisfied. Plus its a much more relaxed atmosphere than other steak houses. That's because its family owned and sits on a very quiet block in the South Street Seaport. So it pained me to have the experience I did last Saturday with 8 of my friends. We got there at 9 to a packed restaurant. We sat down and decided to split our orders into 3 groups of 3s. My group ordered the bacon and wedge salad to start, a porter house for 3 and spinach and hash browns as sides. Let's start with the wedge. IT WAS ABYSMAL. Its not that it tasted bad but it was such a sorry excuse for a wedge if was laughable. There was nothing but iceberg lettuce and tomatoes. The blue cheese wasn't crumbled on top it was served on the side in a creamy dressing that tasted cheap. Plus there was no bacon. Are you serious??The bacon app was okay. More fatty then I remembered but decent. After the starters I was hoping the salad was just a hiccup. Unfortunately I was wrong. The Porter House was underwhelming to say the best. It did not taste like a $150 steak. Too fatty. The filet side usually melts in your mouth and is so tender it taste like butter. Not that experience at all. The sides were fine but that's not why we came. We ended up getting dessert at the end and that happen to be the best part of the meal. However a brownie with ice cream runs you $16. I think I left so angry because I know MJ is much better than this. But everything felt like ownership was taking the easy way out. Like they were trying to get over on their customers. I just felt some what robbed after eating here. I hope I'm wrong but you have to be better or this restaurant will not last much longer. Ps. They didn't even give us a bread basket to start!! wtf! After we asked they gave us one piece each. And didn't offer another when we were done. This was a $100+ per person bill and I'm begging for bread.

The service was great, the gentleman who served us definitely knew what he was doing (he has worked there 11 years!) the ambiance was relaxed. The hostess was also very cordial. Onto the appetizers we ordered were the crab cake and calamari. The crab cake was delicious flakey served with a small side salad with a tasty vinaigrette. The calamari was a total disappointment felt they were over done and chewy the dipping sauce made it tolerable but definitely skip that. Our main course consisted of steak for two with two sides I chose the garlic mash and he chose creamed spinach. The meat was cool to perfection at medium the plate came out sizzling so if you want it a little less red leave it on there while it cooks. The mash potatoes were okay but I felt that they could have used garlic instead of garlic powder ( very diner esque), I didn't eat the spinach as it was too tart for me. My dinning companion said it was fine but nothing to write home about. We didn't do desert as what was on the menu was not available.

2.0,8/25/2014,"I had a wonderful experience at this restaurant during restaurant week so I've decided to bring my family back to enjoy a wonderful experience too. I was so disappointed and let down by the end of the night. I was actually really close to canceling the dinner because it was raining and inconvenient to dine that night. I arrived on time and got seated promptly at our table. The hostess lead us to a nice round table. It was comfortable and spacious. I really regret not remembering our server's name because he was part of the reason why this experience left me disappointed. I wanted to impress my parents and siblings. I wanted them to enjoy wining and dining. The server served us in a very casual, sloppy, thoughtless way. I cant get over the fact how unbearable the service was. Let's just say he didn't make us feel welcomed at all. I'd probably assume that a Chinese family is not his thing. I understand how Chinese customers could be because I work in a restaurant myself. I don't know what was his problem. My family and I felt uncomfortable the whole entire dinner as if we did something wrong to piss him off. I almost felt like just giving up and eat somewhere else. The service was not attentive and it did not get better by the end of the night. I ended up packing my entire meal to go because I was annoyed enough to lose my appetite.

The servers were very tentative and nice. Everything came in a very timely manner. Since it was restaurant week, my friends and I decided to order different things so we can share and try everything.For appetizer, we ordered the clams and bacon. The clams were good, but it was just typical. If I had to spend a lot of money on it, I probably wouldn't come here. The bacon was very yummy and not too fatty.For entree, we ordered two sirloin steak (medium rare) and the lamb chops (medium rare as well). The sirloin steak was cooked perfectly, however, it was lacking a lot of seasoning, which was kind of a let down because I was expecting so much more. I had to add salt and pepper for it to taste better. The lamb chop was cooked really nicely. It was seasoned well and it kind of just melts in your mouth. I usually don't like lamb, but this lamb was really good, although it was kind of on the fatty side. These entrees came with mash potato and spinach sides that were excellent by the way.

3.0,8/15/2014,"Came here for dinner during restaurant week, and really wish I had taken my money somewhere else. While the restaurant wasn't entirely abysmal, the food being served did not warrant the prices being charged. We got the bacon, 20oz Sirloin (med. rare), and the brownie sundae. Bacon: 4/5The bacon is absolutely delicious. It looked like it was about a foot long, and it was seared to perfection. It was warm without being hot, and very fatty. Just the way I like it. Steak: 3/5The steak was cooked to a perfect med rare just as I had requested. What I couldn't understand was why there was no seasoning on the meat? I had to add salt & pepper to the steak. This was quite possibly the worst steak I've had in Manhattan so far. Sundae: 3/5In my opinion, it's pretty hard to screw up a brownie sundae. I mean, all you really need is a warm, and soft brownie with a scoop of ice cream on top. Alas, my brownie was cold. Not even lukewarm. Overall, not a very impressive restaurant. I would much rather go to Del Monico's over this any day of the week. P.S: The ambiance isn't too nice either.

We ordered the baked clams, the caesar salad and candian bacon for starters. Everything was great! I would certainly get the baked clams again! The canadian bacon was good..but a little to salty. It was good to try, but Id order the baked clams or salad before I ordered the bacon again. We all of course went with the filet mignon and it was amazing! They cooked each steak to the exact temperature we all requested. The steak was juicy and just melts in your mouth. It also came with a small side of mashed potatoes and cream spinach which were nice additions to the meal. This was just a wonderful treat of a meal! The steaksauce complimented the steak perfectly as well.Lastly everyone had the brownie sundae and I ordered chocolate chip ice cream. Again we were not let down. This entire meal hit the spot!

We have been to this restaurant several times, and we have always found it to be an average New York Steakhouse. On this occasion, however, we experienced all of MARK JOSEPHS shortcomings. We placed our orders with our waiter, I ordered the sirloin (medium, pink inside), and my wife ordered the scallops. When our plates arrived the steak was underdone, and I asked the waiter if I could have my steak done medium. The waiter said that he would get the manager. CAROL ANN, the manager, came to our table, and told me that ""you may not know this, but this how we prepare a steak medium"". I didn't argue, I simply asked that I have a steak prepared the way I wanted it done. They took the steak back, and the side dishes (creamed spinach and hash browns) were delivered. Both of these were cold, and the creamed spinach could have been mistaken for green spackle. When my steak arrived the second time, it had been pan fried to a dry leathery consistency. I asked to see our waiter, and Carol Ann returned to ask me ""what's the matter now"". I told her, again, that this is not what I had ordered, and that my wife's meal and the sides were cold. We were ready to leave when Carol Ann insisted that another order was being prepared. We should have left. When the order came back for a third time, it was another disappointment. My wife's meal was still cold, the sides were still cold, and my steak was even less cooked than the original. As we got up to leave, I asked for the check. The manger was obviously upset that we couldn't understand their level of excellence, and told me that it was paid for. It wasn't obvious at first, but considering that the restaurant was half empty at a prime seating time, I have come to believe that MARK JOSEPHS may not have the skilled cooks (they can't be chefs), to prepare a meal to order. I have seen other reviews of MARK JOSEPHS questioning the grade of meat that is served (choice vs prime). To this point I cannot venture an opinion, as I never had the opportunity to taste the meat. The service was poor, and could be attributed to either a lack of communication between the front of the house and the back, or that the wait staff simply don't care. Managements condescending attitude completed the trifecta, and provided us with a truly uncomfortable evening.Normally I wouldn't comment on the location of a restaurant, but considering the poor standards that MARK JOSEPHS displays, the inconvenience of it's location only adds to the letdown.

I had a piece of the 12 oz filet mignon my wife ordered. That was very good as well.Next time well get the porterhouse for 2 but the rib eye was simply amazing.We shared the sides - mashed potatoes were ok, hash browns were great, creamed spinach was ok, onion rings were good but a very big portionWe had a couple of desserts to share and they were 9/10 as well.I didn't have any drinks so I cant comment on the alcohol part but everyone seemed to be pleased with their martinis/wine/beer.Will definitely come again.

4.0,3/12/2014,"Came here for Restaurant Week last Wednesday. Everything was almost perfect! For the appetizer I had the baked clam. I've never had anything like that before and it was good! For entre, I ordered their filet mignon and it was uh-maaaayy-zing!! I got the filet medium rare and it was really tender. It came with a side of mashed potatoes and spinach. The mashed potatoes was great but the spinach was a little bit on the salty side. I like salty food so I had no problem with it but I knew that it was too salty for some people. A friend who dined with me told me that Peter Luger's steak is still better than what we had at MarkJoseph. I've never been to Peter Luger's steak house but I thought MarkJoseph's was fine. Dessert wasn't too great, however. I had the pecan ice cream with a big scoop of whip cream (WHY?!). The ice cream was fine but that whip cream on top was a big turn off. So overall, appetizer and entree were great but I didn't end my meal with a bang because of that stupid whip cream.Service was great! The waiter was funny, down to earth and not patronizing or intimidating. So for that alone, I'm upgrading my rating from 3 stars (damn whip cream!) to 4 stars.

3.0,3/11/2014,"Came here during restaurant week. Service is excellent. seems they have a person to bring you plates, one to bring you bread and butter, and one to fill your water exactly when you need it, but the steak itself I thought was sort of lacking in seasoning. I had tbone and I liked that they cut it for you away from bone but I just feel they under season the steak and for the price....well I think it goes more towards the service rather than the steak itself.",0,0,0,Mark C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,5,2
2.0,3/2/2014,Came here for restaurant week as my bf said we really need to have steak in NYC. Waitress was really nice - she was friendly and was always there to refill our water - and she didn't badger us to order additional drinks.We had started off with the Canadian bacon - which was pretty good. But they do tend to be on the charred side.We then had the spring green salad (nothing to say) and the baked clams (too much brea crumbs).Then we had the filet minion - which was pretty tasteless. We had ordered this as we thought the sirloin was too big (20 oz). But in hindsight we should have ordered that as it definitely smelled better.The original house steak sauce is interesting and definitely need it for the steak. But beware - it is made of corn syrup!We ended off with the brownie sundae which wasn't bad - it was warm with ice cream on top.,1,0,1,Julia H.,"East York, Canada",49,414,1051
1.0,2/27/2014,"Wow, wow, wow.Me and my family came here for Restaurant Week and we were extremely disappointed.#1. We made a reservation but still had to wait another thirty minute before we could sit down.#2. We order at 8p.m. and we did not get our appetizer until 8:30p.m. and our main course took even longer; 4 pieces of sirloin steak took one hour to be prepared.#3. The steaks. We order three medium and one medium rare. Result? It took them one hour to prepare the steak, ONLY to give us the wrong order! They served three well-done steaks and one medium rare.From that we had to wait another twenty before we could finally eat our dinner. At the meantime we ordered beer while waiting but the server took his time and brought us the beer twenty minute after we asked him.Our moods were already killed by then. It was not until the end where we were paying for the meal. We paid with credit card and when the server (I remember your name, GREG) brought back the check, WITHOUT THE CREDIT CARD. It was horrifying and he did not even bother to apologize.I understand that it is Restaurant Week and it might be overcrowded... But restaurants should be about goods & services and from what we experienced... Sorry, I can only give this place one star(the food itself could receive three stars).",2,0,0,Lily Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,8,4
5.0,2/23/2014,"I had restaurant week lunch here with my sister. We didn't expect much as we understand that restaurants participating in restaurant week cannot provide their full potential due to their financial restriction on the menu. For $25 (3 course prix fixe) you cannot expect something that is normally $50+ you know? Anyways, I had the baked clams as an appetizer, filet mignon (supplementary fee) for my entree, and the brownie sundae for dessert. Out of my entire meal, I regretted getting the clams. It was a small portion of four small clams (which I had expected) but I thought the lemon was too overpowering and felt that they were too stuffed with breading. The filet mignon was divine for the price. Cooked medium rare to perfection. Bravo MarkJoseph!! Dessert was lovely as well. What really topped it off was the brownie sundae. It was petite but I think that's what made it so good- having just the right* amount. Brownie wasn't too sweet or chocolate-y. Yum. I'm really impressed with their restaurant week menu.

5.0,10/2/2013,"Thanks to Yelp! I found this steakhouse jewel near work, a perfect choice for a quiet , quality dinner celebration with my boss. In the forefront was the personal service, from call ahead reservation to seating, explanation of how they serve steak. The manger came by to not just check on everything but explain 12 plus year history of MarkJoeseph and ask if they could make the evening more pleasureable. The classic steak for two was some of the best beef I've ever had, sizzling and yummy. Must have sides are creamed spinach and hash brown potatoes.The atmosphere is very classic. Interestingly I felt a little more like I was ""out of New York"" like North Carolina coast or something.

The neighborhood is super interesting and getting more developed waterfront wise. There are plenty of places to walk afterwards for a nightcap or dessert although MJS has great desserts too. Especially the home made ice cream.This area was hit hard by hurricane Sandy and while the construction continues in the area it is really coming together and last trip to Mark Joseph's we walked along the waterfront and was amazed at the views and parks normally unseen in midtown.

4.0,8/19/2013,"Went here for Restaurant Week, but I did glance at the regular menu and the prices were not exorbitant for a NYC steakhouse.Ordered the filet mignon and the bone-in sirloin.  The filet was pretty good - no surprises here.  But I actually really enjoyed the bone-in sirloin.  It came on a sizzling plate with some sort of butter sauce sizzling at the bottom of the angled plate.  The steak was cut and sliced off the bone, which was really nice since my dining buddy found the steak a bit too rare for her taste - it was ordered medium, but came out a bit closer to medium-rare.  We just took each 'cut' of steak and flipped it on the side to cook it a bit more to our liking.The service was top-notch.  Surprisingly, the place wasn't too crowded around 9pm Friday evening.  Given the quality of the meal and and the excellent service, I thought this place would have much more business.For the appetizer, I ordered the Canadian bacon and enjoyed every bite of it.  If you like salty, thick cut of bacon, you will enjoy this.  Highly recommended.Finding places like MarkJoseph is what makes Restaurant Week great.  I would probably be a bit too apprehensive about trying places like this.  But doing a search on the Restaurant Week website, looking for availability through OpenTable, and taking a look at their menu, helped me find this gem of a steakhouse.  I will return for sure.  It helped quite a bit that their Restaurant Week menu did not skimp on their offerings and mirrored their regular menu pretty well.  Overall an excellent steakhouse that can hold it's own against the top steakhouses in the city.  Definitely worth a visit if you're in NYC and in the mood for steak.",4,0,0,Brian C.,"Manhattan, NY",26,270,0

3.0,7/26/2013,"This is a review about their restaurant week menu.  I haven't tried anything from their normal menu, so I cannot review that.  Let me begin by saying I can only hope that their normal menu is much better than what they offer for restaurant week.  The portions were tiny, after having a three course meal, I was left hungry.  I ordered the baked clams, and being completely honest, I've had much better.  I also had the filet mignon; it was decent, but nothing amazing.  Tasted like a steak anyone could make at home.  My companion had the salmon dish; it was also nothing special.  For dessert, I had the brownie sundae; This is probably the only dish I can't complain about.  It was pretty good, but it was about the size of a half-dollar coin.  My companion also had the strawberry creme dessert; it is exactly as it sounds, 4 strawberries surrounding a scoop of whipped cream.  Nothing special, and the strawberries were bitter.Overall, this is the worst restaurant week experience I have had yet.  I have never felt the need to write a review until now, but I felt that I should to warn other restaurant week goers.  If you're looking for a place that offers small portions, is pricey, and offers nothing special, this is the place.  You would be better off cooking at home, it will taste the same and save you $90.

The char was just right, the steak was tender like butter, and my favorite aspect of it was that it was not salty as shit.  The taste and texture was about as good as it gets.  I have to admit, this place actually surpassed my favorite steakhouse in the city (Wolfgang) and it easily trumped other favorites of mine like Old Homestead, BLT, Del Frisco's, Keen's, Sparks, Uncle Jack's and Frankie & Johnnies.  The steak for 1 was a pretty good portion, but not overwhelmingly so.  It's rare that I eat steak and actually have room for dessert.As for the others - the creamed spinach here was solid.  Again, the balance was just right.  Not overly creamy, not too rough, and not too salty.  It was flavorful and easily is my favorite creamed spinach just behind what they serve at Wolfgang.  The steak fries were also good.  Not too greasy and very very well seasoned and tasty.  My lady had the sea bass, which she absolutely loved.  She's not a steak eater, but she did say this was the first steakhouse she went to that she actually really enjoyed the seafood offering.  That says a lot considering how painful it is for her to find something she likes in all the steakhouses we've visited because of me.  Thanks to the balanced flavor, portions and feel - I was able to have room to try out a piece of key lime pie.  Also excellent, with a very refined schlag (heavy whipped cream) accompaniment that didn't feel overly sweet or heavy.   Again, they really have the balance thing locked up here.The service was great and the place was fairly bustling on a Friday night.  Things got a bit busier around 8pm and the volume definitely got louder.  But overall the ambiance was nice and very cozy.   I definitely recommend this little Manhattan gem to any steak lover looking to broaden out from the Peter Lugers of the world.  You will be rewarded with a tasty meal and probably a very good overall dining experience.",5,2,5,Kevin W.,"Manhattan, NY",1288,747,1078

3.0,12/23/2012,First off let me say the food was delicious and I am happy they are back after the storm.  The poor Seaport looks like a war zone.Now here is the BUT.  The management needs to decide if they want it to be a classy restaurant or an old boys club.  We went to have a nice steak dinner for my friend's birthday.  She picked it because the food sounded good and it looked fancy on the website.  We get there and are greeted by a sports bar crowd and multiple drink men.  We are seated gratefully a bit away from the bar but you could still hear them.  On top of that the music was horrible top 40s played rather loudly.  The room was a bit dowdy and in stark contrast to the noise of the crowd and music.Our waitress was lovely and like I said the food was delicious.  We had the crab cakes which were the best I have ever had.  We also shared the filet mignon and porterhouse and both were delicious.  So they need to work on the ambiance.,0,0,1,Gina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",160,151,3
4.0,12/10/2012,"This place is hidden, yet large on the inside. The food is great, but the decor is outdated (though that may change, since this is one of the many establishments hit hard by the hurricane and undergoing construction bc of it). Service was speedy and great, not crowded or loud, but also not trendy. Still, none of this took away from the food. The steak and sauce were delish. Far better than Peter Luger in the opinion of myself and my MI-raised boyfriend. The Mark Jospeh's steak sauce was to die for. I almost bought a bottle for myself.

5.0,12/7/2012,"This place is a gem.  Just visited this past Sunday; it was their grand opening after renovating from Sandy.  This was the second time I've been here and each time I've had consistently great service and amazing food.  If you love bacon (why wouldn't you) you MUST try the Canadian bacon.  It is crispy, fatty, sizzling, salty and melt in your mouth delicious.  Jared, the bartender, makes a killer bloody mary and serves it up with an equally killer smile.  If you're looking for dessert - get the mango sorbet - you will not regret your decision.This place is classy without feeling stuffy and they're decked out for the holidays with twinkling lights and bright red bows.  This place has it all - great decor, fantastic service, and seriously yummy food.  I am definitely looking forward to my next trip.",0,0,2,Dalhea K.,"Austin, TX",142,145,4

I am a foodie, but am a Manhattanite.  The incremental difficulties and trouble that you go through to get to the Luger's aren't worth the trouble to me.  However, I would venture out to the back alleys of the South Street Seaport for MarkJoseph.  The manager/staff is super friendly.  Have gotten some real awesome wine deals.  I get more of a neighborhood feel than any other steak place in the city that I go to.  I also personally prefer their steak sauce to the Luger's and pick up a couple of bottles when my home supplies are low.  This restaurant has been one of my favorite restaurants for a number of years now and will likely stay that way.",3,1,3,Son D.,"Scottsdale, AZ",41,26,0
5.0,8/21/2012,"This is what I like!  I want the best of what this city has to offer without all the crap I would rather do without.What do I like? Great apps, MUST have the bacon, the mussels in white wine, and the crab cakes.  For those who go raw, the clams and oysters are some of the freshest you'll get. Simply amazing cuts of meat, fabricated and dry-aged in house, cooked to perfect temps, juicy and full of flavor.  The porterhouse is insane, as is the rib steak  and  the filet mignon.  Ask for them rare, or even blue, just to be able to custom finish the slices upon the sizzling cast iron they arrive .On the other side of the entrees menu are a fantastic Chilean bass and a perfectly executed seafood fra diavlo (this coming from a pasta snob)All the sides we had were great, especially the perfectly cooked asparagus and sauteed mushrooms.We were really surprised by a couple of the desserts.  One was an apple pastry: tender, flavorful inside; flaky, and buttery on the outside.  Another was this super-decadent brownie  served warm with ice cream (another must!)I just really enjoyed being able to eat food of this caliber and attention to detail without all the attendant suffering.  With fare of this nature I expected to find the typical: somber, or worse-noisy surrounds, detached or removed management, aloof  and stiff waitstaff .  But I didn't.  The hostess was very gracious and down to earth.  Our waiter knew his menu very well, both his recommendations and attention were spot on.  The architecture and atmosphere of the restaurant came together in such a way as to not only convey strength and substance, but a great amount of comfort and ease as well.

2.0,8/5/2012,"This was the second time I came to this lovely restaurant. Not so lovely after my most recent experience. The ambience, atmosphere, and food was all quite satisfactory... Their porterhouse was amazing and cooked exactly to our liking. Their bacon in the appetizer menu and alright, nothing special. It was their service that I decided to write a review. The guy was good and on point, from pouring our wine, checking on us ....all the way till delivering our entrees.  After that he disappeared!! Well not really... He was catering to a table of 15...so he not as receptive to us. Initially, I took it easy and was still relaxed thinking that he did not forget about us. Boy was I wrong. Sad excuse for a wait completely neglected us. Took about 10 min to clear our food, 15 min to get our dessert and another 15 to get the bill. I had to walk up and ask the hostess for our bill. She was quite surprised that no one was around. I was quite pleased with this restaruant up until my most recent experience. Now I am quite hesitant to go back there. I was going to call the waiter out, but why even waste my energy on someone so incompetent, irresponsible and undeserving.",0,3,1,Richard K.,"New Hyde Park, NY",6,22,35
2.0,7/30/2012,"I'm going to be honest and to the point.... I enjoyed the staff and the environment. But I was not impressed regarding the porterhouse steak for two. The steak is advertised as dry aged, but it wasn't as tender as expected. The fries and sauteed spinach were tasty and the mussels were a nice appetizer. But if you want a properly aged steak try Ben and Jacks in manhattan which would run you the same amount and if your on a budget and in jersey goto arthur's tavern..for $20+ you can get a rib eye so juicy..so delicious that you would shake your head at the thought of what you spent at Mark Joseph..",1,1,1,Patricia F.,"Budd Lake, Mount Olive Township, NJ",101,112,699

4.0,6/17/2012,"My first time here, my wife and I got the steak for two (porterhouse). It comes out on a sizzling hot plate, cooked a little under from what you ordered. The plate is so hot that you literally finish cooking the slices to your liking right on the plate. Now, this is tradition in the spirit of Luger's, and it is cool from a theatrical perspective, but not cool for other reasons. I am not a fan of it. Why, you ask? The meat has not had a chance to rest when it is sliced. This creates a pool of blood/juices under the steak that ruins the crisp texture of the bottom while draining it of moisture, rendering the meat dry if you don't scarf it down ASAP. It tasted good enough though, so there's that. The second trip, I went with the ribeye to truly test Mark Joseph's meddle. It was good. Crispy outer edges and crust - perfectly cooked - well rested, well seasoned.For a full steakhouse review based on 10 categories and a 100-point scoring system, go to my site",3,2,2,JohnnyPrimeC.

5.0,5/28/2012,"This is more of a low-key steakhouse, in my opinion, and that is what makes it one of my top two in NY. Why? Well, the food, to put it simply. Nobody else does SEAFOOD as well as these guys,(my girl got the ""Panko Tuna,"" whatever 'Panko' is), and I swear to the gods of steak, it tasted as rich and comparatively soft as the filet mignon I took for myself. Before I go on, our service was way beyond the ordinary steakhouse stuff, and this was important, because this guy was a tourguide through the night for us. I think his name was Dan or Dave or Doug. Whatever, he was funny and didn't push anything on us. Place was busy and he came back twice just to see if we had any questions. Anyway, my girl doesn't get into steak a lot, and I heard these guys covered Sea Bass well, so we went, and Dan says something like ""remember that tuna thing I was rambling about before? Awesome."" So, ok, we didn't know much about seabass anyway.I order the filet, and he asks us for small or the bigger one. Folks, the ""petit filet"" in this place is 12 ounces! The other one is a POUND. So, select wisely.So we ordered. Dan suggested the sea scallops as an appetizer for my lady, and I got the calamari. Hot, crisp outside, BIG chunks of squid, ok? We could have split it and been ok. But the scallops! Big, Good bite, have to cut them, and no way these things(3) ever spent a moment  in a freezer anywhere. Sauce was drizzled and complex, (mostly butter), but wow.Ok, steak time. I had the ""small"" filet  medium rare. Dan recommended we butterfly, but no, I like my cow intact, thanks. And it was. Perfect slightly charred outside, andtender within, but here's the best part--nothing raw in the middle, just more and moreand maybe I should have gone for the pound, I don't know.The tuna panko was a surprise to me. Janey was in heaven. I've done three steakhouses in NY, and this was surprising. Crusty, and just so good.It's weird to talk about seafood in a steakhouse, but it's not like these guys have a lot of the stuff. Salmon, seabass, and tuna. And shrimp appetizers etc.We're coming back for the porterhouse. I didn't realize they have a porterhouse for just one person. It looks, on the menu, like it starts with two people(for $88!), and just gets bigger. I'm a ribeye guy, so I may just stop by for lunch someday.No desert. We were done. Filled. Happy.

2.0,2/19/2012,"i actually came here a few months back and forgot to review this place.  what inspired me to review it was the fact that i found a week old skirt  steak in my fridge that my mom bought which i quickly prepared with a quick mustard, cream sauce.  it was really really tasty.  tender.  juicy.and then i thought to myself, it was BETTER than the steak from MarkJoseph Steakhouse.me and my friends talked about going to a legit steakhouse for weeks, as we never went to one.  after much research, we decided to come here.  we all expected the meat to just melt in our mouths.  it did not.  it was pretty tough and pretty dry.  very chewy.  my mouth hurt just having to eat the thing.O, and very good point i think.  even before the steak came out, i was telling my friends a good, legit steak shouldn't need any sauce to eat, just salt, pepper and maybe some butter should be enough.  i was somewhat embarrassed because i couldn't eat this thing UNLESS i dunked the pieces of meat in their steak/tarter sauce.  i wanted to eat it clean, i couldn't.  it just wasnt good enough.was it bad?  no, not at all.  but it certainly was not what we expected.  we all agreed that the steak was O.K. at best.  and yes, we did get medium rare.everything else was great - superb.  our waiter was very friendly, the pork belly was amazing.  the steak fries were probably some of the best fries i've ever eaten in my life.  the pasta was solid.  the desserts were solid.one other note, we did NOT like the creamed spinach.  i will give the benefit of the doubt to the restaurant because that was the first time ive ever eaten creamed spinach outside of boston market.  and if you're rolling your eyes and bashing boston market creamed spinach, thats probably because you've never had boston market creamed spinach; its amazing.  as are most of their sides.i found it to be very very bland.  virtually no saltiness.  the texture was fine, but there was NO taste to it.  it tasted like creamy, spinachy, WATER.again, is that was its 'supposed' to taste like?  i hope not....overall, the experience was a good one.  we all enjoyed our time and overall the meal was great.BUT, if i were to decide to drop that much cash for a steak again, i would NEVER come here again.  i would definitely go and try peter lugers.",1,0,0,Jake R.,"New York, NY",1,113,3
2.0,2/12/2012,"This is a hearbreaking review for me to write because as anyone who's seen my other reviews can attest, I don't like writing ""bad"" reviews.  I try to find the best in every place I go to but MarkJoseph really made me work to squeeze the ""good"" out from a whole lot of bad.I joined a group of friends here for Restaurant Week and things began very well.  We were served tasty rolls with butter up front and they were very patient with us as the last member of our party was a bit late.  Our waters were loaded up quickly and drink orders were taken promptly.  So far so good.The waitress came over and took our orders efficiently and politely.  When our appetizers arrived there was a general gasp of appreciation as several sizzling Canadian Bacon strips were laid before us.  This chunk of pork was glorious.  It was sizzling, nice grill lines on it and it was wonderfully salty and sweet all at the same time.  It was so salty in some parts that I needed bread to go with it - heavenly.One thing the bacon did was make me thirsty, and I finished up my Diet Coke and glass of water in the process.  Our entrees (including my 20 oz sirloin) arrived right after our appetizers had been polished off - perfect timing.  The steak came sizzling and pre-sliced - awesome!  We were served and sides were distributed.This is about where things fell apart.  The steak was glorious, so for a brief period I was in steak heaven.  The crust was beautiful, the meat perfectly medium rare and it had great flavor thanks to the butter melted on top and seasoning.  Then I looked down to try my mashed potatoes and spinach sides and realized - I didn't have them.  I waved our waitress down and she came over.  I told her we were shorted sides and she stood there, counting all the servings on the table.  Um...am I really going to lie about a tiny (about a 1/2 cup) serving of potato and spinach?  She finally decided I wasn't lying and brought it over.  I tried them and good lord...I've tasted better potatoes made from instant mash mix with a grainy texture and the spinach was bland.  Then I went to take a drink of water and noticed I had none left.  I tried to wave someone over but the wait staff had disappeared.  I soldiered on and gobbled down my steak, still enjoying it but not loving the lack of beverages.  I didn't even finish the sides, that's how bland they were.The time for dessert came and I finally got my water refilled.  Our desserts were quickly thrown into the table and the waiters ran away as if they had just lobbed a grenade at us.  Now, in the history of all dessert services I've been to including diners, greasy spoons or Le Cirque, I've always been asked if I wanted coffee or tea with dessert.  I looked around waiting for our waitress to appear and ask...nothing.  I tried to find a waitstaff member.  I did wave at one point and as soundly ignored.  I finally shrugged and decided the water was enough.So I bit into the cheesecake.  I felt nothing.  It literally felt like I was eating a chunk of creamy nothingness.  I thought maybe there was more too it.  Another bite, and more nothingness.  I asked others at the table if theirs was the same and there was agreement around the table.   So here, let me list a few places where I've had better cheesecake than this:1. Vienero's2. Ferrara's3. Costco4. Pathmark5. My mom's kitchenI think you get the idea.While all of the wait service was abysmal, I do have to give credit to the hostess who worked with my friend when her credit card had some issues.  Very good service on that front.For the money (even with a Restaurant Week menu) this experience just wasn't worth it.  The Canadian Bacon was great, the steak was fantastic - but I could get these things elsewhere with much better service.",7,5,5,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",393,1298,917
3.0,2/12/2012,"Along a historic looking part of Water Street, you'll find MarkJoseph Steakhouse. And not much else as the area by Peck Slip seems vast, unoccupied and perfect for dumping bodies into the east river. (Ok, so Meade's bar is in the area but still, a rather sparsely populated area on a Friday night).An owner of MarkJoseph used to be a general manager at Peter Luger so there is definitely a streak of steak experience in this establishment's DNA.Unlike other places that require a full round up of guests before seating, MarkJoseph let us occupy our round table for nine as we each filed in. It's too bad Yelp doesn't feature a timeline slider of sorts as the performance of the service at MarkJoseph varies from start to end of our dinner. Starting at Time A we were in a pristine state of good service, a primordial garden of eating. By the arrival of our main courses and exclusion of a friend's sides, the first seeds of doubt were sown. Moving along, with other guests not having their water glasses refilled or tea/coffee service offered, the Fall from grace had fully completed as we exited with a new awareness of good and bad service, all during the same meal.Fortunately, turning to the food doesn't make this a case of the good, the bad and the ugly: casting aside comments on the miniscule sides (About a tablespoonful of mashed potatoes), my steak was quite good.Salvation through steak, ,indeed with a helping hand from bacon. As advertised on the restaurant week menu, I started with ""sizzling canadian bacon"". And it was as described, sizzling, thick cut and undeniably Canadian (all that was missing was its arrival shaped like a maple leaf).A few more strips of this bacon and I'd have been full but I had my eyes set on a 20 ounce sirloin.Also sizzling upon arrival, the sirloin was ordered medium and appeared a little closer to medium rare but I didn't mind. Pre-sliced, which appeals to my laziness, the bites were tender and delicious. I was a bit perplexed by the MarkJoseph steak sauce which was tangy and tomato centric, almost like a cocktail sauce. The steak can stand by itself without any saucing.Restaurant week steaks required a $5 and $10 supplemental charge, respectively, for filet mignon or sirloin. If you have space left over after a large slab of sliced steak, every dessert is served with cream. Mit schlag!So lactose intolerant friends, beware: cheesecake...with cream. Ice cream...with cream. You get the idea. The cheesecake was neither sacred nor profane, residing in the zone of culinary purgatory.

I came here for restaurant week dinner at 8 and the place was half empty, not necessarily bad given how they close at 9:30, but that should have been the first sign. The bacon appetizer was tough and tasted as though it'd been under a heat lamp for hours. While my filet mignon was tender, the accompanying sides of creamed spinach and mashed potato were ordinary. The cheesecake had an awkward texture and I didn't care to finish it. Our drinks were on the weaker side, and the amaretto sour on the rocks may as well have been an amaretto sour in a quarry for all the ice there was.Our waiter for the night just seemed very uninterested and distant, and we had a hard time tracking him down for anything. The only time he was prompt was with the check! The only saving grace was the busser who was much more attentive to our requests.Even with restaurant week prices ($35 a person plus supplements for the filet mignon and sirloin), 2 drinks, and a $50 giftcard on top of that-- I felt it was too expensive for the poor food and experience.

3.0,1/7/2012,"Meh.  I thought the food was good, not great.  I'm shocked by the way some of the reviewers here raved about this place.  For me, the most important thing about a steakhouse is the steak itself.  If I don't find myself dreaming about it later then something was definitely missing.  I will not be dreaming about this steak anytime soon!  I split the porterhouse for two with a friend.  It was good quality meat but they didn't really do anything with it.  Steak sauce should be something optional that you add not a necessity.  I couldn't eat this steak without sauce.  I actually felt the need to have sauce on every piece.  Once I did that it was good but I shouldn't have to do that to enjoy a steak at a high end NY steakhouse.  The fried calamari was slightly chewy.  The bacon was excellent but I don't think I could have had more than a few bites of it.  The spinach and potatoes were great.  Our waiter Mike (At least that's what my cc receipt says his name was - I don't remember.  Sorry!) was phenomenal.  I would like to take him and have him be my waiter at a better restaurant!!  The biggest plus might have been that this was cheaper than a typical steakhouse so I didn't feel as badly about spending a ton of money on a good but not fantastic meal.",0,0,0,Abbe K.,"New York, NY",2,40,0
1.0,1/1/2012,"This restaurant gets zero stars because the food and management falls way short.  Overall, it was a very disappointing experience eating at this restaurant - total waste of time and money.  There are better choices out there if you are willing to venture out of the financial district.The food was ok (not great) and the decor seems to flow well, but it is nowhere close in the quality department with that of Peter Luger's.  They need to invest in better beef or even better, age their meats properly before being served.  Service was good by an attentive server. You cannot possibly compare the two steakhouses.  There is a reason why the latter one has been rated #1 in NYC by zagat for the past decade.  When you offer quality products with a respectful staff to back it up, you get a great reputation for having satisfied customers.  It would be nice if management started focusing more on the quality of the food and staff, rather than being mainly money driven.  Long term success comes with customer satisfaction.",1,0,0,Jay J.,"New York, NY",0,45,0
5.0,12/23/2011,"MARKJOSEPH'S STEAKS HIT THE MARK!A few weeks ago I was ordering lunch with a couple of co-workers when we were trying to come to a consensus of the right place to order a steak sandwich. Several places came to mind, but we knew there was one steakhouses in FiDi that existed beyond the realm of Seamless Web. We've ordered from Delmonico's, Harry's, Les Halles, and Bobby Van's many times and everyone of them is good in their own right. But there was one steakhouse in the area that was almost mythical as it was NOT available on Seamless and it would require that I *gasp* pay for it myself and go out of pocket. One of the few perks from my job is that when we're working past 8:00PM we an order dinner, courtesy of the company. So if ain't on Seamless, then I'm probably not eating it. But on the rare occasion a miracle happens ... management drops a card and we all order lunch on them. Well, this is not going to happen again for a long while so we did it right. After finishing my sandwich, my co-workers asked me what I thought of it compared to the ones which we have had at other places in the area. I was so blown away by the quality of the steak that all I could say was: ""MarkJoseph is now the new standard how a steak sandwich is done."" And all of the other steakhouse owners bent knee before their new king.So when it came time for planning my team's 2011 Holiday Dinner, I knew of no better place in the FiDi/Seaport vicinity. Our reservations were set for 7:30PM and although our table was ready for us when we got in, we decided to have a round of drinks at the bar. A nice Tanqueray 10 and Tonic to start the night on the right foot and take the edge off the day. Although this was a one liquor drink, the bartender made it perfectly balanced and with a generous amount of limes. We took our time at the bar and didn't actually request to be seated for a full half hour. We were never pestered by the staff to be seated or give up our table and they gladly transferred our bar tab to our meal check without making it a major issue.To whet our appetites, we certainly did not skimp on the starters. For appetizers we ordered the Tuna Tar Tar, Jumbo Lump Crabcake, and the Fresh Mozzarella and Beefsteak Tomatoes. Both the tuna and the crabcake tasted freshly prepared and had flavorful pools of dipping sauces to drag through. The mozzarella and tomatoes were sliced thick and were lightly drizzled with balsamic vinegar. The appetizers were the perfect amount for the three of us, yet were not overwhelming as the best was yet to come.When dining in a steakhouse, only the biggest and baddest steaks will fit the bill. One member of our group had quickly decided that he would be having the 12 oz. Filet Mignon. Personally, I probably would have ordered the 16 oz. one instead for no other reason than it was 4 oz. bigger! But he was saving room for dessert and planned his order like he was playing a chess match. My other guest and I were torn between the Porterhouse Steak for Two and the Bone-In Ribsteak. The Porterhouse for Two is 40 oz. of bone and beef while each Ribsteak is 24 oz. Some quick math told me that we would be losing a full 8 oz. of beef with this option. But after setting pure gluttony aside, the ultimate deciding factor was that he wanted his meat cooked Medium Well while I preferred mine to be cooked no more than Medium Rare. They say the best kind of compromise is when everyone is equally dissatisfied. But the thought of ordering our steaks Medium was all the convincing that we needed to order up two separate Ribsteaks to each of our desired temperatures.While I can't speak for the others, my steak was cooked a perfect Medium Rare. We has also ordered sides of creamed spinach and mashed potatoes to complement our meals. Each of the major steakhouses in the area has their own house steak sauce. Both MarkJoseph's and Bobby Van's share the title for the best steaksauce in the area. While the steak speaks for itself, their sauce is so good that you can't help but alternate each bite au natural vs. dabbed in their special sauce. Let me repeat, their steaks are USDA Prime Dry Aged beef and have all of their own flavor that they do not require anything else to make them taste their best. But that sauce is so good that I contemplated buying a bottle to bring back to the office.In the end, I had seven bites left on my plate that I could not bring myself to eat. I had the meatsweats for sure, and whether it was seven or seventy bites, this steak had me beat. Maybe next time I'll cut back on the appetizers or just cut out eating for a full 24 hours before our reservations. But the one thing that is for certain is that the next time I sit down at MarkJoseph's I know that I will not rise from my chair until that steak is done. Until that day comes I will have to look back with regret for those last 7 bites that bested me. I cannot wait for the next event which will bring us back to MarkJoseph's to settle this score.",1,1,1,David K.,"Newark, DE",268,198,552
1.0,12/13/2011,"I read the Yelp! reviews and got sucked into thinking that this just might be a good steakhouse, but disappointing does not even come close to the mediocre experience I had...at great expense.First was a decent gin martini.  That was OK and then a basic bread basket.  It was downhill from there on.Reviewers RAVED, yes RAVED about the onion and tomato salad accompanied by the FAMOUS, OMG slab of fried Canadian bacon, so I bit.  With great flourish my waiter landed a plate in front of me consisting of two 3/8 inch slides of tomato and a quarter inch thick slice of raw onion.  I guess not being a New Yorker kept me from fainting at this elaborate, unique, superlative salad so much admired and adored by reviewers.  And yes...on another plate was the OMG to die for slab of bacon, about six inches long and a quarter of an inch thick with a vein of fat running the length of this delectable accompaniment to my FAMOUS salad.  Unfortunately I was not good at Emperor's New Clothes so concluded that the bacon was really a slab of Spam, but not as good as the canned stuff.Oh!  The waiter proudly showed me the famous house salad dressing, which was nothing more than watery tomato sauce mildly flavored with horseradish.  A poor excuse for a cocktail sauce which did absolutely nothing to my salad slabs.I ordered the filet but my waiter insisted that i would like the sirloin better, citing that this was the most flavorful cut they had and that it was the most popular. Against my better judgement and gut feeling, I did the sirloin medium rare.Savoring the intense raw onion flavor flowing wildly around in my mouth I scoped out the other diners, mostly business guys, who seemed to be very focused on their conversation rather than oooooing and ahhhhhing over the food.  I can understand why.The steak arrived on a sizzling platter, cut off of the bone, like the other truly famous steakhouses and the waiter then poured clarified butter on the hunks.  I bit in, I chewed, and I chewed and kept chewing until I realized that this was going to be a lot of work and expense for little satisfaction.This $42 steak was flavorless, tough and nothing more than something to fill my stomach.  How I wish I could have maybe received more satisfaction from the filet, but there was no turning back.So there it was:  a $13 martini, $42 steak, a slab of ""bacon"", two slices of tomato and one slice of raw onion for $71.31 and bad breath that lasted and lasted despite many flossings, bushings and swishes of mouth wash.  Had I ordered a side like spinach or potato the bill would have been over $100.I still cannot reconcile how so many people can be so pleased for so little.",4,4,2,Mitch K.,"Indian Land, SC",154,1087,0

4.0,10/2/2011,"Came here to redeem a Groupon (25 bucks for 50 bucks worth) of food. To avoid spending a gazillion dollars on a steak dinner, my boyfriend and I came for burgers on a friday night.Apparently we were not the only couples with the same idea, as the bar was packed (bar menu only served at bar, btw). We waited for about 10 minutes until we found a table.The hostess saw us waiting for some time and offered us a round of drinks on the house, due to our wait. She seemed to be confused, however, because after she served us our wine, she asked for our reservation name, explaining that she had comped our drinks because she thought we were waiting past our reservation time.After I explained to her that 1. I had called to attempt reservations but was refused because we wanted the bar and 2. We had always wanted to sit at the bar and not at a table, it became awkward. At the end, she was still gracious and still comped our drinks, but it was just awkward.But the burger! Amazing, outrageous, and definitely worth the 14 dollars (with all the french fries that come with it). We started with a caprese salad which showcased the biggest and ripest tomatoes ever.Don't forget--- place is not open on weekends!

3.0,7/27/2011,"Great service, but I'm not convinced that the waitstaff or the chef was trained into making a proper steak.  I ordered medium rare but apparently I should be ordering medium from now on in pricey steakhouses from now on as it is a lot more red than what I'm used to seeing on thinner cuts of beef.  My rib eye was a good 1.5"" thick, quite bloody and a tough tendon right in the center really difficult to cut through.My mom's salmon was cooked thoroughly, but lacked a wow factor for $30.  They even nixed the crispy skin.  Sauteed spinach was boring, needed garlic or something.  What griped me a little was that the waiter insisted on the fact that a medium well steak could not be juicy - a guy ordered on the next table.  Prime cuts of beef has more fat/ marblization than choice or other cuts.  The butter it's cooked in keeps it moist.  The only reason why it would lose it's juiciness is if it is constantly being poked with a thermometer or the cut of beef wasn't up to par.Their sauce was reminiscent of Peter Lugers - got that tangy taste, minus the crabmeat.Other than that, I think there are other steakhouses to try out.",2,0,1,Albert W.,"Brooklyn, NY",201,970,560

3.0,6/29/2011,"*3.5 stars* is what I would've really given this place.-warning- this review might be a little biased since my wallet was in pain after paying the check at this place.FOR THE PRICE, the food wasn't as good as I was hoping it to be. But I had also already read all these raving yelp reviews so I think this is REALLY biased fyi. First, the service was really awesome, they were really friendly to my BF and I even though we obviously look like college students and not fancy enough to be eating at a nice steakhouse like Mark Josephs. Plus I had a groupon and they were still really courteous to us and even asked us after the meal how we enjoyed their restaurant etc etc. (plus I was a little late for my reservation but that was no problem, I was immediately seated regardless)I also noticed that nearly every guy had a polo shirt on, (which I told my BF to wear since I read on yelp that it was dressy). I wore a casual dress (which was a great idea since I would have felt really out of place with my denim short shorts and oversized tshirt that Im wearing atm). If you go, dress up just a little, i.e boys: polo shirt/nice sweater, girls: dressy pants, skirt, dress. (I've only been here once though so that's what I noticed, idk if that's the way it usually is.)AS FOR THE MEAL (finally, I know sorry) First we order three strips of Canadian bacon, which were basically an entree themselves. They were HUGE, I should've only gotten two for the two of us because that basically filled me up. (They let us take the leftovers home though which was great)For the entree we both shared the 16 oz filet mignon and salmon steak, both done medium rare. I thought the filet mignon was pretty good but I agree with a previous yelp reviewer that a good steak shouldn't need the steak sauce, and unfortunately it needed it. But it was really good, I'd say that was the best part of the meal. The salmon steak was very tender and juicy but I felt it was something my mother could have made for much cheaper. On the side we had the creamed spinach which was really tasty. I liked it a lot.No dessert for us since yelp told me not to (and I was getting scared of the check).Overall a really good ONE TIME experience lol. I would come back though if I get a better paying job or something because if I didn't have the groupon, I'd be bawling (again this is biased since I knew it'd be expensive but decided for it anyway).

2.0,2/26/2011,"My 10 year old daughter and I are ticking off the list of top steakhouses in New York when we visit, and this one undeservedly was on it. We had an early reservation on a Friday evening and were seated immediately. Our server was friendly and quickly brought out drinks. My Bombay Sapphire martini was well mixed and dry as it should be. So far, so good. It was at about this point that a table of ""regulars"" was seated close to us, that is when the experience turned sour. Service suddenly became non existent and haughty at best, downright rude at worst. When I am shelling out a significant amount of money for a meal, I expect at minimum a modicum of civility and attentiveness, both of which were exercised on the other table only from the moment they were seated. My daughter ordered a bowl of lobster bisque which arrived at the table with a tepid temperature which would not have been unappetizing were it not for the hidden pockets that were refrigerator cold. The consistency was coarse and grainy and had a distinct fishy taste. The pieces of lobster were rubbery and tasted more like the imitation lobster meat one buys in a supermarket. Very disappointing. We usually order the steak for two (did I mention my daughter can eat?), but on this night we decided on separate cuts. When the steak for two came out sizzling and well prepared for the table of ""regulars"" (10 minutes before our meal, yet they ordered 10 minutes after we did), I knew we had made the wrong choice. The filet my daughter ordered came out exceptional. It was cooked rare with a nice sear on the outside, tender and purple on the inside, flavorful, but no better than Luger's, Benjamin's or Ben and Jack's. The big letdown was my bone in ribeye. I ordered it rare, and when it came to the table, I needed a forensics expert to indeed identify the hulking black mass as a steak. It was charred to the point of being simply burnt, yet the meat inside was prepared unevenly and, in places, raw lending a consistency of cold waxiness to the marbling. I would have sent it back, but I had already reached my limit at this point. The side order of hash browns was unremarkable and hardly worth mention save for the fact that it was starchy and served at room temperature. We have eaten at many excellent steakhouses and remain undaunted after this dispiriting experience. This would have gotten a one star were it not for my daughter's filet.

He asked us what we wanted to drink and made conversation with us. He also mentioned some drinks we might life, fruity cocktails, types of wine. My friend wanted a bellini and he was sweet enough to tell her that he doesn't really make it with peach puree and if she didn't like it he will make her something different. We decided to take our drinks to our table since we were starving. The hostess took us to are table as well as carried our drinks. She was nice. Our waitress was there right away to fill our cups with water and greeted us. She was really sweet. The service was great. They knew we were there for restaurant week and we looked like students of course. But they never treated us badly... Anyway, I ordered the baked clams, filet mignon and ended with the cheesecake. My friends ordered the canadian bacon, and sirloin 20oz steak with the extra 10 dollars and ended with the brooklyn ice cream. The Baked Clams were delicious! I usually don't like clams, but boy did they make these clams good. Loved it. Came with three. I also tried my friends bacon and it was the best bacon I ever had. I also hate bacon. I believe its 90 percent fat and 10 percent meat. But that was not the case. The THICK cut bacon was cooked to perfection and it was so good with their famous MarkJoseph's steak sauce. Yum! I got my Filet Mignon medium. It was so good. You can taste the quality of the meat. The mashed potatoes and creamed spinach complimented the meat very well. My friends sirloin was good as well. It was HUGE! They had to take it off the hot plate so it would stop cooking. SO order a bit more rare if you get this. I'm not a big fan of the sirloin because it was kind of fatty. Not my style.And for dessert. Hello cheesecake. Nothing special. I could have passed on the cheesecake. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't fantastic either. BUT THE ICE CREAM. It was heaven. Brooklyn ice cream IS HEAVEN. I highly recommend the chocolate ice cream. The huge scoop of whipped cream kind of bothered me, but it didn't ruin the taste of the ice cream. Haha.

5.0,9/25/2010,"When perusing through my bookmarked reviews, one solid gem stands out as my all-time favorite ""special occasion/high-end/fancy/expensive"" night out. I've been here only twice: in '07 & '09 - once with my fraternity group of about 20, and once for a romantic dinner with the lucky lady...But I long for it frequently. Those succulent slabs of steak haunt my dreams. A journey through the menu of sides is an exercise in ecstasy. The garlic spinach - so fresh - i don't care if you might give me the runs! Bacon - sizzling hot like a yelp complement, it caresses each and every PART of my mouth and i just hope I can chew on it all night. ""Keep my steak warm,"" i think to tell the waiter as i pray each bite's flavor lasts longer than a piece of Stride Gum. Bring it, caprese salad! Even you, oh simplistic salad-wannabe, even you satisfy with unconventionally large hunks of mozzarella lying coyly and seductively inside a daisychain of beefsteak tomato ménages à trois. Onions and mushrooms - only my MOM's recipe could compete with such vegetable wizardry! if this was Salem, they would surely be burned at the ""steak."" (OOOh that was so bad it was good!)And finally their masterwork arrives.  And you will enjoy it, my friends. And you will end up converting to a new temple of tenderloin. I could dazzle you -like i love to do- with how the steak, arriving in it's own bubbling, sunset-colored juices, bends to the will of your teeth like a palm to a Tempurpedic pillow. After the attack, it's like rowing oars through calm waters. Your teeth are literally overkill for a steak this juicy, tender, and perfectly prepared to your liking. But I'm gonna stop there, because a masterful Operetta is meaningless without hearing it for yourself. So it goes with a truly great steak - do what you must to taste their (Porterhouse for two) steak for yourself.I think this is New York's most underrated and practically hidden gem.

My gf thinks the sirloin was juicy but rough. The filet of course was the better side and it tasted fine for me. We ordered the Porter house for two and it was quite filling. The sides we got were the Canadian bacon was really thick and good but wasn't worth the $3.95 and we also ordered the cream of spinach and that was good too.Chad mentioned in his review the butter was cold and it was. I don't know why since the bread wasn't hot at all. I would want my butter to melt on the bread. The funny thing happened. When they served the bacon the server gave us two serving spoons and left. We were thinking how in the hell are we going to serve the bacon with two spoons exactly. Upon asking the next waiter he stated that the server should have cut the bacon for us and server the bacon to us using the two spoon method of serving. Well I guess that server felt he wasn't going to serve us. Again, I feel that a great steak shouldn't need sauce when eatten by a true steak person because that will defeat the point of a good steak atleast.

4.0,5/14/2008,"How to do lunch for six at Mark Joseph without angering the higher ups that have mercilessly held you to a $50 per head expense limit?  Not trivial, friends.  It takes some work, some planning, and some consultation with all of the parties attending to make sure there is careful optimization between meat, sides, and drinks.  You need a plan and you need to stick to it.  Really, for all the time that goes into making this work, everyone would be better off if we just went back to the good old days of ""$60"" per head, where $60 means ""eat and drink whatever you want, wherever you want, because nobody actually cares or is checking.""  But I digress.The first question to ask in planning the $50 meal is whether you want to do drinks or not.  If you do, that probably means a little less food.  Now, if you're in my situation, and there are no waifish girls or vegetarians coming along, it's probably best to skip the beers in favor of more food.  Our plan broke down this way:- Bacon appetizers around- Porterhouse steak for four (prepare for some skepticism from the slightly irritable heavyset waiter)- Sides of spinach, broccoli, hashbrowns, mushrooms, and fries- Skipped the beverages, though probably could have gotten away with non-alcoholic optionsThe bacon is a wonder to behold on several levels.  First off, it's a slab of bacon that's maybe six to eight inches long and perhaps a half inch thick, still simmering in its own grease on your plate.  Dig in.  It's delicious.  Nicely salted, nicely cooked, this is the glorious flavor of bacon (which seems to improve anything) writ large.  Here's another Protip: the bacon is $3.95.  Now, granted, after consuming a 5000 calorie slice of bacon, you might be concerned about the prudence of eating the forthcoming array of food.  Or even your ability to do so.  But trust me, it's worth it.  In fact, I'm sort of tempted to go down and just order four bacon appetizers, keep the water refills coming thanks, and call it a lunch for under $20.  I'm afraid that the waiter might stab me in the back with that huge knife though and even if I did make it out alive (and hopefully without being blacklisted), I'd probably suffer catastrophic heart failure shortly thereafter.The waiter did express some derisive concern about serving six people with the four person porterhouse, although he conceded that some sides might help out.  Trust me, even with six pretty hungry guys, especially at lunch, you're not going to be wanting for food.  The enormous porterhouse comes out, as others have said, sizzling in its own delicious grease.  The medium-rare treatment was perfect and the steak, perhaps four inches thick, was nicely seared and lightly seasoned.  When the waiter cuts the thing up and starts serving you, it's important not to get anxious.  First, you'll probably anger the man, which is bad.  Second, you want to make sure that he has some time to ladle some of the grease out of the pan and onto your meat.  After all, you're paying for that grease.  The steak was quite good, for the aforementioned reasons, and it's difficult to complain about any aspect in particular.  At $164 for the four person monstrosity, you're certainly paying for some serious meat.  I've had better steak, to be sure, but this is excellent meat.Meat out of the way, the sides are important if you're trying to keep costs out of the stratosphere while filling your stomach.  The spinach is serviceable, but not remarkable.  I tend to think that some additional seasonings or cheese would give it a bit more.  While the spinach was good, it was a little underwhelming all things considered.  The spinach side at Del Frisco's is considerably better.  The broccoli is just steamed broccoli, which is a little hard to get worked up over.  But I think there was some additional flavor in there (or maybe that was just from the meat flavor left in my mouth, I don't know) that was good.  If you need a little greenery and don't want to completely overwhelm your digestive system, the broccoli is a good call.  Sauted mushrooms were very good.  Nothing fancy, but the flavor complements the meat well.  The fries were good, they're nicely crisped on the outside, almost like they're battered, but that's just the seasoning.  Above average fries, as fries go, but they're still just deep fried potatoes.  The hash browns were very good.  Well crisped and perhaps most importantly for hash browns, they were brown  There's nothing more irritating than ordering hash browns and getting some soggy, greasy mess of potatoes that don't even have a nice crunchiness to them.  So those are a good call.  For the appetizers, I'd put priority on the hash browns and mushrooms, then go with the broccoli and the fries, and put spinach last.Total plus tax and tip?  About $290.  Have another side of bacon.",2,3,3,Andrew M.,"New York, NY",2,19,0

The apps are the usual and great, jumbo shrimp, thick cut bacon, tomatoes & onion but the 'baby lam chops' are unique and simply great. The porterhouse is good, thick and pink. The side dishes were good but unimaginative. Creamed spinach that 'did the job'  and the bernaise was too oily and not 'bernaisy' enough. The hash browns came out right- burnt. The deserts were also unimaginative. They didn't offer creme brulee, one of my favorites. Oh well, they did have my bourbon, so all was well..A great local steakhouse but not on the same level as Striphouse or Lugers..",2,0,1,Jay G.,"New York, NY",18,322,372
4.0,1/9/2007,"Came here for a special big night with friends and had a really nice time. Good atmosphere (you kinda feel like you've found some secret place) and they handled a group of about 15 easily. I've been to a lot of good steakhouses in a bunch of different cities and I thought this was a very good pick. My rib eye was cooked well and flavorful. The side dishes were excellent and the wine list was extensive. Impressive place, even now a year and a half later.",2,0,1,Jack C.,"San Francisco, CA",256,48,4
5.0,12/24/2006,"This is my favorite steak house in NYC.  It's little hard to get to but it's worth the trip.  The restaurant almost seems like it's out of place, but it's nicely hidden and away from tourists hangouts.  There are many local wall streeters and power brokers, and I think we were the only family group in the restaurant.  I was told that this place was started by the folks who used to work at Peter Lugers, and hence the similar menu.Their clams on a half shell is very good (my wife's favorite, and she doesn't even like clams) and other appetizers are also good.We ordered steak for two and a ribeye and they were all fantastic. Dry-aged to perfection.  Tender and juicy ..... (oh so good).   We sat by the large window near the entrance and I could see the whole dining area, and most of the faces I saw had a big grin or a smile as they chowed down on their meat.  The restaurant can be little intimidating for a family since so many businessmen present but if you don't mind that, I say go to Mark Joseph.During a nice summer night, it's also a beautiful view just outside the restaurant.Bon Appetit!",2,0,1,YJ H.,"Pleasanton, CA",8,65,2
4.0,11/15/2006,"Sometimes you don't need all that fancy stuff to enjoy a meal. Sure it's pricey, but here you are paying for quality of food. Everything else is secondary. Rumor has it that this establishment is owned by a Peter Luger expat, and whether or not that's correct, the truth is, this place knows how to make a great steak!Nestled among the cobblestones of downtown, a five minute walk from the Seaport, the place puts out a delicious and juicy porterhouse. The decor is strictly old steakhouse feel, but pleasant enough for an anniversary celebration. The Steak for Two is gigantic, with plenty left over for a sandwich at home. The lobster bisque is quite good, as are the seafood appetizers. When I think great steak, this place immediately comes to mind. Insiders' tip: Skip the desserts and walk across the street to Pier 17 to enjoy ice cream and the view.",4,0,1,Lisa F.,"New York, NY",129,426,29
5.0,9/22/2006,"I've only been here for lunch and I've only had their steak sandwich but I've had it twice in a row.  Oh good lordy, this is a great sandwich.  You have the steak done the way you like.  Not sure what cut it is, but it sure is tender.  The fries compliment it very well... steak fries, that is.You must, must try this place if you're in the South Street Seaport area.My coworkers have had their burgers and they look huge.Lunch menu prices aren't cheap.  Plan on spending about $20 a head for lunch including a regular drink.",2,0,1,Maome S.,"Emerson, NJ",28,209,4
4.0,4/18/2006,"Nothing against Mark Joseph's steak, but when your favorite dish is the bacon appetizer, then you have to wonder if the high priced steak is worth the cost. Don't get me wrong, the steak is lightly seasoned (the way a steak should be flavored) and amazingly tender but there are plenty of steakhouses that offer comparable quality. The one dish that stuck out in my mind however, and keeps me coming back, is the bacon appetizer. A nice thick cut slab of bacon, sizzling and oh so delicious!",0,0,0,M L.,"New York, NY",26,102,0
