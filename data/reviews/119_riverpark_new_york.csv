5.0,4/25/2019,"A perfect place for a nice date, especially in the summer outside, or a nice place for a meal with the family. Food is scrumptious, service is absolutely excellent.

5.0,4/24/2019,Sunday Funday Easter Brunch Day. Outstanding experience. Easter was a prix-Fixe menu. I chose the Quiche and Roasted Branzino. Right away you are served a gorgeous selection of pastries. Piping hot. Just wonderful. The quiche was a solid choice as was the Branzino. Perfectly cooked Crispy skin. My only complaint of the day was the grain in the base of the dish was quite bland and a tad overcooked as it was mushy in a watery sort of way. To finish the meal you must try the milk and cereal dessert (donate a portion to charity!) and the passionfruit and black sesame dessert blew my mind. Really excellent. It goes without saying the view of east river is just spectacular. The ambiance is relaxing and classy inside. There was live jazz and a round of applause to their team for outstanding service. Definitely will be back to try out the evening menu.,0,0,0,Helen C.,"New York, NY",92,71,123
5.0,4/15/2019,Very spacious interior with seatings inside and outside the restaurant. I sat inside near the see through clear glass walls. Gorgeous view of the east river. Seatings were well spread. I felt my privacy. Elegant place. They had live jazz when I went. The food was just acceptable. The comfortness of this place makes up for the food. So I still give it a 5.,0,0,0,Laurence E.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,7,40
3.0,4/5/2019,"Beautiful scenic location. Friendly and helpful staff. Weekday lunch was ok but my burger was nothing special and the fries were over cooked and quite dry and tasteless. Enough gluten-free options to make my wife happy and her steak was cooked perfectly, nicely seasoned, and very reasonably priced.

1.0,2/20/2019,"This review will hurt/change your feelings about this place. This is not for the weak hearted or the people who take things anal. This restaurant is on my list of top rated ""garbage, not to ever go again"" restaurants in NYC. 1. The food was absolutely terrible. There were 8 guests that attended the gathering and all 8 people hated their entree. That alone should speak volume.2. The portions of every meal was as big as a happy meal. If anything, you get more food in happy meal that you would get in this establishment. NOTHING ON THE MENU CAN BE CHANGED. So if you want chicken added to your pasta, that would not happen. 3. The food was absolutely awful. Their pasta tasted like food you would get served on Rikers Island. Since they would not add chicken into the pasta, other fellow guest ordered the spiced chicken to add into their bland tasting pasta. Oh boy, did we all make the hugest mistake of our lives. The chicken by far was the WORST NON-TASTEFUL CHICKEN I HAVE EVER TASTED IN MY LIFE. NO FLAVOR, NO TASTE, straight up garbage. We all thought hey, we all have pasta let's just order the chicken and add it on top, maybe it'll give it more flavor and a better taste. Oh boy did we made second biggest mistake there. I wouldn't poison my worst enemies with this garbage food. 4. NOW THIS IS THE BIGGEST OF IT ALL. The bill came out to $315 and some change, 7 people split the bill evenly. Due to their lack of service and their poor tasteless meals, it affected on how much tip we had given them. THE MANAGER had the nerve to stop me and a few of my guest, and say we didn't pay the bill in full but they will comp whatever was not paid. Now listen, I been living in NYC my whole life. No way in hell would any restaurant let any party leave if there was a balance of $85.00 dollars left to be paid, NOBODY. The manager had actually messaged me and it's quite disgusting how he indirectly he said I couldn't ""afford"" the food when in reality I make more than the owner of the establishment. Now my card had declined yes due to my card being highly sensitive to fraud, so when it didn't recognize the transaction of course my bank declined it (my bank was trying to save me from this trash). But I easily quickpayed my friend and he put it on his card with no issues. What is absolutely disgusting is the manager had the nerve to indirectly say we was not able to afford the dinner. He also was more concerned about what bmw I was driving and what Rolex I was wearing, when in all reality he could've used that energy and made sure our meals were satisfying and that would've resulted in a larger tip, Instead of lying to our faces saying we didn't pay the bill and he was actually mad that we didn't tip as well for a large party. 5. And finally the best for last. As my party was seated, there was a White male in another party of 10+ staring at me and my guest the whole entire time. Every time I'd look right or left he would be staring. Now, where I'm from if another male stares at another male up and down non stop, that is considered ""homo"" or ""gay"". It was the most awkward weirdest experience I've ever dealt with. The customer had the nerve to message me and say the guest I was with were escorts and if we didn't have high paid escorts with our ponytails and fancy jackets we would be able to afford a meal across the street. Listen buddy if your reading this. You are are a low life. It's very unfortunate that this is how our night went. Everybody was so hungry that we quickly went to Tao and made up for the lost meal and time we will not get back. If the owner of this establishment is reading this, you need to fire your chef, he does not know how to cook. And you need a manager more concerned about his customers on hand instead of watching what they wear and what they drive. I do not recommend this restaurant to anybody who may be considering on coming here. It is a hassle alone to get there, so why go through all of that to eat garbage. Save your money, save your time, save your guest. It's not worth it. THIS RESTAURANT TRIED TAKING DOWN MY REVIEW TWICE BUT THE TRUTH HURTS ALL MY FELLOW YELPERS TRUST ME AND STAY AWAY !!!You have clowns like Anna, judging me by my profile picture. You shouldn't speak on a watch you can't afford nor does anybody CARE about what you have to say. The only person who is whining here is you about my honest review. If I can't give my honest review than what is yelp for ? There's multiple people who rated this place 3 stars and below. She talks about being with classy people, however she can't happen to mind her business. Classy people do not get messy honey, so sit down. Nobody cares how many times you went there to blow the manager sweetheart, you need go get tested. And honey, the whole staff said that it's family portion, but came out with dog food bowls of food. Stop it, stop lying, clearly your one of the customers who took my review anally, move on.",8,8,2,Akib R.,"Manhattan, NY",337,8,9
1.0,2/19/2019,"Two words: PAID REVIEWS. If you're born and bred in New York, you know this is a city of culinary inspiration. Whether you're enjoying Mediterranean, Thai or Italian - there is an unspoken standard for what we expect. Riverpark does not meet those expectations. If you like over-salted, under seasoned, minimal food plated with some finesse, this place is for you. While the decor is beautiful, the restaurant seems to rest on its lighting fixture to do the job that the food should do. Be wary when ordering the fish - while the fish seems fresh, the seasoning is lackluster with the exception of a heap of salt - this is consistent with 2 visits here. I would suggest any Greek restaurant for whole fish instead. In regards to the pasta- I have had more flavorful at quick service restaurants like Vapiano's. The pastas are underwhelming and taste of stale butter - the kind that's been left in the fridge open too long. While the food is definitely off putting - the runners and servers were kind and efficient. Any POC will know however, that while the management here hires plenty of people of color for back of house work, for the obvious reasons, they still do not understand the intricacies of prejudice and discrimination as we experience it. All in all - do not trust this establishment with your taste, or your food preferences. And do not trust the reviews that come from the owners/friends and family of management.",5,5,4,Rahnama F.,"Long Island City, NY",276,20,65
5.0,2/18/2019,"Riverpark will exceed all of your expectations!! It is not just a nice view - the entire atmosphere here is incredible. The staff are super friendly and very professional and courteous at what they do. The food is delicious and the drinks are equally amazing. The manager Julie came to check on our table and she was exceptional!! She took great care of us for the rest of the night and we never found ourselves waiting for service. She, as well as the rest of the staff, truly made our dinner a one of a kind experience.

5.0,2/17/2019,Valentines dinner was an absolute delight at riverpark. The crab risotto was delicious and the entire restaurant atmosphere was great.

5.0,2/17/2019,"People who hate on this place are full of it. Why? Because we ALL know the customer isn't always right. Take the guy who wrote the salty review trashing the place on 2/16. Bruh, no one cares about your pic of an ugly Rolex you tried on at 6 ave. The restaurant certainly isn't a 1-star place, that's biased af.Making stupid demands, ordering stuff not on the menu, trying to split an entree 3 ways, etc. All that nonsense needs to stop. If you can't dine and eat here like a civilized human being, go to Chipotle or McDonald's, ain't nobody got time for your nonsense. Gordon Ramsay would've thrown you out no problem. You know why the place has overwhelmingly positive reviews throughout the year? Because it's their standard. You know what that means? It's not them, it's you and your annoying table of 8.I've been here over 10 times (dinner and lunch) and service has always been exemplary. If they make a mistake, they'll acknowledge it and fix it for you. People going to places and blaming the menu for not having what you want exactly is beyond irrational. That's like going to Italian restaurant, asking for guac, then crying cause they don't have it. Google or a phone call beforehand would answer most of the stupid issues people have. Drinks, appetizers, entrees and desserts have always been on point. Even when it's off, they'll take it back and fire up a new one no problem. Regardless, if less of those 1-star reviewers stop coming, good, I'd rather eat dinner with classy people and not hear you whining all night.",5,5,5,Anna K.,"New York, NY",2,66,50
1.0,2/17/2019,"Customer service from the waiters were cool, manager was a bit rude but screw all that let's talk about what's really going on here....If you're a vegetarian this place MIGHT be for you but if you're picky then you're out of luck with this place. The menu is fixed and you cannot switch out or customize anything, so be careful if you're allergic to certain foods. The food was subpar to me but the drink menu is pretty good. Just please look up the food selection before attending this venue. Also the parking is a bit tricky to find so be careful, don't park in the lower level parking lot and be sure to validate your ticket that you receive from the parking attendant with the restaurant manager to save you some cash on the parking fee.Also, for the people that keep commenting on the Rolex watches we wore, if you can't afford one stop bringing it up. I'm a civilized person and I'm trying not to judge anyone that was around me at that restaurant. I was just focused on trying to have a good night with my party and based on what I wore, it was over 20k worth. The reviews directed at me and two other guests from my party, it seems like the ""classy people"" that go there will sit around and judge others while being there. Be careful with the people that profile you when attending this place. They will judge you from your skin color to the clothing and jewelry you wear.",4,5,5,Carl H.,"Queens, Queens, NY",2,3,0
1.0,2/16/2019,"Came here for a dinner party for 8, everyone was upset with their entrees except the birthday boy trying to be optimistic. TIP: YOU CANNOT MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO AN ENTREEI have never been to a restaurant where it was a problem to take out squid from a pasta dish or add chicken to a pasta dish originally with no meat 4 of us had the Pasta dish: Farrotto, Roasted Mushrooms, Thyme, Parmesan. Some of us wanted chicken added but they really could not do it.... no accommodations to any dish whatsoever, and one waiter (don't know his name) really seemed annoyed by our questions of substitution and confusion about the menu. He was really yelling and hurrying us instead of calmly telling us like a waiter should. My boyfriend and I shared the larger entree since they said it was good for 2 people.... it was not nearly enough for me and I am 5'4 and I weigh 114 lbs (usually anything fills me up). After saving our appetites the whole day we were not full with the dissatisfying dinner but did not have the heart to order more off their menu, just the price of it, $28 for a pasta dish that was not even slightly adjusted for our taste was NOT worth it. 3 other people ordered the Spiced-Grilled Chicken and let me tell you it was the furthest thing from spiced, they all said it was bland and I had a taste myself and agreed 100%.Only 1 of us had the Caramelized Onion Soup and only a spoon of it was tasted and given right back, it tasted like straight oil. Instead of the staff asking what's wrong with the soup right then and there like HELLO $16 for soup that's not been touched and being sent right back they haggle us after paying and not leaving enough tip and actually accusing us of not paying $85 out of a $315 bill when 4 credit cards were given plus cash. EXTREMELY RUDE MANAGER.The decor is the only thing that makes us for it and the fact that they may have given a complimentary birthday treat.",6,6,5,Nusrat F.,"Queens, Queens, NY",165,19,28
5.0,2/16/2019,"On the last night of restaurant week dinner I came to Riverpark with 5 people. I have been to this restaurant in the past for brunch and we showed up 15 minutes before they closed. This restaurant is absolutely gorgeous. Service was efficient and accommodating especially when they were going to close for the evening.  For my three course meal I went light and pescatrian because it was a very late dinner. I ordered the cauliflower sformato. The appetizer was pretty and custard in combination with the cauliflower was to die for. For the entree I went with the diver scallops and clams which was light and perfect for that of the evening.  Finally for the dessert I had to have the persimmon cake with the ginger ice which hit the spot and was a perfect end to this restaurant week adventure.  I would return to have brunch because of the view and outdoor dining option.  Here is a tip, you can park in the parking lot and make sure the ticket is stamped by the restaurant so you can get charged only $5 for the parking fee or else you'll end up paying $16.",1,0,1,Chris P.,"ELMHURST, NY",91,53,182

5.0,2/9/2019,"A friend and I came here for the last day of Restaurant Week.  We ran late for our reservation, but the host was accomodating when I called to let him know ahead of time.  FYI- there is garage parking for $5 (so you don't have to worry about finding a spot).Everything about the restaurant screams elegance, grace, and convenience- from the coat check-in to getting my boxed leftovers.  Everyone was efficient, friendly, and personable.  Our waiter was attentive and checked on us throughout the night, asking how each course was. The ambience was soothing and suitable for conversation.  I didn't have to raise my voice to talk, nor could I not hear my friend.  The table setting was beautiful, the overall decor was even more gorgeous.We ordered zucca and cavatelli for our first courses, pork chop and lamb osso bucco for the second, brussels sprouts for our side, and ""milk and cereal"" for dessert.  Everything was delicious!  The pasta had unique flavors and textures, the pork chop was tender and well-seasoned, and the lamb osso bucco slid right off the bone.  The dessert was easily the best dish of the night, and they were all amazing.  The portion sizes were huge too.Our waiter also informed us that the Riverpark Restaurant Week menu is unique in that it is the actual dinner menu, but they bring down the prices for Restaurant Week.  In other restaurants, there are simply a few dishes to choose from.  This was the whole experience!I'll definitely be going back to Riverpark, and not just for Restaurant Week either.",1,1,0,Katy C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,19,39
5.0,2/8/2019,What a wonderful experience at Riverpark during restaurant week. Wonderfully creative food with excellent service and a beautiful view of the East River. For restaurant week we were quite surprised to have the regular menu at restaurant week pricing. Truly the best We have found anywhere for restaurant week. Rather than get a special restaurant week very limited menu as we've had in many restaurants this was the full menu at a restaurant week price. What a pleasure!The acorn squash appetizer with coddled egg was recommended and it was amazing! I also had the brisket that was delicious. My wife had the pork chop which was perfectly prepared.  The desserts as well or beautifully presented and delicious.I must also comment that the staff were excellent. Our waitress Angela was delightful and very professional.This is what restaurant week is supposed to be an opportunity to truly try a restaurant and it's best for me. We will be back with the restaurant week or not it was a wonderful experience in the food outstanding!,1,0,0,Jay G.,"Pompano Beach, FL",7,285,187

5.0,2/5/2019,"One of, if not the best restaurant week dinners I have had. The portions were not changed to reflect the lower price which was refreshing, the service was fantastic (Scott our waiter, who is also one of their bartenders, was funny, friendly and knowledgeable about the restaurant and menu) and the food was exceptional. The restaurant itself is beautiful and is inside the Alexandria Center overlooking the water.What I loved about their menu was the sheer amount of choices, including a pasta section which you could have as an appetizer or main course. The onion foccaccia they brought out was delicious and they kept offering us more (doesn't happen often, let alone during restaurant week). We started with the lamb fettucine and seafood pasta. Both were delicious and nice appetizer portions. The seafood pasta in particular stood out because of how expertly cooked the seafood was. I must have had shrimp hundreds of times, but these were the most perfectly cooked shrimp I have ever tasted. I am not a big octopus fan and the octopus in this dish was sublime and not at all chewy.For entrees, we ordered the skate and the duck. I am a big fan of skate and this was cooked perfectly, soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. It came with a beurre-blanc sauce, cauliflower and caperberries. The dish was delicious, perfectly balanced, everything I wanted. The duck was fantastic and surprisingly not too fatty. It was savory and exactly what you want when you order duck.We ordered the cereal and milk (chocolate ganache cake surrounded by rice krispies, topped with a chocolate dome filled with vanilla malt) and the coconut rice pudding for dessert. Both were delicious, but the rice pudding did not have the traditional rice pudding texture. The rice was pureed such that there were not full grains of rice, so it was a smoother paste. It sounds offputting but tasted nice and I really liked the cara cara oranges and pomegranate seeds.Our water glasses were never empty and plates and utensils were changed between courses. I told the manager how much we enjoyed dinner and he gave me his card and told me to contact him when I come back. Definitely one of the top 5 meals I have had in the city and I will absolutely be going back!",1,0,1,Jennie A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,160,3

4.0,1/31/2019,"Restaurant wasn't in the most convenient location, but if you can drive, there's a parking garage in the back of the building (Alexandria Center). Parking is $5 for up to 4 hours after you get your ticket validated! The restaurant is right by the water and has picturesque views of the skyline. Very dim lighting so it's ideal for a romantic or more intimate night.The service was SUPERB. They always noticed when we needed our water refilled and also asked if we wanted more of their complimentary bread!! I usually feel guilty asking for a second round, but they're very generous and asked us themselves so... we ended up with 3 rounds of bread :) For restaurant week, you get 3 courses (first course can be appetizer or pasta, main course, and dessert). THERE ARE SO MANY OPTIONS! I honestly couldn't choose. I went with a party of 6 so I got to try out a few things. Here are some highlights and things I recommend:First course (pasta):-The seafood pasta with squid ink: very good lime flavor on the noodles. Very fresh and light! -Lamb fettuccini: I wanted the seafood one at first, but my bf called dibs first, so I had to choose something different to share. This was unexpectedly GREAT and he ended up wanting to switch. This was very saucy like a bolognese. Also had pieces of pears which was refreshing.Main course:-Duck: FAVORITE dish of the night! Comes with 3 pieces which is surprisingly filling. The bits of sweet potatoes were delicious. The cabbage I wasn't too fond of. -Brisket: Really tender! Had a good ratio of fatty to lean meat. Had a very interesting bread pudding (?) Dessert:-Cereal and milk: one of those things you get for Instagram boomerangs. Satisfied all my dessert cravings! The touch of Rice Krispies made it extra yummy. This is a MUST get-Sorbet: blood orange was really good! The chocolate flavor was too chocolatey for me. -Ice cream: there was this apple flavor which was like apple pie + vanilla ice cream. Highly recommend!Bottom line:One of my better restaurant week experiences! The food met my expectations and the service was phenomenal. I wish they had their non-restaurant week menu available, but they still had a good variety to choose from!",2,1,2,Kristina Y.,"Hollis, NY",578,63,88
5.0,1/31/2019,"Went for Restaurant Week with a group of friends. The food and service was top notch. There were a lot of duplicate orders at the table. I ordered the mushroom farotto which was good, but the Zucca pasta was better. The onion soup was simple but the best I have ever tried, and it was so rich that you didn't miss the cheese. For entrees I had the brisket which was tasty, but a little salty. The waiter recommended the pork chop which I would normally not order. Another person at the table ordered it, and it was amazing. I would order it if I were to go back. For dessert we all had the cereal and milk dessert which was very rich. I think I would try a lighter dessert next time since it was such a heavy meal.

The menu for the restaurant week had actually plenty of different choices for different diets/preferences so it was very good for a group. We tried each other's dishes and everything was delicious.

4.0,1/25/2019,"I dined here for lunch during Restaurant Week and ordered (1) the baby octopus with radicchio, olives, quince, potato crisp and tarragon and (2) the braised chicken leg with delicata squash, roasted mushrooms, cranberry gastrique and wheat berries. From an aesthetic view - the plating was on point. The baby octopus is a bit hidden in the photo (it's sliced and you can see it on the bottom of the dish) but it was the star of the appetizer - beautifully marinated. I truly wish there had been more of it; the radicchio and tarragon was great as well but the potatoes needed a touch more seasoning and the quince was just okay. The braised chicken leg was very tender and wonderfully flavored (side note: braising as a cooking method is so underrated; when you see it on a menu, it usually yields good results) and I liked the delicata squash (which was present both in small chunks and a puree) and the cranberry gastrique. The wheat berries were a hard pass though. I don't usually eat a lot, but I was definitely full after this lunch, whereas sometimes I feel that at high end restaurants, you are hungry enough to go out for a second meal afterwards. The complimentary bread with olive oil was amazing and when they asked if I wanted another piece between the appetizer, of course I said yes! The restaurant provided a personalized menu, which was a lovely touch. The service was extraordinary - the waiters were very professional and came by to take my order, refill my water glass and serve the next dish extremely efficiently without hovering. The manager did come over at one point to circulate among the diners and ask if our meal was going well. Unfortunately, I was not able to get a table by the window, but from walking by, I can say that it provides an amazing view of the East River.

3.0,12/26/2018,"My family and I came here on Christmas Eve for dinner. There was a pre fixe menu set up for the occasion. The location of the restaurant is sort of weird:  located in an office building amongst medical buildings right on the river. The nice thing is that you are afforded a tremendous view from the floor to ceiling windows. In warmer months they have a beer garden outside. The interior is very mid century modern; sort of a modern 70s vibe. My husband and I started with Manhattans and the cocktails were crafted perfectly. I chose the onion soup to start, the cauliflower pasta as an entree, and the holiday cookies for dessert. The onion soup was quite good. The flavors were rich and delicious. Unfortunately the rest fo the meal was just very underwhelming. The cauliflower pasta was very bland. There just wasn't a lot going on and it didn't have much flavor of any kind to it. It desperately needed more seasoning. My husband said the same thing about his lamb pasta. Just overall, not very exciting. My Mom enjoyed her lamb chop and my Dad said his braised short rib was also good. I tried his pumpkin pasta he got as an appetizer and it was quite good. The desserts all sounded interesting but were not executed well. Again, just all a little bland. The holiday cookies were clearly some store bought, dry, and tasteless cookies. I just wasn't wowed. Overall I found the meal to be pretty underwhelming, especially when it cost as much as it did.",4,2,3,Joanna V.,"Brooklyn, NY",153,1361,1267

5.0,11/18/2018,"Went to Riverpark on a Wednesday a little late (we had a reservation for 5:30PM and arrived around 5:40PM due to traffic) but we were seated promptly. I think if I were to look for this place myself, it would be hard since it is a little hidden (BUT my boyfriend knew where it was so YAY!) The seating area was comfortable and in the middle. We had a sofa/cushy chair and 2 regular chairs. We were able to see outside and the bar area. The area was a bit dim for atmosphere but randomly, during our meal, the lights all turned on it was was super bright for a few minutes.Anyway, for our meal, my boyfriend and I decided to splurge a little since it was for uncle's birthday. We ordered wine that was suggested by the waiter - he suggested a Reisling from Germany (green apples and hunny!) We had ordered the crab and apple, onion soup, autumn squash and coddled egg and the cavatelli appetizer portion. Everything was very good - but if you aren't too fond of sweet, then I would not suggest the autumn squash. Henry's friend also gave us two ways of octopus (which was very good! the potato chip was spicy!) For dinner, auntie and uncle ordered the cacciucco (which apparently had some mussels that weren't super great), my boyfriend had the pork (which he LOVED by the way) and I had the steak (so delicious. so filling too!). For dessert, we had the ""cereal and milk"" but was brought a lot more like the coconut rice pudding (which auntie was a fan of), sweet potato flan (I wasn't a fan since it was actually too spicy for me to be a dessert? my mine was perplexed), and waffle cone. Overall, our dinner for uncle's birthday was amazing! I think I'd love to come back when we are able to sit outside. The view would be amazing! Loved it.",0,0,0,Jenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",194,355,413

They do small things here and there to make it feel like they're celebrating with you.All the staff is very nice and the food is amazing. The bigeye tuna appetizer and scallops entrée were on the smaller side, but the pork chop was nice and big and they serve (what I assume is) unlimited bread with delicious olive oil so you shouldn't leave hungry in either case.

Tim Cho (Assistant General Manager) created the best dining experience I've ever had!We received a personalized menu - which I've never received before - but always dreamed of. We also received complimentary glasses of Cava.We couldn't decide which wine we wanted as we wanted to order so many different types of dishes. Tim, being an ex-sommelier, was super patient with us and seemed to truly enjoy explaining which wines pair best with each dish we were planning on ordering. Right as we were about to order a bottle, Tim goes, ""how about I just bring you a flight on me?"" We were floored! We gladly drank 4 glasses of wine - one for each appetizer, one for the pasta, and one for the mains! For appetizers we ordered the grilled quail with heirloom tomatoes and shishito peppers (delicious) and watermelon carpaccio with shiso and yuzu - which was highly recommended by Tim and did not disappoint.For pasta we ordered the bigoli which was basically like bucatini with what almost felt like a meat sauce but it wasn't - it was a hearty dish so Tim split it into perfectly small portions for us - no questions asked.For the main course we shared the rabbit dish and the Berkshire pork. I can't get over how delicious the pork was, how well it was cooked and how it came with grilled peaches which I know is a classic combo but I've never had it with pork before. Now I'm inspired to make this at home although I know it will not compare!Finally for dessert we shared the peach-raspberry cobbler and the lavender pavlova. Both were perfect endings to a perfect meal. By the way, the cobbler was on the house as I couldn't decide if I wanted it!! Can't thank Tim enough - when he asked at the end of the night, ""what was the best part of your meal?"" We both said (without hesitation) ""the service!""",0,0,0,Alison H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0

It's quite popular with the medical staff, mainly physicians, that work at the NYU hospital that's on the premise. Actually, it seems like this restaurant was constructed for them so it may feel like a large country club where many of the patrons know each other.  In any case, the views of the East River are spectacular and service is attentive.  Another inconvenience is that the bathroom is out of the way -- one must exit the restaurant and go somewhere within the lobby.

Switched to a 2008 Rioja for dinner which was also amazing. The scallops were SO good with corn mushrooms and blueberries. The flavors all melded together nicely. The zucca pasta was underwhelming and lacked flavor. The cavatelli pasta with smoked chicken was interesting & unlike anything I had ever had. We ordered the peach raspberry cobbler for dessert and were pleasantly surprised when the brought out 3 additional desserts for us to try!  The cobbler was amazing. The cereal & milk option was also very very good. The corn brûlée was very different and a pleasant surprise - give it a try if you are a brûlée fan!

My favorite was the Spaghetti that came with mussels, saffron, prosciutto and dill. I would highly recommend sharing this dish.  It may be too rich to have all by yourself.  For my entree I had the Diver Scallops with pork belly and also got to try the brisket.  The scallops were so good! It came with this lemon sauce and tasted great together.  The pork belly was also so tender with this amazing sauce.  The brisket on the other hand wasn't so great.  It was pretty dry and tough to chew.  Wouldn't recommend that dish.  Overall the ambiance and the food left me wanting to go back.  Would recommend here for a date night or special occasion.  Also, if you do come here via Uber/Lyft there is a possibility that the car will drop you off at the FDR.  Two memebers of our party got dropped off down by the FDR but luckily there is some sort of elevator through the parking garage.",1,0,0,Ariana K.,"New York, NY",451,102,166

Roasted diver scallops: the scallops were fresh and well-complemented by the creamy black couscousRack of lamb: the lamb was cooked medium rare. So tender and well-seasoned! Dessert: cereal and milk.

5.0,3/25/2018,"To thank my brother, Marc, for the exceptional service he's given us as our dentist, we took him and his wife to Riverpark. The experience was impeccable -- from the food and service to the stunning atmosphere. To start off, Tyler, an employee, created a special menu for us that said, ""Thank you Marc"" at the top! Now, that was extraordinary, and was a complete to surprise to us! Will, who seated us, was extremely kind, gracious and accommodating, giving me a choice of tables. Each dish was prepared with great attention to detail, high quality ingredients, and creative flair. River Park is situated in the Alexandria Center on East 29th Street, and provides a special parking deal right in the building, making the entire experience a pleasure. (Make sure you have your parking ticket stamped by the restaurant for the $5 deal!). I recommend this restaurant very highly for a special evening.",0,0,0,Faith K.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,0

The seafood risotto was blah, the bronzino dish was so tiny and lacked flavor, but the peach crisp was so yummy. The dessert saved this review. I was not impressed by the RW menu :( The only reason I gave Riverpark 4 stars instead of 3 was because of Dusan, the wine expert. He was so knowledgeable and welcoming and kind. Offered my partner and I complimentary sparkling wine to try and we would've gotten the bottle if we hadn't already ordered cocktails (which were not that good either!).

4.0,2/14/2018,"I have been to Riverpark several times since their initial opening many years ago, but had apparently neglected to write a review.  Luckily, I happened to visit again recently for the Winter 2018 edition of Restaurant Week, so I can now fulfill my duty of recapping for my Yelp community!  Riverpark was not the easiest place to find or to get to, being in an office building, at the end of a driveway, off of First Avenue.  However, its stunning East River views and refined, modern décor made it worth the trip.  The restaurant offered a coat check, which I would recommend, as many of the tables do not have a lot of extra space.  If you are sitting by the windows on a cold evening, though, you may want to hold onto your outer layers instead.  I approached the host stand, but was unable to visit my table until my brother arrived to join the party.  Thankfully, they temper this disgruntling requirement by offering a spacious lounge area in which to wait.  My companion soon arrived, and we were escorted to a booth in the back corner that offered us a full view of the restaurant.  Our server was extremely friendly and helpful for when we needed assistance honing in on our menu selections.  After we placed our order, we each received two large pieces of focaccia bread, with a side of fragrant olive oil.  The bread was less greasy than most versions of that variety, allowing us to dip into the zesty oil as we saw fit.  I began my 3-course extravaganza with an appetizer portion of the Squid Ink Risotto.  Since this was not a pasta that could sneakily have ink in the dough, I knew that the black goo would be used as the sauce instead, which I prefer much more.  The Arborio rice was sautéed with calamari, shrimp, and octopus.  It was then topped with a few Fresno chili pepper slices.  Despite the server detailing the dish as packing an intense seafood flavor, I actually thought it had more of a lemony essence.  The included fish had been sliced up and was all perfectly cooked, but I wished it had infused the rice with even more aromatics.  The peppers were a welcome addition, but I wish there were more of them.  My brother's Buffalo Milk Burrata was completely bland and watery, making its bold adornments of mostarda pears, shallots, mustard greens, pistachio, and ginger snap tuiles absolutely essential.  When it came to the entrees, my Roasted Salmon was cooked perfectly to the medium temperature that I had requested.  It was laying on top of baked artichokes and oyster mushrooms, as well as fregola, and was sprinkled with sprigs of watercress.  The included vegetables were all very flavorful, but the grains could have used a bit more of a kick.  My cohort's Maple-Grilled Chicken was succulent and had a sweet glaze reminiscent of a barbecue sauce.  The bird was served with a seasonal winter blend of brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes, hen of the woods mushrooms, and pecans.  His dish was the clear winner for this round, which, funnily enough, had been forecasted to us earlier by the server.Finally, for dessert, I went with the comforting Pear-Cranberry Crisp.  The sweet and tart fruit filling was covered with a satisfyingly crunchy rolled oat streusel, and the accompanying scoop of Vanilla Bean Ice Cream was a great temperature balance that proved why a la modes are just so darn enjoyable.  My brother continued with his seasonal theme by ordering the Maple Crème Brûlée.   The custard had the traditional crisp upper layer and a subtly woodsy flavor, but was extremely tiny and not plated in the standard ramekin.  The additions of a pecan-date streusel , poached apples, and pickled raisins added texture, as well as even more sweetness.  Both desserts were delicious overall, though.On this Riverpark adventure, we, yet again, felt that the destination offered one of the best Restaurant Week menus in the city, since they essentially allow you to select from the regular item list, and all guests in the space must order as such.  However, this trip did not live up to previous visits in terms of the culinary execution.  This excursion was more of a 3.5-star rating, but I am rounding up to 4 stars, given previous experiences.",3,0,3,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

4.0,2/10/2018,"Visited this restaurant during restaurant week with a friend. They do three courses for $42 plus a la carte for additional plates. It's located in a small business/medical park right on the east river. They have their own gardens on site - the whole vibe kind of make you feel like you aren't in Manhattan. We started with the burratatini, spaghetti caccio e pepe and the squid ink risotto. The burrata was good but not the best I've ever had. The pastas were both AMAZING. Would highly recommend both. The caccio e pepe was a classic, but delicious dish! The squid ink risotto had good depth of flavor between the chunks of calamari and octopus, the lemon juice, and the hot peppers. For entrees, we had the duck and branzino with prawns. My friend loved the duck, but I felt like the branzino was average. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but based on the description of a lemongrass broth I expected a lot more flavor. For dessert, we shared the milk and cereal (very good and unique), the grapefruit matcha pavlova (really nice fresh flavor and great presentation), and the dirty chai and salted caramel ice cream (have had better, but still good). Oh and cocktails! We tried the Nestos and Rio Bravo. Both were fantastic and very reasonably priced. Definitely recommend trying during restaurant week when the prices are more affordable, but note that certain entrees add an additional cost to your total.",0,0,0,F D.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",0,21,3

Then served my friend the octopus appetizer which was full of hazelnuts. They quickly corrected the mistake when we pointed it out - but still that carelessness could have severely hurt my friend.

4.0,2/9/2018,"Amazing restaurant week menu! They allow you to do either appetizers or pasta/risotto for the first course. I went with a group of 4 and shared everything which worked out very nicely. The portions are big and very conducive to sharing. For starters we had the spaghetti bolognese (just spaghetti bolognese), the squid ink risotto (very good), the Veal sweet bread piccata (small bites of decadence), and the octopus carpaccio (delicious!). Main course was the pork for two served with thick slices of bacon, the short ribs which was tender, and the long Island bream (a little fishy and not as meaty as I would have liked). Dessert here was exceptional. My by far favorite was the Grapefruit Pavlova followed closely by the milk and Cereal! The crispy pear was unmemorable and the maple creme brulee was pretty decent. Overall beautiful restaurant near the water, great date spot, great place for restaurant week. Wait staff was really nice as well.

We had made a reservation a week in advance and were seated instantly. The service was great, our waitress was happy to answer all of our questions and each persons dish came at exactly the same time. Now onto the food. I started with the squid ink risotto. The flavor coupled with the seafood which came in the risotto was paired perfectly. It was a little heavy for an appetizer, but if I had gotten for a main I wouldn't have been able to finish it. For a main I got the roasted salmon. I appreciated that they asked me how I wanted it cooked, and it was cooked exactly as I wanted. Lastly for dessert I had the maple creme brûlée.

Their lunch hours are from 12:00 PM to 2:30 PM and coat check is available by the entrance to the restaurant.Here's what we ordered:Appetizers:- Maple Brooke Farm burratini (There was a $5 supplement for this which I didn't think was worth it. This was a bit too firm and the filling was watery instead of creamy. It didn't pair well with the pickled pear.)- Tuscan kale salad (Very basic salad anyone could make at home.)Entrees:- Roasted branzino (I enjoyed this since it wasn't super salty, had crisp skin, no bones, and paired well with the quinoa.)- Smoked brisket (Very hearty portion and flavor that's good for cold days)Dessert:- Matcha grapefruit pavlova (I feel like the presentation needs to be worked on. Otherwise, the flavor combination worked well, but would probably be better for those who have a sweet tooth.)- Pear-cranberry crisp (Super simple like the kale salad.)Overall, the service was good, the food was decent, and I feel like this would be a great place to get drinks at night.

We were seated in ""little chinatown"" where everyone in the our wing/corner was Asian. I have never been in such disbelief and felt very segregated and uncomfortable. I would really give this place a one star but because I wanted to review the food, I thought it would be fair to give them one more star for trying. However, I am still very displeased. Now moving onto the food, we really thought it wasn't anything special. Everything was salty or overly savory. I don't know what happened to my pictures but they were deleted. I remember ordering the scallops which we had to send back because I felt like we were literally putting salt in our mouth, and the duck. We sent the scallops back and the new scallops were still salty for our palette. I can't remember anything being too special except for the cereal & milk.

The menu is so tantalizing-- I usually opt for the vegetarian choices- and-they did not disappoint!  The carrot soup with pine nuts was so yummy and presented so beautifully- also it was not salty, it was gingery. For the main course I had the Farrotto - farro instead of rice in a risotto - like dish with plops of ricotta and toasted nuts - so so good!! And for dessert I indulged in the milk and cereal - which is one of the most delicious and exquisite desserts I've had the pleasure of trying.

5.0,1/30/2018,"So... I was really stuck between a rock and a hard place debating whether or not I should even write a review for Riverpark due to the nonexistent shitty service I got yesterday. But my Yelp conscience got the better part of me and I decided to not be petty and share one of the best meals I have ever had, top 5 easily. Besides that I also have a foodie crush (no homo) on my man. The one and only Tom Colicchio and I wouldn't want to throw salt on his game  :)At any rate my ""dear friend"" Di and I decided to partake in NYC restaurant week with a few places, after reading thru the participating restaurants and the trial and error of going to some overrated pretentious BS ahem.. Brasserie 8 1/2 (Not that I'm mentioning names) I hit the mother load and found the awesome menu that Riverpark had, when I realized TC's name was attached to it I knew it was gonna be the shizzz. Alright my fan girl rant is officially ovaSo for the peeps not in the know the deal is $42 for 3 courses and an up charge for some of the menu items, we were baller status that night. For us Asians we do it family style and got one of each thing and split it.. after  all sharing is caring. Delving into the main attractionFor apps: verbatim we got... Baby Octopus: papas bravas, chorizo, w/ lemon and garlic aioli(tapas style). The smoky charred Octopus combined with the other elements were overpowering but at the same time all relevant. When both the apps hit the table I suggested we eat this after. (Which was the right suggestion)Onto the next: Lobster Salad (+$5) sounds basic right? Not even close!! It was sweet chunks of lobster with celery root, citrus, with crispy tapioca. The tapioca was like a cracker and for you to really understand the dish, you need to have all the elements of the plate on that crispy tapioca cracker. Mind blowing for me at leastMains:Roasted Sea Bass w/ kohlrabi, sunchokes, leeks, and this incredible umami bouillabaisse sauce that the waiter pours over the finished dish after it's presented. The crispness of the skin and the flakiness of the flesh made it seem like I was committing a sin eating it.Grilled Imperial Wagyu Bavette (+10) served med/rare per requested w/ roasted baby carrots cippolini onions, Swiss chard pain pardu (fancy word for bread?) This was one of the most insane pieces of meat that have passed these lips, and every element on the plate was cohesive. The $10 supplement was worth it and then someDesserts aka finality Peanut butter chocolate bar (was a stand in for another option) with a gelato of sorts, subpar for me at least.Lastttt but CERTAINLY not least the transcendental experience that is the  ""Cereal and Milk"" (+5) a chocolate dome with molten chocolate lava cake oozing with some vanilla  type jizz out onto the caramelized rice (please refer to the video) Im  not going going to include  the fact that the service was a joke but the after speaking to the manager he did right by me and comped the drinks! ... the saving grace of a one star reviewAfter all is said and done I would pay hand over fist for the cost for what we paid, walking out I felt like I was robbing a bank. Do yourself a favor, and just Goooo. FYI after coming here. I tried tried to make another rezzie on OpenTable to no avail :( Nuff saidUpdate NYCRW 2018Wowza!! Contrary to the naysayers of the most recent restaurant week reviews, I was in a state of delirium after dragging myself here and partaking in their very most recent menu offerings . I actually upped my rating because not only was the food beyond my expectations. Our waiter Alam was the man of the hour, ever accommodating without breaking a sweat.My last experience here was underwhelming but after tonight? This will ALWAYS be a staple when it's offered in NYC resto week. The last time I was here I had to send a drink back because it wasn't what I expected, this go around they personally sent the bartender to the table to alter a drink to my taste (mind you, this is not a speakeasy) but he crafted a drink one can only dream of. The food? They say a picture is worth a thousand words, this was the equation of the pi formula (never ending)This meal was contrary to how I thought meal would be for a mass produced kind of event.

1.0,1/30/2018,"Was here last night to celebrate my birthday which also happened to be during restaurant week and I was so excited as I'd been wanting to try this place for a long time. To start, we ordered 2 drinks, my husband's glass of wine was poured by the waiter. He filled it 1/4 of the glass and walked away. For such a nice restaurant and $9, I'd expect at least a normal pour of wine. We asked one of the other waiters f it looked like a normal pour to him and he immediately apologized and filled it to a normal amount. Then we asked our waiter about the appetizers, my husband wanted the oysters but felt it was only worth the price if he got half a dozen. When he asked the waiter how many came in the order, the waiter said it comes with 6. Shortly after ordering it, the tray comes out with 4 oysters. Frustratingly, we told one of the other waiters that we wouldn't have ordered it if we knew there would only be 4, so they apologized and brought over the remaining 2. They tasted good until we got to the last oyster. It was so disgustingly slimy and fishy that my husband had to spit it out the second it touched his tongue. He was so nauseated he had to go to the bathroom to wash his mouth out, since the oyster had such a rancid taste and he was afraid to get sick. We didn't tell the waitstaff at this point because we were tired of complaining to them and felt there was no point. Next we got our entrees, when we asked our waiter about them, he described the branzino dish as being served with big 1 prawn on top and 1 on bottom. My husband ordered it and when it came out, you guessed it, there was only 1 prawn not 2. Since this is not a normal description of a dish we both remembered he had described it that way. Normally we wouldn't mind if he made a mistake, but the size of the branzino was so small it was ridiculous. It was probably 4 bites worth. And the vegetable 'side' consisted of a few thin strands of carrots and greens. There was barely and food for my husband to eat and I felt horrible. So as much as we hated to, we told a manager we were told there would be 2 prawns, so she apologized and did bring out a 2nd prawn. The desserts were ok, I got the crème brule and it was good but the size of a scallop. My husband got the pear cranberry dessert and it was so tart we could barely eat it. Although the waitstaff apologized after each instance and tried to fix it after we complained, I was extremely disappointed with this meal, especially since it was for a milestone birthday and supposed to be special. At this point I'm just hoping my husband doesn't get sick from that oyster. Unfortunately, I will definitely not be coming back.",1,1,1,NY F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0

Grilled Branzino with Prawn entree was way too acidic and salty, the acid was overpowering. Dessert of Maple Creme Brûlée was the decent but nothing special. Service was rather average also.

My bf had the carbonara with sturgeon (really good flavor!), the brisket (bigger portion than my entree but didn't think it was that tender) and the mango meringue (very interesting... kinda hurts your tongue / teeth after a while) All in all service was phenomenal and great location/ambience but prob wouldn't come back",2,0,0,Tanya Z.,"New York, NY",393,356,624

3.0,1/22/2018,"I took my family here to celebrate my mom's birthday during restaurant week. The service was great but the food was a hit or miss. Between the five of us, we were able to sample a good portion of the RW menu, though I did notice the menu was slightly different from the one posted online as their RW menu the day before. They allowed us to bring our own wine, for a $45 corkage fee. Parking is downstairs, but you have to enter from FDR drive, from 30th (the GPS will tell you to go down 29th, but that takes you to the front entrance and not the parking lot). The parking cost was $5 (for up to 4 hours) if you have the restaurant validate your ticket. First course:East & west coast oysters - you get 4 pieces, 2 of each. Pretty fresh. Baby lettuce & chicory - just an okay salad, could hardly taste the vinaigrette. Green flageolet soup - my mom liked it, but I thought this was just okay. The original menu I saw online said it would be a French onion soup so this was kind of meh. Octopus carpaccio - this was quite disappointing, there wasn't much flavor to this dish. Main course:Roasted diver scallops - very tasty and perfectly seared, but you only get 4 pieces. I didn't like the taste of the black couscous but the pomegranate paired well with the scallops. Dry aged bone in rib eye (for two) - this was the star of the meal and easily everyone's favorite. The steak was so tender and juicy and the bordelaise sauce was divine. The pomme purée (like mashed potatoes) and creamed kale sides were both spectacular. Well worth the $25 per person supplement. However, I will say that we asked for the steak to be medium (knowing my parents don't like to eat things too rare) and it was very pink, almost red in some parts - it was more medium rare. Whole roasted dorade - the waiter suggested this when I couldn't decide which fish dish to order. I thought it was quite bland and lackluster. The best part of the dish was the roasted cauliflower so that doesn't say much about the fish. I used some of the bordelaise sauce from the steak to make up for the lack of flavor in the fish.Smoked brisket - this dish was terrible. I almost wanted to send this back upon initial taste because the meat was so dry. This dish was a definite miss for me. Dessert:Cereal & milk - got two of these for the table since they seem to get rave reviews. My brother and my husband both enjoyed it, but I didn't really like the vanilla malt and I found the cake to be too dense. I honestly was not wow'd by this at all. Meyer lemon mousse - I actually forgot the flavor of these mousse cake and when I tasted it, I couldn't even tell what it was. Tasted very powdery and artificial. I couldn't even take another bite. Maple creme brûlée - this was my favorite dessert (well, the only one I liked) and only wish it was a little bigger. Sorbet (apple fennel and spiced pear) - the apple fennel was not bad (quite refreshing) but the spiced pear tasted so weird to me. I was excited to see unusual flavors like these but the dish was disappointing overall.My rating on the food is so torn, because some of the items I loved and others I hated. The service was great, however it was a little disappointing that they didn't bring out a candle for my mom and I wanted to sing her happy birthday. I mentioned it when I made my reservation and they even asked for the spelling of her name when they called me to confirm the reservation. However, I mentioned it to them and they were very nice about it.",0,0,0,Lina Y.,"Flushing, NY",156,96,90
4.0,1/14/2018,"Incredibly friendly and attentive staff, even though it's where it is because of the location it FEELS off the grid, out of the main, and kind of isolated. I was there on a Wednesday night and the surrounding area was completely deserted. it's situated in an office park complex with a bunch of big pharma companies so after 5PM it's pretty much a ghost town during the week at least.As for the food? it's Tom Colicchio, so if you're a fan you will enjoy the experience. Apparently he has a garden in front of the place where when the seasons allow he harvests some of the vegetables straight from it. Ill have to go back after the Spring thaw to experience that. Overall a little pricey but again it's Tom Colicchio.... par for the course. Arctic Char Crudo was nice, the dish advertises that along with the crudo there's American Caviar, Heirloom Beets, Crème Fraîche, Horseradish. I didnt get too much of a hint of the horse radish but the beets represented for sure. Entree for me was the Roasted Diver Scallops with Pomegranate, Celery Root, Black Couscous. to be honest the Scallops were a little over cooked and tough BUT the garnish was really tasty and filling, and I did enjoy them none the less.

4.0,12/5/2017,"I was trying to find a restaurant with a nice view for my boyfriend's birthday and stumbled upon Riverpark due to the good reviews!  I made a reservation for 6:00 PM on a Sunday with no problem.My boyfriend and I were 15 mins late but that was not an issue.  The restaurant was actually nice and quiet when we went (maybe because it was still early).  We were sat down quickly and provided a menu (the menu had ""Happy Birthday, Eldon!"" on top of it, which really added a special touch).  We ordered the following:East & West Coast Oysters 1/2 dozen ($21.00): super fresh but I definitely like the west coast more!Baby Octopus Carpaccio ($20.00): came with cauliflower, carrots, apples, hazelnuts, cilantro and madras curry.  This was a great combo all together.  The octopus was not hard to chew and all and I must say... it pretty much melted in my mouth.Pekin Duck Breast ($41.00): my boyfriend ordered this and thought it was delicious!  I had a tiny bite and thought it was great as well.Roasted Lamb Chops ($42.00): portion of this was pretty big for me!  Loved the truffle jus on top of the lamb chops.  The lamb chops were cooked very well and I really enjoyed this!Sweet Potatoes ($8.00): We had high expectations for this side dish since our waiter said it was a ""great choice"" when we ordered it... we were kind of disappointed.  The sweet potatoes and beets were DRENCHED in maple bourbon and it was just TOO sweet for our liking.""Cereal & Milk"" ($15.00): chocolate ganache cake, caramelized rice puffs, and vanilla malt.  Ah, we were pretty blown away by this dessert!  The vanilla malt was soooooo good and the rice puffs add a nice crunch to the cake!  I'd definitely recommend this!Sorbet ($10.00): opted for all three flavors - chocolate, spiced pear, and apple fennel.  The chocolate is not really a sorbet just regular ice cream.  The spiced pear was very refreshing and the apple fennel was my boyfriend's fave!I have to say the mood/atmosphere of this restaurant is very romantic so perfect for a date at night.  I love how the lights hang in the middle.  They have an outside area too but it was closed due to the weather.Service here is good too.  Our INITIAL server (he disappeared before we got to order dessert) was AMAZING - checked up on us constantly and remembered all the allergies my bf had.  I wish he had served us for our whole meal...The only thing I have to complain about is the restroom... it's a bit of a hassle to go all the way out by the security desk to do your thing.",2,0,1,Racheal D.,"Brooklyn, NY",664,230,516

I chose this place for us since he'd just moved to the city, loves food, and the restaurant well rated/seemed like an otherwise pricey place I'd probably never try since the location is pretty out of the way. I'd made a reservation in advance, so when we got there we were seated immediately. The service is impeccable and the waiters were so so friendly. We both ordered off the Summer 2017 restaurant week menu - we both got the stone fruit/mozzarella compote to start, him the cavatelli pasta and myself the seared branzino (fish) for entree, and him the key lime pie and myself the Japanese New York cheesecake with seasonal berries. We were seated in a corner of the restaurant next to the windows, where we had a perfect view of the water on a clear, sunny day. The restaurant wasn't packed, the food was so good and very delicately made (I absolutely loved all three of my foods, drooling just thinking of it). Crowd is probably mid-40's to 50's, on work lunches or lunch in general - with the prices and time of day we went, not surprised. Without restaurant week deals, I would probably think twice about coming here casually since it is pretty pricey, but I'm glad I got to experience it!

It honestly didn't bother me at all, but they also brought us a complementary cereal and milk dessert to make up for it.

The pastas, especially the squid ink one with a lemon tinge is a standout. The duck was perfectly cooked and each of the fish dishes were spectacular.

1.0,10/4/2017,"Thirty-five minutes early to a 6:00 table, on a sleepy summer Saturday, the three hostesses at the host station (why are there always three?) said they were just getting our table together, in a restaurant that was two-thirds empty. I followed up a couple of times, to the same news (""uh huh! we'll be right with you. :)"" I watched as they waited for the clock to strike six before seating us. Then we waited ten minutes for menus. Then we waited five minutes for water. Then we didn't wait to order, because we left. Hopped a cap down to Sant Ambroeus and had a charming supper.I've come to realize that that being roughed up by the front of the house is a Tom Colicchio signature, and I've really got no patience for it. It starts with the harebrained staff who hover in threes to peer into the reservations computer to find your reservation, squinting as if they're looking for the lost city of El Dorado, and it's always followed with some kind of a head-shaking problem, for which the remedy always seems to be that you probably just have a drink at the bar until they've decided it's your turn. It's not an operations management issue, it's a shakedown, and I really don't care for it. When he ran Topping Rose House, guests and I once had a _ninety minute wait_ at the bar, with nary an apology. And I'll never forget when Craft turned the corner from being a novel curio, into the bland monument to snottiness that it is today. Colicchio has decided that he's too cool for school, which is fine with me, because the city has so much more to offer, and great restaurateurs like Danny Meyer, Jean Georges Vongeritchten, and Alfred Portale, to name just three. Now that I've spotted the pattern, I'll absolutely never set foot in a Tom Colicchio restaurant again.",4,3,1,Sagaponack S.,"Bridgehampton, NY",0,8,0

5.0,8/7/2017,"OMFG!!! I love this place. What i love most is that it is farm to table.  I came here for RW lunch with a friend. I just had to try Tom Colicchio's restaurant. The restaurant is located at the end of E29th street past 1st avenue. There is a sign as you continue to walk towards the water and its found in the last building on your right. When walking in the restaurant is dimly lit with indoor and outdoor seating with a view of the fdr and the east river. In arrival from beginning to end i felt all of my needs were met. My lunch date was late due to train traffic. No problem, we will seat you and she can join you when she arrives. I sit, my server addresses me and i ordered a glass of wine. My lunch date was 30 minutes late without complaints from the staff. We ordered the kale salad and the fluke crudo. The kale salad was excellent. The best kale salad I ever tasted. It was dressed just right with a lemon vinagrette with pole beans, almonds and a parmesan sprinkle. The almonds provided a nice crunch. The fluke crudo was foo-foo shi-shi food. Something i like. It was nice, light and all the flavors blended together for a perfect marriage. The fluke was a sashimi cut along side crispy quinoa chips and watermelon with a basil sauce.  It was great with just the right acidity. The main entree we ordered branzino and salmon. The brazino was fillet with a nice crispy skin over a bed of wheat berries and carrot strips. It was just the right amount and it had great flavors. Who knew wheat berries taste so good. The salmon was good not great. If you give me salmon, then blow me out the water with flavors. The potatoes and broccoli rabe were very good. We also ordered radishes. Now radishes can have a bitter flavor but they were made perfect still keeping the natural taste of the radish. For dessert, i had to try the milk and cereal. Its a fun and playful dessert. The vanilla malt inside the milk dud was rich and had a a great taste. This was set on top of a chocolatey brownie amid rice crispies. If you like chocolate this dish is for you. Although the vanilla malt is the star. A bite was good enough for me. We also ordered the japanese cheesecake. It had more of a light fluffy texture. The ice cream that was paired with this dish was not our cup of tea but our server was not pleased that we were displeased. He wanted to give us something more to our liking. We chose pistachio and it had a great nutty flavor. Not to overpowering. This restaurants service is impeccable. They go up and beyond to provide great service.  Will i come back.

It is NOT cheap by any means so I really recommend you come for a special occasion. We ordered the oysters, which were really fresh and delicious. I ordered the pasta dish, which was decent. I enjoyed it but it didn't blow me away. What was really the star of the meal was the dessert. Look through the pictures and videos to see the cereal and milk dessert. It's amazing. And the theatrics are reason enough to order it. It really does taste like cereal and milk! Overall, the food was good, the service was great, and the experience was pleasant. I would come back again for a special occasion.",2,0,1,Bushra H.,"East Brunswick, NJ",226,315,562
4.0,7/21/2017,"Found this place via Yelp actually and the experience was amazing.  My only reason for the 4-star is due to its popularity and service will compromise in terms of wait time, AND, the getting here and park experience.View, food, ambience, and everything were awesome for couples, family, or even single professionals. People are pretty and everyone is treated nicely.I had the grilled quail and it was awesome.The view was one expensive beauty :-). Don't miss.Getting here is a challenge.  When no incidences going on, you should be able to turn right on 30th off of 2nd Ave then stay right (note: right as in not to get on the FDR over pass) so that you can be on the street below to get into the ABM Parking where they will valet and you get $5 off from the restaurant validation,The rest?  Enjoy your adventure!",0,0,0,Bend R.,"Cedar Creek, NE",0,3,1

If you're an oyster fan, this place's oysters are excellent. We also ordered the octopus for appetizers. Amazing. Entree we had the seafood pasta and the wagyu steak. Perfection at it's finest.

5.0,7/16/2017,"Literally, Riverpark is off the beaten track. It's in the Alexandria bio research complex where 29th Street dead ends above the FDR. I suspect that it survives from revenue from Alexandria companies as well as faculty from NYU Langone Medical Center and Bellevue Hospital Center. But, it's a first class restaurant that's part of Tom Colicchio's culinary portfolio, and is a truly great place. I've been there countless times, both to dine and have cocktails. It's as good as any restaurant in Manhattan and has two unique features that should make it a go-to eatery: Great view and $5 underground parking. Service is five star, as are the cocktails. Herbs are freshly cut from on-site planter boxes. Not only are all ingredients consistently fresh--fish, fowl and beef--but portions are generous. I challenge you to not to ask for seconds on the bread. The decor enhances the dining experience as well.

4.0,7/16/2017,"Came here for my boyfriend's birthday. They wrote 'Happy Birthday' with his name on the menu and then 'Happy Birthday' on the dessert with a candle. You get to take home the personalized menu after! What a special way to remember your birthday. Although I was hoping to sit outside or even a window spot, unfortunately, that did not happen. The service was near perfect- constant refilling of water and checking on us. The ambience was lovely and romantic- dim lights, blue velvet seats, cozy. We had the corner seat which allowed us to sit next to each other (I love that). Onto the food.. Spiced Baby Octopus ($20)- 4/5 This was a good dish but there may be parts where the sauce seems excessive. They also have octopus carpaccio underneath it, which was really tasty. Bruléed Buffalo's Milk Burrata ($18)- 4/5 The inside of the burrata reminded me of mascarpone so I had to stop eating it. But oh my goodness the tomatoes were so delicious and fresh! Some of the best I've ever had. Whole Roasted Dorade ($36)- 3/5 For some reason, I was not expecting a whole fish. I usually like a small piece of it. It was okay, I think I liked the veggies more than I liked the fish such as the tomatoes and some green. But a lot of it were not edible greens too (just for smell and flavor). Cereal & milk ($15)- 4/5 This was a fun dessert to crack open and watch the vanilla malt wash over rice puffs. Overall it was good and not too overwhelmingly sweet. My boyfriend enjoyed the sirloin that came with grilled asparagus, potato gratin and hen of the woods mushrooms. The hens of woods mushroom were a bit salty, but the potato gratin was so amazing and delicious!",6,6,4,Jessica D.,"Brooklyn, NY",513,436,1224

5.0,7/3/2017,"One does not go to RiverPark simply to satiate a hunger. One goes here to allow their senses to experience something truly exquisite. They understand dining in a way that so many places simply do not. It is an experience. It is not just about the food, which is nothing short of art, but also about the service, the ambiance, the way the consumer feels from the moment they step into the restaurant until the moment they depart. We were a group of six that were here to celebrate a birthday.  Erin (I think I am butchering his name) has an understanding of wine matched only by his passion for it. He expertly matched out food and suggested bottles that made us go ""Wow, I never expect this to work so well."" The food itself was prepared with skill and plated with finesse. Some of the more memorable dishes were the octopus which was made just right. Slightly seared but not dry, not rubbery. The Dorado was an excellent fish that they removed every single bone from and then assembled the fish back on your plate. The desert was probably the most creative thing we have had. It was a milk and cereal cake. It was creative, not too sweet, not bland. It just worked in a way one could not really foresee. This restaurant opens up new doors and I liked that it was an urban farm to table. The service was top tier. They are detail oriented. One example is that the wine was first poured to the ladies and then to the men with the youngest being serviced after the oldest. This is classy. How many restaurants pay attention to stuff like this? More should. It brings me back to a world of dining that feels almost forgotten today. This restaurant is not cheap, and it does not pretend to be. It is an incredible value. I would rather dine out less to be able to come here more.",3,0,0,Alex D.,"Fanwood, NJ",61,100,42

They printed a unique menu with a ""Happy Birthday"" Blessing to my girlfriend which was completely not requested and came as a great surprise. Everything we had was also wonderful, we asked to get the kale salad to share, and they split it up in two plates to serve us. We both had the Branzino and it was also fresh and amazing. The desserts were also superb, no complaints - my girlfriend had the strawberry rhubarb pie and I had the Olive oil cake. They even added a candle for her dessert and offered to wrap up the specialized menu for my girlfriend to take away as a memento. We started off with a rocky table and the waiter fixed it without us even asking. Facing the waterfront on such a nice day was also amazing. Everything was from their farm and fresh ingredients, although they don't have a set menu as all ingredients change daily.

5.0,6/18/2017,"This is one of the best meals and experiences I've ever had. The crowd did seem to be older, families and well off. For reference, I'm 30 and single but I didn't feel out of place. However, I must say that the prices were not unreasonable for such a wonderful meal and experience. I got the Skirt Steak with an egg, fingerling potatoes and asparagus. I got the steak cooked to the Cook's choice. Brilliantly cooked. Not rare and not overly cooked. Beautiful cut of meat with great flavor. The entire plate went very well together with the green sauce. Wonderful. For dessert, I got the strawberry pie with ricotta ice cream. I've never had a better pie. It was simply fantastic. The ice cream was a perfect balance to the sweetness of the pie. The pie was not overly sweet, which is refreshing since most restaurants will overly sweeten a pie. Love to see a homemade dessert done right. I also got a French press coffee. It was good not great. The atmosphere was great too. The view literally overlooks the east river. I liked the decor because with so many windows and natural lighting to make the inside way too bright or rigid feeling it over done with light colors. It had a nice relaxing feeling that made sitting, eating and enjoying the view an absolute pleasure. My only other note is that you have to kind of know where this place is.

Though the farm to table concept is great not all vegetables go with everything...like peas and cheese. Tuna tartare was a super small portion and very citrusy. For main courses my friends shared the duck for 2, meat was nice and tender, but nothing inspiring or interesting about the dish. I had the lamb chops and my other friend had the ink squid pasta. The lamb chops were mediocre...for over $40 I would have expected more then two small lamb chops and a spoonful of couscous. The ink squid pasta was super fishy--do not recommend. For dessert we shared their infamous ""cereal and milk"" desert and olive oil cake (do not order just a plan sponge cake.

I was part of a party of eight that had the opportunity of enjoying the various dishes in combination with taking in the scenery of the river along the FDR drive.First off, the location is well hidden amongst the high rises in the area so finding it is somewhat difficult. With our party fully assembled, and the opportunity to take advantage of their BYOB policy, we went right in trying First Course items such as the Fluke Cardo, roasted white asparagus, baby octopus and cripsy Sweetbreads. Each with their own unique flavor, the dishes were prepared fresh and plated perfectly. The bread they gave us, with the side of butter + Blk pepper was real dope. I tried not to eat too much of it before my meal came which was a good thing because i had my eye on the diver scallops. Usually I don't go for certain seafood items when I'm out but I made the exception after seeing the menu was primarily seafood based. As for the scallops they were incredible and roasted well, not dry or flaky at all.Another thing I noticed was the amount of care and hospitality the staff showed us.

For dessert I had cereal and milk which the waiter recommended as their signature dessert. That was inedible. It was cloyingly sweet and just generally disgusting. My coffee wasn't delivered until after my main course was finished and required multiple reminders, including speaking to the manager, before they brought it.

It was ok. Just ok. And really overpriced. Portions are far from generous. Upcharge on wines was ridiculous. If you want a decent wine (decent, not good), you're out more than $100 right there. I think when you walk into a restaurant that charges on the higher side, it's not unreasonable to expect furniture that doesn't look like it was purchased second-hand. The chairs, though comfortable, looked like they've seen much better days. A long time ago. And it's not the ""aged leather"" look. It's the ""classroom reject"" look. Really good Cosmo though.

Loved the combination of tanginess and savoriness in the dish, and the octopus was nicely crispy on the outside while tender on the inside.Scallop - This was so delicious. Definitely my favorite entree (I had bites of the other ones). The scallops were super super tender and paired well with the purée on the bottom and the sweet sauce on top.

3.0,2/16/2017,"Came here for Valentine's Day (prix fixe $95/pp, and we opted for the $50/pp wine pairing) and the whole experience was entirely mediocre. The ambiance is nice and very romantic, with beautiful views of the water - but it is pretty hard to enjoy these views unless you're sitting at a window table or outside, weather permitting. I was surprised at how packed it was at 9:30 PM but given the holiday, I figured the restaurant would try to cram as many reservations as possible. Our table was positioned very awkwardly but, again, we forgave the location given the holiday.The service was an experience I hope to soon forget. Our waitress, while friendly, was pretty much MIA the entire night starting with before our orders were taken. It took almost 15 minutes for us to even place our orders and another 10-15 minutes for bread to come out. In fact, we waited so long that another hostess tried to give us menus, assuming we hadn't yet placed our orders. I saw SO many confused servers wandering around, many with dishes of food but no idea where to place them. The table next to us was even served the wrong entrees. The only person who sounded like he knew what he was doing was (who I assumed to be) the sommelier, who was patient and knowledgable, even though overall I didn't feel the wine was worth the $50 surcharge pp.The food was decent but not amazing - it was actually pretty underwhelming when I had higher expectations for a Tom Colicchio restaurant. The lobster risotto needed more seasoning and the jumbo prawns were fresh but nothing to rave about. The entree was actually pretty solid - my boyfriend and I split the snapper for two and the fish was cooked perfectly. I enjoyed the pairing with cauliflower, though many of my almonds tasted extremely stale. Dessert was the best part of the night - the Cereal and Milk is a fun novelty that tastes delicious and my boyfriend enjoyed his apple pie. Probably our own fault for making such a last minute reservation for Valentine's Day, but the poor service really left a bad impression and judging by the other reviews - we were far from being the only parties who felt this way.

Tavern on the Green was my first choice, but was stuck with this after OpenTable cancelled my reservation and didn't offer to fix it. Yay!Now to the food; the food was mediocre at best. I've had better scallops at Red Lobster and only 4, half dollar sized scallops on a bed of some cold corn (or whatever it was), a gross, radish saturated salad and a tiny apple pie (okay, the apple pie was pretty good) for $95.00?

3.0,2/13/2017,"Not a very pleasant experience today, especially for my friend.We made a reservation for the Restaurant Week lunch here. Things were fine at the beginning. (FYI, all the parties have to be present in order to be seated.) We had our orders taken, finished the complementary bread with butter, asked for more, finished our appetizers, and then, things turned down. First of all, the appetizers. My friend's Octopus Carpaccio was delightful, getting up our appetite (we shared), especially the pomegranate seeds. My salad was alright, nothing special. Then, we waited and waited, for almost 30 minutes and still didn't see our main courses! I've finished 2 breads, been tired of talking random stuffs, and still felt starving. My friend was on her lunch break and she had to take bus to go back to work. At this point, it was already 40 min into her 1-hour break and we even haven't started the mains. She was really upset and called our server, who was not so helpful, because after we rushed him (like 3 times), we still waited for 10-15 minutes. Besides, he DID NOT CHECK ON US AT ALL while we were there. The manager (maybe, I was not sure) came to us and apologized, blaming on Restaurant Week. But this wasn't about RW. People coming way after us had gotten their food!!! Obviously they forgot our orders!!!The manager would like to offer us wines, but we refused because we were not in the mood of drinking and my friend need to work after this!!! Eventually, she gave us 2 scoops of sorbet for free, which was delicious. But honestly, we had our desserts and extra sorbet was not appreciated. We wish we could have some sort of discount, but we weren't sure, under such circumstance in America, a deduction on our bill was possible or not. We didn't ask in the end. Going back to the food.My friend chose sea bass. She liked it, because the fish was tender. I decided to try Zucca, which is some sort of pasta. It was just okay, because on the menu it mentioned pumpkin, but I didn't taste much (or any) pumpkin. In fact, the ricotta butter was too strong that it covered all other flavors, if any. All I could taste was some smoked bacon flavor. And the pasta texture was a little hard, dry, and somewhat not-fully-cooked. Not sure if it was supposed to be like this, OR they rushed cooking after we questioned them.About desserts. My friend had the Cereal & Milk ($5 suppl.). The chocolate was tasty, not overly sweet, but the cream inside was too much for me, although my friend loved it a lot. How I know the taste? Because my friend couldn't finish her dessert as she was running out of time, I ended up eating her share, too. Mine was Coconut Pavlova. TOO SWEET and HEAVY, because it was all meringue. I didn't know Pavlova is meringue based (my fault), otherwise I'd never order it. The lemon cream inside gave me a slight comfort, but I didn't finish the whole thing.The free sorbet - one grapefruit and one pear - was rich and refreshing but not so juicy or watery. It was just like the fruits. I ate it all, almost, since it was way better than mine. Oh, we also ordered a side of Brussel Sprouts. Very greasy and oily, but not bad flavor-wise.The long wait for our food kinda ruined our day, and the mediocre food didn't make it up. I had a high expectation before I came here, but left with huge disappointment. Not sure if I'd go back.",3,1,1,Jingqiao H.,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",175,184,3014

Everyone was super friendly and tentative but nothing stood out to me (which is not a ""bad"" thing). There were no food specials, ""unique"" entrée or drinks. Food tasted good but not AMAZING. I was really hungry and I ordered the scallop as my entrée and it was literally three tiny scallops on a huge plate (which I would understand if the taste was very memorable and to die for but it wasn't). My favorite part of this experience was the dessert. We ordered the milk and cereal which was really fun to eat and look at. Overall, it was not bad but not too memorable which is not a bad thing. I just wish we spent that $260 dinner at a unique, unforgettable restaurant.",0,0,0,Mandy J.,"Staten Island, NY",402,30,29
5.0,2/12/2017,"Ooomg riverpark is one of my faves. This is actually my second time visiting (first time was last summer--not restaurant week) but i had to come back when I learned that they were participating in restaurant week.Started off with the steak tartare, texture was perfect. For the main course I had the scallops. The tops were perfectly seared and crispy and they came with oats and butternut squash and pears! The pears were a (surprisingly) good compliment with the scallops so kudos on those combo of flavors! For dessert I had the apple pie with vanilla-bourbon ice cream. The apple pie was very delicious and not too sweet. The ice cream was the best imo; the bourbon taste came through really clearly and was not overpowered by the creaminess of the vanilla. I also had a moscow mule and I was very much glad that the gingeriness came through in the drink. Not sure what they used but I want some of it in my house!10/10 would definitely walk 6 aves to get to again (the 6 and the L were both delayed the night I was here, grr)",0,0,0,Karen C.,"New York, NY",80,35,24
5.0,2/10/2017,"Just finished my restaurant week lunch here and it was very nice. First of all, the restaurant itself is beautiful. It's part of a really modern building, and I love that it's next to the water. Window seats are a bit limited but lighting was pretty good regardless.I ordered the octopus carpaccio, the braised chicken leg, the cereal and milk, and a cooler called Mr. Green.You start off with a piece of bread and butter with freshly ground pepper on top. The pepper was a really nice and fresh addition to the bread, something that I rarely see in restaurants. The bread was nice and warm, and the butter was nice and salty. Really good bread and butter overall.Even though I despise celery, I ordered the octopus carpaccio because it really is such a beautiful dish. The way they plated the octopus slices makes it look like one gigantic slice of octopus tentacle. The crispy quinoa, pomegranate, and celery root add a lot of variety of textures and flavors to the octopus. For people who don't mind the taste of celery they will probably enjoy the dish more than I did.The Mr. green was a drink which had cucumber, mint, and lemon. It was a bit strange, but I wanted something refreshing to drink. It also made for a good palette cleanser between the food. I don't think it was worth a $6 supplement, but it wasn't horrible by any means. The braised chicken was the star of the show. It sits in a bed of various roots and veggies such as turnip, farro, kale, cherries, and pistachios. The chicken was so well cooked and tender, and the skin was sweet and stick. The cherries added acidity to the dish, and the farro and pistachios gave it a nice crunch. The meat fell off the bones easily, and it was a very generous portion.For the desert I got their signature cereal and milk which is a $5 supplement, but this was worth it for sure. It's the most beautiful and insta-worthy dessert I've eaten in a while. It's also so much fun to crack open the chocolate dome and let the milk flow out. There was nice contrasting textures (the rice crisps and the chocolate domes were hard compared to the chocolate cake on the bottom which was my favorite part actually). However, it was really one dimensional in flavor and just overly sweet. I still think it was worth it getting it for the picture and video. Super fun dish.The service was a bit subpar because of how slow it was. It took me about 5 minutes to flag down a waiter to take my order, and my water was only refilled once (and it was still like 3/4 full lol). One of the waiters asked me if I wanted extra bread, and I said yes, but he never came back lol. Took another 5 minutes after I got the bill for them to take it, but they charged my card within 30 seconds haha. Service can definitely use some work, but it was pretty busy for restaurant week so I won't deduce any stars. I would love to come back next time they have restaurant week, because their dinner menu looks great also. Not sure if I would be willing to pay non-restaurant week prices for this place, because of the poor service. Overall the food is really solid and they are pretty generous with their portions even for restaurant week. Definitely recommend people to check them out next restaurant week!",1,0,0,Kevin C.,"Queens, NY",234,140,1516
4.0,2/9/2017,"Although a fan of ""Top Chef"", I'd somehow never eaten at one of Tom Colicchio's umpteen Gotham establishments. Riverpark had been in my crosshairs for ages, and I finally ate lunch there for the 2017 winter Restaurant Week. I do recommend hewing to the suggested dress code; surely the elegant raised dining floor and sweeping East River view are worth a little effort on your part.The appetizer of curried squash soup with pears and chestnuts was terrific. While this is an oft-served seasonal item around time, this soup was a cut well above the crowd. It was deep, nourishing, comfort food; perfect for a winter's day. The waiter advised me that the roasted cod would be the most substantial main dish, and boy was he right. The fish was plated as a thick hockey puck, but it easily flaked at my fork. The chorizo, confit potatoes, watercress, and clams all added additional salty/meaty/acidic tastes to an ample sauce. This was easily one of the best individual courses that I ate over the R.W. fortnight.Finally, the ""Cereal & Milk"" certainly justified its' status as the restaurant's year-round signature sweet. It appeared as a globe of milk chocolate sitting over a ganache cake and rice puffs. Not knowing what to do, I poked at the chocolate and cracked its' shell. Out spilled vanilla malt creme! Imagine my delight at watching this erupting dessert 'volcano'. It was a clever and theatrical experience which also happened to be delicious.",0,0,0,Jonathan D.,"New York, NY",14,57,238
5.0,2/9/2017,This is a review on the restaurant during restaurant week winter 2017. My husband and I came here to celebrate Valentine's Day early and participate in the restaurant week menu. We loved our experience here. The menu was amazing and everything that we ate was delicious. I hate the east and west oysters which were delicious and my husband had the lobster salad which is worth the extra $5 dollars. Then we had the lamb shank and the sea bass. The lamb shank was fantastic! I can't rave about it enough. A must try entree! Then for dessert we had the panna cotta and the peanut candy bar. One was light and one was dense. But the flavors explode in your mouth. I think we will try the cereal and milk dessert next time as it's one of their best desserts. Fantastic menu and customer experience and you can't beat the view. Try to get a seat by the window if you can!,1,0,0,Sonia A.,"Larchmont, NY",39,95,22
5.0,2/9/2017,"I came here for lunch on a Thursday.  I'm a fan of farm to table restaurants who use locally sourced ingredients.  My friend and I both had the octopus carpaccio, sautéed royal sea bass, and the apple pie.  The dishes were all delicious, healthy, and incredibly fresh.  They were all presented beautifully as well.  Everything is seasonal so since it was February, there were a lot of winter ingredients like pomegranate, barley, and celery root.  I'm not a dessert person but the apple pie was not too sweet and tasted amazing.  The service was excellent, very attentive and friendly.  I would definitely come back when it's warmer so I can sit out on the deck with the gorgeous view of the East River.",0,0,0,Julie Ying X.,"Brooklyn, NY",230,557,557

5.0,2/8/2017,"Came here during restaurant week with another couple and it was a very... unique place. It's close to NYU's hospital and located inside a research center ""life sciences"" type building. Ambiance was fantastic with a couple of couches/chairs behind the hostess' stand (where our friend waited for us). There is a large bar in the center and the tables are all along the windows overlooking the outside. Service was phenomenal. They came by frequently to refill our water, explained each dish as they were serving it and checked in on us every so often.For starters, I got the baby octopus. It had so much flavor going on, that I was slightly confused, but it was really good. It didn't seem to blend together, but each component was so tasty. Their menu allowed you to pick a pasta as either a starter or entree if you wanted (yay for more options!)For my main, I got the diver scallops. It was on point. Although there were only 3 scallops, the accompaniments helped elevate the dish. It was hint of sweetness in there which is a new sensation for me. The best part of any dinner is dessert. I got the vanilla panna cotta and it was absolutely delicious. Served in a stemless glass and topped with citrus. Very rich and creamy. The bourbon ice cream with apple pie was also a great choice. Amazing bourbon flavor that complements the pie.Definitely a splurge worthy place for a special occasion.",1,1,0,Joey L.,"New York, NY",140,297,554
5.0,2/8/2017,"My wife and I had a wonderful dinner here.  It was Restaurant Week, and I wanted to try a seafood restaurant downtown.  It turns out we found a gem.Everyone was gracious and professional from the moment we walked in.  Our reservation was promptly honored. Our first impression at the interior decor was ""Wow!""  What a beautiful place!Since I noted on my reservation that my wife and I were celebrating our mutual birthdays, when we were seated, Joseph, our waiter, immediately offered us complimentary champagne.  His pour was generous, to say the least!  Not a bad start for the evening!This restaurant did something different than the other Restaurant Week restaurants we visited over the few days we were in the city.  They did NOT abbreviate their menu - it was a complete menu at RW prices, with a few supplemental charges where appropriate. Hey, here's a restaurant willing to take a risk - full service menu during RW.  Why not put your best foot forward?  The evening was getting better!While perusing the menu, the manager, John, stopped by our table to ask if we had any questions.  He knew about my wife's dietary restrictions from a phone call I received from the restaurant a couple of days earlier, and he wanted to make sure she would be happy.  He offered to make the necessary tweaks here and there, even consulted with the chef, and made it work for us. The food - the kitchen doesn't have a chef, it has a magician! My wife had a fresh, delicious Tuscan kale salad.  I tried the octopus carpaccio - cooked perfectly. As good as it tasted, the presentation was more amazing.  The octopus was resting on top of a bed of finely sliced octopus placed in an overlapping tile-like manner, with the sauce and other accoutrements.  Beautiful presentation!We shared a whole roasted branzino for two (remember, at RW prices!).  John presented the roasted fish to us before he brought it back to the kitchen to be filleted, as our request.  The skin was crispy, the meat, moist. Perfectly spiced in the kitchen (I noticed there was no salt or pepper on the table).  We've had branzino many times before, and this was amongst the best.Oh, a little thing - I also noticed that the butter was especially creamy and had a ""stripe"" of a pepper and salt mixture down the middle.  That added a wonderful flavor to the butter.For dessert, my wife asked for fresh fruit, which was off-menu.  John was happy to comply.  I tried the ""cereal & milk"" dessert ($5 supplemental).  Out came a hard chocolate mound resting on the chocolate ganache cake, surrounded by caramelized rice puffs.  I wasn't sure what to make of this.  I broke into the chocolate mound and out poured the vanilla malt.  The chocolate and vanilla flavors mixed wonderfully, and the malt flavor reminded me of my favorite childhood drink!  The soft cake and crispy rice puffs complimented each other.  I don't know if this will be on future menus, but if it is, try it!  It's fun and delicious.So as luck would have it, we enjoyed the most memorable meal we've had in a long time. This place has it all - wonderful food, people, and ambiance.  We will definitely be back.",0,0,0,Steven R.,"Huntington Station, NY",0,2,0
3.0,2/7/2017,"We came here for RW 2017 during dinnertime based on recommendations on various websites.  I made a reservation ahead of time.  Our cab driver took us on a wild ride, as GPS took him to the back of the restaurant, which was the FDR.   So, my friend and I got dropped off in the middle of FDR . We walked towards the Water Club and maneuvered our way back to the 1st avenue as the FDR is not made for passenger crossings. So if you are trying to get to this restaurant, just tell your cab driver to drop you off at 29th street and 1st Avenue.   The restaurant is towards the end of an enclosed complex where a residential complex named Alexandria (please do a fact check.com on the spelling :D) is located.  You would have to walk through the lobby and get to the very end and then make a right to get to the entrance to the restaurant.  I made a reservation and requested to be seated by the windows with a view.  The lounge/bar where we waited was beautiful with romantic lighting.  After waiting 5 minute past the scheduled time, we were taken to our table.   We were seated at a table by the windows overlooking the area right next to the water.   We had to wait a while in order for someone to bring us menus.  The menu was automatically the RW menu which contains dishes the restaurant normally offers.  Everything was ok up to the point we placed our order.  After that, it was when you would start taking off the stars.   We had to get literally several people's attention in order to get one person to get us some bread while we're waiting.  Their bread was a mini-baguette and their butter was topped with crushed pepper.  Their butter was really good.   And then a 3rd server approached us (I am not sure why they keep having different people serving a table), but I am so glad we ended up with him.  He offered us a little bit of wine named Atmosphere and apologized for the long wait for the food to come out.  He's professional and friendly.  I regret that I didn't ask for his name so I could share here.  Then the food came,  we ordered the salmon crudo and east west oysters as our appetizers.  The salmon was good and even the beets on the plate tasted good.   The oysters dish came with 4 pieces - 2 from the East coast and 2 from the West Coast.  The oysters were fresh and I like the vinegar & garlic garnish. For the entrees, we ordered the duck breast ($8 supplement for RW) and the sea bass.  I really think that you cannot go wrong with seafood at this restaurant.  The sea bass was perfectly seared, the skin was crispy and the meat was flaky.  It came with a sauce which I asked the server to pour it on the side.   The dish was a delight to the mouth.  For the duck breast, we followed our server's recommendation and ordered it medium rare (chef's recommendation).   The portion was small but the succulent pieces of duck meat was so flavorful and it had a melt in your mouth texture to it.  The duck breast dish was definitely the highlight of the night. For the dessert, we followed other Yelpers' recommendation and ordered their must-try Milk and cereal dessert ($5 supplement for RW) and the apple pie.   When the desserts arrived, they smelled so good.   My friend was looking for milk for the cereal in his plate, and I asked him to break the chocolate shell with his spoon and ta-da, the milk-like liquid came out and the chocolate cake at the bottom revealed itself.   The dessert was memorable and had a lot of depth to it (crunchy, chocolaty, soft and liquidity).   I would recommend you trying this dessert when you come here.   For the Apple pie, it came with vanilla ice-cream, the crust was buttery and flaky and the apple filling was not too overpowering. This is so disappointing as this restaurant has the potential to be rated 4 stars or 5 stars because of the food.  The food is definitely worth raving about, it is professionally prepared and very delicious!   However, the lackluster service being offered at this restaurant is a big turn-off.   There are only 2 staff people that were doing an excellent job that night,  the rest of the team needs more training. A side story, I was sitting next to someone who was talking so loud that night.  She even admitted to the fact that she got kicked out of a restaurant before for being too loud.  I do give the 2 excellent staff a lot of credits for being good sports and dealing with that customer professionally during that evening.   She definitely ruined everyone's evening that night.",0,0,0,Peggie Y.,"New York, NY",223,199,2692
3.0,2/5/2017,"**Note: This review is mostly for management, with regard to a particular waiter we had...and without this disappointing service, should have been a 5 Star review. Management: If you'd like this waiter's name, or any other info, please reach out, as I didn't include specifics here. Also note that there were 2-3 other waiters who served us throughout our meal, and they were each excellent, as were the hostesses. We were warmly greeted, our glasses were always filled, we were offered more complimentary bread, and our dishes were cleared in a timely manner.**A close friend and I came here for Winter Restaurant Week. I'd heard such rave reviews about the quality of the food (it *is* a Tom Colicchio restaurant, after all), particularly its RW dinner offerings, so was dying to check it out. From the moment we walked in, I was sure we were in for a classy evening. Although we weren't overlooking the river, I don't think there's an inch of this place that is not beautiful. This would be a gorgeous spot for an anniversary dinner. (5 stars for decor/ambiance)And...cue the service. A few minutes after the hostess seated us, our waiter gave us RW menus and a drink menu. No smile, no introduction, no ""Hi, welcome to Riverpark, how are you guys"" -- just a gruff instruction to ""be ready to order all three courses at once when I come back."" Um, Sir yes Sir? As more diners began coming in, my friend and I would hear him greeting them, giving recommendations, and being friendly with literally *everyone else*...but never with us in any interaction. Was it something I said? *scratches head* It was actually highly unwelcoming. Our section wasn't busy, so I doubt this was due to stress. But then the food arrived and saved the day :) I had the curried squash soup, zucca pasta, and cereal & milk. The soup really had a kick to it, and when combined with the sweet julienned pears, didn't quite work for me. But the zucca pasta, oh my gosh. So flavorful, comforting and fresh. After a stressful week, it was exactly what I needed. Not surprisingly, the star of the meal was the cereal & milk, which apparently is Riverpark's specialty. Cracking the chocolate is the American equivalent of Amélie cracking her crème brûlée crust. It was bliss :) (4.5 stars for the food)Time for the check. Grumpy McWaiterpants dropped the bill on our table, with a mere ""Here you go."" Didn't bother asking ""How was everything,"" since it fit with his whole ""ignoring our table all evening"" thing he had going on. We get it, consistency is key ;) So, my friend and I paid, evenly splitting the total between our cards. I got my receipt back, and he had charged me for the full meal. I called him over to correct this, and he flippantly explained that error was due to the printer running out of ink. *NO* apology, despite the fact that I was extremely polite about being charged *twice* the correct amount. I'm not so thin-skinned that he ruined our evening, but his demeanor was seriously off-putting and very much in contrast with this high-end restaurant. (1 star for the main waiter's service)TL;DR -- Gorgeous dining space; perfect for celebratory dinners; diverse and well-thought out menu from notable chef; well executed entrees; cereal+milk=heaven; seriously rude/dismissive/absentee waiter stuck out like a sore thumb",0,0,0,Shawna A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",43,3,5

I told them about my food allergies upfront which they followed. However the restaurant was not completely forthcoming with its descriptions of the food. I ordered the cavatelli which 99% of the places I have been to is a safe bet as it's a generally very bland yet mildly flavored dish. At Riverpark it was so spicy my mouth was on fire after two bites. Nowhere on the menu did it mention that it was spicy! Had I known I would not have ordered it due to my chronic acid reflux. Next I ordered the lamb with lentals. The lamb was VERY rare and again not what I was expecting. I would have never ordered it rare. I was expecting it to be well done as lamb is again 95% of the time. Again I was not asked how I wanted it prepared nor was I expecting it to be totally rare. The lentals where hard and under cooked. All I was able to eat was a plate of potatoes and for that I was charged 100$.  At the very least they could have not changed me. I won't ever make the mistake of coming here again.** Update ** the general manager called and left me a very nice voicemail after reading my yelp review.

He is a racist and if you're of or appear to look of any sort of Hispanic origin you will be belittled. Customers go to eat and enjoy food. Not to be stereotyped and discriminated against. This is the 21st century. If Tom wants to be successful he needs to make sure customers and emare happy. I give this location 1 star; for its view of course.,0,1,1,Kay R.,"Bronx, NY",0,4,1
2.0,11/26/2016,"Located in the back of the Alexandria Center, Riverpark is one of Tom Colicchio's restaurants in New York.Parking is located downstairs (have to around the back along the FDR back drive). $5 for up to 4 hours of parking for diners a la carte (get validated at the restaurant). The lobby is cool, and the bathrooms are located in the Alexandria Center lobby rather than in the restaurant. The big bronze-like door is the entry and a coat check as you enter. Large windows overlook the East River, and the plot is surrounded by many mini-gardens and a greenhouse that supplies much of the herb and spice needs of the restaurant. A large room to the back also supplies private parties a place to stay. Some outdoor seating in the warmer weather available by reservation-only.Water was tap and cold, but the iced tea tasted like it was brewed in the same bucket as the coffee - disappointed.Appetizers:- Grilled Bread with avocado and the Grilled Bread with Ricotta (and peanut mash) were good; the bread was the best part with the toppings good, but could have used a touch more sweet with the avocado and salt with the ricotta. - Maple Brook Farm burratini was a buffalo mozzarella with some local beetsMains:- Lamb shank was done well (shared a piece from a friend)- Fried Chicken and Waffles; overcooked and didn't taste like much; the home made hot sauce didn't help to do anything other than mask the lack of flavor.Dessert - we did some starters instead as dessert since they were more interesting:- French toast sticks - a little too hard and the maple syrup is watery and lacks the flavor of the ones I've tried from Canada- Cinnamon Doughnuts were probably the best part of the meal; warm and fluffy, tasty- Dutch Baby Pancake - it was quite large, covered with some apples and not much for my tasteOverall, we weren't rushed and the service was reasonably active, but I've had better food.

However, I have to say that I was a little disappointed and felt like it was not anything special. While it wasn't necessarily bad, I'm not sure it would be worth the price to come back and order it.On the other hand, I thought that their cereal and milk dessert was pretty good.

Moreover, it was probably the most beautifully composed dish I've ever been served.

Or waiter was polite and explained the dishes. We started with a delicious and thick Bloody Mary, garnished with an olive and lemon wedge. One item I never started a meal with was their fresh doughnuts with warm chocolate dipping sauce. They were fantastic, light and sprinkled with sugar. The next was a generous portion of kale with nuts and more. A half portion would have been enough.  The fried chicken and waffles was adequate. The leg and breast were small and average.  The waffles were also small, which was fine, but very tough. We did not finish them. Hot syrup was provided. The last dish was the egg tacos.  You get three soft tacos in a stainless steel frame, filled with ground beef and perfectly cooked scrambled eggs with fresh hot red peppers, and other accoutrements. We feel into a lull for our table to be cleared and to get the check. It was about $90 including a nice tip. We're not sure it was worth that much to come back, but it was nice change from other ""brunch places."" We could have gone even further overboard with our ordering, but we left quite full.

The view from the restaurant is nice - it looks out over the East River. I think it's a great value for the quality of the dining experience and fresh food. They actually have their own garden, and they tailor the menu to incorporate whichever ingredients are fresh and ready to be used.

3.0,8/20/2016,"Riverpark looks like it has the entire package - absolutely stunning views of the river, swanky interior, celebrity-chef origins - but the food didn't hold up for me. Fried chicken and waffles: One of the more popular dishes on the menu, but I found it pretty meh overall. The chicken had fantastically crispy, flaky skin and juicy meat, but just tasted kind of bland. I felt like I got all the butter and oil and calories that come from eating fried chicken, without any of the satisfaction of eating said butter and oil and calories. The waffles were a bit stodgy as well - not light and crisp on the outside as (my opinion) a waffle should be, and too dense and chewy on the inside. Also, they were sprinkled with coarse sugar on top, which I normally wouldn't mind, but the sugar made the waffles too oddly sweet in a way that didn't mesh very well. The rosemary + black pepper flavors were not at all discernible in my batch either, unless you count the sprig of rosemary garnishing the dish.House fries with dijonnaise: Fairly large basket of decent but standard fries. They were beautifully golden, but cut very long and were also quite soft, which made them a bit awkward to eat. It was hard to pick them up by one end and dip the other end in sauce, so I ended up folding them in half and dipping the middles instead. Not a big deal, but sometimes it's the little things.Riverpark is a truly lovely setting for an event or a date, but there are alternatives if you're looking for the food to stand well on its own too.",3,2,1,Millie S.,"Manhattan, NY",384,284,415

We decided to try out Riverpark, a place that we didn't even know existed by the NYU hospital.  When I first walked there, I was stunned at the ambiance. It was so classy, yet not pretentious nor too high end. We were quickly greeted and seated.  With so many options on the RW menu, I decided to try the cucumber dill gazpacho for the appetizer. It was beautifully presented and poured in front of you.  It had a fresh taste and a bit of pickle-like flavors. My entree was the sea bass, which I found a bit dry, but the sauce was amazing and the side veggies spot on. Lastly, I got the corn cake with pistachio gelato for my dessert.  I enjoyed my friend's fruit trife instead, but both were unique in its own way.  I would most definitely return for another occasion.",2,1,1,Lilian N.,"Queens, NY",397,215,397

5.0,8/5/2016,"This is the best place in mid-east town to have outdoor lunch during the day. It has indoor seating areas but the next-to-river outdoor has phenomenon view of midtown, up down, East River, and Brooklyn. In a sunny day, the sunshine will reflex  through the water. Staff are very kindly and seated 13 of us in the lobby. Almost every table has a nice view through the huge window on the east side for water view. The restaurant week menu has been surprisingly extended to full menu. So, do. It miss the opportunity. My starter kale salad is huge. I mean entrée size huge. chopped kale and mix green are fresh and tasty. Pole beans, green and yellow type, are sweet. There are a little too much Parmesan IMO. Almonds are slightly chopped. It would be nicer if chef can lightly roast them. OK the main dish is a piece of sautéed bass. The fish was perfectly seasoned with crispy skin. Mine is slightly cooked and a little dry. I did not sense the basil but I like the Quinoa and sliced heirloom squash. In the end, it cost $5 extra for the signature dish-Mile&Cereal. As you all know, the opening of chocolate shell brought everyone OHHHH. If I were the chef, I would replaced the 'Cereal' part to roasted almond, cranberry, strawberry, a little mint and reduce the sweetness from the ""Milk"". Let the natural sweet flow with the milk.

1.0,8/4/2016,I have never written a negative review of any restaurant. However I have no choice.  The location and food was great. However the maitre D was rude.We then had our waitress who must get her people skills from the Maitre D. She took our orders and never re approached our table until desserts. The wine Stewart was amazing. He spent more time with us then our waitress. We approached the Manager about this situation In mid dinner and nothing changed. The waitress did not attend our table. I debated whether to not leave a tip. However I knew the only people I would harm is the other team members. Then to top it off with 15 minutes left in our dinner I asked the Maitre D to order us 2 cabs because we had another event to attend. He stated he would. We then left and went outside. No cabs. I went back in and he stated he did not call the cab. He was going to do so once we left. I reminded him that I asked him to call me a cab 15 minutes before dinner ended. Also even considering his theory that he was waiting for us to leave he never called us a cab. Any organization is only as good as its management.

That unlucky individual received two pancakes (about four inches in diameter), topped with half a banana, and some maple butter on the side.

A while later, he received about two tablespoons of quinoa topped with three small pieces of steamed vegetables.

The inside is also very cool, and well decorated and intimate. The meal was outstanding. Along with two bottles of chard and some delicious bread we ordered the following...Potato onion soup - very good. Lighter than expected. Poured at your table. Very crisp and clean tasting. Hamachi - another good app. Seared with a brulee torch, but raw in middle. Along with some root veggies. Like it a lot. Crab salad - wasn't the greatest fan of this one but also not a huge fan of crab salads in general. Definitely super fresh meaty crab though so if you are a big grab person i recommend it. Came with some greens and snap peas and a few other veggies mixed in. Mustard greens salad with plums - liked this salad a lot. Great leafy greens. Nice light dressing. Fresh sweet plums and parm shaved on top. Very good. Bigoli pasta - good but not my favorite entree. Thick meaty noodles. A nice garlic forward sauce. Cheese and breadcrumbs always a plus. The ramps were a really nice note. Would go for something more unique tho. Diver scallops - scallops done right. Perfectly cooked. Dense. Crispy outside and warm inside. Rabbit - if you like rabbit this one is a no brainer. Its almost like super tender chicken. You get it two ways. One way is cooked in a stew almost like the inside of a chicken pot pie. Delish! Then you also get loin wrapped in bacon. And its got a puree of carrots. Really really loved this dish.Fish for two - also a huge winner. Whole snapper cooked head on. Crispy fried outer skin. Stiffed with herbs and veggies inside. And an amazing snap pea puree all over. Very very good. And a really nice size. Cookies and cream - awesome. Don't even know what i was eating but it was awesome. The coffee cardamom ice cream was sensational. Overall loved this meal. Everything was great. The place, the view, the service, the food.

Perfectly paired on top of a deliciously warm, grilled bread. GET THIS!! We also got the burratini+ prosciutto - really good! Side Dish:Hash browns - I think these are the best hash browns I've ever had. If you like your hash browns, crispy all around (and why wouldn't you?) and lightly seasoned. Get this to get that perfect ratio of crispiness and soft, potato-ey goodness. Entree:The fried egg and pork belly sandwich was STELLAR. Pork belly. Egg. Fried green tomato, delicious sauce + cheddar all on top of an english muffin - if you can fit a little bit of everything onto one fork for a bite it is PERFECTION. Even if you can't - each component of this dish was so good! We couldn't finish the fries it came with because we only had eyes for our hash browns.

I liked the space which I found modern and elegant. It was quiet when we got there at 8 pm but all the tables were occupied by the time we left. The service was friendly. My biggest issue with Colicchio's food is that it was very salty in previous experiences. This was not the case tonight. The grilled octopus was salty and chewy yet the other elements on the dish were underseasoned. The zucca pasta dish was borderline salty however the pasta and merguez were really nice. The rib eye was humongous and the meat nice; the chimichurri sauce was mono-dimensional and did not work for me. The Meyer lemon tart was more exciting to look at than to eat.

It's more east than 1st Avenue in a non-descript office building -- the sorts where shady activities are going on in ""thriller"" movies.

Started off with brussell sprouts and roasted quail (YUM!) For entrees, we had a roasted merzula and braised lamb. A lot of places like this (see EVEREST in Chicago) have a terrible price-per-portions ratio, but these entrees were totally filling. Desert was an apple tart and a chocolate/milk/cereal thing that was delicious. I forgot to take pictures, so just trust me.Service is friendly and not pretentious.

2.0,2/14/2016,"the food is DELICIOUS! But what a disappointment for the rest! We went there for Valentine's Day with my husband. So you know, we own a restaurant on 20th St. The food was amazing nothing to say about that. But the service and atmosphere wasn't here AT ALL... First of all, the restaurant was freezing! We were so cold there, this was not even ok.. To be honest being a restaurant of this standard should at least bring some extra heaters. Who cares if it is ugly when your guests are that cold, trust me they wouldn't say no to a nice and warm heater next to them. Go to home depot and get a bunch of heaters for you guests! The restaurant is new very modern, very pretty but unfortunately there is no soul in there. It is just a new and cold decor. No history, no charm, no soul. Mediocre service at his best for a restaurant of that kind. Perhaps too professional but not very personable. You won't remember anyone from there. When you spend $500 for two you expect something much better.",0,1,0,Anne K.,"New York, NY",23,18,2
2.0,2/13/2016,"All in our group agreed we perceived Riverpark to be a little cold and stuffy. Maybe it was the out of the way, concrete laden location rather than being in an inviting neighborhood, maybe it was just the snowy, cold evening, or maybe it was the cold, frowny demeanor of our waitress.  The food was edible, and at least it was warm, but not good enough to offset the harsh experience.It's possible we just aren't the target demographic for Riverpark. We're younger and had a guest with dietary restrictions. While eventually after several rounds of asking back and forth, the waitstaff, chef and customer were synchronized on what these restrictions were (vegan), the process eroded the experience. It didn't help that the waitress kept saying she would have to go and ask ""chef"".  She would say ""I'll have to go ask chef if we can do that."" Not ""the chef"" or Chef Colicchio or Tom, but ""chef.""  Seems odd. Part of this back and forth was because few vegan options were offered. In the end, the staff did a good job of meeting these restrictions, but I wouldn't call the process inviting.During the dining experience, our waitress was covered in frowns. Has someone died? To us, the overall experience seemed cold and a little strange. There's no need to frown -- the food was alright, but we won't be back.",0,0,0,S S.,"Upper Arlington, Columbus, OH",0,20,0

I had the pumpkin pesto and a side of crispy fingerling potatoes. Both of which I was very pleased with. We requested an uber to go to Lady M for dessert from here and as previous yelpers have said, it can get very confusing because of where the restaurant is located so we ended up taking a taxi- a series of them will pull up by the roundabout.On another note, I expected a different crowd.

You don't ""dumb down"" the menu by offering small portions or dishes that you wouldn't normally serve because they are cheaper options. You do restaurant week to win over customers and show them what you offer. And they offer the entire menu with several dishes having a nominal upcharge if you want them. The food does not disappoint - our favorite app was the gulf shrimp with couscous ($5 upcharge) and we both enjoyed our entrees of the pork loin -  and the branzino.

3.0,2/3/2016,"I came for Restaurant Week Lunch, but I have to say I'm a little disappointed with the overall experience. The location and design of the restaurant are really nice; the décor is pretty spot on: classy and modern. The waitstaff is professional, but I found the service very slow and a little cold. It may be because we were a group of college freshman, but for a restaurant of this caliber, I expected non-discriminatory service. We're paying customers too. Also, there is no Royal Sea Bass on the actual menu; the fish changed to Branzino, and that was super disappointing (online menu shows that there is bass). [FOOD]Bread & Butter: I saw someone review it and compliment it, but the bread was incredibly salty, and the butter (though soft) was decent at best.Baby Lettuces and Greens: Very rarely do I leave food on my plate, but I left almost half of the portion. You get a mountain of vegetables of all types. There is so much going on that every bite tastes different, and the flavors conflict rather than go together. It was also hard to taste the vinaigrette. This starter was definitely disappointing. Only plus for me was that the ingredients tasted and looked extremely fresh.Braised Chicken Leg: I was expecting something special, but it tasted like a fancier rotisserie chicken in that the meat was extremely tender and the skin was crispy, but the taste was a little bland and unoriginal. The side ingredients did taste quite nice though; the freekeh was good, the squash was surprisingly great, and the mushrooms had a nice earthiness. Unfortunately, overall dish was a letdown.Cereal and Milk ($5 Supplement): This was supposed to be the saving grace of my experience here. At a premium and raved about, the dessert seemed like something amazing. Sadly, I was disappointed again. You crack open the shell by hitting it with the blunt end of the spoon, and the ""milk"" flows out. The ""milk"" is a very good creamy vanilla flavor (kind of like melted ice cream but without the grossness of it). The chocolate shell was overly sweet if eaten by itself, and the ganache cake was thick and heavy but not rich at all. The rice puffs are more or less rice crispies. [OVERALL]I paid $36 for the meal after tip and tax. That's a lot for lunch, even if it's at such a nice place. The food was a little better than okay, but there was nothing special. I wouldn't come back for what I ate, but I might for other menu items. On another note, the view is nice.",2,0,0,Kenneth Y.,"New York, NY",444,97,172
4.0,2/1/2016,"Location: If you're going to uber/taxi/lyft- don't put in the restaurant's address. you'll end up getting dropped off literally right off the FDR lol Rather, have them drop you off at 1st Ave and East 29th St. You'll walk through a gated archway and veer right toward the Alexandria. Once you're inside, the signs will clearly guide you to the restaurant. Bathrooms are outside of the restaurant by the front desk. So glad I finally made it here for restaurant week! Although we had requested a table by the window, they were unfortunately all full when we arrived and ended up seated at a table by the bar.  Baby Lettuces & Greens- it may sound simple, but you have to get this. Riverpark sources their ingredients on site at the Alexandria center for life sciences. Also from Brooklyn Grange too. Nothing like fresh greens, locally sourced, for that perfect farm-to-table experience.Spice Brûléed Hamachi- I'm a big fan of Hamachi, so this was a must get. Solid. We approve + recommend! Berkshire Pork Chop- This is what they're KNOWN for. Must get- It was tender and wonderfully flavorful. Roasted Merluza- Interesting and unique only because I don't believe I've had merluza before. Light and crisp flavors. Good balance with the Pork Chops. Dessert: CEREAL AND MILK! GET THIS! The idea of vanilla malt in a a chocolate ball you have to open to release the yumminess all over the rice krispies is a fun idea. And so good! Lemon Tart- a bit too tart for me. lol I've definitely had better, but I'll eat anything citrusy. Service- Absolutely wonderful. Server was knowledgable with wine and food recommendations, also very sweet and down to earth. Big fan. I'd love to come back for a window table next time- perhaps for brunch (look forward to an updated review!)Even without the table view, we walked out and crossed the ""danger"" tape they put up post-blizzard of 2016...assuming to avoid falling/melting snow from the roof.

4.0,1/31/2016,"Went here for Restaurant Week a week or so ago and it was one of the best RW experiences I've ever had.  My friend says flat out it is her best experience.  I normally wouldn't review a place based solely on their RW menu since it's not a true reflection on what they can do, plus service is usually slower.  But this place pretty much offered their entire menu, which is impressive in of itself.  For our entrees, we shared a pasta dish (the one with lamb sausage) and the octopus carpaccio.  The pasta was good but very salty and a bit too heavy for a starter.  But we thought the octopus carpaccio was heavenly and worth the whole meal alone: perfectly light and refreshing and served with pomegranate seeds. We had the pork chop and braised lamb for our entrees, both of which came in huge portions that we had to take half home.  The pork chop was served with an apple hash which added the perfect amount of sweetness.  I'm usually not a fan of pork chops and I can say that this was the best I've ever had.  We shared the Meyer lemon tart and their signature ""Cereal and Milk"" for dessert for an extra supplement.  I'm a bit lactose intolerant so I didn't like how strong the mascarpone was in the tart, but we both loved ""Cereal and Milk.""  So creative and beautiful with so many characteristics of a great dessert: the amazing crunch and texture of the rice cereal and chocolate dome, the smooth creaminess of the vanilla malt, and the decadent richness of the chocolate brownie cake on the bottom.  It's the most memorable high end restaurant dessert I've ever had.  We are definitely coming back here again.  And I imagine when the weather gets warmer it would be so beautiful to hang out by the river before or after the meal.",0,0,0,J.

Not sure if I would recommend this dish since the others got the octopus (they said it was delicious) and the quail (she said it was pretty good) and they both looked a little better than mine.The short ribs were very good.  The meat was falling apart tender but still had a bite to it - as if it was cooked for an extra few minutes.  The rice on the bottom was my least favorite part of the dish - it was very bland.  I didn't think the red wine sauce was enough for the rice.  It wasn't bad - just not great.  Others had: pork chops (he said it was fantastic), merluza (he said it was good) and this other fish that I forget (she said it was delicious).  I think if I went back, I would try the pork chops since it looked a lot better than what normal pork chops looked like.  It still had the bone in.The dessert was fantastic.  Most of us got the cereal and milk which is their signature dessert and one of us got the lemon tart.  He's a fan of lemon tarts so he loved it.  The cereal and milk is extremely sweet especially with the dense chocolate cake.  Thankfully the actual chocolate on top was not that sweet - more of that bittersweet chocolate used for baking so it complemented nicely with the sweetness.  Overall, great meal.  I would definitely try to go back for the brunch service since I saw a lot of nice reviews of the food.",0,0,0,Stefany W.,"Manhattan, NY",202,214,33

5.0,1/17/2016,"What a fantastic experience!! We came here for a friend's surprise birthday brunch on Sunday around 12:30pm. We were a party of 5 (remember that show?) with a vegan and a nut free allergy on board. Let's start with the parking situation. If you find yourself driving in NYC, this is a wonderfulplace to journey to. For start, there's a valet lot underneath the restaurant which is in a gorgeous building with sleek modern decor, right on the water called The Alexandria. If you eat at the restaurant they will validate your ticket and it will cost you a mere $5!!!! Say what?! Incredible! Everyone went above and beyond to make our visit a memorable one. From the parking attendant, security guard, hostess, coat check girl, waitress and busser. That's a lot of people making your meal and experience truly great. They were all incredibly sweet and all worth mentioning. We were seating in the gorgeous dining room and served cold carafes of water. The waitress cameover in seconds, greeted us and took drink orders. Mimosas with cognac ($11), Bloody Mary's with pickles carrots ($11) and I had the green lemonade ($7) which was cucumber, lemon and mint. So refreshing and clean. Apps & Sides: The waitress suggested the roasted radishes in anchovy butter ($8). They sounded delish but are obviously not vegan. She immediately went to kitchen and came back with a few vegan menu options for me including a way to make these without the butter. They were absolutely fantastic!! I could've eaten the entire plate myself. The hash browns ($6) with thyme, pepper and onions were s great selection as well. Fabulous taste and perfectly crispy. A friend ordered the burrata which was beautifully plated. For entrees the orders were grilled flatiron steak and eggs ($27), burgers ($18) with BBQ pickles , chicken and waffles (which apparently another house specialty-$22) with bourbon maple syrup and I had the braised chicken dish ($22) with acorn squash, roasted mushrooms, sage, pomegranate and freekeh which is a heartier grain like a farro. They so kindly substituted the chicken for grilled mushrooms!!! The special attention I was given was incredible. We were too full for dessert but they brought out one of their sorbets with a candle for the birthday girl. I would absolutely eat here again and highly recommend it. **only gripe was that the outdoor was closed off. I know it was January but I still wanted to take a look.

5.0,9/17/2015,"The mark of a great restaurant is one that makes a special occasion out of the everyday. Time and again, Riverpark exceeds that benchmark with ease. The restaurant, which is located about as far to the East Side as you can go without actually hitting the FDR Drive, sports what may be the warmest and most dedicated service in the city. Fred Jones, the service director, and his waitstaff seem to anticipate your needs before you know them. Take a recent brunch, for example: Jones stopped by every table within eyeshot, discussing eaters' selections, guiding them through the menu, and generally adding a personal touch to the service. When he reached my girlfriend and I, he realized I'd flown through a grapefruit-and-gin based cocktail. He deftly noticed my fondness for grapefruit, and suggested another off-the-menu libation that he thought I would like. He even brought one over for me to try on-the-house. It's not about the freebie, though -- it's about how nice it is for the service to transcend the oftentimes mechanical, transactional affair you so often find at restaurants of this caliber. The food, by the way, is terrific. The chefs have a particular affinity for cooking vegetables, something that is enhanced by the on-site urban garden. At first glance, the garden may seem a gimmick, but having met the gentleman in charge of the farm, it's clear the restaurant values the chef-farmer relationship. Beyond vegetables, meat and fish tend to be well prepared, and full of interesting contrasts. Standouts are a grilled octopus appetizer that's often on offer at dinner, and a double-thick Berkshire pork chop entree. At brunch, the cured salmon appetizer is outstanding, so too is grilled sea bream. Perhaps best of all, though, is a Wagyu pastrami Riverpark offered during a Summer 2015 cinema night in which the restaurant showed ""When Harry met Sally."" Desserts are another place Riverpark shines. Cereal & Milk is perhaps the biggest star. It's a playful and just-sophisticated enough play on the breakfast favorite. Oh, and it involves a dome of chocolate. On the lighter side, olive oil cake, which is often served with unique ice cream made with items from the garden, can be a nice way to finish a meal. Aside from the usual, Riverpark also offers a suite of interesting events. In addition to the previously-mentioned cinema night, my girlfriend and I have also attended a gardening workshop, which proved to be a fascinating way to spend a summer morning.",1,0,0,Adam S.,"Manhattan, NY",2,6,0

4.0,9/3/2015,"4.0Riverpark is a beautiful restaurant on the East River side.  The interior itself is beautiful with the large windows and the little lights dotting the ceiling.  There is a large patio to take in the view as well.We started with the prawns and the avocado hamachi.  Both dishes were excellent but the portion size was disappointingly small.  The flavors in both dishes were well thought out and delicious.  Unfortunately, the prawns numbered only two, they were on the small side and the avocado hamachi was just a dab.  At our table of 4, we only got a bite of each.For dinner, I went with the berkshire pork chop.  I'm not usually a pork chop person but since this is one of the signature dishes, I had to try it.  This pork chop was perfectly cooked.  It had  just the right amount of fat and the little crunchiness on the edges was great.  The chop was well sized and everything I hoped it would be.Service, while friendly, was lacking for this caliber restaurant.  We sat for about 20-25 minutes with menus closed hungrily waiting to place our order.  Our server was also no where to be found during the meal.  These lulls in service were disappointing and were distracting to the dinner.  I want to try another Colicchio restaurant but hope it will deliver more as a whole!",0,0,1,Sylvie S.,"Washington, DC",168,197,224

5.0,8/25/2015,"I need to get out and do fine dining more often. Especially if its as affordable and  delicious as it was at Riverpark spear headed by Tom Colicchio. My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and we knew we wanted to have an anniversary lunch and not dinner. So, I found and researched (on yelp), The Riverpark. When I saw how affordable the menu was I was sold. That and it was located by the water. I actually booked it through Open Table. The restaurant gave me a courtesy call they asked if I was celebrating a special occasion. I told them. We were running late but made it in time for the last seating for lunch.  They were very nice and the place wasn't very busy (it was the middle of the day on Tuesday) so, we had our choice to sit anywhere we wanted. Naturally, we chose outside facing the water. The view was beautiful. The seats were like couches and very comfortable. The wait staff was very attentive but not over bearing. When we received the menu my husband was just staring at it for a long time.  I though OMG the food is too expensive. I said, What? He showed me the menu and It had, Happy Anniversary Keith and Brigitte printed on the menu. The was so sweet and cute. What a great idea to honor a couple. And Honestly, the food could've tasted horrible after that but it didn't. The food was the icing on the cake. This was one of the best dining experiences I've has since living in NY for over 20 years. I know, I have to get out to do more fine dining.

Man how in the world do I still hear people bitching about Riverpark? Wow! Lol. Cook at home ass holes !The food is so NOT too salty or too plain. I would say it came out really really well. For people who says it was too salty, I guess u said ""just water~~""when the front of the house as u if u want something to drink, LOL. IF A CHEF IS COOKING WITH ORGANIC INGREDIENTS, THERE IS NO NEED FOR TOO MUCH SALT!!! guess u been eating McDonald's too often... ( and this is another reason why yelp review is getting so stupid, people don't know shit! )Most of the times a restaurant will give u some mediocre stuff on restaurant weeks for people who are too cheap to come on regular times, (Asians, this is why I say so many Asians) and site u by the bar or some secondary tables, but not Riverpark. I even asked for a regular menu but the guys says that they don't have one, the RW menu only. Cool! I like that! Me and my girl friend ordered every entrees on the menu and about 3 or 4 desserts.

Slightly disappointed because we were hoping to be seated outside with the view or inside against the window but instead we sat inside with a view of the bar. I ordered the Citrus Cured Salmon for appetizer. Personally, I thought the plate in general was too salty for me. I ended up eating just the salmon with my breadstick. For my main dish I got the Pork Loin. I also found this dish slightly too salty. Maybe it was the over flooding of the sauce on my plate. However, I still enjoyed the finish of the pork. I got the Olive Oil Cake because of the scoope of pistachio ice cream that came along with it. The cake is definitely a new flavor that many of you wont be familiar with.

Since there were about 16 of us there, we did the pre-fixe brunch menu where the appetizers and sides were all served family-style. We had the Cow's Milk Burratini and Grilled Bread & Avocado for starters. The Burratini was quite delicious since it was served on a bed of heirloom tomatoes and peaches. The Grilled Bread & Avocado was nothing special. I got the Fried Chicken & Waffles as my entree - the chicken was juicy but bland and the waffles were pretty hard. I tried my friend's Ricotta Pancakes, which were very fluffy but also, nothing too special.

The  manager John and the hostess made sure we had an excellent corner outdoor table and customized our menus for us.  As for the food, it was simply delicious.  Everything we ordered were great but the show stopper was the Buffalo's Milk Burrata served with Heirloom Tomatoes, Apricots, Peaches, Basil and Lemon Verbena.  For those not familiar with Burrata cheese, Burrata, is a fresh cheese made from a mix of mozzarella and cream. The outside thin shell is a pasta filata curd made of either buffalo and/or cow's milk (in this case Buffalo's) mozzarella while the insides contain a soft, doughy, stringy, mixture of curd and fresh cream.  This is a dish worth traveling this far east of the island for.For dessert, we got the Blueberry sundae and the famous ""Cereal & Milk"".  The Cereal Milk is a Chocolate Ganache Cake over Caramelized Rice Puffs and Vanilla Malt. Both were amazing but require an extra hour of gym time after consumption.

Food was brought out on time and water was refilled every so often.They also have a wonderful view.::Starter: Buffalo's Milk Burrata - 5 STARS I am glad I gave this a try. I typically hate cheese but this was amazing. I did confirm with the server and made sure that this tasted nothing like goat cheese before ordering it. (contains tomatoes, small pieces of peach, and best of all the burrataaaaa) The burrata was fresh and soft. Taste similar to mozzarella but burrata is way better. I poked it right in the middle and the liquid cheese in the middle came spilling out. :: Entree: Sea Bream 5 STARS (contains arugula and one of my favorites - zucchini) The sea bream was excellent. No bones. It was on point and moist. Skin was crisp. The grilled zucchini and arugula was flavored well. :: Dessert: Cereal & Milk 5 STARS ($5 supplement - worth it) Like the burrata the chocolate encasing the milk came rushing out when I poked into with my fork. I was sort of a surprised and excited at the same time. The chocolate case tastes similar to the chocolate in the haagen daz ice cream bars. I like that this dessert was not super sweet but just right. On the bottom of the chocolate case is a brownie like thing which also tasted very good. Tom Colicchio, you outdid yourself!

Had the rabbit, which had an excellent presentation, but taste didn't deliver as much as the visuals. Duck breast was succulent, also with great plating. Raw oysters for an appetizer were fresh. No complaints.Service [A+] Dining at ""fancy"" restaurants sometimes is determined more by the service received than the food itself. Just before I began enjoying my rabbit, I noticed something odd with my plate. A stray hair floating in the sauce. I must have had a very quizzical/disgusted look, because not a minute had passed when a random server asked me if everything was alright. I pointed at the hair and the plate was taken away with an apology. Soon after, the manager arrived and profusely apologized, asking if I would like to order anything else. I had intended on eating the rabbit from the get-go, so I stuck with the rabbit. A fresh new plate came out, sans hair, and I even think the rabbit portion was larger :) The manager swung by and asked if everything was to my satisfaction, and even let me know that my entree was on the house. For a restaurant at the level of T. Colicchio, aka Top Chef, I expected no less, but still it was quite the pleasant surprise. Superb in every sense of the word.Ambiance [A] The location of this establishment is superb. You get an excellent view of the river and the interior is decorated as heavily modern and sleek. Being right next to the street, however, can also be a damper as FDR can get quite busy at times so seating inside is preferred. Also, it's just one of the few ""fancy"" places I've been to where the restrooms are located outside the actual restaurant in the office building foyer, which isn't really a ding, but I've always found it strange.Excellent restaurant especially if you're craving some scenery while dining in NYC.",0,0,0,Andrew S.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,25,1

4.0,4/28/2015,"This is a beautiful restaurant, located in a fabulous building perched on the FDR drive with views of the East River and beyond.  Riverpark also maintains an air of exclusivity, located at the end of a gated private drive. Cabbies will be totally confused, but there is validated parking in the lower level of the building.  The magnificent bar is the centerpiece of the imposing room, but tables are placed to accommodate views, providing romance and comfort.  The lighting, fabrics, and color scheme make Riverpark one of the most decorous dining locations in the city.  The food is nice.  The menu items are announced and ""spelled out"" with aplomb and panache, but their preparation is indicative of a kitchen taking no risks.  The menu is the epitome of what a financially successful restaurant business plan would stipulate.  This is the Wharton School of Business restaurant model with Tom Colicchio as the professor.  Farm to table, that overused restaurant cliche, is mentioned repeatedly.  I almost expected a John Deere tractor to rumble through the room.  The servers made sure to mention the Riverpark farm which will be planted right outside the restaurant.  I, for one, never associated the East River with agriculture, but perhaps the chemicals in the soil will enhance the growth.  Giant carrots anyone?  Alice Walters should have to pay a fine for starting this farm to table obsession.  With 21st century overnight shipping, farm to table has become a marketing tool that stinks with ""politically correct"" entrapment.  I still wear leather thank you.  The menu has pasta, fish, and meat.  I'm sure it will change with the ""seasons,"" and what is ""fresh"" at the time.  You will not eat stale or rotten food at Riverpark.  This is a restaurant that is a perfect recommendation for tourists and diners who are not risk takers.  The location makes it feel ""special,"" and the food will not disappoint.  However, don't expect to be surprised at anything that emerges from the kitchen.  This is corporate dining at its finest.",0,0,0,Phil G.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",105,678,318

Bf and have always enjoyed Tom Colicchio, and moreover what he showcases for RW. Riverpark did not disappoint though it's not my best TC pick (that goes for Craft). The food here is still fiercely seasonal but the dishes are a global play - featuring preparations and ingredients from all cuisines.  I got the hamachi as my first choice ($5 supplement) I was let down. The yellowtail was a bit fishy and the pairings with parsnip and mustard didn't go. The pistachio was nice though. Bf had the burrata which was Buttery and pillowy in texture and taste and the sour green apples it paired with were awesome. They also had fantastic soft French mini baguettes with sea salt and butter and I drank a nice glass of peppery Gruner.  Bf was super happy they had his favorite beer on tap - seasonal nugget nectar. For dinner, I had the roasted chicken which seemed like a safe choice but it was out of this world. Perfectly cooked with crispy skin and juicy interior. The bird was well seasoned and came with delicious crispy spaetzle which was almost semi fried in chicken fat, crispy rosemary, parsnip and fresh cranberry.  Delicious and great portion too. Think bf was jealous, though his short Rib was also a standout. It wasn't as fork tender as others I've had but it wasn't mushy either. It had some bite to it and came with delicious gourd and hen of the wood mushrooms. Our server mentioned how much people like the duck. For dessert bf had the famous cereal milk, a dessert I liked better than I was expecting with a chocolate shell, which spouted sweet ""cereal milk"" which you cracked it and had a cake base, surrounded by rice puffs. Unique and delicious - coming from someone who doesn't like chocolate.  I had the olive oil cake which was olive oil-y but a tad too sweet and crumbly. The parsnip ice cream was good though. Our server also was great - polite, knowledgable, and made great recommendations. She rang in the wrong beer for bf at first but IIt was no big deal.

Perfect!).  The service was friendly and top notch, and you could tell that the organizers were into the event because they even put together a fun 80's commercial melange to entertain us prior to the movie.  Oh, and there was delicious popcorn -- with cheese and truffle oil.  All of this made up for a few small misses in the menu (the arugula puree served with the Pekin duck was a bit bitter, and they had not quite cooked off the alcohol in the baked Alaska, which I didn't mind because it reminded me of many a plum pudding attempted at my own house at Christmas).  Thanks, Riverpark, for a really fun night.  I've always been a fan of this restaurant and now would definitely recommend Sunday Night Cinema to others (they still have two more events coming up!)",1,0,0,Kelly D.,"New York, NY",1,70,3

3.0,2/27/2015,"We decided on Riverpark during RW*, and when arriving in the sleek lobby (which also awkwardly contains the restaurant's restroom) of the Alexandria (next to another Colicchio operation, 'Wichcraft), I figured the fact that the crops on Riverpark farm were covered would be made up for the beauty of ice floes across the FDR on the East River. Walked in and the only person visible was not a host(ess) but their coat check staffer, with the hostess kiosk hidden to your left. They basically accosted us for our coats, which was fine because they likely would've fallen off the extremely uncomfortable, low-backed chairs (we're both tall, so those with shorter torsos may have a different experience, but this was a bad start). Staff tried to seat us in the center of the space, far away from the window table we requested, so we pressed them and they obliged, which took quite some time given the lack of tables filled at 5:30. Staff was quite attentive, but it was still amazing but unsurprising to find the # of folks dedicated to the tables ordering booze, and the looks we got when we stuck with tap (they're one of those places that call if flat, which is infuriating, because carbonation can be added to water, not removed). That said, once the sun set and they lowered the lights, the sneers were a bit less salient.Even if it was more accessible** and warmer weather offered the option of eating outside, I wouldn't return to Riverpark -- big letdown, as I expected excellence and got mediocrity. Started with a warm and pretty good mini-baguette each and some butter in the center. When they asked if we could use more bread, my 'yes' with met with an 'of course, you cheapo' smile from our waiter -- body language was a bit condescending throughout the meal.Arctic Char Trio: Crudo & Meyer Lemon, Cured & Kumquat, Smoked & Blood Orange (rather than Squid Ink Chitarra, bad decision) -- disappointing, even when eaten left to right like they instructedSpiced Pekin*** Duck Breast: Red Wine-Poached Pears, Tokyo Turnips, Beluga Lentils, Arugula, Mustard Frills -- unevenly cooked, and thus hard to cut and chew, with awkward sauces and finnicky/unwieldy lentils but hit some good notes (rather than Shortrib or Skate)Cereal & Milk: Chocolate Ganache Cake, Caramelized Rice Puffs, Vanilla Malt ($5 supp****) -- the sole reason for a 3 rather than a 2, really unassuming but spectacular*It's been years since I dined at a RW spot during RW, but Amex $5 back was certainly one incentive.**There was an unmarked bus in the traffic circle when we exited, but we just walked to the subway, unsure of its purpose or eligibility requirements.***as in American Pekin duck en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am… , not Chinese Pekin[g] duck****they web-hid normal menu but some digging revealed the $5 supplement exceeded the price differential compared to the other desserts, but worth it nonethelessMovie night sounds awkward",1,4,0,George C.,"New York, NY",0,7747,14304
4.0,2/25/2015,"Came here for restaurant week 2015 and had an amazing experience. Located on the East end of Manhattan, Riverpark oversees the East River and you get a great view (especially at night) along with a phenomenal meal. From appetizer to dessert, the portions were just right and at the end of the meal, I definitely felt satisfied and full.For appetizers, I got the baby octopus while my friend got the squid ink pasta. The baby octopus was tender and went very well with the winter squash. As for the squid ink pasta, there definitely was a strong lemon taste to it but as a lemon lover, I thought the pasta was great as well. Spaghetti was cooked al dente.For mains, I got the Spiced Peking Duck Breast (medium rare) and my friend got the Diver Scallops & Pork Belly. The duck is very tender and pairing with cranberry gave it a light sweet taste that didn't feel too much. It was cooked perfectly; not dry at all and very tender. Definitely would recommend the duck for first-timers. As for the scallops & pork belly .. the scallops were great. Especially as someone who isn't a big fan of scallops, the scallops were done greatly. My friend enjoyed the pork belly really much, however, being very sensitive to the taste and smell of pork, the pork belly for me wasn't done good enough to completely rid of the pork smell. It was a little dry and not on point for me. For dessert, I got the cheesecake while my friend got their ""Cereal and Milk"" which is one of their signature desserts. Not being a very big fan of cheesecake, I LOVED theirs. It wasn't heavy, and the Meyer Lemon Granita went greatly with the cheesecake. The cereal and milk was very interesting and would definitely recommend it to try as it IS their signature dish and it's unique. In the end the cereal and milk got a little too sweet for me but definitely still great!Overall, it was a great experience, great food, and if it wasn't for restaurant week, I would've never thought to have travel all the way on to East end to dine.

The lentils were cooked just right; tasted good, but nothing extraordinary. Mascarpone Cheesecake: Simple yet luxurious. It has a slightly stronger cheese taste than other cheesecakes I've had, but it was wonderful. I have to say, the pistachios with the cheesecake, created this amazing flavor.

4.0,11/25/2014,"LOCATIONThe restaurant is really far east, basically adjacent to the river. You will pass a security guard/stand, and you will see a loop and what looks like a large corporate office. There is a sign that says Riverpark in the front, so you'll know that you have arrived. Once inside the building, there is a security desk, where you can ask where the restaurant is. (It's located in the very back, to the right of the spiral staircase). The restrooms are also in this general lobby area, next to the security guard.Besides the location confusion, this place was amazing. The view was stunning, especially on a beautiful sunny weekend day, and the bar area is beautifully lit. The 3 of us were sat at a table that had a couch and two chairs, which prompted us to linger and talk for awhile... which I NEVER do.FOODBrunch is really affordable here. For such a beautiful restaurant, I expected to pay at least $20 per dish, but ended up paying $20 total (+ tip!).Chicken and waffles: These waffles were amazing. The texture and shape of the waffles were very unique and perfectly complemented the fried chicken. The chicken was peppered very well, but wasn't as moist as I'd like it to be. But, I drenched some syrup all over it and forgot that it wasn't that soft.Breakfast tacos: The tacos had house made chorizo on them, and my friends really loved this dish. They came with a side of arugula, which added a light complement while I was pigging out and stuffing my face with fried chicken.SERVICEOur server was impeccable. He was very charming and nice, and when we asked him to take pictures of us (like the obnoxious instagramming girls we are) he made sure to take many angles and zoomed in and out for our viewing pleasures. It was hilarious.",10,5,6,Sophie P.,"Boston, MA",1036,408,1746
4.0,11/8/2014,"Great food. Great service. Beautiful atmosohere. Took my girl here for a bday dinner and wasn't disappointed.  Started off with half a dozen oysters which weren't the biggest but the quality was superb. For the main course we both had the short rib which was cooked to perfection,  didn't even need a knife. And bought a side order of Brussel sprouts and fingerling potatoes.  The Brussel sprouts were amazing (first time I've had Brussel sprouts) but the potatoes were bland and need seasoning. I informed the staff prior to coming that it was my girls bday.  They were very attentive to that fact. The wait staff all said happy bday and for dessert the chef wrote a nice happy birthday on the plate. Not to mention they also gave us a free dessert which is always a plus.

And every time the hostess dealt with me patiently. So thanks :)The menus were customized and said my parents name at the top. They were SO happy. What a unique touch! On to the food. We had brunch. I'm listing the food in order of yumminess:1. Ricotta toast with strawberry jam- hot damn. So so so good. I ordered this as my ""entree"" because I wasn't thaaaat hungry and let me tell you, it was divine. This is what I'll be getting next time.2. Steak and eggs- what a GORGEOUS plate. The steak melts in your mouth and the veggies are sooo fresh (they grow their own stuff!)3. Oysters- super fresh, a little pricey. The sauce is bomb.4. Corn ice cream- had such an authentic corn flavor and wasn't very sweet at all. It was awesome. 5. Breakfast sandwiches- good but nothing to die for. The pork belly was a cool touch.6. Other desserts- the strawberry basil cream puff was eh.... A little to sour for my taste. And the sorbets were pretty good, but nothing out of this world. **but really, order anything- it WILL taste good.Also I really liked our waiter.

I know there's no such word as ""bestest"", but that IS what describes Naomi B. and Riverpark.Their flavorful chicken and waffle is made with crispy perfection. The amount of spice that they add isn't too salty or peppery for my taste. There's a hint of rum in it's syrup, which I didn't realize until the last time (3rd time) I had it.

4.0,8/25/2014,"We came here for dinner before and really enjoyed it, over the weekend we came from brunch and had a great time but the food was NOT as amazing as dinner. Firstly, the brunch menu seemed pretty limited. My husband had the steak and egg and I had the eggs fritata with summer squash and we got a green salad for the table. The salad was very colorful and flavorful, the plate looked like an art composition and it really represents to me the best of farm to table cooking. Fresh, seasonal and delicious. but its mostly lettuces and really not filling. the steak and egg while good was quite small for my husband so we needed  bread for the table as well. I really didn't like the frittata, the bottom was burned the squash flowers on top were nice but the eggs themselves were not that flavorful. The drinks were great, my husband enjoyed his cocktail and I really loved the bellini, this is the way a bellini should taste. Must mention the staff - very professional and very well trained. the decor is very beautiful and the view of the river is incredible.

4.0,8/20/2014,"Came here for a Friday dinner. Reservations were plentiful on OpenTable, so I snagged one the day before. I had heard good things about Riverpark, although my experience at Craft was just meh. When we were walking towards the restaurant, we felt like it was a whole different neighborhood, being that far east in Murray Hill.The weather was warm with a bit of a breeze, so we opted to eat in the outside dining area. The tables outside are basically ""nicer"" picnic tables, which actually gave the outside area a ""park"" feel. The view outside was very nice, although some may not like the sound of cars on the FDR being right next to you. I didn't mind, and it definitely didn't take away from the experience. The ambiance is definitely pretty intimate and dark, perfect for a date, and the decor overall is very modern and elegant.We ordered a few appetizers: the grilled quail, the baby octopus, and the ceviche.  I got the Berkshire pork chop (I almost typed out ""pork shop"", can you even imagine?). The quail was cooked just right, although very miniscule, even for an appetizer portion. The baby octopus was great, and the vinaigrette had a very interesting flavor. The ceviche was a bit disappointing, because even though the flavors were great, the texture was a bit too oily.The pork chop was delicious, although for such a huge plate, the portion didn't look very big. Besides that though, the presentation was great, and the flavors from the peaches, and onions were all tasty. I also tried the the squid ink chitarra, which was awesome. The chiles and the richness of the sauce made for a great contrasting flavor. The smoked lamb cavatelli was very flavorful and smokey, although my friend thought the actual pasta was slightly off-putting as the cavatelli resembled little caterpillars. HAH.The waitstaff was incredibly professional, while still friendly and grounded. Water and drink refills came very quickly and our waiter was very patient with explanations and modifications.I'll definitely be back for a dinner date night, or a brunch with friends.

Crostini served with the excellent salmon were inedible. They would have done better to serve rye or pumpernickel toast points.

Unfortunately they refuse to honor that for me for the supplement charge. They also ran out of the rabbit pasta when I arrived sigh, had my head set on that.. So my server did  recommended the risotto which was just okay. Another thing is the service I received from my first server, rude vibe and didn't check up on us or anything.Overall I loved how everything on the plate compliments each other.

She cleaned her plate so I would guess the panna cotta was also good lol. I had the Roasted Spiced Cobia for an entree. Now cobia is a fish I love that I wish I would see more on menus. I loved how the spice blend didn't overpower the fish. Whoever was on that line that night I love you. She had the squash pasta which I stole a few bites from.

Thank you, angel, for enlightening me to this dish. It was the greatest fish I've ever tasted. The top was crispy and the fish was well cooked. Tomato consomme was delicious!

4.0,8/3/2014,"My second restaurant week review, and my opinion has improved! Again there was great service and again I thought the menu had many great options. This time I was much happier with my dishes.I started with the house cured Atlantic salmon, which is a fairly simple dish.  It was somewhat generously salted, but that only encouraged me to eat their bread, which is quite good.  I also enjoyed the slightly briney cucumbers.For my main course I ordered the merluza, which is a white fish served with heirloom tomatoes and faro.  At the tableside, tomato consumme is poured on top.  I really loved this dish. It was light, fragrant, and perfect for summer.  The tomatoes provided a lovely accompanying acidity to the flakey fish and the texture of the faro was on point. There was nothing to complain about.For my dessert, I considered trying the peach cobbler, but I had so enjoyed the basil cream puffs with raspberry sorbet he last time I was here that I wanted to order it again. It did not disappoint.The service here is very warm and the seating area outside is beautiful. Even when it is hot out, the breeze coming off the water and the shade from the building keeps you cool.

My husband had the salmon for appetizer (absolutely delicious), the Berkshire pork chop for entree, super juicy and tender and flavor was perfect.  He ended with the basil cream puff, which was delicious as well.  I had the corn salad panna cotta for appetizer, which had a beautiful presentation and very refreshing taste.  For entree, I got the lamb chop and sausage, which I thought the flavor was a bit to strong for me.  The portion was quite small, and although I didn't mind that, it seems like there is nothing on the plate to balance out the strong taste of the lamb.  Everything else on the plate was part of the sauce, so equally salty.  If I knew the entree would be like that, I would order a side of mash potatoes or veggie to balance it out.  But overall, the flavor was good, just a bit too heavy by itself.  For dessert, I got the raspberry cobbler.  I enjoyed the ice cream that was pair with the cobbler more.  My husband did like it cuz he is more of a heavy dessert type of person.  I do think that all three of my husband's choices were better than mine.  Perhaps if I ordered what he did, I would be more satisfied.  Overall, I think Riverpark is a fine restaurant, and they always put a lot of thoughts and effort into each dish.",0,0,0,L Y.,"San Francisco, CA",25,48,15
4.0,7/30/2014,"This review is based on Riverpark's Restaurant Week prix fixe menu at $25/person. The location and restaurant are lovely, and the service is quite good. For starters, I had the cured Atlantic salmon, and my husband had the gazpacho. The salmon was satisfactory, but my husband's gazpacho was my favorite bite on our whole NY trip. Rich, flavorful, light. Fantastic.I ordered the prawns, and I was disappointed in the portion. I think I got four prawns; maybe five. The prawns in the light broth were delicious, I just wish there had been more. I was especially left hungry because the bitterness of the Shishito peppers and radish that accompanied the prawns did not pair well with the sweetness of the prawns. The pairing did not work well for me.The menu online lists artisanal cheeses as an option for the dessert course for a $3 supplement; however, the wait staff were unaware of that and said that the restaurant did reserve the right to change the menu, and that they didn't have anything prepared. A bit of a disappointment.The portion size and strangeness of the bitter element in my main course, as well as the unavailability of the cheese plate were missteps. However, the setting is relaxing, and the gazpacho and prawn in broth were two delicious bites. You also can't beat the price. A lovely way to spend your lunch.",1,0,0,Mary H.,"Los Angeles, CA",268,147,187
5.0,7/30/2014,"As the aforementioned partner of Ron H, I wholeheartedly agree with his five-star review, particularly in light of the cost--starters and mains can run $20 each, so their RW lunch is a good value.I would add just a couple things:The portions are generous, particularly the pork dishes. You can see photos of the RW lunch menu on the web, but sometimes artfully plated food is tiny food, and prix fixe menus at substantial discounts can verge on the microscopic.  Measly portions were not a problem with any of our choices--especially the pork terrine and the pork loin, so bring an appetite!If you're disappointed that the signature Milk and Cereal dessert isn't on the menu, just ask.  The chef gladly prepared it for a diner nearby for a small supplement ($2, I think).  In fact, don't hesitate to ask for anything--our server delivered an individual pepper mill and a bottle of hot sauce to a table nearby without batting an eye.  (Both were applied in liberal doses to a pasta dish AND a bloody mary....)We had a 12:30 reservation, and there was a good selection of tables on the patio or indoors with a view of the river or the ""farm.""  By 1:00, the inside tables were quite full, and the only outdoor seating was at larger picnic-style tables.  (Bench seating with sometimes more than one party sharing a table, just so you know.)At any rate, if you're planning to have a later lunch, you might want a reservation (they use OpenTable or you can call directly).  If you're not picky about where you sit, they were accommodating walk-ins fairly quickly--so just go!",1,0,1,Cheri F.,"Ithaca, NY",1,18,0
5.0,7/30/2014,"Review for lunch during NY Restaurant Week - $25 / person prix fixe menuEverything about our experience was excellent. Location was an easy walk from the 6 train 28th St station and the weather was beautiful. Attentive and very friendly staff, no snobbery in the least, stylish decor, excellent and interesting food. It's worth noting that Riverpark offers everything from their regular lunch menu as part of the Restaurant Week lunch special, with only a couple items having a small supplemental charge. (And frankly if you look through the RW web site you'll see many restaurants tacking on a lot more supplemental charges than Riverpark does, and for less interesting dishes.)My partner had sweet corn panna cotta (a deconstructed spread including avocado, micro-cilantro, lime creme fraiche - and huitlacoche!), and the sea bream (perfectly grilled, over quinoa with delicately prepared thin slices of squash and peppers), both full of bright interesting tastes and textures. I ordered the pork terrine (with baby mustard greens, pistachios, and black raspberry mustard) and pork loin (moistest and tenderest pork I have ever eaten, period, enhanced with caramelized peaches and onions, accompanied by melt-in-your-mouth collard greens full of crispy bits of panchetta), also quite interesting, a deeper taste range than what my partner had ordered, so an interesting contrast.For dessert we shared our two choices: Peach blueberry cobbler with lemon verbena ice cream, crazy good, as were the basil cream puffs with strawberry sorbet.We felt very lucky to have gotten such interesting and innovative meals for such an affordable price.",2,0,0,Ron H.,"Ithaca, NY",23,24,1
5.0,7/27/2014,"We had the $25 lunch during Restaurant Week.  RP is a awesome sight/site.  High tech chrome everywhere, sweeping architecture, waterview (even if Long Island City and over FDR Drive), user friendly furniture, roomy and not cramped, comfy waiting area, and equally exciting outdoor dining.   Hostess was pleasant and efficient.  Reservation timely honored.  The eye-popping décor did not end with the hardware.  Colicchio or his fashion coordinator deserves supreme praise for dressing his wait staff in gray check shirts with matching gray aprons, and either red or black tie and charcoal trousers.  In the ""hip"" food service industry black is apparently the ""new"" black and was vomit-inducing boring even in the 90s. (guess black restaurant apparel needs to be laundered less?) Our appetizers were corn panna cotta with lime crème fraiche in a vinaigrette which was interesting because of its diverse flavors, and pork terrine with raspberry mustard and nuts, plain good eating made sublime by the intoxicatingly pleasant aroma of the slightly burned bread.  Each diner received a salted mini-baguette with a skimpy portion of butter, but refills were timely served; these were among the best baguettes we've ever eaten.  Mains were:  sea bream pan fried, and lamb ribs and sausage.  3  fishy tasting pieces of bream seared nicely.  3 lamb ribs with ample fall off the bone meat, but only a single tasty lamb sausage slice.  Ribs were in a complementary mild sauce--not salty, not sweet, faintest tart flavor.  Desserts were cream puffs (2) that grabbed the taste buds with the oodles of basil filling, and a peach blueberry cobbler.  Coffee extra ($3).  Michigan wine was least expensive at $10.  Restrooms on the same floor but outside the restaurant in the lobby and only 2 stalls.  A truly exquisite dining experience overall.",3,0,0,Chris L.,"New York, NY",5,117,27
4.0,7/26/2014,"Summer Restaurant Week!I came here for a goodbye lunch since I have a friend that's moving out of state. The service was superb with everyone from the greeter to the busboy being very attentive and informed about the menu. The ambiance was muted since we were seated outside on a cloudy day. It's at a plaza along the river so I had an interesting view of the construction going on on the other side. If you can get a seat inside, that might be better even if it's harder to hear your companions talk.App: Sweet Corn Panna Cotta. The presentation was beautiful with each individual ingredient being showcased on the plate, but made mixing the flavors difficult since I basically had to assemble the parts into a whole. I was pleasantly surprised at how light the corn flavor was in the panna cotta since it mixed beautifully with whatever other ingredients I paired it with.Entree: Cavatelli. I'm a sucker for rabbit so when I saw it with pasta, it was a no brainer for me. The pasta itself was slightly undercooked but still edible so I didn't bother sending it back. There was a good amount/ratio of the golden raisins, capers, and pistachios. I liked that the capers weren't too salty as they often are. I was sad though because the fennel that dusted the top got blown away by the wind almost immediately.Dessert: Peach-Blueberry Cobbler with Lemon Verbena Ice Cream. Delicious! The ice cream was actually better than the cobbler imo. It was silky and flavorful; it made me want an entire pint of the stuff. The pieces of fruit in the cobbler were soft but still retained its shape. And the crumb topping was so good!Overall, I'd come here again for a special occasion, but for right now I'll frequent the place during Restaurant Week!",1,0,0,Kimberly C.,"San Marino, CA",28,405,176

4.0,7/18/2014,"We attended a private brunch for a friend's birthday at Riverpark and it was lovely. We started off with breakfast cocktails and pastries on the outdoor patio overlooking the East River. When the guest of honor arrived, we moved inside to a private dining area. I cannot say enough about the service. The moment a glass was empty or near-empty, someone would notice and either promptly refill water or ask if another drink was needed. Because of this, I lost track of how many mimosas I had during our brunch! I did try a bloody Mary at one point as well, but it just tasted like blended vegetables with vodka. There was no salt or tang or anything. Not my fave. There was a set menu with three courses, all served family style. The first course was a lovely summer salad with delicious vegetables from the farm on location. Also, avocado on toast. Sounds simple, tastes amazing. I'm really hoping my fiancé makes good on his word to ""try it at home."" The next course was biscuits and eggs with sausage gravy, fried chicken and waffles, and sausage. The presentation of that fried chicken and waffles was pretty impressive. It looked absolutely delicious, but... I thought the chicken could have used some salt. The gravy for the eggs and biscuits was just okay. We finished up with a round of cupcakes. At that point, I was stuffed, so I mostly just ate the icing off of a red velvet cake. Tasty. We were all sent home with little bags of chocolate, which was a nice touch. I would definitely recommend Riverpark for a private event - they did an excellent job.

4.0,6/22/2014,Had a lovely brunch at Riverpark. They sat us outside at a table along the river. The weather was perfect and so was the view. We started out with the avocado spread and toast. The spread was the perfect amount of salty and rich and the toast was golden and crispy. I ended up ordering the pork-belly breakfast sandwich. It was so delicious I cannot really even describe how good it really was. It had an amazing tangy sauce and a small amount of scallions to compliment the pork.

5.0,6/19/2014,"Okay, first off, lets be straight, this place is a bit pretentious, and takes itself a little seriously. There's an urban garden there, but it definitely keeps its urban upscale sensibilities. Our waiter, who was fantastic, described the spring onion soup as a ""deconstructed french onion."" In general, I'm opposed to describing anything as deconstructed, but the soup was hearty and delicious. The view and environment was great, as long as you don't mind the FDR. I embrace the contrast between the river, and this calm restaurant, knowing that the city is still going. I had the rabbit, which was done about 4 or 5 different ways. There was a BBQed thigh, a fried leg, and a loin stuffed with a carrot puree. You also get this tiny rabbit loin rack. Which is the tiniest rack you have ever seen. It was two little meat lollipops that were a single small bite, but it was great. I couldn't help but laugh when I told the waiter how fantastic it was, and found that the second piece of the rack on the other side of the plate and was told ""you get the full rack."" Mind you, the ""full rack"" is about the size and girth of two of my pinky finger joints. Despite my good humor, and amusement at the silliness (but deliciousness) of this tiny meat morsel, all I could get from the waiter was an admission that it was a ""tiny animal."" I had the milk and cereal for dessert, which was a hard chocolate ganache dome, filled with vanilla malt, perched on top of a chocolate cake, and surrounded by rice crispies. Basically, you crack the dome, the malt spills out soaking the crispies and the cake, and you just sop it all up with your spoon. Delicious and amazing.

Sadly almost everyone at the table - all 20+ of us - was disappointed. Although we had a reservation at 2:45 on a Sunday and the restaurant was pretty much empty except for our large party they did not know how to handle a large party. Food came out cold? Not sure how that happens if the restaurant is empty. Salad was bland.  Also, although it was a 3 course brunch menu - all of the portions were tiny and really not that great. When the best thing we tasted was salted avocado and bread - I knew we made the wrong choice. The portions were tiny - and our guests were European - and they still thought the portions were tiny. To the point that half of the table ordered french fries after all 3 courses. They brought out the dessert with the entrees. It just seemed rushed and overall very disappointed with this restaurant.

Rocco came by our table several times to chat and has the natural ability to make you feel like you've known him forever.  Because we were on vacation and live in a state experiencing our worst drought in recorded history, we were unprepared to return to our hotel in a thunderstorm, and Rocco made sure we were able to get a cab and get to our hotel without drowning.  Absolutely my favorite dining experience ever!",0,0,0,Kathleen F.,"San Marcos, CA",8,23,1

We got a dozen of oysters: both east coast and west coast. They were both really good, fresh and firm. We also got the baby octopus, salmon tartare, and the avocado himachi. The baby octopus was grilled perfectly, and had a bit of the char from the grill coated on the skin; when you but into it, it had the rubbery consistency but also had a little crunch to it. The avocado himachi was also delicious and plated beautifully.For the entrees, we got the dorade, squid ink pasta, and ravioli. The pastas were good, but a small portion is more than plenty if you're ordering appetizers. I ordered the dorade and was also impressed. It hardly had any bones, and retained a lot of juice from the fennel that was packed inside when cooked.

4.0,3/27/2014,"I've eaten here a couple times. Once for RW lunch and another when a pharmaceutical rep graciously paid for dinner. The RW lunch was mediocre. Based solely on that experience, I would have to give this place 3 stars. However, the dinner I recently had here was much more enjoyable. No doubt, most of that enjoyment likely stems from it being gratis, but the food was undeniably great.I started with the hamachi and avocado appetizer which was good. I wish there had been more hamachi on it though. There was an entire half of an avocado on the plate which made the ratio a bit unbalanced. It wasn't the best I've ever had but certainly not bad.For my entree, I had the monkfish. The waiter actually made a mistake and forgot my order, so in the end, my dish was comped - not that it really mattered to me anyhow. The monkfish itself was delicious. I'm not going to go into what was in it or even attempt to describe what it tasted like. With dishes at these fine dining establishments, there are so many ingredients and techniques that go into each dish, it would take a true masochist to try to accurately describe each and every one. So it suffices to say - DAYUM, shit was good.For dessert we had this crazy ass concoction that was a chocolate dome filled with vanilla sauce. As soon as you broke the shell with your spoon, the shocking whiteness of the vanilla flowed out over the entire plate. I was really surprised as I had no idea this would happen. You almost feel guilty for breaking such a well crafted structure and making a total mess, but it's the kind of guilt that brings you pleasure, if you know what I mean. Anyways, remorse aside, once you taste it, all regrets will immediately dissipate.This is an overall decent restaurant with good service and nice ambience. The only gripe I have is that I wish they would keep their butter at room temperature so that it's spreadable. I hate it when restaurants give you cold hard butter and you're forced to spread entire globs of it on your roll and you end up eating like 1000 calories just from the butter itself.

Food:  I was a little disappointed with the  food.  Not that it was bad...I had the beef medallions medium rare and they lacked flavor and that wonderful feeling you get when you bite into a perfect piece of meat.  Even the mixed green  salad could of used a much more interesting and flavorful vinaigrette.

4.0,3/8/2014,"Riverpark  Why it is so underrated? Ambiance:  Very quiet and private... something you don't get much in NYC. It wasn't very crowded but there were still a fair amount of people that night. It was a mixed crowd with the majority vote going to the ""younger set"". The interior goes a long way in giving this place its charm.  The bar/lounge area has really great lighting and there are plenty of great views of the East River especially in the evening.   If you are searching for a good restaurant with a great view for that special occasion, a romantic dinner, a first date or you just want to have a fine dining experience this is definitely the place for you.    Food: The dinner was outstanding!  I was a little worried about the ""food experience"".  When I made the reservation the Zagat food rating was just 24!   I completely disagree with this rating!  Cucine called the food type New American with a Chilean influence.  I also want to mention that the wine list features a very good variation of Chilean wineries which most of the time are a great choice.   My friend and I had octopus and Buratta for appetizers.   Buratta doesn't require much cooking time but has to be fresh and fresh it was!  Preparing octopus however is not that easy.  Our octopus was really good and I would ""put it up against"" any Greek prepared octopus. The middle course was buckwheat spaghetti which was simple and delicious or simply delicious.   For my main course I had the bronzini fish.  It was one of the best bronzini I have ever had!  It was fresh, perfectly cooked and had a unique flavor the chef created specifically for this dish.  My friend had rabbit.  He is always ""hopping around"" so I thought that would be a good choice for him. They served it as a combination dish with the rabbit prepared three different ways.  I am not the best judge of rabbit but my friend gave it the ""rabbit paws up""!  He finished the entire plate.  Service:  Service was very good.  He timed our meal perfectly.  The waiter was friendly and knowledgeable.  I just had a feeling that the rest of the serving staff was or either relatively new or ""in training"".  They needed to develop more of a teamwork flow.  This is not a complaint but more if a personal observation. Conclusion: I will definitely come back to this restaurant and of course recommend this place to my friends. I'm just surprised on how ""underrated"" this restaurant is.  I hope it will change soon or maybe not.  If it does become too popular I won't be able to get a table!  Good Luck!",0,0,0,Anna M.,"New York, NY",2,13,1

It was a bit of a hike for us, since we live deep in the heart of Hells Kitchen, but it was easy enough to get here. We just took the E to the 6 and enjoyed to 10ish minute walk to Riverpark. I would love to come back to this restaurant once it's nice out. It's located right along the East River with a beautiful view of the Queens skyline. The inside of the restaurant was very nice. The lights were dimmed, the colors were subdued. It created a relaxing, casual but still elegant atmosphere. We arrived about 20 minutes early for our reservation and had a glass of wine at the bar. The viognier was delicious if you like crisp, sweet wines. We were seated right at the time of our reservation. Our server was pleasant and knowledgeable of the menu. Here is the rundown of what we ordered: mushroom consumee-mild but with a tangy, earthy pop. It was nice and light. A perfect first course. Buckwheat spaghetti with cauliflower-so very good! A pretty decent-sized portion for a first course. My husband was afraid he'd be full after eating it. We both had the Berkshire pork chop-can I please eat this everyday?! Ordered medium, it was perfectly seasoned, the brussel sprout-apple hash was out of this world, especially considering brussel sprouts are my favorite veggie and in my opinion, underutilized in most cuisine. Cereal & milk-worth the $3 upcharge. Hard to explain, it's one of those desserts you just need to experience. Overall, we had a fantastic meal, drinks, and service at Riverpark.

The reginetti had excellent flavors and an interesting past texture.  The ricotta cheese and pumpkin seeds really added some flavor.  For my main course, I was surprised by the sheer size of the portion of the pork chop.  I cannot say this was the es pork chop I have had.  It was cooked a bit more well done when I asked for medium rare.  Dessert...oh Cereal and Milk. What a deceptively simple name but a truly decadent dessert.  There was a rich chocolate cake surrounded by rice puffs better known as rice krispies.  Atop the cake was a chocolate ganache bomb filled with sweetened cream.  The rice puffs gave the dish a very interesting crunch.  I would love to go back when I have not had soooo much to eat for my entree and try that again.",0,0,0,Linda M.,"New Brunswick, NJ",396,680,1073

4.0,2/17/2014,"My boyfriend and I went for lunch at  Riverpark today for restaurant week and were very impressed with our meals. The location was a little difficult to find, but once we were among the right buildings, the riverpark sign was prominent enough for us to find our way.The decor is simple but relaxed modern--not overly fussy as some more upscale restaurants are, but still classy and well lit with big open windows overlooking the water. Even though we arrived 20 minutes early, we were promptly seated by the very friendly hostess and waiter. Now on to the food! For starters, I had the duck liver pate, and my boyfriend ordered the house-cured arctic char. My pate was incredibly creamy, with a perfect balance of sweet and salty. There was also a beautiful thin gelatin layer at  the top along with a couple of pine nuts fresh rosemary. The accompanying sauce was nice as well, a mild creamy green sauce with notes of pine nuts. Along with the toasted bread and small citrus salad on the side to scoop up the pate, I was off to a delicious start. I can't speak too much for the arctic char as I only had a bite or two, but it was beautifully plated and cut. Fresh fish with the greens, hints of dill, acid, and salt complimented the fish really well. My boyfriend enjoyed it a lot.For entrees I ordered the roasted berkshire pork loin, and my boyfriend the smoked leg of lamb. My pork loin was good, although I wish the pork was tad more juicy. There was a deep purple beet sauce swooping off the side, with roasted onions, brussels sprouts, apples, and sage. The onions could have been roasted more, but all in all it was very good. My favorite part was probably the sage. It was flash fried! It looked beautiful and added a nice layered subtlety to the dish. The smoked leg lamb is actually a ""build your own sandwich"" of sorts, with some pickled carrots, onions and peppers, and savory pancakes similar to Chinese scallion pancake (minus the scallions). Individually the elements were good and not great, but when put together, the flavors melded together well. The lamb had good texture and paired nicely with the crispy golden pancake.For dessert we had the meyer lemon tart and the apple tarte tatin. I went in not expecting too much out of dessert because none of the descriptions excited me, but the meyer lemon tart was unexpectedly delicious. The earl gray ice cream was floral without being overbearing. The lemon tart was more sweet than sour, but struck the right balance. When paired with the ice cream and the smoky black sesame meringue, it was perfect. The apple tarte tatin was more predictable, but delicious as well.

4.0,2/13/2014,"After a less-than-stellar Restaurant Week dinner this past season at another one of Tom Colicchio's other establishments, I wasn't expecting much more from his other creations. As luck would have it, a  friend of mine decided to hold his birthday dinner at Riverpark, but I arrived with an open mind. The restaurant is somewhat difficult to get to since it's at the eastern edge of Manhattan on East 29th Street.  On a breezy Sunday evening, I passed by Riverpark Farm, where they grow their own vegetables to use in the kitchen and a miniature park of sorts, complete with trees, park benches, and plenty of foliage, especially for Manhattan.The restaurant shares a building with several other companies, but the Riverpark sign is displayed prominently outside. My friends and I headed indoors where we were greeted by the hostess and shown to our seats. Not only do they have a wonderful outdoors environment, they've nailed the interior structure and decor on the head. Dim lighting, with rows of lights dotting the high ceiling, are above the main bar area. The dining tables are elegantly set and well-spaced, and there are tables outside, where diners can enjoy a candlelit dinner with a spectacular waterfront view.The menus are simple and straightforward, which is usually a good thing in my experience; this indicates the chef understands what the kitchen does well and what the clientele enjoys. Our table of four decided to split a few ""Snack"" plates from the Bar Menu, and we each opted for our own Main Course and Dessert. The French Fries, Empanadas, and Rosemary Chips weren't particularly memorable, but they're solid bites to accompany a drink or two at the start of the evening.My entree, on the other hand, was nothing short of delicious. I had settled on the Berkshire Porkchop, and agreed to a medium sear at the suggestion of the waitress. The porkchop itself was a sizable portion of meat, and the overall composition had a good balance of lean to slightly fatty. It was topped with several slices of grilled peach, and layered on a bed of collard greens and onion, which completed this dish beautifully. The plate was savory, tender, and simple - the basic ingredients and flavors truly shined through. Even to this day, I can remember it with remarkable clarity; for this dish alone, I would make a return trip to the restaurant.I finished off dinner with a Chocolate-Caramel Tart. A scoop of caramel ice cream, next to a small tart comprised of melted dark chocolate and peanuts, with a few popcorn kernels drizzled in caramel. My only complaint? I wished there were more of it. The ice cream melted a bit too quickly for my liking, but the basic pairing of chocolate and caramel is almost foolproof.Service throughout the night was attentive without being overbearing, and our waitress didn't try to force on drinks and extra sides. In hindsight, I'm very grateful to my friend for showing me that second chances are worth taking; Riverpark is one of the successes in Colicchio's empire.",3,1,1,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

I can't remember what we ordered the last time, but this time I had the avocado and hamachi to start and he had the Buffalo's milk burrata. Eh. The flavors just did not work at all for me. I particularly did not like the charred chile flavor--it did not work at all with the yellowtail. The boy thought the cheese was okay.For our entrees we split the rabbit and the whole wheat reginetti with fall squash pesto, pumpkin seeds and basil (ricotta on the side). They put parmesan on top, which wasn't on the menu and which I do not like. I wasn't in the mood to send it back, so I just picked off the top pieces, but I had when restaurants do this. A good restaurant would have noted that I requested the ricotta on the side and not added parmesan  without asking. Either way-- I did not love the pasta. I thought it was a little over cooked and the flavors weren't exciting. If you want good reginetti, I HIGHLY recommend going to North End Grill. The rabbit was the one good part of the meal.

Was here for a company event and the highlight of my night was the staff and creme brulee. Both were awesome. Now for the downside. All the food came out cold and tasteless! You should really leave salt and pepper on the table for that reason. Pasta with squash? Interesting but still no taste. Lamb was cooked well, but plain. My husband's on the other hand, was tough and chewy. Still plain. The coffee during dessert was lukewarm and that didn't help being in a freezing dining room already on a cold rainy winter night.

Entrees were the pork chop and the steak two ways. The pork chop was quite large and served with smoked pork belly over it and sauteed greens.  Very well prepared and full of flavor.  There were grilled peaches over the pork as well which were a touch too smoky for me.  The steaks were a waygu beef brisket and a flatiron steak. Served over sweet roasted beans .  they had about 5 or six pastas that could be appetizer or entrees which was nice.  Very nice drink selection including specialty cocktails, craft beers and a huge wine selection.

I had the octopus as my appetizer and the dorade as my entree. I love the octopus. It was baby octopus with Manila calms and some lime and cilantro with a bit of broth. Love it!! The whole roasted dorade was absolutely delicious. The fish itself didn't have too much favor but with the onions and the lemon cooked inside and the sides of market green, garlic scales and ramp vinaigrette - this dish was amazing.

I happen to think this would be a nice and romantic place for a date so I'm excited to bring my sweetheart to enjoy this experience again. Portions are very good here. I am extremely appreciative and I walk out feeling very full and paid for exactly what I love: great food and service. In addition I would like to add that they have an organic garden in the back where they grow some of their veggies. It's pretty cool that they have that. Makes it extra special.

The restaurant week menu here is an amazing deal because they offer their entire menu, with only a few dishes requiring a supplement.  I got the bigoli pasta as my appetizer, the grilled chicken as my main course, and the chocolate mousse as my dessert.  The standout from these three courses was the bigoli pasta, as the pasta was nice and al dente and the tomatoes were really juicy and flavorful.  The chicken was also really good and was cooked perfectly, and the chocolate mousse was light and fluffy (the liquid chocolate center was a really nice surprise!).My favorite part of the meal actually did not come from any of the dished that I ordered, but from the pork chop that my mom ordered.  When the dish came we saw that the pork chop was topped with something very dark and sticky looking, so I tried a bite to see what it was.  After taking one bite, I didn't want to even eat my chicken anymore because it was so delicious!  We asked the waiter and found out that it was candied barbecued pulled pork belly, and it was just as amazing as it sounds.  I honestly would've been perfectly happy with a bowl of that for my main course, but unfortunately it is not its own dish!  The whole dining experience from the food to the service and beautiful outdoor dining area were great, and I would definitely return!",1,0,0,Allie S.,"Manhattan, NY",3,70,166

The portions were substantial and we left stuffed. The restaurant itself is rather difficult to get to, but worth the trip. Love the sleek decor and the casual yet upscale atmosphere. It wasn't stuffy at all and we felt right at home. We were served crusty baguettes, still warm and studded with granules of salt on top. Paired with fresh butter, it was a delicious way to start the meal. I had the sweet corn panna cotta with huatilicoche vinaigrette, avocado, and pepper to start, which was unfortunately a miss. The texture was just very odd, slightly watery instead of creamy and the flavors just didn't go very well. Things definitely picked up with my main, the pork chop with cipollini onions, grilled peaches, and collard greens. I never order pork in restaurants, but I'm glad I did here. The sauce gave the pork great flavor, and I loved the pieces of pulled pork and sweet onions. The collard greens were WAY too salty though, and the dish as a whole could have been toned down in terms of salt. For dessert I had the cheesecake, with brandied cherries, graham cracker crumble, and cherry sorbet. The cheesecake had an almost tofu-like texture. Creamy and thick, but light and not too sweet. It came with a candle for my birthday...nice cap to a great meal. Other highlights from my family's dishes included the mushroom consommé and the squid ink pasta starters, and the whole roasted dorade (perfectly cooked, with delicious miso long beans). We also had the hamachi and avocado salad, sirloin and brisket (very tender, but my sister thought the sauce didn't pair very well), chocolate mousse with chai ice cream (the flavors didn't go to well together either), and affogato. My mom never clears her plates at restaurants, but she finished every course here. Service was friendly and our water was constantly being refilled. We didn't all get our meals at the same time though. Overall it was a steal at $38, and I'd gladly make the trek back again.",1,0,0,Cat K.,"San Francisco, CA",34,87,47
2.0,8/1/2013,"I came here for restaurant week lunch with my sister who was visiting the city. The location was a little hard to get to, but the restaurant itself is located in a very pretty area, and you can admire the outdoor veggie gardens on your way in. Food, overall, was really disappointing. My sister ordered the rabbit appetizer (not on the website's menu), hanger steak (with the $5 supplement), and cheesecake, while I ordered the campanelle pasta (appetizer portion), grilled pork t-bone, and cheesecake. The appetizers and steak were beautifully presented but turned out to be only mediocre. The grilled pork was terrible -- it tasted like someone had doused it with soy sauce, and it was so salty that I could only stomach a few bites before giving up completely. The dessert was the only highlight of the meal. The other disturbing part was finding hair in the food -- there was a hair in the butter dish (with the bread), and another hair in my pasta. Really, now? Service was generally prompt and efficient. Since we went during a mid-week lunchtime, most of the other tables were occupied by an older crowd. All in all, I wouldn't come back again, for fear of getting another over-salted dish or something with a hair in it.",0,0,0,J Y.,"Manhattan, NY",2,34,0
4.0,7/28/2013,"Riverpark was absolutely phenomenal! Another great Tom Colicchio restaurant., so definitely give it a try. You won't be disappointed. Service: 4.5Tom Colicchio's restaurants are all about the details, and the service at both Riverpark and Colicchio and Son's is incredible. The servers and hosts are more than accommodating, friendly, and strike the appropriate balance between attentive and distant. You're able to enjoy your dining experience while also having consistent service.Food: 4The food is quite delicious. I had the Bronx Brewery pasta, flatiron steak and brisket, and the cheesecake with cherry ice cream. The pasta was a little too salty for my liking, but the brisket and steak had an interesting, pseudo-southern BBQ feel to it--it was quite nice. And the cheesecake and ice cream were to die for. Not only were they the perfect pallet cleansers but they were just outright delicious. Atmosphere: 4.5While we sat inside because we didn't have  reservation, I recommend making one so that you can take advantage of the view of the river.

3.0,7/27/2013,"Came here on a late Saturday night dinner with another couple.  Overall, it was good but it wasn't something I would come back to.The food was good, but nothing amazing.  Tried the lamb, scallop, pork chops entre.  The best was the pork chop.  My lamb was suppose to be rare or medium rare but it came out more like medium.The decor reminded me that I am in some hotel restaurant or perhaps a restaurant in midtown.  Doesn't have too much personality but perhaps the selling point is the outside seating by the water.Service was good but not exceptional.  Our waitress did drop the ball when we ordered shared appetizers and a pasta plate to share and she didn't come out with individual appetizer plates for us to use.  Were we suppose to use your bread plate while we still have bread on it?Like other reviewers have mentioned, the location is out of the way and a little difficult to find.  I wouldn't go out of my way to try this place but if you happened to walk along the river and maybe spot the restaurant, I would stop in.",0,0,0,Nas L.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,167,33
1.0,7/25/2013,"I came here for Restaurant Week 2013 last night, and I'm still irked by the unacceptable service I received last night.Riverpark's menu is great for RW because they let you choose mostly everything off of their menu, with some choices having a price supplement. No big. I ordered the Sweet Corn Panna Cotta (mediocre), Mozzarella (very yummy), Squid Ink Pasta (my favorite part of the meal, very lemony and light with the cilantro), Trout (was ok) Dorade (a big portion of fish, very fresh) and the Chocolate Mousse (underwhelming, would pass). Here's the kicker - my appetizer portion squid ink pasta came out at the same time as my husband's fish entree. Then came the dessert about 30 minutes later, my entree no where in sight. When I inquired with my waiter where my entree was, he says ""I took the liberty of packing it up for you to go, I hope you don't mind."" Why yes actually, I do mind. Another thing that really bothered me was that there was a tiny little mouse roaming outside on their terrace. Not what you want to see when you're eating your meal.So basically I ate my fish cold at home because Riverpark doesn't know how to treat customers. Would not recommend this place to anyone.",6,0,0,Roham U.,"New York, NY",45,65,0

3.0,7/15/2013,"We did the prix fixe for a friend's milestone birthday. On the upside, if it wasn't for the rain, the restaurant had beautiful views of the East River, and I really liked the design scheme - very modern, open, comfortable and maintaining a sense of intimacy - and I liked the fact that you can actually hear yourself speak in there! The Prix Fixe menus went for $65 - my choices were the Avocado and Hamachi Salad, the Sirloin & Brisket and the Cheesecake. I was not a big fan of the Avocado and Hamachi salad, which was basically a ton of sliced avocado, a a tiny morsel of Hamachi, and was drizzled with this substance that reminded me of vegemite (an extremely salty spread which tastes like concentrated soy sauce) - was a tad unpleasant. The sirloin and brisket was decent, but not great - the black radish consomme was surprisingly pleasant and mellow and offered an extra wetness to the meat outwith overpowering the beef. Finally came the dessert - again, on the disappointing side. The custard-consistency cheesecake was too tart and served on a impossible to cut crust which completely mismatched in textures. The cocktails were decent as well, AGAIN, not mind-blowing, I had the Pisco Watermelon cocktail which was refreshing, but that's about all I can say about it. The place has the potential to be great, but the food was just a bit of a let-down and that was kind of agreed across the table. Service was ok at best, it was hard to flag down a waiter, but on the other hand, you'll be permitted a long, leisurely dinner. My main issue with this place is that if you are spending this much money, I expect to leave really impressed with the food, else it's going to be a single visit.",1,0,1,Rahul P.,"Jersey City, NJ",12,115,0
4.0,7/15/2013,"I enjoyed my time at Riverpark. I wish we were able to get a seat near the window but on a Saturday at 7:30, they were apparently all full. I would say the theme of the meal was unexpected twists of flavors. My cocktail I think had basil inside. For appetizer, my boyfriend and I had the panna cotta that came with crab salad on top. I've only had panna cotta for dessert so this was a savory surprise! For entree, I had black pasta with seafood at an appetizer portion. It was extremely small but tasty. My boyfriend enjoyed his pork chop. For dessert, we shared the chocolate mousse which came with this unique chai ice cream. Loved the presentation of this dessert. Would I come back?

The outdoor patio seating was nice facing the water and not crowded at all. Everything on the menu was scrumptious! The appetizers are perfect for sharing. I highly recommend the grilled bread with avocado and the fried grits! Chicken and waffles were amazing and don't forget the French Toast.

5.0,7/3/2013,"So, I saw this place on the Cooking Channel and was fascinated by the concept, so I immediately made reservations for my trip to Manhattan. And well, the Cooking Channel did not lie! The food and drinks were phenomenal! We started with a King Kong and a Sour Prick which were really tasty, but the drink show stopper was the Green Lemonade which is the PERFECT NON-ALCOHOLIC beverage with a mix of cucumber, mint, and lemonade. We started with the White Asparagus Gazpacho and the Bigoli. The most wonderful thing about the food was the PERFECT blending of flavors that we could taste in every bite. For our main course we had the Grilled Pork Chop and the Grilled Chicken which were AMAZING! The flavors were incredible and so very complementary. Jamal, our waiter, was also fabulous and very personable and willing to make suggestions, which is something that is HUGE for me!

4.0,7/2/2013,"Really cute, nice restaurant. Great date spot.There's the option for sitting outside, which has a great view if you're on the ends (the middle has a big bush blocking your view). It would also just be amazing on a nice weather day eating a great meal with some wine or something.After you order your appetizers, they give you bread, which was honestly amazing because it was WARM. I don't understand why more places don't give you warm bread. The butter was also room temperature which was nice. As for the actual meal, we ordered the 3 appetizers (grilled octopus and sweetbreads were both really good), and we each tried different entrees. I ended up getting the 2.5 pound ribeye to be shared with a friend, and it was great. Comes with asparagus and good potatoes as well. The rabbit and pork chop entrees were also awesome. Dessert was mediocre in my opinion. Nicely plated, but not stellar in taste. As a huge dessert lover, this was disappointing.

2.0,6/17/2013,"Took my boyfriend here for his 24 birthday expecting greatness. Oh boy....everything went down hill after the appetizers. Decor was very modern. The hostess was very nice and friendly. Only thing I was annoyed about was that I had emailed them earlier since I was in Mexico (couldn't call) to see if they could reserve a seat for two in the outdoor area since it was a celebration and I didn't want to go all the way there just to sit inside. They said it's first come first serve basis. For a upscale restaurant - they should be able to accommodate their guests the best way they can, but we got a seat outside anyways since it wasn't packed when we got there. After we got seated outside, the view was nice. Nothing spectacular. Even though it was next to the FDR, it wasn't as loud as I thought it would be. The service was impeccable. All the waiters did their best to make sure everyone's glasses were full and no empty plates sat on the table.There is a whole book for cocktails, liquor, beer, wines. Very good selection. We started off with the salmon tartare, east/west coast oysters and mushroom consomme. The oysters were the only thing that I would say was delicious and I could of had that for dinner all night and be satisfied. Salmon tartare was good. It was very nice that they split the mushroom consomme for us. The presentation was on point and I thoroughly enjoyed it. This is when it went downhill. I had the squid ink pasta with seafood and my boyfriend had the porkchop. Both same price, around $30. I dislike the squid ink pasta, there was some weird herb or orange zest in it that left a horrible lingering taste after every bite. Of course, I read some reviews that said it was delicious. So maybe it was just my palette. My boyfriend had the porkchop which he asked for medium but it came out well done. He said the hazelnut sauce that it came with did not go well with the porkchop. I already had a bad taste in my mouth so I did not even opt to try his dish. Overall, it was a huge disappointment.",0,0,0,Janice T.,"Culver City, CA",549,51,16

2.0,6/11/2013,"I came here for dinner on a double date to catch up with a couple friends I haven't seen in a while. It's not the most obvious place to get to - you have to go east of 1st Avenue on 29th Street until you reach a building that has the Riverpark name on it...and then you walk to the back of that building to get to the actual restaurant. The indoor decor looks very much like a classy modern restaurant; we opted to sit outside. Although I drew the short straw and sat in the seat that was facing away from the river, from what I saw, it's a very nice view - even if the FDR Drive is right in front of you. The server was very amiable, even though we took forever before bothering to pick up our menus and giving them a look. That said, it took way too long to bring out my first couple of beers (which were ones on tap).The drink selection is solid - lots of beers, wines, and cocktails to choose from; I chose the always-flavorful Sixpoint Righteous Rye, as well as Back in Black dark IPA, which I hadn't seen available on tap before. As for the food - it was decent quality, but definitely uneven. I started out with the avocado with hamachi salad. While the hamachi itself is very good, there is way too much else happening on the plate, starting with the avocado - you basically have an entire half an avocado sliced up to eat. Not that I don't like avocado (I do, very much), but it's got a very strong, creamy presence that just dominates the fish. Aside from the ratio being off, there was also a black jam that didn't really fit well with the dish as a whole. I went with the Berkshire pork chop for the entree, which was quite well-done, with the romesco giving it a very nice crunchy texture that works quite well with the juiciness of the pork chop. On the flip side, I did have a bite of my fiancee's squid-ink pasta, and that was not done well - there's some kind of flavoring in the dish that made it very tart - not a flavor at all that any squid-ink pasta I've had before resembles.In short - there are some good dishes here, but this really reminds me most of the bar room at Modern - some good spots here and there, but otherwise a series of questionable decisions that really knocks down the quality of the meal overall. The food itself is perfectly fine from a freshness and quality perspective, but I just wasn't a fan of most of the final products. I could see myself coming back because I do like the East Side river view, but I can't say that the food is necessarily worth what you're going to be paying for it. And given we came on a Saturday night, I can't say that it's going to be better if you come another day.",0,0,0,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169
5.0,6/11/2013,"Riverpark was absolutely fantastic! The lunch I just enjoyed will be a meal I'll always remember from the stunning view, to the unique and comfortable decor but most of all the incredibly delicious and fresh food.First of all, a portion of their food is grown on-site in the gardens surrounding the restaurant.  So take a moment to check it out before you walk in.  I had a chance to meet the farmer and take in the numerous fruits and vegetables they're growing to ensure their food is not only super fresh, but unique with offerings you can't find anywhere else.  The staff was extremely attentive and helpful in guiding me through the menu, especially considering I have a cheese allergy.  I started with the House Smoked Salmon, which was out of this world.  The salmon was like nothing I've ever had before.  The dish itself was almost too pretty to eat, but eat it I did.  It came with 3 small quarter inch thick salmon medalions that were so succulent, it could have been sashimi.  Paired with a vinagrette and fresh radishes and edamame, the dish was so flavorful but also delicate and fresh.  A perfect way to start an epic lunch. I had the Grilled Pork T-Bone for my main meal, which was cooked to perfection. It had a nice charred flavor from being cooked over a flame and the pureed carrots added a sweetness to compliment the overall flavor of the dish.  The grilled onions, carrots and asparagus were lovely as well.  I savored every bite!  My table also shared all three of the a la carte sides, which were all delicious.  The sauteed greens were great, but the radishes and crispy fingerling potatoes were to die for.  I don't even like radishes, but these were almost sweet, served whole with the leaves still on.  You can tell these were just picked, a true farm to table dish!  For dessert, I had the Chocolate Mousse, which came with both dark chocolate and milk chocolate options.  Holy Chocolate Sauce this was good!  If I could have licked my plate, I would have.  Everything was just so good!!!  My entire table couldn't stop raving about the food.  A lot of love goes into the growing, planning and cooking of every dish here, so eat up and remember to eat your veggies - I promise you'll love 'em!",0,0,0,Jaci H.,"Brooklyn, NY",116,301,33

3.0,4/28/2013,"Beautiful spot, especially at the outside tables as it warms up. I just ate here again after not visiting for a year and my impression is that the food has dropped just a notch, but it's still very good. Last summer it was just plain delicious. This year, just pretty darned good. Let me be more specific: fresh green salad was a bit off, not quite bitter but edging that way, not quite so tasty as I'd hoped. Perhaps this is due to how early in the spring it is and fact  their adjoining garden isn't really going yet in delivering fresh greens. The fish tacos as the bar are awesome. Really, really good. The E. Coast oysters undeniably fresh, W. Coast unsurprisingly slightly less so but well within the parameters of ""very good."" White asparagus gazpacho A+.  Avocado and Hamachi salad is an interesting dish and would have been brilliant but the avocados were strangely tasteless. I don't know if this is in part due to the tanginess of the rest of the salad and thus only a relative gripe due to the charred chile sauce which I found really nice but my partner no. But the avocados were indeed sort of watery, not quite nutty enough for such a production/high end place so it's kind of an issue of ingredients, like the salad. even as they were undeniably fresh and nicely colored Anyway, cuttlefish spaccatelli was perfectly al dente, came with just the right amt of chewy and tangy cuttlefish, but marred only by the fact that they seem to spice it up with a chile/pepper powder that's sprinkled across the top rather than worked in so if one's not aware of how the spice is distributed the first forkfulls are overly hot and the rest lacking in this powder. The swordfish was creatively cooked, great with spring raab and spring onions but again, I think the nice-sized piece of actual swordfish could have come from slightly fresher stock. That's not to say it was fishy or old. It most definitely wasn't. But the Tom C. restuarants are supposedly in part about local, fresh ingredients. And if you're gonna spend so much time on location and effort in cooking, why not guarantee those absolutely top-shelf ingredients each time? If this happens I'll be back much more than once or twice a year. If not, it'll remain a nice place to watch the moon over Billyburgh, see cars whizzing by FDR, and chill with a nice breeze off E.

3.0,4/16/2013,"3.5 starsMy boyfriend and I came here for a prix fixe meal during Restaurant Week (ahhhh this is a late review, I know! But I took a bunch of pictures so I could remember what I wanted to say about the food).We wanted to catch a meal here before taking our flight back to California, so we booked the earliest possible lunch. It was a little hard to find because it's located in what looks like a business complex or corporate building, but we were very pleasantly surprised when we stepped inside. At noon, it was relatively empty so we got great service, and being able to appreciate all the modern decor in the daylight was nice as well. I loved getting a table by the window and looking out at the river. Unfortunately, the food itself was a little on the disappointing side. Appetizers: Duck pate and salmon tartare. The salmon tartare was wonderful and tasted really good with the chips that they probably (hopefully) made themselves. It was a very generous portion. The duck pate, on the other hand, was very hard for me to handle. No classy points for me! Thankfully, my boyfriend didn't seem to mind it so much. Pinky up! Entrees: Pork steak and lamb curry. The portions for both of these were disappointing and the taste of the pork steak was just ok. The naan that came with the lamb curry was very delicious but the curry itself was in a very small portion. I don't know if that was only the portion sizes for Restaurant Week or if those are the normal portions...The curry is also on the spicy side!Dessert: banana sundae with vanilla/mocha ice cream and coconut panna cotta.The banana sundae was delicious and presented in such a cute way (in a glass cup). I really enjoyed all the flavors together and am a banana lover regardless so the meal ended with me being quite happy. The coconut panna cotta was quite good as well but I thought it was a tiny bit on the bland side.Overall, I felt like the appetizers and desserts outshone the entrees.

4.0,4/12/2013,"You know it's delicious when you write a review about it a year after dining!My cowrkers and I were deciding upon a lunch date for restaurant week and came upon this place.  It was fairly close to our work and owned by Tom Colicchio, so we thought it was a good choice.The location is a bit of a hike since it's right on the East Side River.  The restaurant was inside of an office building.  The views were gorgeous and the room was nicely decorated and very bright.  Very clean and classy ambiance.  We received the menu for the 3 course prix fixed restaurant week menu.  I ordered the most amazing salad I'd ever had.  I'm sad that it's not on the menu right now.  But if I had to describe it.. it had a sweet cranberry vinaigrette w/ cranberries and candied almonds..... gruyere cheese?  Delicious.The first course was so delicious that I don't even remember what I had for my 2nd.  haha, but i'm pretty sure I had the bass and that was good too.  Not as good as the salad.  I'm still dreaming about that salad........  I would go back just for it.Since i'm not a huge chocolate fan, I think I just had the sorbet for dessert.  Plus it was super hot outside.$30 for all of this.. not so bad!",0,0,1,M C.,"New York, NY",19,57,0
3.0,4/10/2013,"I went here with a lot of expectations and was fairly underwhelmed.  I expected it to be amazing but it really wasn't very special.  The location is a little difficult to find.  It's off the main road, currently behind a lot of construction, and inside at the back of an office building.  The view is great, but I wouldn't have ever known that since our table was nowhere near the view so it wasn't anything special to me.The food was ok.  I honestly didn't think any of the appetizers sounded very appealing.  I ended up getting the sweet bread, and it was fine, but it wasn't anything like OMG this is so good.  For my meal I had the beef and brisket.  TINY portion.  It was about the size of an appetizer.  I was still really hungry after having both the sweet bread and the beef and brisket, and given these prices it should have been more filling.Dessert was phenomenal though.  I had the banana cake.  No complaints there!  Very delicious.  But I mean, I just got home from a 3 course meal, lots of wine, and I'm not very full.  Yeah I had a meal, but I could easily keep eating, and there were others I was eating with as well that felt very similarly.  That seems like a big miss for such a high end restaurant - at least let your guests leave full.It was a fine experience but we wouldn't ever go back.  Too many amazing options in NYC to repeat attend an acceptable place.",4,1,3,Jennifer N.,"Seattle, WA",561,708,37

Branzino- subbed in for Black Bass and broccoli-ish green.

The food was delicious. The Calamari salad definitely was unexpected. The grapefruit gave the calamari a dash of sour tang in a smoky salty BBQ-like sauce. Worth a try! However, I highly recommend the Berkshire pork chop! Grilled lamb t-bone & ribs was also delicious, definitely get it medium rare! Topped off the night with a superb chocolate soufflé cake.

So we went back again with our friends last month, this time for a small group dinner. The appetizers (calamari, tartar, baby octopus) were just okay. Nothing really stood out. I've had better dishes at some of the other restaurants in NYC (Park Avenue Winter, Eleven Madison Park, Acme, illili, Nomad, Quality Meats, just to name a few). Our friend and I had the Grilled Lamb T-bone & Ribs with marinated wild mushrooms, red Russian kale, turnips & beluga lentils. Unfortunately, I had to send the dish back. Our waiter, who was very attentive, offered us another dish but we just did not want another salty dish with really bad meat. I never turn back my food at any restaurant so I was very upset as well. I was only able to eat the kale and the rest were just too salty. Lamb was definitely overcooked & we could not even slice the meat since it was chunky, lumpy and hard. Probably the worst lamb dish I've ever had. It was simply not eatable. I politely told the manager about our situation and he indicated that he will instruct the kitchen staff. I never write negative reviews here, but it was so terrible I just had to.

Usually at benefits the food is just okay and you leave starving. Not the case for us here. Obviously, our experience is not typical of what one would experience at Riverpark, but all the other parents at the benefit said they'd come back and bring friends and that's what I intend to do. I love what Tom is about; classic american cuisine with a never boring twist. I especially think he succeeded at this with the limitations of the benefit buffet and passed dessert model. The buffet was flush with fish tacos, pastas, salads, turkey and the desserts were all easy to handle and eat and were mouth watering.

4.0,2/17/2013,"Came here for restaurant week and what a deal this was.  Unlike many other restaurants that will come up with a specific restaurant week menu usually serving low cost items such as chicken and skate, Riverpark offered up their whole menu.  You could pick any item from the menu including having anything as your appetizer.For my meal, I had the testa tortellini, steamed branzino, and the meyer lemon semifreddo.  The testa tortellini was absolutely amazing, the broth was so fragrant and so delicious, i only wish I could have had more of that broth in a much larger bowl.  The steamed branzino was cooked perfectly although I was disappointed that it was filleted and was wrapped in some sort of weird hopefully edible wrapper.  If not whoops I ate it.  I would have much rather received the whole branzino rather than a butchered portion which at the end of the day was much less meat than what would have otherwise been provided with the whole fish.  The meyer lemon semifreddo wasn't my favorite and I was wishing it was more lemony than it was.  Service from the waitstaff was average and the kitchen was on top of things by getting our dishes out in a timely manner.  The restaurant is kind of located in the middle of nowhere but the view is pretty great with a nice view of Brooklyn and Queens.  I would think this would be a fantastic restaurant to visit during the summer and have dinner outside.  I would definitely come back to River Park as everything was pretty perfect here.",0,0,0,Phil L.,"Seattle, WA",167,876,249

My riend and I each ordered an appetizer, pasta and entree.  He ordered the sweetbreads, which I was NOT going to taste :). He said they were good, but nothing spectacular. For his pasta he had squid ink pasta with some mixed seafood. It was so spicy that he picked out the seafood and left all the pasta. The servers were up in arms, and they offered to have another one made less spicy, but we declined. He wasn't that interested. For his entree he had the pork chops, which he said were tasty, but again, nothing spectacular. I had for an appetizer the spanish mackerel, which was grilled and very good. My pasta was tortellini in broth with some pears. A little strange, frankly. I had the chicken for an entree. I don't normally order chicken when I go out because I find it is always boring, but something about the description made me want to order it, and it was quite good.

Their RW menu are items right off their regular menu and there were plenty to choose from.

Pork chop was suggested medium but was a bit undercooked, though very flavorful; Lamb T-Bone was suggested medium rare but was overcooked. Overall we thought the food was just average.

The fries on the side were good as well, and I had to control myself and not eat all of them.   I had about zero room for dessert, but we decided we'd all share the beer sundae.  I'm not a huge fan of Guinness, so it probably wouldn't have been my first choice, but it was pretty good.  I really liked the chocolate pretzel bits on top.   Besides for the messy sandwich I really enjoyed my meal.  I definitely think I'd like to come back during a warmer season and eat outside and get to enjoy the view.",1,0,1,Rachel W.,"Manhattan, NY",284,202,541

Once you reach 29th and 1st, you will have to walk into a cobblestone driveway and walk about another 20-30 feet before reaching the final destination. The building is beautiful and is set right next to the river. Once we entered, a hostess greeted us and we were immediately seated. The place was relatively empty, save for a few tables. The interior is really nice and reminded me of a hotel lobby. The whole left side of the restaurant had glass windows, to optimize the view of the river. Since we were a large group (7 people), we weren't able to be seated near the windows and instead had to settle for a table in the center of the restaurant; so if you want a view, come with 4 or less people (and probably call in advance). The waiters were extremely cordial and very attentive. The food was also very good. I had the Chicken with Waffles and also a side of Roasted Bananas. The Chicken with Waffles was prepared well, but after I saw my friend's Pulled Pork Chilaquiles, I got kind of jealous and wish I had ordered that instead! The roasted bananas were fantastic and would totally recommend it too anyone who has a sweet tooth!

Diner's outside enjoy the view but also have to share the view with FDR Drive traffic. As for the food.. Salmon Tarter with capers lemon and parsley would have been good if it wasn't so damn salty and would have been a lot better if it was served with toasted french bread instead of the ridiculously salty potato chips they served it with. Duck Confit Ravioli with summer melon, fennel, and duck Prosciutto (whatever the heck that is) was good but the temperature varied too much within the ingredients themselves.  Entree of Diver Scallops with corn, tarragon, chanterelle mushrooms tomatoes and bacon consisted of 3 scallops and some excellent corn. For $33.00, it was a rip off.  It was good, but NOT $33 good! On the other hand, the branzino with tomato consumme, freekeh, celery, ginger and mustard frills was good and an acceptable portion size, but it tasted like branzino in a smoky tomato broth. Dessert was the Peaches and Cream sundae with creame fresh ice cream, sponge cake, and almond brittle. It was more like a mashed up peach sponge cake served in a glass. Not bad though. Service wasn't the best. I had to beg for more bread (twice) and the waitress asked me if I wanted more coffee (but not my dining partner) then filled my cup THEN said ""it was decaf, right?"". Yes it was, but if you needed to ask that question , you should have asked it BEFORE you poured the coffee. My dining partner wasn't offered more coffee, but was presented with the check.

4.0,8/17/2012,"I work in a really nice building.  Unfortunately, it's nestled at the end of a private driveway, towering over the FDR Drive, overlooking the East River.  You can't get more East than this.  It's a pain to get to.  There is no subway nearby.  There are hospitals on both sides of it, one of them notoriously known for housing ""crazy"" people.  But I digress.On the main floor of the building, in the back overlooking the water, lies Riverpark.  As many people have already stated, it's a Tom Colicchio establishment.  It's like an oasis of awesome in an otherwise drab and clinical part of the city.  The place is expansive, with very high ceilings and an open floor plan, giving guests a sense of space and comfort.  The decor and lighting are tastefully done, somewhat loungey and hip, but with a certain formality that lets you know they are not for games.  The bar is on the East side of the room, looking out over the river.  There is outdoor seating and an al fresco patio, as well.I've been going since they opened back in the fall of 2010, and have noticed marked improvements in the food, the service, and in the consistency of their execution.  I've never actually sat for a formal dinner, but have had lunch several times, as well as drinks, apps and bar snacks.  The quality and assortment of menu offerings range from very good to excellent, in my opinion.  Like many of Tom's places, the menu essentially takes simple and comfort fare, but elevates it with signature flourishes.  They also rotate items in and out seasonally, which keeps things fresh and interesting.  They have nice wines by the glass, tasty signature cocktails, as well as a handful of ""temperance coolers,"" as they're called, for those not in search of a buzz.In general, Riverpark is really solid and would likely do well on its own merits, regardless of location.  However, being in such a lousy part of town, tucked away in a corporate park, it certainly shines.  For my exciting conclusion, I'd like to leave you with the following:  Even if you plan to come here for dinner, anticipating some hamachi crudo, squid ink chitarra and duck confit, I would implore you to come for lunch, so you can try the FRIED CHICKEN.  It's served with a warm, fresh biscuit, a mound of mustard greens, and a side of peppered honey for dipping the crunchy, but lightly battered, plump, juicy and delectable pieces of chicken in.  I triple dog dare you...",3,0,3,Joe L.,"South Orange, NJ",317,398,322

We just had to reassure the taxi driver that the cab was allowed to go in.We went there for Sunday brunch in June. It was a nice day, so we chose to sit in the outdoor area.

4.0,8/10/2012,"Decided to try Riverpark for Restaurant Week Summer 2012 because unlike many other restaurants, Riverpark makes their entire menu available (some items have a supplemental price).  I love that they do this because it really highlights what Restaurant Week is about-- to offer diners the opportunity to try a new restaurant at an affordable price.  What is the point of trying out a new restaurant if all you get is a watered-down menu?  Despite the complaints about Riverpark being hard to get to, it wasn't too hard to find parking nearby.. so maybe think about driving?The Riverpark farm at Alexandria Center provides fresh, seasonal produce to Riverpark Restaurant. It is right next to the restaurant and we took the opportunity to walk around a bit and check out the crops. It was neat to see the garden amidst all the buildings and is definitely an interesting concept. The farm is rather small though so it looks like they stick to smaller produce like peppers and greens.Before we ordered, we were each given a mini French baguette.. so cute! But don't be fooled if you get a hard, cold piece of bread.. they have warmed ones too!  Ask for the warm bread.. it tastes so much better.To start we had the avocado & hamachi salad w/ pickled red onions and charred chiles ($5 supplement). The salad consists of an entire avocado thinly sliced with 2 sashimi-style slices of hamachi over it with a bit of pickled red onion and frisee on top. The charred chiles is of a dressing consistency and is mildly spicy and despite the pitch-black color, has no burnt taste. The flavor of the charred chiles dressing went well with the salad but there was too much of it! I had to scoop a large portion of the sauce to the side in order to finish the salad.We opted to try a smaller portion of the Squid Ink Chitarra w/ calamari, octopus, lemon, Fresno chiles as an appetizer. Chitarra means guitar in Italian and also refers to the pasta-making tool that resembles a stringed instrument. Spaghetti alla chitarra is made by pressing a thin sheet of dough onto the metal strings, thus creating thin noodles. The end result is a pasta that is slightly squarish, rather than round like spaghetti, and has a coarser texture. The rough edges help lighter sauces adhere better to the pasta.  I really enjoyed this dish. I could taste the brininess of the squid ink pasta and it was further highlighted by the lemon flavor in the dish. The calamari rings were a bit rubbery but the octopus was tender and tasty. The thin slices of fresno chili, a chili similar to the jalapeno but with thinner walls, added a bit of a kick to the light dish.Ever since the awesome grilled duck I had at Brooklyn Fare, I've been craving some delicious duck so of course I asked the server how their duck dish was. The server said it would make me a happy girl and when he confirmed that the skin would be crispy, I went for it. The duck breast was served atop a duck confit cassoulet and summer pole beans. The duck was perfectly cooked (medium-rare as I requested) but the skin was not as crisy as I would have liked and the fat between the skin and meat was not rendered properly. It was disappointing, because it marred an otherwise delicious dish. The Berkshire pork chop w/ collards, grilled peaches, and cippolini onions came highly recommended and it was also perfectly cooked. The salty, bacony flavor of the pork chop went well with the bitterness of the collard greens and the sweetness of the peaches and cippolini onions. It could have used a bit more sauce though.For dessert, we ordered the chocolate-caramel tart w/ roasted peanuts, caramel corn, caramel ice cream.  Overall, this was an extremely sweet dessert. There was a layer of caramel at the bottom of the chocolate tart which overpowered the bitterness of the dark chocolate. The salted roasted peanuts in the tart only served to make the caramel that much sweeter.  The caramel corn tasted like fresh Cracker Jack! The caramel ice cream was the best part of the dish. This might be a dessert for you if you love caramel or if you have an extreme sweet tooth, neither of which my bf or I can claim.We also ordered the beignets w/ berry sauce. The beignets were disappointing; not only were they rather dense, but the berry sauce tasted like cough syrup.   We also had a scoop of hazelnut ice cream which tasted just like a Ferrero Rocher chocolate!",0,0,0,Sharon L.,"Flushing, NY",26,87,180
3.0,8/7/2012,"I will give it 3.5 stars because I am admittedly a HUGE Tom Colicchio fan. Craft and Colicchio and Sons are two of my favorite restaurants, however Riverpark was just mediocre last night.The atmosphere and service were stellar as the usually are at Colicchio's spots. That was not the problem. My waiter was incredibly nice, engaging, and attentive throughout the meal.The meal started with some delicious hot fresh bread and butter. It appeared like baguette which I generally despise but it actually tasted like a pretzel as it was chewy and was sprinkled with sea salt. I went for restaurant week and got three courses for $45 ($10 supplement for my lamb main).For the first course I had the cavatelli with zucchini, zucchini blossoms, basil in a pesto like sauce with some grated ricotta salata. The pasta was very good, cooked al dente and the sauce and ingredients were fresh. It tasted very much like spring which I found odd since we were in the middle of August. It wasn't anything extraordinary though and it definitely could have been hotter and needed some more cheese.For the main, I opted for the grilled lamb t-bone and ribs with fingerling potatoes, bitter greens, and olive lemon sauce for a $10 supplement. This is where things went downhill. I had read other reviews saying the food was super salty here and this dish really confirmed that. Now I am not one to ever complain for food being overly salty. I actually usually add salt to my food even in restaurants. But honestly, this was the SALTIEST plate of food I have ever had in a restaurant. The ""bitter greens"" tasted like the cover from the salt shaker came off when the chef was seasoning them. Making things worse was that the greens were blasted on a charcoal grill. All I could taste was smoke and salt. The saving grace were the potatoes which were the only thing not totally engulfed in salt and provided a nice break with some much needed starch. The lamb t-bone itself was good, cooked rareish as ordered but again it's pretty hard to mess up lamb unless you totally overcook it. Also the portion was rather paltry, I'd say MAYBE  ounces tops. When it came to the lamb ribs (2 of them), a familiar theme- one was totally oversalted. I don't really know what happened here with this dish. Seems like for some reason the chef got really heavy handed with the salt which is unfortunate and not needed when dealing with something so delicious as lamb. Let the meat speak for itself. Honestly, I managed to eat the lamb and potatoes but there was no way I could choke down the greens thats how bad they were. Overall, a huge disappointment especially since there was a supplemental charge. Why? I still don't know since the portion was quite small.For dessert I got the beignets with berry sauce. These were really great. They brought me back to my chilhood as a young Italin boy when my grandfather would make them or I would go to the feast in Brooklyn. You get 6 which is generous, piping hot, delicious berry compote which my server said was made right across in their farm. Still, not enough to save the overall impression of the meal.I'd try it again for brunch but I will stick to the great Craft and Colicchio and Sons over Riverpark.",1,0,0,G C.,"New York, NY",21,264,798

Cappelletti: this was actually very good out of the 3 we picked.  Had a nice spicy kick and the pasta was al dente.  I wind up eating my friend's First Course.2. Duck Confit Ravioli: this dish was ""alright""...the ravioli was tasty.  I didn't like the broth it was sitting in.  It really didn't have a yummy taste but rather, a strong herb flavor...maybe it was the fennel?  It was quite weird.3. Saffron Chitara ($5 supplement): this was very bland actually.  The noodles itself reminds me of ramen noodles and it lacks flavor.  Second Course:1. Duck Breast:  this dish was the best out of the 3, but it was pretty average in the sense of taste.2.  Black Sea Bass: this dish was ""alright"" also, edible, the fish was cooked pretty well.  3. Grilled Lamb T-Bone & Ribs ($10 supplement): the worst dish of the night.  It was OVERLY salty.  Everything was so salty on this plate, down to the greens whereas its no longer ""bitter greens"" - it was ""salty greens"".  I could actually feel the anterior part of my tongue's taste buds stood on its ends from the salt!   The only thing edible was the fingerling potatoes which is pretty sad. I would had sent it back to the kitchen but I wouldn't want the chef to add something ""extra"" due to the fact that I had sent the plate back.Third Course:1. Peaches and Cream: thumbs up!2. & 3. Peanut - Caramel  Chocolate tart : the ice cream part of it was nice, but the tart is waaaay to sweet....but that's my fault, should had known better to order a carmel & chocolate tart since I don't like too sweet desserts.  I literally shivered from the over-sweetness.Additional:  Sauteed Farm Greens ($7):  What's with the SALT?!  The chef probably is not a veggie person and douse anything green in tons of salt to make it ""flavorful""?  The fact that they grow their own produce in their garden and then to have the natural flavors of the greens covered by the ridiculous amount of salt sorta defeats the purpose of having fresh vegetables in the first place.  Even canned vegetable was less salty than what we had that night.Overall, we were glad to came to try Riverpark during RW but I don't think it will be a place we would come back anytime soon.Salt Salt Salt.",1,0,0,Maggie C.,"Queens, NY",0,14,15

We split the avocado on grilled toast which was better than it sounded, it had a really delicious olive oil drizzled over the top and was superb. As an entree I got the pork chilaquiles which was quite possibly one of the best brunch entrees I have ever had, it reminded me of the tortas by Rick Bayless in Chicago.",0,0,1,Evan J.,"Rochester, MN",38,201,3

One problem though, there was a highway in between the restaurant and the river making us converse by screaming over the noisy traffic !own below. Food: Bread:I never review on the bread but this one is A-frigging-mazing. There's sea salt on the bread! Probably the best part of the whole meal.  Appetizer: Salmon Tartar - came with a side of potato chips. It was a bit too fishy and bland for my taste. My friend got the bruschetta, she loved it. It had a creamy cheesy (?) filling in between the veggies and the bread. Main Course: They ran out of branzino, so they replaced my dish with salmon. Salmon was bland. I like the crispy skin though. My friend had poached chicken (bland), with squid ink (too salty) and quinoa. Meh.Dessert:Beignet (Deep Fried Dough) : Nice and hot with side of raspberry jamPeaches and Cream: Vanilla Ice cream with Peaches and Nuts. Awesome. Overall: Everything was pretty much bland.

1.0,7/24/2012,"I recently dined with 7 friends and overall, we were disappointed with our experience. The restaurant was only about 1/2 - 2/3 full, yet we had to request more water and additional drinks repeatedly. The server was friendly but rarely checked in to see how we were doing or if we needed anything else. Out of the 8 of us, I would say that 2 people were very impressed with their food, 2 were very disappointed, and the rest thought it was so-so. I called several days before our reservation to make sure they would have vegan options. I was told that someone would call me back but they never did. Fine. When I arrived, I informed the server that I'm vegan and he recommended two particular entrees. Someone else came to take the order so I ordered one of the recommended entrees, along with an appetizer and a couple drinks. Perhaps I don't eat at fancy restaurants enough, but I had no idea that ""sweet breads"" are not actually breads. They are a baby cow's neck. Disgusting! Nobody else at the table knew that it would be meat and the menu described it as ""crispy sweet breads with fennel"". It was listed in the appetizer section, so it is very reasonable to assume that a dish described as bread would actually be bread! Apparently the server had not relayed to the person taking the order that I'm vegan so she didn't warn me. When I saw the meat on my plate, I called the original server over and handed him the plate. I told him that it was meat and I'm vegan. He responded ""well, it's sweet breads"". I told him that I thought it was bread. He then said ""yes, sweetbreads"". He didn't even apologize for the misunderstanding or offer to bring something else. How is this acceptable?The desserts were a particular source of disappointment. I ordered the lychee-anise sorbet, which wasn't my favorite, but I was expecting an unusual flavor so that's fine. Four people ordered the chocolate tart with ice cream but three of them found the chocolate to be intensely bitter and inedible. Another couple ordered the peaches and cream dessert but both thought it lacked flavor and wasn't sufficiently sweet.Considering that 8 people ordered appetizers, entrees, desserts, and countless drinks, I would have expected MUCH better service. I will not be back again.",3,2,1,Cassandra B.,"Brooklyn, NY",146,881,349
4.0,7/22/2012,Came here for restaurant week tonight. This was my first time here and I really liked that it had outdoor seating so we asked to be seated there. It was a nice night so it was perfect for that.  We started off with the Cavatelli and the mushroom consomme. The cavatelli was absolutely delicious and I loved how fresh the summer melons were and the puree that they used. My friend really enjoyed the mushroom consomme as well. We then had the grilled chicken and duck breast for our entree. I enjoyed the duck breast but was not a fan of the spaetzle that was served with it. It was my first time having it and I simply did not like the texture of it. The grilled chicken was tender and moist but unfortunately the entire dish tasted burnt due to the burnt skin. We had the buttermilk panna cotta and ice cream and sorbet for dessert. The panna cotta was delicious and refreshing as was the ice cream and sorbet. Service here was attentive and super friendly. I loved the atmosphere of this place and was really pleasantly surprised by the portions that were served considering it was restaurant week.,1,0,1,Joyce L.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,288,470
4.0,7/22/2012,"Review for RW Summer 2012The hubby and I dined here tonight. We got to sit outside and enjoyed the beautiful weather and view. Ambiance was perfect.Next, our server, Michael was really great and made our dinner just that much better.  We started with warm fresh bread, which wasn't anything special, but was good. For our starter we tried the grilled calamari and the oxtail pasta. Hands down the pasta was the winner. The pasta had a nice kick to it. The pasta may have been a little undercooked, but the flavor/sauce was really good so we didn't care. The calamari was nice and light. The greens (the restaurant grows their own produce) were really fresh. For our mains, we had the pork chop and duck. I remember really liking the pork chop the first time I dined here and I liked it even better this time around. Not only juicy, but the peaches and collard greens were perfect with it. The hubby got the duck b/c our server recommended it and he said it was really good, but liked my pork chop better. For dessert, we tried three, the beignets, the panna cotta and the peaches and cream. I've previously tried the beignets and was disappointed, but not this time. They were light and fluffy and went well with the homemade berry preserve/compote. The peaches and cream was good as the peaches were fresh, but I didn't find them that special. The panna cotta on the other was really good and was really good my first time here. Yes, it's on the smaller side, but by the time you are on this course, you might just want a little something.This is a great place to dine even if it's not RW, but coming during RW makes it that much better!",1,0,0,Michelle H.,"New York, NY",191,497,6
5.0,7/22/2012,"Many thanks to Tom Colicchio for opening Riverpark on the East side. The ambiance is great - very similar to Tom's West side restaurant. Lovely views along the East River. Outside seating even for just casual drinks, for big groups.The best thing about this place is that it has its own garden - and most of the vegetables served there are grown locally right outside the restaurant. That just stole my heart. Cant get fresher than that!My cocktail - The Marascha Frizz was amazing!! Its Prosecco with a marachino cherry liqueur - yum and refreshing and takes the sweetness away from the Prosecco - just right!We had the grilled fresh mackerel, and grilled octopus appetizers! I have never tasted anything so yummy as the grilled mackerel before. I have rarely seen it even served at most restaurants.We took the sea bass, and the scallops for entrees and both those were amazing too :). The sea bass had a special tapenade and asparagus puree - yummy as it can get.

This was the best God damn avocado on the best God damn bread I've ever had. Hands down.Entree:I had a pork belly sandwich with a fried egg and fries. If you've never had pork belly, you are missing out! This sandwich was near perfection!

5.0,7/20/2012,"I dined here last night with a couple of friends for Restaurant Week.  Although I have a huge crush on Tom Colicchio and love watching him on Top Chef, I'd never actually eaten at one of his restaurants and was very excited about it! I was incredibly impressed with both the food and the friendly/accommodating service.  We sat outside to take advantage of the view and the break from the heat wave, and while it was very nice, the cars driving by on the FDR were a bit loud.  (I can't blame that on the restaurant though!)  For my first course, I had the avocado and hamachi salad.  I was pleasantly surprised by the serving size as I assumed it would be tiny for restaurant week.  While it was $5 extra, it was worth it - fresh and delicious with just the right amount of spice and, of course, the presentation was almost as impressive as the taste.  One of my friends tried the calamari salad and said she thoroughly enjoyed it.   For my main course, I had the pork chop - again, the serving was larger than I expected for restaurant week and I ate the entire thing.  It was flavorful and not the slightest bit dry which is often the downfall of pork dishes, in my opinion.  One of my friends ordered the duck breast and said it was delicious.  Finally, for my dessert, I chose the ice cream with peaches and sponge cake and my friends both chose the chocolate tart.  They both said the tart was fantastic.  My dessert was ""ok"" but I wouldn't necessarily rely on my opinion when it comes to dessert because I don't have much of a sweet tooth.  Between the $5 extra charge for the appetizer and the bottle of wine, my portion came to $69.  Worth every penny!",0,0,0,Meri S.,"New York, NY",50,137,0
3.0,7/13/2012,"Didn't get that WOW factor I was expecting......First off let me start by saying that if you aren't typically going to a lot of top notch restaurants in the area you will most likely really enjoy your experience. Unfortunately for the folks at RIverpark I was going in expecting something along the lines of Craft due to the fact that Tom Colicchio had his name attached to it, and while my girlfriend and I were blown away at Craft we were left wanting something better at Riverpark.The ambience is nice, very modern and secluded in the bottom of an office building along the FDR drive, we were seated in the main room and didn't really have a few but the decor was nice. The service was very good, so no complaints there. I had the gnocchi (which 3 of the 4 people in my party had) and they were good but again not as good as the ones that were at Craft and didn't leave me craving more. I had a panna cotta for desert which was executed as far as presentation but not in flavor. Last but not least my girlfriend became very stuffed up during the meal and actually felt sick and then about 30 minutes after we left she felt fine so it must have been something in the air in the restaurant, not totally sure that could be helped but still thought it should be included.

YUM!  tender oxtail, and deep flavor, but still light.  Then I had the diver scallops & my friend had the duck breast.  the scallops were seared perfectly and tender.  I thought my friend's duck breast should have more crispier skin and the fat rendered more, but it had a wonderful flavor and was tender.  We somehow managed to splurge for dessert even after all these bites... so we had a scoop of the white chocolate mint ice cream and the affogato, which is a layered light dessert of vanilla ice cream, espresso merengue  and cocoa nibs and i forget what else, but it was great!     We had a waitress who was in training, she did a great job, was very happy, attentive and recommended all the dishes we tried.  Since we loved them all, we are completely stoked on the service, the bartending and the whole thing.  their large garden on the block lets you know you are getting fresh, crispy veg and that is fantastic!  a great place with a great view.  our bill was high, but hey, we had like 10 drinks, and ate so much food, and for me, it was worth the expense for the treat of going to a great NYC restaurant & splurging a bit on cash and calories,  so you will hear no complaints from me about the cost. getting there- just get to 29th street and walk east till you nearly end up in the water, and it's there on your right inside an office bldg.",0,0,0,Aimee S.,"Farmington, CT",0,7,0

My appetizer was the sweetbreads, though they are now served differently. They weren't as tender as I'd like and overall a very meh dish. For my pasta dish, the only good part of the dish was the actual pasta, which was clearly freshly made, but I thought the seafood was a little tasteless. I don't recall the dishes my wife ordered, but she too was very underwhelmed by the food. I honestly wouldn't go back unless someone invited me along to the restaurant.

5.0,6/21/2012,"I was fortunate enough to try this fantastic restaurant on the first day of Summer with good company=)  Originally, I wanted to sit outside given the east river views and expected breeze, but there was none whatsoever on this blistering day! To start, I ordered my usual Grey Goose martini straight up with a twist; followed by a dozen east coast oysters. The oysters were fresh and delicious and much needed given such weathering conditions! For entrées we ordered the Branzino and Duck Breast.  I believe the Branzino was wood fired, given its smokey and crispy skin. It was delicately plated with sautéed artichokes, nicoise olives, white anchovies, onion and bronze fennel.  It was notably the best Branzino I have ever eaten, and I live in Astoria among all the Greek restaurants! The Duck Breast too was unbelievable.  It was cooked to perfection with morels, gingered peas, rhubarb and spaetzle. The sweetness from the rhubarb, accompanied with fungi(morels) and puréed peas, gave it a unique plethora of flavors.  For dessert, we ordered the peanut caramel chocolate tart.  I love chocolate ganache, but when paired with caramel corn and marshmallow, felt it  was a bit too lush for my liking-although some would disagree=) . The only con I had about Riverpark was the service.   The restaurant was not overly busy given the weather,  and 6:30 pm reservation.  I usually give everyone the benefit of the doubt, so maybe it had been this specific waitress or the fact that we were in the far corner by the window where it was difficult to be seen?????

With the map printed from the restaurant's website, it was easy to find the attached parking lot and I appreciated that the parking was free if you ask them to validate the ticket after your meal. Most of the dishes were delicious! Light fizzy mimosas. Delicious ham and cheese, hamburger, and brisket. All worthy of a Top Chef restaurant. But those were my family's dishes. I decided to go with a classic brunch item - the French Toast. It was disappointing... too dry/crispy to cut. I had to hold it like a bruschetta to eat it. So silly. Also, my Bloody Mary was salty to the level of it being almost impossible to drink. Thinking back on it, I should have sent it back and requested something else. But the outdoor weather was too pleasant for me to stay grumpy. I'm planning on coming back. It seems obvious that the strength of this restaurant is it's lunch fare and location.

2.0,4/23/2012,"I'm confused. After reading the reviews here, I expected something incredible and was more than disappointed with the experience. I've eaten at plenty of swanky, top of the line places and never had such an underwhelming experience.To begin, I came here with a large group to celebrate the birthday of two friends. We were about 10 people in our mid/late twenties and I do feel this had something to do with the poor experience. We were brushed off, made to feel second class and rushed through our meal. While waiting for our table and for everyone to arrive, we sat at the bar for some drinks. I couldn't decide what I wanted, so I asked the bartender ""what would you recommend?"" she didn't even look me in the eye, pointed down at the menu and said ""all the signature cocktails are good"" turned her back and walked away from me. She never came back to take my order. Once we sat down, we were seated at a table that I swear would have sat six people comfortably. We were all on top of each other and my seat had a place mat that was coming off the end of the table, there was no way I was spending this kind of money to eat at the corner of a table and couldn't even cross my legs...so we asked for a bigger table and they delivered (because they had to). Once we all sat down, the manager announces to all of us ""you're going to have to order soon cause the kitchen is closing."" Mind you, this was around 10 PM, what kind of restaurant on a Friday night in New York closes the kitchen at 10 PM? Even if that was the case, you don't announce that to a table that is about to spend upwards of $600 on a meal! After we move tables, our server proceeded to walk around and his introduction to us was ""what can I do for you?"" Not one introduction, what was his name? He was serving us for the evening, would have been nice to know who he was... he didn't list any of the specials, just rushed us through the order. He also didn't even take our drink orders until about 10 minutes after taking our entree order. To top it all off, my friend and I decide we would like to order dessert for the two birthday girls, after asking the server to bring over two desserts with candles at the end of the meal he insisted on making it clear that the dessert was not complimentary. He must have reiterated this about 4 times ""OK, I can do that, but it will not be complimentary..."" We get it. This isn't TGI Fridays, we are all adults and never expected that in a restaurant of this caliber that dessert was free, I'm not sure what gave him that impression, but I did feel discriminated, that as a group of young people we weren't sophisticated enough to eat at a place like this. He didn't even wish either of the two birthday girls a Happy Birthday!!! Oh! And he almost ruined the surprise, when we saw him bringing over the dessert menus and when I asked him what he was doing he said ""I was going to see what they wanted to order for their birthday dessert.."" Unbelievable. Either we got stuck with the shitiest, most under-trained server in the house, or in general, the service here is just unprofessional, rude and cold. We were very vocal throughout the meal about how unhappy we were and not once did the manager come by to check in on us, or ask us how things were going. I guess they were too busy tending to their ""regulars."" About the food -  it was good. Octopus was actually delicious and the Oxtail pasta was tasty as were the Churros and chocolate.. cocktails were good too..I really enjoyed the Drunken Pear. The one thing saving this review from one star is that the food was not nearly as disappointing as the dud of a server we got... whatever his name is.",1,0,0,Amelia G.,"Pinecrest, FL",141,23,0
4.0,4/22/2012,"Overall we had a really delightful evening at Riverpark despite a few minor things. My parents had a long layover at JFK and came into the city to meet me for dinner. I chose Riverpark because we were dining pretty early and I knew my mom would appreciate the view of the East river.We arrived early for our 6:30 reservations and were seated promptly at a table next to window. As an FYI,most of the window tables are for two and they say they are ""first come, first serve"" even with a reservation. Such a nice view, you don't even notice the FDR. The inside of the restaurant is great too, sleek and well done. Our server Erin was friendly and attentive.The menu makes great use of the produce grown right outside of the restaurant. For starters, i had the consomee, my mom had the grilled calamari, and my dad had the smoked ricotta gnocchi. All excellent and perfectly portioned to leave room for the entrees!For mains I had the sea bass, my mom had the chicken, and my dad tried the lamb.I really did not like the sea bass itself. The flavor seemed off, even a little fishy. It may have been the white anchovies. I did love the vegetables it was served with though! I would say the chicken was the best out of the three but someone in the kitchen was heavy handed with the salt. We rounded out the meal with a smoked chocolate ganache and caramel popcorn dessert that was new to the menu. The smokiness of the ganache was almost too much for me but overall it was good!I should mention we tried some GREAT wines, I didn't want to stop drinking. My dad said the wine list was well put together and he also noted that the mark up was outrageous. Total bill for the three of us was $500 but we did drink a lot of wine. Not in any rush to go back for dinner but  I do want to go back to try brunch out on the terrace!

Initially went to sit outside - beautiful river views and the heat lamps kept it warm - but the highway is a little too close for comfort, and quite loud. Ended up sitting inside right by the window, which was just as good. Service was great - waiter was very sweet and super attentive/helpful.Ate:- Salad of baby lettuces - greens were clearly fresh, but shallot vinaigrette was a little strong for me - overpowered the greens- Roasted monkfish - the fish itself was wellcooked but was over a strange conglomeration of chopped butternut squash, tiny cubes of prosciutto and greens. Was expecting all those ingredients to be more independent - kind of ended up with a strange oatmeal like mix. Everything was a little too salty for me.- Husband got the grilled chicken. Sounded boring but probably the BEST chicken we've ever had. Completely crisp on the outside, obscenely tender on the inside. Perfectly flavored. I don't really eat meat and was majorly impressed.- Side of crispy fingerling potatoes = DELICIOUS. Salty and sometimes almost vaguely sweet. Perfectly crisp. Get them.- Dessert: Affogato. Vanilla gelato with a frozen espresso meringue, tiny crispy espresso/chocolate nibs and 2 espresso cookies. Tasty and light. Not life changing, but a good dessert.",26,0,25,Kathryn B.,"New York, NY",0,20,0
2.0,4/9/2012,"We had a poor service experience a couple weeks ago at Riverpark.  This was the 75 degree Thursday in March, and 2 days prior, I had googled something like ""best outdoor dining NYC"" and Riverpark was one of the places that showed up.  We've been to Colichioo and Sons maybe 20 times, Craftbar maybe 10 times, and shit we even ate at Craftsteak before they turned it into & Sons., so we were eager to try Riverpark for the first time and sit outside on a great early spring night.  We had a 6:45 reservation; I showed up at about 6:15, checked in, and had a drink at the bar while waiting for my wife.  When I made our reservation on Open Table I requested a seat outside if available.  My wife showed up close to on time, maybe about 6:48.  When I got there at 6:15 almost half of the nice tables on the terrace were open.  As I sat there for half an hour I noticed many people being taken outside to take up those tables, including 2 guys seated to my left at the bar who decided spur of the moment to dine outside.  After my wife arrived the waiter came and got us and took us outside to one of the picnic tables on the terrace - much less nice and not what anybody prefers when they ask to be sat outside at this restaurant.  Hey the picnic tables are great, but great for beers with friends, not a romantic dinner with your wife.  That isn't what we were looking for.  To make matters worse, as we were shown outside to the picnic table, 3 people were right behind us and took the very last table on the terrace, a 4 top, which I asked if we could sit at after being shown the picnic table.  No dice.  I was also there about 25 minutes before this party of 3.When we complained the waiter took us to a decent table inside by the window and said, and I do quote, ""we will take care of you"".  Now I don't know about you, but I've eaten at enough restaurants to know what that means.  It means, something(s) will be comped to pay for the fact that we screwed you over on the table you specifically requested, but that we sat a bunch of random people at even though you were here before them paying for a drink at our bar while you waited for your wife.Now during dinner at our table by the window, one of the hosts or mater d's came by to literally every table around us to ask how dinner was.  He didn't stop at our table.  Hmm, wonder why?  I would have loved to explain our disappointment.  The food was mostly great.  Loved the octopus, the tartare and the grilled cheese.  The burger was average and 2 of our 6 oysters had shell in them.  When we got the bill, lo and behold, nothing was comped.  We had 5 drinks, 6 oysters, 2 apps and 2 entrees.  We mentioned this to the waitress who called the manager over.Graciously, the manager wiped 3 of the 5 drinks off the bill and said he would love to make sure we get to sit outside next time we come.  Very nice.  But, he also made it a point to mention that outside seating is ""first come first served"".  OH really?  Then how did all those tables get taken while I was first to the restaraunt, spending money in your bar?  I didn't get a chance to say this because he was in and out in a flash.It was really a 1 star experience but I'll give it 2 stars because I'm in a great god damn mood tonight.We expected a whole lot more.  This place needs to figure out the front of the house and how to take care of guests and guest requests, it needs to actually honor first come first served, and it also needs to learn how to properly shuck an oyster.",1,1,0,I H.,"New York, NY",2,21,0

The ceiling looks like you're sitting out doors under the stars the décor is elegant and modern, the waiters are engaging and attentive. Then you get the menu and it all goes down hill, it took so long to order because nothing sounded great, and it wasn't.

We both moved on to pasta, again bland, where are the fresh herbs and flavor???? Now, I have to tell you about the Sweet Potato Gnocchi w/ Blood orange, hazelnut and tarragon, sounds delicious right?

I like places that put a lot of attention and care into the simplest menu items because I can only expect that things get better from there!My grilled bread was thick and perfect covered with layers of avocado drizzled with amazing olive oil and some sea salt.

Actually being able to look out onto anything is a plus here, and the floor-to-ceiling windows makes it genuinely quite spectacular. The food and service were excellent. My main, the duck with chocolate, was amazing. I love duck, and I love chocolate. Putting the two together is an unusual combination, but it worked. Bravo, sir.

4.0,2/21/2012,"This was the first restaurant we went to when we arrived in NYC and after the stressful ride over there, the experience was great. We went during Restaurant Week so we had reservations and were seated next to a window, per my request on OpenTable. The view was spectacular, overlooking the East River, and the decor inside is almost as impressive. Contemporary with lots of hand-crafted wood pieces, including an amazing bar area.They start you off with a huge piece of bread and butter, which was delicious. Then the RW menu came with an appetizer, entree, and dessert. For the appetizers, my sister and I chose the Charcuterie plate and the Caesar salad (complete with whole anchovies). Both were out of this world delicious, although I must warn you, while delicious, the mustard that comes with the Charcuterie plate is knock your socks off spicy. A little bit goes a long way. For the entrees, my sister got the Pork Ragu with homemade Paparadelle pasta and I got the Oyster tacos. The Ragu wasn't my favorite, but my sister LOVED it. The Oyster tacos were incredibly flavorful. Each taco (3 in total) had 2 HUGE oysters along with a pickled cabbage mixture (similar to kimchee, but with Spanish flavors instead of Asian), lime, and fresh jalapenos. Definitely a party in my mouth.For dessert, more deliciousness. The beignet donuts w/ Espresso and Chocolate dipping sauces and the Chocolate Pot de Creme. Both were just the right amount of sweet and were the perfect end to the incredibly flavorful first 2 courses. All in all, great portion sizes for all courses and it provided us with a great first impression to NYC's dining scene.I definitely would suggest this place for a trendy business lunch, or happy hour/dinner with friends as this place is made to have a cocktail while watching the sunset.",0,0,0,Jackie D.,"Baton Rouge, LA",254,321,155

4.0,2/11/2012,"My girlfriend and I came here for Restaurant Week, Summer 2011. We had a reservation later in the evening, around 9 or so. Just a heads up for anyone coming here - don't turn right on East 29th Street. This only leads to a cul-de-sac driveway in front of the restaurant. Instead, from First Ave, turn right at E 30th St. towards the East River. At the stop sign, take a hard right onto the FDR Service Road (E 26th St) - do not proceed onto the FDR ramp. The entrance to the garage is located on the right. Parking is validated for up to 3 hours of dining, which is quite nice. To find the restaurant, just walk towards the back right of the Alexandria Center's lobby.Anyways, we came here on a hot summer night and by the time we arrived, the skies let loose and it had started to pour. When we were being seated, we were given a choice of the indoor main dining room or the outdoor patio. We chose the patio, which was under an overhang. There was something incredibly romantic about eating outside on a hot night, with a strong downpour that cooled everything off, with the lights of Brooklyn off in the distance.To drink, we had two of their Temperance Coolers - the Charlie Temple and I can't remember the other one. The Charlie Temple, which I had, was good, but standard. There wasn't much difference between this drink and a Shirley Temple, except perhaps that the lemon-lime soda was made in-house. I can't remember which one my gf had, but in any event, neither of those items are on the menu anymore.For our appetizers, I had the Salmon Tartare (White gazpacho, yuzu, cucumber, Thai basil, salmon roe) while my gf had the Mushroom Consommé (Mushroom salad, frisée, Pecorino crouton, spring garlic). The Salmon Tartare was delicious, but a very tiny portion. It was very fresh. The Mushroom Consommé was flavorful, light and not at all the wrong choice for a hot evening.For our main course, I had the Squid Ink Chitarra with Calamari, octopus, shrimp, lemon, and Fresno chiles. My gf had the Berkshire Pork Chop with Fava beans and baby carrot-spring onion hash. The pasta was a huge portion and quite good. They definitely didn't skimp on the seafood added to the pasta. The pork chop was good too, but a bit fatty, but it was quite juicy and flavorful.For dessert, I had the sorbet trio, which was standard. I can't remember the flavors, but nothing really stood out. The individual scoops were huge tho. My gf had the Beignets with Vanilla custard, strawberry preserves. Prior to ordering the Beignets, we asked our server if they were light and she said they were. However, we found the Beignets to be quite the opposite. Lesson learned.Overall, the service here was quite attentive. The main dining room wasn't too full, but it also could've just been late. The outdoors, however, was quite full, yet the service was always attentive, despite the amount of people dining outdoors.All in all, the food was good, but didn't blow me away. I'd suggest this place if you'd like to dine outdoors enjoy some good food in a unique environment. You will definitely get your money's worth here for RW. The restaurant and especially the outdoor dining area becomes more intimate as it gets later and less people are around. Definitely cozy.

4.0,2/1/2012,"Was looking for a different place to try during Restaurant Week and I noticed Riverpark did a lunch that is 1 block from my job! The menu looked great and so did the reviews so I went yesterday with a coworker.We were seated next to the window overlooking the East River on a beautiful day when our waitress quickly arrived and brought us our menus and asked our choice of water. We looked over the menu and I ordered the Charcuterie Plate (Soppressata, cacciatorini, prosciutto, grilled bread), Buckwheat Pappardelle (Pork ragu, fennel, pine nuts, sweet potato) and the Beignets w Chocolate sauce and espresso custard. My coworker wanted to order the Cheese Empanada app he saw online but it was not offered on the menu so he went with the Charred Eggplant & Goat Cheese Bruschetta but the waitress suggested Roasted Provolone which came on a sizzling skillet with Oregano, garlic, pickled chiles. That sounded great so he went with that but we saw many orders of the bruschetta going by and it looked awesome. For entree he got the Pork Steak (Hen of the Woods, cippolini, cranberries, swiss chard) and Chocolate Pot de Crème w Caramel sandwich cookies.The meat plate was fantastic with about 4 delicious, fresh slices of the soppressata and proscuitto and 3 large, thick, crusty, grilled bread slices, a couple of olives, and a spicy mustard (go easy, it'll clear your sinuses). His cheese came bubbling on the hot skillet also with grilled bread.  Both were very very good. We waited a bit for the entrees which was not good being on a time limit but then they arrived. The pasta dish was a small portion but very tasty with the pappardelle cooked much softer than you would expect but it worked. Some might not order since buckwheat would give them the impression it would change the taste but you could not tell the difference. The pork steak was a large thin piece that was extremely tender but seemed to lack any distinct flavor, it was good though.Dessert was a great cap on things. I got 4 small pillows of fried dough, hollow inside, that I dipped first into the espresso cream which tasted like a burnt caramel (in a good way) but when I dipped in the chocolate, I let out quite the inappropriate groan...yes it's that good!! Just pure, rich, GREAT quality chocolate. The pot de creme was a small ramikin of airy chocolate mousse with 1 miniscule cookie on the side, also a good choice.For $24.07 it was a great value for the quality of food and service (our water glasses were never half empty) and I hear they also do a regular $28 3-course lunch menu which I would love to come back for another time.",0,0,1,Monica D.,"Rochelle Park, NJ",197,328,916

So I knew I had to go here for lunch when I got MLK day off - coincidentally also the first day of winter Restaurant Week!I usually go to a bunch of places during Restaurant Week and a recurring theme is that diners are more often than not given substandard service. Not the case at Riverpark! I never once felt like I was not a ""regular"" diner there - the service was just that good! Our server was supremely friendly and attentive, our water glasses were always filled, napkins were folded on the table if we got up, and we were even asked if we wanted more breadsticks without asking for it ourselves - something we happily said yes to as they were amazing - hot from the oven and chewy!The food? Also fantastic! It was so hard to choose what I wanted, which was actually a big positive since Riverpark had so many options available - a positive contrast from most Restaurant Week menus, which only offer 2-3 options per course. For my entrée, I had the roasted arctic char, which was very similar to salmon. Wonderfully prepared right down to the fingerling potatoes! Capers added a nice touch too. For dessert, I opted for the black forest sundae - also quite delicious. However, the highlight of my meal was (surprisingly) the appetizer. I got the charred eggplant and goat cheese bruschetta, something I would have never gotten if our server didn't suggest it. I highly highly recommend getting this - the eggplant had this great smoky flavor offset beautifully with a touch of honey.

They instantly helped us move our stuff and food before it got soaked. I was almost done with my appetizer but they replaced it anyway along with our drinks. I kept insisting it was okay - just a bit of rain, but they did it anyway. All the servers were kind and great at their jobs. The ceviche with watermelon and cucumber appetizer was so refreshing and the chocolate creme pot for dessert - to die for!

You'll pass, on the right, the adjacent Riverpark urban farm space (it's walled up with some windows for viewing) that supplies the produce you will be consuming next door. The farm looks like it's still under development, and is to be there temporarily until a new building is constructed in its place (at which time the farm will be moved elsewhere). Talk about ""farm to table."" For lunch RW, they only offer the RW menu, so you don't have to request the ""cheaper menu."" We had lunch (they offer 8 apps and 8 entrees) on MLK day. They don't do dinner for RW.Apps:Trevisano & Frisee Salad - Until now, I didn't know that Trevisano is a bitter red leafy radicchio. It seems like a lettuce that's better off cooked with something savory. The poached pear and spiced almonds in the salad were lovely.Braised Chicken Soup - There's more chicken, kale, and vegetables in the soup than soup itself, which is fine when you want a hearty but light start.EntreesBuckwheat Pappardelle - With minced pork ragu. The pasta was cooked on the soft side, but it was still delicious in the creamy sweet potato sauce.Roasted Arctic Char - Just like you'd expect from salmon.DessertsChocolate Pot de Creme - A standard chocolate mousse/custard.Beignets - Comes hot; these hot donuts dipped in the espresso custard was the BEST thing of the meal. The chocolate dip was ok too.So the fare was pretty standard. Service was attentive. The view of the river was nerve-settling, and dining outside would be a must in the spring/summer.

4.0,1/17/2012,"While Colicchio & Sons is still my favorite Colicchio establishment, Riverpark is a close second. I went for Restaurant Week with my husband and a friend for lunch, and I was really happy with both the food and the service. I had the chicken soup with braised kale, which was perfect (I often find that chicken soups are way too salty, but this one was clean tasting and delicious), followed by the pork steak with hen of the woods mushrooms and sour cherries (it was like a giant slab of pork belly covered in my absolute favorite mushrooms - that I first had at Craftsteak in Vegas and can't get enough of since - and the braised spinach and cranberry puree underneath were fantastic), and finished up with beignets with an espresso custard (I could have eaten the custard alone). This is a great deal for RW, and apparently they have $28 3-course lunches all year 'round, so definitely check it out, if not for the food, than for the beautiful view of the East River and the walk past the cool old Bellevue Hospital. I am really excited to check it out again in the spring or summer, to see what their garden is up to (they have one across the street).",0,0,0,Sydney K.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,348,5

4.0,1/12/2012,"Our reservation was late, 9:45, but we never felt rushed while waiting for another couple to arrive or while looking over the menu to order.   We pretty much closed out the restaurant but was never told to get up and leave because it's closing time!  One teeny tiny down side, my CC company called me as I was getting up from the meal, turns out they swiped my card 3 times for this dinner, resulting in a $1250 charge...Obviously it was an error but I didn't like the fact that the waiter and manager denied doing it when I approached them with it...So for that you get only 4 stars Riverpark!Let the eating begin!First Course: ~Avocado & Hamachi Salad w/pickled red onions, radish & charred chilies; ~Mushroom Consommé w/mushroom frisee, pecorino crouton, caramelized shallots; ~Squid Ink Chitarra w/calamari, octopus, shrimp, lemon & fresno chilles;~Pork Tortelloni w/turnips, red cabbage & sageAvocado & Hamachi was really fresh and velvety. I was told by my dining partner that the mushroom consommé looked impressive but it lacked a little body.  The Braised Pork Tortelloni were rich but not overly and went really well with the broth that came with.  And the Squid Ink Chitarra had a nice bite to the handmade pasta, seafood was tender and the overall dish had a nice lemon briney note to it, overall a great start.Second Course: ~10oz. Berkshire Pork w/brussels sprouts-apple hash & parsnips puree; ~Grilled Flatiron Steak& Braised Brisket w/broccoli, fork smashed potatoes & balsamic glazed cippolinis; ~Roasted Leg of Lamb w/ swiss chard, pine nuts, capers, raisins, eggplant & oregano. Usually in restaurants like this I steer clear of the steak, unless I'm at Lugers :), but I have to say the Flatiron steak was the winner here because of the nice generous portion of braised brisket that comes with it.  Actually no, the entire dish was very well executed.The Berkshire Pork was a very close second as well.  Tender and juicy with the right amount of sweet and savory from the accompanying sides.The roasted leg of lamb....let me just put out there that I LOVE lamb.  But for some reason I didn't love this.  There was waaay too much going on the plate, too many flavors and components that just didn't jive.  In the middle of eating it, I seriously couldn't remember if I ordered lamb or pork because that lovely sultry gamey flavor of lamb was so masked. Tom Colicchio should really reconstruct this one because it does have the potential to be amazing.Third Course: ~Sheep milk Yogurt Cheesecake w/roasted figs, preserved walnuts, anise hyssop; ~Beignets w/vanilla custard & strawberry preserves The cheesecake was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Totally made up for the lack luster lamb! It was rich, creamy, light and smooth all in one.  The beignets were very good as well, crunchy exterior with a very soft light middle. Prices definitely matched the quality of each dish, ok not the lamb but the rest of them did, and the portions are generous as well.  Service & staff was unobtrusive but very friendly and knowledgeable as well.   Overall I would definitely go back and recommend the restaurant.

1.0,1/4/2012,"Save your money. Stay away.1)Food - everything we ordered (mushroom consomme, salmon tartare, duck breast, and Squid ink spaghetti alla chitarra) was either tasteless or so overly salted it was inedible. The mushroom consomme was cold and boring. The salmon tartare was tiny with no flavor except for the few salmon roe they put on top. Even the sauce they put on the plate tasted like nothing. The duck was the best thing we had, but even that was tiny and boring. Last, the squid ink chitarra was so salty I could not eat it. My boyfriend was shocked because I love very salty food. Overall, we paid a large amount for bad food. 2) Service - The service is even worse than the food. At first, our waiter would not give us a chance to even look at the menu, returning in 60 second increments to see if we were ready to order yet. When asked for recommendations or for descriptions of specific menu items he was useless and had no opinion. We finally ordered our meal along with drinks. The waiter came with our drinks and this was the last time we saw him until he tried to give us a dessert menu. My boyfriends glass of wine was more like a half glass, and the cocktail I ordered not only tasted off, but was lukewarm.  The food starts coming out and we end up leaving most of it on the plate. The salmon tartare was tiny but we didn't even finish it due to lack of any flavor. The entire pasta dish was left almost untouched and my cocktail full. We couldn't even find the waiter to express our concerns. Finally a bus boy came and just cleared our plates. Only after that does the waiter make an appearance. He did not ask how everything was, but just handed us the dessert menu. We paid the $115 dollar check and went to go get dinner elsewhere. 3) Value - see above4) Location/Ambiance - go to this restaurant if you like to dine in complete silence. About 90% empty while it was difficult to get a rez anywhere else that night. This place is in the middle of nowhere, next to a hospital and a highway, not actually on the river as advertised. During the day if you sit outside I suppose the view would be nice.

4.0,12/18/2011,"Riverpark, one of Tom Colicchio's restaurants, is tucked away inside the Alexandria Center. On the way there, you may spot the farm which is around the corner.  They grow their produce for the restaurant there.  Since everything was covered, we didn't see much, but there were a number of placards sprawled across the walls explaining the concept... pretty neat.  Inside the restaurant, my husband and I lucked out with a table overlooking the East River.  We ordered the squid ink chitarra.  The pasta, octopus, calamari, and shrimp were great, but the sauce was a bit too oily and the Fresno chiles a bit too spicy for me (although my husband loved the kick it added).  My berkshire pork chop was beautifully cooked and surprisingly moist.  The brussel sprout-apple hash provided a pretty good contrast of flavors.  I didn't get a chance to try my husband's monkfish, although he enjoyed it.  They also have a outdoor dining area for when the weather gets nicer, and even a private farm table for family-style shared eating in the farm itself!",1,0,0,Mandy L.,"New York, NY",115,623,1591

Smaller tables are along the windows and have the best views, and some of the larger tables have partial views as well. The dining room is spacious and quiet. The food was excellent. The people at my table got pork chops, lamb, steak and fish. Everyone loved the food. The pork eaters said these were the best pork chops they had tasted. The sorbet was delicious, especially the pear sorbet. Beignets were a little rubbery. The service here is truly superb and made the delicious meal and lovely setting all the more memorable. The server was very knowledgeable and helpful. We asked about the greenhouse and he explained which ingredients in our dishes were from the garden and what crops we could look forward to when we come back in the spring time. We asked one of the guys to take our picture, and he was so thoughtful, suggesting that we go onto the terrace where there would be less of a glare.

5.0,12/8/2011,"Truly one of the most unique dining experiences I have ever had. After convincing my taxi driver to turn into the unmarked road leading to the river, I was met by a futuristic office building with an organic garden outside. Upon entering Riverpark, I was immediately transported to something that looks like it could be the backdrop for a scene from a Mission Impossible movie. At night, the restaurant's minimalist furnishing and low light draw your eyes immediately to the wrap-around floor-to-ceiling windows.  Through which, one gets an unusually unobstructed view of the East River-- I half-expected Tom Cruise to rappel out of a hovering helicopter and shatter the glass. And who knew Queens would ever look so good?! The staff at this restaurant are warm (not something I have always experienced at other ""high-end"" restaurants), extremely well informed, and all around on-point. The seasonal menu, which features fresh ingredients from the garden outside, is delicious. On the night I visited, I tried a cheese plate, fried cod balls with lemon curd sauce, Braised ribs served with black potatoes and an amazing red-wine reduction, asparagus (perfectly seared), and then pretty much every desert on the menu. All were delicious. And the wine choices recommended by my server both perfectly complemented the food, as well as stood out as delicious by themselves.As a bonus, the cocktails here happen to be delicious and innovative as well. Try the ""Dark and Stormy""! If I were into having affairs, I would totally choose to bring my f.b. to visit the bar here on a wintery night. It seems like that kind of place.Overall, I give Riverpark and A+.

3.0,11/2/2011,"First of all, if 3 1/2 stars were an option, I would have rated this restaurant as such.  So to be clear, it was better than a 3, but not quite a 4.  Here's why...For one, the restaurant is beautiful.  Very elegant, great views of the east river, and the hostess was extremely pleasant.  My waiter was equally friendly and attentive.  Merely walking in made up for the somewhat inconvenient location.  It is definitely off the beaten path, and not easily accessible by subway.  But I digress. I began with a glass of Riesling.  I've been served a larger glass of wine in my day, but our waiter also brought four glasses of champagne on the house for my brother's birthday.  With that said, it made up for the stingy pour.We each received one piece of bread, hot to the touch, on our individual dinner roll plates.  The first few bites were enjoyable, but I found that as soon as it began to cool off, the bread became hard to chew.As an appetizer, I ordered the Mushroom Consomme.  It arrived on the table as a bowl of mushroom salad, frisee, pecorino crouton and caramelized shallots.  The waiter then poured the broth in front of me, which I prefer, since you know your soup hasn't been sitting out getting cold.  I have a bit of a sore throat and was looking forward to the hot broth.  However, it was surprisingly lukewarm.  Make no mistake, it was tasty.  Very flavorful, and I liked the various textures of the mushrooms, frisee and the soup soaked crouton.  But hot it was not, my friends.  Additionally, I didn't feel like I was given my $14 worth.  I'm not asking for more of the individual ingredients, but we're talking broth here.  Would it kill them to fill the bowl a little higher?Moving on, I ordered the Roasted Leg of Lamb as my main course.  We waited quite a while for our entrees.  Not for lack of attention by our waiter.  It just seems the kitchen is a tad slow.  Fortunately, though it took some time to come out, the lamb was delicious!  Accompanied by swiss chard, pinenuts, capers, golden raisins, eggplant and oregano, I was very pleased.  The meat was soft and juicy.   Had I not started with the soup, I'm not sure the portion size would have been adequate.  But with an appetizer, you'll have plenty of food.  We also ordered a side of pole beans for the table.  Picked directly from Riverpark's own garden, they were good and very fresh.Both my mother and my brother ordered the Roasted Quail, served with salsify, concord grapes, greens and chanterelle mushrooms.  My brother let me try a bite.  Truth be told, he didn't love it.  Nor did I.  In all fairness, I should mention that my mother liked the dish a lot.  But I'm glad I opted for the lamb when deciding between the two entrees.We ended the evening with a few desserts amongst the four of us.  For one, we got the Plum Tart, which I really enjoyed!  It came with orange-buttermilk ice cream, cardamom creme anglaise and almond brittle.  Yum!  Very good!  The Affogato was interesting.  Comprised of vanilla ice cream, frozen espresso meringue, cocoa nibs and espresso cookie, it was nice, but not my favorite.  Lastly, in honor of the birthday boy, we were served a Chocolate Pot de Creme on the house.  It was light and very tasty.  I liked it a lot!  For the record, should you be dining at Riverpark for a birthday, they don't bring over a candle or an entourage of waiters singing painfully off key.  So if that's what you're looking for, I suggest you go to TGI Fridays.  They simply wrote ""Happy Birthday"" in chocolate syrup on one of the dessert plates.  Understated, but fitting for the mood of the restaurant.  Looking back, I'm completely okay without the singing.  No need for a spectacle.  But I suppose a single candle couldn't hurt.So let's review.  The kitchen is slow, the food seems to be hit or miss and the portions are not great for the price.  But to end on a positive note, the ambiance is lovely, the decor is beautiful, the view is stunning and the staff is very, very pleasant.  It's worth a try if you're not in a rush and you order the lamb :)",3,2,1,Shira D.,"Manhattan, NY",482,28,79
2.0,10/26/2011,Unfortunately my love affair with Riverpark has ended. Even if the space is gorgeous..... the service has killed it for me..... and I will never be back.Came here for dinner with a bunch of girlfriends on a Friday night. No complaints about the food at all that night. We ordered a few appetizers to share and each got an entree and enjoyed the food and company. What was disturbing that night was the fact that we can hear a bunch of waiters congregating nearby each arguing who was going to serve (or not serve) which table. There even seemed to be a manager present that participated (NOT directed as he should of) this absurd and inappriopriate conversation as to who had too many tables and thus should not get another. They didn't even have the courtesy to sort this out behind the scenes. Should a restaurant of this caliber and this many months under its belt still be figuring out staffing issues????!!!Then this week decided to drop by for a lunch since the weather was gorgeous. Hostess was very nice and selected a nice table for us. The busboy came immediately to get us water and bread.. but then that was it... we waited a while before a waiter came (said waiter was the same waiter I had previously mentioned in my review..). He came by and we asked him for the wine list.. and he gruffiingly said he'll go get it. Then we waited and waited.. he finally came back with it but basically handed it over as if he was doing us a great favor... then we waited and waited and waited and waited... and I  had enough. Obviously our waiter does not enjoy his job.. nor is he very good at it. And to have been seated for almost 30 minutes and no one to come by to take our order is unacceptable. So we did the unthinkable... we got up and left.. and not even a person in sight to complain about this horrible service to......Service (specifically the wait staff) has always been the thorn in my overall rave about Riverpark... and now it seems like it's the end all for my love affair with this restaurant.

2.0,10/10/2011,"I had very high expectations from this restaurant after reading the reviews on Yelp and browsing the website. The decor and ambiance of Riverpark were exceptional, I will give it that. My boyfriend and I had a lovely table by the window and enjoyed the dim lighting and drinks (I had the silver sun, which I loved and he got the smokey manhattan; however, both had very little alcohol in them). I was disappointed when it came to food. As an appetizer he got the cavatelli. The lamb pieces were delicious, but slightly overpowered by the pasta. He picked all the lamb out and left most of the pasta. I got the ceviche, which was very very sour and salty. For our entrees he got the flatiron steak, which was cold. It came with brisket that he had one bite of because it just was not very appetizing. I had the duck breast, which was cold as well and VERY chewy. Again, disappointing since I absolutely love duck and thought such a highly esteemed restaurant would be able to cook it perfectly. One last complaint: the service. While the servers were very nice, they were inattentive. We sat with our plates in front of us for both courses for at least a half hour after we finished eating. Our dinner altogether took about 2.5 hours, which was fine because we had a lot to talk about, but in any other case this would have been very frustrating. We had to ask a busboy from another table to get our waiter to bring us another round of drinks because we hadn't seen him in 20-30 minutes.

It really was pretty breathtaking!As another reviewer stated, the wine portions were on the smaller side, but I actually liked that, and especially liked that they offered half glass options. I was able to try 2 different, excellent reds for the price of a full glass.The bread service is not big or filling, but again, I appreciated that - there wasn't a lot, but what they served was very good quality. I ordered a lamb dish, and my fiance got the steak. Both dishes were elegantly prepared, though I was a little envious of the steak... it was SO tender, it could basically melt in your mouth. Perfect. My lamb was high quality - it had a smoked flavor I wasn't wild about, but I definitely still enjoyed it.Then, my fiance pulled out the big guns after dinner & gave me an engagement ring as my gift, which was so special! : ) We actually got engaged back in May, but the ring took some special preparations, so it wasn't ready until last week. But the timing was great, and it was the perfect moment. The Riverpark staff was so kind & gave us an incredible dessert along with champagne on the house.

5.0,9/5/2011,"Delicious, and frikkin' beautiful restaurant.  Here follows my ode:1. Food: Grilled Flatiron Steak & Brisket and Duck Breast.  Best duck breast I've had: very tender and flavorful with blueberries and whatever other manna from heaven.  The steak dish was sadly a bit generic, although the seasonal tomatoes accompanying it were delicious - tasting more like the fruit they're supposed to be.  Also ate a chilled ceviche and watermelon appetizer.  Never thought I could like raw seafood, but the dish was very tastefully done with just the right contrast and balance of sweet and tart and texture.  A few yards away, an outdoor garden supplies the fresh seasonal veggies used in the dishes.  Went a-hunting for some strawberries, but wandered out of the garden maze sans goodies.  !!!  I almost forgot to mention the desserts: Creme Fraiche Panna and Black Sundae.  Panna: silky smooth, not overly sweet, but quite small :(.  The sundae more than compensated.  Moist Devil's food cake and creamy ice cream and nuts.  Enough to share :).  Loved it, except for the cherries.  What?!  Who wants real fruit hidden within her ice cream and cake??2. Atmosphere: What atmosphere!  Dimly lit and cozy table settings. Floor to ceiling windows overlooking small patio and an expansive and beautiful view of the East River.  Most definitely romantic :), but groups need not fear.  Restaurant is located behind the reception, and the restrooms before the reception desk.  3. Service: Unfailingly gracious, and appropriately attentive.  A server even volunteered to walk me in my tottering heels out the restaurant, through the corridor, and pointed me to the restroom near the reception.",1,0,0,Kitana Q.,"Manhattan, NY",0,189,0

1.0,8/12/2011,"I swear, I felt discriminated.  Yesterday was supposed to be a very good day because it was our one year anniversary. My girlfriend and I wanted to celebrate here because we heard many good reviews about this particular restaurant and we've been craving to come here for two weeks. We arrived at 7:15, a perfect time to eat dinner. Bread Service: It was alright. Nothing special other than just one piece of bread, just one. It was extremely difficult to chew because it was so stiff. Appetizers:Like I said before, we arrived at 7:15, and probably placed our orders at around 7:30. We waited and waited hungrily. And we finally got our food on the table after an hour at 8:30. The manager came to apologize to us and told us that the appetizers are on the house. But I wonder why it took them this long? I looked around at the other customers eating around us and most of them who came at the same time as us or even AFTER us are already starting on their entrees. The squid pasta was terribly... salty. Yuck.Entrees:Of course, it WOULD take them another whole hour to cook the entrees. We sat by the windows and by now, we see most of the people on the patio are gone and a lot of people next to us are already finishing up their dessert. I have no idea why they would take this long. I even wrote to them on Opentable reservation that we'd be coming on our anniversary. So why the hell are they fucking up my dinner? Yes, the manager came to talk to us and apologized. But do you really think that your petty ""40 bucks on the house"" is worth my wait and time?My lamb leg was so bitter and tasteless. My eggplant was bitter and soggy. God, it can't get any worse. At least my girlfriend enjoyed her duck... (but she started getting a stomach ache later)The only thing that i enjoyed was the avacado and hamachi salad. -- The food was horrible. The service was grotesque. I'm never coming here again. I should have chose a michelin restaurant like always. Dammit. Oh btw, I ordered a diet coke and it was FOUR DOLLARS. What the shit?

Keep in mind the place is a little out of the way, but worth the trip.  For pasta we tried the squid ink chitarra and mascarpone ravioli, if these do not give you a foodie head-rush from the flavor explosions, I don't know what will.  Simply two of the best pasta dishes I have had.  We also tried the flatiron steak, which was really good, it is steak so you either cook it right or you do not, and for this cut is was great.  However it was the brisket cake that they served with this, that was the highlight, again flavor explosion head-rush.  For dessert we had the beignets, these were good, but should have additional dipping sauces.  We also had the black forest sundae which was very good.  Will definitely be back.",0,0,0,J D.,"New York, NY",1,25,0
5.0,7/24/2011,"Here's my experience of Restaurant Week dinner at Riverpark. Might be too late for this year if Riverpark doesn't do the extension, but should be helpful for future RW's. Check out my photos that accompany this review.Riverpark is seriously out of the way. It's about a 10-15 minute walk from the nearest subway stop (6 train), but this turned out to be a good thing later since I got super massively stuffed from all the food. I needed the exercise to help me digest.I think the restaurant might have made most, if not all of their items from their regular dinner menu available. There were so many choices for each course! And, they did away with the regular dinner menu altogether during Restaurant week. So, there were no two menus that you had to choose between, and thus, you avoid the awkwardness of asking to dine off the cheap option.1. Bread service - mini baguetteThe bread was piping hot it actually burned my fingers! Fresh bread = good, enough said.2. Cavatelli - braised lamb, sweet peas, mint, horseradishDelicious! The braised lamb came in shred form and was tender and lamb-y. It tasted delightfully gamey, without being musky. The dish was earthy and hearty, and the portion felt quite large for an appetizer. Though, I couldn't taste much of the mint or horseradish.3. Berkshire Pork Chop - collard greens, peaches, cippolini onionsWhen this entree was brought in front of me, my eyes widened in shock at the sight of the gigantic hunk of pork chop. This was HUUUGE. This glistening, beautifully seared monster was literally twice the size of my fist. It made heads turn for sure. The diners at the table next to me all stared in awe. The pork chop came on the bone and was absolutely scrumptious. This had to be the best pork chop I've ever had in my life. The meat was supremely succulent and flavorful. There was also a nice amount of fat interspersed throughout. I felt like a caveman chowing down and annihilating the humongous slab of meat from my plate. One word describes this dish well: epic. This pork chop was EPIC.4. Black Forest Sundae - devil's food cake, vanilla ice cream, brandied cherries, pistachiosI think I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to dessert. While there's nothing especially unique about the Black Forest Sundae, I enjoyed it. The portion, once again, was large. Ice cream and cake, you just can't go wrong.Service was professional and efficient. In the context of Restaurant Week, I have to rank Riverpark as number one out of all of the ones I've been to. Great ambiance, great service, great food, and great portion size. Seriously, Riverpark is the best deal of them all.",3,2,1,Lucy Y.,"Manhattan, NY",11,29,123
4.0,7/22/2011,"Great meal. We ended up there on a whim this week and were quite impressed with the menu. We were further impressed when we realized it was restaurant week and there was a 3-course menu for $35. You would never had known it was restaurant week, there were 8-10 choices in each catagory (appetizer, entree, dessert). Food was excellent, portion sizes a bit hit or miss. My boyfrinds salmon tartare was literally laughably small, about a shotglass full. My mushroom consomme was giant. I would give them 5 stars but they gave us a table in the bar area instead of the dining room as we requested and we were told they were 'fully committed.' Normally I wouldnt care but we were the last table that came in the whole place, it was Monday night.

4.0,7/15/2011,"Came here for restaurant week with friends and had a wonderful time.  The decor was nice with the tons of little lights that glow like little stars along the ceiling and walls.  They have terrace and patio seating so that you can enjoy your meal outside on a gorgeous day.  We ordered the oysters, cavatelli, sweetbreads and salmon tartare as appetizers and found them all to be delicious.  The Cavatelli is a pasta dish that actually was quite a significant portion and delicious.  I normally don't like the taste of sweetbreads but this one came in such delicious sauces and was crispy on the outside so I actually found myself enjoying it.  The tartare was delicious, I only wish it came in a slightly larger portion.  The 4 oysters were very fresh.  For the main course we ordered the arctic char, berkshire pork chop, Roasted leg of lamb and squid ink chitarra.  The arctic char was perfectly cooked and my favorite of the bunch.  The roasted leg of lamb was super tender and flavorful and my second favorite.  The berkshire pork chop was also very flavorful and good.  The squid ink chitarra was good also however I've had better.For dessert we had the black forest sundae, chocolate pot de creme, beignets, and creme friache panna cotta.  The chocolate pot de creme was perfectly smooth and chocolaty and my favorite of the bunch.  The black forest sundae was my second favorite but I wasn't too big of a fan of the brandied cherries (my friend who picked them all out and ate them for me seemed to enjoy them though).  The panna cotta was good too but not as sweet as my sweet tooth would have preferred (however this seemed to be a favorite for those with less of a sweet tooth).  Beignets in case anyone didn't know resemble zeppoles but less deeply fried.  They are described as donuts on the menu and was the least favorite for everyone at the table.  If you're craving a good donut go to Donut Plant instead...i know it's different but it's still better.  Overall I'd definitely go back again.  Solid place and great for nice summer dates.",1,0,1,Kate K.,"Queens, NY",27,131,15
4.0,7/14/2011,"Went for restaurant week last night, and got the coveted corner seat out on the patio. It was coveted until the random thunderstorm rushed in and we all started to get wet. The hostess was so apologetic (because you know, she can control the weather), and was able to move those who were getting rained on to tables inside within minutes. Thank god, because that was a downpour. The other sad part about having to go inside was that we no longer had our server Francisco, though our inside guy (Jacob?) was very nice too.The Charlie Temple was more like a twist on sparkling lemonade than anything, and was refreshing though my friend thought it was a little too sour. They used a real cherry for garnish instead of a cheesy Maraschino one. Tasty!Apps: This was my first ceviche experience and it was a-mazing. The watermelon and cucumber were excellent accompaniments to the citrusy-sour fish, and was a decent size. In fact, the portions on everything were just right. Friend's cavatelli with lamb and mint were fresh, chewy, and delicious albeit a little on the heavy side for an appetizer. Main: Chitarra was smooth and delicious though a bit on the heavy side, and the proportion of seafood (shrimp, calamari & octopus) to pasta I felt was just right. If there was any more I think the fishy flavor might've overwhelmed the dish. The lemon zest throughout the pasta was also a really nice, fragrant addition and the thinly sliced chilies added a good heat to it. Friend's lamb shoulder was also delicious... that's all I can really say about hers. Dessert: Holy beignets, are you good. Just... get them. Like little French doughnuts from heaven. My black forest sundae was... fine. The presentation is better than the taste. It had those cherries in it though like the one that was in my drink, yay. And how can you go wrong with that view??

As the sunset, they started to twinkle like stars.   We had the best server, Jamal. He was so friendly and accommodating. We had oyster in a half shell and cavatelli to start (i loved the touch of mint). Next was the squid ink chitarra and berkshire pork chop (recommended by jamal).

5.0,7/11/2011,"Came here on a Sunday evening this summer, and it was a wonderful dining experience. We sat outside on the terrace, which was perfect for a warm, breezy summer evening. I would take off half a star from my 5 star review for two reasons: while it was lovely sitting outside, the view of the East River is not spectacular and the proximity of the highway is not ideal. However, I didn't really mind the unusual location as some other reviewers did. In fact, it was quite nice dining in a rarely visited neighborhood in Manhattan--it was a nice change from the usual downtown. The other reason for my 4.5 star review is that the Ceviche appetizer (cod, watermelon, cilantro) was a bit too salty. The flavors were nice but overpowered by the salty vinaigrette. The pros: our entrees were delicious. We had the Grilled Cobia and the Steak. I was hesitant to try a fish that I had never heard of, but it was an explosion of well-balanced flavors. Every bite offered a new taste sensation; the pine nuts and caramelized onions really took this dish to another level. The steak, although not plated as beautifully as the cobia, was great and the small piece of brisket on the side was even better. We also ordered a side of the market greens (kale), which were surprisingly flavorful. The service was friendly and attentive, the weather was gorgeous, and the restaurant is beautiful.

3.0,6/8/2011,"Total random location.   1st Ave in Kips Bay is full over NYU hospitals and everything is very boring and bland.  So kudos to Tom Colicchio for opening a restaurant in this barren area.But seriously, what a random location.  When you hit 29th & 1st you have to keep walking through some building Alexandria Sciene Center right on the East River.  So Riverpark kinda seems like a fancy restaurant on the fringes of a fancy hospital.My friend & I wanted to check out the recently opened Terrace.  Truth be told, I was minorly disappointed.  The ""Terrace"" consisted of about 5 long fancy picnic tables on a concrete terrace overlooking FDR, the East River and the unattrative Queens/Brooklyn skyline.  As far as beer gardens in the city go - I have been to better.BUT - it was breezy out there and the terrace menu is very reasonably priced with a wide selection of beers.  Most ""snacks"" were seafoody and I really wanted to try the ""mango coconut popsicle.""All in all I would go back, but only because I live in the neighborhood, otherwise the place is a serious hike on Manhattan's east side!",0,0,0,Megan D.,"New York, NY",10,19,0
2.0,5/30/2011,"Riverpark is a beautiful restaurant with a well-thought out menu and well-meaning staffers.  Unfortunately it falls short on several counts and, imho, fails to deliver value for $$$.  Despite its name it is not on the river, but on the FDR Drive, with the attendant din of rushing traffic that one cannot escape if dining on the otherwise comfortable deck.  (The lovely inside is quiet)The dinner menu delivers unevenly.  Some dishes were near-perfect (e.g. the baby octopus appetizer and the mushroom consomme, the grilled flatiron steak), others ho-hum and not worth their price (the breast of duck, the leg of lamb).  The staff --a small army of waiters, servers, busboys, greeters-- seems muddled and often confused.  Does one have to wait an eternity, even after ordering cocktails, to get the excellent mini-baguette? Does one have to beg for more bread?  How can a waiter return to the table and tell a guest that the spirit he ordered is not carried when said hooch appears on the spirits list?  Is it that difficult ro remember that a guest ordered a martini with olives, not a twist?  How much time does one have to let pass between ordering drinks and getting them, at a place with a 30 foot long bar and full-time bartender?  Is it fair to expect at a Tom Colicchio restaurant to get cocktails as ordered (nothing fancy here, martinis and old fashioneds)?   Is it realistic to expect at a Tom Colicchio establishment getting all after-dinner coffees simultaneously at a table for four?  How hard can it be to deliver crisp, evenly done french fries (suggestion to the kitchen: check out the fries at nearby Les Halles on Park Ave. South)?And so on, and so on.I sincerely hope Riverpark can get its act in order.  It's not easy to get to, and as long as it headlines the owner's famous name and charges hefty dinner prices, it needs to hone its many potential virtues.",2,0,0,T.

I myself am very laid back when it comes to dining out, but from experiences I've had in the past, I knew we were doomed from the beginning when there was a bit of a wait to place our drink order. As usual, my family and I split a giant tray of delicious oysters...east and west coast. For my appetizer I had the baby octopus which was much more flavorful than I had expected..I loved it! We should have stopped there...again there was a bit of a lag in between beverage service. The vibe of the wait staff was very rushed, stressed, and urgent which made the entire experience feel a bit uneasy. The sides we ordered didn't come out until we were almost done with our entrees.

4.0,5/29/2011,"Imagine my sadness when, only a few weeks after I moved from my apartment on 29th and Lexington to Los Angeles, I learned that Tom Colicchio was opening a restaurant at 29th and First. My unpopular neighborhood was getting a nod from my favorite chef. I had to wait months to eat at Riverpark on a visit, and when I finally did, the experience was a little bittersweet. It didn't quite feel like a Tom Colicchio restaurant to me.In many ways, though, it did. I've found bar staffs to be wonderfully generous at Craft, eager to offer a glass of bubbly for the inconvenience of a wait to be sat, for example, and my bartender welcomed me back to New York with a wonderful glass of North Fork Chardonnay on the house. The decor is similar, too--modern, muted, minimalist. Like Colicchio and Sons on the Hudson River, Riverpark is situated on the East River, though it uniquely offers diners gorgeous views from inside the restaurant and an outdoor terrace.And Riverpark's menu is the kind of food I love most--innovative new American cuisine with Mediterranean influences and nontraditional ingredients. This is food I generally love, even at risk of it feeling corporate. And yet. I took a bit of time to eat my breadstick, and it quickly became very hard. The mushroom consomme appetizer was excellent, and fans of Craft's butter braised mushrooms would enjoy them in this dish, but my appetizer sweetbreads were small and uninteresting and overcooked compared to, again, Colicchio and Sons'. I loved the entree size squid ink chitarra, and the repeat ingredients of lemon and Fresno chile were much more prominent here. The taste and texture of the spaghetti was incredible and transported me to the Adriatic sea, but I would have loved more, or larger, shrimp and calamari. The duck and scallops were cooked very well--just a bit predictable. We loved our wines, and an accidental pouring of one's into another's glass was amended quickly with fresh glasses for both. This restaurant is still finding its footing. And I know it will.I would absolutely go back, especially to try the wonderful sounding lunch menu, and it makes me sad that I won't have the opportunity to do this for a long time to come. And as it happens, there's a reason why it felt different from Tom's other restaurants--we learned it's more of a joint-venture with Chef Sisha Ortuzar, who has been with Tom dating back to Gramercy Tavern. No wonder it feels different. It should.Best of luck in getting established, and thank you for coming to Kip's Bay!",0,0,0,Kate M.,"Los Angeles, CA",290,436,0

3.0,5/2/2011,"I came to Riverpark this past week for lunch. Rather, I should specify that I took a cab to Riverpark, because unless I lived in the immediate neighborhood, how else would I get to 29th St. and 1st Ave? The location is not necessarily a bad thing - I can see its proximity to the Midtown tunnel making it a convenient draw for Long Island residents looking for a nice meal in the city without driving through midtown traffic - as some patrons would certainly appreciate the relative isolation it offers, away from the constant rattle and hum of New York. Contrary to the Yelp map, the restaurant is not located at the corner of 29th and 1st, but is secluded in the Alexandria building, which is right next to the FDR. In order to enter Riverpark you need to cross the long lobby of the building, which further adds to the remoteness. Regardless of how one may feel about this, the real draw of Riverpark's location is the panoramic vista of the East River, Queens and Brooklyn that it offers.The restaurant's decor is mainly modern minimalist, which is a good fit for the floor-to-ceiling windows that focus your attention on the main attraction. Riverpark also has a small outdoor patio that is elevated so as to hide much of the FDR from sight. If you are fortunate enough to visit on a nice day, as I was, you can eschew the interior entirely and enjoy the view unobstructed.We all opted for the $28 prix fixe menu, which is a great value. I started with the lamb empanadas, which, according to the menu, contained pine nuts, raisins and olives, came garnished with thinly-sliced red bell peppers and flash-fried parsley, and accompanied by a light yogurt sauce. It looked really good on the menu - I love both lamb and empanadas; a slight fusion play on Middle-Eastern and Latin American cuisines - but the execution was only so-so. Although the empanadas were given a generous sprinkling of sea salt, the filling inside tasted absent of any flavors aside from the lamb, which rendered the dish more insipid than I had expected. I think strengthening the supporting flavors of this dish - maybe adding a little cinnamon? - would go a long way toward improving it. That or serving either kibbeh or a regular, latin-flavored empanada, but you could get always those for dirt-cheap somewhere else. I also tried the goat cheese and eggplant bruschetta with honey, which was fine, if somewhat low-key. The only other appetizer that was ordered was the charcuterie plate, which was eaten without comment.For the second course I ordered the pork belly and pretzel sandwich, which came with ramps, and on the side, greens and potato chips. I like pork belly quite a bit and am not averse to fat on my meat, but this was really overdone. There must have been a quarter-inch strip of fat running down the side of the pork belly, which saddled me with a very fatty piece of meat. As a result, when I picked up the sandwich to bite into it, grease oozed out all over my hands and onto the plate, leaving both a mess. This was the second instance of a vision sounding great on the menu - an upscale take on a ballpark standard - but lacking satisfactory execution. Although the sandwich tasted good - the ramps and mustard glaze imparted a nice flavor - when you consider the ambiance or that you may be there on a business meal like myself, you might want to avoid this overly messy dish unless you are casually dining at Riverpark. The mixed greens that came with the sandwich were okay save for the fact that it was liberally sprinkled with sea salt (I found it curious that there was a lot of salt on the greens, but not on the pretzel, where you would normally expect it). The potato chips were rubbed with a spicy chili powder and were a nice addition to the plate. Everyone else at my table ordered the branzino, which they strongly approved.I had the coconut panna cotta with roasted pineapple, macadamia brittle and lime granita for dessert and it was great. The silky, understated panna cotta matched well with the sweet pineapple, sour granita and crunchy brittle, which all came together in an awesome flavor and texture explosion in my mouth (we need more explosions like this). The only criticism I have is with regard to the brittle, which was too long to pop in your mouth, but too thick to easily break apart with a fork or spoon, which made it awkward to eat. I also tried the beignets, which were served with orange marmalade and creme anglaise for dipping. The doughnuts were something of a letdown; they were not as light or airy as you would expect of a beignet and tasted more like fried sweet dough.

3.0,5/2/2011,"*Another RW Review*I got lost trying to find this restaurant, going up and down 1st Ave several times.  So here are some detailed instructions - Don't use your iPhone map, it will lead you the wrong way on 29th St.  It's near Bellvue, if you've past any hospital on the East side, then you've gone too far.  Walk down the small road that goes towards the river.  If you see a Security guard in a booth, then you're heading in the right direction.  Keep walking the long road until you see a building on the right.  Walk through the lobby of the building.  You will see a round Security desk in the lobby with turnstiles.  You're in the correct building, it's also an office building.  Admire the lobby and the reflective projected fluid images on the wall, keep walking and there you have it.  The restaurant is in the building, along the river.Here's what we tried from their RW menu.  Their entire menu was RW for the 3 weeks.  They didn't offer anything else unless you wanted to order off the bar menu.  There were many options to chose from.The Glazed Pork Belly with pickled vegetables, jalepeno.  It was tangy with a bit of a kick, and so thickly cut.  Yum!Skirt steak frites with watercress, horseradish.  A generous portion perfectly cooked as we desired.Branzino & Roast Chicken - Both crispy on the outside but moist and tender on the inside. For dessert:Chocolate molten cake & Cinnamon panna cottaAfter dinner we sat in the comfy Austin Power looking chairs.  They were gold and contemporary.  Then we walked outside where there was outdoor seating, and admired the view.  The food wasn't mind blowing but the flavors were good and everything cooked with a precise execution.  We wanted to try their Fried chicken but it wasn't being offered.  So we'll probably go back during nice weather for outdoor seating.  I can see this place being a cool place to go after work for a great view, drinks*, and a nice dinner.  PS - The restrooms are not in the restaurant, they're back in the lobby.  So you have to walk out of the restaurant and back into the lobby, near the Security desk.*Temperance coolers - Are non alcoholic drink that are offered.  I'm told they were pretty good for $5",5,0,4,Sandy C.,"Queens, NY",249,578,465
4.0,5/1/2011,"Definitely a fan of this place. It gets a minus one star for the location- so far out east! but other than that, it's worth the trip out- the view from the restaurant is amazing.. anyway, was greeted by the hostess and seated right next to the window and the view- again amazing. We started off with a waiter taking our order, but a nice waitress took over. My friend and i order a bottle of wine, ravioli, and i forgot what he ordered- some kind of meat..point being, i ate everything I ordered and so did he..then we ended with beignets and apple crisp- yum yum yum!!! overall, great view, great atmosphere, and amazing food.

5.0,4/26/2011,"Really special place. Free validated parking. On the East River at the FDR drive. Great Views, outdoor seating, beautiful dining room. Not crazy expensive, but a high end menu. Easily a top 20 pick for a romantic dinner setting.Service was excellent. Dinner rolls came out first, tiny salted loaves.Lengthy wine list but minimal dinner choices, no specials, just the menu.Not a problem at all. Some oysters for the other men, gnocchiette - mini gnocchi, ramps & ricotta ravioli, a salad, all winners for appetizers. The pork chop, a signature dish, was incredibly tender, & I devoured all of it.Suffice to say, diver scallops, which my wife had, were also wonderful.A lot of oohing and aahhing was heard from the others and all the plates were scraped clean. Dessert of beignets, with a custard side and an orange preserve  dipping sauce were also downed quickly. Scrumptious. A table portion of sorbets, which could have been the one dessert we needed, was also fantastic, blood orange,banana,and coffee flavors. Tiny wafer cookies used to get the last drops out. The plate left the table scrubbed.  One of the guests brought wine, and a cork-age fee was charged as an FYI.I give this (as a well kept secret) a full 10 of 10.

4.0,4/26/2011,"Riverpark hits all the right notes: lovely view, beautiful restaurant, great service and delicious, simple food. The hubby and I did the Restaurant Week menu during our last NYC visit and were SO happy to have picked Riverpark as one of our weekend restaurants. Our menu choices: First CourseDuck Liver Pate with Cherry Preserve - DELICIOUS. The combination of pate with the sweet and tart cherries was a great pairingIberico Pata Negra - Duck prosciutto that my hubby savored silently (and offered me a taste towards the end)Second CourseHousemade Fettucini with Pork Ragu - so light, yet so filling. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and the salty pork ragu was comforting and deliciousPork tenderloin with sauteed spinach and garlic - While my fettucini with ragu was delicious, this may have been the single most delicious bite of food all day. The pork tenderloin was nothing I could imagine beforehand. Riverpark's version is so tender, crispy on the outside, deliciously salty. A bite of it, along with the garlicy sauteed spinach was just perfect. DessertChocolate Souffle Cake - Good, not great. Rice pudding with Pineapple sorbet - Huge FAIL. The rice wasn't cooked fully (read: RAW). It was like raw rice grains with milk. I make a mean rice pudding, so this was a huge letdown. Service was on point, timely, and friendly.

The service was competent..not too personable, and it seemed that the restaurant was mostly empty, but the food was really good..lamb empenadas, PORK BELLY SANDWICH ON PRETZEL BREAD..yes I put that in capital letters...and beignets (not as good as Cafe du Monde but it was nice to get my beignet fix).",1,0,1,Rich J.,"Yonkers, NY",85,537,159
4.0,4/15/2011,"4.5 Stars.This is a long overdue RW review, but fear not restaurant week haters, their menu was extensive, with 10-12 options per course from the regular menus, including a dessert selection that even included a cheese plate.When I finally found the place (just keep walking down the main lobby, you'll get there), I was met with a pleasantly modern and casually elegant space, that I imagine would have had a sense of calm about it, were it not for the loud visitors of a corporate event in two of the back rooms. After my friends arrived, we were led to our table within a few minutes, and then set about perusing the unexpectedly long menus we had been handed (if you get a booth, beware that the bench seats are very low at the table). Things were off to a good start with a refreshing and delicious corpse reviver, and the warm chewy mini baguettes, which I could eat everyday. As we got ready for our starters, my friend's glazed pork belly was brought out just a little earlier than the other apps. It looked fantastic with the pickled vegetables and jalapeños on top, and as I glared enviously he wasted no time in letting us know his satisfaction with the dish, blubbering a mouthful about something along the lines of crispy tender fatty goodness combining well with the sweet glaze. But I was appeased when my mackerel escabeche came out shortly afterwards, a nice presentation with the contrast of colours from the iberico pata negra, and dash of paprika against the fried fish and crispy paella. It was a good light start, but the crispy paella was a bit on the salty side, and on the whole the dish could have perhaps been more focused. My other friend's spaghetti with lobster, raisins and capers seemed to underwhelm, and supposedly lacked in any distinctive flavour.For my entree, I had the lamb that was sliced atop a bed of lentils, with mushrooms and turnips scattered around it. It had an earthy, hearty feel oddly combined with an almost elegant flare in what I can only describe as a neo-rustic look. The lamb was cooked perfectly, very tender, and juicy with great flavours flowing through every bite. Other choices at the table were the organic chicken (very well received), and the huge pork chop. As we wrapped up and got ready for dessert, our very cool waiter looked over our completely cleaned plates and exclaimed, ""Gentlemen! We have done some serious damage here tonight!""... It was a proud moment for the three of us (or maybe just for me).I finished with the excellent beignets, that were very hot and fluffy, with a nice flaky crispy touch as well (I favoured the more potent and bold taste of the marmalade dip over the vanilla custard). I must say, the hazelnut financier looked fantastic as well, especially with the pomegranate consomme poured around it.Overall, a very successful night of gluttony, with food that would at times dominate our future discussions. I look forward to going back soon, as I imagine it being a more pleasant experience in warm weather. To sum up, I go back to what my friend said on our short cab ride to the 6 train, ""You know a restaurant is really good, when everyone walks away thinking they had the best dish"".",9,0,3,Zayed K.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",56,76,245

5.0,3/19/2011,"I try to only write reviews for places I've been going for years, with menus off which I have tried a variety of items.  However, my dining experience at Riverpark for an early birthday meal with my dad and fiance was so special that it warranted a review here.I give 5 stars only because Yelp doesn't allow the half star- I think I would actually give it a 4.5.  For the most part, service was very friendly, though every time a drink or food was brought out they always seemed to mix up who ordered what- which isn't really that important but seemed surprising how together everything else was.It was a warm spring night, and we were given the option of sitting outside.  The terrace area has heat lamps, and the atmosphere is amazing.  I was hesitant when I saw that the FDR was right there, but honestly it wasn't very loud, didn't smell like fuel... there was just a nice soft roar of the city in the background.  The views of the East River, Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens were really cool.  There was a classy, intimate vibe, definitely an upscale restaurant ideal for special occasions.Everything on the menu sounded amazing- I got the squid ink chitarra to start, which was one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten; my dad and fiance both got the pork ravioli, which looked delicious and apparently was.  Fiance and I both got the diver scallops- with kale chutney, butternut squash, and hen of the woods; and my dad got duck breast, with pomegranate and a few other delicious items.  All of the food was very fresh, well prepared, and the flavor combinations were to die for.  Dessert might have been the highlight of this very good meal.  I got the beignets, which came with a vanilla creme and a marmalade dipping sauce; my dad got the apple crumble; and fiance got the chocolate souffle cake.  We left absolutely stuffed, and absolutely impressed.",3,0,2,Andie T.,"Washington, DC",54,14,0

5.0,3/7/2011,"After much deliberation, I have to give credit where credit's due. Riverpark is amazing!! Out of the basic categories: Food, Atmosphere, Service. Riverpark is VERY close to perfection. We ordered the Sweet Potato Ravioli and Lobster Salad to start. The lobster was some of the freshest I ever had, but since the centerpiece for the salad is the lobster there is not much else going on on the plate and it sort of ends up being a flat one note. The sweet potato ravioli is DIVINE. All kinds of good flavors jump out at you as you chew. We had the Veal Chop and Chatham Cod. My bf loved the veal, although I think it was his first time having veal in his life. My Cod was simply alright. I think the chef tries to bring out the subtle and fresh flavors of the fish, but again, it was a bit flat for me. The potatoes were a bit to creamy and liquidy. I like to be reminded that I'm eating real potatoes, in whatever form they're in. The clams were nice and tender and a good accompaniment. For dessert, we tried the Apple Crisps and the Rice Pudding. Please DO NOT get the rice pudding. They put some sort of seed in it to give it a south Asian (Indian) flavor and it does not go over well. The seed sort of crumbles and sours the dish. The creamy pudding is too liquidy and the rice seems a bit undercooked and they did not pick a starchy enough rice. The fruit in the small cup is just an add on, which doesn't help the disappointment. I almost knocked off one star because of this dish :-( The Apple Crisp is a solid dessert though. Not fancy and exactly how it should be. (Almost) every dish was impeccable, but the ravioli and veal were true standouts. The atmosphere is very much upscale with beautiful lighting and modern decor. Although you might need to be a bit strategic in where you sit since you cannot see the beautiful view from all tables. Luckily the centerback of the restaurant rests atop a platform, giving you a bit of a vantage point. However, they undermine that a bit by putting the bar in the middle of the restaurant. Oh well. Service is very attentive and friendly. When I grabbed the bottle of wine to top up our glasses, a waiter (not ours) came out of nowhere and politely took it out of my hand and began to pour. They really do have a lot of people milling around ready to please, so take advantage! Anyways, I can't wait to try it out again in the summer when there are more sunny hours and the sunset is later.

2.0,3/2/2011,"My fiance and I stopped in to check out the restaurant for a 12 person reservation (they take up to 14 off regular menu, which is great!). We only had apps and sat in a really cozy couch on the side. The good: the place is really pretty inside. The ppl working there were super nice. The not so good - there really is no view. Sure you see water but it's the FDR and then water. Not into looking at traffic while I eat. The food: we had salt cod croquettes, a toro dish, smoked olives and almonds. Cod was totally bland. The sauce was okay and helped but I wish the chef had thrown in a handful of salt. Toro was AMAZING but it's literally 2 pieces for $15-16. Okay, fine, i get it's expensive but given that it was the only thing we ordered that was great, we'd have loved more. The almonds - how can you mess those up? the OLIVES - JUST WRONG. We ate maybe 3 of them and left the rest. I told the waitress they were terrible when she came back and she didn't really say anything.

My date had the goose tortellini which wasn't my fav. but still good. For entrees we did the porkchop and the arctic char.

4.0,2/7/2011,"New, friendly, chic--those are my three words for the restaurant. Being the last day of Restaurant Week, I was eager to try something new or established, so I chose both, a new restaurant by an established chef/restauranter, Colicchio-- and boy did the restaurant/building feel new! As soon as we stepped into the pristine building, we were greeted with warm welcomes from all staff that night-- the security guard, front desk lobby, hostess, coat check personnel, server, etc. Maybe it was the whole newness of the place, but the W-hotelish decor, strategic view of the East River/LIC and elegant lighting features enhanced the restaurant's chicness. And from all my Restaurant Week experiences, by far, this place had the most generous offerings in each of the prix fixe categories. Unfortunately, the complimentary bread represented the kind of food that was to come-- salty. Both the appetizers, pork belly and prawn salad were salty. The prawn salad also could have had more greens. The pork ravioli entree tasted like an excess of hoisin sauce. The dish would be much better with a more mild, simple sauce-- like olive oil or some butter mix. Luckily, not everything was off. My cod fish was very comforting and delicious, loved the potato puree and the slightly toasted exterior texture of the fish. My panna cotta dessert was absolutely perfect--in fact, it was the best I one I ever had so far!!! I enjoyed every single bite of the cream pudding atop of pumpkin flavored crust and its remarkable sidekick, vanilla spice flavored ice cream. Their take on the chocolate souffle was different, it came with raspberry sorbet-- the souffle was made well and the sorbet was refreshing. Plus, they remembered it was my bf's birthday and put a candle on top of the cake with the Happy Birthday writing on the plate. What's more, right after we took a bite or two of our desserts, we were pleasantly surprised with three complimentary ice cream flavors- rum raisin, coffee and pecan praline. I was so full by then but made sure to take couple of bites of each delicious flavor. Although some of the food was a miss, we still had a terrific time. If anything, I'd come here for drinks and dessert to take advantage of the excellent service and great view. Incredible service, sophisticated, trendy, W-hotelish setting, with overall decent food, this place is a strong 4.

The restaurant was hard to get to and we were 15 minutes late, (it's located in an office complex and far away from most subways) but they held our ""special"" table, as the hostess called it, right in the corner so we had a view of the river. My guy had the squab mole and the mackerel starter, and we both had steak frites for dinner. We enjoyed our appetizers but felt the steak and the fries were oversalted. We were impressed by the generous portions (since this is only a restaurant week menu) and the number of choices we were given.

4.0,2/3/2011,"I dined at Riverpark during NYC Restaurant Week 2011.Situated on a garden plaza overlooking the East River, the aptly named Riverpark, is literally tucked away in the corner of an office complex on a quiet street in Kips Bay.In fact, the building - which houses a mix of biotech and pharmaceutical companies - is so brand new, paint fumes still waft through the building.I eventually make my way through the lobby, pass a series of entrance control gates and finally see the beautiful dining room.Plush leather booths, gun metal gray dining chairs, an avant-garde lighting installation and wooden accents pervade in this pretty, modern interior.Floor-to-ceiling glass windows provide sweeping river views and while the sight isn't particularly stellar on this dreary winter's night, you can just tell it'll be buzzing come summer.The dishes:I start my evening off with the mackerel escabeche with crispy paella and Iberico ham. The plate, accented with a fine dusting of fiery red paprika, is beautifully composed and my mouth begins to salivate.Unfortunately, the dish leaves a lot to be desired. I really want to like it but there is simply too much going on.The mackerel ceviche, paella soccarat and Iberico ham is served with pickled onions, paprika, creamy garlic chili aioli and sprigs of dill.Theoretically, the acidity and citrus notes of these ingredients should combine perfectly with the crispy richness of the rice, but the flavors are out of kilter.While the acidity of the mackerel compliments the finely sliced fatty ribbons of pork, the crispy paella is extremely under-seasoned and to be honest is downright bland.Meanwhile, the pickled onions, with their hint of sweetness, adds texture but clashes with the pungent, garlic-heavy aioli and robust flavors of the dill.The restaurant's signature lamb cavatelli - a dish which has scored rave reviews from food critics and diners alike - is missing from tonight's menu so I end up ordering the pork chop.While waiting for my second course to arrive, I ask my server about when the cavatelli will resurface on the menu and she heads into the kitchen to ask the chef.She returns a couple of minutes later, explains that the chef couldn't source enough mint in the morning but tells me that he has offered to prepare a tasting of it, especially for me! Talk about great service =)Needless to say, my heart melts as soon as the dish is placed before me and the server utters the four sweet words, ""Compliments of the chef.""The cavatelli is served in a thick ragout of smoked lamb neck and finished off with flash-fried mint, horseradish and a generous sprinkling of grated cheese.The dish is a wonderful symphony of flavors and is the epitome of why the classic combination of lamb and mint never fails to impress.The cavatelli is cooked to al dente perfection and compliments the lamb beautifully. The subtle crunch and freshness of the mint help cuts through the richness of the ragout, while the stringiness of the grated cheese helps elevate the dish to another level.Admittedly, the ragout is far too salty but thankfully I am able to use the pasta to mop up the excess broth and neutralize the saltiness.My actual entree arrives shortly afterwards and is the restaurant's other signature dish - pork chop with caramelized Brussels sprouts, apples and parsnip puree.After battling to cut through the thick piece of pork, I am dismayed to discover that it is dry and completely void of the usual succulent, moist juices.The pork, supposed to be cooked to a medium perfection, appears to have been over-rested. It is a real shame as the meat has a subtle anise flavor, imparted by a sprinkling of caraway seeds, and would have tasted spectacular.However, the accompanying jus, with its caramelized onion flavor, combines brilliantly with the velvety parsnip puree, seared Brussels sprouts and tangy, yet sweet, apple hash.For dessert, I go with my server's recommendation and opt for the hazelnut financier with vanilla semifreddo and pomegranate consomme.The dish is light and refreshing and although it features bold flavors, manages to show restraint.The financier component is mildly nutty and quite bland, but when combined with the light and airy semifreddo, the dessert exhibits the right amount of sweetness.The deep red pomegranate consomme, which is elegantly poured table-side, strikes a perfect balance between tart and sweet, as does the blend of toasted hazelnuts and pomegranate seeds.Read more and view photos at gloriousgluttony.com/new…",2,0,1,Miawling L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0
2.0,2/2/2011,"I had a rather disappointing experience at Riverpark recently. I read great reviews of the restaurant here and thought no better time to check out Riverpark during Restaurant Week. The online menu did look pretty fab afterall - except the supposed duck liver pate on their online menu was nowhere to be found in the actual menu. Actually, it should have been a warning bell to me when one of my dining companions cancelled on me after hearing not so good things about Riverpark. Regardless I trekked on... and trekked on I did to Riverpark, a location that is extremely out of my way and on a cold/ rainy/ snowy day.If there's anything positive I took away from my experience, it had to be the warmth and connection I had with the host. I was delighted to have scored a fab large window table, with the view of the East River. However, the experience slowly went downhill from there.1) I had a 12PM reservation - first seating of the day. Upon the waitstaff's removal of an extra placemat from the table, I was appalled to see crumbs or crumb-like objects staring me in the face. I'm not sure if I was more startled by the thought that perhaps this restaurant does not clean the tables from the day before or found it unbelievable that the waitstaff would be so oblivious the obvious objects that did not belong to the table, almost like it was acceptable. A quick look to the long carpet that ran across the dining room revealed more crumbs from the day before littered in various spots. And did I mention the choice of supposed wrinkle-free shirts for the waitstaff ... they were wrinkled to the point of embarrassment. Gosh, if such levels of cleanliness were observed in the front of the restaurant, I shudder to think how the state of cleanliness in the kitchen would be.2) I mentioned to the staff that I had a time limit for my lunch. He was co-operative and did his best to ensure speedy service. So speedy that he proceeded to serve me my appetizer, entirely forgetting to serve me any bread. And he was nowhere to be found thereafter for me to follow up with my request. Upon noticing that the staff rotated to serve each table, I made my request for bread to another server, who promptly brought me bread, with no butter. Another round of request got me butter, then realized that I had no butter knife. And this is only getting interesting.... I get the manager stop by my table. He probably noticed my unrest and came by to assure me that they are aware of my time constraint. I had to explain that I was only hoping to get the attention of a waitstaff in order to get a butter knife. And it only gets more interesting here. One of the waitstaff later brought me an entree knife and when I requested for it to be replaced with a small butter knife (obviously for the purpose of spreading butter), I was informed that THIS WAS AN ENTREE BUTTER KNIFE. Seriously??? I made him replace it for it was simply too ridiculous at this point.3) Cuisine-wise, I liked the idea of the fried sage in my soup... however the idea soon became old when it was found once again in my entree which incidentally was a steak - requested medium rare. What was served to me looked more like a medium well steak. At that point, it was probably the last straw for me. I decided to send back my entree, which when eventually served to me again, was really just an unenjoyable and unimaginative dish and I did not think much of it. Eventually the beignets were probably the saving grace to the disappointing entree.All in all, I felt that it was a wasted afternoon trip and lunch at Riverpark. After this experience, I immediately proceeded to cancel an upcoming Colicchio & Sons reservation.",1,0,0,Laur T.,"New York, NY",26,780,0

5.0,1/30/2011,"My friend and I decided to come here for Restaurant Week as they received pretty good reviews and had around 10 main courses for Restaurant Week as compared to other places with only had three or four at best.When we called Saturday afternoon to schedule a reservation for 8:30, they told us that they were all booked until 10:30pm. That was pretty much our fault for waiting until so late to book a reservation. The people on the phone told us that we could sit and eat at the bar if we still wanted to go, though it would be first come first serve there.We decided to go at 8:30 anyway, and as luck would have it, a table for 2 opened up/was canceled and the super friendly hostesses seated us. When you receive the portions, they look super tiny. To be honest, I was planning on getting myself a burger after dinner. However, it was incredibly filling. On top of it all, I thought the food was DELICIOUS. I had the tartare, the duck, and the panna cotta. The tartare was perfect and melted in your mouth. The savory duck was cooked to perfection. The panna cotta was so freakin good. I could have had 12 of them. Everything is so flavorful, with all the right combinations of flavors. The atmosphere was so great too. This restaurant sits right on top of the water. The walls are made of glass; everything is so chic, and feels really high end, though you don't get the feeling that they're arrogant about it--all the staff there are really nice.I would highly advocate coming here for a date or for a classy night out with friends!",0,0,0,Lisa P.,"Forest Hills, NY",3,6,0

4.0,1/24/2011,"So Riverpark is Tom Collichio's new digs on the East River. I went here about two months ago for a sponsored dinner. To be honest, I had my reservations about going here. After all, it is situated between NY's largest homeless shelter and Bellevue hospital. I had seen the building go up over the last few years each day since I work next door (not at the homeless shelter). If you have ever been to the restaurant formerly known as Craftsteak, the interior decor is very similar. Tall ceilings. Dark ambiance and furniture. Since we were there for a sponsored dinner, it was a fixed menu. It was essentially standard American fare. The starter arugula salad was phenomenal. I chose, as and ode to craftsteak, to order the sirloin steak. It was fantastic, and I am pretty serious about my steak. The service was great as well. If it only wasn't stuck between Bellevue and the Homless shelter. I guess if you got so toasted you couldn't make it home you could either go up one block and grab a cot to sleep for the night, or one block south and sober up in the Bellevue ER!",0,0,1,Mike S.,"Manhattan, NY",300,10,1
4.0,1/24/2011,"Gotta love Restaurant Week, without it I may  not have tried Riverpark.  Not located in the most convenient area, the view is pretty.   I convinced hubby to drive in and it turns out  there is parking located in the building and the restaurant will validate your parking up to 3 hours and parking is free!  Great deal for Manhattan.The space is beautiful, modern and elegant without seeming pretentious.  The staff is super friendly, everyone from the hostess to the guy who poured us water.  Great service all around.Appetizers:  Lamb Skewers accompanied by some lovely yogurt sauce and a  bean, cucumber, olive salad. High quality lamb, super tender and tasty.  Cod Croquettes, served with a creamy lemon purée.  The croquettes were incredibly creamy and really good. The purée on its own seemed pretty sweet, almost dessert like, but when paired with the croquettes it added a wonderful freshness to the dish.Entrees: Steak Frites served with fries and a watercress salad.  The skirt steak was pretty perfect, wonderful flavor with the right amount of char. The watercress with horseradish was the perfect accompaniment.  The fries were a little too salty, but cooked well and the aioli dipping sauce was great.  The pork chop over brussels sprout-apple hash and parsnip purée was delicious.  I've never had a pork chop so tender and juicy and the hash went wonderfully with it.  The parsnip purée was very tasty, but I wish there was more of it.Dessert:  Apple Crisp with dried cherries and creme anglaise was heavenly, really some of the best I've ever had.  The molten chocolate cake with salted caramel and espresso ice cream was also very good.Service:  As mentioned above the staff was very friendly and they were just as accommodating.  The meal went at just the right pace, we were never left waiting for anything but at the same time we did not feel rushed.A solid meal + a beautiful space = a great evening.",1,0,0,Krista M.,"Kew Gardens, NY",353,719,289

As my main course I got the Diver Scallops which were fantastic. These scallops were fresh, perfectly cooked, and the pear, butternut squash and kale chutney was divine- perfect combination to compliment the scallops.I am deducting a point because the waitress spilled half of my Smoky Manhattan, and although she thoroughly apologized, she neither comped my drink nor brought me a new, filled one.

4.0,1/17/2011,"This review encompasses 2 dining experiences, the first one during the first week of the official opening and the second one this past weekend. It was very interesting to see the differences in the service and the menu in just a short couple of months.The reason for 4 stars would be the service that we experienced in our most recent visit. All staff were incredibly attentive, aimed to please, and in short, knew their ****.  Service alone was 5 stars.The food was all good and solid. It appears that they have edited their menu quite a bit-- in this most recent visit, we started with a grilled cheese appetizer with butternut-apple soup and the smoked sturgeon carbonara. The grilled cheese was made differently this time, though no one at the table could quite put their finger on it. The soup served with the grilled cheese was previously tomato soup....switch back to the tomato soup! The butternut-squash apple soup was barely touched by our table (which never happens). The carbonara was rich, buttery, all things that carbonara should be-- but barely any sturgeon! For entrees, one friend said it was a delicious burger, and I have to say, those fries were crunchy and extremely salty (good thing I love salt). I had the dry aged steak which was served with a buttery potato gratin. I specified medium but it came medium-rare; still delicious though!  Another friend had the Arctic char, which she enjoyed but wished there was a sufficient side, as it came with 3 small fingerling potatoes. The DESSERTS! On the night that we came, they apparently debuted 2 new desserts, the warm chocolate cake and the other, I cannot remember. No matter, we tried everything. The warm chocolate cake, though I desperately wanted to love it, was very underwhelming and sadly the letdown of the desserts. The hazelnut financier cake with vanilla semifreddo and pomegranate consomme was amazing! The beignets with vanilla custard and cranberry compote blew my mind away, and the apple crisp was perfect. The blood orange sorbet was a highlight of the ice cream and sorbets that we tried (I did not like the beer ice cream, but that may just be personal preference). Please bring back the molten chocolate tart! I loved it last time!All in all, it is a gorgeous setting and the service is wonderful. I definitely want to try more of the bar menu-- seems to be very solid, as many were ordering from it around us. Be sure to get the dessert!",0,0,0,Pam M.,"ASTORIA, NY",24,118,3
4.0,12/20/2010,"restaurantbrat.comAh, Tom Colicchio, it seems like you're everywhere these days! You wear so many hats that it's difficult to escape your sneering, somewhat haughty mug: chef, restaurateur, TV personality and unwitting gay icon, it seems like there's nothing you can't do! Except grow a proper beard, that is (come, come... that little weedy patch on your chin is crying out for some fertilizer). Thankfully, despite your follicular misgivings, you have proven time and again that your restaurants are a force to be reckoned with, and your latest installment, the Kip's Bay standout Riverpark, is a welcome addition to the New York dining scene - especially since you astutely chose to establish this gem in a neighborhood that might be generously described by some as a culinary wasteland.Strangely enough, Riverpark's odd location works in its favor. Getting there is an experience unto itself. Directing our cabbie to turn onto a brand new street (so new it doesn't even appear on Google Maps or GPS yet), we then pulled up onto an industrial chic driveway fronting a glass and steel complex. First impression: Am I still in Manhattan? We enter the building, stepping into a lobby that is part Minority Report and part MoMA light-and-sound exhibit. It's an unintuitive place for any fine dining establishment, but once you enter the restaurant itself, all doubts fade away. It is a beautifully anointed space: high ceilings boxing a maze of sleek Nordic lines, buzzing with a classy cocktail-fueled hum, a welcoming front-of-house, a stylish crowd, and a spectacular view of the East River.The menu at Riverpark does not disappoint. A starting half-dozen of Beau Soleil oysters were quite divine. While each bivalve was a tad on the petite end, what they lacked in mass they made up in flavor. These were perhaps the freshest tasting oysters I've ever had - salty yet clean, they were pristine little oceanic jewels. They were so good I put the horseradish and mignonette aside - these beasts simply had to be swallowed unadorned. A small appetizer portion of seafood spaghetti followed; the calamari rings, lobster chunks and naked cockles studded like rubies and emeralds in a rough tangle of handrolled pasta for a delectable sign of more to come. I scarfed the plate down in about the same time it just took you to read this sentence. For my main, I'd initially had trouble deciding between the pork chop or the sturgeon. With a little help from my server, I went for the sturgeon, and it proved to be a solid, if unglamorous, choice. I had only eaten sturgeon in adult form on a few occasions prior, and am more familiar with the fish in their beady, unfertilized version. Riverpark's version showcased the meaty fish in what must have been intended as an autumnal celebration of warmth and heart, but which ultimately served only to highlight the textural heaviness of the flesh. Roasted in a bed of radicchio, figs, pistachios and sunchoke (which, by the way, must be the most overused ""trendy"" vegetable of the season), the sturgeon was mild, sweet, and very thick. Flavor-wise, this dish encompassed the season well: a starchy barnyard cornucopia of heady, rooty goodness. However, each mouthful slid down my throat like an anvil, a trait in fish I am not entirely sold on. All in all, Riverpark is a great new restaurant that I will probably visit again - perhaps in the summertime when patio seating becomes available and a nice waterside view paired with a cocktail becomes too inviting to pass up.

3.0,12/13/2010,"Riverpark is a Tom Colicchio restaurant, though he's likely never picked up a pan or knife in the restaurant, which is located in a curious area of Kips Bay.  Instead, Tommy C is the ""Chef Patron"", and the restaurant merely carries his name and financial backing.  However, the food at Riverpark channels his keen knack for tightly executed food and balanced, yet reserved flavors found in his other ventures.As others have mentioned, the space is beautiful - dramatic ceilings, burnished decor, modern furniture, and a front row view of the East River.  But beauty runs skin deep, as the food at Riverpark is merely adequate, yet spendy.  Chef Sisha Ortúzar runs a tight ship in terms of execution - the pastas were perfectly al dente, and the proteins were cooked within a fraction of a degree of our requested temperature.However, there's a weary repetition of ingredients and techniques - I believe that pomegranate seeds made an appearance in the majority of dishes we sampled.  Chef Ortúzar is not necessarily a one trick pony, but perhaps a pony with a curtailed repertoire.  It's ordinary food done very well.  A preparation of hamachi crudo ($14) is done without notable superlatives, and neither more or less adequate than any other restaurant in the 'mid-scale contemporary American' genre.  Squid ink spaghetti alla chitarra is good, but not great.  Tender pillows of swiss chard ravioli went down without complaint, but garnered only a tepid response.Pork chops ($24) with a buttery smooth parsnip puree arrived as a perfect medium - intensely meaty and just the right amount of juicy.  However, a preparation just as fine could be found at Scott Bryan's restaurant, Apiary a few avenues over.  Duck breast ($27) with celery and pomegranate was appropriately seasonal and well executed, but i'm struggling to generate an appetizing adjective for this dish.Underneath the beauty and the brand name, there's only a little substance.  To be perfectly frank (and catty), the food seems to be geared more towards a sensible Midwestern audience, rather than the sophisticated New York palate.  Here, execution trumps imagination, and reliability rules.",14,3,7,Chris H.,Hong Kong,170,603,2140

Both were seasoned and cooked to perfection and served with harmonious combinations of extra-fresh vegetables, purees, and grains.

Tom Colicchio's shtick seems to be dressing up 'not bad food' as 'a really beautiful meal' - and he does it very well. Riverpark, dish-by-dish, was a three-star affair. My date's lamb cavatelli starter -just a touch overseasoned with horshradish- still trumped my dullish pumpkin-seed tortellini. The apple-glazed pork chops and scallops that followed were neither new nor notable. I chose the pot de creme to finish, while she had a sorbet trio - both elicited somewhat more enthusiastic responses than the savory menu. But Riverpark, with choice waterfront views, airy softly-lit booths, tasteful furnishings, and very smart service gets a star up on less well-maintained spots at the same ~$25 / entree price point.

While we waited for the food, the BF and I had a casual conversation (yes.. banker talk, interesting background though) about the good 'ol days with the Bristol/lilly/Imclone three way and how much money Lilly paid for ImClone. But the building is definitely nice, it's odd to find a campus feel in NYC. The oysters were very good (a bit dirtier than I like with the shell) The lobster & artichoke salad was light and crisp with refreshing orange and other citrus puree. BF's braised octopus was really good with great soup base. BF opted for the pumpkin seed tortellini turn main course and I had the rack of lamb. Both were delicious. The Lamb was cooked to perfection. Green wheat and roasted tomato added great texture to the dish. The squash soup for the tortellini was rich in flavor. Ended the night with some amazing chocolate, pear and grape sorbet. (They added happy birthday for the BF on the plate and a candel, nice touch)Overall I think it's definitely a great restaurant to revisit. the service will be better with time. One thing that's odd is that the bathroom is actually in the lobby of the building so it's outside of the restaurant. Not sure if they will have their own bathroom?",1,0,0,Laura P.,"New York, NY",60,188,116
5.0,10/9/2010,"Riverpark is basically a gift from Tom Colicchio to the forlorn Kips Bay neighborhood. During the meal, my wife and I decided that we really don't need to go anywhere else for a ""special meal"" now. We're overjoyed with the addition to the neighborhood.More importantly for people that don't live in the area, I think it is the best restaurant in NYC with a view of water. Obviously, there are great restaurants in NYC, and there are restaurants with river views. However, I've been to nearly all of the good restaurants on the edge of Manhattan, and Riverpark is quite easily the best (sorry River Cafe, Perry St. etc.). Riverpark would be a great restaurant even without the view.I had been looking forward to this meal as soon as I heard that Tom Colicchio was coming to the neighborhood, but I thought there was something fundamental about the area that meant we couldn't have nice things. I just couldn't imagine that, ultimately, this would be up to the level of his other restaurants.The approach to the restaurant is quite nice, but initially feels desolate. A block long cobblestone street leads up to the glass and steel building housing Riverpark, which is somewhat hidden on the river side.Outside the front door of the building is an ambiguous sign for ""Riverpark."" Sitting in the lobby adjacent to it is a (friendly) guard and a long bank of waist-high security turnstiles. It looks like any new office building in NYC and not what we expected. It does *not* look the right way in, as evidenced by people we saw coming in through the backdoor of the patio. The guard was very nice and directed us to the entrance.We asked to sit outside since the weather was pleasant. The restaurant was about 50-60% full (about 85-90% when we left at 9ish).The view was phenomenal ... if you think a view over the FDR and the East River is phenomenal. I'm reluctant to say the drone of cars on the FDR was pleasant, but it was non-offensive white noise.Earlier in the day, Tom Colicchio was kind enough to personally recommend (via ""social media"") the squab mole and said all the pasta was all good. So we ordered as appetizer/first course the squab mole and potato chips off of the bar menu (which they encouraged people to do).I should mention that sparkling and still water is all complimentary, which was GREATLY appreciated. None of the typical ""just tap"" silliness that one always has to deal with these days. We ordered sparkling and they were incredibly efficient at providing us with new bottles.The potato chips are served with a gorgonzola sauce on the side and rosemary on top. They were golden brown, light, and really crispy. The only disappointment was that they *looked* so good, I thought they would be piping hot out of the fryer, but they were merely ""potato chip temperature."" I couldn't stop spooning up large amounts of the sauce, which was relatively mild given that it was gorgonzola.The mole for the squab wasn't quite what we expected but it was very good nevertheless. It didn't have concentrated, traditional mole flavor, but was balanced by the surprisingly pleasing addition of pistachio, grits, and orange zest. The squab was perfectly cooked. It's not a great dish for sharing given the form factor of the squab leg, however.My entree was the rack of lamb, which I've mentioned in other reviews is my ""go to"" dish for evaluating restaurants. My wife ordered the pumpkin seed tortellini based on Colicchio's pasta suggestion.I should say ""rack"" is something of a misnomer. It's two chops. Plenty of food with the bed of stunningly good ""green wheat"" (think crunchy rice with roasted(?) tomato and meaty black trumpet mushrooms(?)) and eggplant, but not quite a ""rack."" If the lamb had come out warmer than luke-warm, it would have been the best lamb I've had in memory. Perfectly seasoned with crunchy salt on top, and super-tender medium rare. Not gamey at all. I was gnawing at the bones at the end like it was a last meal. It wasn't quite as warm as I would have liked (not the fault of the weather), so I can't say it was better than the Barbuto lamb (currently #1 for me) I had recently. The restaurant is new, so slightly off temps are completely understandable. Don't get me wrong, I *loved* the lamb, it was just a bit shy of perfection.My wife's tortellini was very good, but not quite the sensation of the lamb.I had the chocolate tart, which included gelato-like chocolate ice cream, a crispy chocolate something-or-other, and the tart itself, which had a light sprinkling of salt. It was a little tricky to get all 3 in one bite, but a perfect chocolate bite (texture/flavor/temp/etc) in the end.Less successful was the caramel ""pot de creme"", which was decent, but not really memorable, though the rosemary shortbread cookies could be sold on their own.Overall, the food made finally ended our neighborhood envy. Kips Bay can finally stand on its own.I should add that service was very good. Our server was spot on.",14,2,1,Nathan B.,"New York, NY",6,6,0
4.0,10/6/2010,"I'm a fan and I'm all kinds of excited about being one of the first to review, but have these other people been to Craft? If they're going to be so educated on Colicchio and on top of new openings, get your stars straight! Craft is unbelievable and ""as good as it gets"", Riverpark is really good and ""fan-worthy.""Most notably, the service is great. There's something to be said about a great restauranteur who picks out good people for new ventures. From the moment that I made my first phone call to them, to being escorted to my table, to paying the bill--the service was excellent. Ambiance is also really nice and they do a good job of muffling the sounds from the FDR with good music.Most importantly, the food was delicious. You really can't go wrong with pork belly. YUM! Great steak frites off the bar menu and then tastily flavored seafood stew with the halibut. Nice drink selection and just continued good service.One downfall: bathroom in the big corporate office lobby outside the restaurant...",0,0,0,Crystal T.,"New York, NY",28,88,0
5.0,10/5/2010,"I wanted to be the first to review, but it took me a while to sign on...this is my first yelp review.  I was there on the 28th for dinner and I agree with Keith G the decor is beautiful and I was sorry we didn't get a table outside.  The bar area is perfect if you want to meet a group and have a drink before you sit.  We were a table of 4 and asked our lovely waitress Beth along with the catering manager whom I have been dealing with for a corp event to choose our apps, dinner and it amazing.  I was fortunate to have a taste from both the bar menu and the restaurant.  I would have everything again.  The octopus is wonderful...I didn't think I like grilled octopus.  The fried chicken and biscuits were talked about for 2 days following dinner and the lasagna with home made pasta is filling enough for two.  You have to get the home made potato chips and believe it or not the beet pickled eggs were taste.  there were two tables of 12 by us and the place was not loud, it was a pleasant surprise.   Will be there for the opening and my corp event so will be back to report.",0,0,0,Judy K.,"New York, NY",43,2,0
5.0,9/29/2010,"Went to Riverpark, the new Tom Colicchio restaurant with head chef Sisha Ortuzar that overlooks the east river. The restaurant itself is on the ground floor of a life sciences building. We were greeted by a security guard who was guarding the longish driveway to the restaurant. He asked if we had a reservation, which we did, and then allowed us to pass. Kind of a weird exchange at first because it felt like I needed some sort of security clearance in order to eat dinner.Anyway, the decor is fantastic. its very modern but classy at the same time. The food was simply amazing. there were 4 of us, and we all took turns trying each others' dishes.we started with the braised octopus and mackerel escabeche. both were fantastic. not usually an octopus fan because i think its too rubbery-but this one was really good. it had a nice texture, and the broth that was served with it was delicious.our next course was a spaghetti with seafood and cavatelli with smoked lamb. the spaghetti tasted nice-the seafood was fresh, but far and beyond the cavatelli was soooo good. it had such a fantastic smoky flavor to it too. we were all fighting over the last bites.my friends had the scallops as entrees, which they loved, and i had the rack of lamb with a side of french fries. the lamb was perfectly cooked-great temperature, and seasoned perfectly. and the fries were sooo good too. they came out with normal tomato ketchup and an aioli which was so tasty.dessert was kind of a mixed bag-we ordered the trio of ice cream sandwiches and the caramel pot de creme. the ice cream sandwiches werent your normal chocolate cookie with vanilla ice cream. the sandwiches are made with different savory and sweet sorbets with peanut butter and oatmeal raisin cookies. the pot de creme itself was fantastic too--but there was some sort of dried apple that came with it that was kind of whatever.anyway, such a fantastic meal. cant wait to try the bar menu.",4,0,0,Patrick G.,"New York, NY",4,26,0
