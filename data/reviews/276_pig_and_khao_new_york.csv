1.0,4/27/2019,"One of the worst dining experiences I've had. It started off on a bad start with me and my boyfriend seated near where the servers were coming in and out at the bar. We ordered the papaya salad and ka prow to start and rum & Hyde and Yuzu beer to drink. The small dishes were not to my liking but my boyfriend enjoyed it. Next, we ordered the Malaysian fried chicken... except it never came until we had to request for it again almost an hour after finishing our appetizers. During this time we tried to flag down a server and ask about what our neighbors were having where he dismissively scoffs at what we asked until we asked another server and was told it was mantao buns, which we ended up ordering. Once we requested for the fried chicken, they called out for it to be made only it was poorly executed when they made the mistake in the first place. 1) THE CHICKEN WAS UNDERCOOKED. I had a drumstick only to find out it was half cooked. 2) the menu says there is pineapple chutney, there was NO pineapple chutney but a sloppy display of 4 pieces of chicken with some sad looking curry leaves. The server didn't come around at all asking if we were waiting on anything after sitting for an hour in between appetizers and the unfortunate fried chicken. I am extremely disappointed and unhappy with this establishment seeing that I paid $100 for what was a horrendous dining experience.. I should have known better when I saw the C rating on yelp for health reviews!!",0,0,0,Alina J.,"Brooklyn, NY",93,63,11
4.0,4/24/2019,"With the abundance of restaurants I'm dying to try in NYC, it's rare that I'll return to one in particular over and over again. So the fact that I've lost count of how many times I've been to Pig and Khao must say something! The food here is consistently good and the service is always friendly and efficient. I recommend sharing several small plates - the khao soi is one dish I always order no matter what, and I'm not even the biggest curry fan normally. It's delicious. Would also recommend the coconut rice as a side - comes in heaping portions and is perfectly fragrant and slightly salty. Your meal isn't complete without it!!My only gripe (which isn't the restaurant's fault at all) is this place is always poppin no matter what. I last came here on a Monday and my friend and I had to scream to hear each other - it was that packed and loud. Definitely make reservations  unless you're trying to wait a loooong time for a table.I live pretty far from the LES but am always happy to make the trek here :)",0,0,0,Deanna K.,"New York, NY",114,20,1
5.0,4/20/2019,"My absolute favorite place for Filipino food!! I live literally next door to Pig and Khao and I have to say I order take out and eat here way too much!!Here are some of my favorite dishes: chili pan mee is so good, the crispy pata is so flavorful and great, and lastly pork belly adobo is flavorful as well. I've also eaten breakfast here, the sausage is amazing and they have cool options like corn beef hash. Brunch also has bottomless mimosas for $16.I'd highly recommend coming here for a taste of the Filipino cuisines. They also have some really great Thai food!

2.0,4/15/2019,"My friend and I came Friday evening for dinner and we only ordered three items to share fam style, two large plates: the whole fried fish, and crispy pata and two sides of coconut rice. I have been here before many years ago and I distinctly remember liking this place but just haven't been back but this time has helped me decide to never come again. We only ordered three items and every single dish had an issue. These so called ""large"" not so large plates are definitely not worth the $30 price range. Although the fish had a great sauce, the fish and pata were beyond fried and overcooked, and the flavor of the pata was meh, the sauces that came with it were meh. I honestly stopped eating the pata midway my dinner because it was so chewy and dry. Also when the runner brought over the rice, the moment I saw the bowls of rice I knew IMMEDIATELY it was going to be mushy and it definitely was. Comeon, how the fuck do you fuck up rice?? I'm not the type to send back food or complain but just want the restaurant to know you can fool the wannabe LES hipsters with this bullshit but not this asian. Also the service was meh and the host and busser were trying to low-key rush us and as a former server, stop doing that shit, you're just going to piss people off.",0,0,0,Gwu3 ..,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0

The dishes here are family styled and I'm glad that we shared. Although some of the dishes were super tasty, they were more on the heavy side. I liked how some of the dishes were accompanied with a small side salad to lighten up the dish.Our group also decided to partake in the bottomless drinks for brunch. We liked the lychee mimosas and enjoyed how they weren't syrupy like most places. Service was decent as well but a little delayed when it came down to ensuring that our water bottle for the table was filled. My only complaint is that there is a single bathroom in the entire restaurant. For a place to have bottomless brunch and a single bathroom, it doesn't really add up.

3.0,3/23/2019,"I came here for an event, so I'm actually not sure if the regular dining experience is reflective of the thing I experienced... still, I can give it a shot.One of the more interesting things that I tried here which I'm not sure I understood was the coconut rice- people raved about this thing, but I actually don't think I could taste any coconut in the rice. I suppose the coconut didn't get mixed in to the portion that we were eating, which is kind of unfortunate. Still, I don't understand how this happened.We also got to try a few other dishes, such as the white pepper lobster, and the sizzling sissig. The lobster was of course excellent, but a think a lot of this I would credit it to simply being lobster (this stuff is hard to mess up). The sissig I actually thought was a little disappointing, because it lacked any kind of distinct flavor that I was anticipating. In the end though, I thought it was fine.Dessert was halo halo. I should really stop eating this stuff because I just fundamentally don't enjoy eating desserts made of ice. I will try to come back here for the brunch, because honestly I ate here so long ago, I'm not sure if my memory is serving me correctly.",1,0,1,Matt L.,"New York, NY",108,694,604

You seriously cannot go wrong with any of the food here. If you're one that can't handle spiciness, be careful with the mushroom salad... and MAKE SURE YOU GET THEIR COCONUT RICE! I had trouble deciding on which cocktail to order from their list (and I forgot which drink I ended up ordering) as they all sound amazing. Always crowded, especially during dinnertime.

5.0,3/6/2019,"Went here on a Friday night during Restaurant week. The Food was so good and the portions were really filling. Papaya Salad was really refreshing, and a little spicy but I like spicy. Grilled pork jowl and brussel sprouts were yummy wish the pork was more crispy.Pork Belly Adobo was so good really appreciated the egg. I didn't really like the baby back ribs it was really underwhelming and nothing special about it as well as the fried chicken didn't like that at all.Khao Soi was really good that was a whole entrée on it's own. I really enjoyed that!The coconut rice I could've eaten by itself, it was just the right amount of coconut flavor and so soft. The jasmine rice is meh. Halo Halo had a taro ice cream that I really liked, I wish there just served that for dessert honestly. Some flan pieces and plantain pieces. I would get it again it was different I don't usually eat it so it was cool. Turon and ice cream I didn't like because of the banana filling but that's my preference it wasn't bad though. I would come again to try foods I haven't tried and brunch! and that coconut rice!! Omg so good!",0,0,0,Christine N.,"West Bronx, NY",0,30,0
5.0,3/4/2019,"I came here during restaurant week and I feel in love! I don't like coconut at all but their coconut rice is to die for. Since I had their coconut rice I have decided to try coconut other places, but none of them taste the same as Pig and Khao. It's just soooooo good you have no idea you need to try it. This is the first place that I love to eat Brussels sprouts. If you don't like Brussels Sprouts, try their grilled pork Jowl salad. It's amazing and just so juicy. I finished the whole salad. Since I came here during restaurant week the portions for ribs were smaller. But their salad and pork belly I believe they were the same portion. I wasn't a big fan of their dessert halo-halo. However, I like their Turon. You should make room for dessert !",1,1,1,Rosalia X.,"Brooklyn, NY",684,83,95
4.0,3/3/2019,"Came into the restaurant this weekend for dinner. We had a reservation and were running a bit late, but after calling and giving them a head's up, upon arrival we were seated immediately.With a group of four, the server recommended one large plate, and we chose the duck, and four small plates, so we tried the sirloin, octopus, pork adobo and the khao soi. The best dish by far was the pork adobo, and the side of coconut rice. The pork was cooked to perfection and the coconut rice was the perfect texture and was just the right amount of sweet. I'd eat it again tomorrow. If you're interested in a curry, the Khao soi is good, spicy and very curry forward. The sirloin also had a unique texture, was cooked well, rare in the middle but almost crispy around the edges, it worked. The only item on the menu that didn't work for me was the baby octopus. I found it was very (overly) fishy tasting, and I don't think it was cooked right as it was very chewy. Besides that, we had a great meal!",3,1,2,Jacqueline L.,"San Diego, CA",104,210,250

My friend and I came on a Sunday afternoon and was luckily seated right away. The music for Sunday brunch gave me Saturday night out vibes which is great if you're drunk on bottomless mimosas, but if you're trying to have a nice sober conversation as we were, you'll find yourself saying I'M SORRY WHAT? a lot. The food was good but definitely not worth the price. My friend got the Sizzling Sisig which came with rice and was mediocre but not worth the $18 that we paid. The steak was quite rare but I've definitely had better steak and eggs elsewhere. The Vietnamese iced coffee was a whopping $5 and came with half ice.

5.0,2/22/2019,"The Pig and Khao is Filipino food. I think this restaurant opened before the Anthony Bourdain episode in his last season, and so they caught the wave. If Bourdain is right, the wave hasn't even started yet. I can't remember where I read it--the Thai government is using some sort of propaganda campaign to make a whole lot of Thai restaurants in the United States? The Philippines is a democracy, so that's not going to happen. I think because it's New York City, and because of the large Filipino neighborhoods in Westchester and Rockland Counties, this is the place to find this kind of food. 2018 this was the second year in a row I've gone to Filipino food on my birthday. In 2017 I went to Jeepney, closer to Union Square and still on the East Side. Jeepney boasts more Hawaiian influence, whereas Pig and Khao has a more hipster vibe. Both restaurants featured the mix of sweet, sour, and spicy. I did the tasting menu, and I had a bunch of beers. Bourdain was right--this is the perfect food for beer. Beer's carbs act like sugar to go with the salt in the pork belly. I don't think this restaurant is worth it if you're vegetarian or keeping Kosher. I think the pork belly is where it's at. I will say that I had an upset stomach after Pig and Khao that I didn't have at Jeepney, just because the food is so very heavy and fatty. Tastes excellent, but make sure you're eating the fibers and crunch--and especially ginger or pickled ginger-- they give with your pork belly. This is an excellent restaurant. The waiters pool tips and tables--eating at Pig and Khao can seem like a whirlwind--and are dressed in only the freshest hipster attire. These are easily the best-looking waiters and waitresses in the city. I really love the Buddha beers they have, and I know the restaurant is going to be mad but I can't actually remember any Filipino beers there? Sorry guys. Also I thought the deserts were interesting but I'm not a fan of Filipino shaved ice. That's not Pig and Khao's fault, that's straight from the Archipelago.",1,0,0,Gordon E.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,77,0

We were late by like 30 min to our reservation LOL but luckily for us they let us sit (it was also 3pm so....i hope so haha)service was nice but sparse and not necessarily helpful, and restroom was clean except for the fact someone had thrown up in the sink barfffff. All the food came out at different times, to the point where we basically finished one dish and the next one came out. i would recommend ordering one dish more than the number of heads in your party; the dishes were priced pretty heftily though. we ordered:pork jowl + brussels sprouts (4/5): my favorite of the meal (it was my first bite and i was hungry!), and it came out first; brussels sprouts were flavorful and yummy and the pork pieces weren't plentiful but still flavorful. khao soi curry noodles (5/5): jk this might actually be my favorite; crunchy pieces with perfectly cooked noodles in a delicious curry soup/broth. wish i ordered two of these. chili pan mee (4/5): yummy spicy noodles. i remember liking this very much, but honestly can't picture the dish anymore bc i'm still thinking about the khao soi LOL mixed an egg into it so it was creamy too. sizzling sisig (4/5): i think this was good but i couldn't really get too much of it before the rest of my party got to it. the few pieces that i did have were good and crunchy, but i wish there was just....more lolgarlic rice (3/5): standard, similar to gyu-kaku's garlic rice. nothing to write home about in my book, and at $4 a bowl for a single person, i would recommend ordering one less bowl for each head at your table. overall good (but expensive) experience, and a tasty first filipino food experience for me!",1,0,1,Jessica W.,"Dallas, TX",200,588,9

Very hip, funky vibes and great throwback music playlist. Our server was very quick, cool, and efficient. Awesome memory as well!I ordered the green papaya salad, pork belly adobo, Mongolian fried chicken, and halo halo. Also tried the Khao soi and turon. Papaya salad was fresh and not too fishy with the fish sauce. Fabulous way to start. The pork belly adobo was a little salty but very tender and flavorful. However, I loved the Khao soi! The combination of crunchy and soft noodles was heavenly. I like that the fried chicken thigh came boneless so it was easy to eat.

3.0,2/5/2019,"I dropped by Pig and Khao for brunch with some friends and overall we had a great time. The servers were friendly and attentive, the interior decoration had the quirkiness and character of a dive bar with the polish of a NY restaurant, and it's somewhere that I could see coming back to regularly, once I figure out the menu.We stopped by during restaurant week, so we worked off the restaurant's fixed menu. The first plate was the papaya salad, which is only tangentially related to Thai green papaya salads. Pig and Khao's version is salty, with just a mild kick, and laced with tender pork bites. If I had to guess, I'd say the dressing has rice vinegar in it. I enjoyed the texture and flavor on this one.Next up was the sizzling sissig. Our server recommended we break the eggs topping the pork and mix it all together, which was sound advice. The menu listed the cut of meat as pork head, which I expected to be tender (since generally that means cheek), but it was actually on the tougher/ tendony side and a shade bland.This brings me to the final course: the doughnut. The actual frying of the doughnut was on point, but the dough didn't have any sugar in it, which necessitates dipping it in a vividly green side sauce. I expected the sauce to have some kind of flavor to match the color, but it was basically a thin, sweet custard. I admit that I was a bit thrown by the doughnut, and initially thought it might have something to do with the Super Bowl, but neither team's colors this year are green.

It was a little chilly in the back patio area, but I could see the patio being perfect for summer. We started off with a plate of roasted peanuts which they brought out straight away. The peanuts were good, but pretty spicy, definitely strong  really strong lemongrass and kaffir flavor. We then ordered the fried chicken which was excellent, we totally devoured it. The pineapple chutney and curry leaves gave it a unique flavor profile. The half Hainanese duck was also really good and the duck fat rice was amazing! My only minor complaint was that the small pieces of duck on the side of the large duck breast came with a ton of fat on them. The sauce was excellent. The Khao Soi noodles dish was awesome, so much flavor! These Thai noodle dishes are becoming my favorite thing ever. I love the the hot, soft noodle pairing with the crispy strips of top.

Overall, my boyfriend who ordered more of the meat dishes liked the meal more (4/5) while I thought it was more of a 3/5. Pros(+) Dishes had unique flavors: I wasn't personally a fan of the flavors in the dishes I had, but the flavors were very unique. It wasn't something that you would get from any Thai restaurant(+) Restaurant Week: I liked that we got to try several dishes during restaurant week but several tables around us actually just opted to order their own(+) Good for Groups: There is a large tented area in the back that was serving a large (maybe corporate / organization) groupCons(-) Slow Service: There was another very large group that was dining at the same time as us. I think this might be the reason behind the slow service, but we spent much of the meal idly waiting for our foodI wasn't really impressed with any of the dishes I ordered.

4.0,2/2/2019,"Chose to come here based on reviews, our desire for bottomless brunch, and it's proximity to our hotel on Ludlow St.  Loved the mimosas (heavy on the champagne, light on the juice), and the fantastic food that will leave you wanting more.  My husband and I came during restaurant week (unbeknownst to us) and went for the restaurant week brunch menu, which was $26 for 4 courses (two entrees, a rice dish, and a dessert).  Given that each dish is usually $15-18, we felt this was an awesome deal.  Keep in mind the portions may be smaller than if you ordered off the regular menu, but we preferred it that way so that we could try a variety of different dishes without overeating.  Even with the slightly ""smaller"" portions, we were still extremely full, so it was more than enough.Now for the rating of each dish (which helped me determine the 4 star rating overall):Pork jowl:  4/5 (real good but a little too vinegary)Papaya salad:  4/5 (light and fresh but also a little too vinegary)Sisig: 5/5 (perfect flavor and goes great with the garlic rice)Garlic rice: 4/5 (definite garlic taste, not oily at all (so some may think it's dry), great accompaniment to the entrees)Corn beef hash:  4/5 (great flavor but sisig outshines this dish) Champorado:  5/5 (perfect warm Filipino chocolate rice pudding with BACON bits, need I say more?)Solid food and the unlimited mimosas really made a fantastic brunch experience overall.  Would come back if we're in the area again.  Only suggestion is to crank up the heat, as I felt a cold draft the entire time even though we sat far from the front door.",0,0,0,Irene W.,"Livingston, NJ",198,73,51

The place has an open kitchen so you can smell so many flavors. I have gone here twice before and will continue. I recommend the khai soi! The curry based broth with soft and crunch noodles and pieces of chicken. It is not spicy but has plenty of spices. It is absolutely delicious, I always make sure I get that. I also recommend sharing food because there's too many good things. I also had the ribs which are ALOT along with white rice, which is a shareable plate for sure.

We ordered a few different items for all share;  longonissa side, 2 garlic rices, 2 sisigs, 2 bahn xeos and a chili pan mee. As usual, everything was beyond delicious. All the contrasts in the dishes really turn it into something special. One of my friends is not an adventurous eater so I was nervous what she would think and she loved it!

4.0,1/29/2019,"My friends and I made reservations through Opentable for dinner on Saturday. The four of us decided this spot was best to share a bunch of small/large plates, as the menu is suited more to do so. Inside the restaurant, it's pretty well lit with more of a casual vibe. Warning: because the chefs are cooking nearby, your clothes will be very pungent after of various meat/food smells. As for the dishes, split between the four of us, we had:1. Ka prow (stir fried beef, basil, egg): this dish was pretty spicy, but found it to be flavorful and very good with the coconut rice2. Pork belly adobo: this dish was bit small (wish we could've had more pork) but the pork was perfectly tender and crispy. The sauce had a kick and the poached egg was perfect to eat over rice. 3. Khao soi (red curry, egg noodles): I've never had a dish like this before - it had a unique flavor and a good portion of egg noodles. Pretty flavorful and also good to eat with the rice.4. BBQ baby back ribs: I thought the ribs were a little bit dry, had a good flavor, but not sure this is worth the hefty $27 price tag. 5. Malaysian fried chicken: Again, this was a hefty $28 for four pieces of fried chicken. They were good and had a lot of flavor, but not sure I'd re-order just due to the price.6. Two sides of coconut rice: had to order one more because this was so good. Highly recommend!7. Side of jasmine riceKeep note that none of the dishes come with rice so you will have to make sure you order them on the side. Overall, for a casual ""street food"" joint, I found the price tag a bit hefty. I would not come with just one person as this seems more enjoyable to split several dishes with a group of 3+ people. They have a cool selection of beers and we were too full to try the dessert (but the ricotta donuts sound amazing). Overall, we ended up leaving pretty full with all the food we ordered and spent around $40 each - not too bad.",1,1,1,Alice K.,"Queens, Queens, NY",42,87,201

Also this is a restaurant week review.I came here for restaurant week and made a reservation for 1:45PM on a Sunday. The place was packed but we were seated immediately. The vibe was really fun and kind of rowdy but it was way too loud to have a proper conversation without shouting at each other. The food wasn't particularly special but it was very filling and delicious.1st Course: Grilled Pork Jowl/Green Papaya Salad - I actually liked the green papaya salad more than the pork jowl, which was highly recommended. The salad was extremely refreshing and a good prep dish before the truly meat-filled entrees.2nd Course: Longonissa/Sizzing Sisig - Both of these were good and hearty. The sisig was a little disappointing since the pieces were small so some of them got burnt. The longonissa was more basic but cooked well and was great with the garlic rice.Dessert: Powdered Sugar Donuts/Champorado - The champorado was SO GOOD. Not too sweet and not moderately chilled. The powdered donuts are what you'd expect.Rice: Garlic Fried Rice - Yum.

4.0,1/26/2019,"**Restaurant week review**The food seemed to be generically Southeast Asian with a heavier hand of Filipino influences. I'm glad I went during restaurant week because it allowed me to try a bunch of dishes (there was way too much food), and the service and food quality didn't seem to suffer like at other establishments during RW. Overall everything was pretty good, but the standouts for me were the khao soi (spicier than expected, in a good way) and the coconut fried rice. Our water refills were hilariously frequent and I loved the ambiance of the restaurant; it had the feel of a simple SE Asian shanty restaurant without too much decor, and seamlessly mixed in elements of New York without feeling offensive and ""not Asian enough.""Things I ate:green papaya salad - too heavy handed with the lemon, but otherwise okaypork jowl with brussel sprouts - the brussel sprouts were great, I thought I'd have more of an opinion about the jowl, but it was missablepork adobo - very well done, the crispy pork skin was a nice switch upkhao soi - I loved the broth, it reminded me of the spiciest best roti prata dipping sauce I could remember Singapore fried chicken - the chicken was very well done.

Both items are good, but not delicious. The meat is on the fatty side, not much actual meat. The noodle sauce is actually pretty yummy, but I felt the noodle itself is not on par to complement the sauce. Overall, I left without the urge to come back. The service was okay.

3.0,1/16/2019,"After hearing the raving reviews of Pig & Khao from friends, media, everyone and their mothers, I knew I had to make a reservation and dine here during my stay in NYC! I was very excited to finally try this restaurant & it was the first place I made a reservation for when planning my trip.Not sure if it was the hype from everyone before my trip, the cramped 2 person table my party of 3 squeezed into, the long wait between dishes coming to the table, the lack of attention from servers (we tried to wave someone down to ask about our duck), the half cooked rice (that came out AFTER adobo!!! This is almost a sin!!!) or the length of time the hainanese duck took to come out (45 mins after we ordered!), I was pretty disappointed.Maybe it was an off day or simply because I'm lucky to live where Asian/Asian fusion is everywhere...but my friends and I left with nothing great to say. The food was not bad, but it wasn't ""WOW, I NEED to fly across the country to eat this!!!"" My group decided to share everything family style and choose to order the pork belly adobo, Malaysian butter prawn, and hainanese duck. Since we're eating family style (like an Asian family dinner style, sides with rice....), we all order a bowl of coconut rice. The pork belly was a good rendition, ode to lechon and adobo. Loved the crispy pork and the vinegary sauce to ""cut"" the fatty texture and cleaning our palate. There were not enough pieces to go around, it was GOOD. The rice came out the same time as the butter prawns. Honestly, the burnt crumbly egg bits were probably the most memorable of the dish because it went well with rice. The egg reminded me of the salted egg crumbles from the salted egg fish skin chips. Also, just go with normal rice and don't order the coconut rice, because the rice grains came out half overcooked and half uncooked. My group of friends all picked at their rice, even though we were all ravenous from a day of exploring Manhattan. The duck would've been good too, had it not taken the kitchen 45 mins to send out, and only 10 min after we notified a server. The server told us it was cause they make it fresh...but the duck came out cold. (I was crying a little on the inside cause we all filled up on air and previous dishes by the time the duck came). This was a great try and if I do make a trip to NYC again, I wouldn't mind trying the Khao Soi.

3.0,1/2/2019,"Seated two steps away from the bathroom door, our group of three knew that our seating arrangements were less than ideal, nevertheless we set out to taste Leah Cohen's latest remix of hip hop influences and Southeast Asian cuisine. It isn't a surprise that Leah and Ben have their back of the house in order. With years of experience in the restaurant business, the pair have created a fun and open kitchen atmosphere where guests can peek into the inner workings of a Southeast Asian ""Street"" Kitchen. With the back of the house in such great order the performance of the front of the house leaves guests with more questions than answers. With some waiters sliding down dishes and saying ""here you go,"" and some even asking us ""Are you guys waiting for something?"" I have rarely felt so unwelcome at a restaurant. Guess i'll just have to chalk that one up to the ""authentic"" ambience. To the actual dishes:  The Green Papaya salad was refreshing and had the perfect amount of heat and funk (fish sauce) which proved to be the perfect opening dish. The added touch of chicken sparked our curiosity on what the chefs could offer with a full portion of protein.The kitchen's second dish was the Chilli Pan Mee, a traditional Southeast Asian Egg Noodle dish that is paired with spicy pork ragu, fried anchovies and a slow poached egg. While the flavors and textures all play well with each other in one bite, the portions is where I had some concerns. For me, a typical family-style restaurant portions requires each person to be able to have more than just a couple bites. Unfortunately, today's Chilli Pan Mee was more for a couple to share than for a larger table. The two proteins we had ordered; the Pork Belly Adobo and Crispy Pata were by far the highlights of the night. Not only did each dish have us craving for more, but the fat content in each bite of pork was also well discerned. Furthermore, the skin of the pork belly and pork belly remained crispy and mouth watering throughout.  Definitely a place I would love to comeback to for a weekday late-lunch.",1,0,0,Jeff L.,"Taipei, Taiwan",249,2,0

5.0,11/28/2018,"On a Wednesday evening at 7:00pm there was no wait to be seated (we were seated in front of the chefs tabletop bar). The restaurant is so hip with pretty loud music but it's great just bobbing your head to the beats. Watching the cooks do their thing was also very entertaining as well (damn they move fast, especially the cook in charge of small plates). The atmosphere is fun and a nice place to chill at and eat after work or make it a casual date night. We came as a party of two and just ordered 2 small plates which was very filling already (the bf who thought we needed to order more food and eats a lot was very full after these two plates). I was in the mood for Filipino food so I simply went straight to the pork sisig and adobo. The sisig was sizzling hot and smelled amazing when it came out with an egg cracked on top. The pork was so tasty and was crispy too with a hint of tartness and spice. We matched this with a bowl of coconut rice which was also delicious on its own. They give you a LOT of rice (felt like two bowls of rice on top of each other and densely packed in).The adobo pork was crispy pork belly but oh my goodness it was so tender on the inside! This came with a poached egg which helped balance the rich sauce. I definitely recommend both these plates. I never had halo halo before so we ordered one to try it out. It came in a pretty big bowl with a scoop of ube ice cream and coconut meat ""noodles"" with mountain yam and chunks of flan on top of shaved ice. I could do with less ice but it tasted great after eating the two meats. Interesting how they had mountain yam included but was a great treat! Total came out to be $50 for the 3 things. Overall great atmosphere and would recommend these selections.",1,1,1,Jessica L.,"Flushing, NY",366,145,265
4.0,11/28/2018,"Really tasty Southeast Asian fusion cuisine - the chef is half Filipino and the dishes are a mix of Filipino, Thai,  and Vietnamese food. The dishes highlights all the great ways pork can be prepared. Two of us shared 3 small dishes for dinner and were full. All the dishes had complex Southeast Asian flavors - like chili, mint,  and fish sauce. Highly recommend the Chili Pan Mee itsitsa reay tasty noodle dish (no broth)  with ground pork and a soft boiled egg on top. The location and ambiance is also really nice. My biggest critique is that they should have a coat check because the kitchen is open and the cooking smell lingers on your jacket.",1,0,1,Tony T.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0

It was a least 95 degrees in that restaurant, the music was super loud and people are just crammed in there. Everybody was shouting to converse over the blaring audio. We say there for a long time before a waiter acknowledged us. We asked to be moved to an empty table more in the corner -- there were several. They refused to move us, so we refused to sit there and be miserable. We had a great meal with friendly service across the street.

4.0,11/24/2018,"I had been here about two times now.  First time for brunch and the second time for dinner.  We made reservation here because my girlfriend was a SELECT member so we get a free complimentary dish.  Service: The waiters were very quick with arranging the tables and getting us the menu, but there were times when we felt neglected.  However its what you would expect from a busy and popular restaurant.  Food: I ordered the Vietnamese Iced coffee ($5), Pork Belly Adobo ($15), Khao Soi ($17), and half hainanese duck ($33).  Everything was delicious and exploded in my mouth.  The hainanese duck took a long time to be served, however it was very worth the wait.  We were already full from the pork belly adobo and Khao Soi, however we kept eating because of the duck.  It was served in slices and came with a sauce to dip it.  The duck was very juicy and the skin itself was crispy.  Overall:  Great place to share food with friends and family.  I will definitely come back here one day.",0,0,0,Addison C.,"New York, NY",216,70,140

We shared all the dishes in a big group and my only gripe is that I wanted MORE of every dish that came out. We could have ordered two of everything on the menu and been happy. That isn't to say that the food wasn't enough: portion size, everything was fantastic. I just meant, the food is SO GOOD that you keep wishing there were more of it. Beware, things are spicy and bold, unapologetically so. And I was hungry for it. I loved the sticky coconut rice. I wanted to try everything and probably will come back, jam out at the bar, and put more meat in my mouth. See you there. Oink oink.",3,1,4,Rose K.,"New York, NY",413,475,648
4.0,11/20/2018,"Came here for boozy brunch with a few friends and the food/drinks did not disappoint. I will admit, I came a little skeptical, but everything we had - chili pan mee, sizziling sisig, khao soi, and brioche French toast - exceeded my expectations. The drinks were great and our waiter was super attentive. Only thing I didn't realize is that dishes come out as they're prepared - a fine method of dining, but just wish I didn't order everything at once!The review sadly gets knocked down a star due to the rude hostess that blatantly tried to push us out for another table. I get brunch is a popular time, but if you're going to make the mimosas a 2 hour deal, you should do a much better job of managing and respecting that. We had a few minutes to enjoy one last drink before 2 hours post-reservation time (which definitely wasn't when we started the 2 hour drinks - those came about 15 minutes in, which is fine in nearly any situation when you're not getting kicked out), and she rudely denied us and said it didn't matter that it hadn't been 2 hours since we sat down. Our great waiter let us finish, and overall I was extremely pleased with my brunch there.

We ordered the majority of the menu, but the flavor profile was possibly a little too bold and spicy for me. I found myself eating the sticky coconut rice, mostly to simmer the intensity of the flavors and spice. The portions are small so I encourage you to order tapas style and share with the table. Given the portion size, the prices are on the higher end for Filipino / Thai food.I enjoyed the atmosphere - trendy, great music and louder vibe.   Service was very attentive and helpful in navigating the menu.

4.0,11/15/2018,"Pig and Khao is a vibrant, hipster Southeast Asian spot on the Lower East Side offering up carnivore-friendly riffs on Filipino and Thai dishes.This place can be a bit of a madhouse on weekends, clocking hour-plus waits at peak, and it seems to maintain its popularity on weeknights. I'd recommend reserving if you can-- you'll have your pick about a week out. Noise levels are high, with a hip hop soundtrack and a bustling crowd. I've ended up sitting at the chef's counter for both visits, and while I recommend it for a fun date activity to watch dishes being made, it can get a little hot. The whole restaurant runs warm in summer.The menu is divided into large and small plates, though the portion sizes don't vary wildly, as well as some bar snacks. Dishes range from neighborhood Thai standbys like green papaya salad and khao soi to hearty Filipino sisig and pork adobo, with Malaysian, Chinese, and fusion dishes well represented. Vegetarians can cobble something together if necessary; pescatarians have solid options. For 2, a large, a small, and a snack should be perfect.When Pig and Khao shines, it truly shines. I'm no sisig expert, but their version ($16) is my favorite thus far, with juicy pig head you could easily mistake for pork belly topped with a sizzling egg. Just simple and flavorful. Malaysian fried chicken ($28) was similarly straightforward brilliance: craggy, piping hot chicken with delightful dueling toppings of spicy sambal and a finely pureed pineapple chutney. I dream of each.Even our losers of dishes weren't bad, just skippable. Thai-lote ($8) subtly improves on the classic Mexican grilled corn with sambal butter, kaffir lime, and coconut, but it was a bit too subtle for me to justify paying that price for it. Grilled pork jowl ($14) put more brussels sprouts on the plate than slivers of salty meat, but they were just the way I like them-- crispy and doused with lime, chili, and fish sauce.Barbecued baby back ribs ($27) had good quality meat and sauce yet failed to be memorable for me. Baby octopus paksaw ($16) was devoured by my companions, but I found myself looking more a more assertive kick from the black vinegar butter to counter the charred cephalopod. The beverage program offers a slim list of house cocktails ($13), largely classics gussied up with on-brand additions like curry leaves or Thai chili honey. The Baboy Daiquiri is worth a taste for the nice tingle of szechuan peppercorn, but as they tend to be fruitier and on the lighter side, I would otherwise stick with beers here to complement the food. They offer an adventurous selection with offbeat breweries like Evil Twin, Westbrook, and Stillwater offset by easy-drinking San Miguel.The meal pace is relaxed and well suited to drinking. Decor is appropriately downtown-cool and ambiance is casual and celebratory, fun without forcing. Service seems rushed and the wait to place orders and pay can be long (and this was with sitting at the counter were servers were picking up and dropping off), though individual servers are professional and friendly.On a good night, and with the right dishes, Pig and Khao is one of the best dinners in New York. However, prices are high and it's hard to always play your cards right when everything looks so tempting on paper. I'd recommend booking a big group dinner here to feast on the sharing-style menu, though it will also do well for a date. I'd give them a try for the less-slammed brunch too-- sisig is basically ham and eggs, right?",5,2,3,Liz S.,"New York, NY",952,772,1843

It's moreso a Southeast Asian restaurant with some Filipino dishes. All I remember was that portions were small and couldn't get over it. The price was a bit hefty.

My cousins and I basically ordered everything and that's not just cause we have personal ties but man... not going to lie I wish I could bring this place back to West Coast. They even have veggies, brussel sprouts were a sit. CRISPY  pata, crispy chicken, baby back ribs, sisig, chicharron, coconut rice, coconut water and halo halo was on POINT! I will go here every time I visit NYC. Reservations highly recommended.

As for the food, the sisig was incredible, the Khao Pai noodles had this incredible red curry - which you should save for your coconut rice. Oh man, that coconut rice was sheer heaven, and it's the first time I asked for a takeaway bag of rice! Duck was spectacular, and reminded me a little of crispy Indonesian duck.

5.0,10/17/2018,"Came here on a Saturday evening and there was about a 45 minute wait for a table for two. So my friend and I put our name down and hopped on over to a bar on the nearby corner (Black Crescent). The nice server there recommended the Khao Soi to us, and he was like ""that place (Pig & Khao), is SO good."" So once we were seated (it was almost exactly a 45 min wait, btw) we took his recommendation and ordered the Khao Soi, sisig, and papaya salad. We also ordered an order of the plain jasmine rice & the coconut one. We were hoping there'd be garlic rice, but sadly no.I'm not a fan of coconut, but trust me, get the coconut rice. It's SO much better than plain. It's slightly sweet and a little sticky, and goes so well with the food.Everything we ordered was delicious. Sisig was a little too salty, but great with the rice. Honestly, everything looked so good on the menu, but two people can only eat so much. All the food we ordered was in the ""side plates"" section, but each dish was a normal 1-person meal size. Then again, the dishes are pretty pricy, so I'd be a little upset if the dishes came out like tapas-size. But I still don't get why a papaya salad is $14. The tables are a very small, so it's hard to get all your food at once and eat it all together along with your glasses/bottle of wine.

I know it's just rice, but it might be best thing here. I don't know how they made rice so delicious. It goes great with the Khao Soi. I would come back just to get a random dish and this rice.For our large plate, we got the ribs. We didn't enjoy these too much. There was a decent amount of meat and they were perfectly cooked, but something was off about the taste. The glaze/sauce tasted bitter and had a somewhat alcoholic aftertaste.This is a good spot to get multiple dishes to share.

[2] Khao Soi - red curry, coconut milk, chicken, egg noodles. I'm a big fan of Khao Soi and Pig and Khao's rendition of Khao Soi did not disappoint. Loved the egg noodles and the creamy texture and taste of the curry and coconut milk. [3] Malaysian Fried Chicken - Crispy fried chicken served with sweet pineapple chutney, sambal, curry leaves, this dish had a little kick to it. [4] Half Hainanese Duck - fatty duck served over delicious duck fat rice and topped with ginger and chili sauce. Pig and Khao is definitely one of the better Southeast Asian restaurants I've had in awhile. The dishes we had was totally a fusion of Filipino, Malaysian, Singaporean, and Thai.

I Thought it was very rude, also my friend got up to go to the bathroom and as he was getting up, he slightly bumped into the same server and after apologizing to him, the server rolled his eyes and walked off.

4.0,9/5/2018,"I've been here on two different occasions and really love the food here. Recently came here for restaurant week and was overjoyed to have so many dishes of food. Loved every single plate I ordered.  The pork jowl and brussel Sprouts were stir fried to perfection, crispy and smoky. Papaya salad was very refreshing and crunchy. The khao soi was spicy! But loved every bite of it. The only thing that lacked flavor were the mussels. The desserts, both the turon and Halo Halo, actually might have topped all the savory dishes.

3.0,9/3/2018,Came here for dinner with a friend on a hot summer night. When we walked in it was still a hot summer night. The Ac must've been broken and on top of that they have an open kitchen in the middle of the restaurant which did not help. There's an inner seating room which might be cooler so we requested to be moved close to that area. We were served warm water unfortunately which was hard to believe - I felt like I was being punished.But anyway we had an ok waiter who took our order. It was a little difficult for me o decide what I wanted so I asked him for his suggestion which he said was the Khao soi. i took some additional time to decide and almost every 2 minutes the waiter would come back to take my order. I felt I was being rushed. I ended up getting the pork belly adobo but before I could order the rice the waiter was gone.The food came piping hot which would've been good if it was cool in the restaurant. I tried the pork belly with the coconut rice and the star was definitely the coconut rice - it is a must. The broth in the pork belly was super light and very salty. The pork was done reallly well- perfectly crisp skin. I tried my friends Khao soi and the broth was more full bodied and rich and even paired better with the coconut rice.All in all I was a little disappointed however I am willing to go again and try something else with that 5 star coconut rice,2,1,1,Achiaa P.,"New York, NY",227,171,664

All the meat I've eaten so far were tender, soft and well marinated on the inside, and crispy on the outside. These dishes aren't cooked traditionally and that's a good thing if you're adventurous. You'll notice other Asian flavors and influences with every bite. The cocktails are great too and pack a punch.I really love the vibe of the restaurant.

4.0,8/31/2018,"Make a reservation! This place is busy on the weekends for brunch. Came with a few friends and we shared the Grilled Pork Jowl, Sizzling Sisig, Longonissa Sausage, and a side of fried rice. The jowl was tender and I really liked the combination with crispy brussel sprouts. Towards the bottom of the dish, it did start to get a little salty. The sisig was pretty good; the meat was crispy and it paired well with the runny egg. Towards the end, it did start to get a little too spicy. The sausages were tasty but not worth the price. The fried rice was good and the fried garlic on top really made the dish.I also got the bottomless mimosas for $16. The flavors seemed promising: lychee, peach, mango, and orange. I was so excited to try them all but was disappointed when I realized they all tasted the same. None had any fruit flavor; they all tasted like really strong prosecco. However, if you're looking to leave tipsy, these mimosas will do the job!Overall, the entrees were tasty but on the smaller side and I wish the mimosas actually had some fruit flavor.

2.0,8/31/2018,"Disclaimer: This is my first yelp review, and I am only writing this because I felt like the urge to share this and I only hope I had read reviews like this before I went to Pig & Khao.After hearing good things about Pig & Khao and seeing it featured on several food vlogs, I was very excited to come try. First impression: the restaurant was hot, and I mean EXTREMELY hot. It was 90 degrees out, but I kid you not, it felt like it was over 100 in the restaurant. I suspect this is due to broken AC and having an open kitchen (cool concept, not so cool for the customers). I could tell the table next to me was visibly upset about the temperature as they kept using the menu as fan to cool off. It was an uncomfortable place to eat to say the least. Another thing, the restaurant was EXTREMELY loud, and we were having conversation through yelling over the table (of two). This did not bother me as much, as I suspect this was probably the atmosphere they were going for. I hate to sound like an unhappy soul who has nothing good to say about this restaurant (spoiler alert, the good part is coming) but I have to mention that ever since we sat down, I've noticed several fruit flies hovering around our table and the next. Needless to say, i was slightly disappointed and somewhat disgusted. Despite everything I've mentioned so far, the food was somewhat enjoyable. We ordered three entrees: the grilled baby octopus, which I would recommend. Although expecting the octopus to be slightly more crispier, the sauce they used was super flavorful.   If you are interested in coming to Pig & Khao, you've definitely already seen people posting pictures of sizzling sigg (arguably their most popular dish) I will not deny It is a good looking dish, but I'd give it 2.5/5 for the taste. A lot of the pork were burnt, and I was not about to eat all that carcinogen. The last dish we got was the Khao Soi, another popular dish. It was not bad, but it literally tasted just like any massaman curry I get at any thai restaurant except served with noodles. Frankly, it reminded me so much of the Japanese curry  cup noodle (you can get on amazon for $2 each) I've had since childhood. Overall, the dining experience was not the best with the extremely hot temperature, loud noises, and fruit flies. It is fair to say I will NOT be returning to Pig and Khao, and good for them for not having to deal with another annoying picky eater.",0,0,0,Jeremy C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0

The food here is good but the prices are comparable to fancy places in the city and I'm not sure if I agree with that. I had the kha soi. It was good and spicy. And filling. Also tried the buns on the side which were really good and at a good value. The sizzling sisig looked good. I'm not a sisig fan but my friends enjoyed eating it.

4.0,8/25/2018,"Asian fusion food is always a delight and Pig and Khao executed it amazingly. The spicy flavors of the Chili Pan Mee we're perfect with the ramen noodles. It was balanced with the sourness of the Green Papaya Salad and the familiar sweetness of the Brioche French Toast. I also tried the sizzling Sisig which was very tasty, although a bit salty, so it is perfect with a small bowl of rice! The mimosas were also great; although I did not get the bottomless mimosa option, it no doubt is a good investment :) If anything, the food options were a bit more on the expensive side for the amount you get.

2.0,8/25/2018,"Let me preface this review by saying the food here was quite good. This review is about the service.We ordered a sisig and a khao soi. After the sisig was dropped off, our server didn't stop by our table ONCE without us flagging her down.We sat for more than half an hour waiting for the khao soi, with empty cups of water.In that time, we flagged down two other servers to check on our order, to no avail. Finally we managed to flag our server, and out came the khao soi 40 min after our order. This khao soi was delivered by a different server and without a word of apology. The kitchen later sent out a complimentary dessert, again with a different server but no actual apology.Paying the check took around 10 minutes too, as she gazed past my outstretched arm with the bill. At this point I didn't even know whether to be upset anymore - did I piss her off in a past life or something?People make mistakes and forget to put in orders, it happens.

5.0,8/22/2018,"This place is so delicious that it pains me to know we don't have one in LA. I came with some friends for their bottomless brunch on Saturday and was not disappointed. When you order bottomless, you get an entire pitcher to go through at your own pace, which is great because one of my biggest pet peeves is waiting for someone to refill my glass and therefore getting to the bottom of my glass (yes, yes, first world problems I know). And they have different flavors you can cycle through, which is another bonus. But now to the food: we had the ban kheo which was SOOOO good. It was a thick, fried crepe, stuffed with shrimp, bacon, bean sprouts, etc, and is very heavy. We shared this and everything else between the three of us. Then, we had the khao soi and green papaya salad.

My friend was emailing back and forth several days because it took an entire day to receive a response. When we got there, they apparently didn't make the reservations with names. They just put it under ""party of 8 at 6pm"" which I thought was unusual. When we got there, apparently they gave it away to another group but we were lucky enough to get a table. When I entered the restaurant, no one was there to seat me as I waited so I just walked in. The bar area is a bit narrow so as I was walking by, the server had bumped into me.

4.0,8/17/2018,"Attention spicy food lovers - I have the place for you! Pig and Khao is a spot with unique southeastern Asian dishes with bold flavors. For two of us, we shared four of the ""small plates"", and ended with a dessert. Personally, my like for the dishes ranged from enamored (khao soi) to ""I can only handle two bites"" (sizzling sisig), but the pros outweigh the cons and I'd go back for the dishes I loved. We started with the BABY OCTOPUS PAKSIW. My second favorite dish of the night. The baby octopus were served as whole cute lil' guys - weirdly my favorite way to eat them. They were in a acidic black vinegar sauce, and had pungent (in a good way) garlic chips. The octopi were tender, with crispy outsides! Up next was the THAI MUSHROOM SALAD. We ordered a salad in hopes of a lighter, green dish to balance out the heavier ones coming, but this didn't meat our expectations. For a salad, it was too heavy, and another dish would have been better in it's place. The best part were the shrimp, which added a lightness to the otherwise overly heavy salad. The SIZZLING SISIG was my least favorite dish of the night. After many Instagram searches, the boyfriend was set on this dish ahead of time. It was too heavy and fatty in my opinion. Served in a sizzling cast iron skit, diced up pieces of pork head render, and mix with a runny yolk. The pork was way too fatty to be enjoyable for me - but if that's you're thing, this is a great dish for you. Definitely something to SHARE with many, and could never be eaten on its own!But the ultimate star of the show was the KHAO SOI. Ramen noodles meet spicy curry meet all of my dreams. Another social media star, these chewy noodles are doused in a curry that burns with each bite you take (in a good way!) They're more than just ""hot"", but have a flavorful heat that excites you and makes you're nose run in every single bite. BEWARE, if you have a low heat tolerance, these are NOT for you. I could not get enough of these noodles, and they are the only reason I am dying to come back here. After the spicy noods, we were looking for a dessert to help us cool down, and settled on the TURON. Think eggrolls meet dessert. Four halves of a deep fried banana fritter in a thin and crispy coating reminiscent of your favorite Chinese snack, with a salted caramel ice cream to cool down the hot treats. If you're looking for authentic ethnic eats that you can't get just anywhere, P&K is the spot to check out. But be wary of what you order, and remember to ask your server how each dish fares. If you like spicy, the KHAO SOI is a must!! If you're a pork lover, the sising may be for you.",0,0,0,Rory M.,"Philadelphia, PA",127,372,1116

The coconut flavor gives the rice an almost dessert like quality, beautifully balancing sweet and savory components. No curry or meat needed.The noodles were the other standout dish.

They chop off the pieces and it's served on a hot plate with a fried egg. It was seasoned beautifully. Mushroom salad was also great. Had a lot of tom yum flavors.Fried chicken was also a favorite. I don't know how they get it to be CRISPY AND SAUCY at the same time. It was so wonderful.Pork trotters were also very very delicious. I was very happy with this dish. Fried and flavorful.Sirloin was okay. This one wasn't a standout. It wasn't that it was bad, but everything was just so much more amazing.Halo halo was a fun finish to the dinner as well.

This is one of the more filling Restaurant Week meals I've had, and I guarantee you will leave feeling extremely full. I think it's definitely worth checking out. -Grilled pork jowl (appetizer): essentially fried brussell sprouts with some pork. Super delicious and flavorful. There's not a ton of pork, but it's super tasty-Khao Soi (appetizer): a curry noodle. The portion size is really big for an app. I think this was the star of the meal for me. I typically don't love curry, but the curry flavor was just right and not overwhelming-Baby back ribs (entree): really delicious. Cooked very similarly to Chinese Hong Shao Rou. Very flavorful with a touch of sweetness. Finger-licking good-Coconut rice: while waiting for my friend at the table, I skimmed through Yelp reviews and one consistent message was that you HAVE to go the coconut rice. It's basically mango sticky rice minus the mango. I really enjoyed it, but nothing to rave home about - guys, it's rice-Turon: banana fritter.

Service was friendly and attentive. For dinner we ordered two small plates: the sizzling sisig and the pork belly adobo. The pork head meat in the sizzling sisig melted in my mouth. The chili added a nice subtle spice to complete the meat. The pork belly adobo was full of flavor from the soy sauce, vinegar, szechuan peppercorns, crispy garlic, slow poached egg. Oh did I mention the pork belly? Enough said. Both pork dishes were also beautifully composed. For dessert we ordered the halo halo. This was my first time trying ube ice cream and I really enjoyed it. We weren't able to eat that much of the halo halo because we were stuffed from all of the pork but it was a nice sweet compliment to the end of our meal.

I've eaten this food in south east asia and, while I understand that this was their take, it was incredibly disappointing. The papaya salad did not have enough lime juice in it. Adding chicken, which was barely edible, was not a good move. The mushrooms with chili sauce was also indelible - two bites and we said ""methinks not."" Couldn't taste the mushroom because of the amount of chili sauce. The prawns - again with chili - was ruined because of the raw chilli powder they put it in. The beef with basil is a standard dish in any roadside stall. Everyone makes it, and while it usually very spicy it is never fried to such a level that the oil comes out of the meat. In spite of the spice, it should be a delicate flavor. Not so here - they totally murdered this dish.

It was a little tight seating inside and it did get super hot- however all waitresses and waiters were on point and so professional and friendly! We will be back!!

4.0,7/31/2018,"Very authentic southeast Asian food! My boyfriend and I ordered green papaya salad, Khao soi, prawns, sizzling pig face and coconut rice, and we were really impressed by the quality of the food. My favorites are green papaya salad and Khao soi, which taste exactly the same as what I had in Chiang Mai, Thailand last summer. Coconut rice is also so yummy- taste like rice sunk in coconut milk. Sizzling pig face, however, is quite mundane and a bit oily. Prawns taste good, but there were only four prawns. The atmosphere, however, has room to improve. It was crowded, humid and hot. Not ideal for a hot summer night. Hence, if you want authentic southeast Asian food, definitely check this place out, but do get prepared for a less ideal eating atmosphere",1,1,1,Wenye X.,"New York, NY",315,113,255

1.0,7/30/2018,"While the food itself was great, albeit somewhat highly priced for the tiny portions for most dishes, the dining environment was extremely unpleasant. On a scorching hot summer day, I would expect the AC to be on or functional or at least having a few fans somewhere that can help cool the place down. The temperature inside was likely 85F+, making it impossible to enjoy any of the food. The kitchen is also right in the dining area, which doesn't help the the lack of air circulation. They need to focus on the overall dining experience, as opposed to just the food itself. While Southeast Asia sure is hot in the summer time, that's one aspect that they need not to emulate for an optimal dining experience.",0,0,0,Johnny S.,"Dallas, TX",51,32,0

5.0,7/26/2018,"There's something special about this place. You walk in, the aromas smack you in the face, and you know you've entered a culinary domain that will soon be exceeding your expectations.All the food sports Big flavors, bold ingredients and an authentic Filipino/Thai Asian feel.Decor/vibe:The location features a very hipster friendly (but not too hipster) atmosphere with the grill/kitchen jutting out into the dining area so you catch glimpses of your down being whipped up and sauteed.This place immediately catapulted itself into my fav spots list largely in part to the amazing music rocking overhead. From Kendrick to Chance the Rapper, to Ruff Ryders and popular top 40 hits (sprinkled in) this place stole my heart and tummy.Dishes:Corn Somtum was fresh, spicy, minty deliciousness to start off. Sis got the Green Papaya Salad and dam near licked the plate. I was scurred of the pork JowlPork Belly Adobo was fire. Pork was meaty yet still crispy on one side, and fatty dankness on the other. That broth that it sits in thoooooo!! I couldn't be consoled. Wife got the Crispy Noodle Veggie Wraps and was so surprised at how good it was, while I was blown away that wasn't beef all up in her dish (apparently Impossible meat is the truth for vegetarians). It came with lettuce wraps, not soy sushi wraps like we thought...still bangin.Baby back ribs flavor was off the charts and the bite I had of mussels was really great. We had it all with coconut rice, and after just returning from Belize (where they serve Coco rice with EVERYTHING) I gotta say this was the sweetest and best version over had in the US or anywhere else.Dessert: Halo-Halo is an acquired taste for most, but I enjoyed it.

5.0,7/22/2018,"Sarap!These guys seriously kill it. 3 cooks in a tiny kitchen who make better sisig than your Tita. We started with the sisig, rice and mantou buns. The sisig really is that good. Perfect seasoning with that nice crispness you look for. At that point I knew we had to order more. Right before we placed the order for the sirloin, the kitchen sent us pork belly adobo. When I say this adobo is perfect I'm not saying this because they graced us with free food. I'm saying it's that good bc I fought my husband for the fourth piece. One thing I'm not crazy about with Filipino food is that it tends to be over salted. This was so not the case. Again, they seasoned it perfectly. The sauce has so many flavors to it. You can tell they really put care into developing their own blend. The sirloin came out to a perfect temperature. Cabbage leaves along with a special spicy sauce blend accompanied it. I wanted to wrap myself inside with the sirloin. With two rounds of San Miguel and finishing with a Vietnamese iced coffee we were plenty full and completely satisfied. Can't speak for my Filipino man but I'd say this is the best Pinoy cooking outside of Manila. We will be back.",0,0,1,Joanna S.,"Montville, NJ",0,17,1

The malaysian fried chicken was good, but nothing to praise about. And the other dishes were just mediocre. My friend did enjoy the coconut rice. As for the halo halo,  the small brown cube (not sure what it is called) next to the flan was hard. I don't think it add any flavor to the dessert, but instead just brought down the dessert. The halo halo was big enough to be shared between 2-3 people. The music kept getting louder and louder as we were dining which was annoying. It was difficult to have a conversation without leaning in towards my friends. The restaurant has an open kitchen and caused the restaurant to be stuffy. At least where we were sitting was very stuffy. Our table was near the kitchen and bathroom in the back of the main room.

2.0,7/16/2018,"I've been wanting to try this place out for the longest time and finally got the chance to when a few friends and I gathered here for a going-away brunch session. Being that there was a 35 minute wait when my friends and I went on a Saturday afternoon, I had high expectations because of how crowded it was and the wait time. We were seated in the rear of the restaurant where it was dark and dingy. Upon glancing through the menu and taking recommendations off of Yelp, we ultimately decided on the sizzling sisig, grilled pork jowl, steak and eggs, brioche French toast and the chili pan mee. Sizzling sisig (3/5) This dish consisted of meat from the pig's head, chili and a sunny side up egg. Like everything else served in this restaurant, this dish was extremely salty. The meat practically melted in my mouth and the chili added a nice kick to everything. I still would not really recommend it though.Grilled pork jowl (3/5) Complemented with roasted Brussels sprouts, there were also thinly slices of cured pork belly. Brussels sprouts were a little on the bitter side for me, but overall, this dish was more flavorful than the sizzling sisig in my opinion. Steak and eggs (4/5) steak was tender, juicy and flavorful. I'd recommend breaking the egg yolk apart and drizzling it on top of the steak. The sauce provided also provided a nice sour flavor. Briche French toast (3/5) I'd recommend starting off with this and coating your stomach with something sweet to prepare for the overload of sodium later on. The toast had a sponge cake like texture and was served with a light whipped cream. Chili pan mee (5/5) This best dish out of the 5 dishes that we ordered. The noodles had a hint of spiciness and was coated with some sort of thick sauce. There was a runny egg, spring onions and minced pork in the noodles. This dish reminded me of Jajangmyeon or noodles with black bean sauce popular in Korea and Taiwan. Definitely recommend this dish. The garlic fried rice that I ordered was extremely overhyped in my opinion. Maybe it was because the first time I had garlic fried rice over at Lure Fishbar, it was so decadent that they set the standard so high and no other garlic fried rice can compare. I'd definitely recommend ordering it regardless because of the saltiness of the dishes. Overall, I will not be coming back here. There are a lot of legitimate Filipino places over in Queens on Roosevelt Avenue. The best places are the hole-in-the-wall places that no one knows about. Not somewhere where they serve unlimited mimosas and is filled with millennials and hipsters. Also, I do not understand what's the deal with ""fusion"" places.

I was surprised to see that not even 15-minutes later the entire place was completely full. That's when I knew this was going to be a good meal!My boyfriend opted to get the ribs and I ordered khao soi which was red curry, coconut milk, chicken, egg noodles, pickled mustard greens, and red onions. My boyfriend LOOOOVES his ribs and stated that these were one of the best he has ever had but my dish stole the show. Honestly, my dish was so good I was debating getting a second one and he kept picking off of my dish. I was like get lost buddy!It was suuuuuper delicious! Given that we only had dinner a few hours after we had lunch we only ordered those 2 dishes. I would say definitely that is not enough.

Sometimes it's a miss cause they could make it too sweet. But it was perfect amount of sweet. We finished every bit.I feel like it could've used some more noodles cause there was barely any of it. It had a perfect little spicy kick to it. Try this over some rice ! Green papaya salad. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment. Maybe because I'm comparing it to authentic Thai papaya salad but it wasn't spicy at all and it didn't taste like what papaya salad normally tastes like. I'm not sure what it was. Lol.I'm not sure if it's an option but maybe try asking it spicy and it'll taste better?Grilled pork jowl -$14brussel sprouts, toasted rice, lime-chili fish sauce, herbs.

The ribs tasted like something out of my girls moms recipe book. I swear they used the same  Chinese char siu cooking sauce because it was really similar. The sisig was aiight.

DO NOT MISS OUT ON THE COCONUT RICE. I honestly could eat a bowl of this on its own--creamy, slightly sticky, and sooo fragrant. It went well with the sisig (deliciously seasoned) and the adobo (kind of different from what I was expecting, but SO GOOD). Let me just add--the adobo was insanely tasty...the meat so tender but the top layer absolutely crispy.For dessert, I split a halo halo with my friend--perfect cool treat for a hot day.

1.0,7/1/2018,"Poorly Imagined Fusion I personally love fusion. I think that chefs that look beyond their native backgrounds for interesting ingredients or cooking techniques are worth applauding, and the results can be absolutely astounding. One need not look further than Anand Gaggan or Jean-Georges to see the ways in which well applied culinary fusion can elevate your food. Pig and Khao however, executes fusion in quite possibly the worst way that I've ever seen. The owner, who is half Vietnamese, has spent substantial time in Southeast Asia honing her culinary technique. However, instead of emphasizing the native elements of Filipino or Vietnamese cuisine, she combines the two in a way that absolutely destroys and inherent quality they had in the first place. The longanisa sausages that I had were drowned in fish sauce and lemon, and the garlic rice tasted like someone had added a few dashes of garlic powder to Panda Express. This dishes tasted nothing like their Filipino classics, and were incredibly disappointing. The problem with Pig and Khao comes from the poor recipes. The head chef simply has an obsession with acidity and fish sauce, which are both Vietnamese staples. However, when I ordered the Pig Jowl it was literally seasoned with just lemon. There was no salt, no pepper, nothing that could have emphasized the value of the Pig Jowl itself. This kind of surface level fusion that produces terribly food, each bit was a confused mess. Overall, if you have any appreciation for Vietnamese or Filipino food I would not recommend coming here.

1.0,6/27/2018,"The first few times I went to Pig and Khao, I loved it. The flavors were fresh and interesting, true to their Southeastern roots with a slightly fusion take on it. The dishes were reasonably price and I was obsessed with their Sisig.However, the last time I went I had one of the worst service experiences in a very long time. We ordered two appetizers and two entrees. The appetizers came out after about 30 minutes, which was tolerable, but we ended up waiting an HOUR after that for the first entree. After that, we asked several different waiters where the second entree was, each saying he would look into it and then never returning. At this point, the service was starting to ruin our entire dinner experience. After waiting ANOTHER 30 minutes after our first entree came out, we told the server that if the dish wasn't ready we wanted to just cancel it, as at this point we had been at the restaurant for over 2 hours and were still quite hungry. TBH, it seems that they totally forgot about the order and despite multiple requests to check on its status nobody actually did. 15 minutes later, they said that the dish was ready and could not be cancelled... at this point, we were so frustrated we couldn't even really enjoy the food, and no offer was made to comp any of the late dishes.Honestly, this makes me sad because I do enjoy the food, but the service really ruined the experience. I had taken my brother who was visiting from out of town hoping to show him what the NY culinary scene had to offer but instead was more embarrassed and disappointed than anything else. I definitely would not recommend dining here after this experience as there are just so many other amazing restaurants in NY, especially in the LES.

4.0,6/24/2018,I came here for boozy lunch. I love how the hours are extended til 4pm compared to other bottomless spots. There are 4 different mimosa flavors but the mango was probably my favorite. The food portions are small and difficult to share but surprisingly filling. It was my first time trying sisig and it was good! I would skip out on the garlic rice because it's nothing special. The drinks are strong. I felt a buzz after my 3rd cup. The staff is friendly. The bathroom line takes forever so good luck.,2,1,1,So P.,"Queens, NY",62,104,935

1.0,6/21/2018,"Pig & Khao...sheesh...even a pig or a cow would have provided better service than the loser we experienced tonight (you know who you are).I live literally 100 ft from this pig pen, I have been on a few occasions, and have even (made the mistake of) giving it to friends as a recommendation in the past. That ends after tonight.So we get frickin seated, me and my gf, and waitress waddles over, fills up my glass with water, doesn't fill up my gf's. Also never returns to do so. Smh...When she returns to take the order (glass still empty) we ask her for a recommendation- something nice and soft, lo mein-esque, as my gf still has stitches in her mouth from wisdom teet extraction. Tells us she has the perfect dish for us, and points us to some noodle bowl thing. Cool. She will have that, and I'll have the baby octopus, thx.Octopus appears 10 mins later, but like the gentlepig that I am, I wait for my gf's noodles to arrive. 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes go by...nothing, no sign of these n00ds. Octopusses super cold at this point, and ur boy is getting testy...smh. PUSS COLD, ANGER BROILING!!Finally, she appears, sans food. I say ""hey, uhh, where are these noods ur supposed to get to me? My shits goin cold"". ""It's family style betch"" he snorts back (this might have been good to know when we distinctly ordered very different dishes due to the lack of teeths in the mouths).The noods appear (30 minutes later (spongebob voice)), and they're like crisped up frickin frito noodles - wtf?! Obv not something a person with two cavities in place of molars can eat (u frickin idiot). At this point, the puss stanks, it's cold, you know how that is - yikes. Send that shit back naturally. Also, not overjoyed with the frickin tortilla noods, so when waitress trots back over with bill (which we didn't ask for, she just brought it lol) and I saw it was still on there, I told her that I wasn't inclined to pay for it. I recounted our previous conversation - the one about the teets - which she squealed she remembered. I then asked, ""why would you recommend this to someone who has no teets?!"" This is when she really started to pull my pork - she told me I was being abrasive and that this was just how it was. Grrrrrr I was ready to get up and leave, but bless her, my teetless gf stayed and pulled out her card. I said ""No"".Just before we could dine and dash, the managinger hooved over, and made a moo sound. ""Mooo."" She then said that they would comp the meal - well done you shining star, good customer service!! NOT SO FAST...she then went on to tell us how the loser!!! waitress was crying bc of what I had said to her, that they had already made so0o0 many accommodations for us, and that it's not ok for us to berate her staff...Lmao if you read all this, unless ur that loser waitress who cried when (I guess for once) someone held you accountable for being absolutely pigshit at ur job. And managinger, fire this loser before u lose ur job over this kinda stuff.

I made reservations the morning of for 6:30PM on a Monday. The place does fill up quickly so I'd recommend making a reservation just in case.This restaurant opened my mind to COCONUT RICE!! A must order to go along with any dish you get. We ordered two bowls of coconut rice, two bowls of jasmine rice, pork belly adobo, khao soi, hainanese duck, and finished it off by sharing one halo halo because we were so stuffed but the halo halo was huge and definitely meant for sharing.My favorite dish was definitely the pork belly adobo, I don't know why but the meat just melted in my mouth and the sauce was perfect--pair it with the coconut rice. Next is the khao soi, it's a little spicy but packed with flavour! It goes really well with the coconut or jasmine rice. The duck was a tad underwhelming for me but maybe because I was so blown away by the previous two dishes and started to feel full. This place is packed with tons of flavorful dishes, I would 100% come back to try the other dishes (and for that coconut rice lol)!

It takes like your typical coffee from a Vietnamese restaurant. Garlic Fried Rice - YES PLEASE. Just the right amount of seasoning and garlic in the rice. Delicious!Grilled Pork Jowl - A perfect balance of different flavors. The bitterness from the charred brussel sprouts balance out tanginess from the lime-chili fish sauce. I wished they used pork belly instead of pork jowl because of the greater fat to meat ratio. None of the less, it was very good and I totally recommend this.Khao Soi - The curry sauce had me at the first sip... It was spicy, tangy, sweet, but all perfectly proportioned that it left me wanting more.

The staff was not friendly and seemed as if they did not want to be there. Service was terrible. Slow is an understatement. We were a party of 5. After what felt like forever, two members of our party got their dishes (they ordered the same item). We waited for the rest of the plates to come out, but after like five to ten minutes, we had to start as it was getting cold fast. The next set of two dishes came out (again same entree items) maybe another ten minutes later. It was a long break and we saw no sight of the last dish. It took a while to flag our server down. They never checked in to see how we were doing and would often disappear. We asked about our last dish and they assured us that it was coming. Based on what we saw, they cooked bulk in batches. They cooked all orders of one entree at a time and then moved on to the next entree, not based on table orders which was why dishes came out at sporadic times. There was a long wait before the last dish got to our table - the people who got their meals first were finished eating. Overall, service was terrible - if you want to go, your whole table better order the same dish and hope it's not last in their cooking lineup. The food did not make the experience any better. My longanisa was burnt and cooked to death. The seasoning wasn't good and it was super dry. The garlic rice did not have much garlic flavor. To be honest, all the times I've had longanisa at home, it's been better and this is from supermarket frozen longanisa. I can't cook and even my garlic rice is more flavorful. The unlimited mimosas is a good deal but service is slow. The unlimited beer is self-service so you don't have to wait, but the keg ran out during our time there and was not replaced, so that's probably worse.

But it's not real; it is a strong coconut forward flavor with red curry, not Indian curry like it should be. There was almost no curry and it was mostly egg noodle. The spice was strong and fun but the flavor was lacking. The Malaysian fried chicken sounded good after watching Ugly Delicious' fried chicken episode. But it was just bad, KFC fried chicken with some sugar glaze. No flavor.

Also they don't force everyone at the table to do the bottomless which was really nice for me (since I couldn't drink that day!). The garlic rice was DELICIOUS!!! Also the place, although small, was really nice and cozy!",2,1,1,Archana W.,"New York, NY",527,85,59

Then again because of the Thai fusion, that could be where they lost me.I came here for a dinner with a girlfriend. Paired cocktails with three entrees and just couldn't find the right one that tickles my fancy. The flavors are so strong that I really had to drink water to make up for it.

Our waitress recommended very nice drinks and we ordered just the right amount of food. Two small dishes, papaya salad and pork belly. One main dish, Crispy pork leg to share. I loved the pork belly, it was crispy on the edge so soft on the inside, perfect to pair with rice. I had the coconut rice and my friend had the jasmine rice. I thought my coconut rice was a bit too sweet, we both did not finish the rice and it was $3 each. The ambiance/music was a bit too loud. Ill definitely come back and try more dishes:)",0,0,0,Lulu M.,"New York, NY",182,40,3
2.0,4/19/2018,"I rarely give 2 stars, but I was extremely disappointed after leaving here. Not because of the service, the ambience, or the wait. Those were all great. It was because of the food. Now that I reflect, I only took about 10 bites and lost my appetite (I'm not exaggerating either). I had such high hopes from all of the reviews. All of my friends agreed with me as well. Maybe it was an off day for the chef. Either way, I haven't left a restaurant in NYC feeling this way in over a year. The only dish that I found tasty was the pork belly adobo... which costs $14 for 4 pieces of pork belly and an egg. I might as well go to an authentic restaurant and order pork adobo there. I would probably get 4x the portion for the same price with better taste. Everything else tasted WAYYY too off balanced. The khao soi was spicy but that's all I tasted. Just sour spice with no true flavor. The baby octupus was okay but somewhat bitter. I took one spoonful of the sizzling sisig and I lost my appetite as that just tasted like straight sodium. Im the type who finishes everything even when the food doesnt taste that good!!!We tried most of their most popular small dishes:Khao SoiBaby OctupusSizzling SisigPork Belly Adobo Each dish was $14+ with no rice included. Rice on the side costs $3 extra. I got the coconut rice which was way too sweet so I didn't finish that either. Seriously overpriced as our check was $80+tip for four small dishes with the portion to feed one teenager.I just don't get how this place is rated 4/5.

The food came out quickly and the server was attentive. My disappointment lies with the front of the house, who were not welcoming. I got there early and planned to grab a drink but when I came in, no one was up front and no one came over to greet me or direct me where to go. I sat down at an open seat at the bar and nobody came over until 10 minutes later when a server told me I was in the wrong place and this was the chefs bar that needs to be booked in advance. He led me to the right place but it was kind of embarrassing. Later on in the evening, I went to use the bathroom and could not find it and was pointed in wrong direction down the stairs, which ended up being the kitchen. Leah, the chef, started yelling at me. I practically ran back up the stairs where I had to ask again where the bathroom was and found it but it wasn't marked clearly and kind of hidden. The experience of being treated that way definitely tainted what was overall a delicious evening.",1,2,0,Cass M.,"Manhattan, NY",20,8,0
5.0,4/15/2018,"Five stars go straight to the adobo pork belly. The pork belly was cooked to perfection. Skin on the outside is crispy while the fat just melts in your mouth. The adobo was also extremely flavorful, but what differentiates it from other adobo is it has an interesting sweet after taste to it. We also had the halo halo, which was good too! I feel like the leche flan was a bit too hard for my taste. Don't get me wrong, it was good but I thought the flan could have been more tender.The employees are friendly and the ambiance is poppin.

5.0,4/11/2018,"4.5! Rounded up to 5 for great service.The dishes here are served family style and they recommend getting about 3 dishes per 2 people. My fiancé and I ordered 3 dishes, a bowl of coconut rice and a dessert. We were stuffed and had leftovers! The star of the show was definitely the Pork Jowl with Brussels sprouts. Think of it like.. fatty bacon strips with Brussels sprouts in a zesty sauce. It's damn good. Must get if you visit! It's a good sign that every table has that dish and everyone's nodding in unison. Next up with was the pork belly adobo. I've never had pork adobo with a crispy skin, but it had a great bite to it. Dipping it in the poached egg and pairing it with the coconut rice is a genius idea. Delish. I was really excited for the final dish; sisig. (Pig face) it's a personal favorite and I always order it when I have Filipino food. Unfortunately, the sisig here was way too salty. Even the rice couldn't save it. I packed this to go and will reheat with other ingredients to dial the salt down a couple notches. Overall, the flavors are all on point but on the loud side. Make sure you pair your meal with rice and a beer to balance the flavors a bit or else you'll be drinking a lot of water. I'll be back to try more items from the menu!

5.0,4/10/2018,"Step into Pig and Khao's Lower East Side establishment and get ready to experience an uber hip and all around delicious restaurant. As soon as I entered the restaurant to check in for my reservation on a Friday night (highly recommend reservations FYI), I noted the fun hip hop music playing and a young and cool crowd dining there. All the servers there were also so helpful and nice. Pig and Khao focuses on Southeast Asian cuisine, like Thai and Filipino, and the dishes that are served are more fun to share than enjoy alone (plus variety is always fun). My husband and I split 3 dishes and a side of coconut rice. I'm not one to rant about rice, so I'll keep it short, but their coconut rice is the BOMB. I could have happily made a meal off of just the rice alone. Definitely get some as a side!First came our Baby Octopus Paksiw. This was probably my favorite of the small plates we got. The octopus wasn't overly cooked, while the legs were still crispy. Other tables around us also had the octopus, so it must be a popular dish. We also got the Sizzling Sisig (pork head, chili, egg) which definitely came out sizzling and was tasty. The Bun Bo Nam Bo (lemongrass, beef, rice noodles, herbs, peanuts) was probably our least exciting dish, although that doesn't mean it wasn't good. It's just more on the safe side if you aren't looking to branch out with more adventurous dishes. My cocktail was so good, I couldn't resist ordering a second.

Even though my coming here was way overdue I am super glad I came. We got there pretty much at the beginning of dinner service. That smell hits you and you instantly feel like you made the right choice. We ordered beef jowels and sisig with a side of coconut rice to share and also shared the roast half duck entree. The sisig was delicious. Add some lemon and the perfect mix of fatty, spicy, crispy, and citrusy sits before you. Mix that with some rice and you're good to go. The jowels were also good (although not equally.) The Brussel sprouts had nice caramelization to them and the dish had a pleasant citrus punch but the star of the dish wasn't front and center. On to the entree. The duck was pretty bomb. The breast was cooked perfectly and the dark meat was crispy on the edges and juicy inside. The sauce it is served with is great, and so is that crispy rice round. It is like the best part of the rice at the bottom of the pan (we call it pegado/pegao.) The dipping sauces were also good, but I feel the duck was able to stand on its own. So clearly the food was good. Add a friendly staff and hip hop, and you can count me in for a return visit.

I mean, when you've had authentic, tasty Asian food in Chinatown and Flushing, you really can't justify paying $26 for a plate of crispy pork.That being said, the food here is delicious. I love Southeast Asian flavors, the spicy and the sour, the salty and the sweet, and the mixture of textures is pleasing to the palate. A crunch for every munch ; )The dish I will definitely be back for is the Bum Bo Nam Bo. This bowl of rice noodles and beef with lemongrass and peanuts has me drooling in my dreams. My friend and I hadn't even finished dinner when we looked at each other and decided to come back, but next time to each get our own portion of that and share some other small plates!The Crispy Pata is the one I have mixed feelings about. Yes, the skin is fried to perfection, but the pork leg itself was drier than I expected, and while the two side sauces and papaya salad salvaged that a little, it wasn't enough to eliminate the automatic cost benefit deduction.Go and enjoy, but be prepared to spend a bit more for the fusion than you're used to for the Asian.",4,3,2,Audrey L.,"Steinway, Queens, NY",199,103,374

My friend was 20 minutes late so I naturally waited for her until I ordered anything. Upon ordering bottomless mimosas we were told that the 2 hour limit started as soon as I walked in the door. Note that the waiter also happily took another 10 minutes to get to our table once she sat down. So we really only had a 90 minute bottomless.

It was literally just two of us. We're not going to drag the place down with our drunk ness. As we were finishing up our meal we asked for another round at 1:20P (we got there at 12p) and it took him until 1:40P to get us our drinks when he said it would be our last round because they had other reservations!!! He also gave us our check before he even got around to getting us our last drinks and asked us if we could pay as soon as possible.

The baby back ribs were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The only issue I had with anything is that the shan noodles tasted like there were just drenched in vinegar.

4.0,2/22/2018,"Hey yo. So I decided to come back here after over 2 years and can say that I had a slightly better eating experience than last time. I take back what I said in my previous review, as Filipino food has become one of my recent favorite cuisines. The interesting detail that I notice about the cuisine is that each establishment has its own take on staple dishes. The chefs af Pig and Khao make their dishes more on the salty side (where my salttooths at?).The restaurant is in the LES, so the crowd there is more on the hip side (y'all know what I mean). There are standard seating options, but I decided to sit at the bar as I noticed that the seats there were in front of the open kitchen (definitely took some good mental notes).What I ordered:1.  Malaysian Butter Prawns - topped with pork(?) floss2. Crispy Pata (fried pig legs) - pretty fatty, but pretty darn crispy. This also comes with soy sauce and a paté sauce that was pretty bomb3. Choy Sum (market vegetable) - tossed with some chili flakes4. Coconut riceIf I were to critique the dishes, I think they need some balance with the salitness - the dipping sauces for the pata and the coconut rice helped, but sweetness can provide some depth to the overall flavor profiles. Maybe I ordered too many of the same flavored dishes, but I would want to try to pork jowl if I were to come back.",2,0,1,Jerry T.,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",267,59,169
2.0,2/20/2018,"I had really high hopes after reading so many positive reviews and having other people recommend pig and khao to me, but after going for brunch I was left pretty disappointed.  Our table ordered a bunch of different dishes share, and out of the 5 of us 4 didn't finish our meal.  The chili pan mee was probably the best dish out of the 5, but still didn't have a 'wow' factor.  I'd say it was tasty but one note.  The grilled pork jowl was underseasoned and mushy - no one wanted to eat it.  The sizzling corned beef hash was dry by the time it got to our table.  Maybe I'll try this place again for dinner but I wouldn't recommend for brunch based off of my experience.",0,0,0,Mia S.,"New York, NY",7,62,28

4.0,2/10/2018,"We did Restaurant Week for dinner here on a Thursday evening. Overall, we were pleasantly surprised by how flavorful the food was and were pretty satisfied by the selections on the menu. Walking in, the place seemed pretty small, but there is a whole large back room with extra tables. The restaurant had a very cozy, hip, underground vibe with the brick walls and candles.We started out with the green papaya salad - it was a pretty decent refreshing papaya salad, although not the best I've ever had. For the second course, we got the Khao soi and pork belly adobo. The Khao soi was delicious, probably my favorite dish of the whole evening. I really enjoyed the texture of the egg noodle with the curry sauce. The pork belly was also pretty good, flavorful and hearty with a runny egg, although it was a bit dry.For the third course, we got the baby back ribs and cod in banana leaf. The ribs were delicious! More juicy than the pork belly and with a flavorful tangy and sweet sauce. Also, make sure to get the coconut rice! It was a great complement to the ribs. Unfortunately, the cod tasted a bit strange, with a very strong sour anchovy taste. Flavor is definitely not for everybody.I ended with the halo halo, which was a mix of crunchy, icy condensed milk and this purple ice cream (no clue what the flavor was supposed to be). Every Asian cuisine has a version of this shaved ice dessert, and was not let down by Pig and Khao's version. What a perfect, sweet ending to our meal!",0,0,1,Cindy L.,"Pittsburgh, PA",166,24,110

Made the 5:30 dinner reservation thru Opentable and upon our arrival, we were greeted warmly by our server. The place was packed yet, had a positive, energetic vibe to it. We had a 5-course meal during Restaurant Week and each dish were as creative, tasty & diverse as can be. 1st course: GREEN PAPAYA SALAD- light, refreshing, tangy... loved it! GRILLED PORK JOWL- Brussels sprouts with tiny pork, lime-chili and fish sauce. Flavors were fantastic! Thumbs up for me! One of my favorites. BURMESE EGGPLANT SALAD- not impressed. Lackluster, boring. Couldn't figure out the taste. Thumbs down! 2nd course: PORK BELLY ADOBO- too salty; balanced with some sweetness rubbed off some of the saltiness. Loved the crunchy bite of the fatty pork skin though. Nice visual presentation.KHAO SOI- curry coconutty flavor with a kick; very filling.3rd course: PORK BABY BACK RIBS- delicious, tender, salty-sweet blend. Thumbs up!COD IN BANANA LEAF- Did not like it all. Thumbs down. Underwhelming cod meat was on the dry side for me.

4.0,2/5/2018,"My boyfriend's from the Philippines and he wanted me to try some Filipino food, so we came here for their Restaurant Week Brunch Menu yesterday afternoon. It was a 3 course menu for $29 per person. Here's what we had:Garlic Fried Rice Green Papaya Salad (reg. $14) - Pickled papaya salad with grilled chicken slices topped with peanuts. I'm accustomed to having papaya salads sour and spicy, but this was more sour and savory. It was still good though.Grilled Pork Jowl (reg. $14) - Crispy brussel sprouts with fatty pork jowl. I preferred this over the Green Papaya Salad though there were a lot more brussel sprouts than the pork jowl. Sizzling Sisig (reg. $16) - This was made with parts of the pig head and liver, and seasoned with lime. I have never eaten such parts from a pig so I tried not to think about how disgusting that could be while eating. It was delicious I had to say, but greasy. I have a thing with greasy food such that I get sick of them after eating a certain amount so I couldn't have finished this whole dish alone. It was a pretty big portion which could be shared among 2-3 people.  Sizzling Corned Beef Hash (reg. $15) - House-made corned beef with potatoes. I preferred the Sizzling Sisig over this, there wasn't anything particularly interesting about this dish but it was as greasy as the Sisig, and it had the same portion size too. Champorado (reg. $8) - I was told this rice pudding is normally a breakfast food in the Philippines. The bacon bits were an interesting addition to a traditionally sweet dish. Enjoyed the extra crunch and flavor to it.Brioche French Toast (reg. $13) - We initially ordered two Champorados but we were told they ran out so we were offered the French Toast which came with banana and was topped with whipped coconut cream. It was a pretty big portion and we struggled to finish this, but the French Toast was soft, perfectly moist, and yummy.Overall, service was excellent and we had a great lunch here. We didn't have breakfast before coming, so we came here super hungry around 3pm. But, we ended up with a food coma after pigging out on all three courses. Although it wasn't cheap, the Restaurant Week Brunch Menu was definitely worth the ~$35 (with tip & tax). It was a heavy meal and we were so full that we didn't have dinner later that evening :)",1,0,1,Lily L.,"Manhattan, NY",107,7,28
4.0,2/5/2018,"Heads up, I came here for restaurant week.I heard some really good things about Pig and Khao so I knew I had to check it out.  The perfect opportunity came up during restaurant week when my partner and I needed a date night.  We went on a Thursday night and I was a little late for our reservation but I got a text from my partner saying this place is ""hip"" and that she was in the back.  It was busy at 7pm but all the tables weren't full so it was okay that I was 10 mins late.  The menu looked awesome and I was excited to eat!  They normally have a $45 five course chef tasting menu but replaced it with the $42 restaurant week menu. We got:**BANGKOK FIRE for our first round of cocktailsGREEN PAPAYA SALAD to start for both**KHAO SOI 2nd course, great spice MUSSELS 2nd course for my partner **BBQ BABY BACK RIBS for my entree - YAS!COD IN BANANA LEAF for my partner**COCONUT RICE for my partnerJASMINE RICE for meTURON for bothSTINKY PEAT for my partner's second round of cocktails**THE BIG APPLE for my second round of cocktails I starred everything that you must try if you come for restaurant week.  The cocktails are excellent and well crafted.  Not too sweet and just enough alcohol that you can taste it without being too strong.  The Khao Soi is really good but has a lot of crunchy noodles on top of the regular noodles.  It gives the dish a nice crunch but was really hoping to have more noodles and broth.  It also has a little kick to it so if you don't like spicy, this may not be the dish for you. Luckily I love spice and smoke and this went perfect with the Bangkok Fire.  Every table seemed to have ordered the bbq ribs so I didn't want to miss out.  These were very good and would definitely recommend ordering for the table.  They come right off the bone and are delicious with a little coconut rice.  Don't even waste your time with the jasmine rice.  I love jasmine rice but the coconut rice is where it's at.  Excellent flavor!  To end the meal, the turon was really good.  I mean how can you beat salted caramel ice cream and chocolate? You basically can't.  It wins all around.  But, the Halo-Halo looked really good and since we didn't get to try it, I am not sure which one is better.  My partner is trying to be healthy so she got more of the (ahem) boring items. The mussels were good in a flavorful broth but they were still mussels. You can pretty much get them anywhere.  The cod was okay but my partner kept thinking she was biting into little bones.  Not sure what was going on there, but I don't think she loved it and the small bite I had was okay.  Now for the service... The staff was very friendly however we sat next to a couple that sat down well after us but was ordering similar plates as us.  Every time an order was up, we would think the food was coming to our table (since we ordered first) but it went to their table.  Then they waited like no time for their dessert and the waiter was like I am so sorry for the wait, and brought them an extra dessert.  We waited a good 18 minutes for our dessert and no one even said a word.  We didn't really care because it was date night and we were sippin on some fire cocktails but still.  I did tip 20% because I enjoyed myself and had some good food and good company but they need to tighten up their game a bit.

The place is pretty dark but you can still clearly see all the cool graffiti paintings on the wall. We went for the regular menu instead of restaurant week one. The Green Papaya Salad is okay, nothing impressive. However, their Sizzling Sisig and Crispy Pata are amazing! I highly recommend these two dishes as they are signature Phillipino food and they did a good job making it here. I didn't really like the Pork Adobo because it's too salty to eat without rice. For dessert, you have to get the Halo Halo. It's simple yet very refreshing and not too sweet. Turon is another famous dessert (banana fritter) but I don't eat bananas so...We paid ~$40-ish each and honestly, it's a bit pricey for this kind of restaurant.

3.0,2/2/2018,"we've wanted to come here for a long time and on a whim decided to eat dinner here. we didn't realize they participated in restaurant week so we had decided to do that since it offered a good sampling of the menu without spending too much. small plates: there are two rounds of appetizers offered per meal and they give a pretty nice portion. the first round we got the green papaya salad and the grilled pork jowl. the salad in my opinion is way too acidic. a few bites here and there is good but a whole plate can easily get overwhelming. the pork jowl is delicious. its basically fried brussel sprouts with pork belly. for the second round, we got the pork belly adobo and mussels. the pork belly is tender with crispy skin. it comes with a poached egg and i think we were supposed to break it into the sauce but we just slurped the egg off the spoon. the mussels are a special which is delicious. pour the broth over rice before they take the bowl away and don't forget about the little sausage bits at the bottom of the bowl. entrees: now before we decided whether to do restaurant week or not, our waitress informed us that normally their plates are family style and for restaurant week the portion size is scaled back a little bit. needless to say we were pretty disappointed with what we got. after two decent sized appetizers we were given 3 bbq baby back ribs and a sad sliver of cod (also a special). not sure if they tried to make up the lack of portion size with the appetizers but thats not something id look forward to. i'd prefer smaller appetizers and a larger entree. anyway both were fine. the cod has a coconut sauce on top and the ribs were tender. dessert: halo halo of course can't go wrong with ice, ube ice cream and other toppings. the turon is good (and i don't even like bananas). great service despite being the only customers seated in their heated outdoor space. all the waiters were attentive and welcoming. their food has a ton of different flavors you normally don't find often but for us, we won't be coming back for a while.",0,0,0,A H.,"New York, NY",2,112,154

Didn't check up on us much and the food wasn't served all at once. Sisig took another 20 minutes after all the other dishes were served so we didn't eat till it came.Quality of the food was overall satisfying. However, a side of longanisa was basically 2 pieces cut in half at $3 an order. It tasted more like nam rather than traditional longanisa. It had more of a sour/pickled taste rather than the usual sweet or spicy flavor. Sisig was right on. Savory and texture was done right. Papaya salad is different from the traditional style but in a good way. The taro was a great addition. Best meal was probably the jowl which was a great balance between sweet, savory and spicy. Steak and eggs was cooked perfectly and the sauce elevated the dish. Drinks were strong and mediocre on quality.",1,0,0,Jason G.,"Queens, NY",111,262,688

It's a unique kick to Thai/Filipino cuisine, but I don't really see the hype. The portions were smaller than expected and although the flavor isn't something I experience regularly, I would have liked a little more 'sustenance' to it.Three of us shared the grilled pineapple salad (very sweet but didn't have more than 3 shrimps in it), the sizzling sisig (flavorful at first but got tiring), and a rice dish that I now can't recall.

4.0,1/25/2018,"Excellent spot for a bottomless brunch, managing to offer solid mimosas with yummy food. Most of the time when I go for a boozy brunch I feel like I have to sacrifice the food element, but here you don't have to compromise!Love that they offer different flavors of mimosas including lychee and mango. They also have bottomless beer option but you have to serve yourself from the back of the restaurant which makes it a much less attractive option. I'm not sure why they don't just fill up a pitcher of beer for you the same way they do with mimosasFood here isn't your typical brunch food, and leans a bit more towards the heaviness of lunch. I love that the menu go beyond the realm of classic brunch foods (i.e. eggs benedict) and offers something unique. Also the dishes feel more like they're meant for sharing than as individual brunch dishes which is what we ended up doing. We tried:Khao Soi - Creamy and a tad spicy. It was fine but I couldn't help comparing it to the version I had at SriPraPhai which I enjoyed more. Sigsig - Yummy (if not very healthy). The pork is tender and flavorful and the flavors seep into the egg as well. Would have been too heavy for me to eat by myself but liked trying it.Banh Xeo - Came recommended by the waitress and tbh was the first thing that caught my eye on the menu, but I didn't see many people mention it, so was ready to pass it up for some of the more popular options until I heard the waitress's recommendations. I'm super glad she did because this was my favorite dish of the brunch. I've never actually had an authentic vietnamese version before so can't say how authentic it is, but on its own merits it's a yummy dish. The crepe is crispy but still a bit chewy inside and the shrimp was juicy and flavorful.

2.0,1/22/2018,"I had gone today based on a raving recommendation from a friend, and unfortunately, I'm not impressed - it seems that the food represented was more Malaysian than Filipino, and the Filipino representations were a bit lackluster.As a Filipino-American born and raised in the SF Bay Area and have eaten Filipino food all my life, I have always felt that Filipino-fusion food would either be hit or miss. It is hard to impress me when I can easily conjure up a lifetime catalogue of different Filipino cuisines and compare and contrast notes of other ""better"" flavors I've had in the past.I understand that Pig and Khao is not trying to be authentic by any means (hence the ""fusion""), but the flavors for their ""Filipino"" dishes felt lackluster and one-dimensional, as if the Filipino aspects of their food was just an afterthought, something thrown in at the last minute as an interesting oddity to accompany the already semi-typical Malaysian dish.Tonight, we ordered the Khao Soi, Crispy Pata and the Ricotta Donuts. The Khao Soi was good, but there was no interesting edge to the dish beyond it tasting like typical Malaysian flavors; The Crispy Pata was very disappointing - aside from the fact that they achieved the texture that reminded me of lechon, the flavors were very flat - it seemed as if it were only seasoned with S&P and Thai chilis. The sauces didn't help it much, as the sauce flavors were still one dimensional. The point of Filipino food (or even to capture the essence) is to bring in a bunch of seemingly contrasting flavors to create a unique, 3-dimensional taste-bud explosion that you've never had before. This did not wow me at all. The saving grace to this dinner was actually the Ricotta Donuts - The kalamansi custard was very impressive and complemented the rich and fragile texture of the donuts very well. If this restaurant was being marketed as a Pan-Asian fusion restaurant, I would probably give it a higher rating. However, since it's being marketed as a Filipino-Malaysian fusion restaurant, I have to be a bit more critical than usual.I highly doubt that I'll ever visit this place again - I felt that the effort was there, but please give your Filipino food a better representation than what you actually have now...",0,0,0,Karen M.,"West New York, NJ",4,47,3

Make sure to use the lime will make a difference in the soup!!Pork Belly Adobo- the pork belly was a little too crispy for my liking, my first bite felt like I bit into rock but the bigger pieces were a tad better. The poached egg and soy sauce/vinegar definitely complemented the dish well. The egg and sauce helped soften the crunchy texture of the meat and the vinegar cut out the over saltiness that soy sauce can be.

The khao soi was deep with flavor. There was a slight hiccup with our order. The garlic rice came out with the khao soi but somehow our pork jowl never got fired. After eating the khao soi and sitting around for 10 minutes I asked the waiter, who took our order, if our other dish was coming out. He said he would check on it. Saw him tell the kitchen about 5 minutes later to fire the pork jowl. By the time we got it our garlic rice was cold which was sad because it was meant to be eaten with the pork which was salty. The garlic rice was really tasty though, full of garlic flavor and the sticky rice was cooked perfectly. The pork jowl should really be called brussel sprouts because it was all sprouts with a few piece of thin slices of jowl. Our jowl had absolutely no meat, it was all collagen, still tasty though.

I had a seat at the bar and was able to watch the magic and chaos happen. If you try anything at all, get the sizzling Sisig and khao soi with coconut rice, it is a flavor bomb that you will not regret. The savory rich flavors had me shedding a single happy tear. On the flip side, I wasn't wowed by the octopus nor the prawns. They were good but very average in presentation and flavor for the price so I would recommend skipping that.

This is known as a Asian fusion restaurant between Thai and Filipino, but it really is primarily Filipino. My Filipino friend during the dinner said that everything was traditional Filipino food and quite authentic (besides the papaya salad that is).We ordered the Khao Soi ($16), Sizzling Sisig ($15), Green Papaya Salad ($14), and Halo-Halo ($8). All were quite good; however my highlight was the Khao Soi. Red curry and fried egg noodles is a great combination I haven't had before and my friend practically licked the bowl clean it was so good. Special mention to the halo-halo for dessert though, an interesting twist on Taiwanese shaved ice for me with flan, crispy rice, coconut, and ice cream mixed in.Meal Value (from 1-10, my measure of quantity/quality of the meal compared to price): 8.5Great portions for the price and everything was delicious.

4.0,12/13/2017,"Let it be known that when I crave Filipino food, my personal preference would be down-home cooking, and I would eat in the neighborhood joints in Queens, or my own cooking. (Mostly, my own cooking.)I tried three dishes in Pig and Khao - the baby octopus paksiw, the duck and the sisig. First, let's do the paksiw. My initial expectation of a paksiw is raw fish cooked in vinegar (ah, my mistake - fish cooked in vinegar is kinilaw) and now that I think about it, paksiw is fish stewed in vinegar and garlic and ginger. For someone who doesnt know what paksiw is (or got confused between kinilaw and paksiw), the dish is quite good. Me? I just got caught in the web of confusion and disconnect. There is nothing bad about this - This is all in my head. The sisig, is very good. There are hints of lemongrass that kinda confused me to have it in this dish, but it paired very well. If I need to take people to eat sisig, this can be my Manhattan spot.The duck? It's also good. Go get it.

5.0,12/10/2017,"Pig and Khao is a great example of a cool fusion spot that you've had on your list, but maybe haven't tried yet. It's worth the hype. I've been dying to check out this place for brunch (and hope to still!). I ended up finally paying a visit for their little-known tasting menu. The menu is at a pretty good steal, $45/person. There's not a separate tasting menu, but you get a taste of some things on the menu (and some surprises). It was delicious and ample amounts of food. The set up was more family style verses individual plates. We received a total of five courses plus dessert. Separately, I ordered their Vietnamese coffee with a shot of rum added. It was delicious (not normally with rum, fyi). First course was the duck roll. It was a nice burst of flavor, really tasty and a perfect amuse-bouche. Our second course was the papaya salad. I've seen this dish on Thai menus for years, but have never tried it. It was light and refreshing. The third course was my favorite (oh hey butter ), the Malaysian Butter Prawns. The sauce was incredible, with a nice bread crumb coating. Between the two of us, we had about 2-3 prawns per person! Fourth course was pad see ew with beef. It was another great dish, and was also nice to get different types of protein with each meal (I would assume you could get this menu vegetarian friendly upon request). Fifth course was a noodle soup. The broth was really unique, almost sour. I can't recall the meat in this dish, but it was perfectly cooked. Dessert was a frozen rice pudding-like dish with ice cream. It tasted like cereal milk, and according to my friend, was similar to a dish in the Dominican. We both left very very full (we had to take course five home!). The interior was open and larger than expected. Staff was very attentive.

It's like serving clam chowder and charging for the crackers. I got the bottomless mimosas and they were good! I would've given this place 5 stars if they served rice with their meat dishes and if they had the option to make the dishes spicier, like how most Thai restaurants serve food with 5 levels of spice.

I wasn't so familiar with popular Filipino dishes so I asked him (sorry forgot his name) for recommendations. We got a sizzling sisig (one of their most popular dishes) and a spicy ramen (forgot the name). The Sizzling Sisig is definitely a must try. It is loaded with flavor and so tasty. Must eat with rice or it'll be too salty. The spicy ramen was okay - not my favorite. But that's because I'm not a big fan of my ramen being super spicy - not their fault.Before entering the restaurant- I was craving Viet coffee and I was contemplating to just get viet versus Filipino. It was just my luck day because P&K had viet coffee as well. Best of both worlds. Only con I would say is that the dishes took a long time to be served.

It's nice and sweet and different from any other coconut rice I have tried, but that night it tasted like every other coconut rice and nothing special.  Same for the short ribs and the sisig. It was not up to their regular standards.  The piece of short ribs I had was so dry I felt like I could barely swallow it. The way I remember the short ribs is that it is usually moist and tender and falls right off the bones.  As far as the sisig, it was over cooked, and it was burnt and crunchy.  I don't know what was going on that night, but it definitely wasn't the same.  I hope they were just having a down day because I would hate to lose a good place to eat.",0,0,0,Eileen Z.,"New York, NY",232,123,326

You gotta mix the egg with the other ingredients to eat the dish. I loved eveything about it except the crispy anchovies, but it was something worth trying. Now let me tell you guys about the best dessert in that spot! Do not leave without trying the halo halo ice cream! It's a traditional Filipino dessert with ube ice cream, shaved ice, coconut strings, and everything else in between. This place adds a nice twist to the treat by adding pieces of flan, and there's a melted portion in the middle that tastes like condensed milk which is one of the best parts.

3.0,9/27/2017,"Almost every type of Asian food at this restaurant from your choice of Thai, Filipino and Viet. The food was okay with lots of flavor, but the service made the whole dining experience not so stellar. I came here for brunch the other day and we were very excited to try everything, but when we were ordering we named 2 dishes that were only served at dinner (pork belly adobo and coconut rice). The waiter realized they gave us the dinner menu -____- My friend had been here before and was really looking forward to the coconut rice. There aren't THAT many differences between the brunch and dinner menus, but 2/6 dishes we wanted were on the dinner menu. Anyways, we switch up our order. no biggieWhat made our dining experience a 3* was the fact that they forgot our last dish.. the sisig. When we asked about the sisig, they told us it was coming out soon. The sisig ended up coming out  20 minutes after we had finished all our other dishes. There seemed to be a lack of communication with the wait staff and kitchen. The busboys even cleared away our table and dishes thinking we were done even though we were still waiting on our last dish. The waiter could have been honest and told us it was forgotten and allow us to cancel the order because by the time the sisig came out we weren't really hungry anymore and were tired of waiting. Anyways, here are my thoughts about the dishes.. -Khao soi: thai red curry with chicken and egg noodles had a good rich flavor, but the noodles weren't still kind of hard-Pork Jowl: By far my favorite dish. Sliced pieces of pork with well seasoned and grilled brussel sprouts. This was on point with sooo much good flavors. -Papaya salad: this was okay, the papaya was chopped/shredded to thin and the sauce wasn't as sour as I like it. I did like the crispy taro pieces which added a nice crunch since the papaya was chopped very thin. -Sizzling Corned Beef hash: corned beef hash served with a raw egg. It didn't taste like anything special, the corned beef could have had more flavor and more moisture. -Garlic Rice: Okay as well. The rice wasn't too garlic-y which was good. Tasted like a fried rice. -Sizzling Sisig: pork head with raw egg on a hot plate. There was a lot of cartilage or soft bone in this which i didn't particularly like. The flavor was okay..not worth the extra 20 minute wait.",2,0,0,Christie L.,"Medford, MA",317,245,711

3.0,9/19/2017,Came here with my boyfriend who had come here before for his friend's birthday party. The place was small and intimate. The food sounded very delicious on the menu but in reality the portions were small and they made it too fancy. They made typical cheap street food dishes in Thailand into an expensive dish using fancy ingredients. Tasted delicious but I wouldn't pay that much to eat street food style food. The khao soi (curry noodle soup) was delicious.I think the place would be fun to come with a bigger group of people to celebrate a special event because the dishes were shareable and the cocktails were innovative and tasty.,0,1,0,Alice A.,"Brooklyn, NY",180,43,53

I still can't get over khao soi (or any thai food) costing more than a buck (yeah yeah typical foodie snobbery--""when I lived in Bangkok""--sorry), much less 15+ dollars but at least it was delish.

Having personally made and grown up around people who make filipino food on the daily, I know a platter of crispy pata shouldn't cost close to over $20. The lumpia serving was SO tiny for what it cost I couldn't believe it. Maybe I just have a problem with ""higher end"" filipino restaurants because I'm so used to the authentic Mom & Pop vibe, but there are way better places to eat at for a fraction of what you'll pay here.Don't get me wrong, the food was really god! Just didn't feel it was worth what we paid.If you're in a business meeting or on a date with someone you're very serious about and would like to impress them, this is a great spot.

We ordered 3 dishes and I can tell that it was prepared as an asian fusion (Filipino, thai, etc) rather than as authentic dish which for me is good.

3.0,9/6/2017,"2.5 - Had a reservation for 7:30 on a Tuesday night but it wasn't necessary since the restaurant was pretty empty. I didn't have any expectations going in but after looking at their menu I was less than impressed. Does anyone ever get that panicked and awkward feeling when the server approaches a few times and you have no interest in anything on the menu? Their dishes didn't seem appetizing to me whatsoever. If it was up to me I'd up and leave but my friend from out of town wanted to try this place. We shared a few small plates and it was a good amount of food. The most enjoyable dish was the fried mantao buns. I wish they had condensed milk on the side though bc, childhood. Khao soi was good; we got a side of jasmine rice just so we could drench it with the curry base. Yes to extra carbs. (We should've gotten coconut rice!!!) Confused about the grilled pork jowl; it was just brussel sprouts, where's the pork or rice? Pork belly; eh. Too salty and hard to bite into. Sizzling sisig seemed to be a popular dish but my friend and I couldn't eat this. I took a couple of bites and I couldn't handle the soft and gooey texture of this. Also too salty. It didn't sit well with my taste buds. I probably guzzled down more tap water than the actual food itself. Thanks for making sure my water was constantly refilled without me having to ask! Meh.

3.0,8/28/2017,"Been wanting to try this place due to the enormous amount of great reviews, and because I rarely eat Filipino food, however it's not my first time eating Filipino food in the city. My experience wasn't all that great and I honestly didn't think the food was that great either. Environment: Coming here on a Saturday night with no reservations around 830pm, it was fairly packed, but we were seated immediately which is a plus. It's not a place where I would bring a first date, because it is so LOUD in there. Unless you don't want to hear your date talking all night then by all means come here! A good amount of seating and definitely a place where you can sit, grab a few drinks, and chill. Service: Our waiters were quite forgetful. We ordered two orders of coconut rice, had to remind them twice to bring another bowl since they only gave one. Asked for the check and that took awhile, because he forgot as well. Other than that, our waiter was helpful with explaining the portion size for the small plates versus the large and continuously came back to refill our water. Food: Menu is quite small and limited. Was sad to find out that garlic rice was only available for lunch, why?! Also was so sad that they don't even have lumpia as an appetizer on their dinner menu! WHAT! It's a Filipino classic. Also, I feel like for the portion you get with the dishes, it is quite pricey. Even $3 for white rice, like really? I only ordered two things on the menu and let me tell you how I feel about it. 1) Sizziling Sisig: With all the amazing photos and videos of this particular dish I really wanted to try it so I did. I wasn't too pleased to be honest. So so salty, and it tastes like one of a common Chinese meat dish called roast pork, so this dish wasn't special in any way to me. 2) Hald Hainese Duck: For $33, I would at least hope for the portion to be slightly bigger. It was very salty as well. It was a little undercooked for my liking. Nothing too special about it. I tried Filipino food before at Maharlika and for almost the same prices you get bigger portions and the food was better there. Don't think I'll be coming back here.",0,0,0,Amy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",275,109,303

4.0,8/25/2017,"I made reservations on OpenTable for a weekday night. Good thing I did because the restaurant was steadily full the entire time we were there. Pig and Khao's menu is made up of several Southeast Asian-inspired small and large dishes, making them easy to share. The five of us decided to share the following:-Grilled pork jowl-Pork belly adobo-Sizzling sisig-Khao soi-Crispy pata-Jasmine rice-Coconut rice-Halo haloEverything was delicious with the grilled pork jowl and sizzling sisig being my favorites of the night. I would skip the Jasmine rice and just order more coconut rice. I was disappointed to find out that they only serve their garlic fried rice during brunch. It would be nice to see both the garlic fried rice and coconut rice appear on both menus. One can only hope!  While the food was fantastic, service was not. We ended up staying for three hours not because we were caught up in conversation, but because food took forever to arrive. They did acknowledge the delay in food and gave us a complimentary bowl of Khao Soi to tide us over. Overall, Pig and Khao offers up some unique and tasty dishes. I would recommend ordering at least one dish per person (don't forget the rice!) and then sharing. I'm looking forward to coming back again and trying their other items.

My friend who lives in he city had never been, so I ""used up"" a valuable dinner slot to re visit pig and khao. Why? Because it's amazing. First of all- the pork jowl Brussels sprouts are hands down the best Brussels Sprouts I have ever eaten. Ohmygod. So flavorful. The coconut rice is the most coconutty rice I have ever eaten. Do yourself a favor and order extra. I also really, really enjoyed the Sisig as well as the Khao Soi. Those are my top 4 dishes, hands down. I also sampled chicharron, the pork belly and the sirloin. I mean, you really can't go wrong here. So delicious. Now- I hesitate to even mention his next part because even without it P&K would have been amazing. But, to add to the fun, you can also pay $15 for all you can drink beer for 90 minutes. They hand you a solo cup and you refill your glass as needed. No waiting for your busy server for a refill! It's a lager- so if you want a fancy cocktail or to make this a classy experience, forget these last few sentences. But if you want a party- go for the $15 beer deal.

Khao soi was delicious and loaded with a nice subtle heat and fresh citrus, making for a very smooth tasting bowl of goodness. It had my sinuses clearing out!!

5.0,8/3/2017,"This is my new favorite brunch. I'm not just going to throw that out there with no support. I have reasons:1. The most important reason: the food is goddamned delicious. Definitely get yourself at least one dish where you get to stir an egg into a bunch of meat and other things, like the sizzling sisig, the chili pan mee, or the corned beef hash. The better move would be to bring a few people, and get all three. I would also throw in the Khao Soi, the papaya salad, and some longanisa sausage. And some garlic fried rice to sop up any remaining sauces.*2. Their pricing structure on mimosas means it's always a party. It's $8 for one mimosa, and $15 for bottomless mimosas. You'd have to be a crazy person (or some sort of responsible adult) to have just one. And if your whole table is getting down, they'll keep the pitchers flowing. 3. The music, the vibe, and the service are always on point. Old school hip hop, a room full of people just trying to eat, drink, and be merry, and servers who have yet to fuck anything up, and will always bring you another pitcher of mimosas. Even after you paid the check. That's kind of all I need for a great brunch, because I'm a simple man. I guess I could use another bathroom in here because occasionally the line gets out of control. And maybe better friends who won't eat the rest of my chili pan mee while I'm waiting in line for the bathroom. But that's probably not on Pig & Khao. ____________*It should probably be said that this is clearly not a brunch for everyone.

4.0,8/1/2017,"Came here for restaurant week dinner and was not disappointed at all. The restaurant itself is a little bigger than expected, with a bunch of seating in the back. It's super super casual here, with dim lighting and super loud music. It doesn't seem too busy on Sundays as I was able to make a reservation only an hour before with no problem. Unfortuantlry, the entire table must order restaurant week if you want to do that - the 4 of us we're planning to get 3 RW menus and a duck for the table. I think they don't want people to mooch off of the others for RW but if you're gonna order a similarly priced item I don't see what the problem is...We got started with a papaya salad, a pineapple salad, and 2 pork jowls. The papaya salad here is one of the best I've ever had - so crunchy and sweet/salty/sour/ everything. The pineapple salad was super refreshing. I really enjoyed the pork Jowl with the Brussels sprouts. There wasn't much pork, but the Brussels sprouts were actually amazing - super flavorful. I don't usually eat Brussels sprouts and I hear horror stories about sprouts but these were the bomb.comNext we got a khao soi, a pork belly, and 2 mussels. The pork belly was AMAZING. Perfectly braised and super tender and flavorful, with a super crispy skin on top of that. It comes with a poached egg, and the sauce it was in was great to mix with the rice. I regret not getting 2 of these instead because it was that good. The khao soi was not as good as I thought it would be - the pictures looked amazing, and the combination of soft and crunchy noodles sounds so good. However, the crunchy noodles were more like crackers , and the sauce was not as flavorful as I thought it would be. The mussels were just okay as well - no idea why we opted for 2 of these. There was some sand in the broth. I did like the addition of the Chinese sausage, so I ended up eating a lot of that with the rice. Tl;dr - GET THE PORK BELLYafterwards we got 2 ribs and 2 code. The ribs come in 3 pieces per order, and they were super tender and flavorful. The cod in banana leaf was great! Perfectly cooked fish, with some sort of paste on top. The sauce was a little sweet. Overall both super strong dishes, and you can't go wrong with either. I really enjoyed the coconut rice here. It has the aroma of coconut, but also the subtle sweetness of the coconut as well. A lot of places I go only do the coconut aroma, but I loved the sweet rice. For dessert we got 2 halo halos and 2 turons. The halo halo is a much more impressive looking dish, with a lot of textures. It's recommend you Mix everything together, and I recommend this as well. This helps distribute the sweetness throughout each of the bites. The Turon is like this fried spring roll with some banana inside. Super crispy but great banana taste also. The ice cream it came with was great as wells.Overall one of the best Restaurant Week deals in the city because this is more like 4 courses, rather than the typical 3. All of the food options were great, and some of them were spectacular. Definitely take the time to come out and try the food here.",0,0,1,Kevin C.,"Queens, NY",234,140,1516

5.0,7/31/2017,"The food here is AMAZING! I've heard good things about Pig and Khao and I'm so glad I got have dinner here. We came with a large party and ordered dishes to share. The coconut rice is the best! It smells and tastes so good and I filled up way too much on the rice. Everything was delicious, but after the meal I felt that the food was generally pretty salty (especially the sisig). My favorite entree was definitely the duck. It was cooked to perfection and wasn't too fatty at all. The entree came with some rice cooked in duck fat and omg I think that was even better than the coconut rice. It's crispy and full of flavor. So sinful but SO worth it! The fried baos were savory and meh I could've done without that dish. The only thing that would make this place better is an additional bathroom! The line can get pretty long when there's only one bathroom for the entire restaurant.",2,0,0,Emily C.,"New York, NY",568,78,94
5.0,7/29/2017,"This is a spot I heard about before but never really got that chance to go. By the time I arrived it was a bit late but they were still very busy. I was greeted promptly but I was concerned there were no more seats available. In addition to tables they have counter top seating right near the cooking area. The space itself around the establishment seems to have a certain amount of seating but Lower East Side restaurants deliver on the taste and quality even when they have limited space.  The only thing that I really was not a fan of was being seated at the end of the counter space right next to the restroom. Lines people waiting and leaning near me was a bit awkward and distracting. The menu items include smalls plates and large plates that are inspired by both Filipino and Thai cuisine.  Chef Leah Cohen can be seen working the kitchen area and her dishes seem to have people coming back for more. My server was attentive in taking my order. Due to time constraints I was only able to order one small plate but got to try all the desserts.  The sizzling sisig with jasmine rice is a nice starter. The pork comes sizzling with an egg and seems to be one of their more popular dishes. For the most part I liked it. Some of the pork can be fatty but the taste with everything mixed together really came through. A I saw several orders go out before and after mine was brought over (remember I was seated right where they prepare the food).What originally caught my attention was when I saw a photo of their desserts. The Halo Halo is a popular Filipino dessert with shaved ice, flan and ube ice cream. Pig and Khao's version leave out the beans but the overall consensus is that their version of Halo Halo is still very refreshing with nice generous pieces of flan. The ube ice cream is something that you really can only find in Asian inspired establishments. The Ricotta doughnuts were brought over very warm and fresh. The calamansi custard that they give for dipping is a great complement and pairing.  Very highly recommended as long as you are not averse to doughnuts. The third dessert they offer is the Turon which consist of banana fritters and some dangerously addictive sea salt ice cream. The fritters arrived very hot. There was no possible way I could have just chosen one dessert. Overall the staff was very polite and accommodating and made my initial visit very pleasant and memorable. When one lone diner keeps ordering food the reactions vary depending on who is working. All the plates had great presentation (I don't post photos on Yelp due to people using them without my permission which is a shame) and were brought to me in a timely manner. I would like to one day come back to try their other plates.

I recommend coming with a small group to order several different items and share them all family-style.

3.0,7/15/2017,"My mistake for trying to be a fake hipster. I saw the videos on social media touting the off-menu pad thai pancakes and my imagination went wild with all the other off-menu possibilities, like drunken noodle french toast or pancit waffles...Anyway, I was visibly drooling with anticipation when I walked in at about 3:00 PM on a Saturday. Obviously I asked about the pad thai pancakes, and was told simply ""No. We don't have those anymore"" by a harassed looking server pouring orange juice into mimosa glasses probably for the table of wasted ladies screaming out the Thong Song in the corner. Luckily, there was no wait for two, so we were seated right away in a corner conveniently nestled between the bathroom and two tables who were determined to make Pig and Khao regret offering both bottmless mimosas and an easily accessible toilet. Beverages - Ordered an horchata iced coffee and a vietnamese coffee. Both were quite standard, and nothing mind blowing. Vietnamese coffee was akin to any you could get at any Asian cafe. The horchata iced coffee had a vaguely sour aftertaste - was this some sort of fusion of lime and coffee that I don't have the right culinary expertise to enjoy?Food - pretty good, although my verdict is that you could get dishes similar in taste and lower in price at other places. The garlic rice was tasty, reminiscent of Taiwanese sticky rice, but missing most of the salt and flavoring. That's not to diss the rice, since it's meant to be eaten with other food. I ordered the pork jowls and Brussels sprouts, which was an interesting combination. Salty, sweet, with a sour aftertaste, it complements the natural bitterness that made me hate nature's goose turds - I mean, Brussels sprouts - for decades. The khao soi was tasty, but also similar to yellow chicken curry dishes offered at Thai restaurants everywhere. So why the three stars? Basically, the service was abominable, the restaurant was smoky and hot, and worst of all, nobody could hear me complain because the place sounded like a club at midnight. Our waiter took our orders and recommended the rice to go with our meal, only for my pork jowls to arrive first and sit there for fifteen minutes while we waited for the accompanying garlic rice to arrive. I asked the waiter where the rice was, and he said he would get it immediately - then I watched him go to the computer at the entrance, type something in, and then emerge with our rice. Fifteen more minutes go by, at which point we decide that if the Khao Soi didn't arrive in five more minutes, we'd just ask for the check and leave. When we told this to the waiter, he went back to the computer and typed something in, and the khao soi arrived in about four minutes. Basically, it seems our waiter forgot half our order and had to keep going back to modify our tab. To make things worse, since we were seated next to the central cooking place, the smoke and fried chili in the air made it hard to talk and breathe - not that anyone could hear anything over the combined din of wailing drunk mimosa addicts and music. Plus, since we were next to the bathroom, the neverending line of people uncomfortably grabbing their mimosa-filled bladders and doing the I-really-need-to-go shimmy literally five inches from my food made it a rather unpleasant dining experience.Came for the hype, probably not coming back.",2,0,0,Wendy M.,"Silver Spring, MD",201,77,14

4.0,7/8/2017,"What you need to know: - A Southeast Asian restaurant that reinterprets popular dishes from several cuisines, namely Filipino, Thai and Vietnamese - Their brunch features ""bottomless mimosas"" for $15 with a 2 hour limit - Not a very large restaurant, so make reservations if you can - Accepts credit cards - The service was very good and our waiter recommended the top three items for usWhat we ordered: - Sizzling sisig price $16 - pig head, lots of chili and spices and sunnyside egg.  I went with my Filipino friend and she said the dish is not traditional in that it has a lot more spices in it.  We all liked this dish and appreciated the many crunchy bits and parts.  I have to say that it was a very salty dish that left me longing for water all day long. - Garlic rice $4 - the sisig did not come with rice, so you have to order it separately.  One bowl of garlic rice was enough for 3 people. It was very garlicky and tasty. - Khao soi $16 - northern Thai noodle dish in spicy red curry.  I loved the spicy kick of the curry but my friends thought it was too spicy for them.  The chicken was mainly dark meat and was very tender and juicy. - Banh xeo $15 - Vietnamese crepe with shrimp, bean sprouts, and bacon. First, I'm impressed that they even feature this dish as it's not very commonly offered. The crepe was  thicker than what I'm used to, but this allowed them to make it sizzling and crunchy, which is quite fantastic. While it was good, it's quite expensive for what it is. - Overall, Pig and Khao added their own fantastic spin on traditional dishes and that is worth applauding.

I ate at the bar and had a delicious (and filling) dinner of the peanuts and the pork jowl. The peanuts were absolutely delicious with deep flavors and a nice warm aroma to them. The pork jowl was right on-par with reviews I've read on it. Both were well cooked, full of flavor and a little out of the ordinary from what I'd normally select. So, it was a great little sampling of what this place has to offer. All in all, the meal came out to under $20, which is what shocked me the most. I thought it would be about $10 more, after having glanced at a few of the prices on my walk over. If I had any complaints about this place it would be that there was too much cilantro in the pork jowl. For most people it probably wouldn't be an issue.

It wasn't as packed so we were able to be seated once we stepped in. But around 8pm, the restaurant became crowded and people would wait for a table. We sat in front of the bar area where we were able to see the chefs cooking and all the food being made. It's a pretty cool and mesmerizing thing to look at and that's what I did most of the time. If you want to have an intimate conversation with your dinner partner, I recommend getting a table. We ordered the $45 prix fixe 5 course meal. To be honest, I don't think it was worth it to get. It was way too expensive for $45 and I would get individual dishes. For $45, you can order about 2-3 dishes per person. But when we came here, we only had 5 same dishes to share. Most of the food here is coconut based so I tasted a lot of coconut which is good! They even had coconut rice. Although it was sweet, it had an enticing taste that made you keep coming for more.

5.0,6/19/2017,"Since dining at Pig and Khao, I have made it a mission to seek out all of the Filipino restaurants in the city, because one simply does not walk into Mordor - ahem, I mean one simply cannot have too much sisig. Having tried such places as Jeepney, Ugly Kitchen, and Grill 21, my stance on PK has only solidified...it's probably the best Filipino restaurant in New York.Some will argue that with food so rich, it's hard to mess up the dish. There is some truth to that, but after sampling the same dish at multiple restaurants, the differences reveal themselves. In this case, I prefer PK's sisig because of the cut of meat they choose, which is exclusively pork head. Other restaurants will throw in some liver or pork jowl, but I prefer the pure crunch and fattiness of pork head. The heat of the chili and the gooeyness of the egg counterbalanced the juicy meat, and on a bed of jasmine or coconut rice there are few things as delicious.The other two dishes I had were the pork belly adobo and the khao soi, both of which shone in their own right. The pork belly was prepared in a fairly traditional Chinese manner, with soy sauce, vinegar, peppercorn, and garlic seasoning with a poached egg. I'll admit that I liked this dish almost as much as the sisig, but that may just be my appreciation of pork belly. The khao soi was also bursting with flavor, a Thai-inspired red curry with chicken, egg noodles, and mustard greens. A curry seems out of place on the menu in a Filipino restaurant, but PK thinks itself a modern Asian fusion restaurant, so don't be surprised to see Vietnamese and Malaysian dishes on offer as well.Beyond the small plates, PK has a solid drinks program with some Southeast Asian inspired cocktails as well as a few more traditional options. More importantly, the halo-halo is wonderful, a sweet balance of ube, flan, shaved ice, macapuno, and pinipig - definitely one of the more complex halo-halos out there.Pig and Khao stands out among the crowd of Filipino restaurants, not only because it's the only one of the big names outside of the East Village, but because of its delicious and vibrant flavors, but also for the cool hip vibe of the interior.

We also asked to be seated in their outside area which was much cooler in temperature and had individual chairs instead of benches. The drinks were quite strong yet balanced. Most of them were spicy, which complemented most of the dishes. We were advised to order the dishes all at once so that they would come out together to enjoy family style.  We instead ordered separately so that they would be hot as well as not having all the flavors meld together and taste the same.  Our server was ok with it and we had the grilled octopus (tender), pork belly with Brussels sprouts (light on the belly), prawns (crispy and briny), pork jowl (Our favorite based on the crispness and richness from the egg), sirloin  (surprisingly tender), and the hainanese duck (not really simple broth style).  The portion sizes are small but are good for sharing for no more than 4 people unless you make multiple orders. It is definitely prepared well and a great time.",1,0,0,Jay N.,"Long Grove, IL",40,494,215

4.0,5/30/2017,"We visited this place on a Sunday night around 7 pm without reservation, was immediately seated since it's just the 2 of us. The first impression - we didn't like the stench (oily cooking smell) coming from the kitchen as it is located within the dining area itself, hence we instantly knew that our clothes will stink after leaving this place. The ventilation isn't that great. Like most restaurants in NYC, due to the limited space, the tables are rather small and close to one another. They had to shift the tables to allow the booth seater in or out every time, regardless of how slim you are.It can get very noisy due to the crowd. You practically have to raise your voice at least one level for the person sitting opposite/beside you to hear during a conversation.We tried the following dishes since they were popular or highly recommended based on Yelp reviews:1) Sizzling Sisig - Pork head, chili, whole egg. Taste is not bad, however was expecting a bigger portion for this.2) Khao Soi - Red curry, coconut milk, chicken, egg noodles, pickled mustard greens, red onions. Taste is not bad as well, just like typical Asian curry, nothing special about it though.3) Halo-Halo - Shaved ice, leche flan, ube ice cream, macapuno, pinipig. This was okay, it had cereal topping, easily replicable on your own, feels that it is slightly overrated though.Overall, in our opinion, the price is rather expensive considering their portions because we had to pay $16 each for the Sizzling Sisig & Khao Soi, both portions are rather small, not really worth the value. Giving the same amount of money, you can have 3-4 dishes at another good restaurant, but instead you can only have 2 here!Price : 2-3 starsSpace / Ambience : 2-3 starsWaiter Service : 4 starsTaste of Food : 4 starsCleanliness : 4 starsSo, to sum this up, I'll give this place perhaps a 3.5 - 4 stars!",1,0,0,Jasmine P.,"New York, NY",50,19,71

We started off with the shrimp which was small - only about 4 pieces but were large pieces with this ground meat mixture. It was pretty tasty and the prawn was decently large. We also had the squid - decent size and the veggie that came with it was good as well, pork jowl, curry, sig sig and the duck. These four were all pretty good sizes for sharing and went great with the coconut and jasmine rice we ordered on the side.

4.0,5/26/2017,"Pig and Khao is an example where the sum of its parts results in an amazing meal. Looking back, there isn't a particular dish that makes me salivate but I DO want to go back for that  harmonious, delicious experience.We tried:1. the grilled pork jowl - if you are a lover of brussels sprouts, the lime-chili and fish sauce will steal your heart. This one rivals that of momofuku ssam, and has a nice char on the brussels sprouts. The pork was sadly a little soggy from all those jus, so I would order this for the brussels sprouts and not the pork.2. Khao Soi - a great harmony of red curry, coconut milk and red onions to create a rich, thick and creamy curry. 3. Sizzling Sisig - if you are looking for crispy pork, this is the dish to order! Bonus to mix in the egg yolk to coat the fatty pork in that creaminess.4. Bun Bo Nam Bo - in addition to its fun name, you can't go wrong with the lemongrass, herbs and peanuts combination! 5. Mantao buns - dense and soft buns that you can dip into condensed milk for that sugar kick. 6. Coconut rice - delicious! Pairs really well with all of the dishes above and a great base. I am knocking off a star because the music was BLARING throughout the meal. It's not often that I can't hear the people at my dinner table well. Also, the food sat a little heavier than I would have liked. But, like I said in the beginning, I would return!",6,6,8,Jenny P.,"Arlington, VA",231,723,753
5.0,5/26/2017,"The hype is real here. You will not be disappointed when you eat here.The sizzling sisig and the Khao soi are MUST HAVES! The sizzling sisig is bits of pork head with chili and a cracked egg on top. There is so much flavor and spice in this dish and I love that there is some extra texture with some crispy bits.The khao soi is a red curry with coconut milk, egg noodles, and chicken I believe. Everything just mixed so well together and had the perfect amount of flavor. Nothing too over the top or watered down, as some curries taste. Loved the egg noodles!One side of coconut rice was the perfect amount for these 2 entrees. Also, the halo halo dessert was SO GOOD. The flan, ube ice cream, and coconut shavings were all just the perfect cool and mildly sweet mixture to top off a flavorful and spicy dinner.

4.0,5/25/2017,"A fun and original place with a great atmosphere for a date! Drinks: The Big Apple cocktail was delicious and unexpected (quite spicy). Food: we shared a bunch of small plates. The padcakes, basically fried pad thai rolls, aren't on the menu and often sell out by 7; we asked and luckily they still had some, so we got them and they were extremely fun and delicious. Also loved the sirloin steak, which came with a delicious, flavorful dipping sauce. The green papaya salad was very tasty as well, if a little on the salty side, and I liked that it had chicken in it (though one piece of mine was a bit pink inside and grisly, so that's no good). I was not a fan of sisig, which my boyfriend had been looking forward to, but I don't like pork flavor much besides bacon. He admitted that the flavor wasn't too interesting beyond greasy pork. But it was good with the coconut rice, which is a must get. Finally, the khao soi was somewhat disappointing; we both love it when it's done well, but the flavor wasn't very complex, just salty and with one other flavor we couldn't identify that was a bit overpowering. Atmosphere: We sat outside on the patio which was nice except for a group of very rowdy finance bros next to us enjoying the unlimited draft beer.

5.0,5/24/2017,"Honestly one of the best meals I've had in recent memory! I met a friend here for dinner one rainy night, and the simpleness of the restaurant really floored me. There were some intricate pieces on the wall that I wasn't able to get a chance to really look at, but the restaurant was very low-key and I truly believe they let their food do the talking. Neither of us had been there before, so we spent a good amount of time on the menu, and eventually decided on the glass noodles, sizzling sisig dish and pork belly with Brussel sprouts. We didn't order any drinks, but according to the Instagram-famous bloggers next to us (didn't catch their name either... bummer, they said their whole meal was comped!! Would've loved to exchange information), their drinks were strong and very well made. Our food came out decently quickly, and all within a couple minutes of each other. We each got a small bowl of white rice as well.. Let me tell you, the sisig dish is as good as the other reviews say it is! It's served to you piping hot, sizzling and with a cracked egg on top that cooks as you watch it. Flavors were complex yet came together so nicely. Make use of the lime, it brings such a zing to the dish! The pork belly and glass noodles I'd say tie for second - the Brussel sprouts were so flavorful in the pork belly dish, I'm not even a pork belly fan and I really liked it in this context! The glass noodles were interesting, not quite soup but also not dry. This one was very special, with many textures I don't often experience and peanut sprinkling on top brought a crunch to the dish I wasn't expecting either. I'll definitely be back to have dinner again or brunch, it's in a not too busy area of LES which I appreciated and the environment was intimate and cozy.

4.0,5/21/2017,"Review #100One of my close friends was in the city and wanted to try Pig & Khao.  To be totally honest, the restaurant wasn't on my list, but I decided to listen to her and give it a try.  Taking this as even more proof that she's the smart one in our friendship.We made a reservation for 8:45 on a Wednesday and were seated immediately upon arrival, by the door on a nice spring night.  I know a lot of the reviews paint the service in a poor light but we didn't feel similarly; the host was super nice to us and our server, while not over-the-top friendly, was helpful in his recommendations, always around and available, and kept our water glasses full.  We were very happy with the level of service.Here's what we got.  Think that 3-4 small plates feeds 2 people (*we were stuffed after 3) - Green Papaya Salad ($14)charred chicken, green papaya, crispy taro, peanuts, herbs, fish sauce, lime juice^ Um, yum.  A little spicy, which I wish we would've known, as people who are not very familiar with Filipino cuisine, but DELICIOUS.  The chicken itself was a little underwhelming but everything else here worked perfectly.  Reasonable sized portion, but scarfed this down in like 10 seconds flat re: aforementioned deliciousness.  Coconut Rice ($3)^ Very sweet but helped balance out some of the spice in the meal.  Perfect sticky consistency.  Recommend if you don't do so well with heat and need something to balance it out.Khao Soi ($16)red curry, coconut milk, chicken, egg noodles, pickled mustard greens, red onions^ Yes, yes yes yes yes yes.  Fantastic.  Reasonably spicy, extremely flavorful (*dining partner stopped eating this about halfway through re: spice, so more for me I suppose!).  This was the dish that I thought about even a few days later.  Sizzling Sisig ($15)pork head, chili, whole egg^ I don't really get the hype here.  To me, this tasted like thick cut bacon.  There isn't anything wrong with that (*side note: if you don't like bacon, we can't be friends); I think we were expecting more from this dish given the rave reviews.  We enjoyed this but it wasn't the highlight of my evening.All in all, we thought that the meal was very reasonably priced for what we received, and we liked everything we ordered.  I would definitely go back to try other items on their menu (especially the dessert).",3,0,4,Jenn P.,"Manhattan, NY",285,134,933
4.0,5/19/2017,"Last night, I ventured into LES to ""food hop""...first spot was a total fail, they were only accepting cash at the moment...second spot was a semi fail since it wasn't any good...but our third spot, Pig and Khao came in for the win! As soon as you walk in, you're consumed by the aroma of yummy goodness!!I've never had Filipino food before but I can say the food was amazing. Both dishes we tried were rich and filling!! We shared the sizzling sisig which is different parts of the pig's head...didn't listen in on the details so I'd be open to just digging in!! It's all mental!! LOL  The pork comes with a raw egg on a sizzling plate that you mix up yourself and it cooks right before your very eyes! I thought this plate was very flavorful. I would definitely recommend ordering a side of rice to balance it out (I'm glad our waitress gave us the heads up!). We also had the pork belly adobo which was overpoweringly rich, super tender yet had a nice slight crunch to it!! Once again, the rice came in clutch!! The restaurant itself was a decent size, it was super busy but we were seated right away. Service was great, our waitress gave us great recommendations and frequently check up on us and refilled our glasses. The only downfall for this place is there's no air conditioning...I literally felt I was in the Philippines!! They should invest in some ceiling fans especially since the kitchen is open which kind of leaves you smelling like food.

The market vegetables were light, fresh-tasting, and sautéed.

You will still be able to find many dishes to enjoy.

When my friend happened to pass by her on the way back from the restroom and inquired about the pancakes, she responded curtly with ""I'm your server, I'll come to *your table* to answer any questions you have"". This was followed by a glare. And of course she never comes to our table. Five minutes later a man comes over and says that he'll actually be our server. As soon as we had paid our bill, the waitress rips across the room and immediately takes all of our drink glasses away. She doesn't do this for any of the other tables near us.The pad thai pancake itself wasn't even remotely like the one we had seen in the viral video - it was supposed to be at least 3 inches thick and absolutely stuffed with pad thai. What we received was a sad mess of pancake - it was the size of my palm, no more than one inch thick, and barely had anything that resembled pad thai in the middle.

5.0,4/29/2017,"The LES is not someplace I normally go, like ever, but the need to visit Pig and Khao was strong enough to drive me to head into the area. A small casual space with a larger room in the back.  It houses a small open air kitchen and gets a bit warm in the main dining room, so dress accordingly.  Our server was lovely, we started out with a couple of cocktails The Lower East Side and the Bangkok Fire.  Both were well crafted and included a punch of heat which was almost unexpected but quite enjoyable.We wanted to try it all so ordered 4 dishes from the Small Plates menu.  Let me start off by saying that small plates is not an accurate description as these items are quite hearty.  First up was the Grilled Pork Jowl which included Brussels sprouts, toasted rice, lime-chili, fish sauce and herbs; this dish had it all.  It was was succulent, it was tangy, it had great texture it really hit all the marks and not to mention that it was fabulous!  I've never had anything like it and have been dreaming about this one since I had it.From there we moved on to the Khao Soi which was red curry with coconut milk, chicken, egg noodles, pickled mustard greens and red onions.  It was spicy, but not over-powering with some great flavor.  I enjoyed this dish, but also felt this was the most typical dish we had and was something I feel like I've had before.The Pad Thai Pancake is only served during certain hours and we were lucky enough to grab one.  From the sound of it I wasn't feeling it, that is until I tasted it.  Pad Thai is encased in a pancake like batter and fried, don't knock it until you try it because it's unique and delicious.Our final dish was the Sizzling Sisig, chopped pork head and chili topped with a whole egg (be sure to mix it in once the plate arrives).  Another dish that hit it out of the park.  It was so decadent and delectable it was hard to stop eating it once you started,  It is a heavy dish, so one best to share with others.We also had an order of coconut rice to accompany the dishes and it was so yummy.Unfortunately we were too full to sample dessert, but Pig and Khao gave us a tantalizing and unbelievable culinary experience and it's worth heading back to the LES again.",4,0,4,Krista M.,"Kew Gardens, NY",353,719,289
3.0,4/28/2017,"I have been wanting to try Pig and Khao forever and finally got the chance to yesterday night!RESERVATIONS: Made reservations for 2 on a Thursday night at 6:30pm about a month in advance and had no issues.  The day of, the restaurant wasn't that packed so I'm sure a walk in would be ok.ATMOSPHERE: The inside is pretty small and narrow, dark with fairly loud hip hop music.  Very trendy and I could see this as a fun place to take a date or go out with friends.  There's a larger table in the back and then small tables for 1-2 people that are very close together.  There is also a bar area that faces the open kitchen.  You can see the chef cooking and everything.  The decor does remind me of Purethai cookhouse or other thai type restaurants where you have a bit of the Thai/Asian influence from a few decades ago with a slightly modern twist.  FOOD: Their famous off the menu item is their ""padcakes,"" which insider food made a special about.  Apparently they only serve them for dinner and could run out so I would ask before ordering.SISSIG - sizzling pork with a fried egg on top, the pieces were fairly crispy and reminded me of pork skin.  The dish was honestly only OK..it was a little on the heavy side with all the grease, but I guess that's what you get with fried pork and an egg on a skillet.COCONUT RICE - very good.  I don't even like coconut but this rice was good and helped to cut through the grease of the other dishes.JOWL - a little on the salty side (and believe me, I can eat very salty foods) but the brussell sprouts were pretty good.  The ""jowl"" pieces are thinly cut pork with about 2/3 fat and 1/3 meat.  Tender and pretty tasty.  This dish was also heavy and between the 2 of us we could barely finish.PADCAKES - $13 for 4-5 pieces, cut in little triangles.  It was OK...the pad thai noodles were overcooked and it was really spicy for me.  The bun part was good, it was like a crispy fried donut.  Overall though the flavor just wasn't there for me.Overall, atmosphere was definitely on point but the food was a little disappointing.  I guess Filipino food tends to be on the heavier/greasier side but I was hoping the flavors would blow me away.",4,3,3,Brittany T.,"Manhattan, NY",1379,808,1533

Way more than enough to share especially because the rice is filling.-pork belly adobo: one of my favorite filipino dishes!

Also comes with a soft boiled egg-sizzling sisig: pork head served on a sizzling plate with egg on top and you mix it all together to finish the cooking process! more gingery in flavor than I like, but still good to try-khao soi: milky coconut red curry with tender and moist pieces of chicken, all on a bed of egg noodles! I think my favorite dish of the night. I love coconut based curry, so this hit the perfect spot-coconut rice: slight stickiness to it, but not enough to be dessert-like.

The other dishes we tried were the Shan noodles (cilantro overload and definitely on the mild side), khao soi (red curry with noodles and crispy topping - just okay, I'd prefer to go to my usual thai restaurants to get that satisfying coconutty and spicy flavor), pork Jowl (pretty good, interesting flavor and actually enjoyed the Brussels sprouts) and the sizzling sisig (greasy, extra caramelized, wouldn't want more than a couple bites). We ordered rice but didn't end up having any of it. Lastly the halo halo was just underwhelming. The ice cream and shaved ice and flan just all melted together and had a really bland flavor. We ended up leaving about half of it. At the end of the day, there's nothing here I'd crave and absolutely want to go back for except the padcakes.",3,1,1,Anvita S.,"Manhattan, NY",403,286,788
4.0,4/26/2017,"I would say closer to 3.75 rounded up to 4 stars. I'm only upset because the portions were smaller than I had expected and I wanted more. So there! (But really though). We came for brunch on a reservation. I had been eyeing this place for the sizzling sisig plate ($16) and it did not disappoint - only that again, it was smaller than I had imagined it to be! Coconut rice was not offered on the brunch menu - so I went with the jasmine ($3), but they also have garlic fried rice and I would venture to try that on another occasion! My friend ordered the steak and eggs ($17) and my! That was a delicious (also small), plate of brunch food! On top of that - bottomless mimosas!!! (additional $15!). You know I had to sign myself up for that! They have your regular orange but also lychee, white peach, and mango! ALL delish! I believe white peach and mango were the favorites, but just try them all and tell me what you think! So by the time we're a few mimosas in and have pretty much finished our meal - both of us were still feeling slightly unsatisfied - this meal didn't hit the spot for us. It was delicious but - something was missing. And that is when we ordered the brioche french toast. HOLY CRAP. I didn't think I could enjoy such soggy goodness, but it was a syrupy delight and that put us where we wanted to be (with a few more mimosas of course). I wasn't ecstatic we had to order another course, but I was kind of happy we did. That's what I mean about the brunch portions! Overall - still glad to check this place off my list and will probably visit again with more realistic expectations of what I'm getting (aka really delicious, but maybe have a snack or something before or plan on a dessert after! Just being real!).",0,1,1,Deanna S.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",160,149,1264

The crispy pata was also amazing but had a rough time keeping up with jowl dish. It was my first time trying the halo halo not my favourite but it was good, a bit watery from the shaved ice but still rich. I would love to try it again and check out more of the menu.

5.0,4/18/2017,"YUM. This place gets a solid 5 stars!! My party ordered: -sisig-pork Jowl-khao soi-papaya salad -octopus-coconut rice -hainanese duck -halo halo dessert I LOVED the sisig and pork jowl. I combined these two with some coconut rice and the combo was divine. I was worried the sisig may be too salty (I'm notorious for disliking overly salty foods haha), but it was flavored JUST RIGHT! The pork jowl had bits of pork mixed in with the best brussel sprouts I've ever had in my life. Literally!! They tasted so fresh, and not drowned in oil or over cooked- it still tasted very much so healthy and fresh. These two dishes are a MUST. The khao Soi was new and interesting to me (it is a  noodle dish). It was surprisingly spicier than the papaya salad, but it wasn't an overbearing spicy... it had just the right amount of kick to it. Papaya salad- nothing too special. Party all enjoyed it but it didn't necessarily stand out to me. Hainanese duck- to be honest, I don't think I can judge this fairly because it was the last dish that had arrived and I was stuffed! It comes with two sauces on the side for you to dip. Very large portion. Halo halo dessert- just okay. Another Asian shaved ice with ube ice cream. We weren't as thrilled about this... probably because we had stuffed ourselves so much prior heheh The restaurant got quite busy, so make sure you make reservations!! It can also get a bit noisy, so be mindful of who you're taking here and for what occasion. Very casual restaurant :) I must also mention the mint cilantro drink. I only had a sip of it to try, but omgoodness!! I was so pleasantly surprised at the taste. The cilantro part was such an interesting ingredient to mix in, but it was perfect for the drink.

4.0,4/17/2017,"Been nagging the boyfriend to take me here whenever we were around the area. He finally fulfilled my dream after 5 months. Pig and Khao is a small, hipster restaurant tucked away in the busy city of New York. We came right when they opened for dinner and got seated immediately. Saw all the amazing pictures of the sizzling sisig on yelp so we couldn't resist ordering that. We also decided to go with the grilled pork jowl with brussel sprouts, toasted rice, lime-chili fish sauce, and herbs. The highlight of our dinner were the amazing brussel sprouts. Everything about the orgasmic vegetable were cooked to perfection. The sizzling sisig wasn't as impressive as it looked. It didn't have any special flavoring and I felt like I was eating regular stir fried pork belly. I don't know why but I decided to give the coconut rice a try even though I'm not a huge fan of coconut. I can see why coconut lovers would enjoy this but I definitely wouldn't order this again.Our server was nice and we had an average wait time for our food. I recently saw this place featured on InsiderFood on Facebook for their pancakes stuffed pad thai and would love to come back to try that and the rest of their menu.

With shell on, FYI), pork jowl (tender, tasty, and the brussels sprouts were so good!), khao soi (my favorite! Get with coconut rice. Size of an entree or enough to share), and the hainanese duck (tender and tasty, but we were so full by the time it came out that we just picked at it and brought the leftovers home).

4.0,4/13/2017,"I finally got a chance to try this place after having it bookmarked for almost two years. I made a reservation through open table on a Friday for 5:45pm and the restaurant was pretty empty at this time. It slowly started to get more and more crowded as it approached 6:30pm. They have an all you can drink, self serve, beer on tap special for $15 (on a mediocre beer but as my friend said ""beer is beer""). They give you a blue solo cup and you can drink as much as you want for an hour and a half. Now this deal applies to the entire table meaning the first person to start drinking is when the time starts. So even if your friend comes 30 minutes later, he only has an hour left to utilize the deal - which is still plenty of time to get tipsy, you'll just be extremely bloated. The coconut rice is what I recommend everyone and anyone who decides to come here. Prior to Pig & Khao, Sripraphai in Jackson Heights had my favorite coconut rice but Pig & Khao now reigns supreme for me in that department. The pork belly adobo was delicious, the khao soi was good, the sizzling sisig was a bit disappointing in my opinion because it was too dry; Marharlika & Ugly Kitchen makes it better. The halo halo was too runny for my taste but the ube ice cream itself was pretty bomb. I also had the cold coffee horchata which was pretty interesting, but not sure if it was worth the $6 that I was charged for. Would I come back? Yes only because my overall food, service, and experience was pretty on point.",1,1,2,Victoria X.,"New York, NY",579,617,577

Great old school hip hop sound track in the background. Restaurant also offers bottomless yuengling for 15 bucks. The owner is incredibly friendly and his wife is the chef. Take your friends and go!

We ordered the garlic fried rice and sizzling corned beef hash for the table. Three of us ordered the Khao Soi and one ordered the Sizzling Sisig. Everything was amazing! The Khao Soi was definitely my favorite, however. It was the perfect balance of spicy and had delicious hand pulled noodles - just like what I've had in Thailand! The ambiance is very relaxed.

Also, the garlic rice was delicious on the side.For drinks, they had bottomless mimosas ($15 for 2 hours) which were great, but a bit heavy on the champagne. My favorites were the lychee and white peach flavors. Service was attentive and they kept refilling our mimosa pitchers (we were a party of 12) for the whole 2 hours.

2.0,4/2/2017,"Everything is extremely salty to the extent I doubt if this is how Filipino cuisine should be. After checking with a few friends who have been there, I think I am now confident to conclude: yes it is toooooo salty than it is supposed to be.When we asked the waitress why they put too much salt in it, she said "" well, that's why we asked you guys to order rice"", very nice try, but no, oversalted food is not healthy.Burmese eggplant salad tastes like shrimp paste; pork belly adobo was way too fatty, greasy and salty; grilled pork jowl and khan soi, still too salty, nothing special.The only two things that are good: coconut water and the dessert halo-halo.Regardless of the top chef contestant Leah Cohen's reputation, I think ppl overrated this place, you know it is New York, ppl rave about things, but I only care about quality food, unfortunately i did not see it here.

It was good, but just that .. good. I've had more flavorful ones at other places, although it wasn't bad. The pork jowl was prepared with brussel sprouts, which I liked, however, it tasted a tad too salty for my taste. The saltiness might have been better if paired with a side of rice, but we opted out of it to get a true taste of the stand-alone dishes. The eggplant appetizer was pretty good, though, and served with shrimp chips on the side. That was a new one for me, which stood out more than the mains.

Cooked perfect.Khao Soi ($16): It tasted a lot like the asian peanut butter noodle, but the more you ate it, the better it got.

The diced pork was crispy and seasoned well.The pork belly adobo was a bit too salty for me. But it was rich and had a crispy texture. I liked the poached egg that it came with.The baby octopus had a salty yet slightly spicy flavour. It paired well with the veggies that it came with.The pork jowl comes with marinated Brussels sprouts. The sprouts were delicious and came out crispy. It was a bit too drenched in the sauce in my opinion, and the fish sauce marinade overpowered the natural flavours of the pork and Brussels sprouts.The green papaya salad was a refreshing contrast to the other salty dishes. The flavours were understated and I feel like it would have been much better if it came out before the other dishes as an appetiser.

The pork belly was also fantastic. The use of texture on all the dishes was amazing- there was truly an experience to eating in addition to the flavors. On a side note- I have a nut allergy and they were super on top of it!! With the open kitchen concept, I could hear them discussing it. It is small and a bit hot inside. That's the only thing that took away from our experience. Otherwise, awesome!!",0,0,0,Alison W.,"Cranford, NJ",2,22,2
5.0,2/15/2017,"Walked in at 7pm on Valentine's day without reservation, and was seated instantly at the chef's table. It's where all the cooking action is, but it's also really warm. How warm? The Valentine's day chocolate in my bag melted by the time we were finished with dinner. But that's okay because the food here was amazing. We ordered two small plates (Eggplant Salad & Sizzling Sisig) and one large plate (Hainanese Duck), as suggested by our server. It was more than enough, so we packed our leftovers to go. The Hainanese Duck is SO. DAMN. GOOD. My boyfriend is a master of the Hainanese chicken, so I knew what I was expecting. But the duck blew my mind away. It's juicy, crispy, sweet and savory at the same time. The meat is tender, easy to rip apart with your teeth (as we did). The duck comes with rice, which we devoured within minutes. It must have been fried in duck fat, because the outer layer of rice was brown and crispy, and the inside was soft and seasoned. And once again, it was bomb diggity. Please order this. The Eggplant Salad is more like eggplant dip. It's served with Asian shrimp chips, and you dip it like you would with tortilla chips and salsa. I ordered the Sizzling Sisig, because it was one of the more popular dishes on Yelp. Comes with egg cracked on top, and you mix it over the hot sizzling plate. Pork wasn't spectacular like the duck, but it was still delicious and fun to eat. I loved how the menu was short and simple. There was a handful of small and large plates, so choosing came easy. It's family style, so make sure to order a variety.",1,0,1,Helen C.,"New York, NY",31,85,121

5.0,2/6/2017,"I have to admit, I am always a bit skeptical when going to Asian-inspired or Asian-fusion restaurants because I am Vietnamese myself and will naturally be a little more critical because I know what authentic Vietnamese/Asian cuisine should be. With that being said, I am giving  Pig & Khao 5/5 stars! I loved the artwork and decor inside the restaurant. The ambiance gives off a traditional meets modern day style. My bf and I came here while browsing the NY Restaurant Week options. We loved the 90s hip hop music that played in this trendy restaurant all night! Lol. I love that Pig & Khao is putting Asian cuisine on the map and magnifying our best dishes!The food was better than just good! NY restaurant week prix fix options usually offer 3 course meals in majority of restaurants, but Pig & Khao offered 4 courses! Needless to say, we were stuffed and still had leftovers for the next day. I ordered the grilled pork jowl, Shan noodles, cod in banana leaf, coconut rice, and halo-halo for dessert. All for $42 per person thanks to Rest. Week.   I wish I would've seen more Vietnamese cuisine in an Asian fusion restaurant. I saw a lot of Filipino & Thai foods. How about Pho which is a staple and growing trend for my Vietnamese people?! Lol. That would've sealed the deal for me. I will definitely return here as well as recommend this restaurant! This spot is good for date night, catching up with a friend, a group of friends, or small dinner party celebration. I will even consider it for a possible future bday dinner party! Perfect location in the LES to go bar hopping afterwards... Yasss. Ps. They have IPA beer (le Boo loved it) and I loved the ""Rum & Hyde"" white rum & ginger drink. PPS.

4.0,2/5/2017,"Good food. Reasonably priced. Eclectic decor. Tight spaces.Came here for dinner.  There was a short wait, about 5 minutes even though the place was packed.  We ordered the chicharron, the roasted peanuts, khao soi, butter shrimp, and coconut rice.  The chicharron was good.  I would pass on the peanuts but the girlfriend liked them.  She liked her khao soi. It had a spicy sour taste to it.  Im not a fan of sour soups like sinigang but thought it was okay.  Might eat it again.  The girlfriend really like it though.  Butter shrimp was good but it came with the shell and you only get 4 pieces of shrimp for $16.  They should have removed the shell before cooking.  And its covered in shrimp paste so if you arent a fan I would recommend against it.The food isnt really authentic Filipino, more of an asian fusion, but would rate it 4 out of 5.  The space is really small and tight though.  There is no way to move without bumping into somebody. We got a table by the bathroom and people kept bumping into us trying to get by.  The tables are small too so you shouldnt order too much.  You cant fit more than two plates and drinks comfortably.  We ordered two appetizers, which we finished, and had two mains, which we just barely fit onto our table.  The table next to us ordered 5 or 6 main dishes and had no room for their plates.  They tried balancing a plate on their soup bowls and the plate spilled over. Think the next table got some of the food on them.  They really should take out a table or two so the space isnt so tight.BONUS: They offer a bottomless beer just dont remember the brand.",1,0,0,Mike E.,"Edison, NJ",0,19,4

3.0,2/4/2017,"I was really excited to finally try Pig and Khao but was unfortunately disappointed by the experience. We came for Restaurant Week late Friday night and it was packed. They were also running late on reservations, but fortunately we were seated early.Pig and Khao definitely falls victim to its small space. The open kitchen is cool but the over atmosphere is incredibly chaotic. Between the hostess, food runners, and servers running back and forth, plus diners lining up to use the one bathroom (and I felt so bad for the table RIGHT next to the bathroom door), it was obvious the space is way too small even by NY standards. I saw rushed servers bump into diners, tables, chairs and had to yell almost the entire time to communicate.The food itself is decent but forgettable, at least compared to other Filipino restaurants I've gone to in the area. The best parts of our meal were the drinks (loved the spicy tequila) and the appetizers - the Chinese sausage salad, the pork belly adobo, and the Shan noodles. The baby back ribs entree was way too sweet although the meat fell off the bone. The cod was overcooked and dry. The halo-halo dessert was not bad, not amazing.

The portions were generous, and we were all super full. My friends had to pack 1/3-1/2 of their food to go. Also, I hate cilantro, so I asked them to not put it in the papaya salad.  Our server then came back to warn me that it was in the cod, and he offered to tell the kitchen to tone it down for my dish, which they did!  I will say that it gets super packed though. The line was out the door by the time we were done, so make sure to get a reservation.",0,0,1,Bou L.,"Manhattan, NY",430,15,18

I'm Filipino, so to me, this isn't traditional filipino food, but more fusion, although they definitely did have traditional dishes that we didn't order like crispy pata and sisig. The adobo and ribs are both super flavorful, but a tad bit too salty. I could put up with it for the taste, though and I'm really glad we went here, because I'll definitely come back again!The vibe was really cool here too, which is the main reason that makes me come back to a restaurant.

3.0,1/30/2017,"*** Edited to 3 stars because I never received a response from the manager who told me to email him aka horrible service :(The food here was amazing, but the SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE.My friend and I came in at around 12PM on Sunday for brunch. We didn't have a reservation, but they allowed us a table until 1:30 PM (1.5 hours). Although unlimited mimosas was 2 hours, we were fine with this. We ordered our food, but it came quite slowly. The unlimited mimosas were also very slow. At 1:20, I had ordered 3 and asked for a 4th one. The waiter said that if we closed our bill, he would bring me my 4th one. We proceeded to pay, but by the time he brought back our cards, I asked where my final mimosa was and he said he had to cut me off because it was 1:30. I didn't find this to be very fair at all. I talked to the manager and he said to email him, so I was glad that management was kind and I will try to contact him and see what happens! However, I'm not sure I would recommend the unlimited mimosas because it seems they really try very hard to oppose the word ""unlimited"", even well under 2 hours.

1.0,1/29/2017,"BOY OH BOY! I've never been so blessed to be treated with one of the rudest waitstaff ever! I know a lot of people have different opinions on how they should rate businesses. I like to include everything because you are dining in for an experience. A friend and I reserved via OpenTable a week in advance and the only available for Sunday brunch time was 3:15. So if you want to get a real decent time, book further ahead of time. When we came, the hostess told us that we had less than 10 minutes to order our food because the kitchen closes at 3:20, and restaurant is closed at 3:30 (to be reopened at 5pm). I don't understand why they would make 3:15 an option for a reservation on OpenTable. My friend knew what he wanted to order, but what about people who want to talk their time and look at the menu or have questions? I think that's really inconsiderate. At least make your last reservation before the midday closing at 3pm. That way, people won't feel so rushed to order. Every waitstaff didn't have a specific table they serve. We ordered two sides of the garlic fried rice. Only one came at first, and we thought okay, maybe it'll come soon. We saw them giving other garlic fried rices to other tables, so we asked one of the waiters when our's was coming out. They were very short and almost rude by saying ""it will come out"" and just walks away to their corner by the bar. Umm ok. 10 minutes later, still did not get it and we were half way done with out food. We asked another waitress about it and she gave us a very snarky attitude with her comment, ""it's gonna come out"". Honestly, WHO HURT YOU?! I just don't get the wait staff here. Everyone is so grumpy and angsty here!!!Okay so onto the food. I would categorize Pig and Khao as southeast asian cuisine. They have a variety of dishes from Philippines, Vietnam, Thai, and more. We got the sisig, pork jowl, khao soi and two sides of garlic fried rice. It was my first time having all of the dishes so when it comes to being authentic, I don't really have a clue lol. Although my filipino friend said the sisig is the closest to how his mom makes! I absolutely love the sisig. Okay but honestly who doesn't love pork belly. I highly recommend this. The pork jowl was mixed with brussel sprouts and was a good ratio between fatty meat and your veggies. Pretty standard. The khao soi was interesting, almost like a Thai curry with egg noodles. I wish it was spicier, but still nasty. Not the best curry I've had. I do recommend getting a side of garlic fried rice just to try! It was really flavorful. We came during their brunch time and my god, everyone was so loud and rowdy. Apparently it's how it is every weekend during brunch time, along with loud r&b hits playing (don't mind it, but with the noise level, it should be taken down a notch). Overall, good food. But everything I mentioned about my experience there just ruined it for me. If you want to try this place out, maybe go on a weekday near opening time when it isn't too busy or loud.

2.0,1/25/2017,"I really, really wanted to like Pig and Khao, but our experience was just too damn weird for us to want to go back. I feel guilty giving this two-star review, because I give mad props to the founder and chef, and Southeast Asian cuisine that isn't Thai is underrepresented, but...nah. I can't back this up. Also, I'm verbose af, long review ahead. A few things to keep in mind:1. While the cuisine is mainly Filipino, there are a few items from Burma, Malaysia, and Vietnam. I recommend researching and knowing your dishes; it really helped me appreciate dishes I would not have known otherwise.2. I lucked out with an Open Table reservation, so I recommend doing that. Otherwise, be prepared to wait. When I left at around 9pm, there was quite a queue.  3. Their food is family-style, and they do it one at a time, so be prepared to share. If this isn't your thing, skip it altogether, unless you like watching other people eat as you wait.  4. Their music is indeed loud, but it is legit shit. I think our experience was marred because there happened to be a random inspection by the Department of Health that evening, and in doing so, our food didn't come out until about 25 minutes after we ordered. Subsequently, I think our first dish suffered, but the quality did increase afterwards. The part that irks me, however, is that we never received any information about this, nor an apology from our server until I actually asked him what happened at the end of the night. I found this to be a huge lapse, that in retrospect, I wish that we were informed of this as we were waiting for our food, and not me having to inquire as we were paying the bill. I sympathize with this situation, as my parents were deli owners in NYC in the 90's (you bet health inspections sprang out of nowhere), and I also understand that the staff may have been panicking/stressed out--I know the drill better than anyone. Perhaps I should have spoken up earlier, but the lack of forthrightness still bugged me. But back to the food: 1. Octopus salad: normally really good, but unfortunately ours was overcooked and dry. You could probably play hockey with one of them as a puck--it was so tough. I believe this was cooking when the inspection happened, so it was left on the grill way longer than it should've been. That said, I can imagine it being superb under normal circumstances and I would actually order this again. 2. Green papaya salad: it was alright, but tasted too sour and had an almost-rancid smell that I know was just the fish sauce and was fermenting. It didn't have the light taste I normally associate with good green papaya salad. But clearly I'm still alive and writing this review, so it's all good. 3. Khao Soi: This one was a winner. Spice, noodles, coconut milk, and the umami flavor came through and delivered. I recommend coconut rice on the side to beat the saltiness. The rice was amazing. Strangely enough, I'm the first person who complains when things are too salty, but I actually found the salads not too bad. Maybe it depends on the cook?Between the three of us, those three dishes were more than enough. The worst offense, however, was not even about the service or the food, but rather this lingering smell that permeated the restaurant every so often...it was like someone dropped a couple of deuces in the toilet (if you get my drift), opened the door, and waited for everyone to smell the offensive odor for shits and giggles. It was bad. We were too hungry to leave, other customers and I were looking at each other going ""WTF,"" while the staff were super oblivious, or maybe pretended not to notice. It smelled like sewage water coming from the pipes. Sigh. Maybe it's the plumbing and its LES roots are showing up for what it is. I dunno. tl;dr--Food has potential, khao soi is awesome, but service was weird and I really want to give it another chance, but..... shit.",5,3,2,Cat J.,"Flushing, NY",119,229,88

Corned beef hash is also good.Khao soi is their signature, and it is very good! Bright and acidic. Make sure you have rice for the extra broth.

The ube ice cream was delectable, with an earthy root flavor reminiscent of taro, a bright purple, it is a peacock among ice creams, certainly no Uber sweet wallflower. The milk had some sort of grain cereal in it which was awesome, as well as coconut. I didn't like the cubes in it that reminded me of roasted chestnuts, but everything else about it was great. I also got the Turon, which was salted caramel ice cream with banana fritters, which were crispy and yum, and chocolate sauce which wasn't crazy good, but OK. To drink we got the sweet and sour cilantro soda, and the Fiji green tea. The tea was so perfect there were no words to describe it and the soda was great too, very refreshing.

3.0,1/20/2017,"**Rating is a 3.5**2017 is the year of trying new foods for my friends and I. We had wanted to come here on Monday but due to the Holiday and timing we were not able to come when it was opened. So we decided to stop by around 6 pm on a Thursday. The place itself was not huge but they do have a back patio area which had quite a bit of seating. The place itself was super lit from the moment you walk in since they are blasting music, mainly hip pop / rap with a lot of throwback songs. My friends and I really enjoyed the music (as it was not as loud in the patio area) but if you are not into that kind of music or loud music blasting during your meal then you might not have such a great time. When we got here at 6 pm there were quite a bit of seats in the front area opened but I think those were for reservation as they offered us the seats on the back when they found out we did not have a reservation. For a while we were the only people in the back patio area which was pretty cool, our server was extremely friendly as he took our order. He told us what was good and told us what to ""avoid"" (as in he mentioned the prawn dish only had about four prawns - which made us not order it since it was about $16). For food we ordered: -Jasmine and Coconut Rice ($3 each): The coconut rice is extremely coconut-ty so if you are not into coconuts def. avoid it. - Shan Noodles ($16): The flavors were very strong in this dish and it is quiet spicy. The noodles itself were really good but I felt that the flavors were a bit too strong as it was pretty much spicy mixed with a strong lime flavor. -Sizzling Sisig ($16): This was one of the best tasting dishes that night. It was super flavorful especially when the raw egg was mixed in the meat. The grill thingy made some of the meat pieces really crispy and tasty. It does get a bit too much though. -Crispy Pata Baby Back Ribs ($26): This dish was tasty but nothing too special, it tasted like regular ribs that was sweeter than I expected. It was not super flavorful but nothing that really stood out to me. There were 6-7 ribs in this dish. The dishes themselves are not super large so it is price-y for the amount of food you are getting, at the end of the night for the three of us it came out to be $27 a person.

4.0,1/17/2017,"Pig and Khao is a unique Filipino fusion restaurant with influences of Thai and Vietnamese cuisine. It is located in LES, surrounded by various hipster restaurants and cafes, so, in honesty, can be overlooked. However, I am in the quest of trying out as much Filipino spots as possible; I was happy to find Pig and Khao. I first came here on a Friday night to meet up a friend. This place is not entirely great for deep convos as the ambience is very loud and the music can overshadow voices. It can definitely build the mood of a fun weekend out in the city. Food is great: not too heavy on the menu with super Pinot foods, but sisig is a definite number one here as this restaurant is made for both first-timers and those already familiar with this Southeast Asian cuisine. Pig and Khao incorporates additional ethnic dishes such as Thai and Vietnamese. Don't expect too much comfort foods if you are expecting mama's home cooking. They also serve desserts like typical halo halo, etc. Definitely a great spot if you feel like showing off your people's food or bringing a date. ;) By the way- ube! Prices are reasonable for the location which is similar to places like Maharlika, Jeepney, etc. I enjoyed their cocktails here in which they incorporated some SEA flavors too. However, whenever I come here, I will usually opt for a Red Horse! Space in here can get cramped. I actually enjoy it as it gives the place a casual intimacy. Decor is cute and lighting is super dim. The bathrooms are pretty spacious and clean but there is only one, which maybe a bad thing as you may wait on a line for a couple of minutes!Accepts card and open late. Service is good and quick.

The resturant is dimly lit with restoration furniture and modern light fixtures. We took advantage of their cheap and potent boozy brunch (2hr bottomless mimosas $15 and worth it). We walked out sauced. I had the steak and eggs, a small portion of two eggs and sliced medium cooked steak. It was good. My other half had the Shan Noodles, a peanut infused chicken and noodles dish, with a kick.

3.0,1/6/2017,"I'll preface by saying that while the food was great, our particular server left something to be desired. We were sat rather promptly, and while our table was a little hard to maneuver (they should really check the back corner table and notice that the legs do not lend well to moving the chairs) it was nice and full of pretty lighting. Also, one of the best and roomiest bathrooms I have ever seen in all of New York City. Bless you Pig and Khao for having a roomy restaurant, my butt thanks you!To begin with, we had no idea how the restaurant worked. We didn't know if it was family style or if we were to just order separate plates for each person. When we talked to our server, he didn't offer any help towards making choices or recommending how many of each item we should get. It just didn't seem like he really cared for us at all and just wanted us to eat and leave. Not once were we asked how the food was or if we needed anything! Even when we ordered, it seemed like he was judging our choices. ""One jasmine rice? That's it?"" ....yes, yes it is.However, this was just one server out of many though, the rest that circled by were great and took nice care of us. I do have to say that the food was prepared well and had a good kick to it that managed to make us warm even on the coldest day of our New York trip. I do have to warn potential patrons that the food is very heavy and you'll definitely need a pick me up afterwards to continue your day.tl;dr Pig and Khao is rather pricey for the amount of food you get, but it tastes pretty good. Make it more affordable and easier on your stomach by sharing the heavy, rich foods in a family style manner. You'll thank me when you're able to continue walking without the feeling of too much sizzling sisig sitting in your stomach. Also, get the khao soi!",3,1,1,Lily H.,"Austin, TX",351,5,1
4.0,1/5/2017,"When I think of brunch, I normally think of eggs and salmon, not Asian. So Pig and Khao is definitely unique in the brunch category for me. The restaurant has a kind of skater hip hop atmosphere. Came here for my cousin's birthday, eight people total. We had a pre-fixe brunch and ordered the sizzling sisig, steak and eggs, french toast, and shan noodles. Also with rice/garlic rice and bottomless mimosas. My favorites were the sisig, shan noodles, and garlic rice. The sisig, which is a pork head dish, comes out sizzling (hence the name) with a raw egg. Mix in the egg  so you get an even distribution of egg and pork! Some reviewers have said they thought the sisig was too salty, but I thought there was a perfect balance when I ate it with the garlic rice. Nice crunch. The shan noodles were light but really flavorful - I'm pretty sure there was a mix of sweet and salty and sour all in that one broth. The steak and eggs came with a really yummy sauce that complemented the steak. That dish also went well with the garlic rice! French toast was good too, but nothing too exciting to write home about.Great service! We were seated in the back but our waiter consistently came to fill up our waters and mimosas. He started off giving individual mimosas and then gave pitchers of mimosa. Mimosas came in different flavors including orange, lychee, peach, and some others that I forgot. Would definitely recommend this place, especially for brunch, and would come back here again.",0,0,0,Danielle M.,"Jersey City, NJ",65,102,267
5.0,1/5/2017,"Pig and Khao is a great alternative to your typical American brunch selection.I've been here a couple of times already and I have to say, I'm quite impressed. By impressed I mean, I did not expect to enjoy the food this much. The flavors and texture of the food are on point. I've tried a wide selection of the brunch menu and my favorites are the Sizzling Sisig (not sure if I'm spelling this correctly) & the corn beef hash. These dishes are definitely on the more oily/salty side, but that's how I like it. The meat was so flavorful and I absolutely love it how it comes with a raw egg that becomes cooked right in front of you. Make sure you order a side of garlic rice with your dish. The garlic rice is so delicious!I tried the fried donuts and I suggest skipping this. It was nothing special and the green dipping sauce that came with it was kind of a turn off. I dont know why it was lime green... I also tried another sweet brunch item but I forgot what it was. Nevertheless, I would skip it altogether.As for the unlimited mimosas, it's $15 for 2 hours. They have 4 different flavors, but to be honest, I almost could not taste the differences haha. I was drawn to the fact that they had a lychee flavor! Maybe they added more champagne than the fruit puree.. but who's complaining? I would still try this if you haven't already!Overall, I've had a great experience here and I'd definitely come back here. This restaurant is one of those places you can take ""out-of-towners"" to.

2.0,1/3/2017,"Pig&Khao's attempt at Filipino Southeastern Asian food is a good try at best and unsatisfying to say the least. Filipino food is known for its heartiness and flavor which P&K lacks. Ive never had food in the Philippines so I don't know what's authentic but I've had some very good Filipino food in the DMV area. On a random weekday, I decided to venture out of my apartment and eat at P&K myself. I was seated at the bar at first which was not as good an idea as it sounds. Although I appreciated the open kitchen, it was extremely hot. I was promptly moved to a side table after requesting. After 10 mins of sitting, I finally caught the attention of my waiter and ordered the Kao Soi, Sizzling Sisig and Vietnamese iced coffee (they can make iced). Food didn't take too long to appear but sisig came a lot later than the Kao Soi. Portions are small so you definitely need to order at least 1.5x per person ratio. Overall the Kao Soi was okay - nothing too memorable. The base was like a curry laksa, thick but drinkable. Sisig was disappointing, after having very good ones at Maharlika. I think flavors and herbs are good but the lemongrass(I think) is way too overpowering, making the food a little bitter? Also both dishes are on the saltier side so I would definitely recommend ordering some carbs (garlic rice) to go with it. I'm kind of surprised they didn't have kalamansi drink which is a staple in most Filipino restaurants. Order came out to be ~$50 including tips and tax. I expect more for the $$ I paid. Also believe that they constantly up the price to keep with demand. If you want more traditional (aka non fusion) Filipino food, I would recommend maharlika (been around much longer) around Ave A? which has a more extensive menu and larger portions.",1,0,0,Sophia W.,"Manhattan, NY",414,199,107

I'm still upset about Prosperity Dumplings moving from across the street, it was the only reason for me to ever visit this area...but Pig and Khao is a great addition to the neighborhood and might have me coming around here again.  Also: they played the most obscure hip hop songs I've heard played at a restaurant and that's always a big plus for me.  The food, music and overall vibe took me to another place.",1,0,1,Minto S.,"Richmond Hill, NY",147,274,10

My companion and I ordered three small plates after perusing the menu: the Pork Belly Adobo, the Giant Prawns and the Grilled SIrloin steak. The plates seem small when they come out, however, they are perfect for sharing and they fill you up unexpectedly. We didn't even get rice and had to drag ourselves out by the time we finished our delectable choices. All three options were hearty yet light. You don't feel like you're dying while trying to finish the food. The prawns come out sitting in some kind of crunchy spicy goodness that we couldn't get enough of. The grilled sirloin was cooked to perfection as was the pork belly, so glad we didn't order the chicharron which I suspect was a smaller version of this dish.

Apparently they deliver too (which I would totally get if I lived near here). We enjoyed that our waters were refilled quickly and that the staff was very friendly. We ordered the Khao soi, pork adobo, and sisig. I've never had a curry noodle like the khao soi and it was very delicious. The meat in the noodles are so tender, it practically melts away as you chew. The pork adobo came in a few slices which was good for sharing. We poked the poached egg and coated each fatty piece of pork in the yolk. The sisig was what I came for and it was also very yummy. A little salty, so great to pair with rice. For dessert, we had the halo halo ice cream. Not quite fit to my palette. Ube ice cream sits on top shaved ice covered in sweet milk. There are other things mixed in like flan and cereals, but I think I would have liked the banana dessert option better. #fortheinstagramMany of the menu items are salty or heavily marinated meats so it's hard to have a balanced mixture of dishes at Pig and Khao, but each item is well crafted. Each item we ordered were all great for sharing family style. The decor and ambience is a grungy-modern-rustic style with rap and hip-hop blaring in the background. There's a bar in the middle and a bathroom in the corner and for some reason, someone was always in it so I never got to pee :( Would come back again and order a larger plate and a salad to balance out the flavors.",0,0,0,Winnie X.,"Manhattan, NY",278,36,24

Chiccharon ($4): A small bowl of dry, stale pork rinds I could have gotten a bag of from the bodega down the street for $1 with flavorless dipping sauce. Hard pass. Papaya salad ($13): Pretty good, though the mint and fish sauce overwhelmed the papaya. Khao soi ($16): The only saving grace of this meal. The thick coconut curry with egg and crispy noodles was very good, especially paired with coconut rice. Pork belly adobo ($16): Too fatty and the crispy skin was tough and chewy. The sauce it came in was super salty.Hainanese duck ($33): Holy shit we regretted ordering this. It's basically half an undercooked duck doused in this weird sweet sauce with a fried rice cake. There was nothing Hainanese about it. And it was 33 FUCKING DOLLARS! Absurdly overpriced and it didn't even taste good. $100 down the drain for a meal that I did not enjoy. I just found the food too heavy, unbalanced and sloppy. I do not feel good after eating it and would not want to eat it again. Also the music...God the music was atrocious. The playlist was straight out of Monday night at a trashy strip club and blasting so irritatingly loud I could barely hear the person across from me.

Im filipino myself and know that nothing could compare to my dad's filipino cooking, but I wasnt there for that. I wanted filipino food spun in a different way as well as other southeast asian flare.  the place is small, i would recommend making reservations. Open kitchen were you can see the chef leah bossing around all these burly guys around which was awesome. I cant wait to come back again. Small places and some large plates. Everything is family style to shareChicharron - pork skin with vinegar... reminded me of home and my dad sitting in the living room eating this upRoasted peanuts - ok, couldn't really taste the kaffir or lemon grassGreen Papaya salad -  refreshing dish to break up all the sweet sour going onPork Belly Adobo - 4 pieces which was perfect for our table.. sweet and sour.. and a poached egg to make the sauce more rich.. soooo goodSizzling Sisig - a must have dish at any filipino restaurant. Ive never seen it wiht a fried egg in the middle.. delicious!Khao Soi - this was my absolute favorite and still thinking about it today! Egg noodles that sit on top of the this amazing Curry broth/soup. When you mix it all togehter, the noodles soften and absorb all the sauce and completely amazing. I wish i didnt have to share.. Malaysian Butter Prawns - delicious! So tender and buttery curry marinate/sauce. Half Hawainese Duck - amazing, sweet and sour, exceptionally and perfectly cooked!Coconut Rice - i had it with everything ;0). Dessert - Turon, not too bad, but used to it covered in honey or a caramel sauce. Halo Halo very refreshing and made me feel like I was in the philippines ;0) I will not have Ube ice cream any other way. Like i said before, if your expecting your lola's home filipino cooking, dont come here.

4.0,11/5/2016,Food was very good. I had a noon reservation. I arrived ten minutes early without the rest of my party. They sit me while I waited. The sugar donuts are good. Reminds me of zepoloes. Had the Khao egg noodle dish in spicy coconut milk they allowed me to sub out the chicken for tofu. That wasnt a listed option on the menu but that was cool they did that. They should advertise it. Get more vegetarians to there. I liked the atmosphere. There was hip hop music playing. Very chill laid back vibe typical of LES. My friend thought her food was too spicy but I loved the heat. The crunchy noodles with the egg noodles was a great combo. They kept refilling my water glass. They didn't rush you out. I'd go back. Plus it's close to the cat cafe. Stop in there after!! Not five stars bc they didn't advertise the tofu sub. You guys should then it would be five!!  Everyone was very nice. Service was great.

My favorite dish was the pork adobo which was insanely good! The pork belly was cooked perfectly - the skin was so crispy and chewy at the same time. The sauce it came in was a perfect complement to the coconut rice. My least favorite dish was the SAN noodles which were too vinegary for my taste but maybe that's how it is - authenticity wise. For dessert, my three other friends and I shared the donuts and the shaved halo-halo ice dish! The donuts were soft, fresh, and hot! They were accompanied by a lemon ricotta icing.  My favorite part about the halo halo were the crispy rice kernels and the ice cream. There were also pieces of caramelized plantain chunks which were abundant. Their drinks are also very unique and delicious - my friends got the spicy margarita inspired drink, Lower East Side, I think. And if you love horchata, I would recommend getting the Mr. Horchata.

This blend of coconut curry soaked into the rice makes the rice even better. Usually by the time we attempt to finish eating, there's barely any room for dessert.

I'm part Vietnamese and we have fish sauce for everything but goddamn now I realized why the waiter kept pouring water in everyones cup.

5.0,10/24/2016,"Wow, I'm shocked.Pig and Khao is probably my favorite restaurant in New York. It's 100% the case for brunch (in my opinion, it's the best brunch in the city), and it's fantastic for dinner as well. And that's why I'm shocked - how I haven't written a review until now is beyond me.Leah and Ben run the show here, and once you come here for brunch, you'll never crave overpriced eggs and crappy mimosas ever again. Here you'll find something different -- Southeast Asian items like khao soi (red curry, coconut milk, chicken, egg noodles, pickled mustard greens, shallots), sizzling sisig (pork head, chili, whole egg), shan noodles (ground chicken, turmeric, peanuts, fermented mustard greens, rice noodles), and lots more. I've never brought a new person here who didn't love it, and as you - a new person reading this review - I hope you'll like it just as much.Of the two unlimited drink options during brunch, I always go for the red Solo cup that you can fill (and refill repeatedly) yourself at the Yingling keg located on the back patio. It's like a frat keg party, but without anyone named Chad and no man buns in sight. Pair that with awesome hip hop and a whole lot of good vibes, and you have one of the best weekend meals anywhere downtown.",27,14,20,Ruggy J.,"Manhattan, NY",4991,2429,5328

2.0,10/20/2016,"I came here for a family dinner with my filipino mother, sister and husband, and it was a disappointing experience...Pros: Food wasn't bad; on a scale from 1 to 10, I'd give it a 8. And the prices were reasonable.Cons: (1) Preferably, everyone at a table should get their plates at the same time (or roughly around the same time). My sister had her plate first, then 10 min later, my mom received half of what she ordered (it took an add'l 10 min for her rice). Then 15 minutes later, my husband received his meal. And I received my meal 10 min after my husband had his meal. Our server said that the owner likes to do ""Family style"" so that everyone can eat off of one another's plates and that's why the orders don't come out at the same time. Their ""Family style"" plates are not your typically large family style plates -- the plates are actually individual serving sizes. Bottom line: I don't enjoy watching other people eat and finish their food while I wait for my order to arrive.Second, the music was pretty loud. They played 90's Hip Hop the whole night - which I don't mind, I actually like 90's hip-hop - but my husband asked if they could lower the volume because it was somewhat difficult to have a conversation, and we were told ""the owner likes it this loud"". Well, I'll be sure not to invest my time/money into this place again because of the owner, and I'll be sure to discourage my social network to not waste their time either.",1,2,0,Lena N.,"North Massapequa, NY",27,14,0
5.0,10/15/2016,"Went to Pig & Khao for brunch, and what a great experience! The ambiance is very modern and minimalist, yet you'll find subtle hints that remind you that you're getting Asian fusion. The 90's hip hop was also music to my ears.So here's a recap of what my wife and I ordered:- Sisig: came out on a sizzling plate, with a cracked egg that cooked as it was brought over to our table. The Sisig was had a nice crunch to it, and stayed true to its Filipino roots.- Corn Beef Hash: from it's title sounds very comforting - which is was. Like the Sisig, it came out on a sizzling plate with an egg. However, what truly set it apart from regular corn beef hash was the inclusion of lime, cilantro, and chili peppers. It brought about an exotic flavor profile, yet you still feel like you were eating corn beef.- Garlic Fried Rice: Generous serving size, just the right amount or stickiness, and ample amounts of fried garlic.- Hot Tea w/Whiskey: Great value at $7, $3 for the tea plus $4 to add whiskey.

The Champorado was the perfect dessert too finish off our delicious meal with - just the perfect amount of chocolate and sweet.

Really enjoyed this one; in lesser green papaya salads, the fish sauce can get overpowering and detract from the green papaya, but this was just right. SISIG (wife's entree)~ pork head with egg on a sizzling platter. Mix in the egg with the pork while it's still hot and yolky, and you gots some The only criticism is that the saltiness of the food adds up as the meal progresses, so much so that you begin to actually notice how much water you're drinking than you normally would.

The Sizzling Sisig was also good with a variety of textures on the plate but I don't think it compared in flavor to the Khao So. The tap special was the only thing I was a little disappointed in.

5.0,8/19/2016,"This is the second time I went to Pig & Khao. This time is for restaurant week. They have the best restaurant week deal! It's basically a 4-course menu and each course's portion is like an entree size. My friend and I ordered different things so we can share. So these are all my comments on the dishes we tried during restaurant week. - Grilled Pork Jowl: best dish I had that night. The brussel sprouts were very well seasoned and it's a great combination with the pork slices- Green Papaya Salad: One of the few places that can execute a great papaya salad. It's very flavor-able.- Khao Soi: A little too spicy to my taste. So be prepared before you order this if you cannot eat spicy food.- Pork Belly Adobo: It would be great if the pork was a little softer. But it's still a great dish. The sauce that came with it was great! And the pouched egg combination was perfect!- Baby Back Ribs: Bones fell off the bone! Enough said!- Cod in Banana Leaf: Very flavor-able. This is on the smaller side in terms of portion. But at that point we really appreciate a smaller dish..- Coconut rice: you may think it's nothing special about coconut rice, you will change your mind when you try this!!! I don't know what they put in that rice, but it's magic!- Halo-Halo: I loved the ice cream flavor, the coconut and the pieces of flan combination. The shaved ice was great on a hot day. However, when the ice melted, it kinda take away the sweetness of the dessert. I would ask next time if they can skip the shaved ice in this dish.- Turon: Not a big fan of banana myself. But my friend likes it.",0,0,0,Ada W.,"Manhattan, NY",231,255,176
2.0,8/17/2016,"I wanted to like this restaurant, I really did. While there were many good elements that could've made for a great meal, there was just something off about every single course. I ordered the restaurant week set and started with the grilled pork jowl which came with brussels sprouts that were seriously over-salted, making it nearly impossible to finish. For the second course I ordered the khao soi noodles, which were so doused in curry powder that it made the dish disappointingly one-dimensional (e.g. curry curry curry holy crap curry). For the third course I ordered the banana leaf cod, which was alright, but had a flavor profile reminiscent of those New England-style stuffed clams you find in the frozen section of a supermarket. I got the Halo Halo for dessert, which was quite nice--this was the high point of my otherwise underwhelming meal. I got this with the coconut rice, which was a bit too sweet--almost dessert-like. All in all, this place isn't worth the money. It seems more pre-occupied with maintaining an aesthetic that suits the LES hipster chic scene at the expense of food taste and quality.",0,0,0,Dan Y.,"New York, NY",3,12,0

3.0,8/13/2016,"one word - SALTY  My friends and I came here for restaurant week with high expectations and were disappointed. Probably the saltiest meal I've ever eaten in my life.The pork jowl was mostly brussel sprouts (which were cooked well) but it tasted like it was doused in a gallon of fish sauce....salty af. The khao soi noodles that came afterwards were even saltier. We couldn't taste any of the coconut or curry flavors in the broth bc it was so overwhelmingly salty. The noodles in it and the coconut rice that came as part of the set meal were both undercooked. By the time the baby back ribs came out our tastebuds were completely burnt out. The ribs were cooked well but the ""special bbq sauce"" tasted like it was mostly hoisin sauce. The halo halo was super beautiful and photogenic(for all the people out there that want ig pics) but it was really mostly milk and ice with a scoop of ice cream. There were probably only 4 tiny pieces of fruit and 3 pieces of flan floating around which made it taste like really bland, icy cereal milk....the jollibee halo halo that you can get for half the price kicks this one's a*ss in terms of flavor and toppings.

4.0,8/6/2016,"****PORK OVERLOAD****Overall, a pretty cool, trendy place. Good for sharing. And drinking (more on that later). I'm a Filipino food noob, so take the following with a grain of salt:  MEAT/PAPAYA GAME--Sizzlin Sisig is quite fatty and salty but filled with flavor. Don't come here for the first time without ordering this, if you have qualms about where on the pig you're meat came from.--Crispy Pata was delicious, but portionwise didn't seem to be as great of a deal for $26. --Papaya salad was decent, good to complement all the fatty meat. --We got something else pork based, it was delicious, so I think that's your best bet.CARB GAMEI didn't think either of the rices were especially flavorful -- I guess the coconut and jasmine flavor profiles lets them charge $3 per bowl. The mantou buns were great if you've never had them before and like fried dough (who doesn't though). You'll want some carbs to balance the fat/sodium of the meat.DESSERTThe halo halo ($8) was pretty good; sharable among 4 people unless you want large portions.DRANKNeverending self-service Yuengling tap for $15 (2 hr limit) isn't bad, considering this is basically the price of a nice drink at any nicer establishment nearby downtown. Three beers and you get your moneys worth, so this doesn't necessitate raging. They also have a decent selection of cocktails for the more sensible. SERVICEMeh, it took a while and a few reminders to get our solo cups for the neverending Yuengling tap. They also forgot one of our dishes but it wasn't that big of a deal since volume of pig is satiating.FINAL VERDICT: Recommended for groups of non-vegetarians looking to share, just not their Yuengling.",0,0,0,Nick S.,"Stony Brook, NY",28,82,36

We ordered pork jowl, papaya salad, sizzling sisal, pork leg, shan noodles, monkfish, and the hainan duck. I was looking forward to this meal since it had such great reviews and I'm a fan of top chef but sadly very disappointed. I'm not picky and the flavors could have been wonderful if they dialed back the salt content by 70%. Everything was wayyyyy too salty, borderline inedible, so I could only take a bite or two out of each dish. I downed so much water and rice which is mainly what filled me up. Coconut rice was good but too sweet, which in this case kinda helped with the salt bomb. It is getting 2 stars because our waiter was great & the saving dish was the Halo Halo.

Little pieces of flan provided a pleasant surprise. Too bad I was sharing this because I totally could have put away one of these on my own.The rest of the food was also delicious. Dang, Philipino food - where have you been all my life?! We ordered the baby octopus, khao soi, coconut rice, sizzling sisig, and the papaya salad. Everything was solid, but my favorites were the baby octopus, coconut rice, and papaya salad. The baby octopus was tender and flavorful - although you see the entire octopus, so the squeamish might want to stay away. The coconut rice was pure magic and the papaya salad was a refreshing balance to the rest of the meal, which was more meaty and heavy.Pig and Khao? More like ""Pig and WOW!""

Not too overpowering and makes you want to go back for more bite after bite. Would definitely RECOMMEND. Powdered Donuts - disappointing that it came out with our main entrees and was cold by the time we got to it. It was dry and a little hard by then while I was expecting a soft roll-like texture. The powdered sugar mixed with the green sugar sauce it is paired with makes it way too sweet overall. I'm hoping it was better when it first came out of the kitchen. We came for restaurant week. Unfortunately your entire table has to eat off of the restaurant week menu or off of the normal menu and can't be split. Was caught off by that that just ordered off of the regular menu.

My gf, who is allergic to anything seafood, did not realize everything was cooked in fish sauce. We ordered the above, and as she took her first bite, realized that there was in fact fish sauce/miso sauce in our dishes. Staff had to take back the food and get it remade. They were apologetic though we should've mentioned that one of us had an allergy. Pero, we were still charged for the food that was taken back. Didn't fight it though. Oh, and there were mosquitoes everywhere, especially near our table since we sat right under a brightly lit lamp--which made me extremely uncomfortable, as if we were in an interrogation room.All in all, prob wouldn't come back unless one of my friends really wants to go, which then I'll order the banhxeo, halo halo and mantao to try, as suggested.

Dinner prices mainly hover around the 20 dollars but can range between 13 and 33. One small price complaint - 3 dollars for jasmine white rice is a bit much.

It had a lot of lemongrass or lime so there was a unique mix of flavors.  We were drinking the broth after all the noodles were gone.  The Grilled Pork Jowl was tasty too, but very salty, don't plan on eating a plate of that by yourself as it is very monotonous.

The ribs were phenomenal, by that I mean we were knawing on the bone and licking the sweet, hoisin-like sauce off our fingers expecting more.

I ordered the sizzling sisig and the pork jowl.  Both of which were amazing.  None of their dishes comes with rice.  Pork jowl is thinly sliced pork with brussels sprouts, thin slivers of onions, and lime-chili fish. The mixture of fatty meat and brussel sprouts was to die for. There was definitely an uneven proportion of brussel sprouts to pork but I did not mind (gotta have your veggies).  The juice of the dish went well over their coconut rice.  My friend got the pork belly adobo.  I tried it and fell in love -- there was just enough fat and the poached egg was perfectly runny.My friend got the ""Lower East Side"" cocktail and was not a fan.

Also, the sisig was just far from the tastes I'm personally used to. If you do decide to order the longaniza order a side of vinegar with it. It'll lessen the saltiness to an extent.Overall, the service was fast and they were all friendly.

The sisig was extremely flavorful and I personally love that fatty goodness so it was delicious with that squeeze of lime at the end. The khao soi was tasty as well with pungent flavors but I did wish there were more noodles inside. The jasmine rice was able to absorb the goodness of both dishes and I am glad I chose this rather than the coconut rice (as I read it can be sweet).

5.0,5/26/2016,"Believe the hype.We opted for the $45/person five-course tasting menu (Monday-Thursday only I believe), and we were all STUFFED. FYI, if you are thinking about this and you care about things like this - the food comes family style and not on individual plates like ""tasting menu"" usually means.What we ate:Amuse bouche: I don't remember what this was, but it was a perfect bite of something delicious.Pork jowls: We were allowed to request one dish to be included in our tasting, and this was our choice. It was such a great blend of salty and sour (just what I crave about Southeast Asian food), and the meat was balanced nicely with the brussels sprouts.Sizzing sisig: Oh, sisig. I get this whenever I have the chance. Pork, chili, and a raw egg that cooks on the sizzling platter. How could you go wrong? The pork didn't get as crispy as I would have liked, but that did not take away from the yumminess of the dish.Jasmine rice and coconut rice: They provided rice to go with our food. The coconut rice is probably the best coconut rice I've ever had. I could have eaten it plain.BBQ baby back ribs: Fall-off-the-bone-tender, saucy baby back ribs - everything you want ribs to be. The Asian slaw was a good side to balance out the heaviness of all the meat we were eating.The special - some kind of fish with bok choy?: I don't remember what exactly this was, but it was the special of the night, and it was perfect. I'm glad they included it in our tasting because while I love meat, it was refreshing to get some fish.Asian chicken wings: Lots of places do this now, but imagine a much better version of the best Asian wings you've had.Dessert - halo halo and donuts: The halo halo was ok, considering I'm not the biggest fan of halo halo. I was pleasantly surprised by the ube ice cream that came with it, since I don't like ube. It must be some really good ube ice cream. :) The donuts took me right back to the malasadas at Star Noodle in Maui. Light, fluffy, sugary little munchkins.Looking back at what we ate... it was definitely more than five courses! We were ROLLING out of there. Stuffed to the brim. My friend thought she was going to throw up because she was so full (ugh).I also had a Bangkok Fire cocktail - rye with Thai chili-infused honey. I love me some spice, and this was definitely one of the spiciest drinks I've ever had, but it was so. so. good.Service was great - they seated me and took care of my drink order even though my friends were late. Ambience is not what I was expecting (not sure really what I was expecting though); it was much louder in there than I was prepared for. My voice was hoarse by the end of the night.

Verdict: definitely the best dish of the night and so worth it. (Goes great with coconut rice - also a must!). On top of that the BBQ ribs are great. Chicken was tasty and comes with great dipping sauces but was perhaps a bit dry. Skip the mussels, and although everyone raves about the Sisig, I thought the Adobo was much tastier. Sisig is fun because it cooks in front of you but I like my egg runny and found that the hot plate overcooked my egg. (Maybe that was the point?).

With an adventurous menu, you'll experience sweet, sour, spicy, salty, and savory; Viet, Thai, Filipino, Cambodian. The winners of the menu are clearly the small plates. The sizzling sisig is rich, fatty, and salty, great with a bowl of rice. The pork jowl is fatty, with crisp brussel sprouts to balance the fat and a hint of lime. The eggplant salad with shrimp chips is a fun palate refresher. The coconut rice is delectable and slightly sweet. I was not a fan of the Shan noodles as they were pretty sour, or the seafood sinigang which lacked pop compared the the earlier dishes, but that's more personal preference than a comment on the food. All the dishes were high quality and delivered quickly to our table. We actually ran out of space at the table!The inside space is really warm - there are fans but on this warm spring day, there was no air conditioning. The kitchen is open, which is fun for spying on the chefs, but definitely heats up the dining room! Its also a little loud in here when at full hipster capacity. This particular Thursday night, we made a reservation and had no wait. However, the restaurant does not have a lot of seats, so I wouldn't recommend it for large groups unless you're eating at an odd hour. It just gets too hot and loud.

I wasn't looking for anything in particular, just a cleaner healthier version of what I ate when I was over there. And I'm big on ""Asian Fusion"", so this place looked like a winner.Pig and Khao is a trendy spot. @10pm on a Saturday, the place was filled, but not crowded, which I really liked. Easy to find, even though the sign outside is hard to read. The host gave us a choice of a table or the chef's counter. The counter was interesting, like a diner setup with an open kitchen. I was with a date, so we chose a table.I will say, like most trendy spots, the music was good (hip hop) but loud. We had to lean in to hear each other. The place is darkly lit, and the tables were not too squeezed into each other. We sat in the middle table but still felt enough space to call it separate.The menu is split by portion (small or large). We did small. We ordered Sisig, Pork Belly, Coconut Rice, and San Miguel beers (that's the only beer I drank over there). Yes, we had to order rice, it didn't come with any of the food.Sisig came out sizzling on the cast iron pan, with the egg sitting on top, waiting to be mixed in. Not too salty, and so good with the coconut rice.The pork belly came out in the asian red bowl, 5 slices with a poached egg, all sitting in a lemongrass heavy broth. Too salty for my taste, but was super tender.The staff was super friendly. They were attentive and everyone was willing to help, which for me is a huge plus. And to top it all off, they give lighters out as party favors! Pretty cool.Reccommendation: good for a group of friends, good way to start a night.

4.0,5/6/2016,"4.5 stars! Pig and Khao, as you may guess from the name, serves predominantly Southeast-Asian pork dishes. Not for vegetarians or the hyper health conscious, but if you're looking for a satisfying, flavorful meal, this is the place to go. The restaurant is quite small, with an open kitchen that sends wonderful wafts over the tables, but not crowded to the point of being uncomfortable. Our server was also attentive, and our water was filled up frequently. Onto the food: MAINS// Sisig // THE dish to get at Pig and Khao! It's basically chopped up bits of pig, with a runny egg on top. Super flavorful; gets a little salty though but pairs really nicely with rice! // Pork Jowl // I really liked the balance of the charred brussel sprouts (yay vegetables!) with the more fatty meat - has a good smokey flavor to it. // Pork Belly Adobo // The pork belly was wonderfully fatty but not too greasy, and the poached egg was 10/10. The sauce is also really yummy to spoon over rice! SIDES// Market vegetables // Our group was trying to look for a vegetable dish to balance out the meaty meal, and finally found the vegetables tucked away on the back side of the menu under sides. They had ""choi sum"" that day, which is basically like a chinese broccoli. It was surprisingly yummy and I was glad we ordered it to feel (semi) healthy! // Coconut & Jasmine Rice // Definitely do order rice to go with the main dishes - the meat dishes are really kinda too salty to eat on their own but goes super well with rice. I'd recommend ordering one of each kind of rice (coconut & jasmine) - the coconut rice was wonderfully creamy and coconut-ty, and the sweetness worked surprisingly well with the salty meat, but having a whole bowl of it would probably be a little too much, so the plain jasmine rice works well as a counterbalance to it.",2,1,1,Yolanda C.,"Philadelphia, PA",160,126,552

I had reservations at 5:30 and upon arriving I was the first customer in the restaurant. First thing you notice is that it's fairly loud at the place. Upon sitting, and while waiting for my friend to arrive, I told the waiter that we were doing the tasting menu cause she wanted to have Filipino food. Based on the tasting menu option I would rate this experience as follows:Environment:2/5The music is louder than it needs to be. The kitchen and the grill is in the middle of the dining area. You will smell like smoke when you leave. Now if this was Korean BBQ or Hot Pot, sure you know what you're getting yourself into. But for this type of food, it really is just unnecessary. Service:4/5The waiter was good, he was friendly and when the next course had to come, he offered to pack up the previous course so we can move on.Food/Tasting Menu:2/5This is what prompted me to review. The tasting menu end up as follows:An amuse bouche of duck liver pate - it was goodGreen Papaya Salad - which was only OK. You're better off going to a real thai placeAn order of Coconut Rice - fairly tastyPork Belly Adobo - Real tasty which is the only reason it's not 1 / 5Khao Soi - It was just OK. Not as spicy as described by other reviews, but not special eitherShrimp Special - It wasn't bad. 4 pieces of large shrimpRicotta Donuts - The kalamansi custard was good. You can taste the subtle taste of the kalamansiNow, If you add up the cost separately, it would have been cheaper just to order everything separately. This is VERY disappointing for a tasting menu. I've never had a tasting menu short you in this manner and this was just upsetting. Also, even though I requested to lean towards Filipino food, only 1 dish was Filipino influenced. Overall, I'm done with this place. I spent a lot of time researching their tasting menu and was not able to find anything meaningful.

The sisig was something we've had in Manila and were really looking forward to, but it never came. In the end we just asked them to cancel it (I'm not sure if it was even entered). We also got a side of coconut rice which was way too sweet and almost like a dessert. For actual dessert we tried the halo halo, but this too was a disappointment since it was a lot of shaved ice and little else.

The four of us got 4 small plates and two bowls of coconut rice for our meal - family style.  By the way, if you don't eat pork or don't like pork, much of the menu is pork... may want to take a peek at it first.Grilled pork jowl - brussels sprouts, toasted rice, lime-chili, fish sauce, herbs - not so much pork at all, really.  Lots of grilled/roasted brussel sprouts.  We loved the flavor of this dish and the use of brussel sprouts which isn't typically used in Asian cuisine - was a nice fusion.  However, did not taste much lime, chili, or fish sauce in this.  Decent portion for the price.Sizzling sisig - this was by far the favorite dish of the few that we ordered.  The sisig was obviously extremely greasy as it is supposed to be and there were plenty of fatty pig head parts to be found.  However, the flavor was amazing and it went really well with the coconut rice.  I just wish there was more!  Best sisig I've had yet.Khao soi - red curry, coconut milk, chicken, egg noodles, pickled mustard greens, red onions - there was so much crunchy noodle in this dish and not enough egg noodles to go around.  Chicken seemed to be scarce.  The flavor of the sauce base was a superb curry, but it may not have been spicy enough.  The egg noodles were of perfect texture.Shan noodles - red curry, coconut milk, chicken, egg noodles, pickled mustard greens, red onions - this was interesting as to me, it tasted more like a Chinese dish than Thai or Filipino.  This was my least favorite out of the bunch simply because it tasted way too much like black pepper and nothing else... which made it very spicy, but not the kind of spicy I like.We all enjoyed the delicious coconut rice, which is a must-have when getting dinner here.  It's both salty and sweet and very... coconutty for lack of a better term.Good place to try once, but not sure if I would crave P&K or go out of my way to have it.",8,3,4,Allene T.,"Manhattan, NY",2170,1311,3573
4.0,4/26/2016,"Low key joint with powerfully seasoned food!Came here on a Saturday night - we were able to make a reservation, but even after we arrived it wasn't packed. The atmosphere was laid back which went along with the neighborhood it was in.For two people we ordered the sizzling sisig with whole egg, pork belly adobo, shan noodles and a side of coconut rice. The shan noodles were delicious although quite spicy but the picked mustard greens added a nice zing of sweet/sour relief! The coconut rice was sweet and the perfect compliment to these flavorful dishes. My favorite was definitely the sizzling sisig as the pork was crunchy, juicy and coated with egg after breaking the egg around the hot plate.

2.0,4/25/2016,"We had a party of 5 and ordered the sisiq, pork jowl, pork belly adobo, khao soi, shan noodles, chicharron, fried mantou, and the sambal fish wrapped in banana leaf.The mantou is different from the Chinese ones, being softer and without condensed milk to dip. Not bad.The chicharron, or fried pork skin is really good but it does have a gamey taste to it so be aware of that when you order it.The noodles weren't anything special.The pork dishes were great, I especially like the sisiq. It sort of tastes like bone marrow if you're into that stuff. Very oily and greasy.The portions are sized appropriately if you're sharing orders for 1 dish per person. The mantou comes with 4 pieces and pork adobo comes with 5 pieces. Then you have coconut rice. If you order 1 by yourself, you don't have to order anything else because that thing is HUGE. It's sweet and salty. Too weird for my taste but it's not that bad.Don't get the fish. It's not bad but not good either, especially for $18. Just imagine some random fish drowned in dukpokki sauce. Its mediocre at best.Last but not least, for the love of god, do not get the halo halo. It is terrible shaved ice. Watery milk on the bottom, hard tiny chunks of ice, one scoop of taro ice cream, and like 3 small pieces of flan. I've had very good (perfect?) shaved ice at Cocohodo in Queens. Ice chunks do not exist in a shaved ice dessert and definitely not watery on the bottom, at least not until everything melts. Get your dessert somewhere else and save your $8.

The restaurant is pretty small and has an open kitchen, which adds to its ambiance. There were 2 of us and we each ordered a meal and also an order of donuts to share. My meal was brought out a good 10 minutes before my girlfriends, which isn't a good look especially when you can see the cooks making your food. I ordered the corned beef hash which is very good and my girlfriend got the French toast, which was just you're normal French toast, and the donuts didn't really do anything for us. The drinks were outstanding though, mango mimosa, cilantro soda and horchata iced coffee.

2.0,4/9/2016,"The only reason I'm giving Pig & Khao 3 stars is because of the service. The food is really good. I got the Grilled Pork Jowl and it was amazing!! It was so good I'm going to try to make it myself. My friends got the shan noodles and they all agreed it was equally delicious. First time having filipino food and I really enjoyed it.However, the service was spotty and towards the end terrible. My friends and I ordered the bottomless mimosas and understand that we can't sit there all day drinking, but we had to wait 40+ minutes for our refills. When we kept asking where they were, the staff said they were out of glasses to pour the mimosas. While talking to staff about the wait time they asked us to leave our table and drink the mimosas by the doorway (when they do arrive) so they can seat other people. If we were given out mimosas at least half an hour ago we wouldve drank them and left so they could seat the people waiting. It is EXTREMELY rude to ask your paying customers to stand by the door to finish their drink.

3.0,4/9/2016,"Came here on a double date and ordered only 3 dishes- the short rib beef (large dish), Pork Sisig (small dish) and the Mussels (small dish). A breakdown of each dish:1) Short Rib Beef: the meat was very tender and ripped easily under the fork/ in your mouth. The curry sauce that it is semi floating in is extremely spicy but that's where all the flavor is, so make sure to scoop up some sauce before popping a bite of meat into your mouth! Also, calling this ""large"" dish is an overstatement. 2) Pork Sisig: really tasty but SUPER oily/ fatty/ greasy. I was told it combines every part of the pig head so a majority of the time, I was trying to guess exactly which part. 3) Mussels: this was perhaps my favorite dish. The broth that the mussels are laid in is super tasty (but yet again, super salty). It was simmered with lots of cilantro, which is ALWAYS a good idea. After all the mussels were done, I dribbled some of the broth onto the coconut rice.* please don't forget to order coconut rice. It is very rich and creamy and very coconut-y (in case that isn't your thing, then you could always opt for the jasmine rice)!",5,3,5,Kimberly K.,"Plainview, NY",1345,194,399
5.0,4/7/2016,"In our #TriggsEatNYC trip over Easter, this place was the one I had been dying to get into for the longest.  Not disappointed. Made a reservation for our party of 4 for Easter Sunday brunch.   After a leisurely stroll from our hotel in the West Village got to the restaurant just as it opened.  Small, intimate, tucked in a busy street of markets and everyday stores, Pig & Khao just blends in.  Nothing outlandish or garish.  This place lets the food do the talking.  We all tried one of their cocktails. I went for the bright green Dakari - luscious. My wife opted for the mango mimosa (not the bottomless option which seems like great value). My brother went for a 'breakfast whiskey' aka Stinky Peet.  Good starts.  I realistically could only go for one dish, though everything on the menu screamed 'pick me'.  I took the Sizzling Sisig - sizzling pig face & wasn't disappointed.  Having cooked a pig head (or heads), the meat is broken down, chopped, grilled and served on a sizzling platter with a raw egg that cooks as you mix it in.  Combining that mixture with the garlic rice was a blast - every mouthful had different combinations of great pork textures and flavors - roast pork, bacon, ham, ear, belly pork, crackling ... all mixed together.  Not had a dish like it.  Of the rest of the party, 2 had noodle dishes described as excellent. My sister in law went with the corned beef hash and may well have met her favorite corned beef of her life.  We had an order of donuts presented to us with a pandan dip to accompany.  Light, greasy, crisp, doughy. A beautiful touch to finish a fantastic meal.  Definitely one to return to or to seek out if you are in NYC.  Thanks P&K for a great meal and experience",0,0,0,Jon T.,"Medfield, MA",18,33,6
4.0,4/7/2016,"This is a restaurant that features more than filipino food but there is an undeniable shout out to the underrepresented cuisine.  There is also Thai and Malaysian/Singaporean but I came here for the Filipino food and got a great meal.  The prices are a tad high for the type and quantity of food, e.g. half chicken inasal was $23, but in defense of the prices, the food is delicious.  Amazing amazing coconut rice.  Also like that they have San Miguel beer.Regarding the decor, I'd say it has some elements of mom-and-pop (scenic photos of rice plantations) but with a few modern touches.  The demographic was not what I expected.  It's almost entirely overrun by 20 something locals that I was surprised to find packing every seat even at 9:30pm on Saturday.Definitely worth going to if you're near enough to the area and want to dip a toe in a new cuisine (while staying in your comfort zone).",3,0,3,Heather A.,"New York, NY",13,26,0

Came here with 2 friends for dinner and ordered the crispy pata, baby back ribs, chicken Inasal and the BBQ coconut wings special for dinner and the banana Turon for dessert. Everything here is made to share. Even though we were looking for something more authentic; the food was good although some pieces of the chicken wings were undercooked and tendony as well as the crispy pata was fatty and not so much crispy.

5.0,4/4/2016,"Short: Medium sized place with great Asian/Phillipino fusion food.  The pork sisig is a must have along with the mussels.  Went here multiple times with friends and have never been let down by the food or service. Long:  Looking at the outside of the restaurant it is hard to tell that you can get such awesome food here.  The store front is small and can be easily looked over.  One quick glance at the menu upon walking in and you can tell immediately that there is major Asian influence on a lot of the dishes from sisig, to Taiwanese sausage, to the decadent pork belly.I had the liberty of tasting 4 different dishes all of which had an amazing depth of the flavor.  My favorite would have to be the pork sisig in which the pork was not too fatty but had a nice crunch.  When mixed with the freshly cracked egg you can hear and smell the egg sizzle on the cast iron dish that it is served on.  The mussels were another amazing dish which is served with a pastry of some sort.  Discovered towards the end of the meal that the best part was dipping the pastry into the sauce of the mussels.  I would recommend this place for smaller groups but the back of the restaurant can accommodate larger groups.  Keep in mind the place does get filled up and I often had to make reservations prior to arriving.",0,0,1,Jesse C.,"New York, NY",41,8,0

5.0,3/31/2016,"Being a Filipino born and raised in NYC, the recent breakthrough of Filipino cuisine has put a huge smile on my face.  As much as I love expanding my ""flavor"" horizons, there's really no place like home.Having said that, this menu wouldn't be as successful for me if it didn't have Thai and other asian influences as well.I've been here on two occasions, the first was brunch with my girlfriend and the second was dinner with a bunch of friends.  And on both occasions, my taste buds were jumping for joy! The venue is really laid back and they really hit the nail on the head with the asian vibe and decor!  Dragon/tricycle sculpture hanging on the wall, wooden tables and chairs, green walls, asian style ""dynasty"" plates! sheesh kudos to their designer.We ate all these dishes ""Family Style"", that way we were able to get more of a variety in less sittings.Horchata Iced Coffee ($6):  Whaat?! I know right..  If you like vietnamese or cambodian style iced coffee, then you'll probably LOVE this lol.  The horchata adds a creaminess and exotic sweetness to the bitterness of the coffee.  Yeah.. bittersweet, but mostly sweet :DCoconut Rice ($3):  I love coconut, so this was something I needed to order, but after eating this rice, I insist that everyone get a bowl of this on their visit.Mantao Buns ($3): Honestly, if you're going to get rice, you don't really need these.  But seriously, these buns are fluffy as fuhh.  A great substitution for rice, for anyone trying to change it up.Green Papaya Salad ($13):  A great side salad (a MUST in my opinion).  Fish sauce wasn't overwhelming and added a contrast to the sweetness of the papaya/taro and the smokiness of the chicken.Sizzling Sisig ($15):  A great rendition of the classic filipino sisig.  Naturally, sisig is eaten amongst a group a friends having drinks (beer) so grab a beer and enjoy this dish to the fullest!  Also, eat these fast! Their ""flavor factor"" drops exponentially the cooler they get.  Eat em when they're hot, or hot them eat they're when em.  ???Khao Soi ($16):  BEWARE the Khao Soi they say; ""how spicy can this be?""-1st bite: woah this is noms!-2nd bite: not too bad, it's only a little kick.-3rd bite: damn did I bite a pepper?-rest of the bites: shit it's so good but so hot, I can't NOT eat this!The point is, the spice creeps up on you, but its absolutely delicious.  Unfortunately for the sensitive tongues out there, they don't have a ""Mild"" option for this dish. Shan Noodles ($16):  If you aren't down with the spiciness of the Khao Soi, this dish would be the alternative.  Perfectly cooked noodles packed with flavor!Bun Bo Nam Bo ($16):  No idea what to expect from this dish, but the beef was super tender, and it was served over some rice noodles that soaked up all the beef juices.  This was gave me more a Vietnamese feel. Me likey.Powdered Sugar Donuts ($8 Brunch):  For this dish, they used the Mantao Buns, powdered them up and served them up with a delicious pandan cream sauce.  Heavenly!Ricotta Donuts ($8):  These donuts on the other hand, were made with a different dough, and this was served with a kalamansi (filipino lime) custard which again, heavenly!Halo-Halo ($8):  This traditional filipino dessert - translated to ""Mix-Mix"" - wasn't 100% authentic.  But it was one of the best I've ever had.  The Ube ice cream was so rich and flavorful, and had that graininess I enjoy when I eat ube (purple yam) desserts.  I also really appreciated the topping of pinipig (immature glutinous rice) which is usually added to other filipino desserts, but it also worked for this one!Service:  Waiters are friendly, but they were just kind of... there.  The real action happens in the kitchen which is visible throughout the venue. I really suggest that you sit at the bar if there's room and watch these guys!  They're also very friendly and harmless (except for the fact that they can accidentally fling a knife your way, JK).

4.0,3/14/2016,"Been here a couple times now and P&K has consistently served top-quality Filipino food. It leans slightly on the fusion side with some Viet and Thai add-ins and a highlight on brunch food, but these variations only add to the appeal.I'm normally wary of anything that's labeled ""fusion,"" but P&K does a great job at keeping it heavy on the ""Filipino"" and light on the ""fusion"" aspect. Of the dishes I've tried, nothing has really disappointed. Flavors are always bold and dishes are filling. Here are a few favorites.SIZZLING SISIG or SIZZLING CORNED BEEF HASH:These 2 dishes are almost the same save for the meat, which is either sisig (pork head) or corned beef. The corned beef version comes with potatoes, and both are served on a hot griddle topped with a raw egg. Mix everything together once it's at the table for a perfectly indulgent combination of sizzling meat and egg. Since you mix it yourself, it's up to you how much you want to let the egg cook. Both are excellent, though I slightly prefer the corned beef version due to its inclusion of potatoes. The meat can be a little overwhelming otherwise.GRILLED PORK JOWL:Absolutely my favorite dish here. It's not pretty, but I can't get enough and haven't had anything like it. Pork jowl is thinly sliced and stir-fried with brussels sprouts, thin slivers of onions, toasted rice, lime-chili fish sauce, and herbs. The brussels sprouts are charred and SO tasty, and this is coming from someone who normally dislikes brussels sprouts. The overall dish is a well-balanced mix of tangy, salty, and fatty deliciousness. A must-order.KHAO SOI:One of the dishes that skews Thai, the Khao Soi here is one of the better ones I've had. Wavy, al dente egg noodles come in a thick red curry-based soup with coconut milk, chicken, pickled mustard greens, shallots, and fried noodles on top. It's flavorful without being too spicy and a good break from all the other heavy-on-meat dishes.Service can be a little spotty, but it's nothing to complain about. Prices are fair, and I think this is a great place to eat things family style both to keep costs down and to sample as much as possible.

The perfect amount of flavor, perfect amount of spice, everything about this place was as good as it gets...and we'll definitely come back here for more.- Coconut Rice - definitely get not just one but two orders. It's enough for four people. The rice is not too sweet, and compliments all the dishes well. no need to order plain rice in this joint.- Khao soi - I love khao soi in general..and this is one of the best i've had. It has a kick, a burst of flavor, but doesn't leave your mouth burning. - Singaporean skate chicken wings - eat it while its hot. perfectly fried, tangy, definitely get.- Special - We ordered a special of the day which was a dorado atop of their perfect papaya salad. You can taste the mesh of lemongrass the tang of lime.  I can't even describe it. I wish they had it on their regular menu- Sizzling sisig - This was good, but i personally think its overhyped. The other dishes we had were definitely better in flavor and taste. - baby friendly - it is stroller accessible but bc this place really starts picking up at dinner time, bring your child in a carrier.

5.0,3/7/2016,"Dinner starts at 5PM on the weekends. We made a last minute reservation for Sunday dinner just in case, but the restaurant itself was still pretty empty when we arrived. The restaurant is adorably decorated and I can't get enough of the logo!! Pigs are friends, but also so delicious. :9Service was quick and friendly. Their dinner menu looked a little different from the one they have online, but not drastically different. Based off of previous Yelp reviews, we decided that we had to get at least one pork dish and the coconut rice. We were indecisive about what to get because there were so many things we wanted to try, but our server sold us on the night's special: fried quails with a watercress salad. As soon as we heard that, all of our attention towards the other menu items evaporated. We ended up ordering the special and the sizzling sisig (of course) with a side of coconut rice (also a must). For the two of us, this was the perfect amount of food!The quail special ($20 for 2 whole quails halved) was sooooo good. I only wish we could grow quails to be the size of chickens because I could have eaten that much of this fried quail and still not have gotten sick of it! The meat was super flavorful and the skin was equally tasty! I liked the lime sauce with the meat, but enjoyed the meat even more on its own. I'm not sure how one goes about prepping fried quail, but P&K does it right!! My friend and I were joking about how glad we were that we were eating alone and wouldn't be judged for picking absolutely ALL of the meat off the little tiny bones.I'm guessing the sizzling sisig is one of P&K's signature dishes, and for good reason. It is delicious, and wonderfully presented! Be sure to mix in the raw egg early on though. I know this might be hard for all of those foodie photogs, but I think the whole point is to cook the egg before consumption... Don't look at the ingredients and you will feel less guilty about how many calories you are likely to be consuming in one meal. :PThe coconut rice was cooked perfectly and the sweet coconut flavor really complemented the meats and the lime based sauce that came with the quail. We couldn't get enough of it.Overall, a superb meal! I would definitely recommend making an appointment during peak brunch/dinner hours as I'm sure this place is really popular!!",3,1,2,Sherry L.,"San Francisco, CA",893,1172,889

We devoured everything and didn't leave until almost 2 hours later. The food tasted great! The pork belly was delicious and succulent (the adobo sauce was yummy).

3.0,2/29/2016,"its a pretty hip place. Its thai/filipino food but none of the chefs are Asian. We sat in the patio, which was extremely warm. There were 3 groups of Asians in the patio. I think i wouldve chose to sit at the chefs table if i could do it again to watch them cook.The service was mediocre. I disliked how the waiter touched the tip of my glass when he poured water, its unsanitary! My friend also didnt like how grumpy the waiter lookedThe bathroom is literally right next to where they cook so i didnt like thatIn terms of the food, the two most popular dishes are the sisig and the khao something. The sisig doesnt come with rice...! What kind of sisig doesnt come with rice... Ive been to so many Filipino restaurants and never has the sisig not come with rice.

4.0,2/28/2016,"Dropped by Pig and Khao for lunch on a Saturday at 12:15PM with a reservation in hand. I was seated at our table even though my two dining partners had yet to arrive, which I really appreciated. As one of my friends was running late, I also appreciated that the service staff did not rush us to place our orders at any point, despite us being seated for almost half an hour.I ordered the Grilled Pork Jowl ($13) served with brussel sprouts, toasted rice, lime-chilli fish sauce and herbs. I had high hopes for this dish, which were mostly met. It was indeed a very tasty and savory dish with tender slices of pork jowl mixed with charred pieces of brussel sprouts. The only drawback was the saltiness of the dish, which became rather overwhelming towards the end. The saltiness of the dish might have been nicely neutralized by a side serving of rice, but I hadn't opted for that.Both of my dining companions opted for the Green Papaya Salad ($13), a refreshing and rather healthy looking dish, accompanied by shreds of charred chicken, taro crisps, peanuts, herbs, fish sauce and lime juice. This was reminiscent of Thai-style papaya salad and both of them enjoyed it a lot! The salads were of a decent portion and both my friends reported feeling sufficiently full afterward.Overall, we enjoyed the tasty food served up at Pig and Khao and will be back to try the other items on their menu!",0,0,0,Jessica C.,"Manhattan, NY",4,15,0
5.0,2/25/2016,"Went here just to eat halo halo, but decided to also get the ricotta donuts with kalamansi custard, turon with salted caramel ice cream. And because of the reviews here we also tried the pork sisig. P&K's halo halo only have 7 ingredients- Ice, Milk, Banana, ube ice cream, macapuno, rice crispies and leche flan. Halo halo was great. I like their version of halo halo compared to other filipino/asian restos. Most of the filipino restaurants don't serve halo halo with bananas. Ricotta donuts with Kalamansi custard- Filipino version of the bavarian donut. This is a must try. The donuts were fluffy and was dusted with sugar but it wasn't that sweet. You can eat it as it is or dip it in the kalamansi custard-sweet and tangy/citrusy flavor. The turon was okay, but the salted caramel ice cream stole the show. Pork sisig-we were too full from our last meal, but hey, we were there already, might as well try it. Worth the hype. I mean, only few filipino restos serve decent pork sisigs.Food is great, service is great, the place is kinda small(may fit around 40 people)We'll definitely go back here and try their other dishes.",0,0,0,Ria Lalaine R.,"Briarwood, Queens, NY",24,47,16
5.0,2/25/2016,"pig out and don't have a khao, maaaaan!Pig And Khao (P&K)--casual comforty eating n booziness vibing on the former grittiness and continued trendiness of downtown's Lower East Side. the menu which tours through parts of Southeast Asia has a heavy Filipino influence, which is part of APAC (Asian Pacific). draaanks are a mix of domestic and international brews, short list of signature cocktails, short list of vinos, and a few non-alcoholic potions. had the pleasure of brunching/drunching here on a Sunday. reservations recommended, but not needed as they do take walk-ins. P&K can accommodate large-ish groups for birthdays. i'd say optimal group size is couples (dates and date night) or s/QUADs (err 4 peeps). P&K definitely works for dates, first dates, date night, boozy brunch, catchup with the squad, entertaining out-of-town family n friends who want a downtown experience without any of the attitude. the restaurant has serious flex (strength n flexibility) without trying to be show-y or annoying.the food? fatty, savory, spiced right, bold, filling. it's fur(ious) real.favorites here are 1) Sizzling Sisig (pig's head parts, chili, and an egg). the dish DOES NOT come with rice. DO order the Jasmine or bacon fried rice. necessary to round out the Sisig. this dish does come out sizzling and exhaling steamy flavor...do not burn yourself. the egg is partially cooked, so you have that silky yolkiness for egg pornographers. so raw so good. ha  2) the Bahn Xeo (deep fried crepe stuffed with bacon, shrimp, bean sprouts with a nuoc chom (sweet/salty dipping sauce on the side). basically you break up the crepe and make lettuce wrap tacos. crunchy, savory, sweet with that hit of fry fat!the menu does no wrongs as it has a lot of stretchiness for a short list of eat options. be adventurous -- get outside your comfort zone. don't be a basic brunch bish YO!draaanks? ""strawwwwng,"" but if you're trying to stay on point...go with the ""bottomless"" mimosas (FYI: bottomless doesn't mean you get to take off your pants while you imbibe. just thought i'd save you that embarrassment. HA). there are like 4 choice of mimosas--me likes mango n peach. the orange is aight. and i'm biased against lychee (i have issues). seriously though, you can't go wrong on the mimosas front for bruuunch. now here's the rub:  drinks service is slow-ish (has nothing to do with your server)...the bar area is small and it's only one person making drinks for a restaurant that is fairly large in terms of seats. the servers try to be speedy, but this won't be like you're typical brunch/drunch service where you'll be guzzling down 8-10 mimosas over the course of the meal...it will be like 4-5 max. the staff takes care of you though and will ask you if you want one more even after you paid the check. they cool, so tip them well. the restaurant itself is the epitome of laidback n chill. nice amount of light in the space without being too bright, nor too dark. just right--Attention Instagrammers, SnapChatters, etc. the main dining area has Asian influences without being kitschy. the decor embraces both its Asian-esque roots and the hipster-i-ness of the Lower East Side without it becoming too busy or clumsy. the main area has that organized chaos feel with the hustle n bustle of waitstaff, the open kitchen, a flurry of tables flush to either side of the restaurant, and raised seating overlooking the bar--cool without trying. the bar ""bar"" is in the front in a tiny left nook. the right nook is seating for folks waiting. nice touch there. the back patio/garden is covered has heat lamps n fans. this area is way more open with large picnic table like seating flush left, some two-tops, and four tops spaced on either side. this area is even more laidback with the decor mirroring its laidback appeal. the back patio would be a great area for a birthday party etc. the staff. friendly. helpful. young. energetic. will there be mistakes? sure. purposeful? no. are they quick to remedy? absolutely/YASSS. moral of the story: don't be a dick and you won't be treated like one. being uptight at this restaurant will make for a miserable morning/day/night. unwind, relax, have fun, laugh a lot--we take those things for granted too often...Pig And Khao does not take the aforementioned for granted...and ""serves"" to remind us of that fact, while slinging some seriously addictive eats and draaanks. so ::SWOOSH:: into P&K and JUST DO EAT! seewhatididtheredrops mic bc there is a legit DJ here on the reg. i out.zzz",36,30,31,Ruwan J.,"New York, NY",458,772,32909

3.0,2/23/2016,"This is a cute place, packed on this rainy day. Let me start with the good side, the halo halo dessert is great, especially the flan mixed in there. Brussels sprouts with pig jowl is another gem, flavorful for every bite. Now the ok, but not spectacular ones, sizzling sisig is a bit on the oily side, Sambal fish in banana leaf is kind of bland and serving is rather small. Khao Soi is a disappoint. The broth is a bit too spicy for me, but lacks the depth of flavor a real good khao Soi dish should have.  The crispy noodle is not crispy and the rest of noodle is just plain. Chicken is just a few pieces of chicken breast. I guess my search for a good khao Soi will have to continue. This probably should have been a 3.5 star.

3.0,2/22/2016,"My friends and I ate here yesterday and were really excited about having some Filipino food for brunch. I ordered the longganisa, 3 of my friends ordered the sisig, and one ordered the steak and eggs, and a side of longganisa as an appetizer for the table.The food was good. However, I always expect Filipino food to be served with rice, since that is how it's meant to be had, so I was confused that we had to order rice separately (maybe because it was brunch? Idk?) Either way, $12 for a longganisa entree without rice doesn't really seem worth it. That said, the service was really lacking. Three of my friends had bottomless mimosas and their glasses were always empty. They had to wait like 10 minutes every time to get it refilled. I received my entree before the app came out... then 3 more entrees came out another 15 min later, and then the last one came out another 15 min after that. So not only was it awkward to have our entrees brought out separately, but by the team we could all eat, our food was getting cold. The place was sort of busy and seemed like they had a full staff so I'm not sure what was going on. I wouldn't go back there though.

I actually think that contributed to the one-noteness of the meal.In any case, I should say the one thing we really loved was the shan noodles. They were fulfilling in every way. The longonissa sausage also really hit the spot.However the bahn xeo and grilled pork jowel, while tasty, weren't something we would probably order again.

4.0,2/17/2016,"The HYPE IS FOR REAL.For many years I have been hearing about Pig and Khao and the amazing Filipino/Asian Fusion food served here, but not until now did I FINALLY decide to chow down here. I dropped by on a Saturday evening with a group of friends as we had a large party for a friend's birthday dinner. Since we were such a large party, we had to order from a pre-fixe menu - Choice of: Two Snacks, Seven Small Plates, Three Large Plates, Three Sides, Three Desserts and all you can drink beer! Now that might not sound like a lot for 14 people, but were we in for a huge surprise by the end of the night!Prior to being seated, we waited a bit next to the entrance. As with many establishments in the LES, the restaurant was packed on that Saturday evening. There was a small waiting area to the side of the door, but our party had spilled way out of it. The interior of the restaurant seemed pretty spacious, with a grill against the wall in the middle of the restaurant. Since we were a party of 14, they seated us towards the back at a large table. There were a few other tables in this area, but our party basically took up half of the space.After we were seated, we were given plastic cups to self-serve ourselves the beer on tap. Yep you read that right. Self-service beer!  You can imagine how things can get out of hand! That was just a tad strange, but sometimes you just have to do things yourself if you want it done, right? Soon after, the meat massacre commenced! We were bombarded by dish after dish after dish coming out at a rapid pace. My recollection was a bit fuzzy by the end of the night from all of the meat I had consumed, but here are the dishes that I remembered we ordered:SNACKSRoasted Peanuts - Your typical roasted peanuts. Nothing surprised me here. However, they were that much better because I was starving!SMALL PLATESGrilled Pork Jowl - The brussels sprouts were cooked perfectly and the flavor was amazing with the mix of lime-chili, fish sauce and herbs.Sizzling Sisig - Since I've been to many restaurants in Woodside, I can't say I haven't had a better Sizzling Sisig before, but it was still very good. The runny egg was just what the sisig needed.Pork Belly Adobo - So good, but yet so little pieces. I counted 5 pieces of pork belly in total. Despite the disappointing count of pork belly, I will commend them on the amount of flavor in the bowl. The pork belly was sitting in a nice concoction of soy sauce, vinegar, szechuan peppercorns, crispy garlic and egg and each piece was so juicy.Singaporean Skate Wing - I'm not sure if I ever had skate wing before, but the fish was very soft and cooked & seasoned very well.LARGE PLATESHalf Chicken Inasal - Although some of our table complained that the chicken pieces were a bit dry, I thought otherwise. The skin was crunchy and the meat was pretty juicy here. With that said, it was probably the least favorite of the large plates still.Crispy Pata - I'm accustomed to the huge pork leg that is normally given to customers of Filipino restaurants, but the pieces were pre-cut. What's the fun in that?! We wanted to get dirty and rip the pork leg a part! Anyhow, still a must get for first-timers.BBQ Baby Back Ribs - The BEST dish of the night! Not only was it oozing bbq sauce and flavor, but the meat was falling off the bones like nothing I had ever seen. The ribs were so tender and there was no doubt some serious slow cooking went into this! Absolutely a MUST GET!DESSERTSRicotta Donuts - These little puppies were pretty plain. If it weren't for the kalamansi custard, this would be a major thumbs down.Halo Halo - I've had a lot of halo halos in my day and this was such a MASSIVE disappointment. I'm not sure if much time was spent making our Halo Halos, but from the looks of other Yelp photos, it seems we got the short end of the stick with this lackluster creation. I would love to give them a pass because other Yelp photos show a more fulfilling Halo Halo, but I just can't. The bowl literally just contained a melted scoop of Ube ice cream on top of some ice and milk. Redemption is needed here.Turon - The only dessert that was worth the money. It was maybe the best Turon I've ever had in my life! The Turon was extremely crunchy and well wrapped. The banana filling was excellent and they complimented the Turon with some salted caramel ice cream and chocolate sauce.The amount of food we received on our table was absolutely overwhelming. We were all so full by the end of the night. The service was excellent throughout the night as the food was prepared quickly, but yet tasted very fresh. The water was also refilled regularly. I have to say, it's rare when restaurants live up to the immense hype that Pig & Khao has received, but this is one of those very rare occasions. If you love Asian Fusion, more specifically Filipino food, Pig & Khao is more than worth your while. The prices are a bit steep, but like I say, it's only once so go!",1,1,3,Chris E.,"Brooklyn, NY",530,1118,9624

The Beef Rendang was my favorite and was tender. It goes well with the coconut rice. The brussel sprouts were good in the Pork Jowl, except it also got too salty once it had been sitting a bit longer in the sauce. The BBQ Baby Back Ribs and Sizzling Sisig were okay. The coconut rice was the saving grace of the meal, since it was definitely needed to combat the saltiness of the food. I would enjoy the food and flavor more if the salt was cut back by at least half.For dessert, we had Ricotta Donuts and Halo-Halo shaved ice. The donuts looks like fried dough with sugar. It came with kalamansi custard for dipping. The donuts holes were decent, but I wasn't into the tart custard itself.

First off, service for our table was super slow. We saw 3 other tables, also restaurant week patrons, come and go before we had even finished our entrees. Our appetizers took an hour to get to us.The food was alright. I found the appetizer (we all got the pork jowl app) unbalanced, a tad salty, and a bit large for an appetizer dish. There was too much brussel sprout compared to pork jowl on the dish, at least for my taste. I ordered the longanisa as my entree. The garlic rice was flavorful and delicious. And this is an issue of preference I suppose, but the longanisa was pretty salty, not the sweet style I (and my girlfriends) prefer. The champorado was a bit smaller than I expected but after everything else being so heavy, I guess it's an appropriate size. However, it was not like traditional champorado I was used to. It was pretty heavy itself, and the bit of evaporated milk splashed on top didn't help to lighten it up at all.I'm not sure if I'll come back to try their dinner menu, maybe if I'm ever craving super heavy and overly salted food.",0,0,0,Kirsten G.,"New Brunswick, NJ",121,32,1

If you've never had Filipino food and consider yourself a fan of Southeast Asian cuisine, check them out, it's got Top Chef talent to boot (shout out to contestant and P&K owner Leah Cohen, who's really done her homework with this place)! Does the thought of brunch have you jaded? Then P&K is the ultimate remedy! I'm not a big breakfast person to be honest, and I'm apprehensive about paying big bucks for lackluster French toast and watered-down drinks. P&K does have your standard breakfast items (done in a creative way), but the stars here are creative Filipino and SE Asian dishes served family style. If you want to add unlimited mimosas, it's just $15 extra.I dream about those crispy Brussel sprouts with pork jowl, and the papaya salad itself is the stuff of dreams as well. I actually really want to come back for dinner, as the menu for that meal is much more extensive. Plus the drinks look good enough for a trendy bar downtown. Oh, and did I mention how affordable this place is? I came here with 4 friends and we ordered for dishes to share. With tax and tip, my meal came down to $16--a total bargain! (Note, none of us chose the bottomless mimosas during our visit, though I can vouch they are refreshing and flavorful).

We split the khao soi, short rib and an order of coconut rice. the food was amazing and this was more than enough for two people.

The food comes out pretty quickly and the service was good. Definitely can't wait to come back. Just a note: I am usually very hungry and had trouble finishing it all.

5.0,2/2/2016,"I had this place bookmarked for nearly two years, and with good reason. P&K is the real deal: a kitchen full of imagination riffing on the still-underrated-in-New York Filipino cuisine (among others). The chef/owner is a former Top Chef contestant so I shouldn't be surprised.I made a rez for a random weekday afternoon, and it was pretty easy to secure a table at a late but still reasonable brunch hour. Of course, when we arrived there was no room for us and we had to wait 5-10 minutes, but with the quality-to-price ration here, something's gotta give.While Sisig is a must, I wanted to see what the Grilled Pork Jowl was all about, and it was worth the risk. The dish came fresh-grilled with Brussel sprouts, toasted rice, lime-chili fish sauce, herbs. Just loaded with flavor. GF had the Shan Noodles (rice noodles with ground chicken, turmeric, peanuts, fermented mustard greens). We were both happy as clams. On the sides, I ordered the jasmine rice and Longonissa sausage, which were very tasty accompaniments to the main course.Great drinks, too, with special Asian-tinged brunch cocktails and decent beers.Easily makes my list of top 10 brunches in New York.",5,2,3,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2506,1716,229

I approve) and thus it was love at first sight.I came here with a friend on a Sunday night at 9 PM because I was craving for ube and I heard a lot of good things about this restaurant.It was NYC Restaurant Week so they gave us a Restaurant Week menu but the selections didn't look good and it didn't sound like a great deal so we opted out and ordered from the regular menu instead.We ordered the classics: Sizzling Sisig (fantastic--I love the sourness of the lime with the fatty pork), Khao Soi (it was spicy, even my KOREAN friend couldn't handle it), Coconut Rice (best rice I've ever had omgggggg it is anything but basic and this is coming from an Asian who grew up eating rice everyday), and a Halo Halo (so delicious and big-- we couldn't finish it!)The only thing I wasn't very fond of is the location. I take the subway everywhere but this place isn't very convenient to get to if you rely heavily on the train like me, especially during the weekends when the schedules are irregular. So we had to take Uber here... since it was the day after Winter Storm JonasOther than that, it was a great experience.Oh, and the next day, both my friend and I got a stomachache... But that's probably because we weren't that used to eating ethnic food (it took my stomach a year to get immune to The Halal Guys...

4.0,1/26/2016,"My friend and I had dinner here last night as part of Restaurant Week. I thought it was a great deal because the portions were extremely plentiful! Their Restaurant Week menu includes a snack to share, appetizer, entree, dessert, and a side of either jasmine or coconut rice. Here is what we ordered:Snack: ChicharronAppetizer: Her: Burmese eggplant salad / Me: Grilled Pork JowlEntree: Her: Khao Soi / Me: Shan NoodlesDessert: Her: Ricotta Donuts / Me: TuronSide: Coconut Rice for each of us Overall, the food was really good! To me, the standouts were the chicharron (it came with a yummy lime sauce), the pork jowl (perfectly cooked and came with brussels sprouts and onions) and the ricotta donuts--these were simply PERFECT. The texture and flavor and ricotta dip was all just amazing. I was seriously surprised at how good these were. Get these donuts!! The coconut rice was also insanely delicious and came in big bowls. We were too full to eat much of it so I took both of them home! Both the Khao Soi and Shan Noodles were tasty but I actually enjoyed the other parts of the meal more. The Khao Soi was pretty spicy and the Shan Noodles could have used more spice. I squeezed some lime on them and that made them better. Again, I was impressed by the portions of everything--I hate it when Restaurant Week portions are tiny! I'd like to have tried the ribs and somewhat regretted my choice of entree though. The ambiance is fun and relaxed, and they have a large covered backyard. It's not too loud and everyone is full of smiles and super friendly. However, we were seated right by the bathroom, at a dark and extremely cramped table in the corner, and kind of hidden by the bar. We also weren't able to sit across from each other because one of the chairs would have been blocking the bathroom door. I ended up sitting at the end and awkwardly facing other diners. It took us a few minutes just to get seated and situate our coats and purses in the small space. The three tables lining the back are also VERY close to each other. We almost requested to move to the backyard (it's covered and heated), but decided to stay in the end. I think they should just eliminate this table though.Service was great up until towards the end of our meal, but to be fair, it seemed like our waiter was covering quite a few tables, both in the main area and in the backyard. He was very friendly and was great for most of the meal. My only complaint was that it took a while for him to see that we were done with our entrees, but when he came over to clear the table for dessert, he offered us each a glass of whiskey as compensation for sitting at that little table! He came back with, again, two generous glasses of whiskey! This totally made up for it. I had a great meal here and it's totally worth it for Restaurant Week!",3,0,1,Elizabeth C.,"Brooklyn, NY",312,147,1088
5.0,1/25/2016,"I love Leah Cohen's style! Though, I may be biased because I'm a child of the 90's and love Southeast Asian cuisine. Both the atmosphere, she has created with her husband, here at P&K with the decor and music as well as the delicious dishes she has dreamed up, make every visit I've had to date a win.Generally I visit here with friends, allowing us to order a number of dishes and share. Which, imo, is the best way to experience P&K. If you are coming here and ordering just one dish, you're doing it wrong.I really enjoy the fact that, unlike most fusion spots, the dishes here really benefit from the borrowing of flavors from both cuisines. Also, it probably has something to do with the fact that there is no skimping with the ingredients or spices here. I've yet to have a dish that was lacking or bland in any way.LES is lucky to have such a solid spot to eat and chill with friends!",0,0,0,Travis L.,"Seattle, WA",51,366,73

Have come several times, and have always been seated immediately, even without a reservation (if you're seated at the bar, beware, it gets SUPER hot)My favorite BY FAR is the Khao Soi, which is the tastiest red curry dish I've had in quite some time. The portion is also pretty big, so I can usually have it for the next day's lunch, as well.  When we've gone the shared small plates route, other favorites have been the Grilled Pork Jowl and Sizzling Sisig.

I got the sisig and a side of rice and for dessert I got the Halo Halo. Wow, I was disappointed. We had to wait a long time to get a seat, and we even got seated by the bar which sucked for having to wait forever. The music here was way too loud and the atmosphere was way too messy and over the top. I hate places where people and music are loud and obnoxious. The waiter did not seem to really care about us either. Anyway, I was hoping I could like this place more when the food came out. But I was wrong. The sisig tasted horrible. It was greasy and just looked disgusting. I would never order this again. It smelt disgusting too! I really was so disappointed.... Way too salty as well. The Halo Halo looked so intriguing and I was beyond excited for this and hoped for the best. However, it failed. It was tasteless and soup like. I was expecting some kind of a stinger flavor, but it did not give me that. After all the food, I felt sick too.

3.0,1/12/2016,"I would give this place a 3.5 (the stars are for the food and not so much for the service and setting/atmosphere). This place is located on a not bustling Clinton Street. We got here on a Tuesday evening around 8 pm, and we didn't have to wait to get a seat. The food is cooked off to the side in the center of the restaurant. The service here did not stand out; they didn't seem to really care about the dining experience and didn't give us any specials or tid bits of knowledge on the place. However, our water was always filled. Another negative - this place is loud - very hard to hear your conversations because of a mixture of noise from other diners and the music. I was not in the mood for that.On to the good stuff: the food. The two dishes we ordered were great. We ordered the eggplant salad ($13), which was indeed a ""small' plate. It came with some Asian chips to scoop it up. The eggplant was cut in small slices and mixed with a lot of cilantro, onions and peanuts (among other things, I'm sure). The taste of cilantro was pretty strong. The Seafood Sinigang ($29) was excellent - the seafood was very fresh and tasty, even the whitefish, which sometimes is tasteless in broths. It had a mixture of fix, shrimp, mussels, green beans, tomatoes, onions and okra. I do wonder if the dishes on the menu are all ""one note"" but we didn't order enough to know. I peeked over at other diners' food and the pork dishes looked quite good. I also heard some exclamations about the coconut rice.

3.0,1/7/2016,"Tiny, very tiny drinks.  Order a martini and you'll get a gin and tonic, and a very tiny one.  In a large thimble.  At least my drink had gin, although not the rather popular brand that I preferred, but at least a potable gin.  I know this to be true, because I did, and I didn't get even a passable gin and tonic.  Such a poorly staffed and ill-equipped bar, and stingy portions, cost Pig and Khao one star in this review.The owners' devotion to ambiance can be seen only roughly in their online photos, which show clearly wretched-green walls with exposed electrical conduits.  They operate a loud sound system that was turned up so loud that Pig and Khao's front room staff had to speak very loudly over the music just to communicate with each other.  At least we weren't alone in speaking loudly.  The music was a disconcerting blend of reggae, hip-hop and rap selected from different decades, but containing enough profanity to do right by any club's dj.  The problem was that Pig and Khao does not bill itself as a club, but as a restaurant.  That cost Pig and Khao another star.But the meal was quite satisfying.  Neither the regrettable bar nor the industrial setting prepared us for what proved to be a delicious meal, well seasoned and humanly portioned (too much for a supermodel and too little for an NFL player).  Two of us shared 2 small plates and one large one.  Will we return?  Definitely after Pig and Khao leaves this location and a better restaurant replaces it.  Maybe we will return to Pig and Khao when we want to take a chance on a Pig-In-A-Poke, which is what the restaurant should be named.",0,1,0,Vir G.,"New York, NY",0,20,0

3.0,1/1/2016,"It's not that this place is all hype; there were High points to our meal.  The eggplant dish was novel, but there was maybe 6 tablespoons of it.  The crunchy shrimp chips were a wonderful foil to the eggplant, but again, it was a meager serving.  The  majority of what we ate was good (particularly the pork belly; wow, the crust was perfection!), but what I realized mid point during the meal was that the flavors were unbalanced:  the coconut rice was so sweet that it couldn't  complement any dish; particularly not the skate, which was over salted.  SE Asian food has a strong flavor profile.  The coconut rice could've been a clever addition, but as is, better serves as a dessert.Actually, the entire experience was off:  conversation was hampered by the loud hip hop music, the waiter cleared the table only at the end so that we had to pile plates/bowls on top of each other, the space was so cramped, there was a long delay for the latter half of our meal...With a lower price point, I would not complain about any of this.  But this restaurant sets certain expectations, and came short on the execution.",4,1,1,Lan N.,"Wichita, KS",46,703,52

There is a small small bathroom.  It is slightly dirty. The service was poor. The food came at an adequate pace, however the tables were too small to fit the dishes. Furthermore, the waitstaff would not clear the dishes after we were done. I would also have to constantly ask for refills on our drinks.  Near the end of our meal, we had plates stacked on top of plates and bowls on top of bowls to try to make room.The first thing I tried was the eggplant salad. It cost $13 and you get a small saucer's worth of eggplant. Additionally, they fried up some small shrimp chips for you.Next, we try the papaya salad. The portion was larger than the eggplant salad. The flavor was lacking, but the texture had a nice crunch. Then, we tried the khao soi. It was tasty, but the portions were meagerly. As sides, we ordered the coconut rice and the Mantao buns. Both of these were delicious. Next, we tried the Shan noodles. It was okay. Nothing to brag about. The portion size was alright. Later came the pork belly. The pork belly sauce and flavor were great. They gave five pieces of pork and an undercooked egg. Finally, when we thought we were done, the Singaporean skate came out. This was a pretty good dish, but a bit salty. We did not stay for dessert. The bill for 5 people came to about $150 with two alcoholic beverages. But, some of us were still hungry afterwards. I would not return to here to eat.

Not amazing but really good if you have a pork craving you cant fix. I wish i had sat at a table and not watch the kitchen staff do what kitchen staff do which is get frustrated and angry.

I was waiting for company and so I ordered coconut juice and pork belly Adobo. As my company came, she ordered the coconut drink as well. The drink was great and it came with sugarcane, which you can bite into. When you finish your drink they told us that they can cut it open for us if we want the coconut meat, which we did. The pork belly Adobo is a MUST because the texture of the skin is a nice crispy while the meat is soft like it was braised. Other things we ordered is the Singaporean skate wing, thinly sliced Pork Jowl with Brussel sprouts, coconut rice, and halo-halo. Singaporean skate wing was great, it had a nice flavor to it. Thinly sliced Pork Jowl with Brussel sprouts can use more pork Jowl,  but good job on the Brussel sprouts.Coconut Rice is a MUST. It taste so good you could just eat that. Halo-halo is a lighter version than the typical Halo-halo. Definitely cleanses the palate.

I'm not a huge pork fan so I actually enjoyed the other dishes more - brussel sprouts dish and the lentils small plate. I'm no food critic, but I'm sure they would be happy with the creativity and crazy flavors of some of the dishes. If you're coming here to try as many dishes as possible, I would just order all the small plates. That's what I ended up doing to taste test the different options!

It was sick watching her in her kitchen taste testing and checking the quality of the food before sending them out. With that said, it's a popular joint, so come early or at least make a reservation.

Passed by this place multiple times and finally went in on a late Sunday afternoon. It was 3pm and the indoor seating was still packed. The heated patio was clearing out though, so we were able to get seated right away. The outdoor patio was significantly quieter than the inside, which was nice for us to have conversation. We got two noodle bowls and a meat dish to share between the four of us. Shan Noodles - this came out first and fired up our mouths. If you're someone who can only handle mild or slight spice, this will get pretty hot. Delicious flavors though, so worth the slight pain. Khao Soi - my favorite of the two noodles we got. If you like coconut curry this is delicious. The egg noodles also add nice texture because there is more of a bite to it. Sizzling Sisig - I was so stuffed by the time this came out, but from the couple bites I did have it was yummy and not too salty. When I read it was a pig's head I was honestly expecting a pig's head, but I guess it's good that they just give you the meat. Makes it easier to eat.  The waiter was super nice and attentive. He gave us a new bowl for each noodle dish we shared and was good on refilling water, which some of us downed because of the heat.

The Singaporean Skate Wing was a tiny bit to spicy for me even tho I don't mind spicy but that was super hot. To end it we had a Halo-Halo dessert to cool us down.Service was prompt and a tad slow but it's expected since it was a full house. We had a 10 minute wait time when we walked in.

5.0,12/10/2015,"I came here for brunch on a whim, and I'm so glad I did. Let's talk about the food. That's why you're reading this, right? They do Filipino-Thai fusion. I love both. We got: - Horchata Iced Coffee: I mainly got this because of the Horchata part of it. I can't say that the coffee was that strong but man, this was delicious. Why hasn't anyone done this sooner?!- Sizzling Sisig: for those of you who don't know, Sisig is food meant to be the Filipino equivalent of bar food - you have this with your beers. So of course it's flavorful, fatty and addicting. I generally eat this with rice to balance out the saltiness. It's served so hot that you can cook an egg in it, and mixing it in is my favorite part. - Sizzling Corn Beef Hash: maybe it's just me, but I feel like this is a brunch staple. It was overshadowed by the Sisig, but only because the dishes were so similar - served in a hot cast iron pan and topped with an egg. No complaints. - Sides of garlic fried rice: I loooove garlic fried rice. Who needs veggies in their fried rice anyway? Not I. Makes for a perfect compliment for any of the main dishes. - Papaya salad: I don't typically go for this at restaurants, but it proved to be a nice refresher. Served with taro root and chicken mixed in. It rounded out the meal with a fresh taste. - Doughnuts with Pandan: the star of this dish is that green Pandan pudding-like sauce. I'm not quite sure what Pandan is, or how to describe it other than sweet and delicious. I've seen similar desserts (but with pieces of bread and  a matcha pudding-like sauce). The doughnuts are served hot and fresh, but reminded me more of bread rolls than doughnuts. Either way, it was a great vessel for getting all that Pandan. This place has a very laid back, homey vibe. It's pretty small, so you might find yourself sitting a little close to your neighbor. We sat at the bar, which offers a view of the chefs as they prepare your meal. That made our experience that much more enjoyable - there's something about prepping and cooking being done right in front of me that puts me in a little bit of a trance. Okay, maybe not a trance, but I do like watching it happen. Service was great! Sitting at the bar, there's not so much room for your food. But no matter - the staff cleared off everything in a timely manner, made sure our waters were filled and were around to help us out if we wanted to put in additional orders. (May or may not have something to do with being able to see the chefs making all those delicious dishes.)l",4,0,4,Michelle B.,"Brooklyn, NY",446,352,1499
4.0,12/10/2015,"Went here with a large group - 8 people. First off they were able to accommodate a party of 8 with a day's notice - a plus! They said we'd have to be outside in back but that there was a tent with heat lamps. Due to the unseasonably warm weather I figured there wasn't a huge risk. Turns out even if it were freezing out I think it would be fine. It basically indoors. In case you forgot, there were 8 of us. There are 12 small plates on the menu so we figured we'd get started with one of each and then I demanded a short rib rendang. If we needed more, we'd order more. Turns out no more was needed - the 12 small plates + the rendang was more than enough for all of us, we actually didn't even finish everything. There's are tapas restaurant sized small plates, actually quite generous. We just passed everything around and I honestly barely even knew what I was eating because there was so much going on, but we all liked everything. I'd order things again if I knew what they were.

4.0,12/6/2015,"Prepare your eating pants (the stretchy ones!) before you come to Pig and Khao! Their food is so heavy, rich, and fatty and it'll leave you groaning from food coma by the end of your meal.I came here on a Saturday night and got a seat at the bar immediately. I don't recommend sitting here unless you're okay with smelling very strongly of Filipino food for the rest of the night. Apparently the back patio is enclosed and has heat lamps, so I wish I had asked for seating out there instead.P&K has a $15 bottomless draft of Yuengling deal that was oh-so-tempting, but I passed up and got a San Miguel instead. My friend and I ordered the Pork Belly Adobo and the Sizzling Sisig, and surprisingly, these 'small' dishes were enough to fill up the both of us. I strongly recommend ordering a side of rice to go along with the meal. The flavors in both dishes are pretty strong and oily and they're not easy to eat on their own unless you've got a belly of steel. The Pork Belly has an amazing texture; soft and fatty for the most part, but with a delicious crunch on top. The sizzling sisig was very good, too, and you should definitely squeeze the lime all over it to get a refreshing burst of citrus in between bites.For how full I was after, P&K is pretty reasonable in price and served up an amazing meal.

Every dish is great for sharing and delicious - the only comment on the food is that the large plates, such as the BBQ baby back ribs were smaller than expected and was not very shareable for our group of 10.

We put the sauce over the rice and it was a perfect combo.Shan Noodles $16 - Delicious and packed with flavor. It reminded me of a spicy Vietnamese Pho noodle. Good for two.Chicken Wings $12 - This dish was the daily special offered by our waitress. The wings had sweet/spicy skin. Beware of the peppers. They are dangerously hot.Sizzling Sisig $15 - The sisig is my favorite dish when coming to P&K. The sisig is served on a sizzling platter with a strong, delicious aroma. Mixing the raw egg into the crispy sisig made the dish so tasty! This is a greasy and oil dish.Coconut Rice $3 - The coconut rice is super sweet. The bowl is big and can be shared between two people. The salty/greasy sisig pairs well with the coconut rice. BBQ Ribs $25 - Smokey, burnt, and pricey for what you get. I'll pass on this next time.Chicken Inasal $22 - Most of the pieces came out charred and burnt so we left pieces untouched. Chicken was dry without the sauce.

4.0,11/14/2015,"This place overall is pretty nice. I enjoyed the food here and the atmosphere. The food was a bit salty for me tho. However, it does go well with rice. Speaking of rice, I absolutely love their coconut rice. It really taste like coconut rather than just smell like it. So for drinks we ordered the Lucky Buddha and Sweet and sour cilantro soda. For appetizer, we ordered the chicharron. For the main course, we ordered the sizzling sissig and grilled Pork jowl. Lastly, for dessert the halo halo. So the Lucky buddha was basically just a beer but in a buddha shaped  bottle. It looked pretty cute and the beer was more of a light ale beer. The cilantro soda, I added some gin for  $6 extra and it basically tasted like a mojito (not bad). The appetizer was 4 dollars for a small rice bowl of chicharon. It tasted pretty fresh as in they probably did fry it themselves. The grilled Pork jowl had fried Brussel sprouts and pork belly slice. I actually liked the Brussel sprouts more than the pork. It was a bit oily but it tasted good. The sizzling sissig was good too but a bit too salty. It goes very well with rice. Even tho I ate it with rice, it was still a bit too salty for my liking. Then the cook comes over and hands us a bowl of curry noodles and we were just a little puzzled. We were just thinking ok maybe it just comes with whatever we ordered. So we tried it. It was crispy fried noodles on too and with egg noodles on the bottom. The curry had bits and pieces of chicken and some veges. The curry was very spicy but I liked it. Mins later, a waitress comes over and tells us they gave us the order by accident and told us it was the Khao soi and it was on the house. I looked at the menu to see what it was and it was red curry with chicken and it was $16. It's a bit pricey, in my opinion, for just a whole bunch of noodles and and some curry sauce with tiny bits of chicken. Well since it was free, I'm not complaining. We were actually pretty full and didn't really finish the noodles. Well, my friend didn't eat much of it since it was too spicy. Despite that, there's always room for dessert. We ordered the Halo halo and I really liked it. It had shaved ice with coconut milk topped with taro ice cream and condense milk drizzled on top. Under the ice there were bits of granola, some pieces of flan, and some potato like pieces. I didn't really like the potato like pieces because it tasted like potato in the beginning but after biting into it, it had a sour after taste. Besides for the potato pieces, the halo halo was good. Another thing I wanted to mention about this place, is the fact that it felt like a Chinese restaurant. This is because all their dishes, plates, and disposable chopsticks, were the same ones they use in Chinese restaurants. In conclusion, I'd definitely come back here since the food was decent and price was reasonable. Next time, I'd probably request for less salt in the dishes tho.",1,1,1,Grace C.,"New York, NY",559,167,858

Here's the breakdown by stars:Food: 3.5 StarsService: 3 StarsVibes: 4 StarsI know the math doesn't average out to four but I'll round up for P&K,First of all: bottomless mimosas are $15. You cannot find that in any city, let alone New York. If you come here just for that reason, I would not judge you. The lychee is probably my favorite out of the wide selection that they have. But it somehow takes a while for you to get a mimosas. Not exactly sure why.It's this Filipino/Vietnamese fushion.. so be warned -- authenticity is not prime here. But it's good. We got a variety of dishes for our large party of ten. There were so many things it was hard to narrow down what was the absolute standout. Tip: Don't get the steak and eggs. It's kinda basic. Stick with sisig. Here's the best thing about this place: THE MUSIC. Hip hop everywhere. It's great. Yes, I would like to hear Usher, Nas, DMX, Pac, etc during my brunch. This should be standard.I'd recommend coming here for brunch. It's more of a family style, at least four people in your party kind of spot.

I also see that everyone ordered the sizzling sisig on Yelp so I decided to try it out and it was greasy and burnt almost taste like burnt food that was scrapped off a wok. I've just wasted $15 on burnt fat when I could have used it on something else. Everything was so greasy here I had an upset stomach the next day. 3 dishes came up to $60 for 2 people.

4.0,11/4/2015,"I think that Pig and Khao is practically unclassifiable as far as restaurants are concerned - a very broad label of ""southeast Asian fusion"" mostly works though. In any case the food on whole is very good. Highlights definitely include the Burmese Eggplant Salad (basically like an Asian baba ganoush) and the Pork Belly Adobo. It was perhaps some of the best pork belly I've ever had - crunchy and full of flavor. The Market Vegetable was also surprisingly good. The waiter will steer you towards the Sizzling Sisig, which is tasty for the first few bites, but it's so heavy that it's really hard to finish the whole dish. It really has to be eaten with rice, or else it just ends up being far too salty and fatty.Apart from the Sisig, all of the small plates are portioned and balanced well enough that you could make a whole meat out of them without ever even getting a large plate.

(I'd expected something a bit sweeter, more like Chinese sausage.)The Shan noodles were tasty; I only tried a bit because I was so full by that point, but I think I'll probably order it next time.The Vietnamese-style coffee was scrumptious and really hit the spot.We'll be back to try out everything else on the menu.",0,0,0,Gillian C.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,88,1

2.0,10/26/2015,"When we arrived for our reservations the place was pretty empty but within half an hour it was unbelievably crowded, so it was definitely a good thing we'd gotten reservations. Initially we were planning on having the tasting menu, but turns out that's only available Monday-Thursday. I proceeded to rack my memory for everything I'd read previously on Yelp, which led us to ordering the sizzling sisig, green papaya salad, and the grilled sirloin with a side of jasmine rice. We would've gotten tea, but for some reason they were out? So I wound up getting a coconut water and my boyfriend had a cilantro soda. The waiter was actually a bit aggressive about wanting us to add alcohol to these, but we both weren't in the mood.As we sat there we were actually pretty excited, the food at the tables around us looked delicious and everyone seemed to be having a great time. The vibe of the restaurant was actually very upbeat and made the wait for our food fly by. The dishes came out in an interesting manner. Although they were all classified as appetizers they each came out like a different course of a meal. My boyfriend and I actually enjoyed this, gave us more of a break between dishes and more time to chat and relax. First we received the green papaya salad. I'm not sure if this is the Filipino style of green papaya salad (is there such a thing?) but it was SUPER sour. I think they'd put too much fish sauce and lime. The one's back home in Thailand are far more nuanced. I wound up having to shovel (overcooked) rice in my mouth to combat the tartness. I will say the chicken that accompanied was very delicious. It was moist and perfectly grilled, reminded me of the chicken skewers I can get from street vendors in Thailand. The grilled sirloin was a beautiful color, but the meat itself was incredibly tough and chewy. It also had little to no flavor. I would've used the Isaan sauce that accompanied, but that stuff was SPICY. I couldn't handle more than a drop. The dish was meant to be eaten with a cabbage wrap, so that's what we wound up doing. A slice of the meat, some rice, and a little bit of the papaya salad made for a decent bite. The cabbage to meat ratio was a bit off however and we wound up left with too much chewy meat to comfortably eat. The last thing we had was the sizzling sisig, and once it arrived to us I could barely contain myself. It looked beautiful. A gorgeous egg resting atop some beautifully diced meat that sizzles and sings. I was actually SO excited to try this, just from an aesthetic standpoint it looked like it would knock our other dishes out of the water, but boy was I WRONG. It was fatty, charred, salty, and greasy all at the same time. I wound up drinking three glasses of water and completely finishing my coconut to combat the level of dehydration I was experiencing from the amount of sodium in this dish. I gave up on eating at one point and wound up scooping out the flesh of my coconut to cleanse my palate and give my body a salt break. I asked for a couple limes to try and brighten the dish up, but it didn't help. The sizzling sisig wound up being the least tasty thing we had at Pig and Khao and we left a large portion of it uneaten. Maybe we just went on a bad night, but I was not impressed with Pig and Khao at all. I'd heard so many good things but the establishment didn't deliver at all. I don't think I would return or recommend it to a friend. The most pleasant thing I had the entire meal was my coconut water, and that is NOT a good sign.

My favorite dishes?All the dishes with pig in it!Sit in the patio. They close the windows in the winter and surround the benches with heat lamps. The patio is filled with beautiful modern/graffiti inspired art.We had: -Pig jowl with roasted Brussels sprouts. Sweet salty roasted brussels sprouts can never go wrong. Especially with fatty grilled jowl and lime fish sauce. Very good. Slightly salty.- Coconut rice. slightly sweet rice, soft and perfectly cooked. -Pork belly adobo. I could not taste the vinegar in the adobo but it was perfectly fatty crisp pork belly with a poached egg and delicious green sauce.- Sizzling sisig. Pork head cooked with chili and whole egg. Served sizzling hot on a cast iron pan, I loved this dish. The noise, the splattering sound of the fat, the half cooked egg. The springy chewiness in the slices of cartilaginous pig's head. -Crispy PataDeep Fried pig leg with liver and vinegar sauce.Loved that liver sauce. So rich and flavorful.And that Pata! So crunchy! Slightly salty. the crackling was perfect. You can eat a horizontal slice of the leg and it's so crispy that the bones crunch.-Vietnamese Carmel Fish.This dish was ok. The sauce was too salty.

4.0,10/3/2015,"4.5 stars. I can't believe I haven't tried this place until now. Came here for a late dinner (around 8:45/9 pm) and had a phenomenal experience. From the ambience to the food to the service, everything was on point. Ambience: Right when you walk in, you are hit with an absolutely delicious wave of smells, which is just immediately enticing. The space is pretty small so a reservation to be safe would probably be good. You can see the chefs cooking right in front of the small bar in the back. It is intimate and not too loud-perfect for a date or a close group of friends. Food: Oh man definitely the best part. We ordered the classic sizzling sisig (if you eat pork you MUST try this): the little pieces just melted in my mouth. Some were more tender and some were these surprising bursts of crunchiness. The egg that got mixed in also added to the savoriness. This was definitely my favorite dish of the night. We also tried the chicken wings special, which was fantastic as well. They had a distinctly Southeast Asian taste but were a little bit sweeter. I detected what tasted like coconut, which gave them a more distinct flavor. Finally, I had made reservations through a program named SELECT, so we received a complimentary small plate (chef's choice), which ended up being the pork belly. I don't even normally like pork belly, but this dish was surprisingly good. It was intensely flavorful and I liked the interplay between the crunchy and chewier parts of the meat. It was definitely on the salty side though. In terms of portions, the small plates are actually quite generous. For two people, I would definitely say 3 small plates is more than enough. There's a lot of meat in many of the dishes so that really fills you up.Service was fast, friendly, and efficient. Loved how easy it was to redeem the deal I mentioned and everything went smoothly throughout the night. Overall, this place is definitely a unique experience. The food is not something you can find anywhere any day. Definitely try it out if you're not afraid of pork, strong flavors, and creative fusion.

1.0,9/26/2015,"Terrible. Just terrible. If I could give this place 0 stars I would. First, I need to premise this by saying that I am Filipino, and while I understand this is a fusion restaurant (and I didnt order a Filipino dish) the whole experience was horrible. Came in for brunch at about 3pm. Last order was at 330pm, felt rushed by the waiter to place an order. They have bottomless mimosas, he recommended that we did not get that since last order was 330pm (although that doesnt exactly mean they were closing at 330pm, I suppose he just wanted his break asap). So whatever, we just got 2 mimosas each at $8 a glass. Now for the food. Embarrassing and literally INEDIBLE. My bf ordered the longanisa. As I mentioned I am Filipino, and literally everything is always served with rice. He got the plate-- a pathetic few pieces of longanisa, a fried egg and a small tomato salad-- no rice. For $12. Even by NYC standards, this was ridiculous for the amount of food on the plate, and how pathetic the whole thing looked. I ordered the brioche french toast. It was supposed to be served with whipped cream.  I asked the waiter for no whipped cream. I get the plate, and of course its covered in whipped cream. Whatever, I just scrape it off. But then I try to eat it, and its literally inedible. First of all, its SOGGY. It DOUSED in syrup, and there is NO flavor except for sugar. The most disgusting french toast I have tasted in my life. I literally ate 4 bites, hid the rest in my napkin, and pushed it all to one side of my plate. I honestly just wanted to gtf out of there. The whole meal was $46 with tip. I felt so upset that I had to pay this ridiculous amount for a terrible meal. Ive lived in NYC for many years, eat out most days of the week, and never have I been so disgusted and disappointed by a meal. Thats quite a statement, but all truth for this place. I would recommend that the owner/chefs seriously reconsider what they are serving and putting in front of their customers. Ridiculous.",3,0,1,K R.,"New York, NY",2,223,191
2.0,9/23/2015,"First thing that comes to mind about Pig and Khao is salt!  Everything we ordered was just so salty, we almost drowned in the water we had to drink.  This was a restaurant we've wanted to try for a long time due to its popularity on Facebook and Yelp. Why, oh why, do so many Filipino restaurants in the city continue to disappoint?There was sizzling sigsig, bun bo nam bo, and half chicken inasal followed by the halo halo dessert.  We were lucky to come before the big crowds so our food came fast and hot, +1.  Then the sigsig came with so much promise in delivery, smell, and texture.  But from the first bite, the salt was just overwhelming and we couldn't get over it.  The bun bo nam bo, which I think is a mix of Vietnamese, was small though tasty.  The bowl didn't look like a lot but once mixed up, it was a decent portion for one person. Though sadly, again, it was quite salty.  Lastly came the chicken special for the day.  Very crispy and not dry, but small in size and salty in flavor, again.  The only thing that wasn't overly salted was the halo halo.  I'm hoping we caught them on a bad night since that many reviews and positive feedback can't all be wrong!  However, it'll take a lot for us to come back here.  Another over priced, overrated Filipino in the city that just didn't live up to the hype.",0,1,0,Leila L.,"Brooklyn, NY",123,422,720
3.0,9/21/2015,"We arrived and were able to get a table in the back patio.  The restaurant was narrow in space but there were plenty of tables and a full bar.  The back patio added additional seating and was more ""open"" in concept than the dark seating area inside.  The dishes were hit or miss with the flavors.  I ordered the green papaya salad (was the best dish and also the most heat intense) - nice co-mingling of exotic flavors, didn't have enough chicken for me, but the veggies were crisp and was saturated in the flavor palate one would expect from Asian cuisine.  I also ordered the Shan Noodles dish which was  pretty bland compared to the salad.  Wouldn't order it again but it was filling with the noodles and the nuts.My companion ordered the Pork Belly Adobo, I believe.  The pork belly with the pieces of fat was a combination of pork skin & braised pork in slabs, very tender and concentrated flavor.  She also ordered the Sizzling Sisig which I thought was pretty good with an order of Jasmine rice.  I think I was missing salt & pepper or something.  And the fact that you cooked the rest of the dish on the sizzling plate, there wasn't enough heat on our end to really cook the egg as we'd wished.  I guess I was looking for more of a hard scramble rather than soft.  Wasn't intense in flavor as well but I like the contrast of the pork belly which had crunchy pieces as well as the chewy pieces. For beverage, I ordered a Coconut water (which came in a coconut).  Glad that I did b/c the salad set my mouth ablaze and I'm sure anything else would have exacerbated the flames...I'm a soft touch when it comes to spicy food so that was a good way to make sure I would be able to at least stay in the game for the duration of the meal.  My companion ordered the Mr. Horchata which she said was very tasty.   Wasn't able to stay and have a dessert, I kind of tapped out after the noodles and she's not a dessert fan so, I can't really comment on any of those items.",0,0,0,Kamara H.,"Manhattan, NY",2,13,0

The vibe here is very chill and laid back and the music had this smooth hip hop playlist going WHICH I LOVED.

And the coconut rice, while not Filipino, had the right amount of sweetness to balance out the savory and fattiness.But I have to admit. That grilled pork jowl with sprouts (yes, we got pig face done two ways) was bright, salty, and had a hint of bitterness thanks to the sprouts.

Honestly, this was a blessing because sitting at the bar was awesome! We were able to watch the chefs work their magic. For decoration, the restaurant ambiance is casual hipster and has a fun playlist playing in the background. The kitchen is completely open but not smoky, which I would expect from cooking Asian food. The bar and walls are decorated with a ton of Asian art, from tiny elephant sculptures to a dragon.As for the food, this was the real highlight.

All of the dishes are meant to be shared family style so we started off with the Chicharron appetizer. The Chicharron came with a side of vinegar to dip. The Chicharron itself was light, crunchy and flavorful. The first dish we ordered was the Sizzling Sisig which is pork meat with an egg sunny side up. The meat was alright but I didn't think it was anything special. This dish however came with a side of coconut rice and it was sooo good. I've had coconut rice before but never this good. The last dish we ordered was the Khao Soi. This dish was my favorite because it had the most flavor. Khao Soi has curry with coconut milk, chicken topped with egg noodle. With the leftover coconut rice, I mixed the curry together to create the perfect combo. Although this dishes we ordered was plenty for two, we had to get dessert and shared the Halo Halo.

Couldn't really taste the peppercorn or crispy garlic but this was probably the best dish of the night. Sizzling sisig was alright. It had some fatty pieces that we chose not to eat. It was a little on the salty side but the coconut rice balanced it out really well. One of the specials of the night was a prawn dish. It came with three prawns and a spicy dipping sauce. The sauce had a lot of flavor and tasted great with the coconut rice.I ordered the spicy pakwan drink and it sure lived up to its name of being spicy. However, I was disappointed that it barely got me buzzed.Service was ok. We felt kind of rushed because someone would come by as soon as we finished a dish. There were times when I was literally taking the last pieces and they were taking away the dish. Another time, I was still eating off my plate and the bus boy asked if I was done. NO, I'm not done. Can't you see I'm still eating?! Sheesh.It was my first time having halo halo and although we are supposed to mix everything in, I like it better when the ice cream is whole. The pinipig gave the dessert a great contrast. I loved the flan. Overall, we ordered the most popular dishes according to Yelp but wasn't blown away. Some of the other dishes looked good but not sure if I'm willing to dish out that kind of money to experiment and there wasn't much air circulation in there.",1,1,1,Mengyi L.,"Brooklyn, NY",171,35,61
5.0,8/20/2015,"Holy khao! This is the place to go for brunch if you like delicious food, cheap unlimited drinks, and a cool atmosphere. We all started off with coffee, Vietnamese style! That means that...it has condensed milk or something, I'm not really sure, but it was really good coffee. The dishes were all great too. I have no idea what any of them were called but they all involved pork. The garlic fried rice was a fantastic side, and I would absolutely recommend it. But the coolest part of the brunch was definitely the boozy part - there's an unlimited keg out back, or unlimited mimosas, for $15! When I went it was Yuengling. They give you a solo cup and you can just go out whenever you need! I think that helps explain why I don't remember everything I ate.",2,2,0,Zach W.,"Baltimore, MD",41,162,253

After watching the cooking in front of me, I ordered the Pork Belly Adobo and Sizzling Sisig. The Pork Belly Adobo was mixed in a spicy (not too hot), tasty sauce with poached egg (cooked perfectly) and 4-5 slices of Pork Belly. Absolutely delicious!The Sizzling Sisig was mixed on a hot, sizzling plates. Pork belly, sauce and egg cooked separately  onto the sizzling platter.

3.0,8/11/2015,"My friend and I were already in the area and decided to try this place, since it had been on both our lists for a while. We ordered the curry and sisig. The curry was delicious! Just a bit more spicy than I needed, but I swapped out the noddles for the coconut rice and then it was perfect. Btw the coconut rice is absolutely delicious. We had heard raving reviews on the sisig, and tbh I was expecting more. It could also be the fact that we were sitting at the counter so we literally saw and smelled all the food that was coming out of the open kitchen. The sisig smells heavenly, and I was so excited to dive into the dish. But unfortunately our plate was a bit burned, and I wasn't really into how hard and crunchy the pork was. Lastly we ordered haru haru, which was the biggest disappointment of the night. I LOVE ube ice cream, but Pig and Khao's was less than subpar. I wasn't a fan of the flan in it either....it was hard and kind of chewy? It was weird. Anyways, it looked pretty, but the presentation was much better than the actual flavor of the dessert.I guess I would give it a 3.5, since I would be willing to go back to try more of the (albeit rather small) menu.",1,1,1,Sarah H.,"Hanover, NJ",220,110,780
3.0,8/10/2015,"Where do I start? First off, this is not an authentic ""Filipino"" restaurant...its more Asian Fusion as Yelp says it is and I think that's where I have my first star taken away. Yes, you have dishes like Adobo, Sigsig and yes even Halo Halo, and to someone who isn't familiar to Filipino dishes this place may be good. But because I really enjoy authentic Filipino dishes and know what authentic Filipino food is suppose to taste like, this is an unexciting restaurant catering to unfamiliar palates. Also coming from the west coast, more specifically, West Covina, CA (Little Manila) Carson and Cerritos CA (largest Filipino population outside of the Philippines) there are restaurants like Max's of Manila, Jeepney, Jollibee's and Red Ribbons replacing McDonalds in those areas, I would say I have a pretty good sense of what good Filipino food is. This isn't one of those places, not even close... My wife who is Filipino was unimpressed and didn't enjoy any of our dishes either.The 2nd star that I took away is due to the prices... I get that this is in the City. Thus the more premium price, but the potential for this place to really stand out, is if they lowered their prices and make this place a cheap eats, Filipino hang over type of soul warming food joint. But if this place has a target customer base who doesn't care about eating authentic Filipino food, I would say they are hitting the nail on its head. If you're Filipino or just really want Filipino food that reminds you of home, I cant recommend this place. Walk across the street and grab dumplings instead.",0,0,0,Phil A.,"Cortlandt Manor, NY",4,70,19
5.0,8/8/2015,"Good food and service combined def makes this place 5 stars. I went with three other people and in total we ordered 6 small plates to share around with 2 bowls of coconut rice. We got the three specials which were fried chicken wings, grilled pork belly skewers and pancit. We liked the skewers the best. It had a good charcoal grill taste to it. The pancit was a bit different from what I've had before and I know my pancit since I'm from Guam. The pancit here is thicker noodles with a lot more watery sauce. It was a bit on the salty side. The wings were delicious. They had a thick spicy seasoning to it but still crunchy outside. We also got the skate wing which tasted amazing. The ssisig was ok. We actually had a better version of it at another Filipino restaurant. The lumpia here was also different from what I've had before. The ones I grew up with were deep fried, hot, more meaty stuffing. Here it was on the room temp/ chilled temperature with minimal pork in it. But whatever pork that was in it was delicious. The service here was great.

On top of the rice it was the perfect mix of salty and sweet. We also had the ribs that had a great flavored sauce similar to duck sauce that is often paired with Peking duck.Lastly, the ricotta donuts. I could've eaten about 22 of them but I settle on one after this epic meal. The LES chill atmosphere gives this place the cool laid back feel you don't normally get from a Top Chef restaurant.

What we ate: Grilled Pork Jowel: The brussel sprouts were amazing, but I think they definitely out shined the pork. Overall the dish was also saltier than I cared for, but still enjoyable. This was my friends favorite dish, he was impressed he found a place that made him like brussel sprouts. BBQ Baby Back Ribs: These were my favorite! So flavorful and fall-off-the-bone tender. The sauce was a delicious blend of sweet and savory. Also very filling, we had to take the rest home. Bun Bo Nam Bo: We asked for the server's opinion for a third dish, and upon his suggestion this is what we ordered. The noodles were a bit hard for me, and I usually like my noodles as far away from soft and mushy as possible. The sauce was also pretty sour/bitter, and the beef was nothing special. Overall it wasn't a bad dish, but there wasn't anything special about it.Coconut Rice: This one is a must! I've had coconut rice a few times, but this was by far the best. Very flavorful, light, and the perfect accompaniment to the rest of the dishes. Drinks: I had a Lucky Budha, very good! They also offer self refillable Yuengling on tap for $15 which is a bomb deal! All in all it was a pleasant experience. I would say go and give it a shot if you've never been, the flavors were definitely something different.

""Small plates"" are a bit deceptive.  I got the pork belly adobo and poached egg, and with half a side of rice, I was definitely full.  The richness of the flavors would not have allowed me to eat more.And yea, the coconut rice was really delicious!  (Seeing as it is the same price as jasmine rice, I'm not sure why anyone would not opt for the coconut rice option...)",0,0,1,Alison L.,"Atherton, CA",103,615,61

No patron wants to be told to move or get a glimpse of the storeroom while eating. The staff also forgot drink orders and tapped us in the shoulders when they wanted to know something.

The red curry was pretty perfect for the way I usually enjoy it- seasoned just right without overloading it with random veggies that no one cares about.Drinks: I tried the Perfect Storm which was good. Not too sweet, just the way I like it. I did notice they had a cooler of beer in the back area which was part of their self serve AYCD Yuengling/PBR.

The place is located in the hipster parts of LES which tends to get pretty packed after 6pm, I recommend coming in before then and making reservations. The ambiance is cozy with its dim lighting but that's what makes this place suitable for LES standards. We ordered chicarron, pork belly adobo, sisig, coconut rice and bun bo nam bo. I would skip the chicarron because it's just pork rinds but I noticed it was slightly more lighter than the ones I've had in the past, I suppose it makes it a bit more guilt free. Definitely get any dish with pork in it because c'mon it's PIG and Khao!The sisig was amazing, it was so juicy and the sauces that oozed out was delightful. The bun bo nam bo was the bomb, puts vietnamese vermicelli salads to shame! The pork belly adobo was so good with the poached egg. The pork skin added a nice crunch to top things off. Like everyone else said, definitely get the coconut rice. Each grain tasted like it was soaked and steamed in coconut milk. You'll know what I mean once you try it. Nearly everything we had was bursting with flavor! We ended our meal with halo halo. Because how could you not get halo halo when you're eating at a Filiphino joint?

Also the pork dishes tend to taste similar so after a few plates and alcohol they test the same...  Here is what we ordered: chicken wings (excellent), eggplant salad (excellent), grilled pork jowl (good, strong flavor), shan noodles (very good), pork belly adobo (very good, surprisingly not too rich), sizzling sisig (good, but can do without), crispy pata (good but tastes like everything else..), coconut rice (delicious but a bit too sweet), and halo halo for desert (perfect ending to greasy pork meal).  I will definitely go back and try non-pork dishes next time.  The dishes are not massive but very good portion to share among 3-4.",2,0,0,Akira O.,"New York, NY",74,401,73

But for a price of $13 for 5 pieces, never again. The lumpia is interesting and not fried like the ones you'll find elsewhere. Everything was just overpriced for the small portions you'll recieve. When our waitress wasn't around we asked another if we could have change for a $20, she told us that she wasn't our waiter and that we should ask ours.... ok.... its not that hard.... you couldve helped your fellow coworker.

They have a very interesting cocktail menu, and they make great mixed drinks that are quite potent, so order wisely. The waitress was very informative both on the drink menus and the dinner menu. The style here is more 'family-style' so it is encourage to order several dishes for the whole table to try and share. We got two small plates: Khoa Shoi which was red curry with coconut milk and chicken cooked with egg noodles. We also got the Pork Belly Adobo which was super fatty and good. It came with a dipping sauce on the side and a poached egg. As for the large plate, we got what the waitress recommended which was the fried pork leg. It was plenty for two because it was large slices of the leg. It was fried to perfection and it gave the skin just a perfect crunch and crispiness.

I'm a fan too!However, I went for a birthday brunch and maybe my roommates talked it up for so long that I had high expectations?Sizzling Corned Beef Hash ($13)It was a little too salty for me personally even with the egg and potatoes. I couldn't really taste the ginger or thai chili because the saltiness of the corned beef covered it up. Steak and Eggs ($15)Surprisingly, even though I wasn't inclined to order this dish, it was my favorite of them all. The sirloin was grilled to perfection and melded well with the flavors of the spicy issan sauce and egg. All around a great dish.Grilled Pork Jowl ($13)The brussel sprouts mixed with the pieces of pork jowl and lime-chili fish sauce created a unique and interesting flavor combination- savory but acidic and salty. I don't remember eating the toasted rice.Sizzling Sisig ($15)A little too fatty and salty for me. I think the theme here is that I personally don't love salty foods so if you are a fan you would love this place! Everyone raves about the raw egg in combination with the pork head, but I couldn't tell what was so phenomenal about the combination? It was good, but nothing to rave about.Bottomless Mimosas ($15)Skip the orange and try the mango & white peach. Service was okay with filling it, but we definitely had to get their attention and ask for refills.Vietnamese Style Coffee ($3)I know this style of coffee is sweet due to the condensed milk. However, this one was so incredibly sweet that one friend couldn't finish it and the other asked for a refill of plain coffee once she got halfway to dilute the sweetness. For the money, I thought the portions were on the smaller side. I was hungry an hour later, but it could just be that I'm a pig and others might find it perfectly portioned. The waitress accidentally charged us $30 extra because not everyone opted for the bottomless mimosas.

Overall, the decor is minimal and the place is low key.  We ordered: - the sizziling sisig- the signature Filipino dish with sizzling pork bits and fats on a hot hot platter, they mix it an egg and put some lime atop. Interesting, and good but not my favorite pork dish of all time as it's been describe- I enjoyed the authentic nature but could have done with less fat. Perhaps I could have gotten the jowl..- the Shan Noodles- we are Burmese so were expecting a lot here and it was really good. Mustard greens give it a tart taste, mixed in with minced chicken, cilantro, and thick rice noodles.  Comes in a soup form and is perfect for sharing.  Definitely a plus for sour/lemongrass lovers-the smoked sardines- these took a while to come and out and they are definitely one of a kind.  Salty, briney- very unique taste with bones inside. These are fresh so you best bet they are meaty. There are a lot bones here, and the skin is quite flavorful.  Comes with a tart vinegar sauce and a fresh tomato/cucumber salad.-The papaya salad- which is banging here. This version has the usual suspects but uses fried taro for the crunch and throws in really good charred grilled chicken for a hearty mealCame to $70.  Not bad for quality of food but not sure I loved it enough to return.

Started with turkey (?) meatballs on soup spoons (1/person) and it was soaked on Vietnamese fish sauce. Pretty good. Then we got sautéed beef wrapped in some type f leafy vegetable. It was good but s little too oily for my taste. It was the size of a cigarette and 1/person. Next came wrapped stir fried veggies with chopped up crispy pork belly wrapped in rice paper topped with peanut sauce. After that, came cod. It was covered in cilantro with a hint of coconut. Really loved this one. Then out came the Thai fried chicken wings. It was a little too sweet for my taste and the wings were covered in this sweet red sauce. The sisig came out right after. Love this. Be sure to stir the raw egg in right away! Eat it with the rice. Then came the ribs. It was BBQ I believe, and a little charred - was tasty. Then poached egg on this delicious sauce with pork belly was set on the table. The sauce in this dish is yummy.  LASTLY, curry noodles came out. This dish had chicken, had a little heat but was a little too salty for my taste and I love salty. Overall, this is a great place to go if you love flavor explosions in your mouth; there was a new taste every time. However, I felt that it was a little too overwhelming for me - coulda capped it at 2 appetizers and 4 Main dishes. Oh and we got two desserts at the end of the tasting. Not a a sweets fan so only tried the shaved ice; not bad. The other dessert was fried dough that you would dip into this sauce. I do recommend trying this place out. Get the sisig.

Good music, at least to my liking.Pork Belly Adobo: 4-5 large and thick pieces of pork belly sitting in a broth, along with a poached egg. Delicious. The pork belly was really moist and tender and the exterior was wonderfully crispy. The pork itself didn't have much flavor, but the broth had enough flavor for the whole dish. Even though it was a soy sauce based broth, it still managed to be unique and deeply satisfying. It is on the salty side so order a side of rice to go with it. I recommend this dish.Shan Noodles: Another winner of the night. Really tasty and savory, and flavors were spot on. Recommended.Sizzling sisig: Least favorite of the night and kind of anti-climactic in taste. A bit plain and boring--unmemorable.Coconut rice: Very good and addictive.

So we had a glass of wine and whiskey and hung out in the super small and cramped bench area. ,y recommendation is to come early or make a reservation... There's no room for groups of 15 to be loitering around this lobby. We sat and they offered unlimited yingling for $10 but we stuck with aka carte drinks. It was a fixed course menu- we had: chicharron, roasted peanuts, green mango salad, grilled sirloin, red rolls, sizzling sisig, coconut rice, the baby back ribs, khao soi, Shan noodles, some half chicken dish, and for dessert the served the halo-halo. The environment was fun- boisterous and loud and the server wearing the ""notorious P-I-G"" shirt was great. In fact, for a 8pm sat group of 15 rowdy jersey kids, service was great all around. For started a bit slow, but really picked up for the small courses and then appropriately slowed down with noodles and main courses. (For the record, I was stuffed by appetizer end). The bathrooms are clean (enough)- there's only one for the entire restaurant so don't hold it till you burst... There's most likely a line. The food: chicharron and peanuts were fine, but we were starving so once the mango salad rolled in we pounced. I loved the freshness and the cilantro in it. Coconut rice was decadent. This is a must-order. The grilled sirloin was extremely rare - if you like yours more well, ask them or avoid. The sauce it came with was a spicy orgy in your mouth- i couldn't get enough. The red rolls were fried and very lightly finished with salt... Loved those dipped in the sirloin sauce! The sisig was underwhelming only because it was extremely fatty.. The favors and the egg were great though. There were two noodle dishes- I preferred the one with the curry and chicken more. By the time our entrees rolled in, I couldn't even look at food. The chicken was its and juicy (I had to try it!) and the ribs were very tender and had a great sauce- everyone loved them but I was just too full to enjoy.

I had the bottomless mango mimosa and the Khai Soi dish IT was absolutely amazing. I never tasted anything that merged milky flavors with spicy flavors. What a wonderful marriage! A bunch of my friends had the sizzling sisig, and I wanted to devour theirs as well! Wonderful and friendly service!

5.0,3/9/2015,"Trendy, kind of hipster Asian Fusion/Filipino place in the Lower East Side from a former Top Chef contestant. I can say I'm a fan of the decor. It's the type of place that isn't super nice, but yet has the charm that is comfortable without being boring.As far as the food goes, it was all really good and exceeded by expectations. The small plates, we had the Dinuguan and grilled pork jowl. They were both really good and frankly the favorite things we had. Dinuguan has pork blood in it, but they do a good job of masking it. The pork jowl is really good too with everything on the plate. For the large plate, we had the Whole Fried Porgy. The fish was good and we enjoyed it. I'm pretty familiar with Malaysian food and the one thing about the food here is maybe it could have used a little work, but otherwise it was good. Along with all of this we had some coconut rice, which was really coconutty and I appreciate. For dessert, we had Halo Halo and Ricotta Donuts. The Halo Halo was good, though definitely an interpretation on it. I liked the Ricotta Donuts a lot, especially the sauce.All in all, solid meal from start to finish. Service was pretty good - not perfect, but it wasn't non existent either. I'll return sometime - great food here.",2,1,2,Mike R.,"New York, NY",104,410,2
5.0,3/8/2015,"*** The super-short review ***Lives up to the hype. Eat here.*** The medium-length, summary review ***Pig & Khao is fantastic, and I couldn't even eat their signature dishes because I usually stay away from pork.  I mean I had to cut the Pig out of Pig & Khao, and they still impressed.  That's pretty great.  To boot, I came here with a proper citizen of the Philippines, and P&K got her thumbs up, with one exception, the Chicken Inasal, which underwhelmed the both of us.  I'd definitely come back, I'd recommend this to out-of-towners, to friends, for dates, for lunches, for brunches, for dinners, for winners, and I suppose for losers too--they can sit in the sad little heated patio out back and stuff mantou buns (not Filipino, but perfect in about every way) in their mouths till their sorrow is forgotten or drowned by dough.BEWARE the menu labeling.  Their ""small plates"" aren't small.  The khao soi could easily be most people's main plate.  Even some of the sides--the chop suey, which was $%@&ing delicious, by the way--would have made for a pretty great minimalist main, in and of itself.  My partner and I, deceived by the menu's willy-nilly categorization, over-ordered, and while I was delighted by this in the moment, I felt ill shortly thereafter, as my dear stomach battled for my very life against the mantou buns, which were trying to burst my insides with their doughy, assiduous expansion.*** Dish by Dish ***Side-dishes and appetizers:* Chop Suey.  Allegedly a side-dish, in actuality also candidate for a very light main or appetizer.  Terrific.  Would have again.  Not Filipino, but served there often according to my dinner partner, who said P&K's version is way better, lighter, fresher, and not drenched in sauce so the crispiness and flavor of the vegetables comes out.* Mantou buns.  Side dish.  Also not Filipino.  Four buns a bit bigger than a doughnut hole, and like doughnuts but denser and only very lightly sweet.  They were perfect.  I have never had mantou before, and I don't know what their ideal is, but if their ideal is not this, then, it either ought to be, or I ought to be eating it right now, and every day, forever, and then buried with some of them, because they were so good.  (Be careful with these--I think they do the thing where they expand in your stomach and threaten you with slow, pressured death, if you eat too many.)* Khao soi.  Allegedly a small plate, in actuality a not-huge main.  This was the best khao soi I've had outside Thailand, and also the only khao soi I've had that seemed as good as what I remember having there.  To my palate, this dish was also perfectly spiced--there was enough in there to give heat, but not enough to overwhelm the flavor or to hurt.  Everything above was not just excellent, but it was perfect.  Which is why the main dish was so disappointing.Main dish:Chicken Inasal.  It was... chicken.  Just plain old chicken.  I mean, they did *something* to prep it, its skin was colored and has some flavor to it, but not to any great effect.  And my dinner partner mentioned it wasn't as good as what she'd sometimes get from the chicken chains of the Philippines, where it would not only be super cheap, but also come loaded with garlic rice.  In this chicken's defense, I have to note it tasted better the next day as leftovers, perhaps because it didn't have to compete on my palate with all the other stuff.Dessert:Halo halo.  The best iteration of this dessert I've had!  The ice was a proper slush, not big tooth-chipping chips, and while it was loaded with the mix-mix of sweetness you'd expect (red yam ice cream, rice crispies, condensed milk, and cubes of flan and candied banana), it didn't feel overloaded.  Drinks:I didn't try the cocktails, but I have important beer notes for you: The Lucky Buddha, a Chinese beer, is flavorless effluence poured into a lovely, jolly-Buddha-shaped bottle.  Avoid.  The San Miguel Pilsner, however, is a pretty good, flavorful pilsner.  It seems the Philippines escaped the trap of exporting only their most generic lager beer.",25,19,17,Daniel B.,"New York, NY",414,641,407

4.0,3/1/2015,"KenScale: 8.0/10Pig and Khao has long been on my list but somehow I've not been able to visit this restaurant with hipster vibe showcasing Filipino cuisine from former Top Chef contestant Leah Cohen. I'm always partial to Southeast Asian flavor but just haven't had the time to go all the way down to LES to sample the dishes at this place. I finally had a chance to visit and liked the soulful Filipino cooking from the kitchen. All the dishes at Pig and Khao are moderately priced and good for sharing in a large group of people. It doesn't the same intensity of spicy flavor that I was used to seeing at places like Uncle Boon, it has well-executed dishes, focused on pork, with unique flavor (more on the sweeter side). I liked the green mango salad with charred chicken that was moderately spiced and refreshing. Grilled pork jowl with brussel sprouts was also well-cooked and tasty. Sizzling sisig, a Filipino dish of pork head, chili, whole egg that has long been one of the signature dishes at the restaurant, had that rustic touch and but became a bit overwhelming with fat toward the end after I scooped up several spoons. The true star of the night belonged to the fantastic khao soi, a dish of red curry, coconut milk, chicken and egg noodles. Compared to the one at Uncle Boons (which has always been a standard-setter for this dish), it's on the spicier side, but I still loved the intensity of spicy kick that enhanced the noodles with great texture and well-cooked chicken. For dessert, I tried a dish called halo-halo, a combination of shaved ice, leche flan and ube ice cream and pinipig (pounded rice), with interesting texture that felt as if I was eating cereal on milk.  Getting a reservation at this relatively tiny restaurant isn't particularly hard, but the place was still nearly packed in the course of my meal. Pig and Khao has that hipster vibe (with 90s hip-hop music) quite fitting for its neighborhood. There is full bar menu with some interesting cocktail choices inspired by Southeast Asian ingredients. Pig and Khao is a nice place to visit if you're looking for a dinner in LES before a night out in downtown.

4.0,2/27/2015,"There were two of us for which the waitress suggested 3-4 dishes, but 3 dishes (+ coconut rice) was more than enough (I shamefully left food unconsumed). We had the famous Sisig, which was delicious but too salty. Then again, I'm not a pig face connoisseur and assume that's inevitable. The sweetness of the coconut broth in the Khao Soi was a great change of pace. The Khao Soi also had a depth in its flavors and a spicy kick. In fact, I'd say this was my favorite dish of the night. Rounding things off were the Mussels. Again, a little seafood really helped split up the pork-heavy dishes, though the mussels came with small cubes of bacon in the broth.The drinks were a bit underwhelming. I don't know, maybe I'm spoiled, but given the vibe/reputation of the establishment, I was hoping to be wow'ed.  The Lower East Side cocktail was average at best. However, the Sweet & Sour Cilantro Soda (extra for Gin) was quite good. The table next to us got the whole pig, which I imagine is more cool than it is delicious.

4.0,2/9/2015,"Every experience I've had at Pig and Khao always leaves me with gluttony guilt. It's just so hard not to order everything on the menu. P&K's decor leaves much to be desired. It's pretty nonexistent aside from the awesome murals in the back garden. Though I feel that was the intention. Less focus on hoity toity, more on the food. Minor quibbles aside; let's get to it.Their bar program is nothing fancy. A few adequate cocktails here and there, though the Stinky Peat does lack some true peat. They have a decent beer selection encompassing a good range, as well as a $15 bottomless pour of Yuengling. P&K's menu is a mish mash of South East Asian delights, primarily focused on Thai and Filipino dishes. Purists will argue of the dishes' authenticity, but one can't argue it's deliciousness. Their sisig opts for more chunkier pieces of meat than tradition warrants, but it's my favorite dish on their menu. The green mango salad is refreshing and delicious. Simple mussels amplified with a pineapple curry. The khao soi is perfect. For dessert their Halo-Halo topped with ube ice cream is a must have as it is pretty to look at.Pig and Khao is in no way ground breaking by any means. Cohen just makes good food the way she wants to make it. Many people will decry blasphemy against tradition, but come with an open mind and I guarantee you'll leave with a satisfied full stomach.

With Filipino food, I usually travel to Queens for cheaper and always delicious Filipino food. I know this place is a fusion restaurant but I was expecting much more after hearing so much high praise from other reviewers on Yelp. I do have to highly recommend the Sizzling Sisig. I ordered the coconut rice to go with it and it amazing! The crisp crunch of the pork alongside with the rice hit the spot. If only the Khao Soi was just as good. The spiciness was overwhelming. I don't mean that this as, ""This is so spicy I can't even breathe,"" it was more like, ""ALL I TASTE IS SPICE AND NOTHING ELSE."" Sighhh. At least the chicken was sorta good? Dinner ended with turon for dessert. The banana fritter itself wasn't that sweet, wish there was some powered sugar on it. If anything, we wished the salted caramel ice cream was a separate dessert by itself. We liked it more than the overall dessert. Even though there was chocolate sauce, it didn't do much for the banana fritters. All in all, if I had JUST the sizzling sisig I would have been happier with dinner. But unfortunately, I didn't.

We sat in the back where there were heaters which I really appreciated in this kind of weather. The decor itself is confusing. Nothing seems to go together. The lighting was red from the heaters which made it look sort of like a cheap bar but then again it was a restaurant. They had wood tables but folding chairs, really nice stone plates for certain dishes but chinese-styled plastic bowls and plates for other dishes.All 3 of us have never been here and we came across this place because of Yelp. So of course we took suggestions from Yelp and ordered the top 4 dishes others recommended. The food itself honestly wasn't bad but it wasn't great. It was just another meal. Nothing so delicious that would make me want to come back, but not bad enough that I wouldn't want to if I had to. The dishes we ordered all in all was too salty, this is coming from a person who likes salt. One of the dishes we ordered that was highly recommended was the Sizzling Sisig (pork head, chili, whole egg), and it was just overly salty. If we didn't order the jasmine rice, there would be no way we could finish it just by itself. The taste was okay, but just overly seasoned.

First the pork jowl and brussel sprouts. So delcioius- spicy and cirtusy with the pork which was kind of creamy and sweet. It was both of our favorite dish. We also ordered two coconut rice which I think was my favorite thing. Solo good. I could eat just that. And the sweetness counteracted the spiciness of all the dishes really well. Next we got the pork belly adobo which was good but nothing special. Our third dish was the Khao Soi which was so creamy and delicious and spicy.

I made a reservation via phone at lest a month in advance for my group of 7. You have to put a down payment of $100 to hold the spot. Our group arrived early and the place was pretty empty for a Sunday night. We opted for the $10 all you can drink Yuengling from the tap. We were each given a red solo cup and told to fill it up ourselves as much as we wanted. There was actually a lot of foam and the beer was pretty flat. Kinda wish I had an actual drink instead since I totally didn't take advantage of the beer deal. The pig was precooked and they just had to heat it up before they brought it out. The waiter came out and let us take our pictures before he cut the piggy up. The deal included two veggies dishes which were predetermined. We had fried brussel sprouts and steamed bok-choy. The fried brussel sprouts were so good and tasty, we had to ask for seconds. The pig was kinda fatty and not as flavorful as anticipated. I had to dip it in the chicken liver sauce or spicy sauce for some taste. Would I do this again? No, don't think it was worth $70 per person.

I typically avoid those scattershot places that want to be all good things to all people and usually end up not.Pig and Khao's Filipino/Southeast Asian fresh twist on traditional dishes was fabulous.

P&K definitely did not skimp with large pieces of tasty, charred octopus with frisée, Dashi and potato purée.The bowl of authentic Shan Noodles immediately took me back to last year when I was in the middle of the Burmese countryside eating at a restaurant shack we could only get to via horse cart. Ground chicken with turmeric, peanuts and fermented mustard greens sounds off, but definitely try this small plate/bowl.The other standout was the Sizzling Sisig, with pork head, chili and a whole raw egg cracked on top.

4.0,1/28/2015,"Leah Cohen's Clinton Street restaurant Pig & Khao has been calling my name since Colameco's piece on the former Top Chef contestant last year, but they've been open since 2012. After three failed attempts to get in, I decided to make a reservation like an adult.Our waitress says that for two people we should order three to four small plates. We order three plus the Chicharron to start - homemade fried pork rinds. Kim has an FTP, which is rum, cognac, peach, and cinnamon bark. Sweeter than she'd like. I tossed back four Perfect Storms (ginger, sherry, lemon, rum) like they were happy juice.I'd skip the chicharrons next time as they're a bit one note - and the coconut vinegar was so mild it really only got them wet. They look nice, though.Then the evening special blew our minds. Crispy pork belly on pumpkin puree and bok choy with nuts and fried onions. Kim and I looked at each other like we've done only a handful of times - registering extreme delight with barely a raised eyebrow - silently acknowledging that we just ate something special. Crispy and smooth, sweet and unctuous.Not a morsel remained and it paired perfectly with their amazing coconut rice. That rice borders on dessert and I will slay any man that gets between us. Although even it could not contain the heat of the next dish.""Wait, we have another dish coming?"" I ask Kim.""Wait, we have another dish coming?"" the guy at the next table asks his girl.Seems both tables were talked into three dishes, but do yourself a favor and stop at two and a dessert. It's a lot of food, especially with that delicious coconut rice. Unless you're in a group, I mean. Or you could just do whatever you want.The Khao Soi (red curry, coconut milk, chicken, egg noodles, pickled mustard greens, shallots) was so spicy it should be mentioned when you order it. Help me help myself, Pig & Khao. We had to give up and get it to go. I just tried it again after a day in the fridge. Whoowweeeee that's a spicy Khao Soi!Hence the Halo Halo was a no-brainer. A traditional Filipino shaved ice dessert I've only had once before at Talde where Dale puts Cap'n Crunch in it. Known for being a concoction, at Pig & Khao there's some tasty purple ube ice cream and the occasional leche flan your spoon discovers happily, all melting into a soup with macapuno coconut and pinipig, (toasted glutenous rice).We rolled ourselves onto Clinton Street and walked by the now closed WD-50 with a liquid nitrogen tear running down our cheeks. Somehow we made it to the F train on Delancey before collapsing into heaps back in Brooklyn - where Leah Cohen plans to take more of my money.""Next time I'm getting the tasting menu,"" I thought to myself, before slipping into porky unconsciousness.",1,2,2,Eric C.,"Brooklyn, NY",43,34,11
5.0,1/27/2015,"From lechon to pata, it is evident that Filipino cuisine is fueled by a deep passion for pork. Filipino cuisine is the result of a combustion of Hispanic, Chinese, American, and Southeast Asian flavors. The elaborate Filipino culture is accurately portrayed by the colorful spectrum of dishes at Pig and Khao. This gastro-pub is a product of Top Chef's Leah Cohen. Cohen is a New York City native with a strong culinary background from Eleven Madison Park, La Madia, as well as with Chef David Burke. Cohen spent time traveling throughout Thailand and Philippines, learning from locals to refine her Asian culinary craft. This space is not capacious but commodious. It is made up of an open kitchen flanked by stools, as well as communal tables that are perfect for Kamayan-style feasts. There is a fairly moderately sized back patio; the walls of the patio are torn down in summer. The most popular dish is the Sizzling Sisig ($15) which is made up of cubed pork jowl, pork eggs, pork cheek, onions, and topped with a raw egg. This unique dish features pork that is boiled, broiling, and grilling. It is flavored with calamansi, vinegar, salt and pepper. An excellent low carb, high fat dish, and flavorful dish. The Khao Soi ($16), a Myanmar-inspired dish, is an egg noodle soup dish made of a thick, concentrated, and creamy coconut milk broth. It is topped off with crunchy fried egg noodles, cilantro, diced chicken, and red curry paste. The meal is sprinkled with Chinese pickled mustard greens that are acidic, sweet, and sour. For the fearless, Pig and Khao offers a strange delicacy known as balut, a boiled duck embryo. The lager is served in a red solo cup that will certainly make you feel nostalgic of your beer pong victories. $15 gets you bottomless mimosas or draft Yuengling, a traditional lager. The mimosas vary in multiple flavors: Lychee, Mango, and Orange. Plain champagne is also available. Sheila took care of us throughout the day. Her customer service was warm, friendly, and attentive. Our glasses were never empty! Dishes come out as they are finished at a reasonable time. Some pro tips: Reservations were originally unaccepted, however, this has been revised. Expect a lot of cilantro on these dishes, if you are not a fan, make a request. Great hip-hop playlist with the latest mainstream artists.",10,3,8,Kelly P.,"Manhattan, NY",374,130,473

Anyway, I still enjoyed the food. The sisig was delicious, with a cracked egg in the middle. It doesn't come with rice so order a cup of jasmine or coconut rice on the side.

4.0,1/21/2015,"I went to Pig and Khao for brunch with a friend last Saturday.  We initially only ordered the Shan Noodles and Brioche French Toast to split between the two of us, but our waitress strongly recommended that we order 3-4 dishes total as well as a side of rice for the 2 of us or it wouldn't be enough food, so we somewhat reluctantly added on the Steak and Eggs to our order.The Shan Noodles were really amazing. Brioche French Toast was also really good.  By the time we got to the Steak and Eggs, we were both already stuffed (and neither of us are particularly light eaters - as indicated by the dishes we chose to order off the menu.  haha.).  The Steak & Eggs was my least favorite, in both flavor and consistency.  Their brunch menu dishes are totally normal-sized, which forces me to question if our waitress got us to over-order on purpose just to get a bigger tip (#annoying #sneakyb-tch).  So if you go for brunch and your waitress tells you to order more than 1 main dish per person, stay strong. :)  One each is plenty.  The lovely duo at the table next to ours also let us try their powdered sugar doughnuts, which come with a side of green Nickelodeon slime aka ""pandan custard"".  It was very meh.Pig & Khao offers $15 bottomless beer or mimosas during their weekend brunch, which is obviously magical, and they've got a great location - so their relatively modest-sized Saturday brunch crowd was a little confusing to me.  On the positive side, this meant that my friend and I could actually speak to one another without leaning in and yelling, which was a rare treat.  Recommended for: casual weeknight dinner, weekend brunch, first date spot, AYCD",2,2,3,Meredith R.,"New York, NY",378,86,3

2.0,1/16/2015,"Went here on a double date last night and we were really sadly underwhelmed. There wasn't a wait which was great. The jist: service was pretty bad until a really nice waitress came on shift later into our evening; food was unimpressive, and everything was overpriced.We love Filipino food and only went here because we've been to Maharlika and Jeepney recently, and wanted to try a new place. We probably won't come back again.We were seated in the back room so service was really slow. They brought out our plates one at a time but they knew we weren't sharing, so it made for really awkward timing. I don't think anyone once asked us how our food was or how we were doing, and I think we probably ate during a staff shift (understandable, but you've got to be mindful of that). As a result, two of our orders were never even put in so we finally cancelled them when we found out. The noodles small plate was good. Everything else was unimpressive: adobo pork belly was tasty but fatty, sisig (our favorite usually) was almost all fat--literally half the plate sat untouched globs of fat), $24-26 ""large plate"" of chicken was SO tiny it looked like an appetizer...Desserts were good though.Maybe we just caught them an on off night?

Just a note, one order of rice, accompanied by the rest of the dishes, was enough for 2 people! It is a HINT of sweet and pairs well with the salty foods.The Sisig didn't sound nearly as appealing on the menu (pig face? pig head?) but I ordered it because of all the good reviews. Absolutely no regrets there! It was really really good... There was great texture - crispy and meaty. Great flavor/seasoning. I love egg so that was a huge plus. It was just the best dish. Pork Belly was good! The flavor was nice! I'm not crazy about the fat in Pork Belly generally. But I was able to eat it and enjoy it. Mussels were not bad. It was good. Nothing to rave about.  Interesting flavors. Halo halo (pronounced hallow hallow) tasted like.... fancy cereal. I really enjoyed the toasted rice cereal flavor. (Am I weird?)

4.0,12/8/2014,I love this place. I've Only been there for dinner never brunch but it never disappoints.better to make reservations if it's more than 2 of y'all. They allow walk-ins but will always offer the kitchen bar 1st...which is cool if u wanna watch them make your dish but it can get hot near the flames.My go-to is the khao Soi or Sizzling Sisig with coconut rice.The rice is really good and goes with everything. The portions are generous on both dishes.The mango salad is really good as well...tried the mussels they were nothing special. The drinks are meh! so go there to eat not get drunk. although  $15 bottomless cups of beer can be a good night starter if your looking to do damage.The vibe is upbeat and it feels young and hip.The playlist is always decent with something for everybody.A little heavy on the hip hop side but they do a good job of mixing it up.Will be back soon.,1,0,1,Toray M.,"Reno, NV",601,4,8
3.0,12/8/2014,"I came here to do a  school project on international cuisine. This was the first time I tried Filipino food so I was super exited! My boyfriend and I walked in about 30 min earlier than our reservation hoping they would seat us and they did! We decided to go and sit at the bar and we can watch the chefs cook up our food! That was a mistake! I saw the chefs using their bare hands to grab shrimp chips in the serving bowls, when there was a spoon for it, I saw the chef picking at a customers plate that was set to go out in the dining room! (Used bare finger to grab a piece from customers plate and put it in mouth) Another chef is making stuff on the stove and uses the same spoon for cooking every dish as well as tasting too! No where did I ever see them washing or changing the spoon!The only reason I gave this please 3 and not 2 stars was because of the food. I actually got the chefs tasting menu. (Bad decision) I n the end I spent about 110 for 2 people, which I didn't feel like it was worth it! I felt like ordering off the regular menu would have been so much more worth it! Some dishes in the chefs menu come smaller than the dishes that go out as a regular order! And mind you we have to share the dishes between two people! I honestly felt tricked by the chefs tasting menu! It's a no go!!!We started one bite spring roll. It was meh, I've made better!Next we got pork jowl and Brussels sprout dish, it was good but too salty and I noticed our plate was more burnt than the other plates coming out! We couldn't finish it even with the coconut rice!The coconut rice is a MUST GET! Tastes like the inside of a coconut! (Chefs tasting menu only included 1 rice for us to share)Next we got the wings. (This was when I noticed that the potion sizes were different, we only got 4 wings and the chef gave out 8 wings to the regular plates) They honestly were finger licking good and paired well with the rice!After that we got some curry noodle soup with crunchy noodles on that. It was not all that, ontop of that it was super salty, we didn't even try to finish that!!!For our entree we got the sizzling sisig, this was the dish I really wanted to try! (From all the yelp reviews and photos)  It was super fatty, but tasted good, this was when I realized that they should've gave the rice for us here, this dish here again was super salty!For dessert we got the chose from ricotta donuts, banana fritters, and halo halo.  My boyfriend really wanted the banana fritter and I wanted the halo halo, the chef said they would bring me up a small halo halo, I was super thankful for that! The banana fritters were mehhhh, could care less! The halo halo on the other hand was BOMB.com!!!! Loved the flan in there as well as the ube ice cream! I hear there are way better Filipino restaurants around, I will soon be trying them! Pig and khao did no make me want to come back a second time!",1,0,0,Michelle C.,"Bath Beach, Brooklyn, NY",5,5,16
4.0,12/7/2014,"I like this place a lot.  The fusion of Thai and Filipino just makes it unique enough to stand out, but the actual execution of the dishes is what makes it a winner. I've been here twice now and have been very happy both times. Some of the highlights: - The pork belly adobo was great. Sauce was spot on and the thin slices of pork belly cooked perfectly. - Their sisig is one of the best I've ever had (and that includes my trips to the Philippines). - Khao Soi with coconut rice is the only way to go, delicious together. - The Crispy Pata was great!- Save room for dessert, the Halo Halo is some of the best I've ever had as well!I'd say the only disappointments was the grilled sirloin (they were good, but nothing really special) and the baby back ribs (did it really like the sauce).",1,0,2,Dennis T.,"Nutley, NJ",321,179,1324

4.0,12/5/2014,"My favorite Filipino spot! I've been here three times? I'd come more often if it wasn't such a fat fest that I always feel bad about after. My workout for the impending meal starts before I even order -- stomach clenching as soon as I'm given a menu and glance over all of the artery clogging goodness.My go to at each Filipino spot that I've been to(and probably yours) -- sizzling sisig. Incredible! Pig and Khao makes my absolute favorite. Topped with a raw egg, it's fattier and saltier than anywhere else, and also seasoned better. Along with a side of incredibly fragrant and sweet coconut rice(so good that I can eat standalone) I could finish the whole plate of chewy, cartilage-y pork bits on my own but somehow have the self-control not to. Alas, more is coming!I usually also spit the khao soi -- this dish is equally incredible. The curry is creamy with a mild heat and has a very distinct coconut presence. The egg noodles are wonderfully chewy. The bowl is topped off with a generous amount of crispy noodles. Any leftover coconut rice is soaked in the curry and always finished, mmm.I've also tried the baby back ribs(saucy, meaty and extremely tender) and octopus salad(nothing special and kind of expensive for what it was) but have gone back to my two go-tos. Louis CK puts it best -- The meal is not over when I'm full. The meal is over when I hate myself. So of course, the meal must be topped off with the halo halo. I selfishly devour most of the incredible flan and ube ice cream before spooning as much pinipig as I can onto each bite of shaved ice.

We ordered.... Dinuguan pork stew. A bowl of chopped up pork shoulder meat with banana chilies and crunchy things. Not sure what the crunchy things are. It kind of taste like bone or cartilage.  It comes with steamed rice cakes which goes very well with the stew sauce. It's not that much broth in the stew. The seasoning and spice is unique and yummy.Sizzling sisig was a bit salty for my taste but my other half likes it. It taste much better with squeezed lime on it.Coconut rice is delicious! Feeds two people. Really tastes like coconut.Halo halo for dessert. Consists of flan, cornflakes, coconut flakes, shaved ice, condensed milk (?), and purple yam ice cream.

5.0,11/20/2014,"My in-laws' last-minute Sunday brunch request meant I was desperately calling every bookmarked restaurant on the Lower East Side. One of the first restaurants I thought of was Pig & Khao. After trying P&K at Madison Square Eats, I had been hoping to get out to the actual brick & mortar location for a while. The man who answered the phone said that yes, they did have a table ... but apologetically said it was outside on their ""heated patio."" Now, it was a brisk 30F that day, and I was skeptical. Ultimately, they were the only restaurant with room for four (plus a high chair for my niece), so we decided to check out this patio.And? ... what a misleading!! The ""patio"" was enclosed, and the heat lamps were large & mounted on the walls. Our table was totally comfortable and I wouldn't have even known it was outside! It was super comfortable, and I was beyond excited to finally try a restaurant I've had my eyes on for months.Filipino brunch is best-served family style, so that's exactly what we did! Our party of 4 ordered the following:Sizzling SisigSizzling Corned Beef HashLonganissa SausageGrilled Pork JowlSide of Longanissa SausageGarlic RiceA glass of RieslingUnlimited Orange Mimosas (of course!)My FAVORITE dish was the Sisig. I had been dying to try sisig, and this dish did not disappoint! Yes, I know it's sketch because it's made of ""assorted pig parts,"" but seriously, it's so good. A little crunchy, a little soft, a little fatty, all mixed in with an egg & a touch of some sweet carmelization action. When you eat it with a little garlic rice? Ahhhhh, pure heaven. Some of the best pork I've ever had. Seriously, so good. I would order this every single time. You have to try it!!The Pork Jowl was an unexpected hit. My sister-in-law wanted to order it, and the rest of us were skeptical. And the jowl -- often called the best piece of meat -- was good, but the accompanying Brussels Sprouts were AMAZING! Sorry to say that the jowl took a backseat to the garnish, but seriously. Perfectly cooked & so delicious. The other dishes weren't really veggie-friendly, so I would totally suggest that you order this for brunch. (Not that you needed another reason, but I'm saying!)The Corned Beef was similar to the Sisig, but with a bit more of a kick to it. I wasn't expecting that much spice! It was still pretty good, but it didn't compare to the Sisig. The Longanissa was also good -- my fiance & my niece were big fans. Longanissa is sweet, and a little rich, so the main dish serving isn't as large as you would expect. But you don't want to eat a lot of it ... so I wouldn't recommend ordering it unless you're willing to share! And what Filipino meal is complete without Garlic Rice? Not a one, I tell you.Unlimited mimosas are worth it, if you're having more than one. I like that there are multiple flavors ... but my sister-in-law & I stuck with orange. Sometimes, you just don't mess with the classics.Our server was really cool & friendly. He kept those mimosas from getting too bottomless, and even though we were warned that the dishes come out when they're ready, everything came out really quickly. Everything was perfect. The food was outstanding, the accommodations were awesome, & we were so, so happy that we made last minute brunch plans at Pig & Khao. One of the best brunches I've ever had in the city. Just so different from the regular fare, you know? If you haven't had Filipino food before, this is a great place to start. And if you have? Well, let's just say I hope you're reading this from the table on that comfy back patio.",8,3,8,JoAnna D.,"Cedar Grove, NJ",367,568,342
2.0,11/18/2014,"Wow. What a disappointing, inconsistent place. I really thought we had found a new neighborhood spot that wasn't overrated, overpriced, and overrun with hipsters, but apparently that hope was as worthless as when I thought music could make a comeback after the shitestorm of knives in my ears that happened in the early 2000s. Tonight was our second time at Pig and Khao and it just didn't cut it for the price or the cuisine. The dish we went crazy over the first time (the green mango chicken salad) had zero spice to it which, for me, defeats the purpose of going to a Southeast Asian restaurant. And the pork belly with pumpkin puree special was just bad. Too sweet, not spicy, and poorly selected cuts.  My guy, who is ordinarily unforgiving of these types of flaws in certain cuisines, was not nearly as turned off as I and was willing to give another dish a chance, but before we had an opportunity to do so the smell of cleaning products poured over the restaurant. At first I thought that maybe the kitchen realized they were kind of blowing it tonight and attempted to spare all of us from tasting any more of what they were serving up, but the truth is that the bar, which is right at the front of the restaurant and in close proximity to plenty of tables, decided to wipe down every bottle of liquor with windex. In the middle of service. And when it was brought to his attention a big grin came across his face and he continued!I'm always surprised to see that kind of attitude from a position that doesn't rely on a salary, but tips from the people that you're disturbing. Maybe he hasn't been working in restaurants long enough to know that vodka should be used to clean down his bar, but, for me, attitude and inconsistent food are two strikes too big to keep me coming back.",3,1,0,A E F.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,20,0
2.0,11/18/2014,"Just ate here again moments ago and it was a solid disappointment. The food's okay, but I've never been in a restaurant that happily uses windex in the middle of service while people are eating. The bartender decided to start closing up and was wiping down the bottles using windex. It was a real oddity. Every other restaurant in the free world has figured out that it's about the most awful smell you'd want to inflict on your customers and uses vodka instead. I can't think of a cuisine that would benefit from this odor encompassing the dining area.Since I've never been in a place that doesn't use vodka (convenient, scentless) instead, I've also never been in a place where you tell someone about the scent being off-putting and ruining your meal and they just keep using it anyway. They didn't stop! They just kept using the windex! And laughed out loud about it! We ended up leaving pretty abruptly. It puts me in the unfortunate position of writing another place off based on ignorance and lack of appropriate response.

If you have a date and you want to take him or her to a nice Asian ""fusion"" spot that makes you look like you're in the know, then by all means. My only comment is that this place is overpriced for what they offer and following this dining experience I've given up on Filipino food. ...Not that I'll never eat it again or try it again, but I'll never go to a Filipino restaurant thinking: ""OH MAN. IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS FOOD."" That's happened more than a few times in recent memory and every time I'm left incredibly disappointed. Filipino food is greasy. Like we're talking 'yo-why-the-hell-would-you-make-this-kind-of-food' kind of crazy. It's also insanely bland at times. Which blows my mind because for the longest time the Philippines served as the Nexus for trading ports in Asia, and there were traders and merchants from all over the world gathered in the Philippines. But somehow we end up with greasy as hell food and no other condiment but ketchup. Maharlika is the only Filipino restaurant that I'm completely sold on. Jeepney is godawful and Pig and Khao is just passable. We shared: Grilled Pork JowlKhao SoiCrispy Pata or Ribs...I'm drawing a blank on the large plate dish cuz it's been so long.Nevertheless, the dishes were good enough. They were very filling, but made me wonder if the prices they were being offered at were worth it. The Jowl was good. But it was a few pieces of meat for $13. The Khao Soi was reasonably priced. But the last large plate was not.I imagine this place would be a better fit for larger groups, as you can sample more dishes while splitting the cost down further.

4.0,11/14/2014,"Oink oink oink piggy piggy piggyI always get the same thing every time I go to a Filipino restaurant: Longinizza with a side of garlic rice, and a salad, so I can neglect and complain about how much I hate salads. If I was a rabbit, I still wouldn't eat a salad; I'd be a cute rabbit though, one of those bacon eating bunnies that smell good all the time.Anywho, yeah... the first time I've been to a Filipino restaurant... WITH NO LONGINIZZA, dun dun duuuuuuuuuuun (and garlic rice). It didn't really ruin my night because I was feeling adventurous, so I opted for the Sizzling Sisig. Nothing quite says adventure like a mutilated pig head does. At first I didn't want to go for it because the Adobo sounded amazing with it's garlic flavors, and my Filipino friend whom I went with recommended the Sisig, and I was in the mood to spite him for fun. You know, gotta assert your dominance sometimes *gorilla noises*, but it sounded too good to pass up.My friend ordered something else, I don't care, my food tasted too good to pay attention to his dish. So, that's how I felt about that *thumbs up*. The bowl of coconut rice comes in a decent size, which is beautiful because I was in no mood to spend extra money, so my friend had enough of his rice to share hehehe. There's a smoothness to the sweetness in the coconut rice, the kind of smooth I'd expect from the lips of that anorexic girl I have a crush on (must find a way to get her boyfriend out of the picture).The last thing I want to talk about was the first thing that caught my eye: ""Add any whiskey to your tea"". Yeah, two of my favorite things in the world combined, something I imagine a refined caveman would enjoy drinking. I got the Ginger Darjeeling with their only choice of whiskey (I forgot); it comes in a small pot, so you don't have to worry about getting a tiny cup, and when I got it, there was a sweet musk to it. One of the better smelling liquids I've ever smelt, if you ask me. The delight ends there though, it tasted like complete ass. Complete $7 down the toilet ass. Don't get it.

4.0,11/13/2014,"This place is dishing out big flavors and unique dishes. As you can imagine, they are serious about their pork -- there are definitely things on the menu I have never seen before, and also familiar things done in new ways (i.e. pork belly). I highly recommend going with an open mind and try something new, because life is too short to stick with the same old bacon and pork chops. Grilled Pork Jowl: a seriously unconventional salad. It was not love at first bite -- there's a strong hit of acid that is overwhelming. However, I just couldn't stop eating bite after bite. My first time eating pork jowl, and it was tender with crispy caramelized bits. Mixed with some bitterness from brussels sprouts, a little heat/spiciness, and an enticing combo of sweet and savory. What a flavor bomb in your mouth. I never thought I would say that I found pork jowl addicting. Pork Belly (special): the special that night was pork belly atop squash puree with bok choy. I'm not sure if the pork belly is cooked the same way as the adobo on the regular menu, but this was amazingly delicious. There's some serious umami going on from the asian sauces, and it's sliced thin so again there's the caramelized crispy bits. I'm not sure what the connection was to the squash, but it was delicious nonetheless and we almost licked the plate clean. Portion was a bit small. Still worth it.Sizzling Sisig: just say it a few times -- too fun. Per the menu description, it's pork head -- definitely NOT typical, but I actually found it disappointingly... normal. The meat is very tender, chopped up small, and served on a sizzling hot plate with a cracked egg on top. It was a little too salty, and I was looking for some sweetness or sourness to add depth, like the ones we found in the other dishes. But since it's apparently the dish they are known for, I'm glad I tried it. It was still super tasty.Khao Soi: not a bad dish, but definitely the most ordinary that we ordered. This is like the typical red curry with noodles that you can find at most Thai restaurants. I'd skip it.Coconut Rice: Yes, you are wondering why I am including rice in my review. But this is no ordinary ""side of rice."" It's a sticky, flavorful, amazing fluffy dome of rice. Slightly sweet and fragrant with coconut, it pairs so well with the saltiness/sourness of the other plates. This might've been my favorite thing we ordered. Again, so addictive. 1 order serves 2-3 people. Or hey you can down the whole bowl yourself - it's that good.Our waitress was awesome, super friendly and helpful. Ambience is casual and low-key. There are some fun cocktails on the menu. Overall, I really appreciate what they're doing here and will definitely be going back.

2.0,10/8/2014,"I wanted to like this place.  The two stars are really for the service, not for the food.  We ordered the sisig, khai soi, and halo halo.  The sisig was way too salty and didn't have the crunchy bits that I look for in any good sisig.  The khai soi was decent, curry was spicy and i liked the crispy egg noodles on top.  The halo halo was not that great, didn't have a lot of ingredients like other places.  It only had the ube ice cream, milk, ice, crispy rice, 2 bites of plaintains and 2 bites of leche flan.  There was mostly ice and didn't have the other stuff that I dig for like palm fruit, jelly, etc.  It definitely was not worth $8.  All the dishes were pretty small portioned and overpriced.  There are better Filipino/Thai places that are reasonably priced and larger portions.  I will not be back.",0,0,0,Julie Ying X.,"Brooklyn, NY",230,557,557
5.0,10/2/2014,"Pig and Khao is hands-down my number one favorite brunch (drunch) place in all of New York City. I have brought so many of my friends here throughout the years, and I swear there was a time during the summer that we were there religiously every Saturday morning to enjoy delicious food, bottomless drinks, and general debauchery. I even convinced one of my best friends to have her engagement party here because she was blown away with the food, drinks, and venue! The Food: Everything on the brunch menu is just flawless. I love the Filipino/Thai influence, with some Spanish elements. My favorites are the longonissa (sausage) paired with cucumber salad and garlic rice, along with the sizzling sisig and steak and eggs. For my friend's engagement party, we also tried the brioche French toast, and while seemingly out of place, it was fabulous. But seriously, the longonissa and garlic rice (with egg!) is just like how mom made it back at home in the far-off land of Los Angeles, California. The Drinks: Endless Mimosas. $15. What else can I say? If you're feeling frisky, try the seasonal Watermelon Mimosas and Lychee Mimosas. If you're a stickler for classics, then the Mango Mimosa won't hurt. Orange is boring, anyway. The Service: I've had delightful experiences with the staff there every time I've been (easily more than 15 times this past year). Additionally, during one of my drunken brunches, I ran into the owner, Chef Leah Cohen (a contestant from Top Chef), and spoke with her for a bit. She was very polite and lovely, ignoring the fact that I was happily drunk and telling her how much I loved her on Top Chef/loved the restaurant.The Venue: Although the location is basically Brooklyn (it's minutes away from the Williamsburg Bridge - Manhattan side), I can't complain. The paintings on the wall are great, the atmosphere is relaxing and not uptight, and the music they play is on point (early 90s rap/R&B). Seriously, nothing to complain about here. Although I haven't been in a month, I will be heading back soon. I cannot lie when I say that this is my go-to place for brunch on the weekends. Cannot wait to try their dinner soon!TIP: If you're like me and bring crowds of people with you, it's best that you bring CASH. While they will split your checks here with credit card, it will save you time to just divvy everything up with cash.",1,0,1,Samuel T.,"Manhattan, NY",56,43,5

Everything was pretty delicious, although we did not care for pork head (even if you get over what you're eating, it's really vey fatty).

4.0,9/21/2014,"After deciding not to wait over an hour to eat at Barrio Chino on a Friday night at 8, my date and I decided to check out the Filipino fare at Pig and Khao. Neither of us had ever dined at a Filipino restaurant before, and the only item I'd ever tried was lumpia, so this was sure to be an eating adventure.For anyone who might be afraid to try Filipino food due to a lack of familiarity, I'd say that despite the geographical differences, if you've ever had SE Asian cuisine (Thai, Malaysian, etc), there area number of menu options that should seem similar enough to make you feel comfortable, while still offering a Filipino twist.The inclusion of many small plates on the menu lends itself nicely to trying a number of different items and sharing food with others, and my date and I ordered three. We also ordered a bowl of cocout rice, which was really nice for mixing.For drinks, I ordered the Stinky Peat and my date ordered the Pigroni, and both were really good.-Sizzling Sisig8/10: The plate comes sizzling with pork and it's your job to cook the egg on top.. so it's a pretty cool presentation. There was very good flavor in the dish, and some of the pork was crunchy, while some was on the softer side. Overall, this was a tasty intro to Filipino food. I would order this dish again.-Pork Belly Adobo6/10: This came out while we were still working on the Sisig and it was almost a little overwhelming as the tables aren't very big. The flavor was good and the pork belly was tender, but the ratio of fat to pork was a little high for me here. I would not order this dish again.-Shan Noodles8/10: This dish came out last when we were almost already full. However, it was extremely flavorful and complemented the rest of the meal nicely. The flavor of these noodles reminded me of several SE Asian noodle dishes and it was a great way to finish the meal. I would order this dish again.Overall, this was a good dining experience. The service was reasonably good, the atmosphere was good for a date or a friendly gathering, and the food definitely made it worth coming back for another visit.",0,0,0,Jeremy M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0

3.0,9/15/2014,"PRO: - KHAO SOI - Pretty spicy but it was very good. I love the strong curry flavor and the crunchy toppings on the noodles. - BBQ Baby Back Ribs - very flavorful. Meat was about to fall off. It was very moist and juicy. EHH:- Cod in Banana Leaf - nothing special. It was tasted ok.- Grilled Sirloin - Very spicy and it taste eh. Mouth was on fire after eating this. I had to drink like 2 cups of water to make it go away.- Market Vegetable - Just Regular Chinese Choy Sum you can get at any chinese restaurant.- Grilled Pork Jowl - watermelon had a really nice lime/citrus/vinaigrette taste however the pork was ok. The watermelon was my favorite part.- Sizzling Sig Sig - Too salty and too much fat meat and cartilage- Ginataang Kalabasa - Did not like the sauce. Even though I liked the chinese long beans and the squash, the sauce ruined it. The sauce had this weird coconut milk taste and don't get me wrong I love coconut milk but this just didn't taste right.- Halo Halo - Overrated. It looks cool with the purple yam ice cream on the top but this dessert reminded me of sweet cereal (like fruit loops) and condensed milk. I thought this was too sweet for my liking.

2.0,9/9/2014,"I live in the neighborhood but as a vegetarian I always shied away from this place for obvious reasons -- until I read the review mentioning that a lot of their dishes can be made vegetarian.  I went to check it out and got a vegetarian version of the green mango salad and the khao soi.  They replaced chicken with tofu for both, and both dishes were too die for!!!  Very flavorful and just the right amount of spice.Unfortunately, on my second visit, I was informed that the ""vegetarian"" version of the khao soi actually has shrimp paste, and that *none* of the entrees could be made vegetarian.  So I was stuck with the mango salad and a side of morning glory.  Both were delish, but that's not a meal, and I am so sad I will never get to have that khao soi.  I find it interesting that places all over Southeast Asia were able to accommodate my vegetarian restriction but not a foodie restaurant in NYC.  Especially when the chef apparently said in an interview two years ago that she planned to  ""develop a few 'full and hearty' vegetarian options.""  I won't be back until they do. P.S. The fact that they didn't tell me about the shrimp paste the first time around is pretty disturbing.  Some people are allergic . . . .",1,0,0,Kate H.,"Manhattan, NY",7,17,0
4.0,9/8/2014,"What is wrong with people who gave this place bad reviews?Someone wrote ""too flavorful"" as a negative rev. Wait what? Since when is flavorful a failing?The dish I thought was delicious, bursting with flavors, an exciting party in my mouth. Mango salad was fresh, with a balance of sweetness and acidity, and of course like the streets of South East Asia- a pungent kick at the end. The strips of grilled chicken that came on top has a macho char, with spices like coriander seed, but then it's so juicy and delicate, perhaps due to having been basted  in a bath of coconut milk.The oyster with mantau was ingenious! Mantau was deep fried gleaming gold, and the sauce wakes you up. Your classic italian oyster dish should be very afraid.Khao soi was ok but not that impressive. That pumpkin soup (forgot the name) was sweet and silky smooth...my mind was quite blown.So perhaps Pig and Khao is not for the faint-tounged. Most definitely not for those who think that it is a Peruvian place. Pig and Khao, perhaps like the chaotic streets of South East Asia, can overwhelm you...the richness of coconut milk everywhere (including the good ole coconut rice) ,the pungent taste of fish sauce, the bird eye chili kick. But with an amazing balancing act by the chef and cooks, and an open mind from your end,,  these bursts of deliciousness are  truly a decadent experience. Ingenious without losing  the South East Asian authenticity.Thank you for a lovely meal Pig and Khao!",0,1,0,Isya H.,"Manhattan, NY",7,17,5
3.0,9/7/2014,"One of the three dishes we ordered gets 4 stars though. The four stars is for their Khao Soi (curry, coconut milk, chicken, noodles). This was freakishly delicious. I could be biased here since I totally got a thing for noodz and curry. The noodles were hidden in this big bowl of curry broth and topped w/ crunchy wonton strips (I think it was wonton strips. I could be wrong) that pretty much stayed crunchy until we finished the bowl. They also put strips of an egg omelet on top. Best idea ever! The coconut taste was light and super faint, but I ain't complain'- it still worked. What did a have a really strong coconut flavor was their side coconut rice. I was expecting just a hint of it, but it definitely came out more like a dessert. I was about ready to ask for some mangos to put on top of it. It didn't work too well w/ our savory dishes.We also ordered the Sisig, which is pieces of pork head w/ a fried egg on top. The waiter recommended it and said it was one of the more popular items. Sorry, but I didn't really care too much for this. First bite was great, but any more after that just felt too heavy. Think pork belly minus the pork in terms of texture and taste and uh, pure fat. I might have needed a whole side of rice just for a couple pieces. What's cool about this place- $15 for all you can drink PBR.

1.0,8/31/2014,"Fusion at its worst.We came, excited by the positive reviews.  Peruvian food was something I'd just gotten into and was absolutely in love with.  Another favorite to add to my list?  I sure hoped so.Things just didn't work out from there, unfortunately. We ordered the Bahn Xeo, which is the sizzling crepe with shrimp, bacon, and bean sprouts.  The crepe itself was soggy and dripping in oil, and the sauce tasted as if it came from a pre-made container (probably did).  We also ordered the sizzling sisig after its raving reviews, but it should be called sizzling fat of leftover meat instead. The salty flavor made my taste buds cry in thirst hours afterwards, and the meat honestly seemed like the ""take everything leftover from the kitchen and douse it in sauce and sizzle it"" kind of dish.  The garlic rice was literally some garlic stir-fried into rice (go to Gyu Kaku for some legit garlic fried rice) and the sausage was fat with a side of sausage.  Afterwards, I was so hungry because there was nothing I really could eat (compare to being in China with only street food available and a desire not to get sick), thus forcing me to speed walk to Russ and Daughters (which saved the day, as expected).I'm giving this restaurant one star because of the wonderful outdoor atmosphere.  And because I can't go any lower in rating.",3,1,1,Buggy Z.,"Cambridge, MA",242,307,748

I will stop trying hipster Asian restaurants.These are notes to myself, but perhaps they will be useful to others.  Perhaps you too have been lured by blogosphere buzz and the insouciant air of the serving staff. Or perhaps you were drawn in by the slightly punishing music.The only problem is, well, the food. The coconut rice is very good.  The pork jowl with watermelon and chicharron is the kind of dish that sounds really cool but lacked the intensity of flavor you're expecting. The mango salad is adequate but nowhere near as good as the mango salad in Thai places in Elmhurst. It just lacks that burst of pleasure and complexity of flavors. Finally, we had the sizzling sissig, which receives so many raves on here. My wife and I find the enthusiasm for this dish bewildering. The ratio of fat to meat in the pork pieces is ridiculous. Even if you are fan of pork fat, eating this dish is an unpleasant experience. Essentially the only protein you're getting is from the egg that is cracked on top.Hipster asian restaurants feel to me like *concept* restaurants. You are going there to enjoy the *idea* of the food you are eating and to enjoy the idea about yourself as the sort of person who enjoys eating at that restaurant.  My own grubby materialism prevents me from partaking in this pleasure.",3,2,0,Leonard F.,"Queens, NY",17,195,0

On the other side, they have some large plates and sides. For 2 people, they recommend 2 small plates and 1 large one. Whatever you decide to do, get it with a side of coconut rice because my god, that shit is delicious as ffff. The thing is, it's pretty pricy at Pig and Khao.

5.0,8/20/2014,"I was very pleasantly surprised to find the food to be absolutely delicious. I've read so many reviews, both on and off yelp, that gave Pig and Khao mediocre reviews, so I was honestly a little nervous about trying this place. Do not be scared. Don't let the reviews or menu scare or intimidate you, you have to give this place a shot! The ""small"" plates aren't ""small."" They aren't tapas size which is what I thought and two would be good for a pair of regular sized stomachs. If your stomach is on the larger side (which mine is about 2X bigger than that), go 3 dishes and a bowl (or two) of coconut rice. You have to get the sizzling ssig. It tastes like pork, served on a sizzling plate with a raw egg that you mix in and cooks on the hot plate. You have to eat this with coconut rice which my coconut hating fiance even loved. We also had the shan noodles and the crispy pata (large dish but i thought it was small). Both were also good, but the shan noodles was on the smaller size and the crispy pata was very fatty, which is supposedly how it's served. I highly suggest the ssig and loved the shan noodles, but the crispy pata isn't a must. I went with two other friends who went and loved everything they ordered.There's so much variety on the menu and while it does look a big crazy, don't let it get to you. I'm a bit picky with flavors and this place mixes all the flavors very well so you aren't going to taste one thing more than the other. They blend everything together to make it perfect.

3.0,8/14/2014,"I really wanted to love this place and give it a high recommendation but thinking back to the overall dining experience there were more average dishes than above average. I went on Wednesday evening with reservation. It was quite busy but we were seated promptly (albeit a tiny corner two-seater for three). Ordered Papaya Noodle Salad, Grilled Pork Jowl, Pork Belly Adobo, the highly anticipated Sizzling Sisig, Khao's Pork Ribs and Halo-Halo as dessert.First, the Papaya Noodle Salad was very tasty but it was a bit too salty for me. I actually had a few bites with jasmine rice (Who eats noodles with rice?). The Grilled Pork Jowl was interesting with watermelon but lack of jowl made it more of a watermelon dish. The Pork Belly Adobo and Sizzling Sisig was the highlight. Although both had similar flavor, it was nonetheless very good. The Pork Belly was cooked to perfection and the soft poached egg was pro style. The Sizzling Sisig was equally worthy of praise and I love the texture when all mixed in. All was good until the much buzzed about ribs came. Simply put, it was just overwhelmingly sweet. The ribs were cooked very well but it was just smothered in their sweetest Asian sauce to date. The Asian cole slaw accompaniment didn't really help. I had almost two ribs with half bowl of jasmine rice. Not really what you want to do when eating good ribs. And for dessert, the Halo-Halo was expected and glad it was not too sweet. It was quite refreshing after the ribs. Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience. The food was a bit of hit or miss but nothing too bad. The atmosphere is great for a small group get together - great for sharing. The unlimited self service Yuengling keg for $15 was a winner. The deco was a bit too try-hard Asian but not over the top.There's an open top dining court in the back. I would say if you like your food on the over-seasoned side then definitely go.

Well if she was around I wouldn't be asking you. Reservation was made a week before the dinner. They were not prepared and did not make us feel welcomed.

3.0,8/5/2014,"So...We came here and ordered the sisig, pork jowl and something else I forgot. Anyway, the pork jowl was the dish I was really looking forward to and unfortunately, I found a fat, live maggot in mine. At first I thought it was suppose to be there, (like those moving bonito flakes you find in okonomiyakis?) and I was about to eat THAT piece before I thought: wait a minute... It was quite large and stood on a piece of watermelon, literally waving at us. So we told the nearest guy we could find and turns out he was the manager, so he really took care of things. He asked me if I wanted to order something else and since it seems that the watermelon was the source of the maggot (everything else is cooked/heated), I had to choose something else instead of re-ordering the pork jowl. The nice part was that the entire meal was comped, that was totally unexpected. I also found relief that they told us they are double checking all the food to makes sure everything is okay (it is an open kitchen after all). It did leave a really uneasy feeling in us as we were really hesistant to eat anything, until the sisig came out (it's on this super hot sizzling platter, so that was safe..or at least dead). The sisig was alright, I think I like the one at Marhalika better. Super awkward, we left our waitress a tip and left.

It was pretty cool to see Leah Cohen from Top Chef working the operations in her own kitchen. I ordered the sizzling sisig with coconut rice which was the best dish in my opinion. Really enjoyed that. Also had the Khao Soi and Pork Belly Adobo. Both were just okay nothing special, probably wouldn't order again. What I don't understand is why they only serve the garlic fried rice for brunch! I may come back for brunch just for the sizzling sisig.

3.0,8/3/2014,"3 friends and I came in on a Sunday afternoon with a 1:15 resso and the place was actually pretty empty. They have a back patio, which seemed like the more popular choice - but we were seated inside.I ordered the longanisa sausage, which came with a fried egg, and a tomato cucumber salad. This was kind of pricey, considering that the same exact dish I've ordered at other Filipino places came with an extra egg and a side of garlic rice for the same price. And on top of that, the sausage wasn't even that great. It was just salty. Didn't have much else flavor to it. The tomato cucumber salad had too much of whatever vinegar dressing they used. So I guess the best part of the dish was the fried egg?I also opted for the unlimited mimosas ($15) because what's a Sunday brunch without a little bit of day drinking, amirite?! And for those of you wondering if Pig and Khao will try to G you on the refills, they don't. Once your glass is almost empty, they come around and ask you which flavor you would like next. You can choose from orange, lychee, mango or watermelon. I skipped orange, since it was too boring. Passed on the lychee since I don't like lychee. Watermelon was okay. But the better one I tried was probbo the mango one.Probbo will not be back. There are better places for Filipino cuisine for a better value.

Good music, but it got loud around 8pm and we kinda had to yell and repeat ourselves in conversation. Empty at 6.Service: Ok they were attentive with refills. Food comes out at different times (told us after we ordered). My friends got their food roughly 15-20 minutes before I did. Food: Small portions; kinda like tapas. This is how they make $$ because you aren't really full with one if their small dish which average around $16. We got the pork with pork grind and watermelon dish (forgot name) which was zesty salty and sweet; lots of fatty pork... The mussels were very small and some of them were not opened. None of the dishes come with rice, jasmine rice is $3...The curry noodles-khao soi was salty because the noodle to soup ratio was off.... there was very small pieces of meat and mainly consisted of soup and what seemed to be the chinese preserved/pickled cabbage. As a result the taste was savory curry like and slight tang/sour from the cabbage leaves. Taste was decent but not enough ingredients to call it a good dish. We shared halo halo which was yummy. Piece of pudding, coconut meat, shave ice, rice crispy cereal, condensed milk, and banana?

Flavors abound!Khao Soi- The curry was spicy and amazing. I drank it like it was soup. The egg noodles were also divine. I would come here just for this dishSig Sig- Not my favorite dish because it was a bit ""heavy"" for me, but the rest of the party enjoyed it so much they ordered a second plate. It was packed with flavor so you'll want to try this.Pork Belly Adobo- put an egg on anything and it's instantly deliciousSide Notes:Green rice dorade- a nice respite from all the pork, but they were able to sneak in some chinese sausage. It's quite a large portion considering it is under the ""small"" plate section. The sauce/soup was nice and acidic and I drank all of it.Pork Jowl- This comes with chicharron so don't order the chicarron snack at the beginning of the meal.I liked having the refreshing watermelon between bites of all the pork. While tasty, it ranked lower on the list.Green mango salad- comes with noodles. Nice and acidic.Shan noodles- Reminded me of pho.

The Bill will rack up!To start off the night, we ordered a plate of amazing mussels and got ourselves a red solo cup (15 per person) for unlimited beer from the keg which was Yeungling for the day. We then ordered three small dishes and one large. In terms of portion wise I would call the small dishes ~extra small and the large dishes ~small. But the flavors were amazing! My personal favorite was the sizzling sisig that I was even tempted to get a second plate even for the steep price! The pork belly was very tender and flavorful but didn't seem to stand out much. The grilled sirloin was cooked well but a bit on the rubbery side for my taste. Paired with a regular Thai sweet sour hot sauce, it didn't seem to stand out to me. For dessert we ordered the halo halo to sample it out.

2.0,7/23/2014,"I came here with my boyfriend last month without having made reservations. Pig and Khao is nestled away in the les so I figured if we were lucky enough to score a table, it wouldn't be as spacious as desired. Fortunately we were able to grab a ""table"" without waiting longer than two or three minutes. Our table was in between two larger groups and it was apparent that this table was added in to accommodate more guests. We were basically squished between the two groups. Too hungry to care, we flipped open our menus. We ended up ordering a viet coffee, watermelon canned beer, two small dishes (crab dish and noodle dish), a side of coconut rice, and pork rinds. The food was rather disappointing. I'm not sure if it's just because I  had high expectations or because I genuinely wanted to like the place. Either way the food wasn't great. The best part of our order was probably the pork rinds or the coconut rice, which is pretty sad. My boyfriend and I left pretty hungry and upset.

4.0,7/23/2014,"I still think about this place.First off let me start off by saying that just make a reservation, otherwise you may have to wait if it's a busy night. There is some strange deal where you can pay a lump sum and drink all the beer you want out of a shady cooler in the back yard. I ended up just getting a cocktail (Pigroni) and it was EXTREMELY strong and yet satisfingly enough girly that I could finish it. It's your typical LES restaurant: crammed, small, dim lighting, loud customers, and crazy good food. Pork belly adobo: Crunch exterior with my favorite juicy interior. I love pork belly. Sizzling sisig: My favorite dish of the night. I think perhaps the presentation helps but it comes out literally sizzling and crackling. The meat is flavorful, and I love blending it with the runny yolk egg. MMmm.Khao soi: If you like curry and you like noodles.. then this dish is for you. Perhaps not the best to get on a hot summer night. Green mango salad: I didn't realize they would serve you a hunk of chicken meat. I think we ordered this in hopes to counterbalance our extreme meatfest.. otherwise as long as you anticipate the pyramidal food chain balance, you should be fine. It wasn't anything special though, I would probably not order again. Coconut rice: Oh boy... why have I not had this before? Why why why? You are so delicious.. you creamy coconut you...

We were seated in the back garden patio, which was so perfect with the cute lights and artwork! I immediately noticed the keg - $15 for bottomless PBR is not a bad deal in NYC. We ordered the Genesee cream ale, the pork adobo, the cod in a banana leaf and the chicken curry with rice noodles. The pork adobo was pretty good - I love that it was served with a poached egg (my ultimate weakness). The cod was delicious as well, although a tad salty for my preference. IMO, the star of the show was the chicken curry with noodles. It was more similar to a soup, and almost reminded me of a more flavorful chicken pho. It was DELICIOUS!!! The Filipino and Burmese fusion spin definitely kicked the flavors up a notch.All in all, P and K is a great restaurant - loved the vibes and the food. The service was wonderful as well.

5.0,6/30/2014,"Before eating at Pig and Khao the only exposure to pan-Laotian cuisine I had was at a Northern Thai restaurant that served Papaya salad which I almost died eating (I am deathly allergic to tropical fruits). After eating at Pig and Khao, I can't stop wondering why in my almost 30 years of being alive I haven't had more of it.Regardless of my personal ineptitude in seeking out Southwestern Asian cuisine, I am always intrigued to try anything ""Filipino."" I was reading some Delta Airline magazine a while back about how Filipino chefs are starting to branch out and become more aggressive about starting up restaurants, selling food, etc. Whereas their entrepreneur spirit hasn't quite reached the same level as their Asian neighbors from the East (Thai, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, take your pick) I think Pig and Khao is a wonderful step in the right direction.My two friends and I stepped into P&K on a hot Sunday afternoon. The restaurant is tucked into an inconspicuous corner next to some Chinese grocery stores midway into Clinton St. so at first I was questioning whether we were walking the right direction, but the chalkboard signs outside and the glaringly Filipino designs bursting out of the doors next to the bar area reassuring told us that we were in the right place.I immediately cringed when my friend said we wanted to sit outside because of the weather that we had walked in to get to the restaurant -- turns out their outdoors seating area has a nice shady awning with an industrial sized fan which quelled any further reservations about outdoors seating.And of course the food. We came here during lunch/brunch hours so the menu was slightly limited than usual -- they had all the Filipino classics including corned beef hash which I fully intend to come back for next time I'm back in the neighborhood. Out of their carefully enumerated collection of Filipino-Laotian offerings, we chose to go with the Sizzling Sisig, the Khao Soi, the Shan Noodles, with sides of Garlic Fried Rice and Longanissa sausage.All of their offerings were superb -- The Sizzling Sisig with egg was the perfect blend of crunchy, chewy, and fatty gluttonous pork; the pig face somewhat reminded me of a crispy rendition of chiraga (Okinawan boiled/fried pig face dish). Give the egg about three to four minutes before mixing it into the ingredients and it meshes gloriously with the pork fat and the savory/sour seasoning (I tasted minuscule amounts of goya/tamarind with every bite.) The Khao Soi probably stole the show for three guys that have never had the dish before -- the curry was flavorful but not overbearing; I like the concept of serving semi-hard egg noodles with a heavy-ish broth, which allows you to really taste the depth of flavors at different stages of ""cooking."" (i.e. slightly bland when the noodle is still hard -- maximum penetration of flavors when the noodle becomes soft.) I personally thought the Shan noodles were what did me in; the sauce/broth had a very distinct fermented flavor but was refreshing at the same time -- I thought all the toppings came together very well.I wasn't overly satisfied with the garlic fried rice here and the longanissa was, well, longanissa -- blame me for liking bland-ish food, but I think the sour/tamarind flavor could have been absent from the already flavorful garlic fried rice.Overall, P&K provided us with an amazing dining experience -- I can't wait to come back and try some of their dinner offerings (I love me some adobo) and their corned beef hash.",1,0,0,Scott S.,"San Francisco, CA",156,470,670

I rather enjoyed the food I had here, although my pleasure was much interrupted by a delay in my order. Apparently there was a screwup with the technology and there was no food for about 50 minutes. Grr. (The make good was a dessert. Would have much preferred a discount than more food.)Anyway. Screwups aside, the food was pretty tasty. Don't get the chicharron though; it's not particularly flavorful and I was expecting something with a bit more crisp and less staleness.But just about everything else I tried was pretty good! I never thought I was an eggplant person, but the eggplant salad was just the right balance of mushy and crunchy from the nuts. The sisig is cut into small pieces so you don't have to tirelessly chew away at pig ear, and the sauce was very yummy. I was full but I kept picking at it with the bowl of fragrant and sweet coconut rice I ordered, which was so worth the extra calories. The Khao Soi was like Chinese yee mee noodles in a curry sauce. It was tasty but nothing special.The complimentary dessert was the turon. I didn't really care for the spring roll style banana fritters. The salted caramel ice cream was good but the chocolate sauce threw all the flavors off. I got a spicy cocktail that had a salt rim, and it was actually spicy, so that was good.If I ever come back here, I'll just be ordering a plate of sisig and a bowl of coconut rice and could leave happy and content.",1,0,1,Jin C.,"New York, NY",36,1100,328

Pork belly wasn't good; slices were too big, and 80% of it was fat. Not enjoyable. We tried to offset the overly rich(?), greasy taste of pork fat/cartilage with the (3) coconut rice but as an asian, rice shouldn't be this sweet. It was like they drenched it with candy and sugar. Very odd. Final dish came (4), and surprise - more pork fat/cartilage. Couldn't do it. Had 1 bite and almost threw up. I was so grossed out by the restaurant I couldn't even look at the food anymore. We really wanted to try the Halo Halo dessert, but honestly, I just wanted to get out of there and go eat something to wash off the taste of pig fat. We asked for the check and rushed out. Service was super nice though - hence the 3 stars. They took the (2) Crispy Pata off the menu because they saw that we barely touched it. Much appreciated. Overall, this was my first filipino experience, and I really wished I chose to go to that other joint in the East Village. PS. They have a garden in the back. It's quiet compared to the very lively dining room, but nothing special. Too dark for dinner. Would be nice for lunch.",1,0,0,Brad P.,"New York, NY",274,237,35

5.0,5/18/2014,"Bestie lives around this joint, we came one night for dinner. Small little place, big on flavors! Wow! Jo immediately tells us what to order since shes been here before. I was too carried away by the food that I did not take a second to check out the decor.1. Sizzling Sisig, one of their top sellers, lives it up to its name! Dish came to our table still sizzling, sunny egg on top was still trying to cook. Fatty succulent pork in the chili type sauce, with the yolk dripping down, was unbelievable.2. Baby Back Ribs, cooked till almost falling off the bone. It's got a nice chew to it, don't think it would taste as great if they cooked it even longer. They use their own blend of special bbq sauce, off the hook! Asian slaw had a tangy dressing.3. Khao Soi, you can taste the coconut, never had better red curry! Egg noodles cooked perfectly, chicken was tender. Even after we killed the noodles we ordered a bowl of their coconut rice to finish off the curry sauce.4. Pumpkin Barrel, waitress recommended us this  after I mentioned I'm more of a beer person. And I gotta say it was good, malty, barely and pumpkin is very settled. Never tried or even heard of this one before. Checkout their drink menu, they have an assortment of Asian beers as well as cocktails.

I didn't come very hungry and just ordered garlic rice and a side of longanisa sausage for brunch which are both staples when it comes to Filipino food. Both were great except I literally poured a small dish full of oil from my rice, which was really unappetizing! Other dishes I've tried include the sizzling corn beef hash and Khao Soi (red curry). Not bad but nothing worth remembering.I still rank Maharlika over this place! Though it might be a tiebreaker between their playlists.

5.0,5/14/2014,"I found this place by pure accident on a day when I was waiting for a friend's meeting to be over. I intended to walk down the street to a bakery, but after turning the corner and walking about 5 feet, I was confronted with an irresistable smell of MEAT. It was undeniable that someone, somewhere nearby was making something absolutely delicious with MEAT. I about-faced and that is when I found Pig and Khao. It wasn't even time for a meal, but the call of meat was not to be ignored. I ordered the bottomless mimosas (Lychee) (and yes, I will not infrequently decide impromptu that a day requires bottomless mimosas) and the pork jowl. Pork Jowl was amazing from the first bite to the last. The pork was rich in flavor and texture, and it comes in a bed of roasted brussel sprouts with some kind of a vinegar tangy sauce that is just heaven with the heaviness of the jowl. Also, while I was eating, I noticed that some other people ordered some other dish that smelled like meat heaven, and I was insanely jealous. If i didn't have a lunch obligation in less than an hour or if I had chugged more mimosas to cloud my judgement, I would have ordered that too, OORR walked over and asked if I could just have on teentsy bite of theirs. Whatever that was, order it. Ask the server what the amazing smelling sizzling meat fit for gods and goddesses is called.",1,3,1,Lindsay H.,"San Diego, CA",185,295,35

I tried as many of their dishes as I could, and I can honestly say I was a fan of everything. The food here is so good and comforting. The one dish I recommend that everyone should get is the sizzling sisig, the aroma of this dish is so enticing. This dish is a classic in Filipino cuisine. The pork jowl is one of my faves, especially if you're a roasted brussel sprouts lover like me. You might overlook the coconut rice, but please don't. It's as strong as any other dish, the best I've ever had. The khao soi is great if you want noodles and heat! It was a bit too spicy for me but I'm weak when it comes to spicy foods. Their mussels dish is unique in a sense that it's served with a sweet pineapple curry broth and deep fried baos for dipping. The crispy pata is slightly elevated than the traditional dish, but very good especially with the liver sauce that's served. The flan and Ube ice cream is amazing in their halo halo. I honestly love every dish. The environment is very chill and embodies the personality of the workers.

3.0,5/8/2014,"3 stars only because I was expecting a kick in the spice from the Pork Belly Adobo. Other than that, I think the menu definitely has variety. You can go from purely Filipino food to a fusion dish. I ordered Sisig, Crispy Pata and the Pork Belly Adobo. Sisig is different and had a distinct flavor (good!), crispy pata was not as moist but still delicious and Pork Belly Adobo, well, was a bit disappointed - I should probably request addl Szechuan corns. Nonetheless, I would definitely come back again, my experience was positive here.Make sure to do reservations because the place does get packed.

4.0,5/3/2014,"This place was absolutely delicious. Some friends and I went on a hunch that it was going to be good, and it did not disappoint. We were 4, and their recommendation was to get 4 small plates and one large plate. We did well with the 4 small plates, but with a bigger appetite, the ribs looked mighty fine. Sizzling sisig was fabulous! My favourite of the 4. All the absolutely delicious edible parts of a pig head with a cooking egg on top. Pork belly adobo was a close second. An explosion of flavour with an appropriate amount of crispness of the skin.  Khao soi was okay. Good flavour curry, but the crispy soggy noodles on top-ish lowered the quality. My least favourite was the Shan Noodles. Too much heat, not enough flavour!All in all, I will definitely be a repeat customer, ambiance was fantastic.. Service, on point.. Food, delicious!

The menu was very limited so we had no problem choosing what to eat right away. For a party of three we ordered three small dish and one large one. The dishes came out swiftly since it was a quiet Wednesday evening. The sizzling sisig was pretty flavorful with different textures. Some were soft, some were crispy and other parts were just chewy. It was a little too salty for eating straight up without rice. The cod in the banana leaf was cooked perfectly. They were not kidding when they meant small plate. The khao soi which was the red curry with coconut milk and egg noodles. I am not a big fan of red curry so I didn't try it. From looks it was mostly fried noodles on top and very little egg noodles. We also order the crispy pata which reminds me of the crisp roast pork from Chinatown. It wasn't very impressive.

It was delicious).  It has a young hip vibe... You can order bottomless PBR and they give you a solo cup and direct you to a keg outside.  The music was mostly rap (Tupac, Kendrick, etc) which is a first for me at a restaurant but weirdly fit the place perfectly (it wasn't loud or obnoxious). Literally my only complaint is that I thought the tasting menu was too much food but that's hardly a thing to complain about. We just took home leftovers.  Not sure I'd classify it as a $$ kind of place... Maybe $$$. Our bill was $150 before tip for 3 cocktails, 1 bottomless PBR, and 2 tasting menus.

Tables were all filled when we sat down. So business here is good but not overwhelming. Also, there were no heat lamps outside (it was kind of chilly).I had the sizzling sisig and some of the khao soi. Both were okay. The sisig was pretty heavy after eating it - and needed rice to go with it. The waiters also emphasize family style strongly but having 1 dish to yourself is totally fine and enough (We didn't follow their suggestions haha).

We spent almost 2 hours there, and we were probably eating for about 15 minutes of that time. Although its bottomless mimosas, they are really slow in bringing you refills.

Honestly, I'm not here to burn and and will get to the point in a second but I used to know a bunch of Asian chicks from San Fran that loved this place and used to invite me there for happy hour. Never went because it seemed out of the way. Then, my girlfriend saw Leah Cohen on TV, said she wanted to go and when we happened to walk by it, by chance, a few nights later we decided to give it a try.So.....here's the deal:Service-perfectly fine. We walked in on a Saturday night without reservations and they sat us Menu-server indicated it was a family style and that all plates were meant to be shared. Menu divided into two categories: small and large, with the emphasis being on small. Irrespective of category, the main missing component was flavor. The red curry wings had zero heat and a taste more reminiscent of grocery store bottled curry than anything else. The crispy pata won points for the texture of the skin but was as flavorless as the two boring sauces that were served as accompaniments. Better off going to a $10 Puerto Rican spot if you want pork like this. The saving grace was the dessert but then again you could find something remarkably similar to this for less money in Chinatown or fort lee. Super disappointingBooze-do I expect to find in a place like this an offer for serve yourself unlimited pbr draft for $15? If this is to do compensate for the poorly conceived menu, then at least offer something more tolerable than cheap college swill. On the other hand, the pigroni was a nice drink....if only they could offer it to go.I just don't get the hype surrounding this place.

4.0,3/22/2014,"Pig and Khao fits right in with the recent trend of trendy ethnic-influenced restaurants sprouting up in New York. Like many other Lower East Side establishments, the space is cozy, the diners are young, and the flavors are bold. The food is served family style, which is perfect for sampling the different Filipino-influenced dishes Pig and Khao serves up.  It's not perfect but the food is interesting enough that it's worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood.As the name suggests, the menu is very meat heavy, although there are a few fish and seafood dishes available (none in our party ordered these but maybe next time!). I would think twice about coming if you're vegetarian, unless you're happy with just vegetable sides and rice.Speaking of the rice, make sure to order the coconut rice. The slightly sweet and creamy rice will go well with the savory meat-based dishes. Jasmine rice is another option, but at the same price coconut is the winner.Of course, now for the entrees... they're divided into small and large plates. (Think of small as something on the larger than a tapas portion but smaller than your usual entree). If you like pork, you won't go wrong with the grilled pork jowl and pork belly adobo.  The adobo's poached egg and the thick pieces of crispy pork belly, reminded me of eggs and bacon on steroids... in a good way. We also ordered two of the large plates, the baby back ribs and the short ribs. Maybe it was an off night, but while seasoned and sauced well the baby back ribs were disappointingly overcooked.  However, the short ribs were cooked to melt-in-your-mouth perfection.For some lighter fare, Pig & Khao also offers a mango and Chinese sausage salad. I would go with the mango. The Chinese salad didn't offer enough sausage to please our carnivore-sides and the bibb lettuce and other vegetables weren't interesting enough to make up for it.  The mango salad was was a great combination of sour, sweet, and tangy flavors though.After a meal that rich, dessert wasn't really necessary - but maybe next time!",2,1,1,Joey X.,"Manhattan, NY",20,119,0
1.0,3/21/2014,"I came here tonight so excited with such high expectations and was ready to have a delicious meal. But WOW was I so wrong and I was so let down and insulted by this place. Or rather not the place but the blonde hostess. I came in 15 to 9 pm and asked how long a wait for two would be. I got the answer ""about 15 mins"", which sounded great to me.... Boy was this woman lying straight to my face. As me and my date sat and waited patiently, I noticed another party of two come in and told to sit and wait. 20 mins in (past the supposed 15 min wait) this hostess comes and sits the couple that CAME AFTER US. By this point I was thinking no big deal.. Its totally cool. Min by min passed, I look around and see two damn tables cleared and would you believe it they were set with tableware and everything. Im wondering why isn't she sitting us there but continued to wait. Then guess what! Another couple comes in and they sit for a total of 5 mins, FIVE MINUTES and she comes and sits them before US again! This was already 40 mins into the original ""15 min wait"".  Anger doesn't even describe how I felt, but to put the cherry on top she comes over to me to tell me pathetically the ""the table I have for you well the people haven't left yet, they are chatty"" -_- really you don't say? Cause I had no idea people actually have conversations when they go to dinner. How about you sit me at one of the two EMPTY tables. My money must have not been good enough for this establishment, which is totally alright by me. Wont be returning or recommending to anyone. It was beyond ridiculous. And why she even had the audacity to look at me with shock as I left is beyond me... You wait 40 mins, have others seated before you and then have to stare at two empty tables while no one else is coming in. Thanks for NOTHING.",1,1,1,Roxii M.,"New York, NY",2,36,76

Drinks at this spot are crazy cheap - you can get Genny cream ales in a can for $3 or bottomless PBR's for $15. Either way you can't go wrong.Food was delicious. Reminded me of my travels across Asia. I had the pork jowl with Brussel sprouts and the mussels. Both of them were exploding with taste and spice.

It's not a complex dish, but it's well executed. They bring it to you on a hot cast iron pan and you mix the egg into the meat. Only wish there were two eggs. Would go well with rice if you're into that kinda stuff.Pork jowl -- it's zesty/tangy, where I prefer salty. This dish was mostly grilled veggies, and I wouldn't get it again. Not that it was bad -- the menu was just not descriptive enough about it. Interesting flavor for sure.Mantao -- they're fried, which is unusual. I'm used to eating them plain, and I wanted them plain. There's salt or sugar or something on them, too. The crispy outside and fluffy inside made this typically chinese-style bun into a western bread. Still prefer them plain, but I ate and enjoyed all of them.",0,0,0,David O.,"Queens, NY",333,64,1

They're also great reminders that meat means more than just a piece of steak.  Most other items on the menu rotate seasonally.  Coconut rice is a must, but the side vegetables are felt more like an afterthought. We got Choy Sum to satisfy our daily servings of vegetables and that's pretty much all it did.  No special seasonings or prep.Drinks were good, but I wouldn't got out of my way for any one drink in particular.  Be sure to make a reservation!",0,0,0,Irene D.,"Paris, France",168,111,5
4.0,3/10/2014,"Very affordable for the area. The pig head and shaved ice were really flavorful, and the pig head was something that is relatively uncommon outside a traditional Chinese restaurant. The staff, however, is probably high.... and not on life. They're pretty absent minded, rigid about where we can be seated even when nobody else is around, and just not a lot of attention to detail. It goes with the territory though (Village), and nothing was really a big deal impact to our experience. Just not polished, which is fine, especially at the fair prices. The bathroom was clean and the food was good. That's what's important!",0,0,1,Jason H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",109,87,43

We shared the sisig, adobo, dorade, and coconut rice. We had hoped to order the short rib, but it wasn't available so we ordered the pata instead. Everything was delicious, flavored really well. The sauce for the dorade was light and very pleasing. We also shared the turon which was perfectly paired with salted caramel ice cream and the halo halo which wasn't the greatest in my opinion. I've had great halohalo, from the Philippines, to New York to California, and I found this halo halo was way too milky.

4.0,3/5/2014,"If there is one dish you get here - let it be the sizzling sisig. It's absolutely glorious. It's no secret that Filipinos know how to work a pig. This dish takes it a step further by giving you the parts of a pig's head. It's a delicious mix of fatty, meaty & crunchy parts. Make sure to squeeze all the lime juice in cuz it adds balance and freshness to the dish - and what a beautiful, juicy slice of lime it is. I don't usually get this excited about lime but this was quite exquisite. The dish comes with a raw egg in the center for you to mix in with the piggy parts. Actually it's already half cooked by the time it arrives because the dish is very hot. There is also just the right amount of cilantro to garnish.  (5/5)I loved the green rice crusted dorade as well - crunchy on the outside and perfectly cooked on the inside. It came in a yuzu dashi which also had cockles (salt water clams) and many hidden pieces of chinese sausage. I felt like I was in a treasure hunt when looking for these delicious morsels in the sauce. They had run out of bok choy, which is the usual vegetable to accompany this dish so they used choy sum instead - which i actually prefer.  (4/5)The last dish we had here was the khao soi. This dish was the reason I came here. I've been looking for good khao soi in NY for the last 15 years but I haven't found it yet. Unfortunately it looks like that search is going to continue. To be fair, this is a Thai dish so I wasn't sure what this was doing on the menu in the first place but the name is Pig & Khao, so......   Anyways, the noodles weren't bad but the curry was another story. It tasted nothing like a good red curry should. I  liked the heat level but the curry tasted too much like curry powder. (3/5)I also highly recommend getting a coconut rice to go with your dishes. It really complements the flavors in all the dishes. These were 3 ""small dishes""  (they had recommended 2 small and 1 large for the two of us) but that was good enough for us as we weren't too hungry and had kinda just walked in on a whim. They didn't have a table available and the wait was 15 minutes so we sat at the counter. BIG MISTAKE. Our clothes have been smelling like a bbq pit for days.

I asked for them to change the music, because offensive rap actively agitates me... They said that's how the owner rolls, so they can't change the music.  Asked for the food to go, they said they don't do food to go.  I walked out.  If you love rap music, this place may be great... but if you don't like rap, I suggest avoiding the place.",4,3,0,G L.,"Manhattan, NY",55,33,0
5.0,3/2/2014,"Because of places like Pig and Khao and my recent trip to Southeast Asia, I'm now obsessed with Filipino food.  WHERE HAS ALL THIS FLAVOR EXPLOSION BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!?!I went with about 12 coworkers for dinner (obviously make reservations people, this place gets crowded) which was awesome because we pretty much got 2 of everything on the menu. Here are some things that still keep me drooling at the thought almost a month later:- Sizzling Sisig: honestly, we eat really gross stuff in America so just forget for a second that you're eating pork head here and you'll be fine all you unadventurous people- Mussels: even this has a flavorful Thai kick- Mantao Buns: I know it's just fried dough but it's SO GOOD. Even at the end of dinner where I was too full to even try the Baby Back Ribs, I kept eating these Mantao Buns. - Lamb Neck: how can you go wrong with lamb?- Coconut Rice: so sweet and flavorful - Cod in Banana Leaf: almost anything that comes in a banana leaf is excellent. Fact.  I can't wait to come back and pig (and khao) out again. Sorry I just had to.",7,2,3,Tam L.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",231,160,26
5.0,3/1/2014,Had a fantastic meal here. Loved the vibe if the restaurant from the music to the open kitchen. We were here for brunch. Ordered the sizzling sisig and the bahn xio. The sisig was really good - mixed the egg in and it had a fantastic spice and flavor combination. The bahn xio with the Bibb lettuce was also excellent with the shrimp cooked perfectly. Liked the vinegar on the side. The highlight of the meal however was the incredible garlic fried rice. It was fantastic - the rice was perfectly crispy and garlicky.

Reading reviews, we didn't even order the most popular dishes so will def. go back.  Did the banana leaf wrapped cod, pork belly, and ribs - oh my god. All of them, I wanted to lick the plates.  The rice was great for soaking up the rest of the sauce.  Price is right too - 'bout $115 for 1 snack, 2 smalls, 1 large and drinks for 2 - since you don't need to order a ton.  Super small spot, but lively with the kitchen on display, and they played late 90s/early '00 rap/ hip hop the whole time.

The rest were still very good but not stellar.   As expected with a restaurant that has self-serve bottomless beer, the ambience was fun and casual.  Unfortunately, their service wasn't very consistent.   The food came in spurts. Our mussels were served at the very end of our meal as if they forgot.  Also, when we tried to order dessert they abruptly told us they didn't have any (granted we were they very late but it still left a bad impression with me).

Everything was delicious and well worth the wait.To start - there isn't a sign outside, so it was a bit hard to find in an area of the LES that doesn't brag much in terms of bars or restaurants for that matter. So to wait, there weren't many choices as to where to linger at as Pig & Khao itself was so busy - there wasn't room for overflow inside. After a longer than anticipated wait, I ordered the Khao Soi - which is spicy and rich - and the coconut rice. The noodles were chewy, chicken was cooked perfectly. Now, the coconut rice was completely unnecessary for me to order as this was a noodle dish, but I was so glad I did as it soaked in the curry sauce - the rice was to die for. Our waiter was attentive and helpful - his recommendation was for everything family style - but sometimes I have a problem with that as people have different dietary restrictions... so I opted out of that. My only complaint would be that the beers come in cans. I always prefer a draft over a can. But we switched to wine and everything was fine. My only other complaint would be the noise level.

That made it all the more cool.I ventured from the Delancey Street station into the 10 degree night over to Clinton Street.  I was struck by how much the area reminded me of Alphabet City a very long time ago.  Industrial storefronts mixed with small, high-end fashion storefronts and cool up and coming restaurants.  I actually walked right by Pig & Khao due to my interest in all the other interesting things going on around me.  It's a small place.I hiked it back to the restaurant and was greeted by a gorgeous hostess who was graciously understanding about my tardiness and offered me a drink while I waited for my date.  I ordered an ""FTP"" appleton vx, cognac, peach, cinnamon bark....so good I proceeded to have more than I could count.Once seated, we chose the chef's five course tasting menu.  I was a little resistant because I was sure I wanted to have the Grilled Pork Jowl dish and wasn't sure we'd get it.  Our waiter assured us we'd get it. Amuse bouche:....kind of a fried shrimp with a salsa and creamy, spicy sauce which definitely amused my bouche.Fried Blue Point Oysters with a garlic, ginger, chilies and lime- juice dipping sauce. I like oysters, but when I saw fried oysters, I was a little hesitant.  Once I put one in mouth, I instantly changed my mind.  The combination of the texture and the dipping sauce was sensational.Grilled Pork Jowlbrussel sprouts, toasted rice, lime-chili, fish sauce, herbs. The pork was tender and flavorful and the brussel sprouts were more shaved than sprouts and they were cooked just the way I liked them...slightly sautéed/burned.  The whole dish had a citrus finish.Coconut Rice:Can't say enough about the coconut rice.  Never had it before....Now if I'm going to eat white rice at home (and I don't do that often), I'm going to find out how to make it.  It has to be the best white rice I've ever eaten.BBQ Chicken:The chicken was tender and hot and the barbecue sauce was tangy and spicy.  It wasn't your typical BBQ chicken.  Can't put my finger on it, so to speak, but it definitely had a Filipino flair to it.Khao Soi:Red curry, coconut milk, chicken, egg noodles, pickled mustard greens, shallots.  I almost wish they'd served this first.  I love soup and I love noodles.  By the time this arrived, my little stomach was nearly full. Even though this is family style and we shared everything, the plates were ample...we were at our limit.  The curry was out of this world.  The soup was rich and thick, the noodles were flavorful...it was one of the highlights.Turon:banana fritter, salted caramel ice cream, chocolate sauce. So freakin good.  The ice cream really was salted...perfect amount of salt to complement the sweetness of the fritters.In addition to the menu, the classy staff and the overall feel of the restaurant, they played a cool rotation of music that just topped off the package.  One of my new faves in NYC.",2,1,2,Lisa B.,"Greenwich, CT",647,475,250

The restaurant is nice, the staff is sweet, but the food for the price just isn't worth it. We sat at the bar because we didn't have a reservation and there weren't any open tables. This turned out to be a good move because we had a lot of space, more than usual at a bar seat, and we had the extra entertainment of being right in front of the kitchen. For food, I had the pork belly adobo ($13) and my friend had the khao soi ($16), we both had the coconut rice ($3 each). Everything came out really fast but the portions for some things were crazy small! The khao soi was a good amount of food and paired well with the coconut rice, which was delicious. The pork belly however, was really good but there were only 4 slices. Four. Slices. of Pork. Belly. I'm sure your doctor would be happy about that, but I think $13 should earn you a little more than that.

3.0,1/13/2014,"So I went to Pig and Khao tonight, again, and brought my cousin and his girlfriend who are both chefs in New England.  I love the food there!  Still do despite the ridiculous experience that we had with the chef tonight.  My cousin and his girl have been here for 3 days now and I have taken them to a multitude of places.  At the end of dinner my cousin expressed that he was most impressed with the food at Pig and Khao and he would love to say thanks to the chef and just ask some questions about her inspiration with the food.  Her staff was great, one of the gentleman is actually from the same area that my cousin is from so the energy was there. Chef Leah had been there all night looking after the kitchen staff. Not to mention it's a Monday night and the restaurant was not really busy at all.  I told my cousin just ask the server to have her come over, she is right there.  You could tell the waiter was apprehensive.  I watched, with my own eyes, the server told her we would like her to come over, she glanced at the table, took a sip of her drink and rolled her eyes.  She walked by our table two times, going to the front bar making small talk with the new bartender, who was great, and then walking back to the kitchen, about 5 minutes had passed by then poof she disappears.  The bill comes, $249.00 spent between 4 people.  A great dinner, again I have no qualms with the food but Chef Leah, no hospitality what so ever, even on a Monday night.  She is the prime example of why I am fed up with the food industry in NY.  Attitude and lack of hospitality. I really would have loved to have Chef Leah do a Master Chef class at my culinary center.  Granted, I am no ICE but even still, I would have loved to bring attention to her food and passion to people who do not travel far out of their comfort zone but because we were not a food critic for NY Times or someone who she deemed important, she passed us on by.  I have welcomed pig and khao to NYC with open arms and defended the restaurant when others claimed that in this sea of culinary adventure, otherwise known as NYC, that this restaurant  wasn't that good at all but now.... I will never go there again. It is not worth my time or my money. What makes me laugh about it all is finding this video of a very phony experience that Chef Leah claims to offer.  Instead of blaming her restaurant group for her failure, maybe she should study hospitality, a virtue that doesn't seem to come naturally to her. It seems that this might be the true struggle with her restaurant.  tmz.com/2013/09/19/top-c…",0,0,0,Carey N.,"Brooklyn, NY",106,2,0
1.0,1/8/2014,"Really bad.  The flavor profiles of the food are incredibly erratic or not present at all.  The wine selection is poor and the definitely served me a glass that was at least 2 days old.  Also, it's super gross to see their cocktail rinse bucket front and center in the window as you walk in.  Rearrange the bar guys.  In addition, I know that people smoke, but it's really gross to watch your servers (all but one at the same time) go outside to take a cigarette break with the woman who's been in the kitchen all night (I would call her the chef or cook, but she wasn't wearing any chef gear and didn't have her hair covered even though she was over the grill the entire time).  The all went out front together, smoked, and then came back in and started serving again.  I'm hoping they washed their hands but I wasn't paying that close attention.  It seems more like a group hang out than a restaurant.  The music didn't help that vibe either.  If I'm not mistaken music is supposed to be ambiance right?  I really don't need your personal preference shoved down my throat and I get some of the big name chefs like to 'play what they would listen to in the kitchen' but honestly are you a big name chef?  Customer service should be number one.",0,0,0,Natalie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,23,0

Great contrast of texture- sirloin with a spicy sauce (not sure what it's called) this was our least fav but it was cooked well and came with cabbage leaves to wrap it in. It just felt like it needed a something more... Maybe more acid?- koh soi - I've never had this before so nothing to compare it to but it was so good! Spicy curry like with noddles and chicken..

Came here after a friend recommended this place over Jeepney. Had the pork belly and sirloin, and I was pleased with both. My friend and I both ordered jasmine rice to accompany the entrees. The rice was dry and not very well-made. Not sure how they messed up boiled white rice, but they did. This was at dinner on a Saturday night, by the way. Also it was $3 for one order of that terrible rice. This was the third Filipino/Thai/fusion place I've tried.

1.0,12/31/2013,"I've never written a review here but my experience here provoked me to write one.  Let me start with the service. I made a reservation thru open table for 3 persons at 8:15pm. We got to the restaurant at 8:10pm and the receptionist told us that our table is 'not quite ready' yet. So we sat in the waiting area while seeing 3 vacant tables. We waited for 20 minutes and repeatedly asked the receptionist if she can give us a table already. She finally gave us a table. We ordered Sisig, Crispy Pata, Mussels, Halo-halo and Vietnamese coffee. I was born and raised in the Philippines so I know how Filipino food should taste like. It is understandable that the food was going to be fusionized and altered in order to cater to customers that have never tried authentic Filipino/Thai food. The Sisig is the better one among everything else. But it was missing a lot of ingredients and was full of fats instead of pig organs. The Crispy Pata, that did not taste like Crispy Pata, came when we were almost done with the meal. The Mussels were okay because it had coconut spiced sauce. Then, the Halo-halo came. Since people here in yelp said that it was really good, we ordered it to make ourselves feel better about the bad entrees. However, the Halo-halo was like cereal(rice crispies) in milk topped with shaved ice, 10 pieces of coconut strips and old and hard cubes of banana, topped with ube ice cream. Halo-halo means ""mix-mix"". I guess they were mixing crappy disgusting ingredients. And we heard that several suggestions were already addressed by customers in order to improve the quality and the taste of the food. This place is fooling a lot of white people. I'll be surprised if it lasts another year (unless changes are gonna be made).",7,4,3,Carol U.,"Brooklyn, NY",68,12,11
3.0,12/24/2013,"After my trip to Manila as a child, I sometimes need a reminder of what good Filipino food tastes like. Although it's not my favorite cuisine that I crave all the time, I still am willing to go once in a while... besides it's Jon's fave so I can't say no haha. As we drove over to LES and went to look for Pig and Khao... we were pleasantly surprised by how cute this place is. The lighting is dim, and very intimate. The outside area is lit by colorful lights and is a nice little ""back yard"" area which is very cozy, especially when it's warm out.Jon and I always enjoy a good dish of Sisig whenever we can find it... but that was not the best thing that Pig and Khao has to offer. It was a pretty decent dish, but we've tried it at other places where we enjoyed it more. We also had the Crispy Pata/ crispy pork legs and I wasn't a huge fan. I did see Jon polish most of the plate though. I needed to pair it with some coconut rice and a fresh spiked coconut because I like things a little more mild in taste... and who doesn't love a fresh alcoholic coconut beverage? Lastly, our favorite here was definitely the Halo-Halo... which was simply crack. Wow, we've had Halo-Halo at other places... and we've had really good home made Halo-Halo... but this was the best ever. If you're not in the mood for dinner, just come for some Halo-Halo.

I left the restaurant underwhelmed.The vibe was kind of cool... though maybe the music was a little offensive for dinner. The place is clean and the tables are close. We pretty much ate as a party of five, as opposed to it being the 2 of us, but such is dinner in NYC. We started with the sisig, which is sooooo recommended, not only on yelp, but also by the waiter. The first few bites were good, then my mouth was just coated in fat, and I was eating fat, and it was all fat, fat, fat. If you decide to order this dish, I highly recommend ordering it with rice. You totally need a bland carb to cut all of the fat you will be consuming. I don't understand how complimentary rice isn't served with this dish.My husband had the sirloin, and that was pretty darn delicious.Now for the Khao Soy... sigh... I feel like this is a very personal dish. People have the way they like it, and any other variation is going to be ill received. I prefer Khao Soy with a thicker, sweeter broth, a ton of cilantro, lime, and the right amount of crunch. This dish had good heat and good crunch but was missing some richness, or some decadence. I wish it was sweeter, I wish it had more lime/cilantro accompaniments. It didn't cure my Khao Soy craving. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't what it should be... for my taste.The fried banana fritters were good too.

We had to wait a few minutes for our table to be cleared. In the meantime we got drinks from the bar. [Side note: the waiting area is very small and there is no bar perse except for where the bartender actually makes the drinks] I had two Pigronis [$12] [gin, campari, and grapefruit juice]. One before my meal [I was feeling pretty good, as the bartender went heavy handed with the gin] and one during. My friend and I shared everything. The waiter recommended 2 small plates and one large, but we got 2 instead [overkill]. Sizzling Sisig [$14]: As everyone else has said, it's amazing. Diced up pork head with a raw egg on top- pretty freakin' ridiculous. It's even more incredible with the coconut rice [$3] [slightly sweet paired with salty].  Mussels [$16]: Equally as delicious as the Sisig. The pineapple curry broth was outstanding, creamy and rich, especially when the shells of the mussels became a  vessel to slurp from. The mantao buns [!!!!!] were so so so good. At first I was confused and thought they were potatoes, potatoes they were not. Crispy Pata [$26]: Fried pork, that's all you really need to know. It was similar to Talde's Korean Fried Chicken. The dipping sauces were an excellent accompaniment. Lamb Neck [$24]: At this point in the meal, we were really full. Then out comes a ginormous lamb neck. Ugh, and that kale and potato puree. Of what I could eat of it, it was delicious. Somehow we actually had dessert. The halo-halo [$8] was pretty good, I think it's better at Talde though. I especially enjoyed the leche flan in it.

4.0,11/24/2013,"Filipino fusion is trending in NY of late but so far I haven't been impressed too much. Of course, being Filipino makes me hard to please in this regard. I want a restaurant that would simultaneously remind me of home while being able to compete in the NY food scene. Of the Filipino restaurants I've been to in NY, my favorite is Purple Yam in Brooklyn. Like Purple Yam, Pig and Khao is authentic but it's also trendier, not just with its LES location but with the restaurant's decor, hip atmosphere, and even its choice of soundtrack. After my first visit I've definitely decided that it's going to be my go to Filipino spot in Manhattan. But for now I'm holding off on giving them a 5th star because the service was not that great when we went for brunch and I'd like to see if the food will be consistently good. Since we were there for weekend brunch a couple of us tried their unlimited mimosas. I recommend the mango over lychee or watermelon. For the food, we ordered the sizzling sisig, the classic 'longsilog' which is sausages and eggs, and the curry noodles. One thing I'd say they are doing wrong is that none of the brunch entrees come with garlic fried rice even though typical Filipino breakfasts always always come with rice. That said, the sisig is exactly how it should be and is delicious! I've heard good things about their halo-halo but we were quite full for dessert so I'll have to try that another time.

We arrived at noon, and they must have just opened because we were one of the first to be seated. Which was fortunate, since it got pretty crowded about 45 minutes later. The space is quite small, and the décor is nothing special. To be honest, I was uncomfortably chilly since they kept the front door and back window open the entire time.Fast forward to the food and drinks: The lychee mimosas were delicious, but weak. And the mango mimosa tasted pretty awful, considering they served it to me at room temperature instead of chilled. Which was quite disappointing since we paid $15 for the unlimited drink upgrade, and I expected more out of it. The Sizzling Corned Beef Hash was overcooked, and the Bahn Xeo was ultra greasy - yuck. Their Garlic Fried Rice tastes exactly how my mom makes it, though.Overall, I was pretty annoyed with paying $40 for a mediocre meal with small portions, weak drinks, and slow service. I grew up eating delicious authentic Filipino food my entire life, and neither of our main dishes packed much flavor to even compare.

I didn't dare to try the sissig in the first place because it was pork face and I, as self defined, am a ""traditional meat eater"". But it was actually very good. The texture was soft, and different from other parts of a pig I think. I like the pork belly a lot. The skin was very chewy and the sauce tasted really good. The only not very nice experience was the waiter. As we were ordering, he suggested us get one big dish and two small dishes. But we ordered only two small ones as we thought we weren't that hungry - and to be fair, two small dishes looked like a lot of food already. As we told him that if we wanted more after finishing we would order another one, he ""friendly"" responded, ""Ok but I just want to remind you that all dishes are prepared family style, and it takes a lot of work for the kitchen to prepare dishes that way so I don't suggest you order separately if you were to order more."" ...What???...That was weird.",0,1,0,Gloria X.,"Manhattan, NY",206,33,3

5.0,11/5/2013,"Awesome food, but what made me write in was the awesome service.  I'm out to dinner with 4 friends, and 3 of us were cool with family style, but two of us had eating restrictions, so ordered their own thing.  Plates and plates heaping with delicious food come out, and we are chowing down.  After awhile, I notice one of my friends who ordered solo hasn't gotten her dish yet, but they are starting to clean out the kitchen for the night.  I point out the issue to the waiter, and he takes care of it, no problem.Should we have been on top of order more quickly (if only to get some food in our hungry friend)?  Could they have pointed out the order wasn't on the original ticket, that they had cleaned the kitchen for the night, that they couldn't make the dish, that they wanted us to pay and get out so they could go home after a long night?  Yes to all of those things.  But they were polite, got delicious food in my by-then-starving friend, and let us hang around while the closed and cleaned everything else so my friend could finish.Two takeaways - my friend should speak up sooner, and Pig & Khao treats people right.  Much appreciated, will be back.",0,0,0,Joel L.,"Manhattan, NY",6,10,0
5.0,11/4/2013,"Second visit to Pig and Khao and it was just as good as the first. Of course I didn't learn my lesson from last time and ordered way too much food. Next time I will definitely know better. To start we had the shrimp toast which was a special and they were very good. The shrimp pate on top was much firmer than I expected, but that was a good surprise, I preferred it that way. The Chinese Sausage salad was still a nice bright option, but slightly heavy handed on the vinegar. Coconut rice and Pork Belly Adobo were absolutely amazing just like last time. I think I could just have these two dishes next time and be happy. We also tried the mussels this time, which were okay, but I wasn't a fan of the fried bao. By the time we got to the Khao Soi, we were stuffed but still quite a good dish. I suggest not mixing everything up like they recommend and just enjoying the crispy wontons separately. Once they get incorporated into the sauce, it just gets super soggy. To end we had the turon which were just okay. The chocolate sauce was not a sauce at all but way too thick to be of any use. Still it was a great meal with quick service and I will be back for that coconut rice and pork belly adobo for sure!",0,0,0,Cynthia M.,"Manhattan, NY",351,1226,25
4.0,11/3/2013,"Pretty good. Would come again. The food's a bit on the heavy, greasy side, but you can hit the gym afterwards.The sisig is a sizzling plate of pork head, liver, chili, and raw egg. The server told us to mix it all up so as to cook the egg. The plate's not much to look at, as it's essentially chopped meat sizzling on a platter, but it is delicious. I do wish there were more liver to it, though. In fact, I didn't even realize there was supposed to be liver in it. The crispy pork belly with poached egg is a looker, but it was lacking in flavor compared to the sisig. Also, by the time the pork got to us, it was a bit cold. However, the pork skin was satisfyingly crispy, and the egg was poached perfectly.I think the star of the meal was the dessert. We got the halo halo because it sounded so foreign to us, but it's pretty much a taro-ish shaved ice with various condiments, such as flan, ice cream, Rice Crispies(TM), and various other Filipino items I'm not familiar with. There is some kind of tuber in there that I could have done without, but it's easy to eat around them. Overall, absolutely delicious.

3.0,10/29/2013,"I went here for brunch with a good friend of mine.  Thought it would be a nice change from the typical eggs-and-bacon type of place.  We both started off with the Vietnamese style coffee, which was good, but at $3 for a shot's work of coffee, not a good value at all.  I had two sips and was done.  For our entrees, we both got the khao soi and an order of garlic rice each - food was really delicious.  Nice, hot curry, great egg noodles, and the rice was so full of flavor!The reason I give this place 3 stars is not really the food, because that part is actually quite good.  The first reason is that I walked into the restaurant and it was almost 100% empty.  I went to the host and told him I had a reservation, and he told me I could not be seated until my friend arrived.  It was sort of odd, given the place was empty.  At least let me sit and order a coffee?  The second thing is the worst part - the MUSIC.  Oh my gosh.  I could barely hear my friend during our entire meal.  Loud, obnoxious, clubby music blasting from the open kitchen.  And the fact that the restaurant was empty the whole time made it even more annoying - it's like the staff was having a blast, to the dismay of their only patrons.  I get that they want to create a cool atmosphere, but people go out to eat together to talk, and this made it impossible.  I would probably not come back here for this reason alone.",0,0,0,Anna B.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,44,4
3.0,10/28/2013,"I had to check this place out to give homage to my roots and with all the hype I hear about it, I just had to make the reservations. I personally think that fililpino cuisine should not be ""fusioned"" or ""fancified"" because it loses its draw and essence. It's meant to be homey and at times gritty and odd. But thanks to GQ, Filipino fusion cuisine is apparently the new thang!the place was average. on the smaller side. they did have back patio seating where we ended up with our table. they had hip hop and rap blaring on their sound system as expected from any Asian restaurant. we had the dollar pbr to drink which was a really good steal, and I was really excited that they serve san Miguel beer! for food we had the khao soi. it was really spicy but really savory. the noodles were mediocre, pretty good sized serving. we had the cod cooked in banana leaves and coconut milk. I was surprised at how small the portion was! the fish was the size of my middle finger. anyway, it was tasty. lots of flavor and we ate it with the coconut rice. their coconut rice is the sweeter kind. it was really good. nice and fluffy. we also ordered the steak. it was sliced sirloin and it came with a chili sweet sauce. it was really good. steak was cooked well and the sauce was pretty delicious. overall a good tasting meal. a little on the pricier side and I was disappointed that the menu did not have that many Filipino dishes and it was mixed with some Vietnamese ones. worth checking out and a cute, trendy place to dine in les.

5.0,10/18/2013,"I've been dying to try Pig and Khao and it was worth the wait! We went for dinner tonight and found it on an unassuming street on the lower east side. The inside of the restaurant was also very unassuming -- much smaller than I was expecting with a sweet outdoor seating area in back strung with multicolored christmas lights. Our server was very friendly and as a Top Chef fan I was excited to see Leah Cohen working the bar!To start the drinks were seriously delicious - we tried one which was a take on a negroni made with gin, campari, vermouth, cardamom syrup and grapefruit juice. I do not usually like the taste of gin but thought this was incredible. We also tried their take on a dark and stormy, which used sherry and ginger...also excellent.The food was delicious as well. The server suggested two small plates, one large plate and one side of rice for two people. We found this to be too much food but it was so tasty we took it home as leftovers. We started with the sizzling sisig and the khao soi (recently reviewed in Time Out). Both were flavorful and lovely. I was surprised, though, that there was no warning on the menu that the khao soi was SPICY. I love spice but this was a little bit too much. For someone who doesn't like spicy food at all this dish would have been a disastrous choice. We had the coconut rice as a side which helped soothe our burning mouths a bit. The highlight of the meal was the large plate of BBQ baby back ribs - I would go back just to eat plates and plates of these ribs. Big fan of Pig and Khao.",3,0,1,Sol C.,"Cambridge, MA",176,625,950
4.0,10/16/2013,"For a joint birthday dinner, our group of 10 people ended up at Pig & Khao for some Asian Fusion/Filipino food. I've had Filipino food before - the legit kind that you only find in the middle of Queens - so my standards are set pretty high. About half of us arrived right on time for our 6pm reservation while the other half was a bit later. They offer Happy Hour drinks until 7pm so we opted to get something to drink while waiting. All cocktails are $8 while glasses of Prosecco and Riesling are $5. They're pretty generous with their wine pours so I think it's their best bet.I had the Banana Leaf Cod ($14.00) with a big bowl of Coconut Rice ($3.00). The cod was cooked perfectly but it was definitely a bit on the spicy side. Three of my friends got the Sizzling Sisig ($14.00), which is pork head cooked with chili and whole egg on a hot plate. I've had Sisig before and Pig & Khao's version was pretty good. It wasn't as spicy as your traditional sisig, which was nice.They do allow cakes but there is a fee - I wasn't sure if it was a $6 fee per cake or per slice.

I got a very small coffee for $3.Even though they do bottomless mimosas and draft beer for $15, we decided not to be a hot mess that day. My sister and I ordered sizzling sisig (pig head) and garlic fried rice. We also ordered powdered donuts  ($8) with custard which came green but delicious. Prices look affordable online but then when none of the dishes come with rice (EVERY FILIPINO DISH NEEDS RICE), it fools you.  Our friends also ordered the sizzling sisig and champorado (chocolate rice pudding).

4.0,10/4/2013,"In spite of the ongoing lawsuit between Leah Cohen and Rick Camac's New York Restaurant Services Group, I knew I had to come here to satisfy my currently insatiable Filipino food cravings. (But P&K is technically Asian fusion cuisine.) We made a reservation for two on a warm summer evening interrupted by bouts of torrential downpours.The food undoubtedly left an impression on us. We started with the Sizzling Sisig, of course. Once the raw egg is mixed and the limes squeezed, you are ready for the flavor and texture explosion. Think bite-sized pork fat (head), except diced into small cubic squares. Each spoonful is a surprise; it can be crispy or chewy, it might go down easily, it could be that gelatinous fat you always peel off the meat (I still do that), it might snap, crackle, and pop (literally) in your mouth -- but stop thinking and just swallow. You will discover that the chili, lemongrass, and lime cut right into the salty and smoky/burnt flavors of the pork.The Khao Soi was my personal favorite. It's essentially a ninja Thai red curry where the coconut milk washes over before the heat (mild spiciness) attacks. Underneath an ostentatious arrangement of crispy fried noodles, the egg noodles sit quietly (I was truly surprised by it) in the curry. Once thoroughly mixed, each bite will be that strangely exciting mixture of chewy and crispy, yet again. Be wary that the crispy noodles will get soggy if they sit in the curry too long. (Then it's just chewy and mushy.)The Halo Halo was interesting in an I-don't-understand-why-people-like-this way. It just seemed like a hodgepodge of leftover ingredients in the fridge, but we really tried to enjoy it! He and I both liked the leche flan and the pinipig (glutinous rice), but we picked out the plantains (that wasn't on the menu!). The ube (taro) ice cream was delicious of course.Lastly, the service was pretty good. The hostess apologized that we had to wait past our reservation time and even offered us drinks on the house (we sadly did not take up her offer). Our server was very attentive and continually checked in on us. My only gripe was that when two vagrants wandered in at the end of the night, NONE of the staff did anything. They literally stood and pointed at the two (drunk?) men yelling nonsensical words across the table. After 10 minutes or so, they left on their own. All the diners, us included, were bewildered at what happened.Since Cohen is trying to cut ties with the restaurant, the future direction of the restaurant is certainly questionable. Do come and try P&K soon, before it's too late!Notes:- Khao is Thai for rice. Not a homophonous play on the word ""cow,"" like I originally thought haha.- Definitely order rice with your dishes.

My wife's salad was fantastic... and I know this because it came out 20 minutes before my food was served.  It gave me time to sip and savor my tiny $3 vietnamese coffee which did not come with refills (and they offer no other coffee option) because how can they expect to make money if they just kept giving me coffee for free while I waited 30 minutes for food in an empty restaurant?My dish arrived with 2 plastic plates marred by scratch marks and stains.  Apparently our dishes were meant to be shared despite the first one not having any plates accompanying it.  It also was very delicious.  It was so good that the waitstaff wanted it for themselves because I repeatedly had to tell them I wasn't finished yet as they attempted to take it away and clear our table.Our check was simply placed on our table and then we were ignored until we paid and left.  The outdoor tables remained empty.I may eat here again, but it would most certainly have to be carry-out.",1,0,0,Matt B.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",0,11,0

4.0,8/28/2013,"Every year I visit NYC I have to try at least one new restaurant. I've just fallen in love with so many of the spots I've dined in before that I can't NOT go to them so my stays either need to get longer, or I need to just stick to the tried and true. But who does that? People that aren't adventurous I guess. Pig and Khao was a new spot I just HAD to try especially since they're part of the Fatty Crew (Fatty Crab Restaurant - my all time favorite). I thought the food was pretty good. I can't say spectacular because I'm all about traditional Filipino food. It seems Pig and Khao is slowly introducing Filipino cuisine in a more fusion-ish kind of way that doesn't totally bombard foreign taste buds with the powerful flavors most Filipino dishes have. It's not to say that their food isn't great. I thought it was tasty and very well presented. The service was decent (they forgot one of our drinks). I can't give a spot 5 stars if they forget an order (especially when they write it down).

I just wanna tell you guys that I'm totally in love with Grilled sirlion, because the spicy sauce it came with was really awesome! It made me think of my favorite spot in my hometown (Thailand). Moreover, they cooked their beef medium rare so it wasn't too dry and pretty soft! By the way, my boyfriend looked like he really enjoyed his food.

3.0,8/16/2013,"After hearing so much praise for Pig & Khao in all the food review sites / blogs, I think I came in with overmanaged expectations. There seems to be an insurgence of popularity of Southeast Asian cuisine lately between Mission Chinese, Maharlika, Uncle Boon's etc. Pig & Khao is buried on a desolate street in the LES. It's actually quite noisy in the restaurant because they blast 90s hip hop / rap, but the outdoor garden in the back is a nice place for a meal. We ordered the Sizzling Sisig, Khao Soi, and Grilled Pork Jowl salad. The Sizzling Sisig is quite good: pork, runny egg, lime and all these spices served up on a sizzling fajita plate. It's delicious at first fork but gets to be a little too heavy and greasy after a couple of bites.The Grilled Pork Jowl was the weakest dish. It kind of looked like pork rinds served up with cut up watermelon. The Khao Soi is a red curry that also has egg noodles in it. It came in a deep bowl buried under mounds of fried noodle strips. Even to a spice wimp like myself, it wasn't too hot and was completely manageable, especially when paired with the.......COCONUT RICE! Since when does a side as boring as rice become the star of the show?! I could've eaten an entire bowl of this rice, plain. It was coconutty-licious. For dessert I destroyed the Halo-halo. It's a teeming bowl overloaded with shaved ice, coconut, ice cream, pieces of rich flan... I deluded myself into thinking that it was ""healthy"" because it was mostly shaved ice, conveniently omitting the part where it's also laden with a million decadent toppings. This dessert pushed my stomach into the over-ate, uncomfortable arena, but I was quite content there.",2,1,1,Alice L.,"Manhattan, NY",89,173,0

5.0,8/10/2013,"Pig & Khao (nice pun) finds hitherto hidden connections between Filipino and Thai cuisine, turning them into an exquisite combination that in earlier times might be considered Pan-Asian fusion. Not that there's anything so crass going on here. The khao soi, a soup noodle dish native to Southern Thailand, is a fire-hot take on the dish, with the coconut milk not hiding a hint of the chili heat in the broth. Meanwhile pork adobo, a spin on the Philippines national dish rests in a bowl with a full poached egg and Sichuan peppercorns lightly numbing the fatty meat on the tongue. The cod is a bit too salty, something that probably resulted in the recent switch in fish from salmon, which absorbs the flavor better. It was rainy on the night I came here, so we couldn't take in the impressively large outdoor space. But I wonder if such lovingly prepared fare should have to compete with flies and the hissing of summer lawns. This is food to be savored, arriving at does in irregular but still prompt intervals from the tiny kitchen/bar.The menu divisions here seem designed to confuse, or at least contribute to over ordering. There's nothing ""small"" about the khao soi or curry fried chicken - these are just main dishes that would be served with rice. Figure on ordering just one of these a person, perhaps with an extra one for the table to share. This should keep the cost at around $50 a head with a couple drinks, as opposed to our feast at $70 each.The drink selection is impressively varied, with an all bottle selection that moves from the hipster trash (Pork Slap and Genny) to regional crafts (Itacha Flower) and pricy Asian imports (Hitachiano). Slurping beers out of a bowl ""Hong Kong style"" may be inaccurate and stupid, but at least you sip nice beers while doing it.",1,0,0,Jon S.,"Brooklyn, NY",128,647,1

It goes perfectly with the coconut rice. Eveyrone raved about the sizzling sisig, but I would say this was my least favorite dish. I enjoyed everything else so much more. For the main, I reallly loved the whole fried fish. It sits in a deicious broth with onions, basil and oyster mushrooms. The reason for minus 1 star is that we sat pretty close to the kitchen and there were two spurts of oily/pungent/eye burning spice attacks from the kitchen.

This place wax poetics to the pig and does a solid job at it though mind you, this isn't crispy lean pork loin style; this is the fatty belly, jowl, head parts that are seasoned and cooked perfectly, but the fat can't be escaped.Tapas style resulted in my party of 6 ordering literally the whole menu minus a few. The curry noodles were a hit along with that creamy coconut cod wrapped in banana leaf. Order that coconut rice, you know want it. All the pork dishes were a solid with most of them tasting very similar and that's why this may be the most general review in the world. The sisig was delicious, a must order and I'd pass on the pork with watermelon dish. The crispy pata which is under the larger plates was solid, but honestly, by the time it came, I was pigged out. The halo-halo ended up being a delicious cold, creamy concoction of fruity pebbles and I loved every bite. Eating with 90s hip hop as the ambiance? Priceless.I was thinking about giving this place 3 stars since I wasn't that into the food; all that fatty pork left me with a) that was just too much pork I wish there was a tad bit more to my meal and b) what the heck did I just eat, everything tasted very similar.

I can't handle spicy foods and this certainly wasn't spicy.The Chicharron are light and not greasy. The coconut vinegar didn't do much for the chicharron, IMO.

And even worse, just as stale. This was a huge embarrassment to say the least.Our entrees were the sisig and the pork adobo. Aside from being 90% made of PURE fat, the portions were tiny (Will someone tell these people this isn't Dufresne's WD-50!) and incredibly overpriced.

It was definitely enough to fill and satisfy both of us. Although the portion sizes were not the norm of regular American establishments, let's be honest, that's why we're all fat so maybe it's a good thing the portion sizes were ""smaller"" or normal outside of the US haha.Crispy Red Curry Rice Salad - I loved the flavors of the dish. The saltiness and spiciness of the red curry brittle/pieces combined with the sour/tart of the lime tied together with the taste of the coriander. It was definitely an unexpected first bite and I loved how the flavors developed and complimented each other. My only complaint about this dish would be that there was a bit too much of the red curry bits which at certain times overwhelmed and detracted from the other flavors of the dish.Mussels - I'm indifferent when it comes to seafood so my opinion might be biased. I thought it was a decent dish but nothing out of the ordinary that you can't find at any other restaurant that serves mussels cooked in a broth. The fried mantao was a nice touch.Sizzling Sigsig - This dish was my favorite. It tasted so good and wasn't as spicy as I thought it'd be. I was expecting to see some pig head on a platter that we pick off of but it was already ""deboned"" for us so all the hard work was done. Added some lime to it and it was good to go.

5.0,6/11/2013,"Let me start this off by saying that I am a HUGE top chef fan and was super excited that Leah Cohen has a restaurant in NYC! I love the Filipino fusion food offered at this restaurant, but what I love even more is how the almighty pig is showcased. Here's what we ordered: chicharron, chickpeas, pork jowl, sizzling sisig, Khao soi, and coconut rice. The pork jowl with watermelon was just amazing. The sisig was crispy delicious pieces from the various parts of a pig head served with a very runny but luxurious egg. When mixed together, the egg and pork fat coated the pork pieces like a perfectly crafted sauce. Although it wasn't a pork dish, the red curry sauce in the Khao soi was good enough to drink. If my husband were writing this review, he would go on and on about the coconut rice. It was the perfect compliment to all of the dishes. I am very much planning to revisit and will order the bottomless self serve beer next time!

4.0,6/10/2013,"Had a good experience at Pig and Khao for dinner. The weather was beautiful so we sat outside (in the back). The atmosphere is lovely, especially in the outdoor seating area. The food is definitely on the more creative side, and very heavy on the pork. That said, we really enjoyed everything we ate and there is definitely something on the menu even for picky eaters (one of whom I was dining with...). Ordered the mussels, the sirloin and the Khao Soi. Everything was really delicious and the portion size was excellent. Thought the prices were fairly reasonable for the quality of the food. Dessert was probably the most disappointing part of the meal. Ordered the Turon (fried bananas with caramel ice cream and chocolate sauce). The ice cream was very good, fried bananas pretty flavorless and the chocolate seemed very out of place and tasted far too salty. Definitely will return since it's in the neighborhood!

My other favorite was the delicious tiny dish of penuts- honestly the best thing of the night.  This place has a nice downtown trendy vibe but was very loud-  there are much better in the City if you want something trendy or hike out to Queens to get much better tasty Asian food for far less $!",0,0,0,Alice E.,"Brooklyn, NY",481,788,1

I can't believe people actually gave 5 stars? That is meant for restaurants with PERFECT everything.  Not sure if it's because I came on a Tuesday and the head chef wasn't there. Just a bunch of Mexicans cooking supposedly authentic filipino food.FOOD: Pork rinds had too much pepper. I choked a bit from it. The pork adobo was decent. Had the curry salad. Nothing special.  Didnt like how the burnt pieces stick to your teeth. The sizzling sisig (pig head) was what I was excited about. Very fatty, and tasted like the pork rinds,  curry salad, & pork adobo. Granted they are all pork, but the chef can't come up with different flavors and spices for the different dishes??? I thought that was ridiculous. Finally we had the halohalo dessert. Very bland, mostly just eating ice with no flavor. Oh yea and the coconut rice everyone is talking about.  It's just OK. The fried fish came with soup. Thought the soup tasted weird. The fish was decent. 3 people eating.  We paid for the birthday girl. Came out to $60 pp. And yea, no drinks were ordered.I gave 2 stars because service was good. Even though they sat us in the back where there is a huge AC meant for the cooks to stay cool.

5.0,6/3/2013,"I read a lot about Pig & Khao on all of the food blogs, so I was looking forward to trying it for quite a while. I'm a huge fan of the Top Chef series, so I was curious to taste Leah Cohen's food. It did not disappoint!The restaurant is very small and intimate, with Asian-inspired modern decor.  It's an open kitchen, and guests sitting at the bar counter in front of the kitchen can watch the chefs in action. I was wowed at the speed and efficiency of what was going on behind the stove.  It was a show in itself, and if you go at the right time, you'll get to sit at the bar while Leah is cooking.  It made me appreciate the food I was eating even more.Anyway, on to the food.  I came here for a late dinner, and after a 30-45 minute wait we tried the grilled pork jowl, grilled sirloin (had a very spicy dipping sauce), and Sizzling Sisig. Everything was good, but did not compare to the Sizzling Sisig, which stole the show away.  Served on a sizzling caste iron plate that cooks the egg as it's brought out to you, this dish was AMAZING.  You break the egg yolk and it mixes with the pork meat, and it's a party in your mouth.  I still dream about this dish, and it's reason enough for me to return.  I also got the Phucket Punch cocktail, which was excellently made.I was so obsessed with my meal at Pig & Khao that I came back the very next morning for brunch.  This time we were seated at the bar and were lucky enough to come while Leah was working the kitchen.  I ended up getting the bottomless mimosas, which certainly did the job for me.  There are 4 different flavors, and after trying 3 of them, I decided my favorite was the lychee.  We got the steak and eggs (which is the same as the grilled sirloin from dinner) and as tempted as I was to get the Sizzling Sisig again, I wanted to try something new.  I ordered the Bahn Xeo, which was delicious.  It's a crispy fried crepe filled with shrimp, bacon, and greens.  Kind of like a crispy taco, but bigger and messier (and yummier, in my opinion).  I have to say, it was a bit more expensive than my usual brunch, but a very nice treat that left me extremely satisfied.Pig & Khao has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in NYC, and I also love that Leah Cohen seems really cool and down to earth.  She gets extra points in my book for actually working in her own restaurant instead of just putting her name on it for publicity and walking away, like so many up-and-coming chefs do.  I'm around the Clinton/Rivington area a lot, and I've seen her hanging around the restaurant quite a bit.  I just hope that she always stays as involved as she seems to be now, because I'll always be excited to return and hope that I'll catch her in the kitchen again.",1,0,0,Lara N.,"Woodside, NY",82,64,17

Pig & Khao takes your number down so that they can text you when your table's ready which is convenient.approximately 1.5 hours later, we got the text from the restaurant and headed over. cute setting, very small neighborhood restaurant with a nice backyard outdoor seating area. low lighting gives it the potential for a reasonable date setting or just cool hipsters talking about fusion foods. overall i found the food very good. i liked everything we ordered and was satisfied with the flavors and presentation. that being said, the prices are a little steep for the amount of food you receive.  being asian, i find it a little ridiculous the prices vs. portions being served in comparison to the more authentic (albeit less trendy) filipino restaurants in the outer boroughs. we started with an order of the Grilled Pork Jowl. the watermelon was sweet and refreshing which contrasted with the salty-tangy fish sauce. the crispy chicharron also added a great texture to the dish. we also ordered the Quail Adobo. this dish i could've done without. the quail was crispy and the flavor was good, but nothing stood out. and, as is the case with quail, the pieces were tiny.our final small plate was the Sizzling Sisig. this dish looks pretty impressive when it arrives at your table. and it is pretty good. but is it blow me away good? not particularly.  however, portion-wise, it's probably the best bang for your buck.since we were eating family-style, we also ordered one large plate to share: Whole Fried Fish. this was probably my favorite dish of the night. and while i agree that the price is a little more than what i would pay at a chinese restaurant for a much larger steamed whole fish, the flavors in the broth were so poignant that i forgave the smaller portion. i highly recommend ordering this dish if you like the sweet and sour flavor that is often associated with southeast asian foods. additionally, you must make sure to order a bowl of their Coconut Rice.  it is delicious. eaten on its own you can really taste the sweetness that coconut milk adds to the rice. when paired with the other dishes, which all tend to lean towards the sour/salty flavor spectrum, it is a perfect complement.i would come back to Pig & Khao. the food was good and the atmosphere was friendly (as opposed to frenetic-which can happen at a lot of hyped-up small trendy restaurants). yes, it's a little pricier than what i would usually pay for similar food. but when it's good, it's good. and to be smack-dab in the center of the LES isn't a bad place to be after a great meal or, in reverse order, after a bunch of drinks and on the hunt for food.",0,0,0,Tina M.,"Queens, NY",162,97,1052

5.0,5/15/2013,"This little piggy ate a pig.  A sisig pig.  I brought my LA friend here without knowing she doesn't eat much pig.  And then I force fed her some pig head.  For any people with friends who are unwilling to try new types of foods, exotic and foreign to them, just don't tell them what they're eating.  They won't be able to tell what it is when it arrives anyway.  Just scoop some onto their plate and let their minds be blown.  Don't do this if they follow any religions which restrict their diets.  They will be really angry with you.  And might 'Pork Slap' you.In fact, try the tasting menu- it's about $35/pp and you get 5 or 6 dishes served.  You won't know in advance what you'll get, but you can request a couple of must-haves to be included and they will cater to you.  What's good is that you will also be getting items not served on the regular menu.No risk, no reward.  But we did get two dishes that I wasn't particularly fond of; one was the halo-halo(one ingredient had a meaty taste and texture) and the other was the mango/papaya salad(bit too tart) that came with chicken.As for the coconut rice everyone raved about, it was THAT good and then some.  We added another order of it even though the seams on our pants were ripping.  It can be eaten as is, and since most of the items at P&K were fried, it helped to balance out our palettes.",3,5,3,Jenn F.,"Brooklyn, NY",767,372,2548

3.0,4/26/2013,"I was searching for Flip food and places where they sell halo halo. Pig and Khao came up with their cute curly tailed signage and what a winning name. I figured since it was in my old hood I could have dinner with the family there. I got myself a rezzo on their online reservation system. Got ready with a coupon in my pocket to check out this place.I was prompt because I wanted to hold our reservation for such a large party and at first glance it is kind of a small place. The bar was actually in the front window area. There is a bench by the door for people waiting. I didn't realize they also have seating in the back garden area. The music was pumping on a Thursday night, not earsplitting level but definitely needed to be turned down a notch as the noise became cumbersome. We needed to play telephone all night shouting and passing along the conversation from 1 person to the next because we couldn't hear each other. I guess you can escape the loud music if you sit in the back garden. We were seated by the guy at the host table in the front who also turned out to be our waiter. He had a nice smile and reminds me of the werewolf guy Alcide from True Blood if he were to wear trucker hats. He seated us right away and was attentive the whole night checking on us.Since we had a big party we got to try a bunch of dishes. I had the sweet & sour cilantro soda which tasted like the vegan man's version of a virgin mojito. The cute Hitachino Nest beer is..warning...priced high but served in ceramic bowls. Cheaper options are the $1 happy hour PBRs or the all you can drink HH or Genesee Cream Ale or get sangria. If you get the coconut drink its served street style- they cut the top off a coconut and put a straw in it. We started off with the chicharrones  because when you think of pig you think of chicharrones which were served in a small bowl with some white wine vinegar for dipping. Crispy and crunchy enough like those pork rinds that come in a bag from the bodega but small portion. Since it was dinner time they said they didn't have the garlic rice which I don't understand. I was looking forward to it because I like garlic so much that I can never be a vampire. Couldn't figure out why they couldn't make it. We had the jasmine rice and the coconut rice instead and they give you a pretty big bowl of rice. 1 bowl is enough to share for 2 people. The ""small plates"" we had were the sizzling sisig pork head with the raw egg cracked over the top. You are supposed to mix it and squeeze the lime over it. It had a nice smoky flavor and very chewy. If you don't like trying adventurous stuff and only eat the safe parts of the pig don't get this because it can be chewy in a weird way but I enjoyed the flavor. Not sure if it would fill me up if this was the only thing I ordered. I would suggest getting additional items or fill up on the rice. One of our party has a dietary restriction and just ordered one of the salads which turned out to be some grated veggies with some chicken over the top it was kind of like a half portion and it had a cloudy sauce that I thought was lemon juice but she said it was mango and she didn't really end up finishing it. The khao soi was the best dish in this category. It is a pretty good size bowl of noodles served in a big chinese soup bowl you get from the supermarket. It came with a curry sauce that had good thickness and I really like the crispy noodles (they are the type they serve with your egg drop soup from the takeout restaurants) scattered atop the egg noodles that hold the curry sauce quite nicely. The entree dishes we got were my favorite which may explain the huge price point difference of at least an additional $10 for the same size dish. We got the crispy pata which is the pork leg that is fried and really tasty and came with a soy sauce and a liver dipping sauce. I ran out of rice by this time since they brought out the dishes one at a time but it was still good and I was fighting the others for pieces of the crisped skin and pork. I dipped first in the soy and then in the liver sauce. We also got the bbq ribs they were not mind blowing but I enjoyed how the meat on the rib was very tender and it had a dark smoky kind of flavor. I would count it as a half rack. For dessert we had the halo halo of course and the fried banana fritters.The halo halo was also served in the chinese soup bowl filled with shaved ice mixed with condensed milk, one scoop of purple yam ice cream and a ton of slivered almonds and maybe some small pieces of flan but I couldn't tell because there were so many almonds and also small julliened strings of jellied coconut that you have to dive for in the shaved ice milk puddle.  Not as many items as a traditional halo halo though I did like it you could possibly split this with 4 people if you like sharing. Banana fritters were ehh tho it had caramel ice cream. I wouldn't consider this ""authentic"" food and kinda pricey but I may return if I had another coupon.",2,1,1,Elaine L.,"Queens, NY",283,319,5263
5.0,4/26/2013,"I have been here twice and absolutely LOOVE it! Filipino cuisine and culture (aside from balut) ,rarely gets  front stage recognition compared to other asian food, especially in manhattan. Primarily, Filipino restaurants are small mom and pops restaurants owned and managed by filipino immigrants typically, and the customer base are 99% filipino in a filipino community such as Queens. Pig and Khao on the other hand,  takes pride in filipino food  and culture and brings it to a whole new level so that it appeals to various palettes (traditional filipino, yet cool and contemporary) . The ambiance is hip, jovial without trying too hard. Eating in the garden reminds me of being at someone's filipino house (minus the pig spit ;)  (although I wish they played music in the garden area too) and casually eating and laughing the night away!! I LOOVE any of the pork dishes, coconut rice and chicharron and vinegar sauce! As a Filipina myself, the food , the garden in the back, the aroma of rice and filipino seasonings make me an official regular!  it is wonderful to see filipino culture exposed to rest of the world .The only negative: our server- brunette, long hair. She served us both times we were there and unfortunately doesn't have the hospitality and generosity that one naturally gets where delicious filipino food is served. She didnt come to check on us enough, forgot the wine specials, and when I said, we may order some more dishes later, she replied ""the chef prefers you order everything all at once."" boo. she sucked.The food is so good though, I am going back.p.s. there is a cute  little black cat that roams around in the patio from time to time, which I love.

4.0,4/26/2013,"My reaction to the first bite was ""THIS IS NONSENSE!"" The presentation and equisite blend of flavors were nothing short of ridiculous to me. I was not prepared. I was there for a business dinner and I honestly felt like the food was so POW that it was so distracting. The scents of all the dishes--even at nearby tables--stopped conversation a few times.They had a 5-course tasting menu, but I wasn't prepared for that so had a chicken dish in a coconut broth that was ah-mazing. It was then even more thrilling with a sweet coconut rice--that felt like I had dessert with dinner!  Seeing others get the tasting menu, seeing their reactions, I probably missed out big time. They also had an ""all you can drink"" beer special--wasn't prepared for that, either.  Despite the fact that I don't eat pork and virtually everything on the menu is pork, I would go back again. Pretty outstanding. Lost a star for two reasons that some people may not care about: 1) I don't eat pork so I felt limited-as if there were only a couple options for me. My impression -- based on what I saw on the menu only. I'm sure others can work around it. 2) We sat outside and there was a cat climbing around on the walls and this was distracting. It was not at our feet begging for food, but it was a very animated animal and it was obvious that it was not new to the backyard. Let me be very clear -- this was not a stray cat and not harassing in any way. I would still go back and sit in the outdoor patio area--and I'm not fond of animals.",0,0,0,K. S.,"Bear, DE",48,70,0
4.0,4/26/2013,"Pig and Khao, such an interesting place! Smells delicious, good music, open (tiny) kitchen, tight seating arrangements so get ready to cuddle with your neighbors, and a back patio that will be amazing when it finally gets warm in NYC. Things started off really well but by the end of the night they barely held on to this 4 star review and i would say it's a low 4. Here's the rundown. What we ate (in order of our favorite to least favorite): grilled pork jowl with watermelon - a little spicy, refreshing, tender pork, deliciouschinese sausage salad - also spicy, refreshing, deliciouscoconut rice - yum!! sweet and a perfect pairing to all the spicy things we hadkhao soi - a better version than what we hand in Chang Rai northern thailand. also a large portion and very filling with all the noodles. the chicken in this was a little dubious. i avoided.sauteed bok choy - the veggie of the day, my bf insisted on it. had nice flavor but i could have done without. sizzingling sisig - gets rave reviews (from yelp and my friends who visited before) but we flat out did not like. we found the dish very fatty and greasy with the majority of the meat pieces full of gristle or all fat. the flavor was very unappealing to me. we barely touched this and when our server came to take it away she didnt bother to ask why.now on to the service. while we enjoyed most of the food the service is where they almost lost another star. they were completely unorganized. hard to track down. took far too long to take our order and then far too long between each of the dishes above. we were averaging a 10 minute wait in between each which was pretty awkward. didnt ask how we liked anything. we had to ask for another round of beer. just overall not very good with the exception of the guy who kept our water glasses full the whole night so props to him. overall good experience and cranking out some good food. they just need to up their service standard and meal pacing and they'll be a legit spot in my book.",0,0,1,Christina H.,"Manhattan, NY",54,533,110

3.0,4/25/2013,"My husband and I went here for dinner on a weeknight. We didn't have a reservation so we ended up sitting on the chef's bar area. We watched the chef's make all the dishes for the restaurant so it was pretty entertaining. The chef and staff were very clean. For appetizer we orders pork rinds and sisig, for entrée we had BBQ ribs and crispy pata with a side of coconut rice. The pork rinds came out right away which they should have since they tasted like they came out of a bag I could have purchased at a bodega lol. The ribs came out next - they were ok and had an overwhelming taste of fish sauce. Next came the crispy pata which was very tasty. I've had crispy pata all my life and this was one of the best ones I've ever had. It came with papaya coleslaw which is traditionally served with this dish. The sisig came out last. The waitress forgot but it's ok since she was nice. The sisig was a bit overdone and it didn't have the bite a traditional sisig should have (I was looking for a crunchy/chewing texture). We were too stuffed to have dessert there so I asked for halo-halo to go. Since we were sitting at the chef's table we heard the chef yell at the waitress about not encouraging to-go orders since they don't have plastic utensils.

5.0,4/23/2013,"So, if you read my earlier review, you know I had very high expectations coming into there tonight.  It was one of the most interesting meals I've had in my last year.  Happily, the folks cooking behind the bar did not disappoint.   I started with the fried oysters which were awesome, just the right amount of spice, thai chilis I think.  The second course was a Hue Meatball sandwich, ground beef and pork, scallions, Sirachi sauce, Hoison sauce and a bunch of other tasty morsels.  I would have been happy just ordering these.  The third course was the only one that wasn't awesome, but it was certainly tasty, some kind of egg and fried rice squares...  Fourth course was back to perfection.  Mussels in a fish broth, butter sauce with some kind of sausage bits and these small amazing bread things (think of a dense Beignet without the sugar) - by this time I am beyond stuffed and the tasting menu is not over yet.  Finally came a wonderful steak and the Coconut rice.  This time I was smart though and asked for it to go.  Of course, I had to have a few bites first and the rice was as good as last time.  Looking forward to lunch tomorrow.  Again, HUGE recommendation and remember to sit at the bar and watch them cook, it is really cool.",0,0,0,David Z.,"Colorado Springs, CO",5,67,6
3.0,4/22/2013,"So I've finally tried the food here.  And my 2 stars barely gets upgraded to 3.The seating is somewhat awkward with bright lights right in your face and otherwise dark all over.  It makes the place not feel too cozy, even with the tables that are too small.  The music is all hiphop, mostly old skool 90's era and is too loud to manage a good conversation at your table.  If you order a beer that comes in a can they do not put it into a glass, which was not cool in my book.  The waitstaff is not entirely friendly, and pretty slow considering the traffic that comes through the door.  No wonder it takes forever to get seated.  The cooks on the other hand, are very friendly and will tell you how the dish should be eaten & enjoyed.   The food is pretty decent, but not amazing.  It's decently authentic in flavor, but not in price.  Most of the dishes are broiled & fried, where most of them were too well done and far too greasy.  The overall flavor though, was pretty fantastic.  What we ordered:- Spice Chickpeas:  Pretty boring.  Sort of like wasabi peas but all coriander & cumin, and fried too much to the point of being burnt, brittle and carbon-like.  - Quail Adobo:  I suppose I expected this to be like Chicken Adobo, but it's nothing like that.  It's just a whole quail, deep fried with a vinegar/cilantro/lime sauce.  No veggies, no rice, nothing else.  The quail was good, but a bit awkward to eat bc you had to use your hands like fried chicken and each piece was small (think frog legs small & bony).  The sauce was what made the dish -- it was completely out of this world amazing.  - Sizzling Sisig:  I don't get the hullabaloo about this.  It's fatty pork pieces with an egg on top.  No big deal, nothing to write home about.  Again, it was over-broiled/fried, too oily, with not enough flavor.  - Crispy Red Curry Rice Salad:  Good pick because it's relatively light and is a self-service lettuce-wrap dish.  But there were chunks of the red curry that were too crispy and (again) over-fried.  None of the food came with rice, which I think is ridiculous.  The coconut rice was very good -- it can easily be enjoyed on its own.  But the flavor wasn't strong enough to complement any of the other dishes which were oily and overpowering.  One rice can be shared between two people -- it's a decent sized bowl.  But if you're asian and love rice to down your greasy food, get your own bowl.  I would order the dishes in a tapas-style.  Each small dish is too small as an entree, but two dishes is too much for one person.  3 dishes between 2 people is good and you might have some leftovers for the next day. Conclusion:  Good flavor, but could be better.  Dishes are too fatty, too oily, and over-fried.  Rice costs an extra $3 and honestly should come with the dishes to offset all the unnecessary grease.",0,0,0,yuwi s.,"New York, NY",7,133,2

3.0,4/22/2013,"I would like to preface my review by saying that I think Pig and Khao is really more like a 3.5 star restaurant than one deserving of an average 3 stars.  Why am I not giving it 4 then, you ask.  Well, I just felt like my experience was not entirely consistent and had some low points.  The experience began by making a reservation through OpenTable several days in advance.  Even with 5 days notice, most of the times were completely booked, so I wound up settling for an 1:30.  As the day approached, I had called to see if there was an opening any earlier.  I managed to get Chef Leah Cohen on the line, who was very nice and apologetic for not having an earlier table.  I told her that I had enjoyed her food at Centro Vinoteca and would keep the 1:30, as I was anxious to try out her take on Thai and Filipino cuisine.  Upon our arrival, the place was packed, confirming that we were lucky to even receive the table that we did.  I have to say that the atmosphere created the perfect setting for the cuisine; the space was cozy and intimate with a direct view of the small kitchen that resembled something one might find in a studio apartment.  The aromatic smells of each dish permeated the dining room, so I was grateful for this peek into how everything was assembled.  The brightly painted walls and paper napkins reinforced the playfulness of the dishes, as well as the casual vibe they were striving for.  Our waiter was handsome and had a fresh, trendy style and relaxing air about him, almost as if he had just returned from a peaceful stay in the Hamptons.  We were debating on our libation of choice, but he firmly confirmed our choice of the Phuket Punch by saying it was his favorite on the menu.  I have to say that I was extremely thankful for this declaration, as it led me to one of the best cocktails I have had in a long time.  Look out, this might be a new obsession...The white wine class was filled with prosecco, a grapefruit-cinnamon syrup, a fresh mint leaf, and a shaving of grapefruit zest.  The large straw placed inside the glass took this spritzer from boring to lively by its sheer inclusion.  The cinnamon added a sweet kick to the acidic grapefruit component.  It was a perfectly balanced beverage, just right for a festive brunch.  When it came to the food, though, I sadly had mixed feelings.  The meal started with the highlight - The Sizzling Sissig.  The hot platter contained chunks of random bits of pig's head, including the ears.  The meat was fatty, but full of flavor.  Chili and cilantro were sprinkled on top of the head, and a whole egg had been cracked right in the center of the plate.  We broke the yolk and tossed everything together for a smoky, creamy dish of decadence.  Our side order of rice, topped with burnt garlic shavings, was a perfect accompaniment to the meat.  The Bahn Xeo came to the table next.  This sizzling crepe had sounded like one of the most unusual items on the menu, but turned out to be VERY greasy.  This wrap around pancake itself was not very flavorful.  However, it was stuffed with plump shrimp that were perfectly cooked, crunchy bean sprouts, gooey fish sauce, and supposedly bacon, though I barely detected it.  I would have gladly eaten out the inside like a salad, but the crepe part was unnecessary.  Lastly, the Khao Soi was decent and certainly grew on me as the meal progressed.  This large bowl of creamy red curry sauce contained very few pieces of chicken, pickled mustard greens, shallots, and egg noodles.  While half the noodles had moistened beneath the sauce, the other half were peeking out of the broth and had remained crispy.  After a good mixing, the crunchiness disappeared, and the entire portion of noodles became infused with the flavors of Thailand.  However, there was an undertone of pungent sourness in the broth that I could not place.  Perhaps it was from the pickling of the greens or maybe from excess cumin or lemongrass, but something was off-putting.  We decided to skip dessert, but I gladly had another glass of punch, ha!We left Pig & Khao satisfied and content, agreeing that we wound certainly return.  However, the prices and the grease factor were both a bit too high to make this a regular weekend destination.",1,2,2,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

2.0,4/16/2013,"Thoroughly disappointed! At first, I was excited that the restaurant served Filipino cuisine as well as launched by a chef from Top Chef. Also, after enjoying authentic Filipino cuisine from the Philippines, I was craving a good fix here. However, the general lack luster experience combined with mediocre food did not win me over for its overpriced menu. Even if Pig and Khao's ambiance is suppose to be a casual experience, their staff did not know ANYTHING. We decided to order the 5 course tasting menu for a fix price. For one thing, our waitress, although courteous and nice, did not tend to us as frequently despite the lack of patrons at the place. FYI, we were there for an early dinner around 5-6pm and there was only another couple having dinner. Did I also mention how there were 3-5 staff members just aimlessly waiting around? Not cool. The next thing that disturbed our experience was that when we received each dish, the presenter, who was not our waitress, did not even try to explain what we were getting. (Even if he did try to explain, he was either on mute or he just explained the meat type.) I even asked for better elaboration on one of the dishes and whether if it was Filipino .The presenter did not know whether if it was a Filipino dish or what the dish was at all. HOW IS THIS A TASTING MENU EXPERIENCE IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE TRYING? I'm not even trying to be anal about our experience. I did not even try to make it a big deal during our dinner, but after thinking about our experience, I will not come here again. The second part is that even the dinnerware seemed like cheap $1 items you'd find in Chinatown. I don't have anything against cheap dinnerware, but if I'm paying for an ambiance and an experience at a place, I'd expect better utensils. Next time, I can just eat at Chinatown for authentic food at a lower price. Food was mediocre. It only got 2 stars because our food came out fresh and I liked the coconut rice.",5,0,1,Isabella B.,"New York, NY",326,22,0
3.0,4/13/2013,"I was excited to try this place cuz it combines my 2 fave cuisines: Thai & Filipino.

The atmosphere was energetic, decor was cute and loved the hip hop classics played in the backgroundInitially we ordered as individual entrees but when waiter told us everything was made to share and would come out as ready, we were expecting larger portionsWhat we ate:Can't go wrong with bottomless mimosas for $15 which was the best bang for buck.

It was just a lil too fattyLonganisa & egg - it wasn't any different than how one can make it at home. It did come with a nice cucumber tomato saladGarlic rice side- after finding out the jowl in fact didnt come w/rice, we ordered 2 sides. & the 2 sides of rice were actually too much for the food that we had.

4.0,4/8/2013,"I'm really liking these casual eatery concepts launched by Top Chef alums. Sure, these great chefs all have pedigrees worthy of working in many fine dining establishments - but it's wonderful when Top Chef alums like Leah Cohen instead deliver something much more approachable, but with great execution and inventive flavors. Pig and Khao rides on the same ""Southeast Asian/fusion"" wave that's pretty much sweeping the city at the moment. And with good reason. I have long felt that Southeast Asian cuisine has been long overlooked by the majority of diners, especially real critics who don't tend to place it in the same realm as French or New American. Pig and Khao offers shareable plates with Filipino, Vietnamese and Thai influences - some of which are truly authentic while others offer a more modern twist. Whatever you order, prepare for a full throttle assault of unrelenting flavors.The bf and I came here for brunch recently, hoping to catch the kitchen while they were less busy. The dining room is surprisingly spacious, with an open kitchen and bar seating that faces the hot grills and chefs at work. Leah herself was actually in the kitchen that afternoon, as if she had just casually rolled out of her apartment and decided to come in to cook alongside the other chefs. We ended up sharing three plates: the Chinese sausage salad, Khao soi, and Sizzling sisig with a generous side order of garlic fried rice. The sisig (a Filipino dish of various pig parts) was fatty and comforting in all the right ways, with large bits of pig ears, snout, jowl and fat fried to a crisp on the sizzling cast iron platter. A raw egg came cracked on top, which cooked as we mixed it into the various pork chunks and drizzled with lime juice for some acidic necessity. I found the addition of lemongrass and chili in the sisig to be a little bit of a spin on the traditional sisig I've had in the past, but really enjoyed it because it actually helped to brighten up the absolutely indulgent dish. The garlic rice was tasty as well, still retaining a little bit of chew from the slightly sticky short grain rice. The Chinese sausage salad leaned more towards the Thai side of the spectrum, reminiscent of a Thai larb salad with tomato, cucumber, shallot, toasted rice powder, coriander and lime-fish sauce over bibb lettuce. I grew up eating the pungent and sweet Chinese sausage, but found the use of it in this spicy and tangy dish totally refreshing as it tickled every part of my palate. We ordered strategically, as the salad also served as a good palate cleanser for the sisig. The khao soi, another traditional Thai curry noodle dish, was impressive as well. The slightly spicy and thick red curry broth was tempered by the addition of coconut milk, while the pickled mustard greens, shallots and lemongrass on top added another dimension and some freshness. We also really liked the contrasting textures from the cooked egg noodles and crispy fried egg noodles on top, which kept eating an entire bowl interesting bite after bite. It was a hearty bowl indeed, especially swimming in that luscious and thick curry broth - so I'd highly recommend sharing it with everyone at the table. Sadly, we were too full after those dishes and couldn't afford the halo halo dessert, which I've heard a many great things about. I am definitely looking to make a return trip soon for dinner - certainly with more friends so that we can try more dishes.",5,2,3,Cecilia Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",762,644,43
3.0,4/5/2013,"I really wanted to ADORE Pig and Khao, but somehow I did not.  I really wanted to give it more than 3 stars but at the end of the day, after much contemplation there were too many let downs for me to lie to myself or the world of Yelp.  First of all, there really is something wrong with the management of the tables.  It's like they are a bit confused about who is organizing the seating. We ordered a $1 beer (YAY!) and set to reading the menu.  Of course the sizzling sisig, the pork jowl and watermelon salad, the red curry and finally the lamb ribs.  The sisig and the salad were good, and they actually went well with the coconut rice.  I loved the curry, and did not find it in the least bit too spicy.  It had just the right amount of heat, and the flavors were good.The lamb was a disaster.  It smelled gamey, the ribs were flabby and fatty, and the spices came off on my fingers with a greasy film.  I could barely manage a bite of them and they destroyed my palate and made my stomach churn.  Lama-the drama, the drama! Yes yes, it was dramatic. Also, this place is EXPENSIVE.  Really too much for what you get. Would I come back?

4.0,4/5/2013,"The food club descended on the lower east side on a Thursday night for its inaugural meeting at pig and khao. From the team behind fatty crab and cue, this unassuming restaurant had opened to much fanfare several months prior, but has appeared to cbs live up to its much hyped potential.After arriving a few minutes after our 7pm reservation, our group was promptly seated. The restaurant had a pleasantly energetic vibe, without ever crossing the line into over-crowded. In keeping with the standard for the rest of the night, out waitress was prompt and polite in bringing us menus and water, and enlightening us on the specials of the night.Starting with the libations, our collective curiosity was immediately piqued by the alluring bottomless self serve draft beer option, priced at a reasonable fifteen dollars (miller high life when we were there, but not specified on the menu so presumably subject to change). However, on closer consideration, the group settled on a la carte ordering, given the very reasonably priced beer selection on offer. This included a three dollar genessee cream ale that did not exceed the expectations set by the waitress's description of two notches above PBR). An order of spiced chickpeas accompanied our drinks. While a tasty alternative to standard bar nuts, these were a worthwhile order only in light of their very reasonable price point. The food menu, clearly composed with an eye to sharing, was comprised mainly of a variety of small plates in a tapas style, in addition to a couple of snacky starters and more substantial large parts. Chef Leah Cohen, a former top chef contestant (perhaps most memorable for her on screen romance with fellow contestant Hosea) confided that she had spent the last several years in Asia learning the art of Filipino cooking, which she fused with influences from Thailand and Vietnam. The dishes that adorned the resulting menu were tantalizing to say the least; it was a feat of restraint to quell our initial instinct to order everything on the menu. Our eventual order included:-Chinese sausage salad-""sisig"" pig head-mussels-pork jowl-khao sui-sirloin steak-quail adobo (fittingly served with quail egg)The food was generally of a high quality, featuring varied and complex flavors that truly lived up to its fusion billing. The standout choice for the collective group favorite was the pig head which hit the mark on counts of both texture and taste. I also personally very much enjoyed the sausage salad, which was reminiscent of a thai som tum, albeit with the dried shrimp substituted for sausage. Less exciting to me were the mussels and the steak - heard to mess up, but not the most exciting versions of those proteins that I have sampled.In keeping with the themes of abundance and indulgence, the group opted to sample both desserts on offer. This included fried bananas with salted caramel ice cream, as well as a mélange of Taro ice cream, shaved rice and flan. I found the ice cream to be the highlight of both options; each held its own, but neither were exceptional.After lightening our wallets a reasonable amount (perhaps we over-indulged but I would rate this restaurant more $$$ than $$), we left happy and sated, and with no dearth of apres dinner destination choices surrounding the restaurant's convenient Lower East Side location. Not surprisingly, the food club's next two stops were at other food establishments in the area..",0,0,0,Ashwin T.,"New York, NY",166,217,108

5.0,4/1/2013,"A relative new comer to the LES, we were itching to try out Pig and Khao with all of the great reviews it's been getting. On our walk over from the 6 train we had high hopes for this meal and we weren't let down.  Once we all arrived and sat at our table with a view of the open kitchen we were informed that there was a tasting menu available for the whole table. Both pairs of our double date went for that option without hesitation. An amuse bouche of tasty/salty sauce and a quail egg, and some beers for the guys and cocktails for the ladies (which could've been a bit boozier) was a good start.  The rest of the meal was a mix of salty and spicy that delighted the senses. Fried oysters, more quail egg, and some parts of the pig we wouldn't have normally touched with some one else's fork turned out to be absolutely fantastic.  While everything was delicious, the two highlights of the night were the sizzling sisig - an upscale version of corned beef hash, and the lamb ribs - tender bits of lamp perfectly spiced and fall-off-the-bone-delicious.  All in, the food and service were top notch, though the decor and bar left a little something to be desired. It is certainly on the list for off the beaten path spicy eats.  While Pig & Khao seems like a strange mix of different elements - almost take-out like decor, a self-service keg in the back garden, yet top notch food that you'd expect from an upscale restaurant, it all somehow works. @datenitenyc",0,0,0,Kate K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,144,1

5.0,4/1/2013,"Lack of planning is awesome! Our failures in researching the restaurant we'd been intent on led us to a closed door. We decided halfheartedly on another, passed Pig & Khao while walking there, and stepped in on a whim (read: it was freezing and we were lazy and I like puns).Weekday, 7pm: only 2 or 3 tables occupied. We were seated immediately - no reservation! (By 8pm: packed and getting uncomfortably noisy.)The server informed us that two small plates and one large plate was a good amount for 2 people. He lied. It is too much. ""Small plates"" on the menu does NOT mean tapas. Other lessons: Dishes are ordered on the menu from ""light"" to ""heavy."" One bowl of rice is enough for two people.The menu being relatively concise is probably the best and worst part of P&K. Most people will be inclined toward the same few items. We opted for the Sizzling Sisig (pig head!), Khao Soi (red curry!) and Crispy Pata (pig leg!). The sizzling sisig was the winner of the evening. This is actually a good-sized portion if you're pairing it with rice. Don't worry, the fact that it's a pig head is unrecognizable (morbid remark, sorry), with the exception of the munchy crunchy cartilage bits (not sorry for this one). We loved the spicy and lemongrassy hints, plus the heartiness that the egg added. Lori L describes this dish as underseasoned, but to me there were many surprisingly salty notes - to the extent that I enjoyed it better with rice. It reminded me of Taiwanese ""lu rou,"" and has motivated me to hunt down sizzling sisig elsewhere.The khao soi came next (we suspected they were bringing out dishes in the sequence in which we ordered them..), and was a perfect level of spiciness. But the mass of egg noodles drowned in the curry was unexpected and perplexing, and contributed to how shockingly filling this dish was. It was good, but if you're going to come here, fill your tummy with something else.Last was the crispy pata. In a puddle of guilt mid-curry, I realized we couldn't possibly finish it and asked the waiter if the dish had been made yet. He said he'd ask the kitchen (which made me feel like an idiot, since we were sitting in front of the kitchen...). I was itching to cancel it and go for dessert instead, but he came back and said it was ready for plating, but that he could box it up for us. Ah, well. The only thing to say when you're having a great meal and are presented with more food even though you're sad and full already: ""Bring it on!"" I'm glad we tried the pata - it's like a saltier version of German pork knuckle. I had a couple arguments with my friend about this one. I won both: Yes, one of the two dipping sauces is made with pate. No, the pile of white tuber at the side of the plate is not pickled daikon (nor was it tuber). Not sure I enjoyed that green mango much, or that it even did much in cutting the fattiness of the pork, but the two dipping sauces were both brilliant accompaniment to the meat, essentially creating two different, equally delicious dishes. (We ended up each claiming a sauce.)I'd love to see how Pig & Khao's menu evolves in the future. If anything about our dinner was less than perfect, it was the fact that for all the deliciousness, I would've appreciated more diversity in the menu. Yes, the theme is pork and fat and indulgence (and that hasn't been novel for awhile now!), but weeks after the meal, I'm thinking back and I wish we had had more significant sour or cool components in any of the food. Or more mellow/starchy dishes. (And hell if I'm ordering a salad.) As it stands, eating here works less as a focused dinner and more as a laid-back fat-and-protein-gobbling adventure. With beer. They seem to anticipate this and offer $1 Coors Light 5-7pm, but that sort of glorious loafing around seems impossible at the moment, considering how hectic P&K is at the height of its hype.",13,7,13,Ju L.,"Osaka, Japan",960,922,1265

2.0,3/26/2013,"There is one kind of restaurant in NYC where you like the ""idea"" of going there more than the actual dining experience there, and I think it summarizes what I want to say about Pig and Khao.My husband was excited about trying Pig and Khao after reading the NYT review. I made a reservation for 6:30 pm on a Friday evening, but we still had to wait for 25 minutes even though we arrived on time. So we just sat there, simmering in the kitchen smoke permeating the whole tiny restaurant.The restaurant was dim, loud, and very vibrant, and it did feel like a ""happening place."" The tables and seats were very tight, but we didn't mind at all, because we liked the idea of going to Pig and Khao.And our excitement started to die down after we tried the food. Most of the items on the menu were either deep fried or grilled, and very greasy. We felt a bit tired of its lack of cooking variety in its dishes. The following is what we ordered:1. GRILLED PORK JOWL: it came with watermelon, fried pork rinds, and lime-chili fish sauce. This turned out to be my favorite dish of the evening. I wonder if it was because it was the first dish served. 2. QUAIL ADOBO: this dish was more like fried quail drizzled with soy sauce. 3. SIZZLING SISIG: a very greasy dish with chopped pork head -- a mixture of pig's ears, fat, and things that I couldn't identify. The only flavor was from the ""charred"" part of the pork head. 4. Banana Fritters: 4 cut pieces of fried spring rolls stuffed with banana, with salty caramel ice cream on the side. 5. Vietnamese coffee: A bit too watery and no aroma, not enough condensed milk.6. $1 beer between 5-7 pm.7. Jasmine riceDisappointment aside, I just felt uncomfortable after all these greasy foods.

3.0,3/21/2013,"Filipino fusion food. Sounds interesting, right? Not something you hear everyday. Filipino food in general isn't a popular cuisine, even in the melting pot that is New York City. It's hard to make a big pig's foot or bowl of chicken adobo look classy, though Chef Leah Cohen may have done it with her modern approach to Southeast Asian fusion. Myself and four others arrived on St. Patty's Day without a reservation. The door swung open, our ears were met with the sound of 90's rap. It seemed only appropriate given its location in the LES. The dining room/semi-open kitchen were small and busy, packing a forty-five minute wait. Not necessarily a bad thing, unless it was a rainy winter night and the only available seating was on the patio, as was the case for us. A busboy was kind enough to wipe the table and chairs off for us.A perfect time for us to sample the drink selection. I'm no beer drinker and I've never had a Michelada, but after two, I was hooked. I never knew I possessed a spot within beer's reach, but the tangy, savory, barely beer-tasting cocktail definitely hit it. Time passed quickly and when our table was called, hunger had more than set in. I'll admit, we may have gotten a little carried away. Our order went as follows:3 Chicharron3 Quail Adobo2 Crispy Pata3 Sizzling Sisig1 Grilled Curry Lamb Ribs2 Khao Soi1 Special Dessert upon requestThe Chicharron were crunchy yet light and fluffy all at once--  as if that's even possible. I wish the coconut vinegar had been sharper; fried food needs acid to cut through the richness. The Quail Adobo was interesting. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it. A small dish of breaded and fried dark meat quarters smothered in a sort of adobo-ish sauce. There was a sweet, almost creamy addition to the traditional soy and vinegar based sauce, though the menu makes no mention of one. I was intrigued and unable to pinpoint the exact flavor, though butter sounds about right as it would allow the sauce to coat the meat as it did. The size of the meat and frailty of the bones wore their welcome quickly. I found myself wishing it were a huge pork rib or chicken drumstick. The breading was more like a light dusting of rice flour; and added a nice little crunch; a texture traditional adobo lacks.The Crispy Pata was a whole lot of succulent, fried, fatty, salty, delicious knuckle of pig, already deboned, sliced,and fanned. Textures were at play here: boiled fork-tender, well seasoned meat and slightly thick crackly-fried skin. The Sizzling Sisig-- a blistering cast iron platter of cubed pork head with a raw egg, cilantro and sliced chili over top-- stole the show. Before eating, we swirled everything with a chopstick; allowing the egg to cook lightly from the residual heat of the platter. The egg added a silky contrast while vinegar-- the only obvious remaining addition-- completed the dish. The Grilled Lamb Ribs were good, at best, and the portion size was nice. The various elements of the dish: the lamb, pickled beets and whole wheat roti chapati were all well executed; but as a whole, the dish felt uninventive and, well...boring in comparison to the other dishes. Khao Soi was a soup full of both boiled and deep fried egg noodles, lumps of chicken breast and mustard greens. The deeply vibrant orange soup had intense curry flavor and a good amount of heat, all perfectly infused into a creamy coconut milk broth. Also a good sized portion; suited for sharing as a first course. In all fairness, this dish arrived to the table close to last; at which point I was beyond full. Had I paced myself better, I may have been moved by this dish. The Thai Tea Ice Cream Sandwich was not featured on the menu and should be. Thai iced tea ice cream is an amazing concept; one I have never thought of nor seen before. (Probably indicative of how often I try new ice cream flavors.) The Chinese donuts were dry, a little tough (maybe due to temperature) and made the dish difficult to eat. Perhaps just a plating issue. Simple Filipino fare was certainly transformed into a slightly more refined version of itself and, in some ways, I appreciate Chef Cohen's twist on old recipes. However, I learned I must be somewhat of a purist at heart; and apparently more so when it comes to the food of my people. I only miss the truest versions of these dishes now more than ever. I'd recommend Pig & Khao and especially to those looking for a flavorfully fun (and hip) twist on classic Southeast Asian cuisine.

Pig & Khao offers a lot of Filipino favorites such as Longonissa, Sizzling Sisig and even Champorado with BACON. They also have Sizzling Corned beef Hash, Grilled Pork Jowl and Green Mango Salad to name a few. You can scope out the whole Brunch Menu here: pigandkhao.com/wp-conten…I stayed loyal to my heritage and ordered some Sizzling Sisig. Anywhere I go, I always try the sisig. I've been to a place in Brooklyn that served it in a bowl. Basically a bowl full of grease. I wasn't really pleased. This place does it very well and it comes to you piping hot. You have the choice on breaking the egg and mixing it all in. I've seen others let the yolk cook a bit through. I just mix it all in. Squeeze some lime and your good to go. I also got the Grilled Pork Jowl which consists of watermelon, chicharron, toasted rice, chili-lime fish sauce and some herbs. This was pretty tasty and all the elements went well together. I let the chicharron sit in the fish sauce for a bit to soak up all the flavor. The dish was a perfect blend of sweet, salty and had lots of layers of flavor.Brunch isn't complete without a Mimoas. Pig and Khao offers FOUR different kinds to choose from. You can get OJ, Lychee, Watermelon and Mango. Can't make up your mind? Try all 4. Mimosas run $8 a glass, but you can get BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS for $15. That's a sweet deal!All in all the meal was very good. My only drawback was that the entrees didn't include rice. It will cost $3-4 for a small bowl of rice. It's not a big deal, but when you go to other Filipino restaurants it's included. The staff was very attentive and on point.

It wasn't a big deal though, so we put our name down and wandered around the neighborhood scoping out other options. About a hour passed and we decided to call to check on availability. The worker who picked up said the most ridiculous thing ever-- ""Well, you put your name down at around 7:30, and it's only been a hr, so maybe in another half hour."" EXCUSE ME?! Since when did est. time trump availability?! At this point, we were not happy with the service and decided to head to Chinatown for some actual Asian food. Suddenly, we get a text saying there is a table available for us now. Fine. Can't argue with a starving stomach. We walked in to see not one, but FIVE empty tables. RIDICULOUS. We had to wait a hr when they had FIVE freaking empty tables. And then what you ask? They seat us in the worst table possible. Right by the bathroom. All the way in the back. In a corner. We felt like victims ....of clientele profiling? What? Did we not look hip enough? Did they not expect to serve Asian food to Asians? *SHRUG*Fast forward to the food:Chicharron - Don't bother. You get better from the packaged ones at the corner bodega.Green Mango Salad - I am a fan of Thai Mango Salad. And I am a fan of fish sauce. But this salad was swimming in fish sauce and lime juice that were not evenly mixed together. It just didn't blend. And I'm not saying the ingredients they used don't go well together--they do, but just not in this case. I don't know what went wrong, but it did. Overly salted and the chicken tastes like a poor rendition of the grilled chicken you get at Viet restaurants.Grilled Pork Jowl - Wait, what? I thought I was eating the Mango Salad again. The flavors are too similar. If you HAD to order one, I guess go with this one. Also overly salted.Quail Adobo -  The flavor is not bad, but the batter just didn't work well with the quail.

2.0,3/14/2013,"Came here a while back...First off, the positives...  the menu is simple and wait staff were willing to explain any thing you needed to know.  Some stuff are spicy so be sure to ask if that is not your thing.  The drinks were great.  There were a good amt of selections so if you are adventurous, this is your spot. If you enjoy cheap beer, be sure to check that out too!  The weekdays were so crowded and I am sure it is because of the inexpensive beer prices.   Now...the food - that requires literally maybe 1000 words to discuss...I went with friends who knows the ""origins"" of all these dishes. Let's just say in shorter words that it was not up to par based on their standards/background.  I do not like to criticize 'fusion' or food genres that may have gone through transformations of some sort.  I believe that all restauranteurs/chefs have the right and freedom to bring to the public any sort of food however they like.  So that's that for the food part.   People were waiting over an hour for seats.  This place is SUPER BUSY... esp on Tuesday nights.  Guess that is what a top chef owner will bring!  Meanwhile, noticing the other reviews, this place has had excellent feedback. Now, the more important details that I really have to offer is that aside from the tight squeeze (which is ok for the LES atmosphere), I had a situation with them.  I called in advance because of a disability requirement that needed extra space.  On the phone, I wanted to explain that the space was required but the person on the phone said to just show up and that it will be fine.  I trusted that they would accommodate my request. Needless to say, when I showed up, not only was my request ignored entirely but the staff made it sound as if my request was not even a big deal.  That was totally not cool.  As restaurant owners/investors/managers/marketers, we all should try our best to practice  satisfactory customer service all on levels because it can go a VERYYYY long way.  Sure the hipsters and trendy LES goers may be your most frequent customers (that I also understand) but I also think from a humane point of view, I just wish that attention is also paid to those who may not fit into the ""majority"" crowd.  I know this sounds like a complaint but I also feel it is legitimate to bring this up..

That and the fact I had a Google offer for $15 for $30 helped sweeten the deal.  We waited for about an hour without reservations, which was kinda what I was expecting for a Saturday in LES.  The host was pretty cool, he made sure we had drinks and even offered us chicharron to help satisfy our already growling stomachs.  After finally getting a table, we quickley went about our normal routine, which is ordering more than enough food.  In addition to the chicharrons we had been munching on, we ordered the lumpia shanghai, crispy pata, sisig, and a few orders of coconut rice.  All dishes were amazing, in my opinion, although I was expecting the crispy pata to be a little bigger.  The pata was served with a vinagar/soy sauce and a Mang Thomas like sauce, but with a taste of liver in it.  It sounds weird, but it was amazing. The sisig was another star of the show, it was served on sizzling skillet along with a raw egg that gets cooked as you mix the dish at the table.  I've never had it served this way, but it was a welcome surprise when taken with lime juice drizzled on top.  The coconut rice tied everything together nicely when mixed with the dishes.  This was definitely family style food elevated to another level.  I highly recommend coming here and I will definitely be coming back.  Just be prepared to wait.",0,0,0,Michael M.,"Hackensack, NJ",12,31,0

Nevertheless, with so much Manhattan dining awash in stale, overpriced concepts, Pig and Khao is affordable, refreshing and Southeast Asian spicy (*note that the Southeast Asian spicy is equivalent to wildly hot by American standards but by this Yelper's account, friggin' awesome).  Fresh chillies, limes, cilantro and mint?  Yes, please.  Whole fried fish you can pick apart and dress the broth over coconut rice?  Outstanding.  Grilled chicken with green papaya, cashews, lime, mint and all the fixins'?  You betcha.  This place makes me want to renounce my American citizenship, hop on the back of a tuk-tuk and celebrate Thai independence day at a full moon party with illegal firecrackers, glow-in-the-dark body paint and bad house music.  I'm no monk but I would definitely burn some incense at the alter to show my gratitude to the owners of this fine establishment.  Nicely done, Pig and Khao, you've restored my faith in cool, delicious NYC restaurants without being too pretentious or too hipster-y either.",3,4,2,Justin W.,"Manhattan, NY",37,34,0

5.0,2/27/2013,"100th review!  I don't believe in love at first sight, but I really do kind of, sort of love this place from the start.  Growing up in Seattle, I've had more than my fair share of incredible Asian food.   Jordan S's review of this place caught my attention.  Made a reservation via OpenTable and they only had an early dinner slot (6ish).  I'm glad I made that reservation, the place was packed!  .... And it seems that everyone also had a reservation.  When I heard about Pig & Khao, I was picturing a haute bourgeouise Asian Fusion place with ridiculous prices.  I was surprised to see how reasonable prices are.  $1 beer 5-7pm and $15 all-you-can-drink self-serve draft?!  Are we still in Manhattan?!  I wanted to order just about everything on the menu because almost everything had some sort of pork in it (and I can never say no to pork).  Exercising some self-control to save room for the halo-halo, my fiance and I decided to order the pork jowl salad, pork rinds, sizzling sisig (pork head), and coconut rice.  I went back and forth on wanting to also order the crispy pata (comparing pictures on foursquare and Yelp for a few minutes), but glad that I didn't.  The portion is pretty filling.  The pork jowl ""salad"" was very refreshing.  Pretty sure there was ZERO veggies in there other than the cilantro.  This is definitely how all salad should look like: with pork rinds on top.  It was tasty and they put just enough fish sauce to add an interesting taste to the mix without the overpowering fishy smell.  The pork rinds were perfectly seasoned and peppery.  Don't be afraid to order the sizzling sisig.  Yes, it's pork head, but it's diced into little cubes that you can hardly tell what it is anymore.  This dish is amazing... the fatty part just melts in your mouth and the leaner meat (if there is such thing in pork) is cooked to perfection.   As for the coconut rice, I prefer the Indonesian/Malay version that is less sweet, but the coconut rice here is pretty bomb too. Finally... drum roll please: the halo-halo!  I have a weird affinity for halo-halo.  If we ever meet in person, I'll tell you the story.  It's shaved ice with condensed milk, coconut shavings and an unnaturally purple ice cream on top (that's ube flavored). Perfect way to end your meal.  Service is great, friendly and unpretentious.  Space is clean (and the bathroom too!).  Food came out quickly.  Needless to say, I'll be back.",13,10,12,Vania K.,"Seattle, WA",613,587,372

5.0,2/17/2013,"Since the arrival of Fatty Crab in 2005,  the ""Fatty Crew"" has been opening comfortable, semi-hip, low-key restaurants exoticized by way of Southeast Asia across New York City. Given her mother's Filipino roots, and her recent travels throughout the region, it was no surprise that former Top Chef contestant Leah Cohen was tapped to head their latest venture: Pig and Khao.Pig and Khao is situated on a stretch of Clinton street that, while it has invariably begun the process of gentrification (which Pig and Khao doubtlessly contributes to), is not entirely overrun by assholes. Aside from knowledgeable residents of the area slinking in and out of Barramundi, and the 11pm rushes to Prosperity Dumpling, there is little here to suggest that you are in the nouveau Lower East Side; of insipid bars on every corner. Instead, Pig and Khao is the boisterous neighbor in a sleepy hamlet. Truly, it is best not to underestimate the obstreperous atmosphere within: if you enjoy having dinner with a significant other or date on the weekend, but also enjoy hearing them talk, you'd be best served coming at the restaurant's closing or opening. Primetime seems reserved for the hooters and hollerers. The noise is mitigated a bit if you manage to be seated at the kitchen counter, as M and I were. As an obvious added benefit, you get to see the dishes you're considering ordering as they're prepared for other parties. It then becomes a rather difficult proposition to be led by your stomach and not your eyes - the plates are surprisingly large, but the various sights will entice you to order more than any reasonable person ought to. After you've seen sumptuous flecks of pork being braised with various chilies and herbs, chaotically piled onto a cast iron pan, finished off with an egg cracked right down the center, sizzling through the dining room as it's carried away, try to resist ordering one of your own. It's nearly impossible. Equally evident from this seating arrangement is the control with which Ms. Cohen runs her kitchen. In spite of the relatively small breadth of the restaurant, it holds a sizable number of people at capacity, and the kitchen is quite small. But Ms. Cohen and her staff pushed out dish after dish with aplomb. And what a series of delightful dishes they were.M and I began with the Quail Adobo; sticky, vinegary, garlicky, peppery segments of bird that may have singlehandedly answered the question as to why Dick Cheney was intent on hunting them. I had no shame in pulling pieces of flesh from each wing and dipping them into the sauce that had pooled on our small porcelain plate. Such is the power of a sauce thoughtfully comprised of compatible, familiar elements. What followed was what I thought was sure to be our moment of truth; the Sizzling Sissig. The couple adjacent us smiled knowingly at the telltale crackle, having just polished off their own. As we mixed the freshly broken egg, the lime juice, and the caramelized bits of ephemera (ginger, kaffir leaves, bird chilies) the aroma became more than the sum of its parts, and we could mix no further without trying what was before us. The heaviness of the pork and egg was cut by the lime juice, but the smokiness afforded by the charred accoutrements enhanced the natural fattiness and surprising heartiness of the pork. The heat from the chilies lingered briefly, but only enough to assert its presence. Each bite was addicting, and the gambit of finishing the plate before the scattered bits grew cold took on a much more serious air than was necessary. After the pan was removed, we were presented with our penultimate dish: the Khao Soi. A bit redder in color than I had typically seen in Chiang Mai (where the dish originated), I was excited for what I presumed to be the additional heat, while M was terrified. Seeing her trepidation, the sous chef playfully handed her a few more lime segments. But in truth, what aided most in combating the spiciness was our side of coconut rice. Fluffy, sweet, and utterly saturated with coconut flavor, in part thanks to the actual slivers of coconut, it was the perfect accompaniment. The curry had an admirable depth, with the dark meat of the chicken thigh adding additional savoriness and the bitter, tangy punch of pickled mustard greens standing in for the traditional, brighter cilantro. The topping of fried egg noodles was a nod to the typical means of textural contrast. Between the size of the bowl of curry itself and the amount of rice paired with it, we were lucky to finish it, especially given the substantial amount of food we had eaten just prior. But when I saw Halo Halo on the menu, I knew from the onset that we would be trying it, gastrointestinal constraints be damned. The flan bits were an interesting twist, and a thoroughly welcome one, as the dessert was better than I remembered.Ms. Cohen, I fist bumped you ostensibly because of your choice of 2chainz as background music, but really, it was because of your food.",22,13,17,Jordan S.,"Manhattan, NY",865,273,672

Our waitress said that some nights are spicier than others depending on what chilis they have, so perhaps we had a hot night. It was delicious, but order with caution.

As an entree we ordered the Grilled Curry Lamb Ribs that came with an  a little yogurt sauce, pickled beets, whole wheat roti chapatti.  We also ordered a side of their vegetable of the day, which was some sort of Asian green with a tasty little sauce on it.  These lamb ribs were fantastic!  They were tender, well seasoned and grilled, and not gamy or fatty (which can happen with lamb).  The combination of the meaty smoky lamb, with the cool yogurt, tang of the beets, bitterness of the greens, sweetness of the coconut rice rolled up in that light and delicious roti was amazing! For dessert - yeah, we managed to shovel some more food down our throats - we got the Turon (banana fritter, chocolate sauce, and salted caramel ice cream).  This was probably our least favorite dish of the night.  I mean don't get me wrong, we ate it, but it was lowest on the list.  These were essentially pastry wrapped bananas, like you'd see at any typical Thai restaurant.  Nothing to write home about for sure.  However, I would write home about that salted caramel ice cream, because it was fantastic.  I recommend just ordering a dish of that.At the end of this amazing meal, we definitely felt like pigs and cows... not to be confused with Pig and Khao!  It was excellent, and I am soooooooooooo excited to go back when their garden is open!ordinarylifeextraordinar…",0,0,0,Nicole S.,"Suches, GA",140,141,23

The next mistake of the night came when we took our server's advice and ordered the Lamb instead of the Green Mango Salad.  He told us that this would not be too much food and since so many people on Yelp complained about portions we went with the larger dish, which was also his favorite dish on the menu.  The lamb was overcooked and I wasn't a fan of the flavors on this.  The roti that accompanied this was also very dry.  I also suffered from food envy when the Green Mango Salad came out for the table next to ours.  The restaurant is very small and currently does not take reservations.  Be prepared for how close you will be to other diners.  I am definitely coming back to try some of the dishes they ordered.  Just with a more adventurous dining companion.",0,0,0,Karen C.,"Manhattan, NY",33,22,0

Make sure to have it with some coconut rice though as it is very flavorful and savory.The Quail Adobo and the Grilled Pork Jowl were good but not terribly interesting.As for drinks, make sure to get the PX Puko, a blend of coconut water, sherry, whiskey bitters that comes in a freaking coconut with a stick of sugar cane to boot.

4.0,2/3/2013,"This place is dope. Also, $1 beer (miller high life) for happy hour, I am a happy customer by the time I get seated. I do have to say, I thought we were getting snarky comments thrown our way as we were waiting for a while for the remainder of our party to get here but I'll look past it because when we got seated, the service was impeccable. On to the food....WOW. We got the sig sig, which was undeniably the best dish they have. Super flavorful and really kicked me in the flavor buds! It's this greasy, ooey-gooey hot sizzling plate of pork face with an egg on-top that all melts in your mouth. We also went ahead and got some curry noodles which was nutty and what I expected, good, but nothing so special. The whole fish was also a-maz-ing. It came in some sort of broth that closely resembled Tom Yum soup and the fish was decently sized enough for 5 people to nibble at. We order the coconut rice which was flavorful and not so overpowering which was great and I believe that was it. This place is a power-house of flavors! I thoroughly enjoyed it! Also, on a side note, we had an amazing hostess/waitress. She was a young girl that really went above and beyond. No one was using the outdoor bar section in the back and since we were waiting for our party we asked if we could drink beers in the back and she cleaned the entire back in a matter of minutes, recommended some awesome 80's r&b and was just an overall delight!

The coconut rice was great too, but that's great everywhere you can find it so it's honestly not that special.

3.0,1/25/2013,"Gotta say, this place did not wow me. Where to begin?First off, I'm Filipino. And speaking as a Filipino, I usually prefer the more authentic/down and dirty Filipino restaurants, places where you know the lola is cooking in the kitchen.  I can let it slide with some Filipino restaurants that like to mix it up and take it 'new school' like Pig and Khao and Maharlika.  However, I didn't get the vibe this place was 'on it.'For starters, the place is a bit tight, I'm thinking maybe 40 people, tops, including the bar counter tops by the kitchen. There's really no room to squeeze by between tables. Second, the menu was a bit limited. No lumpia? No pancit? Was this restaurant a Filipino restaurant or not?  Third, I did feel a little rushed. There were people waiting by the front for a table and you can tell the establishment is hoping you finish up your meal so they can 'flip it' for the next patrons. We couldn't even finish our drinks at our table, we decided to finish the drinks over by the kitchen as a courtesy to the establishment.The meal overall wasn't all that. The lamb was a bit greasy, the quail adobo was smaller portion than I imagined. The spicy fried oyster and the michelada was ok.Not sure I will be back.",5,0,0,John M.,"San Francisco, CA",526,227,18
4.0,1/25/2013,"Let me preface this by saying that this review is really more like a 4.5My friend and I came here to catch after our original plans for eating at Ippudo were squashed by the almost 2 hour wait. I'm glad we ended up coming here though. Overall the food was really good and the atmosphere lively, but not too loud (for me at least). Over the course of our dinner we had the fried oysters (a special for the evening), market veggies (bok choy in oyster sauce), khao soi (a tiny bit too salty for my liking, but overall really good), and a side of rice. Everything was tasty. As there was a long wait time between the oysters and khao soi, they even bought out a place plate of curried cod, which also tasted great.I can't wait to come back and try the chickpeas, pickled cabbage, and fried fish (whole fish in a stew like broth). Positive note: They are very willing to adapt menu items per dietary restrictions. Although we ended up ordering the special instead, I indicated that I really wanted to try the mussels, but that I don't eat any red meat (the mussels are cooked with a pork sausage). They said that they had no problems cooking the dish without the sausage, should I want to have it the next time I come in.My only real 2 critiques would be the description of the size of the dishes and the minimal dessert options (I really love dessert). There is a huge disparity between what qualified as a snack, small dish, or large dish. Some small dishes seemed like snacks, while others were more like large dishes rather than small. Not a huge issue, but confusing when going there for the first time. As for the dessert options, there are only 2. One of which is halo-halo (awesome). Can't remember the other. While not bad, I think one more option would be perfect.Overall though, I came. I ate. I left happy. (and plan to return soon)",0,1,0,Candace M.,"Los Angeles, CA",183,20,0
5.0,1/25/2013,"Got here a little early (around 6:30pm) on a Thursday night and it wasn't busy at all. We decided to sit at the counter, which was great since it allowed us to watch the cooks in action (and definitely made us want to come back and try everything!).We got the chicharron chips, the special snack that day and it came real fast and was really spicy and tasty (and the coriander soda I got it with was really amazing). Then the crispy rice salad, which you have to wrap in lettuce, very nice (a little too spicy maybe? It was on the verge of hiding the flavors). Then, as many people had mentioned the sizzling sisig, we got it (also we saw other people get it and it looked very good) and it did not disappoint! Really excellent and fun! For desert, we got the special, a Thai iced tea ice cream sandwich. Beyond the fact that is was very cute and very nicely put, it was absolutely amazing. The buns were hot and delicious and the ice cream was melty and tasty. A real treat! We loved it.I noticed that some people complained about the service. We didn't have to wait so I cannot tell how accurate their predictions of waiting time are, but everyone was extremely nice and attentive to us. My friend has a ton (and I'm not exaggerating) of allergies which has made going to asian restaurants a nightmare for him, but everyone (from the waitress to the chef) was extremely careful in making sure everything would go fine.

5.0,1/21/2013,"Loved it!Showed up at 7pm on MLK Jr. Day (a Monday) and the restaurant wasn't crowded at all. We were offered the choice of sitting at a table and ordering à la carte, or sitting at the bar and doing the tasting menu (a Monday-Wednesday option, we were told). After checking out the menus, we chose the tasting menu and weren't disappointed. My boyfriend started with a Vietnamese coffee (""best coffee i've ever had for $3) and I started with the Phuket Punch (very good, the winter spices are so tasty). Maybe it was because it was a quiet night at the restaurant, but the manager/in-charge-guy asked if he could try out a few wine pairings on us. Sure!Anyways, the food:Fried Oysters: The batter was very crispy and the dipping sauce, a lime-y vinegar-y concoction, was great and tangy.  Paired really well with a few sips of sherry (never thought I'd say that). Banana-leaf Cod: Best dish of the night. It was a great piece of cod and the green/yellow curry that it was served with was so so good and the right type of spicy. Paired well with a riesling. Sirloin Beef with Noodles:  Really nice cuts of beef in a very simple broth with noodles, star fruit, mint, and crispy shallots. Very simple and clean tastes compared to the curry that came with the cod. On it's own, as a dish, it could use something to punch it up. But it was good as a follower to the curry and a predecessor to the...BBQ Ribs:  Whoa. Loved. The basting sauce was really flavorful and the meat was a little crispy and very tender. The portion was also very large... two big ribs. Paired with a Filipino beer, which really hit the spot. Ice cream sandwich: I was still in a coma from the ribs, so I barely heard what the dessert was. I think it was a thai tea ice cream between two donut/cookie type things. Very refreshing and a great way to wrap the meal.We also had two other cocktails: the Clinton Cooler (refreshing and light) and the PX Puko (sweet, but good)Service was great, everyone was very nice and attentive. I'm a huge fan of sitting in front of an open kitchen (much to the suffering of my dinner conversation).

The menu does have many items that seem enticing. being 8 people, we ordered a wide array of things(apologies I don't remember any of the items) there seemed to be a common issue with the food--we found a lot of the food salty.

3.0,1/14/2013,"Let me start off with a disclaimer that I am not a huge fan of Filipino food to begin with.Arrived here on a Sunday night and was seated right away.  The place has a chic ambiance that is common in Manhattan Asian fusion restaurants - dim lighting, dark earthly colors, and an open kitchen so that smells permeate the entire place, which isn't large.We had three small plates plus a bowl of rice.  The Chinese sausage salad was nice with sweet fatty sausage complementing the salty fish sauce all on a bed of lettuce.  The pork jowl was new for me and I am not a fan.  It was similar to the salad except had watermelon which was nice.  But it also came with pork rinds (yuck!) and the jowl itself was pretty fatty, which if that's how it's suppose to be, I probably won't be getting again.The highlight was the sizzling sisig.  This was recommended by the waitress and she was right.  Pork pieces came on a hot iron with an egg on top.  The strong salty and sweet of the meat complemented the fragrant coconut rice that we ordered.  Definitely get this dish as it is their speciality.Negative stars for poor service.  Perhaps it was this particular waitress but she almost spilled salad juice on me, forgot our order, and didn't really see to us for the rest of the meal.  Also, I was hoping to be served the three small plates together rather than sequentially.  We got the bowl of rice at the end which would have been appreciated throughout the meal.",2,1,1,Michael P.,"New York, NY",252,278,13
1.0,1/13/2013,"I'm really turned off by my experience here last night.  I've been raving about this place to many of my friends lately so last night three of us went in.  At 8:15 we went in, put our name down and was told the wait would be 45min-hour.  I gave them my # and we went across the street for a drink while we waited.  Well, an hour & a half later we get called our table will be ready.... No joke, 45 minutes after that we were sat making the grand total wait time at 2 hours and 15 minutes! What?!  Strike 1 & 2: Inappropriate and VERY incorrect wait time both before we showed up after being called and before.While we sat for 45 minutes waiting for our table the host & waiter were very nice but negligent.  We had to wait like 15 minutes for our bottle of wine and then when offered an app, we assumed it was comped due to our 2 hour wait and said yes.  I mean at this point an app or round of drinks should be free, right?  Finally we are seated, order food, everything is delicious although the Khao Soi is so spicy that perhaps it could have come a bit earlier - not as the last dish.  Anyway, now it is almost midnight because instead of a 9pm dinner, we started at 10:30.  My friends ask for two more glasses of wine and the waiter has the audacity to tell us they are closing in 10 minutes. WHAT?!  Needless to say, we asked if that meant we had to leave, he said no and we got our wine.  This was the first time we were even remotely rude all night even though we were pretty annoyed. Strike 3:  Really dude?  We waited an extra hour + 15 minutes over your estimation of an hour and you are going to tell us we have to leave prior to being closed? Finally - the last straw.  Our bill comes.  NOTHING is comped and the appetizer (""snacks"") we were offered while waiting is actually on the bill.  Really Pig & Khao, it's $4. We  can afford it, but like....really?  P.S. - the ""snacks"" here are actually not that amazing...they do not live up to the rest of the menu.The wait staff was friendly, a bit apologetic and the food is great but this was just ridiculous.

When we explained our problem, he was nice enough to take it off our check and suggest we order something. We tried the crispy pata, but this dish basically just tasted like the pork jowl and sizzling sisig (I mean, we're basically eating different fried parts of the same pig...).

The sisig was actually disappointing- there was too much fat in it,  quail adobo had flavor but they just reminded me of small miniature pieces of fried chicken. and also the food is served in chinese plates which I thought was a little odd, but i guess it serves the purpose of making the presentation more humble and to give it a  ""home cooked"" meal feel",0,0,0,Arlene Y.,"New York, NY",551,285,347

Pig and Khao was on our list, albeit pretty far down and our original reservation was for WD50 down the street but alas, it's the holidays which translates to: holiday shopping + a penchant for expensive shoes + wall street lifers no longer seeing bonuses = a bunch of broke supper club members. As we wiped away tears while passing WD50, sniff, we found ourselves at our destination and basically the only people there at 7:30 on a Tuesday night; not looking good. We snagged a table right away, obviously and ordered a few starters because we were starving. I was excited for the fried chick peas, Tia Pol in Chelsea does these fabulously. Our waitress, who was lovely, also suggested a special snack which was chicarones, fried pig skin. The chick peas were a let down, damn you Tia, you've ruined me for ever finding the equivalent! The chicarones were good, dipped in some vinegar, but they were greasy. I mean how could they not be? I felt like I needed a grape soda, anyone southern will get that last line. For drinks we went with a bottle of red, bottle of white....no Billy Joel accompaniment. Since they basically stock 2 reds and 2 whites we went with the Pinot Blanc and the Pinot Noir. Pinot Blanc good, Noir, not so much. On to the food. Cucumber and tomato salad: Chinese sausage, toasted rice, shallot, coriander, lime-fish sauce, bibb lettuce. I think the idea here is to create not so healthy lettuce wraps, which we did and they were good. Again, the theme here is fried and unhealthy. Next up, crispy red curry rice salad,minced pork, crispy garlic, shallot, sawtooth coriander, ginger, peanuts, lime-fish sauce and boy did this have a kick. Well done!  We had to try the SIZZLING SISIG as it is their signature dish. If you can get around what it is and find the actual pieces of meat instead of fat this is another tasty dish.  For large plates we ordered the crispy pata and the whole fried fish. The pata was good  and the whole fish was excellent. I'm a big fan of whole fish and the hot and sour sauce and really all the flavors worked very well. The one Filipina in our group has a shellfish allergy which prevented her from partaking in this dish. It was quite a shame as it was probably the best dish. We had a great time, we could be as loud as we wanted to be and our waitress was tres cool. The fact that the above mentioned club member was not impressed, and let's face it these are her peeps, led me to believe Pig and Khao was a bit of a let down. Bummer.

There's a cute outdoor space in the back where you can wait if the front is too crowded, though they don't have heat lamps...The menu skewed towards Filipino rather than Thai, though I am sure there is a bit of an overlap. My husband is Filipino, and we've tried quite a few Filipino places around NY (Café 81, Maharlika, Engeline's, etc.) and this one is a nice chic alternative in line in vibe and price with Maharlika. Cute space, not overly decorated. We ordered: The Fried Chickpeas: Yummy, crunch and addictive. Crispy Rice Salad: Surprisingly spicy. Nice texture with the crunchy fried rice bits. Green Mango Salad: Yum. Just like Som Tam. Nice contrast to the fatty dishedWatermelon and Pork Jowl salad: Delish. Similar to the watermelon salad at Fatty Crab. Sizzling Sisig: Nice and fatty. The parts they used weren't too obscure. Khao Soi: Nice standard curry dish. Crispy pata: Came pre-cut, which was nice. We had the Phuket Punch (more or less a tart wine spritzer? Good, though) and Micheladas for drinks. The only complaint was the bar was backed up (just one bartender) and so the drinks took a long time to get to our table. They recommended that we do about 5- 6 small plates and two large format plates. Let me tell you that it was a ton of food despite us getting 5 small plates and just one large format plate.

4.0,11/19/2012,"Hong Kong Style? Not to be confused with Shaolin style, apparently the large volume beers (Get the Nest Owl, DO IT!) come with the option of drinking it out of a bowl. I pictured a Pho bowl, but sadly it was only a rice bowl. If you like drinking sake out of wooden boxes, mead out of ox horns, or wine out of comically large and ornate goblets, then this may be the option for you. Our party of 5 was lucky to grab a table within 5 minutes of arriving on a Friday night. I'm sure as the word gets out, that may change but the host said people can kill time in one of the neighboring bars. Our group decided to try several of P&Ks Thai/Filipino offerings.The salmon chips were a little too fishy for my taste and I don't mind fish sauce. If you're not a fan of anchovies, then I'd skip it.We also tried 3 small plates, the sisig, quail wings, and pork jowls. I'd recommend any of these 3. The sisig was really tasty. I've had this dish at other places and this one had better spicing than the other ones I've had. The other places were really heavy on the fat content and really required a large amount of rice to balance out the richness. P&K blends the right amount of fattiness with savory meat.We had to order two of the quail wings and they were pretty good. They arrived coated in an adobo sauce and depending on your chop stick skills, you may get a little messy eating them. They had a nice garlic and soy flavor to them.The pork jowls dish with chicharrons tasted really good with its blend of watermelon, cilantro and fish sauce. The sweetness of the watermelon, worked well with the savory/sweet of the fish sauce and jowls plus the saltiness of the chicharrons. The Chinese parsley added the right amount of ""brightness"" to the whole dish. When it comes to the large plates, the crispy pata had good flavor but it just seemed like there were more bones then shank in my opinion. There was a liver based sauce for dipping that was pretty tasty and should be mentioned. The better dish we had was the curried lamb ribs with roti. People could make their own wraps and add as much or little yogurt and pickled beets to suit their palate. It was a nice experience eating with friends and drinking beer while hip-hop played in the background. There's nothing like munching on a quail wing while Biggie's Notorious thugs or Lil Wayne's Right Above It plays in the restaurant. Don't be surprised to find yourself head bobbing to the beats.

4.0,11/19/2012,"Loving this new wave of Top Chef run / Asian deliciousness that's taking over NYC. Stopped in on a random Tuesday night for a fun dinner. After having got lost about 4 times I finally made it in to the restaurant. The space is cute, small but cozy with Leah around the food bar doing her thing. So between two, the suggest about 3 starting dishes and one large entree - For a snack we started off wit the salmon skin chips - salty and flavorful. The accompanying sauce is good. We had a spicy cabbage slaw sent to our table my mistake so we ended up just keeping it around - but I am glad it wasnt charged on our bill because it just wasnt tasty at all. For starters we had the Khao Soi - defreakinglicious - savory, crispy just warming (a must) as well as the Sizzling Sig Sig - so so so so fragrant another absolutely tasty and wonderful starter. It came out on a hot plate sizzling hot with a runny egg (best combination ever). The grilled pork jowl, I dont know I wanted to like it so much but I just didnt find it to be mind blowing. For our entree we opted for the whole fried fish. The presentation, the sauce, the texture of the fish was wonderful. A little messy to eat on a date but ordering an entire crispy fish means your in the I dont have to wear make up everyday kind of relationship. I definitely say go for it. The cocktails are good out of the three I had that night, I must say that the phuket punch and the RIDICUOUSLY large asahi can will do the job just right.

3.0,11/17/2012,"Wow there are so many restaurants to choose from in the LES. This one was pretty nondescript on the outside, slightly hard to find without any signage but once you walk in, the warm smell takes you in immediately.Walked in with no rsvp on a Friday evening and was told that it'd be about a 15-20 min wait for two. We sat in a little corner waiting section and ordered some wine to get comfortable. There's no real selection of alcohol in here--a few different beers, some basic cocktails and a few basic nonspecific wines. Apparently, $15 lets you help yourself to an unlimited amount of beer from a keg somewhere inside, but I didn't indulge.We were sat near the front (was hoping for a seat near the bar so we could watch some of the preparation process) and immediately the hostess handed menus and explained the cod special for the day. She must've given us exactly a minute as she came back shortly after to ask if we were ready. I was slightly irked by the urgency but was ready to order anyway.We opted to go with two small dishes and a large. For the small dishes, we got the cod special and mussels. For our large, we got the crispy pork pata. We also got a side of coconut rice.The mussels were fresh and came in a pretty nice broth which was slightly sweet, acidic and spicy. There were sweet sausages and small bread puffs which were great for absorbing the broth.The cod was cooked in banana leaf and extremely tender. Had a lime/chili/curry type flavoring to it. We devoured it quickly.The pata was pretty damn good. Crispy pieces of pork meat and fat in a light seasoning. The milky coconut rice was a perfect complement to the fatty dish.All in all, good food but the damage was over around $60pp and I would rather spend similar money on a lunch pre-fixe meal at Gramercy Tavern or omakase at Jewel Bako.

The salmon skin starter had a nice crisp and the dipping was to die for. don't oder the salmon skin if you are averse to salty food. The mango salad is more Thai and was a great surprise, but a tad bit too salty even for someone that puts fish sauce on everything. Ambience is also nice and warm. Wait staff are cute, friendly, and attentive. The banana turon was not impressive. The banana was overcooked and was soggy.

5.0,11/14/2012,"Why Come Here? Phenomenal & interesting SE Thai & Filipino fare, lively atmosphere, cheap beerRecommended meal for 2: 3 small plates and a coconut ricePig and Khao may be my new favorite restaurant in New York City. Let's take a look at the tape: Delicious and interesting riffs on one of my favorite cuisines (SE Asian). Check. Lively atmosphere with sassy waitresses. Check. Unlimited keg beer for $15 with great cocktails for everyone else. Triple Check.Yes, Top Chef contestant Leah Cohen's new restaurant has something for everyone from foodie to frat lord. From what I can tell, there are only two drawbacks. First, the no reservation policy means fairly long waits (expect around an hour at prime times). This is mitigated by the unlimited beer you will drinking and the large outdoor garden you can wait in (for another month at least). Second is the the open kitchen. While I don't mind having my coat smell like bacon for the next week, I can conceive that some of you might.On to the food. The menu is divided into three sections: snacks, small plates and large plates. The snacks consist of fried chickpeas or Russ & Daughters salmon skins and are perfect little bites to share while you wait. The small plates make up the majority of the menu and have a pork focus, as you may have surmised from the restaurant's name. However, there are plenty of suitable options for those who don't eat pork (although I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're a veggie). We had a group of four and did most of our damage on this section, ignoring the pricier large plates.  My recommendations are below, while my thoughts on everything we ate are available on DishEnvy.Green Mango Salad:  Spicy and refreshing, this salad bursts with great Thai flavors.Quail Adobo:  Surprisingly meaty little wings that were sweet, spicy and tangy.Khao Soi: Everything comes together perfectly here: slippery egg noodles, spicy greens and aromatic red curryMussels:  A very tasty green curry base, but the mantao bun stole the show. Katherine described it as a pretzel meets doughnut and it's perfect for sopping up the curry and all your other sauces as well.Coconut Rice:  What's that you say? It's just rice cooked in coconut milk, how good can it be? Try it and all will be revealed.",4,1,2,Jay Z.,"Manhattan, NY",156,126,0

5.0,10/23/2012,"We ate at Pig and Khao just a few weeks after it opened and it is officially my new favorite LES restaurant.  I admit, being the creepily huge Top Chef fan that I am, Leah Cohen was 80% of the reason I made the trek from the UWS (the unlimited beer constituted the other 20%.) I was definitely not disappointed.  I went with my husband and two friends so we were able to order a couple of different dishes and drinks.  There was not one thing we tried that we would not happily pay to eat again.From beginning to end....The atmosphere: Fun, trendy, and sure, maybe a little hipster.  We ate outside so most of all it was roomy, if not a little lonely.  There's no music, fewer people, no opportunity to see the cooking process (which is out in the open in the main room.)  Outside definitely has a much different vibe; it almost feels like a different restaurant.   It's also where everyone else comes to fill up on their unlimited beer so in some ways, it kind of feels like your restaurant is in the backyard of a frat house.  I think I would prefer to eat inside next time,The meal:Quail Adobo: delicious and well-cooked.  Our friends were a little hesitant about quail (they're not quite as adventurous eaters as we) but everyone loved it and the accompanying sauces. We were fighting over the last legPork Jowl: this was by far the dish I was looking forward to the most but did not end up being my favorite of the night.  Tasty.  The watermelon was a nice balance to the chicharron and lime sauce but I agree with the reviewer who said it reminded them too much of a salad.Khao Soi: The hit of the night!  Borders just on the edge of being almost too spicey but this  was hands down everyone's favorite dish.  We devoured every last drop of this soup until there as nothing left and then seriously debated ordering another bowlCrispy Pata: we ordered this based on a review we read and were not disappointed.  Very hard to share - as in, I did not want anyone else to have a single bit.  The pork was sooooo tender and perfectly cooked and the crispy outside was a whole treat on its own.We were all so blown away by the meal that we didn't want it to end so we ordered not one, but both of the desserts.   We got both desserts because I really wanted the Turon (banana fritter with salted caramel ice cream and chocolate sauce) while everyone else wanted the halo halo.  I admit, the halo halo was good - it was light, non-filling, and complex in flavor - but the Turon was out of this world.  Seriously, I dream about it at night.  Everyone else pretty much agreed too.Overall, the atmosphere was fun, the food was great, and if that's not enought - bottomless beer.",5,2,3,Lauren M.,"Manhattan, NY",10,42,1

Saw the wonderful chef work it, dazzling and sprinkling things here and there onto the plates. I ended up getting 2 small plates (Pork Jowl and Sizzling Sisig) and coconut rice. Each small tapas range from $13-16 and the coconut rice was $3. The coconut rice is a MUST have!Thankfully they brought the meals one at a time so that we could both share the meal without it going cold on us. First got the Pork Jowl. Right amount of spice and sweetness to it. I wonder what it was. The server said it was ""thai suet?"" but I have my doubts that it was. Whatever it was, it was great. I even thought that they didn't need to serve the plate with the crispy chicharron and they still would have had a great plate. The chicharron was a nice addition though.Next was the Sizzling Sisig with a side order of the coconut rice. OMG, must, must, must, must have. Comes out on a hot frying pan, and with an egg over it. Mix the egg with the rest and Holy Khao, it's an absolute winner. I will definitely be coming to this place more often. Even might go here over cocoron which is nearby even with the weather getting colder.Also on a side note: There's an ""all you can drink"" option here at $15/pp. Currently they are serving Miller High Life.

While our waitress said this was the right amount of food, I think two small plates and one large was better for us.  By the third small plate, I was getting full and almost forgot we had one more dish coming.  I wouldn't call the small plates ""tapas"" because they are larger portions than typical tapas. Quail adobo - very tasty and adobo sauce was done nicely.  Quail takes it up a notch and be prepared to use your hands.Mussels - broth was good along with the spicy peppers; mussels were small even though we're in a ""r"" month.Pork jowl - this is refreshing and savory and was glad that chicharron was able to stay a little crispy to provide some texture.

Yes please. Crispy Pata - JFC. Just order this, it's retarded. Jump ball between the Pata and the Sisig for best dish at P&K.Khao Soi - really dug this bowl of noodles. The cripsy noodles they add into the regular noodles give it a nice balance of textures and does a great job of soaking up the delicious curry broth. Didn't love the chicken in here, but only bc I'm a chicken hater. Overall, this is quite decadent.Curry Lamb Ribs - fake-me-out lettuce wraps, with whole wheat roti subbing in for the lettuce. Lamb was very good, and really liked the pickled beets that came with this.The chickpeas we had were kinda meh, I wouldn't order them again. And the Grilled Pork Jowl reminded me too much of that watermelon salad with pork thing they serve at Fatty Crab. I know the Fatty Crew is involved here but, you know, we've already seen that trick.Note: they don't have a liquor license yet so the ""cocktail list"" is beer and wine based. Which isn't a bad thing, just want to give you guys a head's up.

2.0,10/1/2012,"For the record, I was really looking forward to checking out the newest Filipino restaurant in town.  I knew it was going to be wildly crowded because it had only been open for about a week and a half, so I was completely prepared for our party of 8 to wait around an hour for a table.  What I was not expecting was having to wait almost 3 hours, after being told several times that our table would be ready in 'just ten more minutes'.The manger came over and apologized several times, telling us that we'd be seated in 10 minutes and that he'd bring over some snacks for us to munch on in the mean time.  We were told that they'd be bringing over snacks a total of 3 times, but they never came.  We were told our table would be ready in short order, but they really meant over 2 and a half hours.  We looked over the menu in the waiting area and ordered before we'd even sat down.  By this point, it was a little after 10 PM.Again, I went into this situation knowing that our party of 8 would have a substantial wait before we were seated.  It is, however, completely unacceptable for the manager of a restaurant to blatantly mislead customers into thinking that they'll be seated shortly, when the reality is much, much different.  If he had just been honest and told us that we'd have to wait at least two hours, we could have gone to the bar across the street and come back later.  We ordered a variety of dishes that were all tasty, but definitely overpriced.  The complexity of the flavors being used and the portion sizes were not equivalent to the $13 price tag.  And honestly, charging $26 for a medium sized portion of  crispy pata is just ridiculous.  We also ordered the crispy rice and curry dish, which was tasty, but I couldn't help but think that I was paying around $13 for a small pile of rice and minuscule pieces of meat.   Was the food good?  Yes, it was pretty much decent.  Would I be inclined to go back, be treated poorly by a manager who has no idea how to manage a restaurant, and then pay too much money for small portions of only average food?  Absolutely not.",3,1,1,Kate F.,"Jersey City, NJ",2,36,0
3.0,9/30/2012,"3.5 stars.Top Chef Leah Cohen partners up with the Fatty Crew... and opens up this hipster, very appropriate LES restaurant that flairs Asian Fusion, predominantly Thai with Filipino influences.  It's a great spot if you want to kick back and have a few fun cocktails and try some interesting, spicy & sizzling dishes.  Khao literally means ""rice"" in Thai, but the naming convention has a fun play on animals.  The restaurant itself is probably 90% meat.  BE prepared.  We shared the quail adobo, sisig & noodles with red curry & chicken.   All pretty good choices... the sisig had some heat to it...that made it unbearable for my friend... i loved it....  the noodles were VERY good... something I can see myself eating again.  had a bit of sweet, spicy, crunchy... lots of textures, and the chicken was super tender, as were the noodles, which were so delicate.  my least favorite was probably the quail.  it was crispy, but a tad bit on the bland side.  i've had better...but since I love quail, i generally never say no and am usually able to finish it. i pointed to what looked like a coconut cocktail conconction in its own shell.....  i found out AFTER the fact that I have already ordered...that the coconut juice was mixed with sherry & whiskey barrel bitters.... not bad.  could have been stronger, but it was still really fun to drink out of.pig & khao's got great potential.  especially in the little hip side of the neighborhood they call Lower East Side.  There are so many more items on the menu that is a must try for next time.",2,0,1,Brittany H.,"Santa Monica, CA",1048,638,254

4.0,9/27/2012,"I went tonight after hearing about the buzz, and I'm always searching for good Filipino food that rivals homecooking. This space is cute- very different from the old Felai decor, and I especially appreciated the Filipino stars that adorned the backyard. As far as the food goes, it's good for Filipino fusion- much better than other places that I've been to in the city. I had the sisig which was spicy, but lacked the characteristic crispiness. The pata was good, but it wasn't really pata (pork hooves). It was really lechon, roasted pig. The end to my meal was satisfying- the halo halo had all the ingredients that I love- pinipig, flan, and ube ice cream with shaved ice.",3,0,0,THEA R.,"New York, NY",9,35,0
4.0,9/27/2012,I've only been here a few times but everytime I come here I love it!! Its so delicious...I never though I'd like pork that much.  I just feel sad for the little piggies that had to sacrifice their lives for my delicious meal. Plus the all you can drink beer is really cool.,3,1,0,Aminda P.,"Great Neck, NY",39,34,0
5.0,9/26/2012,"My friends and decided to check this out after we read that it's a restaurant that just focuses on PORK. What's not to love?! Also, if you go on a good day, you can sit out in the patio, which looked very nice when I peeked outside. They have $15 all you can drink beer and you go tap that yourself. Kind of cool but we passed on that to save room for all the pigs we ate :DWe were a group of five and got one large plate and 3 small plates. It's more of a sharing restaurant, so don't be germaphobic. Crispy Pata is MUST. I don't care what you think about pork. If you're coming to this restaurant, you need to eat this. The skin was so crispy and the meat was super tender and moist, not dry at all. And it came with this AMAZING LIVER SAUCE. Who knew liver sauce could be that awesome?! For the small dishes, we got the quail adobo, which was really good and had really yummy sauce but only one tiny quail egg. It was awkward to split that egg, but no fear, my spoon-splitting skills are amazing. We also got the Grilled Pork Jowl, which was the most interesting. It was on the spicy side, but nothing too extreme. The pork was basically fried, crispy pork fat. Again, what's not to like? The watermelon went surprisingly well with it too! The last small dish we had was the Khao Soi, which is a curry noodle dish. It was good, but not as good as the rest of the dishes. The pork was really tender, but the curry was more coconut milky than I would've preferred. It gets spicier as you eat it though. We got some white rice to finish out the curry after we ate all the noodles.  I would recommend trying another noodle dish if that's what you're here for.All in all, a good, piggy experience! My friend and I also got the Phuket Punch, which was good, if you want a cocktail. In my opinion, it's a little pricier than two dollar signs, but not something terrible. The four dishes, two cocktails and one beer came out to be a little over 100.",5,1,2,Bonny T.,"New York, NY",15,14,0
5.0,9/26/2012,"Holy Cow! What an unbelievable  dining experience. We were a table of seven which enabled us to sample most of the menu.  The combination of flavors and the way they popped out was amazing.  The deserts were killer,OMG.Our waitress was great and very knowledgeable.  She was able to describe each dish and knew all the ingredients.  The service was attentive and we were not  at all rushed.  The decor was new, clean , crisp and stylish.  I loved the dragon scooter.The outside patio area was an added plus and very comfortable.I can't wait to go back.",4,1,0,dr alan r k.,"Deer Park, NY",2,9,6
