4.0,4/29/2019,"Had dinner on a Sunday night, the food was perfect. My husband got steak and rosemary potatoes, he said it was one of the best steaks he has ever eaten. I got braised lamb shanks and they were good as well. My cocktail was delicious and so was dessert. I'd give it 5 stars but the waiter seemed like he had better things to do than be at work.

2.0,4/28/2019,"Went there to celebrate my engagement.  Had a 8:45 reservation. Showed up 15 min early and was immediately seated.  We were seated for 10 min before the waiter or anyone came by. We ordered a bottle of wine and it was 15 min before it showed up.  At some point during that time, two pieces of bread were brought to the table.  After the wine arrived, it was an additional 15-20 min before our entree arrived.  We decided to spilt the steak (which was the only redeeming quality to the dinner).  We told the waiter when we ordered, that we were going to share and after arrival, we had to ask twice for an additional plate.  Steak was cooked perfectly, green bean side was a little underdone but tasty.",0,0,0,Eric O.,"Tolar, TX",176,1,0

1.0,4/26/2019,"The waitress had a big attitude. I asked her for a menu and when she got it she just put it on the chair and said ""There"", she didn't even hand it to me and expected me to go all the way across the chairs to get it. When I asked her for the menu, she gave me a mean look. The thing I was mostly angry about was when we were ready to order and my friend and I asked for a specific drink (I can't remember which one) she said they were all out when i just saw people bringing out that same drink. When I called a waitress nearby to ask her if they really were all out, she said no. I was completely stunned and asked her why she said that they were all out and she ignored me and walked away, how disrespectful.  I would've put 5 stars if the waitress was at least a little bit nice. But no, she ruined the whole experience. This place needs to hire nicer waitresses.",0,0,0,Caitlyn F.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,0

2.0,4/15/2019,"I would give just one star (or no stars, but that's not possible) for the female bartender with a major attitude problem, but am adding a second because the second bartender who helped us was quite nice. We arrived around 6 PM when happy hour was still going on and had to ask the bartender for a menu - we weren't offered one. She gave us just the wine list. We had to ask again for a cocktail menu, which we were given, but it had no happy hour info on it. We tried to flag her down to ask for a happy hour menu to no avail, so we took the menus she gave us and went to the front bar instead where the nice bartender there gave us a happy hour menu. Why would she not give us all three menus to begin? She had a mean face on the entire time and completely spoiled the experience. What's the point in being in the service industry, especially in a position that relies on tips, if you're going to be so incredibly rude?

Last night was a special occasion to have family together for a show in the city, so this was the trip to do it.  Been to other celebrity chef places and most times i've been disappointed.  Last night was very different.  First... Alex was there, in the kitchen cooking last night.  We were excited to eat her food, and from the first bite of bread to sharing three appetizers (the mushrooms, gnocchi mac and cheese, and the Brussels sprouts)... to our entrees, everything was delicious.   We all enjoyed the service, the layout, the drinks... background music.  Staff was very friendly.  Overall a great experience.  Didn't meet her, but my Mom briefly did.  I was just happy to eat her food and it was actually better than i even expected.  Thanks Chef Alex!",0,0,0,Jeff W.,"Edison, NJ",0,1,0
1.0,4/8/2019,"This restaurant does not know the meaning of hospitality. I have dined here on several occasions since the food is pretty tasty and menu is interesting, and I have also recommended it to friends since it is near the theatre district but not a touristy place. No more, however, since I received a voicemail today cancelling my reservation for tomorrow since there was a ""glitch in the system."" Since I felt I deserved a better explanation, I called, left my own VM since no one picked up, and did not get a call back. When I tried later, I managed to reach someone who told me the restaurant was closed for a private party but OpenTable didn't realize it. When I complained that this had happened to me before ( having my reservation cancelled due to a private party), she replied she was just doing what she was told to do by her supervisor and offered no further explanation or apology. Shame on me for letting this happen twice, both times the day before my reservation, which does not give one much time to pivot. I will not let this happen again, as I will not be returning.

1.0,4/2/2019,"I came here for a corporate lunch today (9 guests) at 12:30. Two in the group (including myself) had to jump on a conference call, which we took upstairs for 30 minutes. When we rejoined the group, my soup and entrée (fish) were cold, understandably, so they offered to reheat. Instead of asking them to reheat (to save time for the rest of my party), I asked to pack the soup and just eat the entrée as-is cold. They took my soup away and then returned saying no soup container was available, only paper cartons for carry-out (which I understand if you want to cut down on plastic but the server should know that and tell me at the table instead of having the back-and-forth). I eat the soup and ask them to pack the fish entrée so I can take with me (only had one bite) to save time so we can finish. I get my dessert course. Check arrives. I ask for my carry out entrée and the server says there was a misunderstanding and they threw it out.... WHAT A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.

His recommendations were uffff delicious. The bread was nicely toasted and the butter with parsley and chives was just too good! Of course I needed a drink and I went with the Calamansi which consisted of Absolute vodka, fresh watermelon ice cubes, torn mint leaves, calamansi lime juice for $17. Not a fan of vodka but the drink was good/sweet and I was Into the copper pineapple cup. For the appetizer I went with the Gnocchi Mac & Cheese for $18 which was super delicious. Moving into the large plate I got the tobacco smoked double cut pork chop with smashed black eyed peas for $44 and totally worth it! I haven't had pork chops in so long, this medium well done baby tasted like everything i needed. I also had the white cloud cauliflower for $26 and sautéed string beans for $10.

4.0,2/21/2019,"To be completely transparent, I wanted to come to Butter after hearing about it on Gossip Girl! The first thing I noticed about Butter was how dark it was - it is kind of in a large basement where you have to walk down stairs when you enter the door. The restaurant was not very crowded, we were there in the evening on a weeknight and only a few of the tables were full. The bread and butter at the beginning of the meal were great, but unfortunately, one of our dishes (fish) was cooked incorrectly as an entree.

5.0,2/21/2019,"I was in love from the 1st bite of bread! The rolls were crusty & crunchy on the outside & soft & fluffy on the inside. The butter is homemade. It is soft & creamy with a fresh, garlicky flavor.As an appetizer, I had to try the thick veal cut bacon with a mustard sauce. First of all, a knife is not needed to cut it. It is beyond tender. The fork just breaks it apart. Before even sticking my fork in it, the smoky aroma hits my nose & then hits my tastebuds on the 1st bite. The mustard sauce is such a great complement, that you get the acidity while still getting the smoky flavor. This was the best choice I could have made. Never before have I seen lamb sausage. When I see it on the menu with cavatappi pasta, I have to try it. The lamb is leaner tasting than most meats that I have eaten before, so it gives a different taste. It is spicy, but not to the point that it burns my mouth, but enough to clean out my sinuses.There's always room for dessert. If you want to taste Heaven in your mouth, the Raspberry Beignets are the way to go! Hot & fresh out of the fryer, filled with raspberry sauce & then topped with sugar is Heaven enough for anybody. If that isn't, dip it in the vanilla bean sauce & you'll be sitting on Cloud 9!",0,0,0,Stephanie S.,"Southeast Yonkers, Yonkers, NY",39,11,27

We had a HUGE party of 14 and she never skipped a beat!!The ""famous rolls"" were cold but the butter was delish.   The Bass was delicious yet it came out tepid in temp, and I thought the Rainbow Carrot app would have been warm? It wasn't terrible. Lastly I ordered the Chocolate Pot D'Creme...absolutely terrible. We returned two. The Raspberry beignets were more like Chinese donuts. Overall the meal was mediocre at best. It was dismally disappointing because I soooooo wanted it to live up to the hype and name.

First of all, I'm a huge fan of Alex and Food network with high hopes for Butter considering Alex's many food victories.  However, and not mincing words (no pun intended), sampling menu tasted like SH$#%^T.   Seafood salad lacked salt and acidity. Roast beef and potatoes brought somewhat fond childhood memories of Hungry Man's TV dinners, but not in a good way for an adult palette. Lukewarm Roast beef was sliced cold-cut thin and potatoes left a rancid and processed after taste. Only good dish was the chocolate panna cotta, most likely the only thing on the tasting menu not batch-produced. Instead of being inspired to return as a full-fledged, customer, I left quite disappointed and lost some respect for Alex and her credibility. I'm wondering If the menu was intentionallly diluted for restaurant week, but if that is the case then the strategy is not only flawed but condescending.

Restaurant week menu - DIFFERENT from the one I liked on the website.Bread and butter were really good but that was the best thing. Didn't have to spend $42 pp + tax and tip for that.Appetizers:Beet carpaccio-too much sauce. Pretty tasteless overall, very small portion. There was a seafood appetizer. Flavors not interesting. Portion too small.Main courses: cod cake - was a mash of potato and mash of tasteless fish topped with some sort of asian fish sauce thing that didn't go well at all (we are Asian). The roast beef dish tasted fine but also very little meat, had some potato and gravy that looked like an amateur put it together (Alex G. created these dishes??) and the portions were both too small. At this point, my stomach is still growling from hunger.Desserts: ""when is dessert coming?"" ""Oh, you ordered dessert?"" Enough said. It tasted above average though.They did refill the water on time and brought the check quickly so we could make it to the Broadway show. Disappointed. Wanted to come here for a long time, saw it on gossip girl and we watch chopped. If you have an Asian palette, this place is not for you.

3.0,2/2/2019,"Review for Restaurant Week Dinner:This celebrity chef restaurant is right in the middle of the corporate hub- bryant park, and has the vibe of an elite club. The entrance leads to their private dining room and the stairs lead to the main restaurant area. There are booths and tables and a huge bar. On a friday night, half of the restaurant was empty though. So when we requested for a booth, we were unsure why the hostess was adamant. Anyhow, since we had a reservation, we were directed to a table.We ordered off the restaurant week menu. We got the seafood salad, beet carpaccio, ravioli, cod cake, toffee cake and chocolate panna cotta.  Plus we also ordered cocktails as the menu looked surprisingly unique. We got a rye based cocktail and a blood orange aperol based cocktail. Both a little too strong but delicious nevertheless. Loved the parker house style dinner rolls with the house churned butter. The food was abysmal from the first bite. Seafood salad was strewn with shells. The beet carpaccio was decent but I guess they ran out of plates as they had served it in a dented plate! The ravioli and cod cake were just fine. The desserts were uniquely sad! The toffee cake was over baked and hence super dry- the saving grace being the icecream. The panna cotta was not creamy or jiggly- it was over cooked and soo bitter. A little sauce of some kind could've saved it! Our main server was great but the other servers who were getting our dishes were in a major hurry to keep clearing our courses so that they could quickly get us the next course! And in a half empty restaurant! Thankfully they did get us a second round of those delightful rolls- all warm and toasty!Guess this place is good for office meals or the regulars who live around.",2,0,0,Garima K.,"Jersey City, NJ",159,138,150

Had a dozen oysters, had requested all east coast and briny. Got the most mild oysters I've ever eaten. The rosemary and sea salt potatoes had neither rosemary nor sea salt and were quite oily. Green beans were lukewarm and sauce was congealed. Ordered two desserts and only got one that was supposed to be hot, but this was within 20 minutes of the show starting and our server had disappeared.

The food was very good, presented well, but lacked a bit of flavor and as is normal for restaurant week, the portions were a little small. I started with the beet salad which was tasty but the beets were a bit salty. We ordered the gnocchi mac and cheese (as an extra) which was delicious, but one dimensional. The gnocchi were extremely soft, but only tasted of heavy cream and cheese. For my main I got the prime rib which was three pieces of thinly sliced beef over sliced potatoes and onions with a brown gravy (bit small for a main). Again, the dish was enjoyable, but didn't wow me. It tasted like a dish you would get going over to a friend's for dinner. Dessert was sticky toffee pudding which was good (the hazelnut ice cream was incredible) but way too sweet. I am not a sweet person, but my friend who loves sweet admitted it was a bit much even for her. She ordered the apple salad which she liked and said had a nice vinaigrette, the ravioli (tasty but overwhelmingly buttery), and the chocolate panna cotta which we both enjoyed, it had a cocoa flavor and was not very sweet. Overall the restaurant stuck to it's name as most dishes that had butter in them (including the rolls they bring to the table with plain and herbed butter) were very buttery.

However, with all the namesake butter served alongside every course, Butter may end up being some people's final plate because of coronary failure. That's not meant to be a dig at Butter, but rather a compliment as to how they manage to take a simple table staple and transform it into the star of the show! Walking into Butter, and descending into the cavernous dining room, with glass ceilings above, one can feel like a fish (one that would presumably be served with a pat of butter no matter how it was cooked). While many restaurants' bread and butter may be a specialty entree or dessert, at Butter, it is, quite literally their bread and butter! Thick soft rolls served piping hot, come to the table with soft pats of compound butter, blended with herbs taking center billing. If biting into a piece of bread and butter can be refined to an art, this is the Mona Lisa of carbs and fat. Not to be outdone, the steak comes with two medallions of compound butter. Much like a child putting together ice cream and pizza, spreading the butter on the tender steak feels like a sin, yet tastes divine, as the symphony of fats and oils perform an interpretive dance across your taste buds. Perfect for an executive business lunch, a pre theater meal or just grabbing a bite with friends, Butter is a fantastic restaurant - just make sure to have a run afterwards.",4,1,4,Edward M.,"Manhattan, NY",209,259,1991

The cocktails and wine were perfect. The service and food left MUCH to be desired. I really like chef Alex and as fans we have given it another chance, our first experience during restaurant week last year was awful. We had to wait so long for our food we politely asked for TWO more rolls to share because we were having multiple glasses of wine. I felt like I was asking for a diamond. I even said I will gladly pay for more bread if it's a concern. BegrudginglyWe were give two more rolls (cold lol) and no extra butter...stingy with the butter how ironic. After having paid a very large dinner bill, and looked down on for asking for a roll and given an attitude by the waiter, we still left a generous tip because I told myself maybe his wife left him that day or something...or he gets to take the extra rolls home and doesn't like giving them away? Who knows...I don't think I'll be going back for a third chance.",2,1,2,K D.,"New York, NY",1,70,5
1.0,1/8/2019,"This restaurant is gross. I was recommended by a friend to visit the restaurant. I went to lunch there. Not only was the waiter rude, the one that switched with the original waiter, but there was a fly in my latte at the end of the lunch. The waiter brought the bill at the end after we told him and he did not even apologize or mention that he had removed the latte from the bill. He simply let the bill fall from his hands on the table as if he could care less because he just came in for his shift. I will never be returning to this ""fancy"" restaurant and I will never recommend it to anyone. Our entire meal should have been free and someone should have acknowledged the fact that we told them a fly flew into our drink. They simply removed the drink, no apology nothing, and removed it from our bill. This is not hospitality. This place is a rip off. Beware!",0,1,0,Gabriela P.,"New York, NY",275,39,128
2.0,1/3/2019,"The food lived up to our very high expectations. Iron Chef Guarnaschelli was not in house when we were there on 1/2/19. The only drawback regarding the food was that the dinner rolls were served cold and had apparently spent too much time in the oven because they were dusty dry. I told my husband that if these rolls were served to Alex she would have sent them back. We ate them anyways because the butters were so delicious. My husband saw fresh bread come out of the oven and had to ask three times for more bread before we received it. Our service left MUCH to be desired unfortunately. We almost left a few times but really wanted to try the food. We asked our waiter if he could tell us about the specials. He did give us the special menu ahead of time. He said, ""The spaghetti comes with tomato sauce and the Beef Wellington is well, Beef Wellington"". My husband ordered a bottle of French red wine (Lou Fréjau 2010) and our waiter struggled to open the bottle. He then quickly put his captain's knife in his apron pocket with the cork and didn't present the cork. I asked him to present the cork as is customary and he said ""I know"". He was so snarky that we almost left without ordering dinner. The cork was fine and the wine was great but it took at least 30 minutes for us to get the wine after it was ordered. We had the Gnocchi ""Mac"" and cheese for an appetizer. We've seen Alex be a really tough judge on gnocchi and the gnocchi was soft and pillowy like we have heard her describe how it should be. Every drop of the cheese sauce was savored. I ordered the double cut tobacco smoked frenched pork chop. When we were at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill in Las Vegas I ordered a steak and my husband ordered Bobby's pork chop. Both were fantastic but the pork chop was heavenly and my husband was so kind as to trade entrees with me so I could eat the pork chop. I wasn't about to make that mistake twice so I was sure to order the pork chop at Butter. It was so good with the smashed black eyed peas that it melted in my mouth and I enjoyed it again for dinner tonight because of the leftovers. My husband ordered the Branzino and hoped it would be as good as the Branzino he had at Giada's. It was perfect! The skin was crispy and he ate every bite. The spinach it came with had a bold lemon flavor that was surprisingly fresh and paired perfectly with the fish. This lemon sauce has peaked our curiosity as to how we can try to recreate it when our Meyer lemon tree is in season again. That lemon sauce was to die for!We just rolled with the service because it seemed less important because the food was so amazing. After dinner my husband ordered an espresso and a shot of Sambuca. The espresso came with cream in it and the Sambuca had four espresso beans in it. I ordered a regular coffee with a shot of Bailey's without whipped cream. It came in a regular porcelain coffee cup with cream and sugar on the side as well as the shot on the side. We also ordered desserts to go and got the chop and spinach wrapped up. My husband ordered the chocolate pinwheel that he ate every bite of today. I ordered the peanut butter chocolate bar and it was out of this world. The food lived up to and exceeded our wildest expectations. I went to the bathroom twice and used two different restrooms. Both were dirty especially the floors. The first bathroom didn't even have toilet paper on the roll and the holder was in pieces on the floor. I actually picked it up, reassembled it and placed a new roll on it before I left. I've never met Alex before but feel like I know her. She is our favorite chef because she is a stickler for getting all of the details perfect and she is fiercely competitive. I was embarrassed that her restrooms were so filthy and believed that she would be mortified had she seen the condition of the restrooms or had been on the receiving end of the service we had. My husband and I enjoyed the food immensely but found the service to be pedestrian at best like what one might expect from a chain restaurant. Maybe because Alex wasn't there the staff took certain shortcuts that they wouldn't do had she been there or maybe it's always like this, I don't know.  What I do know is that there seems to be a kitchen with the highest of standards paired with management of staff with little to no standards. If I could give two ratings for Butter I would give five red stars for the food and one yellow star for the restaurant staff management. Our palates were pleased but we were disappointed with the lack of front end professionalism.We've eaten at some of the best restaurants in the country including several iron chef or celebrity chef owned restaurants.

5.0,12/29/2018,"Super Delicious! Had a reservation. Got there over an hour early. Not a problem! They sat us right away and there was a nice size crowd so that was really cool. Sat down. The waitress was very personable and gave us some recommendations; most of which we wound up ordering. Everything on the cocktail list sounded delicious but honestly the food was so good I almost forgot that we had one. ""To Beet or Not to Beet"" Really good but that was totally overshadowed by what happened next. The Iron Chef herself, Alex Guarnaschelli came walking on by! Considering the whole reason we went there was because I'm such a big fan of hers on Food Network, this was a big deal! We said hello and she stopped to talk to us. She was super cool and meeting her really made our night. I also want to mention that she recommended almost the exact same things our waitress did. They were both totally right! For appetizers we ordered the Steak Tare Tare w/ Cured  Egg Yolk (crazy fresh meat, cured egg added a great salty contrast without being as drippy as a fresh one, really delicious) and The Gnocchi Mac & Cheese (think amazing classic m&c filled with perfect airy lil potato pillows). Just when we thought we were done, the waiter came over with a plate of Veal Bacon, compliments of the chef! Whattttt! That was the other app we were thinking of getting. It was fantastic! So many flavors going on at once, I wasn't even mad that a piece of it was stuck in my tooth the rest of the night. Next came the Entrees. Squid Ink Pasta w/ Octopus (every component was dope, the pasta tasted house made and was cooked to the tooth, tender octopus with a great char, and a sauce I can't even describe but went so well) and The Tobacco Smoked Pork Chop (Holy S**t I've never had a chop so moist in my entire life! I'm going to go out on a limb and say no one has. This chop was the truth! The char of the grill and the spice blend on the pork blended together to form an outside crust so flavorful that you tasted it through every bite without loosing any of the natural pork taste. Incredible.) We finished up and decided we had to get desert. We went with the Raspberry Beignets w/ Vanilla Cream (think 3 crazy delicious jelly donuts with a side of melted vanilla ice cream, just like everything here it was bangin) This place was great and we had an amazing meal. I really don't have a bad thing to say about it and if you took the time to read this whole review you should just put down the phone and go already.",0,0,0,Mike L.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",0,3,0
2.0,12/28/2018,"This was an underwhelming experience. I went to have lunch with a friend. He ordered the pre-fixe lunch and the wrong appetizer was brought out. It took about 10 minutes to correct the error. We ordered coffee and it came out cold. I ordered a burger off the menu, which came out medium rare, which is not how I like my burgers. The waiter never asked me about my meat temperature preference and I did not think it would come out that rare. I was not able to finish the burger. Our waiter never came to check on us in a timely manner during the meal and we were not taken care of, or at least I wasn't. I ordered sparkling water. The waiter brought two glasses out even though my friend did not ask for any. I asked for more and it never came out. The restaurant was not busy at all so I don't know why the service was so sub par and then it dawned on me that maybe the waiter was being dismissive to me alone. At the beginning of the meal my friend mentioned to me that I could have his key lime pie as part of the pre-fixe meal(the pie was the best part of the meal but it was also a ridiculously small piece) but he insisted on handing the check to my friend, even though I had given him my credit card. The waiter was attentive to my male friend's needs but not to mine. The food quality was mediocre for the price and the service made this experience not worth it at all.

3.0,12/10/2018,"Recently had lunch at Butter during a trip to NYC. It was the dinner menu I glanced at that brought me in, but our visit was timed for lunch.  I didn't get to taste the burrata salad I wanted, but we had a fine experience all the same. The atmosphere is beautiful inside. Well lit, designed and decorated, plus surprisingly spacious-- I was impressed considering most NYC restaurants are tight spaces with little privacy between tables.  The cocktails we had were fantastic, albeit pricey. Then again, cost comes with the territory. My friend and I ordered Caesar salads, one with shrimp, one with chicken. They were fine. Again-- bummer about missing out on the burrata, which was only available at dinner.  The proteins were tender and flavorful but the dressing, which appeared to have a pesto base, was a little bland.  There was a lunch special going on for a three course meal, but I really didn't want anything heavy before walking around the city.  My mistake. On retrospect, I should have opted for the special. Our somewhat boring salads left us wanting something more.  Although it wasn't a part of the original plan,  we ultimately ordered dessert. Do not come in without trying the raspberry beignets.  They were delicious and the highlight of our meal. The service was fine, timely, friendly enough.

3.0,11/23/2018,"It seems that I am not the only one to be let down by the contrast of my expectations of this place vs the reality.  As many do, I enjoy Alex Guarnaschelli on Chopped and follow her on Instagram and have seen many of Butter's dishes before I ever walked in the door.  But the experience, from start to finish, is of a business coasting on reputation, with no attentiveness to the details.  It's the little things that bring people back to a restaurant after reputation brings them there the first time.My friend and I arrived 10 minutes early for our reservation, and we didn't expect to be seated right away, but almost 20 minutes past our reservation time, engrossed in conversation on the plush couches in the waiting area, I motioned to the employee in charge of coat check and checkin.  She came over a few minutes later, ""Were you motioning at me?""  ""Yes, when can we be seated?""  We were seated a few minutes later, with no apology for the wait, or for the fact that I had to be proactive about it.We ordered five dishes to split between the two of us.  The cavatappi, the gnocchi, the kale, the brussels sprout cooked/raw salad, and the veal bacon.  Far and away the veal bacon and brussels sprouts were the best dishes, with the gnocchi and kale being just okay.  The cavatappi was so flavorful, but was set back by an uneven cook on the pasta, some of which was almost crunchy.  When I mentioned this at the end of my meal to the waitress she breezily said, ""yeah, we were really slammed tonight,"" as if speaking to a colleague, not a customer.  ""I'll pass it along.""  My exact words before this were, ""It was such a wonderful, flavorful dish: it was confusing to have an uneven cook on the pasta, and that ruined it a bit.""  Her own serving performance was phoned in, stopping in for seconds at a time while she attended to (too many?) other tables.At almost $115 for those dishes and a couple drinks, you need to get the little things right to get another visit.  Instead, you get a detailed review and disappointment.  Had I not high expectations, perhaps I would have been okay with average, even at that price.  But I'll never return, not even for those dreamy raspberry beignets with the vanilla dipping sauce.  In part because I don't think the management team even bothers to read these reviews.  But I'm sure there are legions of those who, like me, will be ready to be fooled at least once in the future, ensuring full tables at the restaurant.",5,0,0,Stephen H.,"Paris, France",714,2590,92

I had never heard of it, but my friend mentioned it was Alex G's restaurant which instantly got me excited as well. It being Sunday brunch - they did have a menu up indicating it was brunch buffet only - and the price - NOT BAD for NYC at $40. We decided to go for it. They opened at 11AM however we were not sure if they were actually open, it was really dark inside, but the door did open and we walked in and went downstairs immediately - the restaurant has a very dark cozy ambience and even at brunch it's no different (the restaurant part is underground so no windows, but there is a 2nd floor outdoor terrace/dining area). I see lots of people mentioning brunch at $40 is expensive, but to us - we thought it was pretty reasonable. It's AYCE, in NYC, brunch and it's Alex G's restaurant. The food consists of a few baked goods - muffins, scones, donuts, fresh fruit, french toast/brioche, wilted spinach, hanger steak (OMG SO AMAZING), shrimp  and grits, salad, smoked samon, eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, potato cakes... and maybe a few more things - but i can't remember. The hanger steak was amazing - to be honest - a plate of that was worth the $40 alone. They had these tiny (half size) banana muffins that i was obsessed with as well - i ate 3! The wilted spinach was really good as well, nice and fresh - the grits and shrimp - my only complaint was that it was pretty watered down - i thought it should be a bit thicker and with no spoon, it was difficult to eat with a fork also the haystack potato things were a bit dry and greasy all at once, so i'd pass next time. But we enjoyed our experience - there wasn't a wait but a constant stream of people coming in. I'm glad we got there early. We didn't order drinks but cocktails looked to be in the $15 range.

Though we weren't able to see the menu ahead of time, we weren't disappointed with the options we were given. My friend and I got the Long Island fluke carpaccio for our appetizer - some of the freshest fish we have tried! The sauces were amazing and really complemented the fish brining out its sweetness though the fried bits of rice on top were soggy so the crunchiness that was supposed to balance the dish wasn't there. I ordered the cavatappi pasta which came with spicy lamb sausage and tomato sauce. The first few bites were amazing! It was a hearty dish with spices that worked well, but after that it became a bit too greasy and heavy. The lamb sausage was pretty spicy which added to the heaviness of the dish. Not sure why the pasta was plated in a bowl that reminded me eating leftovers at home rather than at a fine dining restaurant. My friend ordered the Long Island bass and it was cooked to perfection! Perfectly crisp skin and tender meat, you could taste how fresh the fish was and the sauce that came it highlighted the freshness of the fish rather than overpower it. The portion size was really small though and was finished in 3-4 bites.Our dining experience definitely wasn't as amazing as we expected it to be, but the quality of the food and ingredients was definitely shown.",3,0,0,Minna C.,"New York, NY",511,200,570

1.0,10/6/2018,"Late review.... doesn't matter. Went to Butter in July with my mother, sister, and sister's boyfriend to celebrate my mother's birthday. If I could have given this restaurant a zero I would've. 0. Absolutely awful. The service? Unimaginable! Watched the tables all around us get fresh bread and butter... while we basically had to beg my rude waiter to bring us over some. We tried the ""watermelon salad"" and I don't even know what to say. It was cubes of watermelon with a tomato on top?!?!? Some pairing..... right. Then also ordered lobster ravioli which came with 3 ravioli for what was about $30.... worth about $3. After being highly disappointed in the appetizers and horrible service, dinner barely just made up for it. Thank god for that. Best thing was the bread and butter... too bad you have to beg. Awful food and awful service. We love chef Guarnaschelli.... but to tie your name to and plaster it all over the restaurant as a professional chef only for the food to be mediocre and the service be horrible is embarrassing and disheartening. Mind you we spent close to $500. Will never go back.",0,2,0,Jacqueline I.,"Holbrook, NY",0,4,0
4.0,10/6/2018,"Came here for lunch on a Friday. We were served bread with a yummy / unique butter that wasn't described to us and was a very small portion. Bread was very very good though.My coworker and I both opted for the pre fixe lunch option ($35). We both chose soup for our appetizer - I tried the cold cucumber soup with lemon and olive oil, she had the corn chowder with shrimp and grilled corn. The cold soup was interesting - a unique option. I did not love it but it was decent for what it was. The corn chowder was creamy as expected.We both ordered the butter burger which is definitely the way to go. It's served with lettuce, heirloom tomato, and a special cheese fondu. It's served with fries (including some potato skins) and pickles. Great burger - would definitely order again.Finally we ended our meal with dessert. I had key lime pie which was the perfect lunch dessert size and very good.

3.0,9/12/2018,"I was looking forward to trying Butter, given that I am a fan of Alex G, and was willing to risk the less than stellar reviews.  I wish i could say the negative reviews were wrong, but i am reaching on the 3 star.   The food is a solid 3, I found that I really enjoyed some of it and some of it was just unmemorable.  My favorite parts of the meal were the bread and butter that you got at the beginning and the steak tartare which I ordered as my meal.  The steak tartare had a great creamy butter like taste as the accompanying base of the crostini.  The bread they serve before the meal, nice and hot, crusty and had a perfect salt seasoning.  The rest of the meal was just nothing special, the food wasn't horrible, but it wasn't exciting.The service here is what I would rate as a 2. After the hostess showed us the table I noticed that there was dripping water from above , when I went back up to the host stand to ask to move she seemed confused. Ultimately we were re-seated, so we stayed dry.  Our server was not great. We went long periods of time without seeing him. We asked to start with a shared pasta and then individually follow up with a salad and steak tartare as our mains. All of the food came out at one time.  He took our drink and food order and we didn't see him again until our plates had been cleared. We ordered dessert and he disappeared again. As we were waiting for the bill he came back and asked us if we wanted dessert, which of course we had already had about a half an hour ago.

Then we got the salmon and the eggplant ravioli- both were spicier than expected but still good. The desserts we had were biscotti, brownies, and eclairs.

4.0,9/4/2018,"Here is the 3-1-1: Food: As the current Iron Chef, Alex did not disappoint. Started off the with tuna tartare which sounds generic but what made it out stand out were the precision knife cuts of tender sashimi grade ahi tuna and miniscule pepper bits throughout each bite and accompanied but silky slices of avocado. The other appetizer was fluke carpaccio which was fresh and bright with small puffed rice that provided a contrast of texture between soft & crunchy. For the entrees, the zucchini noodles can stand up to any fresh pasta and the name of the restaurant can be found in that one dish. The other entrée of long island bass over escarole was a perfectly seared piece of fish over a flavor punch of sauté escarole that made each bite so savory; the only issue was that there were a couple of scales that were missed. For dessert the lemon cake with blueberry jam was a final touch to a great lunch; moist, bright and decadent.Service: Great service and super friendly staff but could have provided more details on each dish when they were served. Ambiance: Modern feel with a hip vibe and during lunch the natural lighting that comes through the sun roof makes you feel at home.",0,0,0,Irwan A.,"South San Francisco, CA",39,136,88

Service was A+ as our waiter was extremely attentive to everything we needed and then some. We had the NY Strip which was simply amazing and my friend chose the lamb as her main course. Appetizers were quite good as well - she chose the gnocchi Mac and cheese which our server said was a top favorite and it did not disappoint. I chose the raw oysters which, while a tad pricey, we're absolutely delicious. Drinks were good - we shared a cocktail designed for two and I had an additional one which was a spin off of an old fashioned.

4.0,8/28/2018,"(Please note that this was a business lunch and I didn't pay for it) Went in a group of 6 this afternoon, and were happy to escape the hot NYC heat when we entered the restaurant. You have to go down a flight of stairs from the entrance (the door across is to enter the hotel). We were seated immediately and our server was attentive and checked in a few times all throughout our meal. Started off with a cocktail called the Purple Paradise (for two). It usually comes in a pinapple chalice, but I split it with a coworker so we just got it in two separate glasses. Have to say I wasn't impressed for the price point of $36. It was too tart, and didn't even leave me with a buzz! Lol. Another coworker got the Beet It or Not and really liked it, so I'd probably go with that next time. Vegetarians, there are some great options! I tasted two of the starters: Globe artichoke hearts- not as tasty as I hoped they would be. The heart was a little tough and should have been soft/melt in your mouthChiogga beet and sour cream dip with crackers- pretty presentation but they only had three crackers for a whole bowl of dip. I actually liked this one but others described it as ""interesting"" lol. It has a sweet taste from the beet dip and salty taste from the crackers with the goat cheese. For the main, I was debating between the zucchini noodles and the eggplant parm, but ended up going with the parm per the server's recommendation. It comes in a huge beefsteak tomato that is stuffed with mozzarella and very thin eggplant parm. Loved it! I'm not a huge fan of eating big pieces of tomatoes but this was juicy and delicious! I thought I wasn't full when I finished it, but then it hit me and it was a pleasant fullness of eating just enough. For desserts, we ordered two items:Raspberry beignets- OMG get these. They're a little smaller than regular jelly doughnuts. Warm and fluffy and the vanilla dipping sauce was just the best. Lemon olive oil cake- errr. Dry. That's all I have. Was not good.

The Branzino fillet was actually pretty good, the side of potatoes was under-cooked and I should have sent them back.  Likewise the kale gratin was almost all sauce and cheese with little kale.

The waitress asked if we were going to see a show, we were, so she made sure that dinner was timed properly so that we could arrive at the show on time. Our appetizers were the Gnocchi Mac and Cheese, Veal Bacon, and Foie Gras. Each of the three appetizers was delicious. The gnocchi was creamy and delicious; the bacon had a yummy mustard sauce; the foie gras was warm on toasted bread.. I ordered the halibut for my main course and my wife and daughter ordered the Tomahawk steak for two. The halibut was over grits with corn and was plentiful and yummy. The Tomahawk steak looked like it was something served to the Flintstones. It was huge and perfectly cooked to medium rare. It was tender with a delicious crust. We were stuffed when we left. I'm not sure why other reviews said that the food was skimpy, it wasn't, and we left quite happy. The noise in the restaurant was fine. We were able to have a conversation with no problem.

I had a reservation we were seated immediately, I have to say the service here is absolutely amazing and what people really want to encounter when dining out. After reviewing the menu we opted to order items of the regular menu. The bread is so delicous, it was crispy and buttery. We started with the salad special for the evening which was lettuce in a nice citrus dressing, I had the White cloud cauliflower and my husband had the pork chop. My dish was interesting and tasty. As good option if you don't want to eat meat, I found it very filling. My husband loved his pork chop and he is usually not a big fan. He finished his meal with the beignets and they we're delicious, the texture of the dough and the raspberry fill was perfect. It's difficult to share.

5.0,8/1/2018,"We highly anticipated dining at Butter because we are huge Guarnaschelli fans. Iron Chef Alex did not disappoint! We started with the Cavatappi with spicy lamb sausage and the gnocchi Mac and cheese. Both were rich and decadent. We agreed that the cavatappi was better and loved the cheesy flavor with the spicy bite from the sausage. For our entrees we ordered the strip steak medium rare and the pork chops. The steak was decadent and had delicious tarragon mushrooms on top. I don't normally love mushrooms, but these were slightly crispy and paired well with the steak--so delicious. The pork chop was extremely moist and had a smoky sauce with roasted peach topping that we both enjoyed. Finally, for dessert we settled with the lemon panna cotta with a blackberry jam cassis and the raspberry beignets with a vanilla dipping sauce. We would highly recommend the panna cotta if you are looking for something simple and light. The beignets were airy and incredible. The raspberry filling was absolutely delectable. The ambiance was industrial yet cozy. We came from out of town so we were an hour early and they were able to seat us immediately which was unexpected and great.

The croquettes were crispy and had a wonderful flavor. The short rib was unbelievable--the meat was tender and cooked to absolute perfection. Alex was in house and was kind enough to have a quick cat with our table, then sent out a special addition to our meal. If I'm being honest, I can't quite recall what it was called but I believe it was some kind of artichoke with a mixture of veggies and it was truly divine.

2.0,8/1/2018,"Allow me to preface this review by saying it pains me to give it only 2 stars as I historically LOVE Butter, well specifically the DT (now closed location) - the food/ambiance/drinks were consistently on point. My hubs booked a spot for Friday eve for my bday din (there were 4 of us.) I was ok with his choice as we'd frequented the other location enough times to know that a wonderful bday din experience was sure to be had. I like the décor and the general vibe which was solid/on point, but the service was nothing above 'meh.' Actually our initial waiter ended his shift 10 min after he started, (something weird happened) so another random woman took his spot. We ordered a bottle of wine and some cocktails, and those eventually arrived. The wine was fine, but the waitress literally stopped by maybe 3 times during our 2.5 hr din- our friends went up to the bar to order another drink bc she rarely graced us with her presence. Could've been a rookie waiter mistake, but whatever... Moving on to the food. The bread was delicious and consistent which I applaud, but that's about all that was delicious and consistent before our entrees arrived.  Let's discuss the poached shrimp app--WTF is that? I felt like the chef dipped shrimp cocktail in mayo, added a few peppercorns, and linked the shrimp together (looked like they were weirdly hugging.) No thanks. For $18  I could've walked to Red Lobster in Times Square and ordered the popcorn shrimp platter that would've knocked those poach weirdos out of the park. Fact. Next we ordered the burrata. It was fine, but I can buy a tastier burrata from Whole Foods and add some basil and balsamic drizzle that would rival this plate. We followed up with the veal ""bacon"" which was straight up dried BBQ. Pass. The pre-entrée theme ""underwhelming."" Moving on to entrees, I will give props where they're do and my husband and friend ordered the Tomahwak steak for 2; that was the BEST GD steak I've tasted! It literally melted in my mouth. So, kudos to the chef on that one. They also ordered the goat cheese grits, and good lord, those were tasty too. My friend and I both ordered the halibut and it was...just halibut. Not bad at all- cooked fine, flavors married nicely, but nothing impressive or memorable. We ordered dessert too, but I honestly don't remember (and I wasn't drunk bc the waitress never stopped by to sell us another bottle of wine...) so unfortunately, it wasn't memorable either.

2.0,7/28/2018,"We stopped in yesterday (actually trekked all the way down) for Restaurant Week. My hubby loves to try new places and a modest prix fixe is an easy choice.After perusing the limited Restaurant Week menu we decided to order from the regular menu which is also pretty small. Which I can appreciate. Pick a few things you can knock out of the park and focus on them.Hubby ordered their 2018 Blah-blah-blah Award Winning Burger ($24) and, after perusing the two vegetarian options I chose the Stuffed Tomato with Eggplant Parm ($21).The service was good if a little brisk (we did sit down an hour before their lunch-dinner break). About half the tables were filled and the space is nice if a little dim for lunchtime.Food...Hubby's burger arrived perfectly cooked (med-rare) with a side of well-crisped fries. The caramelized onions had highly-peppered bacon added which created a little heat and he liked it. The roll was nice. Enjoyable.The stuffed tomato. Where do I start? Let's start with the good: it was perfectly cooked and not mushy. After removing the ridiculously included core I began prying the tomato open. There was a lot of bread crumbs. Lots. About half a tomato full of bread crumbs sitting atop a circle of fresh mozzarella and two tiny (1/2"" x 1"" x 1/8"") specks of breaded eggplant all nestled in a puddle of thin pesto. It looked and felt like a culinary school first attempt at the dish. No textural differences, no spice, no acid. Just a bland tomato served on a dish too small to dissect it. After 4 or 5 bites the mass looked like an alien autopsy - and insufficiently tasty to warrant further inspection. I wonder how many of the tomatoes are returned half-eaten?Seriously, though, a stuffed tomato is easy to do. If you can't hit it out of the park don't plate it.",0,0,0,Frank D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,25,5

I am sure multiple people have made similar comments but if it wasn't for the show, I'm not sure if I'd even know this place existed.The restaurant was a bit dark but romantic and was crowded from when we entered to exiting. My friend and I split the Purple Paradise which is a bit deceiving. It's a beautifully crafted cocktail with flowers in a big pineapple cup. However, it does not look like it tastes. This isn't a bad thing, just a bit more sour than sweet. For the appetizer, I had the crispy ham and pecorino croquettes. They were delicious. They may have been better than my dinner, the Korean Style beef short ribs. The rib plate was a bit small but you have to expect that during restaurant week.My favorite was the dessert, the flourless, dark chocolate, hazelnut torte. Tastes very similar to a Ferrero Rocher.

2.0,7/26/2018,"Stellar food, but the service was incredibly poor.Our reservation was at 9pm, but we were running early so we went anyway knowing we have to wait and nurse a drink at the bar. As expected, we were told to wait at the bar. The bar was 30% full and the restaurant was about 50% on a Friday night. We waited 25 minutes for our first drink. In that 25 minutes we received 2 apologies from the bar back (we saw him ""nudge"" the bar tender to acknowledge us twice) and ultimately the restaurant bar tender ""Edder"" helped us. He was amazing and totally picked up where other guy was failing. After being there an hour, the primary bar tender acknowledged us, after serving his 3 preferred clients 2 rounds. Our reservation time came and went so we touched base with the hostess. (The restaurant still no where near capacity). It seemed as though we had refreshed her memory that we were waiting . At that point we were fairly quickly seated. Our waiter started out great and the food was stellar. I have to say, the halibut is some of the best I have had. Then the service fell off again. After we ate our main, our intension was to order dessert and coffee, but our waiter literally disappeared. 30 + minutes went by after completing our meal and we literally set a credit card on the table and started to waive a napkin in efforts of gaining a severs attention (rude, I know, but we felt completely abandoned). We decide to pass on dessert and cut our losses. Ultimately, the food was outstanding  but the service was incredibly poor (with exception of Edder who clearly cared more about getting this customers taken care of more so than the rest of the staff).

3.0,7/21/2018,"This place can best be summed up as average. I picked this restaurant in a last minute time crunch with a friend coming into town. I needed something near the theater district and this was close enough, but we would've been better off stopping at Sweetgreen or something instead. Nothing here is terrible by any means, but nothing is really anything super special either. They start you off with a few rolls. They looked really promising but were very dry. We then ordered the Foie Gras and the Burrata as appetizers. The foie gras was okay, but the competing flavors of the extreme saltiness of the foie gras and the overwhelming sweetness of the strawberries got a bit much after one bite. For entrees we ordered the mac & cheese, strip steak, branzino, and halibut. The steak and branzino were very good, but again nothing super creative or amazing like you'd expect from a restaurant at this price point. The halibut was extremely flavorless and quite the disappointment. We also ordered a side of roasted carrots. Fine, but they came it room temperature which was very weird. Also ordered the Kale Gratin, which was not executed well-- as the kale got mashed into the cheese and it basically just came out as a big scoop of cheese on your plate with barely any greens. Overall the food was fine, but we left feeling a bit irked when comparing our mediocre level of satisfaction with the large bill we had.",3,0,0,Alex W.,"Boise, ID",20,252,466

1.0,7/8/2018,"Came here a year ago and it was fun. Today it was not. The menu was boring (not as much fun as what they showed us online) and the service was disinterested, at best. I ordered the NY Strip thinking it'd be a reliable choice (EVERY restaurant does this well, right?!) but I regret it. They found a way to blow it. The medium rare was correct but the meat, itself, was tough and chewy - an unforgivable sin for a $50 steak. An odd note was the steak knife. It was cheap, stamped steel trash and cut worse than the butter knife! I switched utensils after two jaw-intensive bites and never looked back.Part of me wants to say, ""Maybe it was an off night,"" but here's the thing: Manhattan is a foodie paradise where incredible food is available all over. When you pay a lot, you are paying for the *guarantee* of excellence and I am delighted to do so. But with price comes responsibility. When your patrons *are* paying for excellence, it is expected every time and competence is absolutely madatory. Simply put, your restaurant is only as good as the worst night's experience of any of its patrons.I've read plenty on here about the staff (clearly management is a little too comfortable trading on Alex Guarnaschelli's name to make a serious attempt at consistent service to her fans) but that's somewhat subjective. Who knows what really gappened when you're reading a review? But the food? The steak was genuinely bad. Just a bad cut of meat. The other 3 people I ate with liked the bread (the bread was good!) but that was about it. A memorable paycheck for a disappointing night.Put simply, if you go to Butter, you're rolling the dice. You may have an acceptable experience for the money you pay; you may be insulted, ignored, condescended to, and you may have a bored, inconvenienced wait staff serve you food any chain steakhouse's cook can beat.I'm not a gambler and that's why I can't in good conscience recommend this restaurant.

2.0,7/8/2018,"AVOID!!!!!! My mother in law recently took me, my girlfriend and her sister out for dinner for her birthday. We live on Long Island and traveled over a hour to experience this restaurant. We chose this restaurant because Alex guarnaschelli is a wonderful chef on the food network and owns this restaurant. Needless to say this place is a disaster and it not worth attending whatsoever. We were seated close to our reservation time only to wait for 15min for a waiter to even come over. The waiter then proceeded to tell us there were no specials and that there is a problem with the pipes so there no beer on tap can be purchased. We then told him it was my mother in laws birthday and he did not give us the time of day. He said happy birthday under his breath and walked away. We then had to get the attention of a bus boy to even bring us bread because another 15min had past with no bread. When we finally ordered appetizers (4 of them) they were DISGUSTING, SMALL, and OVERPRICED. An example of this was a Lobster ravioli dish that cost 30 dollars. We were given 3 small raviolis that made me want to vomit. 3 RAVIOLIS!!! That's 10 dollars per disgusting ravioli. The only reason I am giving 2 stars is Because the tomohawk steak I received was delicious. This was some of the worst service I have ever seen and most over priced food I have ordered.

The fish was served skin up so as not to allow it to grow soggy I'm sure, and yet with its practicality made for a gorgeous plate. It came served over a light puree which reminded me of polenta (if only I could remember what it was exactly). The simplicity of the dish, I would guess, is what made it so superb.

Granted, we didn't have reservations but we figured that during the middle of the week it wouldn't be too busy. When we walked into the restaurant there were many open tables. There were two ladies at the hostess stand. The first one asked if we had a reservation, when I stated no, she grabbed a menu, said ok, and the second lady gave me and my coworker the once over and said, well, actually our next open reservation is at 8:15 pm (which was about an hour from the time we got there). The same one then said you guys can try the bar, there's space there and it's full service. Well, there was not one seat available at the bar. But as we were walking back there were at least 6-7 open tables. But you didn't have any available space? It was the most odd, bogus, and relatively upsetting. How does one hostess all but offer to seat you at a table and the other deny you? Just because I was not dressed to the nines? Because I was wearing black scrubs?

2.0,6/10/2018,Alex Guarnaschelli is one of my favorite celebrity chefs which is what brought me here. The decor is a warm ranch style with dark wood. Unfortunately the food didn't meet our expectations. The bread looked delicious but served room temp and wasn't as good as being right out of the oven. They were served with plain butter which was better and one with the green stuff in it. I couldn't taste/smell it what it was. Salmon tartar was one of the specials of the day but it was fishy and we didn't finish it even though the portion size was small. Gnocchi Mac and cheese looked delicious in photos but was a soup with gummy gnocchi at the bottom. The foie gras toast was okay but the bread had a flowery flavor which I didn't enjoy. The brussel sprout salad was my favorite dish which we found out is seasonal so won't be in the menu much longer. Soft shell crab special was the second best dish but the corn meal breading was too strong a flavor for the crab. The bacon was corned and topped with a very tart sauce. Raviolo was on the website but not on the menu and replaced with lobster ravioli. I was really looking forward to trying that. Service was professional and helpful with suggestions but not friendly.

3.0,6/8/2018,"Group dinner before a show! Very upscale restaurant and lovely fine dining. The hot, fluffy, complimentary bread and the homemade butter were delicious (bread was similar to a Filipino bread called Pan de Sal). The plates were smaller portions but that was to be expected. For my meal I had the Tangerine-Glazed Duck Thighs, very crispy- I enjoyed it! Since we we got there at the start of dinner service, the restaurant only had a few other guests besides our group of 7. Even still, service was a bit long as our server disappeared often. It was a fancy meal with a fancy pricetag, and appropriate for the occasion..... however, I felt there wasn't that many meal options and the service wasn't that great.",0,0,0,Jenny M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",26,84,8

My boss told me I should send it back, but I didn't want to go through the hassle. *Shrug* Also, for $9, I wish they gave me more fries. But this seems to be the pattern at all of these NYC restaurants - as far as with their ""side portions"" being small. Other than that, the bread was tasty and the service was quick.

4.0,6/7/2018,"I love butter...the stuff and usually this restaurant. In midtown Manhattan, I'd have told you it's my favorite. It's wide open, high-ceiling, mostly booth dining room featuring warm wood, dark floors and nature scene photography on the walls, is warm, inviting and at once elegant but casual. The bar features inventive mixology. The menu is new American - not quite comfort, not quite Southern, not quite Michelin. But to die for. They are dishes you can pronounce, but preparations that surprise and delight. The wine list is nice - something for tourists and expense accounters all with unusual finds and reasonable mark-ups. In several visits, everything has been consistently great...but the service. If Butter could realize that they are in the service business, and that eventually people will tire of coming and being treated poorly, they will thrive. Otherwise, they will be remembered as yet another place that had great food that we all wish could come back again. On my most recent visit, I was treated to repeated texts from the hostess promising to give my table away if I wasn't there within ten minutes of my reservation. Once would have sufficed. Upon being seated, it was clear we were our server's last table, and that she had plans. Bitchy does not even begin to describe the attitude we received when it became clear that we did not share her sense of urgency. Butter is a high-end establishment. It does not benefit from low-end help. Overall, I love this place - for the room and the food. I hate it for the people they hire. If you can stand two hours of great food served by not so great people, Butter is for you. I can. It's why I go back.",0,0,0,Phillip K.,"Akron, OH",0,10,3

I loved the decor - clean lines, modern with a touch of rustic, perfect lighting, bit on a dark side. The room is a bit noisy maybe because the ceilings are high, but surprisingly at the table my husband and I had no problem hearing each other. The wait staff was great - polite, quick, knowledgeable. The bread rolls & butters were amazing - warm, flaky, served without us asking for bread. We also had  gnocchi mac & cheese, iceberg wedge, oven-roasted chicken, floating island and raspberry donuts - everything was perfect. The appetizers and main dishes were medium size, not really for sharing. The desserts were big - one portion of raspberry donuts had 3 good size donuts - of course i ate them all :-) and i also had some of the floating island my husband ordred. The place is good for a romantic meal or business - it's very roomy and has different settings such as small booths for a few people,  and communal tables for larger groups. Very nice bar as well.

5.0,6/2/2018,"Okay so my daughter and I have wanted come here for a long time. I was in town and decided to go even though it would be alone. I went later in the evening and it wasn't too crowded at all. I found the Decor, lighting and music to blend quite nicely to a relaxing dinner atmosphere. I've forgotten my servers name but she was outstanding. Friendly, present but not hovering, super informative and helpful. I intended to get the NY strip but the specials looked so good and with the recommendation of my great server the sea bass was my choice with a wedge salad to start. Fist off, those rolls... just come on. Is bread supposed to be that good. I considered just asking for a bunch more and getting desert. The chive butter with the soft, warm perfect rolls topped with what appears to be sea salts and somehow lightly toasted but not dry all all... that really made them perfect. The wedge was a show stopper looking like a work or art on a plate. One of the best I've ever had, really nice. Than the sea bass came atop asparagus with a lemon sauce. I was really happy with this choice. Crispy fish with really wonderful flavors and tender flaky inside, a bit of mushroom and some of Rene sauce and WOW just delightful to eat. Okay and than the dessert of strawberry shortcake. If you live your grandma don't eat this. The dessert you have always loved just with the fresh berries and cream and the home made short bread just got knocked out of the park. The sugar on top was of the short bread, the thick decadent whipped cream, fresh berries all combined to make a familiar wonderful bite but wait... what was that? Ice cold... tart... did I just get lemon? Yes I did. Inside this perfect strawberry shortcake is a layer of lemon sorbet that just pushed it over the top. So good and so satisfying.

2.0,5/22/2018,"We decided to try Butter primarily because of our expectations due to Alex Guarnaschelli being touted as the Executive Chef.  I hope they pay her a lot because having her name attached to Butter isn't going to do wonders for her reputation as a chef!We ordered the blooming onion appetizer to start.  The onion should NOT have died for this dish!  It consisted of a small, sad, sagging onion with a mediocre seasoning and sauce.  My only basis for comparison is from a chain like Outback and this didn't compare.  Similar to the onion, the ""Poached Florida Shrimp"" should not have given their lives for this dish.  The shrimp were small, dry and generally looked like a dish I'd expect in a diner, not a relatively pricey restaurant.Unlike the onion and shrimp, the gnocchi mac & cheese was tasty.  However, it consisted of about 3 spoonfuls of gnocchi in the middle of a large bowl for $18 - but at least it was good.   The lettuce for the wedge was fine - but putting lettuce on a plate for $16 doesn't require an iron chef!The ""White Cloud Cauliflower"" sounded appealing - like some great technique would be applied.  It turned out to be a semi-cooked head of cauliflower with some coconut milk drizzled on it.  It was actually ridiculous.The pan roasted chicken should also have not died for this meal.  If I want a dried out chicken breast I have no trouble making it at home.  This one was dry and slightly stringy - facts not mitigated by decent seasoning.  Butter only earned its second star because the cocktails were good as was our server.   If this is what Alex Guarnaschelli attaches her name to we will never give the same weight to her critiques on her various TV appearances!",0,0,0,Robert O.,"Monroe Township, NJ",0,85,0
2.0,5/21/2018,"I am torn on this two star rating... Everything we ate here was spectacular. The service was bad and slow and because of that the overall experience was negative. We arrived early for our 7pm reservation, probably around 6:40, and we were seated right away. Our server Freddy took our drink order, and about 15 minutes later the drinks arrived. He waited until our drinks arrived before taking our appetizer order, and waited for our appetizers to arrive before taking our dinner order. We were brought a meal we did not order, which we sent back. And we were charged for a drink that we did not have. The bill was not split properly, so we didn't notice it at the time. Although, we probably would not have sent it back to be corrected anyway, as the entire dining experience took much longer than it should have, and that more than likely would have delayed us another 20 minutes. We had plans for the evening which we had to cancel due to the length of time we spent at the restaurant. With better service, we would have either ordered more drinks, or been able to get out of there sooner. Overall, just a very bad experience.",0,0,0,Katie L.,"Winter Park, FL",5,44,0

We were only told us that after we arrived. The food was ok. Smoked Salmon and the Caesar salad, beignet were delicious but the eggs were sitting on a warmer so they were over cooked. The part that irked us the most was that they charge you 20% service charge on the bill and still have a section for tip below that. The actual credit card receipt that you sign doesn't even tell you that you've already paid for the service so if you don't read it, you would just tip additional, possibly tipping 40% without knowing it. To charge 20% service charge for buffet, self-service, I was really disappointed at the sneakiness. Also, They also told us on the phone that my toddler would not be charged but charged us 50% of the adult buffet bill even though he only had scrambled eggs and toast.Don't think I would return here sadly.

We got another table's food--a table of tourists dressed in cut offs who had kids that kept putting their feet up on the table. We have kids, I support kid friendly places but at some point you have to enforce decorum for the sake of your other patrons.

5.0,4/23/2018,"It's my 300th review! So, it's only fitting I review the fantastic meal I had at Butter on Saturday night.I didn't get to meet Alex Guarnaschelli (even though I kept peeking over my boyfriend's shoulder in the hopes that she would be there/stalking her Instagram stories to see where she was), but I like to think that she was back there, handcrafting my meal.  Even if she wasn't, her signature style is evident on the menu and made its way on to every dish we ate.Here's the lowdown:-Rolls and butter: tasty and comforting way to start the meal.  Rolls were nice and warm, soft, and flaky and came with two types of butter (one chive, one regular). Creamy and definitely handmade.-Appetizer: Burrata salad with artichokes.  SO good.  Pretty small for splitting, but we wanted to save room for our entrees and desserts anyway.  What a delicious bite of food - the dressed artichoke/raddichio slopped up with a fresh piece of the burrata was uber flavorful.-Entrees: two New York Strips, medium rare.  Served with a nice heap on top of charred hen of the woods mushrooms, juicy and crispy bacon, and a decadent slathering of herbed butter.  HOLY HELL.  Absolutely delicious.  The steak itself was also seasoned perfectly and had a great char/tasty fatty gristle on the outside.  It actually came out closer to medium (minor complaint), but it didn't even matter, since the flavors were so on point.  SUPER buttery (duh, it better be, based on the name), so throw caution to the wind on that diet when you come here. -Desserts:  Best.  Part.  Of.  The.  Meal.  Seriously.  Save room for dessert here.  First off, there were like 5 or 6 to choose from and I wanted ALL of them.  We decided to get 1 dessert each.  I got the oat milk ice cream sundae.  BF got the raspberry beignets.  Both were SUPERB, but if I had to award medals, those beignets got the gold.  Fluffy, pillowy, sugary nuggets of heaven stuffed with an oozing raspberry filling and served with some kind of gloriously shiny white dipping sauce.  Essentially, it's an elevated jelly doughnut.  And let me tell you something, I HATE jelly donuts, and I LOVED these.  If I ever crave sweets from now on, this is exactly what I'm talking about.  The ""ice cream"" sundae was a VERY close second, though.  Chilled and served in a days of yore diner-style sundae glass, drizzled in a bourbon caramel glaze and topped with oats and cocoa nibs, it was refreshing and sweet, creamy and crunchy.  Probably the most unique sundae I've had in recent past.  Also, I put ice cream in quotes because it was, in fact, entirely free of dairy, sugar and gluten.  So, those with food sensitivities, absolutely come here and try this.Plating was a good combo of highbrow fine dining and stick to your ribs comfort food, which is kind of Alex's M.O.  Ambiance was classy without being stuffy or pretentious, and had a really gorgeous/woodsy Pacific Northwest vibe.  In fact, my BF and I were a tad overdressed in his button down/slacks and my dress/heels.  Most people were dressed more business casual, although I did see the occasional jeans.We got a nice bottle of red wine for our meal, so I can't comment on their signature cocktails, but they all sounded and looked delicious.Our server was a delight.  Super personable, knowledgeable of the menu and checked in often without being annoying.  She also offered recommendations of her favorite dishes when I couldn't decide.Butter's menu seems to rotate seasonally, based on their website and the past reviews.  If I'm ever in Midtown again, I would absolutely love to return here and try all the other delicious offerings on the menu.",9,1,3,Andrea F.,"Philadelphia, PA",215,358,31

I've always loved to watch Alex Guarnaschelli cook and thought she was extremely talented, so I thought any restaurant with her influence behind it has to be great. We were sorely disappointed. The front of house staff and our waiter was great, but to say that the bread and dessert were the only two things that were good about dinner is so sad.We ordered the bloomin' onion as an appetizer which wasn't fried all the way so in between the layers you got a mouthful of uncooked batter. I had the cauliflower main course which was more steamed than roasted with an overly sweet coconut cream sauce, reminiscent of dessert. My friend got the diver scallops which were just ok. Mussels were served with it in a broth without a spoon and without having the mussels loosened from the shell, so eating the dish was a little difficult. We also got the gnocchi mac and cheese which was pretty good, but the gnocchi was slightly over cooked.Switch to dessert...the raspberry beignets were great, so thanks to the pastry chef, we got to end dinner on a good note. When our waiter had come to check on us during the meal, we told him the food was just ""ok"" which didn't spark much of an interest from him, so nothing came of that.

4.0,3/3/2018,"So let me take a minute and sit right here and tell you how my dinner at Butter Midtown went down.  Let's start with the host I made reservations for 4 at 6:30 called late Ashley made it happen at 7:15 (Star #1). We got booth seating so it was very comfortable (Star #2). Our waitress was very nice but she maybe had a few to many tables. When your going to dine at place like this where they have bus boys, runners and servers you expect things to be spot on so service could be better but wasn't bad. Now the food. Usually when me and my friends go to new places we make sure to order most of the menu. Only thing we didn't have was the pork chop and salmon. The 28 day aged tomahawk was amazing!! (Star #3) The tomahawk, gnocchi Mac and cheese and maybe the veal bacon had to be the highlight for me. The duck thighs, chicken and the ny strip take second but nothing that would make me come back for. Let's end this with some dessert. Again order everything minus the cheese and upside pineapple cake. The beignets I loved I did tell the servers not be skimpy on the raspberry sauce which she failed on but she made up for it afterwards with a complementary beignet (Star #4). The vanilla bean sauce was just really good melted vanilla ice cream. My friend were big fans of the ice cream which I thought were made well, but again nothing I would come back for. If I were to make another visit my order would look like this. App - Veal Bacon Entree -28 Day Aged TomahawkSide-Mac and Cheese Gnocci (App for side)Dessert - Beignets Your welcome.

5.0,2/27/2018,"I was so excited to come here! We booked a reservation for Saturday night. The restaurant is downstairs, and the overall ambiance is warm and cozy. The wood paneling on the walls with pictures of forests and other landscapes really helps with the relaxed vibe. There is a coat check at the front if you need it. At the start, service was a little slow. The waiter asked if I wanted any fruit with my sparkling water and disappeared for like 10 minutes for limes before even asking if we wanted additional drinks. I thought that was odd. Once we ordered drinks and an appetizer, things seemed to go smoother.   We shared the Purple Paradise which was served in a large copper pineapple. It was festive, but I preferred some of the other beverages I had. The gnocchi mac 'n cheese was fantastic! The gnocchi was tender, and the cheese sauce was amazing and smooth. I also loved the dinner rolls an inordinate amount. How do they do that? The rolls have a slight crust on the outside with a warm, pillowy center. The chive butter is great with those. I ordered the Long Island Bass with celery root puree. I don't think I've had anything like it! The celery root puree is my new favorite thing. It's so much better than something ordinary like mashed potatoes. It went very well with the fish, and I really enjoyed it! My husband got the strip steak, medium. He liked it, but he felt you lose a lot of the meat due to the amount of fat and gristle that needs to be cut out. He said the hen-of-the-woods mushrooms were really good on top. By the time dessert rolled around, we were pretty full, but I can't leave Alex Guarnaschelli's restaurant without having dessert. For some reason, the dark chocolate rum pie with maple marshmallows and whipped creme fraiche was calling my name. It was actually the perfect size and the perfect finish to an amazing meal. The pie was very smooth, and the marshmallows and creme fraiche added some nice moisture to the pie. The pie was very dense, but with dark chocolate, that's a good thing!

The waiter went back to the kitchen and to the table and the waiter was embarrassed but he said ""I have to charge you $5 for more"". I couldn't stop laughing.  Not his fault, but lets be reasonable here. If you advertise that feta is there, I should at least be able to sense it. Said I would I pay for it.

5.0,2/20/2018,"Alex Guarnaschelli ... will you marry me?  Oh wait, I'm straight.  Oh wait, I'm married!  But let me just say... Don't believe all the haters on here. I'm not sure what restaurant they were eating at, but this was definitely one of our most memorable meals in all of New York City.  And I'm picky.  First... The cocktails. I ordered an SOB, which came to the table on fire and had a very unique flavor. Sweet elderberry, but not too sweet.  After that, I ordered the bitter sling, which was poured table-side in a glass filled with smoke. Yes, the presentation was fabulous, but the drinks were also over-the-top delicious.  Then out came those famous rolls. I have made some good Parkerhouse rolls at home, but these blew my mind. They came served with a traditional butter as well as an herbed butter. Don't even mess with the regular butter in my opinion. They melted in our mouths. Perfect combination of sweet and salty. I don't know why people even compare them to those Hawaiian rolls. These are something different. They are special.  And when we took our food to go at the end of the meal, the staff even threw some extra rolls into the bag for us.  For starters, we shared a Caesar salad as well as the gnocchi. The Caesar salad made with escarole was nothing special, but definitely good. And the gnocchi was so rich and creamy.  For dinner, we ordered the New York strip with hen of the woods mushrooms as well as the Porkchop which came over a squash mixture that was anything but typical. My daughter and I couldn't even talk. We just stared at each other after every bite and kept saying ""Mmmmm"".  Now, for dessert.  We had heard so much about the beignets, that we packed up our main courses to go so that we could try them. And that was definitely not a mistake. They were cooked perfectly, with a wonderful vanilla cream sauce on the side. The warm beignet with the cold cream was a delightful combination. The only problem with this meal was that I just did not have enough room in my stomach to fit it all.  Thanks to our lovely staff, Alex and everyone in the kitchen for the fun food memories!!!",0,0,1,Stacie K.,"Gig Harbor, WA",147,99,68

For a supposedly expensive and nice restaurant, the service was insanely horrible and the food was almost as bad.We called to have our reservation pushed back to 8:45pm and they said no problem. After showing up on time, they didn't seat us for an oddly long amount of time so we got drinks by the bar, which also took a oddly long time to make despite it not being crowded at all. Once we were seated, no waiter came to greet us for a good 15 minutes despite numerous employees walking by us and we even had to ask for our water cups to be poured. Our waiter didn't apologize or explain why it took him so long to come by and offered very little recommendations on the menu except for an extremely sketchy cringe-face reaction (as if to say HELL NAH) when my friend asked about the liver appetizer. As for the food itself, everything was pretty mediocre. The clams were just alright and the salad tasted like it was made by my middle school lunch cafeteria. The catch of the day main course was meagerly in portion and consisted of some seafood drenched in a strange spicy/sweet sauce. The best part of the meal was dessert (not saying much because how can you fuck up a chocolate cake???)Overall, a horrible experience from beginning to end.

I'm not a huge liver fan, but it was really balanced. Clams: I enjoyed this, but my boyfriend did not. He felt the breadcrumb seasoning overpowered the flavor of the clams. I did enjoy it though. Wish the sauce in the middle was in a cup so you could actually put it on the clam. Individual mini pot roast: Meat was really tender and juicy. Didn't need to even use a knife. Vegetables were cooked perfectly. We both really enjoyed our meal. Chocolate rum cake: Very dry and not much flavor. Pineapple upside down cake: Delicious! Went well with the cinnamon ice cream. We also ordered off the regular menu and got:Gnocchi man cheese: I mean.... amazing as expected. Super creamy and then you get a bite of the crunchy bread crumbs. A must try if coming to Butter. Shishito peppers: Solid dish but wouldn't reorder. Tempura fried peppers was interesting, but needed more of the smoked shallot dip. That dip was the best part and there wasn't enough. Would maybe work better with peppers that were spicier or had more acidity.

Food: For a restaurant called butter, I expected the butter to be outstanding.  It was just regular butter.  They gave us a sage or onion butter too but it regular butter with some sage on it.  We did not order on the restaurant week menu and ordered regular meals.  I had the Wild Caught salmon which I requested at Medium and they did prepare it correctly.  My colleague ordered the ribeye and it was not trimmed properly.  We had a variety of appetizers and small plates to share but nothing was amazing.  The Brussels spout salad was good but it wasn't worth the cost.Service: We had reserved a large table for 15 and they told us they didn't have the reservation.  My colleague pulled up her email confirmation for the reservation and they tried to put something together quickly for us but it was disappointing that they didn't have it ready.  We ended up having to wait 45 minutes after our reservation time to be seated.  We were seated on a high table near the bar and it was so crowded, we kept getting bumped by the drunk folks behind us.  If you go, request to not be by the bar.  Our waiters were fine and we had no messed up orders.  But the bus boys were standing behind me waiting for me to finish eating to take my plate.  I had my  main course for maybe 15 minutes before they stood there.  They said they had another party coming in so we had to rush.  For some reason, its hard for me to imagine them having a table for 15 to come after 9:00 PM.  Also if you didn't seat us 45 minutes late, perhaps we could be done earlier. Price: For simple food, it was overpriced.  I would expect some exotic ingredients at the least but you are paying for the chef's name and the location.Decor: Its not a bad looking spot but the layout is odd.  The bar folks tend to take over the entire area and makes it feel more like a business restaurant than a fine dining or even casual dining restaurant.

She also forgot one of our sides which we just let pass by, but then she seemed to remember AFTER we had eaten dessert and it showed up in a to go box with our check (and on our check) and she just kind of laughed it off.To top it all off, when we were walking out the door, instead of reflecting to herself why her tip was the way it was and moving on and doing better, she was standing at the hostess stand and said loud enough for all to hear how disgusted she was that we would only tip her 15%.

1.0,1/23/2018,"I went to Butter today with a colleague for an internal meeting. It was restaurant week and their menu specials seemed somewhat appealing. Our reservations were for 12:45 on a Tuesday, we were seated right away. Our waiter cane over and brought us water and we ordered 2 ice teas. The ice teas cane 10 minutes after our waiter took our order. We ordered the 3 course meal: appetizer, meal and dessert. We noticed that it was 1:50 and our appetizer had not come out yet and our drinks were empty. I flagged down the waiter and he said that he checked on our order and it would be coming soon. I reiterated that we had already been waiting an hour for our first course. He apologized, however, not empathetic at all and was defensive. Within 10 minutes our first course came out and then our main course came out within another 10 minutes. Not one time did the waiter ask if he could get us anything or if we needed refills. Finally we asked for the check, the waiter said he would give us coffee in the house. We declined as it was now 2:30 and we were just finishing our lunch. He brought the check and said he took off the charge for the iced teas...thanks.The places wasn't overwhelmingly busy. Not to the point that we would have to wait over an hour for a soup and a salad that was already prepared.This is my second experience at Butter. The first demonstrated slow service but not like this.  I will never return here and never hold a meeting there again. I'd rather go to Gabby next door or Resette up the block.  Thanks Butter for taking 2 hours out of my busy work day.",0,0,0,Susan R.,"Queens, NY",0,30,4
1.0,1/23/2018,"Restaurant Week Winter 2018 Dinner:Food just isn't good. Service is merely for show. Somehow it manages to pull a reasonably full house of business folk diners but I'm not sure how this place survives not even considering price.For a party of 2, there are so many restaurants where I would spend under $100 and be much happier with the food.The salad is a few scatterings of baby mache with a few paper slices of mushroom. The pictures speak for itself honestly. The littleneck clams are just normal clams with overpowering garlic breadcrumbs and the sauce is a creamy mess.Squash Ravioli is pumpkin spice ravioli. It's a bit odd for the season and left me feeling sickly. Not to mention you can count the ravioli with your fingers.The pot roast was actually passable and had two big chunks of meat. Vegetables were overdone and potatoes sliced rather randomly. The name says Individual ""Mini"" ... Pot Roast and there was one individual and ironically was the biggest dish of the evening.Pineapple cake was okay, rather sweet but not good. It did come warm. As the name says, it did come ""upside down""The chocolate rum pie was impossible to eat. Good luck using a spoon, I think a knife would be more apt. It's really chocolate pudding with a rock hard crust.I took a gamble looking at past reviews and sadly it didn't pay out. For $44...

Poor service and unfortunately very mediocre food. The steak was overcooked and unevenly cooked to boot and the tartare was underwhelming.The brussel sprout salad and the gnocchi Mac and cheese were good but that was it really. All I can say about the service was that it was weird. They were trying to move us along like they might at a fast food restaurant and kept trying to clear our plates even when we weren't finished.

He looked like he didn't want to be there and I had to request everything including a desert menu. I hate having to wait forever for a drink as well. Lunches for the most part somewhat timed and a waiter should be diligent in making it an timely experience . It was my first time here and I doubt I'll be back. On another note :The walk down the stairs led to a surprisingly  beautiful restaurant ( I wasn't expecting it; didn't get to look this place up before hand) and the area for a private party was absolutely  stunning  ; just look up when you walk in , it looks like a mid roof top .For apps we ordered the calamari which I found to be flavorful but more oily than I was expecting . Additionally , I have never had such small calamari ( never ever). Another  starter we ordered was the  bacon which I didn't not like at all. The purple sauce had too much of a vinegar  taste to it and I couldn't taste the bacon at all. Now today was MLK day and I was suppose to go to Hunt and Fish but it was closed . Unfortunately left a craving for steak which couldn't  be filled here at lunch. The only option for steak was hanger steak which I didn't want so I ordered a burger which was juicy ( love that) and overall the good in flavor but not impressionable ( I was surprised based on the ingredients ) , what made me order this was that it said the burger had my a bacon jam , cheese fondue and jalapeño coleslaw ( no mayo; thank goodness).

5.0,1/11/2018,"My wife had only an hour for lunch, so we walked over to nearby Butter Midtown. The restaurant is below street level, down an open flight of stairs. It's a nice rustic space, but the lighting is kept a little dim.There were two women at the hostess stand. One was on the phone, so I asked the other for a table for two. She asked whether we had a reservation and, when I said, ""No."", she said, ""It'll be a five minute wait without a reservation."" Now, looking into the restaurant from the hostess stand, I could see that there were quite a few empty tables and the restaurant was, at best, 2/3 full. At this point, we considered heading elsewhere, but she followed up with, ""You could grab a seat at the bar immediately, if you'd like."" So, we did. It tuned out to be a good decision.There was only one bartender, but he was efficient and attentive. My wife ordered the Fish Tacos and I ordered the Long Island Bass, which I assumed was striped bass. I also ordered a negroni and, when asked whether I had a preference for the gin, I told the bartender to use what he liked; he ended up using Hendrick's and the drink was terrific.My wife's dish came with three tacos made with deep fried single corn tortillas. They were delicious; I married her, in part, because I always get to finish her food. My fish was a small skin-on filet that was pan-seared and served with chopped haricots vert (aka French green beans). While some might think the portion was small, I think it was perfect, especially for lunch. And it was delicious; so much so that I plan to replicate it at home in the near future.",3,0,1,Philip C.,"Avon, CT",0,99,107

This place was not up to that standard, IMOFood was decent, although very heavy and hearty. Even the lighter sounding dishes that I ordered seemed to be drenched in oil (the roasted carrot appetizer, grilled octopus appetizer and seared bass). My boyfriend ordered more, um, indulgent sounding items (veal bacon app, pork chop) that he said were delicious, but too heavy even for him to finish!Service was ok. The hostess was very nice and pleasant. Our server...it seemed like it was her first day. She didn't really know how to explain the menu or answer our questions. Didn't have much of a personality either and didn't check on us after our entrees came out. Although other waitstaff came around refilling waters, which was nice. We did a lot of walking and I was so thirsty!Bummer there was no chocolate dessert on the menu :( All in all, it was ok, but I won't be back.

The atmosphere is dark and very relaxing. I sat down at my table and was immediately greeted by a waiter who poured me a glass of water and got my drink order. For my appetizer I ordered the Gnocchi Mac & Cheese, and OMG it is too die for!! It's so creamy and the gnocchi just melts in your mouth. Absolutely amazing. It's priced at $18 which I thought was a little steep, but after trying it I knew it was well worth it. I was also served complimentary bread with regular and chive butter. Try both! Because they are amazing! For my main I ordered the Tobacco-Smoke Double-Cut Heritage Porkchop, and it was like nothing before. It was served on a sweet potato mash. I normally hate sweet potatoes, but Butter knows how to change your mind. The pork chop was juicy and full of flavor and everything a girl could have dreamed. I also bought one of her cookbooks to bring to my mom as she's a big fan and loves to cook. Little did I know Alex Guarnaschelli herself would be bringing it to me!

Purée the avocado smeared on stale bread and clump some buffalo mozzarella on it. Oh, you wanted seasoning?  Give me a break. Salmon, same thing. No seasoning and epic amounts of grease and liquids drowning out the spuds hidden beneath the fish. Undercooked and don't know if the Crostini or fish gave me the morning diarrhea gift from BUTTER.

4.0,12/5/2017,"Butter boasts a very elegant atmosphere with dark romantic lighting and decorated with a mahogany interior. It definitely lives up to its upscale name. I'm not proud to say that I first heard about this restaurant from watching Gossip Girl, but I definitely understand how this would be a restaurant that fits in with their show. To start, the waiters were all very attentive and polite. They came out and first served us perfectly salted rolls with an herb spread. As for appetizer, we ordered the Stuffed Cremini Mushrooms and the Greechie Boy Cornmeal Crusted Calamari. Normally appetizers are my favorite part of any meal and the Stuffed Cremini Mushrooms definitely lived up to my standards. The breadcrumbs were not too crunchy and paired well with the chewiness of the mushroom. The texture was almost that of a meatball. The shallots also added a nice boost of taste to the dish. As for the calamari, I would not recommend it again as the meat itself was hard to chew and almost seemed as if it were a few days old calamari. It just doesn't come off as juicy and crunchy. The aioli dipping sauce was a nice touch, but the calamari itself was very subpar. The fried kale on top also did not do much in terms of adding or bringing out flavors. For my main entree I got the Pan-Roasted Long Island Sea Bass. The skin was well cooked, but I feel like the actual meat of the fish could have been less ""mushy"". Normally, when I have sea bass it's soft, tender, and chewy. Even though it's soft it's not mushed together. The texture of the bass was almost the same texture you get when you over bake asparagus. However, the crunchy green bean salsa verde paired with the fish gave it that extra soury kick that paired really well together. So although I wasn't a fan of the texture, I was a fan of the taste. To end our meal we got Raspberry Beignets that were warm, fluffy, and sugary.

We'd been wanting to have a meal at Butter for a long time & it was the perfect occasion.  We made a relatively early reservation (6pm) and arrived early to have a drink at the bar before being seated. The hotesses were rather unfriendly (not mean, just not overly enthusiastic) but that didn't bother us too much. We split the Purple Paradise cocktail for two which is served in the Absolut Elyx copper pineapple. It was delicious - tart, refreshing and not too sweet.  After being sat, it took a while for the waiter to greet us but we saw him dealing with difficult patrons so we understood-- and from that point forward, he was extremely attentive and helpful.  He helped us select the perfect wine for our meal - not easy since I got steak and my sister got the roasted cauliflower. (And to note - the wine list is extensive and they have a fair amount of reasonably priced bottles - for NYC).   For dinner, we started with the stuffed shishito peppers (a MUST) - the smoked shallot dip was divine and the lightly fried peppers were perfection.  I ordered the NY strip with a side of the goat cheese grits. A-MAZ-ING. Of course, the steak was cooked to perfection, the mushrooms were a dream and I could have eaten those grits until I exploded -- beyond creamy and perfectly seasoned.   My sister ordered the steak tartare small plate and the cauliflower in coconut milk larger plate.  Both were perfectly seasoned.  The tartare was typical but superbly executed and the cauliflower was interestingly spiced and something different. Overall, we had a great experience. The decor and ambiance is classic, cozy and masculine.

3.0,11/13/2017,"In all honesty, I expected more from Butter. I came here with my girlfriend a few weeks ago to celebrate an anniversary and was pretty excited for the meal based on what I'd heard from friends and coworkers.The space was quite striking -- the high ceilings in the dining room made for a great ambiance. The cocktails were equally impressive. The meal started to go south with the appetizers. The shishito peppers, burrata and crudo were all entirely forgettable and honestly quite disappointing. I wouldn't get any of these items again. The service was painfully slow after the first round of cocktails.Luckily, the meal was somewhat saved by the pork chop and gnocchi mac 'n' cheese, both of which were delicious. The pork chop was moist and had an incredible tobacco-smoked flavor.

1.0,10/12/2017,"Came recommended. The young girl at the front asked if we had a reservation. We came from the connected hotel, whom told us reservations were not needed. The girl acted as if they had no seating and then asked us to wait, so we did. After 8-10 minutes, we walked into a restaurant that was half full. So why the wait and the act up front? Maybe their staffing isn't complete. no big deal. We were seated in close to the center of the restaurant and their lighting was horrible. I had a bright spot light on me from 12ft above. Noisier than the worst of NYC streets. We order from a ridiculously small menu of options. I chose the NY Strip with taragon butter and grits with goat cheese. The grits were not cooked and the steak (ordered cooked medium) was tough as leather and way under cooked as well, bleeding all over the plate. A glass of ice tea was 6.00, an 8oz bottle of Coke the same.  Then some seemingly grumpy old indian man kept coming and taking things from our table, refusing to reply to any questions or comments. He even took my wife's un-finished 6.00 glass of tea without asking and wouldn't stop when we asked him to. Horrible, over priced food that wreaks with arrogance of a chef that tries to over compensate for their short comings with overly rich additions to their food like goat cheese and butter.

2.0,10/11/2017,"Just okay isn't good enough when spending this kind of money for dinner. After a lot of thought, I made reservations here for our 23rd anniversary. When you make reservations,they ask if it's for a special occasion so I put it was our anniversary on the reservation request. When we arrived, there was no hostess to greet us and when she did come out she was wearing a large shirt/denim coat with sneakers. The best part was our service past that point. Our server was excellent, dishes were cleared immediately, crumbs removed and water glasses kept full. We started with the gnocchi mac and cheese. That was excellent aside from having too much garlic powder or garlic salt in the topping which I found a bit overwhelming. I ordered the sirloin and my husband ordered the chop. My husband enjoyed the flavor if his chop but thought it was tough. My $49 steak had a nice char and was cooked perfectly but lacked salt and was tough and loaded with unchewable fat. I only ate 1/3 of it and had 5 or 6 pieces of chewed inedible fat on my plate at that point. Pretty gross when you've got to spit out 1/2 chewed steak at dinner. We both enjoyed the chick pea fries and raspberry beignets. Wine and cocktails run $17 each here.

We started with some cocktails - both of which were very good, and had nice presentation. The burrata appetizer was good but a little underwhelming. For the mains, I had the lamb special and my girlfriend had the salmon. Both were very tasty and very filling. The dessert (clafoutis) was very nice but too sweet. Overall though, the food was very very good. The reason I'm doing 4 stars is because the service was haphazard and some small touches seemed overlooked. Our table was wobbly and someone had to come put something under one of the legs. The soap in the bathroom was Walgreens brand straight out of the plastic bottle.

2.0,9/24/2017,"Very nice service and comfortable, quiet seating. We came here based on the reputation and, to me, it was an expensive big time let down. It began with the Caesar salad covered, I understand, with ground crotons. That made the salad very dry and flavorless. In fact to be totally honest it tasted terrible. I had to force myself to finish it thinking the main course would make up for the bad salad. So out came my NY strip steak. Cooked just right. But it was so tough I had to put my weight into cutting it. And the taste is something I can't describe or put my finger on it except to say, to me, it tasted like crap. I ate about half of it before I gave up from both the carving effort and the horrible taste.  To say it had a unique flavor is putting it mildly as it tasted like nothing I would ever want or order knowing the flavor in advance.Needles to say this place is off my ""must return"" list.

We ordered 6 oysters from a variety of locations that were fresh and tasty. For our main course, my friend and I ordered the 28 day dry aged tomahawk ribeye for two. The steak was good but nothing mind blowing and didn't leave a lingering memory in my mind. The steak was prepared well, salted well, and served with a bed of rosemary. The steak itself was lukewarm when it came to us. Preparation time was a surprisingly long at 45 min or so. As for sides, we ordered the gnocchi mac and cheese which was mouthwatering and cheesy. Service: Immediately as we entered, we were greeted by the hostess. No issues with the waiters, though they switched waiters as one was clocking out midway through our meal.

And that means get out - the bar should be high. My appetizers were panzanella and gnocchi. The gnocchi was very good. Well seasoned and pillowy. The panzanella... it was actually great. BUT. It wasn't traditional- I could barely even find the bread. It had pea-sized croutons and was literally the smallest portion of salad I've ever been served. Exorbitantly over priced. As soon as I saw it, I immediately regretted forking over $19 for it. Not worth it.  My steak was good. It had a compound butter on top. Unfortunately, the steak was closer to room temperature so the butter just sat there instead of lusciously cascading throughout. Probably the biggest disappointment about the experience was the steak knife. I've had better knives at diners. Come on, Alex!

I love Alex and root for her on all the competitions she's in so I may have hyped up this experience more then I should have. I came in expecting poor service from the reviews but our server was very attentive and our food came out pretty quickly. I would've loved to try a drink but for $17 I couldn't let myself do it. With that said, let's get to the food. I did really enjoy this meal but there were some underwhelming dishes. Starting off with the bread: YUM, the bread was light and fluffy and was delicious with the sour cream and chive butter! From there we decided to split some small plates and appetizers: Harissa carrots w/ feta and roasted figs were delicious, the carrots were charred, the spices were perfectly balanced and I love the saltiness from the feta paired with the sweetness from the figs!Gnocchi mac and cheese- unpopular opinion I thought it was just ok. I would skip it next time, the gnocchi was soft and fluffy but the cheese sauce was a little bland. Take it or leave it honestly. Grilled chili rubbed octopus- this was also ok, the octopus was nicely spiced but could have used a bit more salt. It was also a bit tough. The beans underneath it were the best part of this though, nice and buttery and rich! Overall would not order again.Fois gras w/ walnut cake and peaches- SHOWSTOPPER. Seriously, I'd come back for this alone. The fois melted in my mouth and paired so nicely with the sweet cake and the sweet/tart peaches. I can't say enough amazing things about this one. 10/10.Finally we decided to get two desserts:Raspberry beignets- I read a lot of reviews about how good these were and was really looking forward to them. Just kind of meh. They could have been warmer. They were good but nothing to write home about.Dark chocolate mint grasshopper pie- OMG. This was the kind of dessert I'd expect from this restaurant. The minty filling was airy and perfect. The dark chocolate cocoa nib pieces were a perfect bitter textural contrast, almost like brownie brittle! There were also some green jello pieces?

5.0,8/14/2017,One of the highlights of our visit to New York.  Definitely did not Chop the location after any serving.  As you would assume the bread and butter were great but the veal bacon stole the pre-meal.  It was a big hit at the table.  The fish was on point and the steak seasoned and cooked perfect.  Finished with the Beignets that had the best dipping sauce.,0,0,0,Ray U.,"Orlando, FL",0,15,0
4.0,8/13/2017,"True to it's name - Chef Alex Guarnaschelli's Butter Midtown embodies the element of this fatty oil.  My friends and I participated in their restaurant week menu which comes with three choices of appetizers, mains, and two types of desserts.  For the main, my friend and I got the porkstrami crostini with rye berries, pickled cucumbers, and a mustard spread.  The dish came with three mini crostinis that were true to Iron Chef/Chopped/Food Network celebrity chef creations.  The porkstrami was like a mixture between Spanish pata negra and American bacon.  It had a nice mixture of fat and salty meat in each bite.  The mustard & pickled cucumbers went well with the salty meat.  The crostini was pumperknickel I believe, and was toasted perfectly and had a nice crunch factor to the bite as a whole.  My other friend was feeling adventurous as he typically doesn't eat raw, uncooked green tomatoes so he went with the heirloom tomato salad which came was blended together with fresh baby mozzarella, chilled watermelon cubes, and dressed evenly with a white balsamic vinaigrette.  I'm not a huge cheese lover so didn't get to try the dish as a whole but both of my other friends LOVED IT.  My friend who actually ordered it may now be converted to consuming farm-fresh yellow, red, and GREEN tomatoes. For the main - my friends ordered the petite duck breast, mizuna, pearl barley, and sour cherry jam dish.  I love exposing my friends to new culinary experiences because it forces them out of their routine of banal food choices - and this experience was a perfect example of these culinary adventures.  The pearl barley was cooked with duck confit and duck fat which made the dish so rich, but not overly buttery/greasy because of the addendum of the sour cherry jam.  The whole dish was not only beautifully presented, but the cohesion of all the elements made it the true star of the night.  I got the catch of the day, which I forget the name of, but it was a de-boned filet of fish that was slightly too salty for me, but the raisin and grape-infused grain that came underneath the dish served as a great component to the dish.  The grain (pearl couscous, perhaps) was infused with butter and was tasty.  For dessert, I think the cherry clafoutis, locust grove cherry jam with whipped mascarpone was the star!  Our chocolate expresso cake didn't come with any vanilla ice cream so that was a shame (didn't realize it was supposed to until now!), but the cake wasn't as rich or decadent as other cakes I have had.  I'm usually used to spongy or fudgy cakes, but this slice of cake was neither and tasted old.  A disappointment indeed when compared to the other dishes we had that night.  Regardless, four stars for this place because at the end of the night, we were served complimentary glass of digestif champagne which was a nice palate cleanser after the meal ended.  Not a bad way to kick off my weekend - I would not recommend Butter midtown for a quiet date since the restaurant volume is very high during their peak times.",4,0,0,Hannah L.,"New York, NY",74,179,97

Melted in my mouth. The 3 crostini were bite size and I would have loved if the dish were a little larger. I normally don't eat meat, but decided to try the duck since it was a special occasion. It was very rare and chewy, which I didn't really like, but my friends loved it. We were not provided with steak knives and it was nearly impossible to saw through the meat with a butter knife. The flavor of the cherry dressing and barley side dish were fantastic though and the portion was generous. The espresso chocolate cake was probably the best part of the meal and was the saving grace of the restaurant for me. Everything about it was perfection and melted in my mouth. The waitstaff was good about keeping the table clean and presenting the food, but were very uncommunicative. Our waiter didn't offer any explanation of the dishes and wasn't very friendly at all.

You definitely pay a premium for the celebrity chef association and the location, but I knew that going into things. They had a variety of cocktails to choose from, and I really enjoyed my drink. The one I got had a lychee frozen into the ice sphere, which I thought was a nice touch and added to the flavor of the drink. I got the gnocchi and foie gras to eat. The foie gras, hands down, amazing. I loved the glaze and the pairing of strawberries with it, and it was cooked expertly. The gnocchi, maybe after the first dish I had too high of hopes, but it was a pretty firm ""good"" instead of amazing. It looks like a smaller portion, but it's an extremely filling dish. I wouldn't get it, as they recommend, as an app. After that I didn't have room for dessert, which I do slightly regret seeing all the amazing reviews of it.

The bread and butter they serve at the beginning was exceptionally tasty too. But my salmon was boring - it barely tasted like anything.The service was okay I guess, although it took over an hour for our food to come out. Our server was nice enough, but she seemed more interested in talking with the other servers than checking in on us regularly. The décor is neat looking, and I liked the wood quasi-theme, but I kept getting the impression like everything (not just the décor either) was just trying too hard to be cool.

We started with the free bread and butter. Honestly the bread was just ok - it was SUPER crumbly and a little dry and my plate just looked like I had thrown up crumbs everywhere. The butter was gooood tho, there were 2 quenells of regular and garlic parsley (?) butter. For food, I got the tobacco smoked pork chop (i had to) cooked medium to medium well. My friends got the cavatappi and white cauliflower.The pork was BOMB. A little pricey, but it was smoky, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, there were 2 different beans (baked and fried) to add texture, and the sauce was amaaaaazing. I also tried my friend's cavatappi which was delicious and cheesy and my friends cauliflower (I thought just okay).I was a little disappointed by the service. Our waiter seemed very bored and not really what I would expect from a nice restaurant like this.

Thick-cut veal bacon with red wine mustard. Tobacco-smoked double-cut Heritage pork chop (medium) with baked Carolina red peas.I wasn't disappointed. Huge, bold flavors. The veal bacon was amazing. The pork chop I ordered medium at the waiter's suggestion, but might have been better medium-rare, because it's so thick and dense, though the flavor was good. The sauces, beans, etc. were extremely flavorful. It's the type of meal that you have and then you're fine - you've had it and don't necessarily want it again - but you're so happy that you did.

3.0,4/29/2017,"I really wanted to like this place.  If this was in my hometown, it would be a top ten restaurant.  I don't think anyone would be disappointed after finishing their meal here, but I don't think that I would be recommending it considering it is in the Mecca of restaurants that is NYC.Alex is a well known celebrity chef, and I expected perfection at every turn.  The hostess for the evening was very nice, knowledgeable, and the star of the evening.  She has a future as a restaurant manger, for sure.  Heck, she might as well have been the manager for that night, as we did not see one during our visit.   She noticed that we brought our 6 year old and immediately started selling him on the gnocchi Mac and cheese.  It was excellent.We ordered the bacon appetizer, and it was underwhelming.  Why would you add an extra salty mustard sauce to an already salty bacon slab?  It was edible, but we did not finish it.  Who doesn't finish bacon?  My son gave the dinner rolls 3 stars.  What six year doesn't love dinner rolls?  I think the rolls were supposed to be toasted, they were just dry.  They came with two different kinds of butter.  The chive butter was way too strong, but I did enjoy the sour cream butter.  This is a high end restaurant, either figure out how to bake a nice roll, or order them in from one of the million bakeries in the city.  Why embarrass yourself before the meal is served?My wife ordered the sea bass and really enjoyed the sauce.  She liked it enough, that she didn't share.I ordered a New York strip.  It was not your traditional crusted steak.  It came with a glaze.  It tasted a bit like A1 sauce with a twist.  I really liked it, and would order it again for sure.We ordered three sides: fries, grits, and risotto.  This is where I would have expected Alex to shine.  We didn't finish any of the sides.  They were OK, but nothing special.  The fries were under cooked, the risotto was under cooked, and the grits lacked flavor.Our server complained about the kitchen before he took our order.  He told us they were too busy to put in an appetizer order separately.  Either the server was bad or the kitchen was bad... either way, fix the problem Alex.Our server only said a few words to us all night and seemed pissed off about something, probably the kitchen.  Typically, I don't really care about the service, it is just icing on the cake for me.  This night, he could have been the difference for us, and he failed.The meal was close to $200.  When we were all said and done, I won't be back, but I'm not looking for a refund either.",4,1,1,Eric W.,"Sioux Falls, SD",128,95,185
5.0,4/27/2017,"I used to love going to Butter down on Lafayette street in my 20s so I was excited to check out the Midtown location that opened not too long ago. I went for an early work dinner so the restaurant was pretty quiet at 6pm. The room is cozy with gorgeous details. There is a lot of wood and almost has a cabin vibe to it.  In particular I loved the grand picture of an outdoor scene that takes up a wall of the dining room. I chose the stuffed artichokes to start. They were buttery, with toasted Parmesan dusted on top. They were delicate yet felt indulgent and the serving was enough to share. For my main course I tried the Roasted chicken. It was perfectly cooked and moist and flavorful. My table mate chose the Brussel sprout salad to start which I also tried. It had a very smoky taste and was nicely dressed in a balsamic sauce. Might be a bit too strong of flavors for some but I loved the mix of roasted and raw brussel sprouts. I also had a bite of the pork chop. Not my favorite but definitely not bad. Im just not a big fan of pork. I finished the meal with an order of raspberry beignets which were to die for. Overall 5 stars. I cant wait to go back!",1,0,0,Melinda H.,"Bridgewater, NJ",7,19,0

Here to celebrate my hubby's birthday, my party of 4 was greeted promptly and since we were a little early for our table, told to grab a drink.  Not 10 minutes later, the hostess came over, told me our table was ready & we were well on our way to culinary excellence! Our server, who's name escapes me, was divine & helpful with our choices, and went over the specials and gave us plenty of time and discuss what we wanted. We started with the Mac & cheese gnocchi, which I can not recommend enough and just want to go back and have a whole giant bowl of it for myself!!! The beef carpaccio was also a hit. After you order, the most delicious bread gets presented to the table, and while they might just look like regular dinner rolls, they are pillows of goodness, crossiant like interiors that just melt into your mouth! For our entrees, my sister-in-law & I split the 28-day aged Tomahawk steak for 2 - cooked to a perfection, we dived in and didn't look back!! ...and I even got the leftovers!! Hubby had the halibut steak special and was blown away with the flavors and balances and really wanted to lick his plate clean!! BIL had his well-done steak au poivre, and finished it completely.

4.0,4/18/2017,"We were looking forward to a memorable dining experience here, and it didn't disappoint!Ambiance/decor is lovely if a bit too stodgy/smoking clubby. Nice use of woods throughout, nice open room, but it needed fresh flowers and maybe larger pieces of art on the walls.  Kind of odd, actually: it was comfortable and open, but felt a little uninviting.Service made up for that:  server and other table staff were cordial, attentive and cute (hey, sue me).  I have to say, I was expecting to be treated as the tourists we were (I don't know why I expected this, maybe the ambiance...) but we were treated beautifully.  If you've read my other reviews, I gotta have ""attentive and friendly but not intrusive"", and this staff was completely on point.  Bravo to them.We started with one of the specialty cocktails for the husband, and an NA beer for me.  Unfortunately, the beer they brought wasn't NA (a real no-no for me), but they quickly rectified it by offering me one of their cocktails done as virgin, which I accepted.  We loved both of our drinks, very nice and refreshing.First course was the seared foie gras and the wild mushroom flatbread.  Foie gras was like butter, but would have been nice with some sort of bread to have with it.  The mushrooms on the flatbread were so, so tasty, and complimented by a nice cheese.  Lovely, earthy, delicious.For main course I ordered the sea bass with red miso and asparagus, and the husband had the roasted half chicken with parsnips.  We also ordered the grilled red endive and the roasted Walla Walla onion loaf.  Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious--exactly what you want to have happen, right?  We both wanted to curl up in the plate of roasted onions, which were sublime, outshone only by the chicken's side sauce/gravy/dipping sauce, which was deep, dark, delicious perfection.We bypassed dessert, rare for us at special occasion meals like this, and there were several I would have happily chosen.  But we were fairly stuffed at that point, and a little surprised to be so, as the portions were nicely (humanly) sized but not huge.  Downside, I have to say, was the pricing, which seemed a little too high, and actually felt a little arbitrary, or a little ""this is what we can get away with in midtown"".  I don't know...  Maybe we've been gone from living in NYC too long, and don't get back often enough, and the prices were a shock ($40 for the chicken, or $10 for two small pieces of grilled endive, for example).  In any case, it *was* a special occasion, and it felt like one from beginning to end, so that is what we paid for.  Again, the food was delicious, the service stellar, and if we go again, we may order the small plates to allow room for desserts.Thank you, Alex and staff, for a great meal!

The service was mediocre at best. Our server was dry with no personality and halfway through our meal, came to the table and said she was leaving for the evening and someone else would be serving us. Bizarre shift change at a high end restaurant. Plates were either attempted to be scooped up too soon OR sat until they piled up at the end of the table.On to the food. Rolls are served to the table that tasted like Kings Hawaiian Rolls from the grocery store...they came slightly warm, and as they cooled became hard. The carpaccio was slimy and not served with toasted crackers, etc to put it on. The baratta had ok flavor, but was so chewy that it had to be cut with a knife to serve. We order baratta often, and you should easily be able to cut through it with your fork. I ordered the cavatappi pasta which our server said they are known for. Big regrets. It was extremely dry. It needed more sauce and the sauce itself  needed more flavor and less spice. The longer the meal sat at the table the harder the pasta got and became inedible.

Boy, did it disappoint.  Please spend more time there and you will see that you should be chopped and return your iron chef jacket. I wanted to order everything on the menu unfortunately the food did not live up to its menu descriptions. We ordered 5 dishes for 2 of us. The waiter opted to bring the salad and hamachi tartare, described as served with grapefruit and pink peppercorn. The hamachi was diced as was the cucumber that was not mentioned in the description. Didn't get a hint of peppercorn or acid. The mache salad was fine but it was greens, with a beet dust, that was pretty but not flavorful. And then after a 20 minute wait the waiter brought our next 3 dishes, foie gras, white cloud cauliflower and Farro with parsley pesto.  My beef here: why the heck didn't he waiter give us the appetizer of the foie gras first?  My guess is we were two women and he wanted to rush us. I am pretty confident had we had 3 courses we would have ordered more wine. As it was with the break and choices he made, tip was low. He will probably blame it on 2 female diners. Back to food, cauliflower was great and so was the farro.  But the carrots accompanying the cauliflower was in tiny dice just like the hamachi. The little squares made me think of the vegetables in Campbell's Soup and Swanson's chicken pot pies. We skipped dessert, I was so sad I wanted to get out of there.

The drink embodies summer, it was February but I felt like I was having dinner in the middle of July with this drink in my hand.To start we had the Brussel sprout salad. Apple, radish, pecan dressing. I am dumbing this description down but I swear - this was one of the best meals I had ever eaten. Butter makes each person feel as though the chef is cooking a special meal just for them. Each dish has that home cooked high quality fine dining taste (if that makes any sense). Back to the food - I next ordered a special flatbread that had a pesto spread and arugula. It was fresh light and the perfect dish to have in between your salad and your entree. For my entree I had one of the specials - a crab ravioli dish. I could not tell you what type of sauce it was in or how it was cooked but I could tell you that one bite sent my taste buds soaring! The flavors combined into a symphony that I cannot explain. My mother ordered the white cloud cauliflower which is difficult to describe but after one taste I knew I would never have a cauliflower like that again.

5.0,3/16/2017,"As a long-time Chopped fan, as soon as I found out we were making a trip to New York City, I knew I needed to make reservations here. A restaurant by Alex Guarnaschelli? Heck yes! I anxiously awaited the day we got to go dine at Butter, and it did not disappoint. Upon walking downstairs, you're greeted by a beautiful dining area. It's dim, but everything from the wood and seats radiates with quality. The staff up front were funny and friendly. As college students, it was nice to be at a fine dining place where they also would joke around and make everyone feel comfortable. We checked our coats and were promptly seated Our waitress was very nice as well, and the staff were quick to refill our waters. Our meal began with the bread, which every review raves about. It was delicious; both airy and with a very nice taste. They give you a couple types of butter for it; they're nothing special, but it's still very good. I ordered the strip steak (cooked medium) with the white mushroom gratin for dinner. They seem to update their menu frequently, so I suggest checking online for the current menu before going. I can honestly say it was one of the best steaks I've had in a long time. It was very tender, and the seasonings were delicious. You get a huge depth of flavor with it, and I would definitely order it again. The mushroom gratin was great as well, though the sides are huge, so I would suggest sharing at your table. For dessert, I had the apple napoleon. It was a bit difficult to eat due to how crunchy the pastry is, but it was delicious. It was innovative, and their dessert menu have a lot of selections you wouldn't find elsewhere. Price-wise, expect to spend money. This is certainly a more upscale experience, so expect an entree to run around $50 and desserts to run about $15. Cocktails are $17. The food was well worth it - my only gripe is that a soft drink costs $6 for an 8 ounce glass. So I would say either stick with water or just go for an alcoholic drink. Other than that though, I think the price was around what you'd expect for this kind of place. Overall, I'm very glad to have gotten to eat here.

Excellent service.  If you want something to drink,  don't order a soda. We didn't feel like splurging on a glass of wine, so we ordered cokes ( $6 for a 8 Oz bottle, yikes). Should have just gotten the wine. The rolls you begin with are delicious, sprinkled with salt and served with two different kinds of butter. We passed on the appetizers. For the main coursr, I ordered the half chicken with mashed potatoes. Very good. The potatoes were heavenly and it was a very hearty portion of chicken. My friend ordered the New York Strip, and it was absolutely amamzing.For dessert, I ordered the chocolate matcha checkerboard cake. I'd never had matcha, wasn't the biggest fan of the flavor, but it was very subtle and the chocolate overpowered it for years most part and it was served with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.

3.0,2/25/2017,"The two guests that came with me really enjoyed this restaurants and I noticed there were a lot of loyal costumers that were seated and were welcomed by servers as friends and had big smiles on their faces. However, I thought this was a lower scales restaurant that invested in some cheap upgrade to look like a upper scale New York restaurant. The art on the walls was poorly chosen, the finishing on the walls was cheap plastics and the presentation on the plates lacked in every aspect. Everything we ordered showed up on different plates that looked like they previously belonged to a diner, and there was no garnish.

4.0,2/23/2017,"I went for dinner last night and I have to say the place exceeded my expectations. The only reason I gave a 4 is I yelped it before and everyone recommended the pork chops - personally I didn't enjoy them and left more than half my plate. My friend ordered the steak and it was amazing! I ordered the raspberry beignets for dessert and this was beyond scrumptious! I would go back and order them as part of my cheat meal any day of the week!

2.0,2/20/2017,"Good food not great.This review is really going to be so low because of the service. This was the WORST waitress I have ever had. I have a severe nut allergy and she lied straight to my face numerous times about asking the chef about it. And then when the sorbet came out there was clearly cross contamination on it because they had accidentally dropped meringue in it!Overall, Rose, our waitress was absolutely rude to me every time I asked about my allergy and clearly was not trained well as three times in the meal we were sitting with just waters waiting on her...In response to the restaurants comment to me:I would like to clarify that I know meringue does not contain any nuts. The point is with bits accidentally dropped in my sorbet clearly the kitchen was not safe about cross contamination like promised. Cross contamination is the difference between life and death with someone with allergies. The comment from butter management on this review just further solidifies my bad experience at butter.",5,3,2,Kelsey M.,"New York, NY",5,28,0

2.0,2/16/2017,"Honestly this is one of those reviews I never wanted to write but I have no choice. This was my third visit ever to this place. Considering Alex Guarnaschelli is running the restaurant I will come over and over again with my eyes closed. That was till Valentine's Day 2017. For everyone of you who follows my reviews you are very used to my ""overlook"" about service but on this case I have no other choice. Well, technically I will not talk about service, but totally the opposite. This is the story.Knowing it was Valentine's Day I decided to go early (early in NYC means). I got a nice place at the bar which was quite full. I ordered a half bottle of Sauvignon Blanc. My bartender was attentive although she may want to use a smile once in a while (I remember this from my last two visits anyway). She pointed me to the special menu for the occasion. I decided to order pasta amatriciana and for desert the beignets with raspberry sauce.While waiting on my food I noticed I was not offered  the bread basket, while everyone else was. I just tried to ignore it but I took note. Suddenly the bar was full so was the dining room. I patiently waited for my food and about 20 minutes after I ordered, a runner showed up with the beignets. I told him it would be fantastic if I can have my entree before my desert. I witnessed an argument between the runner and the bartender then another guy joined (later I figure out he was the manager). I don't know what happened but someone was not doing things right. I decided to look around. The dining room was served, slowly but consistent. I noticed some people was sat around the same time I did and after about 40 minutes they got their food. Mine was still missing. After 1 hour waiting (no kidding, no exaggeration, 1 hour) I asked for my check. There is when everything went south really fast. Suddenly the bartender wanted to fix the problem, so was the manager. I told them I don't like to be ignored, it is pretty much an insult to me. The manager waived my bill, I left a small tip for the 'service' received and left.Conclusion: Alex, you are one of the greatest chefs in the USA and I enjoyed your food in all my visits to both restaurants you run in Manhattan, but I couldn't help to notice, when the restaurant was not too busy, the service was good (sometimes just acceptable), but when it is a full house, your personnel struggles, and really bad (I mentioned above, some tables waited 40 minutes for their meal... well... at least they got it, not like me). On the other hand, this is, literally, a classic for me. There are hundreds of people out there, who ignored me... once... not twice... it is useless to say, I put an X on your restaurants. Hope you have wonderful and prosperous business in the future... not from me, though.",6,1,0,Rudy J. T.,"Coppell, TX",1,47,0
2.0,2/15/2017,"Good food (not amazing) / frustrating experience. We called in around 5pm to see if it was possible to reserve a table at 5:30pm on a Tuesday night. Not surprisingly, we were told no because it's their rush time until much later (maybe 10pm or something). That was understandable, but when we went in a 5:30, the place was half empty and yet they still wouldn't seat us at a table. Okay, so maybe they are holding those tables for 6pm reservations (we would later learn that's not the case). My wife asked if we could sit at the bar and that worked because they do serve the full menu at the bar. Sitting there came with below par service. We were kind of stuck at the end and felt like we were sitting at the kids table; almost out of sight and out of mind. We ate our whole meal and left while tons of tables were still available (they sat empty the whole time). Lots of reviews on Yelp mention the ""amazing bread"". Well, we were never served any, until we asked for it near the end of our meal. The butter was the best part. The bread was just like a dry dinner roll, in my opinion. My salmon dish was good. No complaints. My wife and daughter shared a couple of things, one of which was gnocchi mac and cheese, which they said was delicious, but skimpy (it came with something like 5 pieces). My daughter didn't like the grits she ordered. Our experience probably would have been way better had they kindly sat us a table, like they cared at all about our patronage, and waited on us like the paying customers we were, instead of making us feel like we were supposed feel lucky to be there.",0,0,0,Adam G.,"Moorpark, CA",168,26,1

1.0,2/11/2017,"It was by far the worst experience I've ever had dinning a restaurant.  I have dine out a lot and this was by far the worst. My wife and I are frequent diners in some of the most expensive restaurants in New York City. But this by far was the worst experience I've ever had. When we first sat down at the table the waiter never introduced himself. He just handed us the winelist. When we asked him what would he recommend, he said everything is good and that he cannot give us any advice on any of the foods.  I've never been to a place which the waiter could not give me any advice. When I order a glass of rose champagne he brings over a glass that was completely soaking wet and sticky on the outside. I asked him was it customary for a customer to receive a wet glass?  He it's normal for the bar tender to wash the outside of the glass before we pour champagne into the glass to better preserve the bubbles so the glass can be cooler. It was just a really dumb excuses for a messy restaurant with poor service. After our appetizer there was a 45 minute wait until we actually got our entrée. During this time I've asked three different people of when out entree will be coming,  yet no one returned back to our table to tell us that it was on its way or anything at all. When I mention this to our waiter, he simply said it's normal to wait 45 minutes for our entree and that he has been in the restaurants for over 10 years and it's was the normal. Another dumb excuse after another. When we later asked to speak with a manager named Tony, he came over us and said he heard Heard it from my waiter that we were concerned about the wait time for the food. I'm just curious how come if he heard it he never came one time charge table to apologize for such a long wait for the entrée to come in.  This whole entire establishment is filled with useless and incompetent employees. From the waiters to the manager no one seem to take responsibility for their job nor can do a decent job either.

4.0,2/9/2017,"Back before there was a ""Butter Midtown"" my family and I had done Restaurant Week at the downtown location. I was blown away by the food and carved wood decor, but I wondered how the restaurant survived the relocation and the intervening years. Returning during the winter 2017 R.W.,  I found that the dinner fare might not be as across-the-board spectacular as before, but the high note was still striking. I began with the tuna carpaccio with shallots and blood orange: the protein was fine, but it was the other ingredients that made this app succeed. The bed of puréed celery root was delicious.I'll skip ahead to the dessert of a banana bread sundae with candied walnuts and hot chocolate. Again it was the secondary touches that stood out, in this case really flavorful marshmallows.Rewinding to the main course, I was boxed into selecting a vegetarian dish. But the whole roasted carrots was ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I'VE EVER EATEN. The herbed yogurt and fried almonds each supplied a wonderfully strong and independent taste. I'm not that familiar with Chermoula, which is a North African marinade. But having tasted it here, I gotta have more of this seasoning method.

A few potatoes and some frisée was such a bad call for a Potato Salad. Food was ok, not very flavorful. Service was ok, no water refills. Definitely felt we weren't getting the best service as RW patrons. On the other hand, the veal bacon off the main menu was good. That and the cheese stuffed olives in their martini were by far the best food options.

The price is $40/ person. All in all, I spent $40 to eat scrambled eggs and chopped apples...awesome. I cannot help but feel as if I just soaked my money in water and watched it dissolve.

The staff placed various signs in the entrance and around the elevators which made it easy for our group to find. Too bad it was way too cold to enjoy the terrace, but I can imagine the ambiance and views out there are spectacular! Our menu included braised pork belly, Caesar salads, prime spiced-rubbed hanger steak, braised lamb shanks, blackened wild salmon, raspberry filled beignets and pumpkin pie. For the most part everything I had was delicious. The caesar salad was one of the best I've ever had and my husband could have eaten 5lbs of the braised pork belly. For our entrées I ordered the hanger steak and he ordered the braised lamb. He thoroughly enjoyed the lamb which had great flavor. The steak that I ordered medium was very under, almost to a black and blue play. I hated to do it but I had to send it back to be cooked longer, I planned this meal 4 months ago there was no way I wasn't going to enjoy my meal! After the steak came back some pieces were still too rare, but I ate what I could and that was that. It did have great taste! Unfortunately not too many people enjoyed the desserts. I ordered the raspberry filled beignets which I found to be too tart, and the vanilla dipping sauce was pretty plain. According to most the pumpkin pies had a tartness to them that they didn't enjoy as well.The drinks the staff provided were excellent.

5.0,12/26/2016,"I finally made my way to Alex Guarnaschelli's Butter for what turned out to be a wonderful dining experience in midtown Manhattan.First, let's start with the ambiance. Despite being below street level, the restaurant is deceptively large, and the space feels quite open as its tall ceilings reach two stories upwards. The use of glass, architectural arches, and a back-lit forest scene bring the right amount of light into a comfortable, clubby space. The bar itself is beautiful and impressively stocked, the kind of bar you could have dinner at when you're on your own, or have a few drinks with friends before heading out to the theatre. The background music is spot on and quite eclectic, with everything from Funk's Super Freak to chill modern techno to some really cool alternative rock coming through the speakers - music with great style without being intrusive, the perfect backdrop for a fun dinner with friends.I took a bit of a stroll around the dining area and, except perhaps for the several two-top tables next to the high-top communal tables, there doesn't appear to be a bad seat in the house. The booths are quite comfortable, and that's where we settled in to sample the delights coming out of Ms. Guarnaschelli's kitchen.Sometimes, a combination of words will pop out at you when perusing a menu, and when we saw the words ""Gnocchi Mac and Cheese"" all strung together, we knew that something great was waiting for us in the kitchen. The dish is a playful riff on mac and cheese, substituting gnocchi for the pasta, with a wonderful combination of melted Petit Basque and aged cheddar cheeses, finished with toasted breadcrumbs. The dish was nothing short of amazing - so much so that, when the gnocchi were all gone, I took one of the fluffy, freshly baked rolls and scooped up the remaining cheese from the plate. (Don't judge - I'm Greek, it's what we do.) The spinach and melted bacon dip was also great, nicely seasoned and accompanied by a flavorful, lightly crunchy pecorino toast. For my entrée, I had a special scallop dish with spinach, bok choy, and bacon. The scallops were fresh, perfectly prepared, and paired nicely with everything else on the plate. My buddy had the crispy scattered Acres farms chicken, crispy on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside, just right.It's now time for dessert, and we opted for the raspberry beignets. They're prepared to order, come to the table nice and warm, and are accompanied by a lovely vanilla bean dipping sauce that I could have easily finished off on its own with a spoon. The beignets were deceptively light, with just enough of a sugar coating to give you that little bit of sweet you want at the end of a lovely dinner. The beignets are large, so a single order is enough for 2-3 people.Finally, kudos to the staff - everyone we interacted with was wonderful, from the host who greeted and seated us to our server, who was friendly yet professional, striking just the right balance. Butter's location is perfect for a pre-theatre dinner, with almost all of the Broadway stages just a few blocks away.I've always thought of midtown Manhattan as a bit of a culinary wasteland, but Butter Midtown has dissuaded me of that notion - a true gem on West 45th that I'm looking very forward to visiting again during my next trip to New York.",8,1,6,Andy B.,"Bethesda, MD",297,448,3081

1.0,12/21/2016,"I ate at butter last December and again this December and the experience could not have been more different.  The food was tasty but not good enough for the overblown price and the tiny portions.  Having paid nearly two hundred dollars for a meal and still be hungry leaves one with a bad taste in their mouth. Talk about composed plates and elevating dishes, not here.  Basically, I got a New York strip with a few onions on top.  Side???  What side??  It must have been the 3 baby red potatoes that were sliced in half, that were an additional 10.00.  But that was a kings portion compared to the cereal bowl filled halfway with short rib ragu.Save your money and go to Brooklyn Diner for the homemade pot pie!!!",0,1,0,Lisa B.,"Emmonak, AK",0,2,0
2.0,12/20/2016,"It's tough to find a good place to eat close to Times Square. This should be it, but the details are all off. Restaurants by celebrity chefs are always a toss-up. On one hand, you should expect the innovative food and precise execution that got them to the top. On the other hand, they're now so busy that they might not be as hands on as they once were. That's glaringly obvious at Butter, where the dishes were interesting in concept, but failed in execution. First off, service was abysmally slow. To the point that we were ready to order by the time we were greeted. Soon after, we got water and bread and, thank goodness, we brought our own bottle of wine, because who knows how long it would have taken if we'd ordered a bottle. Also, a note: exciting or surprising are not words I'd use to describe this wine list, although it is totally serviceable, if overpriced.We ordered the spinach and melted bacon dip, which was a nice-sized bowl of dip, with a mere four pieces of toast for dipping. We waited for a long time to hear from our waiter to order more. In the meantime, a busboy was busy refilling our water glasses, and told us he'd told our waiter we wanted more toast and was confused about where they were.We ordered a salad of shaved raw and roasted brussels sprouts with walnuts, apples, and a mustard vinaigrette, which would have been fantastic, if it hadn't been drowning in dressing that overpowered every element. For our main, we shared the gnocchi mac and cheese and the side of broccoli. The gnocchi was well-prepared and cheesy. It would be difficult to mess it up. The broccoli was... a bowl of steamed broccoli. For $10, I'd expect something more... More interesting ingredients, more surprising preparation, more broccoli in the bowl.However, between the appetizers and the main, the attentive busboys cleared our dishes, including our silverware. Then the food runners brought the food. And we sat, and waited, for several minutes, for more share plates and silverware. Our waiter walked by several times and never checked on us. Instead, one of the many attentive busboys took care of us.At the end of the day, the meal was fine, and for $63, not all that expensive, compared to what the atmosphere and location would suggest. But the lackluster service and botched details took it from something that could have been amazing to something that fell far short of the possibilities.",2,1,0,Chelsea S.,"San Francisco, CA",7,43,0

Ordered the same dishes as before. Unlike the first time, they were a huge disappointment: Poached shrimp were stringy and lacking flavor; gnocchi mac and cheese was very under-seasoned. Gave the cake of the day another shot: regretful. The lemon-scented olive oil cake with chocolate buttercream icing was over-baked, dry, with a thick hard crust. The bottom nearly black. My dinner mate's piece proved the same. The only saving grace was the buttercream. $14 could have purchased me an entire cake at a grocery store that was better prepared.

All of this makes me sad because the food was absolutely delicious. We ordered the tomahawk steak for two which was the best steak we've ever had and we've eaten at most of the best places across the US. It was huge and insanely delicious. I think that it could easily serve three if not split between four in addition to some appetizers. We also ordered the French fries and broccoli which were a nice compliment to our meal. Our problem obviously is with service and that's what I think many of the people on here have to say. We saw our steak waiting to be served to us sit for 10 minutes before reaching the table. We thought at first that possibly the meat was resting but we knew that wasn't the case when our food came over. The French fries were luke warm and things just weren't as hot as they should be. After we ate our steak we waited for the check for about 30 minutes and once we got the check, we waited another 15 for it to be picked up.

4.0,11/19/2016,"Went to Butter Midtown on Friday, my wife was super excited because Alex G is one of her favorites. My expectations of an Iron Chef are high and Butter does not disappoint. The place is below street level and you immediately get the vibe of the place as you descend the stair. It's a nice mix of wood and steel with soft lighting which sets the mood as comfortably chic. Service was excellent, we were a few minutes early for our reservation and were immediately seated in a booth. We ordered a couple of cocktails (holy basil and bitter sling) and some roasted shishito peppers. It was an excellent start. As I looked up at my wife I noticed Alex Guarnaschelli herself sitting in the booth behind us. As we dined several folks noticed her and she was always most gracious ( on a fun note her daughter even slid in next to her for a few minutes)The staff had perfect timing and knew the menu and features inside out. The wine list had a great selection and at a wide range of price points, something for every pallet.The food was great, we had the tobacco smoked double cut pork chop and the roasted Atlantic bass. Again both were excellent. The glaze on the chop had me hunting for more but also realizing it was just enough to let the pork shine and the mostarda with champagne grapes on the bass was a perfect counterpoint to the fish. The only down note to the evening was the order of steamed broccoli with lemon which came out cold and dry.For dessert I had the Gala apple crisp with Guajillo ice cream and cognac ( my wife had another holy basil so that tells you just how much she liked the first one) the crisp was good but I would not have said it was the highlight of the meal.Honestly, if Butter had been the only fine dining we had done on this trip it probably would have been the full 5 stars but we had had two other meals which were just over the top so I couldn't go there.

5.0,11/17/2016,"I recently dined at Butter with a friend who recommended it and, wow, what a truly incredible dining experience. One of the best meals of my life. To start, we each had a cocktail. My friend had one with watermelon, which was very fresh, and I absolutely loved my cocktail with pear. Strong and still drinkable.For our starters, we had the spinach bacon dip and croquettes. I have never had a spinach dip with such depth and flavor. The croquettes were perfectly crispy on the outside. We also got warm, delicious rolls for the table when we sat down and requested more to use on the dip, because it was so good we wanted to sop up as much as we could.Next, we shared the salad with sugared pumpkin. I am not at all a pumpkin person, and I usually avoid it in food or drink, but this was delicious. The mustard-based dressing was so addicting that I wanted to lick the plate, and I loved the use of pumpkin seeds for crunch and flavor.We both opted to get appetizer sized pastas as our mains, since we wanted to try as many dishes as we could fit in (and afford!). My friend got the pasta with yellow tomato sauce and lamb sausage, which was hearty yet bright. Very nice. I had the special for the evening, which was sweet potato tortelloni with parmesan sauce and shaved white truffle. Stunning. The kind of food you have to take small bites of because the flavor is just so good, you need a bit if a break to process each bite. The starter pastas were surprisingly large, if cost/size is a deciding factor.Dessert was off the wall with coffee (where they bring you your own little pot and heated milk) and raspberry beignets. The most fluffy, light, perfectly sugared little clouds of raspberry jelly goodness. Dear god. So good. Could eat them every day.Service was great the entire time. Very cool interior.  This is definitely a special occasion place, as it is pretty pricey, but an amazing dining experience. Would love to go back!",0,0,0,Eliza D.,"Long Island, NY",8,131,76
2.0,11/17/2016,"First time I was here, I loved it. I was really looking forward to getting back to Butter Midtown. It was a disappointment.  I had recommended it to my friend and so we headed in.My friend and I sat at the bar for our meal.  The bartender/waiter gave us our menus and then it took a long time before we could reach him to place our order.  Our food was slow in coming  Other waiters kept trying to deliver to us other meals we did not order. There was a fish meal and a beef meal we did not order but the waiters were sure were ours. Finally we did receive the correct order. My favorite Cauliflower on the menu is now an over-sauced, slightly under-cooked  and definitely overpriced main entree. The only Cabernet on the menu by the glass is mediocre and the price paid for one glass is what the full bottle costs at a retail outlet. My friends salad was nothing special but she did get an order of fries and those were probably the best thing we had that afternoon. We once again had to wait to get the bartender so we could pay our bill.  We paid the bill and walked away.  We were busy talking and definitely not paying attention.  Later my friend realized we were WAY over charged.  She called the restaurant and went over our receipt with the manager.  I never keep the receipt, she did which was a good thing (lesson learned on my part).  We were charged for the two meals we did not order as well as for additional drinks we did not order.  After emailing a copy of our receipt to the restaurant and they did some research we were credited for the  over charges.

To start, the menu was extremely cookie cutter... a pan seared salmon, a beef dish, a pork loin, a chicken dish, another ""special"" fish dish, and some pastas. Nothing special. Nothing crazy.What really got me was the plating and the overall decor. The plates they served the food on we're basically diner plates. And to make matters worse, I paid WAY too much for the tiny piece of salmon I got. The taste was good, nothing special or that I couldn't have gotten half the price elsewhere. If dinner for 4 is $400 can we at least get a decent plate?The one thing that saved this from a 1 star was that the cocktail I had wasn't bad... pretty decent in fact. It had bourbon and chocolate bitters with beer. (Also giving this a 2 star because they offered more bread and that's what everyone goes there for!).The waitress was friendly and relatively accommodating, but overall it was just underwhelming.

1.0,9/12/2016,We received a free glass of champagne from our hotel Cassa.  Though we had dinner reservations at Nobu we wanted to check out Butter beforehand and enjoy our free treat.  We arrived with no real welcome from the hostess and sat at the bar. The bartender was not friendly. Once he found out that we were there for our free glass of champagne he barely reacted and handed us a plastic glass.  There were plenty of glasses but we were not granted those. We thought the place was lovely and said we wanted to come back later in the evening to check out the outside area. The bartender was not interested in us at all returning. He said they close early on Saturday nights and that the outside area is closed on weekends.  The food might be fabulous here but we were not given any reason to return. Too bad that the bartender treated us as not worthy for his attention.,2,0,1,Lisa M.,"Providence, RI",124,22,2
3.0,9/11/2016,"I've been wanting to go to Butter for a long time, as I'm a huge fan of Alex Guarnaschelli. So, finally went for pre-theater dinner last week. Firstly, the space itself is great. The decor is a great mix of dark wood, modern lines and enormous windows (the restaurant itself is below street level). The service was friendly and attentive. Since we had to make a 7pm curtain, the waiter kept us on time even with our delays in making up our minds on what to order. He was clearly juggling other tables, but was easy to get his attention. The bread... The bread and butter selection alone makes the experience worth it. We had to stop ourselves from shoving it in our faces. I appreciate the plating of the butter, but there should be more. The butter to bread ratio was a little lacking. From there, I so wanted to love the food. The menu looked so delicious that it was difficult to make a decision. We wound up ordering a combination of non-entree items.  For the most part, the rest of the food was just okay. It wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, but was ""meh"" compared to our expectations. The one hero (outside of the bread), was the corn bacon dip. I could have eaten that with a spoon.",0,0,0,Courtney C.,"New York, NY",116,14,7
4.0,9/11/2016,"First, the positives. Butter is a beautiful restaurant, nice atmosphere. I took my family there for my wife's birthday. She had the tobacco smoked pork chop. She said it was the best she ever had. I'm not a fan of pork but had a taste, it was amazing. Flavor and texture were astounding. I had the strip steak, very good, cooked and seasoned perfectly. Gnocchi Mac and cheese, nice texture and wonderful, unique cheese. My daughter had salmon. She said it was one of the best she ever had.The negative side was service. Our waitress was slot on but she couldn't help the slow kitchen response. We waited 45 minutes for our meals. I could see someone who was probably the manager, he stood at the bar and most of the time looked like he was surveying the room, a few times he was texting. our waitress came up to say she was checking on our dinner and apparently prompted the kitchen to get it done, meals came out about 10 minutes later. The ""manager"" never moved from his spot at the bar. He should have been there as the face of the restaurant. We left a nice tip for the waitress. Please upgrade your silverware.

2.0,8/4/2016,"Came here for the restaurant week dinner menu;Appetizer - The P.E.I mussels definitely hold up to the restaurant's name and was very buttery indeed. Actually that was all I could taste was butter, but not the salty, fatty, yummy kind of way; it was more like the super rich, greasy, coat your mouth and esophagus on the way down kind of way. Without an acid to cut the richness it got old fairly quickly. The mussels themselves were tiny, each morsel being no bigger than my thumbnail. Main Course - The Eggplant Pasta was irrelevant in every sense of the word. Think of the first time you cooked pasta in your life and had no idea what al dente was. Plus butter and cheese that tasted like melty Styrofoam and flavorless eggplant. The parmesan on top was the only other flavor present (besides the butter sauce). It was disappointing.*Side note, I did have a bite of my friend's steak which was pretty O-K.Dessert - The Boston Crème Pie was ok, but I'm not really a 'sweets person' so my review on this is not really important.

1.0,7/20/2016,"What a disappointment!  I had friends in town from out of state who wanted to go there because their daughter's office was near by.  We had a large party of 10 on a Sunday evening and there was virtually no one in the restaurant.  Eating in an empty restaurant is never fun, but our group was so large that we couldn't really go anywhere else.  This must be a busier restaurant for the work crowd during the week, but it is dead on Sunday night.The hostess gave us our menus as we were seated, but it took about 20 minutes before any waiter came by with water or drink orders... and by then, we had all perused the menu and went ahead and placed our dinner order too.  I'm not kidding when I say it was ONE FULL HOUR before our appetizers arrived.  Ridiculous.  During this time, six of us began drinking wine (the other 4 were minors), and of course, with our large party we needed 2 more bottles to drink with our appetizers since it had taken so long for the first course to come.  My husband was sitting at the crack between the 2 joined tables, and his wine glass spilled.  The waiter just stood there.  He didn't make a move to clean it up or to bring my husband a new napkin until we asked for it.The food portions were tiny!  For the price tag on each course, I was really shocked by how small the portions were, especially since they were not labeled as small plates to be shared.  Everyone got his/her own appetizer but 3 bites was about it.  My artichoke and kohlrabi salad was tough and stringy.  My husband's creamed spinach appetizer was also very small and not particularly tasty... probably partly because the waiter up-sold that dish setting expectations much higher than reality warranted.Another long gap in service to clear our appetizer plates, and then another long wait for our entree course.  Of course, the wine bottles kept coming to boost the total tab... but they couldn't manage to get all 10 entrees to the table near the same time, so we began eating in shifts to avoid cold dinners.  Our friend's daughter, who worked near by, met us at Butter for our meal, but she had to return to work, without having her entree, since the dining experience was so incredibly SLOW.  We complained to the manager about the terrible service, and he did apologize and offered a complimentary dessert to make up for our long wait.  They gave us ""beignets"" that tasted like raspberry jelly filled donuts.The bill was in excess of $1,000 for an unworthy experience.  We will never go back to Butter.  There are too many other stellar restaurants with comparably stellar service to waste our time and money on a place like Butter.",0,0,0,Pam K.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,10,0

Overall the dessert menu wasn't  appealing, i was looking for something quintessentially chocolate which i think all dessert menus should have. I settled for the marshmallow dish and it did not satiate my sweet tooth, the ganache  was just ok. Lastly, the butter which I was really excited to try fell short, it was missing that deep, richness that makes you fall in  love with butter.

The reason why I am rating this experience a 3 is because of desert... Not many good options. I decided on the ice cream sandwich, which I would rate a 2. Very small and flavors were just ok.

The bread and butter that was served while we were waiting was good. The drinks were good (cosmo and margarita).  We get our potato croquettes on a plate but they'd taken our bread plates so we had to eat off the big plate because our waiter wasn't anywhere to be found most of the night.   As we were finishing he stopped by and asked if we wanted smaller plates to put the appetizer on.  Astonishing that he only thinks of that after we were finished.The entrees eventually came out.  It took so long that a bus boy actually tried to clear our silverware thinking we had finished when we hadn't even been served.  More drinks were ordered in the meantime.   I had the fried chicken, my friend has steak.  Both were fine.  But after the service experience, I didn't think a chicken breast (with wing) and mashed potatoes were worthy of $35.    We did order dessert, the raspberry beignets.  They were absolutely delicious and came with a very tasty white sauce.Oh and twice the lights went out and the emergency spotlights came on.  Our waiter was serving our food the first time and said ""they're testing something"".  No mention what they were doing the second time.  But you really think 7:30 pm when the restaurant is full is the best time to test the emergency lighting?Total before tip was almost $200.  Listen, the place is lovely and the food is fine but they should really walk a block to the Chick Fil A on the corner of 46th and 6th to learn how to treat customers.  If I'm dropping $100 for my meal & drinks, I do have a minimum expectation of a greeting from the waiter.   There's no value here; I would not return.",35,19,13,Bill T.,"New York, NY",1361,2290,9300

3.0,7/2/2016,"I'm writing this review after my second time eating at Butter. My first time, in Dec. 2015, I came for brunch. It was not memorable at all except in that I was surprised to find the grits were at about Cracker Barrel standard. I figured, meh, she must be known for dinner and determined to come back next time I was in NYC Midtown and give it another try.  We just left Butter after dinner tonight and sadly everything I ordered was not to my taste. If the waiter had been even slightly helpful, I think our experience would have been completely different though. He literally looked like he hasn't smiled for weeks. )-,: The main-duck breast with sour cherries and baby boy choy was cooked technically very well, but it was really, really sour and I couldn't eat it. For dessert I ordered the guancillo and gingersnap ice cream sandwich. I had tried to ask the waiter if it was really spicy, or if the ice cream made it so it would be palatable even if I'm not used to very spicy food, but he just repeated the name written in the menu and looked irritated that I was asking anything about the menu at all. Neither of which he wanted to explain anything about or mention. I think he spoke a total of 10 words to us all night. If he'd even hinted that the ice cream was very spicy, or described the duck breast, I would have ordered something else and likely enjoyed the meal a lot more. We'd been walking a lot too and so we were thirsty, but no one ever refilled our iced teas. I'm just glad the coffee came out in a French press otherwise we probably never would have had anything to drink. The La Colombe coffee was great, btw.The other order was the halibut with lobster brudo and that was really tasty! We also ordered the gnocchi mac and cheese which was decent. (Not as good as Johnathon Waxman's at Jams the night before) Our starters were the lamb cavatappi and the veal bacon. The other dessert was the beignets with vanilla dipping sauce. It just seemed odd that the prices were actually equal or a bit more than Barbuto, Jams, Lamb's Club, etc. After tip we paid just under $200. We're big fans of Alex, and really wanted to like it. After this second less than impressive experience, we won't be going back.

2.0,6/30/2016,"I was very disappointed in the experience I just had. I'm rating the restaurant two stars only because this morning at breakfast their buffet was great, but having returned for dinner, I had a very different experience.   Otherwise I'd only be giving it one star. For dinner, I ordered the special after the waiter told me it was 2 1/2 pounds of lobster out of the shell, with fingerling potatoes in some sauce. He specifically told me it was an entire 2 1/2 pound lobster, and repeated this two or three times. Who wouldn't order that much lobster for $50?  So I ordered it.What was delivered was half of a regular lobster, out of the shell, on a bed of cut (fingerling?) potatoes. Since lobster is one of my favorites, and something I order often, I'm going to take an educated guess and say that maybe, before it was cut in half, this lobster weighed 2 pounds. But I was only served half the lobster, and the claw was a big portion and it and was inedible based on 1) it was not thoroughly cooked, and 2) it tasted extremely fishy.  So I ended up only being able to eat half a tail. The half lobster tail was good, the potatoes and sauce were very good. If we could could end there, I might not be upset. Since my meal ended up being so small (for $50!!!), I asked for more bread. As I was eating the bread, I felt a crunch. Sure enough, there was egg shell baked into the bread!!!!  A pretty good sized piece, too. This is a famous chef's restaurant. That is embarrassing!!!  It's a rookie move!I really try not to ever complain anywhere I go. You can read my other reviews as proof - they are most often positive. I hate complaining, but I had to. I told my waiter that my lobster was not what he described at all and that I chewed egg shell in my bread. He disappeared and the came back with the typical ""Our manager is going to comp you dessert"". Really?  You know, throwing sugar at people doesn't fix anything!  Especially for a person who doesn't eat sugar. So I declined. They could have comped my wine. They could have discounted my meal. But they didn't. I just had a bad experience and paid full price for it. So...if your staying at the Cassa hotel, breakfast at this restaurant (which is in the basement) is fine.

We let them know we were on our lunch break and to keep the courses flowing and they did. After we ordered they brought out bread for the table. This bread was sooo good. I really wanted more. The portions of all the courses were good, not too much but not too small. I felt satisfied not stuffed after I was done.",4,0,2,Ayesha A.,"Brooklyn, NY",361,436,700

Descend the stairs to their subterranean restaurant and you'll find yourself sipping on expertly crafted $17 cocktails and nibbling on oysters that will set you back $48 per dozen. That's... ridiculously expensive. But, hey! You're in midtown! That's what it's all about!The food really is impressive though. The tomahawk steak was expertly cooked and sliced for sharing as we asked. Nothing here would upset you as a diner. There's also a garden of the weather is compliant. A lovely opportunity to be outside and avoid the lunacy of midtowns rooftop bars. The people? It's on 45th street. It's expensive enough to keep tourists away.

2.0,6/4/2016,"Came here for my birthday because I'm a huge fan of Alex Guarnaschelli like everyone else is. I was a little skeptical going in because I heard the reviews were not that great. We went on a Sunday evening which was surprisingly empty and quiet. We sampled a few appetizers so that we could try a little bit of everything. We got the artichoke salad - which was literally like one artichoke with vinaigrette.The Veal bacon - which was lukewarm and too salty.Pasta with lamb sausage- which was good but average.The chile Octopus- was probably our favorite. Very tender and flavorful with cream and lentils on the bottom. For dessert we got the raspberry beignets because I remember Alex Guarnashelli saying that  one of her favorite desserts was beignets from New Orleans - so I had some high hopes. Low and behold, when it was brought to our table, the beignets were tepid and the vanilla bean dipping sauce had a nice long hair in the middle. We told our server who took it off our check (which was nice) but I was over it at that point.

I was not disappointed with my lunch there.The restaurant is in a beautiful underground space. The staff is top notch, both the host and the wait staff. The meal starts with rolls served warm with whipped butter. I'll never understand why so many restaurants serve cold rolls or hard butter. But Butter pays attention to detail and the rolls were a great start. For an appetizer I had the poached baby gulf shrimp. It was served with some kind of oil on top. A unique take on the shrimp appetizer and it was delicious. For an entrée I had the butter burger. This was no ordinary burger. It was perfectly cooked medium rare and was served with a bacon jam and a Monterey jack cheese fondue on the side. You spread the jam on the roll and pour the cheese all over the burger. I've never had this type of jam or chees on a burger. It was awesome! The perfectly crisp fries were an excellent compliment.Chef Alex is not just a TV chef trying to make money off of her fame while producing subpar restaurants (I'm looking at you Guy Fieri).

Waitress turned out to be not pleasant at all, pretty inattentive but most importantly rude at times (I felt I was treated like a ""special ed student"" - horrible!). I think her attitude really killed my mood to be in that place. But I wanted to try the food so we decided to ignore her stance. We started with drinks. I had Calamansi. Taste of watermelon and unique watermelon ice cubes were a nice twist, but the drink had little alcohol, and watered down fast. Husband had Breckenridge draft. He liked it. For apps we shared very tasty tuna tartar, would have been better if served with crostini; cavata pasta with spicy lamb sausage (just excellent), and mushroom and ricotta crostini (I'd appreciate the flavors better if crostini was thinner). For the entree we shared strip steak, cooked to perfection. As a side our waitress recommended gnocchi mac and cheese, and it was delicious however we could not appreciate it since we had cavata pasta right before, so I wished for a better recommendation from the waitress. By the time we were done with the food, I felt full, in fact too full, more like stuffed (not a good feeling). No room for anything else. I had to catch the waitress to order tea to settle the food down before we left. Forget the dessert (although the waitress seems not interested in offering that to us either).

I liked the fact that on a Saturday night we got a table without a reservation (although it was after 730 and before the real tourist season hit) unfortunately my like factor ended there. My drink was awesome but nothing on the menu said it was carbonated so I couldn't drink it, my husband enjoyed it though. I should have sent it back but he liked it so we kept it. I got 1/2 dozen raw oysters which were flavorless and the brine had been removed, who does that when shucking an oyster? The best part is the brine. They were sitting on a mound of ice which I think contributed to the blandness and lack of brine. The accoutrements were very good but that's about it with the oysters. My husband and I shared the veal bacon and lamb sausage cavatappi pasta. The veal bacon was smothered in a red wine mustard sauce that tasted like A-1 steak sauce and not in a good way. I think it was the amount of sauce they put on the bacon as I think the meat was actually pretty good, I just couldn't get past the taste of the sauce. The pasta was ok but nothing spectacular. We skipped dessert because I couldn't see paying $14 for something else to be disappointed in.

Our appetizer was very good we had warm spinach and nettle dip however it comes with four crumbled crackers which were very sweet and tasty but not enough to finish the dip with. To replace the leg of lamb my husband ordered a tuna tartare . It was very good but came with no crackers or toast points to eat it with just a plate of tuna tartare .

Inside, it's unlike most NYC restaurants. It's large, very open, and lots of wood paneling. It works for the space, and makes it feel intimate. Food/Drink - Definitely get the watermelon cocktail. If they weren't $17, I could have had 10. Gnocchi mac'n'cheese was excellent- highly recommended. For sure, SKIP the french fries: McDonald's is better. I got the NY strip for my main course, and while it was very good, it was not the best steak I've had. If I go again, I'll opt for the pork chop. Oh, and as good as it is, don't fill up on the bread prior to your meal. For me, it was irresistible.

I'd never tasted veal bacon before and it didn't disappoint. Don't expect to get strips of bacon, though - it was more of a small slab, eaten with a knife and fork, if that makes sense.I had the vegan cauliflower main dish and OMG. It was was unlike anything I've ever tasted before and I'd fly to New York to try it again. The sauce was unbelievably creamy, and for dairy-free, that's a huge accomplishment. They used coconut milk or coconut cream for the base and it was really lovely. I usually don't order vegetarian or vegan appetizers but I believe that a chef is truly only a great chef if he/she can make vegetable-based entrees taste even better than the meat-based main dishes.

Came on a Monday with my brother before meeting friends and were greeted by a really friendly host. The bartender however was rather brusque and inattentive. Had some cocktails and oysters, and then when our friends showed up we moved to our table, at which point the evening went downhill. The waiter handed us menus and immediately asked if we knew what we wanted for drinks. We asked to have a minute to go over the list and then did not see him again for a solid 15 minutes - we timed it. But we let that go and ordered our drinks and then our food. One person in our party is severely allergic to gluten and asked if the lamb dish was definitely gluten free. He took our order, said he would double check and get back to us, but instead put in our order and we didn't see him again until well after the food was served. The runner who brought the food was polite but we mentioned that we were waiting for confirmation on the lamb dish being gluten free, so he went back to the kitchen, and again we waited about ten minutes not eating because we didn't want to start without her. After that we were basically rushed out. The waiter brought one dessert menu and as we were discussing if we wanted dessert he put the check down and said goodnight - before we were even certain we didn't want dessert! All in all it was disappointing, especially because I'm a big fan of Alex G. But the food was fine if not underwhelming. NY steak was quite tough, but the mashed potatoes and fried mushrooms on the chicken dish were tasty, as was the octopus.

When we came in, we checked in to the desk and they told us they were finishing up their pre-shift meeting and would be with us shortly. We didn't wait long at all before they seated us at a nice round booth with a great view of the restaurant - I thought it was decorated beautifully. Our server was very nice and attentive. The rolls with the sea salt were WONDERFUL. Very fluffy, and the two butters (a sour cream butter [I think?] and herbed butter) were very tasty. There was also a crusty loaf that was sliced which I thought was nice as well.For an appetizer, we had the potato croquettes that were stuffed with chorizo on a harissa sauce; the sauce was to die for, and the potato croquettes were very good. They were just a right size for an appetizer, as it wasn't too much or too heavy for our following meal.For my entree, I had the crispy scattered acres farms chicken and it was a WONDERFUL choice. The chicken was incredibly juicy and the breading on it was so flavorful and adhered nicely to the chicken - it did not flake off everywhere. It was on a bed of the creamiest and most buttery mashed potatoes I've ever had, and was topped with sauteed mushrooms and a mushroom gravy. When I say this was one of the best meals I've ever had, I'm not kidding. It was so home-y and comforting and filled with so much flavor.My friend had the pan-roasted Long Island fluke with peas and a brown butter sauce. I tried a bite and the sauce was amazing - very rich with a nice touch of citrus that cut through the richness and paired nicely with the fish. The peas were very fresh and had a nice bite to them - not the slightest bit mushy.Overall, this was a wonderful evening and the food was delicious.

The mustard sauce added a nice kick of flavor. I have to rave about the bread and butter bc it was delish. The bread roll was flaky and soft and coupled with the warm butter, it was a piece of heaven in your mouth. I got the steak strip and although the char top was good, the steak was still a bit chewy although I ordered it medium. The white bean puree on the bottom was interesting different. My husband got the leg of lamb and it was actually deboned. The sauce was a curry sauce with corn and salsa. it was like tex-mex met indian and it didnt have a good meeting.

I'm not sure if that's what they were going for, but everything from plating to taste just seemed incredibly uninspired. Similarly salted, similarly acidic, and the garnishing copout on both entree fishes were far too reminiscent of each other. I actually enjoyed my fairly boring meal. I'm not sure if that's the result of spending too much time in rural Indiana, where a decently prepared meal, much less seafood, is practically nonexistent, or if it would have been enjoyable under normal conditions as well.

5.0,3/3/2016,"WOOOW! This place is a MUST!!!! It's been on my yelp list for longest time and luckily I got treated out to this place, and I thank that person greatly! My managers and I were trying to make last minute reservations for 9 and this place luckily took us and without a credit card for reservations. They were  accommodating and friendly and the vibes in this place was ahhmazing! Once you walk in its an intimate dark lighting with stairs going down and the place was surrounded by dark wood with the bar in the middle of the restaurant. We grabbed drinks while we waited and I ordered the Calamansi which had watermelon ice cubes with lime juice and a mint leaf (forgot what the alcohol in it was) but it had a great tart taste to it because of the lime and once the watermelon ice cube started to melt it made the drink a bit sweet and complimented really well with the lime and the mint leaf! (around $20 with tip) Finally sat down and this unusual shaped booth like a J almost but it made it easier for waiters to serve without having to reach over and easier for us to get up and talk or hear the waitress speak. There was also complimentary bread and two sets of butter, there was a regular plain butter and then another one that seem to have some type of green herb or somethign in the second one but apparently this place made its own butter? Not sure if im totally correct about that but the second one with the green herb was refreshing. Both butters really were, it wasn't like the  ""I can't believe its not butter"" type of taste to it, something about it was fresh and just yummy! For appetizers we had the cavatappi pasta, grilled octopus, veal cut bacon and a mushroom dish with fresh mozzerella i believe. All the appetizers were delicious especially the cavatappi pasta and the grilled octopus! The octopus was cooked perfectly without it being chewy or too under, it bit right off once you take a bite and thats something I always look for when I go to restaurants and they serve grilled seafood. It also tasted amazing, and the people who aren't usually into seafood loved it too. The taste of ginger and citrus just brought out the taste of the octopus The veal-cut bacon was a bit fatty for me but I understand that, the fact is what makes it taste amazing and it was a thick cut as well so 5 pieces was enough to satisfy us all. The cavatappi pasta everyone can agree on was the best and this place is known mainly for their pork chop (which I will get to later) and this appetizer. The pasta was cooked perfectly of course and had like its own bounce to it, like its own bite. It had lamb sausage in it and had a hint of spice which wasn't over powering but a nice kick where it didn't kill you to eat one more bite and thats what we all did. For entree I had the butter poached lobster, and others had either the pork chop or the steak. The butter poached lobster was served on a roundish bowl and had four chunks of lobster claws and the tail in it. The lobster was perfectly taken out of the claw with the claws intact and same with the tail and was placed on top of eachother with a bed of spinach or some type of greens under it. Most of the time I am put off by things that are too buttery but this time it wasn't. The butter wasn't only melted butter but was combined with other things that didn't make the buttery taste of it over powering where you can still taste the natural sea from the seafood if you guys reading this understand what I mean by that. Everything was so refine and the chef knew how to use different flavors and spices to incorporate it into the dish.The lobster was rich in flavor from the butter but chef let it speak for itself as well.  It was probably one of the best things I have had since I started this yelp venture to restaurants.   I didn't taste the pork chop but my manager said that the sides that were with the pork chop left him speechless (in a good way) and he had never tasted anything like it and it was this cream of some green vegie (forgot). All the meats that were served were in large portions that were worth the money. Unfortunately I was too full to order any desserts but I will definitely be back for seconds and leave some room for dessert. I would love to try their second floor where it seems to have an outside venue, not sure about that though. The waitress was super sweet and took her time letting us decide what we wanted and was helpful with any questions. The staff was very attentive to refilling our glasses and seeing if we needed more drinks. Overall it was a wonderful experience and I enjoyed every bit of it. This place is mainly occupied by tons of business people and partners. Before writing this review I looked at others and saw that it was actually Alex Guarnaschelli's restaurant, no wonder it was nothing short of amazing.

2.0,2/15/2016,"We made a reservation at Butter for our inaugural trip to NYC. Being fans of chef Alex Guarnaschelli, this was a must! The atmosphere was not what we expected, though not a bad thing. The restaurant is dark and located in a basement. The decor is more like a bar, very masculine. Casual music playing pretty loud over the speakers throughout our meal, it was more like a pub than a restaurant. For starters, the menu selection was much smaller than we were expecting. About six entrees to choose from, ranging from $30-$60 with a tomahawk ribeye for 2 at $120. It was burger and wine night (fun!) which was $24 burgers and half price bottles of wine. We had the burgers (a duck burger and a short rib burger) and they were delicious. The duck burger was one of the best entrees we have had ever! We also had the appetizer of tuna tartare (B-) and dessert of the beignets (C.) The good news stops there. The service was horrible. First, our food arrived with some errors. Second, it was 34 minutes from the time our dessert was delivered to when we saw our server again. Once we finally got our ticket, I was shocked to see I was charged for a refill on an iced tea ($6) which I never ordered and clearly never took a drink of. It sat full on the table. Our server had a poor attitude and was very abrasive, so we didn't mention it. In all of our NYC restaurant experiences this was overall just okay food, paired with the absolute worst service experience. Vitae and The Smith Midtown come to mind as examples of restaurants where we enjoyed exceptional service along with delicious food. We won't be back, and I can't recommend this restaurant.

2.0,2/15/2016,"I have worked in the hospitality industry for almost ten years and I understand how restaurant week can be crazy and completely vexing. However, I was disappointed in the service at Butter. I came in with my girlfriend and the host smiled and took us to our table. Our server was friendly but definitely gave off the vibe that she did not want to be there. Unfortunately, it was difficult to see past my menu with the extremely dim lighting. I wanted to be wowed by the decor but perhaps if we ate during the day that would've been possible. I could barely see my girlfriend's face as we spoke. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't spectacular. Honestly, my family can cook what is on the menu and add much more flavor and love to the entrees. I had a mushroom soup which was favorable and an entree with pork and I believe baby potatoes. Again, it wasn't horrible but it wasn't great. I will say that I was overjoyed by the rolls, yes, I said rolls. They actually reminded me of my grandmother's home rolls so thumbs up to that!We both ordered different desserts, mine being the dark chocolate layer cake and her's the butterscotch custard. The cake was heaven! The hint of spice definitely gave it a kick and reminded me of flamenco dancers for some reason. My girlfriend's dessert was a flop. It was way too sweet and the texture reminded me of Sugar, Honey, Iced Tea. ;) Halfway through our dessert our plates, silverware and condiments were snatched off the table aggressively.

3.0,2/7/2016,"Butter Midtown, I so wanted to love you completely and fully, but sadly it didn't make me melt. Instead of writing a cohesive review I am going to follow an a la carte approach similar to the way the dining experience is structured here:- I do like the decor of this place with its varying wood and leather tones throughout, appropriately dim lighting, and with a large green forest image wall makes it come together for an intimate dining space. The best seating for dining are the booths that surround the space.- The ""Tall, Dark, and Handsome"" cocktail was a revelation! Made with Woodford reserve bourbon, chocolate bitters, stout beer and carpano antica came together to form a transformed Manhattan in a frothy, bubbly cocktail that added a rich depth of flavors. My wife loved the Old Empire City, but I was in too much awe of my drink to notice. - The grilled octopus served inky black with nova chiles on a bed of black lentils and ginger yogurt topped with zests of citrus made for complex flavors that ticked all the flavor boxes. It was delicious to be sure, but I prefer a simple grilled, lemon and olive oil approach that lets the octopus shine.- The cavatappi pasta, the oldest mainstay on the menu is incredible so it is easy to see why it is a favorite - perfectly prepared pasta, sweet tomato sauce and rich lamb sausage with a bit of spice. Fantastic.- There was a LONG wait between the smaller plates and our large plate. Luckily we had plenty of time before our show. (I did see another diner visibly upset complain to the hostess about their long wait for their order as well.)- I liked that they had half bottles of wine available. We ordered a Sauvignon Blanc ""Shooting Star"" with our shared large plate that worked well with our halibut.- The halibut came with a side of arugula and broth served on the side that is meant to be poured over the dish, but the server didn't mention (perhaps because it is so obvious). Unfortunately the halibut was over done, but the rest of the dish had nice subtle, well balanced flavor. - Not knowing what to expect from the ruby chard and crispy chickpea dish it was a bit disappointing that this is served cold and a little too acidic for my taste. Should have asked the server about this before ordering - my bad!- The desserts were good the raspberry beignets, are little jelly donuts dusted with granulated sugar and a vanilla dipping sauce - very nice and seeming simple because it was done well. The butterscotch custard was topped with crispy crumbled cookies and a bit of fruit was very rich, but I could have done without the fruit addition. The service overall was very good and attentive, but I would have liked to seen better pacing for the meal - the wait for the large plate was too long and our server acknowledged the fact. It was also surprising to see it so slow (pacing and empty tables) on a Saturday night, but we are just coming off restaurant week, and it is Feb so that may explain it. On a whole, the meal was very pricey and it is obvious there is an Alex Guarnaschelli ""celebrity tax"", because the pacing and preparation of some plates do need work and do not match the quality you would expect for the price.",15,5,10,Mike S.,"Long Island, NY",658,662,3101

Chocolate cake dessert was ok - not sure why bit the outer edge of the cake was very hard though it didn't taste burned.

The butternut squash pasta tasted good but was very, very al dente. Butterscotch custard had a cloying, artificial taste. Probably worst of all was our server. He was very awkward, which made for an uncomfortable dining experience (didn't introduce himself, had to be promoted for the specials, timing for ordering was totally off, robotic demeanor with no personality, etc.). I told him we wanted to leave by 6:30 to catch a 7:00 show and he was nowhere to be seen from 6:00 onwards. When I finally caught him for the check, he had circled the ""suggested tip amount"" section, which I think is completely tasteless.

4.0,2/2/2016,"From watching Chopped, I've been meaning to try Butter for awhile and finally made it here for Restaurant Week dinner ($38). We were seated promptly for our reservation on a Friday night. The interior is beautiful with lots of wood and also very spacious. Service was quick and attentive. What we ordered:1) Appetizers: Mussels saffron soup & Brussels sprouts crostini- Both of these were delicious! The soup was creamy and smooth, and the crostini had a nice blend of textures with the crunchy sprouts and the whipped spread.2) Entrees: Pan-seared salmon w/ lemon caper sauce & Pork shank- The salmon was cooked well, not dry at all though the lemon caper sauce was a tad overwhelming.- The pork was juicy and fell right off the bone. Preferred this over the fish.3) Desserts: Butterscotch custard & Chocolate layer cake- Weakest part of the meal. Had high hopes for the butterscotch custard, but the flavor was really intense. It tasted better after I ate some of the chocolate cake to balance it out. The cake was good but nothing special.The ingredients were all fresh, and flavor combinations were unique.

2.0,2/2/2016,"My boyfriend chose this spot during restaurant week for the dinner service. Good location, easy for both of us to get to after work on a Friday. We had reservations for 6. I arrived 10 minutes early, checked in and was told that I could have a seat until the rest of my party arrived. I could also check my coat. No problem. So far so good. On to dinner.    Honestly, the restaurant week menu was a little meh for me. To begin, we opted to add on a bottle of wine with our meal. Fresh dinner rolls with butter were brought to our table after we decided on our options. I had the roasted brussel sprout crostini as an appetizer, and it was quite tasty. Light and flavorful. My boyfriend had the soup of the day, I believe it was a mushroom soup and it was really excellent. I really thought things would go uphill from there. How wrong I was. The salmon that I ordered barely had any taste at all as it lay sadly on a bed of greens. I would have been upset about the miniscule size of the salmon EXCEPT that I could barely finish it and I really don't believe in wasting calories.    The dessert, at least I'm my opinion, was a very slight improvement. I had the dark chocolate layer cake which was ok. Nothing to write home about, a little dry, but definitely more taste than the salmon. The butterscotch custard which my boyfriend chose was absolutely horrid, in my humble opinion. Just ugh. Avoid at all costs.   I love restaurant week because it really gives me an opportunity to try new places with an eye for adding them to my regular go to spots for a night out.

I really liked how everything is laid out and they have some comfortable couches if you're waiting for the rest of your party to show up.  We were a group of 5 and the we got a comfy booth. We all pretty much ordered the same thing from the restaurant week menu. I got the brussel sprouts crostini, salmon and chocolate cake for dessert. As other reviews have mentioned the bread here is pretty good but I wasn't blown away by it.  The brussel sprouts crostini had a weirdly sweet taste that was a bit off putting to me.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and I really enjoyed the sauce that came with it.  The portions here are very tiny and the side was basically a miniscule amount of greens that came with the salmon. The plates used for our main course were these cheap looking flower plates that I would find in an old lady's house,  this might seem like a petty issue but I just thought it was a huge contrast to the overall opulence of the restaurant. Plus the plates highlighted just how tiny these portions were!  I tried both butterscotch and the chocolate one and hands down the chocolate one was the winner.

It was not too sweet, not too sour, not too strong, just the perfect mix of flavors. For my appetizer, I had the soup of the day - an extremely creamy mushroom soup, and my goodness, it was AMAZING! If I could have had this for my entire meal, I absolutely would. It also went perfectly with the complementary buttery rolls. For my main entree, I ordered the braised short ribs (originally pork shank on the menu but was substituted). Rather than multiple short ribs, it was just one big slap of meat. It was certainly very tender, but the flavors were not infused very well into the meat. Finally, for dessert I had the butterscotch custard. It was literally like sipping on butterscotch. Delicious, but a little too overwhelmingly sweet for me to finish by myself. For a nice restaurant, the service was only average at best. Our waiter took a long time scrutinizing our IDs when we tried to order cocktails (guess we all have baby faces?), and he definitely did not send the right vibe doing that.

Dinner at 6:30pm on a Wednesday; we (three of us) were seated right away, although the place was definitely full. Surprisingly tasty bread with butter and herb butter were set down, along with a communal bowl of salt. After one of my cohorts dug his fingers into the salt, I didn't want to touch it. Yuk! Service was pleasant, drinks were a little slow. If you like Bourbon, don't have their ""Tall Dark & Handsome"" Bourbon drink. But do have the Holy Basil! For an appetizer I ordered the tomato soup. It wasn't bad, but still just tomato soup. Main course, I had the fresh Lumache pasta (butternut squash & brown butter). Good God it was delicious! I tasted the tobacco-smoked double cut pork chop. Also, incredible. Dessert: Dark chocolate layer cake. Meh. I wish I hadn't ended with it. I didn't even bother after two bites. Nothing special, and actually a little dry.

I went on a trip to NYC to basically eat and see shows. This was one of the restaurants that I'd scoped out in advance, mostly because Alex Guarnaschelli just seems fantastic. We sat down and ordered drinks ($18 / cocktail, eep, but it was good). Unfortunately the beer that my date ordered was out, and then when he ordered another draft, the server came back and said that all the beers were warm...what? We started with the cavatappi pasta to share, then I got the pork chop and he got the fried chicken. The pasta was fine in a whatever tomato sauce, but the lamb sausage in it was to-die. I wish they had a standalone app of just the sausage. The pork chop was a little tough, but the brussel sprouts it came with were really good. The chicken was great, and I wished I'd ordered it, but didn't come with much of a side. We opted for no dessert, but I got a cappuccino and I think it was legitimately the best part of the meal. Maybe the best cappuccino I've ever had. Generally our server was more interested in flirting with the hostess than making sure we were taken care of, but the water guy was fantastic. Promote him to a waiter position!! The space was also nice - large and dim lighting on the bottom level of a brand new hotel.Overall it was fine, and maybe I'd go back if I lived in NYC, but it just wasn't special enough for a destination dinner.",5,1,0,Renee G.,"Dallas, TX",56,88,3
5.0,1/16/2016,"There's a reason why I keep coming back to Butter Midtown. I love everything about this place. The food, the ambiance, and the service are all wonderful. On Thursday I had Butter's Sneak Peak lunch menu (I think it's the same food during RW but it just opened up a couple of days earlier). tldr; if i were to do this again I would order:1. Soup of the day (Mussel Soup)2. Fish of the Day (Skate)3. Frozen Dark Chocolate Whoopie Pie, Candied PecansI ordered the smoked salmon tartare, grilled skate (fish of the day), and apple crisp for dessert. My friend ordered the mussel soup (soup of the day), short rib ravioli, and whoopie pie dessert.First Course:The salmon tartare was good but not incredible. It was very fishy tasting (think tuna fish texture but with salmon). It mixed a bunch of interesting flavors (apple, shallot, celery) but overall I wasn't that impressed by it (the other dishes I've had here set the bar very high). My friend had the mussel soup and THAT was tasty. The mussel soup was broth-y but felt very wholesome. With every sip you had a mix of warm flavors complemented by some soft bits of carrots and other vegetables. My friend described it as dish ""Grandma would make,"" which of course is the highest compliment. You could tell that a lot of thought went into this soup. It was delightful and perfectly balanced.Main Course:OH MAN, the skate (fish of the day) was amazing. I love fish and I've never had skate before so I thought I would try it. The skate was cooked to perfection on a bed of warm greens. The fish melted in your mouth and was flaky and everything I could've asked for. There were hints of lime juice and balsamic that initially surprised me, but what an adventure! My friend ordered the short rib ravioli and that was good too but when compared to the skate, the ravioli fell short. On its own, the ravioli was yummy but a little ordinary. Dessert:I ordered the braeburn apple crisp with toasted cinnamon ice cream. I didn't really like this dessert as much as I did the rest of my meal. The apple crisp was too sweet to the point that it irritated the back of my throat. There's a coat of brown sugar on top that you have to break through to get to the apples underneath. Overall, it was too sweet. The tiny ice cream scoop on top was fine. The dark chocolate whoopie pie summed up in one word: WOW! This was chocolate galore and I loved every bite of it. Savory and scrumptious. Oh, and I should put in a word for our waiter. I don't remember his name but he is very tall (sorry, not a good description). The service is great. It's not enough to say that he was attentive because he was of course attentive, but also just sweet without being overbearing. Alex Guarnaschelli and I attended the same undergraduate college (Barnard) and I asked if the chef was in today (I am dying to meet her). When he came back to let me know that she was not at the restaurant, he brought back an autographed card that Alex signed. HOW SWEET! I absolutely adore Butter.

As a fan of the chefs on the food network, many of their restaurants have been on our ""to do"" list. This time it was Butter. There are no words to describe our disappointment. Our party of 4 dined on a Sunday evening at 8 o'clock. To begin with, our waiter was rude and completely disinterested on serving us. In addition, there were several items (on an already limited menu) that were unavailable. The two appetizers we ordered were unimpressive. Both couples ordered the tomahawk steak for two. The waiter returned to inform us (in a very unpleasant tone) that there was only one steak remaining. How do you run out of THE most expensive thing on your menu? At that point we were so disgusted with the waiter's attitude we should have asked for our check and left. Further entree decisions had to be made (unfortunate, but not a big deal). There was some indecision, at which point the waiter had the audacity to ask us ""yes or no"" on our choice. Beyond the horrible manners, service was unbelievably slow for a restaurant that was mostly empty. The food was very mediocre and the portions small. An entree of cauliflower was ordered for the table to share. While it was the best thing we ate all evening, it was not entree sized and at $23, rather laughable.

To save you some reading, the two stars are not for the food, but for the service. Our wait was horrible. I wish I could remember his name. I am not sure what we said or did to make him so disinterested in the dinner, but I'm sorry for whatever it was. We were all catching up and ready to enjoy a longer meal. We wanted to put in our appetizers first. He was very mean and rude and literally told us no. We could not do that, then threatened that the rest of the dinner would take forever if we insisted in putting in our appetizers first then ordering our mains. Well, this is what we did anyways. The food came out in a relatively quick manner so I am not sure what he was talking about. He did bring us the wrong appetizer though. I suggest in stead of trying to remember the order, just write it down if you have to. The next flub was with our main entrees. He just flat out just didn't bring us two the dishes we order. Then, my fiancé's mom asked three times, two different people for olive oil and vinegar that never came. Really poor form for such a promising restaurant. Like I said, this is mostly about the horribly poor service we received, the food that did make it to our table was pretty good. We started with several appetizers:Bread and butter that comes to the day should have been the highlight, but no. The butter tasted like nothing, bland. I can name an awesome restaurant in Chicago that can school on different flavors of butter, I should put the chef's in contact (I am an not strictly talking about Alex, because I know she is not back in that kitchen every night). We ordered the Crostini (not sure which one because their menu up front is different than the menu in the restaurant which might be different than the menu on-line), but I guess when you as for a Crostini that means you get a Shell Pasta and Grilled Octopus. Burraa was next, I liked the burrata I left the others eat the unnecessary fluff that accompanied it.The Roasted Carrots were pretty good, they looked like asparagus, but once you get passed that, they were light and flavorful. For our entrees, several of us went for the Halibut. We asked for the bacon on the side, and I am really really surprise they obliged. I enjoyed the amount of fish and mushrooms that came with it. Also at the table was the Slow Poached Main Lobster. My fiancé did say this was the best lobster he has had in awhile. So cudos to Butter on that one.

2.0,10/10/2015,The service here is lacking. The butter they served tasted like refrigerator.My drink came with a lovely shade of red lipstick. (I was not wearing red lipstick ) I will admit they did replace but I'm almost 100% if I wasn't looking directly at them they probably would've just dumped it into another glass. The salad I had was good-ish. A little too acidic for even my taste. The two stars are for the rolls and pasta which were DIVINE. The hostess lying to me initially is what started off the downhill path. They really are trying to cater to the tourist crowd not the lowly New Yorker that knows better.

3.0,10/1/2015,I brought clients here tonight. Service was underwhelming. Very little knowledge about the wine list. Appetizers were okay. We had the buratta and fried green tomato crostini. Hated the spicy pickled toppings with the buratta. It wasn't a good combination imo. Lobster and Branzino entrees were the highlight. The lobster was amazing. Buttery and soft. Perfectly cooked! And the sides on the plate of the lobster were delicious.  Gnocchi was underwhelming. Escarole was nasty.  Oversalted and inedible imo. We got the tomahawk to share with the table and I was extremely disappointed. It was downright gross.  We had it cooked medium rare. The entire piece was all fat. I took one bite and it completely destroyed the amazing lobster flavor that lingered. It tasted rancid. Everyone at the table agreed. The waitress tried to explain to us that it was the marbeling.  Umm. I'm Japanese.  My people created Kobe beef. I get marbeling.  And I get rib eye. This was just a shameful piece of (fat).  Will I come back? Not unless Alex is there cooking herself. That shit would not fly if she was there!,0,0,0,Christine S.,"New York, NY",24,70,0
4.0,9/30/2015,"When fangirl hits New York she always has a celeb chef restaurant on her bucket list.  I stayed across from Auerole but my client meeting much to my happiness was across the street from Butter.  Higher on the bucket list as I'm a super fan and follower of Alex G.  Girl Power. I was all by my lonesome so I opted to sit at the bar.  After reviewing the menu and agonizing over my choice I asked the bartender/server what came with the Halibut.  I'm not sure if he didn't understand English or what but he just walked away and made two drinks.  He came back and said ""It comes with whatever it says on the menu"".   So a.) clearly he heard me when I asked and b.) how hard would Alex G cringe if she knew an employee said that!  Granted he was at the bar but if you are going to have a full service bar, shouldn't they know the menu?  It's not like it's hard to memorize, it's not 48 pages like the cheesecake factory.  So that was a bit off putting but I ordered it anyway, rolling the dice I'd like what it had on the plate.  Then............the bread!  O.M.G the bread that comes with the salt on top (see pics) is UN.REAL.  First off I only eat bread if it's worthy because I'm a low carb life gal and I'm telling you, this bread is on my ""Give up the dream"" ""Bust the Buttons"" list.  It was warm, and buttery, and soft and airy, and was made with heaven and dreams and angels. Halibut arrived and it was ok. It was a pinch overcooked.  The bacon broth was good (I mean how can bacon broth not be good) but there was some component of the dish that was a little to pungent for my taste.  I couldn't put my buds on it but it held it back from being a 4+ star dish.  The gorgeous decor and that bread and butter yall is what I loved about this place.  There is also a garden area that is open in good weather that is just enchanting. Visit that for drinks! All in all, very pleased I came to visit my girl Alex G's place and I think you'll enjoy yourself as much as this fangirl did.",14,9,10,Madi F.,"Round Rock, TX",615,368,1775
2.0,9/20/2015,"While this is probably my favorite restaurant in NYC, a hugely disappointing interaction with the Butter manager this evening has left me angry and very unhappy.To preface, I am a huge fan of chef Alex, and this is my 3rd time at Butter. I've had the pleasure of coming here on several recent trips to NYC and have had a 5 star experience. This evening, the food was absolutely delightful, as always, but the service was atrocious. Throughout the course of our roughly 80 minute meal, we were passed off between 3 different servers. The first greeted us, took our drink order and later placed our dinner order. By the time our food came out, we were ready to get another round of drinks, and he was MIA. Around this time, someone else came by to check on on us, however he never told us that we was our new server and 20 mins went by as we waited for our original server to come by to order more drinks. When I finally asked the other guy about it, he gave us a line about he was the ""closing waiter"" and our initial waiter was just there to get us started. Um, ok??? I've been here before. That's not how this works. And how come you didn't tell me that, as I'm sitting here waiting to speak with our original server? As we were getting done eating, we were inexplicably passed off to another server. At least this time, we were told, but really?? 3 servers over the course of one meal??At this point, I asked to speak to the manager to discuss our frustrations with the service. In speaking to the manager, he was rude, defensive and argumentative with me. He stated that, unfortunately that is how he chose to cut severs that night, and because we had a late reservation (9pm), that's just what happens. I was appalled by how stubborn he was, and he wasn't even willing to understand my frustration with service and for some points of our meal, not even knowing who was taking care of us. The manager was completely unapologetic and never once acknowledged how the decision to cut servers affected our meal and experience at the restaurant. At the end, he begrudgingly offered to comp my glass of wine. It was one of the most frustrating and disappointing interactions I've ever had with a manager. I just couldn't believe he was so firm in his decision to but servers that he didn't even care how it affected the guest. This whole experience has left such a bad taste it my mouth. Butter went from being my favorite restaurant to a place I may not return. The weird/poor service is one thing, but to be completely dismissed by manager is something completely different.",9,0,0,Christie M.,"Chicago, IL",19,138,3

1.0,9/15/2015,So disappointed. I was visiting dear friends on August 17 and they took me here  and I was so excited when I realized I was at this iron chef's restaurant. We only ordered drinks and apps and noted the server was unhappy about this immediately. She wasn't a good server to begin with - no personality and could hardly hear her. I ordered the shrimp app for 23$ and got three small shrimp on top of dried circles of cucumber and a fourth shrimp that looked like it just fell in between the others. The shrimp itself was delicious but dried cucumber stacks.....I  could make that at home! I expected SO much more and would never return.

3.0,9/8/2015,"This was underwhelming. In the city for a few nights, and didn't have dinner plans. Hungry, we opted to go here because it's not too far, had had a reco before, and, it's an Alex G restaurant, so, we felt good it was a decent choice for a last minute pick. In short - food was good, service was mediocre, ambiance was just ok. Our waiter while I'm sure was a very nice person, had the personality and presence of a limp handshake. He was very tentative, didn't say much, came to our table and looked at us as if we should already be aware of what he was needing. It was odd, and didn't put our visit out on the right foot.Food - here's what we got:Mushroom tart appetizer - this was pretty good, great flavors, though a little cold as it it had been sitting out too long before making it to our table.Florida Shirmp tart appetizer - again good flavors, but also seemed like it had been sitting out for awhile before making it to us. Beef Filet - tasty, very well cooked, served over a shortrib with some herbs and pickled onions. Well done. This was the only main we could agree on to order, and it was solid. Burrata Salad - this was tasty, good flavors, but the burrata wasn't set up properly. When we cut into it, it had a thick skin with cream that oozed out. Tasted good, just not quite executed right. I understand that they do not make the burrata in house. Gnocchi Mac and Cheese side - yummy, light and delicate little gnocchi. I will say that our waiter did provide complimentary prosecco after our appetizers took quite awhile to come out, which was very nice. However, overall, the service was just very odd. We couldn't find our waiter when we needed him, when he was there it was a little awkward. I do appreciate the gesture of the wine, however. All in all, this was just OK.

4.0,9/2/2015,"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday (which happened to fall on a day during restaurant week) after years of planning to come.We are both HUGE, i mean HUGE, fans of Alex Guarnaschelli (she replied to my tweet after the meal which was such a pleasant surprise) so this was really exciting for us.We decided to try some appetizers and cocktails on top of picking courses from the RW menu.To start we had oysters (not sure if 6 or a dozen) and the tuna tartare. Both were good, but I thought the tuna tartare should have had avocado under it instead of cucumber because it took away from the rich, creaminess it usually has and came off cold and lacking. It was pretty though (pretty damn small, too, for $24). Off the RW menu I had: spicy shrimp a la plancha, which was really firey but tasty, the braised short rib ravioli, which was one of my favorite dishes of the night (orange marmalade- BRILLIANT), and the chocolate dessert which wasn't my favorite but it was good.The star of the night was the escarole which we got on the side. My BF and I love escarole so much and Chef Guarnaschelli's was the best I've ever had, BAR NONE.I asked Chef G over twitter what was in it that made it so good (my guesses would have been soy sauce or beef broth, something ""umami"") but she claims it is chili flake, lemon, salt and ""la passion"" which must be code for something else because I put all those in my escarole at home and it never tastes like that dish of heaven. Another guess would be that the escarole was grilled or charred prior to serving. It was swimming in a puddle of flavorful brown liquid. I tried a cocktail in the secret garden but sadly can't remember what it was. In the restaurant I had a cherry blossom and it was a masterpiece of mixology.Can't wait to go back someday and try more things off the regular menu. The decor was lovely, mostly dark wood, and had a wonderful dim, cozy ambiance while still being enormous enough to seat the massive dinner rush they had, even on a Weds night.

Restaurant was not crowded and we were able to be sat 15 minutes before our reservation. Our waiter came over and asked what kind of water we would like. After we told him we may have waited 5 minutes to be served it at which time we were also given a bread basket. The bread was good and the scallion butter was a nice touch but nothing to rave about. At this point we still have not ordered our meal. Finally our waiter comes back and we order half a dozen oysters, the short rib raviolis and the branzino with a side of potatoes. The oysters came out rather quickly and were each labeled from where they came from. They were good but nothing to go crazy over. I've had way better for half the price.

Not sure why the manager didn't come over himself or why it took our waiter an hour to notice something was up. Our food came out a few minutes later. The highlight of the meal were the potatoes. I can't remember what they were seasoned with but they were good. The branzino was good as were the short rib raviolis but again, nothing to rave about.

The fish of the day was salmon which he was really excited about because that's his favorite fish to eat. That salmon was cooked beautifully. Flaky inside with the crispest fish skin ever.

At one point, the server was holding our plates while he stood watching the game. The bacon appetizer was more of a pork belly and it was sumptuous and delicious. My pork chop was tender and juicy and served with a surprising, tangy mustard sauce. We loved it.

For appetizers we had the veal bacon, clams, and bibb lettuce, I couldn't get enough of the dressing on the veal and on the salad. For her meal my mother ordered two small plates, the  burrata and cavatappi pasta which were both delicious- along with the hot/fresh bread. I had the gnocchi mac and cheese which was amazingly rich, but not too filling. My sister had the roasted chicken, which she loved as it was moist and flavorful with a crisp but not overdone  skin. For dessert we loved the frozen toasted mallomar, beignets, and the cake of the day which was triple chocolate and heavenly- all with delicious espresso.

4.0,7/11/2015,"Twas the night of July 9th when I dined at Butter Midtown. As I walked through the exhilarating, modern entrance, I could contain my yearning for butter no longer. My hunger was fierce, almost mesmerizing; memories of checking my satchel slipped through my fingers like the dirty dirty sand of an Atlantic City beach. Party of three we were that night, eager to find our seats and experience BUTTER. My old fickle friend Mr. Service, however, ensured it would not be that easy. Alas! We finally make it to our seats, without a second to spare. My appies, praise BUTTER, were worth the trouble. Charcuterie, the devilish fiend hardly worth spelling let alone ordering, surprised my taste buds. Soft Shell Crab, kind sir, you won the night, as you and your sides screamed butter to me in the purest of ways. Here in our story, friends, is where butter makes a turn for the worst. Pork Chops, oh pork chops, where art thou? An eternity passed in my soul and stomach before their arrival. But my oh my, these pork chops. Thick as an oak, enveloped in spicy and sweet. Pork Chops, my how you saved the day. As we pay our check, I can sense trouble a' brewin.   Our check, so lonely and sad, was paid no attention to as it lay bare on our table. I could not bear to wait another minute, as I leave to let my companions handle the trouble. The debacle continues, even today, as they overcharged us with the bill of another.

2.0,7/6/2015,"Total disappointment. Prix Fixe lunch overpriced for what it was. Burgers ordered medium arrived WAY past well done.

If you can't cook a twenty something dollar hamburger to order, you should work in fast food, not fine dining. Manager agreed ""to tell the general manager and pass comments along to kitchen.""  To be fair, server offered to have burgers redone, but we declined to not make a day of it. Then, he must have retired at some point during the meal. $6 for an iced tea refill?!?  Seriously?  I had high expectations I suppose and they were woefully unfulfilled.  Veal bacon was good as appetizer, but a distant memory by the time we left.",0,0,0,Jim K.,"Toledo, OH",0,13,7

The crispy/buttery rolls & Veal Bacon appetizer were super yummy. My Roasted Chicken was crispy and moist and very flavorful. Hubby had the Beef Filet, (medium rare of course), and it was perfect. This Filet will definitely be my dinner choice on our next visit - soooo good and melts in your mouth. We both really enjoyed the Gnocchi Mac & Cheese. It was creamy with a nice crisp topping. We shared the dessert special which was an awesome dark chocolate creamy ice cream cake drizzled with fresh raspberries.  The perfect ending to the meal was a great French press coffee for my hubby and a wonderful frothy cappuccino!

We made a reservation for brunch before heading to a Sunday matinee show.  Arrived to a beautifully decorated, earthy and warm environment.  We were seated promptly.  I enjoyed the Bloody Mary served with a radish and onion.  We ordered the basket of pastries and I think I was in heaven!!  Served warm, with regular butter, and olive oil herb butter and a marmalade. The hubby and I enjoyed this basket immensely!!  If I had to pick my favorite out of the basket it would have been the scone. Just perfectly made.  Other items included a cheddar biscuit and other various muffins both savory and sweet!  Fabulous!Entrees - Husband had the Shrimp and grits and I ordered Eggs Benedict.  While both were good, there were issues with each leading to the reason for a 4 rating and not 5.   Hubs enjoyed the taste and flavor of the shrimp and grits, but the grits were served watery almost like a watery soup. We are from the south - grits shouldn't be watery!  My eggs Benedict were really tasty!  I had never had veal bacon before and enjoyed it a lot. Unfortunately, one of my eggs was cooked to perfection and ran perfectly when it was cut, the second one had just crossed the line to overlooked and didn't.  :-(. Was a little disappointed.  However - didn't stop me from finishing my meal and it was still a great Eggs Benedict!I don't know that we really had any more room but I just had to try the beignets!  Certainly did not disappoint either.

4.0,6/22/2015,"Butter is wonderful simply said. We went one evening when we did an overnight after seeing Chicago. We had a late dinner, and the dim lighting provides a lovely ambiance for either a date night or casual dining with a few friends. The way the tables are sectioned off gives you a very private feel within your party, even though your table could be right next to another. We started with drinks of course - one at my table ordered a ghost margarita, someone ordered wine, and I ordered a bourbon-based drink - all very nice, balanced, not over-powering, but flavorful. We decided to just get one appetizer that way we could load up on sides to go with our entrees, and of course enjoy bread and butter as well. Our selection - ricotta crostini - the crostini itself was crisp and fresh, the ricotta very creamy with a bit of sweetness, and then it had a brussel sprout topped with Balsamic that added a lovely acidic note that just rounded it out perfectly. Now this comes our gripe with service - and really the only gripe we had with the server at all - one in our party is allergic to aged cheeses, fresh ricotta and fresh mozzarella are ok - so we just asked to ensure that there were no additional cheeses sprinkled on the dish as none were mentioned in the menu anyway. It did come out garnished with grated parmesean. When we asked the waitress, she stated but it is fresh parm. We are very aware that our party's cheese allergy is very confusing, however she did state that those were the only 2 cheeses she could have, and then the waitress did try to go back and forth with her on why the parm would be ok. In the end, the waitress brought her out her own helping of the appetizer and after that service was fantastic. The bread and butter was delightful - the bread on its own would be nothing special, but the butter is so light and fluffy, though it doesn't look that way. You get one regular butter, and the other is herbed. Both delicious - try them both.For dinner, we ordered the branzino, the pork-chop, and then to my delight they had a short rib ravioli special that night. And for sides we ordered sauteed escarole, gnocchi mac n' cheese, and a whipped potatoes.The pork chop - perfectly cooked, that night came with lovely wilted kale that was well flavored. The branzino practically melted in your mouth. The ravioli - the short ribs were melty perfection with so much flavor. The ravioli itself had a nice al dente texture. It had a delicious cream sauce packed with flavor. And topped off with a pickled radish that rounded it out. The escarole had hints of cayenne and lemon - which added so many different notes of flavor, and it was so perfectly wilted. The gnocchi mac - so decadent - it was so cheesy and rich, definitely could fill you up! And the potatoes - so light and fluffy, and simple in flavor, but delicious. It paired well with all the entrees.For dessert, we ordered a banana split, and the biegnets - I had been dying to try them! The banana split, was a gourmet banana split - topped with all the fixings, but just done better. The biegnets - I probably built them up a little too much in my head, they were not as wonderful as I hoped they'd be, but still delicious. The were fluffy, and oozing raspberry filling and the dipping sauce is to die for. All in all - butter is wonderful, and somewhere I would go back to in a second.",1,0,0,Jessica L.,"Troy, NY",132,247,67

5.0,6/13/2015,"Flew to DC/Virginia to visit friends and had them drive me to New York with one goal...Dining at Iron Chef Alexandra Guarnaschelli's restaurant. This marks the sixth restaurant from former and current Iron Chefs I've tried and the travel from California was worth it. I love this place and the food is amazing!!!To start off, the ambiance of the restaurant is chill with the tune of pop music playing. It starts with a flight of stairs from the door entrance that leads to a dimmed light waiting area, from here the bar and from here the dining area follows. You're greeted by the staff who are friendly and very welcoming. While our table was being prepped, me and friends grabbed drinks at the bar which we had carried over to our table when it was ready to go. It was time to make decisions for plates. Complimentary breads with two types of butter is provided while you wait. Though I wasn't sure what I was going to choose for a main course, one thing I was sure of was to order the veal bacon for an appetizer. I've read so much about this awesome dish and it didn't fail me. Tender and flavorful with a mustard wine sauce that you'd want to lick from the plate literally. Finally choices for main courses were made with the roasted chicken, double-cut pork chop and Mac n cheese. The plates arrived and it was chow time!The roasted chicken was perfect. Very flavorful, crispy skin and moist...not a single dry piece of meat. Next up was the delicious mac n cheese. The cheese was creamy with gnocchi that melts in your mouth. Last was the big winner of the night, the double-cut pork chop. This has to be the best pork chop I've ever had. The pork chop was prepared medium, incredibly tender, topped with apples, and had a sauce that would once again make you lick the plate. To add to this, the pork chop sat on a bed of collard greens that surpassed my grandmothers in flavor. She'd kill me if she'd heard me say that LOL. I couldn't leave without trying dessert so tried the cake of the day which was a peanut butter ice cream cake. This was shared amongst friends and was gone in minutes. I love everything about this restaurant from service, to ambiance, to the delicious food. I'd gladly travel back to New York for Butter Midtown. The only thing that could have made this even better would've been being able to meet Chef Guarnaschelli in person but I know she's a very busy woman and I'm sure I'm not the first fan to ever want that haha...high hopes for next time!Dinner 6/12/2015",2,0,0,Rayshawn W.,"Downey, CA",913,648,3455

The interior is beautiful and the service is fantastic but let's talk about what is truly important here...Appetizer: Ricotta and Brussel Sprout Crostini - Absolutely delicious. The textures of the different ingredients just clicked and the flavors were explosive. Balsamic, creamy ricotta and crispy sprout leaves topped with Parmesan. UGHHHHMain: The 28 day aged tomahawk steak for 2 - This falls under my famed list of ""best thing I ever ate."" I shit you not I have never had a better steak in my life. I've been to almost all of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants and some of Mario Batali + Joe Bastianich restaurants and none of their steaks have come close to this melt in your mouth, perfect piece of meat. I don't care if you're by yourself, just order it. No regrets. Also, you're a fool if you don't order it medium rare. You shouldn't call yourself a foodie if you order steak any other temperature. Sides: Gnocchi Mac and Cheese - Really good. Rich and creamy. Unfortunately, it was overshadowed by the incredible steak. I would also recommend pairing the steak with a different side as the two dishes are really rich. But as I mentioned before, no regrets. Other notes: walked in on a Monday night around 8:30 with no reservation and was seated right away. The worst part of this meal was the fact that I was too full to order dessert.

The wait staff hardly seems to want to be attentive to you if your not dropping the big bucks  however each time go I rack up a pretty high bill (let's just say I'm at least in the 300s each time I'm there) yet get snubbed with my service. Very discouraging but hey it's their tip right? Like I said before I go for the food and take guests here for the food not the service.

You continue to churn out sub-par food and service for a HUGE premium, giving tourists the idea that that is what NYC is all about...STOP IT! The only reason I EVER go to a restaurant in midtown is because I'm going to see a show and next time, I'll travel thank you very much. I made a 6:15 reservation for this past Saturday as we had tickets to Something Rotten, hysterical BTW. We walked in right on time and it was a bit off putting that there was a dad and his son sprawled on the couch playing cards like it was someones living room. We were shown to what is probably the worst table in the joint so I asked for a booth. We were THEN shown to the worst booth in the joint by the front door that feels like you're sitting in the service area. We waited for our server to address us, and waited, and waited until finally I walked up to the Hostess to see if we could possibly get another table for a VARIETY of reasons and her response was ""Do you have a reservation?"" Huh???? YOU JUST SAT US. We finally got a booth in the back and there was absolutely no redemption from here on out, not the drinks, the food or the service. We orderd 2 drinks to start, a watermelon thing and a bourbon thing and they were both tasteless and boring, at $17 a pop. The bread in business class on AA blows the bread away that we were then served. We decided to split a few thing, the bruschetta with brussels sprouts, snore, the pea and carrot ravioli which consists of about 1 ravioli cut into 4 slices, pretty bland for $20. We decided to split the branzino and it was a small filet with a too rich creamy sauce and a side of the mac and cheese gnocchi which was very reminiscent of the kraft variety.

2.0,5/14/2015,"This is the kind of place where, by the time you sign the voucher, you feel you've been had. The prices are high, so you expect fair value. Sadly, it doesn't happen. Too bad, because this place could be great.I work in midtown and have been to Butter for lunch and for drinks after work, always at the bar, which is beautiful. And the house drinks are excellent (though steep at $17). The small plates were outstanding on all occasions. Why not try dinner?So last night I did. Another midtown friend and I had a drink at the bar first. So far, so good. The male bartender is outstanding and carefully crafted our drinks. Unfortunately, his two female colleagues wear overly worried, dour expressions that you associate with stressed project managers. In other words, they are simply unpleasant--not the type whom you would expect in hospitality and NOT at this price point.On the other hand, the hostess staff is pleasant, competent, and hospitable. One of them took us to our table on the back wall. After settling in, I realize these tables are the most unattractive ones in the house. Sure, the booths are comfortable and generously sized. But the overhead pendants feature dim, exposed bulbs...the kind that wash your skin out and make everything look bland and gray, including the food. How can these tables be so badly lit when other parts of the room have such great lighting? The wood paneling on the wall is impressive, until you notice the exposed conduit boxes in the middle of each panel. Was art removed? Were there once sconces? Again, at this price, these details are inexcusable.Then there's our waiter...straight out of those greasy Italian restaurants we've been to. There's the aggressive pouring of the wine--oh look, it's empty! Another for dinner? NO. Then the upselling game. The menu includes branzino for $33, a fillet for $45 and lobster for $48. The waiter describes a couple specials in the ""I have for you tonight..."" style. Ugh. ""How much is the sea bass?"" I ask. $50. Are you serious? After he left, my friend joked: ""That's for the tourists."" Meaning some people may not want to appear in the ""if you have to ask..."" lot. This technique is an old one, but falling out of fashion with restaurants of this calibre.My friend's cauliflower entree was delicious. My branzino, just average--flavors were rather mushed together. The duck rilletttes were tepid, but tasty. Oddly, their size was too big for a single bite and fell apart when cut. Plating for both entrees and the app was below average.We waited over 30 minutes for the entrees. These things happen, as there were two private parties in the house that night. But the fact that our waiter ignored the situation was inexcusable. Even when he came by to refill our glasses, not one word.Interestingly, I found several explanations for the uneven experiences I've had there--right on their website. As of today, Thursday, the site still features a repeating, annoying pop-up for Mother's Day reservations. That should've come down last Sunday. Of the six events in the Upcoming events section, five have passed. I'm getting the feeling that detail is not a priority. Finally, the bios for the Butter Group partners are full of self-referential praise of the ""I'm simply incredible"" variety -- with no mention of commitment to the customer. In fact, in one of those super-hyped bios, a partner effusively describes himself as a ""savvy hustler."" Enough said.",1,1,1,George F.,"New York, NY",1,17,3

4.0,5/4/2015,"This was my second time at Butter Midtown. Some months ago we came for dinner. Last Friday we went for the $35.00 prix fixe lunch (3 courses).The food is sublime! Exceptional even!For the appy I had artichoke soup -- a light ""cream"" soup poured over roasted garlic. YUM! The entree was pasta primavera -- no explanation required. Dessert was a chocolate semifreddo -- a hard shell of chocolate over chocolate mousse and a ""crisp"" chocolate cake with cherries all around. Delicious and decadent.As I said before -- the food is sublime! Amazingly complex flavors presented really well.The actual service is good. I'd even venture a very good. What is not good, however, and what really detracts from the whole Butter experience, is the clearing of the plates. It borders on aggressive. It is annoying and I got really cranky when a clearer saw that my friend had finished her salad and asked if I was done with my soup. Errrrrrr no I'm not done and here is a clue - the spoon is clearly in my hand and I've got 1/2 of the soup to finish. Duh! Further they took my half eaten bread away when I wasn't paying attention. I wasn't done with it! (And frankly I would have used it to mop up my remaining primavera sauce -- hey -- no judgment  please -- I'm from Staten Island! We use bread to mop up any kind of sauce!) :-)When I say the table clearing is ""aggressive"" -- that is exactly what I mean. It's like they HAVE to do it NOW, and it's not done ""gently"" or ""nicely"" or inconspicuously.I get it -- this is your job. I get it -- you want a clean table. I get it -- you want to clear so you can serve another course.Absent the table clearers Butter Midtown would have gotten 5 stars from me because the food is that good.Will I go back -- absolutely. Will I be aggressive in holding on to my bread -- fer sure! Plus next time I will provide the table clearers feedback that they are too quick on the draw and are lessening my dining pleasure.",7,6,6,Kari A.,"New York, NY",0,26,6
4.0,5/3/2015,"Ahh!! My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary, and we had an awesome time!! Being a huge fan of Alex Guarnachelli, it has been on my ""NY bucket list"" to go to a Chopped judge's restaurant and it seemed like a good opportunity to do so. Plus, Alex is all about texture, so I was super excited (and it lived up to the hype!)First off, the space is beautiful. You enter into the restaurant going downstairs into a completely elegant wood-finished area (the walls, floors, booths). Then, as you approach the center of the restaurant and pass the bar, it opens up overhead with a large window and an image of trees - super relaxing and interesting.We had a ton to eat because we were eager to try everything!-Brussel sprout crostinis - AMAZING. The flavor on the brussel sprouts and the homemade ricotta was to die for. I could have just kept eating these for my entire meal-Yellow tomato pasta with lamb ragu - Very good, and interesting as I haven't really ever had yellow tomato as the star of a dish before. The lamb ragu was filled with lamb, so you didn't feel overkill from the pasta.-Roasted chicken entree - I loved this - the sunchokes were amazing to compliment the wonderful seasoning that the chicken had. Underneath the truffle sauce was great as well.-NY Steak - wonderfully seasoned and grilled perfectly-Side of rosemary potatoes - very good as well-Raspberry Beignets with Vanilla creme - After having seen so many pictures of these on Yelp, we had to try them! They were wonderfully soft and sugary, but not overly so. They definitely capped off the night perfectly!Had a wonderful time here - the bill was expensive, but what an awesome opportunity to eat here!",2,0,2,Azinda M.,"Chicago, IL",28,289,8
3.0,5/1/2015,"Have been here several times. Although the food remains great the service has greatly gone down. It has taken an 80 mins for appetizers, which was two salads, and entrees. My husband's steak came cold and I have to say the chicken was devine( which is why they get 3 stars).  We only see our waiter when we ask someone to get him. As I type this dessert came we asked for it to go.... but as dessert is sitting here in a bag ready to go we still have no check. The whole point is to go... which we can't do. Contemplating if he would even notice if we left. Doubtful yet we wait.... now 5 mins later check came. Paying and leaving. To return perhaps never, for a restaurant in Midtown that is half empty 2 hours and 10 mins is a long time for appetizers and entrees and a disappearing waiter. Kicker hostess was so engrossed in a private conversation didn't even bother to turn around.... so I guess we could have left with out paying and NO ONE would have noticed.",0,0,0,Brittany M.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",17,106,91

Lemon and pickle spicy goodness. Now about to enjoy dessert. But despite the lack of quality control on the bisque I am happy and will be back. Oh the pasta on Prix fixe lunch was a no go too.

2.0,4/24/2015,"Really disappointed in this place.  People with special diets should probably steer clear of this place. Normally, when we go to a restaurant of this caliber, the servers are very accommodating, but I am afraid this was not the case at Butter. The ironic thing is, my food is basically the simplest preparation ever--naked meat, no sides, no sauces, cooked in any oil.  I always explain that this is for MEDICAL reasons and that I really can't have these things. Most people get it and even ask questions to clarify. This did not happen at butter. They simply served me everything prepared as they do for everyone else, and I had to embarrass myself by requesting a stripped down replacement. They also don't seem to know the difference between Kalamata olives and Castelvetrano olives. Aside from that, The food quality was overall, very good. My husband ordered the Branzino for a main and the octopus for a starter. He really enjoyed both. No one stopped by during our visit to check and see if everything was okay.

3.0,4/8/2015,"I went during restaurant week, which might mean this review isn't very representative. But as they say..perhaps seeing someone at their worst is the best judge of character? It was obviously very busy. At first I thought the server was somewhat rude, but his easygoing indifference grew on me and became pretty entertaining. It took a long time for us to get bread, since they apparently ran out and had to bake more, but the deliciously warm and fluffy (and ridiculously buttery!) rolls were worth the wait. I had the fluke tartare, shortrib ravioli, and dark chocolate mocha peppercorn cake. Nothing was that great, to be honest. I wouldn't reorder any of them. The portions were definitely smaller for restaurant week. I probably wouldn't return, but I'm still pretty happy I went to Alex Guarnaschelli.

Every single thing we had was incredible...best meal ever! Our server was a delight and we kept teasing him about wanting to meet Chef Alex. My sister is a huge fan and was really hoping for a sighting. At the end of our meal, she came to our table to say hello! We could tell she had been really busy and stopped what she was doing and we were beyond excited and appreciative. We will absolutely be making Butter a birthday tradition going forward.

4.0,3/21/2015,"Chef Guarnaschelli certainly knows how to work in a variety of complex flavors into a dish, however the less is more mantra should be exercised more. The octopus starter was tender and had a nice char on it, however the variety of spice that was used and the heat was completely unnecessary for such a well cooked piece of octopus.The lamb special again, cooked perfectly. But again a spicy garlic rub took away from the delicious lamb flavor. I would have liked some rosemary and salt or simply a light garlic rub and the mint relish. The simplicity of well cooked high quality ingredients for me is preferred to a large diverse mix of spice on the pallet. Good restaurant.  But could be really great by keeping to less is more.",1,0,0,Steven H.,"Morristown, NJ",12,10,3
1.0,3/19/2015,"Wanted to go to Butter for so long because I love Alex G. Not worth the wait to go or the price. Food was sub par. not what I was expecting at all. Service was even worse. Waiter seemed ticked we weren't ordering alcohol and I saw him drinking on the side. Guess he was drinking what we didn't order. Restaurant week menu was reasonable enough but food was so poor - either bland or overpowered by one item (i.e pink peppercorns on chocolate torte, all you taste was peppercorn. candied orange peel in whipped cream on banana split, all you taste is orange peel. short rib ravioli was like unflavored gum, lentil soup was more of a curry mushroom soup.)So disappointing on so many levels.

4.0,3/15/2015,"The New York City Restaurant Week dinner menu at Butter Midtown displayed a treasure trove of textures, creating a journey of aesthetics and consistencies battling it out. Dinner started with fluffy golden parker house rolls flaked sea salt, crunchy bread, and  smooth rounds of sweet and herbed butter.The fluke tartare, encircled by negative space and an emerald line, only awakened with rich magenta blood orange pieces and thin slices of prickly green English cucumbers. The  fish and orange were cut to the same size, mimicking texture, while the cucumber added an almost imperceptible crunch.A tangle of toppings disguised the short rib ravioli. The freshness of the candy striped beet was crisp , but the buttered breadcrumbs added crunch. Bright green chile pesto added heat contradicting the garlicky sauce at the bottom of the bowl. The springy slick custard of the crème caramel, the ruby red pomegranate seeds and crunchy almond brittle came together under the syrupy sweet kumquat preserves. The experience was about texture-- the way each element played with its compatriots and each layer added to the textual architecture of the dish.",5,0,3,Randi E.,"Hoboken, NJ",388,155,456
3.0,3/15/2015,"Butter is a great space beneath the Cassa Hotel in midtown.  On a related side note, one would expect restaurants that move to end up in a better space, both in size and location.  Which makes me wonder why Butter moved from Lafayette to 45th Street unless it was targeting a different crowd.  The new Butter is large, and can probably accommodate 100-200 people.  The entrance on 45th leads to a flight of stairs (elevators if you prefer) that you walk down to access the space.  The dinner menu is compact while packing a fair amount of diversity.  The grilled artichoke and the burrata salad are a good starting place for your meal, although the crostini and the peas and carrots ravioli are better options for the winter.  I found the charred white cloud cauliflower to be ... charred!  It is however a unique variant that is worth trying.  I would also recommend the small side of gnocchi mac & cheese.  Butter is a great option for post-work drinks and dinner.  I would not recommend it for a quiet evening of reflection, but the convenience (not the distinctiveness) of the location--equidistant from Grand Central and Times Square--make it a worthy choice for a midtown evening.  But only if you work or care to spend time in the midtown jungle.",14,8,10,Srini V.,"Manhattan, NY",467,463,97
1.0,3/14/2015,"Went for restaurant week and the hosted spoiled the entire experience. I had friends in town and I heard so much about this spot, that I invited them to meet me here. As soon as I arrived, the hostess coldly informed me that the kitchen would close for lunch in 15 min. Note: I was early for a 2:30pm reservation. Why even accept lunch reservations at 2:30pm, if the kitchen closes at 2:45pm? When my guests arrived, she was chatting with someone and I mentioned to my guests that we had to hurry to be seated in order to eat. She looked at me and with disgust said, ""I see you ok, I'll get to you when I'm done"". Then without a word she walked us back to our table and whispered something to the waiter. She was about to walk off, when my guest asked if she could check our winter coats. Begrudgingly, she did, only to return to slam down our coat check numbers without a word.  A manager came over later in the meal and was half-heartedly apologetic. They sent an order of doughnuts for our troubles, when what I would have really appreciated was an apology from the hostess. This type of service is not acceptable at in-and-out, let alone a restaurant that charges $18 for a margarita. Will never be back.",2,1,0,Moe T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0
3.0,3/13/2015,"Our res was for 530PM on a Friday night. My husband arrived first and checked us it but when I arrived I wasn't greeted. We were just silently shown to our table - in the very back of the restaurant. For some reason the heat was on high, so high that even I who is usually cold felt like I was melting. Before we even got started I asked the waitress if we could turn then heat down and she quickly had the manager adjust. The bus boys walked by our table a few times in silence before our waitress came by.  She first asked what kind of water we wanted, left, water came, and then took our drink orders. I had the calamansi virgin, the frozen watermelon cubes are def a nice touch and once melted the drink turns from lightly citrus/sour to sweet, yummy!We already knew what we wanted to order, myself bc I has studied the menu prior to, but it was difficult to cue the waitress that we were ready to order.  We kinda had to formally say we were ready to order. Complimentary bread was delicious esp the rolls, comes with butter and scallion butter. My husband enjoyed his half dozen oysters while I munched on the endive salad.  The leaves are well dressed but we had a total of 3 small slices of pear that added up to prob 1/4 of the whole pear?The foie gras torchon although tasty had 3 miniature pieces, dissapointing. The veal bacon was good but was mostly chewy and some points drier meat and not as much marbling as I would have liked. The cavatappi was delicious and I know it's listed as a hot appetizer but I also wish the serving size could be bigger or an entree option?  The duck was perfectly cooked but again just 2 slices. For dessert the creme caramel was average and the beignets were good. Not quite as hot as I thought they'd be but the vanilla dipping sauce was amazing!I am never one to complain about portion size and I didn't leave hungry but with each dish I would have enjoyed just a few more bites to savor.The service was 3/5 depending on who came by. Our waitress was always courteous, quick, and answered any questions. Only one of the servers explained the food, and the bus boy refilling water was always reaching right in front of my husband. Overall, I has a great experience at the old location and finally got the chance to try the Midtown location but I wasn't impressed.

It took forever for us to even get our regular soft drinks and for our appetizers to come out. The apps were pretty good... we got most of them, the mussels were great and so were the mini meatballs. I wasn't a big fan of the salads, I got the Burger with Jalapeno Coleslaw and fondue cheese... great burger and I loved the cheese but 20 dollars was a bit much for this. The waitress messed up our order and someone in my party got the wrong food. She offered to take it back but at that point my friend said whatever and just ate what she brought out.

1.0,3/8/2015,"I've been to Butter twice before, both times for Restaurant Week. I had a good time there - the food was really delicious and the service up to par. And so when my friend asked me to choose a place for RW dinner this week I had no doubt Butter would be a good choice. I couldn't be more wrong ! My friend ordered a drink that he said he could barely taste any alcohol in. We didn't complain, just ordered a different one. That one was even worse - plain juice. We called the bartender and her response was: we actually poured 2oz instead of 1.5oz so that's how it should taste. Hmm. Ok. Still, she brought us a shot of ""vodka"". Guess what. It still didn't change the flavor of the drink ! Watering down your alcohol, Butter ?We got moved to the table, we ordered our food .. The appetizers were whatever, nothing to complain about but neither anything to brag about. Now when it comes to the entrees .. The ravioli were fine but let's focus on the mahi mahi. As soon as the plate landed in front of me, I smelled fish. In a bad way. I took a little bite and it definitely tasted wrong. My friend, an avid fisherman, also gave it a try. He spit it out. We called our server who apologized and offered to replace my dish with a different one - and I appreciate that. However: to be served fish that's NOT FRESH ??? A person named Nick came to our table (I assume he was the manager?) saying he was sorry I didn't like my dish. Dude, that fish STANK !!! Anyway, we paid, we tipped our waitress more than 25% as we knew it wasn't her fault the kitchen served us crap .. Still, I felt like someone higher up should be notified about our experience. So I reached out to Butter on twitter. I asked them to give me a follow as I didn't want to complain for everyone to see. They did and .. As soon as I sent them my first message, they unfollowed me. So there goes Customer Service. And so - forgive me, Butter - but here I am with my 1 star review. I understand that some restaurants couldn't care less about Yelp.

I ordered the roasted cauliflower salad, fish of the day, and the chocolate mocha cake. My dinner mate ordered the tartare, short rib ravioli and the Creme caramel. The most exciting item from my meal was the an interestingly flavored cauliflower salad although there was too much oil used and an excellently cooked Mahi mahi. However, everything else was awful. The braised cabbage that came with the Mahi Mahi was flavorless and and chocolate mocha cake was dry and the bits of peppercorn in it were overwhelming. My dinner mate fared much worse, as his tartare was completely flavorless, his short rib ravioli was lukewarm and flavorless, and his Creme caramel was tasteless and the texture was completely off.  To top it all off, the ""butter"" that came with the pre-service bread was whipped and tasteless.

5.0,3/2/2015,"My mother and I were very excited about trying Alex Guarnaschelli's food, and Butter did not disappoint (for the most part). After salivating over the fresh Parker house rolls with herbed butter, we started with the endive salad, which was delicious. The combination of the roasted shallot vinaigrette and the crunchy hazelnuts was great. Only thing that would have made it perfect was the pear that was promised on the menu, but did not make it to the plate. We then moved on to the cavatappi pasta, which was arguably my favorite item. Pasta was perfectly cooked and coated in this delicious yellow tomato sauce. The chunks of lamb sausage were the perfect compliment. Our server recommended this pasta, and she was spot on! Next to the pork chop. Wonderful rub/flavor. On its own, it was great. In combination with the mustard drizzle and the dressed mustard greens, it was killer. The only thing that made it better were the fabulous pillows of Mac-and-cheese gnocchi we ordered to go along with it. Gnocchi was done just right - not gummy or doughy - and was sitting in one of the best cheese sauces I've had in some time. Only course to disappoint was dessert. Now, we are quite the dessert lovers, but I could not get into either of the ones we ordered. The creme caramel was mediocre, at best, and did not work with the kumquat. The chocolate torte had a nice, rich, fudge-y layer, but the cake was otherwise pretty bland. Finally, the service was impeccable. Our server was great - really knew the menu and the wine list. Our pork chop actually came out very undercooked, and it was whisked away immediately. The floor manager had complimentary glasses of sparkling wine over to us before we knew it and also gave us a side of mashed potatoes, just so we could try them.

My girlfriend and I are both New Yorkers and enjoy eating out a little too much. She planned a few dates during restaurant week to try some places we have yet to go. Places to try out that maybe we'd come back to - Butter was one of those places, and we will never return. Not only did we wait to be seated for 30 minutes after our scheduled reservation, the food and service was amateur. Try having clam chowder soup and raviolis served cold. In addition, our waiter treated us like some bimbos off the street with no money to spend. Why? Because we were eating at a discounted price for restaurant week? You mean an event that thousands of New Yorkers partake in as a fun 2-3 weeks? Right.Were we seriously not worthy of the same service that we saw him giving the surrounding tables, who just so happened to not be partaking in restaurant week?Not ONCE did he even ask how our food was. No conversation at all regardless of the attempts we made..not only was this extremely awkward but down right rude. There are so many other nice restaurants in this city I rather spend my money at.

I really wanted to come here for a very long time because I love Alex Guarnaschelli and my expectations were high. I'm a Food Network freak and she is one of my favorites chefs. Well... After almost a year of wanting to go my husband surprised me with reservations for restaurant week. What a huge disappointment! Restaurant week is all about getting a sneak peek of what the restaurant is all about and Butter failed this task completely. The portions were adequate but the flavors were not there. I was expecting an ""Oh my god"" in every spoonful... that did not happened. The appetizers were ok. I ordered as a main entree the fish of the day which was a Mahi Mahi, it was perfectly cooked and tasty. That was the only highlight of the evening. My husband ordered the short ribs raviolis which tasted like precooked Costco raviolis tossed with butter and herbs. The desserts were extremely ordinary: a chocolate cake and creme caramel. I'm puertorrican.. so truth to be told any puertorrican can do a better creme caramel (flan) than that. Overall...Huge disappointment and it's very unlikely that we will be coming back. I love Alex and I'm pretty sure the restaurant week menu doesn't really portraits what her restaurant is all about, at least I hope so.",5,1,1,Yarelis V.,"Downtown Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",124,19,2

2.0,2/17/2015,"My sister and I go to NYC every year for the annual toy show and we pick a celebrity chef restaurant to have one amazing dinner.  This year, we picked Butter since we love Alex so much!  The only reason I gave the experience a 2 star instead of a 1 star is because the food was delicious.  The service was worse than I you would have at your local diner.  We were seated right away and then waited and waited for the server to come over.  Once he did, we immediately ordered a bottle of wine.  We waited and waited but the wine finally came and he poured our wine...but never did again -- we poured our own.  So, you get the idea, but here is a laundry list of the other service issues:Cleared our appetizer dishes by creating a Jenga of dirty dishes stacked on his arm.Brought our entrees but we didn't have any silverware, had to wait while our food got cold.Didn't bring steak knives for the steak and the pork chop.  When I asked for a steak knife, the waiter said they were being polished so I would have to wait.  When he finally brought them, they were wooden -- pretty sure don't need polishing. We ordered dessert and the waiter didn't ask if we wanted coffee.Waited even longer for the dessert to come out.Last but not least, when we finally asked another server walking by, for our check, she brought it and our waiter never came back to the table.  Never saw him again.I don't mind spending money for an exceptional meal but this was not worth the high prices.  I expect to feel taken care of for these prices.  I left angry which is not how I want to feel after spending over $300 for a meal!",3,1,1,Lisa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,7,0

We've never been to Alex Guarnaschelli's place downtown and decided to pop in.  We loved it!!!  They welcomed us with open arms and didn't blanche about not having a reservation.  The atmosphere is beautiful, warm and inviting on a cold winter's night.  We had 'clams rockefeller' - our name for it and it was amazing. I had the tuna tartare and cucumber with ginger, radish and lime oil.  The flavors were amazing. They made little 'cucumber balls' - think melon balls but pea sized' and layered them below the tartare which was cool, fresh and amazing.  Hubby had the cavatelli with spiced lamb sausage and yellow tomato sauce. Texture was delicious - beautiful olive oil coating red pepper flakes, tinge of tomato and the spice of the lamb. the pasta was cooked to perfection.  I was craving brussel sprouts and the special with ricotta featured the cheese more than the sprouts. I asked if they could to them only and the waitress said they used to have a fabulous brussels side and she'd see if they'd make it. Voila. It was amazing. Delicious flavors with olive oil, charred sprouts, but not burned, perfect texture and cooked to perfection. The right amount of al dente with oil and crunch.   Two glasses of pinot, an amazing house baked bread. Wonderful hospitality.  The service was amazing. I will definitely come back. We were gnoshing given our jet lagged state but we watched main courses go by that looked to die for. One filet, chicken breast, the steak for two.  Ample, portions, with everyone around having fun and happy.

5.0,1/24/2015,"I'm a fan of Alex Guarnaschelli so I was excited to try Butter; I dined here with my family for my birthday dinner. The restaurant is located in midtown close to the theater district, so as such you're bound to see a lot of people before and after shows. Tonight however the restaurant was relatively quiet, which paired very nicely with the overall atmosphere and feel of the restaurant. The decor is woodsy but not too rustic; the dining room has tones of browns which exposed wood tables and floors. The ceiling is high with a huge mural of a wooded forest, very lovely overall. I started with an endive salad with hazelnuts and a shallot vinaigrette; it was very tasty and fresh. For my main meal I had the pork chop with sliced apples and whole grain mustard. We ordered a few sides for the table and I sampled the escarole and gnocchi mac and cheese. For dessert I had the raspberry beignets which came with a vanilla dipping sauce. The food was outstanding - everything tasted fresh and delicious. Nothing was too heavy either so I wasn't plodding out of the restaurant. Overall, Butter definitely exceeded my expectations.

5.0,1/24/2015,"We celebrated our wedding/elopement last night with an unplanned stop at Butter. We arrived early (around 5:00 p.m.) on a Friday evening without a reservation and they were able to accommodate us as a walk in although I suspect if we had come much later we would have had a wait since the restaurant started to fill up shortly after we arrived and was almost at capacity when we left.Very extensive (and expensive) drink menu but we kept it simple with a glass of Prosecco and a martini to enjoy while we waited for our food. The menu is not overwhelming (a good thing) and is innovative. They had a few off menu specials (one of which we ordered).  For an appetizer we shared the homemade ricotta & crispy Brussels sprouts with aged balsamic and sourdough toast. It was a surprising explosion of textures and flavors.  The pan-seared Branzino with charred romanesco and caper berries was cooked perfectly. Every forkful was balanced and full of taste. The sautéed escarole, lemon and cayenne was tasty and the right complement to the Branzino. The off menu special of Striped Bass with P.E.I. mussels with a light wine sauce was expertly prepared and delicious. The fish and mussels were fresh and allowed to shine based on the skillful preparation, seasoning and cooking. ""Geechie Boy"" South Carolina grits = yummy. I could have had another cup! Seriously. I have never had a beignet before but since the chef is known for hers we tried the raspberry beignets with vanilla dipping sauce. It is a good thing I never had these before or I would be in trouble. I was sort of expecting a donut but these were fresh, hot and really good.The honey lavender ice cream was smooth, subtle and tasty. Both deserts a perfect ending to a great meal with a good cup of French pressed coffee.The service was friendly, professional and attentive.Cool atmosphere and vibe in the restaurant.Butter is in midtown Manhattan so be prepared to pay, especially if you want to share a bottle of wine or have a few cocktails but, based on our experience and taking everything into consideration, definitely worth the money.We were fans of Chef Alex Guarnaschell from the Food Network before last night and we are now fans of Butter.We look forward to returning sooner rather than later!#Butter #guarnaschelli #awesome!",1,0,0,Jim M.,"Bridgeport, CT",106,21,5

The best part of the meal may have been the bread.  The appetizers we had were oysters, brussel sprouts crostini and the veal bacon.  Oysters were fresh, but the others were just average.  I got a special fish entrée that came out cold, and the fish itself was a little tough for my liking.  I didn't eat much of it.  Midtown is a tough place to find decent restaurants, and especially ones that are not tourist ridden.  This used to be it, but next time I may have to do some further research to find better options, because for the prices it was just not worth it.",2,1,1,Sarah L.,"Manhattan, NY",7,49,0

Brought a warm bottle of wine to the table then put it in a table-side bucket of ice for 15 min.  Once the food was delivered he never checked back.  Good thing the food was excellent.That said he missed out on another bottle wine buy not checking back.  Maybe he was having a bad night, but for $350.00 I expect a lot more in the way of service.  The bar area had a good vibe.  I'd go back for the bar scene.",1,0,0,Will E.,"Roseville, CA",0,15,9

We found this very cheap and off-putting.)Our waiter was very friendly, prompt and helpful with the menu. He made some excellent recommendations which proved very accurate.  We started with the endive salad and the ricotta and Brussels sprout appetizer, which was incredible. My wife had their signature cavatappi pasta as her entry and I had the pan-seared Branzino.  When the waiter brought out my fish he realized that the kitchen staff had left off the sauce that is supposed to be under the fish and had to take it back to have the plate finished.

It's truly a beautiful space near the theater district - - perfect for a pre/post theater evening. We had such a great experience on that first occasion that we decided to come here on this trip for our pre-theater drinks and apps. There was almost noone at the bar when we arrived as they had just opened, yet our bartendress was dismissive and borderline rude. She had this poutty look on her face the entire time she served us. We ordered drinks and a few apps, which were fantastic (shrimp and hamachi). When we finished our drinks we wanted to order another round, as well as a dinner for our daughter who came to meet us for a quick bite after work, yet despite our empty glasses and plates, we sat there for 10-15 minutes without any acknowledgement of our presence. Everyone around us got service. Even the couple who stood behind us at the bar were greeted with a friendly hello and request for their order. We, on the other hand, sat there waiting for an acknowledgement, but were ignored. When we requested we wanted to order more, she ignored us. We asked another time and she bit at us saying that she heard us and would help us in a minute. We truly felt like she simply didn't like us nor want to help us. Finally, we asked to speak with the manager and shared with him our complaints. He apologized, said he'd speak with her and then provided a new bartender to serve us. I must say, that manager completely turned the experience around to a 5. My daughter's pasta with sausage and yellow tomato sauce was outstanding and we had another nice round of drinks. To help remedy the situation, the manager brought us an order of jelly filled donuts with custard. OMG...they are heavenly.

The bleu cheese stuffed olives put the martini over the top. And although as more guests arrived, the bartenders kept up with the many orders. Since one of our guests was running late, I let the hostess know we would get started without them. They had our table ready and that's when the really awesome service kicked in.

Also the pumpkin ravioli and chicken liver mousse were great. My favorite was the thick cut veal bacon.Just when we were getting our bellies happy, our host ordered what seemed to be a whole cow and a pig.

The server was friendly and attentive and the decor was nice but I don't go to restaurants for the walls and the people I go for the food. The food was a little pricy but worth it. I got the roasted chicken breast and gnocchi Mac and cheese. The chicken had a delicious crust and the sauce was delicious, savory and sweet. It came with greens and a sweet potato which were cooked perfectly and seasoned nicely. The gnocchi surprised me it was tender and the cheese was a great compliment. So delicious. My partner had the beef filet which was tender and juicy almost like a pot roast but not as fall apart tender. The sauce was delicious with it and the mushrooms and onions were a nice compliment with the sauce which was almost teriyaki flavored. I would definitely come back here and order the same thing and bring people with me. The portions were perfect as well I'm a big eater but it was enough that I was satisfied.

5.0,12/4/2014,After my business lunch here today I will heartily recommend Butter. The waiter was attentive but not in the way or interrupting. We were in a hurry (like a ridiculous time frame for a sit-down place which we didn't learn from guests until we arrived) and they were really considerate of this fact. The plates were all set down at once like we were somehow in a five star with our own waiter. Everyone enjoyed their food and we even had time for coffee/espresso which was served with attention to detail. After the lunch guests left I conducted another meeting at the same table which the waiter said was A-OK. The place even had free wi-fi so we could look over some documents as a group. This place really wins my respect for top flight service. If I had one tiny complaint it would be that it can get a little loud in the dining area near the bar.,0,0,0,Mindy M.,"New York, NY",36,212,34

For appetizers I had the Florida shrimp which were delightful the toasted coriander gave them a nice crunch.  The chef also rushed it up to her from the kitchen which was also very nice. For the entrees I had the Pan-Seared Branzino with Charred Romanesco and Caper Berries. It was DELISH and cooked to perfection.  I tasted them and they seemed to be missing something.

2.0,11/29/2014,Made reservations at Butter for thanksgiving dinner. I have to say that I was not as impressed as I thought I would be. The food was good but had far too much salt. But the worst part was the waitstaff. It seemed as if it was everyone's first night at work. We had to ask for more bread three times before someone finally came by and threw some on the table. No one would make direct eye contact and kind of just shuffled about. At one point I saw a server wipe his nose on his sleeve as he walked by a table near ours. It was all a bit odd.

I'm genuinely happy for people that leave Butter feeling like they just ate the best meal of their lives, but the dishes I had were disappointing, if not inedible. One bite of the lamb sausage (in cavatappi) made both me and my counterpart nauseous. I also picked at some unmemorable application of pork. I don't eat meat anymore. Not solely from this experience, but this meal certainly didn't give me any reason to break veg. If it's the name ""Butter"" that draws you in more than the name ""Guarnaschelli"", you'd probably be really excited about the house-made herb butter that comes with the bread.

I usually do not write reviews but it was so bad that you need to know.Firstly lets talk about the good points;The food is excellent, well prepared, balanced and superbly presented so for the culinary effort on food A+ Now lets talk about the reasons why this is not good enough;SERVICE: what happened to hiring people who like food to actually serve it.....                  what happened to hire people who can speak freely about the product and                 endorse what they are selling. AMBIENCE: Loud, cold freezing and blowing full steam, lighting not very good, music level far to hight for a half empty place.It was also meant to be a special occasion, something I advised the maitre'd upon booking and reconfirmed on arrival. Sadly no effort was made to acknowledge what was supposed a unforgettable night.OVERALL: although food would be worth a return the complete ABSENCE of any kind of service experience puts it in the category of what I call been there TWICE; 1st and last time.Sorry that Alex has gotten so complacent on the running of the restaurant that the food wont save this place.",1,0,1,K H.,"Carefree, AZ",0,2,0

2.0,10/11/2014,"We were so looking forward to eating here as we admire Chef Alex but we were disappointed (sadly). I ordered the veal bacon and it was smothered in mustard--as much as I like mustard, it overwhelmed the flavor of the bacon.  However, the rest of the meal was delicious. I had the Berkshire pork and the two others in my party had duck breast and NY strip (which was a special). They were excellent--so why only two stars? SERVICE!!!It was a Friday night, but not overwhelmingly crowded.  We had to ask for bread after being seated for about 5-10 minutes. People who came after us got their bread basket right away. My son ordered the NY strip and, after about 5 minutes later, we realized that he never asked what temperature.  When we finally flagged him down, he said that my son ordered it medium rare which wasn't true--we told him he never asked and he stuck to the medium rare story--my son likes his steaks black and blue.  The order was changed and the steak was delivered black and blue--but this shouldn't have been an issue.  I also ordered a 2nd glass of wine which never came--once again, we had to flag down someone to get our waiter.  The bottom line is this--you should have high expectations for both food and service when you go to a restaurant of this caliber.  You are paying a premium price.  Quite frankly, we got better service at a local pub nearby and we certainly paid significantly less.  We left that pub feeling satisfied while we left Butter feeling a bit taken.",3,0,0,Nancy K.,"Long Island, NY",0,24,0

My initial reaction was confusion, but as the Veal Bacon made its pleasantries and got to know my taste-buds, I knew what she had meant. I knew it immediately.It's ironic that a great meal can ruin food for you. Regular bacon, turkey bacon, other bacons are just inferior choices now. The tender, juicy, flavor-filled-up-to-the-brim-that-sometimes-you-just-can't-EVEN Veal Bacon that entered my world on a casual Wednesday night forever changed my perception of bacon.Butter made me a bacon snob.I never asked for this. I never volunteered. For a few minutes I was angry. How could I get store bought bacon now. Why would you do this to someone, you monster. I looked around me, terrified that no one else was understanding my situation (they weren't). I had to make a scene- I had to do something. WAKE UP. It was panic!

5.0,9/29/2014,"Sadly this review is a bit overdue.......My friend and I had an early dinner at Butter Midtown before attending at concert at nearby Madison Square Garden.  I am familiar with Alex Guarnaschelli from her numerous appearances on the Food Network, but was not aware she had opened her own restaurant in NYC.  As we stepped out from the car, I hungrily waited in anticipation of our forthcoming dinner.SETTING/AMBIANCE:  Stepping into Butter, we descended a staircase and were politely greeted by two smiling hostesses.  The ambiance of the restaurant is simple yet elegant.  Wood floors and panels adorn the dining areas, while a larger-than-life picture of a forest area complements the decor well.  Seating is generous at the ""L"" shaped bar and during the course of dinner, the seats filled up by those seeking a drink after a (no doubt) long Monday.FOOD:My friend and I shared the Hudson Valley Duck Rillettes and Homemade Ricotta & Fennel for our appetizers.  Both selections were delicious, but my favorite was the duck rillettes.  They were just amazingly good.Our dinner entrees included the grilled pork chop and the salmon.  The pork chop was incredible and undeniably one of the best dishes I've ever had.  It was a generous portion that was prepared well; very tender and moist.  My friend enjoyed his salmon as well, and both of us would have most likely finished our entrees were it not wanting to save room for dessert.For dessert, I chose the strawberry tart, while my friend ordered the raspberry beignets.  Personally, I like strawberries and finished my dessert entirely.  However, the beignets were the perfect end to the delightful meal.   I'll have to order the beignets on a future visit (if any).SERVICE:Very good.  Our server was very polite and attentive.  He answered all our questions about the menu, was patient, and checked on us consistently throughout the meal.BOTTOM LINE:  A very memorable dinner in NYC!",15,9,11,Michael C.,"Honolulu, HI",414,788,5011
1.0,9/28/2014,"I was so angry after eating at Butter last night.  Here is what happened: My group of 6 arrived at 6:30 for dinner having an 8 pm show.  It took 20 minutes, and us asking repeatedly, for our waiter, for him to finally arrive. He seemed stoned out of his mind and could barely focus on our order.  We told him we were in a rush, now that we'd been sitting so long. He took our full order, as we were so short on time, and didn't even bother to tell us the specials until I asked him what they were.  He wrote nothing down (which makes me crazy because then they always get it wrong) and then my friends and I set our watches and placed bets on how long our drinks would take and if they'd be correct.  Drinks arrived 17 minutes later and only four of the six came at all.  So two of us sat there another 5 minutes waiting for our drinks. So we've now been there 45 minutes and have just gotten drinks.  This was the first time we asked to speak to the manager.  No one came by. Appetizers arrived awhile later and then our entrees after we asked repeatedly to get our food as we were trying to make an 8 pm curtain. As far as the food, my salad was just greens DRENCHED in dressing, not a vegetable in sight.   I ordered the $33 Branzino which, I kid you not, was about 2 ounces of fish. Nothing else on the plate but four desiccated tiny lemon slices and two pieces of cauliflower the size of a postage stamp.  My husband got the ""filet"" of beer which had huge chunks fat and gristle in it.  Probably making up 25% of his piece of meat. His cost  $45. As soon as we got our entrees we asked for the check, as we were racing to finish, and when it arrived and we put our credit cards in, no staff member returned to pick it up. I had to grab it and wander around the restaurant looking for someone to hand it to. Once again we asked to speak to the manager.

To start off we ordered the oysters and tuna tartare. Omg delishhh!!!! Then each of us ordered an entree and shared. We had the duck, the beef filet, squash ravioli, and the branzino. Everything was delicious!! For dessert we had the roasted peaches and the rasberry beignets - can't get any better than this!

3.0,9/25/2014,"Everything here is good, but I watch a LOT of Chopped so I expected one of the best meals in my life. I was at no point blown away. My main criticism would be that my fried pork loin ""Milanese"" was soggy on the underside and the batter fell off when you cut into it -- a mistake Alex would hold a Chopped contestant in contempt for serving her. ""For shame! Was I wrong to expect the best ?"" I thought. This to me is a sign that the restaurant is too large for its own good and the quality control on the food suffers as a result. Don't get me wrong, the food is delicious, but for the price ? You could have an outstanding meal somewhere smaller where they pay closer attention to details.

Unfortunately, our server turned cold as soon as we turned down the sparkling water for plain tap water. They actually didn't give us Restaurant Week menus until we asked for them, which seemed to further irritate our server. The bread basket was very delicious, although the food was meh/okay. The dish I enjoyed most was the roasted fish over buttered beans, which was perfectly seared and balanced nicely by the buttered beans.

3.0,8/28/2014,"5 stars for food, 1 star for service, so I am giving 3 stars...We arrived 20 minutes early for our reservation and the hostess told us that our table wasn't ready, and we were encouraged to go to the bar to order drinks. We were assured that we would be ""found"". While standing at the bar, I looked around and saw at least 4 free tables available for parties of 2. Very strange!We proceeded to order a round of drinks, and figured that once we returned to the hostess area with our drinks that we would be seated.We walked back to the couches near the hostess stand to wait to be seated. While we were waiting, we kept seeing groups being seated before us, we checked our watches and saw its was 10 minutes past our reservation time. My boyfriend went up to the hostess stand to check in on the status of our table and she claimed she called us and couldn't find us and that our table had been ready for some time! We were sitting right in front of her the whole time! We were the only ones sitting there. The hostesses kept looking over at us, but clearly did not remember us from just a few minutes earlier as promised. Finally, the hostess sat us and plopped a set of menus on the table. She did not include any restaurant week menus, wine list, or drink menus. We sat at the table waiting for a server to come over with the menus we needed, and another 10 minutes went by before anyone came over to us. Finally, the waiter came over, and we asked for the restaurant week menu and drink menu. We proceeded to watch him walk around the dining room helping other tables for another 10 minutes before coming over, but he didn't remember to bring us the menus! He laughed and said ""oh, I forgot to get you your menus.."". After about 20 minutes of waiting, we finally received the menus we wanted all along. One would think that by the lack in service, this place was packed, but it wasn't! The soup of the day was a chilled cucumber soup with melon and black pepper. It was very light, refreshing and flavorful. I almost felt like I was at the spa while eating this soup because of the amazing cucumber flavor. This is a soup I definitely would want to have again in this lifetime.For the other starter, we ordered the house made veal bacon, which was cut very thick like a filet, versus a slab of bacon. We were both hoping for a crispy piece of bacon and were disappointed.  The whole grain mustard that was spread all over the bacon was a little overwhelming for this dish, and my boyfriend and we did not think it was a great accompaniment for the bacon. We were hoping for a more savory pairing instead of the spicy tart flavor of the mustard. This dish was our least favorite of the night, which is surprising since we both love bacon!We ordered the fish of the day, which was the grilled hake. I have had hake once before and loved it, so I was very happy to see this on the menu since it is not very common. It was accompanied by white beans in a lemony creamy sauce and topped with fresh scallions. The hake was cooked perfectly with a slightly crispy layer with the fish being tender and full of flavor. The lemony cream sauce that the beans were in was so delicious and made dipping the fish into it very enjoyable. The scallions were a nice touch to each bite because of their crispy texture and bitter flavor. For our other main course we ordered the braised short ribs that were served over quinoa . The texture of the short rib was amazing! It broke apart so easily with just a fork and melted in your mouth. The hot peppers that were on top of it gave it a nice spicy taste that off set the sweet and savory sauce that it was covered in. What a lovely combo! This was our favorite dish!We ordered a side, but the wrong side came to the table. We ordered the grits, and we received kale. Oops! Luckily, the waiter said we could keep the kale, and that they brought us the grits in a few minutes. The kale was the freshest kale either of us had ever tasted. It was extremely earthy and every bite was breathtaking. There were pieces of toasted garlic in it, and it was covered in olive oil. This is one mistake I am very happy they made.The grits were equally as phenomenal as the kale, as they were like eating dessert. The grits tasted as if corn bread had been broken into crumbs and soaked with milk, just like a liquid corn bread of some sorts.They were so creamy, and cheesy. I'd skip dessert any day for some more of these grits. After we were done eating our meals, we waited an exceptionally long time for dessert, at least a half hour. While waiting we witnessed the hostesses packing up for the night and going home. We didn't feel right about this, and almost wanted to leave the restaurant as well since we didn't feel welcome anymore.We enjoyed this meal a lot, but only because of the amazing food!

The bisque had a great lobster flavor but also had chunks of lobster at the bottom. The corn added a nice southern touch. The Veal bacon was fatty and delicious. What more could you ask for. For the entree, I ordered the fish and my friend got the short ribs. The short ribs shouldn't have been plural. It was definitely just 1 cube of fatty delicious piece of short rib. It was tender and puled apart to the touch. The fish was flavorful and had a good crispy skin. The beans at the bottom were soft and definitely fatty. Finally dessert, we ordered the chocolate cake and the plum tart. The chocolate cake was very very dense. The plum tart was light and spongy.

The only thing that I was really sad/confused about was the portion.  I totally understand that a restaurant of its kind and especially an Alex Guarnashelli restaurant, the portions were similar or less than 'Per Se'.  The soup portion was fine, but the fact that the raviolis were about 1 inch by 1 inch, how is it possible to get only 3 as an entree?  Another yelper was lucky to get 4!  The dessert - the watermelon was also about 1 inch by 1 inch and the lemon sorbet was smaller than the size of a melon ball scoop.This review is really 3.5, but rounded up.",1,0,0,Honey P.,"Manhattan, NY",12,78,2
5.0,8/12/2014,"We ate at Butter on a Saturday night after seeing a Broadway show a couple blocks away at the Belasco Theater (btw, Neil Patrick Harris was amazing).  We were hungry, a little tired and I was feeling the fatigue of a long day visiting NYC.  Thankfully, the ambiance is subdued and even soothing.  We were seated at a long, comfortable booth that could have seated 6.  The service was attentive but it never felt like they were rushing us.  I thought about ordering a Manhattan, (as we were tourists visiting Manhattan) but instead I started with a Briar Bramble cocktail, which I think it's a Butter creation.  It had Woodford reserve bourbon, blackberries, elderflower liquor, tawny port, and fresh lemon and it was delicious.  My wife had a homemade soda (made from Gorzynski Ornery Farm rhubarb, demerara sugar, and sparkling water).  This soda was probably the best soda I've ever had.  It was SO delicious but for 8 dollars, it really better be.  For an appetizer, we split the Chicken Liver Mousse ($10); served on a piece of matzo with a schmaltz vinaigrette.  (And did I mention schmaltz!!)  It was possibly the best thing we ate in an entire weekend of binging in NYC.  It's a generous portion; enough to share with two because it's over the top rich but I could have eaten the entire thing myself.  SO GOOD!!Right after we finished the chicken liver, I noticed a staff member in all black speaking with a table across from us...turned out it was the Iron Chef / Chopped judge herself, Chef Alex Guarnaschelli.  Being as polite as I could, I corralled her over to our table and she couldn't have been nicer.  She was obviously working hard in the kitchen as she was covered in food smudges but she took the time to greet three tables in our corner and was truly a terrific ambassador for the restaurant.  Chatting with her for a few minutes was a wonderful treat.  My wife ordered the roasted chicken (I was in shock!  chicken?  here??!)  It was good.  Not over the top great...but it was roasted chicken.  If you come here, don't get the chicken.  I ordered the Berskshire grilled pork chop with collard greens and crispy ham hock.  It was fantastic!  The little pieces of crispy ham hock stole the show!  It was a nice size portion and I was pretty full but it was too delicious to not finish every last bite.  If I return, I will try the ""Butter cut"" ribeye that looked amazing.For desert we split the rhubarb and raspberry crisp.  It came out steaming hot and it was an appropriate end to the meal.  Sweet but not cloyingly sweet...and obviously very fresh ingredients.  The berries were bursting with flavor.  We saw the table next to us get the raspberry beignets (donuts) and they looked okay but just a so-so presentation.  I was glad we ordered the crisp instead.  Now for the important part, they had great, individual unisex bathrooms with lovely scented candles burning.  Cost Summary:  One cocktail, one homemade soda, one appetizer, two entrees and one desert, and our tab came out to $100 before tip.  It was quite an experience for that price.  I think it's a great destination for date night or any special occasion.",3,0,2,Alex R.,"Evanston, IL",0,16,3

3.0,8/12/2014,"Came here for Restaurant Week dinner (summer 2014).Entrée - Portions are so small! My friends got the ravioli (main dish) and it was only 4 pieces of ravioli that could be finished in 2 bites. I chose to get the beef short ribs, which was still small, but at least a lot more filling. Some reviews mentioned that it was too dry, but I thought it was marinated perfectly and loved the way it was falling off the bone. Appetizer - I got the veal bacon, which was thick and not too much oil. On second thought, I might have chosen to get the soup of the day instead (very rich corn chowder on the day that I came), as the veal bacon wasn't anything special.Dessert - I got the plum tart (delicious! very satisfied) because I wanted to try something less ordinary than chocolate cake. For people thinking that the chocolate cake might be larger because it's so ordinary, don't be fooled - the slice was only an inch wide or so. Definitely recommend the plum tart over the cake.Other - the bread is delicious, I should've requested seconds and called it a day. Best bread that I've ever eaten, hands down.

The service was pretty good although we had to wait a long time between getting our bread to getting our appetizers (maybe 40 minutes). I had the lobster rolls which were delicious and a pretty large portion. I had the hanger steak as my entree, which I ordered medium well. And yes I know ordering steak medium well isn't the best, but both I and a coworker ordered it medium well but these steaks definitely came out at a solid medium which is what most everyone else ordered. When we asked them whether this was medium well they just told us yes it was....which they clearly weren't, so we sent them back to be cooked more. This definitely was the reason this place isn't getting 5 stars. The steak itself was good though.

3.0,8/8/2014,"Restaurant Week experience: 3.5 stars.I've been meaning to come to Butter for the longest time, so when I saw the Midtown location on the NYC Restaurant Week list, I didn't hesitate to make plans. Overall, perhaps because it was not the regular menu, the experience I had was a bit wanting.The staff here were all extremely friendly; smiles all around from the maître d' to the busboys. The space looks amazing, and I constantly found myself looking around at the décor.I tried two cocktails here: a Rittenhouse Manhattan and a Cherry Blossom, which is their house cocktail with rye whiskey, morelle cherry, yuzu, and fever tree seltzer. They definitely made a great Manhattan (but $18!!) and the Cherry Blossom was good, albeit not a very strong drink (it is summer, after all).We all ended up getting the veal bacon as the appetizer and the short rib as the main. I got a side of the chilled kale, and we split almost half and half on the plum tart and chocolate cake.The bread and butter that they brought for the table was amazing. The warm rolls were perfect, and the two types of butter (herb butter with coriander, parsley, and garlic, and regular butter) were both very delicious.The veal bacon was pretty good, flavorful with the mustard and spicy coleslaw adding a kick to the palate, but we found it to be a little too charred, especially the ends. Made it taste a bit bitter.I can see why the short rib is their specialty; it had a wonderful texture and the flavor was great. The kale was well seasoned as well, and was a pretty good side for the richness of the beef.The desserts were a bit lacking in my opinion. The chocolate cake was boring, without much flair (aside from the crème fraîche that was seasoned well with some spicy sugar). The plum tart was too sweet (not enough sour flavor from the plums to cut the sweetness). I mistook the plums for apple when it came out. It was definitely the stronger of the two though. The lemon sorbet was good.My biggest complaint overall was that from the moment we entered to the moment we left, there was an excessive amount of waiting done by my party. We had a 9:00 reservation and were not seated until close to 9:40. It took another 20 minutes to finish taking our orders and get our drinks, and in between courses took a bit longer than expected as well. I guess it's to be expected, since the restaurant was overbooked at the beginning, but once it got a little less crowded I feel like it could have been better.I'm pretty happy that I got to try out Butter, especially since it's been on my list for a while. But this experience opened my eyes to the fact that perhaps it's not the best idea to come to a restaurant on Restaurant Week. Especially for the prices, I don't feel that the experience lived up to what it could have been.",4,0,0,Tom Y.,"New York, NY",325,243,257

Would love to come here again to try some of their other menu items.One of the coolest things about this restaurant is that they make bread for each individual table (as in it's made fresh).

4.0,8/1/2014,"My first, much anticipated dining experience at an Iron Chef restaurant. I have wanted to visit for about a year and finally made it. The outside is totally low key and you may walk right by if you're not looking for it. Like that it's a little off the beaten path right in Midtown.After making it downstairs, it's dark, yet hip and cool. Was seated right away and sort of bummed that our reservation got us the first table so we missed out on the entire restaurant experience - it was sort of like eating at the kids table. Food was a mix - some hits, some misses for my friend and I. We started with the Hawaiian Yellowtail which was just awesome. beautiful, dainty but packed a nice flavor punch. I then got a radish salad which was perfectly tangy and light. My friend got the Artichoke soup which was reviewed as just ok. For my main course, I got the pork chop and oh my. First I didn't know pork was cooked to different temps like a steak so learned that. The pork chop was a beast of meat over some collard greens, an awesome dijon-y type mustard and crispy ham hocks. I imagine this is what I'd eat if I grew up on a fancy farm. My friend got the striped bass and liked it but again, no rave reviews on that.Dessert was a chocolate cake with coffee (french press) and jasmine tea (teapot). Cake was good - not great. It was a chocolate cake. I didn't want to marry it. Coffee was great.Service was good - a little bit stuffy. Our waitress was friendly but also a little bit like the sales clerks in Bergdorf's.

3.0,7/29/2014,"Came here for restaurant week and I was a little disappointed. I should have read these reviews more carefully because the service WAS horrible. Service:Took forever to order, then they brought us warm white wine.

They didn't even tell us the specials until after we got our drinks and he asked if we were ready to order. Food:The food was good, but not AMAZING. I had the cold cucumber soup as an appetizer and it honestly was just eh. I had the chicken entree which was DELICIOUS, but they give you small portions for restaurant week (which the waiter acknowledged when we asked before we ordered) but it just seems SO not worth the $38 (+ tip/tax).Atmostphere:The place is beautiful, but it was loud.

2.0,7/14/2014,"Came here for my girlfriend's Birthday dinner. We were expecting a great dining experience. It was quite mediocre at best.To highlight the positives, the food was great. The cocktail was a bit weak for $16, but it tasted fine. The crudo yellowtail appetizer tasted fantastic. For the main, she had the pork chop and I had the ribeye steak. Very juicy and delicious. Negatives: SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE.The waiter was slow and not attentive. When he was attentive, he was rude. We sat down and had out filling of tap water. We had more than enough time to decide what to order (cocktails, appetizer, and main). When my girlfriend had question about the cocktails, he decided to put his arm over the back of her chair and get real close and flirtatious. Probably to even get a peak since she was wearing a low-cut gown-dress. We were sitting in a booth mind you, so it's not exactly like sitting in a regular chair where you can easily do this, so it was definitely noticeable. The drink orders were slow. As in, we got our appetizer first before our drinks. and when we did get out drinks, my glass was noticeably dirty. I had a clear drink so I could easily tell. There were literally chunks of stuff inside the glass. How they didn't notice, I do not know.The main courses tasted great, but the there was a bit of a wait time from when we finished our appetizer to when we received the mains. Usually, it's not a huge deal, but this place was not busy. It was a Friday night granted, but this place was pretty empty considering. Only about a quarter of the restaurant was full, at best. I'd hate to come and experience this place if it was a full-house, considering the crap service we got when it was a quarter-full. Considering that this was a special occasion dinner, and I even booked the reservation through OpenTable with the note of ""Birthday Dinner"" on there, the service was just crap.

2.0,7/14/2014,"I came there mostly because of Alex Guarnaschelli's name. Being an Iron Chef long time fan and visiting New York, I wanted to experience the food she offers. Well, what can I say? I'm giving only two stars to the restaurant and that's being generous. We came in with a reservation for 8pm and the restaurant was empty. Literally, empty on a Sunday night. This should have been a warning for us, but we didn't take the hint.We were seated and it took waiter forever to take the order for drinks. Basically, each step was taking forever. I can't find excuses for why considering there weren't that many people in (our party and maybe two other tables).Bread arrived after appetizers have been served and eaten. The bread was delicious, no argument about that - but the wait for it made me believe it was baked specifically for us!Appetizers were good. We ordered burrata and tuna tartare, both were up to the par, with cucumbers in the tartare cut in perfectly pearl shape. Chicken liver mousse disappointed, it was over salty and simply weird tasting, with too big of a portion on too small of a plate.Entrees were also good. Steak was melting in the mouth, bass had perfect crust. Picked beets were super! We were doubting whether to order deserts considering how long it was taking the waiter to do anything, but we still did. He messed up on coffee orders (not a big deal, since coffee at least made it to our table). Desserts were to die for! Raspberry beignets were pure temptation, and rhubarb crust boasted gentle flavor that went perfect in combination with chili ice cream, leaving spicy aftertaste in the mouth.I loved the food, I hated the service. To sum it up, I am rather disappointed with the restaurant that has Alex' name on it. If she claims to be the executive chef, she is definitely not meeting the standards she sets on TV.

They serve it frozen at their outdoor area, will go back to give that a shot. At the table we started with the bread and butter, which was great. Terrific fresh out of the oven brioche. We had several appetizers, the best of which were the Brussels sprout and ricotta toast, the veal bacon and the burata. The Brussels sprout and ricotta toast was particularly delicious. I had a martini with thyme blue cheese stuffed olives that was also quite good. For the main course I shared the ribeye for two. It was pretty massive and quite tasty. Cooked expertly to a true medium rare, not east for a steak this thick. The only improvement it could use would be some additional time in the dry aging box. Going longer than the standard 28 days would've made a difference. Others at my table had the scallops and salmon. They didn't love either of them. The ribeye definitely stole the show. For dessert we shared the doberge torte, a yellow cake with chocolate filling covered in a salted caramel coating. It was quite good.

2.0,6/29/2014,"Butter is more like margarine. When you go to an Iron Chef's restaurant you have a expectation of a level of  a well-rounded excellence in your culinary experience. I selected Butter for our pre-show dining spot over many other options because it was Alex Guarneschelli's  and it was close enough for our 7pm show.  In an effort to get a total experience, I made reservations at 5pm. When we were able to check-in at atheir 10 minute late opening we notified the hostess we were heading to a 7pm show, she assured us we had plenty of time and would notify the waitress. We also told our waitress. She immediately took our drink orders and we also gave her our full order. We got our drinks and apps very quickly. They were delicious. Then things came to a screeching halt. Our waitress had a twelve top that were two families with 8 children. We did not see our waitress after that until my husband walked up to her at 6:20pm asking where our dinner was.  She told him they were plating the dishes at that point.  Another 10 minutes went by when he again asked where our plates were, and asked to see the GM.  This is where things really became unreal at an Iron Chefs restaurant. The GM was arrogant and dismissing. His youth and obvious lack of the importance of being service oriented was unbelievable.  He bent over backwards to deny it was a service problem. He blamed it on the back of the house, I'm a chef, I understand the coordinated effort of the front and back of the house.  It does not matter who is at fault, our experience was ruined and we wanted to be heard before we fast food ate our meal. He did not listen to our point, which he should have taken the blame on his shoulders. The problem was not the food, it was good for what time we had to consume it instead of enjoy it. It was communication.  Our waitress was very attentive to the twelve top bringing soda's to the family of kids. Folding their napkins the multitude of times they got up to talk to their parents. I was realizing she thought she'd done enough for us and completely lost sight of our time limited dining window.  We wanted to be told it was coming by our waitress or any of staff member.  We wanted her to stay on the kitchen for us, her first service of the night.  Instead we had to do that. We finally got our meal at 6:35pm over an more than an hour and a half later.  Iron chef's restaurants should have timing of meals down pat. We did enjoy the meal with its fresh ingredients and comfort food at a exquisite level.  But when you have to wolf it down to get out on time...well you heard my point.  I like to have an experience along with my meal.  David Burke, Tom Colicchio and the true iron chef Moritmoto have experience to elevate their restaurants. Ms. Guarnaschelli should forego the young good looking front of the house staff for a more experienced and managed staff.  Excellence includes SERVICE and the client is always right.

Our waitress was very nice and apologetic but when we spoke to the manager about it he was extremely rude and blamed us for ordering food that takes a long time. It is the restaurant's job to recommend something that doesn't take as long to cook if they're concerned about the time management.

4.0,6/28/2014,"I expected to like it. I came in through their door expecting to leave satisfied. I was right. It wasn't spectacular, but good food nonetheless. I've tried Butter when they were still in NOHO; cute little spot. A bit trendy for my taste. And now they seemed to have a change in their crowd. Maybe because of their new location; 90% were business men and families. Not a lot of young people out on a date nor were there a pack of girlfriends on a Friday night. So I came in 15 minutes early before I was supposed to meet my friend. I decided to wait at the bar. I ordered a ""calamansi"" drink [vodka with watermelon ice cubes and calamansi limes and something else] made by this pretty red head bartender. I sipped for about 35 minutes. Then I went up to the receptionists, who by the way were extremely friendly, and asked to be seated at our table. And there I waited for another 45 minutes. Of course I ordered another one of this vodka drink and they brought me bread. I drained my battery and then finally my friend arrived. I must say, the waitstaff were polite. It was a busy night but they didn't bug me about whether my friend is really going to show up. Anyway, I was a little full when she arrived. With two drinks in me and some bread and butter as well. We ordered the lamb sausage pasta and two orders of the ricotta and wild mushrooms on a bruschetta. All of them were appetizer sizes. The ricotta and wild mushrooms was Yummy. Very light. almost airy and the flavors were simple yet memorable. The lamb sausage pasta was like a decadent, elegant mac and cheese. Also yummy. For dessert we had the Bergammot creme brulee. Who doesn't want to end the meal with a creme brulee. Even though we were both full, we knew we had to get dessert. The dessert menu is very attractive. Make sure you ALWAYS make room.

4.0,6/21/2014,"Got a recommendation to try this place from the guys selling comedy tix on the street. Since it was one of the iron chef restaurants, my bf was excited to try it. We had a bit of a hard time trying to locate the restaurant. Once we walked in, we walked down stairs to lead us to the restaurant. We got there a little before 5pm on a Saturday so it was pretty dead aside from a party of two who were waiting to be seated. We had to wait a bit until the restaurant opened at 5. We didn't have any reservations but that wasn't a problem. The hostess was real nice and accommodating. We got seated about 10 mins later in a booth. Atmosphere real nice, cozy and intimate. Perfect for a date night. Since we literally toured all day, we didn't have time to go to the hotel and change into dressier attire so we felt a bit underdressed, being in shorts, a blouse, and sandals. Everyone was dressed up.  Ordered this spicy chili margarita which was so incredibly tasty! $16 for cocktails though seemed a little steep. I ordered this salmon entree which was delicious and my bf had steak which was perfect.Service was great.

The ravioli was very bland. I ordered steak for my entree. It was a bit fatty but very tender and well seasoned. I asked for a medium cooked steak and it was perfect.  It came with a few potatoes, also good.  For dessert I shared the sorbet and creme brulee.  The sorbet was very good but the portion was small.  The creme brulee must have been prepared earlier in the day.  The sugar on the crust had not been freshly torched and it was cold and hard.  I had to remove the crust from the dessert and I noticed another diner at another table did the same.

The good:- decor, modern but with a few homey/mumsy touches that stopped it being too corporate like the flowered ceramic water jugs and decent hand cream in the bathroom- the servers, ours was 5 star. Really helpful in picking wines and allowing us plenty of tastes so we ended up with the exact bottles we wanted. Was a real shame they bought our second course before we had finished our first but our waiter sorted it quickly- the drinks, cocktails were really nice (very girly but not too sweet) and the wine list was really goodThe bad:- sadly the food. We hit the raw bar to start but the steak tartare was cold and fridgy tasting without any of the lovely unctuousness really good freshly made tartare has (like it was pre-made hours before). Tuna carpaccio was sullied by way too many adornments that killed it's delicate flavour. We skipped entrees for a selection of appetisers - kale salad was well dress but the fridge hard, machine grated Parmesan added nothing. Duck rillets were ok, fatty and rich but the toast they were served on was rock hard. The mushroom & ricotta toasts were cold and congealed, again toast rock hard and inedible.

The presentation was bland and actually looked rushed.  When we said we didn't want it, the server was a bit surprised and wasn't sure how to handle the next steps.  I guess NOBODY has ever returned food before?  A manager came over and was super helpful, apologetic and wanted us to know they would do whatever it would take to make it right.  She asked if we would like to order another set of entrees that may not take so long and she recommended the halibut and a pasta with lamb sausage.  Sounded good.  We went for it.  It cam shortly after she left the table.  The presentation was appealing, but the halibut was raw in the middle and the pasta was so crispy it was like crunching chips.  We had a few bites and just thought, ""you know what - they tried - but it just isn't happening.""  We asked for our check and, as they should have - they only charged us for our wine and starters.  I believe they felt bad.  But, have to say - for all the buzz this place had gotten it didn't live up to any of it for me.",1,0,0,Michael L.,"Manhattan, NY",14,7,1

The waiter was not attentive and was even rude when dealing with the cold pasta and dry chicken  situations.  Second the food: We had a party of 6 and ordered a lot of varied dishes.  For appetizers we had the ricotta mushroom small plate, the duck small plate, the burrata salad. Overall, people liked the mushroom and burrata plates but did not enjoy the duck at all.  There were only 3 to the order and no one even wanted the last one.  Also, the bread and butter they serve was warm and delicious.For the entrees we had the duck, which my dad thought was amazing; the pork chop, which my sister and brother both thought was fine but not great; the chicken, which was so dry that my mom had to send it back; the ribeye which was more medium well then medium; and the lamb pasta which arrived cold.  When we told the waiter he was rude and snappy and pretty much said it's been sitting on the table even when we said it arrived cold.  Cold lamb sausage....not sure that's how it was supposed to be served.  We also had the potato cake and artichoke sides. Both were pretty good.For dessert we has the layered cake, raspberry beignets, and the creme brûlée.  My family really enjoyed he beignets although I thought they were just average.  The rest was just ok.Overall the food was mediocre at best and the service matched their health grade...B at best.  We expected much more from this caliber of chef.

4.0,4/21/2014,"Had dinner with my family here last weekend -- five of us, a lot of sharing. Overall, a really nice meal with some hiccups. High points: delicious oyster service, perfect ricotta and mushrooms on sourdough toast, charred cauliflower, beet salad, artichoke gratin and pork chop. (Pork chop was the best main plate of the night. Sad it wasn't what I ordered.) For dessert, we ordered the yellow cake, the beignets and the rhubarb crisp to share. All good, but the beignets were really special. Also, gorgeous build out.Not-so-high points: With the exception of the oysters, every seafood serving was unreasonably small. I ordered seafood straight through -- yellowtail starter with the scallops as a main plate. Yellowtail was excellent, but serving was so tiny, it was almost an amuse bouche. Two of us each ordered scallops. Waiter said there would be four. We each got three silver-dollar-sized scallops (perfectly cooked, should be noted) and did not feel sated. Ordered as many sides as we did to fill up. This is not 1984. Portion sizes should be reasonable across menu categories. No points for being tiny. Also, there were no oaky and/or buttery whites by the glass on the wine menu. They sold out of their by-the-glass Chardonnay -- and as the only one drinking white, I didn't want a whole bottle. So my only choices were several green, citrusy, fruity whites. I ordered the half bottle sauv blanc, and it was so sweet, it was almost a dessert wine.",3,1,0,M. G.,"Manhattan, NY",1,35,0

2.0,4/7/2014,"Not recommended. Was so excited to try Butter, but was disappointed. Had read reviews that food was not great & thought they had to be wrong, but they were absolutely correct. For appetizers had kale salad & tuna tarter. They were fine but small and really nothing exciting. I make better at home. For entrees we had the bone in filet, duck dish, halibut steak special and a side of potatoes that were like homefries made in duck fat. Nothing was very good or well seasoned/flavorful, and portions are acceptable but really could be a bit more for the price. Also, although the entree proteins are listed to come with other items on the plate, those are truly minimal and it's basically just the protein on there, so you would probably want to get a side. The wheatberries with the duck were raw, and the potatoes were literally running in grease and were so tiny. For dessert we had the cake (can't recall the name, but was first item on menu). The yellow cake layers were hard and tasted stale. The bread was good, but nothing to rave about; and, they gave a second serving when we asked. The prices are ridiculous for what you get - taste, preparation and quantity. No one enjoyed the meal, particularly at the price-point.The atmosphere is beautiful and the staff was very nice. However, it is very awkward that all tables are booths, so our party of 3 was stuck sitting next to each other looking out into dining room versus facing each other, and other tables looked a but squished-in. Also, when we went on Sat., 4-5-2014, as of then, they had a B rating. Not that this is horrific, but a place as high-end as this should really represent themselves with an A Dept of Health rating. Additionally, and this is completely nit-picky and just an FYI, there are no TVs at the bar and my husband was disappointed to not watch the NCAA games.

We had reservations for a party of 2 on a Thursday evening and upon arriving, we were told our table was not yet ready and waited approximately 10 minutes to be seated. We could see that it was a full house and were seated at a table in the back by the dessert chef with a view of her preparing the fresh and warm bread baskets along with the delicious sweets that awaited us. We started our meals with a cocktail: Duncan and Cora Cora. I was expecting Duncan to be a light and fruity drink but it tasted more like tequila than anything else. I took a sip of my husband's Cora Cora and it was more to my liking. I was a bit disappointed since I was hoping to get my drink on .. Not to mention that the drinks also took some time to arrive.Now for the food... -complimentary warm bread basket with homemade butter: delicious!  The bread was nicely toasted on the outside and super fluffy on the inside, served with a sprinkle of sea salt on top.  -foie gras special: served with a piece of toast and a balsamic drizzle; the foie gras itself was buttery and smooth while the overall dish was a bit tarty and sweet -mushroom and brussels crostini: Yum! The bread was fluffy with a toasted exterior and served with a generous smear of ricotta and topped with mushrooms and charred brussel sprout leaves. It was light yet fulfilling at the same time.  -cavatappi w/lamb ragu: pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the ragu was flavorful offering a nice kick which was unexpected but nonetheless delish.  -pork chops: generous portion of meat and grilled tenderly. It was juicy and charred served alongside a few sprigs of scallion which were also grilled and surprisingly sweet!  -dobosche torte: one of the more popular desserts served at Butter and rightfully so. Picture a large slice of moist yellow cake with dark chocolate buttercream and a hard caramel shell.  Whoa! It is out of this world! Trust me - if there is one thing you order here, order this!

First off we like to sit at the bar.  It normally brings better service but on Sunday this was not the case.We each order an appetizer and said yes to bread.  The appetizers took over 30 minutes to arrive BUT they arrived before a piece of flatware or bread plate.  We had to ask for everything even one of the appetizers. (which arrived 20 after the rest of us finished our apps and it was steak tartar) I could understand if the restaurant was busy, but there might have been 12 people in the whole place.AS for quality the appetizers where in fact the best part of the meal: very tasty and fresh.Our main courses took over 30 minutes again to come out to us.  Thank god all 4 arrived a the same time.  What was really wrong was the quality of the meal.  The Steak (ordered Med Rare came out Med Well and very tuff.)  No one checked up on us about our food.  So once we flagged down the bartender we sent the steak back and didn't order a replacement.  My chicken was like eating a salt lick and the scallops where small but fine.  The duck my husband ordered was only about a 3oz (if that) breast and on the over cooked side of Medium.We did order the raspberry beignets and they where perfectly mediocre jelly filled donuts with a light dipping sauce.I'm a lover of food and eating out is a great experience for me and my friends but between the bad service and the mediocre food I would never go back to Butter again.  I could see how the food and service might have been good at one point but there are way to many other places to dine in Midtown Manhattan.",2,0,0,Jessica W.,"New York, NY",1,12,0

5.0,3/19/2014,"Went to Butter on March 18, 2014. We got a 5:00pm reservation no problem.Atmosphere was beautiful, wooded décor and large ceilings with a massive Forrest lighted panel making the entire place feel open and inviting. There is a fully stocked bar and seating is booth style with plenty of room and comfortable seating. The menu is simple and sophisticated but nothing ""over the top"" that would seem pretentious. Items are broken down into ""raw"" ""Small Plates and ""Large Plates"" and are ale cart. Prices are very reasonable We ordered the following meal: bread rolls and butter were fabulous! The rolls were soft warm slated and light and fluffy.  We were first timers so the wait staff assisted in our orderFirst course:Small Plate Items (appetizers)1) Thick Cut Veal Bacon- Excellent- smoky flavor with red wine mustard sauce.2) Welsh Rarebit- Very good-Bread infused with melted cheddar and ale sauce.3) Winter Green Salad- Excellent salad with persimmons and lemon dressing. Wonderful citrus flavors paired with  persimmons.Main Courses :Large Plates were the 1) Roasted Dry Diver Scallops cooked to perfection, 2) Berkshire Pork chop moist with a wonderful mustard sauce and 3)  the special Branzini fish and spinach (a couple pin bones but cooked to perfection, moist flakey and great flavor. Would definitely order it again.) Our sides included the 1) Jerusalem Artichoke gratin which was fantastic, 2) the chilled baby beets with pumpkin seeds and the 2) skillet potato cake, which was light and airy. (not dense like a potato pancake) Dessert :Our order was the 1) Crème Brule, 2) Apple and Currant Crisp and the 3) Pistachio Ice Cream and coffee. The Crème Brule was outstanding as was the Apple Crisp. A definite reorder next time. The Ice cream was delicious, creamy and very good. Next time I would order the Beignet as the restaurant is well known for this. I only didn't order them because the meal was so filling and the portions were just right. The coffee was served in an individual French press filled with enough coffee for three cups. Overall the meal was excellent, the portions were just right, the wait staff was attentive, water was refilled constantly, plates cleared and table cleaned after each course. Service was fast, efficient and service staff was helpful in assisting in selecting dishes. Dinner was a great value too at $250 for three including tax and tip (No Alcohol ordered). BUT HERE IS THE BEST PART!! it was an early sitting on a Tuesday evening and Alex Guarnaschelli was there. She spent a good 10 minutes just talking to us, giving us a little inside information on herself and the restaurant. She was wonderful to take time to speak to us and she was a real delight. She even personally inscribed a copy of her book ""Old School Comfort Food"".  This is definitely a repeat restaurant experience and a place that should be tried by any Food Network Fan.Definitely Go Here!!!",1,0,0,Steven S.,"Morganville, NJ",0,17,6
5.0,3/17/2014,"One word: divine. Such an elegant dining experience & an unexpected gem in the heart of the hustle & bustle in midtown east. A big fan of Executive Chef Alexandra Guarnaschelli from her appearances on Chopped & Iron Chef America, & I was excited to try her restaurant last month with a friend one night after work. Now, weeks later, I am still dreaming about my next encounter with Butter...The food was exceptional and the restaurant decor was above par. An upscale restaraunt with high class folks, for sure. We weren't super hungry as we had some cocktails at happy hour at a different bar right before stepping in, so we just ordered a few plates to share. Each dish was phenomenal, but the portions were not generous by any means :) We ordered a salad (Di Palo's Burrata), a pasta (Ricotta, Pecorino & Quince Ravioli) and a side dish (Jerusalem artichoke gratin with gruyere). My favorite dish from our selection was actually the Jerusalem artichoke side dish! It tasted like a healthier version of Mac'n cheese. So yummy!! The Burrata as well melted in your mouth ... in fact, the whole dinner was amazing. Next time I have a few extra bucks to spare, I will definitely indulge on more of Butter's divine dishes.

2.0,3/15/2014,"I had a relatively unpleasant experience dining at Butter Midtown. My reservation was made 3 weeks in advance. We got to our table (not in the main dining room area but near the bar) and very quickly the waiter started rushing us to order. Long story short, we wanted to have a luxurious, enjoyable dinner but we were told we had to place our entire order at once and soon, (as opposed to choosing appetizers now and deciding upon the rest a little later) because the kitchen was closing AT 8:15pm because...there was a private party coming and the kitchen could only handle that party! We literally had 10 minutes to order everything - and our reservation was for 7:30pm! We asked the manager why they allowed us to even make the reservation. It was really unpleasant.To ""make it up to us,"" they gave us a complimentary dish that looked like macaroni, but it had meat in it (ham, I believe, but am not sure), and I am a vegetarian, not to mention Jewish. And, I hate to say it, my friends (who were visiting from out of town for a birthday celebration) said it was not good.As for the food...it was not special and not even always particularly good. Now, there were some very tasty appetizers (the tuna tartare was very good as was the winter salad), but the scallops were salty and too rich for our taste.I've never written a bad review, but this was a very unpleasant and disappointing experience.

3.0,3/9/2014,"We had a very pleasant experience, but.... The first thing that comes are these absolutely heavenly Parker House Rolls, that I assume are made in house. They come to you warm with burnished toasty tops sprinkled with sea salt. The rolls are soft, buttery, and incredibly addictive. I ate the two, that were served to us, while my dinner companion looked on sadly. No, I am not a selfish glutton. My companion doesn't eat bread at dinner. Weird right? I personally could have made a meal out of these rolls. Next for my appetizer, I ordered the Homemade Ricotta with Hen of the Wood Mushrooms Toasts. They were amazing. The toast was toasty (duh!) with nice char, the homemade ricotta was creamy, dreamy, and smooth, the mushrooms had a nice deep woodsy flavor, and to top it all were some deep fried brussels sprouts chips. YUM! All the elements together made for a delicious small bite. I highly recommend it. For my main, I ordered the Duck Breast. The first problem was that it was cold. Now, I didn't complain, because I thought maybe it was supposed to be served cold? My friend got the Roasted Chicken, and didn't really enjoy it. Apparently it was bland. Considering that this a high end restaurant. We were both really disappointed in our main courses. However, the appetizers and desserts were both delicious. We got the Raspberry Beignets and the Caramelized Banana Sundae. The beignets were light and airy covered with sugar and cinnamon and filled with fresh raspberry jam. They came with a vanilla dipping sauce, that was creamy and sweet. The service was kind and attentive and the restaurant interior itself is beautiful. Yes, it is loud so be prepared.

The good news is, when we told the waiter, they comped it (hence 4 stars, not 3). And, honestly it was still a decent piece of fish.Here's what I ate (mostly apps, cause I felt like it):Oysters (mostly MA and RI). Really fresh and briny. But, the side sauces were weird and unnecessary. Just bring lemon and horseradish.Hamachi: super good, but seemed out of place, IMHO.Burrata:  To. Die. For. But why the weird sauce???

2.0,3/3/2014,"Alex should change the name of her restaurant  to SALT. I had high hopes for the star chef but knowing that we went there for restaurant week, I lowered my expectation. However, the overall experience was quite disappointing. Starting with the winter green salad, it was the saltiest and oiliest salad ever. I asked the waitress to take away the plate after two bites. She offered to make me another one  but I refused. The saltiness numbed my taste bud. The lobster bisque my friend ordered was delicious but I can get the same thing at Whole Foods. My striped bass was salty and greasy as well. I had to scrape off the pad of herb butter on top of the fish. My friend's pork shoulder was salty too, but the texture was juicy and tender. Side vegetables for the pork shoulder was very salty and had too much glaze. Service needs much improvement. The waitstaff seemed unorganized. We ordered sparkling water and out of nowhere a busboy came by and refill my glass with tap while a bottle of sparkling water was sitting in a chiller next to our table. The best part of the meal was the homemade brioche (we got some only because we asked for it). Again, with the salt! They were sprinkled with coarse sea salt which was very very salty. Had to scrape it off. Raspberry beignet was delicious! Without the beignet, I would have rated one-star. The atmosphere was very noisy. I don't think I will return or recommend it to any of my friends.",1,0,0,Alexia G.,"New York, NY",85,68,12
3.0,3/3/2014,"I agree with many of the other reviewers.  I had high expectations for Butter because of the acclaimed chef, but was let down by the food and the experience.  The ambiance is great, but the acoustics are not great, making conversation with your table-mates difficult.  I didn't think the waitstaff did a good job of explaining dishes or attending to our table.  For example, we already had drinks from the bar, yet the wine glasses at the table were not cleared.  It was restaurant week and I had to ask for the menu specifically, when it should have been provided alongside the other menus.  One of my friends ordered off the RW menu.  He got the lamb sausage pasta appetizer, the bass entree and the beignets for dessert.  I ordered the mushroom/ricottoa toast appetizer and the bone-in filet for my main course.  My other friend ordered the octopus appetizer, the duck entree and a side of artichoke heart gratin.  The three of us pretty much shared everything.  Of the three appetizers the pasta and the mushroom toast points were decent but nothing spectacular.  The octopus was completely charred and chewy.  If it were my dish, I'd have sent it back.  My filet was perfectly cooked, but I didn't care for the seasoning and sauce on it.  It was on the sweeter side which is not my preferred flavor profile.  My friend's duck was good, but also sweet.  I knew from the description on the menu that it would be, which is why I didn't select that dish.  The fish off of the RW menu was probably the best entree dish of the night.  The bite I had was light and lemony.  For dessert we shared the beignets and a cheese plate.  I think the raspberry filling for the beignets would have been better suited as a dipping sauce rather than as a filling, since it weighed them down.  The cheese was a nice touch to round out the evening.  I was ready to be out of there by the time the dessert course was served.",5,1,1,Kirun M.,"Manhattan, NY",162,429,0

4.0,3/1/2014,"I think I give 5 for very friendly service and 3 or 3.5 starts for food.  Averages out to 4 stars.First of all, I don't think you have to read too much into how many reviews this place has.  This location opened only 12 weeks ago and the number of review reflects it.  The way they built this new location, they could turn it right into a cool club of some sort.  And those of you who are repeat offender of getting lost, you can leave that concern out the window to find this place.  When you walk on 45th street, on the south side between 5th and 6th Avenue, you will find HUGE writing on the glass wall ""Butter"" ""Alex"".  I say the service was absolute first class.  Because my friend and I arrived extremely early and had to wait for 2 more people to start dinner, we just decided to sit down with cocktails for a while.  We explained that to the waiter of the time and he didn't even blink.  He so welcome our sitting there for a while although his shift was going to end before we even placed the actual dinner order (I hope they share tips amongst everyone who serve a table).  Even people who followed, they were so so nice.  I think Alex&Co know how to look for very service oriented friendly people when they hire people to work for their restaurant.Now food.  I think this is the problem when you have such a high expectation.  Arts (food is culinary art) is tough as is to satisfy everyone because everyone has a very fuzzy definition of ""this is what I like"".  We could be experiencing the same thing on different days and could form a different opinion.  When was the last time you were able to explain exactly how your food is?  We can say ""delicious"" ""moist"" ""great spice"" things like that but beyond that, feelings are not quite describable right?  So when you expect something great and you encounter it, you only have so much room to improve from wherever and whatever you were expecting. And of course I was here for restaurant week, so the content might be a bit different from what the restaurant normally provides.I started with lamb sausage pasta, bass for main and beignet for dessert.  There is nothing I can complain about food.  I think I liked my appetizer the best.  They are definitely not afraid of using spices.  What otherwise could be described as cheese sauce based pasta with sausage meat, I really loved it and cleaned all sauce with bread.  Bass, broiling was done to perfection so you could eat skin which I sometimes don't like to do unless it is done well like this bass was done.  For those of you who have big appetite, you may want to avoid ravioli as it is the tiniest dish of the three that you can choose for your main course.  I don't know if they have pastry chef, but dessert was not quite up to par with the other food.  It was very...""normal"".  Second option, which is a very decadent ice cream sandwich, could have been better also.  But of course I am a big dessert person so it could be hard to please me.",0,0,0,Harumi U.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",44,134,1815

Butter was the first stop on my 2014 Restaurant Week tour. I'm a big Chopped fan so naturally was excited to see what Alex Guarnaschelli's place was all about. I ordered the endive salad, ricotta ravioli, and raspberry beignets from the RW menu. The salad was SO over dressed I struggled to finish it. I actually like pesto but this dressing was just too heavy and not how I would have liked to begin the meal. I enjoyed the ravioli, it was a good sized portion and the mushrooms had nice flavor. The beignets were served warm and with a vanilla-icing type dipping sauce. They were already sprinkled with sugar though so I found using the sauce made them a bit overly sweet.

3.0,2/22/2014,"Yes, I'll admit, I was one of the tourists brought in by the celebrity chef. I'm a huge fan of her cooking and so I wanted to see what Butter was all about. I think, and some other reviews have pointed out, that the restaurant has potential, but it's still finding its footing. For example, the cocktails had the pricing and experience of an upscale cocktail bar. But if I had to listen to the bartender complain for one more minute about the ice machine being broken and how she had to make crappy cocktails because of different ice, I was going to lose it. She was rude to the other bartender, and your guests shouldn't hear back-of-the-house stuff. Aw, poor thing, your barback hasn't set things up perfectly for you? First world problems. When we get to our seat, I become a little confused about the menu. Is it small plates to share? Appetizers? Primi/secondi? We decided to do a smattering of small plates so that we got to taste a variety of flavors, and our server seemed very confused about this option. No matter, he promised he would course them out for us so that we got a few at a time. A bit later, all five plates arrived at the same time. Oops. Now, if you want to talk about the rolls, Butter is on a whole different playing field. Those rolls are balls of heaven. Warm, oily, delicious. I need to check out her cookbook to see if the recipe is in there. I could make an entire meal of those things. I love the sea salt on the table (I'm really over restaurants not allowing me to salt my food if I want). The food was delicious, truly, but the service and setup felt like it wasn't quite sure what it was supposed to be. Laid-back tapas bar? Fancy multi-course menu? The servers didn't seem sure, nor were we. I'll forgive them, as long as they keep the rolls coming.",2,1,2,Kristy C.,"Reno, NV",425,646,333

The appetizer was heavy -- it came in a sort of cheese sauce that was too thick but lacked flavor. The sausage was way too spicy for my taste, so I tried to eat around it as best I could. We waited and waited for our bread basket to arrive, but it never came. Finally, we asked the waitress for our bread, and she made some weird excuse as to why it hadn't shown up. Just a few minutes before our entrees were served, we were finally delivered our bread! And wow, the bread was definitely the best part of the meal! So chewy and tender and buttery and salty. YUMThe entree was just okay. The pork shoulder, while filling and flavorful, was a little one-note. I couldn't finish the large portion of pork that I was served. My boyfriend was less than pleased with his ravioli, but played the jew card and chose not to help me eat my pork shoulder.

3.0,2/20/2014,"mmmmm... Butter. The name brings up thoughts of smooth, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. But how does it translate to a restaurant? Let's see.The first thing you notice is the decor and environment. The dark stained wood and grunge-ish vibe is a good setup for this place. The music though... a tad too loud for a place like this.I got the lobster bisque for an appetizer. Trying to be stylish, I was delivered a bowl with lobster and then had the bisque poured on separately. An unfortunate side effect of this is that the lobster was not cooked with or in the bisque, meaning I was severed lobster WITH bisque and it was a bit disappointing. A place named butter better have some good bread. And the bread here is great, except on the night of my visit I received the bread a good five minutes before the arrival of the main meal.On to the main meal: I forget the exact name of the entree, but it was the restaurant week ravioli special. Being Italian, I've had a lot of ravioli in my life. And i was conflicted. The ravioli - ricotta cheese, chives, was perfect. However, my ravioli came in a plate of pure oil and chives, adding nothing to the meal but extra calories. I would rather had just a plate of ravioli then this crap that made me sick.The dessert were beignets which were... perfect. Light, heavenly dough mixed with the perfect dipping sauce.

4.0,2/19/2014,"I would give this place a 3.5, but I'm bumping it up to a 4 because I believe it has potential and also because Yelp doesn't allow half-stars :)The ambiance and decor of this place is great. We were a bit disappointed when we got there as there were about 3-4 dishes in the online menu that weren't on the in-house menu, and, of course, we were looking forward to those 3 dishes the most. The service was mediocre and I agree, for the price and prestige of this restaurant, it could've been better. The waiter could have been a bit more attentive and yes, there are a varying amount of waiters and bus boys coming to your table to service you. The food itself was pretty delicious but missing some sort of ""zing"" I would say; however, I understand that the restaurant was going for a more simplistic type of vibe with all of their dishes. The dish is simply the dish and that's it. It would've been nice to have some side with the steak. The buratta was absolutely incredible, but my veal bacon had some tough, uncheweable pieces in it. Yellowtail tar tar was awesome and perhaps the best dish of the night was the bread and the cream of mushroom soup special. Our first cocktails were delicious (one with gin, the other with watermelon ice cubs - can't remember the names), but out second choices were kind of medicine-tasting (the pear and the ""Duncan."") Bonus points for a well-executed dessert and for bringing out a French press when you order coffee. Coffee was on point and delicious. Overall, I expected a bit more of everything for the price and for the prestige. We got to see Chef Alex, though and it's impressive to know that she actually does work and cook there.

I ordered the Anjou and Forelle which is a sparkling wine and pear liquor concoction and my boyfriend had the Warm Empire Apple Cider. Both drinks were so good we had two rounds. The Valentines day prix fixe menu did not disappoint. I ordered the foie gras appetizer, chicken with butternut squash for my main, and dark chocolate cake for dessert.

3.0,2/6/2014,"I believe this is one of Alex Guarnaschelli's joints. Given it's location (and its reputation as an Iron Chef restaurant), it can be reasonably expected to cater to tourists and/or the after-work business crowd. Keep that in mind when you dine here. Nonetheless, the food did taste good with all the right flavors. The two tartare appetizers (tuna and steak) will satisfy most people, but they do rely a lot more on the manipulated flavors of the kitchen than on the natural freshness and intrinsic flavors of the ingredients themselves, the latter of which is what I'd prefer. The raw yellowtail appetizer, though, was a fun mix of citrus and mild spice with every bite. If you fancy a salad, the kale dish is the best option among the five in my opinion.During my most recent visit somebody in my party ordered the gnocchi special, and I thought that tasted great. The sea bass and the pork chops were also prepared very well, and contrary to my feelings about the tartare dishes the main courses did emphasize the natural flavors of the meats much more.My favorite entree here would be the bone-in filet that when cooked to a medium rare is really a nice treat for your taste buds. The side dishes aren't worth your time unless you'd like some additional vegetables with your meal. The dessert selection is smaller than what you'd expect, and it's only decent. The cocktails aim to be artisan-crafted, but I think they lack flavor and carry too much water. While Butter won't make anyone's list of the best dining options in Manhattan, it's certainly worth trying at least once if you live in the city.

4.0,1/29/2014,"Three and a half starsWent to Butter Midtown last night (Tuesday) with my girlfriend.ATMOPHERE - Beautifully decorated space. You have to walk down a flight of steps to enter the restaurant, very warm and invitingGREETING - hostess was fine, certainly not overly friendly, she said she had to check on our table when I noticed that there were about 30 percent of the tables unoccupied. The gentleman that brought us to the table was very friendly and actually shook my hand and welcomed us.SERVER - Very very nice guy, although his knowledge of the menu seemed a bit limited, asked him to describe a simple fish dish and he told us it was new on the menu and he wasn't familiar with it and kept telling us to get the duck, I asked how it was prepared and he told me he recommends it medium because it could be a bit gamey. (skipped the duck and went with the fish)DRINKS - great selection of alcohols, specially the whiskeys, the bar itself was very nice and the service was very attentive.FOOD -  started with the oysters, which were good and fresh and well displayed, hard to go wrong with oysters. Beet dish, which again was fine, didn't blow me away but again a little hard to mess up beets if they are cooked properly, and had the simple striped bass entrée, which came out so overcooked it was inedible. I rarely ever send back food, but in the case it tasted like tuna out of a can.  I sent it back and they sent out a new one which was actually cooked perfectly and delicious.  OVERALL - I will go back, it is a nice addition to the neighborhood, it is a feel of downtown in midtown.  I think it needs some improving but those kinks will most likely be worked out with time.",0,0,0,Andrew E.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0

We ordered ""rarebits"" for an appetizer (which is fried bread bites with a melted cheese and mustard sauce), which was pretty good. The chicken with brussels sprouts was yummy, but the true winner was the pork chop with shitake mushrooms.

1.0,1/26/2014,"My husband and I used to live in NYC and come back pretty regularly for work and to see family, so we continue to try to stay current with the NYC restaurant scene as much as we can.  This past Friday night, we just got into town after a long transcontinental flight from LA, and went to Butter.  I made the reservations because of the proximity to the hotel and because of its association with an Iron Chef.  We brought his employee on her first trip to the Big Apple.  Big mistake.This was the worst restaurant experience I've had in recent memory.  To start off, we were already hungry and tired.  We had a 9:30 reservation which we were on time for, but the hostess said to take a seat while they waited for our table to become available.  No estimate on time, no friendly reassuring chit chat or even a smile.  20 minutes pass by with the hostess and male host blankly standing there chitchatting/trying to look pretty like actors or models/not doing what hosts should do.  My husband is tired of waiting and asks what is going on.  Still not much help.  Another guy who must be some sort of manager finally manages to let us know that yes, he will set up our table.  As we are seated he apologizes for the long wait (the only apology all night).  We were not very happy at this point, but were hoping for things to turn around with the rest of the service and with the food.  We were just flabbergasted by the lack of professionalism by the two hosts (I have no idea why this restaurant needs two hosts when neither of them actually does anything closely resembling hosting).  The two hosts seemed to be there simply to look good, not there to actually do any real job.  They were not friendly, had no sense of urgency, no warmth or caring for the customer's needs.  They did not do anything to try to get us seated sooner and did not offer any reassurances or apologies.  The only one who seemed to care at all was the guy who finally seated us, he seemed pretty frazzled and the only one who seemed to take his job seriously.  I know this restaurant is new but this seems like a deep systemic issue with their front of house operations.   The restaurant was not able to redeem itself at all.  First, we had a waitress who had the longest, most pissed off looking scowl you could imagine.  She had actually walked by us as we waited for our table and scowled at us, so I was a little put off to be seated at our table.   At this point we needed some cocktails which came pretty slowly.  When we got the cocktails we were biting at the bit to order, and our waitress seemed a little pissed off that we wanted to detain her to order food right after she delivered our drinks (WTF? what kind of hurry is she in??)  The cocktails were decent, if expensive ($15-$16/ drink).  The food started off well, with wonderfully delicate house made rolls and the welsh rarebit which I guess they're known for.  I read that their roast chicken was very good, so that was my entree.  At first I didn't notice that something was off, considering my tireness, but as I continued to eat my dish I noticed two weird things- one was that the sauce was severely oversalted, two was that the chicken cracklings that topped my roast chicken was actually cooked in rancid oil.  I didn't quite realize all of this until I had already hungrily eaten over half of my chicken, too late to send the food back. I was really perplexed by the weird taste of  the chicken skin and asked my husband to try it and he confirmed my suspicions. And honestly what was the point of complaining to our waitress, when she was already in her mood, and I was in no mood to fight.  I love chicken skin and they really did disservice to it here!  My husband's duck breast was solid, but nothing to write home about.  We both really liked the South Carolina grits.  I really wanted to like this place.  When we first stepped into the restaurant we loved the look and the ambiance, and hubby's employee was impressed (it had the feel of a hip NY place).  But it was all downhill from there and no one attempted to make the experience better for us, neither the front of house or the kitchen.  We were both expecting more based on Chef Guarnaschelli's reputation, but the combination of horrible service and badly executely chicken have made us vow to never to eat here again.  We left feeling angry and duped, which is such a bad feeling to have after eating out.",5,4,2,Jialing W.,"Santa Monica, CA",73,185,75

Our busboy literally picked up plates as we were eating off of them, no one checked on our table at a decent interval either...

4.0,1/8/2014,"After having been to the downtown Butter a few times, I was not sure what to expect when arriving at the new location in tourist central. The space is downstairs and has a lounge feel. It is huge. The bar area was impressive and had some communal tables, not a bad place to grab some drinks and light grub. There are many booths in the dining area which is very rare for Manhattan. They even have booths for large parties - something to consider if you are coming in with a lot of people. The menu is broken up into small and larger plates. In our experience they take these terms to heart. The small is very small and the large are ridiculously huge. We started with a few of the raw appetizers. The fish was fresh and well seasoned. We had the scallops special with kumquats. Delicious but would have loved more than just a few shavings of the kumquats. For my entrée I had the prime rib special.  The server convinced me to get it but I was unsure because prime rib is not usually something I order. Well he was right and I was wrong. Cooked to a perfect medium rare bursting with flavor from the sauce and juices. It was huge as well. Came with probably the best onion rings I have ever had in my life (something I never thought would even be worth a mention). At the $50 price tag, it was a bit of shock, but worth it in the end.  Their cocktail menu was great. Although again, I thought $17 dollars for my martini was a bit steep. All other cocktails are around the 15 dollars mark. Wine list is short but has some good selections both by the glass and bottle.

1.0,12/30/2013,"Look, so I hate reading reviews that are 1 star and honestly I hate writing them more, if I am writing a 1 star review it means that we didn't have an enjoyable time at wherever we chose to eat and since I picked the place it makes me feel like I did something wrong as well. Having said that I cannot let what happened to us last Saturday go because Butter's staff along with it's owner, Alexandra Guarnaschelli, did not treat us like valued customers and people should know that.  I made a reservation for a party of 8 via OpenTable a month before we were set to dine there and that went off without a hitch.  I also received a call from the restaurant the day before to confirm my reservation, which I confirmed.  The reservation was for a Saturday at 9 pm.We arrive at Butter a few minutes early and we had 1 member of our party that was lagging a few minutes behind.  The 7 of us check in with the host and we tell him that we have 1 person that is lagging behind and asked if that would be a problem.  The host told us that was no problem and that our table was ready but would we mind having a drink at the bar for a minute?  Ok no problem.  10 minutes rolls by and I go ask why we haven't been seated yet, then the real story starts to come out, apparently Alexandra Guarnaschelli decided to give our table away to another party for whatever reason.  I understand that she is the owner but it seems like if I made a reservation they should honor the reservation and while it is her decision to do what she wishes in her restaurant, it doesn't seem like the best way to run a business.  The host says that he is working on getting us a new table and that it will be ready in 10 minutes.  I asked him if that was the real number because I would rather know than be lied to, he said 10 minutes.  So 30 minutes later, no table, I go up to the hostess table and ask what the deal is, the hostess there gets an attitude and tells me that since we had 1 person come later than the rest we had actually only been waiting for 20 minutes rather than 40.  Needless to say I wasn't impressed with that answer.So after I get back from that situation my friends say our table is ready, in the meantime the 8 of us have spent $150 at the bar on drinks while waiting and no accommodation was made in the form of a few free drinks or apps for them giving away our table.  Just when I think that things are starting to turn towards the better they take us to our table, or I guess I should say tables.  They seat us in a large corner booth that is actually 2 tables.  There is absolutely no way for us to have normal conversation.  At this point I didn't even complain, say, or look at the staff, I just picked up my phone and called Quality Italian, they said that they could take us in 15-20 minutes.  I hung up the phone and twirled my fingers above my head and we all walked out.  No one attempted to stop us or ask why we were leaving, how's that for a fine dining restaurant?  They had ample opportunity to because we all checked our coats. I was really looking forward to experiencing this place, but I had a sneaking suspicion that it might be a tourist trap because Alexandra Guarnaschelli is an Iron Chef.  I think this experience confirmed that.  With so many other quality places to eat in Manhattan, I won't be going to any of her other restaurants soon if this is how she and her staff intends on treating their customers.",26,6,2,Matthew H.,"Houston, TX",133,334,645

The whole space is very pretty and open and airy. It doesn't feel cramped or hustled at all. At the bar we had wines - they have a solid by the glass menu and their bottle prices seem reasonable. Here is what we had overall:- Cocktail - warm empire apple cider. Really well made and served in a cup however the little apple squares make the drink hard to sip. Very good though and very warm- Bread with house made butter - YUM! The roll was delicious and hot and flaky and buttery and the butter itself was excellent- Di Palo's Burrata - Super creamy Burrata served with a stewed tomato and brioche. Very good- Warm Grilled Octopus - so flavorful and cooked perfectly. Lightly crisped but very tender. - Cavatapi Pasta - this was kind of a miss because the sauce had a tartness to it - perhaps even bitter. The sausage was good but couldn't balance- Pork Chop - excellent! Great mustard sauce and meaty mushrooms. Served beautifully. Service was very friendly.

5.0,12/14/2013,"Butter has been on my list of restaurants to go to since I moved to New York this past summer. I was disappointed to find out that the original butter on Lafayette was closed down for renovations. However, I was delighted to find out that they opened a second location in west midtown (45th and 6thave)! My roommates and I planned an end-of-the-semester dinner and we decided to finally give butter a try. We were NOT disappointed. Butter definitely earned its stars with me. The first star went to the amazing decor and ambience. Hats off to the interior designers. It was a very modern twist on rustic woodlands. Great for a romantic date. The second star goes to the impeccably clean and pristine bathrooms. The facilities are very large, clean, modern, and they smell great! (Presumably because of the candles). You will NOT feel dirty after using the bathroom - a common problem in many NYC bathrooms. The third star goes to our knowledgeable waitress. Waiters and waitresses were all dressed very well (dresses, shirts and ties, etc). Our waitress came around every 5 minutes asking if we had any questions about the menu. She gladly explained almost every dish for us and went int depth on dishes we were actually interested in. She was beyond helpful. The fourth star goes to the service. Our food came out within 20 minutes of ordering and servers would refill our drinks with nearly every sip! They were always on the lookout to serve us. Finally - the fifth star. This is a given due to the reputation iron chef Alex Guarnaschelli has. The food was DELICIOUS. Mouth-watering, foodgasm inducing, absolutely jealous worthy food. I ordered the Long Island monkfish with a side of sunchokes topped with gruyere.  Flavor was so prevalent and definitely the front runner in the dish. The presentation was also very nice! My monkfish was cooked to perfection, tender, crispy, with a presto glaze over it.

The new Butter Midtown has similarly great food as the old Lafayette St location, but in a much better setting - in fact, the huge bar with communal sitting tables and then private booths along the walls is spot on. Foodwise, the hamachi is a great appetizer to start, and then the foie gras special on bread with tomato terrine is super-succulent. The duck rillettes (essentially a ragout again on bread are also superb), but our hands-down favs were the cavatappi pasta with spicy lamb ragout and the wild boar on a bed of something like Israeli couscous - both were amazingly luscious and juicy in an Italian home-cooking kind of way. For entrees, we had both the tomahawk steak and the filet, and they were both good in their own way: the tomahawk is super-fatty marbled decadence, the filet is wonderfully tender and has accompanying veggies and sauces which cut into its richness perfectly.

To die for..the managers on duty were responsive and professional. The bad: the server was very skittish and scatterbrained. We inquired about a port wine list. Ten minutes later he stopped by to say, ""oh my manager is making a list if port wines now. Then he came back and said, ""oh I know we only have one kind."" He made me feel uncomfortable because he was so anxious. He then forgot to put in our flatbread order. It came out after we finished our entrees.

The hostess was welcoming and smiled which actually can't be underrated when you first walk into the door of a restaurant.I was relieved that the acoustics were good so that I could properly speak with my guest. Barely noticed if there was any music playing.We weren't in the mood for drinking much, but sommelier recommended a tasty vanilla porter beer that was good with what we ate.Warm breads came out with what seemed like homemade butter - hard to find these days, so that was a pleasant beginning. Started with the artichoke salad, which honestly, was ridiculously good. Perfectly cooked and lightly dressed. Servers were nice and professional, not too 'nosey' which I liked.Entrees, again, totally impressed. I had eaten at the original Butter location on a few occasions, but last night's food was particularly tasty, balanced, and flavorful without being too heavy. Definitely a sign that there are some professionals in the kitchen. The chicken had super crispy skin without the grease - almost like a good prep. of peking duck. The monkfish was not over-cooked as it so often is, resembling a beautiful meaty lobster texture. Also, my other big issue with many restaurants is the over-salting which we did not encounter last night - hopefully, it stays that way.
