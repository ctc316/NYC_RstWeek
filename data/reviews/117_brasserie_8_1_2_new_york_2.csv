2.0,4/30/2019,"I used to come here often, but I won't be doing that again. The soft shell crab special was a rip-off. The crabs had no taste and were supposed to be sautéed, but actually were fried. The asparagus appetizer was just a few spears and also had no flavor. The chocolate caramel tart had a crust that was too thick and hard and was supposed to come with hazelnut ice cream, but instead arrived with vanilla. I would have told the waiter, but he never came by. Another waiter grabbed my wine before I was finished with it. Because we didn't have reservations, they gave us an especially bad table, very uncomfortable, out in the middle of the floor and a few inches from another table.

5.0,4/7/2019,"Had an amazing Sunday brunch here and it has to be the best brunch NYC has! You name it and it was there.  Carving station, shrimp, lox, bagels, french toast, pancakes, omelets, pastas, bacon, sausage, fruit, cookies, pastries.... OMG and more. The food was amazing,  but even better was the service. Special thanks to hostess Emily, for accomodating our party with a seat that worked for us using less steps. Our waiter was excellent.  The manager, Ken, was especially excellent and took extra care of our table.  We has such a grand experience here you would think we were the only table, but not so,  the place was packed solid and all staff members were working diligently and moving all over the place. Yet, we felt we received personal attention. We observed a party or two going on with groups, and this seems like a great location to come back with a group of family or friends. Thank you for making our Sunday brunch epic.  We will return again soon....very soon!",0,0,0,Stacy K.,"Oceanside, NY",300,203,217

3.0,2/23/2019,"This place should get 4 stars. But, three major slip ups at the beginning of our meal had me deduct a star. We had an Opentable reservation for a Saturday evening and arrived at our reservation time.  The restaurant was less than 1/4 full when we arrived. We were shown to a table and asked to be seated in one of the booths that were available instead. We were told by the hostess that the server for those booths was not present this evening so we were not able to sit there. Really? I mean, how difficult would it be to reassign the server who was assigned to the table we were being given to one of the booths? We were given menus, offered water and served cocktails. We then placed our order which included the octopus appetizer. At that point we were informed that they were out of octopus for the entire evening. We should have been informed of that when we were presented with the menus.  We ordered from the prix fixe. Hamachi Crudo, Chestnut soup, Codfish, Filet mignon, apple tart, and Gateau Pithivier. We were brought our appetizers and presented with the amuse bouche, Parsnip soup. The amuse bouche was far better than the fatty oily duck amuse bouche that we were given on a previous visit. But this restaurant should know that the amuse bouche should be presented and enjoyed BEFORE the appetizer is brought to the table. As for the appetizers, the Chestnut soup was excellent. The Hamachi Crudo was fantastic but not as described. The menu said it had ceviche, passion fruit, avocado, and mezcal. Instead of passion fruit it had orange, the avocado and mezcal were there, but it was in a yogurt or cream fresche broth that was very spicy. I enjoyed it immensely but it really should have been better described. The codfish was excellent. The filet mignon was cooked medium rare to order. The apple tart dessert was hot and the Gateau with marzapan-like flavor was excellent as well. Coffee was $4.00 additional but was refilled by our server twice. Overall, an excellent restaurant with some caveats.",0,0,0,Bob G.,"JAMAICA, NY",17,213,400

5.0,2/2/2019,"Came with a friend for restaurant week and the prixe fixe menu. Everything was absolutely great. The host and waitress were very nice and courteous and attentive. I like that they come with a bread basket and you choose which bread you would like! Appetizer: Tuscan kale salad with pear, goat cheese, beet, and walnut with a Dijon dressing. I was iffy because I don't normally like kale but everything in this salad is what I normally eat with a normal salad. I was not disappointed. The menu didn't state that there was a beet and it was a nice surprise. Loved every bite. Entree: braised short rib with potatoes and spaetzle and mushrooms. Short rib was very tender and the potatoes and spaetzle were very tasty.  Dessert: chocolate caramel tart with hazelnut ice cream. I have no words. It was probably the nest dessert I have ever had and I eat a lot of dessert. The tart was smooth and creamy, the caramel was thick and had crunchy pieces in it, the tart cake with caramelizad bananas, and the ice cream was amazing. All in all, great experience and great food. I would definitely come back for dessert!",0,0,0,Angie G.,"San Francisco, CA",3,37,39
3.0,1/25/2019,"Restaurant week Jan. 2019 NYC First time checking this place out. The decor is nice and not to noisy a plus. The waiter was  courteous, the wine selection we made was not the best (sharecropper ) never again. Let's get to the food. Appetizer lobster ravioli was a small plate. The flavor was ok not something I would order again. Octopus came with some white bean sauce, also small plate but done well. Main course lamp-shank was in my book the winner good flavor and a good portion. Cod fish wrapped in prosciutto. That's a mistake as the prosciutto takes over the delicate fish. The desert just didn't have a wow affect I think that even if it's restaurant week show us some better stuff. I'm giving them a 31/2 stars how ironic that the place is Brasserie 81/2 haha.

So I thought Sunday brunch would be an awesome thing to do and I was totally right! I knew she would definitely love the all you can eat aspect of it and luckily the food was absolutely phenomenal, from the cous cous salad to penne bolognese to the outstanding desserts everything was nothing short of perfection. Oh how could I forget to mention the omelette station that also had crepes and the carving station with lamb turkey and New York strip. This place is a hidden gem in the best city on earth.

2.0,12/31/2018,"Do yourself a favor and don't set foot in that establishment. We should've left when we saw how empty it was at 8pm. The food was mediocre, almost inedible, to the point where we didn't finish our meals. The bread was cold, and didn't feel freshly baked - not to mention that we only got 2 pieces of bread each (they don't leave a bread basket on the table). The steak was not seasoned, and it was chewy. The seafood platter was subpar, lobster wasn't fresh, shrimp tasted like rubber, and some of it looked flat out unappetizing (wish I had some photos to share, it was that bad). Overall we felt like everything wasn't seasoned well if at all. Worst part is that we were never asked how our food was, and weren't able to provide feedback - almost as if they already know the answer. We felt like we paid $190 for good wine (something they didn't prepare themselves), the fries that came with the steak and a side of mac and cheese - none of which were the main meals.The service wasn't great either, but the waitress was nice. We were 2 people, they sat us in a booth meant for 4, but never removed the extra covers.

5.0,8/6/2018,"We  have enjoyed Brasserie 81/2  many times, but never so much as on Sunday, for brunch.  As before, the elevator took us down to the restaurant level, but here we were confronted with the buffet arrangement on the lounge level.  That meant going up and down some steps, carrying plates of food, which, for my cane carrying husband, would have been difficult.  The hostess immediately assessed the situation, and offered to have a table set up  for us on the upper level, obviating the need for us to traverse steps. We are so grateful!!  Now we, and our guest,  could enjoy the most expansive, enticing, and delicious buffet offerings.  The display was constantly monitored, freshened, and maintained in perfect order.  A most delightful brunch, enhanced by the sensitivity of an observant hostess.  Alas, we do not know her name, but hope she will continue to be a source of pride for this terrific restaurant.",0,0,0,Thelma S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,69,0
4.0,7/31/2018,"It's a very swanky French bistro located underground, with dark mood sci-fi lighting, lots of spacing, and circular booths that make you half expect a mafioso to slide in and show up. I dug the aesthetic, I have to say. Felt like I was transported to the set of the underappreciated Uma Thurman vehicle, GATTACA.I obviously had to order the French onion soup, since it's one of the ""key"" MC3 foods (prime rib and Peking duck the two others). It didn't disappoint, and the cheese is piled on thick just as I like it, even though it makes table manners next to impossible. Try talking about serious topics while having to pull stringy cheese apart as it obscures your face. SMH.Duck was great but a little bad on P2P (price to portions ratio), something like 3 pieces. Ditto, too, with the scallops. Or do I mean SCALLOP. I probably finished all this in like 5 minutes and was still really hungry. Strawberry shortcake helped somewhat, but when I got home, I already felt like pizza.Overall, it's a fun place to hang out, and one of the few places where I felt the moods induced by the internal decor really improved the experience and justified menu price hikes.

It had sausage bits and artichokes in a herby broth.  Compared to Benoit, Jules, and even Rue 57, definitely not worth the price for the flavor.",0,0,0,Tonya Y.,"Mount Laurel, NJ",0,1,0

I had one of the best lobster chowder, really a bisque, to start.  Wonderfully medium filet mignon, and Chocolate terrine that was very rich but satisfyingly chocolate!!  Service was excellent with very experienced wait staff. The wine was a bit pricey, but decent selection. I would definitely go back and will remember it for my special event dinners in the future or for when my European family come to town.

3.0,12/26/2017,Generally I like Patina Restaurants. Maybe because it was late on Xmas? 7:30 reservations and put of two entrees on Xmas prix fixe- venison and lamb.  Husband was so looking forward to venison and me the lamb. The other reason we chose. menu was they had buche Noel on menu besides venison. The buche Noel was major disappointment Tasted  and looked like a rolled  sponge cake with a little cream.  How was that a buche noel?We ordered side of brussel sprouts and turns out they subbed out the sides on entrees to yep brussel sprouts. Now we have lots lots of brussel sprouts which were not so good.Bread was good but never got refill despite request. Service was sweet. Beef bourgonnon was excellent. But wanted venison.,0,0,0,Jane S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,53,1
2.0,12/26/2017,"At the outset, I do wish to make it clear that this was a Christmas dinner. Having grown up with two parents in the restaurant business, I do sympathize with the difficulty of being open on certain holidays and trying to serve dinner on those holidays. Consequently, I can overlook a fair amount. However, at the price point and level of Brasserie 8 1/2 (a place where I have had other meals on non-holiday nights) there were just too many missteps:1. The foie gras terrine was largely flavorless. Part of this was a function of it being way too chilled, part of it was the lack of the buttery, fatty flavor of a top notch foie;2. Both the venison and the rack of lamb were sold out. They were both billed as specials and were part of the reason we came. Some fairly poor planning in the ordering that resulted a disappointed couple of diners;3. The lobster bisque was served tepid;4. The substitute I ordered for the sold-out venison - Beef bourguignon - was billed as being accompanied by Champignon mushrooms. However, it was served with brussel sprouts. That was unfortunate since I had also ordered a side of brussel sprouts and I had been hoping for the mushrooms to go with the Beef bourguignon (a more traditional pairing). That said the dish was quite good notwithstanding the missing mushrooms (another ordering snafu?); 5. The promised Bouche du noel was not. Instead, we were served a dry vanilla cake roll-up with a buttercream filling and a white chocolate icing. A traditional Bouche du noel is supposed to resemble a  yule log. If you are going to go non-traditional, the menu ought warn the unsuspecting diner; and6.  Service was chaotic.On the plus side: good cocktail, very fairly priced and pleasant wine list; rather good bread, and a lovely room.",0,0,0,Marc C.,"New York, NY",6,31,0

3.0,7/18/2017,My first Sunday brunch In NYC the resturant is okay for the price you pay you would think it would look more fancier. Buffet per person is $34. We were a group of 6 including my 8 year old. The food was ok not very flavorful the eggs was really bland no flavor. You would think $34 includes drinks but it doesn't cappuccino is $5 and coffee or juice was  $6. I find it odd since ever other buffet that cost less includes drink. The end since there was not any real service because it was a buffet and we served ourselves not to mention that the coffee was disgusting with 2% skim milk after wanting creamer and cappuccino was barely hot we asked for the bill they made a mistake in adding my daughter regular adult price they fixed it but than after we paid we put a tip again no real service. She walked away and called 6 other waiters to show the amount of tip that was given and visibly upset. So we called her over after her scene and asked if she was upset at her tip again no service was a buffet. She said that it was just a topic amongst her co-workers and agreed it was about the tip. And stated it's whatever you feel comfortable with but considering the amount you paid it should match? Hmm so we added more tip and left.

3.0,4/12/2017,"Came to Brasserie 8  1/2 to try their renowned Sunday brunch buffet (note that this brunch option is not available on Saturday). It is a unique buffet brunch in New York City. While buffet brunch styles are popular in other areas, New York City doesn't have many (this is the only one I know about) options besides hotel breakfasts.  Brasserie gives you lots of options- salad, pasta, fish, and meat, as well as an omelet and crepe live station. The omelet was incredibly delicious- much better than an omelet that you would get as an entrée at a restaurant. The rest of the food is average- which was a little disappointing after trying the omelet. I would suggest you take one walk around before grabbing a plate because you will have buyer's remorse when you are full and can't try something new you just spotted. I'd also suggest taking a small portion of everything so you have the ability to try everything! The dessert station is also extensive- cookies, cupcakes, brownies, mini muffins. Make sure you save some room for that! The restaurant itself is quite large and reservations are pretty easy to snag on Open Table even with late notice. For an extra $14 per person you can add on unlimited mimosas with your meal. While this might seem like a deal, the drinks are pretty weak. They were probably 85% orange juice and 15% champagne. I would suggest just asking for straight champagne instead. The restaurant and the servers are not jumping on your to turn the table- instead they encourage you to stay for as long as you would like (until 4PM) and keep eating and drinking. This is a great spot for a group gathering to take a while and catch-up. With the drink option, your can expect to pay about $50 per person excluding tip.",5,0,0,Priya S.,"New York, NY",219,155,94

Brasserie is located in the Solow Building, though it has its own dedicated entrance on 57th Street. Walking in you're greeted by the hostess and a large staircase leading down into the restaurant. The architecture the dining room as a whole is very dramatic - it almost sits in an atrium which makes the restaurant have a very open look to it. The bar is long and lines the back wall, and the low lighting creates an intimate feel. The color scheme is warm with mostly reds and oranges.We were seated in one of the private rooms which was spacious and decorated nicely. For starters we had a beet salad which came with field greens and slices of brie (mmmm). The salad was pretty good, kind of simple but the beets and cheese made it stand out. For my main I had a choice and went with the salmon. The fish was cooked well, nice flavor and good crisp exterior. It was served over spinach and white asparagus which was good as well. For dessert, each table had a plate of mini brownies and cookies. I was initially kind of turned off by this, I'm used to second class treatment at these kind of dinners but sheesh, they looked like they came out of a box. To my surprise however, they tasted homemade - and really good! In hindsight I appreciate the portion control, summer is coming ;-)Overall, I enjoyed myself at Brasserie.

They have a section for cold vegetables, traditional breakfast foods, a hot food section of meats and pastas, and then a dessert bar.Highlights -They weren't joking with the macaroni and cheese... I know it's a faux pas to get a filler dish at a higher end buffet, but I couldn't resist. The macaroni and cheese was delicious.

I ordered a pretty standard banana, nutella and strawberry crepe. It was nice to have it made fresh to order!There was a lamb & steak station as well. I had a small slice of both. The seasoning was good for both, but I felt like the meat was a bit chewy for both the meats.Lowlights -Service was pretty bad once we sat down. I think it was just our waitress in particular.

Our original server didn't explain anything to us in terms of where the food was, or if we should wait for our drinks to eat.

Out of the various appetizers, I tried  the yellowfin tuna tartare and the jumbo lump crab cakes, both of which were phenomenal. The main courses were just as good. The loin of veal over angel hair pasta was probably my favorite dish but the sirloin and duck were an extremely close second.

I liked the golden beets and salmon roe, but could have done with less of the fromage blanc. Atlantic cod: This was cooked perfectly. A good sized portion that was tender and slightly crusty on the outside. The sauce with cannelloni beans was light, to really let the fish shine. Absolutely the best dish. I also liked the escarole.

My wife had the seared Tuna.  We also got the mac&cheese, truffle fries, and asparagus side dishes. We had two desserts; the pear tart and chocolate plate.The food was all prepared to perfection.  I would rate it a 8/10.  Everything was very good, nothing wrong but nothing spectacular.Decor - The space is impressive.  It is a very large restaurant with a very large cocktail lounge/bar area.  It is in the basement of the Solow Building and has a great entrance/circular stairway that opens up to the cocktail lounge.  Without this stairway design, the space would probably feel closed and dark.  The decor is a bit dated.  Not tired, just dated.  The building was build in the mid 70's and the space feels like it pays homage to that era. Service - Our server, Sarah, was outstanding.  Very professional, helpful and courteous. The other help was okay.  We had a couple of errant items show up at our table which was not a problem - but something they need to work on...Value - Between the $45 prix fixe offerings (they have more than one) and the BYOB  (no corkage fee) policy on Sundays and Mondays, it is really excellent value for a great meal.My in-laws visit NYC several times a year and this is one of their ""go-to"" dinner spots.",0,0,0,C L.,"Norwalk, CT",1,66,2

Our server explained that she was ""new"" so we forgave her occassional disappearance when our glasses became empty. BUT they sat us right in front of the main wait station, so its a mystery how this happened more than once. I was expecting at least 3 courses for the prix fix (Appetizer, Entree, Dessert)- but they only offer two, with sides and desserts served a la carte. This will EASILY put your bill well over the $42 mark as they average $8-$12 each.I ordered the crab soup (app), king crab legs (entree) and mac n cheese/brussel sprouts (sides).The soup was slightly warm, not hot. They were generous with the chunks of crabmeat, so that was nice- but the flavors weren't very bold or memorable.The king crab legs come already shelled (thats right, you are not getting actual crab legs, rather crab leg meat). They served it over a weird mash (yucca? sweet potato?) of some sort that tasted aweful.The crab leg meat was delicious (save for the bits of shell that the chef must've missed), but again- you AREN'T getting crab legs, just the meat, which is false advertisemwnt, no? How am I supposed to know if I was REALLY getting King Crab?The mac was edible, but barely. The cheese was thin and runny and again, the flavors just were not there.As for the sprouts, they were the tiniest ive ever seen and you guessed it....flavorless.My partner ordered the surf-n-turf which felt pretty sad on arrival. The surf was 2 tiny crab claws and the turf was not cooked to temp.They do serve an ""amuse buche"" compliments of the chef- but its seriously lackluster.After all was said and done, we shelled out $128.

This is a French brasserie, so you will have steak frites and the other standards on the menu. What really struck me was the atmosphere: it's not a typical French brasserie feel, but rather very sleek and modern. It was a new take on French with an edge. The minute you walk inside the restaurant, you are enveloped by a grand, winding staircase downstairs. You are led to a spacious, contemporary, largely colorless space minus the bright neon lighting.

I started off with a yellow beet salad which had beautifully slides beets wrapped in goat cheese. It was very refreshing and the goat cheese wasn't too potent in flavor either. There were some greens on the side that had a little salt, pepper, and olive oil but I wish it had more flavoring.For my main dish I orders a filet minion with haricots verts. The cut was cooked a perfect medium and the knife went through it like butter! The greens has a nice crunch but could have used a little less salt. My friend had the branzino and it had a nice crispy skin, however, she said it tasted very bland. Dessert, my favorite course, is where it went a little down hill. We both ordered the citrus tart but the crust of the tart was so hard that our knives couldn't break through! I had to do a little whacking with my fork when some of the crust finally fell through.

5.0,1/28/2016,"When I visit NYC, I hope every bite will be wonderful. Brasserie 8 1/2 achieves that goal. Here is our lunch restaurant week experience. We both got Gravlax appetizers. Interestingly, they reversed the bread to fish ratio. Little 1/2 inch square pumpernickel pieces sat on each salmon slice.  You get a nice crunch with the bite, but you are taking in 99% protein. Little sprigs of lamb's lettuce added green color, and thin slivers of pickled beets added acidity. The fish was delicate, and hand carved. A beautifully conceived start to the meal. For the entree course, Carole got the cod and I got the duck. Her cod was cooked perfectly. Moist, flaky and tender. The accompanying cocoa bean and escarole greens added textures and mild flavors that  complemented the fish. Then there was my duck leg. The skin was nicely rendered to provide crisp bites without a lot of fat. The meat was perfectly cooked. A parsnip flan added some nice contrast, with a root taste, along with poached quince and huckleberry gastrique since fruit complements duck so well. A word of caution. Do not mix the huckleberries with the duck in the same bite.  The tartness of the berries overwhelmed the more subtle duck flavor. Carole got the citron tart for dessert. Not all yelp reviews have been kind to this dish. Let me reassure you that if you are a lemon tart person, you will be delighted with this one. The crust was crisp, the lemon custard had just the right consistency. There is the right amount of puckering power. And you can call on thyme scented honey and creme fraiche to enhance the dish further. Finally , I had chocolate cake.  It was made with valhrona chocolate, and grand mariner creme anglaise. The grand mariner is subtle, letting you to focus on the exquisite chocolate.  Chocolate is where I want my focus to be so I was very content.  Setting and service were without fault.

5.0,9/7/2015,"Like I said in my brief review from 2011, this is a sophisticated, elegant restaurant.  The food happens to be stellar, as are the drinks.  Brasserie 8 1/2 has been a family favorite for years now, and I have had some wonderful dinners (including a few Thanksgiving) there.  Some of the best things I have there include pumpkin risotto served in an actual pumpkin, an unbelievably good cocktail with the always delightful St. Germain that I shared with the rest of the table only because it felt wrong to keep something that good to myself, and various seafood entrees that have been consistently wonderful.A large part of my job involves food--ordering food for office events, planning parties, making reservations, and sometimes bringing in my own concoctions for contests--as you can see if you follow my reviews.  I have a lot of autonomy which allows me to get creative and have a bit of fun, but with that comes responsibility.  Not too long ago, I sent one of the managing directors I support, who has discriminating taste, to Brasserie 8 1/2, when asked to find a special place he had never been to before.  The next morning, he came to my desk and said to me, ""That was not only the best meal I have had in New York, but probably the best meal I have had in a long time.""",5,2,2,Caroline B.,"New York, NY",457,1247,36

We really enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant, definitely a good date night place. I have to say the food was excellent. I ate here with a friend and we both tried different dishes in order to get the most out of there prix fixe restaurant week menu. My  favorite out of the dishes was the Ravioli appetizer, Yum! My friend enjoyed her Short rib the most.I never leave reviews for restaurants but the one thing that made me leave this review was the service, I have been living in new york for the past 3 years, being a foodie I dine out several days a week, doing this I have experienced many wait staff and the one I had that night was by far the best. My server was a young very handsome Italian man who had just the most beautiful name. His knowledge on both food and wine was astounding and he was a wonderful conversationalist. He knew the perfect balance of when to speak to us and when to let us enjoy our meal, The restaurant seemed pretty busy at the time which would have made me think the service would have suffered but it didn't in our case. You can find good food just about anywhere in the city but this service was one of a kind, my friend deeply agrees. I'm going to come back for brunch, hopefully to have the same experience. If you find yourself dining here try to ask for the server we had, I'm sure the other servers are just as good but he seemed one of a kind, His name was Giuseppe I remembered because its same name as the shoe designer.I would rate the food 8/10 Only because I didn't enjoy the desert as much as I did the entree's (I had the lemon tart)I would rate the service 10/10. 12/10 if I'm being overzealous.",2,0,0,Elizabeth B.,"New York, NY",0,1,0

The kale salad was good, but generic. Anyone can make a basic sweet vinaigrette and add some cranberries to kale. The lobster ravioli left me disappointed - decent texture on the pasta, but the filling was lackluster and the sauce lacked gusto. The entrees were better - filet was very good. Great cut of meat and cooked to a perfect medium rare. No outstanding sides and the green peppercorn sauce was a throwaway. Short rib dish was very good. Loved the chunks of bacon in there. The Meyer lemon tart was great! Sweet and tart with a yummy, crunchy, thin brûléed top. Vanilla macaron was my favorite - macaron was perfectly done and the chocolate ganache filling was excellent. The addition of the hazelnut ice cream was the perfect way to round it out.

The service was a little confused on the eating rules/layout and such like where I can eat at the bar or not. At 8:30 I was offered a drink special menu that expired at 7. The food was nice. Buttttt I was a little disappointed in the filet au poivre .. Love this dish and sauce and pepper (lacked any true pepper ) The flavor was on point but they under cooked it badly . The re cook was prefect. (note they also brought my entree out 30mim before the  app.. (It happens wrong fire button etc) but the lobster rav app was nice when It finally came. Bartender was super nice  guy .maybe they should help him out with more consistent food options since it comes out inconsistent..But he was very professional on all levels. Nice dude .  Anyway filet although flavor was there I pulled about 1/3 of it out my mouth due to fat balls (which I don't expect from a filet) and put on plate. Wine was nice and reasonable in price.

Two of those are for our waiter who managed to sweet-talk the chefs into giving me the warm molten chocolate cake as my pre-fixe dessert instead of the lemon tart or the poached plum. By golly, if I want some hot chocolate fudge oozing out of its fragile puffy shell right after downing two pretzel rolls and a giant slab of roasted salmon ... I actually wanted two chocolate molten cake desserts and maybe the beignets if I was still feeling peckish but decided, in a rare moment of discipline, that I needed to exercise some restraint. The escargot pastry was kind of insubstantial for $13 but then again I have never been hugely fond of snails either. The pastry puff flaked everywhere so I ended up just peeling parts of it off of the cup with my hand. Truly charming, I tell you. Still don't know why the waiter decided to stick his neck out for me. I almost forgot: the roasted salmon came with these four tiny olive gnocchi that were so decadent I wanted a separate bowl. I had already asked for more bread even after they had taken away the bread basket so y'know ... settled for staring glumly at my empty plate after all the gnocchi had been polished off. The presentation is classic French.  Let's put everything on a big giant white platter so the food looks positively minuscule in proportion.

From the street you may give it a second thought as we did but do yourself a favor and venture through the revolving door and descend the wide stairs and mozy up to the bar as we did.Decidedly sparse when we came in, the restaurant quickly filled up and we were lucky to find a nice quiet-ish place at the bar. Much quieter and spacious than most New York City establishments, you can easily carry on a conversation here. This review only covers dessert and ambience as well as service. If you're just coming in for drinks, they put out an impressive array of nibble foods-- Bread sticks, olives, salami and pickles. The cordial bartender came promptly and delivered us some water and a smile. We chose Beignets ($10) that came with three dipping sauces- raspberry, caramel, chocolate-, a capuccino for her ($4.50), a double espresso ($6) and a snifter of Chambord for me ($11.50).Everything came out promptly and we enjoyed our after-dinner coffee and dessert. The beignets were light and airy and paired well with the dipping sauces. Sacrilege, I know, but I'm not a big fan of chocolate, so my lovely date had most of that while I enjoyed the raspberry most.It's the city so don't be shocked when you eat as we did and the bill comes to $35.

3.0,8/6/2014,"This is a tough one; I'm really a 3.5. I thought my experience was way better than ""A-OK"", but I don't think I'm a fan (meaning, I'm not, like, already planning my next dinner here.) I came for Restaurant Week with a friend and we had an overall great time.I had the Ravioli de Homard (lobster ravioli), the Filet Mignon, and the Peach Tatin. I also had two (yes, two!) of the wheat rolls and butter. My favorite parts of the meal were the wheat rolls (I'm a fan of really good bread and butter...call me simple, I don't care) and the Filet Mignon. The ravioli was good, but not lobster-y enough for my taste and I thought the ratio of filling to dough was off (not enough filling, too much dough.) The filet, however, was cooked perfectly (I had it medium rare) and it just melted in my mouth (yum!) The peach tatin was fine, but nothing I'd write home about -- good presentation, though!The service was wonderful. Our waitress was sweet and not intrusive, but still made sure we were alright, and the hostess was pleasant, as well.I also liked the decor/ambiance. I'm a booth kind of girl and this is very much a booth place (unless you're a table of 5+.) There's just nothing I dislike more than sitting in those diner-style, super close tables and having to listen to the woes of the diners next to you. Here, if you're in a booth, you're, like, on your own private island -- you don't even really see the other diners. This is also a pretty classy place -- swanky bar, lots of people in suits, etc.",2,1,3,Melanie W.,"Raleigh, NC",146,139,64
3.0,8/2/2014,"Leaning towards 3.5.Went with a group of friends for restaurant week dinner and catchup. BTW if you are a vegetarian/vegan, this is probably not the restaurant for you; although very accommodating to my vegan friend, there is basically nothing on the menu that doesn't have some sort of fish/meat in it. Therefore she got an assortment of veggie sides.The restaurant sits in the basement of a large office building. The space is upscale and a bit cold-- seemed like a business-dinner type of place. A couple of tall floral displays breathes a little life back into it. The food was alright, nothing to write home about. A generous bread basket is offered, including a decent nutty whole grain. We ordered the ""pate de campagne"" and ""fleurs de courgettes"" as appetizers. I'm not a big fan of pate in general, and this one's flavor is strong. Not for the faint of heart. The zucchini blossom was a little disappointing. It could have been crispier, the flavors could have been more concentrated, I was looking for a pop of something to make it stand out. Everyone got the ""Loup de Mer"" as an entree, which had the same fate as the zucchini blossom. Although it was perfectly cooked, it lacked the crisp skin of a good fish sear, and everything was very mild. Forgettable. Dessert was a little better. The ""coupe aux cerises"" was a good combination of flavors, but I recommend the ""peach tatin."" It was a more sophisticated dessert, and something you would expect from an upscale French restaurant. To be picky, the peach was a tad sweet and the pastry a little too crunchy... I was chasing my pastry across the plate and leaving a trail of crumbs. The plate had a rather monotone flavor: sweet. Overall, I think there are better restaurants out there especially at this price range (i.e. Nobu 57 across the street). There is somewhat a lack of detail to the food, although everything is plated up pretty (adorable tiny pots and pans for my friend's side dishes) and portions are decent.

I kind of wish i tried stuff from the actual menu as the restaurant stuff menu is nothing special.Service - 4.5Server was good with some humor. I like the fact that water/tea was refilled all the time and when we arrived the server gave us time to have a little conversation before jumping in to serve us. Professionalism is there. Our table was wobbly and server tried to fix it, but there isn't much you can do when 5 ppl are at the table.

The dining area is very beautiful with nice booths, couches in the waiting area, and a lovely bar. The restaurant is huge, but there were only a few tables full for Saturday brunch. Not sure why, but it's probably because it's underground so people passing by won't really notice it. First thing is that I love how this restaurant serves bread. I feel like so few restaurants in NY give bread baskets these days. They had amazing wheat rolls and baguettes, and I love bread so that was a great start. For my main course I got the duck with eggs, frisee, and french fries. The duck was so crispy and a hearty portion, the egg was perfectly cooked and still a bit runny, and the fries were incredible and everything was seasoned well. I couldn't believe that it only cost $15 too. Their desserts looked great as well- the table next to us ordered some type of parfait, and sorbet, but we were too full to get dessert.

3.0,3/7/2014,"Came here for restaurant week after going through a bunch of menus. Left with no bad impressions, but also no good ones.....pretty consistent 'meh' experience throughout.We had the goat cheese terrine and the duck confit salad with poached egg to start. The salad was pretty tasty, and the egg was perfectly poached. The goat cheese terrine though was probably the most unremarkable 'goat cheese appetizer' we've ever had (we are obsessed with goat cheese in appetizers and always order them when a menu has it). It was still good, because goat cheese and beets is a hard combo to mess up, but nothing I'd remember by tomorrow. For entrees, had the duck and the braised beef short ribs. The braised beef fell apart on the fork - verrry verry tender! But the flavor ..ehhh...and somehow the bacon didn't add to it at all? (but it's bacon!!). Portion size was larger than what I was expecting though, which was a plus since I hadn't had lunch.The duck was extra 'meh'. It was very standard fare, nothing about it stood out - presentation, taste, preparation, creativity of ingredients..I forgot how it tasted and looked by the time dessert came.  The kitchen was also subbing one of the components on the dish all night but waitstaff didn't mention it, which I'm not a huge fan of. We don't have allergies and will eat anything, but on general principle I feel the diner should be informed of substitutions. Dessert - dislike macarons in general, so can't comment on that. The lemon tart was VERRRY lemony - like, warhead lemony. Luckily I am a huge fan of lemon so this was not a turnoff, but the bf heavily disliked it. Just like the appetizers and entrees, the desserts had nothing so out of place/bad that we couldn't finish the dish, but we also weren't going ""OMG YEA ONE MORE BITE"" at any point in the night.Ambiance is nice, there's a nice low hum of chatter that's not overwhelming, and the servers were all kind, if a little unpolished at times.

4.0,3/1/2014,"It was for the oversized spiral staircase, taking me downstairs to a theatrical space (as in size), that made me have a notion that I was off to an exciting culinary journey in what it seemed a simple modern approach on an art-deco oriented interior.  It was a 12:30 PM, and the oversized French dining room was full of mid-aged suited businessmen, who looked as though they were regular clients, closing off deals.My order of goat terrine added a smile on my face.  Although it was a playful dish, it certainly carried so much of maturity (could it be due to the three pieces of candied walnuts scattered in the playgrounds of my appetizer?  Or was it the rolled golden beets around the mild cheese? Umm; or both, maybe?! ). The taste notes of the terrine had a dijon mustard with orange juice dressing.  Fantastic is how the dish turned out to be, to say the least.  Poitrine de Poulet aux Porcini was what I decided to have as a main, when the other entrees were the braised short ribs and a dish consisting clams.  The thin, finely cut breast of chicken I had felt so tender and juicy as though it just came out of a rotisserie.  What complimented the taste was the sautéed Porcini mushrooms hidden below the well-roasted brown skin of the chicken.  The presentation included Pumpkin grit-style puree, drizzled with black truffle oil.  The addition of steamed Brussels sprout gave the dish breath of freshness.  The meal was complete with an order of the Vanilla Macaron stuffed with dark chocolate ganache, served with a side of hazelnut ice cream.  The Macaron tasted too sweet, which was not bad at all, but a side of fresh pears compote (since they are in season, anyway!), instead of the ice cream, could have perfected the overall outcome.  The lovely dining experience, with friendly ""smart-casual-y"" service, made me think that I had finally gotten to know where to have a chic, informal lunch when in the midst of a shopping spree in the heart of Fifth Avenue!(Review of Brasserie 8 1/2 Lunch Visit on Tuesday, February 25th, 2014)",0,0,0,Victory O.,"Manhattan, NY",5,15,217

It was such an elegant set-up, I sort of felt like Cinderella coming down the spiraling staircase! The maître'd sat us earlier than our reservation which was very nice. There were two of us and the table we sat at was quite large. It felt kind of awkward being so far apart from each other. The apps we got were incredible. We both shared the foie (possibly the best I've ever had), the tuna tartare, the short rib consumme, and the goat cheese terrine. I couldn't say enough good stuff about the appetizers, but the entrees (we both got the duck) fell short. The chestnut seemed like an after thought by the duck. The element just wasn't incorporated enough for me to enjoy. We got the lemon tart and the macaron for dessert. My co-worker and I manage a bakery so we're BIG on dessert. We even bought a couple hundred dollars worth of baked goods for the kitchen. So when dessert came out I was sort of disappointed with it. I wouldn't recommend the vanilla macaron, the lemon tart was alright. Good, but forgettable.Another note that I would like to make was that though our server was nice enough, he seemed to be annoyed that he had to serve the two of us. That might not have been the case by any means, but I just not feel welcomed at 8 1/2. There was one gentleman that came by and asked if I liked my cocktail (there was very little missing from it) and that was the first and last sign of hospitality that I received.At the end of the meal while paying our checks we received a little card that informed us that they would send us a 50$ gift certificate to celebrate our birthdays, but it just did not come off as a place to celebrate anything.",1,1,0,Amy W.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,3,12

The restaurant only had about 3 other tables on a Sunday night in January. We figured it worked in our favor because at least then we could have a conversation and not feel like we had to yell at each other, but it left us a little leery that they weren't any busier on a Sunday night when the tree was still up and holiday festivities around the city were still going on. The place is beautiful and wonderfully designed. The orange staircase, rich dark colors, and cozy seating options create a really comfortable yet upscale atmosphere.We ordered our drinks - my husband got their ""Penicillin"" and I got the unsweetened iced tea. We also ordered a crab cake appetizer - all of which were delectable. It really set the meal off well. I ordered the Steak Frites for dinner and my husband ordered the lamb. My steak was perfectly cooked but was bland which was unfortunate. The lamb too was cooked pretty spot on, but the flavoring wasn't quite right. It was a bit of a let down after such a wonderful appetizer and drinks.I had noted on the reservation that it was my husband's birthday, so when we declined dessert the waiter still came out with a creme brulee complete with a single candle. The creme brulee was out of this world amazing (I would seriously go back JUST for that). I don't think I've ever had it that perfectly made.The one thing that stood out was our server. He was truly the most perfect waiter we've ever had. He was happy to give out recommendations for things to order on the menu and knew enough about the drinks to direct us on what to order and what wouldn't go so well with our food. He was attentive and polite throughout the entire visit. We were concerned he would hover over us since there were only a few tables, but thankfully this was not the case. We over tipped him purely because of his amazing service.If you're looking for a great place to stop for drinks and dessert, I'd highly recommend it, but paying $40 for a steak that would have been better made at home was a big disappointment.

For two and half hours we were there on a Friday night after Christmas, the restaurant were only about 25% full. We ordered few cocktails drinks.

You can learn and explore the proper table manners.  A+We almost picked everything on the menu. From seafood platter, to fish, to lamb , to steak to side soup desert.  The decor for the plate were neat and somewhat different.  For a nice cozy French restaurant, I would expect expensive dish, small portion, unique decor, yummy food.

With a large staircase leading the way to a spacious downstairs dining area and bar, it didn't look like it was open. Oh, it was. There's a lounge area which is very cute, with tables, chairs and couches. Easy for a quick pre-dinner. Ordered the Le Petit Seafood Plateau (a half lobster, oysters, clams, jumbo shrimp, tuna... etc) and fries, in true random fashion. It was all delicious. There wasn't butter though with the seafood mix, which was odd. The sauces were delicious and the fries were a nice addition. Ha. Anyway... it would be interesting to try this out for dinner.

The spot is  perfect for taking your family out for a treat. Negatives: I was however shocked by the service. Restaurants like this generally have impeccable service. I warn that it was Thanksgiving so perhaps they were short staffed. The appetizers arrived in a timely manner but only half the table's. The other half had to wait 15 minutes. Then throughout the night the staff could not figure out who ordered what food even though they insisted on having us order in a certain sequence so they would be able to keep it in order.

4.0,9/25/2013,"To understand this place you have to understand something about New York.  It's simple.  NYC = real estate.  That's all there is to it.  The arts, culture, shopping, cuisine, what have you, are there for one purpose only--to get you to use the real estate (and spend money).  The real estate moguls (not the politicians and certainly not ""the people"") control everything and call the shots.  It's not a cakewalk for them because they fight each other for turf, respect, and superlatives. Brasserie 8 1/2 is a product of these dynamics.  It is an integral part of the trophy building that surrounds it, whose address btw is 9 West 57th St.  Hence the name of the restaurant, 8 1/2 (are we beginning to see the point?).  When you walk into Brasserie 8 1/2, you are entering the mind of an honest to goodness NYC real estate mogul.   His name is Sheldon Solow.  He owns the building (for now; things change).  He wanted a grand restaurant at its base--not the usual 57th St. retail emporiums.  He got what he wanted.  This explains the lavish proportions of the space--the grand winding central staircase, the two long bars, the circular JFK-style lounge, the sunken dining room.   That's his art on the walls.   No doubt this restaurant is designed to impress potential tenants of the building (and justify in part their top of the line rents).  No doubt it will impress you too.  And that's the point--we ordinary folks get to ride on their coattails when we dine here.  And frankly, it's not too bad, especially if you have one of the prix fixe meals which run in the $30-40 range for three courses.  Mine was not half bad, starting with a summer salad and then a nicely poached halibut, and an ice creamy dessert.  The dry martini was well made and the service was friendly and attentive.  The restaurant is so large that a large party at a distant table, celebrating something, could scarcely be heard by me, seated at a table near the #2 bar a football field away.I like this place, mainly because the digs are grand and the food is OK.  Think of it this way:  Mr. Solow is never going to invite you over to his place for dinner; this is as close as you can get.  If you're in NYC, go for it.",5,0,0,Jeff J.,"Chicago, IL",124,352,145

Being a big fan of Blink 182 when I was younger and their ""Take off Your Pants and Jackets"" album, I would pass by this place and be like... ""yo, awkward"". Going in, I was a bit confused. Keep reading and pretend this is a commercial for Old Spice if you will because that how it narrated in my mind. Hello. Look straight. Now to the side. Now to the other side. Look straight again. Walk in and see a hostess. Where art thou chairs and tables? Happily, she points down. Look down. You see this gorgeous lounge area filled with people. Walk down those significant orange steps.

I did not end up being on a horse. I ate like one.Our appetizers and dishes were made out of simple ingredients but it was made sooOooOoooOoooO well. My favorite was the Duck Dish called the Canard. The sauce tasted a bit like BBQ sauce... but really fancy BBQ sauce. The duck itself was not dry at all. The spinach... or what I think was spinach... was a beautiful shade of green. The peach on the side was not overbearingly sweet. Very tasty pretty dish.My mother treated all of us for overpriced food that night based off of the restaurant week menu (which i generally think it's a gyp). However, unlike other overpriced restaurants, for some reason, I would be willing to come back to pay for this overpriced food myself. Probably not during restaurant week though. Yes... one. day.

Since I couldn't go home for Thanksgiving this year, I took myself out to a nice dinner.  Well, my friend Jamillah and her daughter Naomi took me out.  We went to a French restaurant called Brasserie 8 1/2, and I'd highly recommend 1) that restaurant and 2) eating out on holidays.  No clean up! My appetizer: tuna tartare.  It came with flower petals on top, which I also ate.  The girls each had a crab cake.  I love tuna tartare, and while I don't remember it being the best one I've ever had, it didn't disappoint.For my entree I had the braised short rib.  It was smooth and tender and fell apart just from LOOKING at it.  My fork hadn't even touched the food yet and it was falling apart.  MMMMM.Jamillah had the filet mignon, and Naomi had Loup de Mer (fish).  Both were also delicious and tender and perfectly cooked.For dessert, I had the pecan tart.  I don't normally care for pecans, but that was my choice based on everyone else's decisions.  (I'm one of those ""no one at the table can order the same thing!"" people.)  The tart did not disappoint.  The ladies had an apple pie streusel thing and the chocolate trio.We shared a bottle of wine as well.  I remember the service being pleasant -- it was a holiday, yet everyone was chipper and in a jovial mood.  They really wanted to make sure we had a lovely meal.  I enjoyed the space, the food, and the atmosphere, and I'd love to return someday soon.  Plus, my friend said she saw Gail there (Oprah's Gail!), so maybe I'll get lucky next time and see someone else.",0,0,0,Dione D.,"Atlanta, GA",104,606,455

The manager came to our table after noticing and offered to prepare new steaks for us.  I declined the first time, but they insisted.  I was very pleased with the service and the medium rare steak was cooked perfectly but it tasted a little bland to me, even with the sauce on the side.  The dessert, caramelized cheesecake tart was tasty but not memorable.",1,0,1,Jade L.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,161,15

5.0,3/28/2012,"This is the kind of Glamour that I dream of. Mad Men Glamour. The men look like Don Draper and the women look like Betty. Thankfully the crowd is more diverse because it is now.  The decor is that modern 60s glam with the burst of orange. The art is real . The staff is actually nice. The food is amazing. Don't go here if you want diner food, or ordinary food, or cheap food. Although I have to say that for me the price seemed right. Go here if you want glamorous tastes of amazingly delicious food in interesting combinations. It will wow you with flavor combinations and bursts but not overwhelm you with portion sizes.  You will leave feeling just as glamorous walking up that orange staircase as you felt coming down it. My husband was introduced to it at a client lunch (a very glamorous client lunch with a fashion industry CEO) and just knew I would love it. Two weeks later we were back for my birthday.  Tucked into the luxurious semicircle banquette, out of the way, yet able to take part in the whole scene because of a cunningly placed mirror, we both ordered the 3-course dinner option.  It is just not for those who have to have what they know. You must have a glamorous palette to eat here (or you can order a la carte the steak and seafood offerings). I have to say that we were able to do it, and we have likes, dislikes, and allergies galore, but we are also adventurers. We loved every bite.  I loved my dessert, which was called Days of Wine and Roses, which had all kinds of amazingly delicious things in it, like Lychees, rose water, wine reduction, and some kind of fresh green.  I though it was taking a real chance, but given that both of us had even liked the chicken liver amuse bouche, it was not a chance at all.  My husband loved the chocolate dessert of course.  I would describe the main courses and appetizers, but they are too complicated.  They were delicious and the presentation was beautiful.  Also the bread gets a shout out.  Service too.  Really everything.  It was really nice.

It was kind of empty when I went, but it was the beginning of dinner service (it did fill up more latter on).  We all ended up getting different things on the menu, so we were able to try out every item on restaurant week menu.  They gave us a free sample of salmon croquette, which was definitely a plus. I recommend the lamb rib or the cat's ear pasta with rabbit sausage for appetizer. For the main course, the hanger steak was pretty good. At first when it came out, the portion looked really little.

Every single option on the menu, from the lamb ravioli appetizer with straw mushrooms to the nutella inspired roasted hazelnut chocolate mouse dessert, was absolutely phenomenal. Though, I'm going to put in a plug for the truffle mac n' cheese and the nutella dessert. The mac n' cheese was the perfect combination of cheesy, chewy and not too rich - yum! The nutella dessert was just cool: basically, the dish broke down the hazelnut and chocolate components of nutella, serving a chocolate mouse/ pudding with hazelnut biscuits, hazelnut gelato and roasted hazelnuts on top. As a lover of nutella, this dessert hit the spot I never knew I needed. The decor of the restaurant is very chic modern with huge tables and booths - so huge that I couldn't touch hands with the person sitting across from me even when we stretched our arms out. Any other time, I would guess that it's a hub for client dinners and lunches (that distance is there for a reason, I suppose).

5.0,7/22/2011,"Was very pleased with my dining experience at Brasserie 8 1/2! I visited this restaurant with boyfriend using a Savored discount, which gave us 30% off our entire bill. This had us initially apprehensive because often restaurants classify guests as ""the Groupon table"" and treat them as lesser than guests paying full price, but we didn't have this experience here at all. We entered at the top of a high spiraling staircase and the hostess was nowhere to be found. No problem, we went downstairs to the main area of the restaurant where our waiter seated us and understood clearly that we were a ""savored"" reservation. No hiccups there.The decor was beautiful and had a trendy yet classic look. Although we were only a party of 2 they seated us in one of their largest and coziest booths so we could sit next to each other. For 8pm on a Friday night it was pretty quiet but I'm sure it gets louder as the late night crowd rolls in. We were surrounded by other couples including some older folk. People were dressed casually and dressed up. We opted to dressing up for the occassion but didn't feel out of place at all. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. They were walking around with a varied bread basket and resupplied us at every opportunity. The presentation of the butter was very pretty too. Initially we were served an amuse bouche of cold gazpacho soup in a long shot glass. A+ for presentation and tastiness. It was delicious and I am often wary of cold soup, so was very pleasedIn the middle of this the manager of the restaurant came by and thanked us for visiting the restaurant, and even apologized that the hostess was not present when we entered. We hadn't even known the difference, but how nice! They addressed my boyfriend as ""Mr. [lastname]"" and was very professional and courteous.Following that we were served our wine. I ordered a glass of red which the waiter suggested against (even though it was the more expensive wine), so went with his other suggestion that happened to be cheaper! Unfortunately I can't remember which red I ordered. My boyfriend ordered the pinot grigio and was pleased. We paired this with the zucchini blosson appetizer. Deeeelish! It had lobster in it which we could tell was very fresh and had a beautiful display of corn and avocado on the side. This restaurant definitely won in presentation.After this we each ordered the filet mignon - mine medium, his medium well. It came with a gigantic side of fries. We also ordered the macaroni and cheese on the side without the lardo. Everything was great.  Our steaks were cooked perfectly and barely needed the steak sauce. They cooked his medium-well so well that it definitely had the crunchier quality to it, but was still very tender and soft on the inside. Mine was like butter - too good. The fries were, of course, great and the mac and cheese was a huge winner! I'd definitely recommend it as a side to the steak.Lastly we ordered the Night and Day dessert which was perfect for sharing. The Day was a vanilla creme brulee with a tasty wafer topped with a fruit sorbet and strawberry. The Night was a chocolate ganache in the same form but instead with a chocolate wafer on top. Absolutely delicious.I'd highly recommend Brasserie 8 1/2 as a dining destination for your friends, parents, significant others, in laws, or out of towners. Pretty much anyone!

Although I ordered the restaurant week 3-course menu, my two other friends ordered from the regular menu. As expected in ""fine dining,"" everyone's portions looked meager and pathetic. Dainty at best. I found that my first course, a quail egg perched upon slivers of quail meat, would be the most enjoyable portion of my dinner. The main course looked like classic beef stew but it was actually some sort of lamb concoction. The flavor was there but the enchantment wasn't. Finally, a chocolate dessert concluded dinner.The waiter was rather annoying, trying extremely hard to make his restaurant seem classier than reality in this orange-fest (note: decor) of a circus. He reeked of snobbery, which is fine by me, if it were actually appropriate within the setting.

1.0,4/25/2011,"I too am baffled by the good reviews for this place.  I made the BIG mistake of canceling reservations at Telepan to have Easter brunch here.  Food:  Buffet style, and one step above the Golden Corral and Country Buffet type places you'll find in strip malls across the wasteland of American suburbia.  Where to start...the crepes were thick, doughy, and greasy.  The pasta was cold, the game dry, the overall buffet selection uninspiring.  Since when are mac and cheese and Shepherd's Pie upscale brunch selections?  For Easter, no less?  I did order the eggs benedict straight from the kitchen and it was certainly better than the buffet fare.  My boyfriend's French toast, however, was wet and soggy in the middle.  Desserts?  The ULTIMATE disappointment!  They were just awful.  They can't possibly have a pastry chef on staff.  The banana tart tasted like rotten banana mousse.  Oh, how I longed for Billy's Bakery banana cream pie!  The vanilla cake was dry, and the rice pudding had the consistency of GLUE.  Take a hint from Rice to Riches, chef!  The pecan pie was little more than nuts in a dry pastry crust - totally lacking any buttery, gooey goodness you expect in the filling.  The coconut cream pie tasted like chemicals.  They must have added preservatives and/or stabilizers to give the desserts a longer shelf life.  UGH.Atmosphere:  Subterranean.  No windows.  I felt like I was in a basement cafeteria of a department store.  At least the location of the restaurant is close to Central Park, so we were able take advantage of the beautiful weather and have a nice post-brunch stroll.",0,0,0,JC S.,"New York, NY",12,50,2

Our only proviso at the time was that they served turkey, had something 'pumpkin' and catered for children. They did that and more! The atmosphere was light, our server was charming, the food was just delicious - a taste sensation....Now that we have returned to Australia after travelling down the East Coast for 32 days (eating out for lunch and dinner) I would have to say that 8 1/2 served some of the tastiest food that we had in America!!!!

BRASSERIE 8 1/2 ... doesnt something not seems right here???! you say on your menu ""3 course wine pairing"" and yet you only really get 2 glasses. you may need to put a disclaimer on that menu of yours and stop misleading your customers.food was good. nothing extraordinary. i got the ""croque madame"" as my app, the hanger steak for main and the panna cotta for dessert. and someone else mentioned it too, but they're REALLY OVERLY attentive.  i would like to enjoy my meal and actually have some time to close my mouth and chew before being asked if everything is fine. after each course we had at least 2 people come over and ask if everything was fine. i think after the main came out we were asked 3/4 times.  (minus 0.5 star)would i go again. yes. would i always throughly go through the menu with the server next time, MOST DEFINITELY!",0,0,0,DJ K.,"New York, NY",80,23,6
4.0,2/15/2011,"I made a brunch reservation here after reading a Yelp conversation for VDay suggestions.  I was not too keen on the idea of going out on actual Valentine's Day since it was a Monday this year and thought brunch sounded fantastic.  I love brunch.  What a delicious meal.So anyway, when we arrived we checked in first with the woman by the door and then went downstairs.  There was another woman standing right at the bottom of the stairs to take coats.  That was a nice touch.  Then we checked in with the two people at the bottom of the stairs and were immediately shown to our table. Our table was a bit of a walk from the buffet set up and that got a little annoying as the place got more crowded.  So many little children!  Also, the table was pretty big for a two-person table and I felt a little too far away from my boyfriend for the meal to feel romantic.After meeting our waitress and ordering mimosas we immediately went up to the buffet table.  The mimosas have the perfect amount of bubbly in them.  I got eggs, a bagel with lox, sausage and shrimp.  My boyfriend got bacon, sausage and some meat from the carving station.  I laughed at his selection since it was not very well-rounded. The eggs were perfect.  Not too runny but not hard as I would expect from being out at a buffet station.  The bagel with lox was a nice touch and I even threw on some capers for effect.  The sausage was a little well done in the first batch I took but when I went up for a second dose they were much better.  I kept reminding myself that it was a marathon and not a race.  I thought we did very well.  I highly recommend you try the yogurt they have set out with granola and berries.  The first time I went up I passed over it because I figured it would be too filling but I am very glad I decided to try it on my second go around.  I also ordered the eggs benedict from the waitress which comes included in the price of the buffet.  It was perfect and exactly what I was craving.  My boyfriend ordered the french toast and I kinda laughed when it came out.  It looked tough and a bit burnt.  He ate it but said it was entirely unremarkable.  The desserts were nothing special.  I was a little horrified when I grabbed something that I thought was a chocolate mousse and it turned out to be mashed banana.  Ack.  The bill came to $88 and I thought that was decent.  I wasn't concerned about the price of the meal since it was for Valentine's Day after all!  I wonder how much their Mother's Day brunch costs because I would not mind taking my parents here for it. There were lots of large groups of people and I think this would be a great destination for a celebratory meal.  My birthday this year is on a Sunday so that might not be a bad idea...",1,0,0,Jess K.,"Pelham, NY",169,1246,169
4.0,2/5/2011,"My second trip to this place. Both during restaurant week. the first trip was 4 years ago. It left something memorable in me, hence the return trip. The word ""pork belly"" is the biggest on the appetizer menu. guess which item on the plate is the smallest? You guessed it, the pork belly. They lure you in with pork belly and then serve you clam chowder with the smallest piece of pork belly i have ever seen. Booo....the quail appetizer is very good. As for the entree, i had the monkfish tail. My first time having monkfish tail and it did not disappoint. I was surprised by the textual (not your usual melt in your mouth fish texture) but later it became clear to me that monkfish tail is also called ""poor men's lobster"".The lamb entree was solid. Good flavor and the taste of the lamb stood out without being overbearing.  Nothing exciting to report on the dessert since it is the same dessert that every restaurant serves. ice cream, check, carrot cake, check, molten chocolate cake, check. same old same old. bottom line: if you are looking for a ""french"" restaurant that does not start with the word ""Le"", then I will recommend this place. It is safe.complains: Music: they played all possible music from the late 90s, early 2000 band. Goo Goo Dolls, Green Day, Cold Play, hot chili pepper, etc etc. The music was interrupted by commercials. WTF?? are you telling me that you guys are actually playing music from a radio station specialized in 90s pop/rock band? come on!!!  diversified, make it interesting, be creative, mix things up a little. Attention: As the reviewer before me, Sarah, said, too much attention is not a good thing. I intentionally ate slowly to have conversation with my girlfriend but the server/waiter came by at least 4 times to check whether they can ""withdraw"" my plate. Do you really think i will leave a small piece of bite size monkfish for you to ""withdraw"" my plate away?

It would be one thing if the restaurant was really busy, but there weren't that many tables seated.But like I said, the food was incredible - and beautifully presented. I had the tuna tartare and the cote de boeuf with chanterelle mushrooms (YUM).

BIG plusses - the complete and utter lack of music.  Made the whole experience calm and relaxing.  The huge table we had all to ourselves that felt like a private chef's table.  Very comfortable.  And the service was some of the best I've ever had.  So they get big points in some ways, and are lacking in others.  But they'll be around forever.  It really is lovely and gorgeous inside, especially the bar.  And who wouldn't love descending that plush spiral staircase....it's gorgeous.",0,0,1,anni b.,"Brooklyn, NY",195,353,1

I'm pretty sure that averages out to a 3 Star review, but I'm definitely no math whiz. The Good: - AWESOME bar food. The goat cheese croquettes with red spicy aoli were p-h-e-n-o-m-e-n-a-l. Yes, they were. I would have eaten millions of them, but obesity is a national disease epidemic, so I stopped myself. - The bar food, while listed on the menu with prices, was placed in front of us for FREE. Yes, free. I was just sitting there enjoying my cocktail and BAM! ""This is compliments of the Chef"" was ringing in my ear as a steaming hot plate of croquettes and mini croque monsieurs were placed in front of me. Oh Brasserie 8 1/2 how you spoil me! - The bartender listened to the type of drinks I like and made me a custom lychee cocktail, which was a version of their lychee gimlet with vodka instead of gin. Mama likey. - The decor is big and open, everything is comfortable including the overstuffed swiveling barstool/chair things. I could have sat there forever. The Mediocre: - The dinner menu is weird, it's not too extensive and nothing really stands out. - My mushroom goat cheese honey comb appetizer concoction was tasty, but seemed to not be executed quite right. I can't put my finger on it. - My striped bass entree was decent, again, nothing to write home about, I had to ask if it was cooked all the way through, and it was not my first time eating a white fish. I wish there had been a bit more substance to the plate, such as more greens or something along those lines. - Usually one dessert stands out on a dessert menu. I didn't have the interest to try one single thing. I'm not saying what I might have tried wouldn't taste good, but I wasn't even intrigued enough to try it out. The food is so mediocre I won't get dinner here again. I was beyond excited for the food especially after hoovering all the delectable bar treats, but the sit down meal was extremely lacking.

3.0,4/12/2010,"Quick breakdown: Went here recently for a birthday dinner.  6 people, each had apps and main course, a few sides, 1 bottle of wine, a few cocktails and coffee/dessert after dinner = ~$90 a head.The food was overpriced, but let's keep in mind that it's on 57 btw 5&6 and the audience... you expect it going in.  It was pretty empty for a saturday night, not sure if this is normal or maybe the heydey of this restaurant is over.Food was pretty good, I had the foie gras appetizer (a little cold in parts) but still flavorful and a good sized piece.  I had a bite of the crab cake and that was very well done with good chunks of crab in there.Had a ribeye steak and while it was good, it wasn't anything to write home about... a bit salty for my taste but others didn't seem to mind.The desserts were really good.  I had a vanilla ice cream w/ an orange yogurt blend and while it doesn't sound special... it actually was quite good, the cappucino was very well done as well.Overall, service was really great.  Our waitress was really knowledgable and came around to ask how we were doing once in awhile without being overbearing.  The manager also came by to talk to us a bit and wasn't too pushy or anything.Decorations were pretty nice, pretty quite on a saturday night.  Much larger space than I expected walking in.Overall, a pretty okay place, there are better places in the city, but if you live in the area (as I do) and want a nice place to impress a date or for a family gathering or birthday.. it's a nice spot that's quiet, trendy and chic.",1,0,0,Warren H.,"New York, NY",196,27,1
3.0,4/6/2010,"We stopped in with one of those $50 coupons that Patina offers for your birthday and were treated to a decent meal. It wasn't exactly a face-meltingly transformative experience. I'm also glad we didn't pay full price. A basket of bread in the one of every kind vein arrived at the table. Since I don't like to share my bread, just one kind of bread is sufficient. They roll the butter into a disk and leave the foil on. That's a pain in the posterior but, not a major strike. We were surprised with an amuse bouche (a winter squash soup in a shot glass). That was nice. We started with the Zucchini Blossom and the Goat Bolognese. Both we tasty and presentation was fairly creative. Dinner for us comprised of the Lemon Sole, Pan Seared Chicken and Short Ribs. All three were very good. Probably the Short Ribs (a special that evening) were the stand out. The desserts we had were fine. As far as the restaurant design, it's got lots of wide open spaces. The waitstaff is very friendly but perhaps a bit aggressive in their clearing of the tables.

1.0,3/24/2010,"Our wedding brunch was held at Brasserie 8 1/2.  The food was excellent but I cannot recommend this restaurant for other wedding parties.  We reserved a back room from 11-3, since we wanted our guests to have the opportunity to eat when it would be convenient for them, and the restaurant never voiced any objections to this arrangement when we booked it.  Most of the guests came early, and the restaurant was fine with the early guests.  But the restaurant was extremely rude to the guests who arrived at 1:30, since they apparently wanted to shut down our brunch room.  They tried to prevent the guests from sitting at our table, and when I insisted that we had rented the room until 3, they continued to insist that no additional guests were allowed.  I kept insisting that we had rented the room until three, and then they told me that they didn't have any way of keeping track of the number of guests and they didn't know who would pay for the late guests.  I told them that their inability to keep track of guests wasn't my responsibility, and that I would be happy to pay for the extra guests.  They spent several minutes making my guests and I feel quite unwelcome, and it was a very uncomfortable situation before they finally let the guests sit.  Later, when my guests went to the buffet in between courses the waiters cleared away their silverware immediately as a not-very-subtle hint that they wanted us to leave quickly, so they had to exit the wedding brunch and steal silverware from tables in the main dining room, which was set up for brunch for individual guests.    At some point they must have realized that I was the bride, and they apologized profusely and offered my guests champagne, and offered to waive the costs of the guests.  I was surprised when the credit card we had left as a deposit was charged for the late guests, and when we asked the manager about the charge, we were told that he was sorry but it was too late to refund the charges (which seemed very strange since it was the same month we had been billed) and offered to let us come to his restaurant for free.  Since the restaurant had upset me on the day after my wedding, I have no desire to return, and wanted other brides to be warned about this restaurant before booking events.  It's a shame since the food is so good, and it could easily have been a lovely event.",1,1,0,Jaclyn F.,"New York, NY",0,9,8

Glad my friends and I chose this! The interior is fancy shmancy. I still think about my appetizer from here more than half a year later! I had the pork belly slider. The entree was a lobster salad and the dessert I had was a blood orange cake.PORK BELLY SLIDER = sliced pork belly on toasted brioche with avocado, paprika mayonnaise, and a fried quail egg. Homemade potato chips on the side. This was melt-in-my-mouth delicious. Nothing was heavily seasoned on its own so no one flavor dominated. It just worked. It's so lame that I can't describe this experience any better but if I'm still thinking about it months later, you know it's good. I don't know if they offer it on their regular menu. This made my day. The potato chips were oversalted though. Meh.Entree was a lobster salad that had layers of chopped mango, avocado, baby pea leaves, and the lobster claw meat..! The 'sauce' was gelatinized mango. I was surprised to see so much lobster on one plate for a restaurant week meal! holy crap. It was very light and the mango lent a nice sweetness to the overall experience.Dessert was a blood orange cake. It was nothing special - it was actually the least favorite dish out of the three.

Although this certainly isn't my type of place, I have to admit the food tastes okay. There was the simple crabmeat salad on brioche toast which was not really all that interesting but ultimately effective as an appetizer. The lobster risotto was creamy, well-textured at al dente, and flavored in smile-inducing fashion. The grilled quail was rather pedestrian but satisfactorily flavored as to provide a pleasant bone sucking experience. Medallions of duck were overcooked but I enjoyed how it was paired with duck confit to create a pleasant contrasting duo. The crusted sea bass was cooked well and left moist with well-complementing sides (asparagus and mashed potatoes). And although I'm not big on sweets, I enjoyed my peach shortcake. It sounds like a lot of food, but we were served very small portions and 3 courses each (I shared some of the dishes with my friend). The dishes weren't on the regular menu, but from this tasting, it seemed like a place that regularly  produced pretty decent food.  However, when I looked at the regular menu, it seemed way overpriced.  In the end, I left feeling that this is just another ""I Wanna Be Trendy, Modern and Overpriced"" superficial New American / French joint.",1,0,0,andrew c.,"Brooklyn, NY",43,78,0
5.0,9/7/2009,"Towards the end of my New York visit, we got a recommendation to dine at Brasserie 8 1/2. We nearly walked right by because the outside did not look like the entrance to a swanky restaurant- it looked more or less like a hotel or posh office building. However, once inside, I felt like I was transported to an episode of ""The Jettsons""- very futuristic and modern with a circular platform surrounded by lights. Once we were seated and ordered, the waiter brought out complementary asparagus soup and gnocchi with melted ricotta cheese and tomatoes. The soup was excellent, but the real winner was the gnocchi. The pasta was light and the cheese was one of the best cheeses I have ever had (Our waiter said that the cheese came from a Brooklyn cheese company and just had a write-up in the New York Times for having unique and tasty cheeses). Then came our main courses- crab cakes, black Angus steak, and a chicken dish. The crab cakes were very savory but were a little rich and heavy. The steak was very moist and flavorful. The chicken was prepared like a country roast and was light and fresh. For dessert, we ordered the banana pudding and cupcake and eclair platter. For someone who is not a big fan of bananas, I thought that the pudding was very good and sweet. The cupcake and eclair platter was very good for a restaurant that does not specialize in sweets. I found myself eating a slice of the little chocolate cupcake with a small bite of an eclair. Just as we were about to pay and were reminiscing over our delightful dinner, the waiter brought out more complementary goodies- this time it was banana-filled chocolates.

The concept of the dish was lack luster even if the pork was perfectly cooked. I felt no inspiration out of that dish. It was a piece of pork with a fried hard boiled egg on a plate. My dessert, a cheesecake, was forgettable.However, the cosmo was smooth and delicious. I would come back for drinks, but not for the food. Nice, modern atmosphere without it feeling too stuffy.

3.0,3/30/2009,"Been here a few times for dinner, sampled the brunch spread for the first time yesterday.Food is neatly prepared and beautifully plated, but many menu items seem to be lacking a dimension of flavor.As far as entrees go, I'd recommend sticking to the fish, as the kitchen seems a bit meek when it comes to seasoning their meat and poultry.  The pancetta wrapped duck is a great example of this, cooked a bit too long and still lacking in salt content despite the ham.Dessert, in my opinion, is where Brasserie 8 1/2 shines.  My favorites among these are the miniature eclairs and the chocolate bento box.  Gimmicky, sure, but delicious nonetheless.Brunch here struck me as a value with a varied spread.  Sound hollandaise and delicately poached eggs benedict, though I was disappointed to find the eggs at the omelet bar pre-beaten (at heart I'm an over-easy kind of guy).  I thought the cold outshined the hot here, with well-sourced cold cuts and capers and a charming pasta salad prepared with tagliatelle.  The mimosas were pulpy and delicious, and prepared with a good proportion of bubbly, unlike the 5:1 fiascos that plague many Sunday morning spots.  At a reasonable 10USD, I ended up spending more on drinks than on brunch.Given my fondness for 8 1/2's desserts, imagine my delight to find the bar at brunch littered with trays of the stuff.  The miniature pastries maintain their integrity even at bite-size, my only gripes being the too-sweet ""tartlets"" made with different berry preserves and the bland strawberry cheesecake offering.I've found the service at 8 1/2 to be well-trained and personable.  I am impressed by the courtesy of the front of house here, my server yesterday patient even as my companion nursed her dessert plate well past three o'clock.I think the kitchen here embraces a philosophy eschewing many of the more savory and palate-heavy aspects of French cooking, favoring a more delicate New American approach with milder touches over flavors that linger.  Unfortunately, those dense tastes and rich sauces are precisely what I want when I crave French; further, the kitchen's light hand with seasonings cause even the lighter fare to suffer at times.Service is attentive without being overbearing; go for brunch or a snack with dessert.",0,0,0,Ben R.,"Brooklyn, NY",27,48,0
4.0,3/19/2009,"I came here with my coworkers for a celebratory event. Looking in through the window of the restaurant, you could already see the really cool decor and spiral staircase that lead down to the dining area. I ordered a passion fruit lemonade. No alcohol included, as my disappointed friend soon learned, but tasty and refreshing, nonetheless. Even the rolls were addictive. I had a semolina raisin and had to stop myself from eating another. Remember, I heart carbs.For appetizer, I ordered the beets with blood orange sauce and blue cheese stuffed croutons. The dish looked like a piece of art, almost too pretty to eat. Almost. It tasted as great as it looked. For entree, I had the salmon with white asparagus, peas and truffles. The salmon was good, but not the greatest I've had. Still, I love to eat and devoured pretty much all of it.Dessert was a tough choice, but I settled on the marscapone cheesecake with lemon meringue, black currents and oranges. The flavors were really intense and delicious and worked really well together. I also sampled some of my friend's sweet potato bread pudding, which was divine! As if all of that food wasn't enough, the waiter gave us complementary assortments of cookies and chocolate. Yummy. I wish i had more room to try them all, but I chose the chocolate covered orange peel. Overall, we had a really great experience. They were really accommodating to our large group, and the service was speedy.

I went with a party of 5 for restaurant week -being a vegetarian I specifically asked if they would be able to accommodate me when I made the reservation and they said they could (at the regular menu price not RW price of course, I am not unreasonable). But when I asked the waitress what I could have as a vegetarian, she literally laughed in my face.Her - ""You know this is a FRENCH restaurant, right.""Me- ""Yes, but I called earlier I was assured there was something for me OR ELSE I WOULD NOT HAVE COME to your (stupid) restaurant (because I am not a idiot).""Her - (Rolls her eyes) ""The chef will have to put something together.""

3.0,2/17/2009,"I am a big fan of brunch, and also a fan of buffets (therefore any buffet suggestions would be greatly appreciated) so when I discovered Brasserie 8 1/2's brunch-buffet combination on Sundays I was more than excited, and for $29 a person, you can't go wrong. Just a few tips before getting started: 1. You absolutely cannot order a la carte during their brunch buffet which was fine with me, however, one of the people with us had already eaten and wanted a small dish simply to accompany us and they could not accommodate that. 2. Their cappuccinos are really good, hot, lots of foam, but VERY expensive! 3. Make room for their desert, it is served at the bar. The food itself was well made, everything that should have been hot was hot, everything that should have been cold was cold. Their selection though not extensive was pretty varied. They served some brunch staples such as shrimp cocktail, smoked salmon/bagels and eggs/sausages/bacon as well as some unique items; salmon ceviche, polenta, and paella. The shrimp cocktail was very good, the sauce was really spicy. The polenta was probably my favorite dish. The ceviche was fresh and citrusy and served in a wine glass which made a really nice presentation. I also had a pasta salad that I thoroughly enjoyed, as well as their sausages and smoked salmon. My only complaint was that the bagels were not sliced in half, and it would have been difficult to open them without a serrated knife. The desert blew the regular food out of the water. The presentation was so cute, small portions, and really good. I loved the pumpkin cheesecake, the chocolate cannolis with pistachio and the berry tartlets. I would have tried the parfait though I was not sure I could withstand another ounce of food at that point. In all, a very good meal, nice atmosphere, attentive staff. I would have enjoyed more food options, but the ones they served were pretty good regardless.",3,0,1,Nicole C.,"New York, NY",124,299,3
5.0,2/9/2009,"Sunday brunch at Brasserie 8 1/2 is a great experience. It's a nicely done buffet with something for everyone in a swank setting.The brunch table(s) consist of many parts - There's a carving, omelet and crepe station, hot dishes (macaroni & cheese, polenta, potatoes, etc.), cold dishes (ceviche, salads, vegetables), all kinds of sweet breakfast foods (doughnuts, pastries, pancakes, breads) and a dessert bar that deserves its own menu. Everything was well-presented and fresh. Hot foods were appropriately hot, cold foods were appropriately cold... This was nice considering that you can have problems with that at other buffets.  We were promptly seated in the richly decorated dining room. Walk down the curving orange-carpeting staircase through a brightly lit rotunda and find mahogany bars, designer furniture from wall-to-wall, tasteful lighting and even nice tableware, all of which made for a great experience. The servers were actually friendly and attentive, making sure to refill coffee and water when needed. They also changed placed new flatware at each setting each time you went back to the buffet, which was a great point of service. Overall, the space is bright and cheerful which is nice during brunch time. The atmosphere is pretty casual for this type of place and it wasn't so stuffy that I felt like I was underdressed wearing jeans. Overall, I think this may be one of the best brunch experiences I've ever had in New York, or ever. The most attractive part to me is that this is a relative bargain at $29/person, and considering all you get, and the atmosphere and location, I think it's well worth it.

OK.I guess after having a bad experience the night before at an underground food club event for $150, $28.50 for 8+ course tasting seemed like nirvana.  I guess if I wasn't so distracted by the the good company and witty conversations I would've probably ended up giving only 2.5 stars.Service was good and attentive.Beautiful decor!  Love it.Verdict:  A-OK!  In the end, it didn't offend, price was reasonable, food was OK, although not memorable.  Company was wonderful.  I don't think I would be back as there wasn't anything compelling to pique my interest.",2,0,2,Billy C.,"Bayonne, NJ",242,242,49
2.0,11/16/2008,"This is a great looking restaurant. A huge space down a spiral staircase. The decor is refreshing and there was a large bar with a circle of couches just below the stairs.But the food was awful. It could possibly be the worst I have ever tasted at a restaurant. I had lowered my expectations because we were going for the 8-1/2 course for $28.50. Even so some of the dishes were inedible and the service was a (kitchen) nightmare.""Where did they get this bread? The bread museum?"" - SopranosBread was hard to swallow (pun intended) and even the warm pumpernickel was tough. I would not be surprised if it had been nuked in a microwave just before service.Capers must of been on sale because it was included in almost every dish. The only decent course was the skate and even that was colder than should be.The most awful thing I tasted was a ""Short Rib Pot-au-Feu, Cabbage, Fleur de Sel"". This absolutely tasteless dish was beyond bad. I don't think I could make something this bad even if I tried. It tasted like they found the cheapest meat and drop it in a huge pot of water and boiled it for 20 minutes until it was cooked. The meat gave no flavor to the broth and it was tough as leather. It was totally disgusting.Such a shame to waste this space with horrible food. On a Sunday evening the restaurant was less than half full and the staff looked totally miserable. Funniest part of the night was when one of our party arrived late and ordered the tasting menu while we were on our 2nd course (The tasting menu consisted of 9 plates in 4 courses).

2.0,8/14/2008,"Studying the names of the Patina Restaurant Group of which Brasserie 8 1/2 is a part of, I felt a bit skeptical. Sea Grill, Rock Center Cafe, and Pentimento at LACMA are all restaurants that I recognized as being tourists haunts that provide for the wealthy visitors an overpriced experience of so called haute cuisine in a trendy modern setting. But despite this prejudice, I agreed to meet a friend at Brasserie 8 1/2 in Midtown for dinner. After all, it would not only be rude to my friend, it would also be unfair to judge the restaurant without having been there.Located near both Hammer Galleries and the Museum of Modern Art, Brasserie 8 1/2 obviously channels modern art for its visual inspiration. Giving credit where it's due, I think Brasserie 8 1/2 is exceptionally well designed for it's purpose; the balanced play of glitz and art creates a trendy upscale environment greatly appreciated by the patrons, the bulk of whom I'd describe as being Midtown Zagat Guide New Yorkers.When you first enter through the round glass doors at the front, you're immediately met with an empty circular room that contains nothing but the plush red carpet and the smartly dressed host. After confirming reservations, you're directed to go down the curved stairs that lead to the lounge. Because both the reception area and the bar are round, the restaurant takes on a rather interesting structure in which the main dining room spreads out from the a rotunda, visually manifesting the number 8 1/2 itself. While the lounge has a 1960s airport lounge feel to it, the main dining room is of a sleek contemporary design with Picasso and Matisse inspired artworks.But unfortunately, Brasserie 8 1/2 was nowhere as nearly as impressive in its culinary efforts and the service was abysmal. A little after ordering, we were given a basket of bread and some butter. The butter was a partially (but obviously not intentionally) wrapped half a stick of butter. Had I known that this would be an omen for the rest of the mediocre dining experience, I would have found it less amusing, but at that moment, the awkward half nude butter seemed a bit funny. While the roll was a bit hard and stale on the outside, it wasn't unlike many other restaurants.I had ordered the marinated grill quail for an appetizer while my friend got the white gazpacho. Although I did find the fig-cocoa vinaigrette bland, my complaint with our appetizers had mostly to do with the incompetent service. While my quail was delicious (perfectly cooked; the meat fell off the skinny bones with ease), it arrived at the table slightly cooled. My friend's gazpacho (light, refreshing, and delicate) came without a spoon. It took quite a while to flag down a server (the restaurant seemed understaffed and poorly prepared for the heavy traffic). And throughout the night, my friend and I found ourselves too busy trying to get our waiter's attention to enjoy the meal.For the entree,I had the duck steak and leg confit as duck tends to be one of my favorite things to order. But Brasserie 8 1/2 committed another blunder. Both my and my friend's entree (the lobster risotto)  came out before we had finished our appetizers. One of the busboys tried to take away our dishes, when there was at least half of it still left, and as we were requesting more time, the server came with our entrees. He looked a bit confused and marched back to the kitchen. Both of us cringed. Because neither of us are slow eaters, we didn't like the idea that our food would just be reheated when it wasn't because of something we did. And perhaps because of the earlier gaffe and the expectation of the worst, but the entree was absolutely disappointing. The duck steak was undercooked and had a pulpy texture. The duck confit was a bit too salty, wasn't fatty enough (yes, I'm actually complaining about this), and wasn't crispy at all. As for my friend's risotto, it was okay, with the light tomato sauce complimenting the lobster well.As for desserts, I got the rich chocolate cake and my friend got the peach parfait. Seeing as how the rest of the dinner panned out, I ordered and got a very safe option. It was a slab of moist rich chocolate cake with the obligatory decorative touches that was good but not too different from chocolate cakes from any other restaurant or bakery. It came in an old school milk shake cup and alternated between scoops of cherry gelato, white chocolate mousse, peaches, and crispy waiffers.Overall, I was very much disappointed by the dining experience at Brasserie 8 1/2. While I was very much impressed with the layout of the restaurant, the mediocre food and the shoddy service made it a very underwhelming experience. Go if you have enough money to burn and want to impress a date with a trendy Midtown restaurant, but I cannot vouch for the food. After all, you know the food is bad when your friend apologizes during dinner for having suggested the restaurant.",6,5,6,Sienna K.,"Philadelphia, PA",104,153,21

The bloody mary i ordered was almost like watered down tomato juice spiked with bad liquor. However what was really impressive was the 50 foot bar lined up with a variety of scrumptious delicious deserts.Wouldn't probably go here again, because the $30 brunch wasn't really all that impressive.",2,0,1,Ricky P.,"Newport Beach, CA",8,3,0

The bar and lounge area were pretty cool and looked very relaxing, but again -had that feeling that everyone was waiting for their meetings or appointments cause it all just felt so ""lobby-ish"". We were seated in one of the booths which was great and proceeded to order from the restaurant week menu which was pretty cool.

Whether you're looking for a place for two, a table for 10, or an (after) party for 100 people, this place really delivers.  Despite the dining room's underground location, it's very bright and airy. It's the kind of place you want to sit in and chat for a few hours. The $27 all you can eat brunch ($14 for kids under 12) is perfect. They have everything you can imagine -- eggs, made-to-order omelets, french toast, pancakes, donuts, fruit salad, smoked salmon, bagels, shrimp cocktails, various breakfast meat, etc. And it's easy accidentally to miss the giant dessert bar with cakes and pastries if you don't take a few minutes to survey the place before filling up your plate. I suspect their profit margin comes from the drink orders -- they tend not to mention that juices and coffees are an extra $5 per glass/cup, and that leads one to think the all-you-can-consume rule applies to beverages, so watch out for an unpleasant surprise when the bill arrives.

The cauliflower flan was tasteless. The bread basket was full of really crusty rolls that were hard to eat. The service was snooty. I didn't like how after each course was taken away the waitress came back and practically tossed new silverware on our table, instead of neatly placing them where they should go. I think the only good dish was something that wasn't part of the menu but was compliments of the chef, it was a scallop ceviche with jalapeno and some other thing on it.I'm also not sure if it was because we made our reservations on OpenTable.com or because we weren't dressed in suits, but we got a crappy table that was in the middle of a waiter traffic lane (I even accidentally elbowed one in the crotch as he passed by).
