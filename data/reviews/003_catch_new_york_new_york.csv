2.0,4/14/2019,"Unfortunately, we spent two hours waiting for our food. They sent our food to the wrong floor and never followed up with our table. When the check came around, nothing was taken off the bill nor were they apologetic about making us wait for an extremely bizarre amount of time of two hours. The least they could have done was taken off the $14 iced teas off the bill.",0,0,0,Erin D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",4,14,23

5.0,3/10/2019,"My daughters and I had a fabulous meal at Catch!  It has a very lively ambience, and was crowded when we arrived.  We were promptly led to our table, and our waiter was courteous, answered our questions, and was very professional.  We had the lobster roll, crispy shrimp and scallops gnocchi- all delicious, and finished our meal with their signature ""hit me"" cake.   It was on the pricey side, but for a special meal out, well worth the price.  We will be back!",0,0,0,Sue C.,"New Haven, CT",1,16,12
4.0,2/27/2019,"I went ate at their restaurant. Lovely food. Absolutely lovely food. Disclaimer: this is a pricey restaurant. I had sushi and ice cream (split the bill with a friend) and we paid around $40 each. It's a magnificent experience, though. The waiters are hands-on and the food is made pristinely. There are notable people who eat here and it was packed when I went, I would recommend reserving beforehand otherwise you will wait around for ages like we did. It's not a terrible thing, waiting, though it's never preferable. Eventually when we got to sit down and eat we truly had a spectacular experience and it was a night to remember. It's a very cozy restaurant with extremely low lighting, so the intimacy is definitely something to note about it. Great location too.",0,0,0,Siya Prototype C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,17,0

1.0,1/1/2019,"this place is extremely overrated. I paid $9 for a fiji water, which the waiter failed to mention costed anything. The sushi was pretty mediocre, and a plate of child sized pasta with scattered mushrooms costed $30. The hit me cake was again average, and a child sized portion. Didn't see the hype for the price at all.",0,0,0,Molly K.,"Ocean City, NJ",0,4,0
5.0,12/21/2018,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. It still has its cool factor even after being in business for over 6 years. (That's a long time in nyc) I have had both brunch and dinner here a couple of times. I have also just gone to the restaurant bar for drinks. I consider myself a margarita connoisseur  because it's the only thing I drink no matter where I go and they honestly have the best jalapeno margarita that I have ever had anywhere. It's $23 but worth it.  The food is pretty good too. The only con is that I am allergic to shellfish so I cannot eat a lot of things on the menu. But it is a seafood restaurant so I can't knock them on that. But their non seafood items are pretty good.I have not been to the club on the 3rd floor recently but I did years back when I was more of a club kid and knew doormen and GM, but I wouldn't mind checking it out again without the hassle.",0,0,0,Wayne H.,"New York, NY",25,4,4
5.0,12/18/2018,"Love this place! One of my favorite places in the city to get sea food. Perfect for a date and there are plenty of bars in the meatpacking area to grab a casual drink before your meal. The seafood at Catch is so fresh and is cooked extremely well. I recommend the sushi for an appetizer and the salmon as a main entree. Also, these dishes can easily be shared!!

The downside was that our reservation was at 9 we did not get seated right away, after have actually been seated we understood why everyone wanted to stay.

3.0,11/25/2018,"The ambiance was super cute and they seated us without our whole party being present, which was appreciated. The drinks were about $20 each and the food was delicious, but the portions are tiny for the price. I got the crunchy shrimp which was a decent portion and tasted great .

Our server, beautiful lady, so professional but yet so friendly to kindly take pictures for us. The food was delicious. I had the catch roll and crispy shrimp.

5.0,10/22/2018,"This is my FAVORITE place in NYC. If you're going to splurge on dinner and drinks, this is the place you need to do it. There were so many items and the portions are large enough to be shared. Every single item that I ordered was perfect and delicious. The vegetarian options I tried were the crispy brussel sprouts, the spaghetti squash, the truffle fries, and the mushroom pasta. The drinks were also great, and the ambiance of the place was really cool. They had a bar upstairs too which was so much fun - a bit crowded though so we didn't stay long but it was a good start to the evening. Catch gets a 10/10 from me. I definitely will be back!!",1,0,0,Tanya M.,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",8,45,35

1.0,9/12/2018,This place is awful. Their service is horrible. Food is atrocious. And on top of that they are extremely racist and homophobic!

1.0,7/24/2018,Worst experience. I've been here for brunch which was okay. I came here for drinks on Saturday night for my friends birthday. They were charging me 18.50 tax included on drinks and then all of a sudden started charging me 22 for the same drink. I asked what the deal was. They told me I was wrong and threatened to kick me out. Talk about customer service. Honestly disgusting. I'll spend my money somewhere else.,5,0,0,Mimi F.,"Bedford, NY",236,35,14

3.0,3/9/2018,"TLDR: food quality really varies dish to dishBeen to catch several times now. Twice at night to the club, once for dinner and now once for brunch.Club - Enjoyed the clubbing experience. Despite being concerned about how small it was (being used to big clubs like marquee), it was actually really fun. But definitely think you need a table since it's super crowded and people keep walking around. The crowd is pretty unique, models and bottles kind of vibe, and without all the creepy people... just friends trying to have fun.Food - arg some dishes are so good (e.g. Lobster macaroni), but others are just rly bad.... got the famous seafood tower which was very pricey, but a lot of the ceviche tasted fishy and not fresh... the lobster and oysters were okay. For brunch, the famous waffle tower was gluten free and just kept crumbling and falling apart... didn't taste so good.",1,0,1,Vicky D.,"New York, NY",573,24,39

1.0,12/31/2017,F*CK this restaurant. I put in weeks ago a reservation online and for my sisters birthday and I call today to make sure and they tell me that online is only a request.

1.0,11/28/2017,"Was very Disappointed!!! Have been here numerous times for dinner. Decided to try lunch .. what a huge mistake.. for starters it's upstairs in the rooftop inside .. Thankfully it was inside because running around outside was a mouse . Service was horrible, took 15 mins for someone to come over .. we got our apps and still waited for our cocktails.. cocktails were ALL ice .. for 18.00 that is a shame .. we never got our truffle fries until we were done . No one even bothered to check on us to see if we needed anything or wanted another drink .. the food was delicious . But the service and the mouse that no one even bothered to do anything about was a real turn off for such a HIGH end establishment.. very disappointedAlso which was totally ridiculous there were not bags for us to carry our leftovers..",2,0,0,Ran B.,"Morganville, NJ",0,108,3

3.0,11/6/2017,Food was un real. We had a 8PM reservation and did not get seated until 10:30PM. Hence the 3 stars. The restaurant is extremely loud. I don't usually mind but it's to the point where you can't hear the person across from you speaking.,0,0,0,Alina J.,"East Norwich, NY",8,17,1
1.0,8/21/2017,"Horrible experience for the 2nd time. First time was a brunch visit, food is good, but customer service was horrible. Long wait, then had to get up an go to the bar myself to get salt/pepper/condiments for my food after asking multiple employees including our waiter. Today, waited 50 minutes and they never brought our order out. The LARGE party seated next to us showed up 20 minutes after us and had a table full of food. When the staff finally took notice, they tried to bring us a sashimi that had been sitting on the other groups table for a long time because it had been placed there inadvertently. The rest of our food was nowhere to be found. We told them we would be leaving and they didn't charge us for the one drink we ordered, but management did not come out and apologize or offer any feedback. I will not visit Catch ever again, too many other great options in the area. -Chris",0,0,0,Chris G.,"Houston, TX",0,1,0

Go to bathroom when you first get there. navigating through the crowd I hit a man in the back of head and felt really bad.

2.0,6/20/2016,"It's a shame that a restaurant like this with pretty decent food has a very incompetent management team. Me and my friends were there celebrating a birthday and wanted to grab drinks at the rooftop after our dinner. Our waiter told us we can get stamped at the restaurant and then head to the rooftop. Once the manager came over, he gave us several different options: (1) buying a table - when it was just us three girls. (2) leave because he needed the table (even though the restaurant was drying down) where we would then buy drinks at their bar which we had already waited half hour at before getting our table. He then said he would be right back, meanwhile we see him staring at our table with other coworkers making it very awkward! Finally, because the management left such a bad taste in our mouths even though the food was on point, we decided to get the check and get out of there. If the management were intelligent, then they would have had a five star rating, but unfortunately for them....I come here often. Guess not anymore!",2,0,0,Nicole Z.,"Roslyn, NY",45,19,3
