4.0,4/30/2019,"Beautiful. I think that's the word to encompass my experience here for afternoon tea. I do a yearly high/afternoon tea with a mixed group of friends-- both older and younger women, and this year it was someone else's turn to choose. She chose the Whitby-- and what an elegant choice. Reservations were made ahead of time for the Orangery room for 7, and though we weren't guaranteed it, upon arrival the maitre'd Leo was incredibly gracious as to create a table for us. Yeong/Yung was our waitress and we ADORED her. She was so attentive, in fact they all were, but she made us feel right at home and I can't thank her enough. Pictures to follow. Tea and Food: We all ordered from the set afternoon tea menu that included scones, cucumber, egg salad, and ham/horseradish sandwiches. They also included thousand layer pastries, mini carrot cakes, mini key lime cakes and strawberry tarts. The scones were deadly-- we were almost fighting for for them at the end: delicious paired with clotted cream and apricot jam. The egg salad was sublime; the ham sandwich passable; and we all stayed away from the cucumber sandwich. One member of our group tried it and declared it unappetizing, hence the full star demotion-- though that's a combination of the cucumber and key lime cake tastes. The TEA! There was the standard English breakfast tea, but 6/7 chose from the rare tea side. I got the Musgrave Darjeeling-- the Darjeeling lover in me was so content: flavorful and not overpowering. The others got the Silver Needle Jasmine, Peppermint, and Hibiscus. Everyone approved. Oh! And for the alcoholic in me-- I kid by the way-- I got a glass of Veuve Clicquot champagne: floral, light, crisp-- as one would expect from Veuve. I will be back and that is all. As always, happy eating and drinking. MarieMG",0,0,0,Marie-Madeleine G.,"Brooklyn, NY",41,85,201

3.0,3/12/2019,"Bedecked in tapestry-upholstered, cottage-chic furniture, the Orangery at the Whitby evokes an English garden in the middle of bustling Manhattan.  We recommend afternoon tea here, rather than at the more rowdy, adjacent bar area which overlooks the street.On our visit, afternoon tea was served in the traditional three-tier manner, on very pretty sets of fine English Wedgwood porcelain.  There were two types of black teas that were included in the prix fixe price - English Breakfast and Earl Grey.  Other teas were available at a surcharge, a most unfortunate practice that these Dessert Correspondents have not come across before in any of our high tea adventures around the world.  From this supplementary tea menu, we selected the ""Mythical Creatures"" tea (a blend of oolong, sunflower blossoms, and green mango) and the ""Jasmine Silver Tip"" (a white tea variety).  Savouries and sweet irresistibles numbered four bites a piece.  The sandwich set included a turkey ribbon sandwich layered with cranberry, and classical sandwiches of egg salad, cool cucumber, and smoked salmon, respectively.  The scones were crumbly nuggets (we prefer the more fluffy variety), and they were most unfortunately, served cold.  Following a garden theme, the sweets consisted of a  rather dry vanilla cupcake embellished with a buttercream dahlia, a rose-flavoured choux puff (our favourite nibble), a chocolate mousse tart decorated with sugar fondant flowers and marshmallow bites, and a brittle pistachio macaron.If one could overlook the tea surcharge, the glacial service, and the just-average food offerings, the Whitby could be a preposition for teatime in a trendy yet intimate, garden-like setting away from bustling Midtown  Manhattan.",1,1,0,Dessert Correspondents O.,"New York, NY",10,112,0
5.0,3/12/2019,"We stopped by last night (Monday) and it was my first time here. The bar area is large and they took a reservation for our party of 10 to get drinks and have a place to sit. The place wasn't busy at all, but it was also a Monday, so I'm sure that changes as it gets closer to the weekend. Everyone at my company was happy with how comfortable the chairs and sofa were and the level of service we got. I would definately recommend for work drinks or perhaps a date night.",0,0,1,Mary M.,"Greenwood Lake, NY",176,185,20
3.0,3/2/2019,We had a lovely afternoon tea. However there is a loud childrens birthday party sitting behind us and my friends and I can't hear each other. The children should have been in a private room or no one should have been seated next to them. This really ruined our afternoon  tea experience.

5.0,2/18/2019,"I came here for afternoon tea for my birthday, and it was everything we could have asked for! The staff was friendly and accommodating. The restaurant was so cute and classy, and the vibe was very relaxing and calm, no one was rushed out like some of the other tea spots in the area with packed reservations. Once they found out it was my birthday, the waitress brought over a cupcake with a candle - so sweet! The food was good as well, especially the scones, and there was a unique and wide tea selection.

2.0,2/4/2019,"Great for Instagram, but not for a meal. Nice design and decor but very disappointing food. To start off, the bread they served was severely undercooked, effectively raw in center. Scallop crudo appetizer was very unbalanced - very excessive use of truffle oil (I like truffles) and high acidity rendered the scallop almost irrelevant. For mains, we had the lobster risotto and the halibut. The risotto was undercooked (not ""al dente"") and relatively bland and the lobster was very chewy and not flavorful. The halibut was served over cooked blueberries and topped with mushrooms, but the dish was not integrated. The fish itself was very dry and nothing and the components were not complimentary.For dessert, we had three sorbets, a cheese platter and a glass of sauternes. The sorbet and cheese were tasty but unmemorable. The sauternes was served in inappropriate glassware and had a tremendous amount tartrate crystals in the glass (like they served the dregs of a bottle).Nothing was inedible, but neither was it well made. You could have a much better meal for 25% of the price in Manhattan.",1,0,0,Matt S.,"New York, NY",0,8,0
2.0,1/31/2019,"This is my second time visiting the Whitby, the first time I just had drinks at the bar and everything was wonderful (could not understand why this place had such a low rating) the second time I actually had dinner here and completely understood why people do not like this place.The food is good (nothing to write home about) the service is awful! We arrived at the Whitby and were told that we would be seated in 10 minuets and that a table was just about to be available, 30 minutes later we were still waiting on a table, I should have got up and left then.After the 30 minute wait we were seated and asked if we would like to place a drink order, my husband and I ordered two cocktails which took about 15 minutes to arrive. Finally we placed our food order - I had the veggie burger and my husband had the regular burger, both dishes were good, however, just like everything else it took way to long to receive the food and when I asked for a side of mustard I was looked at like I was crazy (waited over 15 minutes for the mustard to arrive)The only thing great about this place is the live jazz music, luckily this is somewhat of a distraction from the bad service.I would not recommend the Whitby to my worst enemy.

5.0,1/10/2019,"The Whitby Hotel's restaurant is an incredible place for afternoon tea. The decor and space is everything that you could possibly want for a nice Sunday afternoon. There are plenty of booths, round tables with plush chairs in fun patterns, and China plates displayed on the walls. The restaurant is huge and can easily seat large parties. There are really two areas- a main dining room/bar section that is ideal for dinner, and then a back area that is bright, and great for afternoon tea.They offer 2 types of afternoon tea- the regular Whitby one, and then a healthier option. We went for the regular one, and I thought it was overall great! There were 4 different sandwiches- the classics such as smoked salmon, and egg salad, then scones with butter and jam, and a variety of desserts. The presentation was beautiful and very well detailed. I thought the sandwiches were delicious (except for the cucumber and butter one- I'm not sure who would actually love that,) and the scones were really soft and delightful. I will say that the desserts on top weren't to die for- the mini pecan pies had a disturbing fluorescent green frosting on them, and the cannoli was chocolate and peppermint flavored which I didn't care for. But the cranberry upside down cake and little gingerbread cookies were great.Overall, I would highly recommend the Whitby! It was very affordable for afternoon tea- $45 per person with an extra $3 charge for certain teas. I do have doubts about their regular lunch and dinner menu, but I would definitely return for afternoon tea!",0,0,1,Audrey T.,"New York, NY",4,219,4

This place is the definition of classy in terms of decor, but food did not meet our  expectations. We went with the healthy afternoon tea option that is gluten-free and vegan. We wanted to give it a shot. The sandwichs were okay, bit did not like the dessert options.  The scones we're not great either  -could have been better.

5.0,12/23/2018,"Afternoon tea with my family for the holidays was a wonderful experience.  The hotel and bar have a cozy, yet sophisticated vibe.  The bar manages to pull off the near impossible in Manhattan -- it is both lively yet completely warm and manageable.  The hostess went out of her way to make sure our experience was what we hoped for.  I was early and was asked to wait at the bar, where my sparkling water was comped -- (I did not want to drink before a family afternoon tea).  The tea service was superb.  Tasty sandwiches, pastries, and a complete selection of teas.  There was also a 'healthy' choice on the menu.  I had never heard of The Whitby before this booking, but was more than pleasantly surprised by everything about it -- vibe, food, service, et al.",0,0,0,Larry B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,17,0

4.0,12/15/2018,"Beautiful setting, delightful service, and honestly everything I could ask for out of a high tea and more! Although my bf and I were unable to be seated in the ""tea parlor"" due to a private event, we could see how cute it was and that (almost) was able to do the job! The high tea was pretty affordable pricing for high teas in the city - their earl grey is lovely. My little tower of afternoon tea treats was so varied and everything was so good! I really liked the smoked salmon tea sandwiches that they had in particular. So many desserts too.. Bang for your buck is definitely worth it, for the high tea. My friend got the acai bowl which was delicious (anyone else avocado in acai bowls?? Me neither) but really small and not filling. Overall, would definitely come here only for the high tea and not the food, although would be open to trying their savory brunch and lunch foods another time.",0,0,0,Carol L.,"New York, NY",769,437,1507

2.0,11/6/2018,"I was really excited when one of my friends told me The Whitby offered a vegan afternoon tea. Most places don't even offer a vegetarian tea set much less a vegan & gluten free one. We made reservations for 2 pm on a Saturday and arrived at 1:54pm. We checked in with the hostess and was told to wait at the bar so she could see if our table was ready. We didn't want to sit at the bar and take up 3 seats for potential customers so we stood close to the bar area. We waited for a long time, and it got really awkward b/c there were about 3 tables around the bar that were occupied and I found the diners looking annoyed at us as if we were imposing on their dining experience. I was looking around for the missing hostess and the manager came and asked if he could assist me. I explained to him we had reservations at 2pm and the hostess said she was going to check if our table was ready and she never came back. The manager said he would check right away. After about 15 minutes, I see the hostess re-emerge from the back, as she is walking towards us she seems to have forgotten who we were. I had to approach her and the first words out of her mouth was ""did you check in yet?"" WTF?! I told her I checked in with YOU about 15 minutes ago and you said you would check to see if my table was ready and she replied with ""oh yeah"". At that same moment the manager came and said our table was ready and took us to the back. I don't understand what the hostess was checking bc there were only 3 occupied tables in the back, and the table next to mine was a small bridal shower or something and only 3 girls were there. We ordered 2 vegan tea sets and 1 regular. We all decided to order a premium tea, which was $3 additional. I ordered their signature tea, mythical creatures, and although the tea was pleasant, it was just too light. It tasted like the tea leaves weren't steeped long enough but that wasn't the case since the loose tea leaves were in the pot. The vegan scone was hard as a rock. They came with a jam and a cashew cream. They could have made a vegan clotted cream out of coconut cream if they were innovative. Next I tried one of the finger sandwiches and it was disgusting. The sandwich was so bland and mushy. The top tier was all sweets and at that point I did not have high hopes. I tried the tofu panna cotta and that was actually decent but not good. I asked my friend if her regular tea set was any better and saw her plate was full of half eaten food. My vegan friend said she did not like anything from the tea set. We were so hungry that we actually ordered food from Beyond Sushi up the block. We had the time to download the app and place a $60 order from Beyond Sushi and still sit for another 10 minutes before a female (not sure if she's a mgr or Captain) came and asked if we were done. I really am against wasting food, so I asked to pack the rest of my tea set to go. My friend also packed some of her leftovers. After another 15 min, the same woman comes back with one bag. She then asks if we wanted it to be packed separately. Very strange. She never came back with another bag and we had to ask the bus boy. Waiting to pay was another long ordeal. Our original server never came back to our table after we were served so I had to flag down the same woman even though she was talking on her cell phone. My original tea cup was also dirty and missing a teaspoon, the busboy replaced the cup but no teaspoon. The male manager, who use to work at The Crosby, was very nice so he deserves a star and I liked the kitschy decor so another star for that. The restroom situation was also a disaster. There were only 2 single use restrooms and every time I attempted to go, there was a line of 5 people or more. And each person would be inside for an abnormally long time.",2,0,0,Cynthia Y.,"Franklin Square, NY",67,96,362

All the baked goods were too sweet and did not taste freshly made except for perhaps the scones. Sandwiches were ok.

4.0,9/14/2018,"This place just oozes classiness. I felt so relaxed and comfortable in this restaurant that I need to find another occasion to go here again. I love that they have afternoon tea but I opted to try out their lunch menu options. Although they were participating in restaurant week we ordered off their regular menu.I chose the Brussels Sprout Ceasar Salad with crispy Ciabatta and chicken. Our waiter said it was a wholesome salad and very filling, she was right. I loved the flavor and the texture.For side dishes we shared the House Made French Fries and Truffle Mac and Cheese. The mac and cheese was a hit but the house made French fries were long, skinny, too hard when I bit them, and tasted overdone. I wouldn't order these again. To finish off the experience I had the Peppermint infused tea. The wait staff also brought out an Orange French macaroon with orange ganache which was delicious.What really made me fall in love with this place is it's elegance. It didn't even bother me that their was mild construction going on outside. Everything was just beautiful and tastefully done.",7,3,10,Sheri S.,"Minneapolis, MN",578,580,1880

However, after my latest visit here, I just felt that I needed to review the place. Came in for high tea with a few of my coworkers and we were quite disappointed. The cucumber sandwich was literally white bread and a thin slice of cucumber. The desserts were certainly prepackaged. And there were flies buzzing around every where.

3.0,8/25/2018,"My mother and I went for afternoon tea. She was visiting from out of town and we were really looking forward to this. The setting is lovely, and the china is adorable. We got the regular tea service, which included two scones each with jams and clotted cream that were a perfect size and super delicious. The savory plate came with a quarter sandwich each of cucumber, smoked salmon, buffalo chicken and something else that was indistinguishable, but I later found was beet hummus. One of my main quibbles here was not only was the bread a little dry, there was so little filling on these sandwiches that you could barely discern any filling at all. In fact, one of the buffalo sandwiches contained only the faintest smear of orange, no chicken at all. The Whitby even seemed to cheat on the amount of cucumbers, which were so thin as to be see-through. That was our first disappointment. We also had to wait quite a while to get anyone's attention to bring us some additional hot water for tea. When the rather large carafe of hot water was brought to the table, rather than take a couple of seconds to refill our pots, the server just plopped it there, forcing us to lean over and strain to pour the heavy pot without burning ourselves or each other. The deserts were OK, though tasted as though they'd been refrigerated for a while. But we were full by then and barely touched them. Lastly, though it wasn't entirely the hotel's fault, a screaming child really ruined the mood during a significant portion of our tea. We weren't the only customers who complained that staff should have urged the parent to remove their child until he/she calmed down so others could enjoy their meal.",1,0,0,Beck B.,"New York, NY",2,91,7

4.0,8/7/2018,"Came for restaurant week lunch. I had called to make a reservation for a group of 10 and they assured me they were doing restaurant week (had to cancel a reservation at Nobu downtown because they were only doing restaurant week in the bar/lounge not main dining room). When we were seated we were not given restaurant week menus and when we asked for it, they said they don't do restaurant week for parties larger than 7. After speaking with the manager and telling them I called to check, we were given restaurant week menus and were told they were making an exception this one time.The food was good, but not great. Some dishes were good, others not so much. The bread they brought out was delicious. For appetizers, the gazpacho was likened to melted strawberry sorbet, the caponata did not resemble caponata at all (grilled veggies with ricotta and thin pieces of crunchy lavash which I have only ever had as light and fluffy bread). The best appetizer was the salmon tartare. For entrees, the gnocchi were mediocre, the grouper was good, nicely cooked and I surprisingly liked the grilled lettuce, but the pork shank was the best. Well seasoned with delicious polenta. Had I ordered the salmon then pork I would have been much more impressed with the food. I wouldn't go back for the food, but we all enjoyed the meal.

4.0,5/25/2018,"I was overjoyed to hear they offered a gluten free high tea! Don't be snooty that it's labeled as a ""healthy tea"" like I was! I don't mind a little calories when indulging in a high tea and almost feel like it would be missing something, but I was wrong!The first thing is the setting, and it was gorgeous. The room is bright and airy, with a pretty swanky setting. The china is funky and fun and the service was very friendly. I initially tried their Darjeeling blend, but it was way too light for me and switched to the Earl Grey. Thankfully, like I said, the server was kind enough to do that for me. The first tier sandwiches were the roasted red pepper mousse, cucumber bite, vegan tuna sandwich, coconut and chickpea, caprese, tomato, basil, soy sauce tofu, focaccia and the baked sweet potato, tomato salsa, edamame. The best by far was the tuna sandwich. The bread alone was phenomenal and the ingredients inside the sandwich were tasty. Weakest was probably the caprese. Tomatoes just aren't in season and I really didn't taste the sauce. I was most excited about the carrot cake sticky bun. It just didn't have that carrot cake taste to it and I was disappointed.  The granola was okay, but kind of boring. The warm banana cake was the best. It was sweet, fluffy and delicious. So was the almond crunch cake. The scones were by far the worst part of the entire meal. They were terrible. Me and my friend both thought we were having some sort of allergic reaction because it made our whole mouth feel like we had eaten dust. It was inedible. It's sad because the scone is my favorite part usually and the jam and clotted cream were really good. But even slathering on a bunch of those couldn't save it. They need a new recipe, STAT. Again, thankful they offer a GF option and was mainly happy with my tea. Change the scone recipe and I'll be glad to come back!",5,0,6,Rachel C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",3091,1226,2063

1.0,4/26/2018,"We a group of five people had been meeting every week for lunch and evening tea at the Whitby restaurant for almost six months with prior reservation. All of a sudden the manager Tess began showing unwelcoming behavior by directing her staff to act indifferent. This became constant. On one occasion the outrageous behavior of one of the server's we brought to her notice.  She heard with utter disregard.On the outside, she continued to sham a welcoming behavior. Recently she was personally at her rude best with us. We were reading the menus to order dinner when she walked up to us and said ""You will have to leave in 15mins as we are busy. I am sending the bill"". Her behavior clearly showed it was preplanned as just a little before she came to our table and welcomed us to keep on coming.  How busy the restaurant was can be seen from this picture.",1,0,0,Sum B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,1
2.0,4/21/2018,"I was thoroughly disappointed by this afternoon tea experience.

5.0,2/3/2018,"The Whitby Bar is such a pretty and lovely addition to the bar/restaurant scene in Midtown! While the area is filled with fast-casual and upscale restaurants, the Whitby Bar fits in the fancy-but-not-overboard criteria. I chose this restaurant to catch up with a dear friend of mine and it was the perfect space to do that - slightly dimmed lights, white walls with pastel-printed couches, white printed and gold-trimmed plates, and a modern-antique interior. Already satisfied by the time I sat down, I eagerly took a look at the menu.The menu may have changed since the time I dined here to what is available at the moment, so I will just describe the dishes that I tried. For starters, my friend and I ordered a burrata dish with thin crispy bacon and tomatoes and grilled eggplant with labne and greens. Both dishes were light and tasty, perfect with a glass of wine to start off the evening. For mains we ordered the seared scallops and the prime aged rib eye steak. The scallops were tender, moist, and flavorful and the green celery root sauce went perfectly with them. The steak was cooked just right and the portion was big enough for two to share.My overall experience at the Whitby was quite pleasant and I will definitely be returning to try their other menus. I would recommend this place for a GNO or a special get together or event.",5,2,2,Dan-Ah K.,"Manhattan, NY",561,104,680
1.0,1/14/2018,"Horribly displeased with the service at Whitby. We came here, with a reservation, after the Downton Abby exhibit for afternoon tea. The wait staff and host were hard to find and the manager seemed frazzled. We were sat, 45 min late, with no apologies or explanations. After we were sat, we were told 1 of the 2 options for tea was not available. We asked for a dinner menu, to which the staff told us they didn't have enough and we would have to 'print more.' Another 10 minutes went by with no service and we decided to leave. Not one server or manager said 'sorry' 'what can we do' or anything. My group felt uncomfortable and unwelcomed. This was a sour experience and ruined our afternoon. Would not recommend.",1,1,0,Katie H.,"Rockaway, NJ",60,12,1

4.0,12/15/2017,"The place is beautiful and gets full on weekdays. It's classy with beautiful decor and intimate seating. I came here for holiday drinks and the place was packed! I must be getting old because stopped enjoying crowded places and loud noises. However, for those who like to see and be seen - this is the place to be. Well polished executive occupy the space of the bar while leaning in trying to keep up conversation under dimmed lighting. I got some champagne (they didn't have prosecco) and chips for the table. The chips were nice and crisp, but the portion was tiny. Overall - had a good time with a good company but it was very busy for my taste and our waiter seemed overwhelmed with the situation. Maybe it's just because of the holiday season...",2,0,1,Irina G.,"Edgewater, NJ",495,227,1534
5.0,12/8/2017,"If you like good food, craft drinks, and an excellent ambience this is your place to go.I went for dinner on a Wednesday and it was very busy. The tables are well spread so they are not so close to each other, making it easy to hold a conversation. The lights are dim and the music is at the right level, creating a cozy atmosphere.The staff was ver professional and attentive, specially the floor manager, Sydney, who made sure that everything was as ordered and asked whether I wanted anything else. She even told me about the place's decor and was very knowledgeable on how the food is prepared. I would definitely recommend the burger!One of my favorite things about this place was the drinks. The menu has countless options for wine and whisky, as well as unique cocktails. The bartenders, Nick and Grover, were very friendly from the beginning and definitely knew what they were doing. I asked for a bartender's choice and they did not disappoint with a 2-rum and campari drink. They hit the nail on the head with the first drink so instead of choosing from the menu I just asked them, and I'm so glad I did. The bar was packed and they still made time to make me a very elaborated drink, which everyone wanted to try (called Breakfast Ramos in case you want to order it).I left feeling I should go back soon, and I have no doubt I will. The spot is perfect to relax, a hidden gem in midtown.",2,0,0,Fabian C.,"Conneautville, PA",0,1,0

3.0,11/21/2017,"Both the bar and the food are really good.  We went in for an early dinner before a show and were not disappointed.  The place is airy and bright, and they have a descent cocktail menu.  The service was great and the price is about average for Manhattan.  We ordered the veal ragout and a burger and the ragout was delicious. The burger was descent, but not one of the best in the area.  It is not someplace we would make reservations for, but it is now on our bar list for this area.",0,0,0,Chris C.,"Morrisville, PA",8,146,0
2.0,11/2/2017,"The food is not the main attraction here.  It is about being in the front room that has an English Country sitting room vibe.   The restaurant, unfortunately, is plagued with indifferent/rude staff and the acoustics are horrible, the ""dining room"" feels cold and is loud in contrast to the warm and cozy front room.  The dining experience is similar to being placed the kids table at Thanksgiving; you are not the main attraction, you would prefer to be at the main table, no one cares what you eat, and you just want to go home.",0,0,0,Caroline D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0

3.0,10/7/2017,"Definitely a classy spot. If you work in the midtown area this place was a great pit-stop for a meeting and grabbing some delicious food ""BUT"" my opinion the portions can be slightly larger especially for the price. We ordered a few apps and entrees so as im getting back to what i said earlier and as you can see in my pics, i ordered 4 items and 3 cocktails came out to $200 plus... I understand 1. its NYC 2. im sure that the lease is crazy but overall experience it was super nice so my they should just give larger portions.FOOD: overall was really good but i wish for larger portions, DECOR: super nice cozy casual casualSERVICE: A+ Would i come back? 100% especially if im running around the city all day!",2,0,0,Hiro O.,"Beverly Hills, CA",147,259,1002

While sitting at our window table sipping champagne Martha Stewart, Meg Ryan and John Mellencamp were all in the house (not at the same time).  As is the case with New Yorkers nobody made a fuss but a murmur went through the room and then back to business as usual.

5.0,5/19/2017,"This has become our local go to spot for drinks. It's a beautifully designed bar, light and airy, reminiscent of the Crosby Hotel - no surprise since it's the same owners. The cocktails are well prepared. They have a bar menu for food as well, and also serve an afternoon tea, which I have not tried yet. My favorite drink was the peaches and peppers, but the drink menu is seasonal and so they now have a new selection of drinks. The bar tenders are friendly. If you live or work in midtown / midtown west, I'd argue that this is the best cocktail bar/meeting spot you are going to find. Definitely check it out, it's been open a littleover a month and I've been 4 times already.",1,0,1,Rick S.,"New York, NY",5,187,18
