1.0,9/23/2018,"Last night, Saturday Sept. 22, we had a long anticipated birthday dinner booked at Kingsley.  One person flew all the way in from San Francisco for the event.  We arrived at exactly on time at 7:30p for our reservation and the place was CLOSED.  No note on the door, no phone call in advance....nothing.  Opentable even emailed us the day before confirming our table.  We were not the only people with a reservation standing outside on the sidewalk wondering what the hell was going either.  Unacceptable and inexcusable. We had to scramble to find another place to eat at the last minute.An entire day later no one has reached out to us with an explanation or apology. Just terrible. Obviously we will NEVER be back.

3.0,8/2/2018,"Had dinner here during restaurant week. The restaurant itself is poshly decorated and dimly lit.. I had the BBQ chicken confit as a main.. the sauce was too red and tomatoe-like for my taste. Accompanied peppers and bacon was too salty, cornbread was pretty good. My friend had the striped bass. He liked it his meal. I tasted the bass and was underwhelmed. Service was good, all in all, I wasn't wooed.",0,0,0,Tekeya P.,"Flatlands, Brooklyn, NY",335,6,2
5.0,7/28/2018,"What a gem. How can you beat this quality of food for the price point?!? Just look at the pickle tater tots. The amount of work, love, and skill that goes into these tots is just inspiring. They're shredded pickles (I would bet pickled in house) shaped into tots and fried to the level of crisp that made me fear for the roof of my mouth in a good (great) way. Also delicious duh. Anyone saying otherwise.. duck outta here. Yall probably can't even make a ready to make costco tot right you salty self righteous Yelp yuppies.  Walking in on Ave b I was definitely not expecting food of this caliber. Every dish has the mark of a seasoned and inventive chef and an incredibly competent kitchen staff. We even got an amuse bouche sitting at the bar. (Speaking of the bar.. it has cushion underneath to keep from customers bumping their fragile little knees. Touches like that are really telling of the nature of the people who built it and a good signifier of the food to come) The octopus is cooked to perfection, so tender inside with the most delicate of char outside, and is enveloped in a little floof of umami yogurt and beets prepped TWO ways-one creamy almost like confit garlic, one  pickled for a refreshing break in texture and sour. The beef tartar, which I am usually not partial to ordering, is divine and crazy generous, heaps of herbaceous tendrils of meat somehow all individually coated in creamy, salty, eggy goodness.

2.0,7/20/2018,"Well this place certainly looks appetizing. From the bone marrow to the poached duck egg the menu lured me in. But unfortunately none of the items were over the top amazing. Foie Gras was okay, bone marrow was worth mentioning as I'd never had it before. Also had the halibut, and some of the mussels that it came with were bad, should probably not have been plated. The razor clams are worth trying if you've never seen a razor clam. They are long and chewy and in a ragu type sauce. When we got here a couple was leaving and asking for the check because they were tired of waiting for their food. We though they were impatient but an hour and a half later we were just getting our last dish, and not because we ate slow. Great name, good presentation, really eclectic menu but overall wouldn't be back. Now we know.",0,0,0,Keeley G.,"New York, NY",8,107,90
3.0,7/8/2018,"Came here for brunch on a Sunday. We were the only ones in the restaurant since we came right when they opened at noon. The prices were not too expensive $12-20. They also had a Build-you-Own Bloody Mary bar which isn't a bad deal for a pint. A couple of dishes were over-salted. The potatoes that came with my Eggs Florentine were completely covered in sea salt. At one point, we were even washing the potatoes with water so we could eat it. And the Wagyu burger mostly tasted like salt. The scallion pancake came out a bit soggy instead of crispy. The ambience is nice but I was not very impressed with their food.",0,0,0,Vivian C.,"Cincinnati, OH",420,118,523
5.0,6/18/2018,"I went to dinner on Father's Day and was expecting a long wait or a crowded restaruant, but was able to make reservations online and indicate if we preferred indoor/outdoor seating. Outdoor was small and a little loud with the air conditioners going, but the food and service definitely made up for it! The cocktails were really tasty and pretty strong. Our server was super nice and gave us a ton of information about how the food was prepared. It's tapas style, so anticiapte smaller portions. We ordered the bone marrow (it's carved out for you so nothing goes to waste), the cod (in a delcious miso sauce), the scallops (raw), and the asparagus and they were all a 10/10 for us. We thought we were all set but decided to order dessert and went with the blueberry cheescake with blue cheese. I'm not a fan of blue cheese, but the flavor was really faint, and made for a delicious contrast with the blueberry. The prices are on the moderate to pricey side. We're definitely going back, but sitting indoors this time.",1,0,0,Jennifer G.,"Elmhurst, NY",1,4,1
3.0,6/17/2018,"It's a decent neighborhood spot with outdoor seating. The food is good but not everything works. This was my second visit here. On the bar menu, the fried chicken, asparagus, and beef tartare were on point. The chicharrones with kim chi was tasty but nothing amazing. The pickle tots (tater tots with pickle mixed inside) were awkward even though I love both. I would skip it next time. Definitely do skip the deviled pork sliders as it was super dry. On the dinner menu, the bone marrow was too dressed for what it is. Too much was going on with it. Bone marrow just needs to be well salted, it's meat butter after all. The tagliatelle was tasty but extremely rich. Between the butter and ham consomme, you're getting a flavor bomb. It makes sense that as such, the portion is extremely tiny. You'll be hungry if that's all you ordered. The place of good and the staff is friendly. It's a decent place for a chill night.",0,0,0,Tony Y.,"New York, NY",250,177,1053
2.0,6/14/2018,Pretty restaurant but service is awful and food is sort of gross. Everything is either overly buttered or overly salted. We got the cod and the halibut and both were gross. Not worth the money unfortunately. Was with 3 people and 1 person got their meal about 20 min before the other 2. Pass on this restaurant.,0,0,0,Sarah A.,"Manhattan, NY",1,9,8

1.0,6/9/2018,"One of the worst dining experiences we have ever experienced. The amuse Bouche was inedible, the halibut was cold, the prawns nondescript and the duck egg was merely decent. The waiter was polite but did not clean the table between courses and only saving grace was his consistently pouring our bottled sparkling water into our glasses. For the inordinately high prices charged, one would expect to be served with very tasty food.There is also a general feeling tone of pseudo-elitism, as if the restaurateur is doing their patrons a favor by eating this very mediocre fare.",0,0,0,Jerry S.,"New York, NY",0,9,0

1.0,5/13/2018,"I really wanted to try Kingsley tonight. The menu looked good to me and appeared to have something for everyone in my party. I checked on availability via open table and the restaurant had a ton of availability so I didn't make a reservation since the three of us were not decided on what time we'd want to eat. So, we arrive at Kingsley at 7pm, tell whoever is at the door that we don't have a reservation and are promptly told that we cannot be accommodated without a reservation. I go online via phone right there and successfully complete a reservation for three! We are then told by someone else who had joined the discussion that we could possibly be seated at 7:30, since the restaurant schedules their staff based on reservations on the books...what? If you don't like walk ins make mention of this on your website. When I point out that I just received a confirmation e mail for my 7pm reservation the lady who joined the conversation tells me that no, the reservation she sees is for 7:30. Again, what??

2.0,5/1/2018,"Everything we ate and drank here was pretty good but the service is so snobby - especially for the location(the people eating in there always look like people's visiting grandparents)! I went with a few friends who were excited about tasting something from the liquor menu, but when she asked for it with a little soda, the waiter said he'd have to open a bottle and charge us for it. Also I've come in more than once looking to have a cocktail outside or by the window only to be asked if I have a reservation, because the tables are reserved? Super weird to me to walk into an empty restaurant on the block ""where I live and be told hm, all the empty tables by the windows and outside are reserved. Maybe you'd like to sit at our dark bar between two other people and watch an E list celebrity get sent plate after plate of free food?"" I'm not like a huge bar person but this is the only bar on Ave B that I'm not at least familiar with the people in because it seems so unwelcoming and fancy. Also the upselling of the already super expensive menu is aggressive - try and order an appetizer without having your entire dinner order ready and you will be informed boredly that they don't do things like that here...you can order once or not at all. Ok?? big shoutout to the bartender who was working both times I did eat here though - she was such a badass and made delicious beautiful cocktails very happily and quickly despite having to make complicated mixed drinks for an entire bar and restaurant on her own seemingly the whole time we were there. Hire this woman a barback !! If she worked anywhere else I'd eagerly go back because she was so nice and cool.  Otherwise this restaurant pretty much seems like a place to take visiting baby boomers who are afraid to eat anywhere else below 42nd street.

Well, I asked for their ramen (regular, no vegetarian)...what a disappointment! It tasted like salty water, or just a very bland miso? It had a half of bok choy, some mushrooms (good), some scallions, no nori, egg (only yolk) and 2 of the smallest pieces of pork ever. I guess it was my mistake to ask for ramen in a place that it may be better for other things. They had fresh orange juice and I asked for one but it was so watered down and sour to taste ( maybe one of the oranges was bitter).

The menu is an eclectic mix of comfort foods, new and old, tending towards the bacon-y/fried side of things.I was just in the mood for an omelette with toast and hash browns, so I ordered ""two eggs, any style"". I was told that they can do eggs any way except for an omelette - perhaps I'd like them scrambled? How about a Diet Coke? Sorry, no soft drinks. Cream or half-and-half for coffee? No, all we have is 2% milk. It was all a little strange for a large, relatively expensive restaurant that's been around a while.I ended up getting the vegetarian ramen, which was pretty good, particularly the mushrooms.

I came on a Tuesday night with a friend of mine, but maybe i should have come with my boyfriend :PThe service during the whole meal was excellent and I had the chance to try some of their signature dishes. We started with Chawanmushi which is an egg custard with mushroom, orange and brown butter, I'm not a fan of the consistency but the overall taste was really good! After that we had scallops with brussels sprouts, bacon and black truffle... this dish was a bomb! Definitely my favorite of the whole dinner, the scallops were perfectly cooked and really tender.Another dish was grilled prawns with gnocchi, but unfortunately there were only 4 gnocchi in the dish and they were not as soft as I would expect from this kind of pasta, but the dish itself was good. We also tried the steak tartare, such a simple and tasteful recipe. If you are a meat lover you should definitely order this! Last but not least the blood orange tart, usually when i have a dessert I always like to have something chocolate but let me say..this tart was a game changer!!!

It's so elegant and romantic. It's the perfect place to go to if you want a nice dinner with a loved one. I went with my boyfriend since it's an anomaly to find such an upscale restaurant in the heart of Alphabet City. To give you an idea, they have sterling silver silverware. The food is also very delicious, and they treat their food and drinks as a craft to master in terms of taste and appearance. My boyfriend got the Bone Marrow Luge and after he was done with his appetizer-sized meal, the waitress brought him a shot of bourbon mixed with something yummy to drink from his now empty bone marrow luge and to wash out the remaining flavors. How cool is that?! The service is exceptional here!However, this segways into the negative as well. Most of the menu is made up of appetizer-sized portions and holds a hefty price. Obviously, the few most expensive items are the only entrees on a list of about 15 choices which is slightly ridiculous. Look to my pictures and you'll see I ordered a cod for dinner and it was smaller than the palm of my tiny hand... this place will leave you hungry! Come here for the aesthetic and a small sized item. You'll probably need to eat elsewhere afterwards since you'll still be a bit hungry. If it were solely based off of aesthetic and service this place is #1.

Kingsley is one of those places that feels like it's been here for years in that the staff seems to treat everyone like regulars. The drink menu is deliciously adventurous but not pretentious.

3.0,1/8/2018,"It's hard giving Kingsley only 3 stars because the service was great, but unfortunately, the food was bottom line not good, and borderline bad.The background:I came here with a large group that purchased a gilt city voucher for a dinner for 20 people including wine pairings. The price was quite reasonable for what we got, so no issues there. Unfortunately, the management refused to send us a menu ahead of time, and I wouldn't have chosen any of the things we got if ordering on my own.Drinks/Service5 starsThe cocktail selection was interesting. The service with the drinks, refilling the water, bringing out and explaining the wine pairings that went with each dish was great. They also explained what each dish was when they brought it out, which I appreciated.They also were able to adapt each dish for my boyfriend who has a gluten allergy and in some instances substituted his dish, which was nice. Food (see pictures)For food, I'd give it 2 stars, and the reason for the 2 stars and not less is because the first 2 things we got were pretty good (as was one of my boyfriend's substituted dish since he can't eat gluten)They brought out an amuse bouche, which I enjoyed. I don't remember exactly what it was, but it tasted like ceviche.First course was a soup, which was quite tasty and had a nice kick to it.  I think it was pumpkin.Second course was a disgusting pasta with escargot.  The pasta was hard and obviously not cooked well.  Someone next to me tried the escargot and said it wasn't good so I didn't even bother trying it.  My boyfriend lucked out with the second course since he can't have pasta because they gave him a scallop which was actually pretty good and well executed.  Third course was also something I wouldn't have chosen for myself, which was the pork dish.  The crispy skin was really good, but that was about it.  I didn't think it was tender or cooked well, the cabbage was bland and I did not enjoy the sausage.  I realize they were probably giving us their cheapest dishes since we had bought a deal, but for a cost to the restaurant of $2 more per person they could've given us the duck, which came with foie gras, which i think people would've much preferred.For dessert, I honestly don't even know what it was, but it basically tasted like frosting on a cake, and not good frosting. The dessert came with a pistachio flavor sauce and tomatoes, which just did not work for me.Overall, I definitely will not be back, which is a disappointment because the group obviously had a nice time since we were all together and the service was good.",2,1,1,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634
1.0,12/21/2017,"Went to Kingsley last night with a large group of friends and had a horrendous experience with the service there. We originally had a 9pm reservation which we pushed back to 9:30pm due to unforseen circumstances and was told it was not a problem. We show up on time and there is only one table that could accomodate us and another group seated there was still in the middle of their meal. We waited 50 minutes to get seated! We asked (instead of being offered) if our round of drinks at the bar could be complimentary. Instead they gave us two cheap bottles of champagne during dinner. The whole group got the tasting menu and the food was good but not enough quantity. At the end of the night, we received the bill and left a good tip despite the poor service. While we were leaving we heard the staff laughing amongst themselves and saying that our group didn't notice something on the bill. We went back and noticed that there was a $300 service charge as one of the items of the bill that was supposed to be included tip. We were confused because no one told us about the service charge and we left a tip on top of it. The manager explained it clearly said it on the menu when ordering the tasting menu but we called ahead of time and told the restaurant we were doing the tasting menu so they never even gave us a menu when we arrived.

We heard about this restaurant through CBS Saturday Morning. We've had good experience with their recommendations before so we thought we'd give this place a try. We ordered from the standard menu as opposed to the restaurant week menu. We both placed the same order of Summer greens salad, Agnolotti with Fois Gras, and Wagyu Steak. The salad was mediocre and the Agnolotti was inedible. Super sweet filling in the Agnolotti with Fois Gras that was more Gras than Fois. The Wagyu Steak was rare (we ordered medium) and very fatty (like short ribs kind of fatty). I asked the waiter if this steak was fatty and he said it's nothing like short rib. Well, it was cholesterol filled, heart attack inducing kind of fatty. I asked the waiter if I could order something else and he said he would speak to the chef and came back with the check!I've never been treated so poorly at a ""high end"" restaurant in my life!  So short sighted that they rather lose a client for life, and the potential client losses affected from a bad review, than simply accommodate me with something else on the menu. I said I would be happy to have chicken from the menu and pay for the steak and the waiter said they don't do this kind of substitute. I was very nice and the waiter was rude.

The menu is very approachable. It's got a downtown East Village approach but there is a certain sophistication she adds to it, probably due to her time at Blue Hill. Service is friendly not stiff. Knowledgeable but not intrusive.

2.0,6/20/2017,"We had a very disappointing experience at Kingsley, a place that was much hyped up. At the end of the day, the food at our brunch just wasn't good and the service did not amend for it. The ramen we ordered was perhaps the most disappointing dish of all. For $15, it was extremely salty to the point of being almost inedible. I usually cook my food on the salty side but this was too much even for me. The noodle tasted like someone drench it with soy sauce. Moreover, the menu description was also extremely misleading. For ""spring vegetables,"" there were only a few slices of iceberg lettuce, a couple razor thin cucumbers and radishes. For ""egg,"" it was nothing but a few slices of the fake instant eggs one could've gotten from a budget motel. The ""nori"" that was listed was also missing from the actual food. Finally, the noodles were also covered with some sort of spicy sauce. Although I didn't mind the spice, it was nevertheless extremely spicy and Kingsley could've mentioned ""spicy"" on the menu. This noodle was one of the worst $15 I've spent on food (you can't even use one real egg?). I could've gotten a much better ramen at probably 90%+ of the shops throughout Manhattan. As for the burger we ordered, while the patty was juicy, the whole thing was nevertheless overpowered by the cheese used. The cheese would've have been more suitable on a charcuterie board with jam, but not on a burger. We felt Kingsley had tried to be innovative by attempting to create fusion yet without a true understanding of how to compliment the flavors of the west and east. The ingredients felt forced together and suppress, instead of bringing out the essence, of each other. We might have been impressed by the decor and setting, but the restaurant is in the business of food. If the food simply tastes bad, then the restaurant has lost its core. Food aside, the staff was unimpressive also. The servers did not timely refill our glasses or check on us after the food had arrived. When told about our disappointment in the food, they did absolutely nothing to try to remedy or improve the situation.Bottom line, we all want to believe the best out of a promising restaurant with mainly good reviews, but this place is just not worth it.",6,0,0,Jenn Z.,"Boston, MA",138,239,28

1.0,5/6/2017,"**I've waited a bit to write this review but after returning with a prospective client and having a similar experience, I decided to follow through.I was so excited to experience Kingsley after the  many praises I've heard from a number of friends and my lovely wife who enjoys spending tons of time there. She normally stops by after work with her partner or heads to the patio.The host was kind as we entered (as the meal progressed we found him to be a little loud and erratic for such a chill setting) and our bartender Miranda was prompt, attentive and knowledgable to boot. We had the bone marrow, tartare, foie gras, pasta, halibut and the beef. All amazing and delicious. Do you know how hard it is to enjoy your meal when you hear nothing but curse words and screaming coming out of the kitchen? My wife and I tried to make the best of it by turning it into a drinking game but after a few glasses of wine we decided to quit because we both had to work early in the morning. Listen, we eat at top tier places all of the time. We've visited Gordon Ramsey's place in London, Brooklyn Fare, Eleven Madison, etc, andwe've often sat at the chefs table. It wasn't a busy night and from what we could hear (yes we were eaves droppin/no it's not hard when people are yelling) there was no real need for what was happening.  ""Get the f*** back here/What the f*** is wrong with you/Why aren't they ready?--Well I don't give a s*** just put it on the table/F*** her!No, I'm not doing that"".... it just went on and on and we were embarassed for the staff. We didn't stay for dessert.This review would be a 5 star rating if my wife and I didn't have to listen to the staff be belittled and screamed at. It's hard to enjoy your food when the person handing it to you is on the verge of tears and the rest of the staff looks scared for their lives.

1.0,4/30/2017,"This review is based on the bar only.  The (head?) bartender, Rosie, is an absolute travesty.  For an 'upscale' place, she is completely out of her element.  Bad attitude, and, a bit of slob, Rosie really disappoints.  We're EV residents and initially stopped there for a quick drink and pleasantly greeted by a gentleman bartender, Deegan, who was class.  After a few visits, we found out Deegan moved on.  Whatever, it happens.  However, the last few times (~3), we've had the misfortune of dealing with Rosie at the bar.  She's brash, arrogant, and just plain antisocial. Given that cocktails are ~$15+, I'm simply baffled and wondering if Deegan left b/c of her trash attitude.  I know I would given what we've seen.  She's dismissive to the customers and seems to relish berating the staff in public.  Highly unprofessional. Anyways, food may be fine but we'll never know b/c of our sour experience at the bar, we won't be returning.  Owners really need to take heed as it's bar/ambiance is one of the few higher class places in EV (and we'd actually like to like it!)",0,0,0,Steve B.,"New York, NY",0,14,0

At a price of $60 pp plus the cost of alcohol. I would have rather spent $100+ pp and actually have been satisfied with what they called a ""meal"". What was served from the pre fixe were 3 ""courses"" that were each no larger than my fist and they were all completely underwhelming and disappointing. Service was OK but nothing to write home about... I then asked if we could have dessert to go, which proved to be a challenge because ""the chef would be too concerned about presentation"", so they had to bring it out on the plate (which took 15+ minutes after our disappointing food, and then wait again for a box so we could package our desserts, which wound up being barely edible. In terms of the food, my boyfriend had the crab benedict which was served on toasted french bread, which proved to be challenging to eat... why not just serve on an English muffin?

3.0,4/2/2017,"When Zagat released their list of 2017 Best Newcomer Restaurants of the year, I wasn't the only one surprised to find Kingsley at the top of their list. There had been very little news on the restaurant beforehand, and after skimming through their menus and a handful of other reviews and photos, opted to come here for a friend over a weekend brunch on Superbowl Sunday.Kingsley is located a little farther from the main area of East Village on Avenue B, and the stately entrance and exterior looked rather out of place in an otherwise disheveled area. Upon entering, however, we were greeted by the smiling hostess and an impressive array of ingredients from their weekend Bloody Mary Bar - an attractive draw for those who enjoy their afternoon drinks. After being seated, however, things started to go downhill.We were without menus and water for a significant amount of time, and after our server finally came by to take our order, it took over 40 minutes until we received our first plate of food. Our server failed to update us until we got his attention to ask, and immediately deferred any blame from himself, noting that he had put the order in promptly and ""didn't know why it was taking the kitchen so long"". It was even more perplexing since there were only two or three other parties seated.As for the food, I can't say it was notably better or distinct. Our starting appetizer, which was  a special for the weekend was a small bowl of Chicarrones Nachos. It took what was traditionally the base of corn tortilla chips and replaced them with a handful of airy, crispy pork skins and topped them with a smoked white cheddar sauce, sliced avocado, cilantro, and crisp bacon. It was a tasty combination that was finished well with fresh cilantro, but quite small in portion especially given the price.For our mains, we shared the Wagyu Burger; it was cooked to our requested medium rare, and we enjoyed the impressive array of toppings, including melted Brie, bacon strips, a caramelized onion aoili, brûléed pear slices, and a fried egg. The brioche bun wasn't enough to support the burger, however, and we didn't note anything in the ground beef patty that was particularly distinctive. As for the Crispy Pork Belly and Tator Tot Hash, we were immediately won over by the textural contrast in each piece of pork belly and the pickle flavor present in the tator tots and, of course, the runny yolk in the fried eggs.In hindsight, the food was probably at a solid four stars, but given the lackluster experience with the service, Kingsley won't be a restaurant that I'd look forward to returning to.",12,7,7,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

2.0,3/6/2017,"Sadly, we were underwhelmed. Poor (and inappropriate) service and small portions simply do not justify the price. Most of the food was pretty good - though not earth shattering or anything I would say ""I must come back here for the [xxx]!"" However, the portions were SMALL. Notably steer clear of the egg custard with snails - nearly inedible. For $185 / pp for the nine course tasting menu with wine, we expected bigger portions (each was 3-4 bites, except the final course of steak, by which point we were STARVING) and better service. We arrived on time for an 8:30 reservation and were told we could have a table very close to other diners and blocked by the hostess stand or we could wait for 10 min for a table by the window (much more private). We were in no rush so had a drink at the bar, happy to wait. 40 MINUTES later still no table available. I am sorry but if you tell someone 10 minutes, 40 minutes is unacceptable. Again, for a place this pricey, be better. We ended up eating at the bar instead of waiting indefinitely.Worse though, was the offennsive service we received / witnessed during our meal. The woman (and very new bartender) who served our food and wine did so in an extremely brusque fashion, racing through the descriptions and sometimes not even providing them. We often didn't have silverware or wine glasses at the same time. For all the rushing of the plates, we had a lot of time in between courses.The final issue was the altercations we witnessed between stressed out servers / employees and inappropriate conversations between our server and bartender. Again, If i am paying $20 for a beer and chicken wings I might not care if the bartender is talking about people hooking up and getting wasted, but this is not that type of place. Also, a big group of drunk people who were clearly friends of the staff arrived near the end of our meal - around 11am since it took FOREVER - so we promptly got the check and left.What a disappointment.

5.0,3/5/2017,"Yes. Just, yes. To all of it. Stop reading this and just go to Kingsley already. Let's break it down:Atmosphere: 5/5 - Cute, bright, clean, impeccably decorated, comfortable and a bunch of other great adjectives. It is a beautiful space, and we only sat at the bar!Fare: 6/5 - Miranda, the bar manager, is EVERYTHING. I have had quite a few cocktails in my day, and she made me my now favorite cocktail that I have ever had. It was some brown-butter bourbon nonsense that was all I ever needed and more. It's on the menu, so order it. And it's Miranda's creation so make sure you're lucky enough to have her behind the bar. You guys, she even makes some cocktails IN A SODASTREAM. Before that, we started with some hot toddy's because god hates NYC and decided to make it feel like Antarctica outside. It's exactly what we needed and immediately put us in a much better mood. The food was impeccable too. We had come to Kinglsey after brunch elsewhere, so we only wanted to share pickle-tots with a sriracha mayo (GET THESE!) to nosh on while we cocktailed, and from there we ordered the brussel sprouts and the pâté. My friend, who had a bad pâté first experience elsewhere, was just tipsy enough for me to convince him to let me put it in his mouth...the pâté...and he is now a convert. Delish. They also sent over an AMAZING agnolotti with foie gras, which I'm pretty sure I had 3 or 4 dreams about last night. Everything is EVERYTHING here.Service: 6/5 - Again, Miranda is like if heaven were a bartender. We were laughing and chatting with her for like 4 hours. All of the other staff is super great as well, including Garrett and his hair.Overall 6/5 - I told you at the beginning of this review to stop reading and just go right now.

But I loved that you get to have a long meal and that you are never rushed. The tasting  menu portions were on the smaller side but after 9 courses you get very full, I am not a small guy and I was stuffed. You are just left wanting more of some of the really great items.

Both cooked amazingly well, octopus was actually well seasoned. Sweetbreads had no flavor. For mains had wagnu beef and the gloucester spot pork. Both were lukewarm. Neither was seasoned, and the pork was so fatty it was near inedible.Sorry, my score is so low because this restauran is getting too much hype.

Whenever I go to a multi course meal restaurant with fancy small portions of foods on big ass plates, I like to compare it to my experience at per se and eleven Madison. Verdict: I still prefer per se, but food was better than eleven Madison.I was a little apprehensive when I came reading about the service, but I can absolutely say the service was impeccable. Our waiter constantly kept a close eye on our glasses and came to refill without asking. Dishes came out one after another very quickly and each time we asked for bread refills, they would come with more than the last.Just an FYI though, although they may close at midnight on a Wednesday, their kitchen closes at 10.

2.0,2/12/2017,"This place is a bit inconvenient to reach so took a while to finally come and try it out. First impression- cute ambience and probably a romantic dating spot. There were 7 of us and we ordered every dish on the menu to share. Only good dish we liked was probably the bone marrow. Service: was extremely slow. Nobody came to refill the water until we asked. We first ordered a bottle of wine to share, but it took the waiter till almost the end of the meal to come and pour the rest of the wine. Without asking if we wanted another bottle, they took away the glasses as soon as we finished the wine. Even though the restaurant was half empty, wait time between courses took a LONG time.

3.0,2/6/2017,"One of the most trendy and complimented newcomer restaurant in 2017. However, my brunch experience was mixed with more misses than hits. Overall 3.5 stars.Very nice interior and ambiance--modern and upscale, quite a bit of difference compared to its neighborhood. The service and speed were disappointing. We had to ask for water after seated for a few minutes because no one asked/checked on us. Then we waited 50+mins before served with the first dish. Starving to death, we asked if our dish was being prepared in the kitchen (just a nacho dish). Our waiter blamed it on the kitchen saying he past the order on time, it's the kitchen's fault. It's shocking to hear that answer when we were expecting better service/team spirit at the ""best newcomer restaurant"". However, he did offer us coffee/juice to make up for the long wait.Let's move to food. It's solid but nothing ""wow"". Nachos as a super bowl special was delicious. The fried pig skin is crispy and not greasy. We also shared the wagyu beef burger and pork belly as mains. The wagyu beef was over cooked, more like medium instead of he medium rare that we asked for... the meat is tender but not as juicy as expected. Pork belly with sunny side-up and fried potato was a hit although I would also prefer the meat to be more juicy.Overall a bit of an underwhelming experience.",9,5,7,Cristina X.,"New York, NY",451,446,3609
4.0,2/5/2017,"Came here for restaurant week! Really friendly staff and nice ambience.For my starter, I got the Brussels Sprouts Salad which came with manchego, walnut, apple, and their cider vinaigrette. Nothing special, but good starter and a generous portion considering it's a restaurant week starter.For my main entree, I got the roasted chicken breast which came with garlic aioli, mushrooms, and pommes lyonnaise (essentially a hash brown/home fries type dish). The main was amazing and way exceeded my expectations. The portion was also very generous. The chicken was a very pleasant surprise. It was cut into 3 or 4 large slices and tasted similar to delicious thick cut ham. It was extremely flavorful. The pommes lyonnaise added a bit of unexpected crunch to the chicken and was just superb! The mushrooms were also good and added extra flavor to the already flavorful chicken.I ended with the caramelized apples which was a bit disappointing. The smoked brown butter ice cream had a super ""burnt"" taste (which I think was the point?) but it was super overpowering for me and blocked out the taste for everything else in the dish. Could have skipped that one!Overall, positive experience at the restaurant!

5.0,1/31/2017,Having lived in the neighborhood for 22 years I can say this place has the wildest and tastiest cocktails. The bartenders are beyond intuitive to the customer's needs. Now for the food. The menu is a beautiful mix of classic french/american with modern twists. The wagyu is scrumptious. And the pickle tots with siracha aioli are even better than the name sounds. I've also been here for brunch (due to the roll out of bed proximity) and the green bloody maria is a heathy hair of the dog you must try as well as the ricotta fritters.

5.0,1/14/2017,"This place is outstanding. Went for my wife's bday (after seeing that this won best new American restaurant in NYC for 2016 in Zagat) and enjoyed the 9 course tasting menu and were really glad we did since it's basically an almost complete sampling of their menu, which we looked at and had a hard time choosing because everything looked so yummy. This place is nice but cool/funky and not stuffy at all for such good food. For starters, their wine list was extensive but very approachable and they had divided their wine more by body and flavor/character which I liked. Then from the amuse bouche (Brussel sprout with miso butter and sea salt) all the way to the dessert, we were really awed by the different flavor profiles of the dishes and interesting pairings and combinations. For instance, bone marrow in the bone with braised short rib and a shot of date-infused mezcal (if I recall correctly) that they suggest you ""luge"" college ice-luge-style at the end, picking up the bone marrow bits. Yum!On top of that, our server was very knowledgeable about all parts of the menu and made a few accommodations for my wife on the tasting menu as she doesn't eat a couple things. I would highly recommend this place for a date or even a casual meal during the week as the non tasting menu is not insanely expensive.",1,0,0,Michael K.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,10,1
3.0,1/7/2017,The only thing that impressed me was the foie gras. My wife really liked the bone marrow but I thought that was just typical.

1.0,1/2/2017,"Absolutely the most disappointing New Years eve dinner experience Ive ever had.  Avoid this place.  We were to pay $125 each for a 7 course meal that started at 930pm. By 1120 we were still on course 3.  The portions were excruciatingly small and unfulfilling.   By the time we got to the main course of the fish with a fried rice or the venison option-  we were close to midnight. Just when you think things couldn't  get any worse, the fish came out raw for three of our party of 7 and burnt for one of us. The 'fried rice' was just one rice cracker when we looked at the plate and asked the server where the rice was. The Venison option was literally 4 small cubes of meat which could have easily been an appetizer or even a kids portion. The champagne toast at midnight was also a meager pouring fit perhaps for a person trying a sip of a drink for the very first time.  It was beyond belief this evening happened but I think they realized it and comped the meal.  Just don't ever eat here if you want to leave in a good mood and satisfied with your experience.

But it's a shame the service is so bad.Had drinks at the bar before getting seated and the bartender raved about a few items on the bar menu and he said we could get them at the table. When we sat and ordered, were told they can't do that. Really? You can't bring a burger and pickles to our table which is literally 3 feet from the bar? Ridiculous.Seemed as though there was one waiter for the dining room, so service was really slow. Took so long for our waiter to come and take our order. And two apps came out before our drinks/wine, so we had to remind him to bring that to us. We were offered a round of drinks from the bartender for the menu snafu, but literally after our check arrived and were ready to leave. What could have been a nice gesture seemed half hearted due to the timing.If they got their act together in the service department it could be a great resto because the atmosphere is really inviting and the food is great.",2,0,1,Stacey F.,"Tampa, FL",13,129,5
3.0,12/28/2016,"Kingsley has the potential to be a stellar restaurant. The space is warm and welcoming and the food was amazing. However, the service is atrocious for the type of place Kingsley is striving to be. Ordering drinks was easy, getting them was difficult. When asked where they were the waiter said the bartender was busy- not the best when ordering a $14 cocktail. And this type of service extended to the food. The restaurant was not busy, yet we had about a 3 hour meal. When we asked about our food a good 1 hour into our meal, we were told there was a big table of 10 and the kitchen was busy with that order. I felt bad for the server and hostess (the only people that came by our table) as they were both only 2 weeks on the job and obviously had no one senior helping them out advising them how to handle the situation. Management was no where to be seen anywhere.

5.0,12/4/2016,"I came for brunch with three friends, for a total of four people in our party (this becomes important to the review, hence the specificity on the size of our group).As some people have noted, your full group needs to be present to be seated. As my friend and I were the first two of our group to arrive, we hung out in the cute lounge area in the immediate entry area for a while, then ordered cocktails at the bar while we waited for the rest of our group to filter in. The waiting lounge is adorable, with cute decor and comfy seating.I ordered an Oaxaca Smash as my cocktail, and tried one friend's Iron Liege 1957. Both were quite good; personally, I thought the Oaxaca Smash was slightly better, and more suited for a brunch.We ordered all our food to share, and got the following: 1. Crispy pork belly and pickle tot hash: AMAZING. I could honestly have eaten two servings of this on my own, it was that good. The combination of crispy, salty pork belly, hash, and runny egg yolk is perfection.2. Chicharrones: very good, and an interesting combination. I personally loved these, but the overall opinion at the table was a little mixed. I thought the kimchi cut the richness of the chicharrones really well.3. House cured bacon: this is pretty standard bacon. If it were me, I'd skip this.4. Ginger/garlic pork sausage buns: this was not great. The sausage was a little grainy, and the idea of replacing pork belly with sausage in a bao is a little odd.5. Pork belly sliders: these were SO, SO good. I highly recommend these. The crusty bread, pickled veggies and rich pork belly are so, so good. The combination is very reminiscent of Num Pang's sandwiches, which I'm also a huge fan of. The only small note here is that the pork belly is a little salty.A useful note for parties planning to share dishes: the sliders and buns come in threes, so if you want to share dishes, groups in multiples of three (3, 6, etc) are best off. Because we were four people, we wound up doubling our slider and bun orders in order to allow everyone to taste those dishes.Between four people, the final bill came out to $50 (including tax and tip) per person, which I think is really reasonable for an amazing meal.Long short short: get the pork belly hash, pork belly sliders, and chicharrones.

3.0,11/20/2016,"Note: A three feels unfair, but so does a four.I'm going to focus this review on things that I don't think were done well, so that hopefully this feedback is meaningful and improves the restaurant experience for others going forward. As it stands right now, I have no intention to return and cannot see myself recommending the place to others.First - seating - I'm a bit astonished as to the purpose of making a reservation well in advance (when many tables appeared to be open) only to be seated in the antechamber next to the door, with nary a glimpse of the main dining room or the quieter more private back dining room. The seating felt like an afterthought and for much of the meal it was hard to hear (despite the foam insulation under the tables!) due to the placement of a seat the adjoining table such that the speaker was in effect facing my table the entire time while talking loudly. It was a poorly selected location and felt unfair and disappointing to never set foot in the actual restaurant -- straight from the hostess stand back towards the exit.Second - on the point of the cluelessness of the hosting set-up - the hostess specifically asked if we were celebrating something special, to which we replied (and she acknowledged) that we were celebrating a birthday. Yet, nothing at all came of that. Let me qualify and clarify this point in two ways so that people don't view this as a complaint from entitlement: first, later that evening, another group did apparently have something done for a birthday, complete with candle and all; second, it strikes me as inappropriate to ask, if there's nothing to be done. We did not volunteer that we were there for a birthday - the host specifically inquired. Quite simply, as a matter of service, it is better not to inquire at all than to inquire and do nothing. It is puzzling and indicates an extraordinary degree of disorganization.Third - now we're at the meal - the pace was interminably and unacceptably slow. Our meal took significantly north of four hours. The pacing was erratic and disorganized. There was no indication that was this was unacceptably long or any attempt to indicate that the kitchen felt it was too slow. We've had more than our fair share of tasting menus of length in this city and none was as inexplicably drawn out of an affair as this. Nothing required such astonishing preparatory efforts as to justify this delay. This one factor alone is sufficient reason that I cannot recommend this place. Just too long.Fourth - the tasting menu itself - the menu is fine but a bit imbalanced. Specifically, for example, the meal concludes somewhat abruptly following the last (large?) savory course with just one very small dessert. Dessert, in other words, has not been integrated thoughtfully into the tasting menu in any significant way and might as well be missing. It surely felt omitted. Second, I felt the vegetarian tasting menu was significantly underwhelming. It felt, frankly, like a bit of a rip-off. There was nothing in terms of ingredients, preparation, or technique, that came anywhere close to making it feel comparable as a meal to the tasting menu served as the standard option. It should simply not be offered if it can't be done well. Or if it can be done, but cannot justify its price tag, that difference in value offered to the diner should be acknowledged (as at, for two of many examples of such step-down, Brushstroke or Gramercy Tavern). There was no dish that indicated any high level of care, advance planning, or creativity for a vegetarian diner. The number of courses that were simply some vegetables cooked in a standard sauce was astonishing and disappointing. It was truly an afterthought of an offering (which, again, at both of my earlier examples, it never is; or to take a different example, at, say, Le Bernardin, which does not even *offer* a vegetarian tasting menu, when I found myself there with some colleagues at the last minute, was served a truly superb, creative, wow-factor 8-course meal. Remember, that too at a restaurant with no advance notice and that doesn't print any such offering on its menu.).Finally, moving on to the beverage pairing, it was a very neat idea, a very fair value, generally good, and (at least for the primary tasting menu) well-executed in its variety. For the vegetarian, yet again, it felt a bit repetitive -- I think I had 7 white wines last night. Not a big deal, but again, felt a bit half-baked or less than fully thought out. Still, if you go, get the beverage pairing. It's worthwhile, creative, and feels fresh in concept.In summary, the big idea is fine here, but the execution was just off in so many ways (the disconnects on service, the menu design and protracted plodding pacing, etc., etc.), that I find that I cannot recommend this restaurant. At the price point (of well over $100 per person), there are just so many better options. It's not quite in the same league as the rest.",0,0,0,Joe S.,"Plano, TX",6,147,5

Now let's get to the good stuff (or in this case, meh-stuff) because no one goes to a restaurant just for the ambiance. I roll in 4 deep with a few old marketing colleagues, in between spending the whole brunch talking about social marketing (we're a lively bunch) we order some food and drinks.I order what they call a ""bloody maria,"" a drink made with green pepper, green tomato, jalapeno, parsley and cilantro. It was simultaneously a beautiful drink and a delicious drink--there's a ridic. bloody mary bar where you can stuff it chock full of shrimp, eggs, pickled this-n-thats, bacon, horseradish, and what-have-nots.

5.0,7/16/2016,"Unexpectedly came here after we walked around in the hot New York summer evening and every other restaurant had a two hour wait. What a delightful surprise this was!This restaurant reminded me of blue hill which we visited two weekends ago. Everything was very fresh and had a farm to table feel. I think I liked Kingsley a tad more because of the interesting mix of flavors and I loved the airy space with tall ceilings. Our waitress was also incredibly nice and welcoming. I love the small plates for sharing so you can try a lot of the menu. We started with the bone marrow with tuna crudo, fava beans, and charred octopus. All amazing, especially the bone marrow which also has these crispy rice bits on it for texture. Highly recommend all three. Then we shared the mushroom noodles (think long flat rice noodles like pad see ew) and spot pork. The mushroom noodles were good but not mind blowing; I appreciated that the flavors of the mushrooms were very strong but the noodles themselves were just ok. Then the spot pork...YUM! This small dish had a sampling of many parts of the pig, from the cheek to bacon to the fried crackling. The meat was perfectly tender and the different parts added a cool texture. Neat find in our neighborhood!",0,0,0,Joyce H.,"New York, NY",468,553,272
3.0,7/11/2016,"Went to Kingsley for a friends birthday this past weekend. They tried to charge us $10 per a person for a plating fee for the cake... RIDICULOUS... but we were able to negotiate it down to a flat rate of $50. Just as a precaution.. do cake elsewhere.5 stars for service. Our waitress was very engaging and accommodating to our large group. We had the section in the back of the restaurant for our party of 13.2 stars for food. The food on the other hand was disappointing. Got the charred octopus. It was okay, but the pine nut butter was so salty... i couldn't eat it.The highlight was the bone marrow. It comes with a sherry shot. The waitress got all of us to slide the shot down the bone shaft into our mouths. A ""classier"" funnel i guess. hahaI got the salmon entree. OMG...was it FISHY. I DEFINITELY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. it was borderline disgusting and probably could have gotten better salmon at Applebees or TGIFridays. EW.Friends next to me got the hen. They also mentioned that it was sooo salty.My boyfriend got the steak. It was cooked well but once again the crust was a tad bit salty. Chef needs to realize there are other ways to season food besides salt.Also, the food came out extremely slow. I'm not sure if our party of 13 was overwhelming for the restaurant...We ended up spending about $135 per a person. Bottomline : go eat somewhere else.",1,3,0,Sha P.,"Manhattan, NY",9,67,101

I had the ricotta salad, perfect light salad- tangy with fresh ricotta- to start. Then, the main dish you must have: the Wagyu beef, perfectly seasoned, buttery, juicy piece of meat. Ask about where the meat comes from- an excellent purveyor! Finished with the Popcorn Creme Brulee... A deconstructed creme brulee with a buttery taste. It stays intact without the ramekin through the chef's gastronomy techniques. (The owner came out and described the food with such passion- very impressive!)

My fiancé and I ordered a dish with a poached egg, bacon, and poached egg which was $14 and it was actually 4 bites. Extremely over priced for tiny dishes. We actually went to anther restaurant after we left (78$ bill for 2 brunches 2 drinks and 1 fried ricotta dish!!) They just need more balance. The service was amazing, the decor is unforgettable however, I dine out for dishes that I cannot/will not make and delicious food. 1 tiny poached egg on a shallow bowl of frisée 4 chunks of bacon and 1 slice of French bread is not worth $14.

4.0,5/10/2016,"A great new(ish) place in alphabet city.  As soon as you walk in, you know this is a more grown-up and sophisticated place than many other places in this area.  The bar has cushy comfortable stools that let you relax and enjoy their serious cocktails.  Many of their signature cocktails looked great.  The bartender, clearly experienced and knowledgeable, was happy to make different versions of classic cocktails we requested and even made nice suggestions to use other brands of sprits to taste the difference.  We love it when they get nerdy about spirits.The food was also great.  Charred octopus (though slightly too burnt) and guinea hen were so delicious.  Others at my table had bone marrow, fava beans, pork, and wagyu; and said they were all very good.  Yuzu curd and citrus were yummy.  So overall, we were very happy with the food and wine.  One thing that confused me is that they have 4-5 sakes on the drink list, along with some japanese style dishes.  (I didn't order those as I have a preference for more traditional food when it comes to Japanese food and drinks.)The negative for that night was the service.  S L O W.  We sat down close to 9pm, so the place suddenly got full.  But we waited for a long time for our wines by the glass (not cocktails).  And after we ordered, there was a longer wait before this little starter (complimentary) and another period of wait durations before our appetizers and entrees were brought.  No one cleared our starter plates; so when appetizers were brought, there was no room.  I'd probably go back for an earlier dining time to avoid the same slowness :-)",0,0,0,Harue J.,"Manhattan, NY",14,272,32
5.0,5/8/2016,"Wow, what a place!I must confess, I had a hard time here, mainly because the chef made it so difficult to make a choice!  We began at the bar, choosing from a wide variety of available cocktails and liqueurs.  My wife described roughly a drink she had; the bartender did an amazing job to recreate (pear liqueur, St Germaine, vodka and a splash of Champagne).  Not only did she make it, but the word spread to others - ask for the Lisa and they may make you one!  Other top shelf liquors, including Redbreast and Monkey 47, were available.The starters and miss were all amazing, making it so so difficult to choose! Dining with my wife and another couple, we chose several off the list - octopus, morels (to die for!), fava beans -only to call our waiter back to place a second order of starters.  Moving to our mains, we found that the chef has a strong believe in sustainability and local ingredients.  The menu was all sourced with the greater NY region, exceptionally fresh and flavorful. We chose the spot pork, wagu beef, and the spring lamb, though we begrudgingly passed up the highly recommended Halibut.  The pork was unlike any other I have had, flavor, moist and exceptionally tender.  All my dinner mates made similar comments on their dishes, as the forks flew back and forth between us sharing each others dinner. Desert moved to cheesecake and popcorn creme brûlée (yes, popcorn), presented in a deconstructed manner that provided a surprising burst of flavor.Unlike many places that now try to overwhelm with quantity and standard fares, the chef focuses on quality and a tight delivery of what she wants to share with you. The owners were there that night as well, adding to the energy. The combination of the Chef, the owners and their combined approach to make this a memorable place, one that is presented for you, not as a ""fast food"", output driven restaurants we see popping up all over the city.  Best of all, this is a place you can call ""your"" restaurant.  It may sound like a cliche, but the environment, the friendly atmosphere, and the cozy confines, makes it feel like your neighborhood place to meet and eat. We never felt rushed, we felt as if we were dining with friends and had been going there forever.  Just a note - if you can only go for a drink or two, check out the bar menu - wonderful!While there are always places to go to across the city, this will become our go to place, one we take close family and friends to share in the same experiences we had.  Go there, experience what we did - I think you'll be as satisfied as we were.Can't wait to return!",0,0,0,Jeffrey D.,"South Dennis, MA",1,19,0

2.0,4/8/2016,"Just okay. I left wishing that Back Forty was still there.  We were served a delicious pork belly amuse bouche soon after we were seated. The cocktails were good and generous with the alcohol. To start, we had the foie gras and ricotta. The portions were small but tasty, though a bit awkwardly presented.  For the mains we had the scallops and the wagyu beef. The scallops were huge, a bit bland, and they only served three. The beef was salty (and I love salt), a bit tough, and the cut made cooking it evenly an apparent challenge. It was to be served medium rare and it averaged that but parts were way too rare and too well done. The dessert made me laugh. We ordered popcorn creme brûlée and I was incredibly turned off by the presentation. It tasted okay but it made no sense visually or when eating it - it was a garbage plate of extremely small portions (a few kernels of popcorn, some crushed graham cracker, some creme brûlée, some ice cream). Servers were very friendly but the coordination of service for a place that is positioned as high end missed the mark.",1,0,0,K M.,"Manhattan, NY",139,11,0

With Kingsley it is a very different story. The dishes are totally imaginative, original, complex and delicious. We have dined there several times with superb results. Some highlights are the charred smoky greens, which are an original and delicious taste. The charred octopus which was the best I have ever had,succulent, meaty and yet crisp, the razor clams, the duck and even the little amuse bouche offered before the dinner. Several times they used Buddha's hand a lemon with many small fingers and combined disks of translucent tiny lemon rounds in their sauces.

2.0,2/21/2016,"Was excited to dine here last night to try the chefs tasting menu with wine pairing. Overall experience of the food, the service, and ambiance was 3stars at best. Tasting is made with regular menu items so nothing special. They included the amuse bouche as part of the 9 courses. Took over 3.5 hours to get through the meal because of slow service. The person delivering the plates didn't know how to describe it and so a second person came around to re-explain. The octopus was rubbery and smaller pieces were burnt. The wagyu dish was overly salted. The dessert was a blood orange sorbet with other citrus bits but left a bitter drying taste in your mouth. The wine pairing of a late harvest Riesling was better on its own than with the dessert. Restaurant has potential as the menu items read really well and the decor is simple and nice. But they should not offer a chefs tasting at this price if they are not able to service it properly. Perhaps better if you order a la carte.",2,0,0,Hannah K.,"New York, NY",0,1,0

The ambience is nice and not what you usually experience at restaurants in this neighborhood, super clean and not too noisy.

Very attentive service, cool vibe and they made a great Old Fashioned. Next we sat at the table and started with the muse which was a delicious parsnip soup I think. Then we moved on to some starters. I wouldn't usually order these items but I am definitely getting them next time I am there! The Fluke crudo, charred octopus, chawanmushi, and celeriac Agnolotti were all out of this world! I had the Chicken Thigh Napoleon as my main dish and there was nothing left on the plate afterwards, which is rare after having so many starters.

5.0,12/9/2015,"Try walking by the huge front windows of Kingsley and not feel the overwhelming curiosity to step foot inside.  The environment screams of good taste as feelings of warmth and intrigue begin to take over while Toots serenades you in the background.  As I walk in, I am greeted by numerous friendly staff and escorted to a beautifully lit bar with many exotic choices to peruse.  Another thing that instantly grabs my attention is the couple sitting next to me that is using a bone marrow as a funnel.  Yes you read correctly, a funnel.  After bartender consultation, I learn that the dish is complimented with a sherry shot to wash down the remainder of the goodness....  Brilliant!  Needless to say, that was my first course!Before getting to the food (wait for it), the cocktails are nothing shy of passionately created masterpieces.  The utilization of flavor is astounding and the bartender's skill in presentation made me wonder why the hell I haven't been treated this way from age 21.  I thoroughly enjoyed the two cocktails that I couldn't help but annihilate.  I'd be lying to you if I said I wasn't going to try all the drinks on the menu at some point soon.So you've read all this so far waiting to hear about the food, right?  Well here it is.  The menu is thoughtfully arranged in three segments depending on just how big you want to go...  I'd go big here because life's just too short not to.  Each segment gets slightly larger to accommodate just how hungry your hippo may, or may not be. As mentioned earlier, I started with the bone marrow after the demonstration my neighbors put on for me.  BY FAR the most ridiculously delicious marrow I've ever had.  If you're more of the conservative type, this is your chance to bust down the boring door and step into a world of awesomeness....  Or don't and they'll be more for me.  Other enticing first courses included grilled octopus and fluke crudo.Second course was chef's agnolotti.  If you're a foie gras fan, then please do this...  The little mesquite cake that it comes with is the only way I ever want to eat foie gras moving forward.Deciding your third course is like watching your kid try and decide which puppy he wants at the pet shop.  After a lot of tears and anxiety, I went with the beef......  The experience was nothing short of life changing.  Cooked perfectly, melted in your mouth and the potatoes....  The potatoes......  Ok, it's one thing to smoke your mash potatoes, but then you have to go ahead and make them the consistency or whip cream?  Have you ever seen a grown man lick his plate?  This dish never makes me want to attempt to cook a steak again.  Thanks Chef Roxanne Spruance! YOU WIN!Bottom line:  If you're tirelessly searching for a truly unforgettable meal that will send you home with a happy tummy, wallet and significant other...  Kingsley is the answer my friends.  Be apart of the know from the get go!!",2,1,0,Rich B.,"Newport, RI",0,1,0
