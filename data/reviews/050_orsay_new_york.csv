3.0,3/30/2019,"Dined at Orsay this evening.  This was my third visit to this restaurant. We had an Opentable reservation and were seated, for some reason, in the bar area. You would think with an Opentable reservation we would have preferential seating but the table was large. Our server was excellent so we had no problems with the service at all. Our water glasses were refilled, coffee refills were offered, bread refills were offered. The service was fine. We ordered the Artichoke vinaigrette and Tuna Tartare. The Tuna was excellent. The Artichoke arrived boiling hot. Both the artichoke and the vinaigrette which was in the middle of the artichoke were both extremely hot. I've had this dish numerous times in restaurants throughout the world and this is the first time I've ever encountered this dish to be boiling hot. This dish was completely ruined by serving it at the temperature it was served at. Our entrees were the Salmon and the Monkfish. I ordered the Salmon medium rare and it was cooked properly. But the dish was oily and the accompanying mushrooms were just OK. The Monkfish was excellent. Dessert was the chocolate mousse. The restaurant made a huge deal in the serving of this dish, serving the chocolate out of a large pot then adding creame anglaise and other things. The result was a mushy mess that wasn't enjoyable. Prices seemed excessively high as well, given the quality of the food and $20 for a mixed drink is ridiculous.",0,0,0,Bob G.,"JAMAICA, NY",17,213,400

One of the most consistent restaurants I've been to in the city; we always know we will have a lovely meal.  Service is wonderful. Super cute place.

5.0,3/11/2019,Love the atmosphere. Came for brunch on a Saturday. The eggs Benedict and croquette madame were yummy.

3.0,2/7/2019,"It is a cute, albeit at times stuffy, French bistro on the Upper East Side. I came here for their Sunday brunch. Apparently, they have a delicious Prime rib breakfast. It seemed a bit aggressive for me for breakfast, although my friend who ordered it thought it was solidly prepared -- no frills, or bells and whistles, but very solid prime rib. I opted instead for the Croque Madame. It was insanely rich and heavy: a thick layer of cheese, on a thick layer of toast, with a thick layer of hollandaise sauce slathered on... I think I might have enjoyed it more if I only had half of the sandwich... We did order a side of fries for the table that was quite good!",3,0,1,Michelle W.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",109,656,110
2.0,2/6/2019,"Service was incredible but the food was not...  the meat was chewy and not edible (for both my husband and myself).  The greens were pathetic and they skimped on the fries. The manhattan was watered down (I'm a bartender so I know what a crappy Manhattan is).  We didn't complain because we aren't monsters, but we definitely won't be back.  It seems like most of the clientele may not have tastebuds anymore (the average age was 80).",0,0,0,Laila J.,"New York, NY",3,14,0
2.0,2/3/2019,"The restaurant is beautifully decorated, but last night's meal was too salty and the sauces were too heavy. I will not be back. I ordered the skate fish off the menu and the tuna tartare. I didn't like the sauce on the tartare as it was just too heavy and overpowered the fish--a light sauce with very fresh fish is the best kind of tartare for me. The skate fish was lightly fried with a butter sauce which I also found heavy, but the main problem with this dish was it was overly salted. Overly salty food is a deal killer at a restaurant for me. It ruins the dish and all you can taste is salt. Properly seasoning a dish with the correct amount of salt is a pretty basic culinary skill and overly salty food at this price point is just not acceptable. Also, light layering of flavors is not possible with heavy sauces and the protein in the dish is just swamped in sauce.  Furthermore, the bread they offered was not good. It was crusty on the outside, but doughy on the inside. Come on, this is a french restaurant just serve baguette instead of that doughy mess.",0,0,0,A J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,101,0

3.0,1/10/2019,Came here on a whim with my family for a late lunch after we were at the Met... it definitely wasn't our first choice but it was pouring rain so we just really needed to get indoors. We were greeted as they took our coats which was nice. The service was a bit rushed and the menu itself was very limited in my opinion. We all ended up just having french onion soup and some apps plus beer and it was $200! In my opinion that is ridiculous for some appetizers...

5.0,1/2/2019,"My boyfriend and I came here for NYE dinner and Orsay did not disappoint. We both got the pre-fixe menu, starting with a hamachi tartare cucumber cup and a mini puff filled with truffle cheese. I didn't think the meal could get better, but it did. I got the house smoked salmon that had a vinegar-y flavor to it and was delicious. Steven got the lobster with puff-pastry that was so rich and decadent. He got the veal loin and I got the halibut, both fantastic. And the dessert of trio of chocolates was amazing. The middle meringue was the best, with dulce de leche and chocolate sauce to scrape up. The whole meal was amazing, and the service was fantastic. My only complaint was they brought out our first appetizer when we weren't done with our mini pre-appetizer. We knew they were trying to get people in and out, but we said we wanted to take our time and they were fine either that. We've been three times now and we will be back!!",2,0,0,Paige H.,"New York, NY",17,203,17
3.0,12/16/2018,"We stopped in for a quick late lunch, there were very few customers and we were seated and waited on quickly. We started with a cocktail, which were delicious. Since only the lunch menu was available with very few choices, we asked our server for a recommendation. She claimed that the burger was the best she's had, at $26 I expected an amazing meal, I was very disappointed. I do not understand why restaurants ask their patrons ""how would like your burger cooked?"" when they always serve it well done. With that said, I was disappointed to see a well done burger when I ordered a medium rare burger. The ambiance is pleasant, the bathroom was clean and the staff were nice. The bottom line is that I probably won't return nor can I recommend the restaurant. The bar is worth a shot.",1,0,0,Robb C.,"Golden, CO",57,195,91

We had gone to the restaurant a few months prior and were blown away by the food and overall experience. Needless to say, the food at our rehearsal dinner was beyond extraordinary (don't get me started on the incredible wine selection) and the service was top notch.

2.0,10/7/2018,"Dinner at 7pm Friday night.  ARTICHAUD VINAIGRETTE was dry and lacking in flavor.  It was like they had cooked it days before.  I know you have to make it in advance, but it should be made the same day.  The roast chicken (POULET RÔTI ""TOUT SIMPLEMENT) was dry and tasteless and came with limp and greasy fries.  The roasted cod (FILET DE CABILLAUD ROTI) was not very flavorful (frozen?).  The waiter offered what seemed like a nice suggestion for a wine, but I was then told they were out of it; he suggested another, and then I was told they were out of that as well.  The third suggested bottle (a Mercurey) was nice. The bread (homemade whole wheat?) and butter were good.   I am perplexed as I thought this was owned by the owners of La Goulue.  Have the owners tried the food at Orsay?  They should.",0,0,0,frank s.,"New York, NY",21,66,1

5.0,8/26/2018,"We stopped in for Brunch yesterday. Living in the East 80s,we were not familiar with Orsay. The restaurant reminds me of an excellent French Bistro located not on a main Parisian Street, but tucked into the Neighborhood Streets where Locals are Patrons, not Tourists. The interiors of Orsay are a Gem from the Light Fixtures to the ""Old Looking Mirror"", all imported and purposely made to look old from France! The Bloody Mary and Martini were good! Our Eggs Benedict and Norwegian Eggs were EXCELLENT! Fabulous Hollandaise, so much better than the typical sauce served. The Bread Basket, lemon butter and preserves all excellent.

3.0,3/31/2018,"4 years ago, this restaurant would've gotten 5 stars. I used to be a regular here.. every option on the menu was incredibly delicious, but over the past year, the quality and presentation of their food plummeted, but the prices stayed the same. For example, their steak au poivre used to be fantastic, but then the meat became almost unbearable. I couldn't even get through half of it.  Maybe due to budget cuts or a new chef, they went from refined to disappointing. Now the menu's items are a minefield with some great options and some awful ones. So here's a guide to avoid a disappointing meal: Only order the tuna tartare, French onion soup, the escargot, the saladé frisée, or foie gras. NOTICE that these are all appetizers; it's because every entree isn't worth spending $30-$40 on, except the Ribeye special on Wednesday.

3.0,1/25/2018,Orsay is a perfectly okay restaurant. It is one of the nicer places to eat in the neighborhood.

For an appetizer each of my coworkers and I got a jumbo shrimp which was served with a side of two sauces: one was a red hot sauce sort of thing, and the other one was orange and thick, I'm not even sure what it was but it was very good and the shrimp was fresh and had a great texture. I ended up getting the salmon tartare and potato tartine (I can't remember the exact name) as my meal. It was the potato tartine as a base, layered with crem fresh, salmon tartar, fresh greens, chopped cucumber, and capers. Very good, the salmon tasted very fresh and had a great texture. I just wish there was a little more added flavor to the dish but did appreciate the plate. For dessert the table split some sort of mini ice cream sandwich type thing which was good but the bread that was used was kind of tough. I wish it had been softer t would've been easier to eat.

I was staying in Midtown but I took a cab up there to the upper West side in big traffic just to go there. Well everything on their menu was pre made and all most had something I was allergic to in them. The only thing they could offer me was plain fish or chicken (no sauce and no starch). Yes on the spinach. I ordered the chicken and it was worse than a whole foods chicken that had been in the roaster all day.

I find out later they have an in between times menu that you can order from. Food was meh. I ordered from the crudités tray table. Which is virtually a salad bar on wheels. Seems like a good idea, but portions are small for the price. The highlight was the floating island dessert that I ordered. It was the only thing I enjoyed about this place.

We went to Orsay thinking we had good experience there in the past so this was a great opportunity to try their brunch. The host put us in a lovely table by the window and made it easy for us to park the stroller close to my wife.About 15 minutes later the Maître came to say we could not park our stroller there because there was no space for the table next to us (there was plenty of space!!), we moved the stroller farther from my wife in order to give the other table (which was not even seated) more space.He kept complaining though that we would need to move since there was a risk of one of the attendants bumping into the stroller and harming the baby (again, there was plenty of space). It was clear by then that he wanted to move us to another table to make that available to another customer that did not have a stroller!!I initially resisted saying we were staying and that the host had put us there and that there was plenty of space. He then said that if I did not have any concerns for the security of my baby, he did. So he would have to call on a witness so that I could say that I did not care for the security of my baby and that they would not be liable if anything happened to my baby.At that point we were already so upset that we decided to leave half way through our order.

I especially liked the sauce because the mustard did not overpower (these nuances always matter!).  My guests also loved the cod as was seen by their empty plates and positive reviews.For dessert, we had chocolate mousse, baba au rhum, and profiteroles drizzled with chocolate sauce. The birthday guests blew out their candles and we all shared these really delightful sweets as the wonderful end to this evening.I would be remiss not to mention the excellent wine selection, which enhanced the dining experience tremendously. We went with Bordeaux and a Sancerre Pinot Noir, both absolutely lovely.Every single one of us raved about the food on the ride home and I was so pleased.  Picking Orsay for this special evening was one of the best decisions I've made this year thus far.  In fact, the birthday guests were so pleasantly surprised they plan on coming back soon.  I do have to say again that the foie gras was REALLY good.  Thank you Orsay for excellent food, service, and an overall dining experience.",1,0,1,Ro T.,"Manhattan, NY",1,17,1

Tonight I found myself at Orsay; I don't eat French food too often so I was excited to see what they had to offer. The restaurant itself was pretty roomy - the main floor was busy and kind of loud, but overall the atmosphere was nice. They had that bistro look going but the decor also had echoes of upscale with dark woods and high-end details. They have a sun room on the side of the restaurant which I imagine would be very nice place to sit in nice weather. We were seated upstairs - the upscale decor continued up here with mainly dark wood/brown tones and low lighting - very nice. We were started with bread - sourdough mmmmm, it was nice and soft. We were then served the Orsay salad which contained field greens and Julienned vegetables dressed in a white truffle vinaigrette and parmesan shavings. The salad was good, the dressing wasn't too overpowering and the Julienned vegetables added a unique spin to it. For my main I had the roasted chicken which was served on the bone with mashed potatoes and broccoli rabe. The chicken was good - a healthy portion and very tender. While the mashed potatoes were average, the broccoli rabe was good - they kept some of that bitter quality to it which I like. For dessert we were served individual bread puddings which had apricot and chocolate in it, served with a vanilla sauce - very tasty. Overall, for a CE dinner Orsay put out a good meal. While I can't attest to how French the food was, I enjoyed what I had and wouldn't be against returning.",10,4,9,Jason M.,"Bronx, NY",474,719,3173

2.0,9/25/2016,"Cheesy has won. To give some context, I proposed to my wife at Orsay (some years ago) and have had a wonderful marriage since. Orsay, I humbly thank you for that and the champagne.Back then, the chef would invite us to private dinners with wonderful pigeon appetizer and experimentation was accepted. Back then, the owner would walk the room and make sure people were happy.  And all of this was on top of the always superb French country menu with which I was accustomed to growing up in both Leon and NYC. What separated Orsay from other French NYC was the extra care and inclusiveness of its staff.  The rub of elbows with its excellent bartenders and wait staff as both sides would lose their native languages for seconds; the inside talk and banter which could go on for long minutes and no one would complain. Orsay was (at its grand height) the French impressionistic envy of all those hipper BS French ""bistro"" (even those shoddy downtowners, I'm looking at you Savoy and Lucky Strike!), because it really was a wonderful, open-air French painting. If it was the 70s like the Jagger-favorite La Bourgogne on 72nd, you could bring your poodle to a booth and drink with the staff. (sigh for 70s passing)Alas, Orsay has become an assembly line of bad microwaveable strip steak, suburban salad entrées, thrown-on-your-plate frites, all too greasy-escargot, culminating with a ""throw the dessert menu at these folk"" service that we sadly have come to expect. (Full disclosure: the tarts are terrific still and the oysters still excellent, though dopey Eats burger joint next door is giving them a run for their money). As a one-time lover of Orsay who has lived on the UES all my life and knew the restaurants that have come before them in that same space, I will offer some humble admissions: it ""delivers"", but that should be an insult to a thinking French artesian that offers a glimmer of Paris' true past. Orsay needs to shine like it did years ago. With the wonderful food, staff, and management that made it what it is. The space is still mind-blowing. The restaurant, not.Presently, Orsay has succumbed to every worn, tiring owner/chef establishment. It is now a Citi Bank on the corner, ready to take your money and spit food at you with the receipt. The service, while good with water and bread, is non-existent and charmless.I don't write this review to scold or antagonize. Orsay, despite the outrageous rent it probably has to pay, will always do well with tourists and some locals. I just wish and hope it will find its true soul again.  This is a wake up call, Orsay!

3.0,5/5/2016,"A welcoming oasis on mid-70s Lex - but expensive for the quality of the food and drinkMy wife and I attended the opening of this year's Costume Exhibit at the Met and were faced with the usual problem of what to do for lunch by the Met. In the mood for a nice-ish lunch, we decided on Orsay.The atmosphere is lovely in a classic French bistro kind of way and the service was delightful. But the food was just...good. The Orsay Salad was tasty and impeccably dressed but the tomatoes were off. The West Coast oysters were insufficiently briny and were the smallest oysters I've been served in a restaurant since....well ever. We were sold on getting two cheese souffles because of their small size but they turned out to be enormous. But the real problem was the cheese Orsay used was rather flavorless - the souffles lacked the piquancy and aroma you get in an actual French bistro. On the other hand our desserts - a Paris-Brest hazelnut almond-y thing and a orange creme brulee were both stupendous.Another disappointment was the wine. We tried both a white Burgundy and a Chablis. The Burgundy was rather awful and the Chablis was OK - but neither were worth the price. Which brings us to the real downside of Orsay...lunch ended up over $200 for the two of us. And when I think of the other French bistro lunches we've enjoyed (or of the other $100/person NYC lunches) the prices were way out of line for the quality of the food and drink.",0,0,2,Leo M.,"New York, NY",0,476,8

3.0,3/10/2016,"Orsay is a semi-secluded Upper East Side French brasserie that serves hit-or-miss French inspired American food. I came with some co workers on a Tuesday evening. We had charcuterie, gougeres, crab cake, hanger steak with sauteed mushrooms, macarons, and chocolate ganache cake. The cheese platter had 4 different varieties of hard and spreadable cheeses. The blue cheese and brie were soft, non pungent and perfect with the toasted crunchy bread. The gougeres were light airy cheese puffs with a hint of truffle inside. Delicious. I wanted to eat a third or fourth one!The crab cake was standard fare but the green apple salad with horseradish was unpalatable. The salad was sour and tasted like a spicy sour bitter sauerkraut. Yech!The well-crusted seasoned hanger steak was disappointing. Half of the steak was cooked medium rare and the other half was medium well and tough to cut.  I wish we had a steak knife. The buttery sage-sprinkled mushrooms were perfect. I finished my plate and considered asking for more mushrooms.The potatoes au gratin was perfect! Creamy rosemary and truffle flavors with a crisp top layer. I wanted to bring some home to my husband but I ate all of the top layer already.I didn't get to try the macaron, but I had the cannele de bordeaux. Orsay's version was slightly sweet, airy sponge cake but lacked the caramelized crust. And the chocolate ganache was rich, very sweet.

I have to give them their dues because it was excellent. I decided to start with the foie gras and the duck a l'orange for the entree. After a short wait the foie gras arrived. It was probably one if the best I have ever had. Absolutely perfect. When the entree arrived I was very impressed. The presentation was very appealing and the smell was so intoxicating. Bite after bite was sensational, its no doubt that they are known for this dish.I selected the creme brulee which took a little time but it was well Worth the wait.

The architecture & ambiance reminded me of Rick's bar in Casablanca. I was warmly greeted by Joey, the delightful woman behind the very well stocked bar. If you enjoy Highland Scotches, such as Glenmorangie , you have found your home. The bar itself is made of hammered metal, surrounded by beautiful dark wood, accented with antiqued mirrors and lighting reminiscent of days gone by. Joey, brought me a delicious sampling of fromages, raisins still on the stem & an excellent glass of  Sauvignon Blanc. We shared conversation along with history of the restaurant, as well as eateries in the neighborhood. I was so impressed, that when my companion arrived, We cancelled our previous reservations & decided to try the fare at Orsay. We weren't disappointed. Our luncheon of burgers on brioche were grilled to perfection. The pomme frites were crisp without the usual oily taste and the Grand Mariner creme bruelle  was most satisfying. So 2 thumbs up to Joey & we will be back to savor the Scotch over dinner soon",0,0,0,Sam T.,"Nanuet, NY",23,31,86
4.0,8/7/2015,"I went here for restaurant week and it was an amazing experience. Both the maitre'd and one of the waiters were French speaking. The ambiance was very calm and relaxing.  On the Prix Fix menu I tried the gespacho, stripped bass, duck breast, Petit pot panna cotta, and the Orsay Profiteroles. Forewarning, I'm going to sound very picky, but remember that this is a high-end restaurant. The gespacho was delicious. Unfortunately, they brought while I was away from the table and my friend that was sitting thee received hers as well, but they offered fresh pepper to her and by the time I got back no offer was made to me, I had to request it. Would've been nice if they came over themselves. Also, the waiter from whom I asked for freshly cracked pepper (who was clearly of to be of Latin-American decent, since he was speaking Spanish to some of the other waiters) explicitly said that it was his first time using a pepper mill. Are you kidding me?!The Stripped Bass was delicious, but it was stacked two pieces on top of each other. The top piece practically melted in my mouth. The bottom piece, which was sandwiched between the top one and a bed of risotto, felt a bit over cooked. The duck breast was well prepared and tender. The flavoring however was a bit on the bland side. It came with a very tart cherry reduction, but there was no contrast. Meaning there was no salty or sweet flavor. True, I could have added salt, but I'm not one to add anything to a dish after it's prepared, unless it's just tasteless, which this dish was not. It was full of flavor and I enjoyed it anyway. The desserts were delicious! The best part was when they brought the profiteroles to the table. I was thrown into a flashback of being in Paris at a local restaurant off of the Champs-Elysees. Granted, the pastry was not as delicate, but who cares! It still tasted great!If you can score to get here during restaurant week, at least, go for it!",0,0,0,Zack M.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,71,149

3.0,3/3/2015,"We came in to dine and book for my Bridal Shower. One thing that I would like to address with  is who will be available from the restaurant the day of my event. Its a concern of my bridal party, unfortunately when we were there this past Saturday for brunch the maitre d on duty or the manager I'm not quite sure what his title was was not very accommodating. My bridal party would like to request that he not be involved in any way. Our waiter and wait staff were very nice, however the issue with the gentlemen  I mentioned was two-fold. Upon arrival I was told that I could not see the room because there was a meeting going on in the room. Then he returned a few minutes later to tell me they would be done with their meeting between 12:30 or  1 o'clock. Which turns out not to be the case. I did explain that I had emailed you and that I just didn't remember if I got a response. This is the missing email which I understand that it can happen.  My bridal party and I sat down for brunch and had quite a hard time getting some simple crudite. My bridesmaid who is arranging for and paying for this shower had her 4 year old son with her. As there were many other children that age in the restaurant at the time I didn't think it would be an issue. She requested some raw vegetables since her son does not eat many other things and that is what he requested. The waiter forgot about this and brought our meals before the child had anything to eat. After her having to get up and ask again they brought over a small cart with many different vegetables that were cooked and not cooked but all had some kind of dressing or seasoning on them. After asking for a third time the manager / maitre d came over. When she explained she just needed a few raw vegetables on a plate the manager said he didn't understand what she was asking for then said that he was extremely busy with all the reservations in the restaurant and pointed to the cart again and said that was available. I'm just having a hard time understanding how he could not understand what raw vegetables are given that you serve crudite in the restaurant and use these vegetables and some of the meals and at the bar. We couldn't enjoy our meal clearly with a four year old hungry watching us eat. She then had to go to the Dagastinos to get some tomatoes and celery which clearly you did have in the restaurant, Although clearly poor etiquette she had no choice. We had to remind them yet again that we were waiting to see the room upstairs when we were told the meeting wasn't over there simply on a break and that we need to go in one at a time and be quiet. So this is why we are requesting that the manager / maitre d that was on duty that day not be involved with the shower in anyway. Thank you.",0,0,0,Kimberly O.,"Brooklyn, NY",62,21,100

4.0,6/1/2014,"I went to Orsay on a Wednesday night after the Misses ""suggested"" I have dinner outside the confines of our 600 square foot apartment since she was reading legal case studies, as is her custom and occupation, and preferred to be left in the science of her own thoughts than the sound of me in the kitche. Her proclivity not being toward fish or French I had a craving for both. I decided to head to the upper east side and fine a new French spot. I passed Orsay and started to walk onward toward to see what else the evening might offer when I decided sometimes the first answer is the right one. I walked in to the bustling restaurant which was busy especially for a Wednesday wearing jeans and a orvis light weight wading jacket and inquired after a single table outside. The matred' looked at me and said he would see what they might find. After the customary survey of how far along various tables were and what reservations the restaurant had for that evening, and the week given the number or pages he cleaved, he decided the open two top I passed was indeed available even for an impromptu wayward looking patron. I ordered escargot, the test if any French restaurant; done poorly it's like eating an eraser cooked in garlic and dried parsley done well the little tender morsels make you want to drink the green butter like an espresso. The generous portion looked better than it tasted. Cooked perfectly the average sized snails had the bitter bite of raw unsauteed garlic. Garlic is a hallmark of the dish but has to be sautéed or roasted to avoid a lingering bitter bite. The well priced Sancerre I chose to pair with it was just right; right price, vintage, serving, and temperature. At restaurants new to me I always like to try as many different items as I can. As it was just me I decided to continue the wine by the glass and inquired after two reds with which I was unfamiliar the waiter gave a superior explanations without being verbose.  After the escargot I ordered the appetiser sized tuna and steak tartare and house salad to eat. The portions for both were just right. The tuna was like eating the inside of a great spicy tuna roll, an item of significance as it was what I made when first interviewed for my first job cooking in a kitchen. There was a green gastric across the plate that complimented the flavours of the tuna. I use a fair amour of green pepper and Dijon mustard when I make my beef tartare and usually add more mustard if I order out. In this case I did not have to. I would say it was one of the best beef tartares I have had. A nice amount of green onion a quail egg in a half shell on top and a consistent texture that was neither too corse or too fine. The simple house salad was, again, a good but not overwhelming portion of fresh mixed greens in a simple emulsified dressing. The service was attentive but never rushed. I was given a dessert menu and ordered a glass of Pernod which was served with ice and a small carafe of water on the side and a house made tart to bring home.",0,0,0,Christofer G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,38,1

3.0,3/18/2014,"GOOD, BUT OVERPRICED ... I passed by this place several times and it always caught my eye, finally I payed a visit this past Sunday. It does a really good job of looking genuinely French inside and out ... even down to the fonts they use and the French wait staff. I really liked the setting, it felt comfortable and relaxed while maintaining a classiness. The brunch menu offered a nice range of items, all standards of sorts that were appealingly predictable with a couple of unique offerings. I choose Steak Frites as the main and smoked salmon as the starter. Both items were very good quality, perfectly prepared and presented simply and well timed. It's not really fair to judge a restaurant on a brunch experience, but based on the quality of the food and the good execution I think its safe to say that I understand the place and its good, quite good. If the rating of a restaurant was based solely on the quality of food I would rate this as a 4 star (out of 5), but when I consider the cost of items, the overall experience and the other options out there in the city, I think Orsay is over-priced. A very similar experience can be had at several other French restaurants in the city as lower price but comparable quality of items.  The clientele was a certain demographic which I also found a little off-putting.

Once the wait staff actually noticed us (about 10 minutes) we got very nice, attentive service.Grilled sardine salad was wonderful.  But the bouillabaisse only mediocre. The stock lacked depth and, more annoyingly, the lion's share of the ingredients was fennel (which was all over the menu that night) and potatoes. At $34 per modestly sized bowl, I want more fish in my bouillabaisse than I do tubers. I'm all for restaurants turning a profit but please don't insult me.

2.0,12/25/2012,"I'm a posting this a bit late but my review was written right after I had eaten here: I've tried several restaurants in the city but this was one of the worst places I have eaten at in quite a while. ?This review is in regards to the restaurant week menu. The menu provided had a lot more potential and seemed a lot less generic than other places I had been to (e.g. the standard Beet salad with Goat Cheese appetizer). In hindsight, I would have preferred any of those restaurants over Orsay because their food was still decent. I would like to comment that the service was fantastic and probably the most redeeming aspect of my experience. The meal started off well.  I ordered the chicken liver salad which was actually pretty good, the smell of liver was quite strong and the liver was tender, not rubbery. I could taste the faint flavor of the bacon which meshed together well with the arugula. I also ordered a cocktail, the Maxine which was a wonderful balance of gin and sweet lime juice. The rest of the meal was a gross disappointment though. I ordered the pork sausage with caramelized apples and mashed potatoes. The sausage was overly soft and neglect of any flavor except for salt. There were no spices and the sausage tasted more like a hotdog with fodder filling. The caramelized apples and mashed potatoes were utterly bland. My boyfriend had the beef brisket in red wine sauce and homemade pasta. Sounds delicious doesn't it? The beef was fatty but not the kind that melts in your mouth. The sauce tasted watered down just like the Cabernet Savignon that my boyfriend was drinking. I love homemade pasta and would pay considerably to eat a good plate of it. However, the pasta had a strong floury odor and was also lacking any flavor. I  had been waiting all night for the churros, which was the biggest let down. The churros smelled like they had been fried in old oil. It was crispy but not soft inside and had absolutely no flavor. I tried to dip them in the chocolate orange glaze but they still tasted like crispy, oil logs. I tasted the glaze and , no exaggeration, it was like diluted cocoa mix with a slight hint of orange. I could not eat it. I would not recommend this place for Restaurant Week.",2,0,0,Jen L.,"East Brunswick, NJ",73,27,3

Anyway, we arrived here today, on Sunday, at 3:29pm and they said they weren't serving brunch anymore. I asked when they stopped and they said at 3:30pm.

This is a pricey Upper East Side French bistro that becomes even more pricey when you consider the absence of high quality food and inconsistent service. We've been here three times now, and that's a strikeout.  Overcooked fish served with lukewarm, vinegary sauce. And no, it was not intended to be vinegary. French fries that fizzle. And served lukewarm. A steak that was dry. And lukewarm. Is there a guy in the kitchen named Luke Warm?? We could go on, but honestly the list grows dreary, mired in pretension and a mixture of tastes and textures that only vaguely hint at French. And, lest you think we are being difficult, please note that not everything was served lukewarm -- the ice tea came with ice cubes intact. We didn't find the food at our three times here worth nearly the price, nor were the drinks, which are similarly overpriced.

The waitstaff were nice enough very brisk, meals came out slowly but it was a busy night. the food was let's see I had the risotto I was surprislngly pleasantly happy with it, it was quite tasty, it was greenish because of the artichoke but it was actually flavorful, I was a bit skeptical at first because it's  French restaurant but it was  good. Couldn't say the same thing about the dry profiteroles. I think it would have a more romantic evening vibe if they dim the lights and put more candles, long tapered types for a more intimate feel especially on Valentine's and if they want to draw more couples in a. despite that you can tell it's a special occasion type restaurant if this isn't your usual fancy go-to place, you can come here when you celebrate something I liked the staircase, nice room upstairs looked like a fancy steakhouse upstairs, had a warmer feel upstairs. I must say I loved the decor I love the pillars /columns and the Art deco old-world feel about it. People were well-dressed and it enhanced the ambience, maybe they could try to attract a younger crowd though-don't know maybe with more candles and lighting, nice music. The ceilings are very high so makes it feel less intimate, charming lovely architecture and details, I must say--you  can't get this at the usual mediocre restaurants on the UES or Aunt Sally's diner. So, credit for that.

Other guests enjoyed their scallops or coq au vin if they ordered them, too. The frites at the table were an extra treat when waiting for a following course. What was so incredible about Orsay was its spectacular service. The bus boys, bartenders, waitresses and maitre'd all didn't miss a beat. The guest number grew from sixty to over ninety, but no one ever flinched. Any favor asked was met.

5.0,12/30/2011,"This place is our go-to French restaurant.  Sure, it's a little stuffy, a little precise, and a little over-priced...but that's just what you want a French restaurant to be.The food is very good, and very consistent -- the escargot is simply amazing, the bread is excellent, the salads are very well composed, and the entrees are great.  The desserts are similarly excellent.  The beer list is moderate, and over-priced -- but the wine selection is good and there are a lot of great selections to choose from.The service is good -- and, from what I've seen, quite experienced with placating very ""demanding"" Upper East Side ladies.  It can be a bit stuffy, but what do you want?  They're French.  (The only blip?  On one trip the description of the tarte du jour kept changing from blueberry to peach -- we couldn't get a straight answer.  But once it arrived it was quite good.  Unfortunately, it was also apple...  But that sort of thing seems rare.)The room is nice -- a little formal, but it makes you feel like you're having an elegant meal.  I dress up a little when I go.  The outdoor seating is great on a warm day.The crowd is probably my least favorite part of the place.  At night it can veer towards the ""I just did two lines in the bathroom"" Jersey-ite (with his ""I just did two dudes in the parking lot"" date).  During the day there are more of the ""I'd like the sauce on the side, and made without eggs, and the meat grilled well done, but still red in the center"" Upper East Side Fairway-dweller people.  Of the obnoxious conversations I've overheard in New York restaurants, this place has at least three of the top five.But on the other hand, if you're looking for entertainment during your dinner...All in all, this is one of my favorite places in New York.  It's a little too pricey to be a regular haunt, but we get out there whenever we feel like an interesting, delicious meal.",1,1,0,Robert J.,"New York, NY",1,65,0
1.0,12/14/2011,"Yesterday (12/13/11)  I meet with 3 friends at Orsay's for lunch, as it was our wont every 2-3 months.  Some of us often meet up there with others for dinners or for lunch.  Our reservation was for noon, this time a 'Holiday' meet.  We always sit at a table in the bar area since the din of the dining room is a little too loud for our liking to enjoy conversation. I ordered the prefix lunch, wanting fish.  I chose the salad, skate fish, followed with a desert.  My salad, quite good, arrived in a timely fashion. When I finished my salad, my friends orders where delivered.  My order, however did not,  I waited...and waited.  I asked our waiter 3 separate times 'Where is my food?'.  'It will be out right away.'  It didn't come. After a bit, I asked yet another waiter and was told the same..'right away'.  Still no food arrived.  Then the Maitre D'  came to our table & assured me it was coming out, momentarily.  I waited.  Still, no entree. I was trying to the attention of our waiter who I noticed was at the register at the Maitre D'  station.  While waiting for him to looked up, he sneezed...4 times...into his bare hand.  As he approached our area I got up from my seat, approached him, telling him, 'Before you touch my plate, wash your hands!'.  I told him this in a stern yet quiet tone. He apologized...'Yes, yes of course'.  One of my lunch mates summoned the Maitre D' as he passed our table letting him know they all had finished their meals & I had yet to receive mine. Again..'Oh, oh..it will be right out.'   I waited. Finally my plate was delivered..a rather small piece of skate fish wrapped around a small portion of sauteed spinach & a portion of mashed potatoes.  The spinach & the potato were fine however the skate fish was far too salty...inedible.  I asked to have it wrapped to 'doctor' it up a home. (I later disposed of the fish. which was irretrievable...'leaving a bad taste in mouth'  from my experience at lunch. I am not a desert person & suggested to my lunch mates we order 1 desert & 4 spoons.  I did request a cup of coffee along with our collective choice, chocolate mousse.  We didn't finish the mousse.  After few minutes a plate of assorted cookies arrived along with our check.  My meal was listed at it's full price not giving any consideration for the unpleasant mealtime I & my friends were subjected to.   As we left, one of my friends spoke to the Maitre D' of the less then enjoyable lunch experience we had...then being charged the full amount for my meal.  Adding insult to injury, his response?... 'Oh, I sent over a plate of cookies'.  Hello...4 people who did not finish one serving of desert are not interested in 'a plate of 'cookies'.   How would any experienced, knowledgeable host at any decent restaurant think this would be an appropriate apology to appease their customers for ruining what should have been a lovely afternoon.   We will never return to Orsay nor will we recommend it again.

3.0,10/21/2011,"We usually choose not to review a restaurant based only on brunch, particularly if their regular fare is quite different.  Around here there are plenty of Italian, Greek and other ethnic cuisine restaurants offering Sunday brunch menus filled with omelets, pancakes and other expected American favorites.  And that brings us to the question of how popular brunch is in other parts of the country?  Here in New York City it's practically required and all restaurants seem compelled to offer it.In Manhattan, Sunday brunch can be an impromptu, casual affair with patrons looking as if they just rolled out of bed (probably because they did).  But brunch can also be an event where well dressed diners meet friends and colleagues at establishments that require reservations.  Orsay is just such a place and we met an old friend there on a recent Sunday.Distinguished looking men in crisp shirts and blazers and elegant women in ruffled blouses filled the beautiful room and the noise level was deafening.  We asked for a seat on the terrace where it was more peaceful and we could converse without shouting.With so many people in this city, restaurants typically begin serving brunch around 11:00 and continue until well past 2:00 and even 3:00 pm.  At Orsay, we booked a 1:30 table and the crowd showed no sign of abating anytime soon.Brian and I are more typically in the casual and late brunch set.  Our Saturdays are likely to be busy as we tend to errands and chores we didn't have time for during the work week.  Typically it isn't until late afternoon that we mix up a batch of cocktails, ponder dinner reservations and settle into a slower pace.  And we tend to stay in relaxed mode from that point on...at least until Monday morning's alarm clock rings!To us, Sundays are for sleeping late and lazing around.  Even our pup is sound asleep at the foot of our bed at well past her normal hour.  At some point, of course, we'll rise and eventually drag ourselves out.  If the weather is lovely, we'll head to the park with the dog and then seek out an outdoor cafe for our late brunch.  In inclement weather we'll head to our favorite local diner with the big booths by the windows.But for our date at Orsay we put on our Sunday best and went to join the well-heeled upper east siders for French cuisine.  The service was good and the surroundings lovely. The brunch menu seems to stick closely to their normal menu although at a prix fixe of nearly $30 each, it was no bargain.  That included our choice of juice, bread, an appetizer and an entree but typical brunch refreshments such Bloody Mary's and Mimosas were nearly $10 extra.For appetizers we chose the goat cheese salad with frisee, mache, yellow beets and apples with a walnut vinaigrette.  We also had the house smoked salmon with watercress salad, creme fraiche, onions and capers.We found it interesting that the menu under-sells itself. The description for the goat cheese salad did not mention that the cheese is breaded and served warm.  And the description for the salmon left out the generous mound of crispy shoe string potatoes piled on top.  Both were lovely surprises but would have been selling features.  A classic cheese omelet with hash brown potatoes rounded out our meal.Apart from our normal preference to brunch casually and with a dog under our table, Orsay is a delightful, if pricey, experience...except for the noise.",1,0,0,Hungry Couple N.,"New York, NY",28,66,315

4.0,8/14/2011,"I met Jackie and Carlotta inside, at the restaurant's lengthy pewter-topped bar, shortly before 6pm.  And, while they chose to sip on warm cappuccino's, I ordered a glass of Bordeaux.     With 1/4 of the wine remaining in my glass, the three of us decided to be seated for dinner.  It was at this time that I was able to sit back, observe, and take-in the incredible interior beauty and detail that was surrounding me.  The first thing I noticed was the intricately-tiled, scallop patterned mosaic flooring, throughout.  Mahogany-wood walls, elaborate crown molding and arches, oversized antique-paned mirrors, Chantilly lace curtains, grand floral arrangements, and a mysterious marble staircase (leading to...the restrooms and an events space!) was a banquet in and of itself -  a feast for the eyes, in every sense of the phrase.Dinner was christened with a wedge of moist and crusty sourdough and spreadable butter.  Attentive servers routinely refilled low/empty bread plates throughout the course of the meal.Since Carlotta had to leave early (our girl had a date later that night), the three of us proceeded to order appetizers rather quickly after being seated.  For Jackie, it was the Baked Artichoke Gratine, with was accompanied by seasonal greens.  Carlotta went with the Homemade Ravioli, which was stuffed with fava beans and ricotta.  And I could not decide between the Burgundy Escargot and the Watermelon & Feta Salad, so I ordered them both!  ""Don't worry,"" the girls both said, ""we'll help you (eat).""     While most French restaurants air on the side of ""stingy"" with escargot, Orsay generously serves twelve plump pieces per order.  Although they were slightly overcooked, I couldn't help but eat every last meaty morsel or, shall I say, eleven of the twelve snails.  Since Jackie had never before sampled this delicacy, I insisted that tonight be the night.  ""They have a similar flavor to mushrooms, only the texture is more dense."" I explained.  ""Plus, how bad could anything taste dredged in garlic, parsley, butter, and bread crumbs?"" Unfortunately for Jackie, the ""dredging"" couldn't disguise the fact that she was, in fact, eating a snail/slug.  Secretly, I was thrilled with her displeasure because I didn't have to share another piece!    I was excited to see Watermelon & Feta Salad on the menu, as I plan to serve a similar rendition next week at ""wine club.""  Served atop a bed of spicy arugula greens, Nicoise olives, and bite-sized watermelon cubes were generous, interchanging slices of sweet, juicy 'melon and salty feta cheese.  The salad was finished with drizzled feta dressing. While I loved the contrasting flavors (sweet watermelon, salty feta, spicy arugula, sour olives), I found the abundance of feta cheese to be an overabundance.  Had each ""slice"" been halved or, better yet, crumbled, I don't think its pungency would have been so overwhelming.  After all, we're not talking about a caprese salad (mozzarella-based), here.  Feta is sharp, salty, and strong - a little goes a long way.  It was at this point in the meal when Carlotta announced that she needed to head on to her date.  After we wished her luck and bid her adieu, Jackie and I decided that, instead of each ordering our own, we'd split an entree: the Veal Blanquette.The kitchen was kind enough, with us even having to ask, to split our entree prior to service.  Each of us was presented with a cast-iron ""crock pot"" containing slowly-braised veal, pearl onions, and carrots enveloped by a creamy butter sauce, gently kissed with lemon essence.  A plate of sticky jasmine rice was served alongside.The rice and sauce, alone, reminded me of my favorite childhood dish, ""chicken a-la-king.""  The perfectly-cooked veal, however, added an elevated level of sophistication to a rather humble one-pot-meal that I would have otherwise pictured being paired with chicken.  Perhaps it's the fact that I typically shy away from ordering this ""taboo"" meat option but, on those occasions when I do, I'm always reminded of its incredibly moist and tender texture.  This representation was one of the best veal entrees that I've had to date.For dessert, Jackie and I decided to split a plate of homemade macarons and the Apple Tarte Tatin.Served on the cool side, these delightful raspberry-shelled macarons were filled with a dark-chocolate creme center.Perched atop a thin puff pastry disk were buttery, juicy, caramelized apples that had been crowned with a dollop of cool creme fraiche.  Encircling the pastry was the most intense syrup, rich in honey flavor, that perfectly caught each apple after it tumbled down to the plate post fork-cut.  I almost asked for a side serving of this syrup so that I could dip each and every bite of my half of the tarte in to its sweet deliciousness!",1,0,0,Lindsay F.,"New York, NY",376,277,184
3.0,7/18/2011,"In a word- harumph!  The sybaritic overflow of the Upper East Side concentrates in one place, and that place is Orsay.The decor was enjoyable in an old-fashioned French way (do they have palm trees in Nice?).  My date and I both agreed: reminiscent of Rick's in Casablanca.  The human decor was a smorgasbord of douchery.  There were plenty of trust fund babies in their early 20's (wearing designer t-shirts, self-satisfied grins, and gaudy Rolex Daytonas or Audemars Piguets), executive types doing business, and executive types there with their mistresses.  It was packed and LOUD- perhaps all the better to ensure that the sweet nothings meant for your mistress's ears are drowned out to everyone else.Living in the neighborhood, I have passed by Orsay so many times, yet never really found a reason to go there.  I've gone to more expensive restaurants in the area, but always felt there was a value proposition that made sense in those cases.  Even after the $35/person NYC Restaurant Week prix fixe, I'm not sure I got my money's worth.The food in a single two-person meal: buttery delicious (onion tart), tasty but unremarkable (smoked salmon and horseradish cream), a lardy mess (veal), and a fishy mess (skatefish with green beans).  Dessert was unremarkable- sorbet's pretty much sorbet anywhere, and my strawberry rhubarb tart was little more than a stale cookie with some fruit on it.The wine list looked well-constructed, but even for the area, prices ranged from overpriced to very overpriced.  I'm glad that I got to try it, but still fail to see the value proposition.  There are definitely better options in the area.",6,2,0,Chris L.,"New York, NY",32,123,1

3.0,12/29/2009,"Very nice restaurant, but not great food. I thought for a nice French restaurant, I'd be blown away. Not. FOOD: The complimentary freshly baked bread was very good. Crispy crust and warm bread in the middle. I had the fixed price (Prix Fixe for $35) menu that comes with an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I had the smoked sea scallop, beef braise, and chocolate pave. The scallops were minced with apples and salmon caviar into a Waldorf salad-like dish. Not what I expected. It was okay. The beef braise was melt in your mouth tender with bits of bacon, mushrooms, and onions. I wasn't too fond of their butternut squash that was mashed. The chocolate pave was a small piece of dense cake with chocolate sauce around it. It tasted better with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The service and food was okay, but the restaurant was getting busier as the night went on, so maybe I ordered the wrong food. We also came here for Easter Sunday brunch. It was a fixed price, set menu. I had the salmon sandwich with fries. The salmon was cooked medium which was tasty and perfect, and came with avocado slices.

We shared the smoked salmon appetizer and then I had the smoked chicken sandwich on a pretzel and my dining companion had the trio of mini burgers. I think the best part of the meal was the appetizer, although his dish was way better than mine. All in all, the experience was just ok. However, there is one thing that really bothers me. The service was not great to begin with. We were pretty much ignored by our waitress (who brought our check after a long wait, but then didn't even bother to pick it up - someone else picked up the check) for the whole meal. Being a bistro, were were ok with the service, though not thrilled. However, being a little grumpy about being ignored, as we were in a rush to meet friends, we did not leave as large a tip as usual. This was done on purpose, but it was still at least 18%. I was quite unhappy when I saw on my credit card statement today that they entered a different total than what I had indicated on my signed receipt.

I've had Cobb Salads across the country and this one was the best I've ever had. Traditional Cobb, not exactly, but it did contain all the components and its construction was an artistic endeavor. What was that flavor!?! It was the smallest (and perfect) amount of Dill. Not a flavor traditionally associated with this standby. I believe they also used chicory.

I am not sure why this guy had the snooty attitude- but I guess you have to decide if you want to put up with it when you go to this place.  Like I said, the food is good, everyone liked their traditional French meals, a steak, chicken, duck and the red snapper.  After reading the other reviews it is clear that the service is consistently full of attitude....",1,0,0,David C.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,87,0

2.0,7/26/2007,"Very few times in my life do I find myself savoring french food.  I don't include french pastries in that category because if you're not dying for a french dessert, you're not technically considered ""alive"".  Ever since I saw Ratotuille, I wanted French food.  With it being restaurant week, and wanting to impressed my lady friend, I decided that I would take her to Orsay.  The Times gave it two stars, the place is always full, and the menu is expensive.  It should be good, right?Why, oh why, do I listen to the Times.The problem with going to a pretensious French restaurant (and Orsay is very pretentious) during restaurant week is that the prix fix menu for us cheap diners is considered lower class fare.  The meals are uninspired, poorly designed, cooked, or presented.  The initial bread order is small and weak.  The bread is crusty but in meager portions and is not refilled once finished.  My girlfriend and I both had the Tomato Tart salad, a salad sitting on a bed of tomatoes and puff pastry surrounded in an olive sauce.  It sounds good but it was weak.  The puff pastry was flavorless and the tomatoes soggy and uninteresting.  My girlfriend followed up with the cooked Cod dish and I had the veal flank stank with mushroom risotto.  The veal was cold and smothered in a sauce that tasted like A1 steak sauce.  The risotto was actually very tasty - hot, steamy, creamy.  I have the feeling that the cold stank and hot risotto were suppose to complement each other but the combination reminded me of a deli rather than a supposed two star restaurant. The Cod dish came in a black iron cast pot and was suppose to be hot - it was luke warm at best.  The Cod was flavorless and weak.  My girlfriend took the left over sauce from my plate and used it on the Cod to give the Cod some life.  She couldn't finish it and longing wanted my veal steak.  That's pretty sad.For dessert, my girlfriend enjoyed the lemon sorbet was very good - clean, crisp, well made.  I enjoyed a Pana Cotta with a berry bath which was served in the wrong kind of dish.  The berry sauce tasted like it came from a jar but the Pana Cotta was very good.While I sat around in between dishes, I spied at what the other diners were getting.  The place was packed.  The restaurant is very well put together, reminding me of a step below Artisinal in decour.  All of the other dishes being served at the restaurant were far and above better presented, and by other diners' reactions, better tasting than my meal.  Although the dishes themselves were nothing new - I doubt anything in that restaurant is innovative - they seemed well prepared and well cooked.  I felt cheated and used.  My one hundred dollars were going to be used to merely fatten some craptastic owner's wallet when it could be more useful for one of the countless other good restaurants in the city.  I will say that the service was good and the bus boys extremely good in serving the dishes, keeping my water class full, and providing effective service.It's really sad when a ""great restaurant"" can only get the bus boys and risotto right.  Orsay's has been around since 2000.  Why it was allowed to last longer than 3 weeks is beyond me.",3,0,0,Marc A.

WRONG. The manager, OLIVIER (remember that name), came out and ARGUED with me for over thirty minutes saying that my steak was not overcooked and refused to take it back to the kitchen.

I don't understand why he was being such a bully when all I asked was for my dish to be prepared to my liking. You will not believe what Olivier does next -- he PICKS MY STEAK UP WITH HIS BARE HANDS and proceeds to tell me that I WILL NOT be getting a replacement dish b/c I had the dish for 30 minutes (I had exactly two bites of the steak) and that he'll just take  my order off of the check and proceeds to walk away.

Very nice wooden tones with an antique white ceiling.. or was it beige? Service was very courteous and prompt even though food took some time to get to the table. I suppose that not ordering appetizers made it seem longer, but well counting on an hour for lunch is a bit on the cutting it short for most restaurants in the city.  I ordered Pot roast cod fish and she ordered Tuna and Salmon tartare. Both dishes were very nice. Mine subtly seasoned with artichokes and baby carrots surrounding the codfish. The tartare was very nice. It had some sesame seeds in the mix giving it a nice unusual flavor compared to other tartares I've had before. As a closer we had an apple tarte tatin with creme fraich.
