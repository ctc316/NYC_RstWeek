5.0,4/9/2019,"I decided to come here for a date night with my boyfriend last night and truly can't speak more highly of this special find. The food, which is Hawaiian inspired, is artfully crafted without being too intimidating. We had the squash blossoms, fresh poke, truffle gnocchi, and wagyu steak and literally every bite was heaven. The wine list is also incredible and the staff was so helpful in guiding us to the best pairing with what we were having. I'm addition, the atmosphere was just what we needed, perfectly ambient and intimate. I will definitely be coming back!",0,0,0,Danielle C.,"New York, NY",23,8,0
5.0,4/7/2019,"Amazing. Beware of the small portions (except those under ""large plates""--those are huge), but if you're willing to pay for the super amazing food and service that you get, then the size of the plates shouldn't be much of an issue. Best ambiance, super romantic and pretty. We sat in the back/side room and it was really quiet (in contrast to the bustling front room) and we liked that. My boyfriend and I shared:Pork potstickers Taro chips Truffle gnocchi Fried chicken (large plate--enormous)Bread puddingAll in all, 10/10. Everything was amazing. Definitely pricey, but well worth it.",0,0,0,Renee P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,12,37

4.0,3/28/2019,The outside of this restaurant is deceiving- it's actually really nice inside. It's an upscale Hawaiian restaurant. There were some interesting items on the menu so if you are adventurous with food this could be a great place for you! Spam and cows tongue were two things on the menu that my friends tried. It's not what you'd ordinarily associate with Hawaiian esque.,0,0,0,Gina M.,"New York, NY",169,47,48
3.0,3/28/2019,"Yes, this is an adorable little place. The truffle spam musubi was perhaps my favourite (oh! HUMBLE SPAM! How ye are elevated!), closely followed by the mentaiko spaghetti (definitely get it with the uni) and the fried chicken large plate. But, ah, why no 5 stars? Boy, does the bill add up. For what it was, it was a little expensive, but I could stomach it for a relaxing dinner out with friends. (Don't get the pickles or kimchi-- save your $8/ plate and go to a Korean deli instead.) But then there was dessert. We ordered the creme bruleed pineapple with a fancy salt whose name I cannot remember now. I was anticipating a dessert of pineapple slices with a warm caramelized top and the pleasing contrast of saltiness. Instead the reality was a quarter pineapple served in its husk, cold, with a paltry dripping of equally cold, hardened caramel on top. Maybe I'm being picky and splitting hairs here, but for $10, I think I'm allowed.A fine night out if you're not paying-- for a party of three, inclusive of 3 glasses of wine, and 4 beers, the tab with tip came to 90 bucks per person.",0,0,0,Joelle D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,10,0
3.0,3/24/2019,"I had 6 appetizers and no main dish, so I can only speak to those.First, portion is pretty small for apps.Second, don't get lured by truffle and bone marrow in some of their dishes.  While it sounds good on paper, I didn't feel combination and harmony of ingredient was there.  Taste of uni overpowered everything.  I would stick with their basic apps that are more reasonably priced, and more orthodox in approach.  But you can get those in other places too.Third, freshness of ingredient was hit or miss.  Uni tasted good, but tuna poke had pretty fishy first few bites.  Given that the poke is one of their more popular dishes, it was a let down.  I did enjoy the overall flavor and particularly the texture of seaweed.While all the dishes were pretty good, there was no stand out.",0,0,0,Joe L.,"Fairview, NJ",0,34,1

5.0,3/16/2019,Service was great and the food was wonderful. We came as a large group and they accommodated us on a busy Sat night. We let the waiter choose our dishes and practically everything that came out had uni or truffles in it. The gnocchi was a stand out. I didn't care much for their famed fried chicken but I was stuffed by the time it came out so that may have affected my tastes.

4.0,3/11/2019,"I went there during Valentine's Day. 2 ,people we spent around $160. We ordered a good amount of food. Portions are small. The presentation is very pleasing, simple and clean.The restaurant itself is small and very dark. Good luck to my ""The phone eats first "" friends and people can have a bad eyesight. My boyfriend has 20/20 vision and had to use the candle on the table as a light source to read his menu. Also I'm a foodie and I love to capture the food I eat. Felt a bit embarrassed having to take my photos with the flash on, especially in such a small restaurant.  And the tables are small.The fried chicken had good flavor and really crispy, but not worth the price. The grill octopus was really tinder. I was not a fan of the beef tongue musubi. I personally didn't like the flavor of it, it over power the texture and taste of the beef tongue.The bone marrow beard with uni and truffle was delicious though. I could lick the plate clean. The flavors and textures worked so well together. Everyone on my social media were asking me ""Where did you get this?"" That's how pretty the dish and unique the dish was. The scallop sashimi was amazing too. Sweet, simple, fresh, and beautiful overall. The greens on the plate added a pop of color, texture and freshness. For our main entrees we got Kahlua pork cavatelli and mentaiko spaghetti. They were both pretty good. The pasta was perfectly cooked and creamy.    The service was alright. Our waiter didn't look like he was in the best mood. He was never rude, he just didn't look happy. We ran out of water a few times and had to ask for refills. But other than that I had a good date there.",0,0,0,Amy C.,"Queens, NY",290,25,22
5.0,3/11/2019,The meal here was fabulous and very wine friendly.  Loved this menu and the food was a great success.  Several standouts on the menu with my favorite probably being the roast pork.  Potstickers were a superb starter.  Really everything so good.  I love little places like this in NYC.  Very local feel to it without an publicity.  Hope it sticks around for a long-time.,1,0,0,John O.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,984,44
5.0,3/3/2019,"Great atmosphere, cozy and filled with aloha spirit. The menu is adventurous, offering a creative menu with a little Hawaiian regional cuisine influence. The ingredients were extremely fresh. The spam musubis were a fun twist on the traditional, my favorite was the beef tongue, almost like an oxtail soup musubi (drool).

I had a variety of 3 sushi rolls (spam , pork tongue, and mushroom) more carb than I wanted yet I accepted the flavors with great joy. As a a main mentaiko spaghetti made with GF noodles. a total taste sensation. My main squeeze had the fried chicken as it included mac n cheese. he goes for the classics !

4.0,2/14/2019,"This is a great date spot or a small group of friends because the tables are small and can be crowded. The service was great, I never had to ask for a water refill or get someone's attention. Since I came on a pretty cold and rainy night, it was not too full. I ordered the truffle gnocchi and it was delicious! Although not melt in your mouth, the gnocchi was like a pillow and has just the right amount of truffle. My friend ordered from the restaurant week menu and got the tuna poke, wagyu, and bread pudding. The tuna was fresh and the beef was cooked well. Although nothing too impressive it's a solid spot to eat at! The bread pudding was delicious too and not too heavy or sweet.",0,0,0,Jasmine C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",9,60,29
3.0,2/9/2019,"Though I went during restaurant week, I did order items that are on the regular menu.Atmosphere - Despite it being an early Sunday evening, the dining area was almost pitch black, I could barely see the food on my plate except for the small tea-light placed on the table. Definitely makes it feel intimate, or can make you question how much your fish is cooked (more on that later).Heart of palm salad - love heart of palm and the beets, but the overly sweet apple butter made it taste more of a dessert than a salad/appetizer. While I loved the main vegetables paired with the sesame and pomegranate, I ended up scraping off most of the apple butter.Steelhead trout - I love the funk that fermented black beans bring, and it was amazing with the bok choy, but sadly the powerful flavour overpowered the delicate trout (great crisp skin) if you took too much at once (even a single leaf coated in the sauce was too much). The squash puree beautifully cut through the sauce, but there was no where near enough for it to do it's job. Also, Be Careful! My fish was clearly undercooked, I used a flashlight on my phone to inspect the inside which was not flaking and much pinker than the edges. Asking the waitress (who could probably not see the fish well due to the darkness), she snuffed at my concern and said the fish was cooked all the way through ""medium."" I did end up eating the rest, though my stomach was definitely questioning something later that night.Bruleed pineapple - It takes a lot of confidence to present a slice of pineapple on a plate as dessert. The presentation is bold, but honestly, I could not find the flavours of the sea salt and lime that were apparently on the fruit. In the end, while it was good pineapple, it felt like something I could easily do in my broiler. Go for another dessert that justifies the 10$ price tag.",0,0,0,Anne P.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",64,24,130

Poke salad was fine. The wagyu and fried rice was on the saltier side but overall very good. The wagyu was cooked perfectly and super tender. Fried rice was . The spaghetti seemed to be the most popular item on the menu but unfortunately kind of a let down. The flavor was good but it was so salty it actually hurt. Pineapple cake was pretty solid.

5.0,1/21/2019,"I went to Noreetuh for my birthday with a group of 10 and it was FANTASTIC. They gave us the option to order from the a la carte menu and the pre fix, and even printed a happy birthday note on both! Most of us ordered their $48 pre fix (which is a great deal) and I got the fried chicken plate, which was really delicious. (Insanely moist and well seasoned.) I also want to give a special shout out to our server Sarah, who was incredibly sweet and attentive. She helped us pick great wines and was able to handle our large (somewhat loud...) group with ease. The top dishes of the night were chicken, the musubi and the kalua pork cavatelli. For dessert we did the pineapple upside down cake, which is a bit pricey, but definitely worth it. I absolutely will be back!

5.0,12/21/2018,"This place is easily missed as you walk by the busy street. The front is dark and so is the inside. That said, you'll be doing yourself a disservice if you just passed by. Not everyone loves spam, I get that. But if you can get over the fact that you're eating canned byproducts, the pork jowl musubi and spicy spam musubi are delicious. We also got the monkfish liver, bone marrow bread pudding, the luau leaf tortellini, five spice glazed pork chop, imperial wagyu, and a truffle gnocchi. Everything was amazing. The biggest surprise was actually the pork chop. It has the most beautiful grill marks and was super juicy. We finished dinner with a simple grilled pineapple.

4.0,11/9/2018,"I would give this place 4.5 stars.  I came here for dinner on a Thursday night.  We ordered the prix fixe menu - a snack, appetizer, and entree for $48 which is not bad.  We ordered the corned beef tongue musubi snack, the grilled octopus appetizer, and the luau leaf tortellini entree.  We also had the scallop sashimi appetizer and the five spice glazed pork chop entree.  My favorite dishes were the scallop sashimi appetizer and the five spice glazed pork chop entree.  The scallop sashimi appetizer had interesting ingredients: green almonds? there is such a thing? The flavors were interesting: Sichuan chili oil with scallops? I also appreciated the Japanese rice crunchies for texture.  I actually really liked the pork chop entree not for the pork chop (which was delicious too) but for the fennel puree and grilled fennel.  For dessert, we ordered the black sesame rice pudding which was not memorable.  The service was fast and very friendly.  They take an instax picture for you at the end of the meal, one for you and one for their wall.  You can decorate it any way you want which was cute.  It was a great meal and I would come back to try their other dishes.",4,0,3,Julie Ying X.,"Brooklyn, NY",230,557,557

This was a month ago and i still remember every aspect of my meal. Every dish we had was so carefully thought out, with a beautiful composition of colors, layers of texture and flavor. My bf and i shared the poké, octopus, squash tempura, spaghetti, and chicory salad, and had the pineapple upside down cake. Hard to name a favorite but for me the most enjoyable were the poké and tempura, and most fun was the cake! we also had a couple of the wines by the glass, including a memorable pinot noir.

My friend got the Hawaiian platter and absolutely loved it- it had eggs, spam, sausage, Mac salad and kimchi. Not being a fan of kimchi myself I got the tuna poke bowl (minus the kimchi) and it was pretty good, I will note it's predominately rice though. The Musubi is a must try!

2.0,8/30/2018,"I came here for restaurant week two weeks ago with my boyfriend. (Oops didn't have time to write a review) We were super excited after seeing all the good reviews but left disappointed. Appetizers:Tuna poke- We actually thought this was the best dish of the night. It was seasoned well and the tuna tasted fresh. Very light and refreshing. Silken tofu with uni- was very upset with this. The uni just didn't taste fresh and the ikura was extremely salty. Considering that we had to pay a supplemental cost too.. this was not worth it at allBeef tongue musubi- this was okay. It wasn't super flavorful, we should've just went with the spam musubi instead EntreesMentaiko spaghetti with uni- this was horrible! I should've known from the uni in the appetizer but I didn't think to change my order. The spaghetti was too sour tasting for me. The uni was even worse than in the appetizer! It didn't even melt in your mouth so it was a very weird texture. This may have been because it was sitting on top of warm spaghetti? I'm not too sure. Had to pay supplemental cost for this too. Five-spice glazed pork chop- this was not bad. We thought the flavor was good and it wasn't over cooked or anything DessertPineapple upside down cake- this was good. The ice cream was refreshing.

5.0,8/26/2018,"Came for restaurant week and already cannot wait to get back here! The food was nothing short of amazing. My sister and I both got the tuna poke for starters and it was so fresh and perfectly seasoned. My sister has a nut allergy which they were accommodating of. Our server took note of it, but both pokes came out with macadamia nuts anyways. Before we were even able to check/notice, the server quickly came to check on my sister's plate to see if the adjustment was made. The plate was switched out in no time, which we really appreciated. We shared our main courses - mentaiko spaghetti w/ uni and the five spice glazed pork chop. The mentaiko spaghetti was so creamy and rich, especially with the added uni. Absolutely delicious! We weren't super excited about the five spice pork chop, but once we got into it, there were no regrets. The pork chop was perfectly cooked, so moist inside! It was a great combination with the spatzle and pineapple, which added a nice sweetness to complement the glaze.Last but not least, we shared the pineapple upside down cake which was one of the best desserts I've ever had at a restaurant. The cake serves two and as told by our server, it isn't always on the menu. The extremely moist cake sat on top of coconut and pineapple ice cream, which went with the cake SO WELL. The sweetness of the caramelized pineapple topped off the cake wonderfully along with the tartness of the sauce. 100% would come back because of this dessert!Great service + great food -- come during restaurant week for a good deal too!",2,0,0,Sophia Q.,"Brooklyn, NY",248,72,313

This was a pretty light dish - rice was well seasoned and the kimchi was a good addition to cut through some of the sweetness of the rice and poke.-Kalua pork bowl: 3/5. It was a little bland and I think there may have been a little too much vinegar in the seasoning? Kind of plain and I didn't think the egg added much to the pork. Protein to rice ratio was off too. -Mochiko chicken loco moco: 3/5. Chicken was nice and crispy. Mac and cheese was OK - like the standard mac and cheese salads that you can get in a cafeteria. -Corned beef tongue musubi: 1/5. Nothing special. Very bland.

4.0,8/18/2018,"I have been going to Hawaii regularly for 40 years because my husband is from there and has family there. The food at Noreetuh is really good, but did not hit the very high spots that I was hoping for. The main issues are small portions for the price--for food and drinks both--and some inconsistencies in quality of food and presentation. Here goes:My husband loved the kalua pig pasta dish. The tastes were great, smoky, perfectly cooked pasta. But the small dollop in the middle of a huge bowl amplified how little food was in there. His appetizer, a standard pork katsu, was well-prepared, but not sliced for a chopstick user as would be standard, and presented in a very bland, uninspired fashion--just a pork steak on a plate with sauce dish, some cabbage, and chunk of lemon. At least put some garnish on it to give a nod to the traditions of Japan.I had the tuna poke which was really good, and then the opah. Now I knew the chef's preference was to prepare it rare, and I guess I learned I don't really like it that way (having had plenty of cooked opah in the past). Plus the kabocha squash which was supposed to accompany this dish was nowhere in sight. The bok choy with fermented black beans had a strong flavor, OK for me but perhaps too strong for most.Dessert was fine--haupia and bread pudding were nice, but hey, if you have had Ted's haupia pie from the North Shore of Oahu, and anything from a bakery in Hawaii, these two items did not particularly stand out. I am holding this restaurant to a high standard, Alan Wong and Roy Yamaguchi being my heroes. I yearn for something close to that experience on the East Coast. Noreetuh has that potential but is not there yet.A note about service: our server was affable enough, but he was so busy, he was not as attentive as one might expect for fine dining in NYC. So here's hoping Noreetuh can succeed and reach the heights it is capable of.",0,0,0,Diane B.,"Harvard, MA",0,25,0

2.0,8/11/2018,"Was super excited to try this place for restaurant week. Went with my sister and our other friend for an 8:30 reservation. We didn't get seated until 8:50. I ordered big eye tuna poke, grilled Hawaiian blue marlin, and pineapple upside down cake. The big eye tuna poke was the best thing I ate that night. The tuna was fresh and everything was super tasty. Great crunch for texture from the macadamia nuts. However the meal went quite downhill from there. There was a 30 minute wait to get our mains. The grilled Hawaiian blue marlin was interesting. It was a meaty fish but was rather bland and underwhelming. The bok choy was blackened and extremely acidic, not good. There was another 30 minute wait to get dessert. We were so bored. The pineapple upside down cake was super sweet, and I couldn't tell that the ice cream was coconut or pineapple at all, just tasted of vanilla. Maybe my palette was just overwhelmed after the acidic bok choy and the super sweet upside down cake that I couldn't taste anything. Ambiance wise it's trendy and candlelit dark, probably not bad for a date. But food was totally underwhelming and I'm rather disappointed",1,0,0,Tony Q.,"Manhattan, NY",124,142,270
2.0,8/10/2018,"3 stars for food. 2 stars for service. Noreetuh isn't worth it IMO. Came on a Friday night for restaurant week at 8:30pm. We had a party of 3 and had our reservations from Opentable. It took them 15 minutes to get us seated which was pretty frustrating. The three of us all ordered the restaurant week menu. AMBIANCE:Dark, with candles lighted throughout. Ambiance was quite lively with conversations here and about, but not loud enough so you can't hear your friends talking. I suppose this would be a good place to take a date or friends.PROS:Highlights was the pork chop main course on a bed of succotash. Pork was incredibly juicy and the five spices greatly complimented the meat itself. Seasoned pretty well, and the succotash was creamy, had corn, and was a pleasant contrast to the pork chop itself. Blue marlin was also decent as you can tell the fish was very fresh. Pork cutlet was fried to a perfect crisp and was moist and juicy inside - I really enjoyed the sauce that it came with. The pokebowl was also super delightful and fresh, as the combination of balsamic, herbs, seasme oil, and tuna created a amalgamation of eclectic, yet harmonious flavors. CONS:Biggest letdown for tonight has got to be the suppppeerrrr long wait times. Our three course meal took at least 1.5 hours to finish, and mind you we had about 30 minutes in between each course. Service was way too slow! Definitely had better service around the area. As for the food itself - Blue marlin was great but the bok choy garnish that it was served with was SMOTHERED in balsamic - it made the bok choy taste vinegary and incredibly acidic. Definitely was rather unpleasant to eat. Heart of Palms was incredibly bland and underseasoned. It tasted like I was eating paper and was nothing too special. Pineapple upside down cake was too sweet IMO, as my friend and I couldn't finish it all because the pineapple and the breading below it was overly saturated with sweetness. OVERALL:Was quite disappointed with my experience at Noreetuh considering we are paying $42 for a restaurant week experience. Also wait times in between courses was absurdly long. If you have 2 hours to kill on three courses go knock yourself out here, but if not don't avoid coming here for their restaurant week specials.",0,2,0,Jonghan L.,"Manhattan, NY",279,137,379

4.0,8/10/2018,The food was amazing. I never had Hawaiian food before and it was great. Tried this for restaurant week and the menu options were great. They had a lot of variety of fish and meat. The tuna poke and the spice pork chop amazing. So was the octopus and cod fish. Omnibus was nice and relaxed with Hawaiian music playing in the background. I had the octopus as an appetizer and my bf had the tuna poke both were nice and tender. Then he had the spiced pork chop and i had the smoked cod spaghetti the pork was so juicy and flavorful and the cod was tender and not too much fish taste. For dessert had the bread pudding and the sundae. The texture for the bread pudding was a little off and the ice cream didn't really taste like pineapple but everything else was amazing. It was a unique experience. And would definitely go back. It's a must try.,0,0,0,Crystal S.,"Bronx, NY",87,6,3

Out of all these fads derived from the culture of na kanaka maoli, this is the closest place to Hawaiian influence that I've seen.

The chefs have their pedigree, the three used to work at Per Se. So happy they opened up Noreetuh! It is a very down to earth place where you can get tasty dishes at reasonable prices. It has a boutique feel given it is small and attention is excellent.The wine list boasts 200 curated wine selections and they even decanted our red wine Lopez Bosconia '05 ($75 - recommended!).We shared (2 people):- Big-eye Tuna Poke ($22): macadamia nut, pickled jalapeño, seaweed. One of my favorite pokes. The tuna is sooo fresh. It melts in your mouth.- Galbi Short Ribs ($12): it has a sauce, or it is marinated is something really good.- Hawaiian Garlic Shrimp ($19): soba noodles, miso cucumbers, mushroom, cilantro- Grilled Hawaiian Opah ($17): spring onion, fiddlehead ferns, kumquats. Firm white fish. Delicous!- Bruléed hawaiian pineapple ($10): lime zest, 'alaea salt. Please get this! So fresh yet so tasty. We added a scoop of coconut ice cream and it was one of the best decisions ever.I will be back soon.

For starters we tried the salmon and tuna poké as well as the octopus. Both types of poké were amazing so you really can't go wrong with either! For entrees we had the pork belly, mochi-crusted fish, and the kahlua pork cavatelli. My favorite was the pasta as it was a perfect fusion dish! I wish we also ordered the mentaiko spaghetti but I suppose that's reason to return.. For dessert we shared the pineapple upside down cake and another dish and wow, for a RW dinner, they do not skimp on the portions. We were so full after the entire meal!

I was a little bummed by this. The flavor of the dishes we ordered were good, although portions were on the small side. The decor had a modern feel and was very white. Service was good and friendly.

4.0,3/29/2018,"We went here for Winter restaurant week 2018 and the overall experience was worth a solid four stars. The restaurant is sort of an upscale take on Hawaiian food, with an vibe that is more 'fine fusion dining' than 'beaches and sunshine'. The interiors were done well in a warm, sort of abstract-art way and managed to pull off an elegant vibe for the small space they have to work with.Food here was quite good overall, and they made good use of restaurant week to highlight some of their signature dishes. For apps we had the octopus which was good but a tad chewy, and the salmon poke which was light, fresh and tasty! For mains we did the pork belly with pineapple which was tender and decadent, and the spam agnolotti which was a bit of a disappointment since the spam only lent saltiness to the dish and the truffle flavor was not as pronounced. Dessert was really good, we had the chocolate haupia sundae and the ube pie both of which were delicious.Our server was friendly but seemed a bit spaced out and did not do a great job in helping us pick the food.

3.0,3/1/2018,"Checked out Noreetuh last night after stumbling upon it about a month ago while making restaurant week reservations.  I was excited to try it based on the reviews and the menu offerings.  We opted for the 3-course menu with wine pairings.  My first selection was the Berkshire Pork Potstickers -- tasty, but nothing special.  Next, I had the Spicy Salmon Poke.  I had no idea that it would be slathered with a non-dairy mayo until our waiter began describing the rationale for the wine pairing selection before the dish arrived.  It was simply too much mayo.  Our waiter was gracious enough to offer me an alternate selection after noticing I had only a few bites.  I instead had the Hawaiian Garlic Shrimpt, which was solid.  For my main, I had the Kalua Pork Cavatelli.  I am a deep lover of pasta and pork.  Perhaps it was the cabbage or the way the pork was seasoned, but the taste was simply odd and after taking a few bites, I was done.  Our waiter expressed concern (again) over my apparent dissatisfaction with the course.  At that point, I was resigned to hopefully enjoy my dessert -- the Hawaiian Bread Pudding.  Afterall, and how can anyone (especially me) not enjoy bread pudding of any kind.  I didn't like that either.  The texture was slightly too custard-y for my tastes. Mysteriously, our bill was $245 (before tip; for two people).  It is a rare occasion that I've spent so much money to be both sober and underwhelmed by my meal.  I was also still hungry having effectively only eaten 6 pot stickers and 1.5 shrimp.  I have no complaints about the service.  Our waiter was extremely knowledge about the wine offerings and very accommodating.Noreetuh is certainly a unique option in the city, but I probably won't return unless I'm in the area, someone else suggests it and I'm too polite to veto the selection.",0,0,0,Tanisha C.,"Brooklyn, NY",233,184,192

Definitely a plus.Service was good. Our server was the Asian guy with the glasses, sorry, never got your name. Check on us for every course, changed plates between courses as well.We got the soju punch, which was nice. Would have been better if there were some garnishes like fruits or something.Now for the food..- silken tofu - very nice, light, and flavorful when you eat every different ingredient together in each bite.- grilled octopus - perfectly cooked. Everything on that plate was amazing and went well together. Honestly, the best this we ate that night!- pork belly - it was soft like butter, it was amazing. Only negative part was that the dish was very oily. There were some little pasta (I don't know exactly what it was) under the pork belly. It tasted great but there was a lot of oil under it, which I'm assuming was from the pork belly, which made it hard to enjoy.- imperial wagyu - Not as good as I hoped. Fried rice was delicious. Beef was not as tender as expected. Definitely needed that Chinese broccoli to cut the saltiness of both the rice and beef together.- chocolate haupia sundae - 1 scoop of ice cream with a lot of whipped cream. There were some waffer chips in there that tasted kind of stale, which really affected the taste of the dessert- Hawaiian bread pudding - tasted like French toast with sour raisins on top.Would come back for just the appetizers.

5.0,2/3/2018,"A fresh take on Hawaiian food tucked away in the East Village. We came here for Restaurant Week - three courses for $42. AppsWe came for poke and were not disappointed. The very fresh big-eye tuna poke, marinated in soy sauce and macadamia oil, made for a light and fresh start to the meal. We also got the grilled octopus, which is some of the best cook on a tentacle I've ever had. Perfectly tender with an acidic salad to complement it. MainsThe pineapple-glazed pork belly melted in my mouth and went perfectly with the pillowy spaetzle and greens. But the star of the show was the pork cavatelli, an initially nonsensical dish of braised pork, pickled cabbage, and handmade pasta that made a perfect marriage when I tasted it. DessertWe had the chocolate haupia sundae and the King's Hawaiian bread pudding. Both were delicious, but we were pretty full at this point, so we didn't get to dive in as much as we wanted to. Next time, I'll try the pineapple upside down cake.Takeaways- There's a surprising amount of Italian influence in their food, which struck me as odd at first, but it all makes sense in your mouth.- I can't quite nail the vibe of this place. The back room is dark and romantic, but it's also got some beachy, casual elements. - I would definitely come back here for Restaurant Week, but their normal prices are definitely toward the high end of my budget. - They have an extraordinary wine list that I'd love to dive into during the rest of the year.",1,0,0,Margot G.,"New York, NY",0,1,0

I came here with a friend for restaurant week ($42 per person). Salmon poke: delicious; a very balanced concoction of flavors. Get it. Tuna poke: not as good; the flavor of the tuna was overpowered by the sauce, and the tuna itself was flavorless. Pineapple pork belly: very good; small portion of pork belly, but skillfully prepared and beautifully presented. Bass: disappointing; the crispy fish was plain and boring... I wish we hadn't ordered it. King's Hawaiian bred pudding: very tasty (and bigger in size than the pork belly); if you love bread pudding, you should get this.

3.0,1/25/2018,"I so so wanted to love Noreetuh. The concept is great since NYC is seriously lacking in restaurants that specialize in Hawaiian food (aside from all the poke places). When we walked in, we were expecting laid-back island vibes, but we found a dimly-lit, intimate restaurant that would be great for date nights or a nice girls night out.The menu offers several Hawaiian inspired small plates, which is nice if you want to try a bit of everything, however, budget-wise it's not that friendly. All the dishes are around $20+, excluding snacks and desserts which are in the $10 range. I came for winter restaurant week, which was a good deal. Three dishes for $42 and all the dishes were from their actual menu. My friend and I ordered the following and shared. -Appetizer: Big-eye tuna poke & Salmon poke-Main: Mentaiko spaghetti & Mochi-crusted bass-Dessert: 2 orders of the bruleed Hawaiian pineappleOverall, the dishes were artfully crafted and tasty, but I can't get over the prices for the portion size. For restaurant week, it was definitely a good deal, as I would say you would need to order at least two dishes per person to feel full.

We made reservations ahead of time, which seemed like a good idea as the restaurant is quite small inside.We started with the silken tofu, tuna poke,  and spam agnolotti. All three were fresh, creative, and delicious. We were still hungry and ordered the monkfish liver torchon. I was not crazy about this dish as parts were a bit fishy for my taste, but it was nice to fill up on the toasted Hawaiian roll slices that accompany the liver. Our server also recommended an excellent unfiltered sake. The menu does seem a little overpriced to me, which may have been because I read about how reasonably priced the restaurant was, but that is the only place the restaurant loses a start for me. That being said, our server did give us a bruleed pineapple for dessert on the house, we suspect because we were seated next to a noisy birthday party.On that note, the service was excellent - extremely friendly, gave great suggestions, and very prompt with sake refills. The ambience of the restaurant was also lovely - I think it would have been a good noise level if not for the birthday party, and I liked that there were two sections.

4.0,1/1/2018,"I've come here a few times since Noreetuh opened and have enjoyed it but last night had finally sat for dinner. It was a great experience. From the moment we walked in, the staff was  attentive and friendly. They do not have a full bar but the wine menu is well curated and the sommelier made excellent recommendations. A lot of people that grew up in Hawaii often scoff at this place because the food is pricey and portions can be small. Hawaiian food is known for being casual, filling, and cheap so I would recommend trying something new and going for one of their unique house dishes to really appreciate this restaurant. Although the poke is really good here, it is only a few bites for double the price of what you get in Hawaii. If you're looking for more of your typical poke bowl, you should come for brunch as they offer a larger portion with rice, etc (still pricey). The musubi's were nice but honestly I prefer the 7/11 spam musubis in Oahu. Tofu uni app was pretty and tasty. The pasta dishes looked amazing and we will have to try those next time but the mochi crusted bass and wagyu beef really stood out. Every bite in the bass dish had so much flavor and great mix of texture. I didn't want it to end. We were full and didn't order dessert but  I love their halpia and Ube pie.

Upon walking it, there's a coat rack where everyone can hang their coats, and walk on inside before getting seated. I was 30 minutes late to my reservation due to crazy Manhattan traffic; I had notified them prior to my reservation time and they were very nice about it. The staff was knowledgeable about the menu and attentive - as someone who drinks a ton of water, I appreciated that my glass was always filled quickly after I emptied it.We ordered the pineapple braised pork belly, the mochi-crusted bass, and the monkfish liver torchon. I liked the concept of the monkfish liver torchon - the bread had a sweet flavor and was toasted to perfection, and spread to bread ratio was great. I think some may find the monkfish liver flavor to be overly fishy, though I was okay with it. The passionfruit spread on the side helped to cut into the liver / fishy flavor. I didn't care for the combination of sweet passionfruit and fishy monkfish liver, but I am glad that I tried it. The pork belly was my favorite. The lighter pineapple pieces helped to cut into the heaviness of the pork belly. I wish the sauce had been a tad less salty, but I thought that the pork belly was braised to perfection. The mochi-crusted bass is a great, lighter option that balanced out our meal. Our waitress (who was very kind and friendly by the way) said this was one of her favorites. I appreciated that the freshness of the bass was apparent in the dish, meaning that other flavors didn't overpower the natural, fresh fish flavor. The mochi crust was crispy, airy, and not overly thick. The sauce underneath (black bean sauce?) was too salty. The Chinese bacon that accompanied the dish was also pretty tasty.",1,0,0,Wendy C.,"New York, NY",8,252,471

4.0,10/5/2017,"Just came back from a trip to Hawaii and I couldn't wait to revisit the delicious dishes I had just a while ago. This restaurant did not disappoint. It's a modern take on the Hawaiian food so the flavor and presentation are a bit different from their counterparts in Hawaii but when it comes to deciding whether I would come back to a restaurant the two deciding factors are always the food, and the service. We ordered the pre fixe and everything was tasty and properly cooked. Beef tongue musubi had crushed nuts in it which was a good companion to the dish. Grilled octopus was perfectly done - not too moist, not too charred. Kalua pork pasta had great flavor but the sauce could have been more creamy, or more condensed. Our waiter was friendly and had a cool vibe.",0,0,0,Julie O.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",75,13,0
4.0,10/3/2017,"This is a review of the even by Tasting Collective that we attended. It was a 9- course Nouveau Hawaiian Feast. Ever since this restaurant opened up in 2015, I have been wanting to try their food. They offer elevated Hawaiian cuisine, not authentic but original style. The interior was much more fun, with lots of Hawaii-inspired decorations. They had pictures of beach, waves, surfers, etc...  The restaurant looked really small, but then, I found out they have another room next door, connected at the back of the bar.Before the feast began, Executive Chef and Co-Owner, Chung Chow came out to greet everyone and told us a bit about himself and the restaurant. One fun fact about the restaurant is that the name, Noreetuh, is actually Korean, and it means ""playground."" He told us that he was originally planning to open up a Korean restaurant, but with many Korean restaurants opening up everywhere, he decided to change it to Hawaiian restaurant. The Korean name, Noreetuh, was kept unchanged since he liked it so much.At this event, I got to try Hearts of Palm & Peaches, Papaya & Chicory Salad, Tofu & Avocado Poke, Big-Eye Tuna Poke, Spicy Salmon Poke, Kalua Pork Cavatelli, Teriyaki Chicken, Ube Pie, and King's Hawaiian Bread Pudding.I really enjoyed all the food, it was interesting, tasty, and delicious. I am glad the chef Chow decided to open up this Hawaiian restaurant instead of ""another"" Korean restaurant.

5.0,9/30/2017,"A terrific three course prix fixe meal, service, and atmosphere in the East Village. Hawai'ian inspired food and decor with friendly service like you would find in the islands, too. We were steered well from the start with a nice dry rosé from the Basque region of Spain. My opening course, called a ""snack"" here, was kabocha squash tempura, which was yummy and not too dry or crispy like tempura often is, and a nice portion, too, more than a snack. Then the ""appetizer"" of spicy salmon poke, also good with little additions to make for a more interesting blend of flavors. The main dish was excellent: tagliatelle with heirloom tomato sauce. The pasta was well prepared and portioned, the heirloom tomatoes were fantastic in flavor, and the Kauai shrimp were large, mostly in shell, and really juicy.My friend had the pork potstickers to start (good), grilled octopus (really good), and the pork belly entree with pineapple grilled underneath (a winner with two mini-bricks of pork belly). We really didn't have room for dessert, but took a leap and were rewarded with an awesome chocolate haupia sunday - a massive, you have to share it portion - and my fave, a half pineapple presented in dramatic fashion and served brûlée style.

5.0,9/1/2017,"We came for restaurant week 2017, even though I've been meaning to come here for years -- my NYC restaurant bucket list never seems to get shorter! It's funny, because when Noreetuh opened, Hawaiian food was relatively unknown in NYC and pretty much impossible to find. Now, there's been an explosion of poke joints all over the city, so Noreetuh is now a veteran of Hawaiian cuisine in the tri-state area.Our meal here was delightful, because it's just the kind of food I like: balanced flavors, fresh ingredients, and creative combinations. Everything was inventive and full of flavor, and I only wish that the restaurant had a full bar because they'd be able to come up with some awesome cocktails.I had the big-eye tuna poke, mentaiko spaghetti, and the King's Hawaiian bread pudding (also nibbled on the bruléed pineapple. The spaghetti was surprising in its flavor combination, and reminded me a lot of a bottarga dish I've had at Italian restaurants -- the taste of bottarga is extremely similar to the ingredients in here. If you don't like strong, marine flavors and saltiness, I wouldn't order this -- but that kind of funky is right up my alley. The poke, needless to say, is done very well: the fish is firm and fresh, the seasoning is on point, and there's not too much distraction from the seafood.Desserts were good, and the pineapple was especially delicious, but I don't think I would have missed out on too much had I not tried them. Service was extremely friendly, the music was awesome, and this seemed like a great date restaurant. I'd come back for the poke, because they know what they're doing here!",4,0,4,Natasha G.,"Sunnyside, NY",554,229,281
4.0,8/25/2017,"To preface, my review is based-off the Restaurant Week menu. My friends and I came in here after having this place on our list for a while. We were seated right away and ordered drinks to start us off. One of my friends was a bit late, so we ordered a round of pot stickers to keep us happy while we waited. In terms of the menu, I got the salmon poke, tagliatelle, and bread pudding. I loved every minute of the food. It was all tasty and unique. For my first Hawaiian inspired experience, I was very pleased!Ambience is cute inside. It's a small spot, so it can feel like you're on top of everyone around you. We were seated by the window though, so we had a little more space than others. Our waiter was awesome. He was super friendly and attentive, as was everyone else who came around with water and the food. We were also never rushed to leave or pay by anyone!Overall, I loved my experience at Noreetuh.

4.0,8/20/2017,"Came here for Restaurant Week and had high expectations since both friends and co-workers raved about their experience here.  The meal didn't disappoint but also didn't really leave me wanting to come back again and again... We started with the grilled octopus and big-eye tuna poke appetizers. Also ordered an additional side of the mushroom tempura. The grilled octopus was prepared perfectly and the tuna poke was super fresh. The mushroom tempura, while tasty, had way too much batter. It mostly tasted like we were eating fried dough. For our entrees, I ordered the kahlua pork cavatelli and fiancé got the mochi crusted bass. He really enjoyed the fish dish, especially the fermented black bean sauce. Portion sizes were okay - definitely enough when ordered as part of a three-course prix-fixe but some might be left hungry without an app + dessert supplement. My cavatelli pasta was good but just a bit too salty. The star of the meal was definitely the upside-down pineapple cake. My fiancé and I agreed that we would come back just to eat this dessert - the cake was warm and moist, not too sweet, and perfectly paired with cherry, pineapple, and coconut ice creams. The ambiance is nice here and great for both groups and intimate dates. Our server left us wanting a bit more as he came off rather cold/uninviting, but it was a busy night so perhaps that can be forgiven. Noreetuh is definitely a unique spot worth trying!",1,0,1,Margaret Z.,"Manhattan, NY",267,745,79
4.0,8/20/2017,Absolutely wowed by the upside down pineapple cake - so much so that I need to talk about it first before the entrees and apps! A generous ring of sweet pineapple on top of a warm moist cake served with pineapple and cherry ice cream. I could eat this everyday! My only complaint was the ratio of ice cream to cake; if only there was more cake!Back to main courses: the tuna poke app tasted authentic albeit a little too salty. I got the kalua pork cavatelli entree which was a very interesting fusion of Hawaiian and Italian fare. The pickled cabbage added a bit of a sour note while the Parmesan elevated the umami already brought to the dish by the pork. I would definitely return to try other items on their menu.,0,0,0,Linda M.,"San Francisco, CA",112,71,127
4.0,8/18/2017,"Came for restaurant week dinner. Appetizer, entree, dessert.The restaurant is seems pretty small, but I think they have more seating beyond what meets the eye. Upon entering the restaurant, a host would warmly greet you. Unlike some restaurants where their list is in the front, their's is near their bar area, which was fine. We had reservations from opentable at the bar, but since there were table seats, we were offered to sit there, which was great.Service was pretty good. People came to check in on us and fill our water often.Food portions seemed small, but if you're getting a 3-course meal, expect yourself to get full. We got the mushroom tempura, which tasted pretty good. I usually don't eat mushrooms, but I didn't taste the mushroom and was able to enjoy it cuz the batter was good. The silken tofu was what interested me to this restaurant. It was definitely a pretty dish with a unique combo of flavors. In general, this dish would be a hit or miss, honestly. It was just okay for me, but you'd have to try it to decide for yourself. The wagyu steak with fried rice was absolutely the most delicious! The rice tasted good, and usually I only enjoy my gramma's fried rice, but it was good here. The steak was juicy, and definitely, savor it if you get it! For dessert, I had the sundae. It was an interesting combo of flavors.My first time trying Hawaiian cuisine, and I was not disappointed. The combination of flavors were definitely fitting. Some dishes may be a hit or miss, but that's all up to a person's taste buds. The presentation is fantastic. Romantic ambiance for catching up or a date.

My husband and I went to Hawaii for our honeymoon back in March so when I found out that there was a Hawaiian restaurant on restaurant week, we immediately had to try it! The food was decent. The appetizers we had was probably the best - the octopus.. and the poke was pretty good (still did not taste like Hawaii poke). for the main entrée, my husband had the pork with pineapple and it was good. My sister had spaghetti with cod and I had the bass. Again, they were decent..Definitely not what I was expecting.. didn't taste like Hawaii at all. Its almost Asian fusion and some Americanized entrees.. entrees with pineapple makes it Hawaiian I guess? The guy hostess that welcomed us was kind of rude/had an attitude. But our waitress was nice.

At first, I thought the portion sizes were small (especially given the prices of their regular menu), but I was happily satisfied and beyond full by the end of the meal. Between me and my boyfriend we ordered:-Big-eye tuna poke - soy sauce and sesame oil based poke with tuna, seaweed, and macadamia nuts-Salmon poke - salmon tossed in mildly spicy mayo with radish, cucumber, and greens. I liked this better than the tuna poke.-Mentaiko spaghetti - creamy pasta dish filled with cod roe and a few chunks of fish. It had a tad bit more lemon juice/citrus flavor than expected, but was still very appetizing. -Pineapple braised pork belly - a fatty slab of pork belly that practically melts in your mouth. Delicious! The bits of spatzle on the bottom also helped balance out the heavy oils, making it a great combo. -Chocolate huapia sundae - standard ice cream sundae with nice textures of graham crackers, almond slices, and chocolate jellies.-King's Hawaiian bread pudding - warm and sweet bread pudding paired with cold and creamy pineapple ice cream...this was like a match made in heaven!! Definitely my favorite of the night.This restaurant is clean, modern, and trendy, and the service was friendly and helpful.

Let me just preface by saying that I will always prefer a good ol' katsu box and spam musubi from L&L, but Noreetuh delivers in having more sophisticated hawaiian inspired dishes. Atmosphere: Clean, really small, love the touches of island decor.Food: My restaurant week choices were the salmon poke, the mentaiko spaghetti, and the chocolate haupia sundae. The salmon poke had such beautiful presentation, and the flavor was very satisfying and citrusy and the salmon was plentiful and fresh. The mentaiko spaghetti is filled with a creamy and smoky flavor, with bits of soft cod, and the spaghetti was cooked al dente and was very enjoyable. The portion looked small in the bowl but it was actually quite filling. The chocolate haupia dessert was just okay. I enjoyed the bits of chocolate coconut jelly but the ice cream was standard.My parents and boyfriend all got different things. The tuna poke was delicious and the pineapple upside down cake was really, REALLY sweet. I really liked the octopus appetizer, as it was tender and not too chewy. The chow noodles in my opinion were flavorful but they didn't give many noodles. The mochi crusted bass was good but the ingredient that made that dish was the fermented green beans. The pork belly tasted like adobo, so if you enjoy that flavor I'd definitely recommend it.Service: Friendly and attentive.I'd definitely recommend this place.",3,2,2,Tiffany O.,"Newark, NJ",314,516,1390

3.0,8/14/2017,"I came in with a friend for restaurant week 2017. We made a reservation which didn't seem necessary on a early Sunday evening. The ambiance is nice, minimal decoration but their playlist is very fun. Everyone we talked to was very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. We both ordered the poke, her the salmon and I the tuna. Both were very good but with the new poke craze taking NYC by storm, it wasn't notable or creative. I no longer need to hunt for good poke so I wouldn't come her just for that. On to the mains. I ordered the kaluha pork cavatelli and she the mentaiko spaghetti. My entree had a little too many conflicting flavors for me to thoroughly enjoy it. The pork was a bit sweet which was nice and the cheese very salty which was expected, but it didn't stop there, they added a pickled cabbage. So basically the dish was sweet, salty and tangy. My friend's entree lacked a lot of flavor. Probably because most of the flavor comes from the smoked cod, but there was barely any smoked cod. On to dessert. We were both looking forward to this as they had a pineapple upside down cake for 2 with pineapple ice cream. When it came out, they had added cherry and vanilla ice cream and some caramelized cherries. I wish that had been written on the menu (which is different from on their website) because we would've stated to only include pineapple ice cream. The cherry kind of throws your palate for a loop in the bad sense. Overall, the service was great and the food was okay.

They give u a healthy variety of dishes with more than 3 choices per course (so much better than the average RW place and I GREATLY appreciate that) Appetizer: salmon poke was spicy with notably fresh fish. Grilled octopus was perfectly moist and complimented by pickled radish for a salty tangy combo. Highly recommended both Entree: pork belly MELTED IN MY MOUTH the silkiest fat I have ever had. Like butter absolutely incredible. And the steak entree cooked perfectly at medium rare but smaller portion than I would hope.  Both a MUST TRY. Dessert: coconut sundae was okay but the graham cracker made it sensational. So the reason this rating is 4.5 instead of 5 is because of the SERVICE of one guy who was total shit.

Poké has become a bit of a fad, and even when we were in Hawaii last year, some places drown it in soy and mayo. Nothing could be further from the truth at Noreetuh. The portion was a bit small, but really fresh and tasty. The type of seaweed served with it was interesting: almost a carpaccio of sea-broccoli that had been lightly blanched. The dried seaweed and sesame sprinkles on the rice were also delicious. We also had the loco moco, though in this case, made with fried chicken. It was moist and crispy (thigh meat), with a savory gravy and two perfectly-cooked eggs. We also had the dumplings, which are petite yet crispy and tasty. Service was friendly and attentive. They could use a more extensive drink menu, such as a mai tai, though I suspect that their liquor license is limited. Beers from Maui Brewery would also be a plus. All in all though, we really liked it. We'll be back!",0,0,0,Food Jerk X.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,130,63
5.0,6/18/2017,"Noreetuh is easily one of the best dining experiences I have ever had.Hawaiian food has burst onto the scene in the city because of the poke craze, but among the top 10 Yelp results for Hawaiian food, Noreetuh is the only one that is not a primarily poke restaurant. I knew I had to try it out, and after over a year of discovering it I finally went for dinner.First off the service was incredible! Our server Maria took great care of us from start to finish, including suggesting the prix fixe menu to save a few dollars and share more plates and making sure our water glasses were never less than half full. It also happened that my friend knew the owner, which helped us land a complimentary dessert and dessert wines.On to the food! Starting with snacks, we got the pork jowl musubi and mochiko chicken wings - both were stellar. The musubi was the perfect temperature and incredibly succulent so that the rice would soak up the juices. The chicken wings were surprisingly bright thanks to the incorporation of both calamansi and chili to balance the spice with some citrus.For starters we ordered the monkfish liver torchon and soft-shell crab tempura. The torchon is immediately up there with one of the best single dishes I have ever had. The liver, spread over a perfect warm buttered piece of king's Hawaiian bread, exploded with umami, quite literally tasting like a piece of the best Hokkaido uni. It is unquestionably one of my favorite two or three dishes of all time. Not to be outdone, the crab was wonderfully presented and even better prepared, crunchy to the core.Mains were next, and we had the spam agnolotti and the pineapple braised pork belly. Now, I have had my fair share of pork belly over the years, and this one was up there with the best of them. If only I could have pineapple with every meal.... Meanwhile the spam was fried to a crisp, almost like bacon, while the agnolotti were fairly traditional and very filling. The dish was probably the only one on the night that didn't quite work as the fiddlehead ferns in the agnolotti were an interesting choice, but still a solid dish.Somehow we left room for dessert, and the chocolate haupia sundae was wondrous - the perfect mix of sweet (graham crackers, coconut ice cream, and whipped cream) and salty (almonds). On the other hand, the crispy mochi waffles was very cool visually and conceptually, but probably a tad bit heavy after such a great meal.It probably comes as no surprise if you've read this far that I loved Noreetuh (as did my lovely friend). With a star-studded menu, extensive wine list, and flawless service, Noreetuh is still a hidden gem tucked away on First Avenue just off of bustling St. Mark's. With food this good, I have a feeling this little secret won't be such a secret for long.",2,0,0,Arthur C.,"Manhattan, NY",448,257,54

5.0,6/6/2017,"In short: One of the best dinners I've had in a really, really long time - incredible! What we ate: We started with the big-eye tuna poke (which the chef prepares with macadamia nuts, jalapeño, and seaweed), as well as the seasonal soft-shell crab tempura with soy-pickled ramps (incredible). For our entrees, we had the mentaiko spaghetti with aonori, smoked cod, and chili;the pineapple braised pork belly; and the wagyu beef with Chinese broccoli and fried rice. Honestly, all 3 of us agreed it was impossible to pick a favorite dish. Dessert was also pretty fabulous: the upside down pineapple cake (a special) and the mochi waffles with peanut butter. The one area I feel could be improved is the ambience. The wooden honeycomb design elements are lovely, but aside from that, it feels a little cold - which is a disservice to the magic of the restaurant's food, friendly service, and Aloha heritage. That said, it is definitely only a minor note, and might even be addressed by some simple floral arrangements. The bathroom sign, however, is awesome (see photo). Overall, a must-go!

We went one Sunday afternoon around 12 and we were seated immediately. Almost all tables were full by 12:30. We ordered the Hawaiian breakfast and Spam Masubi. It's hard to pay $7 for - few slices of spam, rice, and seaweed - but it's just sooo good!!! We also had the pineapple brûlée for dessert. It was sweet, and torched perfectly.

It also came with two sunny-side up eggs, which was great with the rice. The portion size was really big and I was super full when I finished it all. We also had their Hawaiian Breakfast and Big-Eye Tuna Poke Bowl and both were really good as well. All the portions were really big and I think we were all very full when we finished. Not full enough, however, to have their Bruleed Pineapple! I really enjoyed it because it was sweet and a bit salty at the same time.

The kalua pork melted in my mouth and wasn't overly salty like I've found other places. The service was great - prompt drink refills, helpful advice, friendly banter. One California transplant provided helpful tips on Cal alum hangouts for my dining companion, who is also an alum.

5.0,3/19/2017,"This is a long overdue update to my previous reviews.  Noreetuh keeps getting better and my meal last night is proof.  Keeping true to the menu's Hawaiian influence, Chef Chow shows his craftsmanship with a Spam agnolotti (a small wonton shaped pasta) by enhancing the savory goodness of the humble Spam luncheon meat (so beloved by the 50th state) with an infusion of aromatic truffle in a cream sauce and showering a generous amount of shaved winter black truffle on top (lest you forget what you were tasting in the bowl).  The saltiness of the Spam and tang of the pickled celery penetrate the luxurious earthiness of the truffle making it a classic marriage of my favorite flavors.  I am aghast by the fact that it is part of the $42 3-course prix fixed menu.  What a gift to those who love truffles and homemade pastas!  Other favorites are the grilled octopus, big eye tuna poke and the mochiko chicken wings calamansi and chili.  There is so much complexity in the flavors of all the dishes that your taste buds are constantly being stimulated!  A new musubi made with pig jowl and an coating of ginger scallion oil is a brilliant combination of traditional Chinese flavoring with a favorite Hawaiian/Japanese snack and is a must try.  The spicy tuna musubi is another new addition that does not fail.  Brava Chef Chow for your dynamic menu and execution of the best ingredients with a Hawaiian twist.",0,0,0,Wailana W.,"New York, NY",59,309,1103

5.0,3/2/2017,"For my 100th review (that took a while) I've decide to review my first (and so far only) Restaurant Week experience (that also took way too long). I came here about a month ago with my boyfriend to celebrate our two year anniversary. After looking through the many restaurants offering RW deals, I've narrowed it down to three and my bf chose Noreetuh.We walked in on a somewhat cold night, a few minutes before our reservation and were seated right away. It was a Sunday evening so the restaurant wasn't yet full, but had a few tables seated. The restaurant looks smaller than it really is, a few tables once you enter and some two seat ones by the wall, which is across from a bar. Only once I walked toward the bathroom, which is nice btw, I've noticed that there is a second room basically identical in size to the main one, minus the bar. The decor is pretty simple and can be completely ignored in the dimly lit space.A waiter came to us with the menus not long after we were seated. Since I looked at the menu before coming here, it didn't take us long to place our orders. We did have to place them all at once.For a first course, I ordered the big-eye tuna poke (with macadamia nuts, pickled jalapenos and seaweed). It was very fresh and flavorful, and just filling enough considering I still had more coming. My bf got the mushroom tempura (with sweet miso dip), I have had some of it and it was also very good. For a main I got the chow noodles (smoked tofu, jalapeno, mushrooms, onion, cilantro). It was a refreshing dish that tasted healthy and had some positively surprising flavors. The bf got the pineapple braised pork belly and enjoyed it a lot. For dessert, I got the bruleed Hawaiian pineapple (lime zest,'alaea salt) and he got the chocolate haupia sundae. The pineapple was just the right amount of sweetness but the chocolate haupia was one of the best desserts I have ever tasted. The Service was very attentive and warm throughout, someone other than our waiter came out with the dishes and explained to us what each dish was. The music was relatively low but we could still hear it, it was relaxing and we could easily have a conversation. I truly enjoyed this experience, and hope to be back sometime soon.",1,1,1,Irina D.,"Hoboken, NJ",35,135,89

Very friendly and attentive wait staff.Spam Musubi was good but not mindblowing or spectacular, you can make same at home probably. Big Hawaiian Breakfast was big indeed. Everything was cooked just perfectly and the presentation was fantastic. However I feel like the dish overall could have used something a bit sour to the match the savoriness of overall plate.The tiny bit of kimchi that comes with it wasn't quite enough. The Hawaiian French Toast was way way too sweet for my liking. It was drenched in whipped cream. Do not get this as a main unless you really have a super sweet tooth. Best to be shared with at least 2 and probably closer to 3 people. Nice decor and atmosphere.Would go back again to try their poke.",1,0,0,daniel y.,"New York, NY",11,7,0

Noreetuh offered the prie-fixed course we decided to get, which included snacks, starters and entree. There is wine pairing for a separate price, however we decided on getting a bottle of Sparkling wine. For snacks, we choose the Beef Tongue Musubi and Silken Tofu. The Beef Tongue Musubi were savory, flavorful and delicious. I love it and will be coming back for more. Follow by starters, we chose the Tuna Poke and Grilled Octopus. Then for our entree, we have the Hanger Steak and Uni Spaghetti. The steak was cooked to perfection with delicious pesto sauce. And the Uni Spaghetti was creamy and exquisite.

5.0,2/14/2017,"Absolutely loved our experience! Food was great, service was kind and attentive, atmosphere was nice and cozy.We went for the Restaurant week 2017 menu of starter/main/dessert - note that they have a regular prix fixe menu at $42 for dinner even when it's not during the official RW time, the only difference is that instead of dessert you have a choice of snacks to start.For starters, we shared the silken tofu (Santa Barbara uni, ikura, shiso) and the big eye tuna poke (macadamia nut, pickled jalapeño, seaweed). We mentioned to our server that my partner is allergic to nuts and shellfish and they were able to accommodate with the nuts on the side. The tuna poke was the standout because of how fresh and perfectly marinaded it was. The pickled jalapeño was unique and I liked that they used different colored (NATURAL looking) seaweed. None of that bright green seaweed salad you get at many sushi/poke places. It was a beautiful dish, too bad we were in the dark! The tofu was good but not $22 for a la carte good! For the main, I got the mentaiko spaghetti with smoked cod, aonori (dried seaweed flakes), and chili. LOVED and DEVOURED this dish. I normally get pretty sick of creamy sauce pasta very quickly but every bite was amazing. Decent amount of smoked cod, the mentaiko and aonori added great texture, and the pasta was cooked al dente. There was the option to add uni for $8, which I didn't because I figured we already had uni in our silken tofu. Plus, I don't think it would have really elevated the dish because uni actually has a pretty subtle taste and is best enjoyed on its own (like in sushi).My boyfriend'a Mochi crusted bass with pole bean, Chinese bacon, and fermented black bean was alright in my opinion, but maybe that's because I don't like anything breaded (and I liked my main too much to pay much attention to his). His fish was a little on the smaller side when we compared to other people around us getting the same thing, but we did leave full so that's not really a problem! Mochi sounds cool but we didn't see a difference between what was on the fish and normal panko. The fish by itself is pretty bland while the sauce the beans were sautéed in was pretty salty, so you have to eat them together. For dessert, I got the brûléed pineapple with lime zest and alea salt. I loved it because pineapple is my favorite fruit and it satisfied all my dessert cravings. The salt was a nice touch. A pretty delicious dish but probably not worth to pay a la carte - it is just fancy fruit after all. My boyfriend got the chocolate haupia sundae with almonds (on the side), graham crackers, and coconut ice cream. Drizzled with caramel sauce. We loved it! And he normally doesn't like coconut flavored things! The chocolate haupia is the gelatinous/mousse-like chocolate cubes. They could go less heavy on the whipped cream though - the ice cream is the star.

We wanted something different so the Hawaiian concept was something fresh for both of us. The space was very cute and the service was great despite the new team. The menu was very thoughtful and came with wine pairing that we really enjoyed. The highlight was the lobster salad and uni mentaiko spaghetti. My boyfriend is not a seafood eater but he was adventurous enough to try these two dishes (he had to opt out of the fluke sashimi, which I devoured both servings. Loved the tartness of the passionfruit, very refreshing). It was his first time eating lobster (I know! I can't believe it either) and mentaiko and he absolutely loved it. He still won't eat lobster elsewhere, worrying it will ruin his experience. He did offer his uni on the pasta to me and I did not refuse (more for me!)  However, I did not tell him what mentaiko was before he eat the pasta and he is a huge fan of pasta so half way through I told him about the fish roe and he was still ok with it because it was so tasty.  Because of that, noreetuh will always hold a special place in our hearts!",2,1,2,Nancy N.,"New York, NY",358,165,409

They were actually surprisingly empty for a restaurant week evening! The restaurant week menu was impressive - and the main reason why I chose this restaurant in the first place. I had the tuna poke (of course) for my appetizer, the angus steak for my entree, and the bruleed pineapple for dessert. My friend ordered the silken tofu, mochi-crusted bass, and the bread pudding. Everything was delicious! True to restaurant week fashion, all of the servings are sample-sized (definitely on the smaller end), so you should expect to snack before or grab a fourth-meal after. However, I did appreciate that everything was very thoughtfully prepared and presented.Of everything we ordered, the angus steak was probably the stand-out dish for the night. My friend was actually quite disappointed that he had ordered the bass instead of the steak, but we had decided to order different items so that we could sample more of the menu. I also found the tuna poke to be very fresh and nicely marinated, but was slightly disappointed with the silken tofu appetizer because of the tiny portions and the fact that it was literally tofu in a bowl sprinkled with some roe. Overall, I think I was most disappointed with my dessert, which was literally a fourth of a pineapple that had been torched. It didn't even make for great pictures because it was so dark in the restaurant! I don't know if Noreetuh is a restaurant that I would highly recommend to friends or family, but it is a nice East Village establishment that could easily impress a date or help celebrate an accomplishment. I'm definitely glad that I got to try it during restaurant week!",4,2,4,Sherry L.,"San Francisco, CA",893,1172,889
3.0,1/7/2017,"I was really excited to try this place because of it's impressive pedigree of former Per Se chefs. Unfortunately I wasn't all that impressed.We opted for the 2 sets of the 3 course prix fixe ($42/pp) where you pick dishes off of a shortened menu. [FOOD]Truffle Taro Chips - I love taro and truffle so naturally I enjoyed these but they were overly salty. Most of the truffle shavings were stuck to the chips on top so the bottom ones didn't get any of the love. I wouldn't order these a la carte given the hefty price ($12). Honestly they should just nix the truffle and reduce the price significantly.Corned Beef Tongue Musubi - This was an interesting take, but I personally prefer the traditional spam musubi. Also, the cilantro sauce was pretty flavorless. Again, I tasted mostly saltiness.Grilled Octopus - Great char on the octopus. It came with fingerling potatoes that were coated with tobiko mayo. Delicious!Monkfish Liver Torchon - This was delicious! It comes with slices of grilled hawaiian bread. My only issue was that that monkfish liver was pretty solid so it wasn't actually spreadable on the bread.Mochi-crusted Bass - This was the star of the meal hands down. I didn't know what to expect from ""mochi-crusted"" but it turned out to be similar to a panko-coating around the fish. The green beans were also perfectly crunchy and delicious. The Chinese bacon, however, was too salty so it was the only thing we left on the plate.  Mentaiko spaghetti - Usually this dish is made with cod roe, but here they added actual salted cod which made it so much more flavorful. This was the only dish we weren't able to finish because we wanted to leave room for dessert. I microwaved the leftovers the next day and I swear it tasted even better the second time.King's hawaiian bread pudding ($8) - The outside was crispy and delicious but the inside was too soft and borderline mushy. The pineapple ice cream was delicious and I wish it was a larger scoop. The raisins were too strong in rum flavor for my taste. [TIP]To get the most bang for your buck, I highly recommend going with the 3 course dinner option. We saved $19 between the two of us by not ordering a la carte, and still got to try everything we wanted from the main menu. It comes with a lot of food so we were both pretty full before we even got to the main course dishes.",6,2,3,Lucy N.,"New York, NY",704,319,4054

3.0,11/30/2016,"The bestie and I excitedly came here one evening. The place is much smaller than we had originally anticipated. Unfortunately I had a small rolling carry-on that I had to squeeze in between my neighbor and me, but it didn't seem to cause that much trouble. For some reason, we were under the impression that we could get cocktails here. (Maybe the Hawaiian menu had us thinking fruity, boozy concoctions?) Nonetheless, we decided on a bottle of sparkling instead that was really good. From the menu, we both decided to do the prix fixe and share our 3 courses together. For appetizers, I got the wings while she got the squash tempura. The wings had a bold citrus flavor with a little spicy kick to them, which we enjoyed. The sweet, mild flavor of squash was a little lost in a heavy fried batter and the strong flavors from bonito. Next, I got the octopus and she got the tuna poke (surcharge). There were decent but not special. My friend had recently come back from Hawaii (perhaps how we ended up here in the first place), and she was sorely underwhelmed. The tuna poke, especially, had a lot of flavors going on that didn't necessarily let the tuna shine through. After all the rave about the uni tagliatelle with roe, we ordered it (surcharge) but were sorely disappointed. The bright orange color was almost-concerning vibrant and the aroma was unappealingly fishy. We had a couple bites, which were rich and salty/briny, and guiltily got the rest to go. To be adventurous, I got the spam agnolotti as my entree. This was also a little disappointing because the spam seemed to be ground with other types of meat that made the flavor underwhelming, especially with the heavy truffle. I felt like I was eating regular ol' Italian pasta dish. Given our meal, we decided to skip dessert even though some of them sounded good.. For the price, this wasn't necessarily worth it.

5.0,11/23/2016,"Came here for restaurant week some time back and the experience was just excellent. First of all, it was a challenge to secure a reservation at a decent time, but I kept checking and managed to get a slot for 8:30. The place was packed when we got there, and I was worried we were gonna get cramped into a tight table, but we got led back into a separate room where we got a quiet table away from the noise.The restaurant week menu is one of the better ones out there, with a decent number of options. I got the Hawaiian heart of palm salad, the Mentaiko spaghetti, and a fruit and mochi dessert I forgot the name of. Everything was delicious. Loved the combination of the hearts of palm with the toasted hazelnuts. The spaghetti with smoked cod was crazy flavorful and I couldn't get enough of it. The dessert was also delicious.Service was impeccable and we enjoyed everything. The only complaint I would say is that there is only one bathroom for the entire restaurant and it was a bit of a wait. But otherwise I'd happily recommend this place and go back.",3,1,3,Steph C.,"Brooklyn, NY",478,767,323
3.0,11/1/2016,"The best plate we had was the vegetable tempura, which is an appetizer. That was really good, but also something that arguably shouldn't be the standout dish in a (almost) fancy restaurant. The uni with silky tofu was not up my alley so I'll pass on commenting that. The pasta with pulled pork was weird - I get it's a fusion dish, but the pasta was still overcooked and kinda drowning in liquid. Also not sure the flavors - smokiness of the pork and cheese on the pasta - really worked that well together. Still, good effort.",1,0,0,Vanni P.,"San Jose, CA",138,574,2

He randomly chose some wines for us that went nicely with our meal. Standouts above all else were the musubi. We had a corn special and the regular beef tongue from the menu. Better than expected. Shrimp Poké followed-just a little over salted but palatable and tasty. Then we had cod and chow fun. Flavors were great.  Both cooked perfectly.Nothing knocked me off my seat but it was a good meal.

Chow noodles are pretty much flavorless except for a high dose of salt, and the kabocha tempura is approximately 100% breading plus oil and 0 kabocha. But the chocolate haupia sundae is by far the best sundae I have ever had. WTF is haupia and why is it soooooo amazing? Its texture is like a mousse and works perfectly with the almond slices, graham cracker crisps and ice cream. I couldn't stop myself from spooning into the bowl until I basically licked it. I probably wouldn't come back to this place but will surely remember that sundae forever and ever.",3,2,3,Joy Y.,"New York, NY",266,824,1216
3.0,10/7/2016,"Disclaimer: Review is based on a 2016 Summer Restaurant Week experience, however I suspect their are many parallels with the Restaurant Week dining experience and regular dining experience as most of their RW menu items are their most popular dishes.Outside of Spam, homemade loco moco's, and giving in to NYC's latest poke craze, I'm not at all familiar with Hawaiian food. So elevated high end Hawaiian cuisine seemed like a unique and interesting dining experience to try. Refined and modern is a good way to describe the decor. Clean metal chairs and wooden tables make up most of the furniture. Tastefully shying away from the typical Hawaiian decoration tropes, you won't find Luau or Tiki themed anything here. Instead, the homages to Hawaii are expressed in small pictures and a beautiful tiled wall that is a of course a nod to the turtle- one of Hawaii's treasured animals. We had a few servers during our visit, but our main waiter was especially memorable. He was polite, knowledgeable about the food menu and wine list, upbeat, and even playful at times.Our food went as follows:Appetizers:Big Eye Tuna Poke with pickled jalepenos, macadamia nuts, and seaweed. It was crisp and fresh. The macadamia nuts gave it some much needed texture, while the pickled jalepenos gave it some acidity and slight spice. I will say the chef was a little heavy handed with the sesame oil though.Silken Tofu with Uni, ikura, shiitake mushroom, and shiso. Light and refreshing, I think this dish looks better than it tastes. The uni, which I was told was sourced from Maine was a little too briny and a touch bitter. The tofu and ikura were perfect, but there was something (maybe the shiitake) that give it a strong savory anise flavor. Too many components not working in harmony.Entrees:Black Angus Steak with grilled romaine, sesame, red onion, and taro gratin. The steak itself was cooked perfectly, and the taste had a satisfying gamey quality that was unapologetic about being red meat. The pickled red onions were a nice touch, and I loved loved loved the taro gratin. However the grilled romaine was a complete joke, the charring did little for the flavor, and the outer portion became limp and wilted.Mentaiko Spaghetti with smoked butterfish, aonori, chili. Creamy, briny, and slightly spicy, I can see why this dish is a fan favorite at Noreetuh. There is a smoky quality to the dish that comes from the butterfish that is smoked in house. A lot of people like to call mentaiko pasta the carbonara of the sea, I really like that description for it. If you've never had it before, Noreetuh has one of the best interpretations of it.Dessert:Bruleed Pineapple with sea salt and lime zest. This was another one of those, looks great but I'll probably never order it again dishes. The whole dish was a pedestrian and forgettable. The bruleed layer added a touch of saltiness which theoretically would have rounded out the pineapple, but the pineapple itself was much more tart than sweet. Disappointing.Kings Hawaiian bread pudding. Another L with this dessert. The custard soaked bread tastes more like bad French toast than it did bread pudding. The raisins were off and unnecessary. And the generic ice cream was unimaginative and effortless.Noreetuh is as much a wine destination as it is a food one. You'll find some really good (and even rare) wines at accessible prices here. The most value comes from the higher priced items though. While I am impressed with the wine selection overall, I don't feel as if the wine list has been curated with the cuisine in mind. Rather, it feels like a hodgepodge of quality wines that owner Jin Ahn prefers. There are some harmonious food and wine pairings here that truly deliver, but such marriages are few and far between.Hawaiian food and culture as a whole is a mismatch and blend of different cultures. Noreetuh certainly embodies that mixture of different influences and inspirations. There are lots of moving parts that sometimes help and other times hurt the final product. The result is a sometimes beautiful, mostly confusing, but unequivocally unique dining experience. There is certainly room in NYC for refined modern Hawaiian cuisine.",5,2,2,Jonathan N.,"New York, NY",72,66,361
3.0,10/7/2016,"3.5/5 stars with room for improvementCute little restaurant currently serving 3 course for $42 including a snack, appetizer and an entree. I would say that without the deal, dishes are on the pricier side for east village. Generally, they were quite delicious, but not wow amazing. Their big-eye tuna poke and pork chop were good. The portions were satisfying and maybe on the bigger side for someone with a smaller stomach. The grilled octopus was let-down. Not charred enough and too tough on the inside. Can't believe it was recommended to us ;(. This is usually my go-to dish to gauge how good a restaurant is at making ""cooked"" seafood and indeed, the sea bass was just alright.I would say that noreetuh does its fresh fish and meats well, but could perhaps work a little on its cooked seafood.

4.0,10/1/2016,"Having never been to Hawaii, and only hearing glancing stories of dishes like poi, lau lau, and hamburger over rice, I said yes immediately to Noreetuh. Guys, this is why living in the East Village can be awesome, once you get past the rank smell of weed at every corner. Our waiter was incredibly friendly, chatting with my friend over where the prime real estate in Hawaii was (Kona over Honolulu, but you didn't hear it from me), and the menu looked adventurous enough without scaring away someone who has never tried uni before (in other words, there's also steak, chicken, and lamb to balance out all the fish entrees). I only wish we got to try more things: we had the crispy mushrooms with miso sauce, the heart of palm salad, and the sea urchin tagliatelle. Oh the three, the pasta was the clear winner - I've never tried the Italian-Japanese combo of uni spaghetti, but this was absolutely amazing. Buttery, insanely rich, it came in a portion that was just right. Any more would have been way too heavy. Heart of palm salad was refreshing and crunchy, with oranges and hazelnuts, but I would skip the mushrooms. They were nice and fried, but the mushroom pieces were a little too large to bite through gracefully. My only tip is to feature some cocktails on the drink menu. Noreetuh currently offers wine and beer, but I would imagine there to be so much room to play around with Hawaiian themed cocktails.

The price $45 for pre fix dinner, 3 course(snack, starter, entree) is way too generous compare what they offer. Every dish was very flavorful and detail focused, I was really impressed how they can execute this food for that price. The portion size they offer is just another level of generosity here. Trust me, I and my husband, we eat like food fighters but after starter, we were so happily full, could not finish even the half of the entree!! Tuna poke, was to die for, squash tempura and chix wing were mouth watering!!!! Top of that, the wine and beer recommendation from the owner/Gm, Jin went perfectly well with all the dish selection we had. They do have a very well selected wine/sake/beer list, very unique and well paired with the food here.Pork porterhouse and the uni pasta!! We were so sad that the fact we were not able to finish it only because we were already so full from first two course....but they were nice enough to pack rest of food to go.The service was very attentive and professional, nothing to surprise considering the GM here has a long term fine dining background.The dessert. Omg, we were so full to try as many as we would like, but, You should definitely check it out the pineapple dessert, so refreshing and light and sweet! Just perfect to finish the meal. Overall, I would definitely go back to try other dishes here since the spam dish looked so good on the next table to us.

They have more seating in the back, which is where we sat. They had a regular dinner menu, a la carte or a pre fixed menu where you can choose a snack, starter and entree for $42. If you wanted the uni tofu, you had to add an additional $10. We all chose to order the pre fixe. Most of us chose the uni tofu which was pretty damn good. The tofu really had a silk texture and the uni was sweet, fresh and delicious. I chose the taro chips for snack. It was only okay. I wasn't too impressed. For starters, we chose the shrimp poke, tuna poke, and octopus. I thought the shrimp was fresh and flavor was pretty good, but my friend thought it was too salty. The tuna was delicious. I should have ordered the tuna, but I got the octopus which was okay. It's kind of what you expect, grilled octopus. Didn't really have much flavor to it. As for entrees, most of us picked the spaghetti which I thought was pretty good. It had a pretty creamy texture. My friends thought it was also too salty. My other friend ordered the black Angus and she said that was too salty, but I didn't think so. My other friend ordered the spam agnolotti and that was my least favorite.

I did not get to see the other side of the dining room but I was situated in a cute little two top and made my way into deciding what to try for the night. They were offering restaurant week, sweet! I really tried not to order everything on the menu but I opted for the restaurant week deal and then added some items from their adventurous menu. They also offer a 3 course prix-fixe menu daily for dinner. I loved the wine list! great selection on the wines by the glass, sake and beers on draft. They have hitachino nest on draft! Always love a place that offers fever tree ginger ale. Depending on my mood, I love wine pairings but tonight I was feeling a bit picky. After two glasses, I thought that I should have probably ordered a bottle instead. The truffle taro chips were so good but I wished it came in a bigger portion. The silken tofu was a bit disappointing and lacked some flavor. I had high expectations for the corned beef tongue musubi. It was alright, not amazing. I did not know how to appreciate the flavors in the tuna poke, it could have been the pickled jalapenos but I'm not sure. I wanted all these other appetizers, it was so tough to choose! The mentaiko spaghetti was ordinary but the black angus steak was surprisingly delicious. The grilled romaine with sesame seeds on the dish was so simple yet had great flavors to it and the taro really added to the dish. The foie gras of the sea, Monkfish liver with passionfruit jelly and pear paired with amazing bread. It was the absolute best monkfish liver dish I have ever had. The liver was super rich and creamy. It is a very particular combination so only go for it if you love monkfish liver. The bruleed hawaiian pineapple with lime zest and alaea salt was one of the best desserts I have ever had. The sundae was pretty good too and it was served with the best coconut ice cream ever. The crispy mochi waffles were disappointing though.

Then for desset we had the chocolate haupia sundae and the bruleed hawaiian pineapple.Each and every dish was incredibly delicious and so unusual . What a treasure to have this special nouveau-Hawaiian restaurant in NYC!",3,0,2,Rima F.,"New York, NY",181,439,14
5.0,8/15/2016,"I have been there several times and it's like per se at bargain prices! I am not usually big on Hawaiian food but this restaurant may just change my mind. The chef has shown great creativity and imagination in successfully marrying traditional Hawaiian to high end cuisine, all at very reasonable prices. The food is refined and delicious. I especially love the tuna poke and the spam agnolotti. The wine selection is also fun with a sense of adventure - complex and yet not bombastic",0,0,0,Michele C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0
3.0,8/13/2016,"Food was good, owner was unprofessional and yelled at his staff in front of customers.Our courteous waiter made a mistake taking down our order and subsequently offered the mistaken appetizer on the house.  Shortly after, the entire restaurant hears the owner yelling at him.  Both us and the table next to us felt uncomfortable after the incident.  It ruined our dining experience for the rest of the night and we couldn't help but feel bad for our waiter.While I understand the difficulty of running a profitable business, yelling at your staff in front of customers is amateur and uncalled for.  Will probably not return for another meal.",4,2,0,Wayne L.,"Chicago, IL",2,1,0

I really enjoyed their appetizers, they were the right amount of unique without tasting too weird. My favorite was the uni silken tofu and the Mochi crusted fish. The pineapple Creme brûlée was exceptional. I will definitely come back again to try their regular menu!

Restaurant week menu is a lot of food- went home stuffed and didn't even finish dessert!Apps: Had the kalua pork croquettes which were alright and not as good as the reviews billed- just an average fried minced pork dish. If you want BIG portions of fried items, get the crispy mushrooms!Entree: The pasta was highlight of the night. My fiancé got the Chow Noodles (only vegetarian option) and she equally loved them.Dessert: Chocolate Haupia Sundae was great- the pieces of chocolate hit the spot and were like bombs of flavor in your mouth.

5.0,8/10/2016,"This is a very special place. It is restaurant week and we were lucky to book a table on this hot, steamy night. Walking into the restaurant was a relief from the city street: the decor is relaxing yet exudes formal attention to detail. It feels fancy-ish in a good way. We met one of the co-owners, Jin, who is warm and delightful and explained the concept of the restaurant as Hawaiian-Korean fusion. The food was prepared with loving care and with the wine pairings, we really felt like we were in Hawaii as the careful choice of fusion and flavors took us on a tropical journey. To start we had tuna poke, shrimp poke and hearts of palm salad. Our entrees were the bass which was prepared with a light crust over perfectly cooked green beans and my dining partner had pork with cavatelli. Both were excellent!Our server, Daniel, was so kind and helpful. His enthusiasm for the dishes and our enjoyment of the flavors felt sincere and added to feeling welcome. We will go back.

Had the shrimp poke app, it was good but tasted like an enhanced shrimp salad.Had the Octopus app, that was good, but one of the three pieces was very tough. The bass entree was good. The fish was cooked to perfection, soft and delicate with crispy skin. For dessert I had the ice cream sunday that was very good. Nice mixture of sweet and salty, but not too sweet at all. The staff was phenomenal. Everyone was helping each other out. I saw one guy who was bringing food out, cleaning tables, bringing new silverware after each serving, going behind the bar to grab drinks.

We were a group of 8 and took advantage of the restaurant's zero corkage policy on Sundays to try this out.  I am definitely going back!",0,1,0,Stephen M.,"New York, NY",6,109,23
4.0,7/27/2016,"Came to Noreetuh for restaurant week and tried the 3-course pix-fixe menu for $42 (though I think this is the same as their regular menu)Each came with 1 appetizer, 1 entree, and a dessert. There was an optional wine pairing for $25 but I did not select this option. I can't speak much to Hawaiian cuisine, but seemed as if Noreetuh was a modern, fusion twist on the traditional. Many complex flavors and profiles was much appreciated. Small serving sizes made you leave feeling good about yourself (e.g., not bloated), though also left with an un-bloated wallet (read: semi-high prices). We added an additional appetizer and I would recommend all three: 1. Big-eye tuna poke2. Two specials of the day, 1 was a salmon sashimi that had a flavorful 'crust' was interestingly paired with tomato raisins. The other was a white fish crudo served with strawberries! Entrees:The butterfish and spaghetti entree was very good, and although carb-heavy did not feel like too muchThe mochi-crusted bass was tender with a crunchy coating served over green beans and ""chinese bacon""..not sure what that means but it was good.DessertKing's Hawaiian Bread Pudding-very good, the rum-soaked raisins were definitely drunk!Bruleed Pineapple- a lighter dessert, served less than a quarter of a pineapple with bruleed sugar. It was good, but left me craving more for dessert.",2,1,1,Nicole G.,"New York, NY",272,169,109
4.0,7/14/2016,"Very tasty food, enhanced by extremely solicitous service. We especially loved the starters: the corned beef tongue musubi and the octopus poke. Both were clever takes on the namesake dishes, and the poke was a much larger portion that we had been expecting. We also had the garlic shrimp with rice, lettuce and pineapple, which was on the simpler side compared to some of the other choices but was well prepared and satisfying after the richness of the musubi and poke. Spam agnolotti was our other dish, and the only thing that I wouldn't order again--very bland, although the texture of the pasta was perfect.",0,0,0,Hester B.,"New York, NY",3,76,1

4.0,7/11/2016,"My boyfriend and I came here after a play. We had early reservations so the restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived at 5:30. We decided to do the 3-course prefix and shared our starting courses. We first had the crispy mushrooms and tempura squash. Both were tasty and I liked the variety of mushrooms but I felt the dishes, though small, were very heavy and had a lot of dough. Next we had the monkfish liver pâté and tuna poke. The pâté was paired with an excellent passion fruit marmalade and came with little pieces of warm bread. The tuna was good but the seaweed paired with it was slightly overwhelming and didn't stand out. For the main course I had the lamb and my boyfriend had the pork belly. He said he enjoyed the pork belly. The lamb was from the saddle and very tender. The sausage with the lamb had excellent flavor as well. For dessert we tried the mochi waffle with peanut butter which was an interesting and enjoyable combination. They do not serve espresso, only coffee and teas.

5.0,7/6/2016,"I've been craving Hawaiian food for the longest time! I finally got my fix at Noreetuh!My friend and I came on a Saturday at 12:30pm. No wait, which is always nice. :P They open at 12pm, but they serve brunch! FOOD: Spam Musubi- spam, rice, teriyaki sauce wrapped in seaweed you think that you can make this at home but somehow it tastes better here. It came with some refreshing light pickles, sesame seeds included. Mochiko LOCO MOCO This is what I came for!! and it succeeded my expectations. Crispy Chicken was softened with the smooth and deep flavor of the gravy. It came with -two balls of rice topped with furikake (seaweed seasoning), -two aesthetically-pleasing sunny side up eggs, speckled with pepper-mayonaise induced macaroni pasta salad, it's sweet and works well with the fried chicken-a side of kimchi, a nice break from the heavier, heartier parts of the meal. My friend got Spam and sausage instead of the loco moco. She enjoyed her food as well. Complimentary black sesame shortbread cookies! Food Presentation on point! Big portions!

5.0,7/6/2016,"Amazing little find. Hard to locate because it doesn't have very good signage but a pleasant oasis on a hot summer evening. The decor is modern with nice touches that remind you that you're at a Hawaiian restaurant. The service is great and the wait staff are prompt with beverages/refills. The food is right up my alley. Ordered the silken tofu which was perfectly complimented with salty sea urchin roe, the shrimp starter was fresh and light with the right amount of crunch from scallions. Pork belly was nicely seasoned and reminded me of Chinese 5 spice rub. The one dish that had me thrown was the cold buckwheat noodles. I ordered it on a whim and couldn't be more surprised on how much I liked it. Perhaps it was a nice cold dish on a hot summer day or the perfect seasoning and balance of dashi but overall amazing.

4.0,7/4/2016,"Came here after with with a friend who had wanted to try this spot for awhile. It was tough to spot the restaurant with its understated facade, but I impressed with the overall ambience once I found it. The seating area is small and cozy, which would make it perfect for a date spot. I decided to go with the prix fixe for dinner ($42 for a snack, a starter, and a main course), which was reasonable for the amount of food you get and the flexibility it offers.For the snack and starter, I got the crispy mushrooms and the hawaiian heart of palms. The mushrooms were amazing, and I would definitely recommend them. The heart of palms salad was decent although it felt like it was lacking something in terms of flavor--the mandarin oranges topping add a great deal of flavor, yet I felt like there could have been something more. Next time, I would probably go with the octopus or the soft-shell crab.For the main dish, I went with the mochi-crusted black bass, which certainly lived up to expectations. It had the perfect amount of crunch to balance the tenderness of the bass. The fermented black beans and the Chinese bacon were great compliments to the dish.

The desserts were very inventive and knockout for taste. I think the only thing that fell short for me was the silken tofu, which didn't go too well with the uni (still, I love both ingredients enough to devour my portion anyway).

Food was absolutely supberb. Since we were a party of 8, major plus: able to sample each other plates! Some favorite plates:Silken tofu ($10 extra): uni from Hokkaido! + ikura (salmon roe) texture of everything for this dish ...was literally like silk...savored every precious bite! Crispy mushroom: simple as this sounds...was indeed very yummy...like comfort food. Mochiko chicken wings (& drumstick): succulent & calamansi & chili sauce...binded to chicken just right. Pineapple braised pork belly: no words can describe this perfectly made meat. You don't even taste the fat & combination texture was like butter...not overly sauced nor salty.Mentaiko spaghetti: another comfort food yum.. with butter fish, aonori (dried green seaweed) & chili... my only complaint: s/b more spaghetti added...since i had extra sauce left... King's Hawaiian bread pudding: best bread pudding i've tasted.. not too dense & hard. Rum raisins & pineapple ice cream added very nice touch.Bruleed Hawaiian pineapple: rich tasting given it's just pineapple.Chocolate Haupia sundae: heav-ven! Our server Maria was very knowlegeable with menu, patient & friendly. She was very thoughtful to ask which of  the boys (my nephews) birthday was being celebrated so a candle would be lit for bruleed pineapple (found out later). Very thoughtful gesture.Assisting waitstaff, & general manager, Jin were very attentive, friendly, patient & generous.

4.0,6/12/2016,"After a string of $$$ and $$$$ restaurants disappointing with bland food, finally there was Noreetuh to give hope. I was starting to fear that all these expensive restaurants were only able to charge so much based on their own hype. We started out with the Corned Beef Tongue Musubi which was very good.I had the Mochi-Crusted Black Bass which was cooked to perfection. It was just what I was looking for. My girlfriend had the Mentaiko Spaghetti, which was a bit too smokey for her, and even for me when I tasted it. The smokiness she said got better as she ate it more. Maybe her tastebuds just needed to adjust. She acknowledges that many people will really like how smokey it is, it was just a bit much for her tastes. So don't take this as a comment that you should avoid the dish because you may like it- many people on Yelp seem to. RESERVATION NOTE:They closed between lunch and dinner for a few hours, and don't have a ton of seating.

So unique and so interesting. And so yummy. If you've never had this, then you MUST come here and try it. It has a flavor reminiscent of blue claw crab guacamole if you know what that is.

The tofu was amazing and the texture was really lovely. The uni was kind of fishy, but neither of us are huge fans of uni so it's probably just our bias. The wings were awesome. The breading was really crispy and the sauce had a nice balance of sweet and savory.Our next course (the ""starters"") consisted of two different pokes: the big eye tuna poke and the octopus poke. The tuna was bright and fresh and not at all fishy. It had a sweet soy and sesame seasoning and the portion was quite generous. The octopus was lightly grilled until perfectly tender and it was served with baked beans, which was kind of odd but also worked nicely. The soft beans were a nice textural contrast with the octopus.For our mains, we shared the mentaiko spaghetti and the braised pork belly. The spaghetti was probably my favorite dish of the night. The pasta was cooked perfectly to al dente and had an unctuous fishy quality (in the best way possible). The pork belly was so tender it was just falling apart and was seasoned nicely.For dessert we shared the King's Hawaiian bread pudding. It was good but nothing to write home about. It's worth sharing for the experience.The staff were so smiley and the service was great.

4.0,5/2/2016,"This restaurant serves up modern Hawaiian fare in  a hip setting with subtle Hawaiian theme through out the restaurant. It's amazing how many tables they can pack into this small space! There's a bar area with seating and tables  adjacent to it.  In the next room over is a narrow corridor of tables for 2 and 2  or three larger tables for larger parties.  You are literally able to rub elbows with another party when sitting in this room! Our waitress was very nice.  She was helpful without being too intrusive. The menu is divided into 4 main sections: Snacks, Starters , Main, and Dessert. There is a 3 course Prix Fixe Menu daily for Dinner for $42.  You actually can save some money doing so if you are going to order many dishes anyway.  The portions are smallish,  so you won't over do it.  My wife and I ordered 2 -  3 course prefix plus another app. We are such pigs! We ordered corned cow tongue musubi,  truffle taro chips,  mochico chicken wings,  grilled octopus,  big eye tuna poke,  mochi crusted black bass,  and pineapple braised black bass. If  we come back,  we would definitely get the taro chips,  tuna poke,  pineapple pork belly.  They were all a hit! The other dishes were good not great.  The cow tongue musubi was good but I don't think i enjoy the macadamia nut crunch texture in it,  and I couldn't taste the cilantro sauce.  The mochico chicken wings had a good crispy outside but the citrusy glaze made it too messy to eat.  I've been to Hawaii and mochico chicken usually is dry.  The flavor was good but I didn't taste the chili. We didn't even get any wings on this dish! The grilled octopus was ok but texture was chewy.  I tried my wife's black bass  was cooked perfect but was a little bland. I'm glad i tried Noreetuh,  but like another reviewer noted,  was not totally blown away but definitely a great place to have dinner and drinks.

Items in descending order: -The pineapple was amazing, and I noticed that a lot of other patrons ordered it, as well. I'd be surprised to learn it isn't among the top few menu options here. It's seriously so good: the contrast between soft fruit and crunchy brulee is to die for.-The POG mimosa was an interesting and very topical take on the classic orange juice mimosa. I wouldn't say it was terribly innovative, though, as far as the universe of possibilities for brunch beverages goes, so I'd call it middle of the road.-The pork belly hash was somewhat underwhelming, as I feel like they over-rendered the pork belly and thus made it more like crackling than I'd expected. Personally, I'd have preferred that they'd gone the other direction on the pork belly.Overall, a decent brunch with one very solid pick, one middle-of-the-road pick, and one pick that I probably wouldn't go back to on my next visit.",0,0,0,Lorelei Y.,"New York, NY",283,351,169

Did you really need *more* to entice you?We were enticed by the prix fixe. Everything was creative and possibly more ""interesting"" than traditional. The silken tofu was so curious, with the melding of arguably similar mushy? textures with vastly different tastes. The monkfish liver torchon was a powerful dish. Anything on a hawaiian roll is pretty addictive, so fair warning! I smeared some of the soy mayonnaise from the square tempura on this concoction, and my date thought that was weird but it was kind of interesting. I'm a big fan of trying different sauces on everything. Honestly, the winner of the night was the mentaiko spaghetti. Neither of us expected this at all, and we ordered it with some apprehension.

3.0,4/24/2016,"Noreetuh has been on my radar for several months, and when I finally got to go, my excitement level was up to *here*. And perhaps that was its downfall - the hype built up my expectations and the food wasn't as mindblowing as I had hoped it'd be. It was good, surely, but not awesome.Crispy mushrooms - These were oyster mushrooms deep fried in crispy batter with a savory miso mayo dip. They were tasty, but you really couldn't have more than one or two because it was much too oily - oil wasn't hot enough, perhaps?Monkfish liver torchon - The monkfish liver suffered the same problem as the crispy mushroom. Tasty, fatty, and creamy, and I love the pairing of the pear and passionfruit, but there was a bit too much of it and I could have used less at a lower price.Sea urchin tagliatelle - I was torn between getting this and the mentaiko spaghetti, and I highly regretted my choice. I have a high tolerance for briny, fishy tastes (case in point: I eat sardines out a can and love ikura) but this was just way too fishy for me. There was something imbalanced about the dish - it could have used maybe a bit more richness or sweetness, but overall it just didn't cut it for me. At least they were generous with the sea urchin.Still, despite my expectations being not met, I would come back here and try the mentaiko spaghetti and hope that overturns my verdict. Service was great, and the manager Jin (twinsies!) showed gracious hospitality as well.",3,1,1,Jin C.,"New York, NY",36,1100,328

This uni was terrible, the fishiest uni ever and just didn't have the fresh buttery uni goodness that I found myself loving about this sea creature. I left all the uni's in the bowl and just ate the pasta. What a waste of money and not eating the best part, which I thought would have been the uni.E and I lives for bread pudding and I didn't even notice it on the menu, but we were a fan of the king's hawaiian bread pudding with rum raisins, pineapple ice cream.

The awesome:Glazed pork bellyMonkfish liver with passion fruitButterfish spaghetti The just OK:Truffle taro chips King's Bread puddingThe not-so-awesome:Silken tofu with Uni The monkfish liver was probably my favorite dish of the night. The savory flavor and smooth texture of the liver worked perfectly with the sweet passion fruit. The pork belly was also delicious and cooked to perfection, and the spaghetti was a totally unexpected and delightful melding of flavors. You've never had spaghetti like this! The truffle taro chips and bread pudding were less special. The chips tasted like something you could get at Whole Foods, and the bread pudding was a bit too firm and luke warm for me. The pineapple ice cream it was served with was also cloyingly sweet. I struggled with the silken tofu. I know this is one of their most popular dishes, so perhaps it's just me, but I felt it was almost too fishy. The uni, which I typically enjoy, overpowered the dish, and the tofu was just a little too watery for my liking. The service was impeccable.Overall, I'm glad I tried a new cuisine and would definitely come back to experience more of the menu, but I didn't leave as satisfied as I'd hoped.",2,4,1,Shannon G.,"Brooklyn, NY",213,311,69

I order the corned beef tongue musubi, big eye tuna poke and mochi-crusted bass from the prix fixe menu at $42 (plus $3 supp for the poke). The beef tongue was cooked perfectly, one piece was not enough! The musubi would've been better if they roasted the seaweed to give it some crisp. It, unfortunately, fell apart after a few bites. As a beef tongue lover, I would pass on this dish. I loved the variety of seaweeds in the poke. The tuna was fresh but was seasoned inconsistently. The few pieces that were well-seasoned was amazing. Overall the dish was refreshing but under seasoned to my tasting. I'm glad I chose the mochi-crusted bass as my entree, it was my favorite dish of the meal. The mochi crusting gave the fish extra crunch and crisp. Because the bass sat on top of sautéed string beans, the bottom crust of the fish became soggy and lost the crunchiness. The string beans were just as delicious as the fish. Sautéed in a vinegar sauce, it gave the string beans a perfect kick of acidity.",0,0,0,Michele H.,"Manhattan, NY",2,87,71

There were a few pieces that I really had to grind down; this was probably the only negative element of the dish. The eggs came very runny, which I love, and the toast was perfectly browned and had a nice sweetness to it. Pretty solid for $14! Funny enough, I came here with a Hawaiian friend, because I just had to get his opinion on the authenticity of the food! Overall, he seemed very satisfied with his Hawaiian breakfast, claiming that it was similar to what he made at home (I assume he meant ingredient-wise, probably not quality-wise).Noreetuh is a wonderful, slightly exotic option for either dinner or brunch!

5.0,3/13/2016,We decided to try this restaurant after reading the write- up in New York magazine. The atmosphere Is sleek and modern. The restaurant is divided into two rooms. The service is attentive and helpful. The manager was chatting with us and told us of the BYOB option on Sunday nights. Wine  by the glass is about $15 so BYOB Is attractive. The fried squash was highly rated so we ordered  one each - this is a dish to share as it is a bit heavy. It almost tastes like yucca fries but a much more sophisticated preparation and presentation. You could also share the tuna poke - delicious chunks of tuna with macadamia nuts and chili peppers. My husband did the $42 prix fixe. He had the spam agnolotti with celery and truffles - excellent - about a dozen pieces. I had crispy sea bass with beans and Chinese bacon - a generous piece of flaky tender fish lightly fried on one side with a heaping portion of beans. We were too full for dessert. I saw the noodle entree at another table - enough to share.

Our group of four shared everything and agreed almost 100% on all the dishes.  Most of the meal were hits, but there were a few major misses as well.  Here is a full breakdown.Truffle Taro Chips - 8/10.  Light, super crispy & delicious.  Truffle flavor is present but not overwhelming.Crispy Mushrooms - 7/10. Fried perfectly, but lacked a certain mushroom flavor.  Good but not a wow.Corn Beef Tongue Musubi - 9/10. Amazing flavors. Rice was great. Tongue was crazy tender. Cilantro sauce was harmonious. Seaweed could have been crispier.Silken Tofu - 7/10 Maine Uni was bitter and the miso was a bit overpowering. However, the tofu itself was sublime, along with the equally fantastic slightly slaty ikura.Monkfish Liver Torchon - 4/10 Passion Fruit overpowers the creamy liver.  Yet if you like desserts before your entree, you may enjoy this a lot.  The King bread was excellent.Big-Eye Tuna Poke - 7/10 The tuna itself was a bit bland, but the accompaniments were just right.  Though quite good, it is not of the quality of poke I had in Hawaii.Hawaiian Hearts of Palm - 5/10 Served in slices, but I prefer my hearts of palm whole in order to taste the tenderness when I bite into the center. Sauce was great, need more.Kalua Pig Croquettes - 9/10 Awesome!  You can really taste the tender and flavorful shredded pork among the creamy potato, nestled inside a crispy shell.Sea Urchin Tagliatelle 1/10 Honestly, I hate to rate anything (especially w/ uni) this low, but I had to on this dish.  Simply put, way too much parmesan.Pineapple Braised Pork Belly - 9/10 Holy crap! Talk about fork tender and absolutely yummy. Well, this is it. Not 10/10 because their wasn't much pineapple flavor.Garlic Shrimp Over Rice - 8/10 One of my favorite things in Hawaii to eat.  This super garlicky version is just as good as some of the best I had on the islands.Mentaiko Spaghetti - 8/10 First word to describe this pasta is smoky.  Spaghetti was a bit past al dente but still pretty good. The butterfish was yummy.Grilled Pineapple Brûlée - 10/10 Only problem with this dessert was that we all wanted more.  Sweet and salty.  Perfect.Adzuki Bean & Coconut Tapioca - 6/10 Great concept where the orange ice cream was just slight misplaced imo. I would have preferred a flavor with less zest.Crispy Mochi Waffle - 5/10 Sounds so cool, but lacked execution.  The mochi waffle was not crispy enough, though the whipped peanut butter was delicious.The decor was quite modern and the service was very good.  My glass was always full with water and our server had a smile every time he walked by.  There are still other interesting items on the menu I would like to try.  With a lack of good Hawaiian cuisine in NYC, I will be returning.",4,0,0,Gordon Y.,"Rego Park, NY",562,237,1376

There were definitely some dishes which could have been done better. The hearts of palm salad was topped with blood oranges which clashed noticeably with the pecorino romano. The spam agnolotti, which I, as a spam lover, was excited for, ended up being rather bland, aside from the very generous amount of black truffles shaved on top of them.

4.0,2/24/2016,"I don't know anything about Hawaiian food. Other than the pizza, which doesn't even hail from the aloha state, Hawaiian cuisine isn't particularly pervasive in these parts. Attracted by several months of buzz, I finally made my way here! It's definitely an upscale take on the cuisine but I'll take any iteration I can.The sleek and minimalist decor along with the dim lighting and small-but-not-too-small space lends itself well to intimate gatherings of the romantic or platonic nature. Here with my boo, we were seated immediately thanks to reservations, and by the looks of it, I'd recommend making them.The menu quickly illustrated Hawaiian cuisine's interesting fusion of Polynesian and other various Asian cooking. For appetizers, we ordered the Silken Tofu and very popular Big-eye Tuna Poke. The tofu was topped with salmon roe, uni, and something sweet I couldn't identify. While I enjoyed the combined silky texture of everything and small bursts of flavor from the roe, the dish was a little too light on flavor. The tuna poke, on the other hand, was not. Slightly spicy, citrusy, and probably some other flavors I can't recall, the tuna mixed with seaweed and pickled jalapeños was so good. I loved how large the chunks of tuna were rather than being delicate slices too.For my main, I went with the mentaiko spaghetti with smoked butterfish. At first, I was worried it wasn't going to be enough food but the creamy fish roe sauce that coated the spaghetti did the trick. The entire dish was deliciously smoky and the heaping pile of aonori added a nice, if subtle, contrast to everything else. (Writing this while hungry was a bad idea.) My boyfriend ordered the pineapple glazed pork belly and the bite I had was really good. It was perfectly cooked and sweet without being too sweet. He loved it.

Despite what other reviewers say, nothing was too salty or too acidic. Every flavor felt deliberate. No one should be surprised that the Poke was phenomenal. I shouldn't have arrived hungry. Even by Manhattan standards, it just was just too much money for too little food. The term ""prix fixe"" is used quite liberally as there is a $12 supplement for a tiny NY strip steak. If you want to ride the Poke wave, there are much cheaper options elsewhere. I don't see any other reason to go. The ambiance was nice enough, the service was good, and the bathroom was great, but at least in my eyes, that's not reason enough to drop close to $100 and leave with an empty stomach.",2,2,1,Eamon A.,"New York, NY",198,57,54
4.0,2/1/2016,"This place is good, and relatively unique.  I came here to celebrate with my fiance our anniversary, and it happened to be Restaurant Week.  The RW week menu here, is a good deal, where they actually showcase good dishes.  We were seated promptly, even though late for an 8pm ressie on a Sunday. Surprisingly, even as we were leaving the restaurant was pretty full. It also looks small but wraps around in the back so you can seat larger groups (it smelled weird back there, though). 3.75 stars, just rounding up because I think they are new.Anyway.  Here's what we had- He had the big eye tuna poke - great portion, fantastic taste  (fatty, crunchy, spicy) and we loved the seaweed salad- I had the silken tofu - Please note. Do NOT get this unless you really, really like roe, fish paste, uni... It was overall too fishy for me and didn't have enough tofu in it.  It made the dish really salty. Portions were good, for the most part.  We had for dinner;-He, the pork belly. Honestly, this sounded really delish and is a signature dish.  Soft, caramelized pork belly (yummy!) with mustard greens and pineapple. Yum. -I, the bluefish spaghetti.  Honestly, I love the lemon flavor but felt it was overall a wee bit... salty. And I am a salt freak.  And the fish didn't add much flavor. I would have loved a bit of spice...For dessert (arguably the best part)-He the sundae, with salty graham cracker (yummmy!), coconut ice cream, nuts, marshmallow flush (it seemed like). This was a delicious dessert, hands down.-I, the burnt orange ice cream with tapioca, red bean, dried fruit.  Definitely a winner but still has more experimental Asian funk I had a glass of crips Sav Blanc with my meal. They were great about water refill, and prompt with service.  I would recommend - especially if you're not familiar with Hawaiian but overall love Asian/Chinese/Japanese flavors.   My particular RW could have been a little too experimental and I wish the food was a bit more refined. But portions are not bad and prices on a regular day seem great so can't complain.",4,2,3,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",878,1242,25
2.0,2/1/2016,"First, service is friendly and efficient but a restaurant is also about what comes out of the kitchen. This is where Noreetuh falls short, very very short. We had the tuna poke and Hawaiian hash with eggs and toast; both plates were unremarkable and overpriced. The tuna in the poke was average quality tuna - actually it was chewy. Doused in sesame oil, it lacked the umami flavor. The eggs and pork hash with overcooked sunny side up eggs and butter less wonder bread toast was worse than second rated diner food.

The restaurant itself looks brand spanking new, everything was shiny and clean. Well-spaced dark wood tables, candles, and neutral walls. We sat towards the front of the restaurant next to the bar (which at the time of dining only had two stools there). We each took advantage of the three course prix fixe ($38) to try what Noreetuh had to offer.I started with the pork croquettes. Croquettes were good, fried well, starch-y but not anything too wildly different from what you would be able to get at a Japanese market. SO got the tuna poke which was really tasty! Would recommend that to start.For mains, I had a bass with asparagus; the SO the mentaiko spaghetti. The bass was crispy, executed well. The accompanying asparagus tasted vinegar-soy, not bad. The mentaiko spaghettie - was distinctly japanese with flakes of smoked butterfish mixed in.The desserts: haupia sundae, and azuki bean and tapioca float. the SO and I swapped as the haupia sundae tasted like a sundae and I really enjoyed the coconut ice cream graham cracker taste together. The azuki bean and tapioca float tasted like a toned down halo halo which is a good thing, cause halo halo is crazy. Even then the sweetness level on both desserts were excessive. Just overly sweet so much so that the nuances of the flavors get lost.Overall, Noreetuh is a nice place to grab dinner.

The tofu was really soft. I personally wasn't a fan of it, but that's because there was too much going on for me. I'm glad I tried it though. Entree - Mentaiko spaghetti ($22) This was simply amazing. There was so much flavor in the spaghetti. I've never had pasta like this before. The waiter said it was the most popular dish, so I had to try it. The pasta had smoked butterfish pieces in it topped with crunchy..seaweed, and .. just wow. I would go back to the restaurant just to get this again. I was honestly so sad to have to share this dish with my friend. I wanted it all to myself!!!Dessert - Bruleed pineapple ($10)I'm not going to lie..I thought this was going to be a pineapple-flavored creme brulee LOL. So, I was very surprised to see that it was just a pineapple. Nonetheless, it was still very yummy. They toast the top of the pineapple, so you're eating chilled and toasted pieces at the same time. The pineapple pieces are lightly salted as well. That was a nice touch. I will definitely try putting salt on my pineapple in the future, although I'm not so sure if that's all it takes.The total bill came out to about $50 for 2 people. Not tooooooooo shabby.

4.0,12/9/2015,"Liked it! From the moment I walked in, to the moment I walked out, it was a great experience. The staff are all friendly, laid back and very hospitable. FoodOrdered a bit too much for 2, but let's be honest.. no such thing as too much food. 1. monkfish liver torchon: ON POINT. Favorite of the night. do not miss this. this is a very ""rich"" dish. i recommend tasting the monkfish first without anything to truly appreciate the ensemble. once you did that, mash everything together and eat it with the bread they give you. Something I noticed though was that this dish can get ""old"" quick. They gave us 5 slices of amazingly soft bread but I think 4 would've been sufficient along with slightly smaller portions. By the 5th slice it got a little overwhelming. Besides that, excellent dish. 2. big-eye tuna po-ke: As P. Wells noted, it's not pronounced poke but po-ke, like okay. Not trying to be a snob but at least know what you're ordering. I didn't know what to expect but another winner. Big chunks of tuna with nutty flavors all around. 3. octopus poke: this, comparison to the tuna was ok. don't get both po-kes.4. silken tofu: slightly disappointed. all things uni are okay with me and while the tofu itself was great, for some reason the flavors didn't all come together. 5. mentaiko spaghetti: excellent. unfortunately we were too full to finish it but nonetheless the smoked butterfish was on point. Wine pairing: excellent. I'm no wine expert but each wine paired well with the dishes we got. I guess that's the point but the manager/super-tall friendly asian male host was very informative of why he chose x,y and z wine. Service: excellent all around.

4.0,11/6/2015,"I'm currently relatively unschooled in Hawaiian cuisine, but not for long, as I'm planning on visiting the Big Island and Oahu in late Jan/early Feb. Our visit to Noreetuh turned out to be some very pleasant trip research.Even for a newbie like me, it's pretty easy to tell that the chefs here create sophisticated takes on traditional Hawaiian cuisine, with attention paid to both interesting/unique flavor profiles and the aesthetic. The restaurant features two different rooms, each with a different look but both with a modern, classy vibe. The place was relatively empty when we arrived around 7, and things started to pick up and get pretty noisy when we left at 8:30.I only had one item each off of the ""snacks"" and ""mains"" sections, and while I didn't leave hungry, I probably could've had a little more food. For the price, I thought the main dishes were a tad on the smaller side. But to be fair, I was realllly hungry when I arrived.I started with the tempura-flaked shishito peppers. I enjoyed these a lot, even though several times a particularly hot pepper left me panting and nearly incapacitated. Shishio peppers are not for the faint of tongue. Anyway, I liked that the tempura was in flake form and enhanced but didn't completely overwhelm the flavor of the pepper. My friend had the pork croquettes and the braised pork belly. I thought the croquettes were great, but didn't love the pineapple sauce on the pork belly.Since I'm trying to get into the Hawaii mood and islanders' love for spam is a well-known trope, I decided to try the spam agnolotti (burgundy truffles, celery, parmigiano-reggiano cream). There were a lot of distinct flavors in this dish, but I thought they blended together well. It was tangy, earthy, meaty and cheesy-creamy all at once. The truffles were sliced very thinly on top and provided the light, earthy flavor (don't expect that familiar intense truffle-y taste from a burgundy truffle). The tanginess came from something at bottom of the dish, although I'm not quite sure what (artichokes?). The spam, which was minced, was more understated than I thought.Since our trip isn't for another few months, I would definitely consider coming back soon and maybe trying some wine pairings this time.Overall, I thought Noreetuh was a 3.5-star experience and I'd give it that if I could.",3,0,0,Laura O.,"Manhattan, NY",341,548,34

Self described as korean, hawaiian, japanese fusion, but Vicky described as having the flavors that I am familiar with but not quite executing it well enough to warrant it good fusion food. With these kinds of flavors, I prefer to just have them the good old fashioned korean, or hawaiian, or japanese way.For example - the Crispy Mochi Waffles, Whipped Peanut Butter, Alaea Salt. This was basically the chinese street style rice noodles adapted to a dessert. However, the mochi waffles did not have a good consistency, it was way too chewy. The whipped peanut butter was way too sweet, and although they tried to balance it out with some of that Alaea salt, it just didn't work. I would rather have my ""dai pai dong"" chinese rice noodles any day over this.So I felt this way about many of the dishes on the menu.I think the only thing I liked here were the Kalua Pork Croquettes, which were exactly how croquettes should be - perfectly fried, soft, with a delicious meat filling. Did it have a distinctive korean fusion flavor? No. Was it a good croquette? Yes.I guess what I'm trying to say is that the thought behind the dishes was amazing. I read the menu thinking my socks would be blown off. But, in reality the execution just wasn't there. The flavors didn't work together as a fusion dish as they do prepared in their original way.

It was definitely a great starter and I highly recommend it and I have to go back to try the other starters for sure.For the main dish, we ordered the venison for two. It takes 45 minutes to cook but well worth the wait.  The server will come out with the venison to show you that it's under the process and when it comes out, it's separated for two. 2 pieces each person served with my favorite, heirloom tomatoes. Each bite was mesmerizing. The service was very very on point. Everyone was polite and friendly. We weren't drinking so we didn't really need to be checked up as often but everyone was nice. The manager was very catering and he made sure everything was smooth. I heard they have a pretty awesome brunch menu so will definitely be back to check that out.The prices are very fair and so are the portions.

One friend doesn't eat pork; both were turned off by beef tongue.We walked in on Friday around 7pm without a reservation. Despite it being August, another restaurant was packed solid by 6:30pm. In the East Village. They only sat the 3 of us when the party was full but after we were seated there was a guy that was seated at the table next to us. His dining companion didn't arrive for a while.- I had the beef tongue musubi on my own. I liked it. Nice play on spam musubi. There were nuts? that added to the texture.- Mushroom tempura w/ aioli - excellent- Fried shishito peppers - ok.- Taro chips with truffle - good. Get it.- Octopus poke - I liked it. My friends said it was fishy.- Tuna poke - Fine too but I liked the octopus more.- Garlic shrimp - Hmm... this should've been better. Not garlicky enough. Pineapple wasn't ripe and sweet enough. Nowhere near the North shore shrimp trucks.- Mentaiko pasta. One friend liked it. My taste buds felt muddled - it wasn't that good to me. **Edit - I had it again and stand by my decision**- Mochi waffle dessert with peanut butter and honey. The waffle wasn't good on its own. And the peanut butter didn't make it much better. - Chocolate haupia sundae was ok. I would've liked it more with less graham cracker.Service was excellent. I'm not itching to return any time soon but will definitely do some research before the next visit and bring someone people who are more adventurous. I totally wanted to try the spam agnolotti.

That didn't matter--the service was as attentive and sincere as if we were high priority. Treated from beginning to end. We ordered taro chips with truffle, but we got the crispy mushrooms gratis. I think he knew we were eyeing them. We were a bit predictable with the tuna poke, but we also got the steak tartare, which was phenomenal (that's coming from me, when that's really my bf's favorite dish). Pork belly usually makes me want to pass out, but this one was melt in your mouth, perfect balance with greens and a starch. It was delicious and decadent without being excessive. We paired that with the summer vegetable pasta, which was light and perfect, and took home as leftovers and are eating right now. It's still good.The most admirable feat was the server making our bottle of wine last the whole meal without ever feeling like we were low or moving too quickly. Excellent pacing.We finished with the brûlée'ed pineapple, which was an on-point, simple, sweet ending. And a dessert wine, served by one of the founders / owners, who was extremely personable and open.Couldn't recommend it more. A great break from the typical NYC fare.

3.0,8/14/2015,"I was grateful to be able to try out Noreetuh given all the hype it has received since its inception. It is a very ""trendy"" restaurant, with no signs on the exterior. It was very crowded on a Thursday night. The food was presented artfully and the ingredients were top-notch, but the taste was not super inspiring. I ordered the taro chips because of other positive Yelp reviews. I was not impressed. The flavor and crunch were nice but they were definitely not worth $11, more like $5. The miso mushroom starter was a standout. The flavors were very evident and it was the perfect size for a starter. My entree, the chow noodles, was the only option I had since I'm a vegetarian. I wasn't impressed with it either. There were tons of vegetables in it but they all had the same texture as the noodles. The spiciness was perfect and not overpowering (this is coming from a white girl who cannot handle spicy!) I would have liked to see more options for vegetarians on the menu. What was really incredible was the bread pudding with pineapple ice cream. It was one of the better restaurant desserts I've ever had. Definitely order it if you like bread pudding!            Honestly, I'm not sure if I would come back here. It is definitely better suited for meat eaters as there are many options. The vegetarian entree option is kind of weak. I was excited for a dish with a Hawaiian flair (granted, I've never been to Hawaii so I'm not sure exactly what that would entail) but the noodle dish seemed more pan-Asian and not really distinctively Hawaiian (again, I have no authority on this subject but this is what I'm going to presume). It's a pretty pricy place. I understand that the chefs are derived from Per Se but looking at this restaurant holistically, I think the prices are unjustified.",1,0,0,Laura G.,"New York, NY",174,191,32

5.0,8/6/2015,"When one thinks of ""Hawaiian food"" the unfortunate associations are to tikis, platters of food fried to unrecognizable oblivion, and tacky sugary drinks with umbrellas.  If that's your desire, Noreetuh is not for you.  Noreetuh is New American with heavy Hawaiian and Pacific Rim influences.  Take for example a standard Hawaiian appetizer, poke (pronounced like the ""pokey"" of ""hokey pokey""), which is sashimi grade fish that is akin to tuna tartare and not ceviche, the latter which has citrus juice in it.One does not have to be Hawaiian to appreciate the gracious and attentive service of Noreetuh.  Certainly being from Hawaii helps one recognize the local influences of Spam that is sneaked into the torteloni and the Kings Bakery Hawaiian sweet bread made into a pudding.  But one just has to be a good eater to appreciate the flavors of truffle dusted taro chips and the mentaiko spaghetti.  It's been weeks since I dined there and I still can't get the flavors of the mentaiko spaghetti out of my mind, briny, creamy, salty, all at once. Check them out.  You'll be glad you did even though there' nary a tiki or torch in sight.",0,0,0,A L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,0
5.0,8/2/2015,"A lot of previous reviewers have taken note of Noreetuh's Per Se pedigree. We thought the three co-owners' training was abundantly clear in the service (warm, professional, detail-oriented) and the food (inventive, beautiful, and above all, delicious). We ordered quite a few snacks and starters, two main courses, and dessert to share: - seaweed chips (salty, sweet and completely addictive for those of us who enjoy seaweed to begin with, but made no converts of the dining companions who didn't already eat seaweed) - corned beef tongue musubi (great combination of flavors, beautifully cured corned beef, one of our favorites) - silken tofu with uni, shiitake, shiso (reminded me of a summery chawanmushi, delicious and beautiful to look at) - soft-shell crab with tomato salad, pipikaula, calamansi mayonnaise (juicy, fat, crab with a truly standout tomato salad; those tomatoes were sweet as candy) - grass-fed beef tartare with smoked egg yolk, daikon, wonton chips (the smoked egg yolk was the best thing I've eaten in months, maybe all year, and it elevated an already fantastic beef tartare to something ethereal, as good as anything you'd have at Per Se) - big-eye tuna poke with macadamia nuts, pickled jalapeño, seaweed (perfectly balanced in terms of flavor, textures; one of my favorites on the menu) - monkfish liver torchon with pear, cilantro, passionfruit, hawaiian roll (another Per Se worthy dish whose unbelievable richness and presentation strongly recalled foie gras; do NOT miss this dish if you enjoy or have ever enjoyed a liver preparation)- mochi-crusted halibut with pole beans, chinese bacon, fermented black bean (very fresh fish, crispy crust, kick ass pole beans that were perfectly sweet and salty and umami rich from the hint of black bean sauce) - duck breast with apricot kernels, purslane, li hing mui (I was too full to try this dish, but my dining companions enjoyed it) - crispy mochi waffles with whipped peanut butter, honey (waffles had a really interesting, light, crispy texture; whipped peanut butter tasted like a well-made mousse) This was stellar food and stellar service -- and an unusually good value. We were so impressed with our meal that we wouldn't be surprised if Noreetuh were a NYC institution ten, twenty or thirty years down the line. It's better than most of the Momofukus (and probably tied with Ko). It is better than most one-starred Michelin restaurants in this city.

4.0,7/23/2015,"I'd read about Noreetuh in the same article that I'd heard about Oiji (just across the street), so I was eager to visit once I'd had dinner at Oiji not so long ago. This past weekend, we made the trek over to 1st Avenue for a relatively early dinner seating (6:15 PM); by the time we walked out closer to 8, the restaurant itself was filled up...so come early, or make a reservation! The restaurant is deceptively small when you enter; there is an entire dining area to the right behind the bar that is basically the same size as the space you see when you come in. The decor is intimate but austere - some mirrors line the walls but little else. I am disappointed to say that unlike Pete Wells, I didn't have the privilege (or lack thereof) of hearing any Taylor Swift songs playing in the background...that said, most of the music was contemporary pop (but not super-recognizable). The service was quick as well, with food and drinks being brought promptly, with our water glasses always filled. There are no cocktails, which was a bit saddening, and the beer selection is a little on the tight side - although I did appreciate having a Belgian-brewed Belgian IPA on tap.We ended up sharing all the dishes and doing a couple bites from the 'snacks' and the appetizer section each (what is the difference? Mainly size, but I think by any sensible definition, they are all appetizers) and splitting one entree. I'm glad the waitress was straight with us and said that was plenty - we wanted to add another appetizer, but that would have been pushing our luck. We started out with the musubi and the silken tofu for our small bites. I enjoyed the musubi a bunch; while it may not be as debasingly delicious as it would be with Spam, the beef tongue had great firm texture, and the curing of the beef gave it a nicely light acidic touch without being overbearing and taking away from the flavor of the meat. As for the tofu - I really enjoyed it, although I think the sauce was a bit much, and the mushrooms included were verifiably oversalted. It was one of those dishes where a bite or two was great, but polishing off half of it had me sipping aggressively on the water afterwards. For the 'starters', we did the tuna poke and the pork croquettes. Poke is as Hawaiian a dish as it gets, and they did a great job with it here. The tuna was pretty fresh, and I really enjoyed the crunchiness of the macadamia nuts and particularly the subtle heat from the marinated slices of jalapeno. I enjoy my poke with some flavors in it (my thought being - if I really want top-notch raw tuna, I'll go to a sushi joint), and this definitely had it in spades. I was more disappointed in the croquettes; while the Kalua pork was definitely juicy, it lacked much flavor on its own. The katsu sauce added a BBQ-style flavor that helped out, but I've made more flavorful Kalua pork in my slower cooker at home - so this was a bit of a strike against a spot influenced by Hawaiian cuisine. For our sole main dish, we did the mochi-crusted halibut. I liked the swath of squash puree that had a bright flavor, and the fish was cooked perfectly - very juicy flakes, and the mochi crust gave it a nice texture without interfering with the natural flavoring of the fish at all. To top the meal off, we went with the macadamia nut brownie with coconut ice cream. It's a tropical twist on a classic American dessert, and it worked out really well. The brownie was good (a tad on the dry side), but the coconut ice cream gave it a very refreshing feel without having a coconut flavor that was too overbearing. It wasn't overly heavy, either, making it a perfect way to finish off a (slightly) large meal.Although I think Noreetuh didn't quite measure up to its similarly new Asia/Pacific-inspired companion across the street, it was still a delicious meal that had a casual feel to it but with above-quality ingredients and preparation. There are plenty of other items on the menu I'd be interested in trying, and given how laid-back it is (and reasonably-priced, at least for NYC), I'd recommend to give it a shot. You won't feel like you're back in the Islands, but it will make you forget that you're in the hustle and bustle of East Village for a little bit.",3,1,1,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169
5.0,7/23/2015,"I loved my experience at Noreetuh. Dined on a Wednesday around 8:30 PM with a friend. We ordered the Tuna Poke and Softshell Crab starters, both were delicious! The soft shell crab was lightly battered and came with some light aioli and vegetables which balanced the fried part nicely. The poke was tasty as well!For entrees, we shared the Mentaiko pasta and the Pineapple Pork Belly. Again, really happy with both of these. Very rich dishes, but we shared them and loved both. The pasta was in an oil based sauce and had some fish roe mixed in, I believe. The pork belly was well cooked and flavorful. Finally, for dessert, we shared the mochi waffles and the bread pudding. I would recommend the bread pudding over the waffles, though they were unique. I preferred the ice cream/bread pudding combo. The wine list was impressive though we did not drink with dinner.

We also got the maintako spaghetti and braised pork belly which was good too.The food was all delicious but it wasn't as complex or creative as I would have expected. I wasn't wowed.We got for dessert the mochi waffles and the bread pudding. I loved the mochi waffles because I love mochi. The whipped sweetened peanut butter and honey was amazing. My boyfriend really liked the pineapple ice cream with his dessert but the raisins on top of the bread pudding were liked taking a shot of rum.

I think they are good but not great. Even then, the portions are good (not large) and best for sharing between 2-3 people. The best part is the entree. I had the Garlic shrimp on rice and it comes with pineapples. It brought me back to the shrimp truck experience in Hawaii...seriously!! My husband had the pork belly and it was definitely slow cooked for a good long while, everything was tender and juicy. I had Mochi waffle for dessert and that was a good way to end the meal.

Definitely feeling underwhelmed by our meal... Seems to be a collection of well executed dishes, but very little unique flavoring that differentiates it as Hawaiian fare. Appetizer:Corned Beef tongue mitsubi - a little too salty since the tongue is to replace spam. But enjoyed the peanuts and cilantro sauce to pair. Tuna poke - definitely recommend, pickled jalapeño adds a nice twist with some heat. Good starter to your meal. Entree:Chow noodles - great texture on the chewy noodles, morels absorbed butter exquisitely. Every bite with morels delivered super umami deliciousness.Garlic shrimp - while shrimp was done well, the dish overall fell flat with little creativity. If you're itching for a new place to try out in the area, definitely stop by. But if you're looking for a great Hawaiian meal, this may not be it.",1,1,1,Jane C.,"New York, NY",55,22,3
3.0,7/17/2015,"I really wanted to like this place more, but it just didn't do it for me. The biggest turn-off was the prices. While not terribly expensive, the portions were quite small for the price.Kombu Chips: Bleh. I think that maybe I just don't like kombu. The seasoning was nice but these left my whole party of 7 with a terrible aftertaste in our mouths.Beef Tartare: Great! I prefer my tartare lightly dressed which this was, so I really appreciated that. This is something that I felt like I could get anywhere, though.Monkfish Liver Torchon: This was definitely our favorite appetizer of the night. It was incredibly unique, and the pairing of the passion fruit with the monkfish liver was perfect. If I ever came back here, it would be for this dish.Tuna Poke: Tuna was fresh but it tasted overwhelmingly of sesame. The flavors needed to be more balanced.Mentaiko Spaghetti: Okay, this dish was super weird. The butterfish was a nice touch and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, but I can't help but wonder who decided that mentaiko should be turned into a sauce and put over pasta. The flavors were nice though, and the aonori added a lot here.Mochi-Crusted Halibut: I was really disappointed. The crust was yummy but the fish was slightly overcooked and a little on the dry side. The sauces were alright but I felt like I didn't need squash puree and black bean-pine nut puree on the same plate. Also, it only came with 3 tiny pieces of bok choy. If we hadn't ordered appetizers we definitely still would have been hungry after this entree.Spam Agnolotti: THIS. This dish was absolutely incredible. The texture of the spam filling inside the pasta was so interesting, and the pasta was thin and flavorful. These were perfectly cooked and the sauce complimented them perfectly. Again, portion was smaller than it should have been.Honestly, skip dessert. The pineapple brûlée was super average, and for the $8 we all definitely could have gone without the quarter of a cold pineapple with browned sugar on top.The waitress was very friendly and the ambience was nice.

3.0,7/17/2015,"Noreetuh was a good meal for a very reasonable NYC price. I went with my girlfriend and we split a bottle of Piuze, Terroir de Chichee ($53). The wine was delicious, smooth, and fruity. To start we split the Big-eye tuna poke and the hearts of palm salad. Both were intriguing dishes with Hawaiian taste and beautiful plating. The hearts of palm salad consisted of cleanly cut beets and hearts of palm served over a smoked tofu puree with crispy shallots sprinkled atop. It was one of the better dishes of the night. The Big-Eye tuna poke was good, but nothing over the top original. The tuna wasn't cut very cleanly and made for some strange bites, but the flavor was good. For dinner I ordered the Garlic Shrimp over Rice. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, as was the rice, and tasted exactly as the menu described. However, the presence of the dish was butchered by a side salad of undressed romaine lettuce. My girlfriend was nice enough to let me taste her dish, the Mentaiko Spaghetti, and I was glad that I did. It was superb. The flavors of the fish absorbed into the pasta and created a dish that felt true to the Hawaiian title. For dessert we split the Bread Pudding. Not too mushy but not too decadent. It almost tasted like French toast with a side of pineapple ice cream, which doesn't taste bad, but I expected a little more flare from ex-Per Se chef Chung Chow. Overall, the food was good, and again the prices were reasonable. The restaurant was small but comfortable (one room is clearly more enjoyable than the other). The food was good but needs to be tightened up.

5.0,7/4/2015,"The food is very good and very interesting!  The place was packed so we sat at the bar. We had the pork croquettes which were crispy and not greasy.  I loved the beef tongue musubi, but my husband just liked it.  We both loved the heart of Palm and beet salad.  The salad was clean and refreshing.  The halibut had mochi crust which made it very crispy and good! We had every dessert on the menu. Our favorite was the pineapple and the brownie.  Just as awesome as the food was the wine list.  A good portion of the list is well priced and interesting.   Unfortunately, I am not a wine connoisseur so I don't remember the champagne and white wine we had, but the white wine was a burgundy and priced at $60 (we were splurging a little celebrating first time out after baby) I think and was great!  We recommend making a reservation because we were lucky to get 2 of the last 4 bar seats available.",0,0,0,Dorothea L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,38,5
4.0,7/4/2015,"I had wanted to check this place out because I was interested in the idea of taking a cuisine that is typically very hearty and comfort food-y and making it upscale. It's a small space, but the decor is modern and simple with zero kitsch or gimmicks. There was an impressive beer and wine menu, but I'll admit I was slightly disappointed that there no fun Hawaiian-themed cocktail list. Everything on the menu looked appealing, so to help us decide the waitress gave us her recommendations:-Tongue Musubi: Loved this- the tongue was very tender and it was well complimented by the crunchy sweetness of the crushed peanuts-Silk tofu with Uni and Ikura: actually wasn't a huge fan of this dish and was probably the only miss of the meal. I love tofu, uni, and fish roe  separately, but together it came out to be too briny and mushy for my taste-Tuna poke: delicious and fresh, could've given a bit more tuna to veggie ratio, but great flavors-Mochi-crusted fluke: Light and flaky with good sauces that complimented it-Pineapple braised pork-belly- SO good, I'm a huge pork belly fan and this had the perfect melt-in-your-mouth fat to lean meat ratio. It was tender and juicy and came apart easily.-Bread pudding - Warm and soft bread pudding that contrasted well with creamy ice cream with small pineapple bits in it...great combinationHawaiian food itself is so diverse, and is a fusion cuisine in itself. The menu at Noreetuh takes a creative and modern reinvention of the cuisine, and is a reflection of the Per Se chefs that brought it together. The flavors and plating are sophisticated and well thought out. If you like unique and flavorful food, I'd definitely recommend coming here!",5,3,4,Christine L.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",166,38,44
4.0,7/2/2015,"Came here last night and had a wonderful time. Service: 5 starsFood: 3.75Ambience/decor: 5 Our waitress Allia (?) was amazing, warm, professional and kind. We were reset promptly for every course, kindly guided through the menu, and had just the right amount of conversation with her. Everyone else, from the busboys to the host, was also great. (It also didn't hurt that I bartend at a Patina Group restaurant, and one of the chefs used to work for Lincoln Ristorante)The ideas behind the food were all really good, but not everything succeeded. Tuna Poke:By far the most delicious thing we had that night. Pretty fresh tuna, marinated in a vinegary liquid with all sorts of things, like seaweed, folded in. The dish was intricate, tangy, delicious, and kept us coming back until the last bite. Monkfish Liver Torchon:The overall dish, with the passion fruit compote and the soft King's Hawaiian bread was good but not great. Everything together was much too sweet, and the liver paté itself was just blah. Spam Agnolotti:My least favorite dish of the night. The taste of preserved lemon overwhelmed everything, and I didn't find the spam to be ""transformed"" as some yelpers suggested. Mentaiko Spaghetti:So so so so good. That smoked butterfish just works so well, and the buttery (but not creamy) sauce was beyond addictive. Bread pudding:Yummm. Sweet and warm bread pudding balanced out with rum raisin and tart pineapple ice cream. Drinks:His gruner was wonderful. My rosé was just ok. Overall a very cool and fun dining experience; a restaurant that makes you feel welcome with both its warm service and chic but cozy ambience.",4,1,1,Amanda I.,"Manhattan, NY",723,129,72
4.0,6/30/2015,"This was my second favorite spot that I went to during my NYC trip. Though I am not sure how much I paid because my team paid for it, I enjoyed many of the dishes. We had everything on our preset menu. They were also very accommodating and offered many variety for vegetarians because my co-worker left full and satisfied.Snacks-- Truffle taro chips: one of my favorite dishes because I killed it quick lol. The taro chips were thin, so they didn't fill me up before the main courses, and the truffle complemented the chips very well.- Crispy mushrooms with sweet miso sauce: usually not a fan of mushrooms, but this one tasted delicious all crispy with the sauce - definitely recommend to order if you're a mushroom fan.- Spicy gobo: Not a fan of mushrooms so this dish was ok to me. Everyone around me loved it because it wasn't heavy, and the crispiness and sauce paired with the mushroom as the salad was a bit hit for my table.- Kombu chips: This was probably my least favorite snack that we got. It is seaweed that's made into chips with a spicy flavoring - it had an odd taste to it, which I was not digging. Starters-- Hearts of palm, beets, crispy shallots, cilantro, and smoked tofu: also wasn't a fan of the smoked tofu. It had a very familiar taste, but I'm usually not into anything into this dish so I tried it and passed on it.- Big-eye tuna poke: This was my favorite of the starters. It was very tasty and flavored well. The tuna melted in my mouth, yum!- Kalua pork croquettes: Nothing really special about this but that it is like pork dipped in katsu sauce. Mains-- Chow noodles: Probably my favorite dish of the mains - noodles were soft and the veggies were good.- Halibut: soft and tasty fish with good flavoring, but it wasn't something that stood out to me or special.- Pineapple braised pork belly: tasted good but it was very fatty, which I am not usually a fan of, but it was rich in flavor.Desserts-- Macadamia nut brownie with coconut ice cream: the brownie was a bit hard, but I really liked the coconut ice cream.- Bruleed Pineapple: I liked this one best out of both desserts because it was different. It had a sugar glaze on top of half a pineapple, like the sugary layer on top of creme bruelee! Though it was just pineapple underneath it, it was different and delicious.Definitely recommend :) The pinot noir was also good there because it didn't have a strong aftertaste!",5,1,2,Amanda C.,"San Francisco, CA",1320,1342,5756
4.0,6/28/2015,"Appetizers we ordered included the spicy gobo, silken tofu with uni, monkfish liver torchon, and tuna poke. The monkfish liver was surprisingly the group's favorite. It's very similar to pate and was delicious. The tuna poke and tofu with uni were also great.Of the entrees, my favorite was the mochi-crusted halibut which was cooked just right. Others preferred the pineapple braised pork belly. The most disappointing was the spam agnolotti, which didn't taste like much of anything.For dessert, we shared the bruleed pineapple and the crispy mochi waffles, which were both so tasty and fun to eat. I'd also recommend checking out their Rieslings, as we shared one that was fantastic.",1,0,1,Melissa C.,"Seattle, WA",110,622,331
4.0,6/28/2015,"The food was very good, a tad bit sweet on almost everything though.  I suppose the touch of sweetness in everything is expected given the cuisine.  My favorite was the monkfish liver - it had a passionfruit purée under it and was served with toasted Hawaiian rolls.  It was rich with a little tang.  My least favorite was the chow noodles - just tasted like soy sauce stir fried noodles with a mix of greens - I think it could be improved with some ginger for a punch.  The two other dishes fell somewhere in the middle - silken tofu with sea urchin and mushrooms, and the tuna poke.  I liked them both very much.  I had the Mochi waffles with peanut butter and honey for dessert - it was delicious, it a bit too sweet.  The Mochi waffle was very light and crunchy - really had no taste other than the peanut butter and honey on top.  The waffle almost looks plastic because it's so white, but it was a surprisingly good combination.  I'd love to see them add Hawaiian shaved ice with red bean, lychee, condensed milk - the whole shebang of toppings mmmmm :9...Overall, it was a very good experience - food was great, service was attentive, and my only complaint was the noise level.  They could use some type of decor to absorb some sound, had to shout to my dinner companion to be heard.  I'd go back for the monkfish liver and I still think about those waffles.",0,0,0,lex i.,"New York, NY",3,42,170
4.0,6/26/2015,"Given the sheer amount of coverage that Noreetuh's gotten over the past few weeks, there are very few people who haven't heard of the cozy East Village restaurant. Started by two Per Se vets (manager Jin Ahn, executive chef Chung Chow), the restaurant takes a modern, playful spin on Hawaiian cuisine, best evidenced in the fact that ""Noreetuh"" translates into ""Playground"" in Korean.The space isn't the most ideal, though. The dining room is split into two divided sections, and tables are tightly packed with minimal walking space between them. The lengthiness and narrowness of such a layout also means that sunlight is a very precious commodity, and darkness settles faster than at most venues (which may be a benefit to some diners). My group of three were seated in the second room, and our server was quick to fill our glasses with water and give a welcome overview of the menu. Noreetuh offers a variety of snacks, starters, and mains, making it an ideal place for shared plates; how else would you try the endless tempting options available?We started first with the Silken Tofu, one of the more visually arresting dishes. Served in a small bowl, the delicate tofu is topped with a few servings of uni (sea urchin), ikura (salmon roe), and a shiitake mushroom duxelle. A few sprigs of shiso finish off the presentation, and it's at once a simple, yet quietly complex dish; the pairing of such ingredients have been tried and true. We also opted for the Corned Beef Tongue Musubi, a take on traditional Hawaiian snack which is usually served with Spam. It was certainly tasty, a foolproof wrapping of sushi rice, cilantro, and crushed peanuts in a nori sheet, and the corned beef a welcome alternative in both taste and texture for the canned ""meat product"".Perhaps not worth an order are the Kalua Pork Croquettes, two piping hot, deep-fried croquettes served over cabbage with katsu sauce. While tasty, the preparation prevented us from noting any distinction of the kalua. Replace that instead with the much-loved Big-Eye Tuna Poke, a surprisingly traditional take on the popular Hawaiian dish. The tuna is delicious, the subtle flavor highlighted beautifully by the hint of sesame oil and tobanjan-hinted seaweed strands. Let's not forget the addition of the macademia nuts and pickled jalapeño slices, which add just the right amount of heat and acidity to each bite, without overpowering the main protein.For the daring, the Braised Honeycomb Tripe is a solid order. Korean dukbokki, or sticky rice cakes, are cooked with the braised tripe; a smart decision as it takes away the typically overpowering flavor in the offal. Add on a healthy amount of gochujang sauce, the sweet-spicy Korean red pepper paste, and toss with bamboo shoots, onion, and chili, and you have a recipe for success. The bite of my friend's Spam Agnolotti was eye-opening as well, as the pairing with ramps, honshimeji, green almond, and bonito brought out a completely different flavor profile than I had been expecting.I hesitate to call Noreetuh a ""fusion"" restaurant, as much of Hawaiian cuisine has its roots in Japanese food, and the interplay of Korean ingredients and flavors is smartly and subtly done. What the restaurant has succeeded in doing, however, is establishing an identity that is unique from any other restaurant in the city - which, coupled with well-conceived and executed dishes, makes for a value proposition you can't deny.",18,7,15,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827
4.0,6/26/2015,"I wanted to try Noreetuh when I saw my friend posted pictures of his meal on Facebook soon after it opened.  However, it is always fully booked on Opentable!  I recently checked again, and found a reservation available on 6/25, which coincidentally was the day after the NYT review came out about this place.  Overall impression: Noreeuth was definitely worth the wait!The dishes we tried, ranked from best to mediocre:Octopus poke - I had high expectations for the poke dishes as they were my favorite thing to eat when I was in Hawaii.  This dish was hand's down the best dish of the night.  The tobiko and kimchi provided great complementary textures for the octopus. Moreover, the flavor profile was just amazing, the sauce had the perfect hint of richness that balanced perfectly with the octopus and the spiciness from the kimchiBruleed Hawaiian pineapple - such a simple dish, but so unique and special at the same time.  The brulee crust was perfect and it made that crisp sound when you break into it, and the salt was unexpected, but worked well with the sweetness of the sugar crust and the pineapple.  If anything, I just wish the plate was bigger, for a $10 dish, they can give you half a small pineapple instead of quarter of one.Mochi-crusted halibut - I am normally not a huge fan of fish, but after reading all the reviews on this dish, we decided to give it a try. The mochi-crust was interesting, it does not really taste like mochi, but it provided a nice crunch to the texture.  Moreover, the sauce that accompanied the dish was very delicious, and the pine nuts also gave the dish more depth.Crispy mochi waffles - another dish that had great texture and unusual flavor combination.  I can't believe I never had a mochi waffle before, now I want all of my waffles to be made of mochi.  The combination of whipped peanut butter and honey was heavenly.Corned beef tongue musubi - I couldn't really tell it was beef tongue, I thought it was actually spam for a minute, as it is the traditional meat for a musubi.  The cilantro sauce with crushed peanuts was very tasty, as such, they could've put any meat in there.  Monkfish liver torchon - the toast made from Hawaiian roll elevated the dish, as did the fruit spread underneath the liver.  The monkfish liver was smooth and buttery.Silken tofu - unlike other dishes, I've seen this dish many times in Japanese restaurants, i.e. the combination of uni, ikura and tofu. It was good, but nothing to write home about.Big-eye tune poke - the less interesting of the two poke dishes, it was perfectly fine, but a bit of a let down after trying the octopus poke. It was a bit bland and nothing truly stood out in the dishGarlic shrimp over rice - similar to the tuna poke, this was a decent dish, the shrimp was cooked well, and the pineapple was a good touch. However, garlic shrimp is one of the most popular dishes in Hawaii, particularly among the food trucks in Oahu.  This dish could not hold up in comparison to the amazing ones that were served on the North Shore of Oahu.Service: I can't stop raving about the great service we received.  The waiter was informative, and attentive without being overbearing.  There were three of us, but the musubi dish only had two pieces per order.  He allowed us to order three pieces so that we can have one each.  It was a small gesture, but it made a huge difference.  Overall impression: it was a small restaurant, but they managed to not overcrowd the space with too many tables. I know the NYT review complained about the music, but I hardly noticed any music in the background, the noise level was on par with a small/packed restaurant.  Do note that they don't serve cocktails, only wine and beer.  I would highly recommend the place, and would love to come back to try the other dishes.",3,0,1,Kat J.,"Jersey City, NJ",137,196,1246
3.0,6/25/2015,"We got very excited about this place after the NYT and EaterNY gave it good reviews. Walked in on a Thursday night around 7 and there was a 2 hour wait for a party of 4. Fortunately, there was a last minute cancellation so we were seated after only a 10 minute wait. Service: attentive waiters, cute bartender and very pleasant hostess. Food: everything was just ""okay"" (1) silken tofu with uni starter was strange tasting. With the texture of silken tofu, I think they need to chill the dish to make it a lot colder. (2) beef tongue musubi - a little tasteless. Kind of like a bad version of stuffed onigiri. (3) kuala pork croquettes: texture was offputting. very crispy bread crumb coating, which was good -- but very mushy pork filling, which was just not appetizing. (4) tuna poke: delicious tasting, but then it's hard to mess up a tuna seafood salad...(5) monkfish liver: the liver was too ""processed"" - I was expecting cooked monkflish liver on top of some very interesting fruit puree - instead we got on big round peck of compressed puree monkfish liver that tasted part strawberry preserve part fish liver puree. not great. (6) mentaiko spaghetti: oversalted and strangely tasteless. you can barely detect the mentaiko. The dish needs a bit of heat to it too. cracked black pepper or a hint of red pepper would have made it better I think. (7) pineapple braised pork belly: decadent. The pork belly is praised to perfection. but maybe it's the asian in me - felt incomplete without a carb (i.e. rice) to soak up super flavorful and fatty pork belly. overall: great service, nice and clean restaurant. unfortunately, the food was just okay.",1,0,0,Thinh N.,"New York, NY",145,44,4
3.0,6/25/2015,"Excited to try this new Hawaiian-inspired food and see what it is all about. We even had someone who was a native Hawaiian to chime in with our group.For larger parties, you can make a reservation which was nice for the 7 of us. The wine list was pretty extensive and the waitstaff were good resources to ask about the wines. I ended up also getting a pear cider as they have 4 craft beers and a cider on draught as well.Service was very attentive with two individuals constantly cleaning off tables, giving us fresh plates, refilling our water, and pouring the bottles of wine.We ordered a bunch of dishes, all to share so that we could try everything.SNACKS:We started with the Truffled Taro Chips which was amazing and had so much truffle flavor on each chip.The Corned Beef Tongue Musubi came next and it was wrapped with some flavorless green cilantro sauce and whole peanuts. It was also difficult to keep the rice and peanuts from squishing out after every bite. I secretly wished it was SPAM I was biting into. At least season it... will ya?The Silken Tofu with Uni, Ikura, and Shitake puree was a winner. It was well composed, flavorful, and fresh tasting. STARTERS:The Grass-fed Beef Tartare was boring and bland. You had some small fried greasy wonton chips to put it on. There was this weird light yellow paste on the side that didn't taste like anything either. We did not finish this dish at all.The Octopus Poke was great! The textures were well balanced and the fingerling potatoes gave the dish some depth. The octopus was tender and saltiness of the tobiko brought out the flavors of the sea.The Kalua Pork Croquettes were a miss. It was these fried discs of indeterminate mushy filling inside. The cabbage underneath is just for decoration. The Katsu sauce to dip tasted very generic.The Big Eye Tuna Poke was middle of the road for us. Decently tossed with a variety of seaweed and fresh tasting with the nicely pickled jalapeno but still a bit bland again.The Monkfish Liver Torchon was delightful. It melted in your mouth and the composition of all the flavors worked really well together. It came with mini fluffy white toast.MAINS:The Mentaiko Spaghetti with the butterfish was a good transitional starchy dish that we were craving at this point. It was nicely cooked al dente with a very slight kick to brighten the senses.The Mochi-Crusted Halibut was flaky and nicely seared. I'm not sure where the mochi comes in. It just looked like seared fish with no crust. There was a nice creamy sauce on top with some bok choy on the bottom.The Duck Breast was a let down. We think it was prepared sous vide but was overdone. All the slices were cooked to grey medium well to well done, no pink at all. The apricot kernels that was scattered around didn't work with the dish and the hardness of it was a distractor. The Li Hing Mui is an orange plum that also felt like it was ""just there"" and didn't cohesively work with the dish.The Pineapple Braised Pork Belly was nice and tender. It was easy to break apart and we all had a taste. The size was very small though and I wouldn't consider it a main.DESSERT:The Bread Pudding was good with golden raisins and pineapple ice cream.The Brûléed Pineapple was a cold quarter chunk of pineapple with a brûléed sugar crust on top dusted with sea salt. Some liked it and half of us didn't. I didn't like how cold it was but the sea salt was a nice touch to bring out the sweetness of the pineapple.Overall, some good dishes while the misses are just because it was boring or wasn't well composed. I guess we had higher expectations going in but while it was generally good, it's nowhere near the top of my list for a place to return to anytime soon. Hopefully, they'll get to work out some of these kinks.",1,0,1,Denise W.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",110,182,1190

The crispy mushrooms were decent. The white asparagus was cooked perfectly, and the egg that came with it was really simple but really good. Definitely order the beef tartar - its good on its own but the smoked egg yolk that comes with it really makes the dish stand out.

5.0,6/20/2015,"This place is amazing !!! We ordered all of the entrees on the menu and three starters.Everything tastes delicious but here are the stand outs:,Pork belly: the pork belly was cooked to perfection with a lovely browning on the fat. I was nervous that it would taste fatty but it just melted in your mouth. The combination of yams and pine nuts in the dish also added a wonderful balance. Halibut: the black bean sauce and bok choy added a meatier taste to the halibut. Also it was cooked to be white and flaky and deliciously meaty. Mentaiko spaghetti: I don't really know how to explain this dish... It has a fishy undertone but looks like spaghetti. The butterfish is slightly smoked and this dish goes great with a rich red wine. This was my favorite dish.. Haha:) The three starters we had were the tuna poke (worth it and delicious) , pork croquette (tuna was better), and the heart of palms salad (the beats in this salad were so flavorful). Desserts: Mochi waffle, pineapple, brownie, and bread pudding. All of them were solid but I especially liked the bread pudding. I will admit that I am biased in general because I do love banana pudding. Overall though I feel like I ate a lot here but at the same time I don't feel completely disgusting.

4.0,6/17/2015,"KenScale: 8.0/10Noreetuh (meaning ""playground"" in Korean) is a new Hawaiian restaurant in East Village from chef Chung Chow, who was sous-chef at the venerable Per Se. You would expect a haute cuisine place from a chef of this pedigree, but what chef Chow is showcasing pays homage to his root from Hawaii, with a lot of Asian elements. I was overall pleased with the playful food offerings from the kitchen.Many of the dishes have inspirations and displays that are fun and employ diverse influences and elements. For snacks, the silken tofu that came with uni, ikura, shiitake and shiso writes Japanese all over its place and was quite pleasant. I was delighted with the way peanuts have been used in some dishes to further enhance the texture. For instances, peanuts worked well together inside the corned beef tongue musubi, as it did for pineapple braised pork belly that came with yams and mustard greens. The pork was cooked quite tender and worked nicely with the crunchy peanuts that, combined with sweet flavor, created a delicious dish. Big-eye tuna poke also came with macadamia nuts, pickled jalapeno and seaweed to create a refreshing starter. The only letdown was the spam agnolotti, which despite the promise of spam, didn't feel as put together as I had hoped. For dessert, bruleed Hawaiian pineapple didn't look like much but provided a refreshing finish to the meal with understated sweet crunch.Getting a reservation doesn't seem particularly difficult, although the restaurant was by no means empty in the course of my meal. I liked the modern, fun vibe of East Village at the dining area. There is no cocktail, but the restaurant has some pretty unique wine selections that are carefully selected by general manager Jin Ahn.

And I saw it online it waOrdered taro chips, silken tofu and musubi for the snacks and asparagus for starter pork belly and agnolotti for main. The staff is super friendly and nice. That's why I gave it 3 stars. Otherwise it only deserve 2. Like the taro chips. When I first saw it I was like look at this overpriced chips. But once I had it I just can't stop eating that! really good. The silken tofu with uni and ikura is the worst, I actually was pretty interested in this dish. They didn't clean the sea urchin properly, and still have that weird flavor, which should be rinsed off before they serve it. It just ruin the entire dish. Disgusting. How can you mess up with uni? The asparagus is underwhelming. They served it with chopped egg and Chinese sausage, don't like the green asparagus part, taste kind of bitter. The pork belly is ok, smells delicious just the meat can be more juicy. The agnolotti with spam filling is horrible, they should really learn how to make pasta before put that spam filling inside. The spam filling taste like canned cat food. The overall appearance looks ok when they first come because it was covered with bonito flakes. But the pasta just looks horrible and don't taste good.The server is really nice, we are unhappy with out seat at the first and they switched us to a bigger table immediately.

4.0,6/7/2015,"For a Hawaiian restaurant, Noreetuh is very simple --  no flashy restaurant sign outside (I don't think they even had a sign), minimalist interior, no gimmicks, no pretentiousness. Noreetuh's focus is the food, the execution, the taste, the creativity, the art... and I really really appreciate that. The menu was inventive and very well planned. All the dishes were beautifully presented and carefully put together. The pineapple braised pork belly was absolutely delicious. The pork belly just melted in my mouth and mixed very well with the sweetness of the pineapple and the texture of peanuts. The imperial wagyu sirloin was pretty much a beef salad but it turned out to be really good as well despite being a very small dish. The meat was cooked just right, the vegetables were fresh, and the dish overall was flavorful. The monkfish liver torchon was amazing. Even the bread that came with it was good. SKIP THE CHIPS. The kombu chips had a unique flavor but it turned out to be a little weird. For dessert, we had the crispy mochi waffles. I love mochi and I really appreciate the inventiveness of Noreetuh's mochi waffle but it just didn't cut it for me. I'm also not a big fan of waffles in general, so there's that too. The food here isn't cheap. Appetizers range from $14-$17 and entrees from $17-$25. The portions were also not the most generous so going for the entree without appetizers would not at all suffice. But again, the food was great and the whole dining experience was warm and refreshing. It was a lovely gastronomical experience and I would happily return for more.",0,0,0,Nin A.,"New York, NY",136,367,185
5.0,6/4/2015,"I really, really like this place. Obviously Hawaiian is different and could go gimmicky, but that's not the case here at all. This is a really solid restaurant with great food and terrific wine, and with lovely design and a really warm atmosphere.We loved both our starters - tuna poke is delicious with lots of great texture, and the pork croquettes are great too (not too heavy for a fried food, and the cabbage is just lightly pickled and perfect). My partner really liked the chow noodles for the main, though it's not really my taste. Strangely, I had the pork belly basically because of everything else in the dish (yams, mustard greens, peanuts) - I don't actually like pork belly. But, I loved this dish!!! For dessert, the bread pudding was really good and the macadamia nut brownie with coconut ice cream (with actual coconut flakes) was outstanding.This was a wonderful experience made even better by the friendliness of the servers and the two owners who are out on the restaurant floor.",0,0,0,Amy D.,"New York, NY",111,29,0
3.0,6/1/2015,"** 3.5 stars **This intimate, warm restaurant specializes in a rarity in NYC, Hawaiian!  I've yet to visit the Hawaiian islands, and this marks my first visit to any restaurant serving Hawaiian food (although I did sample some from a chicken stand in Portland, Oregon).  Hawaiian food appears to be an amalgam of Asian cuisines, with some interesting ingredients courtesy of its unique locale.  Noreetuh take on this cuisine is elegant and thoughtful.  Take Spam musubi, essentially a jumbo piece of sushi with grilled Spam as the main event.  Noreetuh lets corned beef tongue take over for Spam, with peanuts and cilantro adding texture and depth.  Its fun to eat and tasty, although crispier nori would have made it truly memorable.  Spam finds it way inside silky agnolotti, where its flavor subtly co-mingles with interesting dish mates: seasonal ramps, honshimeji mushrooms, slices of green almonds, and a shower of umami-loaded bonito flakes.  There are two pokes on the menu, a classic raw fish salad.  The big-eye tuna was seasoned and tossed with macadamias, pickled jalapeño, red onions, sesame, and seaweed; there's a lot going on but it works, except for the meaty fish being a touch too sinewy.  More simply satisfying were disks of smooth monkfish liver, contrasting simply with a passionfruit and pear sauce.  Pork belly was decadently tender and fatty, although the pineapple braising that the meat was purported to go through was not notable in its flavor.  The bruleed Hawaiian pineapple from the desserts, however, was a fabulous example of simplicity done right.  A half pineapple was caramelized, seasoned with some lime zest and salt, and served in its half shell.  Perfection, without trying too hard.There is a long, interesting international wine list, and wine pairings are offered with meals.  Other beverages include a few sakes, a premium Korean soju (there is such a thing?), and some draft and bottled beers (sadly, their only Hawaiian offering is no longer available).Noreetuh is cozy but comfortable, with two adjacent narrow dining areas.  It is a step up from casual but not too much.  Service is sweet and attentive.  An error on our bill (not caught by either absent-minded diner) was caught by the manager who phoned expeditiously and corrected it.  For one lacking knowledge of Hawaiian cuisine, Noreetuh still stands out for distinct ingredients and flavors.  There are great aspirations here, which sometimes stumble, but the food remains mostly interesting and fun.  It is a worthwhile experience, and its menu worth exploring again.",1,0,0,Valery C.,"Forest Hills, NY",56,837,9616
3.0,5/28/2015,My favorite vacation so far was my trip to Hawaii so I was delighted to find a nice Hawaiian food restaurant in NYC.  My dining companion got out early from work so we arrived at 7pm for an 8:15 reservation and they happily seated us.  This starving girl couldn't be more pleased.  Service throughout our meal continued to be cheerful and attentive.Snacks:Truffle taro chips - good with a strong truffle flavor but not a must try in my opinion.Corned beef tongue musubi - interesting with the peanuts inside.  Tasted good but i secretly liked the plain spam ones more though. Starters:Big eye tuna poke - my favorite of the starters.  A good amount of tuna.  It was spicy...not extremely so but just a bit.pork croquettes - fried meat and potatoes...how can you not love it?pork trotter terrine - I didn't like this one.  The best I can describe it is that it was too porky for me and the sauce that came with it didn't improve the flavor for me.Mains:Garlic shrimp over rice - The garlic shrimp trucks in Hawaii were heaven so I couldn't pass this up.  Pretty presentation but sadly it couldn't compare to the flavor from the authentic Hawaiian trucks and didn't really satisfy my craving. Pineapple braised pork belly - get this.  That is all I have to say about this dish.  It was tender flavorful (perhaps a bit on the salty side) and delicious.The two of us were too full after all the food we ordered above to fit dessert.  Maybe next time.  (Although we cleared the little wooden container of gummy candy in seconds........it was there...no sense in resisting.),1,1,1,Kate K.,"Queens, NY",27,131,15

4.0,5/16/2015,"I don't like Spam. Sometimes living with someone who likes those cans of pre-cooked meat can be tough. Whenever I see a Spam can blankly blinking back at me from our kitchen counter, I internally scream and push it into one of the cabinets. If I get asked a, ""Wait, where did the Spam go?"" I usually respond with an innocent-looking shrug and a surge in interest in whatever I happen to be doing at the time. So, I was reluctant to come here because my narrow-mindedness made me just assume that Hawaiian-inspired food would mean a lot of Spam dishes. Well, I'm here to tell you that I liked it. I'm also here to tell you that there was only one Spam dish on the menu. Hawaiian food is so much more than Spam!! A lot of the dishes here were influenced by Japanese, Korean, and Filipino cuisines, and everything we tasted was fresh and balanced. Yum. Plates were on the smaller side, but we left pretty stuffed after a snack each, a starter to share, an entree each, and a dessert to share.  -corned beef tongue musubi with cilantro and peanuts: This was their take on the classic spam musubi. The glaze was the perfect level of sweetness and the beef tongue incredibly tender. I loved the bits of peanuts in this! It really added dimension; each bite was satisfying.  -spicy gobo with wood ear mushroom and bellflower root: I was looking forward to this dish since I assumed it'd be similar to kinpira gobo (braised burdock) which I love. Unfortunately, it was a little too sweet for me and was eerily similar to the taste of seaweed salad. It wasn't the slightest bit spicy and this is coming from someone who cannot tolerate spice! The gobo was also cut into long thin shreds, and eating it from a bowl with forks was messy and unsuccessful, so chopsticks would have been appreciated.  -big-eye tuna poke with macadamia nuts, pickled jalapeño, and seaweed: Delicious! This was a well-balanced medley of ingredients that was texturally interesting, and was by consequence very beautiful and vibrant. It also didn't leave me wanting rice. The tuna was fresh and its natural taste was maintained. -chow noodles with morels, asparagus, pea tendrils: This dish confirmed the chefs' interest in using the freshest ingredients while being mindful of texture. These chow noodles, thankfully, were presented with chopsticks by their side. A decent portion of wide noodles were tossed with a heavy dose of sesame oil and soy sauce, and then combined with fantastic bites of ridgy morels, tender asparagus, and crunchy pea tendrils.  -spam agnolotti with ramps, honshimeji, green almond, bonito flakes: The dancing bonito flakes were a curious addition, but ended up being a good one because the agnolotti was surprisingly as sweet as squash (even almost had that consistency), and I was surprised at myself for liking it so much.   -king's hawaiian bread pudding with rum raisins, pineapple ice cream: Fantastic.Wine pairings started at $35 and corkage fees were $15. Wines were sold by the glass at very reasonable prices. The list was short, but a variety of types and regions were covered. Along with sake and soju, there were also draft beers and bottles. The Badass Quite a Pear hard cider was phenomenal, by the way.Likelihood of another visit:This casual, cozy restaurant had such warm service and delicious food!

Nothing special about the apps (we ordered all of them). The croquettes lacked flavor and were a bit deflated. The tuna poke was great and a must order if you go. Garlic shrimp was good. Large, plump shrimps. It's a very simple dish though and certainly doesn't garner the price tag...served with white rice, fresh pineapple, and raw romaine lettuce. The noodles were excessively salty. Couldn't taste anything else. Avoid all the apps and most of the starters except for the poke. Stick to the mains. Our service was pushy and smothering.

4.0,5/2/2015,"This new Hawaiian restaurant is quite impressive. The three founding chefs all met each other while working at Per Se, so you know that they know how to put good food on a plate. The dishes here are simple, yet elegant and delicious. The menu is very affordable with no dish over $22. Portions are a bit on the small side, so I'd advise getting an appetizer to share along with your main.We got the corned beef tongue musubi which is a glammed-up version of spam musubi - a Hawaiian staple. Next we got the big-eye tuna poke seaweed salad. I highly recommend this - the flavors meld together well and everything on the plate is very fresh. I think it's one of the most popular starters on the menu.For our mains we got the mochi-crusted fluke and the chow noodles. The chow noodles are quite spicy, so if you don't care for spice beware.

It is cramped and very narrow and hardly decorated. It felt like little effort had been put into the appearance, which was strange. I must say that it also didn't help that a baby was screaming for quite awhile a few tables away. I absolutely understand that sometimes nothing can be done and I feel for the parents but this went on for so long that it significantly diminished the dining experience.The service was good. The food was mixed. I will break it down by what we ordered.1. The silken tofu. This was nice, as I love both uni and fish eggs. The mushroom tapenade that came with it was excellent and so flavorful. 4 stars.2. The tuna poke. This was my favorite of the night. Fresh delicious cubes of tuna mixed with seaweed, macadamia nuts and some fantastic pickled jalapeños. 5 stars.3. The mochi-crusted fluke entree was disappointing. The whole dish was bland, the portion was small and the fish was overcooked. 1.5 stars.4. The spam tortellini entree was much better than the fish entree. The spam filling was salty and flavorful and mixed nicely with the runny egg yolk. It was overall an odd dish, though, with the goji berries. Interesting but strange. 3.5 stars.5. The pineapple dessert was nice. I've never had a brûléed pineapple before so it was a treat. 4 stars.Overall, I don't understand what the hype is all about.

3.0,4/26/2015,"One of my most favorite eating trips ever was a two week vacation in Hawaii, so I am always excited to try a new Hawaiian restaurant in NYC, especially since they are relatively rare here. One of the things I loved about the food there was how satisfying it was, but this meal just left me wanting more.It is easy to see that this intimate new spot is run by former Per Se chefs, as the portions are on the small side and the prices are on the high side. There are a good number of choices on the menu, most of which have some type of interesting Hawaiian influence:- Truffle Taro Chips ($11)These were pretty delicious and a nice way to start the meal. As just mentioned though, this was a little bowl for $11. I wouldn't mind less truffle and getting some complimentary chips to start instead.- Corned Beef Tongue Musubi, Cilantro, Peanut ($6)This was one of my favorites, swapping out the typical spam for some delicious tongue. This was one of the few items that was very reminiscent of the stuff I tried in Hawaii and was done exceptionally well.- Silken Tofu, Uni, Ikura, Mushroom, Shiso ($12)I'm not a big uni guy, but if you like it, chances are you also like ikura, and furthermore silken tofu, so you will probably be in heaven with this dish. The textures were just way too mushy for me to enjoy, but you should kind of expect that going in knowing the ingredients here.- Big-Eye Tuna Poke, Macadamia Nuts, Pickled Jalapeno, Seaweed ($17)This was ok. It was a little too light on the tuna though, dominated mostly by the pickled jalapeno and seaweed.- Kalua Pork Croquettes, Cabbage, Katsu Sauce ($11)These were two large discs of kalua pork encased in a crispy, fried batter, and of course very delicious. Other than the musubi, this was definitely the best bite of the meal.- Chow Noodles, Bean Sprouts, Jalapeno, Shiitake, Lily Flower, Spiced Tofu ($16)These were pretty good, but I would have loved some meat in here. Also, it was a tiny bowl of noodles that I couldn't help but notice was smaller than the size of half of the portion you get with the stellar peanut noodles at Tuome with the Pig Out feast,.- Spam Tortellini, Poached Egg, Yu Choy, Goji Berries, Chrysanthemum ($17)This one was just not good. The Tortellini seemed extremely undercooked, as each piece took work to chew through.- Macadamia Nut Brownie, Coconut Ice Cream ($9)This brownie was pretty good, but not $9 good. I believe the ice cream was from Davey's, so instead of ordering this here, go across the street to Davey's to get an even bigger, better scoop, with an excellent brownie as well if you wish.- Crispy Mochi Waffles, Whipped Peanut Butter, Alaea Salt ($8)This was actually incredible, mostly because I am a major peanut butter guy. The peanut butter on top of the light waffles was super rich and creamy, and paired with that hint of salt and the crispiness of the waffles, it was a perfect bite. Make sure you get this dessert.Overall, the meal was enjoyable. The ambiance is really nice and laid-back and the service was perfect. The food just didn't really live up to expectations and it was a little too pricey to justify and didn't wow enough to warrant a return visit.",24,8,12,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834

The dishes were creative and interesting. Our main gripe was with service. Our server had to check with a manager or the chef about 4-5 times to clarify or get approval for things (we inquired with what the family style service was --assuming it was larger portions to share with the table, but it wasn't really). He had a difficult time explaining our options. Yes, we know they had recently opened and were still getting the kinks out. But I thought our questions weren't out of the ordinary. With all that said and done we ordered and got the food we wanted. For starters we shared the beef tongue musubi (interesting spin), silken tofu, poke (tasty), and kalua pork croquettes (my favorite). Then my husband and I shared the garlic shrimp rice (I thought was delicious and flavorful) and mochi crusted fluke (nothing too exciting).

3.0,4/21/2015,"I can't say I'm completely thrilled about Noreetuh even if it was opened by three per-se alum. I was really hoping that they would take me back to my trip to Hawaii.Came here for dinner on a Wednesday night and the restaurant is definitely small. Luckily it wasn't crowded when we arrived at 7pm which confused me because according to OpenTable, the restaurant was booked solid till 10pm -- weird!Either case, the service was very high end and you do feel a sense of sophistication. Our server was delightful and attentive. However I can't say the same for the food.We ordered their truffled taro chips and it was somewhat boring. I get that the taro chips had sprinkled black truffles on top but for me it's pointless if you can't taste it.As for their spicy gobo, I thought it was good but being categorized as a snack instead of a side dish didn't make sense, especially if eaten independently on its own.We also ordered their silken tofu and visually it was beautiful and artfully put together but taste wise, it was bland and sparing. The only thing I really enjoyed were the three uni. As for the silken tofu, I think it's only about half an inch high, which is practically nothing if served in a small bowl that is about the size of my palm.The corned beef tongue musubi was okay. It wasn't packed tightly so the rice kept on falling out and the peanut with cilantro paste was bland and didn't add any additional flavor to the beef tongue or the rice.As for the big eyed tuna, I thought it was good but it's not something I care to order again. I had the same dish when I was in Hawaii at a supermarket and even that being prepared there tasted better. Perhaps quality wise, Noreetuh will surpass a supermarket but taste-wise it failed.Lastly we had their braised honeycomb tripe and I felt the dish was too saucy and salty. As a result, I couldn't really taste the tripe nor the rice cake. Instead the dish just tasted like one big flavor instead of multiple flavors being put together as one.Overall, I wish this restaurant luck but unfortunately I feel they did not deliver the Hawaiian taste that I was expecting.",2,2,1,Nga C.,"Brooklyn, NY",524,480,2034

The food is some of the better modern Hawaiian you will find outside of the islands; you see influence from Japanese, Filipino and Korean cuisine - just like the food in Hawaii. Wine list focuses on French selections a deeply discounted prices. Saw Volnay d'angerville for $95. Not just a really great bargain but a very hard wine to find in general. Kudos for curating such a great list! There's a wine pairing option for $35 that I would like to try next visit.Tried the fried mushrooms, taro chips, kombu chips, tuna poke, Kalua pork croquettes, chow noodles, king Hawaiian bread pudding and the brulee Hawaiian pineapple.  Everything was well made and presented beautifully. The chow noodles are made in house and wow. This is the one dish to not miss. Definitely a must try. The combination of the noodles with tofu and mushrooms was incredible. This dish disappeared far too fast. Need to come back to get more chow noodles as well as try the spam tortellini and silken tofu.If you are looking for flavorful food from the islands in a nice atmosphere with good wine and great hospitality, this is the spot for you.",0,0,0,Katherine M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,25,0

IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE!I dined at this small, East Village joint with two other girlfriends to wind/wine down, snack on some Hawaiian treats and catch up.We ordered the following:1. Truffled Taro Chips2. Big Eyed Tuna Poke - tasted great with the above! 3. Garlic shrimp - mouthwatering morsels of garlicky goodness!Overall, wonderful food with great flavors and presentation but way overpriced for the portion size. The great appeal about poke, spam musubis and other Hawaiian delicacies is it's good food for good prices.

3.0,4/11/2015,"Decent food, but felt mostly like decent Asian food that just cost a bit more.We stopped by as a group of 4 for dinner on a Saturday, but it took a while to get seated given how busy it was; we eventually got seated within an hour but had to sit at the bar. For starters, we split the corned beef tongue musubi, the big eye tuna poke, kalua pork croquettes, and the pork trotter terrine. The musubi was quite good, but everything else was just decent. The pork croquettes were decent and tasty but fairly ordinary, and the tuna poke was similar as in it was mostly tuna mixed with other stuff. For entrees, we split the braised honeycomb tripe, pineapple braised pork belly, mochi-crusted fluke, and the spam tortelloni. My favorite was the tripe with rice cakes, but it was unfortunately rice cake and didn't have enough tripe and a bit overwhelmed by the chili. The mochi on the fluke was entirely imperceptible, and the dishes in general were just nice and fairly ordinary. The service overall was nice, and they were very helpful with recommending dishes and soliciting feedback. I'd consider coming back at some point, but as it stands, the dishes were fairly generic, although a bit cleaner in flavor and well presented, but just a bit on the expensive end for that quality.",0,0,0,Dennis J.,"New York, NY",13,792,33
5.0,4/11/2015,"Though there are many new restaurants in the EV, Noreetuh is the best new restaurant we have tried in a while. The decor is modern-minimalist but not bare; had a cozy neighborhood feel. The host was accommodating and welcoming. We did not have a reservation, but gladly sat at the wine, beer, and most importantly, sake bar.  The bartender was equally as familiar with the drinks as with the food. We ordered the recommended spicy gobo snack, which was refreshing, slightly spicy, and delicious; followed by the fresh big-eye tuna poke containing complementary flavors.  Slightly less healthy (but amazing) were the kalua pork croquettes, a take on a a Spanish tapa with katsu sauce.  For entrees, I had the pineapple braised pork belly and my fiancée had the fluke.  We would order both again. We finished with the brownie, comfort desert      made special by the accompanying coconut ice cream with sea salt. We would absolutely go back and recommend highly!",0,0,0,Tyler T.,"New York, NY",0,5,0
5.0,4/10/2015,"Brilliant. Every flavor was a perfect note in a melody of food. We started with the truffle taro chips and silken tofu, which was silky and delicious.  We followed with the monkfish torchon, which was accompanied with Hawaiian bread, and the hearts of palm - the flavors of the monkfish were well completed by the sweetness of the passion fruit, and hearts of palm salad made me smile. The combination of the shallots and cilantro left a taste that was unique and memorable but not cloying. On to the entrees - mochi-crusted fluke was expertly prepared and the bok choy added a really nice texture to the fish, and a nice counter to the sweetness of the kabocha squash. Chow noodles? Yum.  Just, yum.  Eat them up. Everything was served in a timely manner and for a new restaurant, no ""oopses"" like rapid or slow courses, or an entree showing up before the app. I really can't wait to go back - i usually don't try to be an armchair food writer, but this place was pretty darn awesome.",1,0,0,K G.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,79,0

4.0,4/9/2015,"The only words I can use to describe noreetuh are with adjectives- pretty adjectives: woodsy, oceany seawater, smokey, umami, chewy, comforting. After food gawking from a Gothamist article about noreetuh, I somehow made the decision that I HAD to get there before it blows up. Plus they had poke! Including some truffle & sea urchin on the menu, thought it was all an interesting mix, super excited that they have a ""Hawaiian-inspired"" menu. Noreetuh takes reservations, but it seems to have been very busy since opening. For a table, I'd say you'll need to book 1-2wks in advance. They have 6 bar stools for walk-ins. The Boy and I went at 6:30 on a Wednesday, zero wait and got a cozy spot at the front section of the bar. The front door host was extremely nice and the staff was Very attentive all night; making sure water glasses were filled & plates coming out in perfect timing. The restaurant itself is very small, holding exactly two tables for 2, two for 4, one large table for 4-5, and a round large booth in the back room (seemed like the guests at the back table were regualrs). Even though seating is limited, it has a nice relaxed feel though, you don't feel cramped, and the lighting and industrial minimal wood dark gray design creates a warm & cool atmosphere, if that makes sense. They turned up the 80's R&B later in the night (MJ & Monica!). Large single bathroom too. A guy that looked like one of the Owner's brother came in and his brother pulled a stool up to the bar for him, for a glass of cider and app. The was another diner there that had a 'famous' aura to him, dining at a large table, looked a little like Adrien Brody, but with light brown man bun well-conditioned curls. Can't put my finger on him.. The food: total about $95$12 Glass of red wine, soucherie$12 Silken Tofu, Uni (sea urchin), Ikura (Salmon Roe), Shitake paste, shiso leaves: seawater meets the woods. umami. I didn't know what to expect, but it was a great combination of the creaminess of the tofu (about an 1"" deep), salt of the Uni & broth/soy on top, bright bursts of the roe, and a little kick of shiso. I do wish there was a little more light to see what we were eating, asked the bartender what the brown paste was. It was like the most dense mushrooms compote you'll ever eat. Nice contrast. Highly recommend.$11 Truffle Taro Chips: salty paper thin taro chips with black truffle shavings. I tasted more salt than truffle, but then I'm not exactly versed in truffle flavor. The Boy said that it's mild, like an aromatic vanilla after taste. He approved.$17 Big-eye tuna poke, mac nuts, jalapeño, seaweed, red onion: decent portion for poke. I could only eat half of it- too much rawness for me- perfect to share, but the tuna cubes were extra fresh- didn't taste too much marinade after the first bite (sesame oil drizzle used?) I think the jalapeño and bits of red onion made up for it, but after a while the heat from the jalapeño took over. We cut up the large bits of yellow seaweed, it provided a nice textural contrast. Were there some fennel leaves in there? It was good but I probably wouldn't get this again as the jalapeño was overpowering in the end.$17 Spam tortellini, poached egg, Chinese broccoli rabe, goji berries, white slightly bitter aerated cream sauce: excellent & inventive. Warm and comforting. The tortellini was fresh & were handmade little puffs of cheese & spam purée with a few larger pieces of spam. The pasta noodle part was chewy and hearty. I only got to only try a bite of this main since it wasn't mine, but it looked great- breaking the egg & mixing it in a little and the touch of chinese greens also.$16 Chow noodles, shitake, smoked tofu, jalapeño, broiled lily flower, bean sprouts, cilantro, scallion: Smokey. That's what I got from it. The handmade noodles were hearty and had a nice chew. I'm not quite sure if I listed all of the ingredients in this dish- there were so many contrasting, yet hearty flavors. I wanted to lay them out separately on the dish & take a pic, but that would be Way too Yelp of me for the Boy. The broiled lily flowers were a nice surprise and gave a sort of bamboo shoot like texture. Generous amounts of shitake and tofu. The tofu wasn't that gross dried smoked tofu that you find tossed upon the tops of $3 noodles, it was moist, flexible as the shitake, but meatier. I'm guessing made in house or from a high quality place. This dish seemed very Malaysian or Chinese inspired. Overall, a nice fancee but casual dining experience. Slightly high for my price range, but the main dishes where definitely worth it. The overall quality shows in the food & execution. Good luck to the chefs and owners!PS. Not sure if they added to the decor because of a Yelper's comment. But not a fan of the laser-printed canvases that they had up. Dumbs it down. Stay with the natural minimal themes please! Maybe a honeycomb wood panels, small ceramic objects, or little flat versions of your gold pineapple.",2,0,0,Joyce C.,"Long Island City, NY",54,237,3875

4.0,4/6/2015,"Very excited for this place to open since there are not many restaurants in nyc that serve anything resembling hawaiian food. This restaurant elevates hawaiian comfort food, which is expected since the team behind it have some impressive past projects. That being said, expect the usual high price tag and small portion sizes that comes with the increased level of sophistication. Overall the food was excellent and the staff was wonderfully warm, attentive and courteous.  There was a $15 corkage fee which is extremely reasonable, but maybe we'll try some of their wine pairings next time. As starters we ordered the poke, musubi, croquette and pork terrine. The poke was great, very silky cubes of tuna with excellent flavors. The seaweed was fresh and crunchy but I wish the ratio of fish to seaweed was a little higher. I also thought the nuts should have been served finer (they were a little overpowering being as large as they were-practically whole). We would have ordered 3 more and one to go if the price tag was anything like poke bowls in Hawaii. We LOVED the beef tongue musubi. Simple as that. The kalua pork croquette was good, but to me the flavor came from the dipping sauce, not enough from the smokiness of the pork. The pork terrine was liked by the other people at the table but I was neutral. For entrees we ordered the pork belly, spam torteloni and garlic shrimp. The shrimp were as delicious as expected. Like a north shore shrimp truck but x3 the cost :) Ours were fresh and they got the garlic spot on (not overpowering). I'd pass on the spam torteloni... It was very rich and salty but the flavor was somewhat bland (and the spam taste really did not come through). The pork belly was wonderfully tender and the sauce was excellent. We split a macnut brownie with coconut ice cream for dessert. It was as straightforwardly delicious as it sounds (but maybe we'll get a little braver and try something more inventive next time). We're excited to go back and try the items we missed :) Keep it up Noreetuh!",0,0,0,Lexi P.,"Honolulu, HI",5,28,10
3.0,4/6/2015,"Hawaiian food with a Hawaiian! I've been to Honolulu and loveddd the food so I was excited to try this. Opened by 3 Per Se alum's? It has to be amazing, right? WRONG.I would only recommend the following- Corned beef tongue musubi- Silken tofu: All the flavors came together very well and it's also hard to mess up uni- Tuna poke: The texture of the seaweed, fish and heat of the jalalpeno really came together. - King's Hawaiian bread puddingUnfortunately the rest of the meal wasn't as outstanding- Kalua pork croquettes: Not much flavor without the dipping sauce- Garlic shrimp over rice: The shrimp came out luke warm and there wasn't much flavor. The Hawaiian said he could cook better garlic shrimp- Braised honeycomb tripe: This was by far the worst dish. We took one bite of the rice cake which was was hard and tasted of gas. The first dish I have ever sent back in a restaurant. - Crispy mochi waffles: The idea of it sounds great but the execution was disappointing. It tasted like hard stale bread with peanut butter and drizzled with honey.They offer wine parings starting at $35 for 3 glasses. We were served champagne and two whites. They are light with the pours, I would recommend getting a bottle of wine instead. I really wanted to like you Noreetuh but everything fell short of expectations. The portions were small and the meal was not worth $200+. There are too many restaurants in NYC to come back here again.

3.0,4/4/2015,"This rating is really closer to a 3.5 but yelp won't allow for it.  I really wanted to love this place because it's so hard to find quality Hawaiian or Hawaiian-inspired food here in NYC.  I was so excited to try this place that I made a reservation pretty much as soon as I heard about it opening.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed by our experience here.  We ordered the silken tofu with uni, the ahi poke and two orders of the garlic shrimp and rice plate.  The uni and tofu was a surprisingly delicious combination, and I would recommend this as a starter.  Even better was the ahi poke with a few different types of seaweed and a kick from some pickled jalapeño.  Sadly, the positives end there.  Our waitress was very sweet and attentive.  Trouble was that we waited for a long time between each course.  We probably waited about 30 mins for our poke and another 40 for our entree.  By the time we got our shrimp dishes, we were thrilled to be digging into our dish.  First, we were really sad to find that the shrimp was inexplicably lukewarm in temperature - definitely not hot.  Had it been sitting in the window all this time?  We couldn't figure it out.  It was also under-seasoned (needed more salt).  I wanted to bring the temperature issue to our waitress, but then decided it wasn't worth it to wait another 30 minutes for another dish.  We continued to eat.  A couple of shrimp in, I discovered that the shrimp wasn't fully cooked.  There were parts of some shrimp that were still rubbery and translucent.  I couldn't excuse this too.  I finally waived down the waitress and expressed my disappointment.  She apologized and I asked if I could order a different dish.  She allowed me to do so.  I ordered the pork belly instead.   In the meantime, my fiancé continued to eat his shrimp and later discovered that some of his shrimp were also not fully cooked.  He just ate around it.  To their credit, the pork belly came out pretty quickly and the manager said that he hoped this dish would work out better for me.  However, he didn't apologize for the shrimp being undercooked and cold, and I interpreted his comment and failure to apologize like the shrimp was just not to my taste.  I wasn't aware that the dish I orderedwould come undercooked... Anyway, they did remove one of the shrimp entrees from our bill (but still charged us for the new dish).  The pork belly was much better:  tender, flavorful and this time, fully cooked!Overall, I wish I could praise this restaurant but I just didn't have a great experience there today.  I know they recently opened, so perhaps they need some time to work out the kinks.  But shrimp is pretty simple to cook, and I would hope that former Per Se chefs should know how to cook shrimp properly.  Long story short, I'm sad to say that I will not be rushing back to this restaurant.",1,0,0,Tiffany C.,"Manhattan, NY",1,54,6
4.0,4/2/2015,"Sometimes, there are certain things about a restaurant that stand out- the decor, the service, the food, etc. For me, at Noreetuh, it was the music. I am completely unashamed to admit that I was happy to hear Nick Jonas' ""Chains"" playing softly in the background.While the music was exciting and unexpected, the restaurant itself was pretty bare bones. No art on the wall, no photos, no color, nothing. Perhaps, they're going for the ""minimalist"" approach.  The restaurant is very small. It can probably serve about 20-25 people, that's including the bar area. This accounts for the 30+ min wait I had for a seat. I did notice that there is a separate ""private dining room"" in the back, which can probably fit a few more guests. The food is very flavorful and light and each dish looks like it's carefully composed on the plate. The only problem was with the speed [or there lack of] in which it came from the kitchen. There is no cocktail list, just wine.__Food:Silken Tofu [$12]: I told the server that this dish tasted like the ocean. I was not kidding. The uni was exceptionally fresh and briny and the fish roe burst in your mouth. This was the perfect starter, in size and in taste. Pork Trotter Terrine [$12]: Curiously, I was expecting more of a traditional presentation rather than what resembled a crudo or carpaccio. I enjoyed the shrimp sauce, as it had a nice spicy tang. The vegetables livened up the dish and provided a much needed crunch. Spam Tortellini [$17]: This was probably the dish that I was least impressed with. It was still very good but just not as great as the others. The tortellini, which seems like it was made in-house, was cooked just right. The spam inside was very mild, you could probably mistake it for any meat in the world. I was disappointed that the poached egg did not run when it was broken into, that probably would have been the highlight of the meal. Dessert: Bruleed Hawaiian Pineapple [$10]: Dessert took a while to arrive, which was noticed by the kitchen, as they sent out a complimentary pineapple. I'm really glad I didn't order it on my own. It's really just caramelized pineapple. Bread Pudding [$8]: I definitely enjoyed the bread pudding as it was made with King's Hawaiian Bread. It was sweet but not cloyingly so. You couldn't tell that the ice cream served was pineapple, it was delicate. __The bill came to $53 which isn't terribly expensive but the kitchen has a few kinks to work out before I come back.",1,0,0,Felisa F.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,198,192
4.0,4/2/2015,"I saw something about some per se/jungshik alums venturing on this Korean/ Hawaiian/ Portuguese culinary adventure and as a bit of a skeptic about asian fusion, I was curious.After last night's exquisite meal, I will surely  recommend this to others who miss the big Island and enjoy some depth and that little kick to their food :)We were so excited to try the corned beef tongue musubi and oh my lord...I could eat 10 of these in one sitting! After washing down the musubi with some local beer, my friend and I went to work on the heart of palm/beet salad with crispy shallots and smoked tofu.  The tofu was interesting but wish it was a bit smokier or maybe even a little spicy?  Regardless, the dish was enjoyed and it was a nice palate starter. We moved on to the kampachi and soppressata, eggplant relish, and basil and as the kampachi was served sashimi style- it was almost too pretty to eat! So yummy and I can't stop thinking about how weird but well the dish came together.We then opted for the mochi crusted fluke which was a bit salty but nice chewy exterior layer and the braised honey comb tripe with rice cake and bamboo shoots which my friend and I were left yearning for that spicy kick we'd imagine from a dish resembling dduk bokki, it was still good! We ended the meal with a  Brûléed pineapple dessert and wow, I don't like desssert but this I could eat all day. It was the perfect finish with the lime zest and salt...yum.While their wine selection was great, I wish they had a cocktail list as it would be fun to see what they can stir up while paying homage to the 3 very distinct countries.

5.0,4/1/2015,"I found a little gem tucked away near the St Mark's area. Noreetuh did nothing less than impress with their appetizers (round of applause to those yummy taro chips), those little pork potato buns that I can't recall the name of, ugh and their big eye tuna poke...so delicious. I've never tried poke before and I'm glad this was my first try. The seasoning was really nice, light, crisp with a hint of sesame oil...plus the seaweed made the whole dish come together. I ordered the flat iron steak with miso sauce and that was mouth watering. I loved the side of green beans and bean sprouts as it gave the dish a source of light and fresh tastes in between the miso sauce and steak bites. The meat was cooked to perfection. Finally for dessert, we went a little overboard with three dishes which included the Mochi waffles with whipped peanut butter, pineapple brûlée, and the Hawaiin bread pudding. The latter two were my favorite. The pineapple was deelicious! The atmosphere of the restaurant is really nice; intimate, cozy, and you'd be surprised with the extra space they have on the side and in the back. This would be the perfect place for a date night.
