5.0,4/13/2019,"Wow, where do I start? I checked into the Marriott Residence Inn and then hit Yelp up for some dining ideas. Up pops this place on the first page, 1100ft from my current location with 4+ stars. Seafood and steaks, yea, sounds like a plan. Walked in and grabbed a seat at the bar. I am a bourbon guy and I could see right away, this place was my sort of place. I spy Pappy Van Winkle staring back at me on the first row. I decided that I didn't want to mortgage the house this evening so I asked for my standard, Woodford Reserve with a big ice cube. Check the box. The  bartender, Ben, hands me a menu while I watch me neighbor to the left of me putting away a lobster that looks amazing. I decide to go with the lobster bisque to start things off. He brings it out and its grand, nice bits of lobster and creamy goodness. For the entree, I ask for the blackened swordfish and creamed spinach side. Both are delivered as I am starting on my second drink. This time, a recommendation from Ben from a small whiskey distillery in Tennessee. Definitely amazing. The swordfish is perfect and the creamed spinach, the same. I would order both again, no questions asked. As I am eating my entree, I hit the check-in button on Yelp and up pops a dessert offer. I show it to Ben and he suggests either the chocolate lava cake or the the pecan pie. I am pecan pie man. For fun, he hooks me up with a gratis shot of Angels Envy Rye. According to Ben, its a match made in heaven with the sweetness of the pie. I am perplexed but lift the glass on my second bite of pie. Who would have guessed that rye whiskey would be a flavor enhancer for pecan pie? If you are in town and looking for a great dining experience, I would recommend this place all day long.

5.0,3/31/2019,"Amazing  steak and seafood restaurant in midtown east, you get the best of both worlds, one of the best steaks I have been to in Manhattan and I have been to quite a few nice steakhouses in NYC. The steaks are at least 60Days aged so the steaks - porterhouse, NY strip with bones are very flavorful, highly recommend this place, definitely a great place to bring a date and parking lots are near by and parking is best on the weekends.

The bar is in the front and the more formal, quieter dining room is in the back.Service was very quick and polite. I loved the drink there- Love Potion 2 & 1/3 - it was delicious!!! I think I'm going to learn how to make it for myself at home!We ordered the fish tacos, burger sliders, and fries. They are all very big portions, much bigger than we expected! The fish tacos on the day we went were seared tuna. They were definitely yummy but I would've preferred maybe a different fish. They also use buffalo sauce on top, which my date and I felt were overpowering. The burger sliders and fries were as great as you would expect. I actually really enjoyed the burger sliders- the beef had lots of flavor and was cooked perfectly (I asked for medium).",1,0,0,Priya R.,"Washington, DC",16,33,109

4.0,3/17/2019,"Came here twice -- once this past summer to celebrate a graduation and once last weekend to celebrate my mom's birthday. I was very impressed by the food quality the first time I went. As often happens when you have high expectations, I was a bit disappointed the second time around.The first time I was there, I was in a party of 4 and we shared a Rib-Eye steak, squid-ink pasta, and two fish dishes. Everything tasted very good except for one of the fish dishes.This time, I was in a party of 5. For appetizers we ordered the steak tartare, crab cake, grilled octopus, and scallops. I ordered the porterhouse steak this time. While I thought the rib-eye steak I had last summer was on the level of the best NYC steakhouses, I must say I felt the porterhouse was 2nd tier. I'm not sure whether it was the quality of the meat or the ""done""-ness of the meat, but the dry-aged porterhouse lacked the ""melt-in-your-mouth"" element of porterhouses at some of the nice steakhouses in the city.Service was okay.",1,0,0,Andrew L.,"FL, FL",171,1,7

We ordered the Porterhouse for two and there was none to take home because it was cooked perfectly and couldn't stop eating eat. The truffled mashed potatoes have been on my mind since we left that night. The crab cake had this sauce on the side that worked so well with it. Ugh writing this review just has me wishing I was back there again. Oh and the lobster Mac and cheese was good as well but if you had to choose one side order the truffled mash potatoes are it!

From the time we entered the restaurant to the time we left I felt nothing but care from the staff. EXCELLENT staff members in all departments. The wait staff was extremely communicative, the hostess was extremely kind, it was just good vibes all around. I got the surf & turf & my bf had the swordfish. My surf & turf had the most well cooked filet mignon I've ever had. My preference is medium & it was perfection. The size of the lobster tail was skimpy bc they give you shrimp & a piece of crab leg as well. Not really my thing I just wanted lobster tail & the steak, delicious nonetheless.

3.0,2/23/2019,"Fresh, interesting dishes set in a backdrop of low lighting and quiet ambiance...where only men serve you. I saw one female employee on a busy Saturday night in roaring late December. She checked our coats. There was every foreign accent one could possibly hear, but apparently women don't speak the same language. Most of the experience we had was positive. We are from Tampa, and have a ton of great seafood and steakhouse options. So this isn't really a special thing for us. That said, most of the dishes were great, some were only so so. We spent over $300 for three people, one being a teenager that eats a toddler sized portion. Two drinks. One app. Two salads. Three entrees. That's it. $300.The opportunity to be in a quiet place after a long day of NYC was the best thing we got for the money. Some of the attitudes here are uppity. You work at a restaurant. It's not that big of a deal, Buddy. Snooty waitstaff is always a laugh, but it can become grating. This did. The food they try to pass off as broccoli rabe tasted and looked like frozen spinach thawed out and mixed with tons of minced garlic. It was not consumable. It ruined the taste of other better prepared menu items. I would go back for the atmosphere, but hope the attitudes are on low and the food on high.",1,1,0,Tina L.,"Tampa, FL",40,5,0

For the entrees, we ordered the Branzino and crab pasta. Pasta and crabs were so fresh paired with a perfect creamy sauce. The chef did a great job to make the branzino boneless, def catered to American style. The meat was surprisingly tender and not rough.

The atmosphere was the same, high-class so my expectations were pretty high.The food was great, I ordered a tuna tartare, the Mediterranean Branzino, their cream of spinach and lobster Mac n cheese but what I felt was lacking was the service. We felt pretty neglected once we got inside and it took a while for us to place our order in. The waiters were nice and all but I felt like nobody really wanted to help us. I was happy that they were really consistent with refilling our waters up until one time there was a small piece of god knows what that was floating around in my cup after they refilled it and I didn't expect that from a place I held such a high standard for. FYI: we found an offer for a creme brûlée for my first check in on yelp but we were denied it since we ordered from the restaurant week menu, so that was disappointing.

All of the food (including the white fish spread and crackers at the beginning) was AMAZING.

3.0,1/9/2019,"We booked this place for New Years Eve dinner and atmosphere was sexy with a nice tone. The staff were very attentive and accommodating; a big plus for me because I deserve to treated as Beyoncé. The drinks were made with perfection, we tried the ""Primo Loco"" and ""Love Potion"". Unfortunately, we were not all that impressed with the food. I'm all about layers of flavors and the food was basic in taste. We started off with a half dozen of the West Coast Oysters, which were mediocre in taste, for me they lacked that sweetness I was expecting. Come to think of it they may have accidentally given me East Coast Oysters. For main courses we ordered the Filet Mignon with the Truffle Mashed Potatoes and Asparagus, and the Stuffed Whole Lobster. The Filet Mignon was average and my wife compared the mashed potatoes to box-instant mashed potatoes (I laughed as I wrote that). The Stuffed Whole Lobster was unevenly prepared with some parts being tougher than others. I appreciated the juiciness of the parts they weren't tough. The crab stuffing was juicy and succulent, and the dipping sauce was on point; we skipped dessert.Will we be back ? Unfortunately not, the price of the bill didn't match the quality of the food. We spent $297.00 for service and atmosphere-all in all I give Seafood Fire Grill a 3.5.",0,0,0,Ayanna S.,"New York, NY",2,23,33

Crab cake was big, and full of big lumps of crab. Not sure what the purées or sauces on the side of the crab cake are but the green one pairs pretty well with the crab cake.I had the lamb rare, my boyfriend had the squid ink spaghetti with lobster, and we had a side of Brussels sprouts and lobster Mac n cheese. The lamb was cooked rare as I requested, very juicy and fresh. The broccoli rabe side it came tasted garlicky in a good way. Loveeeeeed the lobster Mac it's super cheese and full of large lumps of lobster. The Brussels sprouts were cooked well, not bitter and had a sweet flavor to it. My boyfriend loved his pasta dish, it was cooked al dente and the sauce was creamy but not overwhelmingly heavy.

5.0,11/1/2018,"Jeffrey and I had dinner at SFG the other night. Let me tell you all about it.First when you walk in the bar area is a little loud. I immediately thought it was the wrong place to have a nice dinner because if it was going to be as loud as it was in the front I just wouldn't eat there. They take us to the back of the restaurant which is beautiful and much quieter.We were greeted immediately and I ordered a sparkling water. It was Saratoga from New York. Normally when you get Saratoga sparkling water it's around the $5 to $6 range, but they charged $8. Not really a big deal just wanted to put that out there.pWhen we ordered it was if we had never eaten before! Here is what we chose for our appetizers:12 Oysters (delicious)Steak Tartare (outstanding)Imported burrata with Maine lobster (I kid you not, the most amazing burrata I have ever had)Now for the main course:He ordered the seared tuna (he didn't care for it at all. had to send it back, and he didn't order anything else because it left a bad taste in his mouth)I ordered the special of the day: a seared duck breast with a pomegranate bordelaise sauce. OMG, I love duck and this one was absolutely amazing.Now for dessert. (I have to be honest, Jeffrey doesn't like sweets which works out for me because I order one for him and eat both!)I ordered a warm pecan pie with vanilla ice cream and for me I ordered a passion fruit panna cotta. WOW the presentation of this was stunning and the flavors where soi intense but in the best possible way!!All in all go to the SFG. It is a bit pricy but it's worth every penny!",1,0,0,Jayson C.,"New York, NY",1039,246,1209
4.0,10/31/2018,"Yesterday was my husband's three year sober anniversary, which is a pretty big deal, seeing that it took him 18 years to get there. We eat out quite a bit, and he tends to be a bit picky.  I wanted to find the right place to have a nice dinner. The last thing I wanted was to have dinner be an epic fail. But, I also like taking risks, so I chose the Sea Fire, even though we'd never been there. This has been on my list to check out. And, it did not disappoint.When we first arrived, I admit, we both had panic in our eyes. You walk in to the bar area, which, to me felt like a restaurant still clinging to its 70s/80s old New York roots. It definitely didn't feel like a first class restaurant or what I was expecting. Jayson was minutes from suggesting we go elsewhere. But it was also very misleading, because once you walk past the bar area, you're into a beautiful, elegant and inviting dining room that invokes a ""now, this is what I'm talking about,"" feeling.There are two dining rooms. One's a bit on the dim side, and very simply stated. The other is stunning, with its open fire place across the room, and tables filled with guests enjoying fine wine and gourmet fare.The service was outstanding. From the waiters to the back waiters and the maître d', everyone was in fine form, and at the top of the game. They were extremely attentive, without being overbearing, and always going the extra step to make guests are happy.I say this a lot, but it's true. Many times when a server finds out we don't drink, we get forgotten about. So I appreciate restaurants like this, which have a huge wine catalog, and get a large dining crowd who spend a lot on their wines and drinks, which doesn't treat us with any less attention because we are a sparkling water drinking table.In fact, I actually forgot about that until after we left, it was that much of an non-issue.There were a couple of choices I didn't care for. We started off with a half a dozen oysters. I'm a huge oyster guy. It's become an addiction. And I was not crazy about the ones here. They just weren't particularly good, and I was pretty disappointed with that. I expected more, especially given that they were at market price. I never ever leave an oyster, especially if I've only ordered a half a dozen. It was a push to eat the five I did. They were that unappealing. And, who serves horseradish that tastes like dried grass?I then had the steak tartare, which was just phenomenal. Jayson had the lobster burrata, which was leaps and bounds from any other we've had. Jayson's eyes watered up with pure ecstasy with each bite, and that's not an exaggeration. He said it was the best burrata he's ever had. And this is a man who knows his cheeses, and is often picky with the way places serve their burrata. It was a mouthful of pure delight.He had the seared pressed duck. It was one of the daily specials, and it was cooked just right, and mouthwatering.I had the seared tuna, which wasn't my favorite. I actually didn't like it at all and sent it back, which I'm loathe to do. What happened next, completely caught me off guard. The manager instantly came over and expressed genuine concern that my tuna was not to my liking, and tried to making things right, which I declined because everything was right and exceptional. One dish that didn't sit well with me at this restaurant didn't remotely bother me because I was certain it was not a common thing. Plus, everything had been great. Still, that is the sign of good management, good restauranting and an example of what sets certain places apart from the rest. I was very impressed, and I'm not often or easily impressed.But truly everything was exceptional, especially the service, which is as important as anything else.OMG, the desserts. I'm not a sweets guy or a dessert person. But I tasted Jayson's passion fruit panna cotta and it was so sumptuous. He also ordered something with espresso ice cream. I didn't taste it, but let's just say his dish was empty pretty quick.I highly recommend.This is one of those moments where I wish Yelp had half star options, as this is definitely closer to a 4 1/2 experience.

Our server Ari was very nice and polite. We shared a bottle of red Italian wine, but the wine list was so extensive that it was difficult to choose.

The octopus was cooked perfectly and the romesco that came with it had so much flavor.For our mains, I went with the Surf and Turf and had my filet cooked medium rare. The red wine sauce that it all sat in was incredible and it was cooked just right. Another member of my party also enjoyed the filet cooked medium well. The other two members went with the Salmon (which was so fluffy and delicious), and the mushroom seabass special. Everyone loved their entrees! We also had to get a side of the famous Lobster Mac n' Cheese and it was truly incredible. Such a perfect balance of the cheeses and lobster. We also went with the New York Style blueberry Cheesecake which was AMAZING. So creamy yet so fluffy and flavorful. They also put a candle on it and the waiter sang happy birthday to me which was very sweet!The portions are definitely huge and worth the money - I saw a lot of others leaving with the to-go boxes because of how much food there is.

We began our meal with salads. Although the Caesar Salad was not on the menu, it was made available for one member of our party.  The ambience, the food and the service made for a perfect evening.

5.0,10/6/2018,"First night in NYC for the weekend. Here to see Aida at the Met . Found Sea Fire on Yelp and decided to give it a go. Couldn't have been more pleased. From the perfectly grilled calamari to start the meal, through our superb Halibut and Tuna, and capped off by an an amazing piece of pecan pie, the food was truly fantastic . And the service matched the outstanding level of the food. Jaime, our primary waiter, was helpful but not pushy with suggestions, and was engaging in a manner that was absolutely delightful. The rest of the staff found a perfect balance between attending to our needs (e.g. water, bread etc) and leaving us to each other. Loved this place!",0,0,0,Larry A.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,7,0
5.0,10/5/2018,Came here on a Friday night. Wow. Just wow. This place is so good. Literally I am not exaggerating this is the best steak in NYC. Don't talk about Peter Luger don't talk about Benjamin don't talk about any of them.  This is the place. I am a NY native and have been to them all. Listen to me- get the porter house steak. First of all it's HUGE second of all it's amazing. Got it medium and it was perfect. Seasoning was amazing. I know I sound like I'm kissing this restaurant ass but I actually am. I have never not had steak without a side or sauce or anything. This I can literally eat by itself. We also had the king crab  legs. Wow wow wow wow these were perfect. And the lobster Mac and cheese. I am just at a loss of words. And the service- unmatched. Our waiter Tom was amazing. Tom Tom Tom he knew the menu like the back of his hand. He was so amazing too 5 waiters ive ever had. He was so sweet and took care of us. Honestly he felt like fam. If management is reading this I really hope you guys give this guy a bonus or something because as someone who has probably traveled to over 30 countries and have eaten at a million restaurants- he is by far the best waiter I've ever had. The food was so good. The ambiance is dark and very nice for date nights and big groups. I think the manager was here too- a guy with a gray suit. He also was lovely. I will DEF be back again for sure. Thank you TOM and thank you sea fire grill.,0,0,0,Ashley A.,"Huntington Station, NY",326,27,96

I'd recommend getting the broiled lobster, which will be de-shelled for you by the servers. The creme brulee will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth guest while the passion fruit panna cotta is well balanced.Overall awesome experience - I would recommend as the food is worth the price.",1,0,0,Chris N.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,4,0

It is more dark than light and more noisey than quiet. We got oysters which were probably the best oysters we've ever had. I got the red snapper (it was the special of the night) and my boyfriend got the tuna. Sadly, my red snapper was extremely dry, it was hard to swallow it. I was expecting so much better from a place like this and was pretty disappointed. My boyfriends tuna was amazing though. It was cooked perfectly and the flavors were great.

4.0,9/20/2018,"This place is great! It might be a little overpriced for the portions you get. I've been here three times and overall experience was great. However, the last time I went I was a little disappointed as I ordered sea bass but they didn't have any and substituted with a stripe bass which wasn't as good. There were also a couple of drunk and immature guys at the bar area - seems like they were coming from work but they were creepy and one was weirdly lying on the floor for a little bit. Anyway, not punishing the restaurant for that! I'd certainly go back! Scallops are so good and they just melt in your mouth like butter! I just wished portions were bigger or price was adjusted.

I would've loved to have tasted it with the lobster, and truffle oil but meh. For the main course I had the squid ink spaghetti, with lobster. I did not find it too tasty, it was bland, lacked parmigiana cheese, and salt. I tried my sisters halibut but wasn't a fan of the taste either. The deserts were fantastic!! I had the passion fruit flan (?) I loved that they put the sour seeds on top along with fresh fruit, and the chocolate ganache- wonderful. I tasted my sisters pecan pie AMAZING- I never had a warm piece of pecan pie before, and the lemon cream was a great combination.

4.0,6/19/2018,Unfortunately I did not try the seafood at this restaurant which is known for its seafood but the squid ink noodles with chicken were good! We went at lunch and almost every table was filled so it's a popular lunch destination. Despite the number of people I didn't find myself having to shout to speak to people across the table so it's not a bad destination for business meetings. The squid ink noodles were good but to be honest I didn't quite taste much from it. Maybe it was because I subbed in chicken for the dish but they tasted rather flavorless. My colleagues who ordered the seafood dishes really enjoyed their meals though.,0,0,0,Matt M.,"Philadelphia, PA",253,80,160
4.0,6/18/2018,I came here last Saturday for my birthday dinner and I must say this restaurant was nothing but amazing. The ambience was very nice and intimate.

She immediately helped me out and made me a fantastic mojito. For my meal, I ordered the seafood sampler and a cup of lobster bisque. The presentation of my sampler was picture perfect. There was an array of raw items and tasty dipping sauces to go with it. To follow up my delicious seafood platter, my bisque was the perfect complement to my meal. It was creamy, had chunks of lobster, and had great flavor. Overall, I'm glad I chose this place.

3.0,6/15/2018,"To some degree, this was exactly the expected experience for an expensive American steak and seafood house. And nothing more. The fish was reasonably fresh, and a little bit overcooked, and a reasonably decent sauce. The porterhouse for two was done as expected, and again reasonably good but not particularly bursting in flavor like I have had at some other steakhouses. The service was good also. I feel somewhat bad rating this place three stars, because I don't have any particular criticisms, but I do feel like at the price level I should've been wowed in at least one way.",0,0,0,Mike G.,"Manhattan, NY",3,20,1

I had the wedge salad - which was a mix of goat and blue - which I've never had but a great statement salad to start. Now strap in.

2.0,6/3/2018,"Ugh, where do I begin? McDreamy and I had such high hopes for this restaurant. It was going to be the capstone meal to our Hamilton weekend getaway. Yeah, that's right. We were happily singing songs of King George and the American Revolution after the matinée and couldn't wait to experience a meal at this highly reviewed seafood restaurant.We arrived a few hours early (around 6ish) for our late evening reservation just on the off chance that they had an available table for two hungry lovers of musical theater. The place was nearly empty while the servers hovered around the foyer. At this point, we should have known to politely excuse ourselves to find another restaurant.Needless to say, we were seated promptly by a very happy waiter who took our drink orders. We were served bread and multi-grain crackers with a trio of toppings. It was nice to put something in our very empty bellies but there was nothing extraordinary about the course. We both ordered lobster bisque for our appetizer course. Bad move. It was more like a thin, weak broth with some lobster meat sitting in the bottom of the bowl. It needed butter. It needed cream. It needed a chef who understood the difference between a thick, creamy bisque and a bland soup.Why we didn't leave at this point, I don't know. Perhaps we're gluttons for punishment. Perhaps it's because we'd already ordered our entrees and would have felt bad leaving at that point. I'd chosen an entree of halibut with gnocchi and fava beans. My guy had ordered the seared tuna over bok choy, which he swears was a giant stalk of celery. It looked good and he said it was 'alright' given he ordered it medium rare and the center was still cold. The halibut dish was fine. None of the flavors of the separate ingredients meshed with the others. I found myself scooping little bits of each component to bring flavor to any given mouthful. The last quarter of the halibut was still raw so I left it uneaten. Granted, I eat sushi all the time. But I wasn't going to take any chances.At this point, we were already invested in the experience, so we went all in and ordered a molten chocolate cake to share for dessert. It was meh; small, more raw than molten and completely forgettable except for the fact that it was totally meh.My guy was so disappointed with this choice that it's now 24 hours later and he's still openly regretting his choice of restaurant. We really wanted this to be a special evening given how long I've wanted to see a show, THIS show, in the city. We were so ready to leave that the abnormally long wait to be handed our outrageously expensive bill was a session of pure agony. I can't even explain how tortuous it was to watch the waiters standing around oblivious of the clientèle while we counted down the minutes to the Caps game.In conclusion, this place is so overrated on Yelp there really needs to be a recalibration of the ratings. We will not be returning to this restaurant. Giving the place 2 stars was an exercise in generosity. I gave them a boost from a single star simply because the hosts and waiters were pleasant.",4,4,0,Amy B.,"Bethesda, MD",32,69,6

Nothing will top Le Bernardin for seafood in the City, but this was the next level down, on a par with Marea. I had the octopus appetizer with a zesty, delicious romesco. Main course was a scrumptious Nova Scotia halibut with lemon gnocchi, fava beans, and kale chimichurri. The space is modern and cozy, but nothing in the decor will compete with the plate.

The test would be to go back solo and see how they react to my arrival sans Chica.  Maybe they'd be like 'he's back! He's back!'

The dish I thought about was the Sea bass, but I am soooo asparagus out, I didn't want that anymore! Thank God for a special. Red snapper filet seared with fingerling potatoes , and calamari was the special that brought music to my ears. I'm not a huge fan of calamari, but hearing snapper had me sold. We were seated right away, had some bread and drank a lil wine as we waited. Our food came out and although plated nicely, I was thinking flat filet.

4.0,4/28/2018,"I'm a bit conflicted between a 3.5 and a 4 star. The conflict is that for the price the food and the complexity of flavors did not seem to meet the standard that I expect from a place like this. Usually when I decide to splurge and go to a place that is more expensive their presentation and the creativity and artistry of putting together an ansemble of a dish impresses me. The presentation usually is aesthetically pleasing with every dish and the flavors surprise me in the combinations and type. However, maybe I just didn't order the right things and there are poasibly dishes like that on the menu that I just didn't get a chance to try. Why I ended up with the 4, is that the amount of food for the price was not that bad, and the service was great. The steak, although about $60, was humongous and could feed two people easily. The rack of lamb was not as huge but very filling. The brocolli was not great, it didn't seem to complement the lamb very well. I thought it was too heavy for such a heavy meat. I like how middle eastern restaurants complement lamb with light salads like tabouli.  The free checkin offer of creme brulee for the table ""sweetened"" the deal. The creme brulee was lovely. Great presentation with the strawberry pieces and a leaf on top. Also, it was well made, with a good crispy top that really crunched under the weight of the fork or spoon. It made the end of the meal quite enjoyable. Unfortunately the order of keylime pie did not impress as much, but I am a bit biased against pies. It was well presented and ornate with pieces of pear and creme on top, but the pie itself tasted much like most keylime pies and nothing that special. The complimentary bread and cremes that came with the bread were pretty good. The service was pretty amazing.

It was burnt and I'm guessing it's because he asked me if I wanted it well done or rare, didn't know that was a thing for fish.

5.0,3/25/2018,"Had a wonderful birthday dinner here on Saturday. The lighting was dim and romantic, great place for a date. The reservation was for 5 PM and shortly after the place filled up rather quickly so a reservation is highly suggested. The food was delicious, fresh and just enough seasoning. They serve bread and crackers with 3 delicious spreads as a starter. We had the salmon which was juicy with a tasty crispy top. It came with a delicious black rice and tasty sauce. Presentation was beautiful. The lobster Mac and cheese is a must have. It was creamy with big lumps of lobster. The cream spinach was also delicious. Our cocktail the love potion was smooth and delicious. Our server Ari was so pleasant and very attentive and made sure our birthday girl was enjoying her meal and cocktails. The manager also came by our table to ask us how everything was. This place is on the pricey side but worth it as everything was extremely delicious and fresh. The dessert creme brûlée and molten chocolate cake was also delicious. If you check in on Yelp you receive a complimentary creme brûlée. We truly enjoyed our experience and will definitely visit again. FYI they also have a beautiful fire place so when making reservations request in advance.",0,0,1,Holly C.,"Bronx, New York, NY",0,51,130
5.0,3/23/2018,"If this isn't a 5-star restaurant, I don't know what is. Top notch service, food, everything was exquisite. We were able to get a last minute reservation about 2 hours before we went, which was so nice. The hostess quickly got us seated and we were right in the back of the restaurant near the fireplace (very cozy, highly recommend requesting it if it's cold night). We didn't order appetizers but we did get the bread that came with our service, which was absolutely delicious and so warm. It came with three kinds of dipping sauces, a balsamic and olive oil mix, butter, and some sort of garlic cream cheese. Lovely, all of it. For entrees a lot of us ordered the surf and turf, which I highly recommend, for it's both a good price, and exceptionally tasty. It included 12. oz Filet Mignon, 2 oz. Lobster, 2 oz. Shrimp, and 1 oz. King Crab in a red wine sauce. The meat was cooked to perfection and the seafood was divine. I had the créme brûlée for dessert and I can honestly say it was the best créme brûlée I've ever had. No curdling, just beautiful custard. Overall a very wonderful fine dining experience, and we will be back for more. The only thing I have to say negatively is the bathroom was dirty for such a fine restaurant. Other than that, this is one of my new NY favorites.",0,0,1,Sadie M.,"Provo, UT",540,108,152
3.0,3/22/2018,"I was looking for seafood restaurant in midtown Manhattan and The Sea Fire Grill was on the list.

Our orders are Roasted nova scotia halibutRoasted Mediterranean branzinoSeafood special (seafood platter with lobster)However, I didn't either get a big WOW from presentation of food or taste from food considering their price, what they offer a reall standard of seafood restaurant but seafood is very fresh for sure.",1,0,0,Amy L.,"Exton, PA",6,147,1719
4.0,3/19/2018,"Had a reservation for a romantic dinner, 6pm Friday. Arrived at 5:45 and half the tables were empty (it was a stormy, snowy night). By 7pm, the place filled up to the brim, so make a reservation to be on the safe side for a late night dinner.The ambiance is upscale and the space gets surprisingly loud as it fills up. Dimmed lighting. A fireplace at the back of the room. Relaxing.The service was very attentive, our waiter checked in on us several times and wasn't too overbearing, seeing that we didn't require much attention.The food was delicious but be prepared to pay a pretty penny. Complementary bread basket with butter, fish spread, and extra virgin olive oil--a delicious way to start your meal.Scallops with Celery Root Purée / Caviar Beurre Blanc ($23). The highlight of our meal. The puree and beurre blanc were out of this world magnificent--seriously, mindblowing. My bf and I licked our plates clean because it was possibly the best sauce & puree combination we've ever had! We could've ate it with a spoon, just as a separate meal itself, that's how good it was. Scallops were perfectly cooked--melted in the mouth. The only complaint was that they were tiny and of assorted sizes. Looked sloppy and off-putting, as if the chef messed up cutting the scallops and just decided to throw three different sized fragments of one scallop on a plate. Need to work on proper serving, which this incredible dish deserves.Halibut with Lemon Gnocchi / Fava Beans / Kale Chimichurri / Beurre Blanc. Never saw a paring of fish and gnocchi before. Wasn't a fan--both elements were dry. The fish wasn't tender or particularly tasty--needed proper seasoning. The gnocchi were utterly bland. Fava beans were tender. The chimichurri sauce and beurre blanc gave this dish life. When drowning all the ingredients in the sauce, you can taste some flavor, but otherwise, an underwhelming disappointment for $45.Use the Yelp app to check in and get a complementary Crème Brule. So delicate and tasty! Not too sweet, perfect to conclude a sumptuous meal.Overall, recommend this place to anyone looking for an upscale dinning treat.",1,0,0,Kseniya K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",223,113,526

But if you're looking for a great meal and you don't  mind opening your wallet, make reservations for this gem of a restaurant.I suggest making reservations as we left around 8 PM the place was full. They fill up rather quickly so I recommend giving them advance notice. We were lucky and I was able to get a 6:30 reservation at 6 o'clock by using the OpenTable app.It isn't all seafood, as my husband enjoyed fillet that was so thick and so big he couldn't finish it. That is saying a lot considering he finishes most steaks that he orders.  The add on caviar for $25 for the designated dishes is completely worth it.  I had the halibut which was perfectly cooked and we shared a side of asparagus.  We started with six oysters which they offer by the each so you don't have to bother with deciding between 6 or 12.  It was more than enough food as you also get a bread basket to enjoy with fish spread, butter, and olive oil.Our water glasses never got empty, as there were several servers circling around the tables just to ensure that your glass was always kept full.  Circling not in an intrusive way but in an attentive way.Yelp did us a favor here,  because when I checked in, there was a notification that we could get free dessert which was crème brûlée.  It was the best we'd ever had.I must mention our server was fantastic. His name was Arben.  I requested his advice on which dish to order and he did not steer me wrong.  This is definitely an adult only experience as they take their time and make sure that you're enjoying your dining opportunity.  So book a babysitter, grab your favorite people, and enjoy the atmosphere, the food and the service.",3,1,1,Cherie C.,"Spring Hill, FL",74,76,224

This place is so disgustingly nasty you can not imagine, on a trip to New York with my family wanted to go have a nice family dinner and we saw this place come up on Yelp and it wasn't too far and the place looked very nice the food looked great seemed like a nice quality restaurant, we walked in were greeted poorly the hosts where being given a lecture, not something you want to do in front of customers, had to hear a rant, anyways we were escorted to our tables, right as we had walked in we all smelt a very strange smell as we were walking to our table we noticed the smell getting stronger and stronger and even more disgusting, the only way I could try to describe this smell is think of a dirty porta-potty that's been in the sun for 3 months that's the most accurate way I can think of trying to describe the stench in there. I've never smelt a smell quite like this we were gaging from the smell, the waiter came near to hand us our menus we simply asked what this smell was and if it always smells like this and we got yelled at the man said something along the lines of you're crazy I've worked here 5 years no one has ever complained about a smell it smells fine here there's no smell (maybe he had shit himself, who knows) and he walked away, wow disgusting both the atmosphere and the workers so disgusting and rude, if you want to receive the poorest of customer service than this is the place to go.

The reviews were very positive so I decided to choose Fire Grill. Unfortunately our evening was absolutely spoiled with discussing food and wine... I am still so ashamed about my choice. We have ordered roasted scallops on celery pure for appetizer. The pure didn't have any flavor, it tasted like nothing. For the main course we got wild striped bass and yellowfin tuna. The both dishes have been served in deep plates (usually perfectly ravioli fits in), it was very uncomfortable to cut fish and eat from those plates. The mushrooms and Brussels sprouts (comes with bass) was not eatable at all. I was having heartburn all evening long after two bites. Bok Choi came with tuna and it was undercooked. Both fishes didn't have any flavors! We tried our food but didn't eat it. We have had two glasses of white wine which were warm and didn't taste well. We have had very bad experience, spend around 180$ (with tips) and left the place hungry.... If you truly appreciate good, quality and tasty food don't waste your time and money!

4.0,1/1/2018,"***LONG-Came here on 12/20/17 as a group of 8 (child included). We were staying at the Lexington, literally a 3 min walk, so it seemed only right to find somewhere nearby to eat after a 5 hour drive from NH. My brother made reservations for 8:30pm and I'm glad he did because this place was packed and we still ended up waiting about 10 minutes or so for our table to be ready. We were seated in a separate dining area and to our surprise there was another table already occupied by a large group. This worked out because 1) they weren't too loud and 2) I'll explain more later. Prices are definitely $$$$. I went with the salmon and eggplant(?) and my husband ordered the herb chicken. They asked me how I wanted my salmon cooked! I almost died because I didn't understand haha, but seriously how cool is that?! So get this, my daughter is 3 years old and the menu didn't necessarily cater to her appetite. That's fine because we were prepared and fed her beforehand. Our waiter was kind enough to give her a plate of desserts that were leftover and untouched from a platter of mini pastries ordered by our neighboring table I mentioned about earlier. Seriously, what a guy! My daughter was so happy and so was I because she was able to enjoy something while the rest of us were eating our meals. On top of that, after we finished our meals (which were great), they brought out our free creme brûlées (which you get if you check in on yelp)! They weren't small like I was expecting either considering it was free, these were decent sized portions that we were all able to share with at least one other person. To end the night, they even have us the rest of the mini pastries from that I mentioned earlier. Great service!***my only complaint is that they continuously topped our glasses off with water/sparkling water. At the end of the night, our eyes almost popped out from seeing the bill. Not because the price of food, but instead the water as it was $8 a bottle and they charged us for at least 7 without telling us that water isn't free?

The bartenders were super on point.  In general the service was great, even on Christmas day.The food was crazy good, my lamb was perfect, as was my son's filet mignon, and my wife's fish, the bronzino, apparently melted in her mouth. All of us loved the truffle mashed potatoes. Oysters were fresh and well presented. Desserts were all good, the creme Brule, and key lime selection particularly nice.Our waiter, Jaime, was sooooo great with my family, very attentive and respectful to the kids, etc. Just 100% on point.

5.0,12/27/2017,"We ate at the Sea Fire last night and it was fantastic. We started with amazing appetizers.  The calamari was outstanding-probably one of the best grilled calamari I've ever eaten.  The crab cake was amazing too and I'm pretty fussy when it comes to crab cakes.  As for entrees, we shared the tuna and halibut and everything was perfectly cooked and nicely presented.  I was a bit full by the time our desserts arrived but they were all delicious.  The creme brulee was a home run!The service was top flight and what you'd expect from an expensive restaurant.  Milton was very attentive and the manager Scott was very pleasant as well.  We were even visited by the head chef Jesus who was delightful.  After eating at 2 other notable spots in Manhattan, I'd have to say that The Sea Fire Grill was the best of the three.  I highly recommend this place if you're a fish lover.  Happy New Year!",0,1,0,Renee S.,"Wilmington, NC",0,23,0
4.0,12/27/2017,"Our waiter Jaime made up for the complete lack of ambiance offered in the ""wine cellar"" room.  If making Christmas reservations, insist that you are either seated in the main dining room or that you will have him as your waiter.  Note to management ... if you are going to seat people in the side room for Christmas, please do something to make it warm and inviting ... flowers, decorations, candles, anything to make it feel more like the holiday that it is.   The positive to being seated there was that it was quiet, so it was easy to have a nice conversation, but it was just white.  White walls, white table cloths, and from memory, no candles ... almost like it was the overflow room despite me having made reservations well (more than a month) in advance.One more complaint.  The bread basket was a bit of a joke.  Almost like they ran out of the good stuff, so grabbed sliced bread and flat bread crackers from whatever store was open on Christmas day.  It wasn't even warm.  The offset was the whitefish spread, which could have been spread on a saltine cracker and still been impressive.OK, enough complaining because all of the above was more than compensated for by the fact that Jaime (our waiter) was spectacular.  He made it a memorable Christmas and stood in stark contrast to the room.  Warm, kind, and inviting. Moreover, the food (outside of the bread) was excellent.  Everyone enjoyed what they ordered, and no two people orderd the same thing, which says a lot.  If you go, order a side of the Lobster Mac and Cheese.  It was so good, it should be illegal.",0,0,0,A M.,"Wellesley, MA",0,11,0

The seafood is to die for. Scallops were tender and cooked to perfection. The accompany sauce matched well with the scallops.Wife had the surf and turf. Truthfully, I wouldn't order meat here. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad but it wasn't compared to a top end steakhouse (in my opinion). The seafood for the ""surf"" was perfectly prepared. I could have ate more of it. We had Brussels for a side. Loved them. They are rich in flavor and cooked slightly crispy. I could have ate two orders.Service is beyond impeccable. Ambiance is perforce for us- quiet and romantic.

The restaurant is dark and classy; we came in jeans and felt a tad under dressed. The bread, I have to start off, was excellent. We had calamari and crab cakes. I didn't expect the calamari to be grilled instead of fried (it was my first time having it this way) so that was a little tough, but I thought the crab cakes were pretty good. Normally I don't like seafood, and so there are a few steak and one chicken option. However, I was curious about the squid ink pasta and decided to try it. As mentioned above, I was pleasantly surprised! It tasted pretty much like normal pasta just with a lobster sauce. I split half with my coworker and it was plenty of food.

(Beson) He was kind and you could tell a hard worker.  He tried to make our 2 hour meal pleasant while we waited a LONG time for our food. Due to the prices, a friend and I split the surf and turf.  The food was good, but what was funny was, while it was so nice they split the meal for us, they literally cut a shrimp in half.  I would've been happy to pay for a shrimp   had I known.  The rest was 2 inches of lobster each and 2 inches of crab and a steak. We had the lobster bisque.  It was good, but I wouldn't have it again, especially for the price. The dessert was the BEST part of the meal. The molten cake was dark chocolate.  And the creme brûlée was really good. I expect high prices in New York City. However, this was outlandish in my opinion.  $70 for the surf and turf and $13 for the soup.  Dessert was around the same price. Other entrees ranged from $30-40.  If I'm going to pay those prices, it needs to be amazing, for me, it just wasn't. There are a lot of choices in NYC.

The seafood is as fresh as it gets and they nailed every dish. They fish of the day was sea bass served whole fish  - they cut the fillet at the table. The sauce they put on was a masterpiece; it really enhanced the dish. Even the asparagus was  on point. The 3 pound lobster was the best I have had in Manhattan, nothing against Benjamin Steakhouse, but the flavor of the lobster was sweeter. And the shelled for me at the table. The truffle oil they use on calamari sets it apart from any other Calamari dish I have had; highly recommend it. Its cooked to tender perfection.

3.0,11/4/2017,"The Sea Fire Grill:We chose this spot for a special occasion dinner. Thinking that this spot will satisfy both criteria of Seafood & Steak for the gentlemen and ladies. Dropped by a tad early but was not seated as hostess stated that all party must be there before we can get our seats. We were told to sit at the bar as we wait for our last guest. We were guided to our seats, and was told that he reserved the best table for us. Our table was all the way in the back. I feel like our table will get more attention if we were to sit in the middle section but don't tell us that this is the best table in the house. I guess since the restaurant was packed we waited longer than usual to get our waiter's attention. Complimentary bread is always a plus. It came out warm, fluffy and crisp. We ordered the: Lobster Bisque: $17, not enough meat in the soup, hence soup lose the flavor. Oyster Rockefeller: $21 This taste ok but maybe bits of bacon will add some sparks to each oyster. I rather eat raw oyster with some lemon juice on top. Porterhouse for Two: $110 We asked for steakhouse sauce but what came out was a small sauce dish of cream mix. Maybe that is their home made sauce? but i expect steak sauce to be brown or orange in color. I will pass on the sauce. The steak tasted okay on both side. No wow factor to it. Bone in Ribeye: $59, much more flavor in this steak. Kind of melt in your mouth feeling. Halibut: $45, Salmon: $39, both fish were juicy and flavorful. Lobster Mac & Cheese: $17 again but enough meats in the dish but this was very cheesy and creamy. Cream of Spinach: $12, too salty. We weren't really serve the best to our attention, probably because of the amount of people dining on that day. Service can be better.",9,1,1,Carmen L.,"New York, NY",8,235,2458

To start we had a glass of rosé each, followed by the crab cake. I had the squid ink pasta with lobster she, the branzino. Everything was cooked well, flavors worked well, and was very filling. I thought the pasta was on the heavy side esp to have as a entree. I suggest sharing this with a party of 3-4 just so everyone can try it and move on to something lighter.

5.0,8/16/2017,"I didn't have any plans on having fine dining during my stay in NYC. But my mom had requested this and I'm sooo glad she did. Got here early for a 6PM Saturday night reservation. The place was rather vacant but started filling up at the 6:30 mark. Our server was Jamie and he was fun and attentive. The place is rather dark but enough light to still enjoy your food.My mom and I both got the surf and turf and wow, it was fantastic. The filet mignon was so tender and melted right in my mouth. It comes with small portions of prawn, lobster, and king crab. Although the portions were small, each of the seafood was so juicy and flavorful. I had to ration the seafood throughout the meal since the filet mignon was 9oz of awesome beefiness. My boyfriend had the New York strip (I guess it's only right given where we were) and he said that this was the best steak he's had. That's saying a lot as we've visited quite a few high-end steak houses here in the Bay Area. We also had the lobster mac and cheese. Boy, they are generous with the lobster. It's actually a pretty big portion for a side and both my mom and I plus my boyfriend were having a hard time finishing it with the rest of our order.Can't forget to get the free chocolate molten cake if you check in! Our whole table thought we wouldn't touch it because we were extremely full, but we devoured it in about a minute or so. It was the right amount of sweetness as I'm assuming they used dark chocolate for the cake. The touch of the vanilla bean ice cream complimented the running chocolate syrup. I would definitely go back! The quality of the food and dining experience was amazing.

The dining area was empty so the host asked us if we would like to sit at the bar area .. maybe cause I had on a tee shirt and shorts? Tip - dress appropriately. Don't sit at the bar .. not at these prices .. you will miss out on the dining experience which is what u are paying for. We asked for a table and were seated at a table for 2. We asked for a table where we could sit next to each other so they let us pick the best table in the place .. table for four on the couch .. so accommodating plus they took our photo. Their service is best in class .. food presentation is spectacular and delicious and great ambience. Love the way everyone thanks you for coming.

2.0,7/12/2017,"I was soooo ready to love this place - I'd heard wonderful things, read the great Yelp reviews, even made reservations two months in advance for an anniversary dinner with my husband. However, I can't honestly recommend going here after our sub-par experience. Let's start with the positive things! The place is very nice looking, and the staff was wonderful. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and very courteous. We felt ""taken care of"", which obviously should be the standard for this nice of a restaurant. 5/5 stars. We both ordered wedge salads and both also ordered the 12 oz. filet mignon - which, I know - this is a seafood place - and I can practically hear you all rolling your eyes at me, but my husband doesn't like seafood and once I got there I didn't see anything that grabbed my attention. So, I skipped the fish and went straight for what should be an incredibly juicy cut of meat. It wasn't. At all. We ordered them medium, and they came out on the more well side of medium-well, and were totally dry. I joked that it could use some A-1 sauce. It was THAT mediocre. For a $50+ steak, I just expected way, way better. And as far as the wedge salads went, they were also mediocre, watery, and basically the type of wedge I guess you could get anywhere. 1/5 stars.We were going to end it there, but decided to try and end our dinner on a better note, so we ordered dessert - a NY Cheesecake and a crème brulee. They were good! But I'm not really sure they were anything better than just good, because at that point most anything would've been better than our entrees. The desserts really didn't anything that would make it better or different from another restaurant. 3/5 stars. My husband joked that the free bread might've been the best part of the whole meal. So.I really don't want to totally bash on this place, because I'm sure another kind of experience there could be truly incredible (especially if they ordered seafood like I probably should've). However, I don't think it's too crazy to expect a place like this to be able to serve quality food along with their seafood.

Although the bone in ribeye, which I got, could have used some dressing around the plate. It kind of looked like they just put a slab of meat on the dish. But, it was cooked to perfection. When I told the waiter I wanted medium with a little pink, it came out like so. As for service, our waiter, Jaime, was outstanding.

2.0,7/4/2017,"No No No.  I was eagerly looking forward to fresh seafood.  I checked yelp - hmm 4.5 stars, over 600 reviews.  What could go wrong?  Let's start with the appetizer.  Hubby had lobster bisque - he said it was decent with nice chunks of lobster.  I had the gazpacho, my favorite summer starter.  It was probably the worst gazpacho I've ever had.  It tasted like a very creamy tomato soup in which somebody had been rather heavy handed with the olive oil so that was the overwhelming flavor.  Main courses were Blackened Montauk Swordfish (Hubby) and Wild Striped Bass.  Whenever he sees swordfish on the menu, he orders it and I'm the same with bass.  My wild bass was supposed to be glazed with soy sauce - more like drowned.  I'm always suspicious when I get my fresh fish drowned in sauce - I think it means they are trying to mask the fact that it's not that fresh and this was absolutely the case. Two bites confirmed to me that it definitely was not fresh.  I ate  few of the accompanying brussels sprouts which were also swimming in the soy glaze but I left most of the food on the plate.  Hubby commented that his swordfish was over seasoned and also left most of his food.I guess with it being July 4th, they must have had the back up chef on duty.  However we didn't pay back up prices.  I was surprised nobody asked why we didn't eat our food....  We didn't complain, we'll just never return.  I gave the place two stars because the bread was good and hubby liked his lobster bisque.",1,0,0,Bo D.,"New York, NY",12,43,61

The staff did not come off as other high star restaurants; they were friendly and interactive which is a relief to see in these high end locations. The lobster mac and cheese was out of this world. The meat was straight from the shell and was VERY generous in its portion. The brussel sprouts were unlike anything I've ever tasted. It surprises your palette with hints of Asian cuisine. We did switch servers upon receiving our main course, however both were equally as accommodating and friendly. Our second server, Milot anticipated our Yelp free molten cake which was both surprising and refreshing, just as the cake was. We were advised that this restaurant was overpriced but had very good food. Honestly if your willing to splurge for vacation to eat some of the best food you've had in maybe your lifetime it is well worth it.

They asked if they wanted to see the dessert menu and they said no, so they just didn't bring anything out. I was just hoping after calling they would surprise them anyway to end the moment nicely!

2.0,5/27/2017,i ordered the halibut.  i've been to a few nice restaurants so i have a few expectations.  the fish was unseasoned completely.  the gnocchi was way overcooked to the extend that they tasted like chewy globs of dough. i had to salt the dish which made it much better - but for $45 dollars i don't think i should have to do that.  Ambiance is great but you can tell the neighborhood has turned on the place because it is empty on Saturday night.  besides the good ratings i would try someplace a less expensive - it might be better,0,0,0,Shital S.,"New York, NY",5,18,3

2.0,5/13/2017,"This place was so disappointing. It was my Birthday, which they knew.  For my present? They sat us nearly 1/2 hour after our reservation. The host said he would ""make it up to us"" but didn't. They made us pay for desert! They finally sat us at a cramped table for two right by one of the staff stations. The waiter was attentive and helpful. The food was, for the most part, high quality, but needed to be scrumptious given the prices. My companion had the Mahi special and liked it, but won't be writing home about it.  I had the surf and turf. The surf was chewy and the turf was a nice cut of Filet that was well-prepared if a tad undercooked. The lobster bisque was delightful. If you must go here, get that. The smoked fish plate appetizer was tasty but I wouldn't get it again. We enjoyed a nice selection of wines by the glass that were reasonably priced. The Birthday chocolate cake they made us pay for was heavenly.  The bill was eye-gouging. As we walked out, the host realized  he hadn't taken care of us. He offered me a Limonchello. Really?

4.0,5/4/2017,"I don't like steakhouses. I don't like the reflexive emphasis on beef, or the paucity of ways to prepare a steak. To my amateur palate, steakhouse A cannot be distinguished from steakhouse B. Sea Fire Grill is a steakhouse for those who, like me, crave seafood and appreciate the countless methods of preparing and serving it. It has an upscale steakhouse feel, starting with a vibrant bar scene at the entrance for the well dressed, mixed drink set - not a college crowd, and not a '2 dollar pitcher' place. You will feel out of place in sneakers and jeans. The maitre d' or an attendant greets you in a formal but cordial manner and a well dressed staff member escorts you to your table. Service is prompt, friendly, and efficient and very informative as to daily specials and off the menu items. Depending in where you sit, it could be  a bit crampedTo start, there is an extensive wine list, and the menu offers a variety of appetizers and salads (e.g., ceviche, crab, shrimp, chowders, beet salad). All the food is cooked perfectly, and there are a variety of flavors available, ranging from the simple (olive oil, lemon and capers) to the complex (coconut, lime). The entrees include most any fish you could want, like sea bass, swordfish, and branzino. Our table ordered ceviche, crab cakes, the cod special, and a tuna with glazed soy. A side dish of roasted Brussels sprouts was amazingly flavorful. The menu does have non-seafood items (lamb, chicken, beef) but - wait for it - ""who orders steak in a seafood restaurant?""  The entrees are not the large portions of food you might find in a family style Italian restaurant so you will have room for desert (unless you fill up on the bread or side dishes). I have included two photographs of two of our entrees. All in all, this is a very solid seafood restaurant with a steakhouse ambience. The Greek restaurant across the street, Avra, also offers very good seafood but the difference is that Avra's flavor profile is consistently Mediterranean (lemon, olive oil); the flavor profiles at Sea Fire Grill include Mediterranean, but also include Asian, Caribbean, and South American.",0,0,0,Arthur X.,"Darien, CT",0,22,22

5.0,4/15/2017,"Delayed flight, missed dinner plans with friends, tired and hungry. Yelped seafood near the Lexington.  Right around the corner one minute walk, this place.  Vibe great, bar area excellent for rapid turnover and full menu dining.  Ben from Albania, server/ magician nails the order, whisks us to a better spot and delivers fine service. Even showed us a meme with the meaning of life -- only to find out from my husband -- meme subject died in a motorcycle accident in San Diego from where we just came ... bringing real meaning to the message. Enjoyed a great dinner for the $$$ value, when one does not drink anymore, great food is affordable.  But for those who do, the bar looked capable of culpability.Ok, we went back the very next night...It was such a short shopping trip to stock up on staples, we came back knowing we would be predictably pleased.We sat in the dining room this time and were provided fine service and more great conversation by Edmond and a team.  As a business person who puts on events and focuses on creating experiences to make commerce happen, this is what I observed;If you are trying to make the most of that expense account, solo or as a group -- The Sea Fire Grill is also the perfect unassuming business hub.  The way the dining room is partitioned, yet spacious feeling, they can accommodate any size group and achieve inclusiveness.With culinary delights as a given, I would take it a step further and note the personalities of your guests to match the mood you want to create.  For example, If you need your guests entertained and merry, ask for someone like Ben, built in ice breaker.  If your goal is purposeful conversation and  set topics to cover during the course of a meal, ask for someone like Edmond and his team to ensure polite and efficient service that will not distract from your agenda.Any number of restaurants can lay claim to these service expectations, but did you actually have an experience that defined a moment in time?The Sea Fire Grill sets the stage for great food, conversation and collaboration at a great value, it's the people -- patrons and staff -- who made the difference and gave us a moment in time.",0,0,0,Duchess C.,"Cardiff, CA",24,22,71

4.0,4/3/2017,"We celebrated one of our friends' birthday here last year, on 11/13/2016. Even though I didn't get a chance to write a review, but it was one of the most phenomenal dinner we've ever experienced. We often take turns going to different steakhouses for each of our birthdays, and finally had a chance to come across the greatest steakhouse with the freshest seafood, which the birthday girl loved! Greatest services we've ever experienced with our waiter, Bes. Loved their foods, loved their ambiance, loved their plating and their utensils, and most importantly, we loved Bes' service. He kept the night very entertaining and made it one of the most memorable birthdays we've ever celebrated. IT WAS A NIGHT, TO REMEMBER.The same group of friends brought me back here for a surprise birthday dinner this year, 4/2/2017. Our waiter was not as experienced as Bes. We all missed him last night. I believe his name was Arber, which none of us had caught his name until the check came at the end of the night. All of us had trouble understanding him while speaking to us, perhaps he should have talked a bit slower? And it definitely does not look good if your waiter pulls out his cheat sheet to read out that night's specials. But let's talk about the foods we ordered last night: We had loved their fish paste on their breads ever since our first visit. However, the bread was not as hot and as fresh this time around. Anyways, to start off, we had two west coastal oysters each person (or at least that was what we thought we had). We also shared a bottle of wine. Some had rack of lambs, some had the rib-eye, one of the girl's had a surf and turf, and I had the special fish which was very tasty. I am guessing you can't go wrong with their seafood or meats. We also shared a lobster mac and cheese, and their brussels sprouts was very well cooked and super delicious! Food was great! Our table was in the back corner, on the right side of the restaurant when you walk in, and it is right by where the staffs place their water pitchers and by the wine cellar. Our water was not refilled, even after we asked a random staff politely, and instead of filling our cups, he took the pitcher of water, and walked to the table next to ours, then to the next table, and then to the next. At the end, he placed the pitcher of water back to where he found it (by our table), and never stepped closer to us. We all watched him, and felt humiliated. Was it because we didn't order more than one appetizer? Was it because the ladies weren't wearing any dresses like other tables did? Or were we not good looking enough? We also asked one of the staffs nicely to remove our bread because it was taking up too much space and it was hard to get the sides for some others. He took away the bread, but he somehow forgot about BOTH plates of the olive oil, fish paste (all gone by the way because we still love it so much) and butter (not a bit left).Lastly, we had ordered a creme brule, a pecan pie, and a molted chocolate cake. The  molted chocolate cake is free if you check in with Yelp. The manager, Marie, has the friendliest smile. She smiled to me as I watched her walking to the wine cellar picking out wines. She came to the table shortly after we finished up with our desserts, and offered us complimentary birthday shots. I didn't think she did that because one of my friends had already posted a quick comment on Yelp during dinner, complaining about the water not being refilled. Nevertheless, that was very generous of her. Thank you again, Marie. Just when the dinner was lighten up after the shots (lol), according to the bill, we realized we had two kinds of oysters. Even so, we didn't even get a chance to notice or to taste the difference, I mean, only one of us thought the oysters tasted differently. We only ordered two oysters per person, and to all we know, they were all supposed to be the same. Never did it occur to us that there were two kinds of west coastal oysters, I don't think everyone got to try the different ones since we were not notified. We were going to bring it up to Marie's attention, but we didn't find the strengths to do so, we were at a point where we sort of gave up on the experience with Arber, compared the times we had with Bes. We ended our dinner by asking Marie to take a group picture of us by the bar, and she voluntarily took one without the flash and one with the flash, which was very thoughtful of her. You can say she was the one who lightened up our dinner. Once again, thank you, Marie. Overall, great foods, great manager, but two very different experience within the short 6 months. I hope to bring my family here in the future and might have to re-think it.P.S. The friends said Marie told us that she recognized us from our last birthday celebration and it was our first time dining in the restaurant, which was pretty impressive. However, I am still going to have to re-think our next visits.",0,0,0,Lilian S.,"Brooklyn, NY",94,43,78

Upon entering the restaurant, the hostess kindly greeted us and showed us to where our table was, which was in the private room. That was the only thing that was nice about this place, unfortunately.Our waiter, whose name I did not get but he had a French accent, was disrespectful from the very beginning. My brother had ordered a soda and he still had not received it when the main courses were being given out. By this time, it had been at least 20min since he had asked for it. As an older sister, I politely asked our waiter where the soda was, just to make sure it was still coming and he did not forget it. With an attitude and frustration in his voice, his response was ""I know. It's coming. I'm giving out the food first so that it does not get cold. What do you want me to do? Get the soda first, then give out the food?"" Uhhh... YES! Someone should not have to wait more than 20min for a soda. He then proceeded to the other side of the table and continued to yell at me about the soda. His actions were completely inappropriate towards a paying customer. After my aunt and uncle voiced their opinions, the manager got involved and the waiter's attitude changed. You can tell he was nervous because we were a large group which means a potential large tip. However, the damage was done and this is something that I will not forget. Trust me, everyone I know will hear about my experience here. Good job Seafire Grill, I will not be returning to this restaurant.UPDATE: The waiter gave us a bottle of limoncello on the house. I don't drink, so a free bottle of alcohol was not for my enjoyment.

Entrees were just good: dorade, branzino, tuna. Fish was well cooked but seasoning and flavor were just ok.Sides were most meh: brussel sprouts were excellent! Lobster mac/cheese was good but not sure we had much if any lobster in there. Truffle mushrooms and Yukon potatoes were both very underwhelming and not much to them. I'm not sure I've ever though anything with truffle oil was underwhelming but the mushrooms just tasted completely unseasoned.Service was very attentive all night and they've got a pretty nice whiskey selection. All in all, at around $150 per person after drinks, I want spectacular and we just got pretty good.

1.0,3/23/2017,Our hotel recommended this restaurant to us.  We had been at the hospital all day bc of a family member's surgery. We just wanted to eat and relax a little. We had a terrible experience here and would NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone.  We waited even though we made reservations and we were told by our waiter we could order from both the lunch and dinner  menus but when the bill came it was totally not true. One person in our party just wanted a salad with some seared  tuna. When the bill came we were charged $45 for a full tuna dinner and charged another $18 for an ala carte salad even though we were told we could order from both menus including the lobster roll sandwich someone in our party asked about The $55 steak was one of the worst steaks ever- it came with several cuts in it - all the juice had run  out and the person who had it said it was dry and the quality of the meat was not great. I guess  that's why you should only order steak from a great steakhouse - we sent the leftovers home and the dog enjoyed the treat!  When the bill came we asked about the charges  because as I said our waiter said we could order from both menus.  The manager came over and he was condescending and said you have to order from the dinner menu here (so that would be $63 for the salad which was literally a handful of mixed greens with 2 small pieces of tuna - the  waiter took the rest of the full  tuna dinner back to kitchen and never said anything about the fact he ordered and we would be charged for the dinner ) I explained to the manager that the waiter said we could order from both and he said that it was a misunderstanding. He agreed to adjust the price but he was not nice about it all.  On top of it they turned the air conditioner on and several tables in our section of the restaurant complained . We were looking for lighter meals bc it was late and we had spent 8 hours waiting for our Dad to come out of surgery. We told the hotel about the experience and they apologized for sending us there.  Of all our trips to NYC this was one of the worst restaurant experiences ever!!,2,2,0,Susan S.,"Liberty, NY",0,19,0

5.0,3/13/2017,"Restaurant - Seafire Grill Date - 3/11/17My husband and I had dinner at SFG to celebrate his birthday. I chose this restaurant because of its high rating and I have to say I was not disappointed. Prior to our visit I made reservations online which was easy enough to do. I also called to confirm and spoke with Anna who was very polite and helpful.  Very seamless reservation process. Once we arrived, we were half hour early but Anna (who confirmed my reservation) greeted us and arranged for us to be seated w/o waiting for the reservation time. That was nice of her. There is a coat and bag check which is extremely handy especially for the very cold nights when bundling up is a MUST. The restaurant was dimly lit which created a nice cosy atmosphere.  A romantic vibe. Good for a date night. The waitstaff was EXTREMELY ATTENTIVE. Jaimie and the entire staff in our section were super polite and constantly checked on us. Jaime gave us an overview of the ""specials"" as well as gave us suggestions of what's really tasty as this we our first time there. The bread was fresh and warm and water was refilled frequently. The food was delicious and the choices were phenomenal.  If you love seafood this is a great option for a nice dinner. My only issue -- the noise level. However this could simply be situational. There was a party of about 6 or 7 directly behind us and they were louder than most.  All other tables seemed considerate of other diners but because of close proximity of the tables colliding conversations may be hard to avoid.  In spite of the noise level, overall we enjoyed dinner and being out. I would definitely recommend SFG.",0,0,0,Tara G.,"Freeport, NY",0,2,0

3.0,3/2/2017,"Having lived in Boston for four years, I'm definitely spoiled with fresh and delicious Boston lobsters. I didn't realize how hard it was to find restaurants that serve whole lobsters in NYC until I found this one. This restaurant has a pretty good selection of seafood. I got a steamed two pound Maine lobster and creamed spinach. The lobster was good but definitely didn't compare to Boston lobsters. The creamed spinach also wasn't very memorable. But Besides the food, I have no complaints about the restaurant. It's conveniently located in midtown, near Grand Central Station. The service was friendly and attentive. Seating was comfortable - there's a bar near the entrance with a big TV and you'll find the dining area towards the back of the restaurant, which is more quiet and sports a relaxed yet classy and slightly romantic atmosphere.

Our server Arber was fantastic! He was very accommodating to my special dietary needs and did a great job of explaining the menu and making us laugh as well. For an appetizer, I got the Bibb salad and I can honestly say that I have NEVER enjoyed a salad so much in my life. The lettuce was like butter, and the salad had a sweetness to it (with candied walnuts, dried cranberries, and slightly sweet dressing) which I loved. Hubby got oysters, which he enjoyed as well. For our entrees we had the salmon and sea bass, and both of us devoured every bite. The salmon came with a delicious honey-mustard type sauce that was on the plate (not over the fish). I appreciate when a restaurant doesn't drown fish in sauce and instead lets you decide how much you want. For dessert, we shared the molten chocolate cake which you really can't go wrong with. This place is definitely pricy (was over $200 with tip), but perfect if you want a romantic night out with amazing food.

The lobster was delicious and the shrimp was fantastic. Perfect sized portions so I wasn't overstuffed and unable to move, but I was full and very satisfied. We had the asparagus as a side and it was the perfect portion to split between two people and I was so flavorful. Highly recommend. For dessert we had the chocolate molten cake with vanilla ice cream. This was the perfect way to end the meal. Nice size to share and it is sweet and rich. The restaurant is very nice.

1.0,1/16/2017,"I really can't put my finger on why the seafire grill has so many good reviews. Don't know if it was just the staff that day or what (or perhaps because it was friday the 13th and we were just really unlucky, if you believe in that kinda thing...), but we were treated so poorly our entire group left pretty upset.We went on 1/13/2017 Friday with a large group of 16 people for a friend's birthday. I had a bad feeling from the start when we were lead to the coatcheck. We had a couple of things we wanted to check in so it took a little longer, but the front manager was basically giving us the stank face the entire time and actually reached over us very rudely in order to hurry us along and reach for hangers for the couple after us. Moving on...I know large groups are hard to take care of but I got a sense of bad attitude from the waiters from the start. They were basically berating us with questions/orders, instead of asking nicely. If this were a casual restaurant, I'd probably be more whatevers about this, but this was a high-end fancy restaurant. How could the waiters not have been trained properly??? When he took orders, I communicated that I was ordering all sides for our side of the table and that everyone was ordering their own mains. I began giving my order, and he stops me by saying, ""No Nooo no, ARE YOU ORDERING APPETIZERS??"" I say, ""no, I want mashed potatoes and creamed spinach."" He repeats again, ""ARE. YOU. ORDERING. ANY. APPETIZERS???"" like I was a grade school student. I was so fed up I threw it right back, ""NO. I. AM. NOT."" So ridiculous!!! How hard is it to deduce that all I wanted to order were sides without having to badger me like that???The food was really mediocre at best. There are definitely better steakhouses out there that are actually worth the price (aka Mastros, wolfgangs, etc). I got the tuna orechiette, but I did manage to snag a piece of porterhouse from my friend - you could tell it definitely wasn't a medium rare like he had requested...Here's where the real drama begins. One of my other friends orders fish, but has a filet mignon served in front of him. He then asks the waiter to confirm what went wrong (basically he thought he ordered a surf and turf instead), and the waiter admits he heard the order incorrectly. OK, great no problem. Then the bill comes, and due to the confusion/our regular habit, we check the bill and realized we had been charged for an extra order of surf and turf (which was an extra $80~90+, with tax), the incorrect thing that they had served up incorrectly and took back. We flag down a staff member to get some help (who seems to be the front manager or maitre d, I couldn't really tell but he was in a grey suit all night), and after describing the situation, he responds with, ""UHM, WE ONLY CHARGE YOU FOR WHAT WE SERVE ONTO THE TABLE."" IN THE SNARKIEST ATTITUDE EVER. Basically, he was accusing us of lying...! WHAT. THE. HELL. The best option would be to say ""Oh I'm so sorry! Let us double check that for you."" In what restaurant is it OK to question the customers? Then the waiter comes over to try to explain the situation and actually made it worse by telling us that that front manager was just kidding around. Not so funny to us, mister. A few minutes later, I see that front manager pull the waiter aside to get the full story of what actually went down. I'm guessing the waiter actually told him yes they made a mistake, and yes it was their fault. I HOPE THAT WAS A GOOD LESSON FOR YOU AND YOUR STAFF. When we start to leave, they try to make ""nice"" conversation with us, where they proceed to ask a guy in our group about chinese new year...lol wtf he's korean and no, not all asians look the same. Will never visit this establishment ever again. If I could pick what gratuity to leave, I would have left 0 (except they of course mandated 20% automatically). Your staff should not be allowed to treat people with a condescending attitude!!!",24,5,4,Patricia C.,"Manhattan, NY",135,275,1463

We are a party of 7 so we open a bottle of white wine and ordered 4 appetizers to share to start with:Yellowfin tuna tartare, crab cake , salad w/ lobster meat, calamari ~~~ we all agreed 4 of them were delicious!  All of us ordered our own entrees, and 2 side dishes to share, we all ordered different types of fishes.  I had Branzino which the chef made it boneless so I had no worry of bone.  It tasted good, and not fishy or too dry at all.  My other friends liked their dishes as well.  We had desserts chocolate lavo cake and cream brûlée to share with because some of us are not fans sweetness.  I only tried the cream brûlée which it's just normal.  My friend said the chocolate labor cake was good which it's his favorite dessert. Overall, the service was nice and friendly during our entire dining time.

I was in town for a few nights celebrating my anniversary with my wife and I looked up a few places to dine at that I haven't experienced before. This restaurant made the list and I'm glad it did!Upon entering the restaurant I was promptly greeted and our jackets were checked in. We were seated on one of the sides by the wall and I'm glad that's where we ended up. They have tables lined up on each wall and two sets of tables for two in the middle. This is their way of getting more people seated but if you are one of the unlucky ones, you will be sitting right next to another couple. I recommend getting their prior to 7:30pm so you're not in that situation.  The service was good and I felt like we weren't rushed nor neglected. For our beverage we ordered a bottle of the 2013 Faust Cabernet Sauvignon which we have had several times before. We ordered 4 shrimps for shrimp cocktail, the crab cake appetizer and split a lobster bisque. All of which were very tasty. My wife ordered the halibut and I ordered the NY strip and Brussel sprouts.

3.0,12/17/2016,"Seafire Grill is the epitome of an old-school restaurant cateirng to the business crowd in Midtown Manhattan - very cozy, very pricey ($16 for a Chimay on tap is a bit nuts), and insanely crowded on weeknights later in the week. The front area is a bar, but given how many people are waiting to be seated, you don't really have much mobility until it clears out later on. The bartenders are also quite overwhelmed; I probably waited almost 10 minutes before I was able to get their attention to order a drink. That said, the folks who serviced us in the main dining room were very prompt in keeping water and wine glasses filled at all times, and the food came out in a timely fashion.Along with my overpriced Chimay, I did have a couple of the house cocktails, but nothing really stood out, and the martini-like drink I ordered (Gold Rush was the name, I think) wasn't something really agreed with me. As for the food, I was more impressed by the lobster bisque that I started out with; it had a very solid base of tomato and cream, with a decent amount of lobster meat giving it a dash of the sea without being too overbearing. However, the dry-aged filet that I had for my main was quite disappointing, as well the sides that came with it. You could tell that the meat itself had the delicious subtle complexities that aged meat has, but the steak itself was so, so dry - I honestly don't know the last time I ate a steak that wasn't overcooked (the meat was still chewy) but was devoid of any semblance of moisture. The brussel sprouts were okay, if a little overcooked, but the mashed potatoes were very plain and seemed to nearly resemble in texture the kind of potatoes you'd make with flakes from a box...a bit more salt and butter would have helped more. Dessert were a selection of mini-pastries and cakes; while the flavors were okay, they all came with the same kind of crust on the outside (i.e. basically only the filling changed).Seafire definitely has some potential, but perhaps it was because we were a large party - but it seemed like there were plenty of missed opportunities along the way.

3.0,11/11/2016,"I came here for a business dinner with a group of 12. The place was bustling when we came here on a Thursday Night. When you enter the restaurant - there is a bar area to relax while you wait for your seats and also a coat check section. That is a nice perk that you don't see at many restaurants. We had prearranged a prefixed menu that was 4 courses deep. It started off with a raw seafood tower that was just on point. The seafood was fresh and the best part was the lobster. Just so good. We moved onto a choice of appetizer. I don't remember much about it but from what i do - it wasn't anything special. We had a surf & turf  for the main course that was a pretty hearty size! Nevertheless, it wasn't mesmerizing. We ended with an tart on lemon sorbet and it wasn't good. I expect more in terms of their food as it is a fine dining restaurant. Service was on point & very attending.The place is super loud so really tough to hear and you will feel cramped in there. Lighting is very dim as I saw servers use their phones as lights. May be a sign for the restaurant to make it brighter if their own staff need lights? Too long don't want to read - Fancy restaurant with mediocre food!",2,0,1,Kevin H.,"Washington, DC",285,163,338

The lady who answered the call managed to give me a table eventually, which was not bad. We had seafood platter, lobster& crab cake, steak, grilled tuna, cold soup and some desserts.

2.0,10/13/2016,Came here for a business lunch and ordered a lobster roll. I have never seen such small lobster rolls; they were practically bite size. It came in one of those hot dog buns that you can get from any supermarket and there were so little lobster meat than they didn't even pop out of the bun. It was definitely not worth the $23 for the roll. Very disappointing.

Kitchen loves pretty food, but the food isn't pretty to eat. Service non-existent. Not even a stop by to say ""how is it?""  It wasn't good.  Mango sorbet was good, but why wouldn't be.  Should stay away from swordfish--always hard to do without being dry and this chef doesn't know the secret.  High price not worth it.

4.0,10/12/2016,"Great seafood place in Midtown East! Came here with a few co-workers after work. I started with the Spanish octopus, which was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Paired well with Romesco, potatoes and tomatoes on the side. Serving was more generous than I expected. For my entree, I went with the Halibut (our waiter recommended the Halibut, Bronzino, and Swordfish). I was very pleased with my choice. The Halibut was so tender and fresh - it practically melted in my mouth. The kale chimichurri was a perfect complement to the fish. Fish also came with fava beans and lemon gnocchi. The lemon gnocchi was a bit more lemony than I expected, but still very good. Ended the meal with a molten lava cake and side of ice-cream, which was to die for! The cake came out warm, soft, and delicious. It wasn't as sweet as most lava cakes I've had, which I loved!Will definitely return in the future!",0,0,0,Sharon Y.,"New York, NY",387,93,12

The service is attentive but not to the extent that its bothersome. I shared a lobster bisque as well as the grilled calamari for an appetizer. Both were very good. The bisque is quite heavy so keep that in mind if you order a large entree. The grilled calamari was perfectly cooked and seasoned with garlic, herbs and olive oil. I also shared the ribeye with whipped potatoes and the salmon with black rice with my dining companion. The salmon was just okay for me - not bad, just very simple. I enjoyed the ribeye. The whipped potatoes were buttery and fluffy- I've never met a starch I didn't like - a great side!For dessert, I had the molten lava cake which was rich, warm, and all the things one would love about a molten lava cake.

The fish was fresh and the oysters and lobster appetizers were very high quality. The whole thing was just a bit outdated, not modern. The service was good, everything was clean and all that. The entrees were just over worked. When you have top quality fish, you don't need to pile a bunch of crap on the plate. I had a grouper that was swimming in a heavy sauce with some weird stuffed (supposedly with lobster although it was undetectable) pepper that added nothing to the dish.

We asked if he could comp us a new drink due to the error, and he nodded, smiled and brought us a new drink.  But when we got our bill at the end of the dinner, we saw that he charged us for both of them.  We were under the impression the second drink was on the house but instead we got banged twice for $17.  We didn't want to make a big deal about it but it certainly left a bad taste in our mouths after having such a lovely time and meal.  And it's just the principle...ya know?",2,2,0,Jessica B.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",39,47,101

The heirloom tomato salad consisted of a variety of heirloom tomatoes with bits of really tasty goat cheese.The Branzino was moist and buttery with a light lemon and caper sauce, cooked to perfection. The halibut was firm, moist and flavorful.Since it was a special occasion, we asked Bes for his recommendation for dessert--his description of the key lime tart was mouthwatering, so we went with that.

When we were seated we were served some bread which was good, which my boyfriend really liked. We also got a nice bottle of champagne that our wonderful waiter Jaime made sure to pour in our glasses throughout the night. It was the best champagne I have ever had, but I don't know what it was called. They also had an extensive menu of wines which sounded amazing too. For dinner my boyfriend got the yellow fin tuna and was in love with it. He said it was the best he's had in a while and tasted fresh and wild caught. I got the surf and turf which came with a 9 Oz piece of filet mignon, a piece of lobster, a piece of crab, and a piece of shrimp. It was amazing and everything was so tasty. As a side we got the lobster mac and cheese and it was too die for. I would definitely recommend that. While the portion look small I think it's important to note how filling they were. We were worried we would still be hungry after this but we were so wrong. I couldn't finish my dinner and we had to bring that and the lobster mac and cheese home.

It was hard to get the attention of the servers at times, but there are a lot of bussers running around, and managers standing around.We had the following dishes:-Crab cake - full of shell pieces and bland ($23)-Lobster bisque - salty and more shrimpy than lobster flavor ($15)-Porterhouse - tough and chewy ($104)-Cod - overcooked, not memorable ($38)-Lobster mac and cheese - overcooked, mostly cheese ($16)-Brussels sprouts - nicely charred and tender, well-seasoned, probably the best food of the meal and I don't even like Brussels sprouts ($11)-Mushrooms - I think they forgot to season this because it was bland and undressed ($13)-Molten cake - the cake was rubbery, but the Molten was there so maybe it was undercooked (free with check-in)-Cheesecake - not dense enough to be called NY cheesecake ($12)-Creme brulee - it was ok but I think the texture was a bit off, too gooey ($12)Overall, it's not terrible, but I would prefer to never come back. They have nice matches though.",3,1,0,Diane Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",247,1155,126
5.0,7/30/2016,"If you are looking for a beautiful meal in Midtown East, you must go to the Sea Fire Grill for dinner.  The new chef (as of about two months ago, from Madrid and a Michelin star restaurant) brings beautiful, seasonal dishes to the table.  Whenever a restaurant offers squash flowers on the menu, I know that the chef is seriously looking at what is available from local/seasonal farms because these beauties only last a few weeks and not every chef knows what to do with them.  In this case they were enhanced with a very delicate home-made ricotta cheese, lightly breaded and sautéed to perfection.  There was more to the dish that only made it better, but all I can say is...DELISH.We share everything we order (unless we order steak, not very often) so we also enjoyed the beef carpaccio which was divine, the quality of the beef was outstanding and the accompaniments were perfect, as well as the monkfish special and the heirloom tomato salad.  I could go on and on about everything but the thing that really stood out was the tomato salad.  I could eat it all day long.  It was wonderful.  Finally, we had the special Profiterole with ice cream in a special chocolate sauce. We NEVER order dessert. But tonight we did and I would regret it if we didn't.  And now I am laying in my comfy bed at the Benjamin Hotel and I am smiling at the remembrance of my very memorable dinner at The Sea Fire Grill.  Thank you, Ari, our waiter, and kudos to Jesus, the chef.",1,0,0,Sally D.,"Newton, MA",55,3,0

I decided on getting the lunch Lobster Roll and a shared side of Lobster mac and cheese. The lobster mac and cheese was amazing. It was the perfect cheese to lobster ratio and the pasta was cooked to perfection. The lobster roll was also perfect. It was a nice amount of lobster to bread ratio.

When we ordered (Yellow Fin tuna Bolognese and Branzino), it seemed just perfect. The decent bottle of Chablis for $57 took some edges off too. By the time our entrees arrived, it seemed that there was a noise explosion. The couple adjacent to us said they couldn't hear each other in conversation and left before their food arrived. Overall, we fared o.k. but - if we were to return (I doubt it), we would bring earplugs. These inebriated businessmen were screaming. And so many of them.

4.0,7/19/2016,"First off I want to thank the staff for calmly changing my reservation to earlier when I requested  a change only 2 and a half hours before my reservation. When I arrived at the restaurant I was immediately seated. The waiter came over and brought us water and then proceeded to tell my family and I the specials. We ordered and were brought our first course promptly. I got the crab cakes. Decadent with Red Pepper Coulis, Tartar Sauce, Frisee Salad and Celery Root. The two sauces complimented the crab perfectly. I was happy there were not too many bread crumbs and it was mostly crab. The crab cakes were also perfectly seared on the outside. Easily the standout dish of the night for me. My parents each ordered a Bibb Lettuce Salad which they liked but they probably wouldn't order again. For next course my parents had a tomato based soup special with crab which was outstanding. And I ate the steak tartare which was good but it wasn't up to hype I've heard from some yelpers. For final course my parents got a variety of seafood cooked in tomato sauce which was all perfectly cooked according to my father and was his favorite dish of the night. My mother ordered Tuna which I tasted and also was sensational. My final dish the scallops were very rich and the sauce took a little bit away from the taste of the scallops. I understand the concept was to try to make the scallops a bit richer but I enjoy eating scallops as a lighter dish. My parents got the lava cake for dessert and were thrilled. Overall, the food is outstanding but there are comparable restaurants like upstate and LoLo's seafood shack which serve a lot of the same items for much less. This is something I will come back to despite the prices because the quality of the seafood cannot be overstated.

4.0,4/30/2016,"4 stars review -  I didn't have a great dining experience at the Sea Fire Grill (see my original review below).  However, this updated 4 star review is for the customer service delivered by one of the business owners, Alban P. of the Benjamin Restaurant Group.  As soon as I posted my Yelp review, I was contacted by Alban.  And within 2 weeks, I was in touch with Samantha who works for the Benjamin Restaurant Group.  They really showed me their sincerity in the process of addressing my concerns and all they asked for in return is for me to  give the restaurant a second chance.  They also assured me that the issues would be addressed as soon as possible.  I have yet to find time to stop by the Sea Fire Grill again, but my experience with Alban and Samantha has shown me how much the restaurant group cares about the quality of their product and customer satisfaction.  I could say that this is a good business. 1.5 stars review - Came here for a V-day dinner.  They had a set menu for the day.  I ordered an appetizer made with tuna, the Maine lobster and chocolate cake for dessert.  Food came out 5 minutes after we placed the order and it looked and tasted like they were pre-made (and they just heat it up).  The appetizer tasted bland.  The lobster was not fresh and it didn't taste good.  It's sad to say that even Red Lobster has better lobsters than this place.  I understand that the quality could be off because it's a prix fixe menu for V-day, but make no mistake, I come here for business lunches often because of its location and ease at getting a reservation (perhaps not a good sign), and the food is never great (and I love seafood).  Being that SFG is supposed to be a seafood restaurant, but it doesn't prepare great seafood, I am giving it 1.5 stars.  Also, one of the servers on the team is very rude, he stepped on my friend's shoe by accident, and without offering an apology, he actually made a disgusted face.  The rest of the team seems to be nice though.  However, food at this place would make me not want to come back.",0,0,0,Peggie Y.,"New York, NY",223,199,2692

4.0,4/10/2016,The Sea Fire Grillllllll...... Let me start off by saying the Food is Deliciooooooous.... There were no disappointments in our appetizers nor our main entrées.We started off with:1. Crab cake... it is worth it and the price tag2. Prawns.... very goooooooooood.... but not worth the price tag because it is only one piece of shrimp... come on Management... for that price tag it could have been two pieces of shrimp.Main Entrées:1. 2lbs Lobster stuffed w crab meat... 10 dayum stars2. Bone in Rib Eye.. medium well... hot dayum 50 dayum stars... it was one of the best steaks I've had other than Del Frisco. So fresh so tastey so good3. Cat Fish.... cleaned the plate good..Sides:1. Lobster Mac & Cheese.... you can not I repeat you can't not order this side... it is so good... it is baked in the dish.... with plum lobster meat.... awesome dude!2. Brussel Sprouts.... when I tell you the flavor of the brussel sprouts with nuts in a tangy light sauce... you will never look at Brussel Sprouts the same.. trust me!3. Creamed Spinach... deliciousThe ambience was nice... very nice staff.... service was good... however Del Frisco had an edge up on customer service and Desert... see my review for more details..I enjoyed The Sea Fire Grillllllll and would definitely be back....

For dessert we got the molten lava (on the smaller side--I'd say for 1 person), NY cheesecake, and apple tart. Overall really enjoyed the pei mussel appetizer-- comes pretty large so it's a good share. The red snapper and NY strip were good as well. I personally like the apple tart a lot. Not super sweet and is shareable between two. We had a really sweet and personable waiter. He said he was from Albania and really struck up conversation.

Beer selections focus on the average and are a little disappointing. WHAT TO ORDER: Tuna / HalibutWHAT TO AVOID: Lobster bisque is a little thin and characterless.

Was greeted promptly by the hostess and despite having a reservation still had a couple moments to get a drink at the bar. Before the drinks came the table was ready and we sat. They have an extensive menu, fresh oysters, caviar, fish, you name it. In addition they carry pretty much every cut of meat on the bovine. We started with the East Coast oysters. Out of the dozen, two were Beyond words good and the rest were also great. The caviar came with small circular pieces of bread along with egg whites, yolks, creme fresh and some freshly chopped herbs. They offer both American and Russian wild sturgeon varieties, we opted for the American and it was great.  Our waiter was Milot,  a very charming and knowledgable young man. He greeted us promptly and informed us of the specials. After the appetizers were ordered and consumed, my daughter and I split the bone in ribeye, medium rare of course. The wife ordered the seafood pasta. For sides we had the mac and cheese and creamed spinach. Being the mac n cheese afficinardo my daughter commented it was the best mac n cheese ever!  The creamed spinach was also great. The ribeye was cooked and seasoned to perfection, truly an epic steak!  The pasta tasted as if the noodles were made from scratch and the accompanying seafood and red sauce was a harmonious symphony of flavors that equated to a flavor party in the mouth!  I used the yelp app to check in for a free molten chocolate desert. Forgive my description if it's a bit off from a culinary standpoint. It's like a freshly baked brownie with melted chocolate inside, scrumptious!  Served with what tasted like a hazelnut, mocha, mousse and a scoop of what seemed like a faint hint of strawberry ice cream with delicious nuggets of chocolate inside.

4.0,2/15/2016,"Update: went for Valentine's Day round two. They last minute changed the Valentine's day they had online, which was pretty disappointing. The servers always seem to be the issue here. We couldn't even get a hold of ours any of the times we wanted him, and he was completely unamused with us. Been here a couple times and am always so happy with it. It's definitely pricey, but it's good for special occasion or when you just want a really good meal.  First time I went was Valentine's Day 2015, and while I'm skeptical of eating out of Valentine's Day, it went smooth. We were even pretty late and they were accommodating. Fixed menu had lobster and filet as entree options (both were great), had oysters and tuna tartar as app options (also to die for) and came automatically with sides, caviar and champagne. Everything was so good, the second time we came back we basically recreated the first meal. My s/o and I are really big on tuna tartar and oysters (they have a couple options which is always nice). Lobster was fabulous again (they even made me brown butter upon request) and my s/o loved the filet with foie gras. Drinks are pretty pricey but that's to be expected.

The hostess greeted us and told us to sit by the bar and she will get us. We had a couple of drinks, pretty strong but not bad. The bartender was very nice. We were seated about 9 as the place was very busy and understandable for nyc .We were seated with a nice full size table for the 2 of us with plenty of room. Our waited is James or Jaime from Chile and we thought he was Russian because of his accent. Appetizer: tuna tartare and crab cakeVery good, fresh tuna and crab meat was real deal.Dinner: 20 oz ribeye bone in, charred excellently and perfect temperature. It's probably one of the best steaks I had and I had many.Red snapper: pan fried over bed of mash potatoes, nice crispy skin and not overlooked.We skipped desert as we were full. The service was impeccable by our waiter and staff members. The manager kept on walking around to make sure everything was good. The dinner bill is acceptable based on what we ordered and place of business.The 4 stars is because the bar tab is $32 for 2 drinks, a bit pricey .

The restaurant is dimly lit, with white table cloths and waiters in crisp white button downs and black slacks. It's upscale but I saw those dining dressed a variety of different ways.Came here one date night after seeing other great reviews and photos and the place actually held up. The seafood was veery fresh and expertly cooked. As a drink I ordered an Old Fashioned which was great and I think only $12. I believe they used Makers Mark whiskey which I was happy about, not the cheap stuff. You're given bread with a ""whitefish spread""; it's really good. As an appetizer I ordered the pan seared scallops. While they tasted amazing I do feel it could have been a little more on the plate; you get two pieces and they weren't as big as the waiter expressed to me. For an entree I ordered the roasted whole branzino and traded the side for whipped Yukon gold potatoes and a side of lobster Mac and cheese to share. I was very satisfied, everything tasted amazing and was cooked just right. There was really no need for desert as I was more then full from my meal.

I almost want to burn my tongue that's how hot I like my meals. The lobster bisque was WAYYYYYYY too buttery. It overpowered the dish sadly but they we're happy to send it back and offered other suggestions. For our main course I had the filet steak and a side of potatoes. I asked for the steak medium well (I usually like it medium but I don't take the change for it being under at an upscale establishment) and it was perfect. Melt in your mouth and well seasoned, I was impressed. My boyfriend had the stuffed lobster with crab and wow it was gorgeous and delicious. I swiped a bite before my boyfriend could even try it... oops :) After dinner they asked us if we wanted dessert or coffee which we declined. They brought out ice cream and a candle and respectful sang happy birthday as to not disturb the other dinners. Our waiter had a few tables so he was a bit all over and we had to flag him down for the check but it was nice to not feel rushed. All and all it was great.

3.0,10/22/2015,Worst lobster bisque I have ever had.  No flavor.  It needed salt.  It needed something.  The pieces of lobster were minuscule.  I am pretty sure that this is the first time that something was described as sherry lobster bisque and I decided that it was not worth the calories after a few bites.  My friend had the lobster roll and it was very small so I would avoid unless you want a small snack.  The salmon was pretty good.   There was a nice selection of east coast vs west coast oysters.  The service was good.  Did I mention that I would go elsewhere for lobster?,3,0,0,Amy O.,"Glencoe, IL",182,337,382

I looked hard to find a reasonably priced bottle of wine and wound up with an uninspiring Chablis.  The food was very good.  The Bibb salad and the tuna tartare were really good.  We all had the swordfish, which was well prepared.  Good cappuccino for dessert.  It's a nice restaurant.  It felt like a steakhouse (steak is on the menu, as well).

2.0,9/28/2015,"We came here for our first wedding anniversary, on recommendation that the service here was outstanding and we value good service. Unfortunately, it was anything but outstanding. Our waiter seemed very inexperienced, wasn't personable, didn't know the few specials without reading off the menu, and wouldn't recommend a wine for us. He sent the sommelier over, who couldn't have been more uninterested--just asked a budget and pointed to a wine, gave us no characteristic of the wine except saying it was ""beautiful."" Granted, the wine was good, though not amazing. He kept coming over to pour small pours of the wine, and then a minute later our waiter would come and pour the glasses higher (we liked the small pours because the wine had to breathe). Nothing was coordinated. There was also a big party seated behind us (why they seated us there is a mystery, it's not like the place was packed), and they kept bringing out their food noisily on stands right next to us, like our experience wasn't a priority because they'd get a bigger tip from a larger party. As for the food, the impressively large prawns were overlooked, and the filet mignon cut had a third of the cut with a ton of fat and way overdone. It seemed like the chef came out to ask everyone how the food was, and no one really came over to make sure we were happy. We left without dessert and and no one even greeted us goodnight. It was a very disappointing night. We went elsewhere for dessert and was treated with amazing service and we realized that Sea Fire is just not a place we'll return to. Seems like they cater mostly to business visitors from the nearby hotels with big business budgets and don't care much about anyone else.

5.0,9/14/2015,"Before I wrote anything else, I would say if you enjoy seafood, Seafire is a spot you should try. On to the specifics. My friend and I got there around 5:00 when the place was pretty much empty. By the time we left, the place was absolutely hopping. The restaurant has a ton of staff, so they are extremely attentive. You can tell by the interaction between staff that there's a lot of training between senior staff and new staff. They seem to have a culture of service and perfectionism in that vein.  I had one of those moments where I was tempted to push my glass to the edge of the table to see if someone would be quick enough to catch it before it hit the floor, but I held back. The only complaint that I would perhaps have about the service was they were a little pushy about the wines, recommending higher-priced ones. That is pretty much par for the course at most restaurants in Manhattan.  Our waiter was friendly, attentive, there, but not hovering.  He excels at his job. And even though it was pretty packed by the time we left, I did not get the sense that they were trying to push us out after we completed our meal.  They even gave us a buyback, assuming because they did not have the wine that we originally ordered. It was a nice touch that separates them from a lot of other restaurants.The food was delicious in taste, but I would have to agree with a number of the other reviews that the food was a little tepid and the shellfish was perhaps not as firm as I'm used to at other restaurants or how I would cook it.  I now question whether all of those other places and myself have overcooked the shellfish previously. I'm thankful it wasn't fishy or rubbery. The layers of flavors were well thought out. My friend had the special. I had the prawns and scallop appetizers served as an entrée.  Neither of us left anything edible on our plates.Whatever the smoked moose/butter was with the bread was absolutely outstanding. The sauces and flavors that are used for each dish complemented the seafood well.  The prices for food and drink were reasonable for what the establishment is, a seafood restaurant with extensive wine list. I actually expected some prices to be a little higher, but I'm glad that they are reasonable. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone who likes seafood or meat (there are quite a number of meat and chicken dishes on the menu). They also have raw bar offerings, like oysters on the half shell prepared in numerous ways.",1,0,1,Kerry M.,"Yonkers, NY",110,93,66

3.0,9/6/2015,"Excellent service. Pleasant and calm ambiance. Food was between average and good.This place has a great wine list, and a tempting menu. The best part really was the ultra attentive and friendly service. Our biggest complaint was the food TEMPERATURE, which is so crucial to a good experience in my opinion. On a better note, their complimentary whitefish spread is fabulous. We had our Sea Fire experience on an uncrowded Sunday evening. We ordered:Crab cakes: Had a great amount of crab with minimal bread crumbs. Delicious tartar & red pepper sauces. Same complaint that will run throughout this review: not hot enough.Scallop app: Decent, well cooked, but not hot enough. Sauces and puree did not pair well with this dish in my opinion. However, they were high quality scallops and had that nice soft/buttery texture.3 lb crab stuffed lobster: Thrilled our waiter shelled this for us beautifully, but the crab stuffing was fishy and over salted. The whole dish was also luke warm. Butter sauce was also served luke warm to practically cold, and could have used some herbs and/or garlic options to add some flair for the $90 price tag of this dish... Though we understand this is an expensive menu option...we weren't pleased with the preparation. Filet mignon: Nice cut, well prepared. Could have used a creative sauce of some kind for a $50 dish. Creamed spinach puree side:  Delicious, but also, not hot enough. Asparagus with mushroom sauce side: Not hot enough, but blanched perfectly. Molten lava chocolate cake: Fabulous, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. The one thing that actually came out hot. No complaints.Tiramisu: Tasted pre-packaged, did not embody the delicateness I've enjoyed in other tiramisu experiences.

Words cannot express how much I appreciated my taste buds. It was me and 2 of my lady coworkers and we ordered the dozen west side oysters (they brought out 3 different kinds- all freaking omg delicious and so creamy), an order of calamari (very good too- I loved the way they fried the calamari and the batter wasn't too thick), a porterhouse steak for 2, a 3lb lobster, a side of asparagus and mushroom, AND lobster mac and cheese. We also ordered a few glasses of their Cabernet (so smooooooth). I was really sad because we couldn't finish all of our food (our eyes are bigger than our stomach- well, I guess..hehe)I am what you would call- a smacker. Yes indeed, I smack when I eat because I think it makes the food tastes better and I just enjoy it etc etc just kidding it's just a bad hAbit. HOWEVER, I was completely silent the whole time eating. The oysters were the best I have ever had, the steak was soooo tender and just so perfectly seasoned and cook, and the lobster was also sooooo tender. I literally had to face palm because of all the deliciousness going on I couldn't handle it- I almost cried(no joke). I was definitely so happy and also so sad, because I'm from Atlanta and don't go up to NY that often..it was one of the most bittersweet feelings I'd ever had. (I love food too much).

The sauce was a great compliment to the dish as was the bok choy.  I ordered a side of the kale/fingerings/ goat cheese, but I was afraid to eat as I was worried the goat cheese would change the profile too much.  Overall, it was a good meal though slightly on he pricey side for a Wednesday night dinner.  Per usual I'll be back",0,0,0,Michael M.,"New York, NY",393,13,27

We did not have a reservation & was able to sit at a high top table in the bar area. They have the fancy water lit wall but if you sit there you have a view of the kitchen so we moved up to the front. We were greeted & served promptly. The only thing I didn't like was the hostess just handed us the menus & walked away. At an upscale place usually you are handed a menu individually & they are placed ready to open. Oh well no biggy.My husband had the seafood fridiablo over the pasta. The sauce was good. I tried a mussel it was slimy due to being undercooked. The pasta was a tad firm. More than aldente.I had crab cakes for an appetizer, there were 2, they were small but very good. I also love gnocchis. So I had a 2nd appetizer for my meal the mushrooms with goat cheese & lemon gnocchis. The mushrooms were very good & so were the gnocchis. However, the mushrooms were overpowering. The dish was mostly mushrooms. There were only 4 smaller gnocchi & 1 small piece of one.   Good dish but should be more gnocchi with some mushrooms.Overall dinner was good. Not great for the price.

I took my lovely great white buffalo/snow angel here for a nice Saturday evening dinner. We made our reservations well in advanced but still  waited. When we arrived the hostess told us to hang out at the bar until our table was ready. So, why not? We ended up having several drinks racking up a bill bigger than our own dinner. Granted we waited for over an hour! Over an hour wait even with reservations! When we were finally seated, the waiters were very quick to take our drinks and order. They provided bread with the best fish/butter spread ever. I ordered the 20oz bone in New York strip while the lady ordered a 2 pound lobster. The wait was extensive and very taxing. We ended up getting so wasted we bearly touched our actual meals. I felt kind of bad as we almost passed out on our own dining table. From what I remember, the food itself was fantastic. Steak was so juicy and well prepared. Comes out sizzling and somewhat precut for you!! For a moment I though I was going to be spoon fed. Lobster was also juicy and well made. Creme brûlée for desert, not a bad way to top it off. I really would love to give this restaurant a full 5 stars!! Their food quality really does deserve a full 5!

The menu wasn't creative but a traditional dependable menu with the regulars for entrees, sides, and starters. The crowd was a bit odd. It seemed like a lot of people who don't often go out to upscale restaurants, but made the visit for Valentine's Day. The set menu was affordable given the options and compared to the other Valentine's Day set menus of other restaurants in the city. It's not a trendy spot that I'm more accustomed to lately with the newer restaurants popping up everywhere but more of the odd school fine dining experience, which is sometimes all you need as long as the food lives up.

The cocktails, wine and food were all prepared with talent - very tasty. My Manhattan was one of the best I've had. The wine list was extensive. We had a delicious calamari appetizer followed by excellent salads and plates of scallops and snapper. Our server was not worth the gratuity I left him. When my wife asked for recommendations, he talked down to her and was not all that helpful. Later in the meal, I couldn't find him more than once. The water attendant kept our glasses full and took care of getting more bread, etc. But our waiter dropped the ball, and I told that to the manager (Aron) as I left, who apologized and offered me a round of drinks to his credit. We didn't take him up on the offer since our daughters were ready to leave, but I always appreciate it when a manager seeks to do the right thing. Again, the food was superb and most everything else was very good. If not for the $350 price tag, I'd give the Sea Fire a 5 even with the substandard service.

Our water glasses were topped off seemingly every 30 seconds and the bread basket that we shamelessly devoured was refilled without question. You may judge me now, but you, too, will devour the bread once you taste the insanely flavorful whitefish spread. I started with the Madagascar Garlic Prawns which were juicy, but not too oily, and followed it up with the Blackened Montauk Swordfish, a great one-two punch.

It was incredibly rude, and I love bread. Additionally, we were looking forward to ordering a bottle of wine to have throughout our meal. We weren't given a wine list until our main entrees arrived, so we each ended up ordering a glass.

I was told to check our coats & that our table would be ready in a few minutes. But right when they took the last coat, we were escorted to the table right by the fire place. The food was amazing. We had shrimp, calamari & crab cakes for appetizers. All were very delicious. For our entrées 3 of us had filet mignon (juicy & tender) with herb fries/whipped potatoes both were good. My mother had lamb & my father had scallops. The sauce the lamb came in was amazing. For drinks we had love potions, white wine and Long Island ice teas. The love potion was so good. After dinner, they bought out my birthday cake that my parents brought followed by a complimentary glass of a red port wine for each of us. Needless to say the service was amazing! Very nice staff. The bill with all of our drinks, appetizers & entrees came to a little over $400, but with all we ordered we thought it would be a lot more. It was definitely worth it!

Right away we were delighted to be served a basket of warm fresh foccacia bread and flat bread accompanied with a rich, savory, and comforting spread of reduced, buttery white fish stock, mascarpone cheese, with fresh herbs.I started with Bibb lettuce salad, the lettuce was clean and crisp,the balsamic dressing was just perfect,and not tangy. The salad had a crunch from the candied pecans, the chew of the  dried cranberries and real chunks of crumbled blue cheese.I tried The blackened swordfish, which was perfectly done with just the right amount of spice- not overkill. The fish was flaky and juicy. The accoutrement's sided with the swordfish were an avocado spread and a creamy tartar.One person at our table raved about how fresh and delicious her shellfish-Linguine Fra Diavolo was, as she commented a few times on how fresh the calamari and seafood in her dish was.We all shared a few of the sides. One was the Baby Kale, fingerling's and goat cheese side. The flavor of this side powed you in an awesome way, as did the roasted brussel sprouts with bacon (The bacon was more like yummy thick cut pieces of pork belly bacon.For desert we loved the Molten chocolate cake, served with red velvet ice cream -there are almost no words for decadent dessert-we also shared their classic Creme Brulee-You Can Not Go Wrong with this, we loved it........As a matter of fact-we just loved everything!I suppose we simply did not know, first hand how amazing the Sea Fire Grill was until we were lucky enough to have dinner there.I was chatting with a local customer at the bar, that told me how awesome their steaks were as well.Note to self: Go back to this restaurant!I'm not even one to write on yelp, but We had such a great experience- between the atmosphere, the awesome food, and the friendliness of the staff, I am happy to spread the word!",1,0,1,Cherub N.,"Nyack, NY",0,4,1

2.0,1/31/2015,"I've been here a couple times and am not impressed. The service was odd this last time -- they tried to take our starters away while we were still eating them, then apologized and left, but then came back a few seconds later with our entrees and tried to squeeze them onto our table while we ate our starters. We scarfed down the rest of our apps so we could clear those plates. Then they asked to clear our entree plates even though my friend still had half her lobster meat left to go. We felt pressured into bagging the leftovers so they could clear those plates too. If the restaurant was overbooked or something, I wish they would have just told us. Minus one star.The food is nothing special. I found the combination of flavors in the crab/pear/goat cheese salad off putting. The lobster mac-n-cheese was dry. Skip dessert here -- the server recommended the apple dessert but it had a very odd slimy texture and I didn't like the cinnamon ice cream that came with it. My friend wasn't crazy about her tiramisu either. Minus a second star. The restaurant gets VERY loud. We would have ordered some coffee/tea at the end and kept chatting, but by the end of our meal we couldn't hear each other at all, even though we were seated away from the main crowd, against a window.

After checking in with the hostess or someone, who was too busy on her iPhone or smart phone, we were told the table will be ready soon. At 8:20 I was getting impatient -  I dared to interrupt  the young lady from her texting and told her that we had been waiting for 35 minutes for a table and we had reservations - her reply to me, with a sarcastic and condensing tone was - "" you have been waiting for 27 minutes""!!! At that point I asked for my coat back and was about to walk out - then the manager Aaron showed up - in 5 seconds he turned the situation around - the owners should thank their lucky stars - he was amazing - he somehow convinced us to stay. I must say - I  am glad we did! Because the food was wonderful. We had oysters from east and west coast. Which were fresh and amazing. Then the main course - halibut was fresh and tasty as was the the kale with goat cheese as a side dish. My daughter had the Filet Rossini with Foie gras and black truffles - she loved it. The service was attentive and Aaron checked in on us periodically. It is amazing how one employee can completely turn the situation around. Thanks to Aaron the manager, we stayed and enjoyed out dinner. There are 100s of restaurants in NYC that serve great food - but if the service is not good - you don't go back - I think I will be back.

The uninspiring food notwithstanding, the service from our waiter really ruined the experience for my mom and I. We were the only non-White clientele at the restaurant; I'm not trying to make any insinuations but our waiter did not treat us with the same enthusiasm as the other tables.Once we sat down, the waiter immediately asked us if we wanted to start with wine. We told him that we needed a few more minute to look at the wine menu and would settle for water for now. He immediately took our wine glasses away and assumed that we wouldn't be ordering wine. When he took our orders, he seemed very impatient during the whole process. At one point he repeated something as if we were children who didn't understand English. It gets better - he never proactively came once to refill our glasses, serve us our entrees, nor check in on us once throughout the meal.

I still think I had the best one.  We ordered mashed potatoes, which were nice and garlicky with a nice balance of saltiness, as well as an order of brussel sprouts (minus the bacon it normally comes with).For dessert, we ordered apple pie with cinnamon ice cream and pecan oatmeal crumble.  It was a lovely combination of warm with cold, apple with cinnamon finished with a wonderful crumble of pecans, brown sugar and oatmeal.  Come on, who wouldn't love that?  My daughter ordered the chocolate molten cake, which came with red velvet ice cream.  Although I didn't taste it, she said it was quite good.  She's become quite the foodie, so I'll trust her assessment.The ambience was very relaxed, but romantic enough for a date and chic enough to impress someone.  It was visually appealing.  I especially liked the waterfall wall.  (Not sure what it's actually called, but it was hypnotic.)  Speaking of appealing, the waiters were all good-looking and friendly, and they worked very hard to ensure that our dining experience was pleasurable.  I also watched what I assume was the manager run back and forth all evening watching over every detail of how the restaurant was run.  It was a very enjoyable meal for our last night in New York City.  Hopefully, we will return soon...... to both New York..... and this restaurant.",7,3,4,Claudia B.,"Simi Valley, CA",1144,1299,6819

We decided to order a nice bottle of Pinto Noir, Meiomi from California. This ended up to be the perfect choice! Light enough not to over power the seafood. Their bread service was very good with the signature white fish butter, wish I could get the butter shipped to me in Dallas, so good! For our main course we ordered Halibut and Salmon with a side order of Brussel Sprouts with bacon. The Salmon was very good, but nothing special.

In July of this year I stopped in with friends for drinks and desserts one night and then for a birthday sinner in September. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, classy, quiet but NOT STUFFY. From the front door to your wait staff you are put at ease and made to fell very welcome. I will admit, I am not a seafood person at all. However, Sea Fire has a Rib Eye Steak that was amazing. It came out very hot & very juicy with a little char on it. The Chef was able to and kind enough to make a side of potatoes for me like they have at Benjamin's but not on the menu at Sea Fire. I highly recommend you ask if they would do the same for you as that is a great side for the Rib Eye and they are cooked to perfection. The desserts are all made in house and if you don't get the cheesecake with the graham cracker crust you are missing out for sure. As fantastic as the food is at Sea Fire, the only thing that can top it is their staff. If you look up the word Prenominal you will see words like, remarkable, exceptional, incredible, unbelievable and extraordinary. With that I can safely say their staff is Phenomenal! From the greeting at the front door, to the bussers, it appears that each employee is a part owner. They take great care of each guest. Too often I see at restaurants where staff members will pass your table without even looking at you. I was at another place in NY during the same weekend and my server appeared to have gotten lost or something so I had to ask two other people for refills and each said they would try to find my server to take care of that. At Sea Fire, without being intrusive, it doesn't matter what their position is, they are there to help you. I must single out Besar, the bar back who was very helpful and professional. You can tell, even as a bar back, the management has trained him very well and instilled in him ""treat the customer well."" The Sea Fire Grill is a MUST while you are in New York and you have a taste for an amazing Rib Eye or Sea Food. To me, their made in house cheesecake is worth the trip alone. Thanks to Victor, Besar, Lena and the entire staff at Sea Fire for a great experience and we will see you again very soon.",1,0,0,Terry C.,"Elyria, OH",2,18,153
2.0,10/3/2014,The Sea Fire Grill is listed second to Le Bernardin in the Zagat guide.  I have no clue how it got anywhere close to that level.  It was spectacularly average at best.  The service was friendly and ok.  The food was mediocre and the place is dated and not very clean.  It wasn't a terrible meal but I had much higher expectations.,2,0,0,Robert F.,"Manhattan, NY",18,133,1120

5.0,9/30/2014,"I hate New York restaurants, every time I go , they are overpriced, and overrated. Why? Because New Yorkers are in denial. when they pay for the restaurants! nobody wants to feel like they are getting ripped off. It makes them feel stupid. So, to justify, let's give it a great review. Now you a deny this, yet you also pay $17 for a drink you can get a bottle for half that. But with that said, this place rocked, and Madison the server of ours was terrific.  If you go, only request her or don't go.  And, when you go to a place, be happy, don't go with reservations.  Just show up, say you don't want reservations, ask for Madison, and enjoy your luscious meal and experience.  Five stars.",0,0,0,Howie G.,"Fairfield, CT",8,25,0

4.0,9/18/2014,"We only tried a limited portion of the menu.  My buddy had the rib eye, which he raved about.  It appeared a perfect medium rare as requested.  I had the halibut, which was also perfectly cooked, with a picturesque sear on the surface and leaving a tender, flaky and moist interior.  However, the beurre blanc left something to be desired.  It was generally under-seasoned.  The wild mushrooms we had as a side were also under-seasoned.  I believe the chef is going for the ""let the ingredients speak for themselves"" approach.  However, jazzing up the beurre blanc with the halibut would do quite well.  Perhaps introduce some citrus or a floral note to that dish to slightly and delicately provide some elevation.  The wine-by-the-glass list was succinct, yet nicely diverse in its offerings.  Everything was delightfully presented and appealing.  The atmosphere is sexy.  The service as also superb.  Our waiter was easily able to read that he was dealing with two Army Officers that knew exactly what they wanted and weren't fussy.  He took our order and didn't hassle us beyond the customary single visit to inquire as to our satisfaction.  Overall I would like to revisit and try some of the other dishes.  We were just pressed for time and couldn't be more exploratory.  I would go back.",0,0,0,Charlie R.,"Oakland, NJ",0,78,27

For the main course my bf had the red snapper which was cooked and seasoned perfectly. It was definitely the star of the menu seeing that at least one person at every table ordered it. I had the lobster salad which was decent. We also got a side of the herb fries which we didn't like at all. They were limp and unseasoned and neither one of us had much.

3.0,7/21/2014,"Went here for my anniversary dinner and I have to say that I was very surprised to think it was ""just okay."" My boyfriend and I had the prawns and the crab cakes as appetizers; the surf & turf and the snapper as an entree; and the creamed spinach and the lobster mac, as sides. I'm sad to say that my favorite part of the meal was probably the crab cakes. Some reviews state that the prawns are ""too garlicky,"" but I guess my experience falls on the opposite end of the spectrum, in that I didn't think they had any flavor at all. On the contrary, the crab cakes were crisp on the outside and moist on the inside, served with really flavor dipping sauces (one was obviously tartar sauce, but I am unsure as to what the other one was. Regardless, it added a great kick to the dish). On to the entrees: the surf & turf was very good, but my fish was soggy!! I couldn't even believe it. The lobster (and the crab stuffing) were very fresh and the steak was tender.. however, it was nothing new and didn't go above & beyond what one would EXPECT a steak to taste like. Therefore, it was just okay. The creamed spinach was smooth & tasty, but my lobster mac & cheese was bland! Other reviewers have referred to it as the ""lobster truffle mac & cheese,"" but there is an error somewhere, bc there was no taste of truffle whatsoever. So, either the reviewer mislabeled it as truffle mac & cheese, or the chef forgot to flavor the dish... I took two bites and couldn't even eat it bc it tasted (and felt) store-bought and reheated. Again, the dishes were overall ok and I would't wholeheartedly recommend against eating here.. however, I would eat here with caution. If you are a New Yorker and have had the luxury of having an expansive list of dining experiences, this restaurant probably won't fall on the top of your list. However, if you are a tourist and haven't had the opportunity to taste the best of New York, then I guess this would be an okay start..In general: service is VERY good. Staff is attentive, kind, and very patient. You will not feel rushed and you will not feel that the place is ""too stuffy."" Also, the portions are very good. So if portion size is on your checklist when deciding where to go, you could check this place off. Because again, the price is reasonable for the portion, and I can't say that the food was bad. I really have to emphasize that it just wasn't the best. Not for me, at least.P.S. Their cocktails are very good and so is their wine list.",1,0,0,M J.,"Manhattan, NY",1,13,1
1.0,7/19/2014,"Came here for my 30th birthday with my husband and I was really looking forward to some great lobster. However, my lobster was overcooked and rubbery.. Tasted musty and old. It was barely edible to the point where I could only eat half the tail. Left the rest to be tossed because I am 5 months pregnant and was seriously worried I was going to get myself very ill eating bad lobster. My husband's halibut was overcooked and the sauce was boring and uninspiring. We could have made this better at home. His dish came with two sprigs of asparagus. TWO. Why bother with the vegetable at all?!? The butter for the bread was salty and disgusting. Also inedible. I was dressed for an upscale midtown restaurant.. The rest of the customers, not so much. I felt like I walked into a happy hour bar in Times Square. The atmosphere was LOUD, very unromantic, and very little space between tables. Waitstaff even clapped loudly and sang happy birthday to another table like we were at Red Robin or Olive Garden. My husband and I waited to open an envelope with the gender of our child written inside and felt like this private special moment was being shared with the entire room we were so crammed together.I went in starving.

They were really attentive to me and her. The food came out perfect. My waiter was on point. I wish I would of remember his name. I had a 2 pound lobster filled with crab meat and she had the sear tuna. The food was delicious. It came out on time, meaning it didn't take long. We had wine. Which was great. The waiter was nice enough to explain anything and everything so we felt good and taken care of. Also some thing that stand out was I went up to the hostess to ask for some type of blanket or something of the sort to throw over my girlfriend because she felt cold and unfortunately they didn't have. (Understandable, I wasn't expecting they had one). I guess the manager over heard me ask and he went over to our table and told us he lowerd the a/c a bit for us.

4.0,7/6/2014,A group of friends and I came here for a birthday dinner celebration. We had about nine in total for our group coming for dinner where half of us wanted steak and the other half wanted seafood. Sea Fire Grill definitely has a well balance menu to try both. Appetizers and a Raw bar were mainly seafood. We order all as a group to share a couple of items. All good but if I had to pick some standout of the group that we order it would be the Tuna Tartar and the Crab Cakes. Tuna Tartar is sitting on top of a bed of seaweed salad with a great sauce on the side. Crab cake quality was definitely fresh and using jumbo crab lump meat and was not the frozen type.Entrees was dead even split between large gaming fish choices and your usual steakhouse choices. Standout fish was probably the Branzino and the Halibut. Sea bass special was nothing special and lobster was cooked well but nothing special there. The steaks were very good recommendation is the bone in rib eye from me versus some of the other cuts we had.Standout sides were lobster mac & cheese and the golden yukon mash potatoes.Service was very good. I had a dessert sparkling wine that was okay. I had a passion fruit puree with champagne. It said it was puree but it felt like it was not. Overall still good.

The place is well decorated, cozy, and gives off good vibes, especially for young folks like myself but there's something for everyone here. We were attended to at the front desk by a very polite and helpful hostess who led us to the bar for some drinks so they could get our table ready. My godfather took a quick break from cheffing it up (working haha) to come out and say hello. We had our drinks and soon enough our table was ready because the place was packed-good sign.         Our party was somewhat large-7 including some family-nevertheless the staff made us feel well at home. We ordered more oysters, which were absolutely superb-fresh and salty and delicious. When it came time to order we decided to order an myriad of different dishes so we could all share and enjoy. We ordered a 3 pound lobster stuffed with crab, three of the large shrimp the names of which I do not recall, the Porterhouse for two, tuna tartar, and the yellowfin tuna entree. Everything was really good, but my favorite was the tuna tartar. It was fresh, inspired, and carefully prepared. The lobster was huge and it took myself and my cousin to take it down-okay, and maybe some help from our companions. The shrimp were of a variety that I have never tried but did not fail to disappoint, flavorful and not rubbery or tough at all. All in all the food here is very good-I highly recommend everything on that menu.         Next came dessert, which seemed to be an ambitious option after such a feast but my family was never one to back down from a challenge. Challenge was perhaps the wrong word choice as the desserts came out. I ordered the traditional Créme Brûlée, which is oftentimes not good at other eateries because they neglect to use real vanilla and the dessert will taste bland and uninteresting. Not here though! I could see the vanilla dots at the bottom of the dish, which I quickly forgot about as I was drifting away into Créme Brûlée heaven. I really can't describe the quality of that dessert because it was just that good. My eldest brother ordered the tiramisu, another example of a dessert that I seldom order at restaurants because the majority of them just don't cut it. This tiramisu blew me away, absolutely changing my outlook on tiramisu in general. My cousins also had sorbet, which was also quite good. After we successfully cleaned our plates twice and made sure there was not a crumb left, our wonderful chef came out to greet us at a lull in the dinner rush. It was late yet there was still a pretty decent crowd, telling me that people liked the atmosphere and wanted to stay after they had finished their meals to enjoy the vibes and converse. We poured on compliments and congratulations for his cooking prowess and shared a laugh or two. I am lucky to have such a cool dude for a godfather. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who comes across it!",0,0,1,Davis R.,"Hobe Sound, FL",2,22,0
5.0,4/25/2014,"We decided to come here after looking on yelp and seeing that this restaurant was clearly the highest rated in the radius of our hotel, which was located in Times Square.  After walking a mile in 5 inch stiletto heels we were not disappointed!  We were greeted by the friendliest hostesses. They knew that we walked from our hotel and asked how the walk was. They said it would be a few mins until our table was ready and escorted us to the bar. We grabbed a few drinks and by that time our table was ready. The food was spectacular and the dessert was divine. But what really stood out was the staff.

Like most said, perfectly executed and decent thus not so exciting.My blackened trout with a guacamole sauce(?) and lightly seared tuna cubes were fun and fresh. Our memorable dish was Lobster Mac & Cheese. It was delicious. Macaroni was cooked perfectly al dente rather than too soft. The texture coming from the bread crumbs on the top made it even better. Our group didn't said anything bad about their dishes and what were exciting.The service was efficient. Our attentively smiling waiter that liked small talks without disturbing us was professional. I thought most of the servers were Italian with their accent. They thought us how to say thank you in their language ""faleminderit"". Is that Albanian?",5,2,4,Taiyo O.,"New York, NY",912,589,1081
5.0,4/21/2014,"This was our first time at Sea Fire Grill and had a wonderful dinner. It was amazing the from the moment we walked through the door.  The entire staff was very friendly and truly cared about us as though we were frequent dinners at Sea Fire. We started with the Chilled Lobster, it  was a very generous portion and deliciously sweet and tender. Next was the lobster bisque which was a little disappointing. It lacked the body of a typical bisque and the flavor was a little flat. For dinner I ordered the Halibut with Beurre Blanc sauce which was incredible, probably the best prepared fish I have ever eaten. I do not eat meat so I know my fish! My husband ordered the Blackened Swordfish which he enjoyed but the Halibut was far better in my opinion. And of course who can resist Lobster Mac and Cheese? It was a perfect blend of cheeses with just enough lobster to enjoy but not overpower the dish. After the appetizer, soup, and main courses we had to try a dessert. We shared the molten cake with chocolate and raspberry ice cream. It was absolutely a wonderful finale to our dinner. The cake was moist and dripping with chocolate, so delicious. And the  ice cream, what a treat, it had to have been made onsite. Before the check arrived the manager stopped by to ask if we needed anything else. We told him we could't have been happier with such a lovely dinner and how much we enjoyed our waiter.

I cant remember, but she was great.  After a few drinks, we were ready for a snack.  She told us the menu was limited, being that it was Valentines day (Completely understandable)  After looking at the bar menu, and the Valentines prix fix, we asked her if she thought it was better we go to a table to order food?  She said it was no problem to stay at the bar.  Brought a table cloth and candles and set our little table for dinner.  The food was AMAZING!Garlic roasted prawns so big that could have been my meal.  The wedge salad was refreshing and delicious.  For dinner I had crabmeat stuffed lobster with creamed spinach and mashed potatoes.  So rich and decadent, and again the portions were huge!  I made a small dent, and wrapped most to take home.  We ended with the cheesecake (which we knew would be unbelievable, because its a favorite at Benjamin's - their steakhouse) and some sort of chocolate mousse cake with red velvet ice cream.  The red velvet ice cream is the best thing I have ever tasted.  They should sell that alone, I literally wanted to lick my plate.She brought us the check along with two shots of tequila to end the night.  Our ""quick drink"" turned into 4 1/2 hours at the bar.  Can't wait to go back again!",0,0,0,Stephanie D.,"Manhattan, NY",3,21,4

2.0,1/14/2014,"Ok, so, what is the real deal with this place? I made a reservation with high expectations given the ratings, the menu and the overall reputation, only to leave at the end of the night mildly disappointed. I shall explain. First of all, the main dining room is a narrow environment more similar to one of the latest commercial planes cabin, where the goal is to squeeze as many passengers (oops, sorry, patrons) as possible. The result? You end up dining one foot next to complete strangers and losing your voice to even attempt having a conversation with your party. Definitely NOT high end for me...Next, we order wine and it takes 30 minutes to get it, to the point that we first receive the appetizers! Furthermore, I guess because of the lack of space, the server, after pouring the wine, tells us he's going to keep it somewhere in the back where it's going to stay cold. Trusting others is always good, but we all know what kind of shenanigans happen in the restaurant industry... What if our bottle gets inadvertently switched with someone else's? Worse, what if, in the back, our server diligently pours out a little bit after each trip so that we finish it faster and we then order another one? In any case, not keeping the bottle chilled table-side is definitely another bad sign!Then, I order the recommended prawns that come covered in garlic to the point that I can't taste anything else. I can only think of my only, horrific trip to Olive Garden many years ago... I believe the comparison says it all!Bottom line, all those great reviews out there suggest I had an unfortunate evening...

That makes it great for groups or special occasions, but may not be the best bet for a romantic evening out. For those that are interested, the bar is very nice but empty... so not much of a bar scene, seems that most come here for the dining room and use the bar while waiting for their table. Service is a little over-attentive, like an old-school steakhouse. Our waiter was very polite, welcoming, and informed.

So no coffee.  REALLY!  In a city with a Starbucks on every street, you couldn't figure out how to give your customer what was ordered!Too bad the kitchen is not supported by quick thinking management.  Please step up your game here.  I'd hate to see you go out of business.",1,0,0,Lois w.,"Stamford, CT",23,9,0

I could hear some guys hollering at each other literally on the other side of the resetaraunt. Second, I was seated 40 minutes past my reservation time.

4.0,10/21/2013,"Impeccable. Summed up with one word, Sea Fire Grill is flawless in every aspect: decor, service, and food. Lets start with the decor; lots of wood tones combined with deep blue lighting gives it an aquatic feel, but in a warm inviting sense. The dining room is understated and comfy. Our night started with perfectly shucked Beau Soleil oysters paired with the Etoile Brut from Domaine Chandon, a delicious Methode Champenoise sparkling wine from Napa. The second course consisted of seared diver scallops resting atop a small bed of mashed celery root with a dash of caviar. Nothing groundbreaking but with the natural flavors of scallops and caviar, it's hard to do wrong. Afterwards, roasted halibut came plated with asparagus and chanterelle mushrooms. This dish was the only flaw on an otherwise perfect evening; the fish was dry and would've benefited from slightly less searing. The pairing of Pinot Noir from Willamette Valley was interesting at first, but the fruit-forward flavors made up for the dry fish well. The main courses were summed up by a tender and flavorful cut of sirloin, a carryover from Benjamin's. Dessert was a trio of delights: molten lava cake, ice cream, and a slice of cheesecake. Do order the molten lava cake, it's heaven wrapped in chocolate. Throughout our meal the service was spot on, much like the food. The staff has an incredible sense of timing, sliding up to refill my glass at just the right time and not hovering in any way. What more could you want?",0,0,0,Jay S.,"New York, NY",1,22,0

The lobster mac wasn't great -- both my mother in law and I make this at home and both are way better-- this one tastes like a ton of butter, lobster bisque and cheese on top, OK but not great.

3.0,8/22/2013,"Came here for a private business event.  There was about 25 of us.  Service was excellent and the wait staff was courteous.  However, the food was subpar but I'm sure there is a dish that would give this place 3 stars, hence the 3 stars.  I would have given them 2 stars but I felt that would be too harsh.One thing to note is the ""butter"" they give you with the bread.  We had vegetarians with us and I thought it was just regular butter but it wasn't.  If I tasted it correctly, it has salmon flavor infused into it.  So be careful if you are vegetarian that doesn't eat seafood.  I like the concept but not practical.I had the lobster bisque, Herb Roasted Alaskan Halibut, Yukon Gold Whipped Potatoes and Glazed carrots.When the lobster bisque soup came, it had scattered pockets of what appeared to be film on the top layer of the soup.  Maybe it was fat.  I don't know, it looked very unappealing.  Then I tried the soup and it was quite awful.  The soup was bitter and too salty.  They do give quite big pieces of lobster meat, which was fine, but the soup base, flavor, and seasoning was terrible.  I saw some people not even bother finishing the soup.The halibut looked nice, tasted okay, but subpar.  The fish didn't flake off and it was dry.  The cream sauce wasn't bad but you really needed the sauce to make the fish taste good.The sides of potatoes and carrots.  I really liked the carrots a lot.  It was not soggy and it was fresh, seasoned properly and al dente.  It was probably the best dish of the meal that night.  The potatoes were definitely whipped but I wasn't sure if it was the type of potatoes used or if they used too much butter because the potatoes were dark yellow.  Probably a combination of both and there was nothing special about it.For dessert, had chocolate chip cookies, 3 types of ice cream, and 3 types of sorbet.The cookies were relatively soft in the center and crunchy on the outside.  I've had homemade cookies taste better.  I didn't bother trying the ice cream.  The 3 sorbets I had were the mango, lime, and raspberry.  I liked the sorbet except that they were still frozen when they came to the table.  Overall, great wait staff, crappy food.  Only thing I will say in their defense is that perhaps the quality of the food suffered because we had a party of about 25 or so.    However, as a customer, I would assume that they would want to put out their best food because they would want us to spread the word about how great this restaurant was.  I would not come back here.  Dine at your own risk.",3,1,1,Leo O.,"Queens, NY",200,518,1703

The cocktails (tried a Cosmopolitan and some fruity drink, which was the bartender's concoction) were not up to the mark, especially in this price range.  For dessert, we had the creme brûlée, which was definitely much bigger than anticipated!  As you might have guessed, we were stuffed by the end of the meal (I may have also OD'ed on the excellent bread!).Service 4/5Our waiter was very polite, enthusiastic and eager to tend to our requests.  The only hiccup was the long wait to be seated (20 minutes) when we had a reservation, and the restaurant had empty tables.  Ambiance 5/5Very elegant and tasteful; overall, a pleasant dining experience.",3,1,0,Ceres R.,"New York, NY",5,44,45

A fellow conference attendee was in the same boat, so we walked around and decided to try this restaurant for an early dinner. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the atmosphere -- it was pretty quiet and simply but elegantly decorated; I particularly noticed the round mirrors that reminded me of portal windows on a boat.We skipped drinks as I was meeting a friend for some later that evening, but ordered the PEI Mussels as an appetizer. They were good, but by no means the best I've ever had. The sauce was okay. The flat bread they brought out before was actually more interesting for me -- they served it with an interesting butter-fish spread that was salty and rich, and surprisingly delicious!After a very detailed description of some of the favorite dishes from our waiter, my new friend opted for the salmon, and I chose the halibut. We both enjoyed them thoroughly. Mine was flaky and rich with the beurre blanc, simply arranged with two asparagus stalks. My friend's salmon had some sort of grain under it, which we never figured out but we both cleaned our plates.We split some sort of mousse cake for dessert, and were glad we opted to split it since it was a large slice considering the healthy portions of fish we'd just eaten.The prices seemed a little excessive to me, but it's Manhattan and seafood, so maybe they were quite reasonable. The atmosphere declined a little as more parties started to arrive around 6:15, and it got somewhat loud.

Once that table cleared, the atmosphere improved again.The room is beautiful and classy.  Nice warm fire place in the back of the rectangular room.  Really nice ceiling with accented soffits.  Window and doors with a view into a residential courtyard gave it a bit of European feel.   The fresh bread with a white fish spread was delicious.  They should mention the spread is fish. We assumed it was a white bean hummus of sorts until the table behind us inquired.  We were surprised it was fish but it was fantastic so it didn't matter. We had two appetizers.  The jumbo shrimp from the raw bar were amazing.  They were simply huge. They weren't too cold and full of flavor.  The cocktail sauce was spiced perfectly.  We even dipped some bread in the sauce once the shrimp were gone.  The shrimp was garnished with seaweed and fresh (huge) capers.  They added a great, salty spice to the plate.  2nd appetizer was the tuna tar tar, with an olive tampenade and a tomato jam.  The tuna needed nothing with it. It was seasoned perfectly and delicious. However the tampenade and the tomato jam were so good that it only added to the flavor of the dish.  It was garnished with some homemade chips with added a perfect texture to the dish. Main courses didn't disappoint either.  This restaurant isn't trying to reinvent the wheel.  The dishes are classic and expertly prepared.  We had the halibut in a lemon cream sauce, over asparagus with the whipped mashed potatoes.  We also had the red snapper with chimmichuri sauce with the side of lobster mac and cheese.  Both pieces of fish were cooked perfectly.  Crispy skin and the fish flaked way with little effort.  The mashed potatoes were amazing and the lobster mac and cheese was full of lobster, creamy and the cheese was delicious. We were meeting friends and had no time for desert.  However, on the way out the maitre d invited us to have a free after dinner cocktail at the bar.  It was a very nice gesture and the perfect way to end the experience at the restaurant. High marks for food. Even higher marks for service and atmosphere.  Enjoy!",1,0,1,Keith B.,"Dedham, MA",22,67,41

5.0,3/12/2013,"I dined at Sea Fire with my boyfriend, sister and her boyfriend last Saturday night and it was amazing! The chilled lobster salad had to be one of our favorites for sure. We almost didn't even order it but our server was kind enough to recommend. Both the Ribeye and Strip steak were extremely flavorful and the desserts were more than enough. Also they were very attentive to my boyfriend's gltuen free diet, which is always a plus when dining out.

3.0,3/11/2013,"A nice surprise. I would say 3.5stars actually, I don't know if they are worth the full 4 stars. Sea Fire Grill seems to be pretty new to the area and though decor seemed a bit dated and not very hip, our overall experience here was quite good. Servers are in black bowties and it is a white table cloth establishment, but I didn't feel like it was that five star restaurant vibe. Prices are quite steep, but food was prepared quite nicely so that definitely was a plus. The highlight of the meal was the perfectly cooked 2lb lobster that we shared. The meat was sweet and tender and even the non-lobster fans at the table enjoyed it greatly. Everything else was decent as well, but the lobster was definitely the highlight of the meal. Staff was also very friendly and we ended up staying here chatting for over 5 hours. Sure they stopped refilling our water glasses after hour number 3, but they were still friendly enough and left us alone to chat. Overall, it was a good experience, if you are in the area, it is worth a try. I don't know if I would be back since nothing really stood out except the lobster, but I don't have too much bad to say about it as well. I think the staff just needs a bit more finesse if they are trying to give off the white table cloth and 5 star vibe and pull off the 5 star prices. Outside of that, they are off to a good start.",1,0,0,Cynthia M.,"Manhattan, NY",351,1226,25

Our party of eight had a variety of dishes including the oysters, tuna, black sea bass, ribeye steak and chicken -- each with rave reviews.Thank you to the Sea Fire Grill for a wonderful night of celebration!

We were also a bundle of confusion as we were seated. Again, taken in stride by the waitstaff ( and there were a LOT of waitstaff). Every meal was prepared and presented perfectly. Several of us had the Alaskan Halibut ( it was from Alaska, I could tell) others had the swordfish, again perfect!  A few standouts  were the Lobster Mac and cheese and the Brussels sprouts.

I came here Saturday night on a weekend visit with my boyfriend, and we loved everything about The Sea Fire Grill. I have a sharp eye for details and notice the things that set a place apart, and enjoyed every effort here.From the beautifully appointed ladies room to the dining room fireplace to the complimentary aperitif from manager Aron at the end of our meal, we loved the warm, upscale environment and the way everyone served us. The lobster bisque was rich and fulfilling, the halibut tender and delicious (except for a bit too much pepper for my taste which wasn't really worth a mention there since I'm a self-admitted anti-pepper gal.)Topped off by a perfect cappucino and a frangelico courtesy of the manager, we felt like we were in a classic NYC restaurant with impeccable service and food but with all the clean modern touches that make it a ""fresh"" choice.",1,0,2,Erin K.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,89,14

4.0,2/4/2013,"I wanted to give it 5 stars and I would have after the first two menu items that I tried, but several items I tried later were 'fishy' tasting. Having said that my colleague and I absolutely LOVED two particular appetizers: scallops and crab cakes. LOVED them. We decided to create our own 'tasting' menu since the restaurant did not offer one. We ordered the Seafood Sampler, Scallops, Crab Cakes and SFG Salad. The only two items that we agreed that we did not care for were the clams (on half shell) that were included in the Seafood Sampler and the SFG Salad. We realized some time into our meal that the common 'fishy/oceany' taste we had identified was likely the clams since they were the common item we thought tasted un-fresh. We also LOVED the white fish pate that was served with the bread which was also yummy. In fact, my colleague said that if we had stopped after the white fish pate, scallops and crab cakes, he would have given the restaurant a 5 star rating. I agree. Is it worth the visit? Definitely. Their cocktails were also outstanding. If you are looking for a quiet spot to have conversation, I recommend sitting at the bar. We had drinks there while waiting for our table. Once we were seated, the noise level increased. That section would have been great if we had a large, high energy party but not great for quiet conversation. Again - it is worth the visit.

From freshenss to preparation, a seafood lover's dream!  We started out with some tasty West Coast oysters.  I am no oyster conossieur, but I have to say, these were right up there with the best that I have ever had.  For apps we went with the crab cakes and tuna tartare.  Both were delicious and the texture of the crab cake was perfect!  For entrees, the Black Sea Bass and Crab legs.   DEEEE-LICIOUS!  There were several steak cuts on the menu, but I get my fill at their sister restaurant Benjamin's Steakhouse.  I did see someone do a surf and turf combo and the porterhouse looked just as delicious as the seafood.The service was top notch.  Exactly what has come to be expected of any restaurant that the owners (Ben and Benjamin) are affilliated with.Look out Oceana and the rest, there is a new sheriff in town when it comes to seafood.Kudos Ben and Benjamin, you have done it again!",4,2,1,Jason B.,"White Plains, NY",32,36,0
5.0,1/13/2013,"When I found out the team behind Benjamin Steakhouse, one of my favorite restaurants, was opening a new seafood place, I got very excited and couldn't wait to try it.Made a reservation for Friday night and I am happy to report that it did not disappoint. Loved everything about it!The Place: Upon entering you will notice soft blue lighting (to resemble the blue sea water, I presume) which is very easy on the eyes, soothing and, yes,... flattering! It also has this round mirrors that project the same soft blue light, and ceiling fixtures that resemble ships' portholes. Table cloth lined tables with beautiful chairs complete the look. The place was full by 8pm and you can definitely hear the volume in conversations, but it is not so overpowering that detracts from the overall experience.Looking around I got the impression that there were lots of ""locals"" already, which is always a good sign.The People: when we arrived we were greeted by a gracious hostess and escorted to a table between the bar and the main dining room (a diner in our party had mobility issues and, although it is only 2 little steps down to the main dining room, we appreciated their noticing and offering that table as an alternative which we gladly accepted)It was nice to see Benjamin there (whom I know from having been to his other restaurant) and also met Jason, amazing wine sommelier who told me about they have over 500 different wines, and Aaron (sp), one of the restaurant managers who were gracious hosts throughout the night.The waiters worked seamlessly and paid attention to detail: water/wine refills, napkin folding, bread... The food: DELICIOUS!I was expecting a copy of Benjamin Steakhouse and I was so pleasantly surprised that IT IS NOT.It is an upscale Seafood Restaurant that also has very good steaks.We ordered oysters, crab cake and mussels for appetizers. Lobster and bone-in filet mignon for the main course with creamed spinach, asparagus and hash browns for sides.The oysters were perfect with the sauces provided; the mussels were medium size but ""meaty"". I didn't have great expectations for the crab cakes since I only found a few places where they were made well but what a surprise: I think it was the best of all the appetizers.The (huge) boiled lobster was sweet and cooked to perfection as was the filet mignon.I can't say much about desserts since we had no room left for it but we ordered a crème brule which was very tasty.Experience: AMAZING!",1,0,0,xoan s.,"New York, NY",0,5,0

5.0,12/8/2012,"I came here with a girlfriend for dinner the first week they opened. As avid fans of Benjamin Steakhouse, we were excited to try the sister restaurant's surf-based menu. We were not only impressed, but floored by the across-the-board level of quality apparent in every facet of our meal at Sea Fire. We got there late, close to closing, and fully expected to be hurried along by the waitstaff. To our delight, they were not only patient throughout our (somewhat indulgent) three course meal, but were exceptionally attentive to our needs despite the hour. The breakdown:We started with the wine menu, and knowing we'd be eating mostly fish, chose a moderately priced sparkling Cava. It was bright and crisp and delicious, but with the beautiful selection of wine available I might never order the same bottle twice. (There's even a private wine room!) To start we had a selection of 1/2 dozen oysters followed by pan seared scallops, both unbelievably fresh and beautifully presented. Do not miss the Kumamoto oysters if they're on the menu! The scallops were crispy and yummy and served with perfectly roasted potatoes. To give you an idea of how good everything was, our sole point of disagreement was over the decorative almonds on the scallop appetizer (I appreciated the contrasting buttery, nutty crunch to the succulent scallops, my friend thought they distracted). For entrees we decided on one surf and one turf: she choosing the in-house-dry-aged Filet Mignon with a side of lobster truffle mac n' cheese, and I the swordfish with roast mushrooms. Again, WOW. The steak was in the top tier of best-steaks-of-my life and left our mouths begging for an equally exceptional bottle of red. One good move on our part was ordering it medium rare and charred. The dry-aging added so much depth that I found myself chewing with my eyes closed to savor the complexity...I cannot rave enough. The last reviewer got the mac n' cheese right, too- the ingredients speak for themselves- you should come just for this! Together they might have been too rich for me to tackle solo, a few bites were amazing but I might have chosen the mushrooms, equally delicious but more manageable. My swordfish was as fresh as our appetizers and melted off the fork in my mouth but I'm afraid to say it was simply outshone by the steak. Every bite was savored, and it certainly complimented our Cava more appropriately, but I would have found it even more exceptional if I had stayed focused on the lighter, more subtle seafood flavors instead of spoiling my palate with interspersed bites of the rich, dark steak. By the end of it, we were much too full to even consider dessert, but we will certainly be back to indulge very soon! The whole vibe- lighting, mirrors, table settings- is so chill we are plotting to drag some friends over for holiday drinks, appetizers, and dessert at the bar.",1,0,0,Victoria S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0
4.0,12/1/2012,"First to review! Woooo! I had the tasting menu when I came here so was able to sample quite a bit from the menu. Here is a breakdown of what I tried:East Coast Oysters: Topped with caviar these babies tasted like they were brought in directly from the ocean, soaked in salt water and all. Not my thing but if you like oysters I'm sure you would enjoy these. Also, note to everyone out there. Do not chew oysters!Raw Montauk Fluke: This was very delicious. I thought the citrus complimented the flavors of the fish very well. Atlantic Halibut: Tasted clean and fresh enough but wasn't a standout. I believe it was cooked in a white wine sauce. American Red Snapper: Very good, Crispy skin but flaky inside. Tasted wonderful with the spinach and vegetables. Lobster Mac and Cheese: Have this when you come here. That's all. You're welcome. Creme Brulee: Absolutely indulgent. I'm a sugar lover so I especially enjoyed this dish. The creme is butterscotch flavored! The ambiance tries hard to be that cool New York scene, but come on, we're in Midtown who are we fooling? Much of the furniture is white and the lighting is dim with blue fluorescent accents. I took off a star for the service. It left a little to be desired. They seemed to be confused. I will give them slack on this since the place just opened but hope they get a better flow going within the next few weeks or so..",5,0,1,Irm M.,"Manhattan, NY",782,319,21
