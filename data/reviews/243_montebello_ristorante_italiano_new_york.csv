4.0,6/26/2018,What a great surprise!! Fresh pasta was perfect. Ravioli!! Caesar for two was more like Caesar for three . Fish was fresh and cooked to perfection as well. We stumbled upon this gem on our first night in Manhattan this year. The only issue was a less than amazing wine list. But we found a great Barolo and the cocktails didn't disappoint either. Service was excellent and friendly with great atmosphere. Fernando - you were.....perfect! Thanks!,0,0,0,Dale W.,"Sunriver, OR",276,8,0
1.0,2/14/2018,"Huge ripoff. I attached a picture of my bill. I arrived with business guests for lunch and they seated us with regular dinner menus, no mention of their lunch specials. Apparently, one of my guests knew that you had to ask for the lunch special menu, like it's some secret. One of the guests ordered off the regular menu as he didn't like anything on the lunch specials. Apparently a bowl of lentil soup costs $18.75 and a salad with grilled chicken is $32. Also, we had 3 diet cokes and 1 iced tea...that cost $35.50. Restaurants like this know they are dying off and wont be around much longer so they choose instead to rip off their customers. By the way, food wasn't anything special. Avoid!",1,1,0,Carl C.,"Manhattan, NY",2,7,1

4.0,2/2/2017,"Came here for restaurant week (winter 17). I must say that I really enjoyed myself. The staff were truly attentive to our needs and helped whenever necessary. We got two glasses of Malbec to start and had delicious fresh Italian bread with dipping oil. For appetizers we got the bufala and the eggplant parm(melanzane) both of which exceeded our expectations. For my main, I got the linguine with little neck clams. I really enjoyed the dish. My friend got the pollo montobello which I got to try as well. This dish had an excellent lemon/Parmesan crust. For dessert we got the cheesecake and the chocolate cake.

4.0,11/28/2016,"My friend and I found this restaurant while walking one evening on the upper east side looking for a new place to dine.  Montebello fits the bill if you are looking for a quintessential independently owned Italian NYC restaurant where you can count on getting a table.  Our service was excellent, warm, friendly and accommodating.  The server encouraged me to customize my salciccia dish to my specific preferences and it was fabulous!  From the wine, bread basket to dessert, we left very happy and satisfied.  To me, since I live in Colorado, I have high expectations for every meal I get to eat in NYC where the bar is especially high.  I can't wait to go back!

Also friend the chicken montebello,( pan coated with Parmesan cheese ) I hope that what it is called? The chicken was so moist and the wine sauce it came with was awesome too.

2.0,8/27/2016,"We have been regulars at Montebello for at least 6 years.  The food has always been excellent, although we have been concerned that the prices seem to  go up each time we eat there.  However the quality of the food and service has always brought us back.  This was the first time we went on a Saturday night, and the place was nearly empty.  The few staff people that were there were attentive, but the food, although certainly edible, was definitely not the best.  Vegetables were soggy and drowning in sauce, sauce for the rigatoni was not the flavorful one that we have had, and the ricotta cheese cake was dry.  Since they're not open on Sunday, maybe Saturday night is their time to clear out leftovers!  Definitely unacceptable, especially at those prices!!",1,0,0,Vivian O.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,0
3.0,5/25/2016,"A few of us were staying across the street at The Lombardy and decided to come try this inviting Italian restaurant only a few steps away. The Saturday evening was unexpectedly quiet and only a few tables were occupied when we entered the premises. Warm and friendly servers greeted us and we were immediately seated. The decor was simple and the lighting provided a comfortable setting. We were given a basket filled with three kinds of house made bread and some olive oil. The bread was not warm as it reached our table but nonetheless we devoured it. After perusing the menu, the tagliolini (sea scallops, shrimp, mussels, & clams served with garlic, olive oil, & herbs) was my choice out of several pastas, carni, insalate, pesci, and more. My dining partners ordered the pollo montebello  (parmesan encrusted breast of chicken in a white wine lemon sauce) and the milanese (pounded and breaded veal chop with baby arugula, red onion, & cherry tomatoes). The tagliolini was to die for! Pasta was made very well and the seafood was proportional to the amount of pasta, and all without the hassle of removing shells and tails. Our server said that it was one of his favorite dishes. The chicken and veal dishes were reported to me as well done and flavorful. We had other after dinner plans so we did not try the coffees or desserts but wow, they had a whole dessert cart to show us...talk about temptations! Montebello is a good option for those seeking simple Italian fare in the Midtown East area given the proximity to Columbus Circle / Central Park. The location is not very visible and it isn't a bustling place  but I can see that hotel guests, businessmen/women and a few others enjoy this place.",2,0,1,Vicky L.,"Houston, TX",159,566,4750

It is the perfect place to go to relax, unwind and enjoy a meal in a calm, friendly and comforting atmosphere.Try the ministrone or, if available as a special, the lentil soup.  For an entree the veal Milanese, pork loin, and sausages with peppers are excellent as is the Pollo Montebello or any of the fish dishes.",1,0,0,Carl F.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0

We had such a wonderful experience there. We reserved the private room for our party of 18 people on Christmas Eve, and from the moment we walked in, we were treated like royalty. We had at least 2 waiters at all times that were dedicated just to our group, and they were so wonderful about explaining items on the menu to us, allowing us to customize orders, making sure our wine glasses were never empty - just such wonderful service (especially given that we were there on Christmas Eve!).

4.0,7/28/2015,"Montebello reminds me of places I went with my grandparents when I was young- think old world charm, white linen table cloths, very classic. There is nothing trendy or edgy about this place, and today the nostalgia was much appreciated. We stopped in at 4pm for a really late lunch/early dinner. Since we went at such an awkward time, the place was empty minus one table of 4 businessmen finishing up in the front. No complaints, we were just happy they were open between the lunch and dinner times. There is a smallish bar then plenty of seating in the back room. We were seated in a roomy booth and our server immediately brought us water which was fantastic because it was HOT outside today. Some bread came out- there was a lot of selection. Could have been slightly better if it was warm, but was decent enough. We were ready to order quickly and chose the carpaccio to start and 2 gnocchi dishes- one in a meat sauce and spinach gnocchi in a truffle parmesan cream sauce. The carpaccio came out fast. The portion was really small compared to other versions of the same dish at comparable places. The meat had started to turn slightly dark around the edges when it should be red throughout. Was just fair, at best, and would not order again. The food arrived quickly. Both pasta plates were SO SO SO GOOD, the spinach/truffle gnocchi in particular. The white sauce of my gnocchi was one of the best things I've enjoyed in a while. Sometimes places include truffle in the description and you can barely taste it. Not here. It is not overwhelming, just super wonderful.  I could only finish about half, but boyfriend polished off all of his gnocchi in the meat ragout. I  tried some and thought it was nice, but not as good as mine. He agreed while both were good, mine was spectacular. Because we had to return to work, we did not order drinks. Total bill came to $80 pre tax/tip which seemed just a  little high for what it was, but this is Midtown East...it's somewhat expected and most people are probably expensing the tab anyway. The service was 110% on point throughout. Our server was a super nice guy that kept our water filled to the brim without us noticing, and when I took my gnocchi to go, he had no problem having the kitchen whip up a bit more sauce to throw on my pasta so I could reheat at home. Despite the slightly higher prices, this is a place I would definitely return for their pasta. I eyeballed some porcini mushroom risotto on the menu for next time.",1,0,1,Tracy T.,"Manhattan, NY",2,60,10
4.0,4/15/2015,"I have been to this restaurant many times for business lunches. The food has always been consistently good, plus the service is always attentive and very efficient. To me this is very important because, if you are trying to efficiently manage your time while also remaining focused on your business agenda, you do not want the distraction of worrying about delayed service or having to address any issues about your dish.Overall, this is a great place to dine because their menu offers a lot of options, their food is very good and their service is very friendly and efficient.",0,0,0,I Corona D.,"New Hyde Park, NY",2,27,17

2.0,1/19/2015,So let me say we went here with a large group which you can expect your hot portions to experience sometime under the heat lamps.We had a pre-fixed menu with a few options for each part of the meal.Appetizer - I had the smoked salmon.  Pretty solidPasta - skipped the pasta tasting as daddy is trying to become a lean mean consulting machine.  Can't do carbs past lunchMain - I went with the non-breaded veal with mushrooms and artichokes.  The veal was drowning in sauce which took away a bit from the meat.  Desert - see my rationale for skipping this course based on the pasta course description.  Trying to shed lbsService - the service was really great for our group.  The staff was very attentiveAll the other people around me seemed to walk away thinking the meal was good so maybe skipping the Pasta and Desert courses cheapened my experience but I doubt I would ever go back here again personally.,0,0,0,Chris S.,"Orlando, FL",91,291,16

1.0,5/21/2014,"Gordon Ramsey, please come and save this place!!Montebello has two main types of customers: 1) Really old people who live nearby who have lost all sense of taste and only know salt & sugar sensations and 2) People from out of town who did not know this place was so bad. I ordered a $29 pork tenderloin called ""Filetto"" that was tougher than leather. The meat was pre-sliced and so dried out that it felt dusty in my mouth. This meat must have been cooked three days prior and microwaved more than once. The sauce came from a powdered packet because there were some dry powder bubbles and the spinach was unwashed and was gritty from dirt.I mean, you couldn't have prepared this entree any worse if you tried. I had the mussels appetizer also and they tasted soapy.The desserts sit out in the dining area on a little rolly cart for everyone to touch and sneeze on throughout the day. Both the chocolate mousse cake and the cheese cake were dried out and didn't resemble any kind of moist, delicious property these types of cakes are supposed to have.On top of that, your waiter has prison gang tattoos on his hands, which i guess is kinda cool.This place is terrible and either needs to be put down like a old, sick animal or it needs the expertise of an outside expert like Gordon Ramsey to convince the cooks that they have lost the art of food preparation.",4,3,0,Tronix W.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,31,3

1.0,10/22/2013,"Thumbs down all around. Bread is stale and comes out cold. Bread sticks were okay, the only thing I really ate here that wasn't crappy. Not many options for vegetarians. 95% of their pasta dishes have meat in them. I ended up ordering a salad and penne.The arugula salad had great cheese, but the pears were not ripe and the arugula was drenched in oil. Serving size was TEENSY; I think it was $14 for that salad? And you got enough greens the size of my fist, which is not that much.Pasta... It was a simple garlic, oil, basil, and tomato dish. Literally one of TWO things I could have eaten. There was about an inch of oil in the bottom of my bowl. They cooked the pasta well, but overall, the dish was boring and there was WAY too much oil. I had about half the pasta and had to stop because I grew so nauseous eating that garbage. For a $20+ dish, you'd think it would be less like a five year old made it, and would actually be worth its price. Nope.Didn't bother with dessert. My uncle enjoyed the cannoli, said everything else was so-so. He's the one who paid, so he wins the award for restaurant research fail.Mediocre and overpriced.

Traditional American Italian dishes like veal ragu paparadella, chicken scalopini, veal parm were filling but nothing out of the ball park except for the prices. The decor was pretty 80's and needed a face lift as its as dated as Jennifer Marlowe. The novelty (the reason for the extra star) of the place was the Mexican wait staff trying to come off as Luigi from Naples speaking in faux Italian accents. i can see this place somewhere in the sticks but not midtown Manhattan.However, that being said my colleagues and the gratitude for a job well done made the evening more than bearable.

So we booked through opentable. Everything was fine until I got my salmon dish. I asked for a med-rare but got med-well instead with half side burnt. I felt considerate to send it back as I knew it would be wasting time and food.  We ordered a small side order of spaghetti.  I was shocked when the bill came. They charged $ 18 for  just  a half portion!! Also, we chose cheesecake and chocolate mouse for desserts. We were disappointed when the cakes came with very thin slice and nothing special. I guess it's better to order from regular menu as it's not worth it to order from restaurant week prix fixe menu for $38 each. Nevertheless, our real bad experience came at the end when we saw they charged $6 for the soda. I ordered black label on the rocks with a side of soda. The drink itself is $16,expensive enough and the soda should be included. No other place will charge for the soda on the side. When we asked the server why he charged for the soda, he said because you ordered the soda. We said that wasn't right and it should be removed from the bill. He came back after swiped credit without correcting the price. We were so mad and talked to the manager when we left. Obviously he didn't know what was going on. The server should have asked him about the soda ,we would appreciate more.

2.0,12/21/2012,"I met some friends for dinner on a weeknight.  Before I went I checked their website and saw they have a $35 three course prix fixe menu.  The same menu was posted outside the restaurant.  When I sat down and asked for that menu, the waiter expressed puzzlement and indifference (if it's possible to do that simultaneously), went to check, and came back to announce that menu is not available in December.  You must be joking.  So we ordered off the menu and I was underwhelmed.  The bread basket looked like they had gone to the local grocery store and pulled some bread and rolls off the shelf.  The buffalo mozzarella and tomato appetizer had mushy mozzarella and tasteless tomatoes.  They didn't even bother to drizzle olive oil over the dish.  My lobster ravioli main course was a bit better but the lobster was a few tough morsels in the middle of the plate.After they figured out we didn't want desert the waiter went AWOL and our glasses were never refilled, he never stopped back to see if we needed anything.  Bill for 3 people for appetizer and main course and a moderately priced bottle of wine:  $280 including tip.  That's $93/person.  And watch out for the extras:  a bottle of Pellegrino cost $11.  The diners were mostly an older crowd.  Some were eating by themselves so they might be regulars or maybe from nearby hotels.  The place does have kind of a neighborhood restaurant kind of feel but I wouldn't come back to spend this kind of money for this kind of food.  NYC is expensive but you can definitely find better Italian food, and better service, for that kind of money.",1,0,0,Dave L.,"New York, NY",32,361,10

It had a nice lemon flavor to it. To end it, I had the Crem Caramel (flan) for dessert. It had a very strong caramel taste, but it gave the flan a very unique taste, and I thought it was very good.Some of the waiters were very rude here.

3.0,1/31/2012,"My boyfriend and I decided to try out Montebello during restaurant week. When we got there, our coats were taken and we were immediately led to our seats. We were brought the menus and the wine list. My boyfriend and I aren't big drinkers, and Montebllo sells mostly by the bottle, but an entire bottle of wine would have been WAY too much for us. We chose not to get wine, which MAY have been the reason the service went downhill from there. The kitchen knows how to cook. The appetizers and entrees were excellent. Our desserts left a little to be desired. The cake was okay, but nothing special. It didn't taste like it was made on premises. But food-wise we were satisfied. However, service-was, it left a lot to be desired. In an upscale establishment like Montebello, I would expect my water glass to be filled... and an attentive server. Our server had a habit of disappearing and taking forever to reappear - to the point where other servers actually brought our plates. We had to flag our server down a couple of times just for water! My boyfriend thought that because we didn't order alcohol and/or we ordered off the pre-fixe menu that we may not have gotten the best service, because they figured we wouldn't be spending that much. I did consider leaving a crappy tip, but decided to leave an awesome tip instead, with the hopes that, if our server was crappy because he thought we'd be cheap, he'd realize just because we're not the ""normal"" crowd, doesn't mean we tip bad. I'd definitely be willing to order out from here. But they really need to step it up on the service - except on the coat check girl, who was super nice and friendly. Actually, the coat check girl should start waiting tables. She seems like she would do WAY better.",4,1,1,Tova B.,"Jersey City, NJ",96,358,460

Montebellos was walking distance from the Waldorf Astoria where we were staying, so we decided to go there. The restaurant  looked nice with a fairly intimate setting so we figured it would be a good relaxing choice. We didn't count on a waiter that was rude and nasty. We were seated and brought food menus and a basket of bread. The waiter came by and asked if we wanted drinks and we asked if there was a wine list. He acted annoyed that we asked and replied, ""We only sell wine by the bottle"" . We again requested a wine list which he begrudgingly brought to us. We ordered drinks and had each taken a piece  of bread since we hadn't eaten all day due to the accident. The waiter reappeared and started yelling at us for getting bread crumbs on the menu. He whisked the piece of paper into the air and declared for all to hear, ""Now I am going to have to change this!"" We ended up each getting some pasta and no other sides or dessert-just to eat and get out.

3.0,8/25/2011,"We chose this place because it was convenient for us and the couple we were having dinner with.  We were also looking to capitalize on extended Restaurant Week.  And as far as cuisine, Italian is always a safe choice.There's a wine list for bottles but glasses weren't listed, so you're forced to guess (or ask) the prices, vineyards, and vintages of their house selections. (As it would turn out, glasses were $11 apiece, which, if I had known, I would have stopped at 1; Peroni bottles were $8.50.)The RW menu had 7 appetizer choices and 8 entrees, but nothing in particular stood out.  I went with eggplant parm for an appetizer; a lemon-parmesan chicken dish for an entree, which was tasty, but didn't blow me away; and the Italian cheesecake for dessert, which was good (I also shared my gf's lemon sherbet, which was very nice).If you're like me and can't afford to drop $135 on a meal for two more than once or twice a year, I wouldn't recommend Montebello.  The food wasn't particularly imaginative, the service wasn't anything special, and the atmosphere (albeit on a Wed night) was a non-factor.  There's nothing wrong with an ""A-OK"" restaurant, but I was looking for something a little better than what I got.(Note: I was served a house sauvignon blanc when I'd ordered a pinot noir; they replaced it quickly, no harm done.  Then, one of my friends received the wrong entree but was promised her correct meal would be out ""in four minutes.""  It came out in about 10 minutes, but the waiter compensated her with a free second glass of wine.)",1,0,0,bobby c.,"Arlington, VA",67,65,0

3.0,2/8/2010,"Every year my office goes out to eat Italian for the holiday party. Last year's dinner was at Montebello Ristorante Italiano where we had the private room in the back for about 11 people. The room was fit for twenty. In fact the room was so large we started comparing it to our office and apartments. We had two attendants at all times and the food paced out well.I came in late and was not offered wine even though our table already had two bottles open. I thought that was strange. Later on I was able to get a glass right before the main course.For starters we had a salad and trio of pasta plate. The pasta plate had penne (tomato sauce, garlic, and Portobello mushrooms), seafood risotto, and bowtie pasta with pesto. The penne was al dente, the seafood risotto was very strong, and the bowtie pasta was ordinary. The penne and pesto pasta were the hits. I actually liked the risotto. It was very fresh with big pieces of shrimp. If fishy dishes are not for you, then I'd recommend staying away from the risotto. The penne was pretty good. Overall the trio of pasta was a nice sampler and the salad was nice and crisp.The two appetizer courses were very filling but the entrees are not to be missed. So if you come here for a banquet dinner, try to save room for the main meal. We were offered salmon, chicken, and veal. The majority of the room got the chicken and veal. It's hard to say which of the two was the best. It just depends on your preference of meat. They were both excellent and finished faster than the pastas and salads. The chicken breast was parmesan encrusted in a white wine lemon sauce. The veal was thinly sliced with a white wine reduction, mushrooms and artichokes. The dishes came with a side of mystery vegetable. We guessed it was bok choy. The veal was amazing. It was soft and the gravy was the perfect compliment. If you ever come to Montebello, get the veal! The dishes are ample servings as well. Dessert was less memorable but very much appreciated. We had a choice of cheesecake or chocolate mousse cake. I just remember the mousse cake as being very rich.Overall my office favored Montebello. The food was good but I just found it to be not an exciting place for a holiday party. I found the restaurant grim and every 10 minutes we'd feel the room vibrate. We had no idea what it was (club next door, subway, heater?) and everyone said it wasn't their cell phone.
