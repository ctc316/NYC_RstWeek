5.0,4/28/2019,"About a month after a trip to Greece, I started missing authentic Greek food, and I had heard good things about this restaurant, so I wanted to give it a try. We made a reservation for 10pm on a Friday night to take advantage of the $49 prix-fixe menu (served after 9:30pm), and it was still very busy at that time of night! The restaurant officially closes at 11:30pm, and we ended up staying until about 11:40 (there were still many other tables that had guests). We arrived at 10pm but had to wait ~12 minutes for our table to be set up. There's a bar to the left of the entrance where you can have drinks while you're waiting. The restaurant is actually quite large--there is an upper level (and I believe I saw stairs to a lower level as well). We were seated close to the windows on the main level. We did have to specifically request the late night menu from the waiter. I ordered the grilled octopus, the sea bream, and the walnut cake w/ honey lavender ice cream. Greek salad is also served family-style. I paired this with a glass of Assyrtiko, a delicious white wine from Santorini. We also received bread and olive oil to start. The octopus was presented on top of yellow split pea fava, which was reminiscent of hummus. This was my favorite dish out of the entire meal--the octopus was cooked and seasoned perfectly. My friend ordered the Greek spread to start, and although it was also delicious, the pita to spread ratio was very uneven (6 small pieces of pita to three large portions of spreads). Compared to when I had sea bream in Greece, the presentation of this fish was better, but it was a bit overcooked and therefore tough to chew. I did steal a bite of my friend's lamb chops, and that was so so tasty (definitely getting that dish next time). The Greek salad (comes with onions, green peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, and feta cheese) was also a nice compliment to our entrees--the bowl was small, but the portion size was actually quite good and we were left feeling very full. The Karydopita was a nice dessert that closed out the entire meal well. The walnut cake wasn't that extraordinary, but the ice cream was actually quite good (light and refreshing). In terms of service, we weren't too impressed by our waiter, but I'll owe it to how late it was, so he must have been tired, but he kept on interrupting us as we tried to order by talking to his colleagues. He also forgot to place the order for the Greek salad. That being said, I would still love to return for lunch, and I would recommend the late night prix-fixe!",1,0,0,Tiffany L.,"New York, NY",351,140,223
5.0,4/23/2019,"By far one of the best Greek restaurants I've been to in NYC. The Greek salad is so delicious, I've never tasted tomatoes so sweet and fresh. The lobster was cooked to perfection.

4.0,4/20/2019,More like 4.5! Food was wonderful and service very friendly. We ordered from the lunch menu (3 courses for $32). I had the grilled octopus to start which was great! I have been to Milos Island in Greece and had the same dish there - the one I had at this restaurant was better!! I had the lamb for main course which did not disappoint.  The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star review is because of the atmosphere or lack there of.. there was no back ground music so the place was filled with the sound of clashing plates like in a cafeteria. Made the experience a little less enjoyable than it could have been.Bottom line - go for the food!,0,0,0,Natasha O.,"New York, NY",0,25,4
3.0,4/12/2019,"Yes, the food here is delicious. However, nothing is particularly outstanding. I truly think this place is extremely overpriced. I love fine dining and I don't mind paying more for a great meal. However, this was not worth the value. My sea bass was delicious and I had two glasses of white wine with no sides. Four of us shared two appetizers and some fries and the bill was over $500. Definitely not worth the hype. Great ambiance though. My group definitely felt rushed to leave our table.",4,2,2,Barbara L.,"Nassau County, NY",57,125,1148
1.0,4/8/2019,"I read a review about this restaurant. It said how picky the owner was about selecting food for the restaurant. He should be more attentive to the service as well. There are so many waiters, captains, busboys milling around, but doing nothing. Just looking!Let me start out by saying the food was excellent but everything else was awful. We arrived At 5:20 and were seated promptly. However we were in a crossroads and constantly disturbed by an endless parade of people. We ordered drinks and the Greek spreads (cold dish). The drink's came right away but the spreads did not show up until after six. The menu says food is portioned to share. However it is portioned to share easily for four!  We asked for more pita. They waiter walked back and forth and never brought it. We had to ask the busboy. The fish, at $60 per pound were all too large for two people. We had no choice but to order the fish, and vegetables that would serve 3-4. AND the food didn't materialize initial 7PM!  A captain came by and asked how everything was. I said the service was terrible but I wanted to eat my food and talk later. He said he would return, but never did. I ordered tea. Sugar or honey? Honey please. I'm still waiting. Then two deserts were brought to the table. Complimentary. However, due to dietary restrictions I could eat neither- nuts and raw fruit. If they want to make amends, ask what you would like!Long story short: if you want a good fish dinner for basically the same hefty price,Go to Le Bernardin. The atmosphere is lovely-you can hear the others at your table. The fish is perfect and the service outstanding. Avoid this place!",0,0,0,Patti D.,"Dayton, OH",0,8,1
4.0,4/7/2019,"Girlfriend and I decided to try the new Hudson Yards yesterday and were not disappointed.  To start, it's on 5th floor with the perfect view of the vessel right outside the window.  We tried to get s window seat but would've had to wait longer so we settled for a seat a little further away.  Not a big deal, they have an outdoor patio you can go outside to take pictures afterward anyway.  The atmosphere and decoration were clean, bright, and modern and the food was delicious.  We had the $32 price fix menu which was a real bargain.  They have a ton of staff but could probably be a tiny bit more organized.  Regardless, a very pleasurable afternoon experience with an amazing view!",0,0,0,Garrett D.,"Jersey City, NJ",3,66,5
2.0,4/4/2019,"Bad service: was there this week for a private event. The waiters were all so clumsy that they spilled a whole plate of tzatziki on my suit; they did not even offer an apology, even less to cover the dry cleaning.

3.0,4/1/2019,"I consider this a composite review of their new Hudson Yards location:- Food: 5 (fresh food, delicious octopus and crab, but the fish was dry)- Ambiance: 4.5 (fun, packed atmosphere)- Service: 3 overall ... with great support staff (such as the lady who took care of our jackets), the maî·tre d' and waiter were polite but aloof, and some portions of our meal (i.e., side salad) came way after the main meal and the waiter needed to be reminded a couple of times to check on it- Value: 1 (the tab for 7 of us was over $900 ... this included two shared meals; we all felt it was a solid $500 kind of meal).Would we come back?  Probably not - so much fantastic food at better value in NYC to try.",1,0,0,TJ W.,"Danville, CA",0,101,1
1.0,3/28/2019,Let me start by saying that this visit I was at a private function so I didn't pay. I arrived to the private room sat down other people had already gathered. After the usual exchange of pleasantries I asked the waiter for a glass of red wine (Since someone else was paying the choices were limited to beer or wine).  I never received the wine I asked again and again was ignored. The entrées were pre-ordered. The plate consisted of a piece of fish and a single lamb chop. When the waiter brought my plate I asked him to remove the lamb chop since I do not eat meat. That was the last I saw of any food. At some point some waiter came back having noticed that I had no food while everyone else was eating and attempted to be solicitous. He wanted to bring me some food and I told him that he could eat it.  I was no longer hungry uncomfortable since I was the only one at the table not eating and in general not in good humor from the lack of any service at this restaurant.  I have been A paying customer at this establishment several times and I will also say that the last visit where I paid a lot of my hard earned money the service and food were lackluster as well. Perhaps the owner has opened too many restaurants in too short of time. My advice is to think twice before going. I think the place has devolved into a corporate expense account establishment.,0,0,0,Stuart K.,"Bronx, NY",0,17,0
4.0,3/28/2019,"Craving something new, my fiancé and I decided to try out Estiatorio Milos for our Friday lunch! We were planning to get dessert and try out different foods from various places in Hudson Yards, so we knew we were going to order smaller portions here. As we came here around noon on Friday, Estiatorio Milos was dripping in gold, white, and brown decor adding a classy vibe to the restaurant. Not many people were present, which made it easier to have a more intimate date here. We ended up ordering some pita with a cod roe and olive oil spread, a gyro with pork, and 2 scallops with some vegetables.The pita ended up being HEAVENLY! The pita was so soft, although with the cod roe spread, it made it all the better! The spread tasted fishy, but it was also very smooth and significant olive oil flavors! The waiter even gave us more pita, as he noticed how much we enjoyed it!The gyro was also soft, and it was overflowing with pork and vegetables! It was a bit difficult to hold up, so we ended up just using a knife and fork to cut ourselves some slices. Given the classiness of the atmosphere, I guess that is more appropriate than biting into the gyro and having all the contents spill out, although I would have loved to be able to bite into it (without making a mess). The scallops were skewered with some vegetables. They were presented on a moderate sized plate, but large relative to the scallops. The vegetables were grilled and mostly okay, but the scallops were flavorless and boring. My fiancé enjoyed how soft they were, but I found them dull. $10 for two fat scallops and some vegetables is too overpriced for me! Overall a great experience and all this ended up costing $22! I would love to come back here again and try the different foods as well as order more pita and spread!",0,0,1,Liselle L.,"New York, NY",329,188,334
4.0,3/24/2019,"This review for the prix fixe at the fancy new Hudson Yards location. - Great value $35 3-course lunch available SEVEN DAYS. I hope it's not just an opening special and they keep it up. Basically, it's simple, fresh Greek food served a bit nicer than normal and in a glitzy setting, with well trained staff - Olive oil and toasted bread was accompanied by oregano snipped from growing plant in a flower pot / nice touch, eat it while warm - Cold octopus on a bed of dip / nice, though IMO chargrilled octo is always better served sizzling HOT - Calamari fried in a fairly standard light batter with a slightly mismatched tomato bruschetta / I would have preferred a much finer batter (like the way we Asians do salt & pepper squid) and bigger, juicier rings. Why not just a nice big chunk? - Grilled bream with broccoli: tasty, but having worked in a fine dining kitchen myself, SERVERS AND MENU SHOULD ALERT PATRONS THIS IS SERVED BONE-IN AND HEAD ON - I can just see someone choking and creating a very unpalatable scene. I spotted a server having to manually plate the meat for a patron who I hallucinated had a visceral reaction to the glazed stare of the ex-fish - Desserts were fair / walnut cake overly sweet and unremarkable. The yogurt is more impressive and I'd recommend getting it at the downstairs cafe with the divine candied orange peel ($6) All in all, great value with a great view of the Vessel, Hudson River, et al. At this price you could come here once a week as a brunchtime treat.Make sure you reserve - it's insanely popular. Get the first seating - 11.45am for noon and request a table with a view. In these early days before it becomes a celeb fave you will get it.",0,0,0,Lynette C.,"New York, NY",22,102,62
4.0,3/22/2019,"Looking for a fine dining experience with affordable price?Try out Estiatorio Milos's $32 Prix-fixe Lunch Menu!The very next day after the grand opening of Hudson Yards - NY, I made a reservation for three people at estiatorio milos.It was SUPER crowded by the entrance with the people in-line. However, I was able to get seated right away (The power of reservation! Whoop Whoop).Prix-fixe menu was only $32 per person.We all ordered a glass of wine (Rose and white wine).They first served us with a bag of bread with olive oils.For our appetizer, we ordered*Oyster - 6 pieces*Grilled OctopusFried CalamariI was very impressed with the grilled octopus (I LOVE octopus). It was cooked just right.Fried calamari was also delicious but nothing special about it. The 6 pieces of oysters were well presented and were FRESH.For entree, we orderedTuna BurgerSalmon Tartar*Grilled fish with lemon and capersTuna burger served with fried skinny zucchini (Although I was eating fried food, I felt somehow healthy).Salmon tartare was served with fries. I felt like it needed something acidic (Capers or lemon).Grilled fish was my favorite. Capers and lemon made the fish taste extra FRESH!For our happy ending dessert, we all ordered karydopita (Gree dessert cake made from walnuts) with vanilla ice creamI was too full by the time dessert was served. Karydopita was soft and sweet. Icecream was doing its job (DELICIOUS).*Recommended DishOverall, if you LOVE fresh seafood. You must try this place!

5.0,3/17/2019,"We went to Hudson yards on opening day and thought we'd be able to get a nice brunch out of the trip. Not sure what we were thinking acting like tourists. In any case Milos had mercy with us and squeezes us into the bar area onto a tiny table and could not have been nicer. Our waitress Carolina was absolutely amazing. Endlessly and with a smile went over the menu over and over again. Only about 8 of the 25 items were available. She did her best to make us happy. I'm vegan non of the items were plantbased... lol. She then tried to get us a table upstairs in the dining room which featured a three course menu with better options, talked to her manager even - but no such luck. The entire place had of course been booked for weeks. Then the manager came over himself and offered to have a special Greek salad made for me- no cheese. Yes please.My friends had all of the Greek spreads and some of the raw fish, small portions but they loved it. We had mimosas and martinis.Service was absolutely stellar.The space is beautifully designed.In the end Carolina had "" great news for us"" the manager had felt bad as there were so few food choices so what we had eaten had been comped! Only drinks were charged! Unbelievable!I truly wished they had a couple of exciting vegan options other than salad and grilled veggies. It's a beautiful place and in 2019 most contemporary restaurants make an effort to add a few exciting plantbased dishes to their menu and clearly label them so. Other than that we were blown away by the hospitality, beautiful decor and service! Thank you.",2,2,1,Felicitas O.,"Brooklyn, NY",82,225,704

4.0,3/9/2019,"Casual atmosphere, family friendly and nice hospitality. You can choose fresh seafoods from the kitchen by yourself, most of which are sold at market price. The only reason I didn't rate 5 stars is that it was expensive for the taste. I should have told them the exact amount we want. Indicated prices are per pound. If you just pick up the whole fish, the amount can be 1.5-2.5 lbs, which is probably too much for 2 parties.",0,0,0,Ryota K.,"New York, NY",0,6,6

We were simply ignored. The ONLY difference between us was that couple was white, and we are brown. When I raised that issue, the restaurant told us, ""Oh we were trying to give you more time to relax."" Not true, because we tried to get their attention before to order, but to no avail. Also, because they had a ready excuse makes me think I was not the first one to complain.

It was not salty and was rly soft - the servers are friendly and nice- the olive oil tasted so fresh and was really good with the bread - in general, their food wasn't salty or too strong.

Wonderful displays of the fresh produce and fish accent the clean decor. The food is simply some of the best Mediterranean food I've ever had. For the lunch pre fixe ($32), which they offer every day, you have a choice of a number of different choices from octopus to oysters to Greek salad for an appetizer, dorade (sea bream) to salmon tartare to lamb chops ($10 supplement) and more for main course, and walnut cake or fresh seasonal fruits for dessert. The dorade is simply cooked with olive oil and salt but it's wonderfully tender and delectable. The octopus is a standout - perfectly grilled and lightly seasoned, offset with a creamy bean hummus. The portions were generously large. The bread is wonderful as well - grilled to be warm, and served with olive oil and fresh herbs that they clip from a live plant right at the table.

3.0,1/25/2019,"Great spot for fancy dining. My boyfriend surprised me with a reservation for lunch during a day in the city. Most important thing to note is that this place is FANCY so yes you need to dress accordingly. I wore a nice sweater and slacks and boots to brave the snow and felt very under dressed. The individuals dining here are NY business execs, so it's appropriate to dress up. To me, the hassle of dressing up to come here is not worth the food and the price. If you're big in to fish this spot is great for you as they have extremely fresh fish. However, I am a vegetarian and was not really into the items I ordered.We ordered the lunch special which comes with an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I had the meze trio, grilled veggies, and walnut cake. Everything was fine, but nothing special that I can't make at home or buy at the grocery store.

Wonderful low-lit, modern ambiance with great music. Once seated, we had a beautiful view of the fish table with all the daily selections that made my mouth water. We chose two stone crab claws to start, then a Greek salad with a light lemon and sea salt dressing, and then we split two Greek fish - one flaky and one steaky - that was grilled and finished with lemon, capers, sea salt and parsley.

5.0,1/12/2019,"I love this place, and am entirely convinced it's one of the most underrated lunch deals in NYC. The first time I dined here, it was for a work dinner and my table had ordered a multitude of courses and bottles of wine. Every seafood dish was amazing--the freshly grilled langustines, scallop, salmon sashimi, sardines, soft-shelled crab, grilled whole fish--all of which were flown in fresh from the Mediterranean and selected by our table from the beautiful display at the front of the restaurant. Even the sides were delicious! I especially enjoyed the Milos Special, which was a tower of thinly sliced and fried zucchini and eggplant with a delicious tzatziki dip, as well as the Greek salad, which was simple but so, so fresh. But during the dinner, I couldn't help but think--there was no way I could afford this comfortably on my own This grand feast was definitely more than my personal budget could handle, but when I found out about their insane 3-course prix fixe lunch menu (available weekends as well!) for only $32, I was FLOORED. I immediately booked it for that Saturday and took my fiancé. Since then, I've taken my parents, as well as recommended it to countless friends and colleagues. I highly recommend the grilled octopus and meze plate for apps and grilled fish as the main.",2,1,1,Ivy Z.,"New York, NY",9,77,272
5.0,1/11/2019,"I am rating this restaurant 5 stars for two reasons... the food was absolutely excellent and extremely flavorful, but more-so the experience that I had during my meal. It was my first time at Milos, so having the very knowledgeable waiters ""take us to the market"" and show us all of the fish that are shipped over extremely fresh was very unique. The high prices are totally worth the experience. We ordered a full Branzino, the eggplant tower, and some form of potatoes-- which all tasted amazing.

4.0,1/6/2019,This is one of the best greek restaurants in the city.  I have been here a number of times for business which is certainly a power lunch spot. The main dining area is a bit loud so I would recommend reserving a table on the 2nd flr/mezz level or downstairs which is my preferance.  While the fish is always solid the lamb is equally very good.  Save room for dessert!,0,0,0,Jazz C.,"Manhattan, NY",2,150,546

3.0,12/30/2018,"We went there tonight. Ordered quite a few dishes to start. Some were excellent like the octopus and the crab cake, others were sub-par like the calamari. The Greek salad was good but I mean that's hard to mess up. We then had the grilled first that we picked ourselves. Got the Dorade Royale, it was cooked perfectly. It unfortunately had no taste. Mostly just tasted like salt, lemon and olive oil. Pretty disappointing considering it rang at $160! Side note - the sommelier was great, she recommended a near perfect wine when we were debating between the Sancerre and the Chablis. Staff is not great. They all are stumbling into each other, not following the basic rules of a good waiter (hello!!

5.0,12/22/2018,I will definitely give this restaurant 5 stars. I came here at the nyc restaurants week 2018 for Sunday lunch. The restaurant is really upscale and the decoration are mostly white colors because it's a Greek restaurant. I reserved from open table. We're a little big late but they're very nice. They gave us a table on the second floor with other Chinese. We're not sure why they put all Chinese in one room. The waiters are very professional. We ordered the 3 courses pre fix menu for $26 each person. They gave us bread with olive oil and cut the leaves from the plant in front of you. That was the really interesting part. The appetizers are brilliant. We had octopus and calamari. It was a lot food for appetizers. We're very satisfied for the appetizers. Main course we have fishes.

5.0,12/19/2018,"There are a ton of Greek Restaurants in NYC, as well as Astoria Queens. The foods at many of them are uniformly the same. But one way how Estiatorio Milos stands out is in its authenticity of their deserts and Pastries.At other restaurants, you can pretty much tell about the food, and how it's made. Many of the NYC restaurants do not get the Greek Deserts right. Many of these recipes are handed down from their Yia Yia, from each of there respective Greek Family.This is the case with the deserts at Milos. You can tell the meticulous work put into the desert and that it just wasn't shipped there from a warehouse Greek shop like Krinos. It was as if I was eating deserts at the top bakeries in Athens or Thessaloniki.The Greek Walnut cake, was so succulent in Nature, with the Honey dropping out of it, reminded me of being in Greece. My wife ( who is Greek) said that the Galaktoboureko was truly amazing, that it couldn't be possibly replicated in many a Greek Restaurant.So kudos to Estratorio Milos management and to the pastry chef, in making the culinary and Greek desert experience truly authentic!",0,0,0,Carl A.,"Bronx, NY",1,45,10
5.0,12/18/2018,"This is a very beautiful Midtown restaurant. It looks modern and classy, but not stuffy. The main dining room is bright and open, with a very high ceiling. There is an upstairs section that's a bit quieter and overlooks the main dining area. There is also a section in the main dining room where fresh fish is put on display, and I heard you can go there and choose which fish you want. The staff was very nice. I came in here for the pre-theater menu (about $50-ish pp), which was not a bad deal for 3 courses. As a starter, they brought out bread with olive oil and fresh oregano. It was my first time seeing fresh oregano! I was intrigued.  For the first course, I went with the Grilled Octopus. It was delicious and came with pureed hummus, grilled peppers, and oyster mushrooms. For the second course, I got the grilled Arctic Char, which ironically had a slight char, even though the inside was a nice medium rare. It came with some white beans, herbs, and a wedge of lemon. Very delicious. For dessert, my favorite course, I went with the Karydopita, a Greek walnut cake with honey lavender ice cream. It was definitely a meal to remember. I heard they also have a prix fixe lunch menu, which I definitely plan on checking out.

Once i walked into this beautiful large open restaurant i felt great. Greeted with warmth, smiling faces, coat check, and very welcoming maitre d. Reservations are an absolute must. The bar stocks very good  scotches and wines. The food menu is Mediterranean specific and very well executed. Service is equally appropriate and very friendly, its a open and fairly loud space. Milo is proof that the wealthy in NYC have it very good.It's very expensive, obscenely expensive, inappropriately expensive. The reason I say this is because I've been frequenting the phenomenal greek restaurant's in Astoria for over thirty years. The prices quality and overall experience or more than 2/3 cheaper. If you want to hobnob with the wealthy go getters of NYC this is your spot but if you want the same level of food for 70% less in terms of cost look to Astoria Queens.

4.0,11/8/2018,"Milos, 125 W. 55th St., Upscale Greek RestaurantRating: 4 Stars I. Here are a few of the many positive aspects of dining at Milos:1. Ambiance: well located in the heart of NYC (midtown), dramatically modern, spacious (they must pay a very high rent).  2. Service: perfect; a good balance of gender, ethnicity and age; everyone was extremely charming and helpful. 3. Selections on Menu: 3 course dinner [pre-theater, late at night], 3 course lunch, and a la cart.4. Live, fresh lobster; I observed at least three that were over 3 lbs.5. Ample selection of freshly caught fish of different sizes (displayed on ice) with options to cook in various styles including Sashimi.6. Many usual and special Greek dishes, raw fish bar, many meat and vegetarian choices. II. Our particular experience based on one visit:1. Pricing: we selected the pre-theater menu, which was $49 per person. The other options were lunch at $32 per person and a la cart (normal high-end restaurant prices). The drinks are expensive, e.g., $18 for a very small glass of sparkling wine; bottle prices ranged from $75 to $1400.2. Service: perfect; at least 5 persons (the waiter, the waitress, the bus boys, as well as the hosts [especially a wonderful kind gentleman named Bruno]) graciously offered as much assistance as we needed. They were all cheerful, professional and dignified. They had a great deal of expertise. Unlike many other places in NYC, service was available on demand. My napkin fell to the floor and a gracious waiter replaced it before I noticed.3. Taste: very different levels of sophistication.  3.1 The appetizers: octopus and the Greek Meze (Tzatziki [yogurt family]), pepper hummus, and taramosalta [fish roe] were excellent in terms of both taste and presentation). Very fresh, sashimi-quality octopus was cooked to the perfect temperature, and seasoned in a tasty, non-oily sauce (as good as any I have had).3.2 The main courses (a whole grilled Mediterranean Bream and 2 Lamb Chops [with French fries]) were below average, e.g., the quality of lamb was not as high as what is served at many NYC restaurants such as Keenes, Old Homestead, Royal Steak 35, or Ruth Christi.3.3 The desserts (Greek yogurt with honey and a few crumbles of nuts as well as walnut cake and ice cream) were tiny and substandard; they were more like a scoop of ice cream and a brownie from an average dinner. It is a pity; there are many classical uniquely Greek desserts.  III. Concerning the prices of the fresh fish and live lobsters:The live lobsters cost about $50 per lb., and freshly killed fish range from $50 to $80 per lb.  IV. REFLECTIONSConsidering the location of the restaurant, the service, the ample variety of choices and the cook's option for a Sashimi version of the fish, and the reasonable prices, it is indeed a good deal. In this light, Milos' fresh seafood is at least as good as any ""non-Japanese"" restaurant in Manhattan, deserving a 5-star rating in terms of Manhattan's upscale restaurants. Here, one may dine, wine and converse in style. However, in terms of seafood (both with regard to cost and taste), there are other general competitors both in midtown as well as in Chinatown.1. High-end Chinese restaurants with better choices (in taste, price, quality and quantity):Evergreen Shanghai (10 East 38 St.), Royal Garden (14 Elizabeth St.; lobster $55 for 2.8 lbs.), Peking Duck House ( 236 East 53rd St., also 28 Mott St., 1.75 lb. lobster dish is less than $40), Radiance (classical Cantonese, 208 East 50th St.; lobster [1.75 lb.] plus chicken special for $39/$59) .2. Chinatown places with a Focus on live seafood, fish tank:The best (freshness, quality, quantity, price) options in terms of live lobster and crab fish are in Chinatown. Here is a paradigm case: Yi Lee (1 Elizabeth St.), 3 lbs. of live, fresh lobster (cooked in ginger and scallion) for the cost of $35 (compared with $150 at Milos); also 2.5 lbs. of live-cooked sea bass costs $40 instead of $120-150. Available on demand: live Alaskan king crab for $30 per lb. The ambiance is spacious, clean and family-friendly; to avoid ""corn starch"" we brought ""olive oil"" for ""ginger -scallion "" options of live  lobster, fish and crab [Alaskan king crab (8 lbs.); Dungeness crab (3+ lb.)] dishes. It is tasty and healthy.  Obviously, operating a business at Elizabeth-Bayard crossing costs much less than 55th St.- 6th Ave., so a 3 lb. lobster is offered for $35 instead of $150. The place is very near Chinese Ice Cream Factory serving many flavors, including unique Chinese options (e.g., toro, black sesame, lichee, ginger, etc.). V. A FINAL NOTE:If one, a la Jean-Jacques Rousseau, places ""nature over nurture, "" then the Japanese Sashimi style is the optimal ""existential"" mode of consumption of fresh seafood dishes. In that tenor, a favorite NYC midtown option is Ab Sushi  (11 W. 36th St.). Best ""deal"" in NYC.",0,1,0,Parviz M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,47,1

They have a three course lunch for $34 and you can choose from several items.We started with the octopus appetizer. Slices of octopus on a creamy pureed hummus. Excellent. The Horiatiki salad was also delightful and done correctly. Main courses were the arctic Char --a salmon like fish-- on a bed of white beans and the lamb chops.

5.0,10/13/2018,"Overall - One of the best meals I have ever had!What I got - Calamari, fried zucchini and eggplant tower, Greek salad with heirloom tomatoes, baklava, greek yogurt and honeyTaste - Amazing, everything I ate was prepared perfectly. The chef really knew how to make each dish stand on its own and embrace its natural flavors. For example, the calamari was battered lightly to give a nice textural component to the underlying tender squid. Additionally, the dishes were prepared without over seasoning and you were able to truly taste the high quality ingredients that made up each dish. We also had the fried eggplant and zucchini tower and although everything was sliced very thin, you could clearly taste the fresh zucchini and eggplant.  Furthermore, the batter was light and gave them a nice flaky crunch. I cannot remeber what fish we ended up getting because our first choice was sold out, but I remember that it was light and flakey and delightful just as you would want fish to be. We also got the greek salad with heirloom tomatoes and I never knew how good a tomato could be until I had them in this salad. They were very tender and a little sweet. We also had a large sampling of various desserts, and even though Im not the biggest fan of greek desserts I still enjoyed them. There was not a dish that stood out because they were all so good.Value - Come here and expect to drop some coin and know it will be worth it.Service - There were a few issues with the service, maybe because it was a busy night or our waiter was new but that is very uncharacteristic of this establishment. To make up for it they brought us a big sampling of desserts.Atmosphere - fine dining, intimate, not too noisy but you will definitely notice other people. Facility - large and well decorated. They have a spread of fish set out. High ceilings and dark. Need to know - there is a dress code, think business casual.Would I come back - YesWould I go out of my way - YesAdditional info - Go here, you won't regret it. Make reservations.

We both had 2 glasses of wine each. All the wines we tried were great! I'd skip the stale bread basket but we were starving (mistake).We ordered the ceviche and grilled octopus for starters.  The ceviche wasn't worth it. No flavor. The octopus was soooooooo good. The fluffy fava purée it came with should just be sold alone in stores when this chef is ready to retire. The octopus was perfectly tender and so flavorful. We took the fish market tour with our waiter who kept only pushing the balada fish. I would walk away to go inquire about the other fish and he was staying put where the balada fish was. I even told him I've had it before elsewhere and think it's a flavorless white fish. He responded saying we would have to taste their version. My husband was like ""well we usually love to take our waiter's opinion on what's good so what do u wanna do babe?"" And I said ok let's try it. It was flavorless. Like I expected. Not sure if the restaurant needed to push out all the balada that night but everyone around us also ordered the same thing. And I'm seeing a ton of balada pics on yelp. Skip it!!!

The octopus was definitely the highlight and I'm excited to go back and have it again. Great bread too. I had the salmon tartare and the mezze plate and both were quite good.

3.0,7/29/2018,"I recently tried this place for RW, and while it is a perfectly fine restaurant, I do not think it warrants the price tag nor reviews. Food: For $26, I would say it was totally worth it--you get an appetizer, main dish, and dessert. But, if it was more, I'm not sure. The oysters were very small...which wasn't a big deal since hey- it's RW. But, what made it unfortunate was that it was not shucked properly; I had pieces of the shell in my oysters. The Dorade Royal was pretty dry, as if it was over cooked. However, it was pretty large, and filling. Atmosphere: Great. The receptionists were great and the restaurant has a very clean, calm vibe. Service: Perhaps because it was Restaurant Week and those who were around us were primary ordering from the set menu, the service was mediocre/rough. When changing utensils in between courses, the servers would not completely place the utensils on the table, or it would be slanted. One server also dropped a fork as he was leaving our table, which hit a guest, but there was no apology. While this seems knit picky, these are subtle touches that make restaurants like these exceptional. Would come back for a different RW to try more of their menu before making a final decision.",2,1,1,Luna K.,"Minato, Japan",31,74,216

However, what I will remember the most is my 30 minutes at the bar, waiting for my party to arrive. Marina, & Dino, the bartenders, made craft cocktails very well aligned with the overall Mediterranean expectations. Marina's knowledge of the various items on the menu augmented with the presentation of the fish and crustaceans helped immensely to make a final choice.

Perfectly seasoned in my opinion. Everythjng had tye right amount of oil, you tasted the fresh herbs along the way.

We were seated at a roundtable but in a busy zone because the servers kept walking behind me and my colleague's seat. We were missing a glass and a fork since there were 7 of us. It was a better deal to order from the Prix Fixe Menu rather than individual dishes. All the other tables around us had a bread basket and it took awhile for someone to bring us some bread. First: 4 + 1 Oysters (1) Greek Meze Plate (1) Grilled Octopus (2) Calamari (2)...Oooo this was yummy and I love the deep fried baby squid mmm and I asked my colleague if I can eat his because that would be such a wasteTomato Salad (1) Second: There was suppose to be five orders of Icelandic Arctic Char but my colleague told the server that he ordered the Char as well but the server insisted on Dorade Royal which my other colleague ordered. If I was in his shoes, I wouldn't have selected for a wrong dish and made sure that my correct order came out of the kitchen. Unbelievable the portion sizes of the Char came literally in all different sizes. One of my managers got ""the short end of the stick""!Lamb Chops (well done) - two lamb lollipops plated on a bed of Greek Fried Potatoes...feels like more fish and chips concept without the fried fishAs our server was clearing out the dishes, he was cleaning the breadcrumbs from the tablecloth but it landed on top of me...smfh!

2.0,5/6/2018,"I have been visiting Milos for years and have always been pleased with their food and service. Unfortunately, that was not the case when I visited Milos on May 2 when I was served by Anastasio #50C, who provided us with horrible service. Despite the fact that we asked for our red snapper to be deboned, it was full of bones. On my first bite, I almost choked on a bone. At first I thought it was just bad luck until I realized that I was getting a bone with every bite. The same thing occurred to the friend who I was dining with and sharing a fish for 2. After almost choking, I decided not to eat anymore of the fish. I didn't see the point to risking that again since every bite had a bone in it. We shared this with the busboy who told us that would only happen with the thinner part of the fish but not with the thicker, meatier section of the fish. So we tried another bite from the meatier part of the fish and continued to have the same experience. My friend continued to eat the fish and found a bone with every bite. I stopped eating the fish and asked to speak to the waiter. I explained the problem to the waiter and told him that this had never happened to me at Milos. He insisted that there was nothing wrong with the fish and acted like we were crazy. When they collected the dishes, they saw that I only had a few bites of my fish. At that point, the waiter asked if I wanted something else. It was half past ten and I did not want to wait for another fish to be cooked so I declined. He should have offered to get me something else from the beginning not an hour later. Even though I told the waiter that I was gluten free, he brought me a baklava to make things better. The busboy did remember and took it away when he saw it and brought us some sorbet. We had a bill of $555.52 and expect better service than that. A free bowl of sorbet does not compensate for being served a horrible fish full of bones and told that the fish had been properly deboned despite our complaints. This is not the type or service I expect from such a high end restaurant.",0,0,0,Elisabeth P.,"Queens, NY",1,32,27

Artic Char was brilliantly cooked but tuna burger was an awful embarrassment to be served in a seafood restaurant. Mezze platter was unbelievably light and flavorful in Vegas but very heavy and bland here. But the main problem I consider a service at this NYC location. The female server was very inattentive and lacks training. She was not friendly, didn't make any attempts to explain the menu or recommend any dishes. When taking order and bringing food/drink  my husband was served first, the menus were just dropped on the table and the dishes were not explained when presented. We also had to remind her to bring wine and later coffee twice since the drinks never made it to our table. The door in women's bathroom doesn't have a lock so we had to take turns guarding the door.

The food was good and the service was solicitous, however our waiter kept bringing things that we didn't order like extra rounds of drinks, desserts to celebrate birthdays, even after we had already ordered two desserts.  We ordered special large shrimp as appetizers that cost $30 each. When one was sent back because it was raw they brought another, but they charged us for the replacement. They also charged us for a lobster that we didn't order, so instead of there being two on the bill there were three.  Carefully scrutinizing the bill when hosting another couple seemed awkward so even though it was an astronomical $1100 for four people, my husband paid it and we scrutinized it afterwards and found all these discrepancies.

For example, my favorite Milos chips (zucchini and eggplant chips) are more lightly fried than Avra or Taverna Kyclades (great comfort food). They really do octopus well (crispy outside but soft inside/ sometimes it can be fishy at other places). Stuffed calamari is very good too but so is the one at Avra.

No sides with that either, is this a steak house!!Greek salad not better than a diner and another 30 bucks ,French bottled water that I would never have ordered but taking out 2 clients, comes to $34.00, if you're rich and don't care about cost maybe this is place for you but I find it s bit of s clip joint to use retro term! Fried zucchini delicious but not worth the other disappointments , come on $540.00 with tip for 3 and only 2 drinks between us ,know it's an expensive town but think this is a bit crazy, seem to be in minority since place was packed and they have 5 other restaurants but next time I'll take my 540 and try a battali restaurant or a well rated much cheaper Greek place.

4.0,1/5/2018,"Milos is as close as you can get to eating at a seafood restaurant in Greece. It's customary to get up, walk to the display of fresh fish, and choose the ones you want; they'll weigh them on the spot and send them off to the kitchen. Tsipoura (sea bream), grilled and served with ladolemono (olive oil and lemon) is top notch and highly recommended. The sole is excellent, and best ordered fried, though ours was overdone. Barbounia (red mullets) are also commonly ordered fried or grilled and are very good. In contrast, the sardines were undercooked and devoid of flavor--a total miss. The Milos special is expensive for what you get, but super tasty; it's paper-thin slices of zucchini and eggplant, fried, served with fried cheese and thick tzatziki.  Try some horta; leafy dandelion greens, boiled, very tender, and delicious with olive oil and lemon; a Greek staple. The octopus is (oddly) served with onions, which you can discard for the sake of authenticity, and desperately needs to be served with olive oil and red vinegar (as it always is in Greece) but it's tender, well-grilled, and delicious. Save room for galaktoboureko (milk custard in phyllo dough with syrup). Milos is always busy, and usually rather loud, and a reservation is a very good idea.",0,0,0,Moses A.,"Middleton, WI",3,80,165

4.0,1/1/2018,"After dining multiple times here and their other locations, I'm a fan of this brand of restaurants. The selection of seafood and varieties of their preparation is wonderful to experience. Any non-Asian place that has enough confidence with their fish quality to prepare it raw is a indication of the freshness and confidence of its ingredients. The only minor complaint is having to wait when there seems to be open tables and a reservation was made. I feel it's more of a protocol than anything else. This brand of restaurants has gotten food, service, presentation, and customer satisfaction right on point.

The servers are gregarious, gracious and seasoned. But it always appears as if they are short on waiters. I've never been and had my order completely right- a side dish was missing or even an appetizer. I blame this mostly on the lack of servers as they rush around to their tables. With this being said, the salads especially Greek is delicious always with the ripest tomatoes. The lamb is tender, plump juicy and lean. This is the only place I order lamb.

2.0,11/6/2017,"This restaurant is grossly over-priced and unbearably noisy. It is impossible to hear anyone who is more than a foot away from your ear - it requires a drastic sound-absorbing redo. I have never seen a restaurant with a seak entree priced at $150, or broiled whole fish in the same price realm. Admittedly, the dorade and lamb chops we had were nicely cooked - but they are available at comparable places in other upscale midtown Manhattan eateries for a fraction of the prices here. The signature appetizer, deep fried discs of eggplant and zucchini with tzatziki, can be very good (at $35 per plate), if it is served fresh and hot - which it was not in our case, perhaps because the service was so slow.

5.0,11/4/2017,"When my plane lands at JFK, first thing I'm thinking of is Milos. This restaurant is close to my heart and never disappoints me. The place was under a 6 weeks renovation which is now completed and the changes they made like adding blue color/ceramics to the kitchen area contributes to the middetearanean vibe.I made my reservation 3 weeks ahead because I like to sit in the middle section which is more spacious. I don't like the tables in the bar section, I find them too tight and close to each other in a way that you can hear your neighbors conversation all night along.My favorite appetizers are the Ceviche and the Greek Salad. The Ceviche is so delicious that I sometimes order it twice !!! I have never had any Ceviche tastier than the one in Milos.The Greek Salad contains chunky meaty tomatoes, cucumber, some onions and two feta cheese wedges. It's a very simple salad with olive oil and lemon but delightful and tasty. None of the dishes are saucy, oily  or exaggerated here. They are simple dishes but the meticulously chosen high quality ingredients make them amazing and super delicious.One of my favorite dishes is the Carabinero Shrimp served with a shot of sherry, which unfortunately comes with a high price tag but worth a try at least once.The only thing I find a waste of money here are the cocktails for $17. They are poorly made and taste like a mix of candy syrup and cheap alcohol, therefor it's best to stick with the wine list.Another great bonus about this restaurant that makes it special is the fast and above excellent service.",2,0,0,Sara K.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,64,174

The appetizer we got the emperor fish which was raw i was hesitant to get but it was beyond amazing . We also got the calamari and a side the beats with yogurt . Those were also good . I ordered this Greek salad that was basically tomatoes and it was 30 dollars with two olives when I asked for More and guy said only two come in so I ordered olives that were 7 dollars lol . So I basically paid 40 dollars for a bad salad . I also had branzeni (spelling ) fish which was grilled with lemon and olive oil I enjoyed that .  We were 2 people and our bill was like 500 bucks .

Such a simple preparation that really lets the flavor of the fish shine through.  One of the tastiest pieces of fish I've ever had, no joke.  The fish was enough to be shared among 3 of us.Loukoumades (Greek Beignets) - Pretty good, light dessert.  Little puffy beignets covered in a thyme honey.  Good way to end the dinner, without putting us over the edge of being stuffed...went good with our coffee & espresso.They keep all the preparations simple here, in order to let the amazingly fresh seafood be the star.  I was blown away at how good the fish was, with nothing more than olive oil and lemon juice...still can't get over it really.Milos is NOT cheap at all.  With the above food and copious amounts of drinks and a bottle of wine....we ended up over $700 for 3 of us.  Is it worth it?  YES YES YES.  Any seafood lover should treat themselves when in NYC to a meal at Milos...you won't regret.",1,0,1,Blake B.,"Irvine, CA",176,80,37

2.0,8/13/2017,"Only redeeming quality was their baklava and the walnut cake. Okay with that out of the way, this place was such a shame. With a gorgeous venue of high ceilings, clean crisp white tables and an open kitchen, we were just expecting so much more. My friend and I went for a sunday brunch, during restaurant week, but it seems like they offer the $29 prix-fixe lunch all the time. First the waitress was (un)intentionally unprofessional. We were only given the prix fixe menu, and had to ask her for the à la carte menu as well as the drinks menu. We were the only table who had to do this as the couples around us were given all these options from the get-go. And even then we were only given a very short cocktail menu and not the full wine list. Also their still water is evian. Just. Just no. I got the salmon tartare (small. I'm talking like a quarter of my palm) which was actually decent, but not mind-blowing. Definitely fresh. My friend had the calamari, which was again, decent but not mind-blowing.The main was a disaster. I got the sea bream. First bite and all I got were bones. It is served fillet-ed so why the bones???? I'm not talking about conspicuous, presentation-pretty bones, I mean there were just bones that they failed to remove which is a little ridiculous given it's seam bream, not that difficult to debone at all. It was seasoned well though with olive oil and lemon. However it was overcooked. For a fish-centric menu, it was very disappointing. My friend got the lobster pasta. There was actually a decent amount of chunks of lobster, which was good, but it was overcooked again! The sauce was a tomato-cream base, which was unexpected. It just wasnt great either I felt like for a place with this price tag, they really should have everything perfected to the tea. For the dessert, it was a platter of watermelon, melon, some berries, baklava and walnut cake. I found it so weird that these plates of cut fruit were kept outside in front of the kitchen at this weather. They were just sitting there, and not plated to order but pre-plated (which makes sense because the pre-fixe has no desserts choice) in this room temp, above 70 degrees-ish. Some plates were sitting there the whole time we were eating. So we ate room temperature fruit. Is this not a health violation?? I guess the baklava and the walnut cake made up for some of the problems. Cocktails were decent. Service wasn't horrible but it wasn't great. Didn't pull out the table for me to go into the seat. Failed to clean off the crumbs after the appetiser. Water was refilled with tap water multiple times even though we were having bottled water. A little too touristy but I guess it's midtown and that's not something you can control. Service felt a little rushed.

4.0,8/7/2017,"Went here with two others a few days ago. The place was super crowded and quite loud. The people varied in terms of dressiness but I would say business casual or more. I feel the sound traveled well in this very spacious dining room. The service was excellent and made some good recommendations.We each had a glass of wine. I stuck with an assyrtiko/sauvignon blanc blend while a sweeter wine was recommended for another one of the people. The wine was good and the pour was fine though nothing large for the price. They served some toasted bread with olive oil which was fine.After looking through the menu, two of us went to the fish display area. The other person got lamb chops. Our waiter offered us a type of Greek sea bass but we went with a fish I was more in the mood for, John Dory, or St. Peter's Fish. We said two would primarily be eating it and he picked one out that turned out to be around two and a half pounds. It was 48 a pound so you can uhh see that it would be a bit pricey. They checked whether cooking it with capers, lemon, and olive oil would be fine which was fine with us.We ordered their famed Milos Special and their grilled mushrooms as appetizers. The Milos Special was quite good with some very good Tzatziki and some very lightly battered zucchini. I can see why it's a hit. I would say that there wasn't enough fried cheese for the price. I know how much it goes for and it was quite tiny though good for the 4/5 pieces. The grilled mushrooms were excellent with three different types. Perfectly grilled and quite delicious.The lamb chops one of them ordered was excellent though the sides of plain vegetables were a bit to be desired. The fries were good but the plain broccoli/carrots was a bit boring for the price. They were however cooked perfectly and the price was fine in terms of quality. If you are a fan of lamb chops and especially for a fish place, they were quite good.We ordered a side of horta which was fine though it was drenched a bit too much in olive oil. The flavor was fine and the portion size was pretty large though it was 12 dollars.The main attraction of course was the fish. It was perfectly cooked. They had split it into two very large pieces and asked if either of us wanted the head. I got it, mostly for the cheek (or would it be the jaw?) meat which I highly recommend from a John Dory. The sauce was light but good.In terms of dessert, they gave me a slice of baklava for my birthday which the other two ordered a galactobureko. The former was quite light and airy and it was uniquely mixed with pistachios and walnuts. It was not as sweet as some other places. The nutty cream was mostly not necessary and it was a bit oily. The latter was not nearly as sweet also, having some orange whipped into the custard. It reminded me of orange liquor though I prefer a normal one. The desserts overall were fine and worth it for the price.The staff was as noted excellent though I found the prices high for the quality of most of the meal. It's an occasion place outside of the 30 dollar prix fixe menu which seems to be a good deal. 4.1. I'd give it higher if the prices weren't as absurd.",1,0,0,Glenn C.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",208,1266,376

4.0,7/29/2017,"Some coworkers and I dropped in for lunch purely by chance (we wanted to go to Black Tap Craft Burgers originally, but the line was too long) and I'm glad we did, because I enjoyed everything about our meal at Estiatorio Milos.They have a nice pre-fixe lunch deal where you can get an appetizer, entrée, and dessert for just $30/person.  In addition, they provide free olive oil with some of the BEST bread I think I've ever eaten... seriously, it was nice and fluffy and perfectly charred on the outside, as if they had just taken it out of their oven before serving it to our table.  We went through two baskets of bread (mostly eaten by me, since I'm such a carboholic) before our food even arrived because it was that good.For my appetizer, I ordered the ""Mezze Plate"" which came with an assortment of veggies and hummus/dips.  I really enjoyed this plate, especially the hummus they provided... in fact, I used it to dip some of the table bread as well!As my entrée, I got the Salmon with Santorini Piazza beans.  This was excellent.  The salmon was perfectly cooked - super juicy, oily (in a good way), and practically melted in my mouth.  Bursting with flavor - highly recommend if you like seafood.And finally for my dessert, I opted for the ""karidopita"" which was a walnut cake complemented by a dollop of creamy vanilla ice cream on top.  This was really delicious - the cake itself was very dense and moist (I think it was soaked in honey as well?) but the richness of the cake was nicely balanced out by the cold vanilla ice cream.  Great way to end our meal.OVERALL: 4/5.  A lovely Greek/Mediterranean restaurant in the heart of downtown Manhattan - their lunch special is affordable and gets you a nice sampling of delicious food.  Service is a bit slow (our lunch ended up taking 1.5 hours) which was the only downside to an otherwise excellent meal.",4,1,2,Eric C.,"Katy, TX",305,498,2499
3.0,7/27/2017,One of our favorite restaurants in NYC was a bit disappointing last night. Showed up at 8:10 for an 8:15 reservation for 5.It was obvious after a couple of minutes that they did not have a table ready for us. Finally showed us to a table outside that was for 4. We ended up squeezing in. Service was slow with quite a few different waiters coming by our table. Took a while for someone to actually wait on us. Wanted to order a bottle of wine but the waiter mentioned that we could order it after we ordered our food. What? Not happy about that. Food was delicious as usual.

The food was great as usual, but the service was unacceptable. Other than to bring us our food, we were hardly approached by waiters. It took forever for the staff to clear empty plates, fill our water glasses, and offer dessert menus when we were done. When we were finally approached for our dessert order, we ordered tea and dessert. We sat next to the desert kitchen, and I saw our deserts ready after about 15 minutes. The desserts were just sitting there for about another 20 minutes, and we reasoned that they were waiting for our tea to be ready, to serve us our teas and desserts together (which obviously makes sense). The teas did not arrive, and our desserts were served to us without them. Our deserts included pastries and ice cream, and arrived soggy and melted (after the long time they were waiting on the counter). As we began eating our desserts, I asked the waiter about our teas and noted that we would like to have our tea with dessert. After about 10 more minutes, we finished our desserts and the teas never arrived. I asked to cancel our teas and asked for the check. Not only did we not receive an apology or any recognition of their mistake, we had to ask for the check again before we got it.

I recommend the grilled octopus and fried zucchini flowers. The entrees are portions for ""two or more"". If there are only two of you and you want different dishes, I don't recommend dinner. My husband had a porterhouse that could easily serve four or more people. My lobster was perfect but also too much. Milos is oddly unsatisfying and it took me a while to appreciate why. Milos is an Haute establishment but Greek is not an Haute Cuisine. There should be a breezy and abundant mediterranean menu and atmosphere. Instead it is restrained and humorless as is the staff. If you want lamb, tzatziki, kebabs, moussaka and skordalia, this is not the place. Milos takes itself so seriously that it is uncomfortable. The food is beautiful and so are the curated diners.

The Milos Special - Lightly breaded ribbons of zucchini, towered over a dollop of some of the best tzatziki sauce you will ever have!  The flavor and consistency were out of this world.  The dish also had Greek cheese fried on the side of the platter.  I definitely recommend this appetizer!2. Langoustine- Although this was the most expensive item we ordered, it was the least impressive to me.  I would not order this again.  The grilled langoustine meat was tasty, but it was lacking flavor.  It would have been better served with butter or a sauce.  3. Fresh Emperor filet (Catch of the day)- This fish was so light and subtly flavored.  I absolutely loved it!  The Emperor was cooked in a light butter, wine and caper sauce.  4.

There are very few places I would ever order octopus or lamb because both can come out so terribly but both are excellent here. Decor is beautiful and airy with Mykonos umbrellas and soaring ceilings. Because of the layout the noise is a little much so if you are sensitive ask to be seated by the window where you are less in the middle. The pre-theater prix fixe for $49 is a good deal with appetizer, Greek salad, main and dessert. No cheap restaurant week-type filler options either. The only weak spot is the dessert with sorbet, a lame fruit plate or walnut cake as your options.  The dinner menu overall is expensive but that's what you get wish paying for fish by weight.  Many of the servers here are actually Greek- warm, friendly, and pleasant.  I've eaten here many times over the years and although I always have a nice time, the service itself is lacking.  Just a bit slow and undetailed and a bit under par for the setting, food, and prices.

The second time I came to eat here, for the winter 2017 season, I ordered the octopus appetizer and the lavraki baked in sea salt for two. Both were delicious! The octopus came over hummus which was a surprising but interesting combination. The fish was so moist and although both did not look like a lot of food, there was barely any room for dessert. Although the food here was excellent, service here unfortunately was not. We had to ask the waiter three times before he refilled our water and it took nearly 15 minutes to get the check after asking 3 different waiters. There didn't seem to be anyone in charge of our table but someone kept coming back to ask how we were doing without addressing our concerns.

2.0,2/4/2017,"Overpriced and underwhelmed. They treat fish here like it's as scarce as good caviar and price it the same. But the quality comes nowhere near matching the price. Its only saving grace is good service although the waiters try to up-sell with a vengeance. The Greek Salad was the biggest disappointment at a whopping price for a handful of tomatoes on a side plate. And surprise, the menu on their website omits the prices.

5.0,1/30/2017,"Summary:   Great place for a business or more formal Greek or Seafood option.  Wonderful staff.Atmosphere:  There is an elegance to this modern decor that makes it appropriate for power business type meetings, family, or an elegant friends night out.  It's Greek, but has almost a Scandinavian cool feel in decor.  The high ceilings makes the place seem larger than it is.  This also means that the restaurant is quite loud.  This can be both good and bad.  I was fine at my little table for two and a catch up with a dear friend and while the concentrated ear can hear others around, there is enough a buzz that it's not a huge problem.  If I needed an extremely quiet place to talk business, I'd choose another spot or come later in the afternoon(2pm-2:30pm seating).Service:  They have been around for 20 years, so the team is pretty established.  Multiple folks manage the host station and they know how to handle things.  Being late is not fatal. I came at the very end of a lunch shift to enjoy the menu and my co-pilot was running past their close of kitchen.  They still deftly sorted me out which was super-appreciated.  Wait staff is quite competent and well-mannered.  Our waiter knew the menu well and enough customer acuity to manage the timing of plates and sense the tempo of lazy lunch.  Present when needed, but not far or absent.  Despite that we were clearly there during the restaurants break period (the short time when staff gets to eat between lunch and dinner) we did not feel ignored, rushed, or in any way made to have to leave.The Food: The Prix Fixe for lunch was perfect in portion and quite delicious.Beluga Lentil salad - Truly Wonderful.  Chef did a good job infusing flavor into this extremely healthy fish and lentil dish.  None of the bad fish flavor, all of the delicious fish flavor. 5 stars.Scallop Appetizer - So wonderful. I really enjoyed this. I can't tell you which I liked better between scallops and lentil.  If you're in the mood for warm instead of cold, get this.Shrimp risotto - I liked this.  The flavors were well blended and flavored without going too pungent. There is just such an abundance of delicious shrimp risotto it's hard to say this was the absolute best, so 4 stars.  Still, if you're into shrimp, the ingredients are delightful.  Go for it.Greek Dessert - I enjoyed it, but still learning my greek desserts.  5 stars.Final tip:  If you like people watching, find a seat by the floor to ceiling windows at the front.  If you want privacy, don't take the windows.  Also, they are in the process of expanding for private events. Once they sort out the remodel, I think this could be an excellent choice for corporate dining events.",3,1,2,May L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",617,466,229

5.0,12/29/2016,"This has to be one of the best and most memorable meals I have ever had. Now I'm not one who typically dines at $$$$ places, so I don't know how it compares to others, but for me it was a real treat. I came here for a work dinner so I didn't front the bill (thankfully). First of all, I loved the overall atmosphere. It has a light and airy feel, and feels almost like you are in the Mediterranean yourself. It was very crowded so definitely have a reservation.Right as we sat down, the waiter came over and asked if we wanted to see the fish of the day. Luckily someone from our group had been before and knew that this was a must. We walked over to the open kitchen and saw the extremely fresh (and sometimes even still alive) fish on a bed of ice which had been shipped in that very day from across the globe. That marketing worked as we chose to start off the meal with a bit of sashimi so that we could really appreciate the freshness and flavors. On top of the sashimi, we got:Greek salad (so fresh - definitely a must)Saganaki (unreal)CalamariOystersScallopsLambSteamed vegetablesFrench friesAnother fresh fish cooked (I don't remember which one but it was whatever the waiter recommended)BaklavaYogurt with honeyAnd plenty of wineThe highlights were certainly the fresh fish, saganaki, and greek salad.

1.0,12/29/2016,"The good: Generous selection of Greek wine and appetizers were pretty tasty (grilled octopus, Greek salad, Milos special). The bad: Where do I start?? 1) The tables are cramped together, but it does not stop the wait staff from squeezing between chairs and bumping into seated diners every single time. 2) I had no idea who our waiter was. Separate people took our food orders, drink orders, and dessert orders. First waiter that took our food order couldn't bother to show any interest at all. When asked for recommendations, his response was ""well, whatever you want."" Good job, dude. 3) Every course felt rushed. Felt like we were asked every 5 minutes if they can take our plates away, even when we still had utensils in our hands and food on our plates. They even gave us our check before we asked for it. 4) Entrees were not prepared as how a $$$$ restaurant should prepare it. Ordered the Dorade Royale (sea bream). It came ""deboned."" Why quotes? Because first bite, I bit into a bone. Second bite, another one. Third, yup, you guessed it. If a fish is presented as deboned, I would expect no bones. Flavor was bland, also. No lemon to help add acidity. My fish was also very fishy, which is an indicator of not being fresh. I couldn't even bring it up to a waiter because all of a sudden, they were nowhere to be found. Someone did come by when I wasn't expecting it and took the 3/4 of a fish away, but did so without even asking how I enjoyed my food or if I was finished. And honestly, it just wasn't worth it to bring it up anymore. 5) I noticed that the staff does not give way to customers. When customers were walking to their tables or to/from the bathrooms, the wait staff never once step aside to allow customers to walk first. Instead, it was the opposite. Whether or not my party felt the same way, I have no idea. We were there to celebrate a birthday and the birthday girl chose the restaurant. There is no way that I would bring up the flaws of the restaurant in front of the birthday girl. I had high expectations based on the positive reviews, but this is just another overpriced restaurant in Midtown to trap tourists and suits.

There's a fresh fish display on ice where you pick the fish you want. I honestly can't remember which fish we went with, but we also grabbed some langoustines as well.

We ordered the greek salad, octopus, grilled vegetables and the salmon (the portions are rather large...the two of us could eat and we didn't finish). Everything was delicious except our waiter forgot about the salmon and since he didn't check on us once during our meal, by the time I hunted him down it was another 15 mins after we finished eating. He brought out the salmon and it was cold...we each took a bite and just wanted to get out of there. The next challenge: getting our waiter to bring us the check. After 10 mins I gave up and asked another server walking by for it. Our server rushed over frazzled with the check apologizing. At this rate I just wanted to leave the cash and get out but there was an extra charge for calamari which we never ordered (ultimate face palm). The entire thing was amateur hour.

It had a nice little market which reassured me of the freshness of the food.  Unfortunately, our options were limited which is somewhat understandable because we went for a late lunch. However, it was limited as in half the menu was not available. Definitely annoyed but better than having them throw something together last minute with substitutions. Besides the options, food was great!!! Next the service... The service was ... Unexpected. The hostess was nice and professional, instructed us to our seats. The servers were kind of all over the place. Not rude or offensive but a bit less attentive and professional than I would expect from such a reputable restaurant.  Our server got us what we needed but seemed to stand around blankly at times. The bus boy was sliding things onto the table.

Add some sloppy oil pouring.  Drips came from the bottle onto my girlfriends head.  She does not Yelp.  But lets say this - blondes that spend 2 hours ""getting ready"" don't think its cool to have olive oil dropped in their hair.  At a place known for Greek food - I would have thought this would have been an area of pride.  Not a mention of the oil so its probably from a 1 gallon jug from Walmart.One waiter violently ripped and tore apart basil from 12 inches above the oil  on a small plate (as if this was some kind of tableside preparation that was traditionally done in Greece). Most of it ended up in my left over, watered down drink - from the bar... (I did think it was funny that no one asked me at the table what I wanted to drink again all night... that watered down drink with basil debris sat there all night).Total bill $1120 dollars (+/- 10 bucks) .... Yes read it again.Here is what we think we ordered:Zucchini appetizer One bottle of chardonnay (about 75 bucks - grocery store quality) for the whole tableOne shrimp for each person One piece of sashimi for each personTwo fish - two filets for each person, grilled - ready for the punch line - these were the only two fish left.  In a muffled and lackadaisical Ukrainian accent, we were told that everything was gone (he pointed to empty ice chests).  There are 15 fish on the menu.  All gone.  Lobster?  Nope. The waiter told us about it all... but it was all gone.  Two lonely fish remained.One grilled asparagus side Three desserts, shared by all NO cocktails We left still hungry, as this isn't very much for five grown people. I still have no idea how this totaled a grand. They didn't care what it cost as they hovered around us trying to get us to leave so they could get back to staff horseplay and internal antics.So disappointed.",2,2,1,Pete P.,"Chicago, IL",0,35,0

5.0,7/26/2016,"It is my favorite Greek restaurant in New York. I was brought here by a Greek co-worker. In particular the seafood, is phenomenal. In my opinion, it has the best salmon entrée anywhere (Sorry Seattle. I think I like this salmon more even if it is farmed salmon). The restaurant is beautiful. The ambiance is perfect and upscale. In addition, it has the freshest basil you will ever find. How fresh? They have a small pot of basil still growing at your table and cut it straight from the plant into your olive oil for your bread. It is really not necessary to dine here for Restaurant Week. They have the same prix-fixed menu for lunch regardless. It is only a few dollars cheaper for Restaurant Week.

This was my first time smelling fresh oregano; it was an amazing start.AppetizerThe Octopus was grilled to perfection served over a bed of humus and lightly sautéed onions. The Smoked Sturgeon gave just enough taste to flavor the lentil salad without overpower it. SaladSimple, but very well done. The tomatoes were perfectly ripe in a light dressing accompanied by some sliced cucumbers, onions and fresh sliced feta cheese. Main CourseMilos is not the type of place that hides its dishes in heavy sauces. They want you to actually taste the fish and have light flavors accompany it. The salmon was served with piazzi beans with dill. The sea bream was grilled, served whole topped with some capers, yes the head comes along with. Both dishes were exquisite.

4.0,6/29/2016,"My husband has been raving about this fancy Greek/Mediterranean restaurant that he has been taking his clients to and so we decided to celebrate our second wedding anniversary here.  Bottom-line, ditch the menu and go for the fresh seafood at their fish market display. From here, you get to create your own menu. You may pay heftier price but it's definitely worth your money. Tourists tend to fall for the pre-fixes because it appears you get more bang for your buck but at the end, you get mediocre food. If you're here, might as well just splurge and experience the authenticity. We ordered a couple of barbouni fish as a starter where they fried it. It's almost like eating fried mackerel except bonier and the meat is softer.  We also got this amazing fresh scallop, which was still moving when we were inspecting it at the fish market.  We also ended getting this huge pan fried fish (forgot the name) that both me and my husband shared and it was super soft and tender. The only thing we ordered from the menu was the zucchini chips/fries that everyone recommended and so do I. Overall, the food is great here and expect to spend some money. Service could be a little more warm and welcoming though, which is why I'm only giving it 4 stars.  I felt some of the staff here were giving judgmental looks.

The captain assigned to us was not friendly and did not explain much. He pointed out a fish and said ""you should eat this"". When asked why he replied ""because it's good"".

5.0,4/18/2016,"Milos changed NY and American dining habits for ever. Before its opening there wasn't any Greek style grilled whole fish and seafood place in NY. Today they exist countless restaurants based on Milos menu and concept not only here but all over the country, in every major city. All of their success is due to this genius man Kostas Spiliadis the owner of Milos. He didn't hesitate to introduce this concept in a market that was not used to see a whole fish on the table. Yes it's true. People use to eat as a fish salmon, flounder, halibut, filet of sole or snapper broiled and bathed in butter. Spiliadis didn't change anything of the traditional Greek fish taverna's menu (or Psarotaverna) he just elevated the concept by using the finest ingredients in a nice ambience plus adding the best fish and seafood varieties from all over the world. Today if you see branzino sold in Wholefoods and other stores and consumers buy it to cook at their homes, if almost every restaurant offers whole fish in their menus is because Milos (and subsequently its imitators) educated the consumer to eat grilled whole fish. Just like the Japanese taught the consumers to eat sashimi and sushi. This for the history. As for the restaurant itself it's still the best by far.

5.0,3/19/2016,"Estiatoria Milos opened in 1997 as the off-shoot of a Montreal restaurant. The New York location quickly became the crown jewel of the Milos restaurant collection and the Athens location is sucking wind. C'est la vie...Milos was first to make good 'ole rustic Greek food gourmet. Not because they altered the ageless recipes by much, but because they served the same recipes with the best possible ingredients. This includes fish flown daily from the Mediterranean giving new meaning to 'flying fish.' It's always packed and it is very expensive. Dinner for two with a decent wine will cost you the average monthly payment on a Mercedes E350 lease. And since you can't eat the Benz you may as well shell it out for an exquisite Greek meal at Milos. There's also an army of waiters circling to serve you.    What to order? The overpriced fish of course. I'm partial to the lavraki (Loup de mer or Mediterranean sea bass) It's a lot cheaper than hopping on a plane to Athens and sans the jet lagged. For dessert have the Greek yogurt with all the trimmings and Greek coffee--as Dr. Oz calls it (Greek coffee is actually Turkish coffee).  Oh and try booking a meal on Orthodox Easter eve in order to experience the Easter festivities with about 14 full lambs on the spit roasting for hours on a NYC sidewalk (really).",8,1,3,George M.,"Manhattan, NY",4994,531,706
5.0,3/17/2016,"I have wanted to try Milos ever since it opened many years ago making a furor in the NYC restaurant scene with a fresh fish flown from the Southern Europe.  Back then, the NY culinary scene was only awakening to the concepts that now seem like an everyday occurrence on every corner.  Milos is located in a prime space in Midtown, close to the Carnegie Hall, City Center, Central Park, 5th avenue shopping mecca and numerous financial services institutions that have fat expense accounts to take their clients for fancy lunches.  I was here on a lunch where I had to pay from my own pocket, treating my friend to a birthday lunch.  We went with the lunch pre-fix menu which had a lot of option, a few things had a supplement, but they were worth it.  I went with the grilled octopus for the appetizer, it was served over the yellow peas puree, and my friend ordered the crab cake which came with a remoulade sauce and white beans puree, we shared the apps and both were delicious.  I normally don't like crabcakes but this is because I never had a good one before the one at Milos.  This was so fresh and delicious, wow!  The octopus was outstanding as well.  For the mains, my friend had the dorado fish and I had the shrimp saganaki, also very good.  For the dessert, we had the fresh fruit and the walnut with ice cream cake.  Overall, I paid a bit over $100 for a very nice lunch, but warning, this could be a lot more expensive if you order off the fish menu where it's priced per pound.  The service was very nice as well and the décor is understated elegance.  The place gets filled rather quickly for lunch, mostly, business people.",0,0,0,Baby S.,"Oceanside, NY",0,698,0
4.0,3/13/2016,"Consistently outstanding food and service.  The fish is always extremely fresh (nearly all offerings are flown in from the Mediterranean daily/weekly) and prepared as fresh fish should be: either grilled or baked to highlight the quality and taste of the fish, not a sauce or other distraction.  The Milos special (paper thin slices of zucchini lightly fried and matched with a yogurt and side of cheese), grilled octopus, and stuffed grilled calamari are all excellent appetizer choices.  The entrees change frequently based on the seasonal fish and seafood offering, but if they are available, the scallops and langoustines are amazing compliments to a grilled fish entree. Be warned though, the menu is very expensive. All seafood is charged by the piece (ie, $16 per langoustine) or by weight (fish is usually $50+ per lb). Note that the fish are whole and not yet cleaned when weighed so it is important to order 1-1.5lb fish per person to yield a normal portion once the fish is cleaned and cooked.  Milos is expensive - but this is an outstanding restaurant and well worth it if you are looking for an upscale seafood option.

2.0,1/28/2016,"Where do I start....I came here for 2016 Restaurant week lunch and was really excited due to the really good reviews here. BOY was I disappointed.Where do I even start...I had made a reservation for lunch and even coming 5 minutes late, I still needed to wait 15 minutes for a table. Then after they sat me down, I needed to wait ANOTHER 5 minutes just to see the menu.This place was PACKED, and not in a good way. Suits everywhere. The atmosphere looked like a high-end Greek cafeteria and the service from start to finish showed it.For a $$$$ rating, this place had service that was just a bit TOO fast. It didn't feel high end at all, more like a diner.They take the order... they bring the food.. they bring the check.I took a look at the regular menu for fun. Prices were pretty insane (Did I just see $50 for lamb?)The RW week menu kinda sucked. It was the type you see at a place that really hates restaurant week. You know the one - really underwhelming dishes included in the RW price with $10 supplemental dishes that you would actually WANT to try.It was completely possible to walk away paying $25 for the RW lunch + $10 for an app +$10 for a main course and +$5 for dessert. I'm not stupid so I didn't do that. This is a RW week review for the working-class man.Here's how the dishes were.Mediterranean Meze Plate - basically a hummus sampler plate that came with taramasalata, Tzatziki, hummus, a tiny spinach pie, and some veggies.  Great presentation and taste. Went great with the bread. Be sure to ask for more bread since there is no way you'll have enough for dipping.Complimentary bread - 4 slices of nice toasted Italian bread with olive oil and fresh oregano. Really really awesome. Sadly, along with the hummus sampler, this was the best part of the mealTuna burger with radish salad and fried zucchini sticks - this dish was 90% presentation. It looked fantastic but fell flat. Totally meh. The burger was dry and didn't have enough sauce at all. Worse, is that the zucchini sticks came in the form of those tiny onion strings you put on salad, and you were given only a fork to eat them with. Ugh.Almond Cake with honey glaze and ice cream dessert - Looked great, but very disappointing. I chose this because the other free desserts was a scoop of sherbet or some fruit salad thing. You know when cake dries up and becomes a crumbly mess when you poke it with a fork? That was this. Who knows how many days ago it was made.Overall this Zagat rated, 4.5 trip adviser starred, $$$$ super-high end ""fancy"" restaurant was the type of place you go when you have lots of money and very little ""good sense"".Worst Restaurant Week experience I've had",6,3,0,John Z.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",97,399,266
1.0,1/23/2016,"My husband had hosted a successful business dinner in one of the private dining rooms at Milos and we were eager to try it when we were in NYC on a weeknight in December. Our hotel concierge thought it would be difficult to get a table, but we went early and were seated up front near a window. It's a attractive space, white and modern, and the food was good to quite good, with an emphasis on fresh ingredients, simply but well prepared. We ordered the prix-fixe dinner which was a relative bargain.  HOWEVER, the service was so terrible it was not possible to really enjoy the evening. Our waitress telegraphed her indifference from her first interaction with us. She mixed up ingredients in her description of cocktails and menu items, took a very long time getting our drinks/wine to us and disappeared for longer and longer stretches--disappeared altogether halfway through the meal, so that even though the restaurant was by that time full with people waiting, we were not able to get our check or pay it for quite some time. We are not obvious tourists, not badly behaved or particularly demanding as diners, or quick to take offense--we don't think there was any obvious reason for this waitress to make us feel so unwelcome. It was the worst restaurant service we can remember anywhere.

Many of the items on the menu are flown in directly from the Mediterranean, and the fresh flavors shone in every dish. It may have ""slightly"" helped that my eating partner was Greek and spoke to the chef in Greek before our meal:) The interior decor is a simple wispy white, with a private dining area above the main dining room.If a chef says, ""Let me give you some things to start with"", you should just say ""Yes, thank-you"" and smile. The first appetizer was a simple crab claw, so fresh, tender, and juicy that we did not even taste the sauce on the side. The olive oil for the bread had freshly snipped oregano leaves in it, which the waiter snipped from the tabletop plant before whisking it away.The second appetizer was langoustines served with a brandy shot which the chef said should be used to dunk the heads in before sucking out the insides. We did as we were told after eating the ethereal meat from the tail :) The third appetizer was a stack of lightly fried zucchini chips with a wonderful coarse salt and sour cream center which were so addictive we ""had"" to finish it. After THREE appetizers, the chef chose a fresh branzino, already deboned for us. When he asked the simple question ""Did you want the head?"", I was immediately overjoyed. The fish was simply done with capers and parsley, with nothing masking the purity of fresh fish.Fresh cheese and greek yogurt with honey and fruit to finish the meal, because when you tell the chef that you have no room for dessert, you still receive something :) A bottle of Nichetri wine from Santorini and all this fabulous fresh seafood was over $500 for two with tax and tip, but if you want to taste the best of Greek seafood in the US, it's still less than the price of airfare....",0,0,0,Elaine T.,"El Segundo, CA",91,266,1412

There are private dining spaces which overlook the restaurant that seem like awesome tables.Service:On a Sunday evening, I waited 20 minutes for my table when I had a reservation. No big deal, but there were tables available. They kept pressuring me to wait at the bar when I made it clear that I wasn't drinking.When we were finally seated, I had no clue who our waiter was as multiple people came to the table. No one gave us a menu for quite some time. We opted for the Sunday evening tasting menu and I felt that our waiter was frustrated that we did not order off of the regular menu. The entire evening he gave us a lot of attitude. It was to the point where I became uncomfortable. It was literally one of the worst evenings of service I have ever received while dining in NYC.Food:- Octopus - It was too fried on the outside so all I could taste was the burnt part as it was over powering with flavor.+ Salad - It was great but you can't really mess up a salad with tomato, burrata, onion, and cucumber (I believe those were the only ingredients).+++ Seabass - It was out of this world.

4.0,10/12/2015,"I came here for their $27.50 3-course pre-fixe lunch menu. It was a bit disappointing that so many of their signature dishes (like grilled octopus or lobster pasta) required $10-15 supplementary fee, but there is no doubt that this is among the best value lunch options in Midtown. The scallops appetizer was perfectly cooked - I loved the citrusy flavor and light texture. I got loup de mer for entree, which was some of the best fish I've had in the city. I loved how the dish wasn't over-seasoned so that the flavor of the fish really came out. The portion was quite generous too. I got the strawberry sorbet for dessert, which was a great way to finish off a delicious and satisfying meal. I'm withholding a star despite my overall satisfaction with my meal, because my bf's selections weren't up to par - his chicken breast entree, which was essentially a deconstructed souvlaki, was rather mediocre. He got the walnut cake with vanilla ice cream for desserts, which was too sweet and liquidy for my taste. Nonetheless, Milos is a great option for business lunch and other formal occasions, given its overall high quality of food and nicely decorated, upscale venue. Also, the service staff were fast and attentive despite the fact that it was completely packed by 1pm. I wouldn't say Milos is the best Greek/Mediterranean restaurant I've been to, but it is no doubt a solid option in Midtown.",0,0,1,Elle C.,"Manhattan, NY",21,331,0
4.0,10/11/2015,"My fiancé and I came here to celebrate my birthday. It was a Wednesday night and the restaurant was packed. The coolest part about our experience was the fact that this restaurant ships in fresh fish from Greece twice a day. Does the fish from Greece taste better than fish from here? I'm not sure why they go through such great lengths to get their fish from so far away, but I guess it's a good gimmick. Either way the fact is that you get to walk up to a fish counter, choose whichever fish strikes your fancy, and they will cool it whole for you. The execution was incredibly simple: a fish, some olive oil, parsley, capers. But maybe that's what made it so delicious. When you have such good ingredients simplicity is all you need to make it amazing. In the end, it was one of the best fishes I've ever eaten. But it was also $150 for the fish. And that's just the fish, not including side dishes, appetizers... Worth it? Probably. Would I go again? I have to recover this dent in my bank account first.",0,0,0,Avery W.,"Union City, CA",11,76,86
2.0,10/8/2015,"Food: 3-3.5 (just okay overall), Service: 1 (very poor).  I was very much looking forward to an outstanding meal at Milos.  It was recommended by a friend that travels to New York often and has been there several times.  I specifically asked her because she has excellent taste and we often exchange reviews for ""nicer"" restaurants.  It was quite a disappointment!We made reservations weeks in advance for our final night in NYC.  When we arrived, the greeting by the hostess was fine. Then our server showed us the fresh fish case - wow!!  He recommended a few fish and suggested preparation styles.  Each fish was clearly labeled with price per pound, a normal practice for high end seafood.  We were so excited.When we returned to our table and before we ordered, the server said ""I don't mean this to offend you, but please notice that the fish is priced per pound"" and waited for our reaction.  Incredibly awkward, offensive, and rude.  There's no way anyone would ""stumble"" upon this place and be shocked that it's more expensive.  Between the decor, the labeled prices on the fish themselves, the online $$$$ signs and the clear notes on the menu, there was no need for him to make this statement.We chose 2 glasses of wine and 2 entire fish; the first fish was lithrini, sashimi style.  Half was prepared with thyme, the other with chilis.  Honestly it was some of the best sashimi I've had in my life.  That was the only positive aspect of the meal. (Rating: 5)Our second whole fish, was the turbotine.  It was incredibly bland! (Rating: 2) The fish literally had no flavor!   The only taste came from the capers tossed on top.  We also had the greek salad; the heirloom tomatoes were tasty but overall nothing special (Rating: 3.5).The service was non-existent, or I would have conveyed this message at the restaurant instead of on Yelp.  Our server literally trotted past our table ONCE, craned his neck into our area, said one word ""Good?"" and walked away quickly.My friend was embarrassed and apologetic that her recommendation was such a flop.NOTE: we dined out several times a day during our week in NYC and had excellent service at every other establishment.  In other words, this wasn't an issue with New York overall, just this restaurant.",1,0,1,Milena C.,"Phoenix, AZ",32,20,0
4.0,9/26/2015,"Had lunch at Estiatorio Milos this past Wednesday...here are my thoughts:Ambiance is beautiful. The restaurant reminds me of a slightly older Limani, which is also stunning. Love the open, airy feel. Service wasn't good initially. It took 10 minutes for us to get menus and that was only after we went to the hostess stand to ask for some assistance. After that, however, our server finally arrived and was very nice and attentive. Food came out quickly as well.Food wasn't as good as Avra or Limani, but it was still good for the most part:-- Tomato salad was a highlight. Not sure what they do to the tomatoes but they are just so fresh and delicious. Loved this salad.-- Loup de Mer was just okay. I didn't love it and will probably try the salmon next time.-- Husband had the halibut which was great. The accompanying couscous was dry though, a fresh vegetable would have been a much better option as a side.-- Complimentary bread was delicious - I loved the table side snipping of the (basil?) leaves into the fantastic olive oil.-- Had fresh fruit for dessert, which was refreshing.-- Tea and coffee were well presented and good.Prices are high, probably unnecessarily high. Still, the experience was overall really great and we'll likely return,",2,1,1,Ameena D.,"New York, NY",93,458,0

I had better one in cheaper restaurant.As main course I ordered the big eye Tuna but it was really a big disappointment. It was covered in pepper at the point that you couldn't even taste the real meat. The capers served with it were also so strong that you can not eat both of them together. The tuna was fresh and tender but served at too high temperature and with no flavor at all.I'll definitely try this place again but with way lower expectations.",0,0,0,Andrea B.,"New York, NY",0,84,50

This dish was enormous, but definitely not worth bothering with given how many fresh and flavorful options there are on the menu.  Maryland Crab cake: Excellent. NYC Mediterranean restaurant beating Maryland at it's own game. Beet Salad: The beet salad looked divine, it had both golden and purple beets and was topped with a dollop of soft cheese. I have no idea what it tasted like because it was hoarded at one end of the table.Milos Special: Delicious. The Milos special arrives in a tower, almost like a chain restaurant's onion rings (except like, you actually want to eat these and nobody is yelling about a sportsball game). The tower is lightly fried zucchini and eggplant served with tzatziki and kefalograviera cheese.Greek Fried Potatoes: Skip. I don't know who or why we ordered these, but they ended up on the table when the fish arrived. Fish: you cannot go wrong here ordering fish. The plate we received was beautiful and full of a light, flakey white fish served with lemon and capers. It was phenomenal--and I have no idea which fish it was. Baklava (Layered phyllo with almonds, honey, and cinnamon): this dessert made me change my mind about baklava. I had always disliked baklava (I associated it with being cold and tasting bland).SERVICE: We had a phenomenal waitress who was friendly, funny, and had a variety of recommendations for the follow day's lunch (we were looking for Soba or Yakitori that didn't involve the momofuku hype--and I'm always looking for Boba, so there's that.)",1,0,0,Callie R.,"Portland, OR",57,212,133

4.0,8/11/2015,"Came here with my boy on Sunday for the restaurant week lunch. The restaurant was fancier than I had envisioned and the decor was quite nice. I love seafood and this place has good seafood! There was a case displaying the fresh creatures from the sea that can end up on your plate. For the appetizers, we both ordered the scallops. Two grilled Canadian Scallops served with orange and mint salad (2 mint leaves to be exact). the salad came with the balsamic vinaigrette dressing. I don't normally like scallops but this was delicious - it was slightly sweet in the seafood sweet type of way and the salad was refreshing. Thumbs up. For entree, I got loup de mer and he got tuna burger. Tuna burger came with salad and lightly fried zucchini sticks. It was good but was kind of small. I took one bite of it and went back to my loup de mer. The fish was a very good sized fish. Loup de Mer from the island of Kephalonia was grilled and served with steamed crown broccoli. It was filleted so most of the bones were removed but you still have to be careful as there were some bones in there. The fish was flaky, meaty - not at all like cod but not as dense as swordfish. It was just right for me.  Since the fish was fresh, not much seasoning was needed and the flavoring was perfect. I also ate the cheek meat off the fish head - so good but be aware of some scales. For dessert, I got the walnut cake (aka Karidopita) and he got the (super tart) raspberry sorbet. the sorbet was a bit too tart but the walnut cake with ice cream was delicious! loved it.

4.0,7/17/2015,"If you come here, do it for the food and the atmosphere. This may sound obvious, but if you're not going to eat fish, then this spot isn't for you. That's what they specialize in, and if that's not what you're interested in, you might as well go somewhere else that's cheaper.From the charred bread with olive oil and fresh snipped herbs floating in it, to the last course, every plate will come out with the freshest and tastiest ingredients. The fish is so unbelievably fresh - from the buttery loup de mer, to the delicious crab cake made with fresh Maryland crabs, to the tender and moist grilled octopus (so easy to overcook, but so good when done right).That being said, it can get very expensive. The price fix menu is a great option for $30. I highly recommend the tomato salad with peppers, onions, olives, and feta, or the crab cake ($10 supplemental) as the starter.My only gripe is sometimes the waiters can get a little greedy in a passive-aggressive way - trying to upsell wines (a little uncouth if you ask me, when you're already considering an $80 bottle for lunch), handing out a full menu along with the 3 course menu to everyone at the table during a business lunch, etc. When you're already spending $3-400 on lunch you'd think they wouldn't need to try and juice the bill.",3,2,3,Alex S.,"Jersey City, NJ",173,393,48

There's always something interesting about seeing this moving and then not with a fried breading suit five minutes later. Crisply succulent, those are the best words to describe.The Carabinieros - These prawns are insane. They're served with a shot of sherry for the juices with the head. I'd imagine if I came back at the helm of an oil empire in my next life, I would be sitting on my yacht with a bucket of these.Loup de mer or Lavraki - This was very fresh and delicious.

5.0,2/20/2015,"Consistent and simple.  Milos can get away with $$$$ for this along with its reputation only because of the fact that it takes good ingredients and consistently does not F**k it up and make it taste the way good food should. Whenever I see artistic license and too many ingredients on a menu, I worry.  The fish is served whole, and it's fresh, seasoned simply and well. The greek salad, wow, I NEVER taste tomatoes like that in NYC. The Milos special....YES, this is how you fry. High end fried food should never be soggy or greasy. It's like wispy fried clouds of smoke where the fried nature of the thing you are eating ceases it's fried existence in the way a ring of smoke just magically dissipates.  It's so sad that we F up good, simple food so hard that I'm over here creaming myself over a restaurant that charges an arm and a leg for simply having good sense when it comes to food.",0,1,0,Jeanne C.,"New York, NY",100,140,170

5.0,2/16/2015,"This was my first time at Milo's and it was quite the dining experience. In order for me to write a 5 star review there are three things that need to happen:1. Great food (not only tasty but also comes out hot)2. Great service3. A nice restaurant that provides a great dining experience.Milo's exceeded these requirements and provided an excellent dining experience.First, we were greeted by our server and he suggested we go up with him to the display of fish and specials of the night. He explained that all the fish were fresh and shipped daily. You could see that it really was fresh because he poked some lobsters and they started moving...We then sat back down at the table and ordered our food. To start we shared the Greek salad and the eggplant and zucchini chips. Both starters were delicious, the salad tasted fresh and the chips came out hot and crispy with a tasty tzatziki sauce to dip.For the main course I ordered the seared tuna steak. The dish was presented nicely and the tuna was very tender. It came with a side of spinach and some other vegetables. I was very satisfied with my meal.The others with me ordered the lamb chops and king prawns. We also split an order of Greek fries for the table, which were great.Overall, this was one of the top dining experiences I have had in New York City. I would definitely return again to celebrate a certain occasion or bring guests from out of town. For most people who are on a budget, like myself, this is not a place you frequent too often, since it is pretty expensive. Luckily, I had some family in town and was treated to this great meal. I will be back to try some other dishes that they offer.",0,0,0,Nicolas M.,"New York, NY",501,9,2

We always have celebrity sighting here and this night didn't disappoint. The Langoustine appetizer was tender and sweet....the shaved lightly fried zucchini with tadziki .... And the fluke lightly seared in olive oil , salt and pepper... All made simply but off the chart fresh and savory. We left feeling satisfied but not stuffed.

4.0,2/4/2015,"I came here with some friends before a Broadway show on a Friday evening at 6pm. The space is quite large with their infamous fresh fish/shellfish display toward the back of the restaurant near the line. After being seated (only 3 of the 4 of us were there at our reservation time - so I was glad they allowed us to sit all the same) we were given the somewhat confusing a la carte menu in addition to the prix fix menu for pre-theater guests. We ordered a bottle of wine and perused our options. Once our fourth party member arrived, we ended up deciding to all order form the prix fix (4 course for $49!) menu and add an additional item to be shared by the table from the a la carte menu per one of our many server's suggestions.From the prix fix - I had their well-known grilled octopus appetizer which was well portioned and perfectly cooked discs served with capers. Then we all had their salad course which is similar to a shepherd's salad - that of a mix of tomatoes, onions, feta and olives which I could just eat for days! For my main course I had their simply grilled whole loup de mer fish which was flaky and moist and done with lemon and herbs. For dessert I ordered the sorbet but only had a bite as we were drastically late at this point. The additional course we ordered (which I believe to be the hold up on our table and what caused us to be so stressed out from our salad course onward) was a sashimi of wild king salmon topped with fresno chili, shallot and cilantro. That was literally delectable. I want to go back just to eat that all over again (and perhaps have someone else pay for it!). The main gripe that I have with our meal was that the team in charge of our table knew we needed to leave by 7:30 so we could get to our 8pm show. We ordered from the prix fix menu which is designed for that purpose (and actually quite an amazingly inexpensive and very filling option for the minimal price of $49 in midtown). We asked if adding the sashimi course would take too much time and they said no. Sadly, this was not the case and we ended up leaving at about 7:50 and almost missing the curtain on the show merely due to no one being around to swipe our credit cards or even bring us the bill in the first place. I realize it was a Friday night and the place packed up between the time we arrived and had to leave, but for such a high end restaurant to somewhat fall off the ladder, service wise, once our entrees arrived was really unfortunate and it caused us to leave with a bad taste in our mouths.",3,0,0,Lindsey S.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,158,592

This is defiantly a client friendly restaurant - black cars pulling up and the suits pouring in by the minute.  Allegedly, they have a 3-course prefix lunch menu for $25.00. However, to get the more appetizing items on this menu, you have to + a surcharge. I went with the octopus, lamb chops and karidopita. Overall, the food was really good and the service better than expected for the volume of people being served. Would suggest that you expect to burn two hours from start to finish for a lunch date. The octopus started the lunch wonderfully. Lamb chop on the other hand was a bit too charred, but nothing the knife couldn't resolve. Now, the moment of truth - yes, the dessert menu was up to par.

2.0,1/9/2015,"I went here about a year ago on Valentine's Day and just recently signed up for a yelp account. I thought of this place almost immediately to write a review on and not in a good way. What can I say? The decor is very nice and I love the fact that they have all the fish out and you can go and choose whichever one you prefer. It is a bit loud but not really something I mind but if you want to have a nice conversation or your on a first date I wouldn't recommend it, as it is a little tough to hear. I think the concept is great and definitely one of a kind. As for the service and price was my biggest problem. We were seated right away but we also had reservations and that's about the only thing good about the service I can say. Right from the beginning we felt forgotten and invisible. We sat there for a while before I asked one of the waiters for a menu and he went and got our server. Our server was not a pleasant man and didn't seem that he liked his job very much but I think he saw this young couple sitting and figured that we probably weren't going to tip that good or we wouldn't care how were served because maybe we were inexperienced in fine dining. Our waiter was not attentive. We had to call him over when we were ready to order and when were done eating. And another thing that may seem small but are the type of things that make you feel forgotten was that every female received a box with what must've been a little trinket inside and a rose that was brought by their servers but ours did not. Again, it's something little but would've made my girlfriend smile and in turn made me more satisfied with the service. As for the food I had the shrimp for an appetizer which was good but nothing memorable as it was just grilled shrimp with some very little seasoning. I had the loup de mer since it was very highly spoken of and my girlfriends I can't remember but I know it had boiled lobster. The food wasn't bad at all and everything was cooked very nicely but not for the price. I ended up paying about $360 FOR TWO PEOPLE!! And gave the waiter almost a $70 tip very stupidly and had to hear about it the whole way home because it was way too much for the service that he gave us but I always tip 20% because I'm too embarrassed at looking at the waiter when he picks up the check if I put anything less. And it's not even about the price because I've paid the same before in other restaurants, it's just about the the quality of service and food in comparison to the price. The loup de mer was very fresh and grilled well but again very little seasoning and nothing memorable. The best thing about it was the olive oil that was very delicious. And the lobster in the end was just boiled lobster but it's lobster so you have to expect top dollar especially when it's fresh. I've read other reviews and maybe I just wasn't lucky but I suggest if you go there proceed with caution and a heavy pocket because in my opinion it's not worth it. Maybe if the service actually did what they were supposed to do I would've had a different opinion but from the moment we sat down we couldn't help see flaws because of how bad the service was.",0,0,0,Danny F.,"Union, NJ",182,6,1

4.0,1/4/2015,"""Wonderful (but proceed with caution)""Upon arrival, Our group of 8 was told we would have to wait nearly an hour past our reservation time - and we were immediately motioned to the bar for cocktails (which we ordered) - but given that the restaurant clearly had available tables, and our reservation was for 9pm, a one hour wait was not welcome news, even by NY standards. Our host took generous care of the hostess - and voila, we were seated within 5 minutes, passing 2 other tables of similar size on the way... perhaps the way of the world - but in this case, it felt more like extortion....The restaurant is fabulously designed, vibrant and loud - which of course can be stimulating - but at that hour, with a group of 8 - it made any conversation difficult. We quickly realized we could only speak to the person on either side - and thoughout the meal, comments and conversation were repeated seat to seat : ""Bob said....then Liz said.....""  Not a complaint - just a fair warning..The waiter seemed tired - quite distant - possibly burned out a bit -  that, given the noise, he had to repeat information again and again as the table could not hear information he gave. Despite wanting to ask his advise, I instead made decisions and gave my order as if responding to an oral quiz in grade school - -quickly and to the point - hoping for the best. The food was outstanding - and with the understanding that this is a very unique menu and preparation - with some of the fish etc available only in the region in and around Greece - the prices are understandable - but be cautious. My advice is to especially enjoy the items you cannot get anywhere else in NY Our group understood this and came with no thoughts of budget - we had a grand time sharing multiple appetisers, followed by several courses each, plus dessert - - it was a most memorable experience - one to be remembered - though we understood that we purchased an experience centered on a great meal. It would have been nice to have felt even a bit less invisible by staff however. they ignored us - (though they were certainly acknowledged generously for their professional order taking, food delivery and plate removal.",2,0,0,LD M.,"Saint Simons Island, GA",118,35,1

4.0,12/27/2014,"Estiatorio Milos is a really nice change of pace from the typical Italian pre-theatre /  theatre district faire.  While I like Italian food, I like Greek even better, and while I like Italian food, my daughter has some issues that would be better served by not eating it.  Thus, Estiatorio turned out to be a very pleasant dining experience.It was a very open and airy dining area with a cool vibe..... and I mean that both literally and figuratively.... the heating system wasn't working on the very cold day we were there, and sitting relatively close to the door made it somewhat colder than usual.  Still and all, the restaurant itself was ""cool"" in a trendy way, too.  There was also a VERY large and impressive display of fresh fish on ice.  When I eyed that, I was hoping it was as good tasting as it looked impressive.One could order from the prix fixe menu or off the regular menu.  We ordered from their prix fixe as we found items that interested us, and it was definitely cheaper that way.  I honestly didn't investigate the regular menu to know what was on it, or what else we could have gotten. Known for their fresh fish/seafood (and also if their display was any indication), we ordered the grilled octopus appetizer, which was very tasty.  We then had their version of a Greek salad, which came with a slab of feta cheese, some salad veggies and a kalamata olive, mixed in a very light Greek vinaigrette.  I ordered their lamb chops as an entrée, while my daughter ordered the salmon.  They both came with a broccoli and cauliflower florette  Neither my husband nor I remember what he ordered as an entrée.  (Oops)  The lamb was definitely tasty, but it wasn't the best on earth, either.  I enjoyed it, though... don't get me wrong.  Nothing we ordered was drowning in any dressings, sauces or oils...... all very light faire.  Finally, our meal came with dessert, but we were full and opted out of that choice of walnut cake or baklava.I would definitely come back here for a pre-theatre dinner and perhaps order something off their regular menu next time.  While our dishes were good, and we found things we wanted, the offerings were far more limiting that way.",3,1,1,Claudia B.,"Simi Valley, CA",1144,1299,6819

I never go in here in anything less than business formal. Amazing aesthetic, love the open space and high ceilings. Like a really open and airy loft space. Really loud too which I don't mind. Food: their lunch specials are really great which I have ordered many times or lately I am just ordering off the regular menu. I had the oysters (waiters pick) and they were amazing (okay I really did miss the tabascco but I didn't ask for it). I always try and order fish since that is what they are known for and they do a great job. Service: I think it's really good although slightly cold. Hence 4 stars instead of 5 but still really good and attentive. Hostess is always really friendly and accommodating. Cost: expensive so definitely a T&E restaurant but worth it.

Our main course were the ""carabineros"" something I would describe as a shrimp and a lobster together but better than both. Very flavorful.

5.0,9/18/2014,"Upscale Greek seafood restaurant with some of the freshest fish in manhattan.  Large selection of fish and shellfish flown in daily from the Mediterranean.  Grilled octopus was phenomenal as an appetizer.  Sides were also prepared simply but very fresh and flavorful.  Price is definitely high but is expected due to locale, large fresh fish offering, and upscale but intimate environment with just the right amount of liveliness from the waiters and the patrons.  Waiters are very good personable and eager to please.  Also very flexible as far as what they are willing to do with sides to make you happy.  Highly recommend.",0,0,0,Anthony M.,"West Hempstead, NY",7,23,30
5.0,9/17/2014,"Nothing short of spectacular. It has been many years since I've dined at Milos  (I no longer live in Manhattan and if craving Greek seafood have more recently been going to nearby Molyvos or Avra on the East side), but am I sure glad I went there last evening with a friend who was visiting from Southern California. We arrived at 6:15, were greeted at the giant glass doors, directed inside and promptly seated. As expected, the restaurant was buzzing even at this early hour...after all, it is smack in the middle midtown manhattan and the location of Milos is just too convenient to ignore. A quick word on ambience: the white umbrellas and contemporary furniture/place settings paired with the open floor plan and high ceilings give this place a lovely airy feel..minus all of the suits, you can certainly envision being at the Greek Isles. The place was so busy that we ended up at a two top tucked into one of the tiny corners adjacent to one of the waitstaff stations. Despite the less than ideal table location, we had a beautiful view of the dining room and the stunning fish display on ice toward the back. Our server was so attentive, recommended a lovely Greek white wine by the glass (similar to a Sancerre), filled our glasses with sparkling water and brought plenty of limes/lemons as requested. Upon his recommendation, we opted for the grilled octopus as well as the grilled mushrooms. He poured olive oil into a dish and tore some fresh tarragon leaves off the beautiful bunch of herbs on the table. A nice touch if you like to indulge in fresh bread dipped in olive oil. Then we were escorted over to the fish display where he walked us through some of the more special sea creatures they had for the evening. (Branzino, langoustines, Louvraki etc) Since my friend is from the west coast, we naturally wanted something we don't often see and settled on the Sea Bream which hails from the Mediterranean. They weigh the fish right there for you so no surprises when you the bill arrives, which is definitely driven by the hefty price tag on the fish based on price per pound. We ordered a side of sautéed Horta (leafy greens which remind me of a hybrid of escarole/spinach). I did remind our server that we were headed to a Broadway show and that we needed to be on our way by 7:40. He assured me that was no problem. Our appetizers arrived quickly and we feasted on the most supple and perfectly charred octopus I've eaten in quite a while. The array of grilled mushrooms was knock your socks off wonderful. So flavorful, plump and juicy. Our white flaky fish was prepared simply grilled with olive oil, lemon and capers and served filleted.  Just a few small bones to pick through, but quite delicious. We were going to skip dessert but something about the baklava spoke to my friend.This is NO ordinary baklava. (I don't even like tradition baklava) The pastry was a giant triangle which nearly resembled a slice of cake. The crushed nuts tightly packed and layered at the bottom made for the most amazing crust. All topped with airy layers of phylo. The honey was so light this dessert wasn't even remotely gooey, just perfectly sweet enough to enjoy. Our coffee was also yummy and they accommodated our requests for half caff/half decaf. Just a perfect dining experience as we headed off to the show. Oh Milos, how I missed you. Highly recommend for any occasion....just expect super high prices which reflect superior food, impeccable service all in a modern elegant setting.",3,0,0,Shari A.,"Livingston, NJ",60,254,326
1.0,9/6/2014,Appalling. Waiter showed us the fish 'market' and read the signs to us. Thanks but remarkably I can read. Another waiter served warm white wine. Solution: put it in an ice bucket with little ice. Finally demanded a fresh bottle of cold wine which finally came. Food was ok but cold cooked fish not inspiring. Another waiter faltered and dropped a full glass if red wine next to us. A patron nearly gouged her eye out on a dangerously low sun umbrella.

We ended up with too much food that, frankly, tasted bland and uninspired. After our waiter showed us the array of fish on ice, we asked him for more specific suggestions about fish selection and preparation; he shrugged and said ""it's all up to personal preference."" Our preference will be not to return to this restaurant.We don't mind expensive restaurants if we feel that we've eaten fabulous food and had stellar service.

The main feature on the menu is seafood, with a few other selections like lamb chops, and filet mignon. Within the restaurant there is an ice display out in the open of all the fresh fish and seafood on the menu...quite unique.For our appetizers we ordered the Milos special (Lightly fried zucchini and eggplant with the best tzatziki dipping sauce I have ever had) and the Sardines. Both were excellent choices, and the Milos special is a must have. For the main course I ordered the grilled Halibut, and my wife had the Salmon. Each was the best tasting and quality entree I have had of these 2 fish from any restaurant we have eaten at....and that is saying alot considering we try to experience the best food we can at 4 and 5 diamond quality restaurants on each vacation we take, and have eaten at many seafood restaurants. The dessert was also excellent, so try an save room for it. We had the custard with layered filo crust (Galaktoboureko.) If you like to enjoy quality food, Milos is a must when visiting NYC.

5.0,7/2/2014,"Came here for a lovely lunch with one of our vendors during the Promax conference/eating & drinking tour of the city. The open decor with its high ceilings and patio-style umbrellas made it feel like we were enjoying lunch on an outdoor European terrace vs. just outside the streets of NY.For my prix-fixe selections, my first course was the greek salad (less salad, more like a few tomatoes and giant chunks of feta and onions) in one of those really fancy bowls that take up a lot of room but hold a small portion. The second course was the Loup de mer which was a whole filled slice of fish heaven drizzled with olive oil and adorned with fresh herbs and lemon. Tasted like it was caught that morning. My dessert was greek yogurt with honey - a nice finish to a meal that I'd call simple but divine.Service was excellent and attentive to our table of 10+.

The space is beautiful, clean and upscale but lacks the cozy ambiance that reminds me of Greece. The only have a $25 lunch prix-fixe menu, I had the tomato & feta salad/lobster pasta which already ended up being too much for me. The tomato salad was not impressive. The lobster pasta had a low-cal pasta option which I chose and it was actually quite good. They don't skimp on the lobster here, which is good considering they charge an extra $15 for it. My motive in ordering it was to compare it to the seafood pasta dishes I had in Greece which were unbelievably good.

2.0,5/11/2014,"First, as I realized that we would be early for our reservation, I called from the car and asked if the maitre d would have any accommodations. Not only was the receptionist completely unhelpful. Her telephone manners were HORRENDOUS - after denying us any accommodations for an early arrival, she would not recommend a nearby cafe as an alternative, even though one was right next door. Once we sat down to our meal, the service felt uncoordinated throughout. There were several stretches of time, when one or more of us did not have a plate after a fresh course is served. My water was refilled once and only after request. I understand it may have been busy for Mother's Day, but again, this is not the typical service I have experienced at similar restaurants. I ordered langoustines for the table. One of the langoustines was rotten to the point that the flesh had DECOMPOSED and no longer had the texture of fresh langoustine. No one is here for the culinary techniques, the preparations are simple - people come for fresh seafood. This is not acceptable. Although it was quickly replaced but nothing was offered to offset this horrible flaw to our meal. I don't want to sound like a snob here, but to offer $25 lunch prix fixe as a regular option every day is detrimental to everything except for the revenue - if the place was seriously struggling to fill tables without. There's no such thing as democratizing an experience because it's just an euphemism for downgrading the experience wholesale. Why should I come to a restaurant serving seafood at over $100 a pound and have to share the service with someone eating three courses for $25? If I pay 4x as much for my meal, should I expect 4x as much? Should it be a sliding scale? Why do I feel like I'm subsidizing the $25 with the extraordinary margin on my food?

This is the way I would describe it: ""The cupcakes"" in this place are great.  But $10 for a cupcake, its too much!  There are dozens of bakeries where i can get the same great ""cupcake"" for only $5!  I'm using this metaphor to give you an example of how we felt after our dinner.  This place is simply overpriced.  A dinner  at Jean Gorge is less expensive and honestly you cannot compare them.  Jean George is far superior.Service:Average.  Our waiter was trying to upsell and a sommelier at the same time.  He was only able to describe the wine selections with two adjectives, ""good"" and ""bad"". Can you guess which of those two words I would use to describe our waiter?  I'll give you a hint.  It doesn't start with the letter ""g"".Conclusion:I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  I might return if someone invites me but then again pretentious restaurants are not my style.",1,1,0,Anna M.,"New York, NY",2,13,1

The Branzino was very very well executed. The walnut cake was utterly delicious. The tomato salad I had was ordinary. This is not a place that skimps terribly for restaurant week. All in all, this was a great experience for $36/pp (after tax, tip, and a coffee). For roughly $130 a head I recall it being when I went full price for lunch with my parents, it's complete waste of money and there are infinite better places in nyc for that price.Also, I will note that the waiters weren't just pissed it was restaurant week, they were SUPER pissed.

4.0,2/21/2014,"Just had a fantastic restaurant week pre fixe lunch here with my dad. I was pretty skeptical about restaurant week pre fixes, as they can be rushed and not the best quality. This meal completely disproved that! First of all, the atmosphere is really nice. Very airy, with incredibly high ceilings, an open kitchen, and a bar area with an indoor 'patio' complete with umbrella seats. Seafood is displayed on ice. It has an appropriately mediterranean feel. After being seated, I opted for a glass of greek white wine: the Assyrtico (Areti) for $16/glass. A bit on the pricey side, but that goes with the territory. It was nice. crisp, dry, and easy, though nothing outstanding. Next, our waiter placed the bread basket before us, and poured some olive oil into a dish. He then took a fresh oregano plant from the table, and cut a few leaves over the olive oil. The flavor of the fresh oregano in the olive oil was incredible, though the bread was some simply grilled white bread, nothing special. For the appetizer, I for the meze plate: hummus ,taramasalata, tzatziki, a mini triangle of spanakopita, and some radishes, cucumbers, and olives. The hummus was the perfect balance of chickpea, tahini, and olive oil. The olive oil was some of the best i've tasted, and shined throughout the dishes, especially the hummus. It added a perfect nuttiness and fruity quality. The taramasalata was fluffy, and had an incredibly silky texture as if it had been whipped.  It was garnished with two single capers. The tzatziki was nice too; thick and extremely rich. The spanakopita was buttery and decadent, the phyllo crumbling perfectly in my mouth. It was also the perfect size; two bites were enough to appreciate the richness without being overwhelmingly heavy. My dad ordered the two grilled scallops atop an orange and mint salad. I tried a bite, and they were perfectly cooked. For our entrees, I for the grilled salmon with steamed broccoli. and my dad had the grilled loupe de mer (a branzino), which also came with steamed broccoli. I loved how simply both dishes were prepared, the freshness of the fish highlighted. Both were very large portions, the loupe de mer an entire fish, butterflied, and the salmon was probably five to six ounces. I could have definitely been satisfied splitting the salmon, and for $25 in a prix fixe this was a steal! For dessert, I ordered the fresh fruit, while my dad got the walnut cake. The fresh fruit included two slices of grapefruit, an orange slice, and some berries. The walnut cake was honey soaked; extremely moist and flavorful. We also got some coffee at the end of the meal, which was surprisingly good!This was one of the best meals i've had in awhile, and an outstanding deal for the prix fixe. I can't wait to go back. I also really need to copy down the name of that olive oil, so I can pick some up for myself!",5,0,0,Sarah G.,"Brooklyn, NY",305,102,10
4.0,2/17/2014,Great restaurant if you can score a seat. You'll need a deep pocket to dine here. $50+ entrees and $15-$20 apps. The fresh fish market is pretty cool (pick your fish you want to eat) with fish supposedly flown in from Europe. But you're going to pay a premium. We had the Branzino which was excellent.  We has several of the apps and sides and I can't say I had one that I didn't like. Bread basket was strangely over toasted and practically burnt but that was the only negative.  Other than we probably averaged $150pp with dessert and no drinks.

Fresh fish sashimi (not the common fish you can find on the market or restaurant) - I am a huge sashimi fan, can't believe the fish was so creamy and fresh, never had that from any Japanese sushi place. 2. Porched fish - it was a big fish, big enough to feed 6 people, meat was so tender and juicy, so different from those pan friends or grilled fish.  3 Grilled lamb chops - Greek restaurant makes great lamb meats - no doubt about that.

Made with the freshest crabmeat from Maryland's blue crabs. Now this is a crab cake, not a crab cake that is mixed with too much breading. This crab cake actually contained crab. Really good.Loup de Mer from the island of Kephalonia, grilled, served with steamed crown broccoli. Yummy and not at all fishy. Shrimp Saganaki with cous cous - The shrimp were a really good size, not colossal, but decent in terms of a size of a shrimp. But the shrimp with the sauce, just tasted very bland. Actually, I couldn't taste any flavour at all.Karidopita - The walnut cake with lavender ice cream. I was hesitant about this, since I am not sure how I feel about a walnut cake. I like walnuts, but as a cake, would I enjoy it? I also hate my food to taste like flowers, but the lavender ice cream wasn't overpowering and did not have a flowery taste.Baklava - Z loves baklava, I tasted it, and I definitely didn't like it. I don't like the texture of baklava and also it is super heavy.5 stars for the crab cake and the Loup de Mer, but I have to say our waiter was a bit arrogant.I have been to better restaurants than this place, and never once did any of those waitstaff acted in any pretentious way.

The table ordered the fried zucchini and eggplant starter which was great. For my main, I got the tuna burger...and since this is a fish place I anticipated some beautiful ahi filet, left just pink enough in the middle, with some refreshing minty sauce of some sort. I've had it this way at other places and I was really craving it. However, what I got was something that you probably wouldn't even feed to your cat. It was a hard brown brick on a really unimpressive bun. It was so dry and salty I felt bloated the whole rest of the day. It was really a disaster...I was so hungry that I ate it...and I was also at a business lunch so I didn't want to be obnoxious and send it back. It also came with some fried zucchini strips that were SO greasy. For dessert, I ordered the fruit, and got literally 3 slices of orange on a plate. Really weird.

4.0,9/5/2013,"Definitely a place to check out if you like high end Greek food.   I came with my husband and some of his family before a Broadway show, and we all had the pre-theater menu for $49.  You get 4 courses on this menu and it costs less than all but one entree, so its a very good deal compared to the a la carte pricing.  The first course is a choice of grilled octopus, grilled vegetable plate or a dish with a crab cake and a grilled shrimp.  I had the crab cake (gave the shrimp to my husband because I don't eat it) and it was really good.  Others who had the grilled octopus spoke very highly of it.  The second course (no choice) is a tomato salad.  It had chunks of tomato, fresh feta, and cucumber slices, with a seasoned olive oil on top.  It was good too but by this point I had already started getting full.  The 3rd course was a choice of salmon, sea bass (whole) or lamb chops.  The men at our table all had the sea bass and the women all had the salmon.   The salmon was fine but a little boring - it was just  plain grilled with broccoli on the side, not much in the way of seasoning or sauce.   I thought the sea bass was more creative, but I really don't like eating whole fish.   Dessert didn't have anything that sounded very appealing to this chocoholic - choices were fresh fruit plate, sorbet, and walnut cake with honey lavender ice cream.  I had the cake, and to my surprise, I loved it.  The cake itself was good, but the honey lavender ice cream was out of this world - some of the best ice cream I've ever had.    Also, the bread they serve before the meal is toasted and very good, and it comes with really high quality extra virgin olive oil (this might be why I was full on the second course)Service was very friendly and extremely attentive.   Apparently they also have locations in Montreal, Athens, Vegas and Miami - kind of a weird assortment of places.   Perhaps the most interesting thing about this restaurant is that they have a selection of fish on ice and if you order a whole fish you get to go over there and point to the fish you want.",2,0,1,A M.,"West Lafayette, IN",856,1301,8

The standouts were the octopus and scallops. The grilled octopus is indeed divine and worth every penny, but not the best I've had in New York or even Manhattan. My scallop appetizer contained only two scallops, but they were cooked perfectly and accompanied with a refreshing citrus sauce/salad.  The problem is the service and the noise. Other reviews are correct, it does get quite noisy in there. The servers, while nice and fairly coordinated (there is a lot of waitstaff), aren't very attentive and the food comes out at a glacial pace. You're not assigned one server, but your section is assigned a few and they coordinate among themselves.

4.0,8/8/2013,"Estiatorio Milos is an upscale yet chic Greek restaurant in Midtown specializing in the freshest of seafood. In full disclosure, this restaurant (including our party) seems dominated by expense accounts. This can clearly be seen in the prices, which seem exorbitant if you're dining on your own dime. That said, the food, service, and ambiance are all excellent. We started with some spreads, grilled octopus and a bottle of greek wine kindly recommended by our waitress. The octopus was outstanding and highly recommended. The spreads were good, but likely because the freshly toasted bread is delicious. I'd suggest skipping the dips and focusing on the free bread with a splash of olive oil and salt. For our entree, we shared two types of fish: lavraki and a Mediterranean snapper. They were both excellent, but I particularly enjoyed the richness and fattiness of the lavraki. Portions are large (since its the entire fish) and can easily be shared. They divide portions up for you, which is helpful. I'd recommend snagging the fish head, as it contains some of the tastiest meat on the fish. We were so full from the bread, wine, and large portions of fish that we bypassed dessert.If you work in Manhattan or are traveling in for work, consider Estiatorio Milos for a nice client meal or celebration.

Maybe it's because I didn't order the loup de mer, but all the menu choices should be amazing, and frankly, they weren't.Thank goodness for restaurant week (although I'm not sure if the $25 pre-fixe for lunch is always available). The scallops were very good in flavor and texture.  Quality control is an issue though, as I had a large scallop and a small one, and my lunch companion got two large scallops and a lot more leafy/fruit things on her plate when compared to mine. You can't send the same dish to two or more people at a table and not expect them to compare such an obvious size/quantity difference!We got an order of the crab cake ($32!!!!) and the squid ($20+) for the table. The squid was really yummy, had a nice char in some areas, and a BBQ flavor in other sections. Not chewy, quite nice. The crab cake was a disappointment. It just wasn't that good. It wasn't bad... but I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it - yes, you only get one, not very large cake. Relatively, the portion size for the squid was very large, and was easily shared by the table.I got the jumbo shrimp for an entree... yeah, these babies weren't jumbo anything. Covered in a fresh tomato sauce, with some cous cous (bland) on the side. I was disappointed, and congratulating myself on ordering the extra appetizers to share, as my portion size was TINY!  My companions both ordered the loup de mer, and enjoyed them, although be careful - there are bones up top near the head.Dessert was very enjoyable - I got the walnut cake (it has a fancy name starting with the letter K), which came with an ice cream (I couldn't identify the flavor, but it wasn't straight up vanilla). Service was quick, because we asked for it to be, and we were able to leave by the time we needed to get back to the office. The noise level is really loud though, so it was hard to have a decent conversation unless you were willing to be loud about it. My water was mostly refilled in a timely manner, and the bathrooms were decently clean and spacious. It ended up being $60+ per person w/ the extra appetizers, but I left feeling vaguely disappointed with the value of the meal, even though the food was ok.

4.0,6/24/2013,"In short, this place serves some of the freshest, well prepared seafood in the city.I came here for a non-date-turned-date dinner on Wed night around 9 pm. It was a full house. The host and the receptionist were not very welcoming. But we got the table after a glass of champagne and about 30 mins. No more complaint. Upon our being seated, the chef came to our table and introduced herself. We then followed her to the seafood market - there were mountain of fresh fish and shell fish! One can choose their fish and decided how it was cooked. We took the scallops, the whole seabass to split. We also ordered a Greek salad to balance the meal. It was fresh and healthily delicious! While we were finishing the salad, the scallops were ready. It was almost as big as my palm. I believe the chef turned off the heat right before it was fully cooked. So it stayed juicy and soft. When the fish is fresh, the best way to cook it is keeping it simple - grill. Moments later, came the grilled whole sea bass, boned. It was so meaty and scrumptious and fresh! I could taste the sea water in its flesh!  We also got a bottle of Piniot Grigio from Piedmont, Italy. Perfect to accompany our grilled fish. The dinner finished with a doppio.

4.0,6/2/2013,"Power lunching options are generally limited to a five general categories in midtown - French bistro, steakhouse, sushi, Italian trattoria or seafood. Milos offers a slight variation on the above themes with a Mediterranean seafood menu. Better yet,  the prix fixe lunch options are just $25, served an a bright, high-ceiling atmosphere that is both refined yet still appropriate for the post-Bear Stearns age of moderate austerity. Food tends to be a secondary consideration at a place like this, as really I imagine very few people are eating here at midday strictly for pleasure. Reservations need to be honored, coats quickly checked and the service attentive enough to move as fast or slow as the business demands. Milos succeeds here on all counts, providing very professional and technically proficient service in one of the region's larger dining rooms. The food, thankfully, is up to snuff as well. Scallops are nice and meat with a small orange and mint salad to alternate the flavors. Main course options include a tuna burger, lamb chop and chicken brochette, along with a very delicious looking lobster pasta that carries a $15 surcharge. I went with the salmon, which presented simply brought out the quality of the piece of fish.The portions were so generous that my party skipped out on the included desert course, even though one there was a  fresh fruit option.

3.0,5/16/2013,"Milos offers good but plain food. If you enjoy eating a filet of fresh fish grilled with just a little olive oil and nothing else on it but a squeeze of lemon then this is a place for you. Unfortunately, I prefer my food to have a little more pizzaz so I was somewhat underwhelmed with my Seabass. My husband ordered the lamb chops and he thought that they were also cooked well but somewhat plain. We came here before a show at Carnegie Hall and I had selected this place because they had a pre-theater pre-fixe menu that seemed like it was a good deal and likely to get us to the show on time. But that also meant our options were limited. So maybe if we tried some other options we would have been happier, I don't know. I did enjoy looking at the display with all the fresh seafood on ice in the back by the kitchen.In spite of being disappointed with the food, I really liked the look of the place; there was a lot of white washing going on that evoked a Greek vibe without being kitchy. The restaurant looked pretty elegant but still felt comfortable. The service was a bit stuffy, though. We had about five different people waiting on us, one to take our orders, one to pour the wine, one to pour the water, one to bring us our plates, and another to take them away.

4.0,5/1/2013,"Immediately after you walk through the revolving doors, you begin to question whether you are in Manhattan or the Mediterranean. The restaurant is adorned with marble and displays fresh seafood packed in ice in the main dining room. I endorse Milos for serving the most delectable octupus, that I have tried, on the Atlantic Ocean. The chef chargrills it and serves it with olive oil, onions, and capers. For those of us ballin on a budget, I would not suggest coming to Milos at just anytime as the prices are steep. Instead, I highly recommend dining at Milos when you can order off of the pre/post theater menu, which is served between 5:00-6:30 & 10:00-11:30 Monday to Saturday and Sunday from 5:00-10:45. You can order one first course (don't fret..choices include the octupus), a tomato & cucumber salad, a main course, and a dessert. The meal boasts of choices to guarantee an authentic Greek meal, created using the freshest ingredients, at the affordable price of $49.00. For those of you with the cash flow to deviate from the theater menu, I still recommend the theater menu. I think the octupus, tomato salad, loup de Mer, and walnut cake (or fresh fruit, depending on your appetite after the first three courses), all included on the theater menu, are the best plates that the restaurant offers.

Major pet peeve of mine: when a restaurant serves stale bread. I mean, if you're looking to turn me off quickly at the start of my meal, that's what you would do. Too many places are guilty of this. I'd rather you not serve any bread at all. The bread at Milos had a good crust and soft inside, fresh and served with olive oil with fresh cut herb. Major plus!And the sorbet... Oh delicious strawberry sorbet. Maybe it was just what I was craving but it really hit the spot and was a beautiful conclusion to our lunch.Next time, I'll be as well dressed as the next and ready to spoil my tastebuds!",2,1,3,Chui L.,"Little Neck, Queens, NY",167,92,138

1.0,2/15/2013,"This place is a joke! Everything served is priced so aggressively high that it becomes the main topic of conversation: ""can you believe that a humble Greek salad can be $28?"" How good can a combination of two tomatoes, two triangles of low quality feta, five slices of a cucumber and some red onion taste in order to warrant that price tag? Fish decently cooked, no sides or anything to enhance the flavor besides two lonely capers and a sliver of lemon. Wait staff is largely Russian, Indian and Mexican. Since I speak one of the languages and my wife another, we engaged the staff in casual conversation and even they were making fun of the ridiculous prices and were irreverent to the management. No pride in working there, they felt they had won the job lottery, since the tips are huge due to the prices.

2.0,1/26/2013,"I knew it. I knew this place wasn't going to live up to its hype. Growing up in a Mediterranean country and culture, I have experienced many Greek-style seafood dinners, both at home and at many different restaurants. So, I had quite high expectations from such a restaurant where many people can't stop raving about. The atmosphere is nice and pleasant but nothing outstanding; circa 90s hip Manhattan restaurant with white walls, high ceilings and huge windows. The food was truly average for me. The only two things I kinda liked were the grilled sea bass and baklava. They don't have a good choice of mezes, which are essential to the Greek cuisine. Overall I don't think everything was very fresh. Also they didn't have authentic glasses for Ouzo and they only had cheap white bread. In Greece or any Mediterranean country, that kind of bread is served only at low-class restaurants. So I was very much surprised about thisThe service was attentive and polite. No problem about that. But, to be perfectly honest, one expects more Greek or Mediterranean waiters at a Greek restaurant. Almost 90% of the servers were either Russian, Indian, Mexican or Chinese. I have absolutely no problem with that at a regular restaurant. However,  when you ask them about some Greek mezes or specialties they aren't knowledgeable about them and it just doesn't feel authentic. Overall, in my opinion, Milos is an expensive and overrated restaurant with (below) average food for people who have experienced the ''real'' deal. I'm sure in NYC there are many other more authentic Greek restaurants, so unless you come here ''to see and be seen'' it really isn't worth it.",6,3,1,Sinan A.,"Istanbul, Turkey",2,63,8

2.0,12/10/2012,"Let me start by saying that I enjoy good food and don't mind paying for it, if it's good.  4 people...over $800 (with tip) when we left.  It's a bit much for ""decent"", not knock your socks off food.  When you walk in the first thing you notice is the nice decor and upbeat vibe.  There was a lot of people there and we waited a bit by the bar for our reservation time.  I walked over to the display showing the different fish that they had available which was quite impressive and being a fan of good seafood I couldn't wait to try some.  I found it odd that they had the price/lb displayed with the fish at the prices of what I saw. It's a good thing they aren't a fish market or else they'd be out of business at the prices they had on the fish.  When I sat down the waiter explained that they sell their fish by the pound, not the entree and it was a 3lb minimum order for the fish in the display with an additional $15.00 per person for them to plate the food.  How crazy is that?  So, for example if I wanted the Black Sea Bass, it was $85.00/lb X 3 + $15.00 each for the sea salt bake + $45.00 for 3 people.  $300.00.  I couldn't justify ordering a $300 entree even if it was being split.  We went with the crab legs as an appetizer....$85.00/lb at .65lbs which was $55 for 2 crab legs which were good, but for $55.00 I was Capt. Phil of the Cornelia Marie to come back from the dead and serve me personally.The Lobster which I can get for $4.99/lb at my local market was $59.00/lb with a 3 lb minimum, so for one lobster we paid $135 which 2 people split.  The lobster was good, don't get me wrong and if it wasn't so expensive this review would take a different tone.  I don't want to bog down in the minutiae of the bill and what I paid, but it adds to the experience when you walk out feeling like you didn't get a good value for your hard earned money.The tomato salad was very good, nice fresh tomatoes, feta, cucumbers and nice presentation.  Tasty, but $28.00 for a few tomatoes cut up and some cheese it's not worth it.  I ordered the bone in ribeye, which I normally wouldn't have but since the seafood was so freaking overpriced I decided to give it a shot.  The steak, was meh at best.  It was borderline prime, and unseasoned.  Since it's a Greek restaurant they put a sprig of Rosemary on it which I'm surprised wasn't extra.There were some high points to our dining experience which included the good service, nice decor, I enjoyed the calamari and grilled octopus appetizer.  To summarize, the food wasn't bad, just not worth the prices they charge.  I would wonder if they get a lot of repeat business, but am confident that I won't be back.",7,3,1,Mike C.,"Fort Mill, SC",70,355,28

4.0,9/12/2012,"Quite a scene--trendy Greek seafood restaurant with lots of beautiful people and lots of white decor.  The food was very good (though not quite really great) and the service was excellent.  There were six of us and we ordered a hit hit parade of appetizers to share, including the fried zucchinis and eggplants, grilled octopus, softshelled crabs and some tuna sashimi.  All were delicious and filling enough to make the meal.  For the main course they brought out two large grilled fish and some grilled vegetables.  These were very fresh, coming from the display in the back of the restaurant, but I thought a little on the dry side.  We topped it off with shared deserts of baklava, walnut cake with ice cream, yogurt with honey, and some fruit.  The wine list had some decent selections under $60, and we had 3 bottles.  The tab was about $170 per person, including tax and tip.  Could we have found better food elsewhere in Manhattan?  Undoubtedly.  But for lively atmosphere, people watching, service and good food, this was an evening worth having,",0,0,0,Dave L.,"New York, NY",32,361,10

5.0,8/29/2012,"Awesome and delicious food. As most of the reviews have mentioned, it is a very pricey, but the food does not disappoint.

4.0,8/21/2012,"4.5 starsPros:-Really tasty food. The fish is baked under a cover of coarse salt, so it comes out incredibly tender. They don't try to wow you with any additional flavoring of the fish, but with the freshness and try ""fish taste"" (but not fishy taste) of the food.-Really cool restaurant idea: you have a ""fish market"" in the back, and customers can go back there and order whichever fish they want (not just the type, but the size too). They have a pretty wide selection of fish and shellfish.-Appetizers were also pretty good! The fried zucchini (or maybe squash?) slices with the dip was really damn good.-Decor is really nice, and it's a huge restaurant for Midtown-Service was incredibly niceCons:-Will cost you a quite a bit, though with a small group it's probably possible to keep costs down to around the same range as a nice steakhouse...",2,0,1,Allen Y.,"Manhattan, NY",94,361,1
4.0,8/17/2012,"Telly Savalas is alive and well and eating at Milos!  What a fun place.  The room is high ceilinged, open and multi leveled so as you walk in you get a ""Santorini"" type of feeling with tables perched on on a hillside overlooking a view, in this case a view of other tables and diners. The decor is Greek ""minimalist"" with lots of white and tans.  The night I was there the crowd was boisterous and loud!  I swear there were a bunch of shaved head guys, with their shirts open a little too far and gold chains and pinky rings blazing with their perfectly tanned dates hanging on their every word. Telly, ""who loves ya baby"" is in the room!  The food- we ordered a bunch of dishes, the grilled fish, the octopus,the lobster, the eggplant appetizer,  the tomato salad, the mezze plates.  The eggplant appetizer is amazing.  It's an entire eggplant that is sliced into paper thin round sheets, then fried and then reconstructed vertically.  It's an impressive plate and I could not stop eating those crispy wafers of eggplant goodness even though I knew they were essentially ""french fries"" made out of eggplant.  Order it, you won't be sorry.  Next the octopus. I love octopus and this was some of the best I have ever had.  Even though we had some for the table, I ordered my own plate just to enjoy. Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  It was crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. The lobster was a 3 pound monster that is served split in half in the shell. For such an impressive crustacean I was surprised that it arrived on a large plate with no garnishment or other type of presentation.  I think that dish alone cost us about $150.00, how about a sprig of parsley?? Other than the size of the thing, I can't say much about it that was special.  It was a good lobster, I dipped in the butter they served. For dessert we ordered the fruit & yogurt plate and this was presented with a flourish, I enjoyed the presentation as much as the taste.  The fruit was beautifully carved melons served with thick Greek yogurt and honey.  I give Milos 4 stars because I am comparing it to places like Le Bernadin where seafood is raised to an art form. If you want a more casual experience then Milos is your place but skip the lobster.",1,2,2,Eric M.,"Nashville, TN",39,135,7

3.0,7/2/2012,"I would give this place 3.5 stars. We came here for their $24.07 prix-fixe lunch-- I had the seared scallops with orange salad appetizer, the lupe de mare for my entree, and the walnut cake for dessert. The atmosphere is lovely-- think billowing curtains, large windows, and potted olive trees indoors. The presentation of the dishes was not as impressive, although I have no problems with the restaurant's no frills style. Service was speedy and attentive.On to the food! My scallops were a bit scattered on the plate. Good flavor and texture, especially in combination with the orange salad, but I wish there were three instead of two because they were kind of small. I tried the mezze platter my co-workers ordered, which was a decent value-- three types of dips, a spicy pepper, and olives. Strong olive and other meditteranean flavors, but I wouldn't say this dish stands out against dips I've had at similar restaurants.The lupe de mare was great-- it was a whole grilled fish, super fresh. If you don't like to see any bones on your fish, then this dish might be a problem, but you can easily just cut them away since most of the bones were congregated on the sides of my fish. There were some scales still attached to the fish, but for me, they just reinforced that the fish was fresh, as opposed to a filet taken out of bag in the freezer. The steamed broccoli on the side was kind of random, but I liked having some type of green on my plate. The walnut cake was rather too sweet for my taste. It came with vanilla ice cream-- not really something I would get again. For fresh fish, I would say this was worth it, but I'm not sure I would come back independently outside of an office meal. Also, as noted up top, I haven't tried the dinner so this is just a review for lunch.",1,0,0,Ariel X.,"New York, NY",135,55,2

I had the Mediterranean plate for appetizer,which I would have expected it to come with pita bread or something, because it was hummus, etc...but it was still super tasty.My entree was the tuna burger with the zucchini ""fries""...the burger was seasoned perfectly and I could have eaten the zucchini all day they were so good. For dessert I had the walnut cake with was good, but not as good as the honey lavender ice cream that came with it. The reason for the 3 stars? The service. Granted it was a busy Friday lunch, but leaving empty glasses and plates on the table is unacceptable. If you can come to the table and ask if everything is okay you can remove my empty appetizer plate that's just sitting there. Also bring out dessert first and then the coffee 5 minutes after is a big no no. And then the kicker is after we were finished eating and the check had been dropped off, please don't hover and continually keep asking me did I need anything else because it's your lunch break and you need to close out your section.

It's consistently on the list of Restaurants at Which Papa N Will Eat -- and quite close to the top -- the other reviewers are correct, it's a lovely respite from the city -- though the noise level is slightly high (even at 11p), the ceilings are high, the drapery is calming, and the food is so freaking tasty you won't really care.Do yourself a massive favor and get two orders of the octopus -- it's tender, succulent, amazing -- and then order pretty much everything else on the menu. It's all simply, yet elegantly put together, and you get a strong sense of not only the individual ingredients, but interestingly, a sense of place, from the flavors presented. I could swear that we were dining on the steps of the Parthenon.

5.0,1/19/2012,"Day two of Winter Restaurant Week 2012 was unplanned for me but a colleague at work decided to take my team out to lunch as a thank you for wrapping up a big project.  I mentioned that Restaurant Week had just started and that there were some great options right around our office.  I considered a few different restaurants but in the end picked Estiatorio Milos because I knew one of my colleagues was a big fan of Mediterranean cuisine.  I'd been there for dinner a few times and it has always been an excellent dining experience.  Plus, their RW menu is the same as the pre/post theatre three course prixe-fixe for $49  but for half the cost so it's a good deal and they don't cut any corners.  I took the initiative to go ahead and snagged a 12:45 reservation the day of and asked if there were any objections to which there were none.The space itself is spare, the color palette is all whites and creams and stone.  A few bouquets of red roses and some colorful fish on the ice display are the only splashes of color.  A long translucent curtain hangs from the soaring 30 foot ceiling and separates the bar from the dining area.  The hanging lights are dim, but the front of the restaurant is made of entirely glass letting the sunshine pour in and cast a gentle natural light over the entire space.  The best way to describe the overall feel is calm and cool and despite the simple décor, when you walk into Estiatorio Milos you feel as if you are walking into a grand space.  A small bar runs along the left wall leading towards a large display of fresh fish and other gifts from the sea which are brought in daily to rest upon on a large bed of crushed ice.  Behind that the open kitchen bustles with activity.  The lunchtime crowd here was a mix of business-types and older couples, and everyone is well dressed.  The restaurant was busy and all the tables were full but the high ceilings help to muffle the noise level making conversation easy.  Above the fray are two elevated private dining rooms, one with walls lined with wine bottles presumably for special wine tasting occasions.I had the scallop appetizer, it was just two small scallops with a mandarin orange salad, light but very tasty. The crab cake was actually a very decent size for an appetizer, and the meze plate was a really nice mix of hummus, tzatziki and another spread called Taramosalata which were each excellent on the warm bread which came to the table. It also had a small spinach pie, some olives and a roasted red pepper.  So choose one of those latter two if you have a larger appetite. I enjoyed the loup de mer for my entree, it had a few bones but that's to be expected for this type of fish. Like most of the fish here, everything is simple, just fished grilled perfectly, with a balanced sauce, capers, and salt.  They serve the entire fish, head and all so it was filling. My colleagues each got the tuna burger, not my first choice but it was well received, especially the zucchini fries on the side. For dessert we each had the walnut cake with honey -lavender ice cream. Again, really simple but very satisfying. The service was courteous and prompt, and each course was timely.  The entire three course meal took just over an hour and never felt rushed.I've been a fan of Estiatorio Milos for some time now.  I love the philosophy behind the food they serve, offering the best and freshest produce, highest quality ingredients and most importantly the best fish and seafood.  Not only that but as someone who loves the simple things in life, I love Milos' idea of cooking to 'perfect simplicity'.  The fish here is simply grilled and never covered in heavy or overbearing sauces, to let the food transport you to the Mediterranean.  All in all, highly recommended, either for restaurant week, or the next special occasion you have coming up.  And at the very least, if you can't afford to get away for a Mediterranean vacation, a simple meal at Estiatorio Milos is the next best thing.",6,0,4,Andrew D.,"New York, NY",333,169,50

4.0,11/1/2011,"Everyone always talks about this restaurant. I liked it. However, I found the appetizers to be more appealing than the actual entrees. We had the fried zucchini appetizer (which is a MUST-ORDER) oysters (which were delicious) octopus (I'm not even a huge fan of octopus but this was very delicious and well-prepared), and salad. Then the waiter took us to the back to see all of the fish and seafood. The selection they had was unbelievable -- I don't think I've seen that much fresh fish in one location. They also had stone crab arms the size of your arm, but they were so expensively priced. The waiter was picking up this lobster to show us, and little did I know it was STILL ALIVE wiggling its hands at us. That kind of put me off a little but either way we ordered the Loup de Mer to share. It was very fresh, but very boney...and (don't kill me or anything) kind of bland. I understand the appeal of freshness, and I could taste that it was indeed a very good fish, but I wanted some sort of sauce with it. It was too dry for me.For dessert I had honey bread balls which were very good. The high ceilings in this restaurant make for a very loud environment, so be prepared to TALK LIKE EVERYONE AT YOUR TABLE NEEDS A HEARING AID. Also, there's always someone famous in this restaurant.

1.0,10/13/2011,"Greek food was on my mind and this place was on my list.  Unfortunately, this place is a joke.  I am sure the food is delicious but they are going to scam you in to much more food than is seriously manageable for two people.  I didn't know it was family style until after I sat down.  We had 1.5 waiters.  I say 1.5 because one was a faux waiter and the other was a jerk.   The faux waiter dropped off the menus and mumbled something about water and was gone.  The jerk swung by to swindle us into several of the many large dishes of food offered but we really weren't sure what on the menu we felt like eating.  Acting as commonfolk on this day, we were looking for more of a simple Greek presentation, perhaps a few dishes to taste and share but definitely nothing so overdone.  Skinny #1 and skinny #2 surely weren't looking for family style portions.  So the jerk came back and talked skinny #1 into viewing the fresh fish on ice and to assist him in choosing what we would dine on.  Okay...skinny #1 comes back and advises that they pretty much do not have any fish that are less than 2lbs.  We surely do not want 2lbs of fish for dinner nor do we want 1lb of fish for dinner.  Nor do we want several family sized side dishes either.We feel confused.  Jerk comes back to the table and asks us if we are ready to select some sides to go with the fish.  Skinny #2 (ME) expertly jumps in and states that a whole fish is a bit too much food for us and we are still unsure.  He gets exasperated and points to another dish on the menu as well as a meat option and then storms off.  We are not eating meat.  Skinny #1 suggests we not be pressured into something that we are not excited about.  I agree yet we deliberate about the ethics and feelings of leaving versus staying.  Our verdict is leave.  It's so overpriced for a style of food that we are just not feeling. We probably could have made do with some apps or something but the jerk really made the experience much worse than the family style portions.  Perhaps we should have done a little more research before sitting down but in all truth, we do what we want.  That's how we roll..5 wanders around and we ask for the check for our still water and bread.",2,5,1,Joanne B.,"Mammoth Lakes, CA",83,283,39

So at 6 dlls a spoon, not with it. Not to mention when I asked for pita bread for the dips they said they only had bread. I asked for fresh bread and it never came.

It cost me over 200 a person and we walked away hungry. And on top of this they try to rip me off by trying to charge me for 8 bottles of wines instead of 4. I asked for 2 pounds of shrimps they try to charge me for 4, etc. When I asked why, they told me they felt this was not enough for my table. Obviously asking me for my permission never crossed their mind. The staff is not friendly especially after you question the bill. It almost looks like they work on commission, based on how much they can cheat their customers for. I know a lot of people who like this place and it's always crowded. I guess there are a lot of people who don't care how much they spend for food. From my perspective if I will spend over $ 400 a couple I may as well eat at Le Cirque or La Bernardin.

5.0,7/15/2011,"What a fantastic find.  I actually accidentally stumbled upon this location after having an excellent meal at the Athen's location. It's a big, open, bright, lively spot for a midtown dinner.  The atmosphere is always alive, and the clientele chic. You have room, i.e. are not on top of the other tables, which is rather rare in NYC. I have been several times and we've always had great drinks, great food and service.  The seafood is some of the best in the city. You must start with the milos special - paper thin zucchini with eggplant and saganaki cheese, deep fried.  It's super light, despite the fact that it's fried and has a great flavor and crunch! A good secret is that they'll let you order a half order, which I recommend so that you can try a few other appetizers. A wise man once said, 'variety is the spice of life!' The spreads are good too, especially for the table to share. For entrees you must order their fresh fish. You will not be disappointed. It's quite pricey, but very fresh and cooked on charcoal with lemon sauce. Desserts are my style - they are of the lighter Greek variety: yogurt with honey and fresh fruit.

5.0,7/13/2011,"Does reviewing a restaurant for the first time during restaurant week jeopardize the review itself? Is it like walking in on a hottie taking a poop? For some restaurants restaurant week becomes more of a PR, ""open the gates to the plebeians"" thing than an actual attempt at spreading culinary seeds to different people. Luckily Milos dolled itself up during restaurant week and kept its best dress on. I went with a friend for lunch. The place is very big, and has sloppy cement work all over the place giving it a weird parking lot vibe. But that's if you look up. If you look anywhere else, you will find pretty people eating pretty food. And if you gaze deep into the restaurant, you will see fresh, fleshy fish lying on a bed of ice. That's the thing here, fish, and as someone who would gladly eat fish every day of my life, I was in great company.I got the mezze plate as an appetizer. It was served with sliced cucumbers. The mezze were excellent, all fresh and distinct enough. Sometimes the tastes all roll into one creamy hummus mess, but here they really made an effort to give each one a distinct personality. My friend had scallops, which were good but, in typical RW mode, miniscule.Then came the surprise. I ordered the loup de mer. I thought I would be getting a little filet, maybe placed on top of a bed of spinach with some grated zucchini on top (you get the picture). I got a WHOLE FISH! I felt like Charlie Bucket in Willy Wonka. My friend got the tuna burger, which was delicious but paled in comparison to my fish. I kept telling him ""I win I win I win!"" but gave him several morsels of my sea monster to compensate for my behavior. The fish was quite simply phenomenal. Just the way, I believe, fresh fish should be done. SIMPLY! Olive oil, lemon, rock salt, a hint of parsley, garlic and some subtle herbs. That's it. What followed was me just melting in front of this fish. Oh and I had fresh fruit for dessert and a double espresso.But seriously- 22 bucks for a huge fish? AND the mezze? AND the fresh fruit?

As other Yelpers have said, you can make a meal out of the appetizers alone -- and since the fresh fish, for which they are known, is priced by the pound, that's a smart economical decision too!  We had the grilled octopus (superb!), the Mediterranean (an adventure for the taste buds), crab cake (good but not a must have) and the skewered scallops (yum). The three of us were quite satisfied with both the quality and the portion size.  Also be sure to get a recommendation for wine.  My normal preference is a nice Pinot Grigio and my wonderful waitress recommended a fine Greek alternative which was a nice compliment to the meal.Overall a very nice experience and I would go again...but perhaps not on a Saturday night when it is so crowded.",0,0,0,Lisa C.,"Manhattan, NY",18,36,21
4.0,3/13/2011,"The 4 stars is for the food, but I would give 5 stars for the service. While all the ingredients were extremely fresh and good, it wasn't the absolute to-die-for best meal of my life. I came here with one another person for an early pre-opera dinner. We started out with the grilled octopus appetizer which everyone else raved about. The octopus was delicious and perfectly cooked (not chewy, very fresh) and the pairing with the capers was really, really good. I don't usually even like capers, but this appetizer was delicious.For the entree, I ordered the $49 prix fixe menu and had:1) Crab cake, grilled shrimp, and fava piazzi puree - the crab cake had great chunks of crab (always better than chunks of breading), and the shrimp was simply grilled (only 1 came with the plate). The fava puree was just kind of there on the plate, but it was a pretty basic puree and nothing to complain about.2) Loup de mer - this was a very simply grilled sea bass. The portion was great for one person and the fish was very fresh. It was very uncomplicated, so if you're looking for entrees with sauce or more flavors, this would not be the dish for you.3) Walnut cake with honey-lavender ice cream - this was really delicious, and I almost wish I had a second plate of this dessert. I'm not a fan of lavender ice cream, but theirs had the perfect balance of lavendar and honey (so I didn't feel like I was eating soap).My dining companion had the Prime Filet Black Angus Steak cooked medium. The vegetables that came were completely unimportant, but the steak was delicious.Overall, this was a great meal, and the service was EXCELLENT (I was a bit worried about the service due to earlier reviews).",0,0,0,Esther K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0

4.0,8/14/2010,"I had the pleasure of dining at Estiatorio Milos this week - a fancy dinner for no fancy occasion (thank you, wonderful boyfriend)! Within full view of the dining area is a table filled with seafood on ice. It's so great to see gleaming whole fish on public display and not in a Chinese supermarket.We started with some warm toasted bread served with a dish of olive oil. I only wish they had topped the olive oil with freshly cracked black pepper.The boyfriend and I both ordered from the prix fixe menu. His appetizer was the organic Irish smoked salmon with capers and red onions while I had the crab cake, grilled shrimp, and fava piazzi puree. I'm not sure what made the smoked salmon Irish... The crab cake seemed like 100% crab meat - no bready fillers. It was, hands down, the best crab cake I can remember eating! The shrimp was HUGE, and the fava piazzi was light and creamy. The dish was served with a dollop of sweet mayonnaise, which I enjoyed spreading over each bite of shrimp and crab cake.Next came the tomato salad for both of us. It's not my favorite dish in the world, simply because I am not a fan of zucchini or large tomatoes. I alternated between bites of the veggies and the goat cheese.Time for the main course! The boyfriend had the Lour de Mer, which our waiter explained was a kind of sea bass. This whole fish was served split open and mostly deboned. I was impressed that it was tenderly cooked. I had the Honjake Salmon - a cut of grilled salmon fillet. It was a little overcooked for my taste: I lean more towards the blue-rare side for salmon. It was served with a side of Swiss chard and diced red beets. The beets were tasty with the slightest hint of sweetness, but the Swiss chard was too bitter! I don't know if Swiss chard is inherently bitter or if they just cooked it wrong (it looked pretty lifeless as it sat on the side like a mound of soggy dark green mass), but I could only stomach two mouthfuls of the stuff.Dessert was finally served: strawberry sorbet for the boyfriend and walnut cake with honey-lavendar ice cream for myself. Oh YUM, what a treat the walnut cake was! Sweet and light - I only wish I wasn't so full from the previous three courses that I could have finished every last bite!!!Overall, this was a beautiful dinner!

4.0,1/14/2010,"I think I've been to Milos four or five times and have had at least two lunches and two dinners.  It always lives up to the hype as far as I'm concerned.For lunch, I recommend the tomato salad (with onions, cucumbers, feta, and kalamata olives) and then the fish of the day, which is usually a grilled white fish.For dinner, I recommend going as part of a group of at least four and ordering a couple of different fish to share.  Appetizers as you wish, but be sure to get some of the tomato salad!The staff is very friendly, which is a bonus.  I will agree with others that the ""bar side"" is a little contrived with the umbrellas and all, but the dining side is much more as you'd expect.  It can get a little tight between tables, but honestly what restaurant in NYC isn't a little tight?Prices will be about $35-40 per person for lunch, and $70-85 for dinner, assuming you get 1-2 drinks, an appetizer, and a main.  Lunch is the real value here, in my opinion, but regardless it's a great place to go when somebody else or some corporate entity is picking up the tab!",0,0,0,Darien G.,"Des Moines, IA",0,183,0

But the food is amazing, and the space is typically fun and buzzing - a great choice for a special occassion.The Milos Special is one of the best appetizers that I've had in NYC: fried thin slices zucchini with saganaki cheese. If it were socially acceptable, I'd have 3 of these for dinner and call it a day. The Grilled Shrimp - fresh, juicy, and buttery - are also a tremendous starter (ah, if only they weren't $65.00/lb...). Grilled Vegetables are exactly as you'd expect - though, pass on them as an appetizer, and have them served with your main. And of the mains - the fresh fish by the pound is the best way to go. When ordering, your waiter will escort you to the ""market"" set up by the kitchen. There, he'll give you a tour of the day's best offerings: langoustines, tuna, snapper, etc. all flown in from around the world. Ask for the Loup de Mer, grilled. In about 45 minutes, you'll sink your teeth into some of the best fish you've ever tasted.The bill is going to hurt, especially if you've ordered wine (not a cheap list here).

That is the best word to describe Estiatorio Milos.  The decor is open and breezy with just a touch of industrial that reminds you this is NYC.  It has the midtown restaurant feel with a laidback twist - I visited for a working lunch but easily forgot about the office while at the space.  The fish is displayed over ice for all of the dining room to see and looks as appetizing as a seaside fish market.  And then you taste it... and it lives up to the mouth-watering anticipation!  I went for Restaurant Week lunch and everything was delicious. The olive oil for the crusty bread first got my attention - it was so light and flavorful and obviously of superior quality.  Our waiter recommended a sardine appetizer which came out lightly fried and not at all ""fishy"" like you would expect sardines to be. I began with grilled scallops over mandarin mint salad. I enjoyed the flavors because they were so light, however, the scallops were not memorable and could have benefited from a more savory accompaniment or sauce - the mandarin and mint was a little too light to make a statement. I had the Loup de Mer entree which was perfect. Straight up grilled sea bass - simple and perfected.  Fish this fresh doesn't need anything to make it delicious.  I finished with the walnut cake - a dense spice cake served with a spoonful of ice cream.  I left feeling completely satisfied and not over stuffed.  I definitely recommend Estiatorio Milos for people who love seafood done simply and done well.

Overall though, I think the simplistic preparation of the food is spot-on with how seafood should be prepared.  Milos can be pricey a la carte, but if you spring for the prix fixe lunch or dinner menu, you won't be disappointed and it's a pretty good deal.",3,3,1,Dana F.,"Queens, NY",665,925,146

4.0,1/21/2009,"We gave Milos a whirl for a Restaurant Week lunch and were not disappointed. When you walk in, the space opens immediately and is almost cavernous. The decor is sparse which is fine by me. Toward the back there is an open kitchen (always a welcome sight for me) and an impressive array of fish on ice. We were seated and immediately presented with some crusty bread and a light, velvety, Greek olive oil for dipping. Our waiter Nicholas was very nice to us (especially when he found out one of us was Greek). The Meal: We started with a meze plate for me and Scallops over a mint and tangerine salad for the lady. Of course, we shared. The scallops were pan sauteed to a nice bouncy texture and their sweetness combined nicely with the citrus and greens on the plate. On the other side, we had a meze plate with tzatziki (maybe the smoothest I've ever tasted), taramasalata (always too salty for me but, this was one of the nicer ones), hummus (which was pretty special; smooth and rich), a spanakopita bite (Tasty and tiny - not even an amuse-bouche - frankly, why serve such a tiny spanakopita? It makes no sense.), hot peppers (nice mix of sweet and hot and I don't like hot that much), and kalamata olives (which you can only screw up if you buy bad olives - these were wonderful). The main course was grilled loup de mer with broccoli in a little olive oil and lemon. The fish was light, moist and flaky on the inside with the skin lightly scorched to provide a nice crisp. They left the head, which is good since we like to eat the cheeks. The broccoli was wonderful in that it was still firm enough and the mixture of the lemon and oil with the broccoli, provided almost a buttery quality. For dessert, we tried the walnut cake and the mixed berries. The walnut cake came with what tasted like a lavender/honey ice cream. The berries were tasty (see the kalamata olive commentary). We tried a Greek white with lunch and I indulged in a little Greek coffee (pleasantly mild) afterwards. So why no 5th Star? Well, I have a problem with pricey Greek food for one thing. Greek food is simple and from the Earth and for everyone. Second, Greek food is casual and accessible - no need to create a reason to make great, simple food any more than it is.

4.0,11/26/2008,"Before we get into the food, I have to briefly rant about the staggering ineptitude exhibited by the hostesses and maitre'd.  I attempted to book a reservation for an imporant business dinner well in advance in one of the private rooms upstairs and after ten minutes of arguing about the location of the room I wanted, I finally was connected with someone who was generally aware of their existence and was able to secure the res.  Upon arrival, the maitre'd had no evidence of my private booking and only had my party down for a specific six-top in the main dining room!  Whatever, we sat down confused and ready to abuse the wine list.Warm crusty bread is served immediately upon seating and is accompanied with perfectly grassy olive oil.  We ordered first courses family style and they were fantastic.  We had the Milos Special--paper thin slices of zucchini deep fried and lightly salted, served with tangy yogurt sauce (excellent); Octopus--grilled and very tender; Crab Cakes--loaded with sweet crab and served with a well balanced remoulade; Fried Calamari--tender and lightly breaded, needed some sort of sauce though.Entrees were also served family style and we selected the mediterranean red snapper and the black sea bass.   Both were presented whole and the servers allocated a generous portion to each diner as well as the snapper head for me to enjoy!  Fish was unbelievable, very fresh, moist and flaky with few bones.We washed everything down with an impressive estate sav blanc from napa that complimented the fish perfectly.  The space cadet hostesses notwithstanding, one of the better manhattan restaurants for fresh fish.",0,0,0,Ryan F.,"New York, NY",5,42,0

5.0,11/24/2008,"My boyfriend kept raving about this place from the moment we landed in NYC and knowing that this place is uber expensive, I was skeptical and apprehensive. Anyway, on our final night he took me here and I was blown away. First of all the restaurant has an open and airy feel without feeling too industrial. It's a nice balance of marble and concrete combined with elegant touches of the Greek islands. The ambiance is upscale, but not pretentious and stuffy. But, it's all about the food here people. First of all, they have a really great prix-fix deal for $49. In our case we chose to start with the crab cakes and grilled shrimp. OMG! This is the best crab cake I've ever had in my life. It's all fresh crab meat with no filler. Then came the salad which had a great tasting zesty olive oil dressing. Yumm! For the entree, I had the ahi tuna. I was blown away by the freshness and the wonderful side garnish of sauteed spinach . My bf had the open face fish that was sprinkled lightly in olive oil, some capers, and a dab of lemon. I had a taste and once again you can taste the delicious freshness of the fish. Milos seems to thrive on very little sauce and allowing the freshness of the seafood to speak for itself. All in all it's some of the best tasting I've ever had. Finally, we ended our dining excursion with an order of the phylo crust filled with custard. I can only describe it as heavenly. I'm going to order one for just myself next time. This place is worth the money! My bf & I split the bill and including tip it was about $80 each.

4.0,6/3/2008,"Something smells fishy here!!!!Well that is simply because you get to choose your own fish here and they are all lying out on a huge mountain of ice fresh for the picking!!It is true. You probably can't get fish any fresher than this place, and the price tag per pound matches that quality. The cheapest fish I believe you could order started around $45 a pound, and you have to buy the whole fish and most fish are at least 2 pounds so come here hungry and with a full wallet. And if you don't know anything about european varieties of fish don't be afraid to ask! We didn't, and granted we felt slightly unsophisticated asking, but our waiter was extremely knowledgeable and helped guide us to a great fish!!We got the Lavraki which was a white fish from Greece to go with the greek theme, since we were at a greek restaurant and even got a white wine from greece as well just to complete the meal. The fish was grilled and salted and was topped with capers!!! THE BIGGEST CAPERS ever pretty much. I could have eaten a whole bowl just of the capers!! I fell in love, but how can you not with perfection??Our appetizer, however, did not live up to the hype. Our waited even told us we made a good selection choosing the grilled calamari stuffed with Cretan Anthotiro cheese, feta, spinach, and fresh mint, with saffron and truffle caviar, but really without the feta the calamari would have been a little bland and I could barely taste the mint...the caviar was pretty tasty though...so I think this dish could have been a little better taste wise but everything was fresh and presented nicely.This place definitely makes you feel fancy when you are inside too--with white fabric draped in the dining area and a view of the kitchen you can see everything being cooked live. They even have an employee here whose only job seems to be to open the door for you when you go to the bathroom!! No, not a bathroom attendant, meaning they don't hand you their SUPER thick paper towels which are probably the cause for global warming on their own, she literally just opens the door for you when you walk into the bathroom. Strange we thought haBut go here for the fish and you will not leave disappointed at all!! And go with 4 people so you can get the larger version of the cooked fresh fish option where they cook it in sea salt but it is a 3 pound minimum. So if you go and try that, let me know how it is!!!!But I had a lovely time here with Matt and it definitely made us want to visit greece even more so than we did before.",4,2,2,Sarah G.,"Durham, NC",1713,1653,12
4.0,5/30/2008,"Airy Mykonos meets industrial Manhattan at this very loud, very spacious indoor house of fish that aspires to rooflessness and perpetual daylight -- whatever's the opposite of permafrost.  A drapey curtain here, an oversized urn there, white on white on white everywhere; one almost expects to see a staff of androids in togas.  (The actual androids can be spotted more frequently among the largely professional clientele -- suited up, buttoned up, slightly stiff, backed by expense accounts.)  The problem is that it's a thoroughly contained space, and did I mention that it is VERY LOUD?  The carefree resplendence Milos is going for gets undercut by the impossibility of maintaining an audible (i.e., stress-free) conversation there.Though the decor and decibel levels don't work for me, the food undeniably does.  The momentary thrill of choosing your own fish aside, the real pleasure is in the eating.  From soft-shell crabs to grilled octopus, arctic char to sole, red snapper to shrimp, everything tastes fresh and is prepared simply to retain flavor.  Wines are superb, especially the whites.  Choicest desserts, in my opinion even better than the baklava, are the memorable galaktoboureko and the deceptively simple Greek yogurt with honey.  The waitstaff is attentive, courteous, and efficient.Prices can be painful.  Best to go when you're expense-accounted for.",1,1,2,Ladida D.,"New York, NY",13,116,1

4.0,3/25/2008,"I'm not embarrassed to say how excited I was when the girlfriend said, ""Let's try Greek.""  But I seemed to have misunderstood her.  She was planning dinner for friends.  Anyway, we went, me being somewhat disappointed, to Milos, which I'd never been to before despite it being a top seafood place for years.  See, I've never really been interested in Greek cuisine, which to me just meant mediterranean plus baklava.  The other Greek restaurant I've been to recently didn't have anything especially Greek about it.  Culinary ignorance on my part.But Milos is all about fresh seafood first, regional cuisine a distant second.  They have the freshest seafood I've seen in NYC (not counting the still-swimming stuff in C-town).  Step down to the display area and you're greeted by a mountain of crushed ice, on which glistening, gleaming, glinting seafood lie in repose.  One huge bass kept winking at me with her fresh disk eyes, pouty lips taunting, ""Eat me... eat me... then I'll show you Greek style...""  Her price card said something like $50/lbs., and I think she weighed in at four.We ate the bass, perfectly steamed, meaty and moist, done with almost Chinese simplicity.  But before that, our party of five had Kuramoto oysters (I like 'em small, plump and juicy, and these were very nice but i forgot to ask exactly from where they hailed), broiled razor clams (probably my favorite dish that night), grilled octopus, organic beet salad (yum), fried softshelled crab (just in season, and these were HUGE, but not my favorite), and langoustines.  Followed by that naughty Greek-loving bass.The Milos style is fresh, very light and balanced, perfectly grilled, steamed, sauteed, what have you.  No fancy seasonings here; the stars are the seafood, dressed in a splash of olive oil, period.  After gorging on lean protein and cholesterol, dessert honestly didn't grab many of us, but we split a walnut cake and fresh fruit platter.  Both were excellent.  The cake moist, light and crumbly, tender, yes, that's the word.  The fruits were all sweet; we made the waiter guarantee its sweetness before we ordered it!  Milos also has their modern takes on baklavas and other Greek specialites, but that will have to wait until next time.The toasted crusty bread they serve with food is great, and in fact they have an excellent selection of salads, which my friends told me are uniformly excellent.  Service was professional and friendly.  Waiting for our coats to be taken away took some time, but no biggie.  The space is cavernous but light and airy.  Felt like 30 ft ceilings.  Very nice feeling.  I love the humongous stone pot-like objects all over.  It was about the only obvious reference to anything mediterranean.We didn't drink much, just a glass of sweet Greek wine, Kir Royale (first one was flat, but they gladly replaced it) and a nice Mojito, teas to cap it off.  Total just under $800 with tip and tax.  Sunday evening, still a full house.If you love seafood, real seafood, you will be rewarded here.  Just remember to check the impulse to order any and every sea creature that winks at you.  If you don't balance the meal with some greens and non-seafood, you might leave vaguely unsatisfied, as though you know what it's like to be stranded on a small tropical island.  The menu also has other meats.    I recommend going with a group since many of the fish on offer are big, and you should sample a range.  Very nice experience, and will visit again.  But if you're after some real Greek action, hmm, not tonight, honey...",3,3,3,D.

5.0,1/26/2008,"I had a wonderful experience here at Milos for lunch. First of all, the waiters are very attentive and prompt. Some also have heavy Greek accents, which speaks volumes about the place. The complimentary bread was very tasty when warm, and the waiter even offered us more after we finished. We ordered from the $24.07 lunch menu, and the greek spreads were very robust in flavor. The yogurt/goat cheese spread was my fav! I wish that pita breads accompanied these spreads, since that is how I am used to eating Greek mezes, but I just used the comp'd bread. The strong flavor foreshadowed the rest of the meal. My entree was the grilled seafood, which I loved! Each bite-sized morsel of scallop, salmon, swordfish, some other types of seafood, pepper, tomato and onion were perfectly roasted: charred around the edges and crispy on the inside but melt-in-your-mouth delicously soft on the inside. Each bite was flavored with lemongrass, lemon juice and plenty of extra virgin olive oil. Divine!I looked forward to the baklava for dessert (and was even ready to pay for the $6 supp fee) but they ran out of it by 2:30! That only intrigues me more.. but anyway, we shared the sorbet and walnut pie with honey lavender ice cream. Again, the strong flavors hit me! The sorbet tasted like a CREAMY, REAL version of strawberries. It tasted better than what real, fresh strawberries taste like! The walnut pie did not blow me away but simply reminded me of baklava because of its nutty, honey-drenched interior.. oh, baklava. What you do to me. The honey-lavender ice cream was almost my favorite part. Absolutely creamy, delicious and bursting with lavender and honey aroma and flavor.

Our appetizers consisted of a deliciously fresh Greek Salad, the tomatoes were outstanding and tasted as it they had just been picked off the vine! We were also served their famous Greek Spread with Tzatziki (Yogurt, Cucumber, Garlic, Olive Oil), Tarama (Fish Roe, Olive Oil, Lemon), Scordalia (Almonds, Garlic), and Ktipiti (Holland Peppers, Feta Cheese, Olive Oil). It was a perfect starter and seemed like a gorgeous version of Greek chips and dip only much more refined than anything imaginable. The 'Red Snapper' was our choice of entree. This is probably the most delicious fillet of fish I've ever had. What still amazes me is how simple it was. The fish came whole, grilled on the charcoal with Olive Oil and Lemon Sauce, really not much to it when you think about it. Yet it was so incredibly flavorful, there were just a few capers adorning it's silky texture. I would return to Milos for th seafood any day for lunch or dinner.

I believe the quality of the bread says a lot about the restaurant, and this Milos has very good bread. I started with a half dozen oysters. Yum. My wife had the grilled octopus which was amazing. We both had whole fish for our entrees. They had two options for the whole fish so we each had one of the options. The fish was simply prepared  and was excellent.

($18 for a medium sized bowl of swiss chard, around $40 per pound for their fish, dinner for four with maybe two drinks each north of $500 including tip). They have probably 10 - 15 kinds of fish, all fresh and available to be seen and selected, which is nice.Pricing aside, the space is very nice and the fish was awesome. It's just not my kind of value-for-money place. If you're on an expense account or you're indifferent to value, it's great. Also, a very good dessert wine list, which is kind of rare (Chateau Y'quem, Hungarian Tokaijis, etc).",1,0,0,jon c.,"Orinda, CA",10,48,0
5.0,7/20/2007,This place has been here for such a long time and is still always packed and there is a reason for that.If you like fish you love this place. The fish is always fresh and you can even go to the front and pick your fish.I would not recommend it as a first date place because it can get very loud.The wine list is also excellent.,1,0,1,Thomas H.,"New York, NY",8,18,7
4.0,7/18/2007,"I had dinner here last nite, and I was satisfied.I'm not a big fan of Mediterranean food, but my boss chose the place so I couldn't say no.  Not that I'd say no to a free meal, but if I was paying we'd go elsewhere cause this place is pricey.Anyway, I ordered from the Prix Fixe Menu (thank you Resaurant Week!) and got the Tomato Salad (authentic Greek salad prepared with vine-ripe tomatoes) as my appetizer-- which was fresh and delicious.My main course- was the Swordfish Steak (American-caught grilled swordfish steak and grilled vegetables), which was just right.Dessert (which I had to force myself to eat) was a piece of Walnut cake with Vanilla ice cream on the side-- which I didn't really care for.I wouldnt normally go here, but being that the Prix Fixe menu offered things such as lamb chops and lobster- I was glad to check it out.",0,0,0,Chloe-Lynn O.,"New York, NY",32,85,8
4.0,2/5/2007,"I had been craving good octopus ever since I last visited Greece, and I got what I wanted here. It was fresh and cooked just right so it was tender and not rubbery. The red snapper for our table was great, and the tzatziki starter used real Greek yogurt. It was an excellent meal from appetizer to dessert.",2,0,1,Arun C.,"San Francisco, CA",51,241,0
3.0,1/31/2007,"Umm... its okay.  I like choosing my fish.  It was fresh tasting, but not often do I leave a restaurant feeling that I did not get my money's worth.  I did this night.  Don't go unless you have an T and E  (expense) account",1,0,1,Doron R.,"Orlando, FL",71,204,55
5.0,5/2/2006,Wonderful Greek food.   You get to pick your own fish and it looks like it's still alive.  Astonishing attention to detail.  Manages to maintain a very warm atmosphere despite being all glass.,0,0,0,Nellie L.,"San Francisco, CA",74,85,0
4.0,4/15/2006,"Urban greek.  The room is a large airy open space, with white shears, white booths/tables, and umbrellas. You really get an itch for summer to turn the corner. Yet it still retains an exposed ceiling which reminds you that you are in an urban mecca not to be mistaken for what you'd like it to be. What I like about this place, beside the delicious food, is the attention this restaurant has to details. On the table sits fresh young basil which they snip quickly into the olive oil they pour.  Loads of garlic are what keep the white shears grounded. The food is also outstanding. It is about as fresh as it gets. There is a back ""market"" in which the seafood choices for the evening are displayed on a wall of ice. You are asked to ""go fish"" and pick out what you'd like them to prepare for you that evening. However, beware. The prices here are very high and the way it is priced is something to be conscious of when ""fishing.""  The fish are priced per pound. So, if you pick a big fish, then you are going to be paying quite a bit.  Given that I think this pricing isn't the most fair, I give this place only four stars. Otherwise, Milos would get a five. The food and service were absolutely outstanding. We had grilled giant Alaskan clams. My goodness! Grilled squid, extremely fresh oysters with caviar and not to forget the greek spread sampler to start.  We picked out the Pink Snapper which also was good, but again pricey as it was one of the larger!",2,0,0,Anna S.,"San Francisco, CA",52,183,13
4.0,12/15/2005,"Decor is airy, modern, and soothing at the same time. E.g., right now a pomegranate filled chest and pomegranates used to weigh down gauzy curtains are its main design theme. The prix-fixe lunch menu is reasonable, but for dinner it's sorta pricey. The bread is fantastic, although my arctic char was so-so. They sort of lack authentic Greek entrees though . . . but they did have that dessert that's hard to spell (custard with phyllo dough) Mm!",1,0,0,T T W.,"Duxbury, MA",35,90,5
5.0,3/26/2005,"Fresh fesh, oysters and olive oil.  Yummm.   The crab cakes are amazing.  As are the deep fried thin slices of zucchini served with a spicy sauce.  Service is great.  Ask for a window table.  Very good wine list - drank both Chalk Hill Sauv Blanc 02 and Verite Meritage 1998.  Pricey, but worth it.",1,0,0,Tara H.,"Sebastopol, CA",39,138,37
