5.0,4/28/2019,Leonard Cohen exhibit is a real treat. It portrays the artist in a true experiential way. Not like any exhibit I have ever seen.  There are several rooms. You get to experience his performances  through the decades. Then a biographical understanding of him. Finally a meditative experience in a private room. Give yourself time to enjoy the the exhibit and feel immersed in the magic of this amazingly talented artist through the decades.,0,0,0,Gloria L.,"Mahwah, NJ",0,10,1
1.0,4/28/2019,"The utmost disrespect of art, by setting up dining tables along a whole section of important exhibition, preventing visitors from appreciating the art. If this is acceptable, how about a seafood restaurant in front of Washington Crossing the Delaware? Filed multiple written complaints with the management office over the last five years but not a single response. Art is obviously not as important as revenue.",0,0,0,Jian X.,"Chicago, IL",29,11,15
4.0,4/27/2019,"Play It Loud exhibit.The reason for coming to the Met was to see the new special exhibit Play It Loud. PIL exhibition displays over a hundred of the most famous instruments of rock and roll from over almost 50 years. It's an easy self guided walk through not just instruments, but other pieces of rock memorabilia, including posters and costumes. It was incredible to walk through seeing guitars played by some of rock's most famed musicians representing several generations and subgenres. Most items are from institutional and private collectors. Many pieces were lent from performers themselves. There was also a room that was running three separate video interviews that you could watch at your leisure. My favorite other room made one wall a huge video screen. It showed 15 second clips of many of the musicians playing the instruments you just saw. On a Friday afternoon, this was one busy area. Its run in April to October 1, 2019. We did catch a few other displays in the museum as we got ""squirreled"" on our way to the exit. But you probably need at least 3-4 full days to really appreciate all the artifacts in this massive building. $25 admission. The kiosk was fast and easy.",19,9,17,Donna B.,"Reno, NV",462,1114,7025
5.0,4/25/2019,What can be said that hasn't been said?  I write this as a single male who visited while on a solo vacation to NYC.  I think this museum is a must see for anyone who is visiting NYC.  Why?  Reflecting on true beauty in the arts is good for your soul.  There is so many beautiful items and spaces that will refresh and revive your spirit.  It's always good to expose yourself to iconic popular art.  There is a sense of satisfaction one gets when they are familiar with popular art and can say in a group of people that they saw that piece of art.  Seeing popular pieces of art can take you back in time to a way of life that expands your worldview and perspective of your current context.  The Met has a great selection of popular art and fascinating exhibits that have educational recordings that can accessed on your phone.  It has beautiful and relaxing spaces.  Give yourself all day to see most of the museum.,0,0,1,John M.,"Akron, OH",113,140,542
5.0,4/24/2019,"It's the MET! I spent most of childhood coming here and I'm sure I've only seen a fraction of the collection.  It takes DAYs not hours to see everything!  $25 entry fee. The kiosk I was surprising easy and saved time in line.    Warnings It's always packed from locals to tourist to school groups - just pack your patiences.  If you're going to see the special exhibit (the guitars rocked!) you will need to wait in line again. Check your dates/status- free days, pay as you like, local discounts. If you get behind a group of schools kids, listen up you might learn something. The docents that do the tours know a lot, just don't be too creepy following a group kids around. Always a great time.",2,0,5,Debbie P.,"Reno, NV",319,625,1926

Please do not be a clueless tourist and block the entrance. Museum staff is very rude and they do not implement backpack in front policy with the guests, meaning: IT IS VERY STUFFY AND CRAMPED.

5.0,4/23/2019,"You know, I thought about trying to write a review of The MET. The problem that I'm running into, it feels like you're writing a book review of the Bible, The Pilgrim's Progress, or dare I say the Canterbury Tales. It would be more of an educational exercise, rather than actually making a contribution of content to this platform.So, why bother writing? I could try to sound smart an' snooty talking about the works here, but alas, I am not qualified. Ask me how you're metoprolol works, I can answer that. Ask me how to use crutches, I can demonstrate that. Ask me why you should avoid leafy greens if you're on coumadin, I can answer that. Ask me how to use an incentive spirometer, I can help with that. Don't ask me the symbolism of the ""Basket of Flowers"" by Eugène Delacroix. They're flowers. It's a pretty picture, I know there was some political unrest at that time, but as far as I know, they're just an analog picture of flowers. Also, don't ask me what the EKG or X-Ray shows. A doctor has to see it, then tell you. I can (somewhat) read it, but I can't tell you what's on it. Again, I'm not qualified. Maybe you notice a theme here.Why should you go to The MET? If you have any appreciation of art, history, or anything cultural, then you should go to The MET. Do I know a lot about art? No. Do you need a PhD to appreciate art? No. Do you need to know the artists here? No. Did I google half the artists in this review? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯What I will say, is I wish we had more time to see all the cultural treasures. Having limited time, we hit the highlights of 19th century European painters. Our love is for Van Gogh. I also like Monet, Manet, Renoir, Cézzane, and Degas. Of course, our visit to the Rodin Museum in Philadelphia sparked my love for his work, and we were excited to see pieces here. Could I remember most of these names the first time I saw their work? NO!!! Am I starting to learn? MAYBE! Do you need comfortable shoes if you're going to The MET? YES!!! Are the staff rude? It's New York, what did you expect? A polite mid-westerner taking your coat? Just deal with it. I will say, it was a lovely time with my loving wife, and we hope to return.",3,3,4,John O.,"Peabody, MA",237,470,971
5.0,4/22/2019,The new Genji exhibit is lovely. I am mostly amused by the taxidermy deer that is covered in giant glass balls. There is also quite the collection of extremely beautiful and decorative kimonos.,1,0,1,Mai-Anh H.,"Houston, TX",196,458,269
5.0,4/21/2019,"This is a gigantic and amazing museum and is a must-go when in New York.People who are NY, NJ, and CT residents and students can pay however much they want but they have suggested donations. For everyone else it's adults $25, seniors 65+ $17, students $12 (bring your student ID), members and patrons free, and children under 12 free.When you buy a ticket it's valid for 3 days which is really nice because there's no way anyone can go through all 900+ galleries in one entire day. I only spent about three hours here and definitely did not see everything but you can spend all day there and still not be finished.There is just so much art and history and just about everything about everywhere around the world. I was wandering around and just got lost looking at everything I could. I didn't see all the galleries but out of the ones I saw my favorite sections were the 800 and 900 galleries.",1,1,3,Brian F.,"Bellevue, WA",458,573,1855
5.0,4/21/2019,We were visiting our son for the weekend and decided to visit the MET. Since he lived in NY we just had to make a donation which is a nice benefit of him living in Brooklyn. We were blown away by the exhibits and had to pull ourselves away because it was closing. Every room seemed to have a treasure and some of the halls/rooms were so impressive as they were actual places that have been transported and rebuilt here. We only small a small portion of the museum and will definitely return.,1,0,0,Craig C.,"Marshall, MI",2,56,4

5.0,4/16/2019,"Love this museum. One of the reasons I moved to New York 20 years ago. I used to think to myself: When I when I wake up in the morning, I could decide to go to the MET today! Of course, life happens and after I move to NYC, for 10 years I didn't go - then, I have a kid and diapers and stuff - and since she became literate, we go at least once a month, if not more, and it is the rocking place that I always dreamed of going to as part of my life.Of course, because kids are so expensive, I may now have to move out of the City, but until we do, we will continue to live in our micro-habitat and go to the MET regularly!I also was bummed when you no longer got a metal tag at admittance; it's a sticker now, but no points off cos it's a mad expensive institution to upkeep, I am sure.It used to be a best kept secret for years that it's a Pay-as-you-wish entrance fee, but if you have been traveling to New York to see this museum, it no longer is...except if you are a resident of the 5 boroughs (they check ID).",0,0,0,Chloe S.,"New York, NY",32,143,22
5.0,4/15/2019,"If you're a museum buff you can't​ miss the MET. Pop in and pay any price you'd like since the listed prices are only suggested. Then spend a few hours roaming the beautiful​ corridors​ filled with art from around the world. The building itself is art so make sure you take time to appreciate the architectural details of the building as well. This is where I was captivated by Salvador Dali's ""The Crucifixion​"" and subsequently,​ he became one of my favorite artists.  The MET is huge so make sure you grab a map and truly explore or else it's easy to get stuck in one section of the museum. You'll easily be able to spend a few hours here. My favorite area is the Asian collections, so I highly recommend checking it out. It's filled with beautiful Tibetan bodhisattva​ prints and traditional Korean texts. Love it. The MET is the perfect stop if you're spending a hot summer day in Central Park or if you're trying to duck into a warm place on a Winter day.

5.0,4/5/2019,"Okay, five stars because it's the best at what it is: a museum.That said, if you're not really into museums, don't feel guilty skipping this. It definitely still FEELS 200% like a museum, and if you don't like museums, then the MET probably isn't for you, and that's okay.Again--very, very cool. Amazing, important work to preserve SO many artifacts and stories for future generations. The presentation is spectacular and the number of stories behind each exhibit is mind-blowing.

5.0,3/29/2019,"So, you like museums? Then the Met is a dream come true. It's one of the largest museums ever and you can easily make a weekend out of it if you really wanted.What is there? Only like everything. From ancient art to modern art to architecture to treasures, you'll find a bit of everything. Wear some comfortable shoes too cause you'll be walking a whole lot. Witness Greek and Roman sculptures, observe medieval arms and armors, gawk at the absurdity of some dueling pistols, marvel at Egyptian art and sarcophaguses, engross yourself in Asian art, or wonder at what modern art even means. Admission is interesting as it's a ""suggested donation"" but honestly it feels very pressuring to just pay that amount. If you have no shame, you could pay less but hey, I won't judge. Afterwards, or in between, you could stroll around Central Park or grab a lunch nearby. Either way, the Met is at least a half day event.",1,1,2,Derek T.,"Los Angeles, CA",692,644,926
4.0,3/28/2019,"I really enjoyed this but I just wish I had been able to see more of it. We had no idea what time it closed. We showed up, paid for admission and went to check a bag where we were told that we had 25 minutes before they closed. Bad on us for not looking this up or looking at the posted times before we paid to enter but bad on them for not telling us that they were about to close before taking our money. They did point out that the admission was good for two days but that doesn't help when you are getting on a plane the next day and going home. I enjoyed the works of the impressionists as we ran through the gallery and my daughter insisted that we roll through the Egyptian section as well, which she seemed to enjoy a lot.

1.0,3/17/2019,I was really unhappy with the new ticketing process. I'm a NY resident and was really excited to get in for free but when I got inside the line was very long. My date doesn't have an ID so I didn't want to force him to wait in line. That would be embarrassing. So I felt obligated to pay for a full price ticket via the kiosk because as a NY resident you can't buy tickets on the kiosk or online.

There are tours and guides that you can pay for, but also you can go in with a donation. It will take you several hours to see even a part of this place. There is a strong Egyptian, Greek, African, American historical pieces. The Asian art isn't as big as other collections though. There is a cafe inside here, bathrooms, gift shops as well.

5.0,3/13/2019,"As a bibliophile, reading ""From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler"" was an awesome world.  A mix of ""Harriet the Spy"" and ""Boxcar Children"", ""From the Mixed-Up Files"" allowed me a small glimpse into the Met back in the day.  And, since internet wasn't readily available, it allowed me a glimpse of how staying at a museum might be like.I've been to the Met a few times now, and each time I never can get through everything.  Then again, it IS the largest art museum in the U.S.  But, you're not meant to get through every exhibit.  And that's awesome.  Sort of the Disneyland of the art of antiquities, the Met sets itself apart from other museums (in my opinion) by letting you find something you didn't notice before in other visits, even if it's the same exhibit.  I do remember my old high school art days where the art teacher mentioned that people don't spend more than a few seconds on each art they see, and I do have a small guilty feeling each time I hit a museum and rush through it like a roadrunner.  But, by having a finite amount of time in New York each time I visit, I can't help but really just go to the exhibits I really want to see, and try and linger a bit longer than I would if I was trying to accomplish all art pieces in 3 hours.Absolutely overwhelming, though, even if you choose a few exhibits.  And there's always something nagging you to keep on going even when your feet is killing you and you're tired and hungry.  A few favorites: the armory (of weapons), Japanese art, Chinese art, Egyptian art (e.g., Temple of Dendur!!!!), and Tiffany glass displays (ALL girls love Tiffany's, guys!  Or have a special place in their hearts for it).For NY residents, you can pay what you wish for admission to the Met.  For out-of-staters, it is $25 an adult ticket (absolutely worth it to support this museum), with some discounts available for seniors and students.  You can purchase tickets online, at the booth, or even at the kiosks.  Unfortunately/fortunately, there is a security check when you enter the building.  For the tourists, there is (thankfully!) a room where you can drop off your backpack and coat.For all of those that would love a souvenir, the Met does have a large museum store filled with plenty of haute coutre items.  For me, I go for a bookmark, but they're still typically over $10.Will definitely be back. Hands down.  The Met isn't going anywhere, but no visit to NY is complete without a trip here.",2,1,1,Grace C.,"Anaheim, CA",54,950,1852

5.0,2/16/2019,"What a great museum that highly deserves its five star rating! Generally most are going to try to visit both the Met and American Museum of Natural History in one day. While one can do so, please take your time in each and specifically the Met since you are viewing this page for more info on it.Celeb parties aside the Met is one of the hippest spots to visit in NYC, so plan ahead as it gets pretty busy. I was a dummy and showed up on the day of the Gala, completely confused why I was being brushed away. Ended up coming back another day as there was no way I was going to miss out on it. The price tag is actually approachable unlike other attractions in the city where you cringe when having to pay for them. While talking about tickets, buy them online if possible as during peek tourist season the indoor lines are quite long. Once you get your map, head in any direction whether with a plan or without one as you will not be disappointed or upset. Whether you are into African, Egyptian, Renaissance, Modern Art, Greek, American, et'cetera, the Met has it all! Easily hit my top five museum list after a visit and that shares the ranks of the Louvre, British Museum, Uffitzi, and Prado. I think when all was said and done I'd spent close to four hours in the museum and the best part is, its located in Central Park, so you can add on a beautiful park stroll afterwards. There are plenty of water stations, food stands, and restrooms inside as well and of course coat check for those carrying heavy items (Complementary).

It's a dramatic installation as to the purpose and power that jewelry brings to our lives and how it transformed the world. I was mesmerized! Go catch this while it's still showing, I think it's just limited to a few more weeks.I love that you could go back as many times at The Met and still be enthralled. Just like The Louvre in Paris. And art aside, I love going to the museum's rooftop bar especially during those wonderful summer evenings to just enjoy a glass or two of wine, best with your special someone and closest friends. I'm always on the lookout for the current and upcoming exhibitions because they put so much research and work to execute it wonderfully. And for the state of NY residents, fret not, it's still donation basis, pay as you wish. Visitors (adults) from all others are required to pay $25 for entrance now so hope this helps!When I need to put on my tourist guide hat for family and friends who visit, The Met is definitely one of our stops and it doesn't stop at the steps of the museum. ;)Enjoy my favorites from the ongoing exhibition!",1,0,0,Joanne U.,"New York, NY",51,104,179

I would give it a 5-star on that!HOWEVER, I am also impressed by the terrible and rude staff there! My dad in-law was watching one of Monet's paintings in that morning. He was pointing (NOT TOUCHING) at a corner of the painting and chatting with my wife about this great piece of art. Suddenly, I heard one old bit*h yelling towards us ""Don't touch""! WHAT THE FUCK! ARE YOU FUCKING BLIND!!! My dad in-law was at least 2-foot away from that painting. When did you see him touching that painting!!!!!!! This was the first thing I noted how rude the staff there were! Trust me, you wouldn't have any motion to have fun after that!Then, the second thing that really pissed me off happened the next day. We were trying to enter the museum and another old short lady with a pair of glasses stopped us. My wife asked her NICELY to see if we can use the ticket for 3-day admission (if you buy one ticket, it allows you to visit there for 3 days). We were, you know, expecting some useful information. Instead, she said ""go to the admission desk! Get you new ticket! Don't talk to me!"" And she did not even look at us! Then my wife wanted to ask her more questions, she simply IGNORED us!!! No patience at all!!! What the fuck! You could have been treating visitors from all over the world MORE POLITELY. Don't you know that????????? YOU ARE RUDE!!! Is this how the Met trains their employees? Shame on you Met! You should have trained your staff more professionally! Tell them to show at least their respect to your visitors! We paid our tickets and didn't deserve such a bad service! I used to love the Met, BUT NOT ANY MORE BECAUSE OF YOUR RUDE STAFF!!! I did filled out a complaint form and I REALLY hope the Met can treat visitors' complaint seriously and don't throw it away as a piece of garbage! You definitely need to improve your service a lot! BTW, for the first 2-day visit, no one has ever checked our tickets and told us that we need new tickets for our visit next day. NO ONE!

I greatly enjoyed the Everything is Connected: Art and Conspiracy exhibit. I am however disappointed with the new admission Met fees. The entry fee used to be a suggested admission: pay what you will. I feel that although it is still affordable for students of the tri-state area and residents of New York, it is cutting off access for all those who do not fall into those categories and can not afford to pay $25. Especially if a parent would like to take their family. The exhibit I mentioned, Everything is Connected: Art and Conspiracy should especially be viewed by those of lower income communities and people of color.

5.0,1/3/2019,"One of the best museums I have been to. Prepare for a long time to spend here, otherwise you won't be able to see everything. My husband and I ended up spending a little more than 2 hours the first visit, and returned on the third day for another 2 hours. Your ticket is good for 3 days and includes two other MET locations. If you live in NYC/NJ/or a student, the ticket cost is a suggested donation. We were from out of state so we were at the kiosk and bought our tickets. Technically if you really want to, you can purchase ""student"" even though you are not because the ticket does not specify if you are an adult or a student nor do the staff check when you enter. We were happy paying full adult prices because I think it is worth that much. I recommend getting a map/guide and looking at it closely. There is a dotted red line which shows the easiest way to go through the museum. We totally overlooked that and ended up zig-zagging our way through the museum.Again, there is SO MUCH to see. The Egyptian art alone could take you an entire day if you wanted to look at every single one of the artifacts. My favorite part of the museum was the instruments exhibit. As a musician, it was so awesome to see historical musical instruments in the display. Another one of my favorites was the jewelry exhibit.When you exit the museum, you may be tempted to take one of the many yellow taxis outside because your legs may be sore. Do not.

You also get access to this restaurant (The Balcony Lodge) if you're a member. Only reason why I am giving the place 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the restaurant area. I haven't had a chance to try the other places in the Met, but the service and food at the lounge was not the best. I am not too into foofoo foods and I feel like the menu only had those options.

Unfortunately we were on day three of a crazy Christmas New York trip and they were completely walked out and peopled out. The museum however was still wonderful! We got a great map, my husband and I each paid $25, my 14-year-old was $12, and my 12-year-old was free.  It was crowded but there are so many rooms you can sort of escape people. Well, not really. Wear your backpack on the front, they won't let you wear it on the back and they will check it as you come in but it's very cursory, you can take pictures but not with flash, don't touch the art. My son liked seeing the weapons, they were medieval rooms, Italian art, sculpture, basically endless, basically if you weren't tired  it you would take hours and hours and hours do you see at all. Two floors, huge. Every piece of art was well described and you can get an audio tour that we didn't bother with.

5.0,12/17/2018,"I have to say this is one of the best museums I've ever visited. You could spend the whole day here and it is not enough to admire and appreciate all the art available in this humongous museum. For admission, we have to pay $25 but if you're a student, you only need to pay $12 which I think either way is worth the cost.I don't appreciate paintings as much as I hope to so I get easily bored when I visit museums that mainly focus on paintings. However, this is not the case with the Met. It has a wide variety of art forms that comes in all shapes and sizes. Due to my lack of interest towards painting, I only paid attention to exhibitions that appealed to me like Jewelry, weapons, armors and the list goes on. I really had a great and enjoyable time getting lost in the Met. Even with that process of elimination, I still did not have enough time to check out all that I want to see so I guess you really need to know what you wish to see and invest your time there.There will be random benches spread around the museum so you can take a breather whenever you want. I made a mistake of bringing a big backpack into the Met and you have to carry it facing front at all times. That easily caused my back to sore so avoid bringing bag if possible or just a small one will do.

5.0,11/19/2018,"I specifically came to New York to finally check out the Met because I wanted to see things in my Art History book in real life. In fact, I threw down some cash on Viator to book the Empty Met Tour, where you come in at 830AM before the museum opens and get a good 1.5 hour tour with a guide as an intro to the museum. I am not a fan of crowds and people in general, so this is my jam. EMPTY MET TOUR NOTES:It's $175 (more on weekends). A group of us gathered at the front doors since there were zero instructions on whether or not we were supposed to go inside. Eventually closer to 830am we moved inside and checked our coats. Note on coat check, there will be a long line when you leave to pick up your coat, allow 15 extra minutes to retrieve it. The tour groups have a max of about 12 people. The tour guide brings you through the older collection of Egyptian, sculpture, Polynesian art, and other rooms you probably wouldn't venture into under other circumstances as a tourist. Our tour guide was also helpful in giving you tips on where to go if you need some respite from the crowds. So if you wanted to go on this tour hoping to see the more notable recognizable work from the old masters and impressionists, this tour isn't for you. The tour guide will give you a good foundation of Art History in general so come to this if you want to learn. Though once the tour ends, you'll have a chance to dash over to those galleries to check out the notable works before the crowds. TICKETS: It doesn't say it, but the Empty Met admission is the same admission ticket type you'd get if you bought it on your own. That means it's valid for 3 consecutive days and also gives you entry to the Met Breuer and Cloisters.The museum itself is HUGE. You will wander around there lost like you're trying to get out of an IKEA. I spent 6 hours in there trying to cover every single gallery and maybe saw 90% of it. SKETCHING: If you're into it, there's a surprising lack of sketch supplies in the museum shop. Do yourself a favor and go to the Art Student's League art supply shop south of Central park and pick up some proper pencils and sketch books since most of what they offer in the museum shop are lined notebooks. FOOD: Meh. It's fuel to get you through your day. Don't expect anything remarkable. Maybe there are better offerings, but the Cafe I went to was not good.All in all, I loved this museum and will always come back. Tons of sculpture and deep cut old master paintings. I can see it being overwhelming on a Louvre level, but it makes a good day of wandering around and killing time.

Kids under the age of 12 are free but above that tickets are $100 at least. I also really enjoyed the Egyptian section with the mummies. All the artwork and designs are very intricate and unique. There is artwork you will probably not find anywhere else and it is from all different cultures. There are pottery, paintings, sculptures, artifacts, and so much else from pretty much everywhere in the world. I have been to Portugal, China, England, Italy, Spain, the Caribbean, Canada, and France and art cannot get more original.

It's a staple to New York and can't be forgiven if you as a tourist don't pay it a visit! This time I went with a group of folks from Kentucky , with half of us being immigrants and the other half, first time New Yorkers. Since I've been to NYC countless times over the last few years of living in the USA, I've taken the liberty to show these folks some culture. What Better place to start than the world famous MET!!! I'm not gonna go into detail on what we've seen since we scattered all over the place. I was more into European sculptures, arms and armor and Egyptian art and the rest of the group covered various other parts. (Greek and Roman art etc...) If you think that this is gonna be a quick In and out, you're greatly mistaken. We have spent a total of 6 hours to cover the regions we were interested in. And honestly we needed at least 2-3 more to feel not as rushed. They do have two cafes located on each wing. (The American wing cafe on the north side and the Petrie ct cafe on the west) Both were decent choices with some basic coffee and snacks/pastries to sip/eat on rest your feet and continue the endeavors. On the way out we did visit the gift shop and got some souvenirs and a few books from the adjacent bookstore. All in all it was an amazing experience for all parties involved, and if I lived in NYC I'd be a regular!!!

Many friends on and off Yelp recommended this place, and I am glad that I took their recommendations to heart.Admission to this museum is inexpensive, considering the size and number of exhibits you will see here. After buying my ticket, and presenting it to security, I was well on my way to see this magnificent place.The exhibits here were divided by historical era and culture. Of all the exhibits, I enjoyed the ones representing ancient Egypt, Persia, and several ancient east-Asian cultures. The architecture of this place is impressive in itself. The outside of the building is as impressive as the inside, and walking through the halls of this museum will give you an in depth experience in each particular cultural exhibit.There are staff members all over this place, and they are friendly and helpful in guiding you through this place.Although I came here on a chilly and rainy day, this museum was still packed with locals and tourists. It was pretty cool meeting visitors from all over the world, which is something I like when going to touristy places such as this one.If you find yourself in New York City, this place is a must.

I was really excited to see the Heavenly Bodies exhibit after seeing the MET Gala on TV. The exhibit was so beautiful, all the gowns were​ gorgeous!! I'm sure you can read other Yelp reviewers on how amazing the MET is, but here are some things to consider when visiting the MET your first time. - Purchase your ticket ahead of time. It's a tourist destination, the lines are extremely long to purchase a ticket and let alone you have to get in line to enter the museum​. One thing the MET should try to be better at is creating signs of where you can get your REAL TICKET after pre-purchasing them online. Also, the machines that print​ out the actual tickets is quite annoying. The scanner takes forever to read your ticket. - Your MET ticket is typically good for 2 days. (There are some restrictions, I would look into it) - Plan ahead of what wing you want to explore first. You will feel extremely overwhelmed if you try to finish the museum in 1 day. - The most famous artworks are always crowded.

Even if you spent a dozen hours here, unless you just took a cursory glance at every exhibit, you would never be able to enjoy the majority of the exhibit. As a recommendation I would just stick to one or two sections as that should be enough to eat 3-4 hours of your time. I only saw the Greek and Roman art during my visit and that took me nearly 5 hours. I must say though I am a history buff and I reviewed every single display and read every single description of every artifact.I must say that I found the audio-guide to be quite worthless. It may have its benefits in other sections of the exhibit but for the Greek and Roman sections, it gave only a superficial overview of the exhibit most of which I already knew. Even if I didn't previously know this information, nothing of major note would have been lost if I did not get the audio guide.My only complaint would be that I wish they were more specific about the size and scope of new collections. During my visit they were showing an exhibition of Medusa, the Gorgon, which is the main reason I went. The exhibit was fine but it was isolated to one room. I probably would not have rushed to go to the Museum if I knew the exhibit was this minuscule.The Met Store is actually quite good and large in scope from books to stationery, scarfs and original (but expensive in the thousands of dollars) artwork.

5.0,9/26/2018,"When I was in high school, I took AP Art History mainly because we had planned field trips off campus to explore the many art museums in the LA area. But in doing so, I became a life-long lover and advocate of the arts. I love art in its many forms from music, sculpture, street murals, and fine paintings. The Metropolitan Museum of Art is a mecca of sorts for art lovers. I first visited the Met years ago, shortly after 9/11 in 2001. They had suggested donations back then where you could pay what you could. I believe, they still do but for locals. This time around on a rainy NYC day, I paid the adult price of $25, but I was told that my admission was good for 3 days! Too bad, I only had a couple hours to peruse the hallowed halls of art history's greats. Hot tip: they have ticket kiosks now so you don't have to stand in line. Just walk up to a kiosk and pay with your credit card. I realized this after checking in my umbrella and jacket. My favorites are the French Impressionists and I wandered around looking at all the paintings and sculptures I could stand. Auguste Rodin is one of my favorite sculptors and the Met has a rather sizeable collection of Rodin's sculptures. I went looking for their newest exhibition but got lost in one of the wings. There are benches for you to sit on in each room and there are guards in every wing. Photography is allowed but no flash photography. By the time my friends wanted to meet up, I had run out of time to explore. To this day, the Met remains one of my favorite museums second only to the Louvre in Paris.

I had a small duffel bag with me because I was going to catch a flight right after my visit, so I was worried that I would get turned away. They let me check my bag in the coat room, so that was a huge relief. The museum itself is huge, so I had a hard time seeing everything. Despite trying to follow a logical order with the numbers, each room has 3-4 doorways, so I got lost pretty frequently. My favorite exhibits were the pointillist paintings, the replicas of french rooms, and of course the Heavenly Bodies exhibit. The Heavenly Bodies was really something. It was interesting and a bit crowded, but I enjoyed looking at all of the fashion. The one thing I didn't like was the photography exhibit. It was filled with photos of people from the 60's but there were barely any names attached to the pictures. Do these individuals or their relatives know that their faces are on display in the Met? Do they know that the Met is profiting off of their images? I thought it was a little odd. Most pictures you see in museums are centuries old so not having names is understandable, but many of these people may still be alive.The bathrooms were also hard to find. There wasn't much signage.

This place can get very crowded so I prefer to go early.-They have a bag and coat check if you don't want to carry your things around all day.

I hadn't cared to go because I thought art museums meant a bunch of rooms with paintings. Shows what I know!This is not just paintings. The place is chalk full of lifesize buildings, and beautiful clothing, furniture, and sculptures! I realized I had no idea of what exactly the title of the museum encompassed. I was blown away and entranced by some famous works I actually recognized. The downsize is this place is massive. We gave it a good hard go but still didn't manage to see everything on a bustling weekend. Your feet will be angry with you and you will have to skim through most rooms to really get through a good chunk of the place.

My husband and I went there last weekend and they are currently showing The Fashion and the Catholic Imagination. The dresses, paintings and jewelry were magnificent! Next, we visited the Egyptian Temple where you can see a lot of mummy tombs! No pyramids though:( Our favorite room would be the Arms and Weapons of different countries! Spectacular! The details in each and every weapon such as the sword and guns are very distinctive! Envision the diamonds, gold, pearls and emerald embedded in the sword! Beautiful! And the weight of the armors and chainmails are heavy! (50kg according to the description) Imagine wearing them on top of a horse holding a sword and fighting for your life! A sight to behold! The MET is truly a place that should be visited when you are NY. Free entrance (donation) and don't forget to check the Garden at the rooftop! Instead of paying for Empire State or Top of the Rock or One World Observatory, The MET has a better view of the city and will not break your budget!

In that time we managed to see the permanent ancient Egypt installation, which goes on and on, and we walked through Heavenly Bodies, which is here until October 8, 2018.We went on a Sunday and it was a bit of a mad house. Hoards of people were trying to get through the exhibits. Next time we're in town we'll try to come during a weekday.The Egyptian collection is worth the trip on its own. The Met had curators helping with archeological digs in the early 1900's so they often got first dibs on artifacts, which were shipped back to New York. Making this one of the best collections of Egyptian artifacts in the world. Despite my loathing of the Catholic Church. The Heavenly Bodies exhibit was really interesting. The museum made several connections between the hierarchy of fashion to the strict hierarchy in the Catholic Church. They also drew parallels to the theatrics of Catholicism and haute couture. One of my favorite pieces was a video from 1976 playing on an old Sony tv called Roma. It's a farcical haute couture runway show of Catholic fashion directed by Fellini.

This has to be one of the best tours I've ever experienced!Our high-energy, enthusiastic, and fast-walker tour guide Lindsay, kept us engaged for the two hour duration by telling us funny/scandalous stories about particular pieces of artwork, used technology (iPad) to enhance the experience past what the plaques on the wall stated, encouraged team building games, and took us to exclusive areas of the museum.My favorite part of the tour was when we went to the rooftop gallery (who knew there was a rooftop at the MET?!) and took a group photo in front of the beautiful NYC skyline. At the end, we each received a Polaroid picture of our rooftop photo!I do think the $99 tour price was a bit steep, considering that I was under the impression that a glass of wine would be included, and we didn't receive any. I guess when you consider how expensive NYC is and how much you typically pay for a ticket to a show, it puts the price into a realistic perspective.

I only found one bathroom in the entire place, too -- and the 2nd time I did go there, I was verbally abused by the bitter, angry janitor lady...I was pretty appalled to witness her literally yelling at multiple people in the bathroom for trying to use them when she was cryptically cleaning random stalls in the middle of the day.

3.0,8/25/2018,"It's a great museum. I've been a member for a couple of years. I enjoy the 5th Ave location and the Cloisters. I have yet to visit the Met Breuer. I was not impressed by the presentation of the  ""Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination"" exhibit. The exhibit, curated by Anna Wintour as part of the Met Gala, consists of a lot of designer gowns inspired by the Roman Catholic church, which are housed within the medieval collection. The gowns, displayed on mannequins, are mostly satin prom dresses with flowers and brocade, nondescript and repetitive. There are about 20 of them on large platforms that take up a lot of space, more floor space than the galleries have to spare. There is overbearing religious music playing and the lights are dark. The overall effect is that the galleries are crowded without clear walkways and it's hard to see the medieval art. Sort of ruins the experience of being in a museum and makes it more like being in Zara, but I guess the Met needs money. A better way of presenting ""Heavenly Bodies"" would have been to place 1 or 2 gowns in the medieval gallery, with the rest in a separate gallery devoted to fashion. That way patrons in the medieval collection would be aware of the special exhibit, but not prevented from enjoying the medieval art.",0,0,0,Heather B.,"Highland Park, NJ",45,32,2

5.0,8/18/2018,"I don't know that I ever expected The Met to collect, let alone exhibit, the works of Thornton Dial and Lonnie Haley.  Thanks to a gift from the Souls Grown Deep Foundation, this museum has begun to fill some gaping (and embarrassing) holes in their collection.Among the 57 works on display, Mr. Dial's 'The End of November - The Birds That Didn't Learn How to Fly,' was the standout for me.  It's a 2007 piece made of quilt, wire, fabric, and enamel on canvas on wood of ten birds hanging from a wire against a purplish-pale background.  After having visited the Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama, only a few months ago, Mr. Dial's gripping reference to the Jim Crow south era of lynching resonated with me long after my visit.  This is an iconic image and I'm glad it's at this museum.The 'Heavenly Bodies' exhibition features the richly-imaginative couture of designers on the main level.  Catholic influence certainly reaches an erotic level here culminating, for me, in the blood red silk taffeta evening dress of Pierpaolo Piccioli.  Mercy.  (The definitely not erotic vestments, trinkets, and ornament of past Popes is on display on the lower level.  I wish I had taken a magnifying glass with me as the bejeweled level of craftsmanship and detail on the crowns is stunning.)",5,0,3,Paul L.,"Los Angeles, CA",248,921,23478

By the way, for out-of-state visitors, they charge $25 which is OK. But our Los Angeles Getty Center is free for everyone.  Can't say Cali in general is generous but at least for museums, NYC is really stingy.  When you need services, it really depends on who you ask. Generally, try to avoid requesting help from certain type of people who you can feel they aren't willing to assist.  They will give you excuse or just say they are busy with something else. So pretty much try to be self serve and not to ruin the vacation's mood. The museum closes at 5:15PM not 5:30PM.

5.0,8/3/2018,"The MET is an incredible, extensive, and diverse collection of art. I would get there before 10, as the line starts forming at about 9:45. It wasn't a long wait to buy a ticket at this time, but when I walked back into the lobby at noon, it was hectic with very long lines. I believe the chaos was confined to the lobby, as (most) of the galleries were not too bad. If you are a NYS resident, or a student from surrounding states, you get to choose what amount you pay for admission. This is particularly great as it allows even those who do not have money to spare to be able to enjoy fine art. My time here was limited--I had about 3 hours to kill before another obligation, and it was far from enough time. I didn't even make it beyond the first floor, as the downstairs collections were so breathtaking and extensive. I began with the Egyptian art, which was organized mostly chronologically, and accompanied by a fine timeline summarizing historical events and significance. I believe the oldest piece was from about 4000 BC. After this, I wandered over to the Greek and Roman collections, which were amazing. They even had a rare depiction of Hermaphrodites, the intersex child of Hermès and Aphrodite, on display. What really blew my mind here was their extensive Southeast Asian and Melanesian collection. I have found that such populations are highly underrepresented not only in galleries, but in popular culture overall. The gallery carefully depicted and described each artifact and cultural significance, moving across the thousands of islands in this area. Beautifully done. The one gallery that was the most packed was the Heavenly Bodies exhibit. In my opinion, I believe this gallery is highly overrated, as it touts gowns made by modern day designers with no actual historical significance. The gowns themselves are definitely beautiful, however, I believe people only make a fuss about them because of the names. The phenomena of how people will pay thousands of dollars more for an item once you place a designers label on it is largely at play. It's a shame that there wasn't as much interest shown to the rich historical art in the MET.

Just putting it out there so you an plan accordingly as it will save you an extra $25- per person (I feel it's very affordable). I was keen to visit The Met after thoroughly enjoying the cloisters, we chose to visit mid afternoon on a Friday knowing that The Met was opened late on a Friday. We purchased our tickets online prior to arriving. To be honest it really didn't save that much time as we still had to print off our tickets/stickers at a booth to wear whilst visiting the museum. You could literally spend an entire day and then some here there is so much to see for the avid art/history/architecture lover. We spent a few hours as any more than that for my family would have been a push. I found the Heavenly Bodies exhibition very moving it was extremely busy being a Friday afternoon. My next interest was the Dutch Masters some of the artworks were not on site due to part of the museum being closed off for an exhibition later this year. I was really happy when I found all the other Masterpieces and was certainly mesmerised at all of these being housed in one place, such an extensive collection. Next stop was downstairs in The Gardens of Provence exhibition. There is so much on offer at The Met. I feel there is something there for everyone. Highly recommended.

3.0,7/17/2018,"The allure of this museum was tarnished by my visit to the MoMA several days prior to my visit here. The diversity here is noteworthy, but overall the Met offered me less art that I personally loved than the MoMA.I also hated that they charge $25 per person. That is not nominal. I strongly believe art should be open to the public, but do understand they have overhead. $25 still seems excessive, especially considering how overcrowded this place was on a Monday in May. They also had closed several sections and seemed preoccupied with displaying costumes from the Met Gala. Honestly, how was any outfit from the Met Gala art worthy to be housed here? Seriously, I do not know, but this seemed more sensational and superficial than artistically valuable.I would advise anyone to know exactly what is on exhibit and choose to explore those sections because your visit might become a drag, my visit definitely was. I should have only focused on the paintings on the second floor. That is where they housed Vincent van Gogh, Cezanne, Monet, Degas, Seurat, Courbet, etc. The first floor had ancient artifacts that I spent (read, wasted) too much time on. If I could redo my trip to the Met I would only venture through the Renaissance  to modern  paintings and avoid the redundant Egyptian artifacts, tombs, and jewelry, I'd avoid the armor, instruments, and costumes, and I'd avoid early American art too. The masterpieces located in the one modern and contemporary art section is where it is at and I felt rushed when I finally discovered this amazing section.So, know what you want to see and spend your time there because otherwise you will become overcome with fatigue and exhaustion before nonchalantly going through half a floor.Another thing I personally disliked was the set up. Unlike the MoMA, the Met was disorganized and haphazardly arranged. There seemed to be a lack of coordination and flow from room to room. And if I thought the MoMA was maze-like, the Met is a labrinyth and you could definitely get lost here. There were several times when I had to get my bearings by asking the aggressive attendants standing about--and I'm great with direction.I would love to return and take my time. The paintings here were esquisite, but I think MoMA has a better collection of modern paintings.",0,0,0,M C.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,233,2765

4.0,7/4/2018,"I really wish that I could split this review in two. One for the staff and the other for the exhibits. My family and I waited outside in a very long line for the museum to open which wasn't a problem. We had planned to go through the main entrance but were instructed to go through the education entrance which was closer to where we were anyway. We waited in line patiently and came into the door. I was wearing a backpack which was empty except for a small wallet. We entered together and I was instructed when we tried to go through security that since I had a backpack, I had to have it checked at a table to my right by security. That wasn't the problem. As I had moved back into the line (as directed), the person who was in back of me approached the security table while I moved to the right so I would not be standing in the way or cutting the line. I stood at the table while security searched his bag and moved the line. My son came up behind me and asked me what was taking so long and I stated that the security agent knows I'm there. At this point, she snapped at me and said something to the effect of ""Why did you go around!""  Hhhmmmm.... On the flip side, everyone else at the museum was professional and courteous.

And on a hot day (today it was 98) the Met is a perfect place. The air conditioning made the museum feel cool and comfortable. They had an amazing exhibit Heavenly Bodies:Fashion and the Catholic Imagination. In the hall with that exhibit they had classic music playing in the background that set a tone for what you are about to see.The only disappointing part of the Met is that they don't have Kosher options in their cafeteria or cafes. They have a few snack bars and drinks that are Kosher. But they have no packaged Kosher sandwiches or salads. This disappointed me.

Those who aren't from NY, they're not extremely strict on getting your ticket... but anyways.I think you could just go into this place and explore.

My brain can only take a few sections during one visit, so when I was living in NYC I took a morning (a couple of hours) to focus on a few sections and then left. That was only because I had the luxury of living in NYC for years. If you are going for a full-day, utilize the benches and spaces in different areas so you can immerse yourself in art throughout the day. The Met recently changed policies around their admission fees (as of March 2018). New York State residents and students in NY, NJ, CT have no fixed admission fee (donation based).

There's no explanation whatsoever in the museum walls in other languages, well that passes, but there were no brochures in any other languages only in English, that's very disrespectful towards the visitor that has taken all the efforts to travel to NY and she/he can't fully enjoy the visit. It would be nice to have some international information visible, even brochures in other languages than English, maybe at least in Spanish which is the second most spoken language in the world and also in the US (with more than 41 million Spanish speakers within US territory).  All in all, I find it even worse and  unjustified that they make pay full price to tourists from abroad, when as I stated, they can't fully enjoy the experience of this magnificent museum because of either the laziness or disregard of this institution that are incapable of  providing information to our valuable tourists in their languages, just in  English.

5.0,5/17/2018,"In the tradition of a 2006 movie---Night at the Museum, I would love to spend an entire week at this museum. It's my absolute favorite museum in NYC (tying first place with The British Museum in London).I've been to The Met countless times and with each visit, I fall in love a little more, discovering new collections and tirelessly viewing the permanent ones. Unfortunately, on this recent visit, I didn't take any pictures as I left my phone home. Maybe that's a good thing as I would have easily taken at least 150 photos.This just means you'll have to pay a visit for the first or tenth time.The ""pay as you wish"" policy has been eliminated for most people; however, it still applies to NYS residents (and tri-state area students) so make sure to carry proper ID.When I visited, it was beyond crowded--and I believe I know why.Since the museum is so huge, some of their collections/exhibits are always revolving & changing.Currently on exhibit through October 8, 2018, is ""Heavenly Bodies, Fashion and the Catholic Imagination"". This was breathtakingly beautiful and captured fashion and medieval art in the tradition of Catholicism. The pieces on exhibit were ornate, opulent and rich in history. You do not have to have a Catholic background/faith to appreciate the gorgeousness of this collection. Some of the wonderful artwork depicted were Vatican attire worn by past Popes, such as Pope Pius. Yet other rich pieces of art were jeweled crosses and various Catholic symbolism. This exhibit is highly recommended and should not be missed.The Cloisters co-join this theme with an exhibit of their own at their Fort Tryon location (another gorgeous museum).In addition to this wonderful ongoing exhibit, the museum contains art spanning 5000 years from every cornerstone of the world.

It's like pieces of art inside a piece of art. Other art museums in the city are no match. This has literally thousands of pieces from the early years of civilization to modern times. It's not just a bunch of paintings. The knight armor collection is pretty cool, and you don't even have to like Game of Thrones. Be aware about the admission.

My better half loves art whereas I'm more into historic archives. The Met is a perfect hybrid for us, since there's plenty of both to go around. I highly recommend getting there early as well as mapping out your journey ahead of time so you get to see all the things you want in a day or so... while still getting out and seeing the other important highlights of NYC. Clearly the Egyptian relics are a highlight, as are the European sculptures. I particularly enjoyed the American wing with paintings/furniture/housewares from the 18th century. Another highlight? We got a sneak peek (emphasis on ""peek"" since many of it was shrouded in secrecy) of the Met Gala exhibit, which was being finalized less than a week before the big event of 2018. We even had a sighting of Andrew Bolton, curator for the museum. Unfortunately with all of the event goings on, the costume institute was closed. Alas, it means another trip to The Met sooner than later. Yes, it's crowded. Yes, it costs money for non-locals and non-students to get inside.

5.0,5/9/2018,"What is not to love about the MET?! It's a place I have been spending hours at a time exploring since I was a child, and it's somehow always a different experience each time, even if some of the pieces I see are the same. The MET transports you to a new world with each gallery and exhibition hall you walk through. While there aren't interactive exhibits for children, it's still a great place to take them especially through the Egyptian wing where the Temple of Dendur is located (Sackler Wing). It's a large open room with an entire glass siding so natural light gets in, as well as a ""pool"" where you can throw pennies and what not to make wishes. Great spot to sit down and chat with friends or take children since it's somewhere they can actually run around just a little!For adults, when the weather gets warmer they open up the rooftop bar and all I can say is what a view. The drinks are pretty good but that view is to die for! They also have a food court downstairs but I have yet to visit...

Most artifacts aren't describe as well as someone explaining it in more detail. There are a lot of people during weekend. Esp using the restroom near the entrances. There are a lot of restrooms throughout the museum but most people go to the ones near the entrances, so if you can hold it, you're better off. Lots of tourists come by this place. It is expensive for tourists. However if you're a student, resident of NY, you can pay as much as your want!! There are different exhibits to choose from.

4.0,5/7/2018,"Cons: 1) Bathrooms. Not enough of them and always a crazy long line. Really ruins the museum experience when you're waiting to pee for an hour. 2) They've done away with the ""pay what you can"" model for most patrons (it's now only NY residents or students from the tri-state region). I always appreciated how the Met made art accessible to all - while I understand the reasoning behind the admission changes, it's still disheartening. 3) The gift shop is basically extortion with those pricesPros: Just about everything else. The Met has the most incredible collection of pieces ancient and contemporary that you can possibly imagine. It's no wonder that I've lived in NYC for over a year now and I've still only seen a fraction of the pieces on display. I love the traveling exhibits (especially those hosted by the Costume Institute), but other must-sees in my humble opinion include the mummy/Egyptian exhibit, the Medieval armor, and the contemporary art, which has a number of Picassos/Monets/Manets/Matisses/etc. The museum staff is also INCREDIBLE. I have never come across a member of the staff that wasn't amazingly well-versed in the layout of the museum. I find that they are all eager to help and love to give suggestions about what to see and how to maximize your time. Bathrooms aside, the museum itself is breathtaking.

I was there last year and saw people checking in small suitcases at the coat check, and I know I had food in my purse! I couldn't enter today because I had torte in a box, sealed with a ribbon that cost $25 that I said I would leave up with my jacket. The asshole security guy gave me a hard time. I told him it isn't like I am going to eat a cake while staring at art. He was a dick to me telling me ""I already said you cannot come in with it"". I told him ""Can you tell me that again?""

I'm talking, probably a full day. We were planning to be there for a few hours but quickly realized that wasn't even going to be close to enough time.So much amazing art. Such an extensive collection. You can walk through the history of humanity through art at this museum, starting from very early days through modern times.

5.0,3/30/2018,"THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART IS NOT FREE. This is a common misconception that I feel needs to be addressed right off the bat. I have visited this establishment seven times over the course of the past twelve years. I have always been politely asked to make a donation in order to gain admission. There are suggested prices listed at the ticket counter that hover near the $25 per person mark. On my most recent trip in February 2018, the pay-what-you-can model was still in effect. At that time, there were talks of the museum establishing a clear cut, flat rate fee. I highly recommend reviewing the most up to date policy ahead of time. This place can get PACKED very, very quickly. Visitors are encouraged to purchase tickets in advance online, particularly for large groups or school outings, to avoid some hassle. The general public must pass through a metal detector and bag screening before entering the lobby. Best to keep luggage, big purses, or travel packs to a minimum here- I once had some time to kill before a flight home & spent over 30 minutes fooling with a piece of carry on luggage for inspection. With that being said, good Lord is this place worth every moment of one's time. The Met is my number one favorite place in the entire world. Daysssss could be spent exploring this museum and still only a fraction of the artifacts could be viewed. I love the wide range of focus as tribal African art pieces, medieval European tapestries, and Egyptian mummies are just the beginning of the seemingly never ending collection.

There is so much to see and so much of it is interesting, that I decided to take a one-hour free guided tour to really take advantage of my visit. While one hour is not enough time to see ALL the museum, you are guided towards the most important pieces. My tour was made more enjoyable by our guide, Allen M., who was incredibly knowledgeable and friendly. You can tell he loves his job and the arts.

5.0,3/5/2018,"This museum is magic. I traveled from Jersey on a 75° day in February which means a train from Union to Newark Penn to New York Penn to 81st via the C and then just under a mile walk through Central Park to get to the Met and I'd do it again! (Granted, it was a gorgeous day to walk/travel but I digress.) The person who helped me when I first got in was super nice and recommended which areas to go look at once I told her that I didn't have much time to spend and all I can say is..wow. you'd need at least two or three days to really tour the museum as it is massive. The art on display is poignant, appropriate, and filled with strength. I can't wait to go back and if you are deciding which museum to visit on a trip to the City, please make this a priority!

The longest line was for the coat check, but since our coats were pretty light, we just carried them with us. Definitely get a map! There's also a security line for those of us carrying purses (yay for my travel wallet). We just got express tickets at the automated machines once we got in. We started in the ancient Greek section which I think it still one of my favorites in addition to all the Egyptian stuff. I'm always in awe that objects have survived that long, and I'm here in 2018 looking at them. There are 2 restaurants/cafes inside so you could conceivably spend an entire day/afternoon here. The museum often has special displays going so you can get a different experience every time you come. A bonus is that the Met is right next to Central Park and a lot of other great spots like shopping on Madison Ave. Helpfully, since it was raining the day we visited, there was a street vendor selling umbrellas outside the steps. There were plenty of street food vendors out there too. Once we left, the crowds to get in were enormous (the after lunch/church crowd on a rainy afternoon) in the entryway.

5.0,3/1/2018,"Better known as ""the MET"" to us New Yorkers, the Met is always a thoroughly enjoyable, relaxing, and wondrous visit.  You can't help but feel proud as you walk up those majestic steps into the museum and think you're on a movie set.  Oh no - this is real life though, and art is just so dramatic!My most recently magical visit was to see the Michelangelo exhibit, which was really amazing and fascinating at the same time.  From rare sketches he made to those of his influencers, this exhibit sucked you in for a good 2 hours at minimum, if you take gentle care to read each caption and soak in the details.  The weekday I visited the exhibit, I went when the museum just opened, but that didn't stop the long lines of tourists and other visitors to make a bee line right here.  This really was fabulous and worth every penny.Feeling a bit hungry, I opted to eat inside their mini cafe on the top floor, that overlooked the atrium.  Getting a sandwich and coffee will set you back about $20 or more, and it's acceptable because it's the Met.  This is really great for people watching and to collect yourself before you walk into another wing to start another art journey.Egyptian, Grecian, Chinese, Renaissance - this place has it all, and will forever hold fond memories for me, for years to come.",3,2,4,Jaclyn C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1216,896,1227
5.0,2/27/2018,"It's name is legendary. It's reputation one of prestige and luxury. It's events. Well, they are not for everyone, but it's art collection definitely is. Some places are so magical time seems to stop the moment you walk through their doors. The Met is such a place. It's a time machine disguised as something to do on a weekend. It's a college degree presented to the masses for free or a small donation, - really, - you can pay what you like. It's sophistication, culture, and education the way education should be. Not being from the city, I try to stop there every chance I get. There's so much to cover and see and this time around was not the exception. There was a Michelangelo exhibit (which sadly because of time restrictions and a sculpture-threatening two year old) I wasn't able to see. But we perused the hallways of the Roman/Hellenistic wing of the Museum as well as the Egyptian exhibit. The friend I was with had never been to The Met. In fact she had never been to NY for that matter, and this was the perfect way to ease her into the grandiosity of culture offered in NYC.From the Roman funeral busts to that of Socrates (one of only 30 found in the world), the amount of knowledge and history housed within these walls is priceless. It could only be compared in value to the library of Alexandria if it still existed. I would definitely recommend one of the guided tour as the guides are not only knowledgeable but make history come to life with quick side notes and anecdotes that otherwise you'll never get. The one thing I recommend the most is to come with enough time. Enough time to walk around the most interesting halls (you'll never get them all in one day). Enough time to enjoy the food outside. Enough time to enjoy Central Park next door. Enough time to relax, breath, and enjoy the entire of The Met experience.",4,0,3,Jenier M.,"Hollywood, FL",127,88,775

Originally the Met opened in 1880 and it continues to grow - I looked it up, the footprint spans more than 2million square feet!

Unfortunately, we had just this one day to see what we could.  We came to New York to see the Michelangelo Exhibit at the Met, and it was the last day of the show. It was crowded, but we did not have to stand in line.  This was such an interesting prospective of Michelangelo.  We were able to see 133 drawings, 3 marble sculptures, his earliest painting, and a wood model for a chapel vault. They even had a replica of the Sistine Chapel ceiling.  This exhibition highlighted Michelangelo's rich legacy as a supreme draftsman and designer. We spent the rest of our time there soaking up each and every room we visited.  We especially enjoy seeing the Temple of Dendron and marveled at how they moved this temple from Egypt and, piece by piece, recreated it in an impressive space at the Met.  Another exhibit that we were thrilled to see was The Silver Caesars: A Renaissance Mystery - showcasing an extraordinary set of 12 Caesars silver-gilt standing cups known collectively as the Aldobrandini Tazze. The mystery is that they do not know who made these 12 statues of Caesar.We are concerned about the Met changing from the ""pay as you can"" admission to a set price of $25.00 a ticket ($17.00 for seniors - $12.00 for students) for non-New York State residents; with children under 12 free for out of state and international visitors. This ticket will be good for 3 consecutive days at The Met Fifth Avenue, The Met Breuer, and The Met Cloisters.

However,since they were running yet another member event at the same time...DISASTER!MEMBERSHIP!HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO GET OUT OF THE RED AND KEEP PEOPLE COMING BACK WHEN YOU DO THE THINGS YOU DO!. I am a member and so there is no special entrance for me, I have to stand in the lines with everyone else and wait to get in, and even though I'm attending another event I'm not allowed to eat in any of the food places yet the other people who are attending another member event at the same time are! I dont recall if it was free but it was reservation required to view a  certain gallery for that other event. I was told that another upgrade would let me go at various evening hours once in a blue moon but it really wasn't worth it for me to do that by a membership person so I did not but thats fine because there were other things there I could pay to attend there at my own timetable.I overheard someone very upset having the same exact conversation with a staff member like I was having. I actually heard she said she upgraded her membership just so she could get something to eat! Even though she wasn't attending the gallery event since it was near where the food was available to be purchased as it wasn't free because I saw  her later and she was talking to her companion about their meal for two small packaged sandwiches a tea and coffee she spent $38.00. Granted everything in that area of town is expensive although there's not much in the way of places to eat around  there which would be close. But at least she was able to convince someone to help her out unlike me. I believe she paid an additional $100 as well just for an upgrade. I think this membership thing really needs to be revamped because the perks really aren't worth it. They don't even let members in ahead of everyone else or even  20 minutes ahead of everyone else. It's really ridiculous If you can't go during the day and they're only open once a month at night maybe, for special events on certain nights. I think my money is better spent on other things then a membership and if I want to see something and stand in line and not get something to eat and not be treated like a member and that's just fine because then I won't be  paying  a hundred or $200.

5.0,2/14/2018,"If you're an art lover, you must visit The Metropolitan Museum of Art. This museum, better known as the MET, has so much to see. You can easily spend days in there.This marks the second occasion I go. I first went in 2011, and now in 2018, the museum has not lost any of its splendor. If anything, it seems larger, better, more populated, but this also may be that time, perspective, it is everything.Price to go in for an adult is $25. Or at the very least that's the suggested price. I think it is worth its weight in gold. You can purchase your ticket online or in person. When you do it in person, you can either get it at the information desk or a kiosk. We did it at a kiosk and had no issues.There are various floors go to. Given the limited amount of time we had, we chose to focus onto two areas. The Egyptian section and the Italian section. At the time, there was also an exhibit of Michelangelo running, but we didn't go see it as lines were ridiculous, and well, this is coming from me that I lived in Paris and went to the Louvre often.Anyhow, something else to note. Apparently on Friday and Saturday nights, there are extended hours. The museum is open until 9 PM, so just that is pretty amazing.If you're limited on time and/or just want to hit the main spots, I would suggest the following:-Definitely do the Egyptian section. This is probably the biggest collection of Egyptian artifacts in the US. Among the artifacts found there, you can see hieroglyphics, mummies (and no, I didn't take photos as I'm superstitious), and the famed sphinx of Hatshepsut.-The Death of Socrates by Jean Jacques David. This is a Neoclassic work and it is time and time again referenced in books of art history.-Henry VIII's armor, which ironically I didn't see this time around, as well as Asian art. Seriously speaking, there is just so much to do here that you won't know what to do with yourself.-Madonna and Child by Duccio. Super famous and surprisingly very small.-Anything by Degas and works upon works of sculptures, exhibits, etc.Of course, though, these are just my suggestions. Check for many others online (and believe me, there are plenty!). Other than that, be aware that there is a gift shop, a restaurant, your usual fare, and that ultimately there is something for everyone.

Wear sneakers as well because it's a lot of walking. The admission is free and they just accept donations at any amount. The lines could get very long on the weekend but moves quickly.

5.0,1/22/2018,"The Metropolitan Museum of Art. This place is, first of all, MASSIVE. I walked in and felt tinier than I have ever felt in my life (taking into account my already short stature of 1.57m, or 5'2, whichever you're more familiar with).Honestly, this was one of the best and worst museum experiences I've ever had. Why? Well, i LOVE museums. But the Met was so big that I simply could not finish walking through and thoroughly reading everything in one day, which was a little frustrating. However, there was so much art to enjoy and so many things to be learnt from a visit to the Met. And, the building itself is fun to wander around. My friend and I spent 6 hours in the Met, and we only made it through the first floor, and didn't even check out the second floor! (I will need to return soon!!) Of course, you can probably finish looking through everything in much less time if you were just looking and not reading any captions.I think statues are amazing works of art, and found myself surrounded by more statues than I have ever seen in one place before. There were so many other things in the Met that I also enjoyed--the room of armour, the firearms, the Egyptian room, the European art, modern art...there's so much to see! (I'll add some photos that I have, but it's not a great representation of everything that's in there because my phone died and my friend hasn't yet sent me the pictures he took!)Tips for visiting the Met:1. Get a map--you just might need it.2. Figure out which exhibits you want to see more than others, since like me, you might run out of time if you aimlessly wander around.3. If you're planning on paying the full suggested admission price, you might as well buy from the machines. Less of a wait (and no human interaction).4. If you want to see everything, get there early!5. Watch out for your ticket. It's a little sticker that you'll stick to your coat, but may fall off! Keep an eye on it. It's less important if you're just staying around the Met, but a ticket into the Met also gets you into the Cloisters on the same day.

2.0,1/16/2018,"As an artist, I've been visiting the museum for decades at this point, but after the last visit trying to see the rare Michelangelo exhibit, I have to come back and knock off a few stars.Yes, it's one of the great museums in the world and an invaluable resource, but it's always been the case that whenever there is a popular exhibit it is complete chaos. Not only did they have a blockbuster Michelangelo exhibit, but in the very next gallery another big show of Rodin's work. What on earth were these curators thinking? Again, this is not an isolated problem but occurs nearly every time they have a big show, so if you read no further, if you see them advertising a popular artist, be aware!The museum is, at this point antiquated for today's crowds that show up for these events. The galleries are also difficult and confusing for newbies to find. Seems like for the big shows they really should have more immediate access to the galleries.In the Michelangelo exhibit, it was so crowded, I had people bumping into me from behind and pushing me into people if front of me. It was so crowded at times I couldn't even see the floor much less the artworks. The sketchbook I brought to study and copy the drawings was never opened.People started getting claustrophobic and very anxious and there was fair amount of frustration and venting - not only in these galleries, but even on the main floor where hundreds of lost souls were slowly wandering trying to figure out what they got themselves into.After battling crowds just to get to the galley, once in, I realized that there would be no viewing of any artwork and the wife and I made our way out of there before things got ugly. If the fire department had seen this nonsense, I'm sure they would have closed it down and fined them. After listening to the various pleas by the Met to pay the full suggested amount, (due to some shortfall of some sort I suppose), I agreed. I do support the arts and so I went online, paid in full for two tickets and an audio guide ($57), hoping to avoid some lines when I got to what I knew in advance was going to be a busy day at the museum.I had no clue just how insanely packed it would be and if I hadn't prepaid, I would have turned around and walked away, but decided to go in and hope for the best. I would have even asked for my money back, as there was no way anyone could have examined the work on display but by that point, we just wanted to get the hell out of there! I'll just adjust my suggested donation on the next visit.Here's a suggestion for the Met - forget the pay as you wish nonsense. Everyone should pay what it takes to keep the museum open. Then less people would try to scam the system. You know folks are bringing their groups of friends and families and paying peanuts for their visit. You can still have student and senior discounts as well as discounts for members - and btw, you need to make membership more attractive while you're at it - but how you are handling these crowds, which you are clearly not capable of handling, is absolutely shameful!

It can get amazingly crowded and security seems incredibly tolerant about people resting all of their jackets and purchases and possessions on the floor so that tourists from other countries can take a million photos in front of works of art and that Christmas tree. There really should be some decorum.  People really need manners and maybe the Met needs some rules one pic and that's it. Not laying all your stuff out on the floor.  I've seen blind folks there with their sticks. Looks like a hazard waiting to happen. On a more positive note the Met is huge! Sometime the rooftop has delightful things like the psycho house! Of all the times I've been I have yet to see the blue hippo in the Egyptian Wing.  But I've seen loads of other pieces there.

4.0,1/7/2018,"I've been to the MET a few times. I was looking forward to seeing the fashion exhibit that is mainly kept on the ground floor (Don't really remember) but was disappointed to discover that they only hold that exhibit during certain times in the year (spring). However, I still had a chance to explore lots and lots of art. The two famous paintings that really moved (and I didn't even know was kept in the MET) was the Death of Socrates and Washington Crosses the Delaware. I see those images everywhere, but there's something so powerful about seeing it in person.  The museum is really, really, really big so wear comfy shoes and avoid bringing backpacks (for some reason the security folks always demand you carry them on your side as opposed to your back) Another thing I want to add is to bring in a good camera that functions well with taking pics in settings that have low lighting (no I don't mean the flash function, since you can't use that). Besides the paintings, a lot of the sections in the museum had dim lighting so taking pics was a challenge with my phone.

5.0,1/7/2018,"I have been going to the Metropolitan Museum of Art faithfully for nearly five decades.  Today was the first time I took it upon myself to partake in a museum tour with a lovely human being whose knowledge of art and life in general made me realize how much I chose to overlook throughout these years.  On this uncharacteristically freezing Sunday, lovely Susan warmly showed us how to truly appreciate art in a manner that was always inclusive and not pedantic.  Further, she couldn't have been nicer to my mother who at times has mobility issues which miraculously disappeared in the presence of such an enlightened person who couldn't have been nicer.  This tour guide was ready to take the elevator with her if necessary and her kindness seemed to motivate my mother to summon her dormant strength and willpower in order to ensure Susan did not have to go out of her way.  My mother was actually pain free for the first time in four years and I was shocked that she stood for another hour (taking two 3 minute breaks) afterwards to witness the Michelangelo and David Hockney exhibitions.  Such is the power of art when introduced by riveting guardians and cultivators of the international craft that was the original placebo.  I submit that volunteers like her are the genuine backbone of this institution that has recently garnered controversy given its decision to charge a full price admission to non-residents starting March 1, 2018.  Time will tell if that decision is the correct one.  At this juncture, all I can say is that Susan inspired me to be a better person and also to research if I should be a buyer of Metropolitan Museum of Art bonds in the future.  Bravo Susan !",2,0,3,A A.,"Rego Park, NY",33,323,0

5.0,1/4/2018,"I can not believe I haven't written a review yet, the Metropolitan Museum of Art is one of my favorite places to visit whenever I have free time in the city. There are so much to say about this epicenter of art and a diverse culture bomb of multiple lands in one place. Before I talk and ramble on how great this place is there is some unfortunate information I need to inform the public. By March 1st, the Museum will be charging a mandatory fee for non New York adult visitors of $25, it will no longer be a ""suggested donation."" I can understand why this is happening, but it sucks. So, get to the museum before the entrance fee is enforced. The MET has to be one of the places you have to visit if you are in NYC for the first time and you can spend a day here, and still not be able to see everything in the museum. It also has different exhibits that change through the courses of the months. The best advice I can offer is to bring sneakers grab a map and enjoy or just get lost and hold onto the map so you relocate yourself if you have to use the restroom or to get out of the museum.  As you can see from all of the reviews for this place, there are a plehthora of artworks and sculptures that can be seen by the public, where all walks of life can enjoy. My personal favorites are the European Sculptures, the crazy Lilith sculpture (at the staircases, you will understand once you find it), and the paintings from the Impressionistic era: Monet, Seurat, and Signac.",10,2,7,Philip L.,"Marlboro Township, NJ",546,177,705
5.0,1/4/2018,"This is, in my opinion, the greatest museum in New York. There is truly a lifetime of masterpieces and unique historical information that are only found in textbooks (I minored in Art History, so I know!). The museum is beautiful just in and of itself, but go early and buy advanced tickets if you can. There is a bag inspection when you arrive (so prepare accordingly) and a coat check to the left. When you arrive, grab a map and form some sort of game plan. I recommend seeing the Egyptian gallery first, which is to your right when you walk in. The items here are stunning. I recommend heading to the sculpture garden next, where you'll see many memorable works from all over the world. Finally, I recommend the paintings on the second floor. Here there are Degas, Monet, Picasso, and Dali paintings, many you will recognize. If you visit before March 2018, there is a temporary exhibit of Michelangelo's work and it is heads and tails the absolute highlight of any art museum I've ever been to. It is a free temporary exhibit that has about 60-90 minutes of his work. It's a must see! On your way out, grab a souvenir from the gift shop.

You could easily spend several hours just traipsing about the place, taking in all the incredible sculptures and paintings. My only regret is that we only had 2 hours to spend here before closing.

Oh how wrong I was!! you truly need to spend all day here if you want to see everything. Although in all honesty, even if you spend the whole day at The Met, you will not be able to truly see it all. There is  so much to see and learn here I was blown away.  We were able to see the Egyptian exhibition, amazing!! The amount  of artifacts they have is mind blowing. I also saw the Roman/Greek exhibits, modern Art, European Renaissance, Medeival and Asian armor, and this is just on one side of the first floor!!!

You can't see everything here at once. We came years ago with our gas d daughter who loved seeing the mummy room and the Egyptian stuff.There are always special exhibits. They wanted this time to see the Rodin statues -- which were okay. We wanted to see the bamboo exhibit which was spectacular. Intricately woven items made from bamboo plus oriental including representations of the plants. Just the rooms and high ceiling are impressive alone. You could wander for days... The gift shop by the way is on 3 floors. If you're looking for bargains, go to the gift shop in the basement -- this is the sale area. Prices here are more reasonable. And you can rest for a coffee and a snack or in the evening for an adult beverage at the restaurant.

5.0,10/14/2017,"If you are planning on visiting New York City, you are bound to want to check out some museums.  My favorite three are MOMA, Guggenheim and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, or ""The Met."" If you can only pick one, I believe this is the granddaddy of them all.  It is located on the East side of Central Park and is simply huge.  When we arrived the was literally 100 yards long but went really quickly.  Once we got our tickets (and you can name your price) the exhibits did not feel crowded at all.  We started in the Roman section where there is an abundance of statues, reliefs, artifacts of all kind.  We then proceded to the Greek area and eventually the modern art exhibit.  It would be foolish of me to try to describe this musem.  It is truly epic; in scale and in the breadth of the collections.  It is the largest museum in the United States.  There are cafes and restaurants scattered about.  I love museum shops and this one is enormous!  The best I have ever visited.  If you are NYC, you must make time for this museum.  You could easily spend an entire day here.",1,1,1,Keith B.,"Bellingham, WA",23,116,17

And on the second time, without even knowing it, they have an exhibit on Rodin! I felt so fortunate that day. My intention primarily was to feast on the Post Impressionists because trite as it may sound, Van Gogh is most captivating.  Currently, the Japanese Bamboo Art is another point of interest. Flower baskets and sculptures of intricate designs; these Japanese artists have taken basketry to a different level of refinement.  I also enjoyed the Arms and Armors section.  An area of the museum where we have the most fun.

Their suggested donation is $25.This museum is amazing because of the diversity of art it has. There's a lot of European art, but there's also American art, Asian art, and modern art. If you like art, you'll find an exhibit here that's to your liking for sure. There are a lot of explanations about the history surrounding the time an art piece was made, and there are explanations for many of the art pieces themselves. It's a very well thought-out museum, and navigation is very easy. The map is quite detailed, and the rooms are for the most part clearly labeled so you know where you're going.There are also some open areas for people to sit and relax, and some exhibits have benches in the middle too.

I believe there are a few food places within the museum if you get hungry and also because there aren't really many food places around the area besides those darn hotdog food carts that seem to be everywhere in central park.

(According to Dr. Lear's Web Site).I saw many works of art that I probably would not have spent a lot of time exploring on my own..but Dr. Lear provided ""the backstory"" of each painting, sculpture, vessel, statue, and cultural artifacts that were explored.  I have to admit that my favorites included the Gertrude Stein painting in which she was painted by Pablo Picasso and it took about 90 sittings to complete!  I find her intriguing.I also was fascinated by the Female Pharaoh Hatshepsut of Egypt who ruled 1500 years before Cleopatra....in the Egyptian Wing. Hatshepsut's statue shows her dressed in female attire, ""[b]ut she wears the nemes headcloth, a royal attribute usually reserved for the reigning king."" (As listed in the MET's formal description of her statue sitting on the throne).The final stop was the John Singer Sargent portrait of a young woman Edith Minturn from the mid 1860s.  While the artist's choice was a request that Ms. Minturn dress in an evening gown during the sitting she showed up in a two piece outfit in which her skirt did not touch the floor-but her shoes were readily seen.  Her husband stands behind her and she smiles vibrantly as if she ""knows"" that she has clout, class, and authority as well as individuality. FYI-her husband stood in for Ms. Minturn's Great Dane when the dog became unavailable to sit for the portrait.The stories and featured art that is/was explored on this tour were exceptional and as diverse as the ""Nasty Women"" that were peppered throughout the MET.I would like to return to attend the ""Shady Lady Tour.""  Truly impressive tour, well paced (2 hours) with an entertaining and educational experience provided by Dr. Lear.See:  shadyladiestours.com",7,0,5,Christina S.,"Chicago, IL",124,491,4225

The paintings from the Renaissance period are awe-inspiring. The artists hundreds of years ago put many of today's so-called artists to shame. San Francisco's MOMA is a good example of modern trash trying to pass off as art, but I digress. I don't usually like going to museums but I thoroughly enjoyed The Met. Here are a few tips:1.) Wear comfortable shoes and clothing since you'll be walking around for several hours. 2.) The displayed price at the Met is only a suggestion. You can pay as much or as little as you want since it's considered a donation. 3.) The food court is at the lower level.

I had some spare time so I went, but because I wanted to go not because I was told to go. I am my own person and I can make my own decisions. I don't need some hipster to tell me about this ""cool underground Museum"" that I never heard of before. When I arrived I tried not to let the fact that it is on the pretentious over rated Central Park to bother me..... it did. (See Review of Central Park) The overall atheistic of the building from the outside walking-in is underwhelming, its like they put zero thought into designing this place. Fighting my way through several street vendors and millions of lost tourists asking for directions I grabbed a map and got started looking at the art.The art selection at the MET is mediocre at best, I had barley heard of any of these artists (I.e El Greco, Botticelli, and Vincent Van Gogh to name a few) I have no idea who these guys are but if they are still creating their so called ""art"" it is a disservice to the art community. There was some buzz about two artist that I hadn't heard of before, Claude Monet and Édouard Manet. When I asked a worker where Monet's paintings were he pointed at one of Manet's paintings like I was some kind of jackass that couldn't read... I said MOnet not MAnet, Jackass. Anyways when I found Monet's painting (on my own) I was horrified.... They were all blurry! It seems like the MET had not properly taken care of the art work and thought no one would notice, but it is all I noticed being the art enthusiast I am. I even got up real close and it just got even more blurry. Every painting that I looked was the same, blurry and it seemed as if someone had ruined this mans art work. (Just a note I have 25/20 vision, which is amazing. Doctors constantly tell me how great of vision I have and how it is better than everyone else's vision. Its an anomaly really. A reporter once asked if they could write an article about my vision in the local newspaper but I turned it down because I didn't want people to look at me as some kind of superhero for it.) I decided to look at some sculptures to take my mind off the lack of care they took with Monet's paintings. This made it even worse... almost every statue was broken. How little does this Museum care about their art? It seems like they hired some guys off the street with a Uhaul gave them a Sixer and a Pack of smokes, threw the statues in the back and told them to go nuts. They got the statues to the museum, broken...then put them on display with no thought or care at all. I just can't support a museum that takes such little care of the art. It is no surprise that such a disappointing, trashy, careless museum is located on the unkept waste of space central park. I would highly advise anyone to avoid this area of the city, especially at night I have heard that the upper east side is a very dangerous neighborhood (I noticed a lot of loitering, which is never a good sign). If you are a fan of mediocre damaged art and rough neighborhoods then the MET is for you, if you care about your safety and quality art I would not go to the MET.",4,13,1,Eli J.,"Troy, MI",305,9,0

5.0,8/6/2017,"This is such an overwhelmingly immense museum brimming with a ton of beautiful history. With so many interests, it was hard to choose the parts of the museum to spend more time in. Admission is by donation, so you don't have to pay the suggested amount if you don't want to, offer whatever you think is fair.I love Egyptian history, so we spent a good amount of time there. The European Sculpture and Decorative Arts was full of decadent 15-18th century room reenactments that we absolutely adored looking at and photographing. The ambient lighting was so perfectly executed that it eerily looks like someone's actual home inside a museum. The larger-than-life Greek, Roman and European sculptures were definitely something I enjoyed, they are so much more impressive in person than seeing them in a picture. The Arms and Armor exhibit was so interesting to see, the intricate weapons and armor was fascinating and extremely impressive.You can get lost in the huge collection of furniture in the American Wing. The European Paintings exhibit is like an endless maze of countless paintings. By the end of our half-day adventure, my eyes were starting to cross. This is definitely something I would explore more and take the time to read the history behind every piece, but that would probably take you weeks. This is such an impressive place. I absolutely recommend coming even if you aren't an art fan, this is the history of the world.",2,0,3,Julie T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",308,636,1257

5.0,8/1/2017,"My sister has brought me here a couple times and I'll have to say, while I'm not an expert on art, the Met is a great spot to pretend that you are an expert, whether it's from attempting some cool Instagram post or taking in a different view from the usual social media screentime. We came during the Irving exhibit (which, when I last checked, is still going on now). Very insta-worthy for sure, with some cool photos. Too bad I can't tell you more about his inspirations and concepts... but there are plenty of descriptions and explanations for each piece in the exhibit. We ventured to the rooftop and found it to be like a rooftop garden party. Sculptures were scattered around the roof and we also found quite the view of the city. It was hot AF but cold alcoholic beverages were being sold at the bar. The Met is definitely a cool spot to spend a couple hours, or all day, depending on your affinity to art.

My friends went to the North booth and were still on line even after I was 15 minutes late. Go to the west! There are student discounted prices on the board, but the fees here are ""pay as you wish"", unless you want an audio tour, then you pay the amount on the board. There is a bag check before you enter and the tourists here aren't very kind...It is so easy to get lost here and go in circles. Grab a map! There's a clear glass elevator in the building. It's nice to go on. Feels like a roller coaster! We spend nearly 4 hours here. I most enjoyed the Roman and Egyptian art pieces. There are really detailed jewelry pieces carved out of bones and super detailed plates in one of the rooms. Who would ever eat on them? They're gorgeous! The giant caskets in the Egyptian section are very impressive. How did they ever most such large slabs of stone without modern technology?

5.0,6/30/2017,"The Met is located inside what could be considered the grounds of Central Park itself between 80th and 84th streets on the west side of 5th avenue pretty much right in what could be considered the geographical center of the island of Manhattan.  The main entrance for the museum are up the steps facing 5th avenue at 82nd street.I was trying to research what the admission was for the Met and discovered that it's a donation based system.  That means you pay what you want to.  There are suggestions however and for adults it's 25 dollars while it's less for seniors, children and students.  I had decided to purchase tickets online however and those prices are set for adults at 25 dollars.  I did so because I didn't want to line up when we arrived since I would have probably donated the suggested admission anyway.  There is a bag check at the entry to the museum and because I had purchased tickets in advance we proceeded to the Group and Advanced Tickets desk just to the left at the Great Hall.What can be said about the Met that hasn't already been pointed out?  It's unequivocally a world class museum in every respect.  It's absolutely vast considering to scale it's about the equivalent footprint of about 4 city blocks.  Where does one begin and what is the most efficient method to traverse this place and see as much as you can?  While I'm a real stickler for logistics, routes and planning I look at the map and of this place knowing how much time we have and the sheer area of the museum and concede that ya, we're not going to get to see the whole thing this time around.  Even if I ran in some sort of planned out pattern to get to every gallery, wing, exhibit without even obversing a single work there'd still be no way to see everything.  I had to accept that and move on.  That being said there would be no order and we'd just wing it.  Advice from a fellow Yelper was to just take in what you can and come back another day.  That's sound advice.  There's still so much to see and observe that it's overwhelming as the city it's in as well.  Each piece has its own story and here there are millions, that's right millions plural.  I read the permanent collection has 2 million works.  Astounding numbers.  I mean if you love this kind of stuff this is the place for you.  The number of visitors last year is reported at 7 million.  There are over 8 million in all 5 boroughs.  That's almost the equivalent of the entire city visiting this one place in a year.  Those numbers are well deserved too and it's no accident that more and more people want to see what this museum has to offer.There are simply too many things to mention but when we went there were temporary exhibits such as Ages of Empires, Irving Penn's photography and  some other fashion exhibit.If I had only one gripe about the place it's the price of the places to eat inside.  I only wanted a drink so we went to the American wing café and it was 10.50 for a bottled beer and 5 dollars for a bottled water.  This cafe was marked as the most affordable place to eat in the entire museum ($) as per their map.  That being said my advice is eat and drink before you go because odds are if you are going to walk around throughout this place it will take a lot out of you and the choices for restaurants inside are rather limited for space.",9,3,5,Lambert P.,"Toronto, Canada",453,1303,5885

Some of the items on display were ones I studied in my Chinese art classes, which was exciting.After this, I then spent the day wandering from gallery to gallery.  Of course it's impossible to see everything in one day but I went at my own pace and took in countless examples of what is in my opinion one of the finest collections of (primarily) Western art.Yes, one feels manipulated into paying for admission even though it's supposed to be based on what you want to pay, but so what?  The money goes towards upkeep and peoples' salaries so I am happy to pay $25 and was pleased to see the people next to me in line pay even more.",0,0,0,Tree S.,"New Richmond, OH",0,6,0

5.0,6/19/2017,This museum rocks.  I have been here several times and have never been disappointed.  It is a huge place and covers a plethora of different art forms from pretty much every period of history.  My favorite is the Temple of Dendur.  The place is always crowed for good reason. I sill feel that I have not seen everything and I've been there 5+ times.  The layout is like a maze and I usually get lost and have to ask the guard where to go.  The guards are usually helpful . This is probably one of the finest museums in the United States.,0,0,0,Rob H.,"Centralia, WA",4,219,30

5.0,6/17/2017,"What can I say? It's truest a world class museum in every sense. Each and every room has only the best of the best displayed. As with all museums of this caliber you have to pace yourself to see only a fraction before you tire. I've been to the Lovre and Vatican and wish I'd had 3 days at each. I feel the same about this oneThe master pieces of Picasso, Chagall, Matisse, Van Gough and others is worth the trip alone. Add in things like Tribal , Italian etc and it gets overwhelming at the extent of it all. Don't hesitate to at a minimum breast through for an hour plus, don't let the large crowds scare you.

5.0,6/15/2017,"The Metropolitan Museum of Art (aka The Met) was seriously HUGE! Admissions is donation based so pay whatever amt you like. This is what they have on their Website: ""Suggested admission is $25 for adults; $17 for seniors; $12 for students; and free for Members, Patrons, and children under 12.""My suggestion is to pick a few areas and hit up those spots bc touring the whole museum can take all day if you're looking at each piece of art. They have many rooms and areas: Egyptian, Asian, Greek, Medieval, modern arts, etc. They also have a roof top bar with additional pieces of art. The elevators to get up there are near the modern arts area. I think people were up there more for the view of the city than anything else. The view was spectacular to behold. They have two gift shops: the smaller one as you enter and another huge one on the opposing side.  And if you walk along 5th Ave, there are food and art vendors that you can browse.",7,2,5,Andrea M.,"Lawrenceville, GA",624,1229,4369
4.0,6/14/2017,"If I have to choose between the Art Institute of Chicago vs the Metropolitan Museum of Art (the Met), then I will definitely choose the Art Institute of Chicago. Why? Sure the Met certainly has a very impressive collection, but the Met was somewhat difficult to navigate and numerous exhibits (e.g. Van Gogh) were temporary closed off. In addition, certain parts of museum had no cell reception.[Admission]Entrance fee is donation based and you can pay however you wish. The Met recommends $25 for adults, $17 for seniors, and $12 for students. You can rent the audio guide player for $7 per piece ($5 for everyone after 5 PM on Friday and Saturday). Since I only planned to stay for few hours, I decided to only pay half of suggested fee.[Directory]First Floor: Greek and Roman Art, Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas, Modern and Contemporary Art, Great Hall (entrance)Mezzanine: Greek and Roman Art, Special Exhibition Gallery, Study Collection, Etruscan ArtSecond Floor: Ancient Near Eastern Art, Art of the Arab Lands, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia, and Later South Asia, Cypriot Art, 19th and Early 20th Century European Paintings and Sculpture, Modern and Contemporary Art.[Guided Tours]I did the one-hour free Museum Highlights guided tour and our tour guide (museum volunteer) showed us 9 ~ 10 various pieces of art (e.g. medieval armor, Thomas Cole, George Washington's Crossing of the Delaware River, Charles Le Brun, Guercino, Between Earth and Heaven, and wall paintings from 50 ~ 40 B.C.). You can also do the EmptyMet Tour (a special 1.5-hour VIP tour before the Met opens to the general public) for $175 or $199 (depending on seasons).[Other Information]Free Wi-Fi and there's a quick security backpack check upon entering the museum.[Final Thoughts]It is a wonderful museum with both exotic and unique collections, but please do expect a huge crowd and join guided tours if you have time.",1,1,1,Luke L.,"San Gabriel, CA",25,1513,10144
5.0,6/14/2017,"There's an explosion of imagination here, unfettered by any convention. That would be my one line review of the Rei Kawakubo, Comme Des Garcons show currently at the Met. It's highly unlikely you'll wear her clothes, and even more unlikely that you can even afford her clothes. What is likely is that you'll be vastly entertained, and engrossed by the fantastical couture creations of Rei Kawakubo, the latest exhibit of the Met's costume institute. Kawakubo, a genius at sculpting, folding, and draping textiles, has created in her lifetime some of the most interesting clothing anywhere. Her clothing is art that sometimes borders on the grotesque, as if they belong in some nightmarish dream. Other pieces are just stunning displays of the I am sure unplumbed depths of this designer's imagination, dresses that are more 3D sculptures in the most unusual shapes and forms. I couldn't figure out how people could actually move in them, and yet, proving me wrong, was a video featuring a model prancing around in one of her red pieces! Shrinking violets should snag one of her outfits. You'll certainly be the talk of the party and conversation will be around you for certain! Esthetically, I prefer the sexy, exotic outfits of Alexander McQueen(which was one of my favorite exhibits here). Yet, this show is just as visually captivating, with its many odd, eccentric and totally peculiar creations. Rei Kawakubo is a genius and this show is a must for anyone who appreciates unique art, even as expressed by clothing.",10,3,7,Helen Y.,"New York, NY",331,838,3671

3.0,6/9/2017,"Beautiful museum with a diverse amount of art. Gorgeous artifacts and well displayed pieces. The major drawback: all of the staff. Not knowledgeable nor helpful. It's reasonable to expect the staff at the Met would know something about the art there, especially at the information desk. My experience was not nearly meeting expectation. I asked repeatedly what the information staff thought was best to see at the gallery and having walked through it I can see their training is well below par. With pieces like Washington Crossing the Delaware,  a Sunday on La Grande Jatte by Seurat, several major van Gogh pieces and gorgeous Degas (and that's only the smallest sample of famous artists and prices) the staff could have offered something up however they chose to act like snobs and deflect the question several times.

My absolute favorite has to be the sculptures, paintings, and panels from the Italian Renaissance. The Hellenistic jewelry on display on the main floor always has me in awe. The brilliance of the gold, paired with luminescent emeralds and amethysts often keep me in a trance.

4.0,6/3/2017,"Hint: Though their website doesn't specifically state it, panoramic shots are not allowed. Not sure about the reasoning behind this but best to avoid even anything that looks like you are taking a panoramic shot. I took a few photos in a row while walking down the length of a display and was yelled at. She defined still photography as hitting the shutter button separate times. Maybe I didn't stop long enough to look like I hit the shutter multiple times but I tried showing the guard that it is distinctly 3 different shots that I cannot (and was never planning to) merge together and was reprimanded for arguing and she said she absolutely knew I took a panoramic without looking at my phone. Other person that was yelled at before me had 1 picture on the phone that can only be achieved with the panoramic setting. I wasn't even expecting an apology, just to inform her there is a difference.Also, I wish they had directional arrows on certain exhibits. The fashion exhibit had closed off displays that you can only view from one side and they were never facing the same way. So as I was wandering around, I peaked around a corner and was told that I should enter from the other side. Not that bad really but after the previous experience, it just rubbed me the wrong way from something that could have been avoided with clearer instructions. Otherwise, their collection is extensive and you will need multiple visits to see the whole thing. And you will most likely find at least one thing to your liking. Some prefer the medieval section with the armoury. Some prefer the art. Worth at least 1 visit, especially if there is a special exhibition from another country that you could never visit. But maybe it is best expect it to be like flying. Pack light, try to avoid asking questions, and practice your moo.

5.0,5/26/2017,"This a great Museum. I was wondering if I should give it 5 stars if I were to compare it to the Louvre or Musee d'Orsay in Paris, which I was lucky enough to visit during university. Then again why be a snob! Its a great museum, been there twice the last two trips we've made to New York and there are still things to see.         I'll mainly comment on the current exhibit ""Age of Empires"" currently displayed as many people have commented on the Museum itself. This was an exhibit we are glad we caught because many of these artifacts have never come out of China before. Its the Art of the Qin and Han Dynasties. The Qin (Terracotta Army) is considered the first unified Chinese Empire in China, while short lived the Han Dynasty picked up the pieces and was essentially a Golden age in Chinese History. The next and equally significant was the Tang Dynasty almost 1000 years later. Qin and Han Dynasties basically set the stage for many aspects of later history.       The bronze work in this exhibit is well worth it. Most of these are from Tombs and meant to re-create in miniature worldly luxuries for the deceased in the afterlife. The detail and the quality of the bronze work is amazing especially given that casting techniques at the time and considering these objects can be 2000 years old. If you appreciate Chinese history, its worth the visit.     Couple of things I appreciate about the MET, its a great building architecturally. I also like the donation entry fee. I makes high art accessible. They have a great permanent collection from all over the world. Sometimes entire rooms or small buildings have been re-created inside the museum, its impressive. I'm also glad there is a place for traditional art, most of the collection I've seen I'd call traditional.  There are more then enough modern art museums in New York. The amour and arms section is fascinating if paintings and sculpture are not interesting to you.    I recommend not to bring a bag. Keep in mind everything is searched on the way in. No drinks allowed obviously. Purses are not a problem but backpacks need to be worn on your front. You will be told if caught otherwise. Its just more enjoyable to be free of baggage. There is a coat check service, not sure if they take bags.       If you are visiting the City, give yourself at least half a day to drop in and take a look. Something to interest everyone.",0,0,0,Jay B.,"Toronto, Canada",9,73,356

I would also recommend taking a free tour, arriving early on weekends or rainy days, and choosing 2 or 3 exhibits that you want to see, and make peace with the fact that it's impossible to see everything in one visit!

I hope this shows how incredible this place really is.I love coming here because I think it is the quintessential NYC experience, but with its enormous, beautiful building, extensive collections from around the world, you are also taken to an oasis.

4.0,5/20/2017,"As I casually choose ""4"" above this sentence for a star rating, I gulp. Will the sin of giving the Met, the grand daddy of museums, a star deduction and a less than perfect rating, so anger the art gods that the earth below me will open up and consume me?Sigh, no, luckily I still appear to be seated on solid ground. A partial explanation for my rating: I've visited the Met twice. To give further background, I've visited the Chicago Art Institute many times and that's what it most recalled to me - but bigger.  For reference in new york, I've also visited the Whitney and the Cloisters (the medieval branch of the met up in Washington Heights.)   Yes, they are a lot smaller so technically you get more ""bang for your art buck"" at the Met  (more on pricing in a minute,) but personally, I loved the Cloisters and the Whitney more for both the intimacy of smaller and more focused collections, and the fact that the buildings themselves in both cases, are more part of the actual experience. What were we discussing again? Oh, that's right - the Met. First things first. The  $25 admission price for a regular adult is merely a ""suggested donation""  Feel free to pay that if you wish, but if $10 is all you can afford  (or whatever) that's completely kosher. Where to begin. It's massive I've visited twice and still doubt I saw half of the stuff there.The first visit there we concentrated in European stuff, of which there's a lot.  Even though the met runs the separate Cloisters museum which focuses on medieval art, the medieval collection at the main museum is still impressive. On the other hand, while there's a good representation of late 19th century art and impressionism here, the actual modern art and 20th century collection is pretty meager. I'd head to Moma or the Whitney for that kind of thing. Second time we headed for the American wing which I actually liked best. However,  a lot of the rooms were inexplicably roped off.  There's also a replica of a 18th (19th,) century house you can tour. Kinda cool.  That massive oil of George Washington crossing the delaware is also awe inspiring.   They usually have cool special exhibits (right now they have a circus themed Seurat exhibit that's fun and festive.)  There's also an Egyptian tomb thing that has kids lining up like it's a six flags ride. I'd also note that the cafeteria is super convenient - they have all sorts of food, a lot of it healthy, which is helpful since it doesn't seem like there's a lot of restaurants nearby. However, its also super overpriced so you may want to try your luck with one of the food carts set up in front of the building. More on why I'm giving this place 4 stars: I don't know if its the air quality  (may be they have to keep the barometric pressure just so for the paintings integrity), the masss of people  (suuuper busy on a not so nice outside Saturday), or all the stone, but something about being in this place for too long makes me feel unwell and like ""Hey, I think we've already seen this room.  And can we go? Soon?""  It gives me that museum syndrome something horrible and no amount of tapestries or oils of the founding fathers can make me want to stay past a couple hours there.  But if you've never been-you should go.  I'm still a fan!",3,1,3,Lisa A.,"Milwaukee, WI",260,667,1280

5.0,5/5/2017,"This is one of the greatest museums in the entire world. It is a massive monument to art, to history, to the beautiful things that humans have created over the centuries. Even if you don't like whatever it is that comes to mind when you think of art museums, go to The Met, walk around, and realize that you were mistaken. This place isn't just paintings, and sculptures, and old pottery. If you are at all into design, architecture, furniture, fashion, history, beauty of any kind, there are things here for you to love. The thought and care that has gone into each exhibit, and the museum as a whole, is just astonishing. It isn't easy to offer specifics in a museum that contains so much worth your time, but here are a few things you should do:Go to the Charles Englehard Court, in The American Wing.  The lofted ceiling, the giant stained glass in the corner, the well-chosen, gorgeous sculptures that are all centered around the Augustus Saint-Gaudens Diana...this is my favorite room in the museum.Wander through the Greek wing, where you might notice that nearly all the male sculptures lack penises. I'm sure it's because their small,* protruding shape wasn't conducive to lasting over the centuries, but I prefer to think that there was a vengeful feminist that once ran through and smashed all of them off the marble bodies. Get Tea Drunk on the balcony, overlooking the Great Hall. Realize you really like good tea. Take in the sheer, breathtaking majesty of the building, itself a work of art. Wander around The Asian Wing and marvel at the insane, staggering intricacies of the screens, scrolls, and other ancient art. Absolutely do not miss the Egyptian section; the reconstructed Temple of Dendur (and the Sphinx next to it) is spectacular, and while a walkthrough isn't as impressive as a trip to Cairo, it's the next best thing. Get lost until you end up in the Visible Storage area, where you will be shocked by the sheer amount of art that ISN'T displayed in the actual exhibits. Do the crowds bother you?

Plan as much time here as possible because of the vastness of the museum. A must-see for any tourist or native!! Shoutout to Jose Rivero- This time I visited stands out bc of my 12 yr old daughter and an employee. My daughter lost a pair of sunglasses - yes, they were a free pair of cheap glasses she got a camp last summer. However, it took a lot of courage for a female child to walk up to a grown man and ask for help without being intimidated or self conscious. And the man, Jose Rivero, was completely and ultimately understanding, gave his undivided attention and, most importantly, respect, to my 12 year old and her lost-eyewear- dilemma. He took her name and number, looked her directly in the eye, and assured her sincerely that he would help in any way he could. That meant so much -to see her as a person and not some silly little child. And for that he should be applauded bc, unfortunately, this is the exception and should be more of a rule. Thank you, Jose, because my child will look back on this situation and think, 'My concerns and issues are valid.' The sunglasses will stand out in her mind as a situation in which she stepped out of her comfort zone, was taken seriously by someone of authority, validated in her concern, and succeeded in what she set out to do.

Just give a donation of whatever you can afford for admission.  Be sure to get a map, so you can navigate the many exhibits. If you are interested in Fashion, be sure to visit the Costume Institute.  The theme changes every year.  They have a big MET Gala in May, where they will Announce the theme of the Costume Institute for the year.  Sorry, the MET Gala is by invite only.

5.0,4/28/2017,"If I were a local, I'm sure I'd visit the Met often. It's enormous and even spending half a day here, I felt we barely got to half of what I wanted to see! Definitely grab a map to plan out your trip if you're only able to make it in for a few hours. Even if you're not a huge art fan, there are so many different styles and exhibits that you are sure to find something that piques your interest, whether it's jewelry, ancient artifacts, musical instruments, fashion, or furniture. Definitely a place to come on every visit to NYC, there's no way to ever see it all. The hall of statues is one of my favorite areas! TIPS:+ For best experience (ie less crowds), come at opening. The line will look insane but it moves quickly.+ Bags are checked at door, you can bring in water but not food.+ Admission is donation-based. They suggest ~$25/adult. + Docent tours available and awesome, plan ahead. $7 audio tour also available. + Dining options inside, including a full service cafeteria, a couple of cafes, and even a wine bar area for members only.",19,14,21,Stefany V.,"Las Vegas, NV",2691,4459,13918

5.0,4/20/2017,My favorite art museum is the New York MET.Love this place for its architectural grandeur and art selection. Its very large and may take 2 days to really enjoy the beauty of art in this museum. I make it a priority to go to the Met everytime I'm in New York. Very inspirational and at times moving to know all the history behind the art and artists. The gift shop is also fun and has some extraordinary souvenirs.  Well worth it!!!,21,9,13,Tom H.,"Arcata, CA",1555,107,211
5.0,4/19/2017,"It is probably difficult to really say what others haven't said about this museum, but I'll give it a go anyway. I've grown up going to cool museums my whole life -- that's what I did for birthdays for the most part instead of having parties, because I didn't really have a ton of friends while growing up. So, I know a good museum when I see one, and I've been here twice so far.It's world class. This is a museum that you really can't see in one day, unless you start the moment it opens, and spend a minimal amount of time looking at each piece. I have spent almost an entire day alone just going through the Egypt section, and still don't feel that I got a thorough enough look at it.There's so much to see here, and the art is everywhere. There are mezzanine levels filled with arts and crafts era pottery, and pieces of stained glass from Frank Lloyd Wright. There is the enormous painting of Washington crossing the Delaware in the American wing. There's an entire temple relocated from Egypt. There are paintings from pretty much every prominent European master somewhere in the European wing. And so, so much more. This is definitely a must visit if you are in the city and care about art or culture.My only quibbles are the highway robbery prices for food and drink in the museum. You're much better off going outside and getting a hot dog from the many stands out front, and paying $1 for a bottle of water outside, rather than almost $5 inside.My only other complaint is that the gift shop, while large and extensive, really didn't have anything that appealed to me to take as a tourist memento. We came pretty close to getting some nice looking coasters, but when I saw them out of the package, I realised they were pretty cheap and flimsy, and not really worth the $17 price tag. They may want to take a tip from the merch shops at The Smithsonian museums in DC, there's a much better price range at those museums.",3,1,4,Katherine P.,"Stamford, CT",165,1195,1156

You can spend days here and not see everything. It's a very relaxing site to spend a afternoon and be wow'd by the great artists of our world over the centuries. Some of my favorites are the Egyptian and Greek areas along with many of the wonderful paintings. This time around i visited during their Asian exhibit that also hosted for the season the ""Tea Drunk"" bar on the balcony level. The asian exhibit houses many great pieces of art and replicates a great chinese garden where you feel you are in china in someones house. The tea drunk bar on the balcony level provides many types of teas where you can order them to refresh oneself and even tea tastings. They also steep their tea traditionally.

There are so many artifacts, in every collection, with many icons of the art world.

Hop a floor up, and you're exploring Asian artwork from different dynasties and countries. Cross the Great Hall, and you've got all of the great works of art from Picasso and Van Gogh.

5.0,3/22/2017,"First, a little bit of very relevant trivia: The largest museums in the world (by Sq. ft): 1. Louvre, France2. State Hermitage Museum, Russia3. National Museum of China4. The Met (This one!)Yes, this is the fourth largest museum in the world. Do not be disparaged by the fact that it is only the fourth, I have been to the Louvre, and I have been here... there is more than enough to take up a whole day in both!Next, some advice: with museums this large, even if you are willing to dedicate a full day to the museum, know what you want to see. Go online, and see what exhibits this museum has, and decide which you want to see more than others. When you get to the museum, grab a map, a pen, and visit those exhibits, room by room, marking off the rooms you already checked out. This will prevent you from walking in endless circles through the same rooms,This said, the museum has a vast number of different exhibits to suit a vast number of different tastes and preferences. However, I think you will find that the art in this museum is much more geared towards older versus modern or contemporary art. Still, there is sure to be something for everyone.Aside from the rooms where they have visible storage, the density of displayed works in the museum is quite good! Space is utilized efficiently, without causing that pesky crowding. Be sure also to visit The Temple of Dendur in The Sackler Wing. Not only is this awesome in itself, but this is the room where they have a whole wall (and a tall one at that) which is all window panes! I also seem to recall small pools (no bathing, of course). Just a nice feature you don't often see is museums.The best thing though, is that the price to get in is more a suggested donation rather than something you must pay to get in. While you are able to get in without paying, you still have to get a ticket. This in mind, if you are truly unable to pay the full admission price, or any admission price that's fine, but if you are able to pay, do; then again, who am I to tell you how to live your life. Museum is clean, and superbly maintained! Photography is allowed (I think) unless otherwise noted. Also, while there was definitely a good number of people here, I did not find it overly crowded, nor did I find armies of people, or large groups of rambunctious students of field tripsThere is a free coat check! Museum staff are respectful, but have no nonsense attitudes. Be respectful, and of course, no touching!I will say that I wish the restroom situation was a touch better for a museum of this size, but I didn't find lines outside the door, nor crowds inside.

It's so nice that the large museums do this for the general public, because maintaining hundred-year-old art is so difficult and time consuming. Being in the sciences, I always appreciate a chance to go and learn about something not in my field, and the Met definitely satisfies those cravings and more for me. I love the Egyptian art permanent display, and especially any of the room displays of extravagant 1800's Victorian era gold-leafed bedrooms, ballrooms, and more. I'm not for modern art since it's a little too over my head for me (sorry, MoMA) so the Met is perfect for this unknowledgeable art appreciator to come and get her fill of the arts on a rainy NYC afternoon.

Honestly, for what you see, the suggest price is actually a terrific value but I was running low on cash at that point.I did a blitz tour of FOUR HOURS and I was only able to see 60% of the museum and I wasn't able to really enjoy the pieces I wanted to, simply because I had NO time! I also made an unfortunate decision regarding my footwear so I was handicapped there. I would walk past, ""ooh, ahh!"", *snap picture*, and move on.

One of my favorites is a textile by El Anatsui (pictured here). Being and art history major, I have a particular appreciation for the way that the exhibit is curated.  Though m done in the white-space style and without truly proper context for the very practical aspects of the art (as is common among African Art collections around the country and truly inescapable). The curator still somehow manages to capture the sheer power and magnanimity of these figures. The arrangement of the figures as well as the silence of the space allows the viewer to observe the more divine nature of each piece despite the vast and broad nature of the collection. I truly enjoyed my visit. My favorite aspect of the museum is that it's open to all, accepting suggested donations in lieu of the full admissions price.

Also try to keep a distance with the artwork (I got scolded by the guard since standing too close to a painting)Beautiful architecture across different areas of the museum and many many many art collections.. almost impossible to finish in just 1 trip especially if you are pressed on time.This place certainly has made me appreciate art work better than beforeWill return again someday.",2,2,3,Richard J.,"Seattle, WA",197,219,221
5.0,2/25/2017,"What an incredible experience and in four hours we easily only saw a third of this breathtaking museum. I loved that you can pay what you wish to enter, making art accessible to everyone. Staff was ample, respectful, and friendly - always willing to direct you through the maze of galleries or provide recommendations. The galleries themselves were set up to build experience upon experience. I was awed by the collections housed here, walking from Monet to Van Gogh to Degas to Manet, Cezanne and Klimt, Picasso and Pollack. I will never forget this visit - my first - and will gladly return with other art enthusiasts and young people in tow.A few tips - walk through Central Park which surrounds the museum before or after, a perfect complimentary experience. Grab a hotdog from a street vendor and eat lunch on the steps of the museum, the people watching is incredible. And don't leave without visiting the Egyptian temple and Sphinx - I wouldn't have known about this room without coming here with someone familiar with the museum and it was incredible.",2,1,1,Jess A.,"Louisville, KY",325,227,2415

This apparently is the place to go, but to be honest, I'm not a huge art fan, so coming here was kind like why did you lock me up in a place sort of feel. This place is donation based, so whatever you like to give, although it can't be free. Ha my bf and I were trying to go in for free, but they're like ITS not free. So we ended up giving a bit... Anyways this place just seems too scattered, it's huge, but nothing that really is like WOAH. It's different from the modern art museum, opposite to be exact.

5.0,2/15/2017,"There is really something for everyone at the Met.  I love going there, both to see regular collections as well as special exhibits.  Recently I saw the fashion exhibit the last day it was available and it was swamped.  However, really enjoyed seeing the creative works that included dresses you could wear or some sculptural dresses that were interesting but basically unwearable or at least would be uncomfortable.  I like that the Met is doing these fashion exhibits.  The area used is through the Egyptian exhibit (which is wonderful) and downstairs.  I went back a few days later to see the Beckman in New York exhibit with works of Max Beckman largely from his time in NY.  There was a nice variety of his work.  One thing I appreciate about the Met exhibits is the information they provide in sections as well as on individual pieces.  After the exhibit we went through some other areas including ""luxury items from the 1700's"" which included items in cases as well as some rooms decorated and furnished as they would have been in those days.  The museum is on 14 acres so you could take days or weeks to really see and enjoy everything.  They change special exhibits every few months so there is always something you may not have seen.  They offer a number of tours through the days-some with a special focus, some just of the museum in general.  They have activities for kids such as toddler reading time and more, lectures, and special showings.  Admission is free with a suggested donation.  They have a very nice website where you can see a map of the museum, see what special events there are each day, find out about current and upcoming exhibits and more (metmuseum.org).  There are several restaurants and gift stores as well.  They usually have a gift book section at special exhibits if you want a book about that exhibit and the other gift shops have a wide variety of things including books, clothing, toys, jewelry and other gifts (you can also order online).  The building is quite beautiful and you can enter up the steps in front of if you have difficulty with steps, there is a ground level entrance to the left of the main steps.  There is a coat check at each entrance but the ground level entrance seems to be much less crowded and you can quickly get an entrance ticket.  One of the things I highly recommend is that you take a map of the museum for your visit as it is easy to get lost.  There are guides throughout the museum you can ask but sometimes hard to find them.  Also, rest rooms can be hard to find.  It's a great place to visit more than once and you can expect to see something new each time.",1,1,1,Betsy B.,"Tucson, AZ",50,529,920

You will see amazing works from collections from all over.  Or, take one of the many overview or specialized tours. These run every hour or so.  Information about special exhibits and tours is available at the large round  desk just inside the Met's main entrance.While the suggested admission price may seem high, keep in mind that it covers all that I've mentioned here - special exhibits and tours - and it also allows same day admission to the Met Breuer - a branch of the Met showing special exhibits of contemporary art a few blocks away - and the Cloisters - a collection of medieval Europe art in a spectacular setting at the northern tip of Manhattan.  Also, the admission price is ""suggested.""  So, if you are on a tight budget, pay less.  It will be accepted.",1,0,0,William B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,0

4.0,1/6/2017,"What is there to say about the Met that hasn't already been said? It houses some of the greatest art pieces in the world. You could spent a full week and still not see everything. The best part: the entrance fee is based on contribution: you pay what you feel is adequate based on what you plan to see. I'm a broke student, so free is great, but I still gave $2 because it only seemed right. I had my eye on all of the Winslow Homer pieces, as the Met was one of the few major US museums I had not yet seen his work in. What I didn't like was that his work was spread out all throughout the museum. I had to go to different wings on different floors to see all of his pieces. Most museums will clump all of an artists' pieces together, which makes it easier to see their whole collection at once. I found the Met's way of doing this to be rather odd. Another frustrating point: while searching for Winslow Homer, I passed by the Met's randomly-placed poster station where you can get replica posters of same of the famous works. They had a Homer poster on the wall, so I asked the woman who ran the station where in the museum I could see the real thing. She didn't know, nor did she have any way of looking up where it would be. Instead I was directed out into the main entrance area where they did have a computer system to find its location. In my opinion, it only makes sense that if you're trying to sell me a poster, at least know where in the museum I can see the original piece it was based off of. Who knows, I might want to buy the poster even more after seeing it in real life. Other than that the Met is amazing and I'm sure I will go back some day.",0,0,0,Matt P.,"Thetford, VT",115,331,171

You don't have to be an art major to be mesmerized by Egyptian and Greek artifacts dating back 2000 years, or the ethereal nuance of each brushstroke of the European masters. They even have a nice cafe with huge windows that gave me a great view of the fall foliage of Central Park, Nature's own paint palette. (Quick food review: the cheese platter was good, but meager....3 of us each had a drink comprised of spiced rum, hot cider and cinnamon, which really hit the spot). The tab, with tip was $78 which seemed high. Having said that, the price to enter the museum is only what you wish to give, so I didn't feel so bad about the food bill.

5.0,11/25/2016,"As of 1/1/18:  The ""pay what you wish"" policy is, sadly, no longer in place.  Within a short period of time I attended three fabulous art museums, all reminiscent of one another in their world-class splendor:  *  The Met; *  The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston; and*  The Chicago Institute of ArtIf you like museums and have the chance to experience any of these, you can't go wrong but I've visited the Met several times now and each time is an improvement on my previous visit so perhaps this old dog can teach you some new tricks.  First:Yes, I am that person.  The Met has a suggested entrance fee of $25 per person.  When you waltz up and say ""3 tickets please"", they'll suggest $75 but you're free to respond with ""I can only pay $5"" or ""we're only going to be here a couple hours, so I'm going to pay $10"".  Even ""F*ck that, I'm paying $15"".  See where this is going?  The $25 per person is only a suggestion and they really do let you in all day for whatever amount you choose to pay.  Try it, it works.  Second:  The Met is so huge and you're likely to get so lost that you might never locate what it is you want to see.  Even when I know what I want to see?  Hopelessly lost.  If you're able, try in advance to decide what interests you most.  Then, when you have your map ask an employee where that section is and how to get there.  Then ask repeatedly, each time you see another employee.  Seriously; chances of finding it on your own even with a map are slim.I've spent a lot of time at the Met staring at pieces in which I have no interest at the expense of not getting to see things I'd have liked.  Do as I say, not as I've done.  Third:  Bring a pen and mark off parts of the map to indicate the rooms you've already seen.  Failure to do so is a guarantee that you'll miss rooms containing things you wanted to see, even though you were in the exhibit area.  Most room numbers can be found high on the walls.  Fourth:  The Met may blow out your desire to go to another museum for the rest of the week or year.  If not, know that your ticket here (regardless of how much you elected to pay) will also admit you to the Breuer and the Cloisters.  On-line it says that you'll get ""same day"" admission for all of these places but on-site I was told that my Met admission was good at the other places for a few days following my visit to the Met.  So ask when you're there.  I can't fathom trying to see all of these places (even two of these places) in a single day.  That's it.  Enjoy!",11,7,7,Tracey A.,"Marin County, CA",319,1324,1680
5.0,11/22/2016,"Located in the heart of Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum of Art (nicknamed THE MET) is one of most gorgeous museums I've seen in my life. The grand entrance of this museum harkens back to Greek/Roman architecture and gives you a taste of what awaits inside. It can only be described as an art lover's paradise. Every kind of art is available for viewing. But, I was most excited to explore their expansive collection of Greek/Roman sculpture and European paintings, particularly their Impressionist art collection. Even exploring just these particular works of art took several hours. So, please allow yourself time to roam around and enjoy as many different forms of art as possible. I did have enough time to see some Polynesian art and the biggest overhanging stingray sculpture ever. So cool! This museum is great in that general admission is determined by how much you want to donate to keep their museum as beautiful as can be. THE MET recommends a donation of $25, but you can donate more or less if you wish. When I visit NYC again, I will definitely come here for their guided tours or buy their audio tours to truly immerse myself in the stories behind the art.

An outside company organized the scavenger hunt and it was ingenious.  It forced you to explore the entire museum appreciating different art genres.  One thing we did notice was that the front of the museum was incredibly crowded.  I think that was where tours and school groups rendezvoused so definitely try to avoid this area if you have little kids.  Overall a very kid friendly and interesting museum.  Check this place out and get your culture on!",3,1,2,Picha M.,"Saint Louis, MO",157,310,127

The massive sculptures gaze down upon me and beckon me forth. I sit down for a bit to take it all in.Life is about the journey, not the destination. This is especially true here at The Met. It's not enough just to show up. Each work of art begs to be read about, appreciated, photographed, admired, awed and teaches us about it's unique place in our history.It's easy to get caught up in the moment, reimagine history of a favorite art sculpture, get lost in the beauty and meaning of a painting, marvel at the expert craftsmanship of  centuries old horse armor or the delicacy of the Faberge' eggs.This is my very first visit to The Met and I know I'll be back again to enjoy all she has to offer.

5.0,11/11/2016,"This is definitely a must-see in New York. Be careful: do not pay full price! The MET is always ""pay what you want"". Many museums will have admission prices listed and it looks very official so many tourists do not question it and pay the full amount, but often, the fine print will state that it is actually ""suggested general admission"".

Pasta is extra and sushi has different pricing.  They can also give you an empty cup for free water, although I'm not sure if this is true all the time.  Just ask....We were three and spent $87 for lunch and then again $36 for some drinks and snacks.  Restrooms tend to have long lines (ladies) but if you can go to the ground level restroom before cafeteria opens (before 1130) or after lunch time then you might be luckier.  Also, there's really no cell service inside the museum, so stick with your group, learn to read the map (take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the layout of the floors, and where the elevators/escalators, and restrooms are in reference to where you are at.  Make sure that if you do plan to split up to meet at a certain time in such and such location, if not you'll go crazy trying to find your loved ones in a labyrinth!  Make sure everyone has a map!  Didn't happen to us but saw a couple of people going around looking for their family members.  Other than that, enjoy it it's AMAZING!!",0,0,0,Nina R.,"Weston, FL",54,120,1697

5.0,11/1/2016,"As a New Yorker who has been visiting the MET since 1975, let me clarify a few misconceptions and issues that have been brought up by other reviews.1.  The MET sits on the edge of Central Park on the Upper East Side of Manhattan Island.  It is owned by the City of New York.  I am proud to say that thanks to a fellow law school graduate, it was discovered that under the terms of the charter that gave the museum space in Central Park, the museum is not allowed to charge an admission fee (which started back in the 1970's when NYC was really, really broke and had no money for a museum). However, the museum operates as a non-profit and is sustained by a large endowment from private citizens (people like the Koch Brothers, Mike Bloomberg and other really evil rich people), corporations (mostly evil Wall Street companies trying to cleanse their guilt) and by average members (mostly over-educated white urban intellectuals).  As a result the MET has plenty of money and does not really need yours.  So even though there is a suggested admission fee, you are allowed to pay what ever you wish.  The kiosk will require full payment, so wait in line. The staff have been trained to only give you a brief look of derision, but who cares, give a dollar if you wish.2.   Yes the food in the cafes and cafeteria are generally bad as well as grossly overpriced, eating there is a bad idea unless you enjoying paying $100 for lunch.  Here is a great hack.  Bring your own lunch in your backpack.  At the end of your visit, or before if you wish, go the ground floor at the 81st street entrance to the left of the main steps.  There you will find a family area with tables and chairs.  Feel free eat there.  If not, and you really hate your body, try the mystery meat from the carts. 3.  In the old days, you had to pay money to rent a book sized tape recorder about the size of Spock's Tricorder to get an audio tour.  Here is another tip.  Our former mayor, Michael Bloomberg (who is so super rich and cares so much about global warming, that during every weekend he was mayor, he took his private jet to visit his mansion in the Bahamas), has generously to take some of his money that he has been otherwise using to fulfill his &^$#!! quest to take away our  2nd Amendment rights and has paid for the creation of an app that gives visitors a free audio tour of the MET.  Go the the Apple app store, or if you are one of those weird types, the Android app store, and download the free app.  Next to every artifact, well most anyway, there is a number on the wall.   Enter that number into the app and you will here commentary on the artifact.  This also applies to many of their special exhibits as well.4.  I am sorry to inform you, but no, you cannot touch the art, draw on the walls, or otherwise destroy valuable, irreplaceable artifacts of human history.  I know, what a bunch of snobs.  But hey, if you want to vandalize art, go the Modern Art museum, trust me know one will notice and you might actually improve the stuff.5.  Yes, the museum is crowded. This is New York &^#! City.  It is always crowded.  It is also loud.  That is part of what makes our city fun.  No really, it says so in our official tourist guide.  So when should you visit.  Obviously the weekends are the most crowded, especially in the summer.  Pick a weekday morning when the rest of the tourists are still hung over from their dinner at the Olive Garden.  (Oh, one thing.  Look folks, this is the culinary capital of the world. We have restaurants that represent every country in the world.  If you go to times square and eat at Olive Garden or Red Lobster you are missing out.  Ask your hotel for recommendations or try to find a site on the web that offers suggestions from actual New Yorkers).6  As you might have guessed, while I am a native New Yorker who lives a croissants throw from the MET, i am not a guilt ridden, self loathing liberal.  This brings up another important point.  You don't have to be an over-educated, white wine drinking liberal to enjoy this stuff.  This is the history of YOU.  The MET displays and protects the history of all of us, no matter where you came from.  It is for you to enjoy. So please come to the MET and have a great time.  Oh, and for you really rich foreigners, forget what I said in item one and pay the full fee.  We really need your money! But seriously, thanks for visiting our city and enjoy your stay",6,8,3,Jeff B.,"New York, NY",0,9,0

What personally drew me to this museum was their Assyrian empire collection. I ethnically am Assyrian and seeing the artifacts of my people preserved from thousands of years ago made me so proud to be a descendant of ""the cradle of civilization"". I was in NYC for only five days and I ended up coming back a second day to get to experience every part of the museum. Right when you enter you walk up the iconic MET steps and notice the beautiful architecture and detail in every corner. The admission is by donation only and the suggested price is $25 per person but of course, you may pay what you choose. I chose to go with the audio tour which was very helpful on pieces I needed more elaboration on.If you get hungry they have a couple of cafes to choose from which are conveninent if your feet get tired from all the walking. (I'd personally go with the hot dog stands outside but the cafe was great too). I was lucky enough to visit the met while two breath taking exhibitions were up. - The Manus x Machina: Fashion in an age of technology- The Psychobarn by the British artist Cornelia Parker.I am a huge fan of Andrew Bolton(the curator in charge of the costume institute) and I was nothing short of fascinated by the man and machine exhibition, the pieces were remarkable!The Psychobarn was inspired by the classic ""Psycho"" movie and was a replica of the Bates Motel.

I tried many times to greet the workers as I came to exhibits or around corners and they all seemed very annoyed at my greeting or flat or ignored myself and my family. It was very weird. I saw many of the workers flat out screaming at people for accidentally using flash photography or not having their backpacks perfectly in front of them. Most of the people I asked for directions did not want to spend anytime helping. They would just stand and stare people down as they entered their area.

The eateries inside the museum didn't have great reviews unfortunately.

Their collections are extensive, and it can be a bit daunting. It's best if you don't try to see everything at once. We especially enjoyed the Egyptian Temple of Dendur, European sculptures, armor collections, and modern art galleries. The only downside is was their cafe. It smelled like an old high school cafeteria, not good. We should have just left, but it had taken us a while to find it in the basement and we felt invested. My bad!

Go to the 5th floor to check out the views of Central Park and the skyline;2.

5.0,8/25/2016,"WARNING: Experiencing the aesthetic punch from fascinating works of art in a spectacular museum can be highly addictive.  It may take only one visit to create a lifelong passion for art.  When you visit The Met, you realize that you were starving; you get a snack that seems satisfying, but will leave you hungry for MORE.OK, let's deal with admission: recommended is $25. adults, $17. seniors, $12. students.  If I lived in Manhattan, I would not pay the suggested price because I would visit often as a MEMBER.  Ask yourself: how much would a few hours in a Broadway theatre or NYC restaurant cost?  Now, are these hours in The Met not worth the recommended charge?  That being said, I will take umbrage with Met policy that one gets same day admission to two other facilities: the Breuer (old Whitney) a short walk away (75th and Madison) which specializes in modern and contemporary art and the Cloisters, way uptown, which exhibits medieval art.  Same day?  Are you crazy?   There is already way too much to see in the main building on 5th Avenue.  This should be changed to a ticket good for two consecutive days (second day must be other venues) because the Breuer and the Cloisters are both worth visits if you have another day for the total Met experience.The Met is superb and keeps getting better.  It presents ""significant works of art across all times and cultures.""  What that means is you will find some of the artistic wonders of the world from 5000 years ago (ancient Egypt, Asia, etc.) to contemporary.  In many countries,  museums are run by the government and one finds a specific museum for modern and/or contemporary art as opposed to the general encyclopedic museum.  This was a plan for NYC - that MOMA would cover modern art, but then The Met wanted this too (if you received donations of masterpieces completed after 1900 would you say ""No thank you, give them to MOMA""?).To make matters worse,  the day you visit The Met there will undoubtedly be an amazing special exhibition or two on display.  This is the largest art museum in the US.  Pace yourself.  Don't rush and try to see it all.  Pick galleries that interest you where you will find serene beauty full of joy or powerful, profoundly disturbing works.  You will be uplifted by this experience.  You will discover works and/or artists you never knew existed.   Some works (not the same for everyone) are capable of reaching out and grabbing your attention.  You can say they are compelling, captivating, breathtaking.  Actually words are inadequate.Over five million people visit The Met each year.  They are not coming for the food or the store (although those aren't bad).As Thomas Merton said, ""Art enables us to find ourselves and lose ourselves at the same time.""",7,4,7,Jim D.,"Naples, FL",0,165,349
5.0,8/23/2016,"200th review so i'd like to dedicate it to the MET.I always feel like kicking myself when I take for granted how many great museums there are in the city to see. These days, I feel like MoMa and the Whitney museum are more popular among the locals but the MET is still a great classic that has a totally different concept than the other two museums.The cool thing about the MET is that admission is pay-as-you-like but they suggest $25/adult. That being said...I got to say, you have to be ice-cold to only contribute a $1. imho, I feel like it's not a question of personal economics but attitude towards ""value."" if you are willing to pay over $15 to see a movie, then what is stopping you from doing the same for spending a few hours at a huge museum? the truly less fortunate btw would never contribute a $1. i have faith in that.anyway, I'm starting to ramble and I don't need any (more) enemies so i'll cut to the chase. If you've always thought that you were never an ""art person"", the MET might be for you because you might find yourself interested in seeing historical relics like the European/Asian armor and Egyptian tombs. Art-wise, I admit I get kind of bored with some of the painting choices but I love seeing some of the more recognizable works like Van Gogh's ""wheat fields with cypresses.""also, totally nerdy last comment but there's a staryu nest in the temple of dendur room....if...if...that's your thing.",2,1,2,Mich L.,"Edgewater, NJ",195,227,33

However, I have NEVER been to a museum in the world that has had such rude staff. Some of the staff clearly lack any level of courtesy and chose to add snide remarks  to some of their comments. While, most of the staff was pleasant and polite, the rude staff left a poor impression to my companions and I.I liked the overall feel of the museum, it allows for each of the pieces to get the justice they deserve, whereas some museums tend to overload some displays with too many items. However, the organization of the galleries makes it a little more difficult to navigate than something like the Detroit Institute of Art. For those not intrigued by art, you can watching the sunset over Central Park on the rooftop, it's a stunning view contrasting of the park and the skyscrapers. I would recommend spending at least several days if you really want to walk this entire museum. The best thing about this museum is a recommended admission compared to a required admission cost. Art was meant to be enjoyed by people and this gallery allows for anyone to come and visit.All in all, I would definitely make a stop at the Met, even if you're not a fan of museums.

(See Pics of the other amazing things this museum has to offer as well)(1) The Egyptian temple - walking into that space always blows me away. It's beautiful. Note, it will ALWAYS be crowded, so your hopes of having a pristine photograph taken are pretty much shot. Therefore, you should put down your smartphones and just enjoy the beauty of that space. (2) The 360 degree mural of Versailles - located just beyond the Egyptian temple, this might be my favorite room in the permanent exhibit. Take in all of the small details, you will be glad you did. (3) The roof deck - if you visit during the warmer months, do not miss a trip up to the roof! There are gorgeous views of both the Park and the skyline. Plus, they have (limited) seating and a bar, so you can have a drink, enjoy the view and escape the madness of the museum for a minute. Admission: While the suggested admission is $25/adult, the museum's policy is ""pay what you wish."" Therefore, if coughing up $25 for this visit is a hardship, you can pay anything over $1 and get in. It's a great place to bring friends and family when they are in town. The museum can be a relative bargain, and I've never brought someone here who was disappointed by the experience. Last tip, use the restrooms downstairs and in the south side of the museum, they always seem cleaner to me. (Probably less frequented.)",2,0,1,Shachi B.,"New York, NY",61,555,752

The Met's permanent collection is curated by seventeen separate departments. I didn't do this museum justice, as I only walked viewed the art on the first floor. I didn't get a chance to go to the second and third floors. I wasn't familiar with the art I viewed, but there are a lot of famous artists with works here including Vincent van Gogh, Rembrandt, Pablo Picasso, Paul Cézanne, etc. ""Washington Crossing the Delaware"" by Emanuel Leutze is a painting that should be familiar to most, but didn't get to see it.

The ticket line moved quickly and I was able to pay whatever amount I desired for the ticket as a donation to keep the museum running. I really like that they do this because it means that more people have the chance to visit this museum and see the art. My favorite exhibits were in Ancient Egypt, the American Art Gallery, and the Contemporary Art Gallery. I am a sucker for American history, but it was also awesome to see paintings by artists that I knew of.

It was pretty cool how there were staged rooms from the 1700s for display so it feels like you're actually in a house from the past.

5.0,7/12/2016,"Of course there are other museums on the strip, but in my mind, The Met is The powerhouse in Museum Mile. Unquestionably, crowds cram the legendary stairs leading inside. The Met is a huge historical art playground with permanent and temporary exhibits, that you just can't get to, in a day.All their exhibits are interesting, but some more amazing than others. I particularly enjoy their Egyptian collection, showing their lovely artifacts, sculptures, jewelry and culture. And walking through some of the exhibits, including the Egyptian wing, just relaxes me.Regular admission is $25, but there's a 'Suggested Admission' where you can pay anything your heart desires. Regular admission, though, does not grant you full access to the few special and temporary exhibits The Met offers, every so often.

5.0,7/6/2016,"There's a reason that many credible sources pit the Met against internationally famous museums like the Louvre and the Hermitage- it holds its own! The Met is a wonderful museum. I spent about three hours here SOLELY in the European Paintings section. Being the Europhile art enthusiast that I am, I was truly at home. The museum, though mega-sized, has a detailed and straightforward layout. I was able to see all of the works that I came for plus many more breathtaking pieces. I suggest researching the art you are interested prior to entering the museum so that you can plan a route through the museum. My biggest piece of advice no matter your taste in art? Take 15 minutes to visit the rooftop garden lounge. It's stunning and the views will make for enviable pictures. All in all, great museum. Military ID will get you and 2 others in free.

I made a new line for the manus and Machina exhibit after seeing news clips about it. The dresses were all presented elegantly on mannequins some of the dresses were absolutely stunning!

They know where everything is, from where each exhibit is, to each elevator, to each restroom! I loved how everywhere we went, there were always staff there to help give directions! You have to give a donation when you enter - doesn't matter the amount but you have to give something, and they won't judge you or criticize you for giving something as little as a penny.

It's really weird! The busiest areas are Egypt, Greece and Italy. No one seems to care about any other exhibits (especially the furniture storage area) because I was able to make ridiculous Snap Chat videos in all of the inhabited spots, with no problem.

5.0,6/21/2016,"Ahmazing. I love visiting museums and have been fortunate enough to visit some great museums around the world. The MET is great if you enjoy paintings. They have some sculptures and drawings and artifacts, but lots and lots of paintings. I happen to enjoy paintings and was very impressed with the MET's collection of Van Goghs, Manets, and Rembrandts. I take that back.... Now that I think about it, there were other really great, non-painting exhibits that I guess I was slightly less excited about. They do have an armory exhibit and a very cool Egyptian exhibit. You can literally spend days here exploring everything the MET has to offer. Plus, the museum itself is located in such a cool place, right next to Central Park!I also suggest going up to the rooftop bar for some great views of the park. When I went, they had a special exhibit on fashion and dresses. It was amazing. Just like everything else in the museum. :)Cool fact: you are able to buy a museum membership for only $75. Now it may seem steep, but since admission is a donation anyways, it's not that bad if you think of your membership fee as an admission for 4 people.

5.0,6/15/2016,"To clarify the Met's slightly misleading backpack policy posted on its website, visitors can actually bring standard-sized backpacks/messenger bags into exhibit areas without checking them at the coat check--as long as they are worn in front of the body like a baby carrier (or an actual unborn baby). This is ostensibly to prevent visitors' bags from blindly hitting exposed paintings and sculptures that are not cordoned off by rope or protected by glass--but I suspect there are other reasons as well.Of course, all bags are still manually checked for food and other restricted items at the entrance. If you do manage to sneak in a snack, you can eat it near or in any of the dining areas (like the Great Hall Balcony Bar or the Petrie Court Cafe) or in the open areas outside restrooms and gift shops--basically anywhere just as long as it's not inside a gallery or near a priceless work of art.Contrary to popular misconception, ""pay-what-you-wish"" doesn't mean you can waltz in past the guard without a ticket. (I admit having tried and having seen other people try.) Whether you're a pauper or a miser, there are multiple ways to score a free ticket: IDNYC, Bank of America, library passes, free museum days, etc. Plus, get same-day access to Breuer and Cloisters with general admission. (If you're feeling philanthropic (but not $25-philanthropic), consider donating the average $11, and be sure to thank the private and corporate donors who are picking up the other 86%+ of the museum's budget.)If you can walk fast and speed-read English, the entire Fifth Avenue museum can be easily seen within four hours or less--including almost all of the special collections, the mezzanines, and the roof--though I would strongly advise against doing it through a glacially slow, Lincoln-Tunnel-paced guided group tour. If you get lost in one of the corner mezzanines like I did, the super-friendly gallery guards will point you in the right direction--and may even give you some insider tips on where to go next.",29,21,4,Brian L.,"Edison, NJ",173,275,1946

5.0,6/10/2016,"The Met is an absolute must see attraction in NYC. I have explored this museum in a different way each time I've visited - a work scavenger hunt, Museum Hack tour, and guided tours. It is impossible to see this museum and appreciate all that it has to offer in a one-day visit, so its most helpful if you focus your visit on the areas that interest you the most. Some tips for your visit:1. The admission is a suggested price... so you can essentially pay whatever you wish. If you are a student/unemployed, this may be a big plus. 2. Browse through the list of free guided tours online before visiting, so you can plan the timing of your visit accordingly. There are frequent guided tours (free with admission) scheduled throughout the day spanning a variety of subjects and lasting approximately 30 min to an hour. 3. Food in the cafes is expensive. A banana that is 25 cents at your neighborhood bodega is marked up 400%. Bring your own water. You can always step out of the museum - buy food from the carts lined outside, enjoy your meal on the museum steps, and possibly be lucky enough to hear live music from street performers. 4. Avoid the bathroom in the Ancient Egypt section of the first floor because you may easily spend 20 to 30 minutes waiting. Find a more secluded restroom area to avoid the crowds. During my most recent visit to the MET, I took a one hour guided tour entitled ""Fashion in Art."" The guide focused in on about 6 pieces of art located in various different areas of the museum and educated the audience through the lens of costume/fashion. After the tour, I finished my visit by seeing the famous Fashion exhibit (which is only on display till mid-August) and it was mesmerizing!",4,0,1,Neha P.,"Manhattan, NY",47,160,232

Wear comfortable shoes, check in your bag if necessary, don't rush, and enjoy the beautiful art that The Met has to offer. Price: You pay what you want. How sweet is that?!

5.0,6/9/2016,"Absolutely stunning museum with so much to see you could spend the whole day here. The paintings on the walls are only a small portion of what this museum is, as the museum itself is a piece of art. It's so large that you feel as though it could go on forever. There's something about walking through the American works part of the museum that contained so much furniture and art pieces from early US history that made me feel a sense of internal peace (kind of like a library but more aesthetically pleasing). As such it came to be my favorite part of the museum (that I saw so far). Something I really admire that the museum does is price it so that you can pay what you want. That way those who are on a tight budget (students, seniors, under/unemployed, etc) can still enjoy it as well. There are suggested prices though. I can honestly say that I can't wait until I can come here again. I love the MET and felt that I was appreciating art in all different forms and mediums.

4.0,6/8/2016,"What's the factor in giving this four instead of five?  Since the 90s, I remember thinking that the Met was pretty good, but not great.  I mean, it's hard to deny their incredible catalog of stuff.. I think as I aged, I developed a taste for more specific types of art.  The Met has a surplus of historic crap, ranging from old European paintings to Greek and Roman statues and Egyptian and Mid-east art, etc etc etc.. which of course IS art, but popular culture deems it more as history than art.  So all that being said, the majority of the museum feels more like a history lesson than art.  This is my humble opinion, please forgive me if I am hurting the feelings of opinionated first year art students.  I lived in Chicago for a while and I think that AIC is easily better than the Met.  That includes the building layout, the catalog, and the selections on display.The Met does a lot of things right.  The layout can be a little confusing, but it usually is at most museums upon your first visit.  The disadvantage of the Met is that it is a tourist haven.  Loads of people stepping in front of you as you observe art is an annoyance that becomes unavoidable.  If you have a day (or two!) to spend in a museum, then this is certainly the place to do it.  A must visit if you're in NYC.",0,0,0,Brian L.,"Chicago, IL",92,627,57

The Met is fantastic and crowded so get here early, purchase a, ""City-Pass"" to save some extra cash and give yourself plenty of time to explore as much of the exhibits as you can. Use a map to seek out actual art installations you're interested in, this will save you loads of wandering around time. I did a little homework before coming here and found out that if you wanted to see every inch of this place, from top to bottom, it would take about two weeks to see it all, ain't nobody got time for that!PRO-TIP: Got here late?

1.0,6/8/2016,"This review is long overdue and is tied specifically to last year's ""China: Through the Looking Glass"" that ran through the summer of last year at the Metropolitan. Normally, I'm a huge fan of the Met. It's without a doubt one of the most prestigious and well-run institutions in the world, and it always does a fantastic job of making the old palatable for the new-- my first trip here was way back in elementary school and I've enjoyed almost every visit since then. A museum's primary responsibility--in my opinion-- is to contextualize. Its main goal should not be to serve merely as a repository for ancient ruins and valuable treasures. The museum's real value is bringing these items to life and stringing together a coherent narrative that teaches us what happened, how it happened, and why it happened. This is no doubt why field trips are commonly hosted by museums. They present a tremendous learning opportunity and can shape and structure perceptions and perspectives for generations. Given this, it is then even more imperative that museums try their best in presenting a fair and hopefully unbiased view of its subject matter. The Met failed fantastically in this effort for last year's exhibit. When walking into the exhibit, the very first thing you see is a gigantic placard, explaining the exhibit's mission statement and goal. Smack dab in the middle of that text is a brief disclaimer specifically pointing out that the exhibit's goal is to show ""fashion in a vacuum"", without ""political biases"" and all of this oh-so-bad things we all want to avoid. In trying to erase these political, cultural, and social influences, the Met completely misses the point. Given how politicized Chinese society was from 1910-present day, and how pervasive political undertones really were, it would be a tremendous disservice to Chinese history and Chinese culture to present literally white-washed clothing and ""high fashion"" clothing conceived during a time when the West still very much held completely backwards and racist notions of China...or should I say: ""The Orient."" The Tom Fords, YSLs, and other major fashion houses presented at this exhibit were abominations. Yes-- it will definitely draw in the crowds, because all of a sudden THIS, of all things, makes them feel more sophisticated and cultured, but in reality it's the misappropriation of a culture just so you can pretend to ""know"" Asian culture. Because after all, Chinese fashion really just consists of smacking dragons on everything and sporting skin-tight qipaos right? The ignorance that the curators displayed in composing this exhibit was honestly very shocking to me. I had thought that an institution like the Met would treat the subject matter with the gravity and seriousness that it deserved, and truly do some digging to find the influences and context that actually brought this material to life. Perhaps feature an exhibit on the opium trade's jarring impact on modern-day China, and how that carried over to fashion. Not show an old bottle of perfume dubbed ""Opium"" by YSL without any explanation whatsoever. Allowing this to happen at an exhibit as popular as ""Through the Looking Glass"" not only fails to underscore the HISTORICAL and PRESENT problems related to race, culture, and the misappropriation of one group's beliefs for commercial use, but it exacerbates this issue to the point of negatively affecting the future. I'm embarrassed and frankly disappointed that museum goers did not view this exhibit with more discerning eyes. It was a failing and absolutely a missed opportunity of which The Met should be embarrassed as well.",2,1,0,Henry Y.,"New York, NY",376,801,1

5.0,6/5/2016,How do you rate such a monumental NYC museum? What do you say? Well lets try..The size. This place is HUUUGGGEE as far as museums go. It will take you a few trips to cover this place. You could literally get lost in this place. Forget looking like a noob and be sure to pick up a map to help traverse this place. The security guards are also not all that bad and will give you directions if you need them.The tourists. If you hate tourists as much as I do you might want to visit this place either before it closes or during the week as this place will get crowded. Ive been here on days when it was literally shoulder to shoulder everywhere. If you plan on visiting to only see one special exhibit definitely try to avoid going as soon as the exhibit opens and try waiting towards the end of it viewing.Paying. Remember admission price is suggested and not mandatory. These museums are funded by NYC's philanthropist billionaires so there's no need for me to ever pay more than $5 a ticket. No shame to my game.Exhibits. Besides the main exhibits that have been there forever they feature traveling exhibits that are often amazing.I love this museum and have been going since I was child.

2.0,6/1/2016,"Dear management of the Met, I wanted to give you a great review. I even wrote to your customer service department to hopefully avoid giving you anything less than the 5 star review that your art collection deserves. However, I cannot support a company that does not value customer service (even if your collection is world famous.). I even waited 6 weeks to post this review in the hopes that you would respond to a customer's concerns. However, the lack of response further increases my concern with your facility. Please work on your employee training program. Here is a copy of my email that describes my experience at your facility. I am writing about several interactions I had with employees at your facility.  We visited the MET (in April) on a trip to NYC. This was the one place my friend wanted to see, and we were so excited to see your world famous art collection. It was raining outside, and the building was crowded. The line moved quickly and your front desk staff was very efficient.  I work in the Informal field and know how stressful it is when attendance is higher than predicted. However, we had a couple of interactions with employees that detracted from the experience.  The problem we had was with the back pack policy. We went through bag check, and no one mentioned that you could not wear backpacks on your back. We did not see any signs about them either but were not looking for them when we entered the building. When we were in the building, we passed by several employees with no mention of the backpack on my back. We entered the temple, and the docent asked me to put my backpack in the front because of the tight passage. I thought this was just to prevent the bag from hitting the artifacts in the area. She was very friendly about the request and used appropriate tone.After exiting, I placed my bag on my back. Again, we passed by numerous employees after this with no mention of the bag on my bag. An hour later, a docent reprimanded me for wearing my pack on my back. I asked him if this was the rule for the entire facility and he said ""Why would I tell you this if it is not the rule?"" he then started laughing and walked off. While he walked away, he passed by two people with bags on their backs without commenting to them. I was so upset that I decided to check my bag and leave a comment. No one at your info desk knew how to send an electronic comment.After checking my bag, we stayed until close. We were determined to still enjoy the facility.  We had trouble finding the exit and asked a docent as he passed by. He pointed and did not speak to us. We also observed two employees on the floor on their cell.  I write this email to encourage additional guest service training.  I look at the interactions on the floor with the guidelines I give my staff, as this service would not be tolerated at my facility.  The interactions I had with your staff are examples of how curt encounters can really ruin the visit to what is said to be an amazing facility.  I am also going to use these examples when I train my new employees.  In the future, I will encourage my staff to always provide world class service because one bad interaction can change your view of the whole facility.",6,3,2,Lori W.,"Oceanside, CA",281,425,1639
5.0,6/1/2016,"How this can be any less than 5 stars is stupefying.With the entry price of whatever you want to pay (we did the full $25) to the immense collection of what is arguably the best in the Americas you cannot top this museum.The architecture of the structure alone is amazing with a great mix of Neo-Classical and later styles as the museum grew. The line moved brusquely and despite their being hundreds of people on line at opening time we were able to get our tickets in less than 20 minutes. A huge difference from the comparable European locations like the Uffizi were it took us 3 hours.The collection of American art is obviously a huge portion of the overall display ranging from paintings, silver, furniture and even whole rooms.The European artworks are equally as extensive with great representations by Monet and Picasso and some older masters as well. The antiquities are also a key highlight with a good showing of Roman, Greek, Babylonian and Egyptian sculpture.

5.0,5/8/2016,"The MET is legendary. So upon arrival to the MET, you'll know that you've made it because the building is absolutely breathtaking. You've probably also seen it as a backdrop for the annual MET gala. The museum is simply huge. I hadn't been since 2011 and decided that I was past due for a visit and so I went to decided to venture here last week. With a solid game plan and pure determination, I was able to see a majority of the museum this time (with the exception of one wing upstairs within about 4 hours. I would NOT recommending trying to squeeze this museum into a four hour trip, but if that is all the time that you have, then a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do. I've included a basic list of tips below. Breakdown:1) Arrive a prior to opening time. The museum opens at 10am and I got there around 9:30am. Security formed a line at the base of the entrance for visitors. Getting there early is nice because you can get a head start on the exhibits before things get too busy. This will be priceless by noon as people are still pouring inside of the MET. 2) Decide what works for you. I'd recommend spending a full day from open to close and keep a steady pace. The other option is to take your time and spend two days slowly making your way through each division. 3) Have a hearty breakfast before entering the MET. There are a few different restaurants, including a cafeteria inside of the museum, however the options are not vast.4) Wear comfortable shoes, you will be doing a lot of walking. At first glance, yet the MET is large, but it is actually much larger than you initially imagine. However once you begin to navigate each section you'll notice that you will advancing deeper into the deeper into the rabbit hole. 5) Photos are allowed, so pack your camera.6) Bring your student ID. The website says students pay $12, but once I arrived, I was told that students 'pay what you want' so I ended up donating $5.00. That is a vast improvement from the general recommended admission of $25pp. I double checked the website and the amounts listed are only recommendations. Any visitor can pay whatever they choose to donate. However, according to the site, this option is only available at the ticket counter, not online.7) Be sure to get a map / handout. It will save you time and ensure that you are able to visit areas that pique your interests. 8) Expect to get lost. Lost? Yes. The museum is just that big... and slightly confusing. Just go with it and don't beat yourself up too bad if you miss small rooms or sections along the way. It is inevitable, but look for 'information desks' strategically placed throughout the building. 9) They have a coat check. I generally like to lug my belongings along with me wherever I venture, but you'll want to think twice before committing to that heavy jacket in a museum this size. Otherwise, try and dress light if the weather is nice. 10) Have fun and get ready to soak in some amazing art and history.",8,4,4,Kari C.,"Rochester, NY",259,691,2225

5.0,5/6/2016,"Ditto what everyone and their mom says on the ""you could spend an eon here and not..."" This is a stunning museum with a vast collection of paintings, sculptures, etchings, architecture, furniture, and heaven-knows-what-else. I only got to spend a few hours here and more or less spent the whole time picking my jaw up off the floor and/or feeling my poor, tiny brain expand at the ways artists have interpreted their world and expressed themselves over the centuries.I mainly came here to look at paintings. The collection of great European painters (Monet, Van Gogh, Picasso, Cezanne, Braque, Renoir, Seurat, Manet, etc.) was vast and mind-blowing...what a treat to be able to spend time with iconic masterpieces and not feel like a cow being herded past them or constantly have someone shove past you with their smart phone (that does happen, but it was rare, despite the rainy day crowds).I must say that, with all respect to the painters mentioned above, I was most blown away by a room dedicated to Thomas Hart Benton; every square inch of the walls of this room were covered in Benton's ""America Today"" murals depicting 1920s American life. They are mesmerizing, and they absorb almost all of the light in the room in a way that instills a sense of deep, quiet reverence for this bygone vision. Absolutely awe-inspiring.Lots of other genius work by Jonathan Singer Sargent, Edward Hopper, and Winslow Homer, plus a lot of engrossing portraits from very early America, and the grand expanse of Leutze's ""Washington Crossing the Delaware.""So! Even though this is a 5-star review, I must say that many of the museum staff are horribly rude people whom I can only assume are trained to treat museum-goers as if they are would-be vandals and jackasses rather than people who have come to appreciate the art. Don't dare try to look at brushstrokes, and don't dare try to check a backpack that has food in it, or you will be shrieked at as if you are about to set a roomful of kittens on fire, you stupid mindless tourist.

If you are a member you get discounted parking below the museum, still pricy, but its discounted.  Most recently I took a tour from a docent named Patricia.  She was awesome.  Truely what a docent experience should be.  She knew a lot.  She engaged her group.  She was thrilled to have so many people (it was a rainy day).  She was only positive and no matter what her audience replied she was encouraging, even if in her next sentence she said ""this is the answer"" and it was the polar opposite of what the person in the tour had said (that would have been me perhaps :)  ).We had a tour of modern art, which the museum is focusing on a lot these days, and has added another site dedicated to it.  I am not smart enough to understand most modern art, which is why a guided tour is great for me. Anyway, the Met is awesome.  You can spend days in here.  Personally I plan my visit around what I want to see when I'm there, a current show perhaps?  Or some of the old masters?  I'm not super interested in the Greek or Romans art, so usually blow by there.  But next time I may just take a tour, I learned a lot on this past one.   I may learn to appreciate the Greeks or Romans.  You never know.",16,3,14,Maria B.,"Buffalo, NY",4839,3367,3423

They suggest that you pay something, but you can get in for free. I heard that they actually make quite a bit of money. I'm all for supporting the arts, but there fee is quite steep if you are there for only a bit. There is no way to see everything in just less than two hours. Just a tip is all! ;-) We did enjoy what we saw though. They had a Crime Scene Photos exhibit which we both really liked, marble sculptures, printmaking, and classics like Monet, Picasso, Roden, Cezanne, etc... All were really beautiful but way to overwhelming to take in in less than two hours. We did what we could though. We both wanted to go back but just didn't have the time to do so.

5.0,4/17/2016,"It is difficult to give a rating to education. That is what the Met represents to me. We were mesmerized as we spent hours looking through the different exhibits from different geographical areas and historical periods. My favorite thing was getting to see work by Picasso and Van Gogh in person. It was so special to see with my own eyes paintings I have seen in books. The museum is split up into 6 different areas, each representing a different culture: Ancient Rome, Ancient Egypt, Asia, and Europe to name a few. There was a sculpture hall with a huge statue of Hercules. BEST butt I have ever seen. I could do squats for the rest of time and never get to the level of Hercules. There were wooden statues that were thousands of years old from Egypt. There were even some art pieces done within the last few years. It was mind blowing to think of all of the restoration that must go into each art piece. You have got to include the Metropolitan Museum in your travel itinerary. And you had better leave a few hours for it. Ps- suggested donation of $25 a person is bogus... Locals pay a dollar a person on a generous day",8,6,6,Jencen R.,"Bellevue, WA",1033,532,809
5.0,4/11/2016,"As good as art gets! ***Tips and advice at the end of review!***The MET is a world class museum that is a MUST SEE for anyone visiting the city. The museum itself is enormous with 3 wings that would take a whole day or even longer to see.Suggest coming early on a weekday. Take a map and figure out your plan. Directly up the stairs in the middle is European art, which is where I usually start. But from Renaissance masterpieces to ancient Greek terracotta pottery to Qing dynasty scriptures to Gothic Medieval armory to there is everything here!Check for any special exhibitions that are on view for a limited time. When the MET curates a new limited showcase exhibit it very often loans famous pieces from other museums or private collectors around the world, so be on the look out for those as it is a rare chance to enjoy a globally curated art showcase in one roof. Another exciting exhibit is the fashion ones curated by the Costume Institute at the MET which Andrew Bolton and the American Vogue team up on once a year. The glitzy MET Gala that opens this exhibit is basically the Oscars of the fashion world, so it's something not to miss.Definitely visit The Temple of Dendur in the Egypt wing, the massive temple is really excavated from Egypt, don't know how on earth they brought it here, but it is and that thing is massive and weighs tons!TIPS AND ADVICE BELOW!!!- DON'T BRING SELFIE STICKS- Don't block the exit doors! Line up where people are going in, not out- Security check at the entrance, no food and drinks except water- Right and left side has admissions desks, so choose the shorter line- Fee is SUGGESTED DONATION! The minimum to get is 10 cents, but don't do that unless you want nasty looks! $1-$5 per person is sufficient.- DO NOT touch or get too close to any of the artworks/sculptures or security will call you out- NO FLASH and video or professional photographing due to copyrighting issues- Food options are very overpriced and limited, suggest to buy food outside and eat in Central Park instead- The 4,5,6 train to 86th street is your closest subway- CLOSED on Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years day, 1st Monday in May(for Met Gala)- Open late on Saturday nights(until 9pm!) but all other nights close around 5:30pm- If you intend to have a Gossip Girl moment and sit on the steps of the main entrance, sit on the side to allow museum goers to enter and exit- When you're outside NEVER TAKE CDs of guys passing them out on the street promoting their latest hip hop or rap debut, it is a scam! Street performers you are welcome to tip like the Jazz guy who plays the sax outside!BONUS PRO TIP!!!!!Admissions to the MET also include SAME DAY admissions to any MET museum and exhibitions. This includes MET BREUER (modern and contemporary art) and MET CLOISTERS (Medieval art and gardens) so take advantage of this and I would highly recommend going uptown to Washington Heights to visit the CLOISTERS!BONUS PRO TIP 2!!!!The rooftop garden is a swanky little hidden part of the museum.

The costumes were gorgeous from such amazing designers. I learned so much about a culture I didn't know much about just by their style of dress. It can be frustrating taking the subway here since it's a bit of a trek once you get off, but it's very worth it. This museum isn't just a bunch of painting it's so much more, so much culture and history. 500 centuries and a quarter of a mile of art and history. The building itself is a piece of art!

5.0,3/27/2016,"What a beautiful museum.  The Metropolitan Museum is one of the best laid out museums ever.  I spend two days here for about 3 hours each day.  My friends and I looked at the map to see which exhibits we wanted to see.  We all really wanted to see the Ancient Greek and Roman exhibits, sculptures, the armoury, some Renaissance pieces, the Asian exhibits, and some impressionist pieces.All the exhibit pieces are labelled with different plaques.  Each exhibit has the name, the era, and some historical facts about the time era.  They also have information about a culture's religion, their funerary arrangements, their donors, etc.My one little problem with this place is the difficulty of finding some exhibits.  This may seem confusing as I said the layout was amazing and that relates to the actual art exhibits themselves.  It was all about the actual organisation of the arts.    But it was a little hard to navigate the actual museum because of stairs and different wings of the museum.Admission is an interesting deal too-- you pay whatever you want to pay.  You could pay as much a penny.  This is an amazing opportunity for any person from any walk of life to see amazing pieces of not just artwork, but also pieces of history.Make the Met a destination for your next trip to NY or just a destination for a date if you live in the state.",3,2,3,Niku L.,"Kalihi, Honolulu, HI",23,266,2140

I only had 3.5hrs here and did a tour de force trying to hit every major wing, but I want to come back...again, and again, and again. For me, the experience here, aside from visually consuming the various masterpieces and artifacts and triumphs of the human spirit, was having my faith in humanity restored. After running the Rat Race on a daily basis and seeing the worst in people because that is the side they choose to show, this place is a refuge for rediscovering the beauty of humanity and all the incredible things it is capable of.

We spent time mostly in the American wing (I had no idea Washington Crossing the Delaware was so HUGE), modern and contemporary art, European paintings 1250-1800, and 19th & 20th European sculpture and paintings. We saw legendary works by Degas, van Gogh, Picasso, Matisse, Monet, Renoir, Rembrandt, Miró, Klimt, Seurat, Pollock, O'Keeffe, Warhol, Lichtenstein, and more.

Give the receptionist your groceries COINS and say, ""Can I have ___ ticket(s), please?"" And a magic will happen. Then download THE MET APP for free audio guide.

The temple dated back to 15BC (Augustus Caesar), but try if you can find an inscription from the 19th century. Some stupid visitors from more than 2 centuries ago carved on an international treasure as a record of their presence. - Gallery 305 - The Medieval Hall was the ONLY original building of the museum in the 1880s.- Gallery 507 - Bedroom from Sagredo Palace - If Youtube were available in the 17th century, the Sagredo's family should do a room tour.- Gallery 625 - Duccio di Buoninsegna's ""Madonna and Child"" - Hmm, this little thing was the Met's Christmas gift to its audience. It costed $45 million in 2004, and is still the museum's most expensive work. - Gallery 701 - Louis Sulivan stairs was rescued from Chicago Stock Exchange.- Rooftop Garden is open most of the year, depending on weather.

To say this muesum is one of the most interesesting museums in whole New York City, it isn't exaggerate at all. The exhibitions here are really diverse, From American to Asia. It just offers too many great collections, people might find themselves easy lost track of time here.I was here in a rainy day, the waiting line was really long, it was already line up till the very beginning of the street. It already showed the popularity by just this. I might already got used to wait on the line in NYC. It didn't bother me at all. Of coruse, also because I wasn't alone. That actually helped. It took about half hour to reach the entrance, that was faster than I expected.  As soon as reached the entrance, there was the security check. I guess, that was the reason why the line was so long outside the building. After that, thing just go faster and easier. It took really just couple miuntes to get the tickets, after that I was good to go.The museum was huge, so I decided to just have quick look of couple collections. Since we got some pretty similar one back in Germany. some of them are really interesting, such as the european sculpture and decorative Arts, The american Wing, Greek and Roman art,  Asian art and so on. there got some chinese tranditional painting at teh 3rd floor as well. I was able to finish to go around the museum. It did take me more than 4 hours though. I didn't get to check all of them one by one, just the one I found interested. So for some people probably it will took longer time to walk through the whole place.Overall, I love this place, I believe I could spent more time here if I have more time and not hungry.

It's not an overly long list; I can get over your appreciation for some crappy club that charges way too much for a beer, and is full of Dbags (did I use the term Dbag in a review of one of the cultural highlights the world has to offer?). Or your love of some awesomely awful restaurant that you swear has the best fried chicken sandwich, and is ""totally worth the 2 hour line"" (it's not).  I can even get over your lack of travel ambition (...well not really, the world is awesome get your ass out there). But if you don't like the Met? Well then there is no hope for us, let's just go our own separate ways (I'll be out doing all the fun cool stuff; you enjoy...whatever it is that you do). I could go on about how impressive their collection of impressionist paintings are (some of the finest outside of Paris, only the d'Orsay does it better in my humble opinion), or the cool revolving exhibitions they do like China, or the upcoming Vigée Le Brun: Woman Artist in Revolutionary France (yes I am a dork...don't care). But there is really no point. Why should you visit the Met? To get lost. Every time I come here I find a new room I have not seen before (or a room that looks so different, it feels new), and it keeps me feeling young. It's hard to get the thrill of being in a new place, a place that matters, when you get to a certain age and this place continues to make me feel this way, almost without fail (if its super packed, it's a bit hard to enjoy the place, but c'est la vie). This is one of the only museums I pay to support, I can't imagine any reason I'd ever stop (moving to Cambodia? I'd still keep up with my membership), it's that near and dear to me.  If you've never been, go. If you haven't been in a while, go back.

From the Egyptian temple on one end to the galleries on the opposite that had multiple works from every notable impressionist artist, it was incredible. My boys never left the armor section. That's two hours that a 13 and 17 year old were entranced and remained on their feet after a full day of walking around the Big Apple. If I was to complain, it'd be that it was so packed full of Amazing that I couldn't get to it all. But that's not really a complaint--that's me whining about needing more time at the Met.

Other than that admission is free or pay as you wish. There are usually lines waiting to get in. I'm the first one there when doors open. You will go through security check. There are various sections. I go to the ones that I enjoy. I love the paintings and sculptures. I recently found a spot that had stained glass. I enjoyed the selection of stain glass too. It really is hard to explain the variety of art forms on exhibit here. You need to go to see for yourself. Bring comfortable shoes! Enjoy the fountains and food carts at the front of the building. The building just went through a massive renovation. You can take as many pictures as you like both inside and out. No one complains. For a huge sample of what you will see, check out the four thousand plus pictures posted on Yelp!  I'm not adding to that!

5.0,12/14/2015,"There's a reason why The Met is a world-class museum - it's excellently curated and absolutely MASSIVE, chock full of pieces of art. I could probably live here, actually, since there are exhibits of interiors of homes of the past.The suggested donation is $25, which you pay at the entrances to any of the exhibit halls. The attendant asked me how much I would like to donate, to which I said $25 - he actually told me that I could donate less if I wanted, so there is zero obligation if $25 is too high.I do think the museum is worth more than $25, though! Once you pay the $25, you get a little sticker to put on you, which is proof that you bought a ticket for that day.The pieces I wanted to see most (and in general the most famous ones):* Washington Crossing the Delaware. The original was destroyed during World War II, and the artist repainted it. Twice!!! This is the larger one.* Wheatfield with Cypresses. The name isn't very striking, but you'll recognize Van Gogh's painting once you see it.* Panorama of the Palace and Gardens at Versailles. It's almost like you're in Versailles! But not really!

Honestly even if you know the exhibit you want to see is right, once you get your purse inspected go the other way, pay then get your sticker and walk back to wear you want to be. This is if it's crowded. The right admissions is also located next to the coat check, so people check the coat and jump into the closest line. Don't be that guy!My art professor told me the money often goes to parties/events for members. Therefore I always do a ""suggested donation"" quite a bit lower than the suggested price. That's the beauty of suggested price and definitely spoiled me to other art institutions. It's also open every day (unlike most museums) and does a late night Saturday.If it's your first time, definitely try to plan and prioritize because it's huge and you just won't be able to do it all.

5.0,12/7/2015,"Not sure I could rate this venerable institution any less than 5 stars. Just the architectural aspect of this building is mind-boggling. It is such a massive structure, which you cannot even appreciate until you are lost in the maze of hallways, courtyards, lofty atria, and random temples. I do think that the rooms should be better marked with the numbers that are on the maps, because I did waste a lot of time retracing steps. They also close off some of the rooms, which, if you are trying to get from one end to another is very annoying. You have to spend 10 minutes backtracking. My favorite areas:1. Temple (check out the size of this room)2. Modern Art (it's famous work after famous work - Monet, Van Gogh, etc.)3. Knights armor (the horsemen display)4. Musical instruments (multiple Stradivarius violin)5. Hall of statues (beautiful Roman statues)You can pay what you want, but you have to pay something. I made the mistake of saying I wasn't going to pay anything one of the times I went, and the guy got really pissed. It was an honest mistake because when they say ""recommended,"" you assume it is. ANYWAYS, now I know. I think it's fine to pay the recommended price, but if you live in New York and want to frequent this place, it's absolutely unaffordable to pay the recommended price each time you go.

4.0,12/1/2015,"WOW. All I can say is that this museum is GIANT! It is grand and gorgeous. Hubby, baby, BIL and I decided to spend a rainy few hours here to kill some time before dinner. We spent a good 2-3 hours here and barely finished one wing of this museum. Some issues I found with this museum are that they don't have enough ramps for baby strollers. When we first arrived to the museum, there wasn't any clear signs to point you into the direction of an elevator. We had a stroller and we had to manually carry it up the steps. If you've been here, you know that there are a lot of steps out front. When you get inside and start to explore the exhibits, there are several steps and stairs and it was hard to move from one room to the next without having to go through a maze to find a way in. Some areas we weren't able to access Bc we didn't know how to get in due to the stairs issue. Another thing I found annoying was the noisy glass elevators that kept opening to the floor that was not even accessible (3rd floor). It was quite cramped as well. We finally found the huge elevator, but that was towards the end of our visit. The map that they give you is annoyingly confusing! I can not decipher that thing if my life depended on it. Good lord how do I get to this area?? Lol sigh it might just be my inability to read maps, I dunno. It ain't the easiest map I've come across that's for sure.There's 2 cafes here, I think, I've only seen one and it's crazy busy! Good luck trying to get something quick to eat Bc there are so many ppl in line. Restrooms are packed, too, especially for the women. Sigh. If you need to go, I would suggest finding a restroom away from the front entrance area of the Egyptian exhibit. Overall, this museum is pretty and interesting so I would probably come back. The only issue is that hubby and I are burnt out from museums (ahem DC Smithsonian museums) so we probably won't be back for a while. It's crazy busy with tons of people from all over visiting.

This review would have to be a true novel to give this place any justice. Therefore, I am focusing on my latest visit this summer. Talk about the perfect lady date!!! Where do I start, it was a perfect summer day. And my friend and I are both total fashion and art nerds. When she suggested the MET I was definitely in! I took a cab from work because I had some deadline that could not be ignored. She explained her fountain location perfectly. I spotted her and we went in for a fashion adventure. There was a China fashion exhibition called ""China: Through the Looking Glass"" (ended Sept. 7, 2015) that showed China's influence on the Western fashion world from Gaultier to Dior. My friend paid our entrances and at ""pay what you will"" prices, the price was right. We then were pointed in the right direction for fashion. The MET is a maze so you have to stay focused. Right away I was blown away by the set up. There was a sea of gorgeously crafted dresses. I went into one room and one of my favorite movies was playing Kar Wai Wong's ""In the Mood for Love"". This film is epic and the wardrobe is jaw dropping. It's a modern film that displays the old film noir aesthetic and style. I love it! My friend and I went to every room that was styled to reflect all the different fashions. One room was to appear like you were outside and had a giant Chinese style pond with a glowing moon that was seen reflected into the pond. It was stunning. And to wrap up the date at the museum we went to the roof top. You heard me right. the rooftop!! the day was perfect and it was just when the sun was saying it's farewell and the moon was coming out for it's time to shine. The views from the roof was stunning. We both got glasses of rose and made our way to a spot that overlooked Central Park. I couldn't believe I had never been to the rooftop at the MET ever before.

My friend is a potter in New York so he was an awesome guide and infinite pool of knowledge on ancient pottery, techniques, regions, etc. he knew it all, making it interstly interesting.The place is massive and can facilitate a rather sizable amount of people without it feeling too crowded (its NYC, everywhere is crowded). The donation getting into the museum is only a suggested one, so for you ballers who don't look at price tags, this does not apply to you.The armor room is one we missed but was the entire talk of my group's 'you-must-see' conversation.

From modern art to Ancient Greek sculptures, the metropolitan contains everything and  the exposition is itself a piece of art. The best part for me was the modern art section. I'm quite naive abou that so I loved the detailed comments of each piece. Moreover, the ticket price it's up to you. For a student it's suggested the price of 12$, but if you mind it's possible to pay less or nothing.

5.0,11/2/2015,"I could live here!!... and preferably in the Cubiculum Nocturum (who doesn't want to set up shop in a perfectly preserved 2000 yr old Roman bedroom??)The Met holds one of the most complete & all-encompassing collections of any museum in the world. From the Grecian sculpture hall to classic Monet impressionist pieces, or from Neolithic Mesopotamian pottery to 13th century Chinese jade, you'll be hard-pressed to not be totally mind-blown with every turning corner of this place.Situated on a plot the size of four city blocks on the rim of Central Park, the Met Museum is truly the crown jewel of Manhattan. In my opinion, if you haven't spent at least one day exploring the Met, you frankly haven't seen New York. It's essentially free to enter (donations strongly suggested though) so no excuses - get yourself to this place!**TIP** Visit in the warmer months & take a trip up to the rooftop - spectacular views of the city skyline & Central Park are waiting.**TIP FOR THE TIME-CRUNCH** Only have an hour to spare?

5.0,11/2/2015,"Let me start by saying I've had the privilege to visit some of the best museums in the world - The Louvre, The Prado, El Reina Sofia, The British Museum, etc. and the MET is by far my favorite.  The museum is massive and there is simply no way to see it all in one day.  The exhibits are expertly crafted and maze-like with a ton of information at every corner.  I have now been twice and have seen less than half the museum. The Ancient Egyptian exhibits are my favorite and the Met has a ton of artifacts from all over Egypt and from various dynasties.  There is a bit of all kinds of art for you to enjoy - paintings, statues, sarcophagi, artifacts from tombs, etc.  Anyone can find something they like here.The lighting is also fantastically designed to highlight the art in a way that makes it even more marvelous.  Each exhibit really tries to capture the spirit of the era in which the art was made and you feel as though you are truly traveling the globe as well as through history as you walk through here. It is truly an indescribable feeling.  My only complaint is that it is a bit hard to navigate and I feel like I easily miss parts of exhibits because I can't figure out where they were.  I suppose this is to make it less of a straight walk through and encourage you to spend more time on the things you truly enjoy but it was a little frustrating for me.  I love the pay as much as you want policy, and that they advertise that on the way in. In my opinion it is well worth the suggested donation!",1,0,1,Rachel W.,"New York, NY",64,104,14

The museum is literally walking distance to Central Park. You could probably have a picnic in the park and reenter the museum afterwards!

In comparison, I definitely prefer this over the Louvre which 1) doesn't have English (yea I know it's Paris, but how can the most famous museum in the world not have English?) and 2) doesn't have the friendliest staff. If you've been to the British Museum, you will quickly notice that the Egyptian collection at the Met is unfortunately not nearly as impressive.

I spent a whole day in just the Egyptian and Greek rooms and saw a tiny bit of the other rooms on the bottom while looking for my fiance Brian P.This place is a madhouse. I wish there was a cap on visitors so that it was more enjoyable. I absolutely loathe people who visit places that they don't appreciate just to tick them off some travel list. This goes for the girl I saw running from exhibit to exhibit taking selfies with art but not even looking at it or reading any placard! GTFO! This also goes for the  woman who let her kid climb on a statue of a lion and a docent rightly freaked the eff out. Seriously, DIAF!If you're not a jackass who doesn't care or appreciate art or history, buy the $7 audio tour. I can't recommend it enough. I would have loved to go on some of the docent led tours that I overheard, but I just didn't have enough time. There is SO much to see here. Brian and I split up for the day so that we could each see whatever we were most interested in. I could spend a whole week here alone. Just incredible.My only complaint is that some of the volunteers aren't very knowledgeable about where things are such as the cafeteria or how to get to a certain exhibit. I asked one volunteer if one of the rooms (Victorian house) was real or reproduction and he didn't know.

5.0,10/4/2015,"Words cannot describe the very best in art in NYC!  The best part is you get the whole museum for a $25.00 admission. On the day of my visit, I arrived 20 minutes early and saw 2 massive lines all the way down the steps waiting for it to open. On Fridays and Saturdays they have extended hours.Once it opens you go through a quick security check and you are in the ""Great Hall."" You are permitted to bring bottled water only into the galleries. Large items must be ""checked"".I would advise anyone visiting to prepurchase their ticket online because the lines are enormous! Once you decide which section you want to visit, they give you a day sticker to wear along with your receipt in the event of loss.Each section has many galleries so it is very easy to get lost here without a map. Since this was a ""highlight"" visit for me, I knew what I wanted to see and stuck to it. In the Egyptian wing there is a replica of the inside of a burial tomb and explanations of what is used in the burial process. I really wanted to see the Temple of Dendur and when I arrived I was blown away by the beauty of it along with a gigantic pool in front of it.Next, on to the American Wing to see the original painting of ""Washington crossing the Delaware"". This painting is one of the largest I had ever seen and they built a special frame to go around it. In the same area there were paintings of Washington which resembled what I had seen on one of my trips to the nation's capitol. These paintings were by Gilbert Stuart and I learned one of them was an original and the other was an original in a ""sense"" since it had variations to the other one I had seen in DC. From there I visited a few other galleries and was equally impressed that even the American Wing cafe had a great atrium area which a facade and sculpture. They had a special exhibition on the Congo so I went to view that. It was incredible!  I then stopped at their main gift store to buy gifts for friends and as I was leaving the lines to get in had tripled!To really visit this museum you must allow at least one if not two full days. Every type of art imaginable is here ranging from Asian, European,Medieval,Greek and Roman, and arms and armor to name a few.It is one of the best deals when visiting a New York museum.

5.0,9/5/2015,"Obviously one of the best museums in the world. Also one of the world's largest. How do you take advantage in a mere day?Pay whatever you want. Do a tour. I know what you'll probably say--Monica, we don't have that kind of cash money! To that I say don't worry, I've got your back as long as you read on...Museum admission is a set recommended price; however, this is only a recommendation and it truly does not bother the museum if you choose to pay a dollar entrance fee (trust me, I've tested it out for you many times). Second, the museum has two types of tours--the self-guided and the guided ""highlights"" one.  You might think that the self-guided will be cheaper....you'll be wrong (which in my opinion is a great surprise)! The self-guided tour offers a cool little iPhone like guide that lets you input the exhibit number to learn more about it. The great thing about this is that you can go wherever and always have information behind every piece. However, the highlights tour is the economically-friendly way to go. It's free and the guides aren't just retirees. They've been through training and a rigorous application process. Take advantage. TL; DR? Museum is a recommended price (aka yes pay what you want)...and grab a free highlights tour that won't break your wallet and give you tons of cool new info!",1,0,0,Monica R.,"New York, NY",188,77,174

5.0,8/29/2015,"After having my Madmanccino, I mulled the idea of going to a museum. Surprisingly, in my twenty five years of existence in the Garden State next door, I had never gone to a museum in NYC. Today would be the day. However, I had originally selected the Guggenheim. The architecture of the building, as well as a cinema exhibition they had going on, had intrigued me.I left the cafe I had been lounging in and head towards the Penn Station subway entrance on 34th and 9th. As I awaited the C train, a woman approached me asking which train would take her to the Met. I decided to call an audible and told her I'd accompany her since that's where I was going. Yes I lied, as she was very pretty. Me and my newly-acquired friend Shannon, crossed Central Park and arrived at the Met. As we walked in, a couple handed us two free tickets as they were leaving. ""Awesome, we saved $50!"" I thought, until I realized the tickets were valued at $1. Turns out the $25 price they have listed online is merely a recommended donation.Obviously I'm not gonna claim to be an art connoisseur, I mean this was gonna be the 3rd museum I was about to walk into in my life. With that disclaimer out the way, here are my impressions: The museum is huge! You could probably spend the whole day exploring every inch of it, and even if you did, you probably wouldn't have been able to spend enough time admiring each piece of art. They have artwork from all around the world, organized by time period and region. The galleries are beautifully crafted and the pieces they house are remarkable. Like every museum, they have new exhibitions every so often. The day I visited, I felt lucky to have been able to view a Vincent van Gogh exhibition. It was here that I saw the painting that made the greatest impression on me. ""Roses"", a painting with so much emotion I could feel it.",0,0,0,Edgar V.,"Paterson, NJ",142,152,112

And don't miss the Impressionist collection- supposedly it's the largest outside Paris. I studied art in college and one of my history professors was a researcher here so our classes were frequently at the Met.

5.0,8/23/2015,"Where is the 10+  stars on Yelp, this place has earned it. Before walking in, I felt that I didn't have to write a review,  but the experience was so empowering that I had to.  I have an artistic son like me, but I only took my non artistic son who is into technology with me. At first he seemed bored, like he was just there to make me happy, within 30 minutes, he got engaged and interested in the arts, went some places to see by himself and took some great pics of the arts and started to use gif and writing funny  comments of what the art was saying,  he showed me and I lol so  loud that the attendant asked us to be quiet. I felt so happy that he was able to make the art connection.  It was the first time I expended 5 plus hours in a museum, the visual was so over stimulating and so high that I had to take a nap when I came home. I saw more than what I expected,  the arts on the second floor speak so loud for itself. I saw Messages, Plots, Nature, Sex, Desires,   Religion,  all mixed in all of the canvases.  It made me feel great and like I was home. Seeing all these arts together was like meeting great friends from back in those years 1500's and so on. The art spoke for itself,  the messages on the arts are everlasting for generations to come. This museum is an endless sea of art where you don't really know if you are going to be able to see it all, because there is so much to see. I wonder how many visits I need to see it all. This is definitely the one spot everyone in the world must see. The magnetism of this museum is overwhelming. It felt like this is the center of the world for me.  In some of the paintings I was able to transport myself back in that time or that specific place, I could smell the air of the place I was visually seeing. The  arts brought back memories of the some places I visited in the DR. Some arts pieces can be looked for hours, because I wanted to know what was the artist saying,  why theres a specific number of birds in the canvas, hidden messages, and why there were some object in some places, and why theres a rope here, and why things are placed in some ways. Extremely interesting.  As an artist I truly learned today to let go and just go with the flow of the brush and let it be. So many times, I had held back and stopped   from painting something out of fear of being misinterpreted,  that fear is gone.  Some of the paintings of people are so intense that it feels like they are more alive than some of the people I meet in real life.  I learned with this visit that through Art we are all connected,  the past, the present,  the future.  Art is a multi dimensional channel of communication. Arts is Divine, Life is Art, Art is life. With a simple brush stroke on a canvas, worlds and dimensions come together and flow in an eternal present state of being Alive.",2,0,1,Aura B.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",217,561,6535
5.0,8/23/2015,"I was very impressed by this museum. They have virtually everything covered from ancient Egypt all the way to today. I find most art museums have WAY too many paintings of the crucifixion or the virgin with child. Fortunately this museum limits it to about 4-6 rooms.My favorite artists are Jan Brueghel the Elder and Peter Paul Rubens. I was disappointed they only had one Brueghel, but their collection of Rubens was wonderful. I'm also a fan of Impressionists, so I enjoyed Monet, Sisley and others.The admission is listed as $25 for adults, but when I got there they said you pay what you want to pay.

5.0,8/19/2015,"I visited The Met expecting it to be a poor mans British Museum. I ended up being pleasantly surprised by the collection of art & artifacts they have. I arrived at the museum about 15 minutes after opening, so I had no lines to wait in for tickets. The museum runs off donations. It's pay what you want, but the recommended price of admission is $25. The young man working assured me that they would accept any donation. I was so impressed that they didn't pressure me to pay full price, that I paid the full $25! I entered at the Egyptian Art wing and having been to the British Museum I was a bit unimpressed with their collection. Getting further into the wing you find the sarcophaguses which was the highlight. Next I went to the American Wing and there was nobody there. It's a shame because there is some really neat artwork and full recreations of period rooms. With the Greek and Roman Art, again it was just kinda ""Meh"". Not fantastic if you've seen similar art before. I really loved the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas part of the museum. So many cool and unusual artifacts to see. It was getting towards the end of the day and I had to rush through the Medieval Arts, Modern Art, Musical Instruments.There are museum workers everywhere, so if you're like me and get lost even with a map, there is always someone nearby to help. I did encounter one really rude employee. I asked how to get to one wing, and he replied in a nasty tone ""You're in it."" There is a small cafe in the American Wing where you can get drinks or snacks, the larger cafeteria is on the very bottom floor. It is large, but really overpriced. I saw the prices and hightailed my butt right on out of there.If you want to be able to take your time and see everything, plan on two days here.

This place is massive and filled with great pieces of art. Love hearing all the different languages spoken by all those inside the museum travelling to see this beautiful museum. Once spring time rolls around and into summer and fall, the rooftop opens up with lush views of Central Park, and expensive, but strong martinis. 25 USD is the suggested donation, but it is up to you to give 1 or 100. make sure you plan your visit well because there is so much to see.

Well there are a number of options - there is a cafeteria here where you can grab a decent, if not slightly expensive bite to eat.  They have a sushi station, grilling station, salad station etc.  There are a few other restaurants (2 I believe are for MET members only).  If you just want to quench your thirst, just head up to the 5th floor and go outside to their Martini bar.  Great views of the city!  A great way to soak up dome NYC culture!",3,0,2,Faiza K.,"Toronto, Canada",209,914,868

I was very impressed by the Egyptian artifacts exhibit I feel as if I had more time I would have taken a guided tour but I was a little doubtful just because I thought it was busy.

Went there earlier this week in my vacation and did not regret it. the art exhibits were simply wonderful to look at and I enjoyed most of the art.They had arts from around the world from all different periods in time. Went there when they had the Chinese art fashion special exhibit and it was actually pretty fun to look at. The best exhibit I experienced was a room that reflected the ceiling and made it look like the floor was water with the moon reflecting on the so called water's surface. Simply beautiful!Would definitely come to this museum again!!,0,0,0,Jonathan K.,"Walnut, CA",4,17,13
5.0,7/12/2015,"I went to MET on a Tuesday and there was a lot of people, the outside of the museum is so beautiful and when I went inside and greeted with the pyramid I was beyond excited. That day was super crowded, the whole lobby was filled with people and some tourists came in groups. All of the exhibits are amazing and an eye opener, especially the medieval section. I love medieval and seeing the knights is a dream come true for me. I didn't know they have an exhibit for China through a looking glass and when I went into that one I was amazed. THIS PLACE IS HUGE! And had a lot of collection of all different kind of history, as a big history GEEK I was happy I was like a child in a candy store looking around everywhere. This has been an amazing experience for me. I LOVE THIS PLACE!",0,0,0,Jessica L.,"Flushing, NY",0,4,0

One could take an entire day to go through all the art at the MET. I am a big fan of impressionist, pop, Asian art -and was pleased with the collection and experience.

This time I was here for the China: Through the Looking Glass. It was out of this world! The Qi Pao (traditional Chinese dresses) were just soooooooooo beautiful. I was there for a long time staring at each dress and even reading the descriptions and watching the themed clips. Everything was so Chinese and elegant and beautiful. Took my breath away.

5.0,7/1/2015,"New York City is filled with culture, architecture and art housed in a wide variety of museums.  For me, the Met has always been my standard, go-to, never boring, always exciting museum of choice. My family has visited the Met for a long time.  My uncle frequented the museum all his 80 years of living down here and as most depression era men, would give a few coins from his pocket as suggested donation to escape into a different world for a few hours. From school trips to family exploration, I have had the time to appreciate all of the wings. Of course as a child, my heart lived in the Egyptian and Roman wings. What child isn't intrigued by myth and lore and sarcophagus?  What do you mean there is a dead body in there? Iew they used those jars for what? As I aged and relocated to the city, I found myself wandering aimlessly through the halls. Sure I will always visit Van Gogh.  I cannot avoid that inevitable. After a second grade project, he has been my favorite artist. I am thrilled that my city houses so many of his works.  But after that visit, I was off to find a room I had never entered or a wing that I might not find interesting but once there is enthralling. I have gladly been a member for the past two years and recently had the immense pleasure of a guided tour through the #EmptyMet (check out the tag on IG). I am grateful to have the Met and other amazing museums to visit in NYC.  There is nothing like spending a random evening or weekend morning wandering the cool halls to find a reprieve from the busy city outside and experience life through others eyes.  Like many of the city museums, the $25 price listed is the ""suggested donation"".  You technically could walk in for a nickle if you were so inclined. Just make sure to grab the ticket for your sticker and display it proudly on your clothes. I miss the old metal tags they use to have. It makes me sad that I didn't have every single one saved but 20/20 hindsight. Seeing as how this is the largest footprint of a building in NYC, you may need a map to navigate through the wings if you intend to find specific artists or genres of art.  They constantly have rotating exhibits so if you see something that interests you, go. If you aren't interested, just wait a few month and it will be replaced by another.  No matter if you are enjoying the museum for the full day or just an hour or two, you can always find something pleasing to the eye. Get your comfy shoes on and get going.",2,1,3,Erin P.,"Brooklyn, NY",340,314,1082

5.0,6/20/2015,"What an amazing museum. I went here today for a few hours, and only saw two exhibits: the one that covered ancient Egypt, and ""China: Through the Looking Glass."" The ancient Egypt one was quite amazing; my favorite part was the large room with a wall of glass, which was reflected off this beautiful pool that lay at the feet of this massive tomb. Such an amazing room. But the ""China: Through the Looking Glass"" exhibit...wow. It was breathtaking. I never knew I could tear up at couture fashion, but this exhibit made me. The gowns were absolutely exquisite; the curated pieces were all from designers of great merit. My favorite pieces were the ones that had the essence of porcelain as well as Guo Pei's golden ball gown. I also loved the courtyard room, where these beautiful dresses that simulated lotus flowers were reflected off this black onyx floor, which also carried a projection of the moon. You should know that this exhibit is not meant to reflect Chinese culture necessarily, rather, it is more of a glimpse of the perception of Chinese culture and fashion through Westernized interpretation. That is why there are so many Western designers, allusions to Western films about Cathay, and parallels to Western trends. I only did those two exhibits because I was so exhausted by the end of it, but I definitely plan on coming back and finishing the rest of the museum. Simply marvelous.",1,1,2,Katherine Z.,"Washington, DC",561,473,556
5.0,6/19/2015,"I'd chastise anyone that gives this institution less than five stars. I have been to the Met innumerable times in my 30 years. One of my aunts lives down the street, so she used to take me here to see the Christmas trees at a young child when I'd visit the city during the holidays. In high school, we'd take many field trips for my history and art classes; April 2000, my sophomore year, will forever remain a memorable field trip when another visiting high school decided to put soap in the northern fountain in the plaza, causing a bubbly mess. Each year in college, I was afforded a free trip to the Met because my college's main art history teacher loved me and appreciated us few students working towards art history minors. (Benefits. Ha!) However, each time I've gone, it's been with wonder and excitement, as I'm always able to find something new I hadn't seen previously. Conversely, each time I go, I get this wave of childhood nostalgia as I re-enter the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas collection room, the large decorative ceiling looming overhead. Recently, I was afforded an amazing opportunity to take part in an Empty Met tour; starting at 8:30 a.m. until it's opened to the public at 10, a couple dozen patrons got a quick yet through and personalized tour of the museum, and I learned some great facts about pieces of art that I had merely only admired in the past. I got a true history of many pieces I was unaware of; one piece in the Civil War collection was a model of Abraham Lincoln's face and his hand holding a model of the Emancipation Proclamation. We learned the story of how his hand was swollen from shaking so many hands at public events, and he wanted to rest it in order to have a strong signature on the proclamation; he was worried his hand would be too swollen to write a strong signature, as he didn't want a shaky-looking one, denoting his feelings towards signing the document weren't strong. (The history buff in me loved this!) I must give a shout-out to Chris Gorman and Rachel Ferrante for giving us the Empty Met tour. They were wonderful and knowledgeable! Here's too many more enriching and entrancing Met visits in my future. And, one day, I'll finally make it up to the roof, I hope!",3,1,3,Allison C.,"New York, NY",215,1638,450

5.0,6/17/2015,"Just another 5 star review to add to the lot! This is one of the busiest museums in NYC.  There is always large crowds in the main lobby.  Admission is by donation, so $1 a person is okay. I visit the museum once every couple of months to see new installations. Sometimes you will have to wait 1+ hour for an installation (Alexander McQueen exhibit from a couple years ago).  You should give yourself enough time and not rush/run through the museum.  There are a thousand of years of history on display! I always stop by the Asian wing and the Egyptians wing.  Fyi, the museum stopped giving out the metal tags as admission confirmation. You now have to wear a sticker on your shirt as confirmation that you paid admission.",0,1,0,Ping F.,"Manhattan, NY",112,240,1484

My favourite part was the Dutch and Italian Renaissance, but there is truly something to fall in love with for all kinds of tastes. More into history? Delve into the wonders of Syrian, Egyptian, Greek, Roman or precolombian history and be amazed by the richness of these cultures. Fancy a tour de force of the best of European painting go to the second floor and emerge yourself in the light, the colours, the compositions and the evolution of art. Four hours wasn't nearly enough. I could spend months in there and still discover new pieces!

This is certainly the best museum I've ever seen, from the elaborate architecture to the varied collections to the beautiful rooftop view of the New York City skyline. The ancient Roman collections, Egyptian exhibit, and Asian art exhibits were by far my favorites; there were sculptures and pieces in each of those exhibits dating back nearly 4000 years! The descriptions of each of the pieces were also quite detailed and taught me a lot about history that I never truly learned in school. There are so many exhibits and galleries in the Met that it gets overwhelming - a good tip is to plan out your exhibits beforehand using the website map, and target those first. This is definitely at least a 1/2 day or full day visit; and even with that, you may cover about only 10-20% of the total space! The suggested admission price is $25 per adult, and $12 for students.

My second favorite was the Moon in the Water gallery (Gallery 217). A large moon is created on the ceiling with 100s of TV screens. Reflecting the moon is a lake of mirrors.

Art from all over the world and many different eras: Asian, Roman, French Impressionists, American, African, Ancient Egyptian, Near Eastern, Latin...  I can go on and on.  Perhaps the the weakest collections are modern works, but they are still wonderful.Today I saw ""China Through the Looking Glass.""  For this exhibit, they placed modern pieces (clothing) along with the art already in the Chinese galleries.  I had walked though the Chinese galleries countless times, but today I didn't recognize them!!  I'm not saying that as a criticism.  I love how they designed this exhibit.One of my favorite places is the Temple of Dendur in the Egyptian section.  I also love the French Impressionists.The museum is very large.  You could spend an entire day there.  You can also very easily get lost, but, believe me, getting lost would never feel so wonderful!",0,0,0,Joe L.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",152,368,1027

Everything is organized neatly and symmetrically. Everything is taken care of with utter diligence. There is a department for everything, even for lighting. This is my favorite place in the world. Go up the grand stairs. Make sure to don't miss out on the Egyptian and Roman wings. Look at the wonderful Van Gogh paintings; they are thoughtfully placed with the Gauguin ones. Enjoy the Picassos and the Monets too. Don't ignore the period rooms. make sure to visit the American Wing, but don't ignore the Tiffany fountain or the Tiffany Arches. Take it all in, there's something for everybody. It is a public museum for those who didn't know, you can request to see a piece of art they have in storage and they will show it to you. It is also suggested donation put always add a buck or two from what you were initially planning to give it takes a lot to keep such an institution running. Have you ever seen a Da Vinci sketch, up close? The museum will be open late until 9 (they say) on Friday and Saturday, but they will start closing the galleries and guiding people out earlier, so let's call it 8:40ish.

Yes, I was wrong since it is not allowed, but it did not shatter and no one died. Moments later the security yelled out that we couldn't touch it and I was like ""ok"" and continued to observe the work. I didn't think it was a big deal because I was actually busy discussing the actual art itself, I really don't think I did anything significant. While talking to my friend about it we were rudely interrupted by the security who aggressively came between my friend and I. He stood there and told me I couldn't do that and I'm like ok so we just stood there expecting him to walk away but than he starts waving his arms and getting really close and yelling like I am retarded. I don't know if he expected a response or whatever but I didn't really want to have any dialogue with him, I didn't find that it was necessary. So I looked over to my friend like is this really happening? I was completely shocked at such a lack of professionalism, and quite frankly immaturity. He continued to yell and I had to walk away because that is a situation that I do not like to be in. The discomfort was so severe it completely took away from enjoying the artwork. The worst part is he kept talking to me like I didn't speak english and asking my friend to translate when I was just speaking fluent English (DUH, I'm a New Yorker!) moments before he rudely intruded into the conversation, mind you he was the one with the accent.

What's the best part of this museum? It's free! Well, not really. Their suggested donation is $25. If you're a tourist coming here for the first time, it's a good idea to donate the suggested amount (or more). The sheer number of stuff in this museum makes it worth it. Heck, I think they could actually charge $25, and it would be fine. They have a ton of sections with art from all corners of the Earth. It will take a few days to thoroughly go through each section. We spent a whole day there, and we didn't come close to seeing everything.They also provide free tours. I at least recommend the highlights tour. It's an 1 hour fast tour of the entire place, highlighting certain pieces of the museum. It was cool and informative. I also did the Fashion in Art tour. That was a very fun tour. The tour guide explained each art and the fashion of its time. Also, she gave tidbits and gossip of the painters and/or subjects of the artwork. It was a fun and cool tour.The only problem with the tour is the speaking volume. The tour guides don't speak very loudly. So you have to get in close to hear what they're saying. They also walk very fast. So you can't get distracted, or you'll lose them. But that's okay, they have a schedule to keep.For non-English speakers, they have tours in other languages too like Russian, Japanese, Spanish, and so on. Besides the human-guided tours, they also have audio tours available. I haven't done them, but I think they're good for each section you want to visit. The only downside to this place is their cafeteria. Their food is okay and expensive. But that's typical. You can always leave and eat at one of the many stands in front of the museum.

We wanted to see something a little more different so stuck with the exhibits that were here on tour. We saw an awesome exhibit about Burma and India and then headed over to where all of the Native American artifacts were.The Native American exhibit was probably my favorite part of the museum, as it showed original clothes, tools they used every day, etc.We then checked out the Monet and Van Gogh paintings which was incredible as both my friend and I have studied both of these artists in school. We ended our visit with The Great Wave, which was TINY compared to what I expected, but awesome nonetheless.Only downfall of our trip was when we took the elevator down to the first floor. There was a star next to the G so we though that would take us to the lobby. It ended up taking us to the employees only area where we were very abruptly pushed back into the elevator (hadn't even really stepped out actually...).

5.0,3/25/2015,"Once upon a time, I wanted to be an architect. I've taken an architecture history class. I follow architecture and design for fun, looking for innovation. One of my favorites of the earlier generations of architects is Frank Lloyd Wright. He made several innovations in his career. One was the neo-Mayan period including the Tokyo Hotel (also innovative in its earthquake resistance). He presaged ranch and suburbs in his Usonian houses. But I think his greatest accomplishment is the horizontal spaces of interlocking lines and planes in his prairie to Taliesin late period. I've only been in one other Wright house, so the opportunity to experience the Wright space in the Met is always a pleasure. It is calming.The Met is more than a day experience to see it all.

Makes you think the world isn't entirely run by D-bags.I used to hate coming here. I actually used to hate the idea of learning on my own time, to realize, learning is the shit. To be honest, I still don't really learn anything here. It's a fun place to walk around and look at all the pretty stuff, kind of like interactive daydreaming. There's a field trip quality to it when you're with your dawgs that makes you want to be as obnoxious as you used to be when you were 7, running around touching things that say ""don't touch"".For only a ""donation fee"", you start to wonder how this place is even running... until you pay $12 for a sandwich.

5.0,3/2/2015,"This place is at the same moment exquisitely religious and the most painful sacrilege.  The art is too powerful.  Too personal to be shared with thoughtless tourists who see the world through the screen of a smartphone, with sticky children in strollers bribed by sweets-toting nannies charged with the culturization of the unwilling, with the throngs of unseeing eyes.  A museum experience different from any that I have ever known, the museum is ALIVE.  Truly, the most beautifully complicated being I've ever encountered.  Each wing, each room, each hallway is a twirl in the brain of a breathtaking mind.  The architecture of each collection space is the canvas upon which the art is displayed--no detail is overlooked.  The ceilings and walls echo and magnify the emotional response the pieces elicit with thoughtful paint colors, intuitive design and seamless integration of earth and idea.  The only installation in the world that I've seen that compares to the lighting brilliance of The Met is David in the Galleria D'Ell Academia in Florence--though I could be doing the lighting and technical team of The Met a disservice since David lights himself.   I visited for the first time on a Saturday morning--a frigid winter day when there was a special celebration of the Chinese New Year.  The crowds were oppressive, but the love was still palpable.  Every guard had a knowing friendly nod and on point directions, every employee and volunteer was a dear friend of the museum and spoke of it endearingly--what to eat, where the best restrooms were, which wings would be less crowded today....Of the museum itself and the staff, I can offer no censure.  Of the New Yorkers themselves hiding out a cold day with old friends on canvas and carved in marble, the same.  But for the brainless masses who lack the capacity to see that the gravity of art can only be seen with your eyes and not through your phone, well, I think that admission should be doubled.  If you can't see the art with your soul, only with a camera, my sincere hope is that when you stumble into the European sculpture gallery taking giggly penis selfies, Ugolino finishes his children in time to devour you.",0,1,0,Pam E.,"Sparks, NV",27,19,5
4.0,3/1/2015,"Beautiful museum. Paid $1 for entry. NOTE:  the price noted on the boards once you arrive is a ""recommended fee"", you can pay as much or as little as you like. It's more like a donation. You are given a sticker, which is what allows the staff to know that you can gain entry (they should change this to something less likely to fall off, stickers don't work well on wet coats or most clothing). Walked around for about 2 hours and got to see famous paintings, amongst many other things (sculptures, antique items, etc). I just say, I came across a few staff members who did a half way smiles---but none were welcoming or helpful, while the rest, seemed to be on edge and even saw two of them shout at people things that they could have very well walked over and said without ridiculing anyone. Example: One man was talking to another in proximity to a painting , ""guard"" thought these two people were too close. Guard shouted across the room ""stop!!! Stop breathing on the painting"". Seriously? They weren't THAT close. Totally uncalled for.All in all, place is clean, well kept, and is home to a lot of history. I will return to finish up, there really is a lot to see.

5.0,2/25/2015,"This museum is a really cool place! It's huge so it can be very easy to get lost and each little nook and cranie has little gems. One of the most impressive things about this place is that everything is original, no reproductions. This fact is especially impressive when you consider that there's a couple Egyptian temples(in part) that were transported into the locations they are now. I'm also impressed by the range of artifacts they have.  The range of periods that the art comes from and the varieties are amazing. Even if you have no idea what you're looking at, which is the case with most visitors, you can't help but be in awe.The store is wonderful as well. Overpriced but what do you expect at a museum? There is ,however, a clearance store tucked away at the bottom of a staircase that's in a little corner in front of the bathrooms in 'Egypt' that doesn't hurt your wallet nearly as much. I was able to buy cute artistic things for each of my family members for less than $40. The cafeteria is crazy expensive and more of the food isn't great(again, what do you expect?).

It blew my mind and imagination.Next the Madame Cèzanne exhibit of all 29 portraits of Cézanne's wife Hortance. It was captivating.Lastly, the 3 WB Turner paintings the Met exhibits.

5.0,2/23/2015,I could live in this museum for a week and still not see everything. -Hands down the best museum in NYC. -Each wing is dedicated to a specific period of art-The Egyptian wing is terribly faciniating even if it at times feels culturally insensitive to have such a huge collection in NY. (I also wish they'd move the obelisk out of central park so that it stops deteriorating but that's not the museums fault) -I could live in the European paintings wing. I've sought out impressionists paintings around the world and I think The Met has the most impressive collection. -The American wing could be terribly boring but the way they staged it is fascinating - complete with a little house to walk through.-There is still modern art - way better than MOMA-Greek and roman art / sculptures -Costume wing is fierce-Constantly changing exhibitions that are usually amazing (especially the costumes)Go!

5.0,2/21/2015,"As most people before me have said (if not all people), this is a MUST SEE place in the city. The museum is huge and you can easily spend 2-3 full days to see everything on site. There are lots of artifacts, real-live tombs from Egypt, and colossal coliseums from Greece. You can take pictures, get super close to the artifacts, and literally feel as if you landed in that respective country when you see yourself surrounded by an entire exhibit dedicated to the region. it is worth every penny that you pay so please try and pay as much as you can to support the museum. When I went, I was not hassled for not being able to pay full price (I did't think it was that big and arrived about an hour before closing time), but unfortunately, one of my friends was hassled by a rude employee who refused to give her a ticket unless she paid full price which is extremely disappointing to limit such a vast amount of history and culture to the less fortunate.( I REALLY hope not all employees behave as crudely as this man!)Besides that one mishap, it is by far the best museum I've visited. There are TONS of exhibitions. I went to Egypt, Greece, and saw a few pieces of work by Romanian sculptor Brancusi and it was completely worth it. The immensity of this museum is unreal unless you go see for yourself --- so go!!

5.0,2/18/2015,"Visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art is pure pleasure. It's without a question the greatest art museum I've ever been to (and yes, I've been to Louvre). For a few hours you can lose yourself to the beauty of art and history and you won't regret a single minute. The museum is lovely from the outside, build in a Beaux-Arts style with elegant colonnades and floral sculptures. A photo on the stairs is a must if you've ever watched Gossip Girl :D. It's simply enormous, so if you plan to be really thorough with the viewing expect to spend a few hours there. You can choose from a dozen or so thematic wings, my favourite being The American Wing, Islamic Art, European Paintings and Greek and Roman Art. A plan in which order you want to visit them is a good idea, otherwise it's easy to get lost. You can hang your coat in a large, free coat-check room near the entrance and walk around in comfortable clothes. Also, it's allowed to take pictures anywhere in the museum. There is no entrance fee, however a donation is suggested. You can pay as much as you want (or as much as you can).I went totally wild in paintings sections.

5.0,2/15/2015,"There's a reason the MET is one of the most renowned museums in the entire world. This place is a mecca of history, art, and beauty from every continent, era, and everything in between. Getting lost here is probably the greatest thing that could ever happen to someone, and when I visit, that's precisely my goal.I usually start with the Ancient Egyptian room because of its vastness. You feel so small and insignificant, and that feeling is absolutely priceless. To look back on what was is such a breath-taking experience, and whether you get that feeling from epic Egyptian statues or Godzilla-sized paintings in the European art wing, the breathlessness is remarkable.The American Wing has to be my absolute favorite. I have a weakness for ornate and artistic furniture and interiors, and this wing has just that. Being able to look into these rooms from the past is such an experience. It's like you've been swept away into another era, one that's been long gone and is only recreated for the Silver Screen. To be able to experience all of that first-hand is such a joy for me. And it's a euphoria that you can only get at a place like the MET.Whether you are a tourist, a resident, a student, a parent, or a child, the MET has something that will appeal to absolutely everyone.

5.0,2/15/2015,"Continuing our NYC trip, visiting the Met was the first thing on our to-do list for the first full day in NYC. Walking in, I was amazed how large this place was, but even then, I had no idea how large some of the collections were. Being interested in all things history, first up was the Greek and Roman Art wing, which was massive and impressive to say the least. The collection of black and red figure vases on display was extensive and much to the chagrin of my tolerant fiancee, I was implored to stop and look at each (I developed a fascination with them after reading The Lost Chalice by Vernon Silver). As can be assumed, they have plenty of variants that spanned various ages and a few that had white figures (represented as statues on the portrayal) which I had yet to see before. However, probably my favorite part of this wing were the sets of Greek and Etruscan Armor they had on display, including several collections of Hoplite gear, down to the very greaves. Also prevalent in this wing are many fine examples of Corinthian style helmets worth viewing. Finally, if you are interested in ancient coins, they are sprinkled about the exhibit and the complete Etruscan chariot is also a must-see before leaving. Sadly, we spent so much time in the Greek and Roman exhibit that we had to make some tough choices on where to go next. I think what I viewed in the Greek and Roman exhibit was much more extensive than anything I saw in Greece and definitely rivals that of the British Museum as well. Our next stop was the Egyptian Exhibit, where I was amazed at several intact Egyptian Books of the Dead displayed on the walls, followed by what it seemed like numerous colonnades of mummies. The Egyptian Temple is also worth a view. The next stop was viewing the Arms and Armor exhibit, which had many great suits of armor from the 15th and 16th centuries (they had several dog-faced visors from the late 14th century) including two from Henry VIII, one from early on in his life and one suit made towards the end and you could definitely tell a difference in size between the two sets (dude gained some major weight).Finally, we made a mad jaunt towards the exhibit displaying relics from the Middle East/Turkey/Iran where we found some amazing (and amazingly large) and well preserved Persian carpets along with several cool items such as a 12th century chess set and some well preserved metalwork. So essentially, we ran out of time. The place is massive and plan accordingly. I think if you are travelers like us, just plan on hitting up The Met each trip to NYC and go visit another wing as it is there are too many great items to skip over and really too massive to do in one trip.

For those thirsty to learn, you will leave more than satisfied. The Egypt exhibit is particularly stunning. There's a lot to read and there's mega walking, but there are so many areas to explore. During Christmas time, the Christian wing plays Gregorian chants and has a giant Christmas tree on display. Part of the Egyptian wing incorporates walls directly from Egypt, and a large pond in the center with Egyptian plants and figurines. You feel like you're in Egypt while standing in the room. In other parts of the museum, the stained glass is breathtaking, and a few of the workers were informative and more than willing to explain exhibits to us. The Renaissance paintings were simply incredible. The amount of detail put into the exhibits is worth the hours and hours it would take you to soak up all the information and see everything the Met has to offer. Pictures are allowed in certain portions of the Museum. It's important you locate bathrooms and water before you begin your tour, so you know exactly where to find them when you need it.

Sure, it's a fantastic museum. For a museum I think it is pretty cool that they allow you to pay what you can. Sure, they offer anything and everything you can possibly imagine from suits of armor to abstract sculptures to Impressionist art and beyond.

2.0,1/20/2015,"We were there this past Saturday afternoon.  I have been to the museum before, and usually check my backpack but this time the line was so excessively long I thought I would just bring it with me. When I went in the guard said that I had to ""keep it on one shoulder."" While I could not figure out the logic behind this statement, I did so and moved along.I was standing in the middle of one of your rooms with paintings when one of the workers, a blonde woman with a heavier accent about 45-55 approached me and told me that I had to carry the backpack or put it on in front of me. I got the sense that she enjoyed exerting her ""authority"" on patrons who were just there observing art. I told her that the other guard said that I had to carry it on one shoulder. She scoffed at me and said ""uh, no he didn't."" My 12 year old daughters mouth dropped at this complete stranger who was accusing me of lying - over a backpack. I responded that ""yes, he did in fact say that,"" and she ignored me and turned to my daughter and said ""oh, are you having fun!?"" My daughter and I both stood there, aghast, that stranger A. Approached us with no exhibits around us that we could bump into with this backpack (therefore she was just looking for someone to harass in my opinion )B. Accused me of lying and then C. Thought it appropriate to strike up a conversation with my child.Either adopt a ""no backpack"" policy, and put some signs up so people don't think the guards are making this up as they go - OR - make the lines more efficient so I would not have run into this - OR - teach your employees basic communication skills. Calling patrons liars in front of their children is unacceptable.The museum itself has a wonderful collection of art and artifacts, just some not very well trained employees on power trips tend to ruin the experience unnecessarily.",2,1,0,Elise D.,"West Hartford, CT",7,148,58

The food was crappy and double priced (seriously). You will be disappointed. I spent $15 for a small coffee and a very small spinach salad and a couple spoonfuls of tuna salad (LOL), the coffee was bland and the food was bland.If you have a car, I recommend finding parking near a t station or bus that will take you there. Parking nearby is expensive, and it took us nearly 20 minutes finding street parking before giving up. Or just take public transportation in.Other then that, this museum is wonderful, and HUGE. If you don't live nearby, I would say that the museum should be an all day or even a two day adventure....otherwise you'll find yourself running around trying to see everything before they close and fighting the huge crowds.There is a coat check in the basement, there are multiple lines which makes them shorter, do not go to the lobby coat check, you will be wasting your time in line.One of the best museums I've ever been to, due to sheer size and the vast and diverse array of works.

Food is expensive so arrive on a full stomach and take a granola bar with you. Wear comfortable walking shoes that can keep you on your feet for at least 4-6 hours. You can take pictures of most things but not everything. Be safe and be aware of pickpockets outside as they are looking for tourists to rob.

At least, workers were giving people that option when I was there. Fuel up at one of the many food carts outside to avoid the long line for their cafe. If you don't want to get lost for days.

From ancient Egypt, Rome, Asia to modern & contemporary art. There is a lot to see here, so if you're not from NYC, you might want to plan out what you want to see, specifically. Unlike other museums, it may take a few days to actually see everything. Yes, the Met is free, but has recommended $25. I always give a few bucks to them. Donations is how the museum is funded. Also, there are like 10 booths to get admission. Left, right and the center has booths. So during the Holiday or maybe the summer rush, choose the center lines because that seems like the shortest. From my recent visit, they don't have the admission pin thing anymore, instead it was a sticker.. But I'm not sure if it was because it was a lot of people.I think my favorite parts of the museum is the Renaissance art on the second floor. Mainly because the paintings are huge (bigger than the pictures in my art history books). It's really beautiful. And the sculptures are also very iconic. They also have nice collection of Modern Art. Like Picasso, Seurat, Matisse, etc. The only thing I haven't seen is the Cloisters Museum, maybe cause it's all the way uptown at the edge of the island.Anyway, there will be something for everyone if you like art and history.",1,1,1,Elaine W.,"Queens, NY",85,195,310

On two occasions, my girlfriend and I had trouble finding the famous wave painting but we finally were able to find it. Another highlight is the Roof Garden. You could take the elevator up near the cafe and roman statue section or you could probably take the stairs as well.

5.0,11/25/2014,"My  favorite museum in the US of A,  the Met if you have time (2 days) will reveal its genius secrets to you.  If you have a limited amount of time, say 3 hrs will give you a moderate walk throughout most of the installations and wings.   Suggest to see the entire space.   Sad I didn't have time for MOMA or the Guggenheim, but next time.The day I came, I saw the Assyrian exhibit, which of course,  was  over the top in a really good way.  For some reason, the curators at the Met manage to setup, display and document an exhibit in such a way that after you walk away, you feel like you've witnessed that  history but an awed understanding of it.  SMH.    I love coming to this museum. The National Gallery of Art in DC comes a close second in my book.  How in the frick did we manage to own these $$$$$ multimillion $$$$$ foreign collections?  No comment.Not gonna write a tome for you but simply, my favorites are the renaissance painters, some modern art and the American wing.  The Egyptian exhibit is one of the crowning exhibits here but there is something for everyone at the Met if you like art and antiquities.  Pictures are allowed of the permanent exhibit.  Took a photo of a Picasso for my holiday cards.Tip:  Entrance fee is a 'suggested' donation.   The Met is in the north end of the Central Park ""complex"".  It has breathtaking views of Central Park.  Directly across from the met, on the other side of Central Park is the Natural History Museum (also large and fascinating) is worth a peak super fun place for the kids.  If you need a cab, walk 3 lights north or south of the Met and walk 2 blocks in  b/c it's a fight to hail a cab in front of the Met.  Subway is a 5 block walk.Visits:  10+  since college",7,3,6,Will S.,"México, D.F., Mexico",967,622,5677

There's two million square feet to cover, and a suggested admission price of $25. That amounts to about 1/100,000th of a penny per square foot, and they don't even make you pay it if you decide to be an incredibly selfish cheapskate. You probably steal toilet paper from public restrooms, too, don't you? If you can pry yourself away from your coin purse for a couple of hours, perhaps you could bask in the country's largest museum and second only to the Louvre in the world. The museum is quite simply the Encyclopedia Britannica come to life.It's mind-boggling to ponder the historical significance of all the exhibits in the Great Hall, the Greek and Roman art collections, the Islamic and Asian art collections, and the European sculpture court. At the same time, the Costume Institute, the contemporary artwork and the photographs impress as well. There's even the Roof Garden which provides spectacular view of the Manhattan skyline toward Central Park East and South.

5.0,11/17/2014,"The Metropolitan Museum of Art (The MET) is considered one of the world's top museums, and for good reason. The building is so vast and the collection so extensive, it could take weeks, maybe months, to see everything. We visited for the afternoon and barely scratched the surface of what is offered. We went through the Egyptian, Roman, and Medieval sections and breezed through sculpture and American decorative arts. Highlights for me included the Temple of Dendur, the Frank Lloyd Wright room, and medieval armor collection. Heck, they even have King Henry VIII's armor.Even though this is billed as an art museum it really is equally a history museum. So many relics, mummies, musical instruments, Victorian furniture, etc. They've even imported whole sections of roman churches from Europe and temples from Egypt! The most interesting piece to me was the Choir Screen (a really really large gate) from a cathedral in Spain. Stunning!I recommend renting the headset for audio. The headset will give you an overview of each collection and the special exhibitions. It is really the next best thing to getting a guided tour.You can take pictures of most of the artwork, but you cannot use a flash. Also be mindful not to touch anything. The museum staff will be all over you if you do. There is a small cafe that is dreadfully overpriced. I recommend eating elsewhere before visiting.One final thing. The admission here is ""recommended"". Do not let the high admission cost deter you from visiting. Simply pay what you can afford.In conclusion, this is an absolutely stunning and breathtaking museum. This is a must-stop for anyone visiting New York City.

If you look at the admission prices posted carefully, you see the words ""Recommended"". So if you are short a few dollars from the recommended, you won't be turned away.

Initial walk-in, they check your bags/purses...no drinks allowed! We paid $25 at a kiosk, way easier than waiting in line! Starving -- we asked if there were any places to eat inside, and the security said there was plenty. We ate at the American Wing Cafe which had this awesome view of the Central Park, and on the other side were amazing sculptures. There were so many rooms, so many familiar pieces, walking around was exhausting. Being in the presence of the art was a wonderful feeling. Picasso's and pieces donated by the wealthy really makes The Met historical.

You can spend hours and you still won't make it through the whole museum. It has a nice but small selection of modern Art. But an incredible selection of sculptures. It's hard not to get it five stars but there are a few things that they really need to improve (1) they need to have more coffee shops or break out places to grab a quick bite and drink the Moma does a great job at this. You need caffeine if you're happy walking around the museum for hours!!  (2) The membership staff could be a lot friendlier!! The woman who signed me up looked extremely bored and was very rude. She wasn't excited at all about me purchasing membership and really gave a dry overview of the fantastic Museum. (3) The signage is really vague it's hard to figure out where anything is including the restrooms and the exit. You get trapped in there and can't find your way out it's just too massive they need better signs.With that said it's an awesome spot to spend the day looking at breathtaking art and incredible huge open spaces with breathtaking architecture and sculptures.

If you can't find anything to interest you in this place there is something seriously wrong with you. My personal favorite departments are the American Wing, Islamic Art, Medieval, Byzantine, and European Paintings. Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Asian Wing, Modern art, arms and armor, and basically everything else is top notch. Great European and American period rooms. If you have time, check out the Luce Center above the American wing- this is open storage for American objects not on exhibit, but they are stored in glass cases so you can view them anyway. The courtyard in the American wing is incredible, with entire city facades salvaged and reconstructed in a glass courtyard. The new American wing has a very interesting display scheme- everything is mounted on sliding cables that can be removed for lending, except for the monumental ""Washington Crossing the Delaware,"" which is now permanently mounted to the wall. So don't ask to borrow it. Admission is pay what you will, thank god. $25 is suggested, but that is ridiculous. Don't feel bad giving $5 or $10- let the rich folks and donors pay the full price. Just saw the new mourning attire exhibit in the costume institute- great exhibit, though smaller in scale than I was expecting. Kimonos and Assyrian exhibits are also going right now.

The art here is owned by ludicrously rich people and the entrance fees just make them richer. Ridiculous.",3,0,0,Elena P.,"New York, NY",0,1,1

The Egyptian temple is the size of a closet, an afterthought, therefore given away. For their massive $3 billion dollar endowment their admissions ticket is ridiculous.

4.0,9/19/2014,To be honest i didn't get a change to look around because i didn't have the time but it looks really nice. What did blow me away was the price to get in.

5.0,9/16/2014,"The Met surpassed any and every expectation I had.First off, my experience was set to an incredible day on the edge of Fall. After walking through Central Park I came across the enormous structure thinking it couldn't be completely housed with artwork. Was I ever wrong...The option for a three day pass is a completely viable option to completely experience the Met. After several hours the Met will exhaust you and is near impossible to completely appreciate in just a days visit.My favorite part was the modern collection, but there is so much to say about the countless exhibits and maze of incredible artwork spanning thousands of years.I'd recommend the audio tour as well. I did not purchase it (I believe it's an extra $8), but would imagine it would really give some history to certain exhibits.What an experience. Will be going back very soon!",1,2,0,Rusty R.,"West Hollywood, CA",63,30,8
5.0,9/15/2014,"Having seen the best Rome had to offer recently I was totally floored by the collection. The 20th Century Art Section was excellent. I have not seen anything like this outside the Smithsonian. The Egyptian Collection was on par with the British Museum. The highlight for me was seeing Van Gogh's self portrait. Too many Degas, Renoir's, and and others to mention. It was emotional seeing pictures I had previously only seen in books.  Staff was friendly and helpful.

5.0,9/13/2014,"First off, let me express how grateful I am that such an amazing, world-class museum offers a pay-what-you-can option at all times. I'm a student who had been in the city less than a week and had been living off of money I made when I was 16 to get by before my paycheck came, and I had the most amazing day exploring the Met (and essentially exploring the world) for a more doable price than most other museums here offer.I made sure to arrive shortly after it opened and wandered every single open gallery on the first floor and at least half of the second floor by the time the Met closed in the late afternoon. All that walking was extremely tiring, but when I wanted to sit down, all I had to do was plop myself down in front of some kind of priceless work of art - there are plenty to choose from - and enjoy the view.I loved all of the exhibits I saw for different reasons, but some of the parts of the museum that stand out to me the most, apart from some paintings I loved, were the Egyptian temple (the history and the openness of the area it was in was really inspiring to me) and the European and American furnished room exhibits (I felt like I got the privilege of time-traveling and peeking into lavish private homes). So awesome.I feel like I learned so much from my visit, even though I didn't make it through the whole museum, but that's okay because I know I will have to return after I start getting paid and will actually pay the full price - it's the least I can do for a museum whose generous policies and amazing exhibits have already made my time in New York magical.",2,0,1,Megan S.,"New York, NY",0,13,0

5.0,9/11/2014,"Just wonderful.The museum is just massive. Plan ahead, pick two or three galleries and spend time lingering over the art if that's your thing. Most visitors try to zip through the whole museum in one visit and I think it becomes a stressful experience. We went to the more quiet galleries -- the Oceania, the Asia, and the mezzanine gallery of the Roman arts (the mezzanine is almost deserted and it is awesome to see archaeological finds from the Neolithic period tucked away in a corner).We traveled as a family and our youngest is special needs. The MET staff couldn't be more helpful or more accommodating -- they were just so understanding when our child had a number of sensory overloads and we needed to get out of the way to somewhere quiet. The floor staff helped direct us to the right areas quickly and safely. There is an open area below the main floor where it is very quiet, bathrooms and drinking fountains. It is much better here than taking off to the cafeteria for the sensory-sensitive person. Don't be afraid to ask for help or directions, the guides know the museum inside out and can save you a a lot of time searching for the right gallery and keep the stress level and running around to a minimum.The weekdays are better, it's still busy but not insane. Open late nights on Friday if you plan to dine in the area/Central Park stroll. The side steps to the museum were cordoned off when i was there which was a shame, I remember as a child I used to sit on those steps soaking in all the excitement.",4,0,2,Rowenna N.,"Beacon, NY",4,29,1

All were presented well and organized. The high ceilings and windows, and occasional ponds really add to the beauty of the exhibits. There are plenty of areas to sit and rest.

3.0,8/26/2014,"If you ask anyone in the city what a tourist must do in New York City, he or she will recommend visiting the Met. Housing perhaps the most extensive art collection in the nation, this is certainly an excellent tourist attraction, which is the exact reason why visiting this museum can be a nightmare if you go at the wrong time.I made the mistake of going at a summertime Saturday afternoon, and should have heeded the omen of a completely crowded entrance hazed by the heavy smoke coming from two kabob stands immediately in front of the museum. The museum was expectedly packed with tourists, but the tourists' overall behaviors were extremely disturbing. There were yelling, screaming and running, and at one point, a Chinese tourist even tried to snatch a museum guide from my hand. The decibel level paralleled that of Times Square, though much amplified within confined spaces in some popular exhibits.The museum staff was surprisingly cold and rude with only a few exceptions. When I tried to ask an information desk clerk a simple question about an art piece that was next to her, she cut me off in mid-sentence and told me to go away and ""Google for a 3000-page article on that artwork before [I] ask her anything"". Then again, I understand the awful tourist situation that they had to deal with that day.---Whatever you do, DO NOT visit the Met on a weekend day especially during summertime if you plan to do some art appreciation! On weekends, this place is a tourist attraction more than an art museum. The Met definitely has the largest art collection I have seen, but I did not have the quality space and setting to truly appreciate the masterpieces this museum has to offer. To make the most of your trip, go directly to the art department that you are interested in first (Ex: Asian art, classical art, etc.) and plan to spend at least two hours in this museum.",3,0,0,Jay Y.,"Houston, TX",738,1025,1836

5.0,8/18/2014,"This is definitely one of the best art museums in the US. For scale, size and sheer volume of holdings nothing else really compares except for the Vatican, the Louvre and maybe the Hermitage.This is my third visit here and my first in many years so it was nice to revisit some old favorites and see some new things. On this visit we saw: Temple of Dendur, Greek/Roman, European Decorative Arts, some of the American Wing, European Paintings, Arts & Armor and Musical Instruments. That sounds like a lot of stuff but we probably saw 30% of what's on display, tops. I can't imagine trying to see every department in a single day - you'd go insane.My tips:*If there's a thing you really love, see it early in your visit when your energy levels are high. After five hours, everything becomes a slog.*Don't eat here if you can help it. The food is terrible and overpriced. The food trucks outside the entrance are a good option.*The musical instruments galleries are generally uncrowded, plus it's fun to appreciate something new*The European Room installations are great for those times when you don't have the money or vacation days to jet off to Versailles.*The Frank Lloyd Wright room in the American Wing is stunning*It's very easy to get lost/turned around so be sure to grab one of the maps at the entranceOther things:*$25/pp is a little steep (I know it's a ""suggestion"" but...) however, it does allow you to come back at any time over the next 5 days as well as see the Cloisters*I found that the gallery layout can be confusing/distracting, especially in the European paintings section. One minute I'd be in late Gothic Italy and the next in 17th century Dutch masters.

Plan to spend several hours, if not the whole day, if you just want to meander around versus looking at specific exhibits. Go to the Roof Garden if you can. Fantastic views! Wicked expensive cocktails but it greats views and since they're open until 9 pm Friday and Saturday, you might actually get the sunset!

We were lucky enough to come for the Charles James Beyond Fashion exhibit. In one of the rooms you were able to get up close to the dresses, which were truly works of art. Other highlights included their collection of ancient Egyptian mummies and art and countless Greek and Roman sculptures. My only gripe with this museum was it was nearly impossible to find an affordable drink you didn't have to wait 40 minutes in line for. They had their outrageously priced restaurant in the museum which we weren't even going to consider going to. Then we heard there was a snack stand on the roof that overlooked Central Park. We went up there and the line was SO long! We waited almost 20 minutes before giving up because the line just wasn't moving. We ended up going outside the museum, ordering something from one of the several food stands outside, then coming back in when we had finished.

5.0,8/2/2014,"How could you give the Met anything less than five stars? Huge and sprawling, it would be easy to spend hours, if not days, exploring absolutely everything that the Met has to offer. We were able to view the ""Charles James Beyond Fashion"" exhibit, which was one of the most amazing exhibits-- not only for its content, but the way in which it was presented. Many of James' dresses were spread about and accompanied by moving cameras and lasers. As you approached each dress, the placard would roll through the details of the dress, using the moving cameras/lasers to focus in on specific details of the garment. The placard also broke down the construction of each dress, which, given James' attention to detail, often meant layers upon layers of fabrics and seams. It really did his work justice to be able to understand all the thought and work that went into his designs-- I can imagine that similar fashion exhibits at the Met would be just as successful.The one odd thing was the space-- the exhibit was actually split between two different spaces, so there was a bit of fluidity that was lost as you had to walk to opposite sides of the museum. Not a problem for a person who wants to explore everything, but slightly jarring nonetheless. Some other highlights include the variety of Impressionist paintings, Greek/Roman sculptures, Medieval and religious arts and Egyptian sarcophaguses. As mentioned, it would be difficult to take in the museum in its entirety in one day. Luckily, the sliding scale admission makes it easy for anyone to revisit and not too feel guilty about splitting the admission cost across a few visits. We also made our way up to the roof, which was a perfect place to look out on Central Park at the Upper East Side. There was plenty of turf and many waiting for refreshing drinks, proving it to be a popular warm-weather destination for tourists and locals alike.Also, the tradition of eating lunch on the front steps is in full force-- grab a sandwich from a local deli or the plethora of food trucks parked in front, and take a moment to people watch and bask in the sun-- it makes for a perfect break before enjoying the culture within.",2,1,1,Bryan B.,"New York, NY",57,183,0

5.0,7/23/2014,"Awe inspiring.Absolutely the best museum i've ever been too.There is a pay what you feel its worth price tag which of course is brilliant. It meant that if you were at a loose end for an hour you could pay $5 and go in. If you wanted to spend the day (and you can), you could up the figure at your own discretion.In addition to exhibits showing some of the most famous works of European and American artists (paintings you'll know even though you didn't know you knew). As well as still showcasing that painting from Ferris Beuller that you just have to have a photo with. As well as having exhibits on photography, statues, carpets, armour and weapons from every nation in the world. As well as all this the Met has managed, in one of those gloriously imperial moves, to bring (brick by brick) an entire Egyptian tomb and temple complex across from Egypt and rebuild it here.I was entranced. Walking around the fully intact structure, reading about it and experiencing it at the same time.I spent many hours in the Met and have many more to give. I don't think i got even close to a quarter of it done. It will hold my interest for many visits to come.",1,0,1,Ben H.,"Leeds, United Kingdom",18,110,24

The fact that the museum was well-staffed resulted in a better experience.  However, just get into the frame of mind that there will be extensive crowds moving throughout the galleries as this is an incredibly popular museum.  Definitely worth the visit and on par with the MOMA.",0,0,0,Ethan T.,"Orlando, FL",44,325,2473

5.0,7/20/2014,"I loved my visit to the Met! I came on a Thurs afternoon in the summer, and it was busy with student groups. I wish I had picked up an audioguide ($6, I believe), but I still really enjoyed the museum. Knowing it was enormous, I realistically planned to visit the Greek and Roman, special Charles James, and rooftop exhibits.I am one of those people who likes to read EVERYTHING on the descriptions and plaques. Therefore, I started off reading every word I passed through the Greek and Roman exhibit but realized it would take hours just to get through the sculptures. I ended up spending 2 hours exploring this exhibit, and it was fascinating to see the pottery, jewelry, paintings, sculptures, etc! I did read as much as I can, and it was fascinating to learn the context of each piece.Next, I spent an hour at the Charles James exhibit, which was incredible. I had never heard of him, but I was awe-struck by the incredible amount of detail, thought, planning, and construction of his designs. The museum did an amazing job of displaying the clothing along with his quotes and methods. Undoubtedly, every visitor walked away with a much greater appreciation and understanding of  fashion. Sadly, the exhibit is only until August 10, 2014.I spent about 45 mins finding and enjoying the rooftop. The museum is huge! Of course, it provided an incredible view of the city and offered a relaxing spot to sit back and enjoy my book.I can't wait to return to visit the rest of the exhibits!",0,0,0,Ashley S.,"London, United Kingdom",325,273,122
5.0,7/20/2014,"I can't say anything about the Met that hasn't been said here many times... the museum is probably the best America has to offer. Here's a quick tip for those of you who want to take advantage of the complimentary admission to The Cloisters that your Met ticket provides - if you're going to take the bus, make sure you leave early in the day and catch a limited. You need to walk one block east of the museum and catch the northbound M4 (the sign will say ""The Cloisters""). I can't stress enough how important it is to catch a limited - you are traveling over 100 blocks, so the regular bus can take up to two hours (but does provide an interesting tour through the Bronx). Really, your best bet is to catch the red line subway #1 up pretty far north - coming back, I switched from the bus to the subway around 157th. That will save you a ton of valuable sightseeing time. Just compare your bus map to your metro map and find the northernmost point of intersection (it's not far from 157th... maybe a stop or two). Oh - when you're at the Met, get the audio guide! It's one of the best I've heard anywhere in the US or Europe. The commentary is varied between Met staffers, up to and including the curators. There is also commentary on some pieces for kids (some of which I, a 35 year old, found really fun and informative). Be prepared to spend several hours here... really, you could spend days or weeks. I was there for about 3-1/2 hours and only made it through two areas. I'll absolutely, definitely plan to return!",3,1,1,Stacy P.,"Denver, CO",85,678,1141
5.0,7/20/2014,"Yes, it's the Met and it's one of the most amazing museums in the world. Its immense size means 1) you'll most likely get lost or have trouble finding your way to a certain room, and 2) you'll never see everything in one visit. Which begs the question (and I know I can't be the only one thinking this): why oh why does the Met, and so many other top museums in New York, have such relatively limited hours on most days of the week? Seriously, at least in the summer, couldn't they stay open until at least 7 or 8pm everyday? It's kind of a slap in the face to visitors who come from all over the world, spending precious time and money in the process, only to get such a limited amount of time to check everything out. Museums should stay open later to let everyone get more of their money's worth.

Honestly, this museum is more like 4 or 5 museums in one. It is divided by civilizations, region, and era, which means the more ""artistic"" or ""well known"" eras/regions (ie. European art) will have close to 50ish rooms just dedicated to it. It's insane.The selection of art here are very diverse. Whatever you have thought about/learned about in class for certain civilizations/time eras, you can probably find something here. Also, some big name art pieces here include the Van Gogh, Monet and Manet's Water Lilies. The organization of the museum is also really well done. However, because it is SO big, it can be easy to get lost. On the plus side, you will always accidentally stumble upon a new room for you to explore and admire.Pretty amazing.

Admission is technically a suggested donation, rather than a required amount, but it's definitely worth the $25 to support the museum. (I came with my mom and she's a senior so it was only $42 for both of us.)The Egyptian exhibit is one of my favorites. Unfortunately, the day I visited they were setting up for some kind of special event so the Temple of Dendur was closed. After exploring all the nooks and crannies I stumbled across the ""Study Gallery"" which had a lot of bits and pieces of artifacts that were not fully processed for exhibition yet. They had some dried out pieces of bread from over 2000 years ago!!!I also really enjoyed the musical instrument exhibit (apparently they do have some special events where you can hear some of the instruments played, which would be awesome) and the Arms and Armor. The Impressionism exhibit is also very large and has a lot of famous paintings.The American art section has lots of beautiful Tiffany glass.The cafeteria downstairs is kind of expensive, but I guess I'm just not used to New York prices. Sandwiches are around $10. I ended up getting the salad bar, which was really fresh and had a lot of interesting choices.Coming here from the Port Authority bus terminal didn't have an easy way to take the subway straight here.

An impossible, Sisyphean task, to be sure, but here's briefly what I have to say about the exhibits I've finished.Egyptian: extra touristy, has a restroom, lots of burial art which gets uninteresting after awhile. The mummies and tombs are initially interesting but one loses interest. Greece/Rome: Considering my identity, I connected with this wing a lot. I knew a good deal of Greek mythology and some of Roman history, and it resonated. Lots of cool sculptures, more burial art.Asian: Big, but doesn't have as much ancient Asian art as I would like. The Indian and Southeastern wings were the coolest, and some of the Japanese stuff was cool, too. Chinese propaganda art was interesting. Not interested in vases.Medieval: More of this stuff is at the Cloisters, and so medieval seems at once sparse an too much. Lots of Virgin Marys and baby Jesus', as you can imagine.

As you walk around (for hours and hours) it's almost guaranteed you will find some stuff that will change your mindset, at least for the day.  The collection is so immense that it would take days to explore in detail what they have on display. From the outside it's difficult not to feel the presence of enormity, the size of the Met is roughly equivalent to 4 city blocks. Once you get inside the doors the scale is the same. The huge entry and high ceilings make you feel hopeless that you might get to see everything, you will not. I have never seen everything in one visit, ever. I go mostly because I am in town and have an opportunity. I always make sure I get to see the special exhibits and then I try to see other things that interest me as I have time. If I had one piece of advice about a planned visit to the met, do some research, make a list and stick to it.

They had a lot of artifacts and even part of a pyramid brought to NY from Egypt (per what I read). I thought the whole thing was just awesome. I also enjoyed the Italian sculptures. I got a little bored with the British art, I'm just not a fan of portraits.

Circle those on your map and plan your route accordingly.4. The best/largest give shop is right near the entrance. I don't recommend buying the books there, they are fabulous, but super heavy.

5.0,5/6/2014,"The Metropolitan Museum of Art is quite simply stunning.  I've been here over 10 times and there is ALWAYS something new and exciting to see.  The ""suggested"" donation is $25 which is quite steep, but I guarantee it is worth you're money.  If you're lucky, some of the major companies in NYC have corporate memberships (like mine!) which means you get to go whenever you want for free.  I am not an art aficionado by any means, but The Met has so much to offer it makes me want to BECOME an art aficionado. LECTURES AT THE MET: There are several ongoing and sporadic lecture series at the Met.  My inner nerd highly suggests you try one!  I really enjoyed the lectures about Cleopatra's obelisk - you'll learn more about the history of the obelisk, the various obelisks throughout the world, and how they got Cleopatra's obelisk from Egypt to Central Park (genius engineering, if you ask me).  THE MET STORE: Is absolutely incredible. In addition to the HUGE selection of books and art objects, there are tons of beautiful vases, scarves, and other NYC memorabilia.  I have purchased several gifts for people from the Met store and they are always well-received.  A little known insider fact - the Met Store will SHIP across the country for a nominal fee (cheaper than UPS) which is great if you want to send something large or breakable. THE MUSEUM AND GROUNDS: Are absolutely stunning.  Even if you hate art, you'll still love the grandeur and beauty of the grand staircase and museum layout. THE CLOISTERS: It's quite a trek, but I'm dying to go there and see it in the Spring. THE ART: Of course the art is really why you go to ""The Met.""  From Byzantium and Egyptian artifacts that are thousands of years old to the impressionist paintings of Van Gogh and Monet, from the ancient Greek and Roman sculptures to the rotating exhibits ranging from fashion to ink art to photography to bronzes, The Met has an eclectic and wide array of art that will suit any palate.",4,0,1,Nicole T.,"Manhattan, NY",84,272,13

4.0,4/8/2014,"A lovely museum in one of the greatest cities in the world, the Met is a place for art lovers. The sculpture and furniture collections are particularly impressive (but the modern art wing is just so/so). When there's a special exhibit it's usually worth the visit. The Met is also one of the only museums I've been to that has a Jackson Pollock and a Lee Krasner piece in the same gallery (the Tate Modern in London also has a Pollock and a Krasner). My fellow art nerds will understand the geeky coolness of this. I agree with some reviewers as to the craziness of some of the security guards -- I'm not going to steal that Caravaggio just because I'm studying it intensely for a few minutes -- so be careful not to approach any of the works too closely or prepare to be reprimanded. The famous gift shop lives up to the hype. You should allow at least 30 minutes to browse the wares. If you go on a rainy or cold day, try NOT to bring a coat or umbrella or be prepared to brave the LONG lines at the coat check. When I say LONG, I mean LONG -- a wait of 60 minutes to drop off AND then to retrieve your items is not unheard of. Watch out for some of the scammers that tend to operate outside the museum. There are always people trying to ""help"" you get a taxi ride or trying to sell you some fake junk. Just keep walking and say no thanks. The taxi ""helpers"" are pretty bad around closing time. Just walk a block over and flag down your own ride.As for the ""suggested donation"" admission fee, don't be cheap. At least give them 10 bucks.

I have been here at least 30 times, and every time there is something I haven't seen before. It is dangerously easy to squander a day away here, and that wouldn't even scratch the surface.For those who don't wish to spend a good portion of their lives exploring every nook and cranny of this 2 MILLION square foot building, here are some very cursory recommendations, and believe me, narrowing them down wasn't easy.In Greek and Roman Art; the Roman sculpture court, all the Greek and Roman columns, and sarcophagi, the reconstructed frescoed rooms from Pompeii, the 5th and late 4th Century Greek Pottery, and the Hellenistic art.In Egyptian Art; the statues of Akenaten and Hatshepsut, the ENTIRE reconstructed temple of Dendur moved and rebuilt here after the construction of the Aswan high dam, the monstrous granite sarcophagus, and of course the mummies.In Asian Art; the Chinese painting and calligraphy, the giant statue of Bodhisattva and the Chinese Buddhist art, and ALL of the Japanese art (ancient-contemporary).The Impressionist gallery in European Paintings.The Lamassu in Ancient Near Eastern Art.The reconstructed Frank Lloyd Wright room in American Art.The sculpture court, the reconstructed French-style rooms, and the Ferdinand Eusebio Miseroni Ewer in European Sculpture and Decorative Arts.The Samuri Swords and daggers, and the European Armor in Arms and Armor.The Moroccan Court in Islamic Art.And saving the best for last, the incredible views and yearly installation featuring a contemporary artist on the roof garden.Again this is just the best of the best (in my opinion) and there is more to be seen in the Metropolitan Museum of Art than could every be appreciated in a lifetime. You also must remember that the $25 suggested donation is just that, suggested. Though it would be worth that price without question, it isn't required to gain entrance. Even if you're not a museum person, there's something for everyone here for everyone, and what you see will amaze and astound you.

5.0,2/4/2014,"I have been to this particular museum of art multiple times, and I must say, each time was even more enjoyable than the last. There are a plethora of different sections- each representing different cultures of the world. It is the largest museum in the entire United States and among the top ten largest museums in the world. You could spend a day here just admiring every single piece of art and history in the entire Met.My experiences here at the Met were quite excellent. There are so many exhibitions to visit, and each room is so different than the next. The museum is enormous and can get really crowded every now and then.The staff is very courteous and welcoming, and are always delighted to show you around the museum. You'll find yourself staying at the Met from when it opens to when it closes, admiring every little piece of art and examining every piece of history from hundreds of diverse cultures. The museum is unlike any museum you probably have ever seen.There are libraries in this museum that contain countless volumes of historical art including monographs and catalogs. Admission is pay what you wish with an initial recommendation of $25. From casual to elegant, the Met also offers a wide variety of dining options. If you ever get hungry during your visit, the Met offers nine different dining areas to feed your tummy and keep you up and running through your visit. From the Cafeteria to the Members Dining Room, you never have to deal with hunger during your visit! The Met is kid friendly and recommended for every single person out there that enjoys a bit of history. The Met has so many pieces of art, you most likely will not be able to see everything in a day. This may the best museum you have ever visited yet. The service is as decent as it could possibly get, and you'll find yourself coming back for more! The Metropolitan Museum of Art is truly an enchanted place. You will encounter fascinating exhibits and pieces of art and human ingenuity over the historical years, and all the same, have an unimaginable amount of enjoyment while you're at it.",0,0,0,Brian L.,"Brooklyn, NY",40,36,0

5.0,2/1/2014,"The most perfect place to be on a Friday evening in NYC is the balconette overlooking the floor of the MET, while the musical notes of a live piano fill the air, complementing the soft chatter and delicate clinking of silverware. It is at once high-culture and high-society, accessible to the public sphere in a casual and relaxed presence. After noshing on apps and enjoying a cocktail (or three), what better digestif than to walk her corridors and appreciate the fine art that dwells in her space. Each visit to the MET brings about it a new experience; every single time unique and apart from the one that preceded it. It reminds me of the quote by Heraclitus ""No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.""

It can get really crowded and even overwhelming, but I found their staff to be courteous and patient when directing me specific exhibits and more importantly, the bathrooms.

First, let me explain to those of you who are not familiar with NYC.  The MET *could* be a long long beautiful strolling day.  If you arrive by 11am, it can easily take you up to 2-3 hours to see everything and that's of you're in a hurry.  You want to absorb this beautiful museum with every fiber of your being. Absorb every beautiful artwork and take your time.  At some half way point, during your day.......I suggest doing what I did.  Take a breather, go towards the bar, and order a Cosmo.  This makes ALL the rest of your art tour look and feel Ahhhh-MAZING!  (might be just me, but I get drunk on one Cosmo).  (And giggly.)

5.0,1/24/2014,"Museums are the first thing I love to visit (aside from restaurants) when I visit a city. This one of my favorite museums in NYC! It's truly a rich museum that I will have to go back the next time to explore the rest of the museum.  Do plan on making multiple trips to see the entire museum or go right when it opens. Highlights: - The armory exhibit is stunning - must see! - The roof garden gives you an amazing view of central park (without the crazy fees). It's a nice place for a good photo shot or lunch.  Just to warned, the items at the cafe are extremely inflated. You can easily spend $20 on a not so filling lunch. -The entrance fee is not really a fee. There's a suggested donation, but it's up to you to decide how much you would like to donate.

5.0,1/22/2014,"Simply the greatest museum in America, and one of the greatest in the world. The wing with the Temple of Dendur is a highlight, but what's staggering is that it's only one small part of a truly gigantic museum that's impossible to canvass in just one day.No matter what collection you're perusing, chances are it's probably the definitive collection of its kind in the U.S., not to mention holding its own at a world level. I personally found the Greek, Roman, and near Eastern collections particularly noteworthy, as well as the broad range of paintings from European masters. When I lived in NYC, I brought my parents here a couple of times and they couldn't get enough of the Chinese and Asian collections, oohing and aahing their way through stuff they'd only read or heard about before.Plan on spending a whole day here, or if you have the ability to come here multiple times over a spread-out period, then dedicate yourself to specific sections each time. And don't forget to check out the view from the rooftop bar.

5.0,1/12/2014,"For my 900th review I thought I'd review the Met. This museum is a NYC staple which supports the city with its works of art and vice versa. I don't think this city would be the same without it. It takes a good while to get through the Met's 3 large winged floors. If you are trying to see everything you'll probably fail secondary to visual exhaustion. I would pick and choose as you are going through.Some of the main attractions are in the Sackler wing (temple of Dendur), the Bis poles of Papa New Guinea, the Charles Englehard court featuring a Tiffany's designed fountain, and the Great Hall.They have special exhibits worth going through and the website can keep you updated on those. The suggested donation is up to $25. I've seen some people give quarters. There is also a same week admission to the Cloisters museum and gardens (dedicated to medieval European art).

5.0,1/5/2014,"First off, the one thing I would point out is that the admission prices are ""Recommended."" We had seven in our group and if we paid the $25 ""recommended"" price, we would never have gone. Four members of our group used their ""Bank of America"" card to get in free (first weekend of the month) and I gave them $20 for my husband, daughter and I. I could have probably given them $10 and they would have taken it.But I still spent money there - more than I would have if I had to pay ""full price.""Some recommendations:1. Plan ahead. You will never be able to truly see everything in one day if you are in a group that is there for only a few hours. I would suggest looking over the sections and start by deciding what you would NOT be very interested in seeing and have each member of the group pick the ONE thing THEY would really like to see. Depending upon how much time and how many people, this worked out great for us.2. The audio guide is great if you are alone but not so great with a group because it seemed we moved on to the next display before I had a chance to listen to the guide. The hour I spent alone, though, listening to the guide as I studied the art was well worth the $7 I spent for the iPod rental. 3. Eat before you go. I expected the food to be pricey (it was NYC, after all) but $3.50 for a bottle of water? Egad. I bought two sandwich combos (included soup, sandwich and beverage) for $17 each and our daughter got a snack of fruit and chips. Total cost for three for lunch was nearly $50.4. Go early. We arrived at 11 on a Saturday morning. Granted, it was the day after a snowstorm but we parked in the garage underneath in a space close to the entrance and had no traffic issues. When we left the museum at 4 to go to ride the subway, the lines inside the museum were long and outside, traffic was crazy busy. By the time we got back to the museum around 6, traffic was not bad at all and we were able to leave the city with no problems at all.  (But be prepared to pay a bit more for the convenience of the parking - from 11 am to about 6 pm, it cost $42 for parking.)5. Baggage and coats. If you use a backpack, be prepared to wear it on your chest because you are not allowed to wear it on your back. Also, bags are checked each time you come in so no outside food or big drinks. It was very cold when we went but we didn't want to carry our coats nor use the coatroom (another reviewer mentioned the long lines and they were correct) so we left them in our car since we parked so close. Other members of the group had to wait about 15 minutes to get their coats.6. Dress comfortably. There will be a lot of walking (on cold hard floors) and some rooms seemed hotter than others (such as the cafeteria in the American section).7. Be prepared to get a little lost. The layout is a bit confusing and if you do not have a good sense of direction (like my daughter) you will end up going the wrong way. Often. Of course, to me, I loved trying to figure out where we were and how we would get to where we wanted to go.8. If you are only in NYC for a short time, this place should definitely be on your list of things to do because it is inexpensive (as long as you don't eat there) and well worth the hiking.We may not have paid much to get in, but they got more than enough $$$ out of us by the time we left.",0,0,0,Teri M.,"Stroudsburg, PA",1,5,1

3.0,12/31/2013,"We were disappointed by the closed sections. We specifically went to see the Strad matched viol collection and the keyboard instruments. Before we bought the tickets, we asked the agent which sections, if any, were closed. She said two sections in the musical instruments area were closed. She then called the instruments area and was told it was the pipe organ and several ukuleles. So we paid the $50 admission and went to the section, only to find they had told her the wrong sections and it was the instruments we had come to see that were closed. This really upset us since we'd done everything we could think of to check it out. We told one of the guards in the section and he explained that the front desk and the sections don't communicate well and have had this problem since they opened for all 7 days a week. I really wouldn't have minded it if we had received the correct information. But as it is, I have to warn any potential patrons that they are on there own and can't really rely on the info at the front desk. Suggestion: give them $1 ""donation"", make sure the stuff you came to see is there, then go back and donate the remaining $24.

I grew up in a rural area and saw these works of art in the books we read during school. I can't fathom growing up and having access to this kind of collection in the real world.I really enjoyed that student artists were scattered about, trying their hand to replicate some of the masterworks on display. Each student was more than willing to chat with visitors, and it brought life to the process.If I could have one wish here, it would have been for an easy ""must-see"" reference, knowing that we had limited time to explore.

That ish cray.Enough about me. On to the Met. I don't think you need a review of what's in the museum, it's world famous so I want to provide some protips:1. Get the audio guide. It's really a must have. It lets you learn about the art while looking at it instead of reading. You didn't come here to read you came here to look at art.2. Do your best not to bring a bag b/c the coat check, while run efficiently, still takes a while. There's just a lot of people here.3.

It's really good (if expensive) and you can do it on the rooftop in spring and summer (do yourself a favor, go on a Friday and catch the sunset over Central Park!), the balcony for live music on Friday nights, and the sculpture garden with a great view. 4. Free (AKA included with price of admission) gallery talks and yours. Word to the wise-- look it up online and see if you need to register first AND get there early.

Friends who were more well traveled would scoff at the High, and I never understood how/why they would do that.Then I walked into the Metropolitan. I stopped and just thought, ""oh, THIS is a museum."" since then, I've visited the Louvre and traveled much more but the Metropolitan is so far my favorite museum in the world.

5.0,12/23/2013,"This is what you call a true ART museum! This is a gem in a city overpopulated with art museums, each one trying to consider itself the best. The Metropolitan Museum of Art is diverse by having art from different time ages, different cultures, and different techniques. It's a huge museum, that has so many doors leading into other doors, that lead into another exhibition, and it's impossible to finish it in a day while admiring it at the same time. Their so many good things to say about the MET. 1. It has a beautiful view of central park, well because it is located in central park! I normally walk across the park to get here and i'm greeted by a number of people sitting at the steps all the time, eating lunch, planning their day, etc. 2. Once you enter you can either pay for a ticket (bad choice) or enter by donation. So that's actually a bargain considering you're about to see one of the greatest art collection of ALL TIME. Please make sure to already have on your walking shoes, because you will be doing a lot of walking. They also give you this cute little pin, which i suggest you keep for a souvenir. 3. It's a must to visit the egyptian gallery, the greek gallery, and the japanese garden. Most of the big exhibitions feature a wishing fountain, throw a coin and be faithful. It's not important and you can completely ignore this part, but trust me it makes your trip a lot funner.4. During christmas they put up this beautiful christmas tree, you must see it! It's elegant and vintage looking.Everything about this museum is just perfect for those who love and those who don't love art because it offers a little of everything. I would normally not compare two places unless their normally compared but I am not a MoMA fan. I do like some pieces their, normally the old classic ones, but when it comes to modern art, it doesn't quite fit my standards. Plus it's price is crazy compared to the MET for it's size and art. But the MET offers history, it allows you to learn more about how another group of people lived in another period. It offers a lot to the art world and to the public in general.",2,0,0,Abby R.,"Manhattan, NY",126,69,11

It's even rarer for an art museum to lay honest claim to top collections in multiple areas. It's comically insane that the Met possesses such a diverse, remarkable, priceless set of treasures under one incredible roof. On my last visit, I was sadly pressed for time and only could hit a few high points, sating my love for medieval and renaissance European art. But as the museum began to close and I slowly meandered toward the exit (meandering can get you an extra 30 minutes or more in the place, depending on crowd drift/speed, your ability to evade staff, and luck), I peeked into the amazing and nearly deserted collections pertaining to Oceania and eastern Africa, only to be blown away yet again and realize how little I know about the artistic traditions from that end of the world.

Its expensive though, probably cost you about 40 bucks for about 4 or 5 hours   The Museum in a word is huge , there are plenty of bathrooms, and the whole thing is user friendly, there are elevators,  stairs, a few escalators, its easy to get around.  A lot of care and though went into the design and access for the disabled or elderly, Which i respect.   The range of Art is simply amazing. What a thrill to stand in front of a Van Gogh or Rembrandt, so close you could touch it, it makes you feel special to be in the Presence of such art, great Art is eternal and you feel as though you are now a part of that eternal greatness.   My favorite place is the sculpture Garden/Atrium, next to the Food court on the First Floor, its well lit and comfortable, nearby is the Temple Dendur.  Really what is there to say about this place that hasn't been said before, it should be on every bodies checklist of glorious things to see on this world.  To sit down and look at Work by Monet , such as "" Path Through the Irises' a Painting as big as a wall, is to understand the Genius of these special Men, No Photograph in a book can ever duplicate its beauty, its texture, and colors, he seemed to have applied the paint not with a brush but a Trowel, that how thick its lays on the canvas.  If there is any problem at all its that there are so may amazing Paintings that your Brain goes onto sensory overload, and its hard to truly appreciate and give the proper attention to each work, You Turn from Van Gogh "" Sunflowers''  and there is  Rembrandt, its so much to take in at once the mind stops Processing and the effect is subdued its a kin to eating at the best restaurant in the world, there is only so much you can consume before your stomach say enough and your mind tells you your full.     You will take a thousand photos of course, but no Photo will ever take the place of being in the presence of the Art itself it could be the closest you ever come to the Benevolence of the lord himself of which all this art and striving is but a small compartment in the smallest recesses of his magnificence .   Since, the backyard of the Museum is Central Park, you can walk outside and enjoy Nature, and Gods Masterpieces, which make the works inside Pale in comparison.  If you love art, you must come, somehow, someway, you must come, and see for yourself.",0,0,0,lonnie a.,"Bronx, NY",0,5,0

I have dreams of living in NY on the Upper East Side and making weekly visits there just to get through all of it. It's a beautiful building, I love walking up the front steps and having my anticipation grow with each step. This time I went there were 18 collections on - 18! I have no idea how long you'd need to get through them all. But my BFF and I had a plan - we were trying to tackle 2 in 2 hours and we succeeded, barely, before close.I love that they are open late on Fridays and Saturday - to 9:00pm. It's one of my beefs with all museums - why not let us working folk have access to museums after business hours!! This trip we perused the MASSIVE Egypt exhibit. Its incredible how many rooms of artifacts they have. Many of which are in the permanent collection. Those poor Egyptians...having so much of their culture pillaged by looters and then having to sell so much of what was left to pay their own bills. Including Cleopatra's needle - an obelisk - one of very few pieces left from her reign - and a highlight of this tour - its actually outside in Central Park and there's a big restoration planned for it. The story of it's movement and history is found inside the museum. I was really hoping for a room inside the museum where you could see the obelisk but as it faces a room full of windows but alas, no luck.My goal going there was to visit the European impressionist paintings. I LOVE Van Gogh - I actually saw my first one here - Sunflowers brought me to tears the first time I saw it. It wasn't here this time but a good selection of others including the Roses, Irises, and the other Sunflower painting were there. Degas, Monet, Manet, Turner, so many it could make you dizzy! We certainly rushed through a lot of them but what always amazes me is the layout of the rooms going from one to the next happens effortlessly and you don't miss a thing! I feel ill qualified to write a true review of this mammoth museum. But go - you won't be disappointed, there truly is something for everyone.And did I mention it's a pay-what-you-can admission?!

It's scale and presence commands your attention when walking upon it. Initially it doesn't register that this enormous building is filled with priceless art and cultural artifacts from civilizations and artist of our collective past.Immediately upon entering you see a statue of the pharaoh Ramses. Sweet! It is rather overwhelming if you try and take it all in. We restricted our day to the 2nd floor. The European art was cool. I felt like I was in Italy. Every painting was along a biblical narrative. That god old then and now was no different. Transitioning into the wing of the Asian art was refreshing. I can harpy remember a time I've sat down an admired the asian mythology and imagery. Awesome. Places like these allow you to appreciate the fact that experience that reference an epic history are life-affirming.

One downside was that the food in the cafes was very expensive so remember to eat before you go. Another con is some of the guards were very rude yelling across the room at people for various things.

From doing my pre-trip research the night before, I of course looked up the MET! I knew that this is a museum must-see for anybody who is coming to NYC. It is basically free since they have a ""pay as you wish"" rule. My friend and I only gave a quarter each. I grab a map, open it first and think, ""oh this is not too bad! I heard it was bigger"". My friend tells me, ""You did not open it more, there is another page"", crap. ""Two floors with probably 1,000+ rooms to go through. OMG! This could take all day! I don't have all day!""So sadly I had to speed walk through this whole museum since I was in a rush. I literally did it all in about 3 hours or less. Just walked through every room with hundreds to thousands of art from all around the world and so many years of history. It is truly a fascinating place and I fell in love with it. People are honestly not lying when they say it would take 2 full days if you really read every note and took a minute to glance at every piece. The largest art museum in the United States, it is so overwhelming! I only really stopped a handful of times when something creeped me out or looked familiar such as the Van Gogh stuff or classic American pieces.Don't lose track of your friends because you can really get lost here!

The depth of items this museum has for all its exhibits is very impressive.,0,0,0,Dave K.,"Chicago, IL",81,114,0
5.0,10/29/2013,"Tips for enjoying the Met:1. Buy one of the 20$ guides to the place, especially if you don't have like a week to see the whole thing, its a huge huge collection.2. Stop it with the camera,cellphones and tablets,  you are going to take 1000 crappy photos of beautiful artwork, you were too busy taking photos of to ACTUALLY LOOK AT IN PERSON. That is the point. Take a photo on the roof top, take maybe one or two  on the stairs, but sweet baby pandas, don't take a photo of everything, and LOOK AT THE ART. You want to remember what you saw? buy a book on the collection or even just a couple postcards.3. Eat at the Met, inside or out. those Hotdog venders are killer, If you are a tourist, you can get your authentic NYC  hotdog here. Or if you want something more relaxed, go to one of the dining areas inside. My favorite is next to 19th century sculpture.4. If you have time go check out the ""storage"" area. Ask a guard, they will know what you are talking about.5.Also smile and thank all venders and guards, because they are humans.",4,2,1,Ashli S.,"Manhattan, NY",74,52,3
5.0,10/24/2013,"Before I get to the review of the actual museum, can I just ask prospective tourists to please say thank you to the hot dog vendors outside the museum? I bought a hot dog for a quick snack before entering and thanked the guy, and the guy almost teared up like I was the only person to ever thank him for a hot dog.Anyway, the Met is amazing. I'm not a big fan of art but I easily spent two hours here and had a fun time looking at stuff, and I didn't even see half of the exhibits since I had to leave to meet up with someone. If you want to see everything, go in the morning because it'll take you a few hours, especially if you really want to take your time on certain pieces. Otherwise, just pick the exhibits you think you'd find most interesting.When you walk in, they have a list of ticket prices. Turns out these are actually ""suggested donations"" so you can actually go into the museum for free if you wanted to. But going in for free is a dick move, so I suggest just paying the donation. It'll be worth your money.Non-flash photography is allowed inside, but don't be like the super-tourists who literally walk from piece to piece to just take a picture without actually taking time to examine and/or appreciate the work.It's super touristy but I'd suggest to everyone visiting New York City to check this place out, even if you're not an art junkie.",2,1,2,Allen C.,"San Francisco, CA",431,571,95

I seriously have to tear myself away at each exhibition because they are all interesting. If you are a big Art History buff, you will enjoy the Egyptian and Byzantine wing. They also have an expansive collection of armor and weapons, which really inspired me and had me taking tons of reference pictures (I draw fantasy armor for a living). I could spend DAYS just sketching the statues in the statue courtyard, or studying the effortless brushstroke of John Singer Sargent. They have a huge modern and contemporary section that hold many prominent artworks. I can go on and on, but my point is that you will not be bored at this wonderful museum because it houses a very impressive collection.And don't forget the not-so-secret seasonal rooftop garden - you can enjoy a drink and a view if the weather permits.

Then there's the ancient Egyptian exhibit, the Greek statues, a bunch of Picassos, recreated early American housing... I can't imagine there's anyone out there who can't find something to amaze them in this place. The only problem is that finding your way around is nearly impossible.

4.0,9/25/2013,"I hadn't been to this museum since I lived in Connecticut and had a first date here with a guy I met on a dating website (this was before even meeting my current husband).  I was actually here recently for my first journalistic writing assignment for a well regarded blog in town. If you're looking for classical art, this is THE place to find it.  You will even find some modern art, though not the super radical works you'd see at MOMA.  Make sure you get a map since it can be easy to get lost here; I had to wander about trying to get out.  You're going to need more than one visit to really appreciate this museum or a very long day.  Personally, I think everyone should take a date to a museum but especially the Met with its comprehensive & varied collection since you can find out a lot about the person by what type of art (s)he likes or even if (s)he has any type of artistic appreciation.  You can also find out if you're dating someone who freaks out at the sight of naked people in artwork.  Taking someone you recently started dating to the Met would probably save you a lot of time and heartache in the long run or confirm that you made a good choice.Back when I went, they had a pay what you wish day but I don't think they have it anymore since I've not seen it on their website or in the admission information.  I'd probably go more often if they did since I have to live on a budget & the ticket price is a little steep for us.The staff here is also very friendly & security are more than happy to answer questions and help you with things.  I had a very easy time getting in, navigating around the exhibit and definitely felt welcome here.  If you aren't supposed to be someplace, don't worry because the staff and security people will definitely tell you & let you know where you CAN sit or stand.  They handle their crowds well.  Finally, if you are visiting NYC this is one of those places you should see if you have even the slightest appreciation for art & the maturity not to be overcome by the vapors at the sight of artistic nudity.",1,0,1,Monica T.,"New York, NY",235,1924,25

4.0,9/19/2013,"How can you not give the Met less than four stars?  It's amazing simply for its size, grandeur and how you can spend an entire day in there and not cover everything.  But I do have a couple bones to pick.  Firstly, it's actually free but they don't let anyone know this.  To get in you have to stand in a  line and receive a Met sticker with the date on it.  Above the person who gives you the sticker is a sign that says ""ADMISSION"" with a bunch of different prices.  Adults are $25.  This leads one to believe that you must pay this amount to get in.  Nowhere does it say (or at least obviously say) that this is a suggested donation - not even on their website.  The two times I came to the Met this past summer I simply said ""I'd like to give $5, please,"" and the woman gave me a sticker with no problems.  I don't like that they intentionally lead people to believe they must pay this much money.  At other free museums (e.g., ones in London), there is only a large donation box when you walk in- it is quite obvious that it is free.  I would like to think that the treasures inside the museum are there for anyone - regardless of financial situation - to enjoy and learn.  Who knows, maybe they do it for crowd control, but it just doesn't jive with me for ideological reasons.  Secondly, the audio guide was not super great.  It was another $7 and basically had the same information that was written on the placards next to the art.  It may have had a bit more information, but nothing that added to my appreciation of what I was looking at.  It was nice to have so I could listen to the information while looking at the piece, but on my second trip back I didn't think the $7 was worth it. Of course, these are just two things that irked me about my time at the Met.  I focused on those two things in this review because I think everyone pretty much knows that it's an amazing treasure in New York City and that it's definitely worth a visit.  Just know that you don't have to spend so much money in order to enjoy it all!",2,0,0,Anna H.,"Honolulu, HI",141,165,0

5.0,8/27/2013,"Visiting the MET, the largest art museum in North America and second in the world is an experience like no other. In the city not lacking in glamorous wonders, the MET still stands out like a crowned jewel. For an art lover like me, the MET is a place to go on a timeless journey and live history through art, a place to relive the Egyptians' obsession and tributes to their afterlife;  to admire the elegant sculpture representations of the mythical pagan gods' of the Roman and the Greeks; to indulge in the dramatic elements of the Baroque arts; and to appreciate the purposeful but abstract brush strokes of Monet and Renoir. The MET is also a place to step across the continents and learn about the culture and lives of New Guinea people, to visit the tomes of Egyptian Pharaohs, to walk through the bedrooms of French monarchy and to relax in a garden in China. Give MET an appropriate tribute by losing yourself in its vast collections and myriad of art works, don't try to rush through the entire place in a day, instead, slow down and appreciate the art at a leisure pace and learn something new through the accompanying audio guide describing the art works. Stop and have a drink at one of the many extraordinarily designed public spaces throughout the museum and have some fun people watching the happenings outside in Central Park.Extraordinary, wondrous and magical.",3,0,2,Sharon Z.,"Foster City, CA",143,428,2075

5.0,8/25/2013,"After a 15 year sabbatical, I returned to look at baseball cards of all things. The Met was always something on my to-do list but a dead-ball expo had my name on it and I had to see it. The T206 Honus Wagner has occupied my dreams from the age of 12 and I finally had the opportunity to see it in person. I loved it. Of all the dozens of pictures I took, I snapped only one of Honus T206 and spent the rest of the time memorizing every nuance, color and imperfection of it. It's extraordinary. For all the baseball historians, it's open until Dec 1st. That aside, I love the impressionist and post-impressionist exhibits. I understand it's a virtual tourist trap, but if you avoid the meat puppets with cameras implanted in their heads, it's inspiring to be in the greatness of Van Gogh, Monet and the like. Fortunately, you cannot take pictures of works by realist Johan Christian Dahl. You can only stare and absorb the beauty in front of you like real humans used to do. Do not leave without seeing them (or Picasso's ""blue period"" or the genius of Seurat and so on and so on).

I live here in the city and get up as frequently as I can, going mostly on weekdays to avoid the crowds. If you haven't had a chance to get up to the rooftop terrace/bar, it is definitely worth it. Take the elevator up to the 5th floor, then get out, buy a drink, and enjoy the view. on the roof, you are on top of the tree line in Central Park, meaning you can clearly see the midtown buildings and the vast park below.

I focused mainly on Monet, Seurat, and Picasso, and a tiny bit on American art. MOMA seems to have more Picasso pieces though. Walk through the Egyptian art section as the room with huge windows is quite a sight to see. You can easily spend an entire weekend here if needed. The museum is very close to Central Park.

5.0,8/19/2013,"I like going to the Met. Not love, like. There are really only two main reasons to go here. 1. You pay a dollar and get admitted ($25 is the recommended admission, people. Don't be a sucker and pay it!) to see a ridiculous amount of priceless things.2. The rooftop garden. That's the view from the roof. It's probably one of my favourite views in the city. Every summer there's a new exhibit going on up there, so I went on over to see what this year's had in store. Essentially there's just a lot of splattered red paint on the ground. And voila, art. If I'm getting much too technical for you here, I do apologize. So... Is it good? God, who knows. Did I like it? Not really. Only because I can't help but compare it to when Jeff Koons had an exhibit up there years ago that was gorgeous and great. I guess some of the patterns up close were kind of neat. But I'm really reaching here, guys. Honestly, the view up there is the best thing. They have drinks and sandwiches as well, but I think you know by now that $10 for a pre-made turkey sandwich ain't gonna fly with me.Other highlights of The Met? Well, personally I just like wandering around. The best parts of any museum visit is when you enter a room and there's no one else there. I love that to death. It just feels kind of nice to be alone with all that crazy old, expensive, sometimes-gorgeous stuff.If I ever have a ludicrous amount of money, I'd love to pay someone off to let me just hang out in a museum after hours. With no jerks around telling me that I'm standing too close. And there's no one around taking any photos. God, that'd be amazing. But imagine just getting to hang out with all this stuff? Alone? Might be magical, I think.Anyway, this isn't even my favourite museum in New York, but it's a fine one.

I'll say it is a bit confusing to get around (or maybe it's my map challenges that hampered me:-)) But you could wander around for hours just enjoying art from different cultures, periods etc. We partook of the 18th Century Pastels exhibit as well as their African art collection.

When you do, they say, ""You're a student? The suggested donation is $12. Would you like to donate and if so, how much?""

5.0,8/8/2013,"I'm a history buff and a museum kinda guy.  Recently did a trip to new york and we had this on our to-do list.  I was so busy putting the rest of the trip together I didn't really look into what we were going to see when we got there.I had always thought the Louvre in Paris was 'the' museum of museums but I'm changing my vote to the Metropolitan Museum of art.  Makes my chest pound with pride that we have this amazing place in the USA!So we get there, pay to get in and get the map.  Its then I realized that this place is overwhelming and we had to pick what we were going to see and budget out time.So I made a executive decision on what to see first - we go this way .. to the right.The Egyptian section of the museum.  My kids never seen a real mummy before, or hieroglyphics, she she (and me) where just blown away at the whole Egyptian part of the museum.  Awesome.  We also had lunch at the cafeteria - that was expensive.  36 bucks for 2 sandwich's, 2 drinks, 2 chips and a piece of fruit.  Food was OK for museum cafeteria food and I didn't complain because in some small way I figured I was supporting the place.  Other highlights for us -Medieval arms and armor.  Bonus!!  You have to go to Europe to see a collection biggerSpend a lot of time in the Medieval section.  Loved it.  Small Viking section if you are into that.The American rooms through the ages that were completely furnished.  My kid got to see what a Frank Lloyd Wright  room looked like first hand. The endless room of Early American (maybe Europe to - i forgot) furniture.  Kinda like the Indiana Jones room where they put the arc.  Filled with rows and rows of desks, chairs, tables.  Very coolThe pre-columbian art area.  Lots and lots of cool gold masks and jewelry.  There's tons more to see there.  We didn't even make it to the impressionist section we were so heads down with what was in front of us.Tips - Purchase tickets in advance and save your self some time - quite a bit of it if you go during peak season.Plan!  doh!  have a look at what there is to see and work out a battle plan. Don't get ambushed with the immensity of the place by not planning ahead.Go for sure - even if you're not the museum type there is something there for everyone to see",1,0,1,R P.,"Sunnyvale, CA",45,409,358
5.0,8/8/2013,"America Pie Punk Chaos - Couture When the punk movement exploded, I was but a twinkle in my Mum's eye, but just like so many others who have followed, I have been fascinated by life force and impact the punk movement made. In London, punk took root within the working classes, tired of  toxic socio- economic conditions and sustained unemployment.  The UK punks channelled the genre as weapon against the 'establishment' and evolved it. Not just into a fashion movement but more importantly, into a vocally  challenging  rebellion against the straitjacket of 'vanilla' music which populated the charts in the mid-70sAcross the pond in the US, the punk movement captured the hearts and minds of a different kind of rebel. These punks were more artistic, focused primarily on music, were location centric in terms of their sounds and I believe foreshadowed the rise of late 80s grunge scene. The exhibition begins with a giant screen showing punks dancing aka pogoing or jumping up to you and I ! On either side of the screen are silent  punk gladiators.  One representing the do it yourself fashion purity of punk pioneers Westwood & McLaren, facing off against thier couture rival, John Galliano, Next came the carousal of 'costumes', which not only took me back to my childhood, but also perfectly illustrated the cyclical web of fashion through the decades. Dotted into the walls were statement t-shirts, that predated Katherine Hammant's 80s classics and were a darned sight more provocative. The faithful recreation of the infamous loos in New York's CBGB club, the spiritual home of such luminaries as the Ramones, Blondie, The Heartbreakers, Patti Smith and Talking Heads was a sight for saw eyes, featuring some of the actual loos, set against a backdrop of graffiti walls, but thankfully without the unfortunate smells previous patrons have attested to  or as Patti Smith declared 'where all the actions happened!'It's cheeky inclusion helped bring to life the one of music's most famous, sadly now defunct musical landmarks. It's British equivalent in London - 430 King's Road, is equally successfully recreated. Run by Malcolm McLaren and then wife, Vivienne Westwood, the shop established itself as a mecca for punk fashions and cemented the reputations of McLaren and Westwood as punk fashion royalty. From this you move onto four rooms of beautifully evocative clothes. In the Temple of Dark Dreams as I called it - the transition from punk fashion's heartbeat - safety pins, spikes, studs and leather, is transformed along a boulevard of couture interpretations, set against polystyrene foam archways.  Highlights for me included  Versace's safety pin dress immortalised by Liz Hurley, vintage Givenchy, Zandra Rhodes's tear dress and a wonderful creation by Dolce and Gabana featuring a very shiny locked corset belt. I walked past Sid Vicious snaring through another giant screen and moved onto a weird gallery of disposable DIY fashions, representing both the individualism and versatility displayed by punks when expressing themselves via the clothes they wore. I marvelled at clothes made out of paper, plastic bags - look out for a particularly creative usage of bin bags and garment popper bags ! The third room was my favourite - I nicknamed it the Fashion Crypt  - at its core were four handpainted ballgowns by Dolce and Gabana, so deliciously elegant and vivid in colour they lit the room up.Surrounding the ballgowns, on the walls were clothes influenced by the slogans  and graffitti, which underlined punk. I fell in love with an exquisite Alexander McQueen splattered in acid green, yellow, black and white trapeze dress at the far end of the gallery. The final gallery 'Slasherville' focuses on the deconstruction of clothing, featuring the talents of Karl Largfeld, Moschino and Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garcon. The clothes artifully executed  the concept of something which is essentially out of the ordinary and unappealing due to its being worn, slashed and frayed, being converted into a thing of beauty. This is a must see exhibition which takes you on a fashion rollercoaster, you won't want to miss.",2,2,3,Bisi F.,"London, United Kingdom",252,59,184

But it is just a recommendation, even if the signage is somewhat misleading and the cashier is a little gruff when you hand him the few crumpled up dollar bills you have left in your pocket. The Met is one of the wealthiest cultural institutions in the US with an endowment of about 2.7 Billion - with a capital B - dollars. In 1893, New York state law mandated that the museum should be free in exchange for grants from the city and free rent for the building and land along 5th Ave. In 1970 the law changed to allow for the museum to institute a voluntary admission fee. So give them a penny, a dollar, or whatever you feel is appropriate and enjoy the glorious museum guilt free. I recently visited on a Friday evening to see the Eggleston photos, the Punk exhibit and the roof garden commission. I don't know if it is typical, but on the Friday evening I visited, the museum was very quiet, not crowded at all, which was quite pleasant. The Eggleston exhibit wasn't spectacular, but that is kind of the point of his work.

Even the way to the bathroom shows such amaing artifacts.  You eat at their overpriced crappy cafe with 2,000 year old artifacts as wall decorations.  One day, you just need to go alone with an amazing music mix.  Blast the music in your headphones and just go on your own.  It tunes out all the crap other people are saying around you, all the ambient noise and you are just honed in on just the most amazing things out there.  No matter how many times I go, I always have to make a stop in the Egyptian artifacts exhibit.  Can't be missed, EVER!",0,0,0,Johan A.,"Bronx, NY",83,9,0

Yes, I said free, not twenty-some odd dollars - you do need to check in, but you don't need to pay. You should, but you don't have to. Flush with cash? Pony up the full amount. Strapped? Throw in a buck. I paid five today. Don't worry, the land and building is rent-free from the city, and the Met's endowment is one of the strongest around, they ain't going out of business. In fact, they're now open Mondays, too. They -are- getting rid of the metal buttons, though, due to costs ... too bad. :-(You will need to make multiple visits, you can't do the whole place in a day.

It's not that much money and the museum will always have a need for funds. The best way to visit the Met is as a New Yorker, nibbling away at the exhibits bit by bit. I've probably visited a dozen or more times, and sometimes I visit my old favorites, sometimes I check out areas I have not visited in a while. There are some negatives. The crowds can be absurd. The exhibit tags are wretched and inadequate (the new Roman galleries are so lacking in any coherent information as to be embarrassingly bad in terms of scholarship). Indeed, the focus of the institution seems to be more that of preservation and presentation than education. If you do not have access to a friend with an art or history degree, you're not going to have a great time. On a quiet afternoon, it's a nice place for a date, especially if one visits the cafe.

You're bound to find something interesting along the way, in other words, it IS the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Home to two fictional children for about a month; home to a vast permanent collection of art and artifacts.Where do I recommend you go?  Fool!  Read my first two paragraphs.  If you still need some nudging, I suggest going when there is an exhibit that interests you, even just slightly.  The premise of most of their exhibits is usually thoughtful and clever.  Read the descriptions and placards, but not only.  Just look and absorb, as well.  Chances are, you'll not see anything as ingenious as some of their exhibits.  You'll most likely learn something.Beyond an exhibit, check out the ""stars of the show,"" so to speak.  Famous paintings or sculpture.  Art books don't capture color, hue, and tone properly.  Natural light on a sculpture is completely different than a set up photograph.Oh, if you happen to see the large staircase on your left when you're in the main atrium, walk behind and under it.  If you like the under-workings of buildings or look at the side of sculptures facing the wall, you'll be in for a treat.  There's a room of Egyptian antiquity that's housed in a former storage room.  It's the underside of the granite stairs, along with the brick walls that support it.  It really is fascinating.",1,2,1,Gretchen P.,"Houston, TX",223,761,294

I saw a reindeer made out of glass bubbles over in the Japanese section; I don't know what that means but it's rad. By the way, there's a vacuum cleaner in the modern design area. It's a Dyson.

Quite disappointing coming from a very well known museum. Upon entering and going through bag check, one of the security guys noticed an unopened Gatorade bottle in my fiance's backpack. Given it was like 90 degrees out, we certainly needed it for later and weren't about to ""drink it outside"" as he insisted. I mean come on, it wasn't even opened! But no, he did not care. Once we figured out how to get rid of the offending drink and get through the bag check, we finally made it to the galleries. We were met (hurr hurr) by another security guy. ""Backpack up front..."" Ok? We weren't exactly sure what he meant and proceeded to carry it as we would a normal backpack - on the back. Whoa there, no can do. That's right, ANOTHER security guy marched up to us right after we entered and rudely told us to either wear it in front (like a baby carrier) or check it. Keep in mind this was all while another guy passed us with his backpack being worn normally. He continued to walk around like that without being yelled at, and for some reason my shoulder bag was not offensive to the staff either. Yeah ok? They just hate my fiance's backpack.The museum itself is huge. We didn't even bother with a map and just wandered the place. I wish they'd keep their air conditioning consistent though, some rooms were freezing while others were fine. The collection of art is great! I mean where else can you look at 20 ""virgin and baby"" paintings in the same space? Avoid if you see buses of students outside.

5.0,5/28/2013,"I actually thought that I reviewed this place like 5 years ago, but I guess not. Therefore, I have to write something to get it off my Yelp bucket list. Oh the Met. This is the big daddy of all the museums in New York City. It trumps every other museum in sheer size, and it's also nicely located right next to Central Park. The Met is located right on 5th and 83rd. You can get here via the subway and some walking, or simply via a cab. For those who enjoy a nice little walk in the city, you can get here by walking from Central Park south within 20 minutes or so. Once you get close, you'll know when you see the Met because it's impossible to miss.The Met, just like any other museum in the city, is loaded with tourists and kids on school field trips. Unlike some of the other museums in the city, the admission here is all suggested donations. For myself, I just use my corporate membership, get in for free, and save myself the act of giving the guys at the ticketing area $1 when the suggested donation is ~$20. Nonetheless, it never stopped me before when I was a poor college student. As far as exhibits go, you can literally spend a whole day here going through everything that this museum has to offer. From the huge Egyptian section, to the amazing armor and weapons section, there really is enough here to keep everyone intrigued. With exhibits spread throughout 3 floors, you really have your work cut out for you here.One of the gems at the Met is the rooftop bar/deck. Although it's only open during selected times of the year, when it is open, this place is a must go. Not only are you able to drink, you also get to see an amazing view of Central Park, and midtown/UES. This makes a great photo op for not only tourists, but just about everyone. It is a little tricky getting up here because the elevators don't take you here, but with a little maneuvering, you'll eventually make your way here. The Met is yet another amazing museum in an equally amazing city. The sheer volume of things displayed here is out of this world, and can keep anyone engrossed for hours upon hours.

I spent over 4 hours there, they had a very large collection and diversity of the different culture, sculptures from Greek, Roman, Medieval, Pacific ocean islands (Maori, Hawaii, New Guinea etc), Northern African artifacts. It was almost watching some of items from History channel and recognizing some of the names of the famous characters. I took a lot of pictures and finished watching the whole 2nd level. Too bad, I couldn't make it to the upper levels.Minor notes -The sign on the board says Admission price was $25 but was told at the counter it was suggested price. I paid $20 and later came to know from another friend that we can give as much or as little as possible. I rather get to have a fixed price than be embarrassed giving too less but on the flip side, I wouldn't know if I would get the money's worth. My trip was totally worth it, and if I visited NYC again I will go there again.

4.0,5/13/2013,"Normally, I'd automatically choose 5 stars for The Met. I've been a few times over the years. It's beautiful. It's full of interesting and varied collections. It's generally great. BUT on my recent visit, with my visiting parents who had never been, I kept becoming quite annoyed to find whole sections closed off and cafes shut with no other notice than a small sign and a guard placed on duty at the point of closure. No notice at the entrance, nothing on the maps (the maps which are printed on a monthly-ish basis). Our visit was a few days prior to the Met Gala, and I presume this had a high chance of being the cause of so many parts of the museum being closed off. But for the price of admission, I'd at least like a head's up. My dad doesn't get around so easily these days, and I felt pretty horrid for putting him through more than one hike to a section we wanted to view only to find it closed. As someone who really enjoys museums, I often find that other large, worldly, museums just have a notice board at ticket desk when things are closed (much like a board at the theatre if understudies are going on for the evening).

5.0,5/9/2013,"My 100th review!!! I racked my brain for 2 weeks wondering which venue to review and it dawned on me... what is my absolute favorite place? The MET!I wasn't born with the creative gene in me, but that never stopped me from loving art and everything about it. The MET was always there to inspire me throughout the years - giving me that *oomph* for my art classes, taking me back in history, and opening my eyes to new explorations. The MET is simply amazing. The architecture of the building is breathtaking - the walk up along the Museum Mile gets me every single time. I always look forward to walking up the steps and through the doors. If you haven't been, take a moment to absorb the Great Hall in all its glory. The arches. The columns. Beautiful. But don't take too long. There's a lot of foot traffic and you definitely don't want to be that person who is blocking the entrance. Whenever I am at the MET, which is at least once a year, I try to take a day and spend the entire time there. If you can, you should too! Every wing is amazing. My favorites are:-Egyptian art - don't miss out on the Temple of Dendur! Better yet, get lost in it. -European Sculptures - this wing is gorgeous. Not only the sculptures are beautiful, but the way the sunlight fills up this space is perfect. -19th & Early 20th Cent European - Monet (my absolute fave), Manet, Van Gogh, Degas... need I say more? -Asian art - The Bodhisattva & Buddha gallery, the Astor Chinese Garden, and walking through a history of art from my culture. I can immerse myself in this wing forever. -American art (Cassatt), European paintings, Modern Art (Matisse & Pollack), Greek and Roman art (the Sleeping Eros!)This review is definitely longer than I expected, but the MET deserves more than just a few sentences.

The diversity of artwork is rare for a US museum. In particular, the weapons of Japan and Medieval Times are better than the collections I have seen in most museums. However, it seems that the artwork seem to curated neither chronologically nor harmonically with other work. I felt like as if I were in a large field with different patches of flowers around me. Nonetheless, among all places, I like the quad in Met the most. The sunlight coming through the ceiling, the children laughing happily, and an artist drawing the scene captures the beauty of the museum - the public's harmonious gathering and appreciation of art.Although Met is not my type of museum, it may be your type of museum where your friends of all ages would enjoy.",11,7,5,May Y.,Hong Kong,1496,198,329
4.0,5/6/2013,"The mere $20 admission cannot be considered anything but a bargain, especially if you devote an entire day to this museum, and I strongly suggest that you do. This museum is unbelievable big and has such a wide range of exhibitions that I think most people interested in art or culture will find a lot of exciting artifacts on display. I visited the museum on a Saturday, when the museum is opened until 9 PM, and even though I spent more than ten hours at the museum I had to skip a few exhibitions. Obviously I was very thorough when visiting the exhibition halls, but what is the point of rushing through a museum and not taking the time to enjoy the artwork and learn about their origins?The free and hour-long guided tours are a great way of getting acquainted with the museum collections. If you want to learn more about the objects on display I truly recommend renting an audio guide (a bargain at only $7). Hours and hours of knowledge that gives you, while walking in your own pace, the appropriate background for the artwork that you see.Something that, however, is not a bargain is the downstairs cafeteria. My general advice would be to avoid it at all cost, because the cost is all to high! This cafeteria of the museum shares a lot of similarities with my high-school cafeteria: poor food with no ambition for improvement, since enough people will eat there anyway. There are, however, some important differences between this museum cafeteria and my old high-school cafeteria: the former lacks windows and charges an almost ridiculous amount of money for its food. Simply put, the food at the MET cafeteria is poor and overpriced. I tried the chicken burger with a side salad for $13, ""cooked"" by one of the most bored restaurant workers I have ever seen. The, so called, burger was served with a disfigured hamburger bun and was only lukewarm by the time I got to a table with my tray.

It's not a big deal. - There is a rooftop restaurant and sculpture garden which is open in the summer, and is lovely. - Food at various restaurants is fairly expensive, but not obscene given the area and the cost of a hot dog just outside. - This is a gigantic Museum. If you only have a day, it's good to have a game plan. Off the bat you can go right (Egypt), left (Greece), straight (Rome/Middle Ages), or up (left: Asia, right: masterpieces of western art). I like to spend some time upstairs first, since climbing stairs and looking closely at paintings is not something you can enjoy at all if you're tired/worried about time.

The chicken was dry as a bone and tasted like cardboard, and the pesto pasta was gummy and flavorless. I expected much better. Worse, the chicken parm was advertised as a special and was supposed to be 20% off the normal price. The receipt showed no such discount. I complained to the Maitre d' who told me the bill was correct. He asked me if I'd gotten my piece of fruit, which was a part of the special. I knew nothing about the fruit and I led him to the sign which had attracted me. No mention of fruit. At that point, I was certainly not in the mood for a belated piece of fruit. OK, maybe I am spoiled by the members dining room and expecting too much from a cafeteria. But, hey, it's the Met!  I don't expect to be served cardboard and flavorless pesto pasta.

2.0,4/13/2013,"My experience at the Met was downright terrible. It was a rat maze. The rooms are poorly labeled with numbers, rendering the already-confusing map useless. My friend and I were there on a day trip and it took us nearly 45 minutes to navigate our way OUT of the museum. This is not an exaggeration. The place is also beyond jam-packed with people. Doing anything is hard. Don't judge people for photographing all the art they like; it is the only way to enjoy it beyond the cursory look you get before you are rushed out by a mob. You can go back and get a good look at it, even look it up and read about it. Too bad the Met is too busy for you to do that while you're actually there.Don't bother trying to find anything specific. You will waste nearly an hour puzzling out the maze, running into unlabeled detours that force you to backtrack, and getting jostled about. Good luck finding a bathroom after your three-hour bus ride. We were literally drawing lines on the map from the current room to our destinations. It didn't help. In the end we wasted at least two hours of our six-hour visit navigating.The security guards are exceptionally gruff. I felt like an unwelcome nuisance. My friend was told twelve times to carry her backpack in the front, yet not once during our arrival were we informed her bag would be a problem. She was miserable. She had all her day trip stuff in that bag and is a very small girl. The rude guards lack any semblance of tact. One shushed me like a kindergarten teacher when I used a normal voice in one of the galleries. Everyone looked at us and we were mildly embarrassed. I did not enjoy any of the paintings in the room after that.Speaking of the rooms themselves, many of them are non-distinct and monotonous. There were entire rooms full of paintings we backtracked through in which I did not remember a single painting, despite having viewed them all minutes earlier. I know I will get blasted for saying this, but many of the galleries are poorly arranged. The ancient, Asian art and special exhibits tended to be full of variety room for room. One moment you're looking at pottery, next some prints or drawings or even a tapestry before you come back to more pottery. However, there are ENTIRE ROOMS filled with only one kind of art of a roughly similar size. I am sorry, marble figures are beautiful. They get totally monotonous when you jam pack a room the size of a small house with them and only them. There are huge rooms with nothing. but. glass. vases. The paintings are the worst. They are just slapped on the wall one after another, all so similar in subject and style that you are surprised to learn that each is by a different artist. It's overwhelming and numbing. You leave the European and American sections without any distinct memory of what you saw. I know the galleries are arranged by period and the paintings therefore will be similar. This is exactly why a good museum breaks up this monotony by including a wide range of art and artists within a room. The Met displays seem to have been planned by someone with OCD, more like a catalogue than a curated arrangement of objects.I visit art museums often, even the tiny ones with two rooms and one special exhibit. I read art history books for fun. I had even been to the Met briefly years ago. I was excited to return for the full experience. After two hours I was bored to tears. Maybe I have been spoiled by the Boston MFA, to which I am a member. It is a far superior museum in my opinion, as they vary their displays with many kinds of art. An honorable mention is the RISD museum, though it is considerably smaller.Not only was there a lack of variety in the arrangement, but there was also a lack of variety in media. Yes, there are textiles and sculpture and design, but the collection on display is dominated by paintings and ceramics. I came here for the ceramics but some drawings would have been nice. I don't remember seeing any jewelry whatsoever. I found a grand total of one room devoted to drawing and printing. It was underwhelming. Nearly all the etchings were figurative to-boot. In fact, most of the paintings were figurative too. There are loads of beautiful works depicting architecture and landscapes out there; why is this museum so disproportionately focused on the figure? Maybe I missed the robotically categorized Romantic landscape room down the hall.If you are an art museum enthusiast, skip the Met. It is a vapid place. You will feel like an art tourist, there merely to consume as much art as you possibly can, not a person on a journey of historical discovery. Go to the MoMA like I should have. Go to the Brooklyn museum. There is nothing at the Met you haven't seen elsewhere. It is not worth the gruff security guards and mobs of people.",4,0,0,Locutus K.,"Providence, RI",0,15,0

I did not get a chance to see everything but I specially enjoyed the South Asian section which displays beautiful figurines from various parts of India. They are just gorgeous!!! I saw a few current exhibitions and they were all quite interesting specially the video called Street by a british artist. I also enjoyed the Arms and Armors sections. They have approximately 800 objects on display and it was wonderful. There is just so much to see that it's impossible to see the entire museum in a day. My advice is to pick sections you are interested in most and don't try to see everything in the museum. There are plenty of dining options inside the museum. I dined at the Petrie court cafe and wine bar. The chicken salad was delicious and fresh. Dining inside the museum is expensive. I payed $23 for a medium sized salad. There are plenty of street vendors right outside the museum steps. They sell pretzels, hot dogs and other snack food if you want the inexpensive route. Please note: There is no fee to see the museum. They have a suggested donation of $25 but that is suggested and not required. A lot of people think that is the entrance fee and end up paying $25. You can most certainly see the museum and donate just $1 also. So you are not obligated to pay $25 for each visit. They do have a membership option which is advisable if you plan to visit the museum frequently.I highly recommend the museum.

As in, it's what I've been living out of and I can't just leave it on the street. Then she wanted me to check it in the bag area which I agreed to. But, then she said I couldn't do that if I had a laptop with me. Now, I was trying very hard to work with her and wanted her to be happy but she literally almost didn't let me in. I was allowed conditional entrance as long as I carried my backpack on my side. I literally can't even comprehend what that might or might not change and I was just so tired by this point I agreed. Of course, that lasted like five minutes because it's totally bizarre. But, the art is gorgeous. And I loved the open space next to the cafe with the statues. The area that had the Cambodian reed work was absolutely sensational. That was probably my favorite part so I was bummed I couldn't photograph it. Seriously awesome.

We introduce ourselves to the chef and he was nice enough to tell us about the Prie Fixe menu they were serving for the night. One thing I do have to say is that the staff do not seem to be very knowledgeable of wine or their food. I guess the chance of Pete Wells giving them a visit is very low, so I suppose it's not required to know their menu items.

The first time I ever visited the Met, I had taken a red-eye from California and was about to fall asleep on my feet in the Temple of Dendur but found my second wind enough to explore the many marvels within the Met.The Renaissance art is truly impressive here, then there's also medieval art - stained glass windows, armor, tapestry, paintings; impressionists, Greek and Roman statuary, Old Masters including several Verrmeers, decorative art, furniture, drawings, Japanese woodblock prints, Chinese sculptures, American paintings by Homer, Singer Sargent, pre-Raphaelite works, La Farge and Tiffany stained glass, even a Frank Lloyd Wright living room.The collection is astounding, encyclopedic, and exhausting so I never try and see everything but rather I see the art that interests me because there are so many items in their collection that the entire holdings could never be on display at once. The rooftop garden provides a nice view of Manhattan on clear days and the museum store is one of the largest in the U.S. as befits a museum of this stature.

Big enough to take all day (and then some) to see everything, but small enough to find your way around.To enter, there is a recommended price of $20 for adults. I paid $5 for my donation and given the experience I wish I would have given $10. If you've never seen super famous paintings in person (Picasso, Matisse, van Gogh, etc.) or Egyptian/Greek/Tribal artifacts in person, it's well worth a higher donation price.I went during the Matisse exhibit and it was exquisite. My favorite painting, however, was ""Self-Portrait with Straw Hat"" by Vincent van Gogh. The colors and pattern in this piece was breathtaking and the fact that it wasn't behind glass and was sitting on a podium all alone made it that much better. A pro tip: Don't wear a backpack. I unfortunately had no museum training so I was told by an employee to remove my backpack and wear it on my chest.

4.0,2/21/2013,"This museum is overwhelming. It is an enormous collection. The Egyptian Temple of Dendur is awesome. The museum employee working next to the temple was very friendly and offered to take photos for anyone who came along. Considering this is New York City,  I was impressed.As with any large museum, it was very crowded. We got there at 2:00. The coat check line was ridiculously long.  So, we hung onto our coats. We entered at the south entrance/ between 80th and 81st (Ruth and Harold D. Uris center for education.) There was a good size line. We had our city passes out an an employee took care of us without waiting in line. Which was fantastic! We went upstairs to the 1st floor in the Greek and Roman art away from the main entrance crowds. This wasn't my first time here. If the main entrance is a big deal for you, take a picture on the way out. There are frequent maps on the wall displaying your location. Rooms are marked on the archways. Keep your map on hand. There are many souvenir purchasing oppurtunities. Too many. If I want a book or a coffee mug of my favorite painting , I don't need to trip into it leaving a gallery. All in all a good museum. Definitely worth visiting. The highlight was three Faberge eggs on display.",1,0,0,Amy D.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",92,117,332

I often felt like a rat in a maze trying to find a priceless piece of art in a gallery that often only had one small hidden entrence. Bring your walking shoes, check everything you can.

A tiny ""sandwich"" with super salty smoked salmon on a miniature bun was $10--and the homemade ""style"" potato chips were soggy, ugh!  We also ordered ""tea sandwiches"" which comprised three 1"" x 1"" (if they were that big...) sandwiches with a lot of bread and almost nothing inside them.  $9.  Really, there is no excuse for that these days in Manhattan.  We also ordered the small pastries.  They were uniformly bad.  Too sweet, soggy, limp, or tasteless.  They didn't seem fresh--more like something they keep frozen(?) and the quality of the dough used was very poor.  Again, for the price, quite surprising.The wait-staff were very solicitous.  It isn't their fault the place has such a ridiculous menu at such high prices.  I would barely call these items ""snacks""--and if they really are snacks, they should cost at least 50% less.I really hope they change the menu fast because it is a lovely environment otherwise.  Just visit the loo before-hand!",1,0,0,L H.,"New York, NY",0,23,2

You'll still miss some rooms but you can probably get to most of what you're interested in.I won't go over the different exhibits because many other people have done so.

5.0,1/8/2013,"This is the most encyclopedic collection of art in the world.  I don't think that can be argued.  I've been to many art museums--nay, I've been to many MUSEUMS--and I can say that this one has probably the most extensive collection I've ever seen.That's not to say that all of the quality of all of the pieces is equally amazing.  As it seems with any large art museum, there's some pieces that are truly better than others.  But there's certainly something for everyone here.  This leads me to my first piece of advice.The Met is probably too big.  You could spend literally a month here and not be able to truly appreciate everything.  I find this super frustrating.  So, my first bit of advice is to GO IN WITH A GAME PLAN.  There's going to be some items in this museum that you're going to appreciate more than others.  Try to know what your tastes are, and make sure to know what's where prior to visiting the galleries to minimize walk time.That kind of takes me to my second piece of advice.  Especially if you don't really know what you're looking for, just start walking around, taking it all in quickly.  When you start getting sucked into some of the paintings and reading more about them, you're going to get tired.  Walk through the adjacent galleries and get a feel of the overall galleries, and then return to where you were.  That way, you'll see more, and it will make the experience a bit less overwhelming.  But if it was ever a fair metaphor to equate seeing an art museum to running a marathon, you're in the right place.  Stay paced, keep moving, and try to not fall into the trap of look at painting, read description, then move to the next painting.Every one of the greatest artists in the world is represented here, and the collection spans from pre-history to modern art.  From Giotto to Rothko and beyond, they're all here.  Also from musical instruments to guns to sections of church buildings, you'll find them here.Time wise, allow the entire day (and perhaps multiple days) depending on how much you like art and what you would like to see.  Admission isn't cheap, but I believe it's a suggested donation.  (You feel super cheap if you don't pay the recommended value.)If you could only go to one museum in New York's museum mile, this should be it.  I'd put the Frick in second place, followed by the Guggenheim.  I'd say the Whitney comes in at a distant fourth, though that may have been because I think a lot of their art was on loan.  Unlike the Guggenheim, Frick, and Whitney, photography is allowed here, except in special exhibits and where it is marked otherwise.",1,0,0,Joe K.,"Dallas, TX",193,445,121

There's not that much art here but it's gorgeously designed and a beautiful place to sit down and take a breather in the middle of the day.

Being steeped in a work environment that pays daily homage to the gods of science and technology, I like to come here every once in a while to get some culture and what not cuz, you know, that's just how I roll - well-rounded. *pun-totally-intended*That being said, I think the Egyptian temple is overrated. *gasp of horror* Not to say that it's not great but it's almost like people go to the Met just for this one exhibit, when in fact, the entire museum is a palace of priceless works of art. *Steps off high horse*My personal favorites are the sculpture garden and some of the late renaissance paintings. The weapons exhibit here makes my inner 12 year old gush with boyish glee while the story behind how the Chinese garden was built has instilled in me a new pride in ancient Chinese architecture.I have to say that the suggested donation of $20 is a little steep. I usually pose as a student - hey, it wasn't THAT long ago - and try to get in for $10. Now, since it's supposedly just a suggested donation, you can, in actuality, pay whatever you want.

I'm jealous of my friends who have are able to visit as much as they like!The Matisse exhibit was extremely well done. Usually when I visit a travelling exhibit, I'm overwhelmed by all the reading, crowds, artwork, etc. But this was laid out perfectly. I was able to read and retain what I read and enjoyed how this exhibit was set up in a series of progressive pieces. The rest of the exhibits were amazing.

Seems a shame they keep that fact a bit secretive though.The coat check downstairs was a bit of a zoo, and the guy who took our coats seemed put out by the whole thing. But once through that mess, we made our way straight to the cafeteria for some fuel. The selection options were outstanding and impressive - everything from sushi to entrees to sandwiches to a pay-per-ounce salad bar and antipasti bar. Fearing I would have broke the bank on the latter once I got to the register, I was pleasantly surprised that it cost less than anticipated. Plus since we cheaped out on the admission, I felt OK paying high prices for our food.It's impossible to see everything here in one day,let alone the few hours we had here. We focused on the egyptian mummies / temples / etc. and made our way through the American Wing with the recreations of domeciles at various times during the last few hundred years.

Undoubtedly the Met is one of the greatest museums on earth; the sheer size of the museum itself is telling of the vast art collection that this museum has. Of course the european collections were popular, with old masters' works by likes of Van Gogh, Matisse, etc.  However, make sure to check out other sections as well (although it would be hard to fully navigate the entire museum in one day); the greek section has great amount of classical statues and sculptures, so beautiful. The Egyptian section was amazing as well, with entire temples, hieroglyphics, statues, mummies. Breathtaking. Finally, I had the pleasure of viewing special exhibit about Andy Warhol's influence on modern art. I took art history class 2 semesters before about contemporary art, and literally all of those famous art works were in the exhibit, from Jeff Koons to Cindy Sherman to Felix Gonzales-Torres' candy work to Baldessari and Ruscha. It was so amazing to see in person these significant works of art. Location wise, I personally found the Met bit hard to get to, that's because the subway to upper east side requires lots of transfer and bit of walking.

5.0,12/17/2012,"One of the world's great museums.  Why write yet another review?  To clarify one important point:  why this museum has a ""suggested"" admission fee.Here is what one of the NYC websites writes:  ""In order to make museums affordable for all, these museums have 'suggested' admissions.  That means you can pay the amount of admission that you can afford and still enjoy access to the museum.""Hogwash.NYC's institutions have many admirable, wonderful qualities, but generosity and concerns about affordability for the masses are not two of them.  The museums have ""suggested"" admission fees because they have to.  They are on public land.  Both the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Museum of Natural History reside on the city's land, not theirs.Similar to avaricious beach clubs with a strip of tidal sand by the ocean, these museums would love to charge you and me.  But they cannot by law.  MoMA can because it *owns* the building and land in and on which it resides.Between their blockbuster special exhibits, their licenses, admissions people offer, gift shop and cafe receipts, grants, donations, and most of all endowment, the Met has more money than Croesus.   Their director is paid a cool million a year, down from a peak of $5.5M/year.  From Wikipedia:""The City of New York owns the museum building and contributes utilities, heat, and some of the cost of guardianship [~$25M/year]...he 2009-10 operating budget was $221 million. The museum's endowment is $2-3 billion and provides much of the income for operations while admissions account for only 15%...The Met is reported to have the best credit rating by far of all major museums in the United States.""Paying the full-suggested price is a generous action for those who can afford it.  Smarter probably, if you're a regular attendee, is to donate to the museum and deduct it.  For those whom $25 is a hardship, don't pay it and don't feel guilty.",9,0,3,Steve F.,"Singapore, Singapore",2,70,0

Every painting looked like it was done by a autistic 5 year old. It's just my opinion, there's just no wow factor when viewing his artwork.As for the rest of the museum, same old. I finally checked out some of the medieval stuff. The knights, armor, chainmail, and weapons were pretty interesting. The art from asia at the Met is pretty weak. The ""chinese garden"" or whatever they call it, I think it's a really lame boring stereotypical display of just nothing. If you're looking for a quiet restroom, goto the second floor to the asian part. There's no line!Verdict - Still a great place to kill 3-4 hours of your day and a fun place to test out your new camera. There is no photography allowed in certain exhibits.

5.0,11/7/2012,"During my childhood I was a regular visitor of the other great museum across from the Met, but after graduating from high school I've been increasingly pulled into this museum, and not just because I'm playing tour guide to friends and family from out of town.  The breadth of unique interior spaces at the Met is absolutely incredible, and a welcome oasis for any native New Yorker trying to get through the city's never-ending rat race.I just wanted to list 4 places that I consider the best spots in the museum for taking a mental staycation.1) The Temple of Dendur - This exhibit is where I always make a beeline to when I enter the museum.  It's a great indoor space as the combination of the vaulted ceiling and the gigantic glass window facing the park is awe inspiring.  The serene pool/moat that surrounds the actual temple itself is very soothing, and I enjoy just sitting on the short wall to read.2) Circular Versailles Mural Room - If you can't make the trip out to Versailles this is the next best thing.  It's better than watching a video recording or a photo of it because it is presented in its full panoramic glory in a circular room.  I also get an absolute kick in the level of detail that the artist incorporated into the mural.  When I show friends this room for the first time, I always tell them to enter the room with their eyes closed and open them when they're in the center of the room.3) European Sculpture Hall - This is another great place to read and relax, as the glass ceiling above you makes you think you're outdoors in a climate controlled environment.  The sculptures here are all masterpieces and you there to keep you company when you need an eye candy break.4) Chinese Courtyard - This is another excellent place to rest as there is a stone pond that gives it that nice bubbling brook audio ambiance.  Courtyards like this were used like suburban backyards today, but this one is great at transporting you to the past to boot.",2,0,1,Keith O.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",46,140,7

5.0,11/1/2012,"I know absolutely nothing about art. I forgot all of the art terminology I learned in middle school. However, after Hurricane Sandy, half of the city was shut down. My law school was closed for most of the week. Since I had nothing to do, I had two choices: spend all day on Facebook or go to a museum. I chose the latter. I've been to the famous museum on the other side of Central Park on numerous occasions. Today, I decided to try something different. As many people have said, admission is suggested donation. The listed price is $25. I paid $5. I figured that some old rich person like Brooke Astor donated a lot of money to this museum so it's ok if a poor student like myself pays less than the full price. I was too lazy to read a map, so I decided to meander through the museum and take pictures of things that I thought were interesting. My favorite exhibits on the 1st floor were the Egyptian sarcophagus and tomb. I also liked the medieval exhibits, including the mounted knight. It took me a while to figure out how to get to the 2nd floor. Once I got there, it was worth it. The Japanese garden is beautiful.The 4th floor of the museum is actually the rooftop. It offers a panoramic view of the Manhattan skyline, including Central Park and Midtown. This is much cheaper than going to the Top of the Rock. After passing by the Spanish gallery, I called it a day. I spent an hour and a half here. I didn't read the captions of the exhibits. I only took pictures. Even a person like myself who has no interest in art found this museum to be somewhat interesting.  I can't comment on the food since I ate before going here.

If you want to take your time and go for an hour or two or at a time and see the museum more closely over time I would suggest getting the $70 year pass or just paying $5-$15 each time (if $$ is an issue). If you are just visiting the area and don't have a ton of time to designate to the Met, I suggest you take advantage of their ""Highlights"" tour because it can be overwhelming to try to navigate through the museum quickly.

5.0,8/22/2012,"What can you say about this nation's flagship art museum, one of the finest in the world, and perhaps the greatest art-history survey museum anywhere, ever.For starters, you can warn visitors: this is too much to see in a half-day, or a day, or even a week, or forever. By the time you finished even a cursory glance at everything, more would have been added, and you'd have to start over. Face it: you ain't gonna be able to see all of it. It's that simple. But for one-day visitors, I can guide you to the highlights you don't want to miss. Most are on the first floor. Walk through the Egyptian wing, quickly; don't pause to examine every exhibit, or you'll be there a month or more. You don't want to miss the original-and-reassembled tombs (two) nor the original-and-reassembled temple. By now you've spent some two hours, and paid little heed to most exhibits.Exit Egypt to the new American wing, and admire all the masterpieces in the courtyard there. Another hour. You've time still before lunch to investigate either the medieval galleries, the Greco-Roman galleries, or the Petrie Sculpture Court. Enjoy lunch  at the Petrie Court Wine Bar, the American Wing Cafe, or the Great Hall Balcony Bar, or the (oh-so-classy) cafeteria. Or if you've access, take reservations at the Member's Room for a fine-dining option. Back to highlights: don't miss the Rodin and Canova sculptures in the Petrie Court (and upstairs nearby). Visit the Greco-Roman galleries, and look for the tiny ""harp player"" in the Cycladic-culture room, one of the rarest objects in the world. You'll pass through the centrally-located Medieval/Byzantine galleries; the Byzantine portions,  located alongside the Great Hall staircase, are particularly interesting. A visit to the Robert Lehman Gallery, a triangular annex at the rear of the first floor, should do you for just one day. But if you've time, or if it is Friday (a late day for the museum), head upstairs to the European painting gallery to see all the masterpieces by Breugel, Tiepolo, Caravaggio, etc. These are all the ""old masters"" everyone references; here's your chance to see some of them for yourself. (The purported ""early Michelangelo"" sculpture is no longer on display. I saw it. It was unimpressive, and the documentation that it was by Michelangelo was doubtful anyway.)If you've not visited before, it's hard to grasp how vast the museum is.

5.0,8/21/2012,"Yes. Among all of the five stars reviews, but I still want to review this museum. This is the magic of it.For any travelers, I believe, it's worth a visit. Even for residents, actually. The permanent halls are very well constructed and established with tons of gorgeous works that you would not want to miss in your life on earth. These pieces, to be honest, I would view again and again without feeling dull or boring.Their period ongoing exhibit programs are totally amazing as well. When I was there, the Prada show was on. It was breathe taking. Installation of movie screens, that made me felt like real size, watching unbelievable and almost impossible conversation between Schiaparelli and Prada. In the show hall, series of classic designs were astonishing installed.Architecture is fabulous of this museum. Each hall has got it's own fantastic style. I felt like in a British mansion in England when I was walking through those tons of beautiful and graceful sculptures, and all the sudden, I walked in the Egypt hall with huge glasses window which I got a magnificent view of central park and some buildings far yet ancient outside. Like a paint inside, like one through the window outside too. The staff working there are very friendly too. It was raining the day I visited. My umbrella was wet while i don't have anything else to check in only with my purse. They were so patient and gentle there just pack my little umbrella and stored it very well until i went back to get it hours after. I'd go and visit again next time when I am in NYC for sure.

Absolutely horrific. It was dirty, smelly, and trash all over the floor. Come on. Anyway, I tried to redeem my experience with the exhibits. With it being so big it is easy to get lost, even though we had a map. No one helped us, even when we asked. It was obvious that the staff did not want to be there which kind of put a damper on the experience.

5.0,7/4/2012,"Too much to see and too little time, is what you're going to be faced with when you come here, but really, this is THE BEST art museum in the U.S. of A.  I especially liked the Greek and Roman Sculptures, the armors and the Impressionist paintings.  I spent about two 2.5 hours here (which is definitely not enough) and got lost in parts of the areas where all the paintings are located, since it was so vast and at times confusing to navigate.  I really wish I was able to go to the Roof Garden and at least check out the Egyptian Art - due to time constraints, I missed those, along with many other parts of this mammoth museum.  There are numerous employees wearing black located throughout and they have a large gift store with such a variety of stuff to buy, and although most items are a bit pricey, I picked out some items to remember my time here.  Very nice that this place is located where Central Park is.  If you are visiting NY, please put this on your top 10 list of places to check out, you will be amazed at what this place has to offer.",1,2,2,Kahanalei M.,"San Francisco, CA",274,193,650
5.0,7/4/2012,"I've actually been a member of this museum for several years. What I really enjoy about this museum are two things in particular 1) Some of the exhibits are in a very unique setting.For example, the temple of Dendur is set by water, with a few plants, and a large full window next to it. Or you can see carvings in the wall and ceiling in the middle Eastern section.2) Tours by the docents.  Some of these volunteers can make your entire trip there worthwhile. For example, one man gave a tour of the music section and pulled out recordings of some of the instruments that he played for us. In the middle eastern section, there was a woman who was so enthusiastic, it just made the visit to that section a delight.Thank you, MET, for being a great museum and keep up the great work.",0,0,0,Susan S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0

The exhibits are quite impressive, and from one room to the next you are seeing history and displays that span millenna. The hard part is you cannot appreciate everything in one day - there is just so much! So get there early, have a plan for what you would like to see, and wear comfortable shoes. Of particular quality are the Ancient Egypt, Rome, and Greece areas. These were the most impressive and awe-inspiring. Also of note are the Medieval art, musical instruments, and armory (my favorite) exhibits. There is certainly something here for everyone, but make plans because you need to budget your time to appreciate what you are seeing. They give you a pin so you can walk out for lunch or a break. There are vendors outside, cafes on the Upper East side close by.Overall: World-class museum, a must see for NYC visitors. Get there when it opens and make a plan for what to see!

It has entire rooms in the arts&crafts/craftsman style. There is also a great visual storage area where you can see what's not on display and its really great stuff: everything from doorknobs to Whistler and Sargeant.If I could suggest one thing, it would be a lighter pocket guide for the museum in general, and wifi throughout.

I love them and always try to pay the full fee but it enables me to visit with friends or visitors who may not be able to afford their full fee.

Believe you me, if you are a tourist visiting the MET for the first time, please do not underestimate the MET. You will not even see a tenth of it in a couple of hours. Please plan on spending a whole day here to truly experience the museum. I have been to the J. Paul Getty museum and the Getty Villa in L.A., and the National Museums in D.C., but none of those hold a candle to the New York MET.My favorite galleries by far are the art galleries. I know most people enjoy the Egyptian gallery, but I've never really been a huge fan of Egyptology. I've never seen so may Picasso's, Matisse's, Monet's, Manet's, Dali's, and Van Gogh's (my favorite artist) in one day. If I have to choose one particular art work, then I would say Madonna by Dali is my favorite at this museum.

We did the audio tour, and - rather than something stodgy and jargon-filled - the Met audio tour was constantly asking you to interact with the piece, studying it in various ways, learning about the context and everything. It was like having the most awesome Art History teacher living in your ears.The only problem at the Met is TIME. There is just SO MUCH to visit that you end up feeling overwhelmed and rushed.

If only I had been lucky enough to visit at a time where they actually filmed a scene (which I think they did...a couple of days later...sigh). Fitting in the Met during our NYC tour was a bit challenging because we knew we wanted to allot a huge chunk of time, didn't want to go during the weekend, or on a day where there was sunshine & great weather (our initial designated day was towards the earlier part of our trip but the weather turned out gorgeous and you definitely want to maximize your awesome weather outdoor time during a trip in mid Feb!). So we ended up spending Valentine's Day 2012 (a Tuesday) at the Met, and to our pleasant surprise, it wasn't crowded at all (even our tour guide mentioned how low the count was). I'm not a huge art fan (I unfortunately lack the appreciation), so going on a tour really helped since I enjoy the historical component immensely. Since there are so many things to see, bf and I separated for most of the day so we could wander freely throughout the museum (my 1st time). The museum did feel a bit overwhelming for me.

4.0,5/5/2012,"Not much to add that hasn't been said by the hundreds of other reviewers.  It's the Met.  It's massive, with an extensive collection of varied pieces including some really famous paintings.  This was my second visit and I still haven't seen everything.  It was my boyfriend's first time there and, when talking about it later, he said he didn't care for it as much as he had expected to.  He said it really seemed to focus on being *The Met*.  For him, it felt so much like ""here is Egypt, as seen by the Met"" instead of ""here are some pieces from Egypt"", which is what he's accustomed to from the Smithsonian (we live just outside DC).  We had a history buff with us who has a strong knowledge of Egypt -- we both learned infinitely more from him than from the museum exhibits.  (Though, to be fair, it is an art museum, not a history one.)Definitely worth the trip, though, as there are some beautiful pieces and, as stated, it's just an enormous collection.",0,0,0,Laura W.,"Annandale, VA",127,324,46
5.0,5/3/2012,"As others have stated, the museum is enormous; I've visited several times in recent memory (and several times as a kid), but still haven't seen everything on display. Visitors are treated to everything from the Old Masters to the Egyptian Temple of Dendur to costumes - it's remarkable. I always enjoy visiting at Christmastime, when they display a huge Christmas tree in the Great Hall. All of this doesn't even touch the collection at The Cloisters, of course.If you have your choice of days/times to visit and dislike crowds, I'd suggest avoiding weekends as well as school holidays (Presidents' Week, Easter/Passover week, winter break).

5.0,5/2/2012,"Visiting the Met for the first time, I was certainly prepared for a collection of extraordinary depth and breadth, and I even restricted my four-hour visit primarily to the path laid out in the Director's Tour, with an occasional detour should something catch my eye.  What I wasn't prepared for was the superb job the Met does in presenting its collection (fully knowledgeable that the displayed collection is only a fraction of the museum's entire collection).  Rooms were brilliantly put together--the Charles Englehard Court, the Leon Levy and Shelby White Court, the Jan Mitchell Treasury, the Temple of Dendur, and the American Art period rooms come to mind.  The Met also resists the temptation to overfill its display cases with works like I have seen at some even top tier museums.  Every work and piece of art seems to be displayed with proper respect.As far as personal highlights, the collection of Renoirs is amazing--""Two Young Girls at the Piano,"" ""The Daughters of Catulle Mendes,"" and ""Madame Georges Charpentier and Her Children"" were personal favorites.  I was also personally impressed by the Middle Eastern contemporary piece ""Still Garden"" by Afruz Amighi, though I question whether it is being optimally displayed.",1,0,1,Jason V.,"Cleveland, OH",22,290,5
4.0,5/2/2012,"This museum is huge (quarter-mile long) and should be your first stop for art in NY (or the US). I move very quickly through museums and still didn't see everything in the five hours I allotted. To see the whole museum would probably require 6-7 hours moving very quickly and closer to 11-12 hours moving like the average viewer. Seeing just the 19th century to modern art sections probably takes a couple hours, with another couple hours needed to see the earlier European art.I did have a few complaints about the museum facilities. Given the size of the museum (over 2 million sq. ft.), they should really have more than two water fountains. It is also quite inconvenient (even if done for security reasons) for them to close the bathrooms before the museum's close time. Also, part of the modern art and Asian art sections were closed - when I asked why, I was told it was because they didn't have enough security personnel to keep the whole museum open. Even if that's true, they should really close down a different section than part of the modern art collection.

Without some direction, children seem to be just overwhelmed by the size of the building and number of objects, and underwhelmed by seeing yet another painting. If you didn't have time to prepare them, here are some isolated and varied interesting areas to visit - The Chinese scholars garden, built in the 1970's by Chinese craftsmen as relations between the USA and China were beginning to thaw, this garden is a lovely, quiet spot with a small koi pool with actual live fish; -  period rooms in and near the American wing, including a reconstructed ballroom that George Washington probably visited, as well as the silver exhibits including articles crafted by Paul Revere;- period rooms on the main floor,near the mediieval wing,  including 18th century pre-revolutionary French rooms,English aristocratic interiors down to the authentic plasterwork, a shop exterior from Paris, an ooh la la boudoir or two;- a trompe l'oeil wooden room from Italy in the medieval wing and adjacent period rooms from the 17th century;- Arms and armory, with armor from Europe, Japan, America and Turkey for people, horses, children, etc. - Musical instruments gallery 2nd floor above armor - check calendar for the monthly organ recital in the balcony area.- Drawings and and photography galleries with changing exhibitions up the main staircase and take a hard left; continue in that direction for Impressionist paintings. - European paintings up the main staircase is a vast series of galleries. Painters had to advertise their level of skill (see Lady with a black fan against her black dress) and please their patrons although a number of the portraits manage to make a joke at the subject's expense (see one very large Portrait of a Young man beside his horse) There is lots more of this, especially in the Dutch and French galleries- Medieval wing in December for the annual Christmas tree and Neapolitan creche and piped in music.The Eqyptian wing tends to be crowded and after you have seen it, the American wing is not far away, The upper levels of the American Wing are interesting and often underpopulated and a good introduction to early American domestic life. If you have a particular interest in a particular part of the world including India, Korea, China, Japan,the continent of Africa, Oceania, Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, there are stunning collections to visit.   The entrance rotunda information desk can make coin change for you if you intend to board a MTA Fifth Avenue bus after leaving the museum and don't have a Metrocard.",0,0,0,G W.,"New York, NY",0,73,0
5.0,4/3/2012,"I think this is the best museum I've ever visited...so far. I like going to museums in any city I visit, so sometimes one museum visit blurs into another. However, this particular museum stands out because of its sheer breadth and the quality of its exhibits. It was a little claustrophobic in the great hall because it was raining heavily when we visited; every tourist seemed to be milling around inside, hiding from the heavy torrent outside. But, once you're inside, you can escape the crowds and lose yourself in a world of beautiful paintings, exquisite artifacts, imposing statues (can't miss, these HUGE Buddha statue in the Asian antiquities gallery and, of course, the pyramids), and awe-inspiring art. I agree one should spend more than a day to explore this place; I had to leave after a mere 3 hours...seems like a long time to spend walking around a museum, but not when there are so many worthwhile things to see.

You could spend an entire day here and only take in a fraction of the collection on display. As it was, we spent three hours and left feeling awed, impressed and overwhelmed.The first thing we did when we arrived was to get a (free) guided museum highlights tour. This tour sped us around the museum showing us some of the most famous sites, including the Temple of Dandur which is an entire temple transplanted from Egypt to the museum housed in a room whose scale is so massive that the temple seems tiny. I highly recommend taking one of the guided tours, as the museum is so large that it's hard to get a feel for where to start. The tour lets you get a quick view of many sections of the museum so you can then decide what you want to go back and spend more time looking at.It's hard to know what to talk about with a museum of this size - there are ancient artifacts, instruments, egyptian mummies, sarcophagi, asian art, suits of armor, weaponry, incredible sculptures and paintings by old and new masters. No matter what time period or geographical region you are interested in, the Met will astound you. We were surprised that we really enjoyed the modern art gallery, given that we aren't usually modern art enthusiasts.The museum isn't without it's flaws - it was almost impossible to find a bathroom and I ended up walking into a random office and begging someone to show me where it was (the one we walked forever on the map to get to was out of order).

I had only about an hour, but what a glorious time it was! (I feel very 1800s writing that, but retro is a thing, right? Right??)My friend and I spent most of our time in the American section because I am a US history nut. I knew I wanted to see the CROSSING OF THE DELAWARE!!! And I did. Before we got there, we saw a few interesting colonial paintings - mostly portraits, totally interesting. :) There are a few original Gilbert Stuart paintings of George Washington himself!Then, my (art history major in college) friend told me to look to my left. Oh, it was the CROSSING OF THE DELAWARE. I think my heart stopped for a few seconds/I felt the world spin around me/unicorns emerged from the earth. So exciting. The painting is huge and really just something you have to experience in person (hay cliches). We had a bit of extra time and saw a temple that has been brought in from 15 BC or something crazayy.

Extra points to the Met for a sense of order despite the crowds, easy layout, and a gift shop that some of my friends cleaned up at. (Seriously, though, if I were buying a silk scarf, I'd take a second look at the Met's reasonably priced offerings.)

4.0,2/4/2012,"Spent a recent afternoon looking at all the stuff we've stolen, especially from the third world.  Seriously, many of the foreign exhibitions are filled with essentially stolen artifacts.  European paintings aside (and I've even read some stuff about the Holocaust re them), the museum and those who lend pieces to it did not pay fair market value for much of their stuff, I assure you.  When I look at an ancient ossuary, I think about what was done with the remains inside and did the party who acquired and is now claiming ownership of it even have an agreement with the landowner or country it came from?  I believe answers to these questions generally do not work out in favor of the underdog.That said, the Islamic galleries live up to the hype.  They are well-curated although I personally would have left some of the rugs out.  Some are nothing special.  Breezed through the modern art section - meh.  A few representative pieces but their collection obviously pales in comparison to that museum some 30 blocks south.  Didn't enjoy their Jackson Pollocks that much (MoMA has One, which is his best IMO), but they do have a nice Lee Krasner.  While obviously overshadowed by her husband, I do think she was the better artist and actually defined the style he used ad nauseam.  The African galleries seem to have a strong focus on the western and central part of that continent.  They have just a few pieces from the Lalibela area of Ethiopia - a place whose Orthodox Catholic history is rarely taught to most westerners but is very interesting.I'll agree that this can be a useful place to spend an afternoon.  Just know what you are looking at.",1,1,0,Van N.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",8,68,0

In addition, many of the objects that were small were displayed on the floor making the bases difficult to see and 6 foot tall chests were elevated so the tops were invisible.As usual, the rooms are like a maze. It is impossible to explore all of the rooms without a map as most rooms are unlabeled (except for small room number) unless you use the electronic signs.

The cafe is waaaaay overpriced, but it could be an inspiring place to hang out once on a while (especially on a date in the fall season).I only wish they had a better entrance policy for all residents.

5.0,10/25/2011,"Probably one of my top 5 museums of all time. Runs up there compared with the Chicago Institute of Art, and the Musee d'Orsay.The amount of stuff here for the price of the ticket makes this a great deal. It's $25 for regular admission, $17 for seniors, $12 for students and kids are free. But the amount of stuff here makes it like a mini-Louvre, but without actually flying across the Atlantic to see those stuff in Paris. So in reality, you're saving like $1000 for going here compared to the Louvre. Your welcome.The enormity of this place will require you to take their complimentary map to follow along. Yep, they have a map. That's how big it is. My time was limited but I did focus on my favorite stuff, European Paintings (Renaissance), Greek and Roman Art, Egyptian and Medieval Art, Modern and contemporary art and finally the 19th and early 20th century European paintings and sculpture.I underestimated this place. For a person to block 2 hours of their time here expecting to see everything is just a huge mistake. Even with my favorites listed above, I had to do an expedited tour. And there was at least 20 other exhibits that I just had to forgo.So the MET, besides being a ginormous museum, there is really no logical path to go from one exhibit to the next. Those are the only faults I saw in this place. But they have it all and that's what really matters.

The wing with the Roman sculpture is splendid: flooded with light, the objects are illuminated and so gorgeous it's hard not to touch them. The Egyptian collection is quite impressive, as well.

Just like the Natural History Museum, its entrance steps leads you up to the doors that will expose your imagination to the arts of many generations worldwide.Prior to college I would only visit the Met once in a blue-moon, which is odd for someone who's natural-born talent is art, lol. But, during college I would go multiple times a semester. Now after college, it's more of a balance game...going when time allows you.Greco-Roman and South-Asian exhibits really are awe inspiring. When you just want to sketch and lock-in the artworks of history's masters, there is no better place than the Met. Entering a minimalistic room and seeing a giant Greco-Roman statue standing in front of you, larger than life, is an amazing feeling. Then just a wing/floor away, are smaller, more delicate pieces of artwork. Who's simple, yet beautiful brush strokes combine to form masterpieces that span not just time, but periods in our history with stories to tell that vary from piece to piece.Speaking of, the Summer & Autumn Japanese gallery was really amazing. Not just the great ink & scroll (or in some cases, paper/silk) designs, but the magnificent trinkets and ornamental pieces were so beautiful to look at.

This display represented the epitome of fashion! You enter a dark room with eerie music, raven caws and wind machines.... The mannequins wear everything from tailored sexy curvaceous blazers to dresses embroidered with flowers, resin, sea shells, lace and ostrich feathers. All of the ladies wearing masochistic head coverings and ""ga ga-ish"" stacked pumps and booties. I'm not sure where or if the exhibit will travel next but I heard it ranked one of the top 4 in all of the MET exhibits including Picasso. Some of the most reputable fashion magazines approached this man yet they were too ""mainstream"" for him. What an amazing tribute he left to captivate so many people from all over the world! I can't say I recommend this exhibit for small children as it may scare them.... I bought the coffee table book for my sister and a wardrobe consultant which is available on-line. It features most all, if not all of the costumes. If you missed the exhibit, you must find a way to go wherever it travels next! What a shame to have lost such an incredible fashion icon.

4.0,8/1/2011,"Probably the go-to museum in Manhattan for tourists and museum-goers. A big reason why I wouldn't give it 5 stars: I think the museum advertises the ""donation suggested"" entrance fee deceptively. Most tourists think they HAVE to pay the suggested amount. I saw lines that were for credit cards only. Employees use the word ""pay"" when saying you have to ""pay a suggested donation"" (Why not say you have to go over to the line to GIVE a suggested donation and get your pin?). And I've heard they give you the evil eye if you donate only a few dollars.Luckily due to his employer my boyfriend and I were able to skip the entrance lines and get a pin in less than 2 min. However we came on a Saturday afternoon to specifically see the McQueen exhibit (I dragged him along). We waited for nearly 2 hours to get to the exhibit and while in there it was impossible to move and read the captions that accompanied each design.

Boo!  I once watched a humorous interview done by the one and only Stephen Colbert on Director Thomas Campbell and basically, the main point Mr. Colbert made was, if you like a particular piece of art, be sure to lick it!Yes, I would have done so had I seen that interview prior! Rats!I'm sure everyone has already mentioned about how massive the museum is, the number of galleries and exhibits, but what specifically grabbed my attention were the artworks of the many famous impressionists such as my favorite painter: Vincent Van Gogh! It's easy to misspell his last name, believe me! I was dinged on it once when I committed that crime on a Facebook caption.  Still haunts me!yelp.com/biz_photos/jVnc…I must say, the creative and unique style of art drawn by an Impressionist has really become an eye candy phenomenon for me personally.  Any museum that treasure these, I will most likely enjoy.Although Egyptian art is quite impressive if never seen, its not so much of a main attraction for me anymore, having seen them so many times at the other big museums outside the US.  However, I always enjoyed one particular room of grand scale and finish!  The Temple of Dendur, surrounded by a modern-esque water way where you can sit close to and ponder! Explore inside the miniature temple and feel like Indiana Jones! The one thing that impresses me the most is how they managed to bring in original, massive architectural pieces into the museum.  To clarify, we are talking a couple story high exterior historic art.  I think doing so adds sex appeal as visitors transition from one room to the next.  I know its such a weird term to use, but its quite true! ;-pAll of this art critiquing can be really exhausting so why not head up to the very top of the museum to relax and unwind.  Once there, feast your eyes on the city skyline and partially Central Park proper.  Depending on the day of the week, there's opportunity to people watch or just strike a storytelling with the NY socialite you're standing next to or perhaps that goofy tourist with his big telescopic camera (me). *kidding, of course not me* ;-)s3-media3.px.yelpcdn.com…Rest assure, there are alcoholic options to be had!

Quite an experience.Admission prices are arbitrary as they are all ""suggested."" There are separate lines for cash and credit. I always feel kind of awkward using credit when I don't feel like paying the full suggested 20. You can tell them how much to charge, but it seems almost tacky.

I'll definitely be coming back here!Ticket prices are by donation; with suggested pricing.Random thing... so the Met has a mascot which is a bright blue Egyptian hippo carving named ""William."" I went on a search to find William after hearing about him. Expecting that he was close to lifesized or at least 2 feet long, I searched high and low for him in the Egyptian Wing. No avail... in the end a docent laughed and led me to the William display - he's only about 3 inches long!",5,3,4,Vicky L.,"Palo Alto, CA",862,1701,160

5.0,6/15/2011,"The whole point of planning this trip to NYC was to see Alexander McQueen's Savage Beauty exhibition. My beloved designer who ended his life last February, left a void in me since. He was the most edgy and inspirational designer, he was an artist. As a testament of his artistic vision, his works were featured at the MET museum. The exhibition was supposed to go from May 4 to end of July but with 225,000 visitors it was extended to August 7. We went to the MET first thing in the morning, the line was about a 30 minute wait. When we left the line extended 10 times as long and probably about 1-2 hours wait. So go early.The exhibition was very well curated featuring his earlier works from graduation collection in 1992 named Jack the Ripper Stalks His Victims to his last collection, Spring/Summer 2010 inspired by Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, before his death. I was enthralled by the exhibition. It was well-executed along with the sets and the music. There was an exhibit with a video in the back of four glass panels falling down revealing a nude rubenesque woman, full and round bodied blowing a pipe while the panels shattered and the background sounds was the blowing of the pipe. Hauntingly mesmerizing.  It looked like it was right out of David Fincher's films.Alexander McQueen's works were centered around romanticism, drawing strong emotions of trepidation, horror and awe. The works were so provocative it's impossible to forget. Not only was he an artist, he was also a tailor. My eyes welled a little from all the well-constructed works it was just too beautiful. Some of the most beautiful pieces were made from hard (brocade silk) and soft fabrics (chiffon), the contrast of fabrics worked so well together.Alexander McQueen (1969-2010)",4,2,3,Nicole L.,"Washington, DC",1079,1609,100

Most of the paintings and sculptures you read and see in textbooks can be viewed at the Met and you'll get a huge selection of masterpieces from the big artists names like Monet, Van Gogh, Cezanne, Gauguin, etc.   Be sure to visit the rooftop for special sculpture exhibits and a fantastic breathtaking view of NYC if the weather permits.  You do get a garden view from all the trees of Central Park.  It seems that they have imported a part of ancient Egypt and recreated a temple on one of the floors.   There are way too many pieces to discuss, you just have to visit and see the spectacular collection for yourself.  Save a day for the Met because it's one of top places to see while you're in NYC.",1,0,0,Shirley C.,"Santa Clara, CA",257,296,421

Good thing that the kids were well behaving. We also thought that they were letting way too many people at once. It was really hard to walk inside and actually see every piece, especially with the kids, The interior work was amazing. My friend and I really enjoyed the experience. It really reflects the designers state of mind.The only upsetting part was that they let me into the museum with a stroller, we paid the fee and walked all the way cross hall, went upstairs and got stopped at the entrance of the hallway to th McQueen show because of te stroller. Supposedly, they do not allow strollers in the special exhibitions, which is OK. Unfortunately, there was no sign and none of the staff warned us downstairs before we made the trip upstairs.

Medieval paintings and weapons had to be one of my favorite parts, the gothic section came to a close second. However the one that stole the show had to be the temporary collection of Alexander McQueen exhibition. The Alexander McQueen was just art, WOW will only be the expression you will see when you learn about the inspiration this man had. From Darwinism to Harry Potter, from Regions ranging from Africa to Asia. There's a lot of Drama going on in this show, to the point that you almost want to cry! You totally tell Anna Wintour had a big voice in this show, it just screams out perfection! Too bad I wasn't able to snap a couple of pictures!However as much as I love the museum, I must criticize it as well! Like any great museum, I just wonder where the art came from, the African section, the European section, Asian etc. I mean there's been a couple of museums that have been in the spot light for stealing art, and I can't help but wonder how the Met got all their permanent collection, I mean there's no way that the African art was given to them in a fair way, there had to be something in exchange. I am just bringing this issue again, because certain museums that I enjoy going to lost a couple of pieces, because they were accused of having illegal art! Now if Italy or other wants their art back, we have to look at all the museums, not just certain once. By the way Italy, what about returning some of the art back the Greece, where some statues actually belong. Lets not forget the Roman empire also looted a hand fulls of great pieces.If you live in NY or are visiting, this place is a must, the whole time you're there, you are just going to think to yourself, wow, I can't believe I am close to all this great ARt, along with, ""wow I better not touch anything because this 3 by 4 picture is probably worth more than I am!",0,0,0,Ignacio V.,"Los Angeles, CA",51,149,39

It's like my own personal dream come true!Went to see the Alexander McQueen exhibit that they have going right now and it was truly extraordinary! Such care and thoughtfulness in the way the exhibit was organized AND I loved that the waiting line for the exhibit  (which took about half an hour to get through) winded through other parts of the museum so that I could look at other pretty and interesting things while I waited.Had to get to a show that evening so I only had about 2 hours in the MET all told (I KNOW a tragedy, right?). But I did manage to see some of the Rodin (my fave!) sculptures and the Monet paintings as well. Honestly, the show I saw ""The Normal Heart"" ---which is currently nominated for all kinds of Tonys---was terrible. I think the text, set and actors were great, but the directing left MUCH to be desired. I'm an Actress myself, and long time student of the theatre and I must say that this trip to Broadway was sorely disappointing. Granted, I'm known to be a pretty harsh critic.

One of the best part about the exhibit was that Givenchy even donated pieces, showing earlier works of Lee. This man is a fashion architect.

The Met was the first fine art museum I went to as a little kid and therefore it because the one I judge all others by.When I was little I loved how massive it all seemed and then when I was older I realize it actually is massive.It is truly a museum and an artifact in itself. Not museum today would be so stuff with plundered objects and entire collections of both amazing and mediocre art all together. I have friends who hate it for that very reason but I love it for the excess and the variable value and skill of the pieces.When I was little I love the old Masters, the Armour  and the Egyptian stuff but as an adult I love the way the have added pieces and exhibits that add modern elements and bring greater understanding of the collections. I also love how even now I can get lost in the rooms and how no matter how many times I go there, things can still surprise me. How two people can enter at the same time and see entirely  different things.I love sitting in the various glassed in spaces and people watching. I love that people can take pictures (without flash) and there are always people drawing the art. I love that they never give you a hard time if you pay less than the 20 dollars entry and I love the attendants all seem to be happy to worth there and actually helpful to guests.

They have over 20 of the most well known artists of all time including contemporary artist, Picasso. Most are of european art.One of my fave artworks is Degas' 'little 14 year old dancer'.They also have their usual mummy collection, and british armory. Their gift shop is lacking any souvenirs that's worth buying. They also have a cafe with sculptures and wall size stain glass windows around.Suggested ticket price is $12 for adults.

Though really you need 2 days to take in booth football field sized floors. Couple of tips for improvement tho:1, Come up with a better method of collecting admissions. The sign says ""20 dollars recommended"" but most people just hand them a dollar! This makes generous people like me feel like a shmuck. 2, Get rid of the street hustlers who ply their cons on the steps entering into the MET. One of them tried to entice me into a game of three card monty. I said: ""no thanks. I prefer to give my money to other cons...like the social security system.""

If you are a history buff and appreciate collections from thousands of years ago to modern times, you will not be disappointed.One can not begin to grasp and appreciate the amount of things that are packed into this huge building. My favorites are the Medieval Arms and Armor room, roof garden on a nice day, Egyptian Art rooms, Asian Art rooms, American Decorative Arts and the rooms showcasing what it looked like back in time, European Sculpture room, Medieval Art room, The Temple and Garden, and so much more to even list. I love exploring the rooms from eons ago that were taken apart and reconstructed here that you can look into. The room with all the religious art in it is solemn and breathtaking at the same time. The paintings are all amazing from abstract to portraits to landscapes. Sculptures seem to be around every corner and pop up everywhere. There area a few places to eat and grab a drink, a cafe' and cafeteria, so you can break up the day a bit and give your feet a rest. You will be walking all day so be prepared! Wear sneakers or super comfortable shoes. This is a must if you are visiting, and great on a cold/rainy day. Even if you are a long time New Yorker this is a must to do. Yes, there will be crowds there, but the place is so immense that you can move along to another gallery and browse back later on to see what you missed.    My suggestion is to break your trips here into sections, and do it over different visits if possible, as it is almost impossible to rush around and see it all in one day.

I find the most fascinating thing about it is that it was a gift from the Egyptians to President Kennedy and he in turn gave it to the MET, which just makes me smile! They have such amazing artifacts there, I think you need a good day or two to explore everything properly, one of my other favorite things is the cafe that is this open courtyard inside the museum and there are bronze statues everywhere, it's beautiful! Right in between the Temple and the exhibit of a Victorian-style house. So beautiful!

All the paintings I studied in Art History class!"" wing: Despite its byzantine configuration, I adore this wing. To me, it's the heart of the Met, and I always make a short stop in it during my visits.

I've never eaten in the museum so I don't know how the food is, but I imagine that it's expensive.

One day is NOT enough time here! The museum is extremely expansive - certainly the Louvre of the States. I spent a mere 6 hours here, and only barely scratched the surface of the collection. By the time it started to near closing, I was rushing through their European Paintings trying to take in all I could. I cannot describe the beauty housed in that edifice, every room lead me to a piece of tangible sublime. Jacques-Louis David - how my eyes weep at such beauty! Paintings aside, their Arms and Armor room was just fascinating. Seeing war items up close, and being surprised by the artists' and craftsmen's attention to artistic detail is something that should not be overlooked. They also had a Eucharist Dove. Pretty awesome. (Look it up, it's wacky.)The only problem I had (and it's a tiny one) was the way they chose to display the American Paintings. House on some mezzanine level, with the paintings encased in glass. Seeing Gilbert Stuart's George Washington studies? AMAZING. Seeing them displayed as though at an IKEA warehouse? Not so cool.CAFE: We ate at the cafeteria, where the food is priced by weight. The selection was okay; not really ""museum standard,"" and more mid-priced buffet, but tasted fresh enough.

The Met is as large or (larger than) the Louvre. Everything here inspires my soul, mind and spirit. While our nation is young compared to the old world, the Met stands tall on its own and is by no means a copy of its older cousins. There is so much to see and marvel at.

If you are visiting NYC, as I was, you must fit a leisure visit to the Met. (Oh, how I wish I had an opportunity to visit this marvelous museum when I was growing up in Brooklyn, NY in my youth. I wish my elementary school teachers had included the Met in one of our field trips.) You don't need to go to Europe to see the best of the classic as well as modern art -- the Met has them all. The Met truly is one of our Nation's greatest treasure.",41,0,16,Peace L.,"San Francisco, CA",21,151,135
5.0,11/6/2010,"Wow. Comparable to the Louvre at last!Set aside a whole day to peruse through this place. I came at 1pm-ish and I stayed until closing at 5pm. They kicked me out. It's organized in a very random manner which made it hard to navigate, but there are a bunch of cool things from all different time periods to occupy your time. I found that they had many period rooms for you to immerse yourself in, and with the sheer amount of Europeans there, you feel like you could in fact be in Europe yourself.Word to the wise, if you're on a budget, the admission fee is SUGGESTED. So you can pay $1 if you must. But remember that it's your admittance fees which help keep the museum running.",0,0,0,Paul B.,"New York, NY",438,434,70
4.0,11/2/2010,"The MET is awesome and overwhelming.My husband and I spent 3-4 hours there, and we definitely didn't see it all. I think we saw most of what we really wanted to see, though. We also got to see the Big Bambu exhibit on the roof (though not go up in the exhibit, you have to buy tickets beforehand in order to do that) which was REALLY awesome. I highly recommend going to see that if you're able.Overall, be sure you are ready for a LOT of walking, and that you're ready to take in a lot of incredible artwork. Wear comfy shoes. Bring a snack with you (just a granola bar, and step into an area where you can eat it, the food at the MET is ridiculously expensive). And enjoy!",2,1,2,Carrie O.,"Longmont, CO",354,936,15

4.0,9/18/2010,"The Van Gogh collection alone would have warranted 4 stars from me (4 and not 5 because of the limited number of pieces on display). I was transfixed by his paintings, the abstract strokes of his brush- thick, wide, and free, and yet the realistic depiction of his subject or object. Ah, to be liberated by one's creativity! And thus I was moved. Select pieces from Monet, Matisse, and Picasso were in the gallery as well, amongst thousands (more?) of other paintings. If only there were more of Picasso's works!My group and I wandered through the gallery in pairs, although since we were individually drawn to different pieces, we naturally drifted apart. That proved to be quite disasterous as we couldn't find one of our members for a good 45 minutes. Let it be known that the Met is a maze, so stick to others in your party as much as possible! The layout of the museum didn't ""flow"" very well. You'd drift from room to room and re-enter certain ones while missing others. Eventually you will have entered all rooms and spaces, but that would've taken quite some time. I found the layout somewhat disruptive to my viewing pleasure.Importantly, you won't finish seeing all exhibits in one visit. You WON'T. If you must cram as much as possible in your museum visit, go early.We also viewed the medieval armory/Japanese swords and musical instruments (strings, winds, you name it!) exhibits.

There is nothing bad you can say about this place. The amount of art exhibits in here is simply astounding. The architecture is some of the finest that I've ever seen, and this is INSIDE a museum. There are so many different things to see that it is nearly impossible to see everything in just one day. While I very much love the Museum of Natural History, some of the exhibits there look dated. Nearly everything in the Met looks as if it's just been out to display recently and this freshness makes the exhibits more vibrant.

Just don't pay full price or try to traipse through the whole museum trying to get to every last piece in one shot. Impossible! Instead, move slowly, sit in different rooms and chat. Roof garden is lovely, but can be sweltering on a hot day.I love to hit up the different themed ""courtyards"" throughout the museum. Great way to narrow down the overwhelming eye-candy options and to organize a path. There are many, with the most famous one probably being the Temple of Dendur. The American Wing and Chinese courtyards are also lovely. You can sit and relax while soaking in fine art. You can feel as if you've gone to several far off lands in one afternoon! Awesome people watching opportunities. You may even be able to pick up a cutie-pie tourist from one of the far off lands you're pretending to visit. ; )The special Costume Institute exhibits are usually amazing and really fun, as are the Roof Garden sculpture installations during spring/summer.Other personal highlights: period rooms, overflow ""storage"" displays, glassware in the American wing, arms & armor and, of course, the Egyptian collection.",0,0,0,Mandy T.,"Jackson Heights, NY",25,150,30

Amazing.I also love that they do ""suggested admission,"" which means you can pay whatever you want. That was awesome to me while I was a poor college student.

The quantity of beautiful pieces here is only overshadowed by the beautiful gallery in which they are housed.Don't forget to stop by the Egyptian section to visit the Temple of Dendur.

5.0,8/17/2010,"I finally went to the Met for the first time after living in New York for almost 3 years. I know, shame on me for not having gone earlier. But in my defense, I was waiting for a day where I had enough free time that I could move through the museum at a leisurely pace instead of rushing through it to see all that I wanted to see. Such a day presented itself last weekend. I managed to see the modern art section, European decorative arts section, and European paintings section, as well as the rooftop exhibit. It was wonderful to admire up close the works of Kandinsky, Braque, Picasso, Rivera, Magritte, Mondrian, Warhol, Rodin, Toulouse-Lautrec, Seurat, Degas, Gauguin, Monet, Van Gogh, David, Vermeer, and on and on... It would take forever to write about everything I saw but the highlights of my first visit to the Met were...Salvador Dalí's Crucifixion - I had previously seen some of Dalí's works in various museums (like the Persistence of Memory at the MOMA) and I've always liked his own unique brand of surrealism. This piece is no exception; I like that he takes an age-old subject that's been done countless times and paints it in his own style but still manages to keep the sanctity and awe of the Crucifixion.yelp.com/biz_photos/jVnc…Chuck Close - Photos and poster reproductions don't do justice to his work simply because of the scale that he works in. His paintings are larger than life and scrutinizing his work closely only made me appreciate it more. His attention to detail is shown in ""Mark."" yelp.com/biz_photos/jVnc… The painting is done so realistically that it looks like a photograph. AND Close's masterful grasp of color theory is evident in ""Lucas."" yelp.com/biz_photos/jVnc…Alphonse Mucha's Maude Adams as Joan of Arc - I was thrilled to stumble upon this tucked away in a corner of the European paintings section. I've always been a big fan of Mucha and his decorative illustration style, and this is the first time I've seen one of his pieces in person. For some reason I'd alway imagined his work to be smaller, so seeing this gigantic painting was especially enchanting. yelp.com/biz_photos/jVnc…Big Bambú (rooftop exhibit) - yelp.com/biz_photos/jVnc…We reached this exhibit just as the sun was starting to set and the light filtering through the gigantic bamboo structure made me feel like I had entered a different world. Or perhaps I should attribute that feeling to the big cup of sangria I got from the rooftop bar. Seriously though, what a gorgeous exhibit. The bamboo structure is so complex and yet spontaneous. Whether you bought your tickets in advance to walk up into the bamboo structure or just bought a cocktail to relax amongst the bamboo poles and overlook New York City, it's a surreal experience. The exhibit will be around until the end of October so I highly recommend taking advantage of the beautiful weather and spending some time on the Met's rooftop. I had planned on going back right before closing because I noticed they had lights strung up on the bamboo structure, but alas I lost track of time searching for a Vermeer that I wanted to see and all of sudden it was closing time.I can't wait to visit the Met again to check out the sections I missed the first time around and to revisit Big Bambú.",3,1,5,Amy S.,"Astoria, NY",272,308,2490
5.0,8/16/2010,"This museum deserves six stars! It's truly amazing and more than worth the $20 they ask you to donate. If I lived in NYC, I would definitely get the annual pass. There's just so much great and amazing stuff to see, that I truly think you would need to come every day for a few weeks to really see everything in detail.We got here early and started in the Egyptian wing. We both love Egypt and were fascinated by the extent of the collection that was on display. In fact, we spent a little too much time here, because once we eventually made our way through the rest of the museum, we remembered that we had wanted to see the Picasso exhibit.By the time we got to the Picasso exhibit, it was mobbed with people. It was pretty amazing to see his works. There was actually a very good amount of his artwork. Unfortunately, you had to contend with all mouth-agape tourists that want to plant themselves in front of a piece for an hour and gaze at it as though they're art experts. It could have been worse.We also enjoyed the modern art wing, and hopefully next time we're in the city we can visit MoMA. Of course, the modern art wing also had Damien Hurst's abominable shark. And they don't let you take pictures, which is silly, too. I took a picture on the other side, when the security guard wasn't around... just because.The paintings upstairs were pretty amazing to see, especially the Van Goghs they had on display, as well as the Seurat, Monet, Manet, Matisse, etc.The Asian art was pretty cool, though some of the stuff in the Chinese exhibit was a bit disappointing. The armory was a lot of fun, as was seeing the period rooms in the American exhibits.

You even can enter there just for $1. They have court checks, and people are very fast and responsible. I never had any problems there. If you are disabilities, there are another entrance on downstairs. ( on the left side of the main entrance steps.)It is very hard to see all museum for one day. I will recommend you to go several times. They have permanent collections as well as temporary collections. They really have great temporary collection. Since museum is so big, if they do retrospective of some artists, they really collect form all over the world. It is amazing to see those collections at the same place. I like there African and Egyptian , very spacious, it is nice just walking around. Their Japanese section is not that big compare to other sections, however they have very good collection as well. During the summer, you have access to the roof. Nice to go upstairs to have cocktails! You can see Manhattan and Central park form the roof. Cocktails are not cheap, but I think it is not expensive for the atmosphere. There will be temporary outdoor installations, most of the time they have interesting ones.

5.0,7/4/2010,"Sometimes, bigger is better.  I think this oft contradicted wisdom applies to museums, and the Met is the consummate illustration of this principle.  Think about it - almost everything that ends up in a museum is worth seeing, so the more pieces a museum has to display, the better.  And it's not like the Met is sneaking in quantity to make up for any lack of quality - every room boasts masterpiece upon masterpiece.  This place isn't just an art geek's wet dream - it's a thousand and one nights of orgiastic delight.The downside to the Met's size is that it's almost impossible to do in one day.  I visited for the first time recently and I'm already trying to figure out when I can devote another large chunk of time to going back.  My boyfriend and I explored the epic collection of European paintings as well as part of the American wing.  The set-up was easy to navigate and each room had something impressive on display.  We were only able to cover these sections with a quick visit to the small room of Korean art before we ran out of time.If you're a student, bring your ID as you get admission for a reasonable $10.  That's a pretty good deal for hours and hours of awe-inspiring exploration.The Met is also a gorgeous building, and just the grand stairs and the outside are worth a stand-and-stare visit from the sidewalk.  That's free, and if you don't have a few hours to kill, I'd say it's worthwhile.  If you go inside, though, you see all manner of amazing art.Of course, it doesn't have to be all high-minded and serious, so I'll end this review with a joke.  Behold the description of a display that once cost someone a hefty $8 million:The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone LivingGlass, steel, formaldehyde solution, shark",8,3,6,Steph C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3889,3532,94

It seemed strange that they would leave out the whole feminist movement especially.

To your common art observer, which I am, I don't think it's worth twenty bucks (sorry). If you love art, then there's no price you wouldn't pay to see all these wonderful works of art. Anyways this place is humongous. The layout is ok, you cannot possibly see everything on one trip since there's multiple entrances and exits for one room. The map they provide you gives you a pretty good path to follow to see the major stuff. The one thing I liked and stood out would have to be the special Picasso exhibit they have right now.

We all know why it gets five stars. And we all have our favorite sections. The Met is one of those places (like the Louvre or Musee d'Orsay) that you should tackle one section at a time. And know ahead of time that you will never make it all the way through. That's the beauty of it: by the time you think you have seen it all, a new exhibit appears.",1,0,2,Martha W.,"Washington, DC",116,450,426

Especially loved the Temple of Dendur and the Picasso exhibit. Oh - and the American Woman exhibit is amazing! Everyone should visit this museum at least once in their lifetime. One caveat - the people working here are really unfriendly. Seriously, they're actually rude. But I didn't want to ding such an incredible institution for something like that.

Ladies, wear GOOD WALKING SHOES. On a busy day, most benches you pass will be taken. Some of the special exhibits are hit or miss (The Silk Road was a big miss), but if you're interested you should definitely check it out.

In any case-- I came here after I discovered the line for The Whitney snaked around the block. There was a tiny line inside the Met when we got there but it moved quickly. I made the ""suggested donation"" of $20/ per person mainly because 1) I support art and 2) I knew I could get my money's worth because the Met is HUUUUGE. I was a big fan of the Korean art installation they had. Very rad.

Probably the best way to do this museum is go an hour or so a day for about a week, and even then you probably won't be able to absorb everything. This museum has the single greatest collection of works I have ever seen.

What museum is more classic to NYC than The Met? None that I can think of! One thing I liked off the bat was that the prices were suggested donations, not fixed prices, so you could give more or less depending on your financial situation. We ended up giving the recommended amount for students. Our admission fee included a map, which made it much easier to get around!The Met itself is both spectacular and massive. We spent a good 4 1/2 hours here, but we really needed 8. Due to time constraints we just weren't able to come for longer and ended up missing entire exhibits. What we saw, though, was amazing. The Egyptian exhibit was really cool, including the special exhibit on King Tut, and then were were able to head to the classic famous works by people such as Monet and Van Gough in the European Art exhibit, the Buddhas in the Japanese Art, and the set of Greek Sculptures. I'm not normally a big art observer, and I was pretty astonished by all the amazing things we saw.The only thing that bothered me about The Met was the overpriced food, but that's kind of a staple in any museum. I would definitely like to come back and see all of the things I missed due to our lack of time. I would definitely recommend a visit, preferably a full day if you have the time.

However, the superhero costuming exhibit awhile back? The Calder jewelery exhibit? Spectacular. So they have their moments of modernity and work besides sculpture and painting.

5.0,2/3/2010,"For all the hype of it being such a large and prestigious museum, it held its own. I was very impressed by the very large selection and numerous free tours offered by kind museum volunteers. The best thing about this place was our tour guide. I can't remember the sweet old lady's name, but we took her 2:30pm free museum highlights tour and were extremely impressed. I'd highly recommend this tour because everything she showed us over the next hour had a great story and was truly  a highlight in her mind. She was so enthusiastic about her favorite art that it made us excited too. I doubt we would have had the same experience without this great tour, and indeed, as soon as it was over we sadly went to a few more rooms, looked over some pretty European paintings, and then left, feeling the best part had definitely been our tour. If I had the chance to go back I'd be sure to go earlier in the day to take more advantage of all the free tours they offered, which was about one every half hour with varying subjects and interests. One highlights tour just wasn't enough to see the vast expanse of this place.",3,2,3,Krista S.,"San Francisco, CA",124,341,453
4.0,1/29/2010,"The reaction is to a kind of reverse pointilism, something that looks like nothing from far away, but amazing up close.  That's the way it is with one exhibit in the modern art section of the Met.  Damien Hirst's ""The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living"" (giant shark encased in formeldahyde) is well juxtaposed next to this unassuming concave set of mirrors, which from far away looks like a solar panel.  Boring.  But once you step in front of and close to it, the mirrors explode into a thousand broken , fascinating images.They had an interesting Samurai sword exhibit.  Personally, there are only so many blades I can see before they all start to look the same.  I found it interesting that the armor they wore was occassionally decorated in pastoral themes and had images of poppies and cherry blossoms on them.  Some of the masks came with fierce moustaches.  Interesting helmet design: giant rabbit ears (for leading) and even a crab.  I recommend watching Akiro Kurosawa's Yojimbo before you go to put you in the right mindset.Also, the recommended donation of $20 is just that, recommended.  So if you want to pay less, or more, please do - they didn't give me a hard time about it when I went.  Only downside to the Met are the tourists and teenagers.",2,1,1,Christina M.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,138,15

But don't let the massive swarms of stupid tourist in the lobby fool you.  Once I got deep into the different areas of the museum, I began to wonder where everyone had gone.  At some moments, I even had sections of the museum to myself.I think, also, what's great with this museum is there's something for everyone here.  There was a great Modern Art wing on top of all the great Asian, Egyptian and Greek Art (my favorite sections). Plus, the area surrounding the museum if filled with such interesting and beautiful buildings that  you're bound to spend time ""oooh-ing"" and ""awww-ing"" before entering the Met. OH!

5.0,12/2/2009,"Why are we writing reviews of this place? Is it necessary? Let's be more specific: pay a quarter to get in, avoid the overpriced cafeterias (unless you feel guilty about the quarter--but remember, all the museums in London are free; shouldn't they be here?), and check out the following highlights, at least: the Egyptian collection, the recently restored Greco-Roman collection, the American wing, and the rooftop garden. Special exhibitions and evening concerts are also recommended.I think MoMA is better for modern art, so you might give that a miss here. The medieval collection is very nice, but The Cloisters is more extensive, has free tours, and is a more relevant setting, being a transplanted, repurposed monastery and all. The Asian collection is very good across all categories. The new director of the museum is a tapestry expert, so there are probably nice tapestries to look at if you're the other person who cares about them.If you want to look at the permanent collection, go with a plan in advance or, barring that, use the free catalogs and the information desks to create a loose itinerary of major works, which are generally going to be situated among similar works you might be interested in. If you try to see everything, you're just going to exhaust yourself.You are likely to find prints of your favorite works, if they're notable, in the gift shop. Second floor is the discount section.Also check out the Neue Galerie a few blocks to the north for modern German art.

3.0,11/30/2009,"Maybe it's the NYC ""charm"", but being rude to customers is never appropriate in my book, especially at a museum where you're hired to be helpful, not disorganized and brash. Yet this is the attitude of many of the workers here, and none of them apply the rules in the same manner as the others. It made the art almost not worth it as the Met is full of famous artists, NOT famous works (save that expectation for the Smithsonian, the Frick, the MOMA, or the Getty. Seriously.). For having so much yet having so little, you'd think they'd lighten up a bit, right?First off, why are screaming children and adults allowed to run through the galleries with such fervor that the floor shakes yet I can't go into a non-gallery hallway to ask my grandfather to give me his favorite painting again on a cell? I could barely hear myself over the children crying and adults calling out to one another from room to room, yet I got jabbed in the collarbone four times by the fifth guard that went by me who stink-eyed me into submission. I never did hear what the painting was, so I'm afraid I left disappointed. I saw five other people on cells in quiet galleries... not a single guard poked them or asked them to stop. Funny, heh (not really).I also wanted to see the rooftop garden. The woman at the information desk was less than happy to talk to us, rolling her eyes and going ""MA'AM, I CAN'T HELP YOU. CALL TOMORROW."" All I asked was where the way to the rooftop garden was? Excuuuuuuse me, miss snot with a bad Jersey accent. We made up a song about her being fired for inappropriate conduct. Made me feel a bit better, but not 4-stars better.At the very least, one SHOULD come here. There are plenty of famous artists - not famous paintings, though - and a little something for everyone's tastes. My favorite was the the Roman gallery and seeing art that has been around for centuries. You don't have to pay $20 for a ticket; you can say you want to pay less.

Later, Ross has a chat with Charlie...Ross: Hey, how was the Met?Charlie: The museum was amazing!Ross: Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?Charlie: Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.Ross: What do you mean?Charlie: Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around.Ross: (perplexed for a moment) Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right?Charlie: No, we went to the left.So I watched this rerun shortly after returning from my own visit to the museum, and it cracked me up because I knew EXACTLY what they were talking about... when I got to the Met I made a RIGHT and, not quite realizing the enormity of  the museum, proceeded to spend a couple of hours in the Egyptian art wing alone.By the time I made my way around the first floor to the Greek and Roman art wing (where Joey must have been trying to woo Charlie with his newly acquired knowledge of the ancient tombs and sphinx statues on the other side :P), 3ish hours had passed, and I was WAY too exhausted to even breach the second floor.Lesson learned: a thorough perusing of the Met requires at least TWO return trips.

The first painting we saw was the portrait of a wealthy woman (probably from the Medici family) and his soon to be husband, a portrait by Filippo Lippi. A pure showing of wealth, possession and relationship between a man and a woman. According to our tour guide, the woman wears the jewelry to show the wealth of the family, but in reality everything from the jewelry to the dress belongs to the man. The red piece of clothing that the woman was wearing represents love and showing of love even though marriages were arranged.The second painting we saw was the ""Penitence of Saint Jerome"" by Joachim Patinir, a representation of belief, penitence, Jesus being baptized in the Jordan river, Saint Jerome looking for redemption, and Anthony the hermit being held by monsters. This was a beautiful painting.The third painting we saw was ""The Annunciation"" by Joos Van Cleve.This painting represents the revelation to the Virgin Mary by the angel Gabriel that she will bear the son of God. Beautiful painting as well.The Fourth painting was by Pieter Bruegel the Elder called ""The Harvesters"". I like this painting because it still represents life today on earth. Hard work, community and environment are all represented in this painting. Notice the man sleeping under the tree next to others. He is by far the most interesting personage of the portrait. Perhaps he is lazy or maybe he is just tired and resting. Either way he is still part of everything else around him, and that's called humanity.The fifth painting was by Titian and called ""Venus and Adonis"". A painting representing Venus attempting to convince her lover Adonis not to go for hunting as she knew what his destiny is. As romantic as this painting can be, I didn't see why the woman has to be nude. Perhaps, Venus was attempting to hold Adonis right after sex, but why is Adonis dressed? Also the baby seems to be left out of the story, Adonis and Venus are focused on each other but not on the child.The sixth painting was ""The toilet of Bathsheba"" by Rembrandt Van Rijn. I love this painting, yet another representation of a nude woman (emphasis on nude) being the object of pleasure, the object of desire. She has to be prepared for King David. I like how she is holding her right breast, perhaps the painter was disturbed by the fact that women have size differences in right and left breasts and didn't want to show that. I absolutely love this painting!!The seventh and last painting we saw was the incredible ""Juan de Pareja"" by Diego Valazquez. A portrait of a slave man and the painter's personal assistant . A masterpiece indeed. No comment..If you ever go to the Met, I suggest you do the Old Masters paintings guided tour.",3,1,2,Kikirt U.,"New York, NY",26,119,149

Well, why not go to the cafeteria at the Metropolitan Museum of Art?? (Okay, so we were desperate and cheap, and didn't pay the suggested museum entrance fee.)  Food was fast, food was not good.

5.0,10/25/2009,"""She is a full-on Monet: looks great from far away but up close she is a total mess""As many times as I've been to the Met, I still get lost. I'm also surprised I haven't written a review. Although it's not my favorite museum in the world, I would say it is as good as it gets in New York. The space itself is lovely. While Italian museums boast a ""better"" selection, their facilities just don't allow for as pleasant a visit. The French, though... I'm more into ""skills art"" than ""concept art"", the latter of which I think is mostly rubbish contrivances with very few exceptions. But I'll spare you my theories on art. The Met has a decent collection of artwork that falls into my liking. I've seen prints of many of them as, I'm sure, have you, but really, there's nothing like seeing the brushstrokes and colors on the actual tableau. Seriously, incredible. If you've ever made an attempt at painting, as I've so disastrously endeavored, you really come to appreciate the skill behind some of these paintings. You may peruse aimlessly without a studied tour or you can while away with an audio guide and learn something. Either way, you'll have a wonderful time here. As someone who's participated in the educational programs here through the public school system, I do think art appreciation is a valuable and worthwhile part of an education. Costume Institute has an annual exhibit here. Most memorable - the goddess exhibit. The quality of these exhibits have seen a dip lately, but that doesn't reflect upon the Met. Lastly, I like that the Met has made attempts to venture into more ""modern"" art. And if anyone at the Met ever happen upon this review, it would be kind of cool to incorporate some modern art in existing perma exhibits. That juxtaposition would be cool and something that would refresh both the modern and ""old"". Something that strictly modern art spaces would not be able to do.

It's pricey, but if you're spending the whole day you'll need to take a breather and refuel. While the Met is not cheap ($20 per adult), there is one trick we've found especially useful. If you have a Bank of America Checkcard you can get in FREE the first full weekend of every month. When we had family visiting in October they all brought BoA Checkcards and we saved well over $100, which is fantastic if you're already shelling out money for NYC hotels.

5.0,9/8/2009,"After a quick breakfast trip to Dunkin' Donuts, La Novia and I headed to the Met. We took our first New York cab ride here and it was well worth it.Overall, I had an excellent experience here. It was somewhat touristy, but it didn't cost much to go. A normal ticket is $20, but with a student ID it is $10. I used my old ID, which was 50 pounds ago, but it worked and the guy at the desk let La Novia in as well for the student rate. It was cool on his part and the rest of the staff was awesome too. Well, except for the little short guy with the Napoleon complex in the Monet area that kept telling me I was standing to close to the paintings.Regardless, this is easily the best museum I have ever visited. I was able to see art from all over the world here. Sure, they have the impressive and exquisite European art that utilized materials (namely gold) from various colonies. But these ravaged colonies had impressive art too. The interesting and beautiful art that wasn't stolen or destroyed during war and colonial takeover from the Americas, Oceania, and Africa were available to view as well. This was some really cool stuff.They had a new Afghan exhibit that had art recovered from war torn Afghanistan. This was a really cool and interesting exhibit.

Easily accessible from the subway (multiple different lines at that) and across from Central Park - beautiful on a rainy day, by the way; this place is a must see.

5.0,8/28/2009,"It's my 200th review, so you know I've gotta save it for something absolutely spectacular. In fact, absolutely spectacular doesn't even been to describe the sheer magnitude of how incredible the Met is. I've been to New York 5 times, and to the Met four of the five (why I didn't go that fifth time is beyond me). It seriously gets better and better each time, especially after that one art history class I took senior year just to fill up the minimum 12 hours.Anyways, I always walk the same path each time, so let me take you through a tour of the Met in my eyes.1. Just entering the building is monumental, walking up the steps and into the grand hall. An added bonus is that the admission fee is recommended (but even at full price, you're getting your money's worth) and student-friendly (just $10/ticket).2. Like a true psychological sucker, I start by turning right into the Egyptian Art. I've got little appreciation for anything before the Renaissance, but the sheer amount of stuff they have in here is incredible.3. Keep going until you enter the Temple of Dendur. It's a great picture opportunity, and is one of the more awe-inspiring pieces of art you'll see that looks like it was transported from another lifetime (another good example: the Byzantine Chapel in Houston).4. After that, enter the newly redone American Wing, which is just absolutely phenomenal. The American Wing used to look like a throwaway section in the museum, where there were some famous paintings that you had to search for. It's been completely redone and words can't describe how amazing it looks. They've made ""theme"" rooms that are taken straight out of American history, and you can explore to your heart's content.5. From there, take a break and make your way to sculpture garden. You may need to rest there for a bit. The sculptures are fairly neat. There's a cafeteria there if you need it.6. Head to the second floor for European painting from Byzantine through 19th century. What they lack in quality (there aren't any truly famous paintings), they make up in quantity. Seriously, all the artists you want are here, from Titian to Velasquez to Rembrandt to David to Manet to Monet, and pretty much everything in between. The rooms are impeccably organized, so try and follow the numbers for the full story. A few of my favorites: David's Death of Socrates, Cot's The Swing and Meissonier's Friedland. This is where I spend most of my time.7. Head on over to 20th century art. My absolute favorite is the Jackson Pollock; I could sit and stare at that forever.8. Those are my highlights; from there, I hit whatever else I can. I enjoy the arms and armor section, which can be looked at fairly quickly. It also looks like they've redone some of the Greek and Roman Art section to look more magnificent.Bonus: The second to last time I was here, they featured two reliefs from the Gates of Paradise. I literally took this exact path through the museum and couldn't find them. At last, I saw them in a small exhibit next to the grand staircase, and it was perfect end to an awesome museum. As a bonus, check out the stairs; you don't generally walk up them when you enter, and by the time you finish, you're too tired to do so. But if you've still got the strength, walking up those stairs is pretty sweet.This last time around, after we were done, my girlfriend texted her friend with ""I just spent FOUR HOURS at a museum!!"" My response? ""ONLY four? We should have spent more!""",3,2,3,Jeffrey C.,"Silicon Valley, CA",599,1025,926

This past weekend I went to the new American wing which is pretty nice. I love that they have lots of furniture and jewelry (Tiffany glass) ... it was very nice but that's still not why I decided to write the review. I'm writing the review for the new women's bathrooms! They're AWESOME. Bathrooms in the met are always crowded but this one is worth standing in line for. There are ceiling to floor wooden doors on every stall, and the stalls have their own sinks. The one I went into was almost as big as my college dorm room, seriously! I'm not saying to hold it if you're all the way over by Roman sculpture, but if you're in that neck of the woods, it's definitely the most ""comfortable"" facility there.

When we went there was the Vogue fashion exhibition which showed the changes in fashion throughout the 20th century and through into the 21st - some seriously beautiful outfits on show there! On a sunny day the Roof Terrace is an amazing place to enjoy a glass of sparkling wine and enjoy the views and you can get lost in the history of The Americas and The Orient as well as the Roman/Greek history sections.

The hunt itself wasn't too interesting. I don't know if it was our ADHD, but we gave up pretty quickly & just roamed, which was fun.I have never seen such a beautiful space. Even without all the exhibits, the museum building itself would be worth visiting. It's just gorgeous. But, of course, the exhibits are what make the MET. I especially loved the Roman sculptures and (obviously) the Picassos. We spent a lot of time in the European paintings wing and even though some of the religious works are not my cup of tea, they are undoubtedly special and meaningful. We took a breather on a bench in front of that glorious fountain and I realized it would take many more visits before I actually see everything I want to see (the more contemporary pieces.) If you only have the patience for one museum when you're in NYC, make it the MET.

He's 28) a couple of times and it was a great experience every time. How do I pay the admission fee every time you ask? I don't. What I was taught by my cousin was you DONATE a fee, whether it be 10 cents or 1 dollar...and you're granted admission! The last time I went, it was about 30-40 minutes to closing time so the guide just let us through. After everyone was rushed out at closing, the Afro-bats were on the steps ready to put on a show. Yeah, some people think of them as money-grubbing weirdos but so what? They put on a funny show and I'm sure a lot of tourists (plus natives) got a kick out of them...while giving them money.

We spent the whole day here and left wanting more. From the architecturally excellent, like the Sackler Wing and the American Wing courtyard to the curatorial excellence of almost all we saw. The visible storage in the American Wing is an inspired concept  with thousands, a guess, of items on display without information but as though we were looking behind the scenes of the museum and in some way we are. Brilliant. With the most helpful Museum staff I have ever come across anywhere in the world the exploration of the Met is made easy and a pure pleasure. The combination of history and the assertion of craft as an art form makes this Museum an inspiring education. The, must see, Francis Bacon retrospective made this trip raise to a level thats hard to compete with.

5.0,7/23/2009,"One of the world's most impressive collections. We all already know how great a museum the Met is for New Yorkers and visitors alike. Many of us take our worldly treasures for granted. The Met is one of those often overlooked treasures.What can I add to the conversation about the value of the Met? One aspect of the Met that many of us overlook is the remarkable ability of great art and great music to stimulate our senses and the passions burning within us. The Met creates an ambience suitable for remarkable dates.Not to be neglected are the dining offerings at the Met. By dining I mean drinking. From my experience, the drinks (especially the wines) are particularly well selected. Impressive that an institution known for excellence carries those standards through in the execution of all they do.The Balcony Bar has quickly become one of my favorite spots in the city. I bow to its powers to stimulate passion. With great food (light finger food), great drinks, great music, and proximity to great art, it can put just about anyone in a good mood. Believe me when I tell you that dive bars and trendy lounges have nothing on this place in its ability to reach down deep into our souls and stimulate passion. Not only are the drinks and small plates delicious, the musicians creating the live music and the great ambience are amazingly talented and properly reflect the excellence of the Met.Among the many dining options, the Met  also has the Roof Garden Cafe, which is more roof than cafe, but also offers another great space with wine, beer and cocktails. The Petrie Court Cafe and Wine Bar is a full-service restaurant in the European Sculpture Court with views of Central Park through a wall of glass. I specifically mention these additional 2 spaces because in addition to the Balcony Bar, are the spots where both cocktails and passion-stimulating ambience are present in most abundance. What they lack in live music, they make up with views of Central Park and New York; outside on the roof or in the midst of real European statues respectively. Plus, you have to walk through the Met collection of art on the way to and from these spaces.So yes, the Met is a great date place. While some of us already know, many of us have overlooked the power of the Met to stimulate passion.So if you're in the latter group, try it for yourself. You be happily surprised by the romantic potential of the Met. An overlooked treasure indeed.",4,2,8,Sergio R.,"New York, NY",205,71,33
5.0,7/23/2009,"Absolutely amazing beyond words.  Make sure you have on your favorite walking shoes and if your schedule permits plan on at least 5-6 hours if not the whole day.  I was so blown away by the sheer magnitude of what is to be seen here that after spending only 3 hours before they closed one weekend, the following weekend I brought a few friends back from Texas to show them as well.  When I initially walked through the doors I had no idea that I would be flying back to NYC again the next weekend with others to take it in some more.   The second weekend was quite enjoyable as I had seen enough that impressed me that I knew where to go and show friends.  The lasting impression that I have always been left with is how well people lived in the past.  While we may not have had lights or cars until recently compared to what you will see here, it seems that people were doing quite well hundreds and even thousands of years ago even without all of our modern addictions like iPhones, Internet and SUV's.",7,3,7,Greg D.,"Davis, CA",3847,4051,46593

My love for The Met is deep and long-standing, and my Yelp oeuvre wouldn't be complete without it. Yes, it's ginormous. Sometimes we go in with a game plan (we'll see x, y, and z today), but my favorite visits are the ones where I just amble around and see whichever rooms I happen to find myself in. Lots of tourists (especially if the weather's bad), but the museum is so cavernous that you can always find a quiet corner if you're willing to search it out. Come during the holiday season to view the Christmas tree. Take it from this atheist Jewish girl, it is not to be missed. The Victorian angels take my breath away each time; it's definitely one of my favorite NYC-in-the-wintertime moments.Great traveling exhibits -- at least one that's up your alley is bound to be going on while you're there. If you're going in the next week or so, be sure to check out the ""Model as Muse"" fashion exhibit. The setup, from the clothing to the music to the walls, is just fantastic.My favorite year-round exhibits include: The Temple of Dendur, especially when it's not crowded (I've been throwing ""wishes,"" aka pennies, into that reflecting pool since I was a child); The Astor Court in the Asian Arts wing (live coy fish in the pond!); and Period Rooms in the American Wing.

Non-flash photos are permitted of the works of art except in any Special Exhibitions.I'm cheap, so I bring lunch and eat it on the steps.

5.0,6/28/2009,"""Champagne for my real friends, real pain for my sham friends."" - Francis BaconI always forget how awe-inspiring the Met Museum is. From the moment you walk in to the Great Hall on the main floor (also the venue for its grand events) one feels transported to another era. It's easy to get really lost in the museum, literally, as we took elevators and stairs all over and almost ended up in an employees only area. The museum staff are always happy to point you in the right direction.In this case it was towards the Model as Muse exhibit, which featured fashion, editorial photography, archived magazine covers, and model profiles from the golden age of couture to present day. One is greeted by some of the most famous attire from fashion photography: Brooke Shield's button down and jeans, Veruschka's lace up safari top, the topless bathing suit, all shown on mannequins striking the appropriate poses. Christian Dior gowns are shown in the process of construction on mannequins with pincushion bracelets. Every room represents a different era. Picture George Michael's ""Freedom"" video and music pumping in the 80's room with Chanel street-wear and over-the-top Gianni Versace designs and Nirvana playing on repeat in a graffiti-splashed room for the grunge 90's (yes, Marc Jacobs infamous collection from the decade is on view). It's a must see. My only request is for more of it. From there up to the rooftop to see amazing views over Central Park and the city.  Roxy Paine The Maelstrom is an organic, stainless steel, sculpture piece that extends over the entire roof with its sprawling and writhing tree branches. You can walk under, through, and around it. My favorite was looking up at the cloud spotted sky through the branches.Back down into the labyrinth, through the modern art section, past Damien Hirst's formaldehyde shark, and into the European sculpture court...we snapped some photos in the glass-top atrium of a warrior sculpture holding the beheaded head of an opponent. Kodak moment!Finally at the centenary retrospective exhibit for Francis Bacon, one can view the largest collected works of this *important* artist. He is significant y'all. I left feeling disturbed. His paintings show figures cloaked in pain, being crucified, and in seemingly twisted pain. Ouch.

They pilfer coins from fountains to pay for automat meals, sleep in ancient beautiful canopied beds and have a wild adventure. Walking into this museum I can't help but imagine repeating their journey. Every room is an explosion of history. It's such an educational experience, but somehow it's a luxury. A luxury that you can be a part of for only 5 cents if you want to be cheap. When I was younger I would pretend to be from whatever time or place the exhibits were from. In the Temple of Dendur I was a young Nubian girl...you get the idea. As I got older I would make fun of the outlandish junk protection that the armor provided in the Arms and Armors section, and then I learned just to appreciate it for what it was - an incredible collection of little pieces of time and energy. I don't know, for a place that puts so many inanimate objects on display there is just so much excitement around every corner!

4.0,5/1/2009,"Argh, not an easy place to review because by not giving it a perfect score you are fighting against a torrent of art.  However, I think in its ambit and scope it almost tries to do too much. First, ignore any questions, just go there, because you have to. Now where you go from there is the big choice.  We went to see Maelstrom on the MET roof which is a beautiful experience.  I would suggest waiting until the MET opens, on a sunny day of course, and then running straight up there to try and get some quiet time alone with the piece.  When I went at midday it was plagued by the masses.  I particularly enjoyed one guy walking around using his viewfinder as an eye and going smak bang into it. The other highlights for me were the selection of modern art which has what seems like the number one from every top ten list for modern art.  On the ground floor the paneled study of the Duke of Urbino is an exceptional piece and just makes me wish I could have seen it in situ (Italy).  The Egyptian room was unfortunately being renovated but I will go back just for that as the combination of skylights, park and stolen chunks of Egypt's history is an epic vista. Apart from that it has everything and in that slightly suffers in its focus. Oh, the MET pink entry badge is cute as well",0,0,0,Thomas W.,"London, United Kingdom",26,192,45

If you wanted to see everything without going slow or reading much it would take you 3-4 visits at 3-4hours per visit.

5.0,2/24/2009,"There are plenty of other reviews giving The Met 4/5 stars, but here are my thoughts to add to them.Admission:Even though a lot might not be aware about it, they run on a donation system. The prices listed are simply suggested donations that they think you should donate. However, you are free to donate any amount that you see fit to gain entry to the museum.Bag Checking:They certainly do provide free bag checking, which is awesome for when you might be carrying something bulky with you.The museum itself:It's simply great and fantastic! There is so much ground to cover that you won't be able to see everything in one day. They have so many different exhibits that will fascinate you and keep you wanting to more.It will probably be best to plan the specific exhibits you want to see if it is your first time at The Met.The only con I can say about the museum is its location. Personally, it doesn't really bother me, it's next to Central Park, on Museum Mile, and I know where I'm going as a New Yorker.

The European Impressionists.  My favorite is Vincent Van Gogh.Standing in front of a Van Gogh for the first time is inspiring: the heavy palette, the bright colors, the swirling movement, and the vibrant, ethereal quality of his images are gripping.  It creates an emotional reaction.  It is hard to walk away from.  One of my favorites Van Gogh's at The Met is The Cypress Trees:static.px.yelp.com/photo…Van Gogh is the raw and unfettered beauty of his vision, heartbreak, madness, nightmarish fear and terror, unrequited and undying love for a woman, poverty, hunger, despair, rejection, failure, and the unrelenting burden of his loneliness...Van Gogh eventually went mad and killed himself.  But, he never gave up on his art.  Perhaps the reality of life became too much for him too handle, or perhaps it was a bio-chemical imbalance.....I've read stories of Vincent wandering the countryside in threadbare clothing, penniless and hungry selling his art to peasants or farmers for food or a place to sleep.  Vincent must have known that he was a failure in the eyes of his family and the only woman he loved, he was even a disappointment to himself. But, he never gave up on his art. Before he killed himself, he wrote:""I cannot help it that my pictures do not sell. Nevertheless, the time will come when people will see that they are worth more than the price of the paint.""While I face unbearable circumstances, I remember Vincent staggering though a life of poverty, rejection, and seeming failure and never giving up on his passion.

It's just too holy to accept with my humble brain and heart.   I love the Met not only because of the works but also because of people. It is such a great place to meet new people.

You can meet a lot of interesting people who are full of stories here!! LOVE IT.    I love this  museum, but still I love Museum of Fine Arts Boston better. Sometimes a museum with many exhibitions considered as famous or good place, and mostly they are, but ... Works are placed right next to the other one. This creates a bit of difficulty to appreciate one subject deeply. This is why I give 4 stars.  Wish I had more calm and concentrative brain so that I don't have to feel sad about their way of placing. The Met store is .. great ! They have nice CDs and books. Especially I love their CDs, awesome (not Radiohead awesome, but Edith Piaf  awesome, it's a museum store,so...)  Roof is amazing. I found NY beautiful when I saw it from here.

The ones I visited were: 1) Ancient Battle Armor from England 2) Classical paintings from Europe (both in the Middle Ages and Rennaissance), I saw the famous Van Gogh self portrait 3) The Chinese wing, with a mini garden (built by a museum in China and sent to the US as a gift), with some not-so-famous Chinese paintings. 4) The semi-outdoor hall, with big statues made by Reconnaissance sculptors like Michelangelo and Bernini.However, most of its goods from the Chinese wing (the porcelains) were looted and stolen by the Western forces during the Opium War and the Boxer rebellion after the defeat of the Qing Dynasty. I admit that they were kept in very good condition, but this cannot excuse the barbaric act of the invasion of China and the looting of its historical artifacts. These artifacts belong to a Chinese museum, not an American one.So from a scholastic point of view, I respect the Museum of maintaining the Chinese artifacts in good condition, but from a nationalist and a political view, I must condemn them, as imperialists, as invaders, as looters, as pillagers. I wish I could go back in time, and meet the American and British and French and Austrian looters of these artifacts of my home country, and stand in front of their caravans, shout at them in the middle of the Gobi Desert: ""Halt!

Cypriot?  Wow, that's impressive.  I'm sorry that I missed that one last time.  The Met holds my favorite artwork of all time--El Greco's View of Toledo.  I could go on and on about the painting, but that has little to do with the museum.  I'll just say that it cements the Met as a must-see destination whenever I visit New York.Other highlights are the Astor Court, a recreated Chinese courtyard; Washington Crossing the Delaware; the Equestrian Court/Arms and Armor exhibit; and my favorite place to sit down and rest for a while--the Temple of Dendur.",2,1,2,David R.,"Park Ridge, IL",97,2021,527

I was just started in Greece Art Hall as an employee maded me scared by all of sudden speaking to me close to my ear about my bag.I did put down my bag on floor because I was taken a picture and hall was empty so I did not expect somebody next me. Her monition was I cannot put down my bag for reason of security!!! In empty hall?Of course I lost my enjoyable mood for a half of prospective one.I asked her why she had scared me like this but no reaction or any courtly words of regrets or smth like this. I'm not for the fisrt time in the museums and I know very well what is permitted and what is prohibited. Later this day I saw a lot of courtesy from other employees of this museum! Very nice! Now I believe that some of them are bored  and they stick to visitors just like this. Especially morning.So I cannot say that I fully enjoyed this my visit. The bathrooms are hidden so well that it's hard to find them, even with plan of Museum or explanations of gentil employees. Too much complicated... Also some of halls in museum were closed ( f.ex. it was a Japanese Art) but I did not see any announcement about it before I bought the ticket and before I sceduled my visit.  For the price 20$ that I paid I think I could have more information what's go on in the present day.On website also no information about it and no form for feedback.So I do not wish to come back there.",1,0,0,lara p.,"Long Island City, NY",1,12,1

5.0,9/15/2008,"Hands down, five stars. Hands down, my favorite destination in Manhattan. I remember coming into the city as a kid and loving the Met. It really is remarkable that I now live within walking distance. On average, I pay the Met a visit 1-2 times a month. I always try to dedicate a few hours to one specific exhibit, but that, of course, is never enough time, just for one section. Despite my frequency in visits, I know I have by no means exhausted all that the Met has to offer.Go check out the rooftop exhibits - such a special aspect that many people fail to see! I loved the Jeff Koons sculptures on display this summer. Have a drink (I recommend their specialty martinis) and soak up the incredible art, along with the breathtaking view of the city. Sadly, the Islamic art exhibit is (still) under restoration. I've recently fallen in love with the African art section. My all time favorites are the classics - Greek and Roman art as well as the Egyptian galleries. Go sit by the pools at the Temple of Dendur and feel transported back a few thousand years to ancient Egypt. It's simply breathtaking. Little known fact (at least, to tourists): the $20 admission is a ""suggested donation."" So, depending on how generous you feel (and, honestly, how much you can afford), give what you can. I'm not a member of the Met, but they have some pretty sweet offerings if you join (I think it's around $1,000 membership fee per year).",1,0,3,Juliet A.,"Washington, DC",1031,1069,1106

Which is why I didn't exactly rush out to check out the place.Until I caught wind about the superhero costume exhibit. And Jeff Koons on the roof. Fortunately, I managed to see the superhero exhibit on its last day, September 1st. It was clogged with visitors and guards forbidding them to snap pictures so I had to wrestle my way through the crowd. But my effort was well rewarded. I saw Christian Bale's Batman suit from The Dark Knight, Christopher Reeve's Superman suit, Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman suit and Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man suit, among many others. I still maintain we should have been allowed to take pictures...maybe just sans flash, perhaps.The Jeff Koons exhibit on the roof of the Met was incredible. Huge, metallic sculptures scattered around the rooftop for visitors to mingle around while taking in the view of Central Park and the Manhattan skyline made this the favorite part of my visit. There's even a cafe up there.I also perused the modern art section so I could get my fix of Picassos and Warhols, to name a few.

Jump up and down because your in NYC for the love of God! One of the greatest cities in the world. Then meander through the Met. You could get lost in here.

For my fifth visit here, as always, I see things I never noticed before and that's always a turn-on and anyone spending any time in NYC that fails to get some Met, is sorely missing the culture boat.Always looking for the new, my brother and I made a point to check out the Tibetan Arms and Armor exhibit and he asked the inevitable question, ""I thought they were all peace-loving Buddhists?"" I informed him that not everything is what it seems when it comes to borders and dominance and that led to further discussion (exactly what art is designed to do) and we absorbed it all.The highlight of this particular visit though, was the Superheroes: Fashion and Fantasy exhibit that rocked my socks. Not having read up on this special before going, both my brother and I must've looked silly with our jaws hanging agape as we saw costume after costume of fantastic and mind-blowing superhero garb through the ages as designed by the world's very best clothing designers. Michelle Pfieffer's Cat woman made me purr green with envy, Christian Bale's Batman made me growl a come-on and the X-Men's ""Mystique"", rotating round and round on a platform to highlight every nook and cranny of her awesome life-size body, made me jealous that she was chosen for the part and not me. Of course I would have to shed a few pounds to look that good. And my face might need some work. And I'd have to be 20 years younger...you know, minor things. No photography was allowed otherwise you'd be seeing shots of the most sexy (idealized) men and women that ever sparked the imagination of what could, or should be.P.S., At $20 a pop, I asked ""Do you offer a military discount?""

5.0,6/20/2008,"The 'Met', as it's more commonly known, is one of the world's pre-eminent galleries of antiquities and art, in the same league as the Louvre and the British Museum. In fact, 'Art' doesn't fully do it justice, as its enormous collection - over two million items - also incorporates a large quantity of antiquities, some of which may or may not strictly be classified as art. But enough semantics. Opened in 1872, moved to the present location in 1880 and vastly expanded since, the museum and its collections are in my view among the most impressive and best curated in the world and, despite its size, easy to navigate. There are substantial collections of Eqyptian, Greek, Roman, Islamic and Asian antiquities, with oriental objects being particularly well represented. My personal highlight is the stunning Egyptian Temple of Dendur (c. 15 BC), which was rescued from being submerged by the waters behind the Aswan High Dam in 1965, and located in the Sackler Wing in 1978. The presentation - in a room to itself complete with adjacent water feature - is quite simply breathtaking. There is a substantial collection of mediaeval objects as well, (some 50,000 items at the last count) including renaissance sculpture, tapestries, religious objects and arms and armour. Some of the mediaeval European collection (and the architecture especially) is housed at 'The Cloisters', an offshoot located in North Manhattan (and worth a visit in its own right). Like the Louvre (and unlike the British Museum), the collection also includes painting, and here again we are unquestionably in world class territory. There's simply no point listing which artists are represented - the collection of 2,200 paintings includes items from every major European painter from the early mediaeval period to the present, and exhibitions cover modern art as well as Fine Art from earlier centuries. As I said before, curation is outstanding: scholarly but never patronising, and written as accessibly as possible. They also take accessibility very seriously indeed: see the website for full details, but level access, wheechair provision, audio loops, sign language interpretation, guided and self-guided touch tours and large print guides are among some of the services available. There are about half a dozen places to eat, with two restaurants for members only, but my tip is the roof-top Roof Garden Cafe, which is open May-late autumn, weather permitting. It offers stunning views over Central Park. Prices are a little steep, like most similar museums, but the quality is good. (You could just stick to a nice glass of wine - all the venues are licensed.) Admission prices - $20 for adults currently - includes same-day access to special exhibitions and the Cloisters offshoot. Overall, I consider this a must on any visit to New York. Go!",0,0,0,David J.,"London, United Kingdom",65,1983,9585

5.0,6/10/2008,"The Met is my ""must see"" museum whenever I'm in NYC. I love that the admission price is only ""suggested"" (even though I always choose to pay full price) because to me, it means that the Met is concerned with its art being accessible to anyone who wants to see it. (When I lived in NYC a decade ago, I could only really afford to pay $5 or so, which is another reason why I love the Met -- it's the museum I've been to most often.)Since my last trip to the Met was in December 2007, I was absolutely THRILLED to see that Tara Donovan's installation on the Mezzanine had been extended through September (it was originally supposed to end in April). It is the 4th in their series of mid-career contemporary installations. (I've added two photos for you to see the magic.)In addition, three other special exhibits were quite modern and fun. The first was ""Superheroes: Fashion and Fantasy"" which included original superhero costumes from movies, including Batman (thank goodness it was Bale's and not Clooney's stiff-nipple one), Iron Man (the all-silver one), Spider-Man and Michelle Pfeiffer's Cat Woman, along with designers like Galliano playing off of those themes. The Superheroes exhibit is on display through September 2008.The second exhibit, which ends in October 2008 is ""Photography on Photography: Reflections on the Medium since 1960,"" which included a great piece of photographed green screen that was transmitted and pixelated on a computer monitor. (Wow, my art descriptions are really not exciting.)Finally, Jeff Koons on the Roof was really fun, especially since it was so nice and sunny outside. It consisted of three pieces, one of which was a bright balloon dog made of aluminum (I think). This also runs through October 2008. (I've added a photo of the dog.)For those who are visiting for the first time, I would suggest wearing comfortable shoes, start as early as possible if you want to see everything, be ready to shell out a pretty penny for the cafeteria food and be ready to ask the staff the best way out if you get turned around (which still happens to me in the damn European Sculpture section).",1,0,1,Kim B.,"New York, NY",34,195,19

I love this museum so much, and hold it in such high regard, that I'm currently interning with them!The Met is HUGE, so its best to do it over several visits. But if you can't do that because you're only in New York for a short period of time, choose the galleries you're interested in the most, and definitely make special exhibits your priority (skip the modern art galleries, unless they have a special exhibit, and go to the MoMA instead). Their collections are truly amazing and of such high quality that it is a must for any visitor to NYC. If you have the energy, you could see the entire museum in one day (like Friday or Saturday when its open late), and the new cafeteria is rather good with a wide selection of rotating menus.Egyptian Art is a must for a first time visitor, and I personally love walking through the Ancient Greek and Roman Galleries on my way to the Arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas (my favorite gallery), but the Met encompasses so such that its hard to not find someplace to go if you are a lover of art.",1,0,1,Zoe P.,"New Haven, CT",166,742,17

But being the egyptian history nerd that I am, their collection of Egyptian art and artifacts and the fact that they even imported an entire temple from Egypt and rebuilt it would make me go back here any day!! I have never been to a museum that has had so much Egyptian art all in one place! Some hallways were just plastered with various wall paintings and hieroglyphics you could probably stand there for an hour looking at each wall!! And being able to actually walk inside of a temple that was flown across the world and then rebuilt was an experience all on its own. I have always wanted to go to Egypt and this brought my one step closer.In addition to the Egyptian art, they have a large european collection of art, a lot of photography, japanese art, modern art, middle eastern art...the list goes on and on!! We came at the end of the day and I wish we had come earlier because it was quite crowded, but I was glad that we both still had our student IDs from when we were in college last year because if you flash that when you buy your admission ticket it is half off!! It is only $10 then instead of $20. But you know what the sad thing is?? The senior admission price is $15!!! That just doesn't make sense to me, but oh well I guess. Definitely go here, but go with enough time to give it justice!!

I specifically went today to let my inner comic geek out and view The Superheroes Costume Exhibit.  It is WOW, POW, BLAM, wicked awesome and cool!!!Fave costumes were Superman, Catwoman and Mystique from X-Men. You definitely learn um. . .the dimensions of the actors/ actresses who wore them.  The superhero inspired couture by Galliano, Armani, Thierry Mugler and others were cool too.  I was quite surprised by Galliano's Spiderman themed dress as it was on the conservative side (I'm used to his clothes being more outlandish and edgy). Anyway around the corner you'll find his M.O. wear and all is right again.    The Jeff Koons rooftop exhibit is not to be missed as well.  It's so charming and extremely well executed that I couldn't fathom how he was able to manipulate stainless steel into looking like ginormous, mylar balloons!  I wanted to touch the ""Sacred Heart"" to see if it was indeed stainless steel and give the green balloon dog a squish. The hours it must have taken.  It's insane!  All this with this gorgeous backdrop of Central Park and The City.  Seriously I couldn't ask for a better way to spend the day!Another exhibit to check out is the Gustave Courbet which is ending soon.  It is extremely large but well worth the time to view. The collection and artist are very diverse-from landscape, still-life, self-portraits, nudes which are all done mostly in oils but he also has charcoal sketches.  Mr. Courbet in his day would be an interesting fellow to meet and such a great talent.  This is easily one of the greatest museums in the world.  The Louvre edges out only because it is located in a former palace and contains portraits from Da Vinci.  However, proximity is key and The Met will forever be my favorite museum to visit.

The Temple of Dendur:  I love the juxtaposition of the ancient temple with the modern architecture - the glass window that overlooks Central Park.  Every time I walk in that room I gain a sense of calm.  2. Studiolo Gubbio (or something like that): Basically, its a room where the walls are made entirely of inlaid wood.  Doesn't sound so amazing but you have to see it.  The inlaid wood is amazingly intricate revealing shelves with books and other objects evoking a sense of dimensionality while the wall is flat.  Everyone I take to that room thinks its cool and its one of the lesser known cool things at the Met.  Its hard to find so I always go to the area its by & then ask a guard how to get there.3.  The sculpture garden:  Some really beautiful sculptures in here with glass ceiling.  Collection ranges from ancient classical sculptures to modern.  4.  European: Very broad collection and many of the painters you studied in Art History 101.  Includes David's ""The Death of Socrates""5.  Modern art:  I liked this section - has some Matisse, some O'Keefe, some Picasso as well as many others.  The Met is great because like the Louvre it has such a diverse range of art.  Some lament that this makes the museums ""too grand"" for one to peruse in one day but thats really the beauty of these places.  You can't see it all in a single day and you will never see everything with new exhibits continuously coming.  It allows you to discover something new and re-visit your favorites every time you return.",1,0,1,Amanda M.,"Miami, FL",165,429,216

There were several groups going through the exhibits but I never felt like I was being pushed around or it being overly too crowded.I wanted to go in to see the Temple of Dendur, but unfortunately it was closed for renovation and I only discovered this after my contribution.

5.0,3/5/2008,"The Metropolitan Museum of Art is the place where you can visit the world and enter another time and place.  Simply one of the my most favorite places in the world.  The design and architecture in itself is impeccable, and you certainly feel as though you are no longer part of the NYC hustle and bustle, and you can for a few hours or longer (depending on your stamina) lose yourself in the beauty and magnitude that is the Metropolitan Museum of Art.My Wife and I had our first date here, and since that day it has been the place of many memorable experiences of ours.   I could think of no better place in the world to propose to her and I was able to do it on the balcony overlooking the American Wing (where all the statues, and Tiffany Stained Glass are).  We will always have this Museum in our hearts and it will forever be a part of our lives.As for your visit here.  Obviously the Roman Court, Greek Statues, Temple of Dendur and the Egyptian Exhibits, Arms and Armor, Rembrandt, Vermeer, the Impressionist Period are  a must.  You could literally spend a day in each of those sections just reading all the descriptions and getting lost in the moments.  One of my more favorite sections is the Asian Wing.   A much quieter section, so it allows you to relax and perhaps meditate.  I love the Gardens there as well as the Chinese and Japanese art works.The Met's rooftop in the Spring and Summer is an excellent place to meet friends or for a date.   The view of Central Park is spectacular, and you get  a nice panorama of the City.  This is especially nice since 99.99999% of the population does not have the luxury of owning a Central Park View apartment on 5th Avenue or Central Park West.So whether you guys are battled hardened New Yorkers or tourists in town, this place is an absolute must.  There is no other Museum in New York, or the country that compares.  They have the most amazing and diverse special exhibits and everything is well maintained.",4,0,3,Brandon I.,"New York, NY",2,19,19
4.0,3/3/2008,"It was large and totally in charge. There was so many things to see. You should not be able to finish all in one day. You would need to take a break to get it all done. There is a temple that they are currently importing and it looks pretty cool. There is a large stone court area that you can sit, stand, or lay down at. There is small water thing that is supposed to resemble a river or something. Anyway, there is also a lot of painting. More paintings than you can shake a fist at. There is also armour, armour and more armour. Oh and guns. Old guns. Old original guns. They look really nice. I'm sure they hurt if you get shot by them. We also saw some swords. Takezo Kensei, not a real person. There is too much for me to write about and I'm sure it might not all be that interesting so I'll end off by saying that this museum is one of those that you should go to once...not expect to go through it all and maybe even want to go back again.

5.0,2/25/2008,"I guess it is kind of obvious that a beautifully designed, world renowned museum that takes up 3 city blocks in Manhattan would get 5 stars. I am not feeling very unique here, but damn- this is one incredible museum!The place is huge so you have to come to grips immediately with the fact that you are not going to see all the cool stuff that you really, really want to see when you look at the museum map. I definitely suggest checking out the Temple of Dandur. It's an actual ancient Egyptian temple that was shipped to the US in the 1960's as a gesture of goodwill from Egypt and reconstructed inside the museum. It's a breathtaking piece of human history, artfully displayed in a cavernous room with glass ceilings and walls, which creates this really cool ""ancient civilization, modern civilization"" juxtaposition. There is an entire wall of hieroglyphic fragments that is explained in painstaking detail if you have the time/inclination to read it (I got about halfway through). The temple is just a piece of the Egyptian collection, which takes up something like 10 rooms and is one of dozens of huge collections at the museum. Just to give you a sense of the scope we're talking about here.I took a ""wander around and check out bits and pieces"" approach to the Met which gave me glimpses into an amazing variety of different displays and artists, just some of whom were Poussin, Goya, El Greco, Ghirlandaio, Monet, Manet, Jasper Johns, Gaughin, Rousseau and Van Gogh. (The Van Gogh's in the collection are heartrendingly beautiful by the way.)It will come as no surprise that the museum cafe is overpriced but the food is not as bad as it could be, and indeed is in many museums.

The Gates of Paradise?...NOT TO BE MISSED...Why?  These 3 panels have been recently restored and will be permanently located in Italy once the restoration is complete.  If you are planning a trip to Florence, you can check them out there in their full and wholly complete glory.  If you are Jewish or Christian the narratives will make perfect sense to you.  But if you are Agnostic, like me, you might have a greater appreciation for Ghiberti's use of Renaissance perspective and the variations from low to high relief.  Hurry...it's closing January 13, 2008.  Baroque Christmas Tree?...This tree always creeps me out.  Medieval Catholicism is just frightening!  In fact, this whole gallery sort of creeps me out.  If you want your children to think Santa is evil, just show them this tree.Greek and Roman art?...This is the coolest addition to the museum that I've seen in 17 years.  When you walk into the museum, it is the first hall to your left (don't forget to pay admission first and check your coat).  Even if you don't know a thing about Ancient Greece and Rome it will still intrigue you.",0,0,0,s r.,"Beverly Hills, CA",168,376,49

5.0,11/23/2007,"When an art museum doubles as a hangout spot for kids and adults of all ages, you know they're doing something right. The first evidence of this is when you see the countless people sitting, reading, eating, and just generally schmoozing on the front steps, no matter what the weather may be that day.Inside is even better. If you're new to the place, you will DEFINITELY need a map. The place is huge, majestic, and maze-like, and if you're not sure where you're going you're bound to get lost at some point or another. The guards are helpful with directions, but you should definitely carry a map around with you anyway (they're big and blue, and available right at the front kiosk in the lobby).The Met carries one of the biggest and most varied collections I've ever seen. It's like walking through and experiencing history itself. Their Greek and Roman galleries are superb, as are the Renaissance and Baroque rooms. The Renaissance art galleries are amazing as well, if you're not bored by religious paintings. They actually exhibit the original Madonna and Child by Duccio, which is just as famous and important as Da Vinci's Madonna in the Louvre in Paris (although Duccio's work is less obsessed over and publicized). And of course, there's also the famous George Washington Crossing the Delaware painting in the American Galleries. All in all it's fantastically preserved stuff, with very informative plaques nearby. It's really a thrill to walk through the place and know that it's one of the leading museums in the world, with such a phenomenal collection. The audio tour is interesting, but not necessary (though it may give you a broader scope of things, as it's akin to a private tour at your own pace). If you're an artist or art student, bring your sketchbook - this is a prime place to do impromptu sketching. They even offer art classes, which are actually pretty cool. The food court is also affordable, considering the crazy prices most museums charge for snacks.The temporary exhibits they show are often very interesting. I'd highly recommend signing up for a notification email from the website, so they can e-poke you about each month's exhibits and special deals.IMPORTANT NOTE: You do NOT need to pay the ""suggested donation"" to get in (I think these days it's $15 or something). It's ""suggested"" for a reason. Hell, it used to be free. Now however, you can give them as little as 25 cents and they'll happily hand you a pin, no questions asked. I do that every time, and the most I've gotten was a bemused smile by the woman behind the counter. Don't feel guilty about giving less than they suggest - that's just stupid. (If it really wrenches your moral fiber, you can flash a student ID card to justify your discount.) They get mountains of donations from rich people and organizations ever year, so don't feel obligated to stretch your wallet just to enjoy your day.

Statues are boring!Second, I feel like the Met isn't as good as the British Museum or the V&A in London.Also, the Met is always soooooo crowded.  It's kind of a bummer.  The roof top garden is really nice- when we there this past week they had some cool frank stella sculptures to look at whilst we sipped our coffee and gazed at central park.",2,0,3,scott p.,"San Diego, CA",196,857,80

The much-ballyhooed, best-in-America, so-big-you'll-get-lost -in-it Met?It does hold a ton of art, and the Modern wing was pretty impressive. A seemingly thorough cross-section of the 20th century that introduced me to some new artists.  And if you like ancient art, Egyptian and Roman and Greek vases and statues and the like, then you're in luck. I feel more cultured for having been. But I was most certainly not blown away. It felt about the same size as the Art Institute of Chicago and a lot of it was the aforementioned ancient art, swords, etc that don't do much for me.Disclaimer: the 19th century European art wing was closed for renovation which could have easily resulted in another 1-2 stars.",2,1,1,Geoff M.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,112,2

So, the museum is a great mix of world art history and now I can say I've been there.  So, nyah.  I really did like the statues of the gods and, yes, all the marble columns.Why the 4th star?  Two reasons:  1) informative staff and 2) the view from the roof of the downtown skyline atop the tree canopy of central park.

I'll also tell you a funny story ... my family came to visit me post-9/11 and we went to the Met. Most of my family wanted to sharp shoot and focus on the Temple, the rooftop garden, etc. My frugal father wanted to fully depreciate the cost of his ticket and stayed behind on his own. Slightly compulsive, dad returned 7 hours later looking like he had been hit by a Mack truck. I said "" Dad, what did you see?"" ""Everything."" ""What do you mean 'everything'"". ""I mean everything. And I read all those tiny little plaques. My eyes are killing me."" ""Are you kidding me? What was your main takeaway?"" ""The Spaniards were jerks. Pillagers. Thieves.""

It's in Central Park and suggested donation. The only thing cooler than that is free. When I was there, there were a lot of tourists and every corner I turned there was someone speaking a new language. Very euro in that way.I started at the top and worked my way through the European art. Some of my favorites included, The Penitent Magdalen by Georges de la Tour, Diana & Cupid by Batoni, and the Denial of St. Peter by Caravaggio. The rest of the time I stumbled on things by accident, like the musical instruments, and the CAFE that smelled divine.Sculpture isn't really my cup of tea but anything that reminds of my time in Rome is an exception so I was happy to wander through the new Greek and Roman art expansion on the south side of the museum.LOVED LOVED LOVED Poiret's fashion exhibit! All his designs were inspired by his wife and the quality of clothing was a sight to behold. Fashion as art is coming back into style and I'm so excited. There really is something about vintage clothes and the skill and detail that makes it worthy of display.This place is CRAZY BIG!

The Met has a lot of great art and I love walking through the Asian and Greek sculpture wings, and there are great Renoir and Degas collections (plus a Matisse painting called ""The Pineapple"" - oh how I am obsessed with the fruit called pineapple) but I have to say art wise I like the Art Institute of Chicago better. Sorry! However combining the art at the Met and Moma would surpass Chicago...My only true complaint: please don't label the postcard and print section as ""Art from the Metropolitan Museum of Art,"" when I KNOW the items came from elsewhere.

5.0,4/16/2007,"It's kinda hard to sum up the MET in a meer paragraph. Originally, I wasn't even gonna try, but since the last review of the MET was dumpest thing Ive ever heard, I'll give it a shot. I've probably gone to the MET a thousand times, since I was able to walk my mom brought me here. I was immediatly drawn to the Arms and Armor exhibit, what little boy isn't?? But as I got older I began to grow found of the Impressionist, and Egyptian collections. There are so many amazing Monets, Van Goghs, and of course there is a temple imported from Egypt and reconstructed inside the museum. Show me a museum on this side of the Atlantic, that can beat that. But these are all the attractions, that all the tourists come for. The MET also has an incredible Modern art collection. Even though is small in comparison to the MOMA's, the MET certainly is #2 in town over the Guggenheim, and the Whitney. Just to name a few, the collection ranges from some amazing early Picassos (Portait of Gertude Stein, how is that not standout??) and even a few Dali's, to Pollock, Warhol, and even a great Chuck Close. If your not into Modern art, there is a superb American Art Exhibit ( they have Washington crossing the Deleware River). Theres also the Far East Wing. I spent many early mornings here (9:30 in the morning most of the museum is empty), because they have a little Japanse Cloister, which they also imported. Inside of this little cloister, you baiscally experience the most peaceful feeling inside. Like suddenly your no longer in the craziest city in the world, your in a garden meditating with Taoist monks. Essentially, this is one of the greatest museums in the world. I didn't even mention, the ancient Mesopotamian, African, Gothic, and European wings(there are Rapaels, Davids,Vermeers, Vasquezes, and EL Greccos, OH MIgh!!).

It was so cool to see what the statues SHOULD have looked like in Vegas, In Vegas, they try their best in theme park artist studios to recreate in fiberglass and wood the beauty of real artists, but no, the proportions are all wrong, and they throw stuff together, doing their best in some California workshop to copy art.Inside the Met, look at the marble statues. This is what they were trying to do, it looked like a moment in time, draped fabric and skin and fingers that were magically frozen and turned to marble, so sensual and real, you just want to crawl up there and caress their skin  and fingers and fabric because it looks so tantalizing, so inviting, I was sure I would feel bones underneath if I could just touch it.I tried to call for cocktails but no one came and even the security guards didn't know where the hell the roulette wheels were. Dreadful!I still haven't seen the whole museum, it's so overwhelming, but I go whenever I can.

5.0,12/30/2006,"Who would ever give the Met a bad review?  It's an awesome museum.  But everyone knows that.  No one even needs to read reviews to decide if they want to go.  The only reason I'm reviewing is so that I can put this on a list.However, I will say that if you're visiting NYC, plan to spend at least two days here.  Don't try to do it all in one day over several hours.  Just split it up into two days and visit some other places during the day, too.  That way you won't get burned out and can still see everything.  I came here over the course of 3 days in 4 hour chunks and still didn't see everything.If you live in NYC, come as often as you can.  Make it a goal to visit every permanent collection at least once and to see the special exhibits.When to come: The best time is on a weekday.  If it's not a holiday season (or the summer) then any time on a weekday you'll avoid crowds except for Fridays, which get annoying around mid-day.  Weekends in the morning are okay, but I wouldn't set foot inside after noon.Eating There: Unless you're really, really hungry or have a reservation at one of the restaurant things (I can't keep up with the sit down eating situation here, it changes all the time) then don't bother witht he cafes and such.  The food and drinks are overpriced.  Instead, plan to eat before you come or after you leave.  Unfortunately, there aren't many restaurants right in that area.  The ones within walking distance can be worth it, but then it's better to get out and eat and go somewhere else instead of going back in.  If you're looking for a snack, just go to the hot dog and pretzel vendors outside then come back in.The Met is a donation museum, which means they technically have to let you in, even if you only pay a penny.  I pay a dollar because I do come here a lot.  If you're a tourist, please pay as much as you can to support this great institution.  It's so annoying to find that important places like the met or the Library have to cut back on resources or shorten their hours because our society doesn't deem art and books as high-priority as Paris Hilton's latest escapade.",4,0,1,Tempest B.,"Portland, OR",231,370,86

5.0,11/11/2005,"Everyone loves The Met, and for once I absolutely agree with everyone.  The Met is so sweet it makes sugar seem like poo.Some of the neatest things I've seen here have been in the costume archives on the bottomest floor of the building.  The Met is so huge and overwhelming that you can't see everything in one trip, so you'll probably be tempted to skip the downstairs area by the time you find it, but try not to do that if you can help it at all.The Egyptian temple surrounded by disney-style bright blue water is a deliciously unethical experience.  It's very weird and good.  I've seen it a lot of times but it is still my first stop on almost every trip I take to The Met.  It's like some kinda freaky aesthetically-powered magnet.The Met is officially pay-what-you-can, so you can get in for like a quarter if you don't mind looking like a jerk.",0,3,1,Megan C.,"San Francisco, CA",37,138,236
4.0,11/8/2005,Visited the Met on April 7 and have to agree that it is a great museum - overwhelming in fact.Your best strategy is to arrive at the 9:30 a.m opening -- the crowds really get going by midday. And the food is outrageous and service slow. But it is hard to put 3-4 hours in and not stop for a refreshment.Also avoid coat check if you can. We checked coats when we got there at the opening but by the time we left there was a 20 minute wait to get the garmet back.To get the most out of it go to their website and pick out certain art styles or exhibits you would like to see and target them. You will never come close to seeing it all in one day.,0,0,0,Steve M.,"New Hyde Park, NY",3,528,0

5.0,10/9/2005,"The Met is to New York City what the Louvre (spelling?) is to Paris.  If you live in the city and have not been to the Met, then you have issues.  No words to describe this place; you'd be blown away even if you hate art.  If you want to go someplace quiet, someplace away from the city, but still be inspired, this is the place to go.  I love their wide spacious exhibits.",0,0,0,Li M.,"New York, NY",71,568,0
5.0,9/29/2005,"This museum is world famous for a reason. It's packed to the brim with beautiful exhibits and there is simply too much to see in just a one day visit. If you are in New York, you can't not visit the Met. It's a great experience and a perfect way to spend a day, whether you are a tourist of have lived in the city your whole life. I'm always amazed at city residents who have never been here. People travel from all over the world to come here, and it's in your backyard and you're ignoring it. If you're reading this to see if you should check the Met out, the answer is yes. Now get up and go!",0,0,0,alicia v.,"Hauppauge, NY",25,224,9
5.0,9/26/2005,"This spectacular museum earns its reputation as one of the world's finest. The imposing building itself is beautiful, as is the Great Lawn which lies directly west. Start with Medieval Art, then hit European Paintings (make sure to stop by the Lehman Gallery), then Arms and Armor (a male favorite) and make sure to save time for the Temple of Dendur and the 5th floor observation deck--the view is breathtaking and it's a divine place to have a cocktail. If you're ambitious enough, travel uptown to the Cloisters for some added Medieval sculpture and illuminated manuscripts--admission is included in your donation to the main museum.",1,0,0,Angela L.,"Highland, NY",3,113,57
5.0,7/30/2005,"If you were to arrive when it opened and stayed 'til it closed every day for a week, you still wouldn't be able to do it justice. One of the finest museums in the world, and I've been fortunate enough to have been in many of them. If you're in town for the holidays, stop in if only to see the magnificent Christmas tree, but you'll be shortchanging yourself if you don't hang around for more.",6,0,8,Gourmet G.,"San Francisco, CA",99,2099,2099
5.0,5/31/2005,"I have never suffered a case of museum glaze as bad as every time I go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. At about the fourth or fifth hour, I can't read any more legends, and I'm stuck in a zombie-like state, wandering around the halls with eyes that no longer blink, until I manage to step out the door, breathe some fresh air and collapse into a seat on a subway car or in a pizza place. It's enough to make you feel sick.",1,1,1,Ryan H.,"Cohoes, NY",49,393,277
5.0,4/3/2005,"How do you write about the Met? This place has been a source of breathless awe since I was a little girl and would come to New York on visits. You could go here every day and see something new. From the exquisite Chinese pottery to the huge atrium in the American wing with the mother of pearl Tiffany fountain to the hall of armor to the Vermeers to the medieval tapestries to the decorative arts rooms to the Temple of Dendur to the roof sculpture garden to the Fashion Institute. I don't know where to begin or stop, and I haven't even gotten to all the stuff I don't know about. They have wonderful changing exhibitions (although they never sell postcards of the things I want) and a great giftshop, which, according to the New York Times, is now selling luxury jewelry replicas for up to $60,000. Nowhere else will you see such a range of people in one place. Even the lobby, full of fragrant lilies in enormous bouquets (endowed by Lila Acheson Wallace in perpetuity) is an uplifting--nay, enrapturing--experience.",0,0,2,Arwen O.,"San Francisco, CA",57,561,88
