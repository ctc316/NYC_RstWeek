First class food, amazing service and really interesting drinks.  Not over the top pricing either (for NYC).  Definitely recommend if you are looking for something different.  A bit hard to find given that RJ building is under renovation, but it is certainly worth it.  The views are insane.",0,0,0,Bob P.,"Lone Tree, CO",1,43,41

2.0,4/21/2019,"I'm not sure how many stars to give Gaonnuri. I went for a business dinner where someone else paid the bill and had an amazing table, service and food. I recommended it to my 17 year old son, whose girlfriend loves Korean BBQ. He did everything right. He called 2 weeks in advance to make a reservation, requested a table near the window and a table with the grill. He called a 2nd time to insure that all would go as planned as it was a special night for him and when he arrived, well dressed and on time, the staff was rude and told him there were no tables near the window available and that he should have called ahead. Not cool.  Yes, the food is good at Gaonnuri, and if you're lucky to score a table by the window then it's even better, but when you're treated poorly, it ruins everything. There are plenty of other amazing Korean BBQ places in NYC, we'll spend our hard earned money at one of those.",0,0,0,Kristy C.,"Tenafly, NJ",1,38,3
5.0,4/16/2019,"Wow, this place is spectacular! The food and service are amazing - we split the table barbecue combo for two, which came with prime ribeye, plain and marinated short ribs, and bulgolgi. Everything was delicious and the ribeye was nice and tender. The sides are wonderful too - you get generous portions of pickled radish, kim chi, pickled cucumber, roasted squash and sauces. The real standout was the scallion salad, which was dressed in a perfectly balanced sweet/salty/spicy dressing. The combo comes with rice - we opted for the multigrain instead of plain. The multigrain rice includes several types of beans, so it has a unique creamy, nutty texture.Tip: we walked in on a Monday night without reservations and were seated right away in a booth. However, if you want a window seat to enjoy the skyline views, be sure to make a reservation in advance.",0,0,0,Cindy C.,"Maplewood, NJ",5,69,120

I always loved the idea of cooking your own food but Gaonnuri is more upscale so you feel fancier doing it lol. The drinks are also to die for & very strong lol.

3.0,2/14/2019,"This is my go-to place for fancy dinners. It's beautifully laid out, has most of the Korean dishes you'd want, and the service is generally pretty quick. I'm a huge fan of the scallion pancake in particular. I don't know how they do it, but they bring an incredible flavor to the fried scallion pancake, which is a dish I've had at a million NYC restaurants. Every so often I think about that scallion pancake and my mouth waters. That said, I found the rest of the menu a bit disappointing. I've had the beef bibimbap there as well as some of the soups and the Korean-style barbecue meats. They're very good, but not clearly better than stuff I can get for $15 at smaller places in K-Town. The high prices here aren't paying for exquisite food; they're paying for a fancy place with a great view. That's one last thing to keep in mind: If you can, try to get a table by the windows. You'll get a spectacular view of Manhattan from there. If you're at one of the center tables, it's a bit darker and mustier. I actually had trouble reading the menu.",0,0,0,Monica C.,"Lakeville, Salisbury, CT",330,21,0
5.0,2/12/2019,"We arrived early on a Saturday evening for our reservations. We were sad immediately with a beautiful window table to catch an absolutely amazing sunset across the skyline of New York City. This restaurant is located just steps from Penn station. The elevator takes you up to the 39th floor and opens right into the bar area. Definitely a spot to catch a sunset if you just want to grab a drink. There is plenty of seating for the bar area. Bathrooms are right off the elevator as well. We chose to have dinner here and we're not disappointed. This is a Korean barbecue establishment. You have the option to have the food cooked at your table or in the kitchen. We all chose the prefix menu which included an appetizer. Main and dessert all main courses come with sides. Rib eye and short rib were cooked perfectly with great flavor. In addition to the meat we also had the salmon that was excellent. The calamari app, the octopus app, the mushrooms and the eggplant app were very good however the  app was the smallest out of the four. Our dessert was a sorbet with a brownie that I believe it was A green tea brownie excellent. Service was good drinks were delicious. Overall we had a wonderful experience. no one rushed us we hung out took pictures, enjoyed the views and food",2,1,2,Suzanne F.,"Lindenhurst, NY",282,292,769
2.0,2/8/2019,This is a place that you go to enjoy the view and hopefully get distracted enough to not realize that you're not eating good food. Meats are severely under flavored. Not even a sprinkle of salt while on the grill. The staff consistently forgot to bring our orders out and then forgot one of our parties drink order each round. They also tried to keep giving us a gin/tonic that no one of my group ordered. Bottom line: do it for the insta story of you want. Food wise go somewhere else.,0,1,0,Marion M.,"East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY",4,20,1

Korean-Style BBQ, and an assortment of Korean classics-- all were quite good. There wasn't enough spice for my tastes-- food was all good-- and the view was quite nice-- I won't be rushing back here however as there is much better food in Ktown as well as a bit less rushed service.

We heard that we were really paying for the views of the New York skyline on the penthouse of this restaurant. But we went during Restaurant Week and opted for the 3 course for $42 menu. I had the jopchae which was very nice. For the entree I had bibimbap with side dishes with good portions. For dessert we had matcha brownie with Yuzu ice cream which was light and refreshing. The service was great, our water glasses were always refilled and side dishes replenished without any prompting. The view was beautiful as well.

3.0,2/3/2019,"Gaonnuri is really an upscale Korean restaurant. It is located on the 39th floor of a building. I would not have come here if it wasn't for Restaurant Week.I came here with my friend to celebrate my college graduation. She made a reservation in advance for dinner on a Wednesday, with the request of window seats. When we arrived for our 7:15pm reservation, we weren't given window seats because they were all, supposedly booked, but we saw a couple of empty tables by the windows.We ordered from the Restaurant Week menu. As an appetizer, I got the Haemul Pajun (scallion pancake with calamari, clam, and shrimp) and the Bibimbap Hot Stone Bowl with Spicy Pork for my entree. At the end, the chef's choice dessert was matcha brownie with a small scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. This was a total of $42 plus tax. We also got the Taste of Korea ($20).The quality of the food was not worth the price. The scallion pancake and the bibimbap were okay, but I could have gotten it at some other Korean restaurant in K-Town that tasted a lot better and was a lot cheaper. The green-looking veggie in the bibimbap was not that great and I should have taken it out before my waiter mixed it. The chef's choice dessert was good and was nothing special.The service, here, was alright. The food came in a timely manner and the server checked in with us, to see how the food was, which was nice at the beginning. However, we kind of disliked, after a while, how the server constantly kept checking in with us like every 5 minutes or so, while we were munching on our food. We just wanted to enjoy our food without the constant interruptions.I, honestly, would not recommend this place if you're looking to get Korean food. The food, here, is way overpriced. I have had better Korean food. However, this fancy restaurant would be nice to take someone for a date, which has a beautiful view of NYC skyline at night. This place, also has a fancy glass-enclosed wine cellar.",0,0,0,Jenny L.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,51,291

My friend and I opted for the restaurant week menu, and sampled the seafood pancake, bossam, marinated galbi, and spicy pork bibimbap.

It's located on the 39th floor of an office building. They also have a business / smart causal dress code. I have been here twice for date nights and it's been nice experience. The entrees are on the pricier side and it's about $25+. You're pretty much paying for the view and experience here. I have tried their hot stone bowl bibimbap and most recently the galbi tang. I enjoyed both of my meals here, but I thought that my galbi tang soup was salty. They will also give you four side dishes here too.We didn't make any reservations prior and we were lucky to get seated quickly every time. Although, other Yelp reviewers suggest to make a reservation. Overall, the food was good and the views are great at night. Come here at least once for the experience.

I had the thin sliced beef and it tasted very much like shaved beef you would use for a cheese steak. The dipping sauces were unremarkable and the sides were tasty but they're quite stingy with the amount.   If you are looking for great views and photo opportunities with friends, while not being particularly concerned with an amazing food experience, this is the place for you!",1,0,0,Theresa E.,"Monroe, NC",268,181,122

And, the options are extremely limited if you're a person with multiple allergies.So, unless you're fortunate enough to get a window seat, you can only glance from time to time to ""admire"" the view. You can request for a window seat, and get seated nowhere near one.

If you don't ask for it in the reservation, you're not guaranteed either.For dinner, we went with the New Years course menu. This was their version of a tasting menu. It was $135 per person, but it was definitely worth it. You get a total of 7 dishes and each portion was perfectly sized. Pictures show how beautiful the plating was.The service was a little slow, but they were attentive whenever I needed something. I really applaud the front house manager for being into of everything.

The view was truly unbeatable from the penthouse on the 39th floor, and we were lucky to get the window table as requested because the restaurant was not busy during the time, surprisingly. I'll be straight forward--food was authentic enough but not the best korean food I've had in tri-state area; price was fine given its convenient location and excellent view; atmosphere was good, would be ideal for a date night.The only problem I had was with this one waiter. Not any other friendly and courteous waitresses but this one guy. For a semi-pricy restaurant in a fancy gated building, I'd think they are more high-end dining and expected corresponding quality in service. But he never had a smile on his face at least not during our dining in. It was towards the end when he came to refill our water glasses, he knocked my spoon from the utensil rest onto the table top. I was almost done eating so I thought I'd tell him not need to replace...but I was wrong because he didn't offer or say anything. Isn't that weird?!?! Soon after that my friend found him dripped quite an amount of water on her coat on the chair back from him pouring water before. Very unprofessional that he could've at least said something to inform. We only wanted to tip the 15% minimum for lunch because of this, but only to find out they've included the 18% gratuity in the bill...that was an annoying way to force tip:(I'll look somewhere else for dining at a restaurant with city view.

Yes, it has the view of the city. But also the view is paid on the high price of the meal. The food was not bad but about $10~15 more expensive than other restaurants. The reason why I gave 2 stars is that they refused to validate the parking. They said they only validate for parking after 5PM. The parking at the building cost $39. REDICULOUS!!

We had made a reservation, and were seated at a table, not next to the window, but still with an excellent view nonetheless. The three of us chose from the restaurant week menu, which included a selection of barbecued meats which would be cooked for us at the table by staff. The staff, though attentive, seemed quite busy, and were managing several different tables. The food cooked in the kitchen was not bad but mediocre at best, from the appetizers, nothing really was worth coming back for. I had a similar feeling about the meats, which also were slightly over cooked due to the staff not being at the table to cook the entire time. While the average experience may have been a consequence of restaurant week menus and chaos, it left us with an unimpressive memory of Gaonnuri.",1,0,0,Su L.,"Manhattan, NY",122,267,1105

3.0,9/20/2018,"Gaonnuri is an upscale styled Korean restaurant, specializing in tabletop barbecue. I don't usually comment on the décor of restaurants, but Gaonnuri has a nice view of the city. If you're reserving a seat, get something by the window.On this Wednesday night I did not make a reservation and the tables with a grill built in were taken, so we got a table with no grill. But we were still able to order table barbecue and ordered the combo 1. Combo 1 includes Marinated Galbi, Prime Ribeye and Bulgogi.Banchan were of course included. And we also ordered the house Makgeolli.  The Makgeolli was surprisingly good. Makgeolli typically has a bland flavor, but this brew had a subtle complexity. Light alcohol flavor and light carbonation.I get the feeling this kimchi is made in house as it as a young and crisp texture. The flavor is light and clean, not loaded with thick kimchi paste. Nice acidic lacto-fermented flavor.  The ginger, pepper and garlic flavor is subtle. Some chunks of pepper give a nice low heat. Other banchan included pickled cucumbers smothered in a hot relish, roasted potatoes, pickled radish and greens lightly tossed in a soy based dressing. The pickled cucumbers were quite nice with the soft crunch and hot relish. Potatoes had a nice charred complexity on the skin, with a soft fluffy inside.Standard rice in the metal bowl. Soft and sticky. Slightly sweet. Satisfactory. The bulgogi was lightly seasoned and has a sesame flavor. Texture is soft and chewy, but I would have liked some more searing and a more savory seasoning. Galbi has a slight charred crust and soy garlic marinade. A little but chewy and on the tough side.The ribeye was also tough. Slight char, but cooked medium well.  Not the biggest pleasure to eat. On the tough side and required a good amount of effort to chew. Not much going on here flavor wise. I'd really prefer the meat to be more tender, and to a have an elegant crust. I think the Banchan at Gaonnuri may be better than the meat, at least the beef. The kimchi is praiseworthy to be sure. If I return, I might opt for the individual entrees over the table barbecue.",3,0,0,Steven B.,"Boston, MA",30,176,1044

Didn't expect the haemul pajun to be like a literal pancake of the seafood but it was still good. Then for the table bbq we got duck breast and bulgogi. The duck breast was chewier than the bulgogi-not bad but just explaining difference. We enjoyed and were full after all the side dishes -cucumber, peppered cabbage, white rice, etc. The drinks were great! I had a Pom-zu at the bar waiting for our table. It was like a better margarita. My boyfriend ordered a drink with matcha which he didn't like, I thought it was refreshing. Then he bought the Hudson smash which he loved. I didn't too much. Didn't care for the basil in it. Overall we had a great time. More fancy experience than the other Korean bbq spot we went to. Pricier, as well.

The waiter will cook for you so no worries there. Also no fears about leaving with KBBQ smell so sensitive noses rejoice! Dessert was a chefs choice of matcha ice cream and a chocolate mousse.

2.0,8/12/2018,"I went to Gaonnuri on last Fri evening 8/10 with my friend for her Bday and sat at the table T2 ! I have such a highest expectation of finding a new and special Korean restaurant in my hood but turned out to be disappointment after disappointment ! I was so impressed by high ceiling and an amazing dinning atmosphere at first but not until we sat down at table T2 and served by a bald and a little obese Korean waiter with attitude !! We don't paid attention to his attitude at first but he is not getting better ! The food quality was average and not something we will die for !! The Korean appetizer was not impressive with 4 very inexpensive stuffs like regular grill potato , kimchi or something I don't even remembered !!! The food also came with a small potion with higher price tag !! Anyway I expected to spend the money but not the bad service from one of a waiter !!! It's extremely disappointed !! I also realized that they have a lots of regular out of town Korean tourists allover the place and make this restaurant less special !! We just want to make sure we are not judging him by mistake and tried to talk to a young couple next to us ! They are an young Indian couple ,they are very nice and educated that they felt the same way of the same waiter ! Of course the waiter wasn't saying anything or greeting the customer when we were sitting on the table and walking passed him on our way out to the elevator !! But he expecting us to offered him a good tips , I still paid him 18% for not doing much and attitude !! I found it very ridiculous and gave me a motivation to call the restaurant for our comment !!After dinning , just want to call to the restaurant on my way back home to share some of our comments about our not satisfied dinning experience of the night ! I ended up talked to 1 of the male manager ( forgot his name ) and tried to let him know our bad dinning experience with the specific waiter that served our table and next ! But I strongly felt the manager just try to blow me off by saying something very diplomatic and less apologetic !! It was very obvious he has NO intention for him to get into the bottom of the story or try to talk to the specific waiter to see what 's his side of the story or improved the service that up to the standard of the price tag !! It was very frustrating !!! Anyway we are not planning to go back soon ! Good luck with the waiter with an attitude and bad managment after spending all the money there !! It just an expensive touristy place with regular service after all !!!",2,0,0,Gary W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0

It was definitely worth the trip to check it out.  I then saw that this restaurant was participating in NYC's Restaurant Week so I made a reservation and requested a table by the window.  when I got there, window seats were all booked, so my friend and I were seated on the Mezzanine facing the west side during sunset....still with amazing views!  We were provided with menus and drink options.  The restaurant week menu was a 3-course pre-fixe menu with a multitude of options.  My friend and I decided on the following: Appetizers:- Jap Chae with beef - this is a classic korean dish with bean thread noodles, flavored with soy sauce and sesame oil and tossed with veggies and your choice of protein.  we got the beef.  It was very tasty and the noodles had right consistency when you chew it.  Not overcooked.  The beef however was a bit tough, I wish they used a different cut of beef.  Overall, it was a tasty dish! - Fried Calamari Salad - The calamari were deep fried and tossed in a gochujang sauce and sat on top of a bed of green.  Very tasty and definitely recommend.  Entree: We decided to use the table top burner and grill some meats.  We were also given banchan (korean side dishes) which included: cucumbers, kimchee, pickled daikon, and roasted potatoes.  Each were all very good! - Duck breast - I have never had duck breast at a korean bbq establishment so this was a new thing for me.  It was nice to have the waiters cook the meats for us.  They even asked medium rare or medium and we chose to try both.  I think I preferred the medium rare.  The meat was tender and not too fatty.  They cook the skin side first to render the fat and crisp the skin....yum!!!  - Kalbi (Galbi) - This was the highlight of the meal! The meat was so tender and delicious, but really, the same you can get at any korean BBQ place.  Dessert: ODdly enough, we were not allowed to choose our dessert and it just came out.  It was a piece (yes piece not scoop) of green tea ice cream and a chocolate mousse.  It was okay, nothing special. Service:  Great once the food came out, everyone was very attentive at cooking the meats and made sure nothing overcooked.  Getting their attention in the beginning was a bit of a chore, but I think they were just pretty busy at that hour.  We had ordered a seafood pancake that never arrived and later the waiter admitted he forgot about it.  Oh well....next time.

4.0,7/20/2018,"I came the other night for a work outing. It's on a high floor in an office building, so you enter through the main building entrance where a restaurant hostess greets you and Anita you through the turnstiles. When you get to the top, the elevator doors open directly to the restaurant. It's only after you get past the second hostess that you begin to see the beautiful views the place has to offer. The place is dark, modern, almost cavernous due to is high ceilings. This isn't your typical Korean BBQ decor. Thankfully, everyone spoke English - again atypical for Koreatown restaurants. We all settled in and ordered drinks. We ordered a ""sampler"" of BBQ beef, some scallion pancakes, a fish dish, and a grilled vegetables plate (which was cooked in the kitchen). A few disappointments - not a lot of banchan (side dishes), the rice was was very dense, the pancake was kind of flavorless, and the grill wasn't a real charcoal grill. But those were minor. The food was good and generally plentiful. They refilled our banchan quickly when asked. The meat was cooked for us by our waitress. They provided both sesame oil and the ssamjang dipping sauces, chopped marinated scallion salad, as well as a variety of fresh leafy greens to wrap your meat. All very decent. Surprisingly, one hallmark of Korean BBQ is the lingering smell and the absence of a vent hood overhead made me a bit worried. But the grills have an effective side venting system that left us odor free at the end. Wasn't paying too much attention to prices since it was a work thing, but it definitely seemed to lean to the high side. But Korean BBQ is usually expensive to start with. And plus you're getting an amazing view of sunset if you time it right. Definitely not the best KBBQ but works as a special event kind of place.",1,0,0,Dan K.,"Albertson, NY",7,136,403

We started with the Mung Bean Jun (pork & kimchi pancake) which was a hard piece of dough and beef that was too salty and tough to chew. The Japchae with seafood was also a disappointment with soggy noodles and very little seafood. Next up was the Seng Galbi which is their pricey prime beef short rib and it was barely edible given that it was extremely tough to chew due to all of the connective tissue. The bibimbap was also very mediocre. This normally flavorful dish was bland and mushy. The side dishes that accompany the meal were also bad with soggy cucumbers and kimchi made with old cabbage. The only decent item we had was the Bulgogi. You pay a premium here for Korean food due to the ambiance and views, but the added price isn't acceptable when the food quality is so terrible. We complained to our server who seemed sympathetic, but all she could do was offer us two complimentary desserts. Hardly a satisfactory response to one of the worst meals I've had in NYC in a long time. There are way better Korean restaurants elsewhere in K-town for considerably less $$$.",0,0,0,Dylan L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0
5.0,5/18/2018,"Very charming restaurant, serving Korean and what I'd call  ""Korean fusion"" food. They have the typical dishes served in a hot bowl, but that's not what you want when you spend that much in a business casual setting. So, my friends and I had dinner and we went for some less common dishes. We were all pleased. In short:- Setting/Venue: 5. The views on midtown are exquisite, the jazzy atmosphere is very pleasant;- Service: 5. No faux-pas. Food served in a reasonable time, and servers were very polite and kind;- Food: 5. We had appetizers and different entrees, to try various dishes.

Firstly, the restaurant has stunning views. Floor to ceiling windows with unparalleled views of Midtown Manhattan including the Empire State Building. When I think of Korean BBQ, I don't think of fancy or upscale, but this restaurant ambiance managed to do it all! Modern and dimly lit it was the perfect choice. Second, the food was great.

5.0,4/25/2018,"This was my first experience.  Exceptional service, attention to every detail- from the moment we arrived throughout the meal and even as we took our leave.  The food was different- I've apparently never enjoyed Korean cuisine.  This won't be my last time- it was elegantly presented and everything we order was flavorful.  The side dishes were entertaining - that's the best one word Incan use to describe them!  I made my partner promise to make a reservation in advance so we can sit by the window next time but truly the views were spectacular from any location.  My dining companion is deaf in one hear with some minor loss in the other.  It is always a challenge to dine in a popular restaurant but this was not an issue here.  The tables are arranged in what seems to be a good setup for conversation.  I'd avoid the center section if hearing is  an issue.  That seemed noisier to me.   And I'll research the menu ahead of time so I can be sure to try as many new dishes as possible.",0,0,0,Melissa S.,"New York, NY",1,37,38
5.0,4/24/2018,"Those movie or cartoon scenes taking place in an ultra modern dimly lit restaurant high-rise, jazz music playing softly in the background, looking over the city scape. This is that place in real life. Few establishments deserve 5 stars. Gaonnuri deserves them with pure confidence.Do not come for cheap BBQ. Do not come spare of the moment. Come with a close friend that has both good conversation and a refined palate, willing to wax poetically over the stunning New York skyline. The maniacally tender Kalbi grilled to the precise second table side is simply one of a kind. The training of the staff is an equal balance of warm and professional.End with a refined twist on baked Alaska that is both visually pleasing and decadently memorable.",0,0,0,Christopher D.,"San Francisco, CA",22,480,52
5.0,4/23/2018,"The low rating here kind of gave me pause but after having dinner here, I fully recommend. It's definitely not the typical Korean restaurant. I admit, I was previously very skeptical of upclass Korean dining. Korean food is generally very casual and not expensive. Plus, attempts to do fusion generally turn out unsatisfying for either taste.Gaonnuri does a really excellent job of fusing Korean cuisine with American dining. It's upscale and classy without being stuffy or snobby. Food is very good! The Korean flavors and preparation are authentic, yet the presentation is very nice (usually not so with typical Korean food).I shared the Spicy Monkfish Jjim and Doenjang Jjigae. Doenjang jjigae is pretty basic, so it was good, but not anything amazing, which is fine. The Monkfish Jjim was impressive though, very tasty and nicely presented. Maybe the name is weird because people may feel opposed to eating a religious fish.... (ha ha ha.) But I highly recommend! Monkfish is really good because it is very soft with a meaty texture, and a mild taste.The staff are very attentive and the whole experience is nicer than what you usually expect for the price level. The ambience (classy and intimate, but relaxed) and view are also excellent. The experience is somewhere between fine dining and a regular non-chain restaurant, yet the prices are more in line with your typical NYC Italian restaurant.Portions are on the smaller size, so be aware if you are a big eater!You will love this restaurant if:- You love Korean food, but are intimidated by typical Korean restaurants and are willing to spend a bit more for a more refined experience- You prefer an Americanized dining experience, but want tasty, authentic Korean food- You are adventurous with food and want to go to a unique place for a special occasion",1,0,0,Mark O.,"Glen Head, NY",178,13,0
4.0,4/11/2018,"Just a stone's throw away from k-town proper, on the 39th floor of an unassuming office building is this upscale Korean restaurant. The food is great and the service top notch, but the best part about Gaonnuri is the sweeping city view from the spacious dining room.We came here for winter 2018 restaurant week, and they did a really good job of showcasing their best aspects. Though we had a reservation, we had a bit of a wait till they were ready. But once led inside we were happy we got a table with a beautiful view, as requested. Food here was good, and the flavor profile I would say was elegant and refined but not as packed with the sort of punch that you might find in other Korean spots. That being said, the ingredients were all super fresh and tasty! To start off we had the scallion pancake and glass noodles, both with packed with seafood and both delicious! For the mains we did the table bbq - we went with the pork (juicy and tasty) and the marinated galbi (totally worth the slight upcharge!). We really appreciated that our server grilled the meat for us, which he did to perfection since we never seem to get it right when we do it ourselves. Dessert was just one option but was surprisingly good as well.Refined, elegant and impressive - Gaonnuri is definitely one of those special occasion spots worth trying in the city.",2,1,0,Melville G.,"New York, NY",124,361,697

5.0,4/8/2018,Not sure why this place doesn't have more stars. I wonder if it's because of so many non-Korean people's taste buds that don't really know the true taste of authentic Korean food. This is the best classy Korean food/ restaurant in Manhattan. The kimchi tastes fresh but thoroughly fermented with enough ginger just how Koreans usually eat it... and the portion sizes are perfect. Just enough to get you full but not American-style stuffed.

He later asked my family member, a 72 year old lady, to take her fashion hat off. So please, don't wear hats. The service seems very slow. It took 20 min. for them to take our orders. The table was small for 4 person BBQ. A few Korean before meal dishes were served: potatoes, Kimchi, sweet/sour cabbages and broccoli. My family liked the beef, shrimp and ribs BBQ. My dish Bibimbap ($26) was just soso, and I only ate a few bites. Red wine was $14 each.The view is impressive. You will see a little bit of everything: Hudson River, sun set, streets, buildings with lights, and very close shot of the Empire State Building.

4.0,3/12/2018,"I have a soft spot for fancy Korean/Asian food. I feel like its so rare to see this type of cuisine incorporated into ""fine dining,"" let alone an entire restaurant dedicated to it. Asian foods can often be shoehorned into ""cheap"" or ""street food"" categories, so I was very pleasantly surprised to discover Gaonnuri when I was getting dinner with a friend and her family.The place itself is classy and upscale. You take an elevator up to the penthouse floor, where you are greeted by a stunning panoramic view of the city through floor-to-ceiling windows. We ended up getting the dinner tasting menu, which was a novelty for me. For just over $100 per person, I would say the price is slightly steep for what you get. The food is all great though, and features many traditional Korean dishes that have been given a modern, luxurious twist. Highlights included the kalbi and this really creamy, rich juk. The dessert was a sorbet served over sweet pear and a pastry. It had a gold flake on it. I don't think I've ever eaten gold before. Tasted great.I think that if you are looking for great Korean food at good value, Gaonnuri isn't quite the place to go. You can certainly get a ton of bang for your buck at other restaurants in Ktown, like Jongro or Pocha.

2.0,2/25/2018,"Gaonnuri is at the beginning of Ktown, but really the visit is for their Empire State building views. When you enter the lobby of an office building, you are escorted via elevator up to the 39th floor where you are greeted in a waiting area prior to seating. We were a group of four who made reservations so seating did not take long at all. A little bummed out that we weren't seated right by the window, but the restaurant is huge in size with high ceilings so you really don't smell the BBQ that is cooking up at the table next to you. As for the food - The flavors aren't exactly what I would call traditional so the visit was a little bit of a disappointment. We ordered: Yukhoe which is probably my most memorable dish there. The rest were a little bit of a disappointment: Pa Jun, Bossam, Salmon Gui, Galbi Jjim.

3.0,2/24/2018,"The selling point at Gaonnuri is definitely the view of Empire State Building and its surrounding building. Even though the restaurant has BBQ, I did not realize until checking the menu because I was not overwhelm by the smell of smoke upon entering. Great ventilation. Hence, Gaonnuri is a great place to bring a first date or business partner. However, food was not spectacular. Very typical. Actually, I can find a more reasonable price and even tastier vegetarian hot stone bibimbap elsewhere. The kimchi, however, was very well fermented. Being someone who makes kimchi at home, I approve the kimchi here. Too bad, Gaonnuri doesn't spoil us with Banchan which most korean restaurant do very well. Servers can have a bit more energy.. feels like they do not want to work at all. Do get the dessert! I love the Deconstructed Soo Jeong Kwa-- the choice of poached pear as a base for the crumbles, whole milk icecream, and fruit sorbet was a delightful sweet yet refreshing ending to a satisfied but not filling meal.",4,0,0,Xuenie Z.,"Flushing, NY",360,96,343

For the Korean bbq we had chicken and beef with small sides of potatoes and veggies. The chicken and beef were very well cooked. The chicken was not dry and was in a delicious sauce and the beef was very soft. The bibimbap was very different than the ones I have tried before. The rice was not as sticky and they did not have as many veggies but It was good. The fish melts in your mouth. Probably my favorite dish of the night! From the cocktails we all loved the pompom.

2.0,2/23/2018,"I'm all about tradition. This would explain why I've continued to meet the same longtime friend for Restaurant Week.  Even after the three-course dinner price creeped up significantly.  Even after I realized I didn't give a sh*t about that last dessert course.  Even after I realized that aside from a few RW exceptions, like Lure and Pig & Khao, I could probably spend the same amount of $$$ or less, and enjoy a 'regular meal' more.  So yeah... My friend really wanted to try this place and experience the much-hyped view. And who was I to say no?  'Cause like I said, I'm all about tradition.Anyway, without further adieu:Bar (since we were told the Lounge was closed) :  Admittedly, my online source was dubious and probably outdated, but I'd been under the impression they had a Happy Hour here featuring a daily drink special and wine for $8.  As it turns out, their HH wine is $10, and they have no other specials.  I could deal with this, but the $10 white wine they were offering was Moscato. WTF?  ""Nobody is going to order Moscato,"" observed my ever-astute friend.  ""It's way too sweet!""  Word.  We wound up getting regular priced wine and the Pinot Gris I went with tasted like it had been open awhile.  A long while.  With a chatty, personable bartender, I probably would have asked for a replacement...  But not this guy.  He clearly hated his job, or his life, or both.  Grumpiest bartender ever.Starters:  Fried Calamari Salad and Fried Eggplant filled with Shrimp were both fine.  Totally fine.  But nothing more than that.  Not remotely worth the $$$, either on an RW menu or otherwise.'Table BBQ' Chicken Breast and 'Table BBQ' Galbi, aka Marinated Prime Beef Short Rib:  As I pretty much anticipated, the Chicken was boring with a capital 'B,' but we weren't in the mood for Pork...  As for the Galbi, my friend noted, ""It has this weird texture, like biting into pure fat.""  She wasn't wrong.  Definitely not worth the extra $6 supplement that we paid for the privilege.Dessert:  This consisted of a Chocolate Financier with Ice Cream.  Ho f**king hum. The Financier was too dense and a little dry.  I think the Ice Cream was Vanilla.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was.A Word about Service: Ornery bartender excepted, all the other staff we encountered was great, including the hostess and our server.  A Word about the View:  Even on a rainy, gloomy day, the view was still pretty impressive.  Alas, we weren't savvy enough to request a table by a window beforehand, so I think we really lost out on the full experience.  Don't make that same mistake. Bottom Line:  Am nearly certain everything we tried was representative of the regular menu, and it was all just so darn mediocre.  At a lower price point, this would be barely 3 stars, but not for what they're charging.  Awhile back, I enjoyed a really lovely Korean BBQ experience with the same friend at nearby Jongro. Screw the view. I suggest you go there instead.",6,3,4,Yael D.,"Brooklyn, NY",133,572,1877

Not only do you get to see a nice view of the city from this 39th street penthouse but the food is actually quite good. My boyfriend and I went to Gaonnuri for restaurant week. For $42 we got appetizer, main course and dessert. He got beef japchae and I got mushroom japchae. It tastes like day and night difference. What stood out about the mushroom japchae is that it was cooked with truffle oil. The beef japchae is great too, but I much prefer the mushroom japchae. I could eat ten of these!As for the main course we got pork belly and bulgogi. The pork belly was semi crispy and juicy. Love it! The bulgogi was thinly sliced and was nicely marinated. The waiter cooked them on the grill on the center of our table. The dishes came with white rice and banchan (kimchi, potato, sour veggies). Dessert is chef's selection.

As you enter onto the floor, you're immediately greeted by the sexy bar which will set the tone for the evening. To your right, you'll find the hostess who'm will greet you and show you to your table. Tip: Book a table near the window! Any seat will do but I'd suggest a window seat. Hubby and I gazed over the NY skyline as the sun set. IT WAS PERFECT!Ok! Enough talk about the ambiance. The Food - We were lucky enough to confirm a reservation on the last day of Restaurant Week. We love us some Korean BBQ and this was the ultimate treat! We ordered from the prefix menu of course (this place is otherwise HELLA pricey). Here's what we devoured:Appetizer - I got the scallion pancake with Calamari, Clams and Shrimp. It was great but not that flavorful. I think I thoroughly enjoyed that it was fried and not so much the actual dish. Hubby got the Pork Belly, Octopus and Oyster Kimchi. He said it was Finger Lick-in Good!Entree - Obvi, we came to BBQ it up so we got the Prime Rib, Organic Chicken Breast and the Prime Beef Short Rib. Everything was perfectly seasoned and delicious. Side Note: They cook the food for you which I can understand since it's a fine establishment but it really took the fun out of doing it yourself. Our server was very kind and cooked the food better than we would have but I didn't feel comfortable talking while someone was cooking right over us.. Dessert - We had a beautifully plated brownie muffin thingy with raspberries and vanilla ice cream. IT WAS DIVINE! Wine - We bought a bottle of SOJU cause we're fancy as FU@K and also because we ordered from the discounted menu while everyone else balled with no budget. All in all, We had a really great time. Everything was perfect! Would I come back? Maybe during next years RW so I can save some coins.

4.0,2/8/2018,"I'm surprised to see the lukewarm reviews, but I guess there is a lot more pomp and circumstances here than needed.  It's 1250 Broadway in a corporate office building, then you need to ask a host (at podium) to let you up to the 39th floor. Yes, the views are nice (if you get a window seat, that is) as you get 3 wall views. But you need to request such a seat in advance. I dined here with four friends for restaurant week. The menu was pretty good actually - lots of options and decent portions. I think most of the items were representative of their actual menu, too.  Service was a bit slow, but not rushed if you're looking to take your time. Restaurant was moderately busy. Seems like a nice place for a moody group date, like a double date. I feel the restaurant overall skews more groups versus 1-1.  I had: -a glass of barolo. Which was full bodied and yummy. Think they are known for their cocktails though, of which didn't interest me. Price ranges $12-15. - first course was a calamari salad, fried and tossed in a mild, sweet sauce. Pretty good. WIth dressed frisee. -second course was the marinated kalbi (beef) which was intensely flavorful and plentiful but a LOT of fatty ish meat? Marinade wasn't sweet which was good. I guess it was prime rib so fatty...-third course was the same for all; a yummy and thankfully small raspberry/chocolate financier with raspberry ice cream and chocolate sauce. Was pretty artful looking.  Out of principle, I think it's kind of bad they don't allow you to choose options for dessert but oh well I guess. Dinner came with a helping of Korean white rice, and tons of the little appetizers- pickles, kimchi, potato (random it wasn't even hot), and daikon. Others had - -the bulgogi with house sauce - one friend with the yum looking scallion pancake, the other with mushroom jap chae (glass noodles)-the cod, which was my runner up. I did try this, it was very buttery and well done -with pork belly/kimchi and mustard greens (lots of pork belly actually!)-the salmon -with mushrooms Most items for RW, including the kalbi I got was a +6 upgrade.  Also, with the BBQ items, you can decide if they will do it tableside for you or in the kitchen. For ease and not making our clothes smell, we opted for the latter which was more efficient.

She directed us to the elevators which took us straight to the 39th Floor. Once there we were greeted by the hostess and waited no more than 5 minutes to be seated. They were able to seat us by a window which was A+. I ordered the Mushroom Bokkeum as an appetizer which was delicious. For my entree I ordered the Vegetarian Bibimbap in the Hot stone bowl. It was also delicious but watch out for the bowl. I learned the hard way lol. My friends ordered the table bbq items which were delicious I was told. It was also a cool experience for everyone to interact with the cooking and share the food. There was only one option for dessert but I was not complaining. It was a delicious chocolate cake with nuts on top and vanilla ice cream on the side. After all the delicious food, I decided to get some green tea which they brought in the cutest tea pot.

5.0,1/22/2018,"Holy moly. I cannot stop raving about Gaonnuri and it's only been a few hours since I left! The hostess in the lobby (at the left hand side of the building) was extremely friendly and directed us to the first two elevators that would take us to the 39th floor. Having made a reservation two days prior, we were seated immediately (side note: try to request a window seat when making a reservation! The view is amazing!) and were offered hot tea. Since it's restaurant week we chose from the set menu provided. For appetizers we chose the mushroom bokkeum, bossam (pork belly with kimchi), and haemul pajun (seafood pancake). The mushroom bokkeum was AMAZING!!! Though the portion was rather small, the mushrooms were oh so fresh and flavorful, juicy and sweet- I could've eaten a bowl of it! The bossam or pork belly was thickly sliced and had the perfect amount of meat and fat packed with flavor. Paired with the kimchi was pure perfection! The seafood pancake had thick batter packed full of seafood and veggies but wasn't as crispy as other places. We ordered the bibimbap with beef tartare, galbi tang, and yuk ge jang as our entrées. The portions were quite large and we ended up having to take our food to go. The beef tartare was extremely fresh and they gave quite a large portion so that you'd have a bite of beef in every bite. The galbi tang had large chunks of tender beef, and the clear broth had so much flavor packed into each spoonful of soup. The yuk ge jang the perfect amount of spice that complimented the beef broth well. The glass noodles soaked in the flavor of the beef and mushrooms which made them so extremely flavorful with the perfect amount of chew but not super soft and soggy. The galbi tang was definitely the show stealer at our table!Dessert was average but helped with our digestion! Vanilla ice cream paired with the mini brownie cake really hit the spot! Perfect amount of sweetness after our (large) savory meal! For $31 each person after tax, there was enough food two meals! I will be back!",4,1,2,Minna C.,"New York, NY",511,200,570

The views are spectacular- that's the unique part of the experience. The menu is really limited as compared to other K-town BBQ restaurants. The food is at least as good as other places, but it would be better with more variety. At this point the service is so bad that you will need to either get up from your table or ask other staffers to find your server multiple times through the meal. Each of my last 3 visits they have also got the order wrong, so make sure you make the server read it back to you. If you do go, make sure you ask for a table by the window.

It was a chance to look pretentiously fancy without the Michelin price tag, I'm not judging -- I was one of them. The prefixe was $70/person which isn't overly expensive but also overly not worth it. There are restaurants literally a few feet away that have cheaper, tastier Korean food/bbq. I mean the waiters are eye candies and the view is great (if you can get a seat near the window anyways) but are these two factors what I came here for? Ok maybe...

4.0,11/20/2017,"I am not a huge fan of Korean BBQ because I feel like I leave the restaurant smelling like the inside of a Weber grill.  However, my friend was in town and this is what she wanted (apparently, Korean BBQ does not exist in Boulder, where she lives).  I figured I'd wear disposable clothes or a poncho or something and make the best of it.  I am happy to report that my preparations turned out to be unnecessary.  (In fact they have a dress code, though its not very strict, and aimed mostly at guys. Basically, don't dress like a 10 year old and you'll be fine.)  This place serves BBQ all right but somehow they have magically eliminated the after-smell concern.  On top of that, you get an incredible, 39th floor, mostly unimpeded view of Manhattan, a beautiful, modern, spacious space, not too loud despite being almost full, and plenty of tasty non-BBQ options for the adventurous.  We had the nicest server (and he had to work hard, with lots of flipping of the meat in the pit in the middle of our table).  I had the fried calamari salad to start, which was absolutely delicious, and so unlike the greasy heap of chewy calamari you typically get.  For our main dish, everyone had the table BBQ - duck, chicken, and bulgogi - and it was perfectly done.  The salad was especially delish.   My friend was forced to put hot sauce on everything, but she is an addict -- the type who puts hot sauce on her Cheerios -- so her taste buds don't really count. The kimchi wasn't that spicy, though, even for me.  It's a great place for a crowd -- we had a corner table for 8 -- and there were lots of big groups.  You will pay more for the all of the benefits mentioned above.  We all got the $55 prix fixe and ended up spending over $100 a person.  It's a perfect place to bring someone from out of town, if you've got the budget for it.",2,1,0,Tamara L.,"Croton-on-Hudson, NY",1,43,36

I know ""Jeon"" means pancake but when I saw pancake in the description I didn't think twice. Instead of apologizing, he just admitted that description is wrong.

The eggplant with shrimp hidden inside with sauce was perfection. The hot stone beef bibimbap was great and accompanied with 5 sides of miso, kimchi, mushrooms, zucchini with shrimp, and bok choy. My companion had seafood hot stone and it included caviar, squid, shrimp, etc. Also excellent. Huge portions even for lunch. The dessert was light and fruity and fabulous sorbet.

5.0,8/8/2017,"Food: 5/5Service: 5/5Decor: 5/5Price: 5/5Overall: 5/5My Koreans is bad and boujeeCookin' up food with some kimchi... I'll be honest, I didn't think Korean food could be bougie, and I definitely didn't think I would enjoy bougie Korean food, but here we are. Located on the 39th floor of the building across the Empire State building, Gaonnuri offers sweeping views of the Hudson and midtown, top notch service, and quality food.Being from out of town, I booked a reservation here for dinner during restaurant week only two days before we came here to eat. As such, we were seated without a window seat... until we asked about the lounge area window seats, which weren't taken. So if you find yourself in a similar situation and don't mind being in the lounge, definitely ask, because the views are well worth it.We ordered the Bulgogi and Chicken breast restaurant week options, with the Fried Calamari salad and Bossam. My friends know that I absolutely detest all manner of seafood with the exception of fish, and yet, I was forced to admit that the fried calamari was superbly fried and sauced. The port and pear dressing makes for a lightly sweet complement to the fiery flavourful calamari. The Bossam plate's kimchi was made with small bits of octopus and oyster, something I've never seen before and also something I normally wouldn't eat.The main courses were cooked perfectly tenderly, and the portions larger than I expected. The side dishes: radishes, potatoes, pickles, and regular kimchi. I was taught by my friend to stack some meat and side dishes on the rice, then wrap and pick it all up with kimchi and eat for a spectrum of flavours. I'm not great with metal chopsticks so it would fall apart, but it was a delicious way of eating nonetheless. Dessert was interesting, though desserts are, as a rule, not my kind of thing.Our server was very attentive and smiley, something I've come not to expect at Asian restaurants in general, so that was a pleasant surprise. The pricing was restaurant week-priced at $42. Factoring in the environment, quality, and service, this price was more than fair. We even had so much food we couldn't finish it all and had to pack.Gaonnuri is an elegant Korean experience combining Western notions of service with super-standard and attentive Korean fare.",2,1,2,Will L.,"Markham, Canada",15,13,21
3.0,8/3/2017,"A decent place if you are looking for average Korean food with an ambience to impress. I would avoid the Korean barbeque option as the meat is rather tough and of sub-par quality for the price. The servers prepare and serve the meat in front of you (as opposed to doing it yourself). We had the combo 1, which came with a number of sides and rice. We also tried the scallion pancake with seafood, cold tofu salad, a bone broth and the spicy pork bibimbop (which wasn't very spicy at all). The pancake and bibimbop were tasty but not noteworthy. The soup was probably the best dish we ordered. You are definitely paying for the great service and the view when you come to Gaonurri.

4.0,7/8/2017,"Gaonnuri is such a beautiful and elegant Korean Barbecue restaurant! It's at the top of an office building, on the 39th floor. The view is absolutely breathtaking, you can feel like you're on top of NYC. If available, you can request a table next to the windows to fully see the view. I have been here twice in the span of a week. I came here with some coworkers and then I made a reservation to celebrate my birthday with family and friends. Both times, we got tables with the center grill. Their plates line up beautifully around the grill and they cook the food right in front of you (think upscale Hibachi without the show). We enjoyed our food both times. Since I was with a big group, I got to try the chicken, shrimp, pork, duck, and steak. All very delicious and when you order from the barbecue, you also get a salad, baby potatoes (so delicious, we ordered extra because it was really good), and wild rice. Keep in mind that the portion are pretty small. The food is light and is not greasy at all so if you are used to bigger portions, this may leave you feeling like you want more food (some members of our party mentioned they weren't quite full).You may wonder why I took off a star. I felt the longer we were there, the less attention we got. Typically, I don't need the waiter/waitress coming up to me often in a restaurant but here, they are cooking the food right in front of you! At some parts, we had to monitor the meat ourselves so that it cooked properly. At a restaurant with a higher price point, I don't want to keep chasing staff to make sure we don't get undercooked or burned food. Overall, I'd come here again!

4.0,6/26/2017,"Ideally, I would give this place a rating between 3 and 4 stars (I'll round up because the view is just wow). I think you can definitely get better Korean food elsewhere in Ktown, and for a more reasonable price too. But people like the ambiance (very classy) and the view (which is absolutely beautiful). So if you wanted awesome, authentic Korean food, don't bother coming here. But if you want to eat ok food and impress someone with the nice ambiance, this place would be perfect for you. If you're like me and you solely came to eat, I gotta warn you that most of the dishes I had were incredibly salty. I went through like 5 glasses of water. But our waitress was very friendly/cool, so she kept coming back to refill my water :)Food:BFBA (Black Forest Baked Alaska)I have a sweet tooth, so I liked this dessert. Not to mention the FIRE.  It may be too sweet for some people though. Black Cod GuiI liked this black cod dish more than the Black Cod Jorim. Although still a bit salty, the fish was cooked perfectly. Black Cod Jorim(Kinda) wayyy too salty for me. Unlike the Black Cod Gui, this cod was soaked in sauce. But the actual fish was cooked nicely and I liked the vegetables that it came with.BossamI'm actually not a big fatty pork fan, so the uber fattiness of the pork kind of scared me. I also wished it was mixed in with the kimchi, because without it it seemed a bit plain.Chicken BreastThe chicken breast was kind of dry for me. But the flavor was nice~Combo 1 BBQGood combination of beef. It's not omg amazing, but still good. The surround the grill with side dishes like lettuce, kimchi, potatoes, pickled vegetables, & sauce. You can get better kbbq somewhere else in ktown. Fried Calamari SaladBoth the calamari and the salad individually were nice and crisp! Nice appetizer~Galbi JjimA bit salty, but still wonderful~ I found it a bit heavy, so I had rice with it. Haemul PajunI wish their pancake had just a little less batter. Otherwise, it was yummy!Ice Cream Trio (Black Sesame, Tahitian Vanilla, Green Tea)Not bad~ it was a nice way to end the meal. They have other flavors so it's not limited to just these three flavors. Don't expect too much though. Mushroom PlatterThis was for the bbq. Nice selection of mushrooms, fresh and good portions. Tofu SaladFresh and crisp! I liked it! Although I wish there was more tofu. Small portion comes with one (pudding shaped/sized) tofu and large portion comes with two. Small :( Yuk Ge JangI liked how the broth was thin, not thick. It says it's spicy, but it's not THAT spicy.

I prefer Gaonuri seasoning of their meat. It is thebest out of Ktown.I recommend dessert.  Why? Why not? Seriously, the coffee is fabulous.

COME AGAIN? She must have completely lost her mind to say that.  She made us pretty upset, especially my wife and my mother-in-law ON Mother's Day.  The quality of service was pretty low with overly priced food.  Our waiter did not even greet nor explain anything about the menu or special.  I had to beg him for the dessert menu.  The hostess and the waiter didn't seem to fit for food ""serving"" business or any ""serving' industries.  We spent about $67 per person and it's absolutely NOT worth it.  Food was slightly better than a deli near my work in midtown (57th and 6th ave.) The view from the restaurant (on the 39th floor in a midtown building) was not so impressive. $67 per person -- there're many other places (Korean restaurants) in Manhattan you can get far better quality service and greater food in my opinion.To the owner of Gaonnuri:   our family was very disappointed and upset with dinning experience  on this past Mother's day.  I've been to many restaurants in NYC including other Korean cuisines in the area but I can't say the food at Gaonnuri was top quality.  I can say you would probably need to pay more attention to your employees who represent you and the restaurant.  The serving quality needs to be improved, especially the hostess.  ""serving"" to me isn't just only bringing food and grilling meat but also understanding, communicating, building a relationship (in such short period of time) and being us.  That's my 2 cents.  Wish you and your restaurant the best.",0,0,0,Jae S.,"Tenafly, NJ",15,1,0

3.0,5/14/2017,"The food was mediocre, but if I factor in how much it costs, it may be more like a 2 or 2.5 (but I feel bad actually giving it a 2).We had a large party (10+) so had to book the private room with a prix fixe menu, which cost $70 + tax and tip.  There was decent selection to choose from (you get 3 appetizers and 2 entrees to share, and a small bibimbap and dessert per person), but the portions were all on the small side.  I was full and didn't walk away hungry, but for $70 per person, it had neither quality nor quantity.For appetizers, we had the japchae, the hemul pajun (seafood pancake), and the bossam.  The japchae was pretty good, the pajun was okay, and the bossam was extremely  tough and dry (it's pretty hard to make pork belly that tough and dry).For entrees, we got the marinated galbi and bulgogi.  The galbi was flavored nicely, but a bit tough and sinewy.  Similarly, the bulgogi was pretty dry.The bibimbap was small and served with the same bulgogi.  The rice was moist and most definitely not dol sot bibimbap.  Ironic that the one item that should've been more dry, they made wet.The dessert was a financier chocolate cake (dry) and a sesame ice cream, which didn't have that strong of a sesame flavor and was more icey like sorbet than creamy.Anyway, the food was okay, but the quality was something that I would've expected from a deli takeout option, and not a fancy establishment.  I suppose the views are nice, but I'd rather go somewhere else for better food.",4,0,0,Yvonne C.,"Manhattan, NY",76,383,987

5.0,4/17/2017,"This was a great pick for a formal ish family dinner. The views are nice, though perhaps less so in the private rooms for parties of 10+. For such a party, the menus are also different- you choose four appetizers and two grilled items (Korean barbeque) beforehand, while the main entrees and dessert are set, differing from day to day. We chose the bossam ( braised pork belly), silken tofu salad, yuk hoe (steak tartare), and mushroom stir fry. The tofu salad had a nice plum vinaigrette, but the texture of the tofu, though soft, was a bit chalky and off-putting. The bossam was juicy and tender but I would have liked a stronger seasoning, though this was offset somewhat by the pickled spicy moo (Korean radish) and kimchi it was served with. The yuk hoe was well seasoned with Korean pear and sesame, and I enjoyed it even though tartare isn't usually my cup of tea. The best appetizer for me was easily the mushroom stir fry. Tender, juicy, and deeply savory, the natural flavor of the mushrooms really shined in the soy garlic sauce. Tofu Salad : 7/10Bossam : 8.5/10Yuk hoe : 8/10Mushrooms : 9.7/10.For our grilled items we got the short rib and jumbo shrimp. The kalbi ( grilled short rib) is usually the jewel of any Korean barbeque meal, and this meal was no exception. It was however, quite atypical and interesting to eat. Usually, kalbi is cut very thinly, marinated with strong flavors, and grilled quickly. The kalbi here is cut rather thick, and the flavors of the marinade are less pronounced. The meat also has more chew, and overall the dish felt like kalbi that took one step towards steak. Whether this is to your liking, I believe, is rather dependent on personal preference. The shrimp were very well browned and flavorful, but I felt they were a touch overcooked and just a but rubbery. As is typical for Korean barbeque, the meat was served with a lettuce scallion salad with a bright sauce, the freshness of which cuts through the richness and adds some very nice acidity. Kalbi : 9.4/10Shrimp : 8.4/10.The main entrees of the night were broiled cod with doenjang ( fermented soybean paste) and bibimbap ( mixed vegetable rice bowl). The broiled cod is delicate and flaky, and the flavor of the doenjang, normally potent or even harsh, resonates faintly though each bite. But do be careful, there are small pin bones here and there. The bibimbap I felt was standard and nondescript, and yet really good. The beef isn't juicy or browned but I think that helps it to blend in better and lend its savory flavor without stealing the spotlight. The veggies and rice all play nicely together. Broiled Cod : 9.3/10Bibimbap : 9/10.The dessert was a chocolate financier cake with black sesame ice cream, served with fresh strawberries, almonds, and chocolate pearls. Both the cake and the ice cream were not very sweet, and I believe this improved the quality of the plate significantly. The flavor of the black sesame is unexpected and unique. The ice cream is on the icy side, which I assume is from the lack of sugar, but I enjoyed the texture and flavor very much. The financier has a dense, tender texture and an understated chocolate flavor. The fruit and chocolate ties everything together quite nicely. Dessert plate : 9.2/10.The restaurant has a nice selection of both wine and dessert wine, but I'm prone to recommend the 'Yuzu Fresh', a non-alchoholic iced cocktail with mint, yuzu, and seltzer. Nothing especially groundbreaking but the citrus and mint flavors go very very well together, and the bubbly drink is sweet but not cloyingly so. .For a party of 10+ with a few bottles of wine, look to expect ~$200/person. (Your wallet will certainly be significantly lighter after dinner).Service is fast and efficient but not especially friendly. .The dress code is semi-formal to formal. .I enjoyed the food and atmosphere very much. If you're just looking to enjoy some Korean barbeque, I'm likely to suggest you hit up one of the many spots in Queens. But for something a bit more elegant and refined (with a price point to match), this is the place to be. .Overall score : 9.3/10.I've included photos of the food and our particular menu. .P.S.

When we first arrived to the restaurant we came across the receptionist Alexa who glanced at us (mind u we were right in front of the podium) and went right back to reading what was in her hand and didn't acknowledge us for a good three minutes. When she decided to give us her attention we asked if we could be seated by a window seat and she told us no because everything had been prebooked and no tables were available. Which was a reasonable response, and I was bummed out but ok about that. While we were waiting for our table she asked a white couple if she could take thier coats, when we were seated we had to ask the busboy to take our coats because Alexa didn't even offer. Ten minutes into us sitting down a white family sat in the booth in front of us and Alexa went to them and asked them if they would like to be moved to a window seat that it would be a few minutes until the table was cleared. I thought ok maybe he's the owners friend or another special circumstance. Another white couple was seated in the same table in front of us and again Alexa came to them and asked them if they would like to be moved they had open tables. When I looked around there were at least two empty tables by the window but I also noticed everyone who was sitting there was white. It was just such a nasty thing to do, it ruined our date night and I cried the whole way home :( I will NEVER come back to this restaurant and I urge everyone to avoid coming to this place unless your happy being treated like a second class citizen. And FYI we were dressed to the T while these other families/couples were dressed in ripped jeans and t-shirts. I'm so disappointed that a business can have practices like this in NYC. What's worse is the next day my husband reported Alexa's behavior to the the manager Nathan and he didn't even try to apologize. He said he ''wasn't sure about the booking situation that night''. What a cop out, we were there and heard word for word what this receptionist was telling the other customers. He told us to come back and he would take care of the table for us.

The view is fantastic and the decor is rich. It's on the 39th floor of an unsuspecting building. The location is very convenient as around quite a few trains. There are also parking lots nearby. The Korean BBQ is yummy and my friends always enjoyed cooking the meals and having fun creating different dishes. The staff is very attentive and definitely help with cooking if you feel like you want them to do it. You can also order meals that are cooked already.

We were recommended Gaonnuri by several people so we knew it had to be good! Firstly the view is worth half of the price, up almost 40 stories with an amazing view of the Empire State Building. Definitely opt for a window seat so you can snap a few shots while waiting for your food! The interior of the restaurant is quite nice as well, very fancy!We ordered about $300 worth of food and drinks between 5 people, and despite the steep price it was totally worth the splurge, everything was very fresh and tasty! The banchan had a lot of variety and even the apps were HUGE. Usually I can finish my entire meal when it comes to Korean, but here I was stuffed with food to spare. I had the beef japchae and bibimbap and both were excellent. Service was very good as well! Our bartenders were very helpful for pre-dinner drinks, as was out waiter and food runners. We had no issues at all service-wise! If you're a Korean food fan try out Gaonnuri! I will definitely be back on my next trip!",2,0,0,Brittany G.,"Raleigh, NC",201,393,487

It's located on the top floor of some building overlooking NYC and the Empire State Building.The menu is very Korean BBQ. You choose what meats you want and boom you cook. I also order some salmon on the side and bim n bop fried rice. I'm just too American so I did not care of all the toppings that came with it. The salmon was super crispy but not very flavorful. The rice was pretty regular, still tasted great! I would recommend getting a meat you love and sticking to that. We got a bunch of meats but just fell in love with the bulgogi.The place itself is gorgeous, very modern and ill lit (but in a sexy way).

5.0,3/20/2017,"Had a really lovely meal here this weekend after it was suggested to me by a coworker as being among the best spots for Korean barbecue in K-town.Ambiance: The space was visually stunning. The views from the top floor of the building it lies in were amazing, with tables lining the windows and a second tier of seating on a raised platform in the dining room that holds the barbecue tables and allows them to see a less obstructed view of the windows. As I wanted a table side barbecue experience I opted for the latter option.Service: Extremely prompt and professional service here. Everyone was friendly, helpful, and polite. I felt as though there was always an abundance of people on the staff who were walking about and able to help with anything a diner wanted/needed.Food/Drink: The food was really excellent. I had the mandoo (steamed) with a variety of red meats inside and a delightful not too sweet not too salty/heavy dumpling sauce that kicked the meal off right. I followed up with the combo #1 of beef (ribeye, galbi, marinated galbi, and bulgogi meat) 4oz of each type of meat (for 2 people, I did not do this by myself). The meat was excellent and watching it grilled in front of me was a very fun experience. The variety of dips and sides that accompanied the meat added to the experience. I particularly liked the bulgogi and the ribeye in a sesame oil based dip and the unmarinated galbi in the sweet/savory sauce/marinade. The kimchi was nice and fresh, I thoroughly enjoyed the lettuce and scallion salad, and the pickled radish had a nice acidity and even a bit of spice to it.I also had the Korean pear margarita which was STRONG but also quite tasty. The straw could've been larger as the bits of Korean pear and fresh ginger often got stuck in the bottom of the straw leading me to sip the drink (certainly not a dealbreaker).Overall a lovely meal in really every capacity. Would definitely go back and I highly recommend to others.",3,0,1,Matthew S.,"Manhattan, NY",161,70,84
4.0,3/19/2017,"I am Korean and I am a fan of this place for a few reasons: 1. Great place to take friends for a posh spin on a K-BBQ night (Korean joints are usually not posh)2. The view from the tables (especially by the windows, there are enough so be sure to ask for one) is amazing and it is not cheesy or cliche as it is with many restaurants inside tall towers. 3. You have a choice of table top BBQ without the crazy scary foil lamp coming down from the ceiling4. They decant your wine for you - even when you order cheap $50 ones, how cute. 5. They have desserts! Koreans don't usually have elaborate chocolate/ice cream!Food: The usual korean apps to share (pa-jun, jap chae, tofu things) are delicious but they are SMALL on portion size. (i rated 1/2 star less because the ""small"" size of apps were just too small and the server not recommending me to get the larger size and 1/2 star less because the pa-jun or the seafood pancake was a tad bit too oily to be an authentic dish, we don't ever make pancakes with that much oil).  This is my 2nd time here and the pa-jun were too oily both times.  This time we were a party of six and ordered 4 apps to share, but be sure to get all large where the menu indicates the size option. For the BBQ, duck breast and marinated beef were both big winners. No lettuce wrap comes with the BBQ though- again, this is not your mom and pop shop korean place so don't expect a table full of ban chan. If you are in for those, just go next door to any other place on the 32nd. Oh, Kimchi is delicious and fresh.Drinks: Cocktails from the bar are decent - the bar itself is run by non-koreans so don't worry, you will get real cocktails. Our Moscow mules were not perfect so had to get them to remake it but the second time it was hella strong so we were all very happy :). As per the Italians at the table, the wine list is also decent and definitely sufficient to accompany the BBQ.Overall, great service, sufficiently authentic food, excellent for guests/non-korean friends who want a different type of night out. Heck, I would even bring my family (Koreans) here when they visit New York.

My husband and I had reservations for Valentine's Day along with one other couple at 10pm. We arrived there about 10:08. When we got to the building, we had to have the security call for the hostess to come down. We waited for 10 minutes. When she finally came down, the first thing she said was ""what time was your reservation? We close at 10 and the kitchen closes 5 minutes after that"". Of course this wasn't the first thing we wanted to hear, but we went upstairs anyway. Once upstairs, we met with another host who VERY LOUDLY says ""you're 20 minutes late. Our kitchen is closing so your service will be rushed"". We all have phones that provide us with the time. I don't need to be told how late I am when I'm paying you $125 per person. Maybe, just maybe you shouldn't be booking reservations for 10pm if your kitchen closes at 10:05. This way, you don't need to provide ""rushed service"".

2.0,2/9/2017,"Only good for pictures and views.Food - Subpar at best Ambiance - Upscale, intimate and definitely very picture worthy.Service - MediocreLocated on the 38th floor, smack right in between the hustle and bustle of K-Town, Gaonnuri would seem like an ideal location for a date. Can be relatively difficult to stumble upon the place, since the signs aren't well advertised. Once you find the glass doors to go through, you'll be greeted by the host who will redirect you to a specific set of elevator doors that will take you straight up to the restaurant. As soon as those elevator doors open, you're instantly greeted by a beautiful wine rack (definitely picture-worthy). You can also request for window seats for a nicer view of Manhattan, but usually there's a bit of a wait for those seats. After seated, we were promptly notified that there was a 2 hour seating, which was fairly reasonable in order for them to maintain their reservations.Haemul Pajun (Scallion Pancakes) - A MUST get for almost all Korean restaurants! One of the better things on the menu. Came out fresh, crispy, and lightly salted.Calamari Salad - Relatively soggy in comparison to the scallion pancake, small portion. Marinated Bulgolgi - Wasn't very marinated, kind of bland taste. Meat itself was relatively fresh, but it seemed like they just slathered the sauce over the meat before bringing it out. Vegetable platter - Basically just steamed vegetables. Banchan was served, to kind of even out their small portion sizes. Overall, if you're more big on ambiance than food, this is a good place.

4.0,1/24/2017,Gaonnuri is a sleek and modern restaurant situated in the penthouse with great views. Though my boyfriend and I didn't get a table next to a window during dinner we still were able to see enough and enjoy the view. We got the BBQ set 1 for two and initially I was worried about the portion size (bf eats a lot and each meat serving was only 4oz). But with an appetizer and a serving of rice each plus the side dishes was more than enough to fill us both. If you are looking for a romantic dinner (views and decent food) I would recommend this place. But if you're looking for a night in K-Town and some food I would say to save your money and go to another BBQ joint just down the block. One is definitely paying for the experience of dining here.My tip for those who want to enjoy the views but don't feel like dishing out all that cash would be to sit in the lounge and have a couple of drinks .

5.0,1/18/2017,"From the hostess in the lobby of this commercial office building, to the hostess on the 39th floor of this chic restaurant, everyone we encountered provided five star service. We took advantage of that Summer's 2015 Restaurant Week menu and I clearly remember my experience as if it were yesterday.  Aside from the attentiveness of the staff, the amazing view on the 39th floor is one of the main aspects here. Scoring reservations for unobstructed premium window seating, provided us with a westerly stellar view of the city complete with the Hudson River peaking through the skyscrapers. Gaonnuri allows you a maximum 2 hour reservation, which in our case, Ruthy and I, we were explicitly told that our reservation would be scheduled for a maximum of 1.5 hours only, okay no problem we'll adhere to your time limits.  But eventually our comfortable dining experience, with premium seating turned into a leisurely 2 hours with no stress from the waitstaff.  One of the features I took note of and admired, were the automated shades adjusting in unison with every lowering drop of the sunset and then rising again instantly in unison once the glare of the sunset subsided, a very chic and modern feature indeed. Banchan is served, as is traditional with Korean cuisine, and in this case to help round out your entire meal as all serving portions are quite small. I will say, in addition to the wonderful view, the best part of my meal, though, yet again small in portion, was the Black Cod Jorim - Braised Black Cod.So, all in all, great company plus wonderful ambience sums up to a wonderful dining experience that I wouldn't mind enjoying again.",35,26,32,Pat F.,"Bronx, NY",337,270,1954

In fact, I feel like from my first time dining here two years back the quality of the meat has decreased significantly. We tried the Taste of Seoul, Korean BBQ for 2, bossam, kimchi jigae and dwaenjang jigae. So the Taste of Seoul is basically a selection of Korean alcohol. I was immediately disappointed how quickly the bartender dropped the alcohol on the table instead of explaining each one. The experience would have been better if she had talked through each alcohol. For an example, where it was curated and which soju they used whether it be chamisul or chum chumrum. You eat with your eyes but you also eat with your ears. The Korean BBQ offers mostly meat that has not be marinated. Which is fine but the quality of the meat was lacking something and in hindsight i believe the quality is sub par when compared to Dons Bogam. While the dwaenjang jigae burst with flavor, the kimchi jigae was a watered down kimchi stew that was unbearable to eat. I'd say overall, the service and food is both mediocre.

If you're able to get a window seat then you'll have a nice city view too. Our server was nice when he was available. Now with the bad.  The moment I'm about to be seated,  I asked the waitress if we can possibly get table by the window. I saw a few empty at the time. She responded ""If you want to have a window table you need to book two weeks in advance. You know? It's Christmas."". That condescending tone was so..... This was how the review went from three to one star. I ordered the assorted premium beef BBQ combo. Our waiter began with asking us if we wanted to cook ourselves or did we want him to help.  Since there's the option I asked if he can.  I'm personally not the best at watching the grill. Two out of the four meat ended up being burnt. If we hadn't start paying attention they would've all been burnt. Taste of the meat that was not burnt was okay. The Gal Bi Tang was a little bland.

The portions were on the small side and we wished they had much more bibimbap, but we forgot all of this after the first couple of Manhattans (they make good and strong drinks).So net-net, this place is a good option for special occasions when you want to rise above the typical Koreatown hustle and bustle. But just know you're paying for something other than the food.",0,1,0,Art C.,"Brooklyn, NY",179,1167,91
3.0,12/20/2016,"Good quality was excellent, especially the barbecue and dessert. The view was phenomenal. However, food overly priced-- for example, for the quality of kimchi stew, I would not spend 12 dollars. It's a basic staple of Korean diet and the quality of that particular soup was not that impressive. Furthermore, for the money I spend, I expected an exceptional service from the waiters-- there was no explanations for the dishes and the waiters were overall very quiet.",0,0,0,Adalia J.,"Worcester, MA",0,2,0
4.0,12/18/2016,"Food was amazing - best Korean BBQ that I have had.  Drinks were great as well.  The view was amazing.  This place is great.  The only downfall is the service.  I can't say it's terrible b/c they were nice and whenever a mistake was made they did apologize.  So I do feel that they care but I question the training that they receive.  When we were seated we were told, ""We want you to know that we are fully booked with reservations and we will need this table for a 7pm reservation"".  I was a bit thrown off b/c I have never been greeted like that at any restaurant.  I thought about it for a moment and it made sense - this is the type of place that people probably sit at for hours and take their time having drinks for hours upon hours b/c the views are just amazing (definitely request a window seat - even if you do not sit by the window you will still get a great view as they have floor to ceiling windows).  So they tell every table that sits down this to make sure people don't over stay, which hurts the restaurant as they try to serve as many as possible.As a business owner I totally get it.  I think where this place messed up is the way they explain this to people when they are sat.  They should probably mention this right after taking the initial drink order and they should also choose different wording b/c they way it sounds is that you will be rushed out the door.  Just like anything in life it's not what you say, it's how you say it.On 2 occasions we had to remind them about a drink we ordered.  After dinner - we were asked if we wanted anything else (which basically implies we hope you don't want dessert).  We were celebrating a birthday so we were obviously going to have dessert).  Just so you have the full picture - we were sat at 5pm and made it to ordering dessert at about 6:20 (which is totally normal).  Then when it came time to requesting the check we were waiting for them to finally come around (go figure lol).So again this place was amazing.  I would go back maybe 1 more time, but if I had that same experience I will probably bring this to the owner/manager's attention b/c again this place had amazing food and a great view.  If they can just get the staff worked on more this place will be a 10 and one of my favorite places to go.Please do check it out as you will enjoy it.  if you feel you are starting to have the same experience as me, just ask to speak to a manager early in your experience that way hopefully they can shift gears and give you a better experience.

Starting with the appetizers, we ordered the seafood japchae, which was tasty but wasn't anything extraordinary, the mushroom bokkeum, which was fresh but lacked flavors, and the seafood scallion pancake, which was my favorite. The pancake was different from the usual - it was crispy and hot and not too oily. It was delicious! Of course, we had BBQ. We only ordered the jumbo shrimp and bulgogi among the three of us, and it was more than enough because we had to save room for their desserts! I usually don't do seafood BBQ, but the shrimp was very fresh and bouncy. Their bulgogi was already marinated, and the meat was super tender and flavorful. Yum!

We had a party of nine so didn't get to fully experience cooking our meats ourselves, but most tables have the stovetop grille. for appetizers:CHO-SUN-TANG - korean-style gazpacho which was tomato-less.

MANDOO - the pork dumplings were nothing specialJAPCHAE- you can't really mess up this simple traditional glass noodle dish. Tasted fine, would get againBOSSAM - pork belly wasn't as tender as it could have been. OCTOPUS BOKKEUM  - good, the best appetizer of the nightKorean BBQ- everything arrived fully cooked.

You get about four different dishes - one was either pumpkin or butternut squash, and the standard kimchee stood outMeats included chicken breast marinated in soy, pork belly, bulgogi, galbi, and the prime ribeye which was the best cut of the night.

Restaurant Week consisted of a 3 course meal for $42.  I ordered the Beef Japache as my appetizer, and my boyfriend ordered the baby octopus salad.  For our main, we ordered the Bulgogi and Chicken and shared so we could get a taste of each.  We BBQd the food at our table, and it was accompanied by an array of side items.  For dessert, we had something called PLCP which was described as: Lemongrass Coconut Panna Cotta, Rum-Lime Poached Pineapple, Coconut Meringue Disc, Passionfruit Kaffir Lime Sorbet.  Very tasty. We also ordered some cocktails - the Ginger Poire and Pear Margarita, both of which were enjoyable.  As far as Restaurant Week goes, I think this is one of the better ones meaning the experience is similar to that of non-Restaurant week, generous portions, good service, etc. Definitely an upscale setting that is enforced, so leave the hawaiian t-shirt, shorts and flip flops at home.Pro Tip: Request a window seat!",0,0,2,Collette S.,"Boston, MA",216,258,169
2.0,8/13/2016,"This place just screams chain restaurant. There are a few reasons why I say that. I'll break them down into sections to organize my thoughts on why this two star restaurant should be your last option of places to eat. Service THEE most important aspect of a restaurant that exceeds moderately priced. Once you venture off into super pricey territory, you're required to have well-trained staff who are highly experienced in customer service. Welp, this place clearly didn't get the memo. Our ""waiter/server"" was everything but his title. He never introduced himself or even took a half of a minute to discuss the menu with us. Actually his first words were, ""did you decide on a drink?"" Talk about rude. Also, he never checked in on the table, took away dishes from the table without asking if we were done first...I mean really I was flabbergasted by the whole ordeal. Service here stinks. FoodSigh. Womp. Tears. I had high hopes for this place, but unfortunately I was completely underwhelmed. Truly (Joanne Prada voice). I will say that the most hysterical and pretty saddening part about the food is that our waiter did get around to actually asking us ONE question about what we wanted/needed and that was whether we wanted white or multigrain rice. We chose white, and yet somehow our waiter felt it was appropriate to bring us COLD multigrain rice simply stating, ""we ran out out of white."" Straight faced, no empathy, no concern, just it is what it is. I mean seriously, come on. We should have been asked if there was anything else we would like or offered something complimentary at the very least. The only thing good here was the japchae- very smoky flavor and the perfect texture. Japchae held it down for 1 star. Ambiance So here it is guys: You're paying lots of cash for the view and that's my final answer. Because the decor is not flattering, the food is lack luster, and the service nonexistent.

Appetizers were phenomenal, I had the mushroom bokkeum (oyster and mushrooms) which was delicious with such a sweet sauce. That was the complete opposite of what my mom got which was the bossam (braised pork belly) which was spicy pork wrapped with a tangy perilla leaves. The pork wasn't dry and the flavor really popped from the leaves and the kimchi. Both had such unique flavor a to it. Highly recommended For main course mom got the classic bolgogi and for me, the duck. The bolgogi is everything you expect from a Korean place, tender moist and packed full of flavor with that tasty sauce. The duck I would not recommend. It was bbq duck but not cooked the way I expected. The meat surprisingly didn't have that distinct duck flavor and the skin was chewy not crispy. Basically if you told me that was chicken or pork id believe you. So if you're a duck fan like me I don't think you'd enjoy it. Maybe order something else to spare from disappointment.The dessert is standard for everyone no choices, but it's excellent. Coconut panna cotta and coconuts meringue disc. YUMM so tangy and fruity.

3.0,7/28/2016,Decent upscale Korean bbq with a great view and banquet rooms for parties. The galbi was decent but not super flavorful although the black cod gui was amazing!  This was probably my favorite dish. The Mandoo was pretty standard as was the bossam. It's fancy and the ambiance is nice but the food was just okay.  The dessert was plated beautifully and the house made ice cream was fantastic.

5.0,7/21/2016,"First off, we came in an hour and a half before our reservation time and they served us immediately, really kindly. This was our first time eating Korean food, and our server Jay was extremely helpful. We are a latino family of three and we tried all of the food she recommended. We had one cold appetizer (the calamari salad - it is a bit spicy but the delicious type of spicy) and a hot appetizer (the Japchae with seafood - which is glass noodles, a shrimp, and seaweed). We also had the table barbecue - I don't eat meat and I tried it and loved it. We ordered the Marinated Galbi which is prime beef short ribs and the Bulgogi which is beef ribeye (my favorite). This was enough for us to share - the meats are grilled in front of you and come with various Korean side dishes. For dessert we had a Baked Alaska and Pear Ice-cream. You really can't go wrong on the desserts. Highly recommend this restaurant!",0,0,0,Gigi S.,"New York, NY",148,5,10
2.0,7/20/2016,"Goannuri is one of the more upscale restaurants in Midtown's Little Korea. From the moment you step out of the elevator and into the sexy interior of the dining area, with broody dark wood paneling and chic decor, the mood is set. There are attractive people lounging by the bar, sipping cocktails and chattering loudly as chilled, Hotel Costas CDs provide the soundtrack. The dining room is large as are the windows with those spectacular panoramic views. Even if you're seated in the inner circle of the restaurant, you still get to enjoy the iconic New York skyline.Needless to say, my fellow eater and I were excited about our first meal here and being connoisseurs of authentic Korean food, we were especially excited to see how this place handled some of our favourite fare. Upon arrival, we were greeted by friendly staff, who placed us by a table closest to the window with northwest views. At night, New York always sparkles and, on this night, she was exceptionally beautiful.We started with cocktails. We ordered the Ginger Poire and the Fiery Julep. Very tasty. Maybe a little too good. This set the standard for the main event. It could only get better... Except it didn't...Korean Dining 101. Your diners should never leave hungry. Koreans love to eat and they love to feed. This starts with the bon chon. We received two sad-looking dishes of bland bon chon: spinach and radish...but no kimchee. We requested some and our server said the restaurant only served it on request. Even then, two side plates of bon chon is unacceptable. The kimchee was timidly flavoured. We let it go and proceeded with our order. While the meal was bland and flavourless (another no-no in Korean cuisine), what was upsetting was the haemul pajun. It was chewy and had very little seafood. At over $20, I was a little taken aback. We didn't finish it. Another notable mention, a plate of bulgogi to grill. At first, I assumed we'd received a small order, but we were assured that the size was correct. My fellow diner and I were aghast. Three puny pieces of meat each. Flavourwise, it was astoundingly bland, not the rich umami taste we were craving. It dawned on us as we grudgingly sipped our drinks that we'd been taken in by the views, cocktails and fancy decor. Goannuri isn't a place for eating, it's more a social hangout where people come for the ambience. Food is secondary to the proceedings. Upon leaving, our very attentive waiter sensed we weren't happy and asked if we had a problem with the service. We didn't. He was good. We tipped him well, but quietly vowed never to set foot in that establishment again. I would happily pay more for authentic Korean flavours and portions. Even buffet-style Woorjip serves better seasoned food. For truly authentic flavours, we'll head to the likes of Sik Gaek in Sunnyside or a slew of home-style cooking establishments in Flushing for exceptional Korean fare. Goannuri is a prime case of all show, no substance... But those breath-taking views... Five stars for that. Four for the cocktails, three and a half for the service. Sadly, one star for the food.",0,0,0,JH J.,"Jackson Heights, NY",0,3,0

No worries, we were able to enjoy a drink in the beautiful lounge area with views over the Empire State Building before we were seated at our table.Our server Jay (Jaeun) were extremely helpful with the menu and explained the various courses along with recommending some great appetizer choices! We had the calamari salad and the mushroom bokkeum and I highly recommend both. The calamari salad has just the right amount of spice and is truly a great first choice as our server mentioned. We had the combo 1 (seng galbi, marinated galbi, bulgogi and ribeye) for our barbecue and ordered and additional order of duck. Just the perfect amount of food for three people. Love the fact that the barbecue is cooked in front of you and it makes the experience more special. A snickers dessert to top of the meal and we walked out of there happy and content with our experience.

Unfortunately, it underwhelmed and overcharged for what you could get on West 32nd Street in Koreatown for equal or better quality. You are paying for the real estate here and if you are lucky enough to get a window seat - we weren't - the 39th floor view is, I'm sure, nice. If you just have a regular table, the food is average, the service competent but stiff, and the overall experience is meh with a hefty price tag. We grilled at the table. The pork belly was tough and not fatty or tasty. The kalbi was fine and the bulgogi was the tastiest option. The bibimbop with mountain vegetables and a bit of seafood on the top, was decent but unworthy of $22.

Who wouldn't want to have dinner while watching the sun set on the NYC skyline?However, the dishes were overpriced and nothing really to write home about. The ginger chicken salad hardly tasted of ginger. My favorite dish was the braised black cod, but it quickly became too salty to eat. Honestly, I didn't mind the food much. Our dinner was as normal as an overpriced dinner could be. It was only when our waiter, while cleaning up the table, spilled a dish full of oil on my boyfriend and failed to apologize. He looked over and said ""Oh"", and continued to clear the table. There was no sincere apology or asking if he was alright. Just ...whatever.An expensive restaurant that has a suggested dress code should employ waiters who are professional and courteous, NOT young kids who don't give a damn.

You can go downstairs and walk into any Korean restaurant on 32nd street, they probably will have better versions of everything compared to here. With that said, their Snickers bar dessert is amazing, they probably have a great pastry chef.The verdict - this place is selling the view, not the food.

It's definitely more on the expensive side, so I go when I'm feeling fancy. They have a sign detailing the dress code by the bar (i.e. no flip flops, baseball caps, etc).The seafood pancake is the crispiest, most delicious pajeon I've had in the city. The pork belly is another favorite--really tender and flavorful. You have the option of using the grill at the table or having the BBQ prepared in the kitchen. They also have a prefixe menu with a decent selection of items, which is great if you're up for trying different things.However, I found that depending on what your stomach slash heart actually desire, it might be more cost-effective to go à la carte.

3.0,3/19/2016,"The other reviews mainly sum it up: great views, premium pricing and well-prepared, good quality food. We were a party of 7 for dinner, and lucked out being seated at a nicely-sized window-side round table (you have the option to book a window table when you reserve, but the amount of time you can stay is then time-limited).Biggest issue for me was the small portion size. Korean food lends itself to sharing, and the generally lilliputian platings made us feel like we should using tweezers to portion out some of the dishes. For example, the yuk-hoe (raw ribeye tartare) arrived in the form of a single small scoop, and the steamed mandoo looked like mini-potstickers. Other starters were slightly more ample, but still small for the price.When we asked about bbq portion size, the waiter indicated they are scaled for one -- which you might not expect, given the prices (galbi $38; ribeye $48; duck breast $34). Yet that's what they indeed appeared to be, and the meat was cut very small, too. They also charge separately for a bowl of lettuce leaves ($8 ""Vegetable Plate"") if you want to roll-up your bbq, and the sauces were served in tiny dishes (we needed to request extra). Banchan were also quite limited, both in size and variety.Desserts are surprisingly elaborate, as they do have a pastry chef.Overall it was a good experience and a step-up from the usual more earthbound Korean bbq places, but we would have enjoyed it more had the portion sizes been more in line with both the pricing and diners' inclination to share this type of food.",0,1,0,J.

Seafood Pajun (large) - pretty good, but nothing specialCold Squid/Octopus salad - TERRIBLE. it was 5 pieces of limp squid (or octo, can't remember) on a bed of ugly white cabbage. That's it. For $18. Marinated Kalbi - delicious but at $40 for 12 bite sized pieces. Duck Breast - delicious as well but at $40 for 9 bite sized pieces. Snickers Bar - best thing we ate all night. Green Tea X1Total pre-tip: $150 They didn't charge me for a bowl of rice, which is nice, but also considering that if it weren't for the bowl of rice, I would be starving...not mildly full but actually starving after this meal. I should also mention here that this place doesn't really do the traditional korean freebie appetizers that usually come plentifully with your meal and thus, making korean food in general a better deal and making you less hungry at the end.  Oh they bring you something here but it's 1. two ping pong ball sized bland kim chi (my mom, who isn't korean, makes better kim chi) that's not flavorful or spicy. 2. a plate of shredded lettuce (yup) 3. a giant plate of scallions (umm ok) 4. three scoops of a paste made from pumpkin and pineapple (this was ok, but WHY?! WHY IS THIS NEEDED? I dont need to cleanse my pallet in korean food, i'm not freaking wine tasting here! I want it spicy and flavorful! I dont want to eat PUMPKIN AND PINEAPPLE PASTE, give me my spicy pickled veggies or spicy raw crab or spicy something.  Not freaking LETTUCE, SCALLIONS and PUMPKIN PASTE.) And yes, these 4 things were at every table. So when you come here, know that:-It's not cheap-There's hardly any banchan-The appetizers are hit or miss-the BBQ is delicious but $40 for 9-12 pieces of meat-the Desserts are the best thing on the menu-For 50% less $$$ you could've ate 50% more food at a normal korean joint in Ktown. Although at a lower altitude. -Don't come here if you're korean, asian, eat spicy, a NYer ...unless it's absolutely for the views.I really wanted this place to be the premium in Korean dining.

1.0,2/19/2016,"This is the first review I have been motivated to write.  I have been to gaonnuri about half a dozen times over the past few years, which astonishes me because each time I'm here, I'm disappointed.  Without a reservation, I walked in at 5:30pm and was greeted by a cold hostess who asked, ""do you have a reservation,"" without the courtesy of a greeting.  I politely said no but wanted to know if they had a table for two.  She never answered my question but said, come back when everyone is here.  My mother, who was visiting from out of town, arrived a few minutes later and thankfully we got a table (in a very empty restaurant). To touch on the food, it is mediocre at best and thus, outrageously priced.  We started with the bossam which was shockingly dry and tasteless, followed by seng galbi and kimchi chigae, classic dishes difficult to ruin but with so much potential to exceed expectation, especially when the kimchi chigae is $20 compared to the $12-14 at every other restaurant on the block.  The stunning view does give you p ause but so does the offensive service.  We had just paid the $185 bill for two and were finishing the last few sips of our wine when the host came over and asked us to leave the table.  He told us in an irritated voice that there were many people waiting for our table.  We had been there approximately 2 hours and 35 minutes.  I eat out at least five nights a week, whether at kappo masa or dining at the bar at priora, and am taken aback by the completely obnoxious service at gaonnuri.  I am Korean American and will never   recommend this restaurant to anyone, particularly non Korean friends as I would not want to impart the wrong impression about either Korean cuisine or the culture's warm hospitality.",0,0,0,Jennifer S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0

The quality is solid, but I've had better bbq from other Korean establishments. They offer banchan but it's not as extended as other places. The servers are attentive, and they'll prepare your food meats how you want.Kalbi. If I could kiss the chef I would. Prepared so damn well!! Omg this is the best kalbi I've had!!!! Usually I look forward to the dessert menu (no matter how full I am, I always have room for dessert) but nothing jumped out from here. :(The view. Okay, let's start. If you can, ask for a table closer to the glass walls. The whole restaurant has a panoramic view of the Manhattan skyline and it's fantastic. The empire state is on one corner, and then there's midtown west/hell's kitchen right next to it, and Jersey city over on the other side...the view more than makes up for any reservations you might have about Gaonnuri.",5,0,0,Saba C.,"JAMAICA, NY",151,53,4

I was also able to try to the salmon dish as well (which in my opinion was much better than the galbi).

Came here for Valentine's Day which was an 8-course tasting for $100 pp. The food itself is standard Korean fare with a nicer presentation and higher price tag compared to the rest of K-town. But you're really paying for the upscale environment and panoramic views of Manhattan. The dinner was really filling and my favorites were the Black Cod, Galbi Jjim, and dessert (loved the strawberry macaron and mascarpone ice cream). Service was slow in the beginning and we waited about 30 minutes for our third course. After that, however, things moved more smoothly. The manager also came to apologize and offered us complimentary beverages, which we appreciated. We were disappointed that we couldn't get a window seat for dinner, but we moved to the window near the waiting area afterwards to finish our drinks and enjoyed the view!Overall we had an enjoyable time and I liked the quiet, classy atmosphere.

After taking the elevator to the 39th floor you walk right into the bar area and have a great view of NYC. We started with a raspberry based saki which was my favorite part of the entire meal! So sweet and tart at the same time. We had the pancake sampler where the beef one was easily the best. The other app was even better than the sampler, the famous glass noodles. My girlfriend knew from her last visit that the noodles are the thing to get. The texture was amazing but so annoying to eat with chopsticks. We ordered a glass of beer and wine with our entrees. We had the combo #2 which came with duck, chicken, shrimp and pork belly along with all the usual sides like kimchi and seaweed salad and all that good Korean stuff. My favorite of the meal was the duck seared perfectly on the grill and the pumpkin butter type side was literally like candy to me!The service was as good as the food. Our server cooked everything in our entree about 10-15 minutes apart which was perfect timing to eat each meat course. The view in this place really completes the meal. Good thing we suggested on the remarks that we wanted a table near the window.

It's beautiful up there and the view is definitely great. We were seated not even for 10 minutes and the waiter comes over and says are you ordering because our kitchen closes in 15 minutes. Are you kidding???? We literally just got the menus.. So we start ordering from the prefixe menu for restaurant week. He then says you can't order from that menu. Of course we all asked why. So he explains the rule is only a max of 6 people can order from that menu. So we said okay no problem because hubby didn't want the prefixe anyway. He said no, the whole table must participate in order to try the prefixe meals. If this information was on the restaurant week page, I don't think we would have come here. It's just one punch after another. Then at the end he brings our check and says we close at 11:30pm, but you can stay here for the 20minutes until then. It was basically hinting it's time to go. The ladies room was disgusting, no toilet paper and there was paper all over the floor inside the stall.  Our friends who made the reservation kept apologizing.

I first went here in the summer with my family before the U2 concert and liked it so much that I suggested to my boyfriend we should go there for our anniversary dinner. We came on a Saturday night we made a reservation and requested a table by the window so we could have a good view of the city. It's an upscale place that's on the fancier side and it has a dress code so beware! We saw someone get turned away because they did not abide by the dress code. The food was delicious! We decided to do the BBQ because when in Rome. We ordered a bottle of the plum sake - yum! Nice and light and sweet. For starters we got an order of the glass noodles. Those were probably one of my favorite things I could eat that stuff all day! We also got the pancake sampler which was also good and interesting. We did the BBQ combo #2 for 2 people. It consisted of pork belly, duck, chicken, and shrimp. The pork belly and duck were both delicious and tasty. The chicken and shrimp were both nothing special but still good. And of course as with any traditional Korean BBQ it came with an assortment of sides which were all yummy and were a good addition to the meal. The reason I would take away half a star is the price. Normally I don't really like to spend that much money (recently out of college). Also I was a little disappointed in the dessert choices which were very limited. I found this odd since they have about 15 different types of coffee. But the service is great, ours was very nice and attentive and I give them props because it must not be an easy job!

For appetizers, I chose the bossam, which is pork belly, kimchi, perilla leaves and spicy radish which you make a wrap with the perilla leaves and put everything inside. it was so0o0o0o yummy. This was my first time trying bossam and it was SO GOOD. I enjoyed this more than the entree meat. My boyfriend chose japchae. It tasted like any other japchae.For entrees, we got the galbi (extra $6) and the bulgogi. The galbi was too thick and chewy for my liking. I'm used to thinner, more lean galbi so it was alright. The flavor was good though. The bulgogi tasted kinda weird and not really bulgogi-y if that makes any sense. They give sides of this pumpkin mash?, radish, kimchi, romaine salad, scallion salad and rice. For dessert, I have no idea what it was but it was GOOD. I know it had two little almond chocolate cakes, a cream cheese-like gelato and some type of fruit.. can't remember but judging by the looks, I thought it was going to eh. BUT IT WAS SO GOOD. I was already so full by the time we got dessert but I finished 98% of it because it was that good. Taking a piece of the almond chocolate cake + the gelato was delicious. I just looked on the menu online and I think this may be a restaurant week special.Overall, the meal was 65% good, that 35% being the main entrees. The appetizer and dessert took the spotlight!

We ordered drinks, seafood pancakes, and mushroom bokkeum, and 3 orders of bulgogi. Everything was tasty but the beef portions were teeny tiny.

We order dessert and they tell us that the regular dessert menu is not available. What! Why? The waiter was very nice and apologetic but it was baffling.

One thing that my hubby and I decided to give it a try to the restaurant is because the view. So, we got there on time, and the host seated us very quickly, and as they promised, they seated us by the window, however, there was a wall in between the two windows. So, our table was kinda in the middle, and we can only see half of the view. But I guess it still okay because technically the table is still by the window. So, my hubby decided it to order from the restaurant week menu, and I was planning to order from the regular menu. But when we placed the order with the waitress, she informed us that the whole table has to participate on the restaurant week menu, otherwise, it's not allowed. I found this is a bit ridiculous, but since my hubby wants to try their restaurant week menu so I decided to follow along, too. So, we ordered two different starters, and ordered the bulgogi (BBQ) 7oz each for entree. The starters were great, and the bulgogi were solid. Their desserts were great and very refreshing! I love them! The bill came out too $115 with tips for 2 persons. I would say this is not a typical Korean BBQ place, it's more like a fancier place to have fancy bbq dinner. If with that price, I can have more meat and drinks in those typical Korean BBQ restaurant in Flushing. But I guess it's the view and the experience that matter.

We all had the prix fixe, which was great since there are a few food allergies in the family. I had the bossam to start and my husband had the japchae. It's definitely Americanized Korean food, and I loved how *clean* and fresh everything tasted!

3.0,12/15/2015,"If you're looking for great Korean food at a reasonable price, Gaonnuri isn't for you. However, if you're looking for decent (but expensive) Korean food but an amazing view of the city, then Gaonnuri is for you. With large groups and drinks, expect to spend around $75 per person.Our group of 6 came in on a Friday with 7:15 reservation. I would definitely recommend making reservations because the place look packed. To get into the restaurant, you have to go into an office-like looking building and then take the elevator up. I'm not sure if they seat you immediately (even with ressos) since I was late (MY BAD) but it seems like they're pretty organized.For food, we decided to just order a bunch of dishes and share everything. That way, we can try a little bit of everything. Plus, that's how most Korean restaurants work anyway - they're family style.Here's what we had:Calamari salad (fried calamari tossed in honey wine go-chu-jang sauce served on a bed of seasonal mixed greens with pear dressing) - this was good but I didn't really taste the pear dressing. Nonetheless, it's a good option for a starter.Yuk-Hoe, or beef tartare (raw Korean-style prime ribeye tartare seasoned with sesame oil & pear and apple sauce) - you can skip this one. It tastes like they bought some beef from a supermarket, chopped it up, then tossed it with sesame oil. It was my first beef tartare experience and it wasn't a very good one, but I'm not going to let that deter me from trying other ones.Haemul Pajun (scallion pancake with calamari and chopped clam, shrimp) - tasted like your average Korean place scallion pancake. Nothing bad, nothing good.Octopus Bokkeum (octopus sautéed in spicy sauce with vegetables) - the sauce tastes very similar to that of the calamari salad but I would recommend this one too. But you can get one or the other - the calamari or the octopus. You don't need both - they taste similar.Spicy Pork Bibimap - really just rice to fill you up.Marinated gabli and bulgogi - tasted good but again, nothing to write home about.Baked Alaska - this was actually my first time trying this dessert. For those of you who don't know what this is (like me at the time), it's ice cream and cake, topped with browned meringue. It was pretty cool because they torch it in front of you. I can't really speak on this because I only had a couple of bites since I'm not a huge fan of sweets. Drinks - are pretty expensive. The cheapest bottle of wine is about $40. A glass of whiskey is about $25.So like I mentioned at the beginning of the review, maybe save Gaonurri for a special occasion, if you're trying to impress a date, or if you just want to have a few drinks to catch the view. But if you're just looking to have good Korean BBQ/food, head to the other various restaurants nearby without bringing the bank.

Upon entering you are in awe as the decor is amazingly studding with bold dark colors, intimate lights, low key music and espectacular views.    We asked the server to recommend us a wine but he kinda seemed rushed. He pointed out at cabernet even though we asked if there was a malbec given thay we were going to order meats. The wine he suggested was very good but he didnt really help to inform us about its characteristics. We ordered food and boy was the food amazing!  The BBq style of cooking was so much fun and was very interesting to try all the flavors. We began with Kobe and short ribs and then added chicken and porkbelly and shrimp. The portions where perfect for sharing and the side dishes were very complimenting. Dessert was just as fantastic, we ordered a variation of gelato and the Kansas Devil Cake which was stunningly presented. The flavors where great and perfectly balanced. Again we had to pull a bussboy or runner for share plates to avoid double dipping. I did notice a manager on the floor who was present and smiling.Overall the venue is very stunning and the food was too. Service was bumpy but this place is a must go to for korean bbq.

1.0,11/27/2015,"I had a pharmaceutical dinner / lecture at this restaurant one evening. The place is located in the heart of Korean Way and I happen to love Korean food. The good news is the restaurant is located on the 39th floor with breathtaking panoramic views of NYC. The problem is when you book a dinner as a pharmaceutical company it is approximately $125 per person and comes as a price fix meal. There was an appetizer dish, soup, salad and entrees all served ""family style"". This means that everyone gets served a ""certain"" amount of food to share and that is all. The portions were small, we were unable to order additional plates and quite honestly the taste and quality were barely okay. We had asked if we could substitute appetizers and entrees because some of us had food allergies and they flat out refused stating this is what was agreed to and that they were ""forbidden"" to make any substitutions. There were MDs that arrived late and they even refused to serve them the previous dishes but ultimately relented when they began to complain loudly. When it came to dessert, they brought out dessert but stated that coffee and tea were not included. I stated that there must have been a miscommunication with whomever agreed to the menu and how could they serve dessert without coffee or tea? I spoke to the manager and he stated that he would be happy to serve coffee or tea but everyone would have to pay...mind you they already received $125 per person and I think at best we consumed $50 of food and drink.

I suggest just ordering the combo 1 meat and rice as a side because the combo includes already a variety of Korean side dishes. Don't order the vegetable plate. We were expecting some nice grilled vegetables but it was just huge lettuce leafs and pieces of cucumbers and raw carrots for 8 dlls. I have to warn you that this place is extremely nice but also really expensive. A big nice dinner for two will cost you about 100 dlls without alcohol but I have to say that it's really worth it!

4.0,10/27/2015,"Before writing a review about Gaonurri, I have to state that I'm in a serious relationship with the Korean food. This stylish Korean eatery offers great view and tabletop BBQ and is pretty pricey. Been there a couple of times and never been disappointed. Last time we were there, we ordered a lot of things and loved each and every dish. For starter we tried mushroom bokkeoum, tofu salad, salmon kimchi roll, from side dishes DOENJANG JJIGAE was awesome, for BBQ we had Bulgagi and marinated galbi and from fish selection we had salmon gui and braised halibut. Their desserts are impressive as well. We tried pear and baked alaska. Boy, the dessert presentation was worth of applaud. Especially the baked Alaska.

Yes, the view was amazing (how could it not be from the 39th floor), but the food was pretty good too. It's fancy-Korean, which I've never had before, but it was delicious and that's what matters. And there was a TON of it. Seriously a lot of food. 1. crispy fried calamari tossed in a sweet n' spicy sticky honey wine go-chu-jang sauce2. super tasty jap chae with beef3. dumplings4. galbi with caramelized onions 5. incredibly buttery broiled black cod in deonjang sauce (this was the group favorite) By now, you're probably wondering how I could possibly eat anything else. I was wondering that too. But somehow, I was able to find room for sticky rice & spicy kimchi stew with pork, tofu & vegetables. It was fun dipping spoonful after spoonful of rice into the tasty, flavorful broth. I didn't have room for dessert, but I did try their Korean pear margarita but it was waaay too sweet.

4.0,10/13/2015,"As someone who loves Korean food but sadly knows very little about the cuisine, this is the perfect spot!I first came across Gaonnuri through the NYRW. The appetizer (bossam) and dessert (warm chocolate cake with strawberry - summer season only) I ordered were simply amazing. While I don't eat dessert on a daily basis, it was the best dessert I have ever had. The bibimbap entree was also good. For $25 (pre-tax and tip), it was a good lunch!I was so fond of my experience that I decided to return. I came back for a late dinner on a weekend evening after 9 PM. I didn't have a reservation so upon arrival, I waited for a few minutes for them to get the table set up and ready. They clearly put a lot of effort into the food and presentation:- Appetizer Platter: ($29 for 2) This includes calamari salad, raw prime beef tartare, bossam, and fish pancake (love the calamari salad and bossam!)- Stir Fried Glass Noodles With Seafood ($10) (not bad but not the most memorable dish)- Pan Seared Salmon With Sea Salt ($24) (salmon so soft and delicious! everything literally melts in your mouth!) - Stir Fried Baby Portobello, King Oyster, Enoki, Pine Mushroom And Pyogo With Pear Garlic Soy Sauce $18 (really good! Portion is a bit smaller but only because it is really yummy and I wanted more)- Side Dishes: corn, kimchee, lettuce (two styles), with radish (well made and nice presentation)- Dessert of Snickers Bar: $14 (at first it was underwhelming, but later on as the flavors blend in, I simply couldn't have enough of it!)If you love Korean food but have little experience with it, wait staff will patiently explain every single dish served. They even recommend the order of the dish to eat first. Not the cheapest dinner in Ktown but the service is consistently friendly and great. The view obviously helps too! It is worth it.If you are a tourist in the city (aka short on time) or are in a rush (e.g. to catch a show afterwards), I would suggest elsewhere. They make sure you enjoy your meal (lunch or dinner) here, not like some other restaurants that are more interested in getting more turnarounds.",9,4,5,Maria G.,"Boston, MA",93,1056,5667
2.0,9/24/2015,"Gaonnuri sits on the 39th floor of a high rise in ktown and the first thing I noticed when I stepped out of the private elevator was the beautiful sweeping views of the city below. The décor was very upscale/classy, a tamed down version of the décor at a Tao, Spice Market or Buddakan. I was here for a large birthday dinner so we were required to order the set menu so I can't comment on whether the a la carte menu is better. I found the food only okay and pricey for what it was, although I guess we were paying for the view too. I will stick to my favorites: Don's Bogam, Jongro and Kristalbelli for Korean BBQ!

I would say the Korean restaurants in Elmhurst, Queens have much better and delicious food than this place.  The thing specific to Korean cuisine is the free delicious side dishes it always comes with, however here that wasn't the case here and I found that strange, so at best it's an average but pricy fusion Korean place I should say and I know I wouldn't be going there again!

I came here expecting excellent service, waiters that would come at a flick of a finger.The waiters were very unresponsive. My father had to wait and wave his hand toward the attendants which dispels the pleasantry of a special family dinner. They looked professional and young but they seemed skittish in my opinion. I guess college degrees don't teach you people skills.Besides that, the food is very delicious and upholds to standards of fine dining. I had the Galbi Tang, beef short rib soup with rice. The soup was crisp and refreshing and the beef was lean but hard to pull off the bone.The scenery is absolutely gorgeous as the restaurant is situated on the top floor of a high rise.

The food. Very impressed. you can tell when the kitchen crafts food with care and talent. I am a stranger when it comes to Korean, but from my experiences with it this comes out on top. My personal meal was the Korean short ribs and we had an array of appetizers to try out. The dumplings had the most flavor out of any other dumpling I've had. My  friends had the bimbimbop, spicy pork, golbi(short rib), and we ended up trying the seafood ones. highly recommend if you want great flavors from the east. Next time trying out their table BBQ where you can cook your own meats, pork belly, duck, chicken, prime rib, very interesting. ONE complaint. prime rib tartare, I had high expectations because I get this only on special occasions, it was completely unseasoned.

4.0,8/12/2015,"Gaonnuri is tucked away on the 39th floor of this building that looks more like a business building than a place that houses a restaurant. I had no problem getting a reservation and I must have changed my reservation time and amount of people like 10 times in 2 days time! Considering it was Restaurant Week, they had a good amount of patrons at 7:30PM, but not packed. The 7 of us got seated at a round table by the window. It would've made it better if we weren't facing the pillar. It blocked most of the view. Since there was 6 of us, we got each of the appetizer on the RW menu. For entree, 4 of us got bulgogi, 1 got duck breast, and I decided to go all out by getting the cod fish which has a $5 supplement (I love cod fish!). There's also side you can get with a supplement (like seawood rice), but we asked for plain rice with our entree and that was free. Not sure if the rice was something we had to ask in order to get but the waiter made it seem that way. Either we were really hungry, but the food takes a while to come out. But when the appetizers came, they all looked so appetizing! I really can't pick one particular favorite, but I liked the glass noodle, pancakes, mushroom medley, and the calamari salad. The calamari in the calamari is rather spicy, but if you can take the heat or, like us, you would eat it with other dishes, it's not that bad. I didn't care for the tofu salad. It wasn't that special. My least favorite appetizer dish was the pork belly. The pork belly was dry, tough, and not a lot of flavor. When the entree came, they were accompanied with sides typical to any Korean meal. For side, I loved the mash sweet potato with pineapple. The scallion salad was also surprisingly good and the taste lasted even after I brushed my teeth that night. Maybe it wasn't a good thing, but it tasted good when I was eating it. My mom cleaned up the pickled white radish which I don't care for. There's also a regular chopped salad that's probably over-dressed. And finally, of course, the kimchi. Everyone also got the dishes of meat. My cod fish came cooked and ready to eat. Everyone else got busy cooking their meat. The duck breast was cut rather thick so it took a while for the pieces to cook. The bulgogi, to me, could've had more flavor. I wasn't too crazy about it when I had a taste of it. My cod on the other hand was delightful. I would still prefer miso marinated cod that I have at Japanese restaurants, but this didn't disappoint. The only thing is that there were still 2 pieces of bone in the cod. I'm particular about having bone in my fish, but I can overlook that because of the taste. The dessert was pretty standard -- strawberry ice cream with chocolate financiers. Now, I love the Maison Kayser mini financiers so when I saw two of those on the plate, I was happy to dig right in. The strawberry ice cream was good too and it sat on a bed of crumbled pirouline cookies -- a necessary crunch that was needed. All in all, the food was enjoyable, but you're really here for the view and the upscale looking decor. Since you're right in Koreatown, there are many restaurants that have better food and probably cheaper. But again, the view makes this place. If you can get the corner round table, even better!If you come to Gaonnuri, make sure to go behind the seating area behind the wine casing. That's where you can look out the window and see the Empire State Building upfront and personal. FYI.

For apps we had the Glass Noodles with seafood and the Scallion seafood pancake and for the entree we tried the duck and salmon. The appetizers were my favorite! The glass noodles with seafood was cooked perfectly and had a lot of flavor, so I'll let the fact that there was only one piece of shrimp in the plate slide for now, and the scallion seafood pancake was packed with clams, calamari and shrimp and was very tasty! Here's where my disappointment set in. The entree was subpar. The presentation was very basic and it came with steamed rice that we didn't even touch because it was way too dry. Our meal also came with 2 salads (romaine and scallion) and chopped veggies; they weren't fantastic. The salmon was good, a basic lemon salmon with salad (more salad, right?) but nothing great. It was just ok. And the duck was unseasoned and bland. The entree left much to be desired. The dessert was gelato (we got chocolate and green tea) with delicious almond crumbs and chocolate bits. That made up for the lackluster entree. Now let's talk about this view. It's spectacular! You get the view wherever you're sitting in the restaurant so don't worry.

4.0,7/14/2015,"I found this restaurant to be exceptional. From the 39th Floor, the views of Manhattan are spectacular.  From the moment you enter the building, you are treated like a special guest.  Our waitress was very conscienceous of addressing my dinner partner's gluten allergy concerns and my desire for excellent Korean cuisine in New York City.  I have eaten at wonderful restaurants in South Korea, and Gaonnuri's menu was not far away. The dress code is ""casual chic"", but they are understanding if you are from out of town.",0,0,0,Daniel T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,101,0
2.0,7/14/2015,"To sum it up, Gaonnuri is pretty much the snazziest spot that you can go to in Koreatown. It's located up on the 39th Floor, so while you eat, you have a pretty amazing view of Midtown. That, combined with their modern decor, is probably why this place is so expensive. To be fair, I've given this place 2 tries, both during dinner, and not during one of those Restaurant Week specials. Making a reservation at Gaonnuri doesn't seem to be difficult at all. Both times, I was able to make a reservation at my desired time slot on Opentable without any issue. When you approach the building, there is a lady at the front kiosk waiting to check you in as well as swipe you into the building. Hop on the elevator, and you're whisked to the 39th Floor. Upon entering, you'll see that they put a lot of time and effort into the decor here because it really is pretty nice. If this place wasn't in Koreatown, I wouldn't be able to tell that this was a Korean restaurant. Gaonnuri's bar is right when you exit the elevator, making it too easy to grab a drink while you wait. Once you get seated, you'll take a look at the menu and realize that you're pretty much paying at least 30% more for every dish that you can get at any other Korean restaurant in KTown. The real question whether or not the quality warrants their price point. As far as decent dishes here, their yukgaejang was actually pretty good. The soup had a nice flavor to it, and the beef was cooked to perfection. The kalbi was of decent quality, but for a cheaper price, you can get the same grade of beef at Kang Hodong Baekjjeong. All the other dishes that we ordered, were just not up to par. Paying that much for any dish is fine if you can back it up, but just because you're sitting on the 39th Floor overlooking the city doesn't mean that you should be overpaying for food that you can get next door. Even their soju was overpriced. I mean for something that you can get for $1.99 in an LA H-Mart, Gaonnuri charges $20. Just thinking about that gives me heartburn.Gaonnuri, you have amazing decor and a beautiful view of Manhattan. However, your service is pretty mediocre given your price point, and the dishes really don't elevate itself against the rest of the competition in KTown.",7,1,0,Michael W.,"New York, NY",747,1029,240

4.0,7/6/2015,"If you're familiar with Korean restaurants, don't expect Gaonnuri to be like any of them (at least for me, that wasn't the experience). I'm not going to say much about the decor or the views because that is an overly tired subject within this thread (yes, it's beautiful, yes the views are like, wow). The not overly friendly but efficient service gets the job well done. From hosts to servers to managers, it's very professional and polite.The food is tasty. And that's why I took a star off, because it's just that. The haemul pajeon was alright; not bad, but definitely nothing remarkable. Also, the portion is quite quite small. Alongside that we had the mushrooms. Again, good, but forgettable.The ddolso bibimbab was probably the best savory dish. The Codfish Jiri had clean flavors and large pieces of fish. Don't skip dessert. Korean food doesn't have much of a dessert tradition so they were able to take some liberties with the sweets here. The madelaines come in a warmed clay pot and they are marvelous.Overall, great ambiance, good service, good food.",0,0,0,Cecilia L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0
2.0,6/30/2015,"As others here have said - you are paying for the view.  The whole experience of coming out of the elevator onto the 39th floor is very exciting.  The restaurant is beautiful and the views are great.  We all posed for pictures in the lounge area by the Empire State Building.  This is a place you go when you want to impress people, relax, and talk without all the noise. The food is so so.  There is no banchan except for two little dishes.  I missed that and expected something more ....  But, everything more you pay for...from the rice to the lettuce.Personally, I found the service started great with a friendly waiter who was replaced by a military sergeant woman who was rude.  As soon as the first of the meats was cooked, and before we could eat a bite of it...she asked us three times "" will there be anything else cause if you want anything else after this you will NOT be able to get it"".  I just stared as I had no idea what MORE I would require.So she repeated it. She even gave us the hand!!  (the stop sign).  Then, I was still confused and silent and she said it one more time adding , ""do you understand""?I felt very awkward as I am not a Korean food expert and had NO IDEA what we might need.  Plus, why would they seat us at 8:45 if it was too late and the kitchen was closing?  At these prices they should run to the market for us.  By the end of the second meat we needed more scallions which she brought remarking, ""it was a miracle the kitchen was able to provide you more""...so I felt strange asking for more lettuce and ate the remainder of the meat off my plate.She also made me feel stupid when the meats were finished cooking- I didn't realize I was supposed to just get started picking them off the grill.  I was waiting to be served.  So guidance is needed - feeling reprimanded is not.Additionally, I feel the management should train the wait staff to guide customers more.  Maybe Korean customers understand perfectly but I could have used a little guidance figuring out the best options for us. I loathed the pork belly dish and was guided towards it by the first waiter.  I feel he should have asked us a few questions about our tastes such as do we like big hunks of fat?  Do you like strange leaves you have never seen before that are pickled?.  Do you like gray colored pork?There were no leftovers as the portions are not huge but we left full.",0,1,0,Lisa Y.,"New York, NY",34,77,2
3.0,6/25/2015,"NYC is one of those cities without a kitschy revolving restaurant but this is probably as close as you can get.  Gaonurri is located on the 30-something floor of a corporate building in Ktown, so if you're looking to dine while looking out at lower Manhattan, then this is not a bad spot.  Ironically though, the view is somewhat obstructed by a rental building on 31st that goes up 50+ stories...so if you're just interested in a view, I suggest you try and befriend someone who lives there...I kid, I kid.  But in all seriousness, I do think this is a place you come to for the views more than for the food since you can great great Korean fare at a fraction of the price at floor level on the same street.  We ordered the Gaon platter, which is an appetizer sampler and probably a good choice if you're looking to try some of their highlights without thinking too much about the menu.  Mains were slightly more memorable, and I recommend getting the braised short ribs, but the jap-chae and bibimbap fell pretty flat of expectations.  The freshly baked madeleines was a good dessert choice at the end, however.  Similar to the ones at Dominique Ansel I thought.They can accommodate larger parties on short notice, which is nice, and I can see out of towners enjoying the food here...but in my list there are better Korean places in New York that top Gaonurri.",1,0,0,Angela W.,"Manhattan, NY",223,157,65

And the octopus bokkeum or, I think it also might've been the bean sprouts seriously smelled of wet rags. It was really unpleasant. I couldn't wait for the waiters to take it away from me.

Given that it's located on a high floor with nice views of the city and sunset, it's a great place for a special occasion. Three stars because you're coming here and paying the prices for the view, experience and good service. The food is mediocre because you can get the same dishes at other Korean restaurants in the area with larger portions to share among a group. The service was great from the hostesses to the wait staff. They never hovered but were always around when you needed something and they checked up to make sure you were taken care of. I liked that they described everything that was placed on the table. For a group of four, we ordered a seafood jap chae (which was the large size but so small!), pancake sampler, two bulgogi and two galbi because the portions were small and we were still hungry. However, the meats were very well seasoned and it was definitely good quality meat. The meat comes with rice and you get the option of having the server help you BBQ or you can do it yourself. The pancake sampler came with beef, shrimp, fish and veggies. It's different from the round pancake at other Korean restaurants. The banchan is also different from the usual places. I'm glad they included greens with two types of salads so we can get our veggie fix. Generally, I'm a heavy meat-eater at Korean BBQs! There was also plenty of kimchi and my favorite sliced radish. I believe we got a squash dish too which was good but reminded me of dessert versus an appetizer. It looked like scoops of mango ice cream.The experience is great and it's definitely one you should try at least once in your lifetime.

4.0,5/23/2015,"Gaonurri has possibly the best ambiance of any Korean restaurant in NYC.  Most Korean places are crowded, condensed rooms in midtown with people running around with hot bibimbap.  Gaonurri is an upscale version of a midtown Korean restaurant without too much of an increase in price.  And the best perk of the restaurant is that it is located on the 39th floor of an office building with sweeping views of NYC.  I recommend coming at night when the city's lights become really recognizable.The bibimbap is excellent as is chicken jjim.  However, the vegetarian pancakes are our favorite option.  There is no real breading - it is basically bunch of vegetables fused together with some oil.Gaonurri is an awesome spot with cool views and great Korean food.",0,0,0,Adam G.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",25,134,10

Everything here was just regular Korean food, but without the banchan (ok, maybe like sweet potato and kimchi, but that was it!! WTF!). Lettuce for the meat was $9 per batch with only 10 leaves. I guess they were organic or shipped from Korea?The only cool thing about this place was that as the food is cooking, the fumes get sucked up immediately by the spaces within the grill. So you won't smell at all. Also, the service was supreme. My boyfriend's sister got fumes blowing into her face and once we told the waiter, he immediately spoke into his headset to inform the master of the ac controls.

Every drink I ordered last time I was there was worse than the one prior and the same can be said about my dates - to be fair it's not that the drinks were bad they were just not what we ordered instead they were some strange attempt to be what we ordered. They were drinkable but we started to just order random drinks to see what we would get.

The staff assisted us up to the suite, checked our coats and we chatted in the waiting area. That being said, I think that area could be re-structured since it can get pretty crowded and chaotic quick. That small space is home to the host desk, a bar, coat check, waiting area AND where all the people from the elevators get off. Luckily, that is made up in the giant dining area in back.Our reservations were honored and we were seated promptly in a beautiful spacious booth with the grill in-table. This was my friend's first Korean experience so I was excited to show him the ropes. The Banchan was great - our favorite being (obv) the kimchi and this squash dish. Appetizers:Japchae- Alright. Not much to say really. It was good.Calamari Salad- The better app. The fried calamari tossed with honey and gochujang... perfect balance of sweet and spicy.Dinner:Bulgogi (served with white or brown wild rice)- This was very good. I always enjoy grilling at our table because not only is it a fun thing to do with people, but you can cook your meat to your liking. The beef was very tender and their sauce was great as well.Dessert:I can't recall the name, but I believe it's somewhat of a deconstructed take on a Snickers? Either way, it was delicious. There were definite tones of caramel, sea salt and malt which was such a unique take on a dessert. All in all, I had a nice time at Gaonnuri. The sights are gorgeous and the food is good.

Tried to make a last minute reservation by the window but everything was all booked. Nice lady told us that a table on the elevated space was open, and we could still appreciate the views (and we did, thank you lady). My family and I aren't really familiar with Korean food so we ordered the usual ones like bulgogi and bibimbap and a variety of BBQ. Our servers were excellent, two charming guys who worked like a tag team. One was a smooth, endearingly aloof guy who was super professional. The other one was a comedian, cracking jokes about random stuff and gave excellent meat suggestions. It was an awesome experience and I spoke highly of the place.Second visit: A few months after the first, I took my family again for my younger sister's birthday. Food was still the same as before in terms of quality, but the service was a little lacking. Granted, it was a little busier than the first visit but a restaurant of this caliber should have enough staff to adequately take care of all the tables. A huge plus though was a complimentary dessert with a birthday greeting, which made my sister very happy. Overall, I would willingly pay a higher price here (as opposed to other restaurants in the area) in exchange for good, polished service.

4.0,3/2/2015,"This was my second experience for Restaurant Week and I enjoyed it thoroughly. The combination of good food, cozy atmosphere and great view makes my list of top restaurants to visit for Restaurant Week. It is located on the 39th floor and depending on where you sit you would be able to see the villages. We had Tofu Salad and Bossam for appetizer, Salmon Gui and Duck Breast BBQ for Entree and Chef's choice of ice cream (green tea) and Financier (chocolate cake balls). The tofu tasted fresh and smooth with a good amount of sauce on the salad and seaweed to balance out the authentic taste of tofu. I asked my Salmon to be cooked medium rare and it was flavorful and juicy. The Duck Breast BBQ tasted great and fun to cook. My favorite of all was the surprisingly delightful and tangy paste! You taste a tang of mango in the perfect texture and thickness of the paste. I didn't know what it was made out of and enjoyed eating it while contemplating its ingredients, so I'll leave you to find out when you taste it yourself! The only item I think the restaurant can improve on is the seating and waitress experience.

2.0,2/23/2015,"My boyfriend and I came for Restaurant Week dinner. We had a late reservation at 9PM and waited probably another 15-20 minutes to actually sit.To start, he got the Japchae and I got the Hemul Pajun. Both were very good although I originally requested the Bossam but was told that there was none available for the balance of the evening. For the entree, he got the Kalbi (which was $5 extra) and I got the Duck BBQ. There weren't too many sides that came with our entrees and they were subpar vs. other Korean restaurants. We only got a cold squash mash w/ pineapple (which I thought was too sweet), Kimchee, scallion salad, and radish. The Kalbi was OK - didn't think it was superior to other Korean restaurants in the area and the Duck was admittedly not a great choice since it became tough after being on the grill and the salt/sesame sauce just made it a salty piece of cooked meat. I also got the Kimchi Jiggae on the side which was a little on the salty side without a side of rice.Desert were chocolate madeleines and strawberry ice cream. It was a nice palate cleanser but again, nothing amazing.Service was also a little slow, which we didn't mind since it was our date night. Best thing about the restaurant was definitely the view.

First of all its on the penthouse floor, so you get whisked up to the 39th floor all the while feeling like you're headed to an ultra exclusive club. We had a reservation and were seated immediately at one of the tables that line the perimeter of the room while overlooking the beautiful snowfall over the city below.  Our waitress then promptly took our order which included steamed pork, beef, and tofu dumplings, beef bulgogi, and grilled salmon.  The dumplings were delicate, flavored well, and satisfying. The beef bulgogi comes raw, then you grill it yourself at the table in the center of the table on a barbecue that they turn on.  Our waiter offered to help us grill it, which we took him up on.  It was served with multiple different sides in true Korean style, my favorite of which was a pumpkin-mango paste that was delectable!  The salmon was served with a side of salad with a refined miso dressing.  I had asked for the salmon well done, unfortunately it was only cooked medium-rare.  I mentioned it to our waitress as she was clearing the plates up at the end of the meal, I certainly didn't intend to make a big deal about it.  A few minutes later the manager came over, apologized, and told us they would remove it from our final bill.  I was so impressed with their prompt response and excellent service.  A major winner in my book!A word about the restaurant, the views from the penthouse are amazing.  It is open, airy, with a modern decor.  It is definitely worth trying at least once.  I for one, will definitely be back.",3,0,2,Sevann H.,"Minneapolis, MN",294,642,2206

2.0,1/19/2015,"Come for the views, don't stay for the food!Had a gift card to this place so I figured I'd check it out and ended up going on Christmas Day with my family with somewhat high expectations. We got seated on the inside area of the restaurant even though there were plenty of tables available on the outside with amazing views. I did notice that all the non-Asians were seated on the outside and all the Asians were seated on the inside. I don't know if this was strategic or mere coincidence but being that the restaurant only had about 25-30% occupancy, I don't know why they wouldn't give everyone the best seats in the restaurant. To their defense, I did not ask to be moved to an outside table since I arrived to the reservation late and my party was already situated at the table. Anyways, not a huge deal. Maybe the food would redeem the experience. Unfortunately it did not. We ordered five entrees: 1) Seafood bibimbap in stone bowl, 2) Black Cod, 3) Braised Short Ribs, 4) Two orders of the Prime Ribeye.Unlike a typical Korean restaurant, they don't provide side dishes in advance. Mini versions of side dishes come with every entree that is ordered so everyone receives a big tray with their entree and side dishes. This is fine except that our food took FOREVER to come out. And by forever I mean close to an hour.So onto the food:1) Seafood bibimbap in stone bowl - came out lukewarm at best and with very little seafood. Clearly it was sitting out for a while. Pointless to order stone bowl bibimbap if it's going to come out cold. 2) Black Cod - not bad. nothing mind-blowing or special. but definitely not worth $30. 3) Braised short ribs - this dish too came out extremely lukewarm and borderline cold. and it looked like the saddest dish ever. 4) Prime Ribeye - the meat was actually delicious. I wish they gave more side dishes with it. It didn't even come with rice! But the meat was high quality and the prices were comparable to other korean bbq places. Our initial male waiter was terrible. He clearly hated his job and that hatred extended to the patrons. Thankfully, the female waitress was a lot kinder and had more awareness because she immediately noticed my sad face when I stared at the short ribs. She quickly asked if the dishes were not up to par and when I told her the bibimbap and short ribs seemed cold, she told us without hesitation that they would make the dishes again. She also let us keep our original dishes so we had a ton of food. When the seafood bibimbap came out, it was piping hot and it contained a LOT more seafood including uni. The short ribs came out hot too. When we asked for the check and tried to use our gift card, they told us their computer was down so we had to pay by cash. Obviously that was unacceptable by me since I had already made up my mind that I wasn't going to come back to this place so after some back and forth arguing, they accepted the gift card. If it weren't for that female waitress (she deserves a promotion), I would have given this place one star (only if zero stars was an option). I could see this place being a great date place for people who care more about ambiance, but I don't think the food prices are worth it.

The food was good, though there are other places in ktown that the food is better. However, their deconstructed snickers bar was amazing!!!! We ordered jap chae with beef, marinated galbi and mandoo. Mandoo was delish- perfectly steamed accompanied by a sauce that wasn't overly salty. The galbi was good but wonjos is better. We ordered two orders of galbi and it was a decent portion but still left me somewhat hungry. Slightly disappointed there wasn't a fried rice of any sort. The side dishes weren't that impressive that came with the galbi. Other places have a better and larger spread. This is the most upscale Korean restaurant in nyc. Perfect for special occasions. Far more pricey but then again, you're paying for the amazing view. The restaurant wasn't that crowded and the service was a bit slow considering how empty it was. I told my friend that this was great to eat here once or on special occasions or entertaining people for work, but other than that- stick to a more authentic /casual place in ktown like wonjo or kunjip for good food at a normal price.

4.0,1/7/2015,"The four star rating was given according to Service, Food, and ambiance.Service: After trying to find the restaurant hidden behind a construction site, its like finding a gem. A beautiful building in which someone is in the lobby waiting for you. You let the person know your reservation time or party number and this person kindly swipes you in. Literally feels like some VIP situation. You then take the elevator to the penthouse (39 fl). Upon arriving its a beautiful place with welcoming staffs and a bar. They are very eager to accommodate to your preferences, such as window seating or booth. They even showed me what the tables looked like just in case I wanted to know. Throughout the night, the service was great. They are not as attentive as american restaurants, keep in mind this is a korean restaurant. Therefore the staffs will come around when it is appropriate, careful to not disturb you too much. A common courtesy for most asian restaurants. Overall the service was very good and helpful in making decisions.Food: Appetitizers all looked great and seems expensive, but my appetizers (bosom and Jaeyook Bokeum) came in large portions. It was enough for two persons. Not only was the portion large, it was very delicious.  I eat a lot of Korean food, authentic and market based, I can honestly say they did very well with their appetizers. I also tried their BBQ Duck. The way the bbq meat was cooked is interesting and didn't create a large amount of aroma that usually lingers in the air and onto your clothes. The taste is great and the meat is definitely very well cooked. Food was amazing, which is why I am glad I had the time to enjoy it rather than being bothered by the waitress all the time. But, my complaint and confusion would be the fact that there were no bonchons. Bonchons are typically the common core of korean food, but they do not serve any, and the amount of bbq duck given for the price was not worth it. I can order amazing bbq meat from other korean restaurants and be served with a larger amount.Ambiance: Great food, great service, great view. All around the restaurant you can see the beautiful NYC. Coming here for new years eve was definitely the best choice I have made yet. Window seating and accompanied by my boyfriend, definitely a great way to start the New Year. The restaurant provides an upscale sensation and relaxation. Tables were properly spaced, which makes me feel comfortable and having my own privacy.

2.0,1/7/2015,"SHORT STORY: Views are great, food is good, service is atrocious.LONG STORY: I am pretty mixed about this establishment. On the one hand, the views are incredible and the food - while pricey - tasted good.  What really marred our experience was the service.I went with a large group because what is more fun than Korean BBQ with a large group? And I am getting older so I am like hey, why not splurge a little on a fancier place. Well we did and the splurge was not really worth it. Here's why. FOOD - yes, it was good. Yes, they have lots of options and it is an especially forgiving menu for those that are veg. But the BBQ spread comes with way less sides than I have had at other places. Oh and we ran out of kimchi. I feel like the kimchi should be pretty much bottomless.  PS when I asked for more, she's like ""the kitchen is closing soon."" Ummmm, pretty sure kimchi doesn't require a kitchen or a chef. Whatever.SERVICE - there were some folks at the table that ordered the BBQ and some that ordered regular entrees. Instead of asking us if those that ordered the BBQ wanted to grill it ourselves, the waitress fires the order for the kitchen to cook. We were looking forward to grilling and the proteins that arrived instead were not only cooked but WAY overcooked. So not only did she not ask us, she assumed we wanted it cooked, and further she assumed we wanted it well done.  So were good sports about it were like ok, must be a mistake. We get a manager and instead of being gracious about it he is like ""I don't know what conversation you had with the waitress but we can send out a fresh order so you can grill."" Ummm, there was no conversation. THAT WAS THE PROBLEM. Meanwhile, how about an I'm sorry? I apologize on behalf of the staff? There was no ownership whatsover from management and the waitress played dumb like oh, the other waitress left so I have no idea what happened. Who cares? Apologize and make it right!!Anyway, the bill came and we were only charged for one round of the proteins (they left the cooked proteins on the table and brought a second round of raw proteins for us to grill).  Still, for such an upscale place, you would think they would comp us a beverage, an appetizer, SOMETHING. I like the food and of course the view is nice but it seems that they really aren't ""working for it"" if you know what I mean.Lastly, we were there on a Friday night. Open Table lets you make a 9pm reservation so we are taking our time. 11pm rolls along (it was a long dinner due to their error) and they start hustling us to order dessert because the kitchen is closing and then they tell us the bar is closing. We are all looking at each other like, are we still in Manhattan? OH and THEN, best part, coat check closed, so they brought us all our coats to the table and basically rushed us out. I would say pass on this place. You can get more bang for your buck at a not-so-fancy KBB place. And you may even be treated more kindly!!",1,0,0,Jessica P.,"Manhattan, NY",4,69,147

The views are so amazing that i would recommend that everyone eat here once, its really a nice way to see NYC it was especially beautiful at sunset then into night.We decided to go for their BBQ and were seated at a very spacious table with a grill in the center. We started with the Bossam and Japche. The Bossam was very good, but i wished the pork belly was crispier, i was a little off put by how fatty it seemed. The Japche was pretty standard for Korea town it was good but nothing special. The service was perfect, very attentive.After the appetizer we decided to get a bottle of Soju with dinner and were recommended the Chamisul Fresh which was very crisp tasting. The taste was slightly reminiscent of good vodka. For dinner we ordered the Seng Galbi, Marinated Galbi, Galbi Sal, Deungsim  which is a combination special they have on their menu. Like the Japche the BBQ was very good, but not too much better then the other restaurants in the surrounding area. For dessert we had the BFBA or Black Forest Baked Alaska.

You pay for the view and their rent, not the food so not sure if it'll be worth it if you are looking to enjoy your typical Korean meal that leaves you full and  satisfied instead of hungry afterwards. The view was not that spectacular from our table and I don't think it justifies the price of the food when you get a lot better meal for the price on the same 32nd street at many other Korean restaurants. One of the fish dish we ordered for $32 was a joke! Felt so ripped off. Again, don't expect to come out feeling full unless you are willing to pay two or three times the cost of other restaurants down the street. Also, the restaurant was not even busy with other empty tables by the window but the busboy intruded our sitting space and  started to busily wipe our table before we even got our check. This is an indication of a bad management in my opinion.  Felt like the workers were not enjoying their work, nobody was smiling and because of dim lighting, it felt like you were in a funeral. There was no  life or friendly atmosphere at all.  My friend did mention the food was pricey with small portions but I was curious about the view so just tried it for myself.

It was a Saturday night but it was not crowded at all, which was so nice because my friends and I could converse comfortably. This was my first time ever going to a Korean restaurant, so I was a little skeptical about what to order. I ended up playing it safe and ordering a large Japche (sautéed glass noodles) with beef.

Food was gorgeously presented and portions were just right. We ordered the seafood pancake and basically everything that could be grilled at the table. The Galbi is so good.There was a slight mishap with a fire alarm though. The building was testing its systems and the staff sort of just stood around without really explaining to the customers - they probably didn't really know what to do either. Being New Yorkers, we naturally knew to carry on with our meal. The tourists, however, all looked kinda freaked out.

4.0,11/30/2014,"This is my favorite hidden gem in Korean town. Despite the breath taking views, the main reason I like to come here because they don't use MSG or chicken powders in their cookings. I don't like to splurge and the price $20 for bibimbap or Galbi tang is slightly a little bit higher than average Korean restaurants in k-town. However I can replace white rice to whole grain rice here without extra cost defiantly a plus.Decor-5/5Located at a office building in the 32 Floor. The customers will need to have receptionists' help to swipe in and take the elevator. Come right out from the elevator there is a waiting area, bar area and another reception dest. The dinning area itself is huge, almost all the seatings can view the views. Service-4/5Friendly but not overwhelming. Without reservations it's still easy to get a table. Food -4.2/5Extra points from me because of no MSG. It's an Americanized Korean restaurant, however it doesn't mean it's not good. I love their seafood bibimbap with a little bit uni and tobiko.

It was a bit pricy in comparison to some of the other local restaurants but the view and the quality of the food was worth it. The view from the 39th floor was fantastic. Uninterrupted views of midtown and the Hudson River. The banchan was definitely above average. The ingredients were fresh and there was a nice variety. Ordered the Galbi-- it was a nice cut of meat.

3.0,11/11/2014,"I'm still up in the air when it comes to this place.  When we're talking about Ambience this place is awesome, high ceilings to help with the killer views of Midtown, the Empire State Building, etc but for food... the portions are small, the prices are high, and the taste is just OK.  It's hard to go wrong with Korean BBQ (and it does taste good just not mind blowing) which makes it hard to justify at their price-point.  I can see bringing guests, tourists, etc but not the everyday-KoreanBBQ eating-NYer.Ah!  Another gripe - they 'enforce' a certain type of dress code, and when I see restaurants do that it means they want to keep a classy environment and cater to a certain type of people/events - but you'll find people in jeans and sweatshirts galore!  To me thats a sign of Gaonnuri losing (or giving up) their identity and that social class they were looking to maintain!  If thats the case they should also revisit their pricing structure.At the end of the day I think they need to figure out who their customer base is, establish their identity and stick to it.TL:DR - Ambience great, food ok, better suited for guests and tourists but for a good night out with locals spend your money elsewhere.",3,0,0,Steve C.,"New York, NY",28,50,10

I ordered the cod - no complains, my friends ordered some different traditional beef dishes and judging by their empty plates - they were good as well.

3.0,9/6/2014,"As much as I dislike walking through a busy K-Town, I felt the need to visit Gaonnuri because it's located at the Penthouse level...I wanted to dine with a view.  So I took an opportunity during Restaurant Week to go there for dinner.  Impressive layout and space.  Too bad I didn't score a table for two right by the (floor to ceiling) window.  Most tables around the windows are for 4 people and up.  Luckily, I didn't really miss out on the view because an inner section sits slightly on a higher platform.  We proceeded to order from RSW menu; Braised Pork Belly and Calamari Salad for 1st course.  Calamari Salad was much tastier than the pork bellly.  I would skip pork belly.  For 2nd course, Bulgogi BBQ and Kalbi.  We enjoyed everything.  Both meat dishes were flavorful and tender.  On the side note, majority of Korean restaurants I've been to would serve a bunch of side dishes with their entrees.  Unfortunately, it was really lacking here.  We got 4 side dishes to share from our 2 entrees.  I'm not sure whether it's because we ordered from RSW menu or that's just how they operate here.  Those side dishes are the fun part of eating Korean food (to me).  So I felt a bit disappointed.  There was no option for the 3rd course, but they served us iced cream.  Wasn't impressed with dessert.  3.5 stars from me for now.I like an ambiance of the restaurant.  It's modern, spacious, and tables are laid out out nicely (not too close to one another).  The view is definitely worth the trip.  Food on their regular menu is on a pricey side, but .. hey .. you are paying for the view too.  I might return at some point if I feel like grilling some BBQ at the table.",1,0,0,Kim S.,"Stamford, CT",206,235,454
4.0,9/5/2014,"After reading many reviews about how amazing the views here were, I had to check it out for myself. I also decided I would not be paying for it. Fast forward to a dinner on the company's dime, I very adamantly recommended Gaonnuri. And by the end of dinner, I was that coworker who chooses really awesome restaurants.The place oozes class. You walk into a big office building and to the far left, there's a lone hostess who will direct you upstairs to the 39th floor. There were basically panoramic windows all around, super high ceilings, and pretty tasteful decor. We were a group of 8, so they gave us the corner table, which gave us views to the north and the west.We ordered a few appetizers and several orders of the Korean BBQ meats (our waiter recommended two orders of each so everyone could have a taste).For the starters, we had the octopus, calamari salad, scallion pancake, glass noodles, and the braised pork belly. I loved the octopus (it was cut up into chunks and pretty hefty, so don't expect skimpy calamari); it was also served in this spicy, sweet-ish red sauce. The scallion pancake was thick and not bad. Loved the calamari salad; it was everyone's favorite dish. The glass noodles weren't really noteworthy. And the pork belly was really fatty, but good.For our table BBQ, we did the prime beef short rib and the shrimp. Word of warning for those who are squeamish (or white) - the shrimp is unshelled, head and all. Some of my co-workers were grossed out by that. But the shell is what locks in all the flavor! The shrimp was delicious. They actually offered to cook it in the kitchen for us because they said it would take a long time; probably a safer choice too. The short rib was pretty amazing. It was marinated in their signature sauce, and our waiter grilled it for us to perfection. Just a little charred, but left them on the grill just long enough so it was still amazingly tender. Like melt in your mouth tender.Of course, I can't review a place with as much hype as Gaonnuri without a few complaints. The first was that the building fire inspector tested the fire alarms twice during our dinner, so we were interrupted by loud sirens; luckily, we were able to continue eating and drinking. The second complaint would be the people walking up to the windows where we were eating to take photos. It got really annoying after awhile. And the last complaint was how expensive the desserts were. The cheapest was around $14 and it was barely enough for two people to share.All in all, none of that could prevent me from recommending Gaonnuri. It's a wonderful experience, and it's definitely an impressive place to bring a date, business associates, or just friends.",2,2,1,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",884,3337,12015

2.0,8/29/2014,"This restaurant is located at the top floor (39th) of a larger commercial building just at the corner of Broadway & 32nd; there was construction there at the time I went, so one entry open and you walk over to the hostess and she'll swipe you in to the East side of the lobby.Upstairs, a bar greets you, then another hostess to the right will take your name and seat you; recommend reservations (even if it isn't busy) and there's a dress code clearly stated on the podium.Great views of the city, and the lunch special is a $20 bulgogi plate or $25 galbi, marinated in their ""special sauce"". For another $3-5, you can grill it yourself on the table (that's the only difference on that page of the menu). It comes with a salad (nice touch, light and refreshing), a soup, choice of white or mixed rice (the purple with beans, okay), and banchan. The banchan selection today, oddly enough, didn't include kimchi with nappa, but instead pickled cucumbers (2), fried fish (1), mini anchovies, fried tofu (2), some greens, and something else I've forgotten. The galbi... disappointing. While cooked well and the portion was meaty (about 6-8oz portion total), the flavor I expected was missing..it wasn't strong enough for me, and they lacked the Korean miso paste to dip and put in lettuce leaves.I'll probably still go elsewhere for BBQ, but this place does have a nice feel to it if you wanted to bring someone here for a date, it's quiet (when no construction like at lunchtime), and the price would be a bit more expensive at night (no lunch menu items then).",1,0,0,Hank C.,"Jersey City, NJ",1732,2830,1188

I ordered the Dolsot Bibimbap, which came to me crackling hot and mighty delicious (which it should be with that kind of price). They forgot to put egg in our bibimbap orders though. I'm not sure what possessed us not to make a point of this -- maybe it was the view of NYC from the 39th floor. We then split the snickers bar for dessert.

1.0,7/31/2014,"Although the restaurant has really nice views, the service was AWFUL. We had a party of roughly 10 people for my brother's birthday, and the waiter kept asking us to coordinate with each other so that we only order a few of the same dishes. His reasoning, which he openly communicated to the whole table, was that they couldn't handle the volume of our party (even though we had a reservation!). This is no way to treat customers... especially not a large party that, given we were eating at such a ""nice"" and pricey establishment, will end up with a large check. The waiter continued pushing this discussion for roughly 45 minutes. I don't go to nice restaurants to be forced into getting something I don't want, or to having to pick in bulk, or to get this AWFUL service.

2.0,7/27/2014,"Went here today to eat with 3 other friends. Having high class Korean food at the 39th floor penthouse was enough to entice us into spending hundreds on food.Moving on, we reserved for 4 a week early and asked to be placed next to a window, for that was the best place to eat: by the Manhattan Skyline. They could not guarantee us a window seat , even though we reserved early just for that purpose, which was irritating but did not completely ruin the experience. We were seated around the middle of everything for no reason because it was early evening 6:30 and it was almost empty. Something about the atmosphere just threw me off.Like many high class restaurants, the portions were expected to be small, but this was unbelievable. I payed over a hundred for my meal AND extras, yet I still didn't wasn't satisfied and neither were my friends. The food was just ""meh"" for the price. I can definitely say I did NOT enjoy the duck breast BBQ. The only seasoning it had was salt and it tasted like something from  a $20 all-you-can-eat kbbq at Flushing.Honestly, you're better off spending your money at a kbbq buffet. It's nearly 1/4th of the price, exact same flavor, and you'll be full because it's all-you-can-eat.

2.0,7/22/2014,"My husband and I have been here numerous times (he has also taken clients for dinners), and after tonight's experience, we've decided that we won't be back. Why?1. Inconsiderate service. We were 10 minutes early for our reservation and starving. There was no one ahead of us. But they wouldn't seat us until our reservation time -- even though half the restaurant was empty! It felt like a bureaucracy rather than a restaurant in the service industry.  2. Service is slow every time. Tonight we waited 20 minutes for dessert. Previous times we have waited just as long or longer in between courses.3. Nickel and diming. When you order Korean bbq, the rice, lettuce, sesame leaves, etc should come with the bbq. But at Gaonnuri, they charge you extra for all of that. And the banchan (the free side dishes) are pretty limited.4. Food is hit or miss. My cod dish tonight was cold. We've had tough beef tartare before.

I was definitely observing other patrons and the staff was on point. The food was good, that was never in question. I must say though YOU ARE PAYING FOR AMBIENCE. I think they are trying to change the style of the restaurant, more fine dining, seasonal, tasting menu style. Not a bad idea but when I go for Korean BBQ I don't really look that. I would definitely recommend everyone try this place at least once. The views are incredible if you can get a window seat and the service went from non existent to flawless.

I got the dolsot bibimbap and my husband got the kalbi tang. It wasn't spectacular. We could've walked down the the street to the ""food court"" and gotten everything for half the price and probably tastier. portions were small.

It's nice to go for a date but when you live right by fort lee or walk down K-town, you know you can get so much better food for a lot less. and more banchan too!I probably won't go back again but I was glad I got to eat with that beautiful view.

5.0,7/16/2014,"I came to Gaonnuri with some business associates after a long day of work in the city. I've been a long time advocate of Korean cuisine and was very excited to treat my colleagues to quality Korean BBQ. The penthouse restaurant is perched atop the modernist Woori-Bank building in Midtown, right by Herald Square. You ride the same elevator up that office tenants use, I believe the white collar setting was comforting to colleagues and at the time an appropriate precursor to a business meeting.Diners have many options in this city for Korean cuisine. Go to to K-town for the authentic; grilled meats right (on your clothes) at your table with wide-eyed smiling cartoon pig caricatures, splintered chopsticks and the infamous perm of the  (ajjuma). Come to Gaonnuri to enjoy sophistication, cleanliness and an excellent view. Some may find this setting a bit dry, however; I can not tell you of a cleaner, more professional and English friendly Korean restaurant in the city. Keep in mind, Korean BBQ is an advanced palette cuisine for the typical westerner. The aforementioned qualities and characteristics of Gaonnuri help introduce this unique cuisine in a more gourmet/western fusion manner that is easier for the beginner to digest. I was pleased to see Hite and OB on the drink menu, these are authentic South Korean beers that I hadn't yet found outside of Korea.    Gaonnuri is memorable. You could always opt for a table at any of the numerous landmark spots in the city with a view but you will not find the unique dining experience that Korean BBQ gives in such a luxurious setting.",2,0,2,Justin F.,"Gramercy, Manhattan, NY",3,6,0

We sat for about a good ten minutes before anyone came to ask if we have questions about the menu or if we'd like to order. Strike three. We tried to order the BBQ combo but we were not able to order that at the particular table we were sat at.

Don't expect the food to be something more delicious, it is very average when comparing to other places in K town. This place is worth for its ambiance and the view.

Nice how you don't walk away with that everlasting BBQ smell too.The existing reviews already outlined the pros and cons of Gaonnuri pretty well, so I will just add some pointers:-Go at night. Call in advance to reserve a window seat. See Manhattan 39th floors up around sunset. It's something else.-Expect very average Korean food. Just a cold fact you can get better quality and value at Miss Korea or any of the neighboring joints. Remember, you're here to see and feel. Taste is secondary.-Don't order the combinations. $105/person for a bundle of random items that won't be satisfying. Ordering a la carte will actually fill you up while saving more (we ordered 1 appetizer,  2 meats, 1 stew and it was only only around a hundred total).

Everyone there was dressed very nicely, lots of business men in their suits.The two of us got the $70 kalbi bbq platter to share, which came with 3 kinds of kalbi (one marinated) and 6 pieces of prime rib. My favorite by far was the marinated kalbi, it was very juicy with a slightly sweet flavor. The appetizers were not as varied as other korean bbq restaurants, but were higher in quality. There was butternut squash drizzled with some kind of orange sauce and walnuts/raisins/sunflower seeds, which was AMAZING!!!!! We ate 2 dishes of this. Other appetizers included kimchi (very small portion, but very tasty), lettuce with hot sauce (also tasty), radish strings (delicious), and onions (which neither of us touched, as we don't like onions). Service was excellent, the waiter will come around and cook your meat for you, so there's no need for you to do anything. This is both a pro and con. They are definitely the experts at cooking meat and will turn it every which way to cook it perfectly.

For non-Koreans some of the shenanigans may go unnoticed (such as charging $3 for a bowl of rice). The staff appear to make every effort not to communicate in Korean to Korean customers and I wonder if that's because they feel that Koreans would call them out for the slightly above average food for the 5 star hotel prices.

4.0,2/20/2014,"This is like no other Korean restaurant along the Ktown block. It's also like no other Korean restaurant I've personally experienced. Gaonnuri means 'center of the world', and that's no understatement. It's on all levels pretty fancy and raises the bar on typical Korean dining. There is a dress code, so you'll want to arrive presentable. This is a great venue for a special occasion. Located on the 39th penthouse floor at the corner building of Broadway, it offers stunning panoramic floor to ceiling views of the city below.You'll be impressed by the size of this place. It's a rather well thought out venue with more than ample room and seating throughout, from the bar at front to their massive dining room. Decor is modern, simple yet appealing. We had a reservation set for 7PM on a Tuesday, and it became unexpectedly packed as the night went on. I'll first point out that the service here was much better than expected. Their waiters are very friendly and attentive, hardly pretentious. They'll never try to rush you out. They've proven quite the opposite from many typical Korean establishments. We went with a few orders. For starters, small sized orders of the Oyster Jun (pan fried oyster pancake) and Bossam (braised pork belly with octopus wrapped in kimchi, radish kimchi, and seasoned sesame leaves). For main, while they offer table barbeque, which requires a minimum order of two, we chose one order of marinated galbi to be prepped at back. The appetizers were good, but note that portion sizes are slightly smaller than what you'd normally expect from other Korean restaurants. The Oyster Jun wasn't entirely what I had in mind as it was individual oysters versus being a full pancake. Perhaps a better description was required. Bossam was a nice dish. The kimchi was well made, and I enjoyed the seasoned octopus enveloped within. The pork belly was fatty, tasty, complemented well by the sesame leaves and kimchi. Onto the galbi, it was good, but not great. Perhaps if cooked at the table, it would have been different, but I found the beef a bit dry although seasoned well enough. The set of banchan to complement, seasoned squash, lettuce, and radish, were good, but again, common dishes. Last but not least, we did opt on some dessert, namely the Yuzu Parfait (green tea biscuit, candied black sesame and green tea ice cream). I really liked this dish, sweet but tarty, beautifully presented, and simply a great way to end the night's meal. Aside food, the ambiance is what certainly drove the experience. Considering all, pricing is fair in spite of the smaller portions. The food may seem all too common to some, but the presentation makes it all seem better. For those who seek authentic Korean food but in a setting that raises the bar, all the reason to visit Gaonnuri.",6,2,5,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",721,552,3545

I went there with a private student who was going to return to Korea and I wasn't aware of the dress code but they let me in anyway (I wasn't dressed that shabbily though). They were very kind.  I think they'd like guys to have dress shirts and maybe ties and jackets so they recommend business casual - but for lunch there were guys who were not wearing a jacket or tie (nor was I).  Also I believe you need to make a reservation (we had one).The food was delicious.  My student and I each had a different entree and one appetizer and our total bill (with our 20% tip) was $72 for lunch.  We had mandoo as an appetizer and it was $10.  They gave us four pieces of mandoo, so each one cost $2.50 a piece.  :P I'm used to buying bags of dumplings for $6 (but it was a time to splurge).  I'm glad my student was kind enough to pick up the bill. :P I thought the portions were a bit small but my female student did not finish eating her side dishes - so it's all relative (I'm an eater!).  She felt her kimchi was a bit too salty but I gobbled down my kimchi and hers.If you have zillions of dollars you can eat here regularly and enjoy the view - otherwise this is a nice place for special occasions - the area is huge and you'll have a lot of privacy to chat and the service is very good - they leave you alone to chat but are accessible.",1,0,0,Dan G.,"Flushing, NY",0,7,0

For three people to share, we got seconds on the bulgogi because although it doesn't look that great when raw, it's amazing and on the sweeter side when grilled, which I like. Also, the grills have built-in vents so no smoke billows into your eyes. This helps you appreciate the beautiful window views. I reserved a table with a request for something special for a friend's birthday, and they put us within view of the Empire State (which is nice, considering the other side overlooks NJ and the Hudson). The prices are not bad for the setting, but I feel that the food and decor is more intended for aesthetics and class rather than for bare-bones down-to-earth Korean food.

4.0,1/11/2014,"My mom, sister and I went there for a special holiday lunch.  Despite the price, it was WORTH it.First off, the view is AMAZING.  You're on the 39th floor and you can see all the way to NJ as well as to the freedom tower.   Also, the ceilings are super high - the space feels special and very airy (not stuff and formal despite the fine-dining atmosphere).As for the food, I think the chef was going for ""new"" Korean and some dishes were EXCELLENT while others required re-thinking (ie, concept was good but did not quite come together).  In terms of apps, the bossam was very well executed and very ""clean"" tasting which is hard to do with pork belly.  But it needed some acid - it lacked the classic salted shrimp accompaniment and the kimchi-ed radish strips just didn't do it for me.  The pine mushroom salad was PERFECT - it felt korean in that the mushrooms and other accompaniments like rice were korean, but it felt different in the use of saffron for the rice and pine for the smoky-ness.  It was worth the $20 price tag.As for the mains, again some were hits while others needed a little something extra.  MY black tiger shrimp showcased the product - the shrimp was really good quality and very large and there were 7-8 of them.  However, it didn't taste all that different from what I could make at home - wasn't a special marinade or a special preparation.  It was full shell and simply grilled.  I ate every one of the shrimp and sucked on the shrimp heads, but I wouldn't order it again.As for the hit, the duck breast was yummy.  It had that hint of gamey-like duck flavor whilst being mild and tender enough to be chicken-like.  My only complaint was that it should have been served with something more acidic instead of that green-onion side dish... i wish i had the piackled ""moo"" aka radish from the classic korean whole-fried chicken places.  Another big miss was the black cod - it was a poor imitation of the nobu version.  It lacked flavor and it felt dry.  Again, I would not order it again.Overall, I think it's worth the money to go here esp for special occasions.  It's not your everyday korean food and it's different from the other koreaway restaurants.",2,1,0,Michael P.,"Larchmont, Los Angeles, CA",67,155,1276

I have a special allergy called fructose intolerance and the waiter was very attentive and careful about what we ordered and asked the chef numerous times how much honey or pear was in a dish. We ended up ordering the seng galbi (unmarinated short rib) which was amazing and tasting like butter. We also ordered the black cod jorim (our waiter warned us this had a lot of corn syrup but we ordered it anyway). The cod was equally delicious and no complaints about either dish. Service was impeccable and our waiter was very attentive.The only annoying part of this whole experience was that the host got our reservation time wrong. We asked for 5pm and she booked us for 530pm, not a big deal but kind of a deal that night since we needed to catch a show at a certain time. In the end I called the restaurant back immediately and told them they got our reservation time wrong and it was easily fixed.I've noticed a lot of yelpers complaining about the food being expensive and the portions being small etc in comparison but i think the portions were good maybe huge.

I read a few reviews about the bad service, but my experience wasn't too bad. In fact, the waitstaff was actually quite lovely. Most seemed to speak English pretty well (we're Korean so that wasn't really an issue), and there was also a Caucasian waiter working if you're worried about not speaking Korean.My mom and I came here for her birthday for LUNCH. I'm assuming that service would be better during this time, and that it'd be easier to get a table by the window since it's not as busy. We ordered their lunch course which is a four course meal and cost $45 for each person. It was pretty okay. I mean, the portions were quite small, but I left full since it was four courses. Just keep in mind that this place does not have Korean soul-food as the experience is meant to be ""fine-dining"", and the portions are much smaller. Overall, I really liked the ambiance and views of the place. The food is just so-so, and I'm not saying that because it's not street or soul food.

This restaurant served good quality food, but the portions were tiny and I left feeling sad and hungry. The service started off good, but then dropped dramatically - our meats and glasses were left unattended for the entire latter half of our meal.

I have given this place a few chances over the few months it's opened and can say my experience hasn't gotten better but worse. The location may be popular but the hostess staff are fairly rude and the service can use an upgrade -soon. I recently revisited the restaurant last weekend and after our meal we ordered some coffee, in one of the the americanos, my guest scooped up a small mysterious white substance half the size of a dime. I called a waiter who after a few minutes provided a new one but there was no real apology or any sense that anything was wrong. I was incredibly disturbed and don't think I can go back. I have been eating in k town since the early 2000s and can say that there are better Korean dining facilities but if you would like a nice view and in need of a modern-date like ambience go here.

2.0,10/11/2013,"I had high expectations for this restaurant as it was recommended to me. However, I was highly disappointed in their SERVICE. This is a Korean restaurant but most of the servers seem to be American/other ethnicities. It's a modern, Korean-American restaurant. The decor is nice and the restaurant is very dim inside, a slight lounge feel to it. Great for date night or for a business dinner. When you walk in, it's inside a corporate building and there is a host standing to the left. She will show you were the elevators are and you go straight up to the restaurant.First of all, we were seated in the dark, middle section where the beautiful NY view (main reason to come here) is NOWHERE in sight lol. We asked if we can sit at the tables by the window (there were no parties sitting there) and the waiter said no, its occupied... Fyi, about 4-5 tables by the window were in fact NOT occupied the entire night. I thought he couldn't seat us there because there were reservations but NOPE. On to the food, we ordered the steak tartare and the variety of pancakes (4 small pieces) for appetizers. Both pretty good, small portions, nothing too amazing.We also ordered a meat combo which came in VERY tiny portions so beware. If you're hungry, you're gonna wanna order alot...(and spend alot, too). This was barely enough for two. Comes with 4 different types of meat but it wasn't really the 'melt-in-your-mouth' type, in my opinion.We also ordered cocktails. The Korean pear margarita and some lychee cocktail. Both were mediocore, nothing amazing. It just didn't taste very good. I don't recommend their cocktails. Lastly, we got the Black Forest cake with vanilla ice cream for dessert. Pretty good, but again- nothing spectacular. Nevertheless, we paid about $200+ for dinner and although the food was pretty good and fresh, the servers were just... weird?They kept standing by our table and staring, hardly came to ask if the food was okay. When he brought out the meat, he asked if we want to cook it ourselves, so we said ""umm.. okay?"" and he never came back to check. BTW, don't opt to cook it yourself, it's such a hassle and very inconvenient. They were pretty awkward and also kept forgetting things. I asked for rice, he forgot it. I asked for the dessert menu, he forgot it.I expected pretty good service for a higher end restaurant in Mid-town Manhattan but I was quite dissapointed.

We got the seafood pancake as a starter, which we have had dozens of times before. But this one was different!!! It had a thick, heavy crust and tons of flavor, and not very doughy as it usually is. This is the standard all other seafood pancakes should be compared to.We also got the mushroom appetizer, which we thought very little of when we ordered it, but it was the single best side dish or appetizer we have ever eaten. It was just a bed of different kinds of mushrooms (we're not talking button mushrooms) that were grilled and had some vinegar/soy sauce/garnish going on. It looked simple, but tasted amazing. We will come back esp for these 2 appetizers!Also got the jap chae, which was good but nothing mind blowing. The meat barbeque (we got beef) was good, but nothing mind blowing.

Here's where my wife and I set the bar and were let down.That for a course / tasting menus allowing for the swapping out of beef / pork for chicken / seafood. (For Korean cuisine, we were told this isn't possible. Our fault I suppose. My wife doesn't eat pork/beef but I do.)That for a party of two we could have food on the table within an hour of sitting down. It was an hour and thirty minutes before we had food on the table because our waiter kept disappearing for really long intervals. Nothing provided in the mean time. That when buying a bottle of wine the wait staff are attentive and pour the wine for you and refill glasses. (I know I know, we are capable of this on our own, but after visiting many restaurants in the $$$ and $$$$ range, we've come to expect this as a standard of attentive service of wait staff.)That wait staff, when seeking out the answer to a question, won't take 20 mins to get back to you when the restaurants is not busy, and all together disappear when needed. (only a third of the restaurant was being used and that's being generous)That it won't be a full hour before you find out that the tasting menu isn't available to you early on a Saturday night even if you'll take it as the chef intends it and having stated interest in doing the tasting menu when meeting our waiter.As you can probably tell, the above is also a list of complaints.The ONLY thing this place has going for it is the view. The food wasn't worth the price as I've had far better Korean BBQ for far cheaper. The service was the worst we've ever encountered. That said, the staff wasn't rude, they just obviously didn't give a damn about attentive / thoughtful service.EDIT: After having posted the initial review, I've had a chance to speak with the manager Mr. Park. If I look at my experience with the restaurant holistically, I can say Mr. Park has done everything he can to make up for the poor experience my wife and I had. Given that we don't live any where near the restaurant, we can't go back to them for a free meal or for them to prove their service is worthy of their price range. I will state that if we were close enough to revisit, we would. Gaonnuri has made up for it's poor experience delivery in my opinion. Because of this I've changed my rating from one star to three.

As for the view, it is every bit as stunning as all the other reviews said it was. We had a prime view of Times Square, and the rest of the gorgeous New York City scape. We thought it fitting to try the table top barbecue and it didn't disappoint. It was a fun way to dine, and the meat was delicious - even for someone like me, who is not a big meat-eater. No matter how full you are, you have to try the dessert too. Every option was a unique take on a traditional dessert, like yuzu parfait with green tea ice cream.

5.0,8/8/2013,"I am literally still in disbelief that I ate at this place last night.  I spent the day with a friend who is visiting from California, and she invited me to join her for dinner with her cousin.  Both of us thought it would be a casual affair, so when we stepped out of the elevator on the 39th floor into this incredibly posh space with mood lighting and giant decorative vases, well... we both felt a little silly for having worn street clothes.  The entire restaurant is encased in glass panels so you can watch the city below you as you eat--and my GOD, what a view!As a vegetarian, I wasn't able to try any of the various meat dishes that the others got, but my friend's cousin got an order of beef, which they brought to the table uncooked, and actually grilled right in front of us in the little grill pit in the middle of the table.  As for the food that I could eat, there were several mushroom platters that were absolutely divine, and there was a spicy dish with rice and vegetables that I loved.  And the desserts!  Lemme tell ya, the deserts were straight up art.  There were 6 of us, so we shared 3 desserts: a strawberry/raspberry/blueberry panna cotta (probably my favorite of the three), a pear concoction with ginger, and a decadent black forest cake which the waiter flambéed at the table for a dramatic effect.  All of them were as scrumptious as they were pretty to look at.Also, as a side note, I appreciated that I didn't feel unwelcome because of my attire.  We'd spent the day walking around and I hadn't expected that I would be going anywhere fancy, so I was wearing cut-off shorts and a Radiohead t-shirt.  Not exactly nice dinner wear.  But in spite of that, the waiters were all extremely courteous and friendly to us, and even their behavior with each other made the place feel warm, instead of stuffy and pretentious.  Their prices are high enough that I would never have been able to go there on my own; however, I do not think that their prices are unreasonable, given the quality of the food and service, and the incredible view and ambiance.",1,0,1,Sabina M.,"Brooklyn, NY",67,23,0

It took a while to realize there was a podium with a girl standing there with a discreet sign that says Gaonnuri. Oh. haha There it is. Making my way.....upstairs (Thousand Miles reference anyone?), I was surprised to find the restaurant to be much more sophisticated and chic than I thought. Amazing views and the atmosphere was not stuffy and unwelcoming as you would normally expect from a place of such high class. My tip? Go for lunch. Seriously.

1.0,7/5/2013,"Five-star views wasted on a manipulative, tasteless restaurant.I had read some not-so-great reviews about this place before coming, but the wonderful decor and quite spectacular views of the city (even on a rainy evening) upon emerging from the elevator onto the 39th floor restaurant lured me into a false sense of security.Unfortunately, that moment of reprieve from the crowds and noisy bustle of streetlevel K-town was shortlived, and all pretty much went downhill from there. Because there was no more window seating available, we took the next best (seating higher up with still a pretty clear view all around). We were told this table did not have a bbq - fine we'll just order a bibimbap instead was our rationale in taking this option. When we saw the menu though, we realized, with the necessary guidance of our server, that (1) we need to pay extra for side dishes, (2) the bibimbap comes either a la carte without side dishes, or $5 more with side dishes, and (3) you can't order the bibimbap a la carte unless you also order a bbq dish. So, since (4) we can't order bbq because our table doesn't have a stove, we basically HAD to get the bibimbap with side dish option. It may just be me, but all the convoluted rules the menu has just to gouge a few extra dollars out of you really rubs me the wrong way (especially since every other Korean place provides free side dishes in the first place!). It didn't help that the waiter (who I otherwise had no complaints about) got a bit pushy and judgy for us to order an appetizer (which I was going to do initially but was so annoyed at the side dishes business I didn't even bother looking at the options).When the food finally came, they forgot the eggs we ordered with our bibimbaps (fine - brought em rather quickly so I'll let that slide). My friends were a bit miffed that the egg was already fried sunnyside up, rather than raw to be cracked into the bibimbap. I didn't actually have a problem with this. What I DID have a problem with, was the blandness of the actual bibimbap itself (I had the seafood stone pot). On the plus side, the ingredients were pretty good individually and were plentiful, but the dish just didn't come together. I didn't get the red pepper paste but instead got some other concoction to mix my rice with. It was pretty tasty but wasn't nearly enough to give flavor to the whole dish. I can safely say this was the worst bibimbap I've ever had! I mean honestly it was still decent, but just worse than what's served everywhere else in K-town and definitely not worth the extra pricetag. Perhaps some of their other offerings are better prepared, but if they can't even get bibimbap right ...Finally, it may be worth noting you cannot pack your leftover side dishes (even if none of you asked for a refill) to go. Seriously? That's just plain tacky and unwarranted (it wasn't like we didn't pay for these and you weren't going to just throw them away!). Whatever, frankly they were pretty terrible anyway - the kimchi had no taste (come to think of it, this seems to be a trend - I think maybe this place just caters to people who can't take any spicy).If you've actually read my whole rant/review (doubtful but stranger things have happened), you'll see that this place isn't without its merits. However, I hate (what I feel are) the crazy rules and restrictions this restaurant forces on the patrons, and the 1 star reflects that.  Plus the food just wasn't good enough to compensate.Bottomline: save your money - eat somewhere else in k-town - and maybe come to this place for a drink to enjoy the views before or after.",5,3,2,Melissa M.,"New York, NY",39,198,50
4.0,7/1/2013,"The concept is awesome! A nice upscale korean restaurant overlooking the city! LOVE IT! The food we had was good too. We had kalbi-sal and naengmyun. It tasted good. The kimchi was okay too, most Korean restaurants can be judged by their kimchi, if the kimchi is good most of the time the other food will be good. I like my kimchi with not a lot of fish sauce and I believe that is how they make it. Next time we are in NY definitely going back!",3,1,2,Jakki K.,"Orlando, FL",194,106,5

After it cooked further in the bowl, the rice got crispy at the bottom which was nice. We also received some kimchi on the side, along with cold meat and other side dishes. As we came for lunch, the menu seemed cheaper. The amazing 360degree views of midtown and beyond compensated for the somewhat mediocore food. It's not crowded during lunch.

2.0,6/21/2013,"I took my interns here for graduation celebration and felt bad b/c the food has just gotten worse from when I visited back in February.  I was looking forward to the galbi jjim the most, but for whatever reason, they've completely changed this entree.  What's pictured on the website isn't even what they serve anymore.  What used to be a delicious pot of short rib braised in soy sauce with a decent amount of chestnuts, carrots, dates, and some rice cakes is now a few pieces of boneless short rib piled on top of one another on a plate with what seemed like just three pieces of carrot.  I asked the waiter what happened b/c this is not what it was like in the past, but he said he wasn't sure since he just started working two weeks ago.  The individual banchan dishes that included chicken chunks and pickles are gone.  Now the table gets some mediocre shared banchan plates of kimchi and pickled turnips. Marinated galbi for the barbecue was fine, but wow, the chicken was horrible.  Not only was it super dry, but it was seasoned with rosemary--not very Korean.  Also, the dipping sauce had a medicinal bitter flavor to it.  Mandoo--ran out of it for the night so we couldn't even order it.  The black forest baked Alaska was fun to order for a dessert, but overly sweet.  Some things were okay, like the jap chae and pa jeon, but definitely not as good as other Ktown spots and especially not for the price.  My favorite thing of the night, besides the view, might have been the Jasmine Dream tea and I think that's pretty sad.  So very disappointed and doubt I will be returning.",0,0,0,Mandy L.,"New York, NY",115,623,1591

4.0,6/12/2013,"A Korean restaurant in Koreatown with nice ambiance and a view!  If you're in the mood for Korean but want to go somewhere nice without being crammed into a small space like most places in K-town, Gaonnuri is the place to go.The restaurant sits on the 39th floor of a building on the southeast corner of Broadway and 32nd street.  Reservations are recommended - people who had reservations were seated almost immediately.  Otherwise you can wait in their lounge area and enjoy the view from the floor to ceiling windows.Prices are reasonable considering the nice space and view that you can enjoy with your meal.  I ordered the bosam to start with and a mixed bbq combo platter, which consisted of marinated kalbi, beef brisket, and the pork belly.  The bosam was good, although the cuts seemed a bit big - we had to cut each piece into two to have it fit in the wrap.  The kalbi was thicker cut than what I'm used to seeing at other Korean BBQ restaurants.  The seasoning was light and didn't take away from the flavor of the meat.  The side dishes were a little light, which was disappointing, but we didn't leave hungry.I came here once before and my friends enjoyed the mool nengmyun.  Overall, this is a good place to go if you want to enjoy Korean dishes in a nice setting, and don't want to be interrupted by the drunk crowd that tends to stumble into K-town restaurants past midnight.",4,0,2,Brian C.,"Manhattan, NY",26,270,0
3.0,6/5/2013,"Dragged my family here following my graduation. I like the interior, great view, and service. However, it was the food and prices that brought the rating down. Based on the reviews I read, I was expecting to be blown away with some crazy, artistic culinary presentations. However, all we got was typical Korean fare at exorbitant prices. Sorry, but again, I can't help but being SoCal Korean about this. People who are easily impressed with claims of ""MSG-free,"" ""fresh,"" and ""imported"" really have no clue that those are pretty much standard these days. Even the soju that's sitting in my fridge is fresh, MSG-free, and imported!! Should've known better than to trust non-Korean reviewers...Korean cuisine, as I know it, is supposed to be rustic, simple (with complex flavors), and affordable to the masses with no bullshit. One of the things that made me laugh here was that there were two different sizes of Haemul pa-jun (Korean seafood/scallion pancake) - a small ($12) and a large ($18). The large gives you like four more pieces for the extra $6. Now, if any of you ever made pa-jun at home, the extra batter required to add a couple more inches to the total diameter of your damn pancake amounts to not even a few fluid ounces!!! I mean, why even bother with the sizes? Make it just one order or bring it out as a complimentary dish like others do! Turned out the large was smaller than pa-jun The bossam was alright...again not as large as I'm used to. The biggest disappointment was that it did not come with raw oysters, which is a necessary part of this popular dish. We also got the cod jorim. It was good, but for almost $30, all that came out was literally one fillet. Other places give you the whole fish for much less. Oh and let's not forget the rice...which is not only extra here, but it's frickin $3 per bowl!!!!!!I mean c'mon guys...I understand you're trying to be all high-end here and that you have a fat lease to pay, but don't take it out on us. Trying to be like Morimoto and shit...minus the celebrity chef and crazy, artistic culinary presentations....The final impression I got was that this place is all about using gimmicks as an excuse to skimp on the food, which should be the main attraction of any dining experience.",3,1,1,David Y.,"New York, NY",2,16,0

1.0,5/16/2013,"The only reason to go is the view, which is impressive (especially compared to other K-Town restaurants where your view is the trash bags piling up on 32nd Street). We were a group of 8 and the first problem is that they screwed up our reservation and gave us a different (obviously worse) table than we had reserved (no view, no BBQ at the table). We ordered the $50 prix-fixe menu which was disappoint throughout the meal. The starters were way too little for 8 people to share and the quality (especially the seafood pancake) was disappointing compared to other Korean restaurants on the street. The BBQ was OK, but nothing special and lacking the usual tons of side dishes that come at other BBQ places. The dessert (snickers bar version) was good. Service was pretty bad as well - not outright rude but disinterested and somewhat amateur. Overall, you can get the food we got for $25 and of much better quality anywhere else in K-Town (New Wonjo, Shilla, etc.).

4.0,5/13/2013,"Great dining experience! The service was wonderful as our waiter was so friendly. The front hostess was a bit less nice as she ignored me for about 2 minutes when I was the only person waiting. As everyone else says, the view is absolutely amazing! If you go during dinner time, you can see the sun set over lower Manhattan or Jersey City as well. There is one side of the restaurant that has the best view of the Empire State building but that portion of the restaurant had smaller tables. For drinks I tried the pear margarita and the maldive mojito. The maldive mojito was better and it was one of the best mojitoes I have ever had. It was so smooth and refreshing. For appetizers, we tried the beef tartare with pear, seafood pajun, japchae, black cod, mandoo and mushroom bokkeum. My favorite was a tie between the cod and the japchae. The cod was cooked perfectly and it almost resembled sea bass. The japchae had pieces of dukbokki in it and it was delicious. For dinner, we did all barbecue. The waiter cooked all the meats for us. Make sure to ask your waiter how to maneuver the grill before he leaves as we must have turned the knob the wrong way because we almost had a fire situation on our hands. For barbecue, we tried duck breast, marinated rib eye and chicken. My favorite was the rib  eye and my least favorite was the chicken. Even though it was marinated in basil sauce, it was still not as flavorful as I would like. We also got  a sizzling bibimbap for the table and it was delicious as well. Perfect to balance all the meat.One interesting thing about their side dishes was that they included a fruit salad as one of the side dishes. I have never seen that before and it actually turned out to be pretty good. The sweetness of the fruit salad balanced the saltiness of all the meats. We were too full for dessert so had to leave that out. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",4,1,2,Cathy H.,"Brooklyn, NY",299,430,1304

3.0,3/30/2013,"Gaonnuri is a perplexing place.  One has to admire its aspirations: upscale Korean barbecue with a view to match its lofty name (""center of the world"").  Immediately evident at their business lobby entrance, where staff unobtrusively whisks guests through turnstiles to elevators that deposit at Gaonnuri's 39th floor perch.  Step out to face hanging shelves of Korean moon jars over the small, sleek bar.  This and the waiting area are separated from the restaurant by a glass wall of suspended wine bottles.  It makes an impression, and not what a typical Koreatown eatery below strike.Gaonnuri's greatest asset is its breathtaking view.  Designed to have part or all of three walls feature floor to ceiling windows, there are unobstructed views of the Midtown tableau.  Truly spectacular, and best appreciated by timing an evening meal to coincide with the transition from daylight to dark.The main dining room is spacious and appealingly laid out.  Starting from the corner furthest from the windows, seating fans out first in a raised dining area, then to a semi-ring of comfortable booths, and onto tables that line the windows.  Seating is comfortable and roomy.The menu looks familiar, if considerably edited from standard Korean bbq.  Not at all an issue if the point is to focus on quality and execution.  On offer are cold dishes, twice as many hot dishes, a variety of table bbq choices, jeongol (hot pot), bibimbap, naeng myeon, soups and stews, and jungsik.  The alcohol menu is less adventurous than it initially looks, although the existence of a long (and expensive) wine list is atypical.  There are house cocktail choices, a spattering of soju and Korean wines, and mainstream bottled and draft beers.  Our round of cocktails were serviceable, but not particularly worthy of their price tag.While unsurprising, one should approach Gaonnuri's menu with the expectation of small portions.  Modum jun is an assortment of pajun offered in small and large sizes, as are most of the hot dishes.  Small works for 2 - 3, large for 4 - 6, but these are just tastings.  Four types of pajun, of which the nokdoo jun was by far the best, and two others utterly unremarkable and oily.  Bibim naeng myeon, a sweet potato noodle served cold in a spicy sauce was served too early, but sitting ruined it for consumption, as the noodles clumped together.  The flavor of the spicy sauce was ordinary.  This was entirely recouped by the fantastic dolsot bibimbap.  Their version of that classic mixed rice dish was one of the best I ever had (stateside experiences only).  Good rice, lustrous and smooth with just the right amount of crispy rice bits mixed in, in a gochujang of surprising subtlety; squid added in was cooked perfectly.The bbq platter was accompanied by minimal banchan, just kimchi, chopped lettuce, marinated radish, and marinated sliced onions.  Our friendly waiter kept a close eye on the cooking, and happily accommodated a request for garlic pieces to toss in.  Beef brisket and pork belly were tasty.  Best was marinated galbi, thick and tender, although I've had better flavors elsewhere as theirs veered salty.Their desserts are beautifully presented, far more so than anything else served.  But as we sampled their deconstructed soo jeong kwa (pear subbing in for persimmons) and yuzu parfait (similarly deconstructed but not labeled as such), I found myself thinking of Spot Dessert Bar in Astor Place, which serves Asian-inflected desserts of similar flavors at considerably better prices and greater variety.Service was well-intended but uneven.  To have service commensurate with upscale ambitions does not occur accidentally, and it is plain that Gaonnuri needs to tighten oversight to achieve it.  While individual interactions with staff were mostly positive, there were elementary gaffes hard to forgive at their price point.  One was the haphazard order of food and drink arrival, with drinks arriving after appetizers, and naengmyeon served early in the bbq.  Servers seem to get mixed messages.  As we were given the check, our waiter welcomed us to take our time; not 5 minutes later, a manager arrived and informed us she'd like us to vacate for another reservation.  It was done professionally, with seats offered at the lounge, but this is the type of crack in Gaonnuri's polished surface that mar the experience.I am unlikely to have a full dinner again here, although I concede the possibility of returning for lunch just for that bibimbap.  It is not the place for those discerning of Korean cuisine or conscious of value.  If neither applies, Gaonnuri is a place to impress someone or if such a posh setting and spectacular view is desired.  It currently fits a unique niche in NYC but time will tell if they raise their performance to match their setting.",2,1,3,Valery C.,"Forest Hills, NY",56,837,9616

We had no problem making a reservation, as the restaurant is very spacious. It definitely got busier as the night went on though.I sipped a London Crystal cocktail, which was light and not too sweet. We all enjoyed some mandoo and the Korean pancake sample (hint: the beef one is definitely the best). Everything was so delicious and the service was great. For the main course, I split the beef hot pot with my husband, and that was cooked in the kitchen, but served simmering atop our grill-table. It was huge and could definitely feed 2-3 people; we could not finish it. I had a bite of my friend's grilled miso black cod, and that was very rich and buttery, one of the best examples that I've tried. It goes without saying the view from the 39th Floor is stunning at sunset, as is the decor, and it reminded me of a few swanky places I went to in Tokyo. So it's a very transporting type of restaurant. The prices were on the high side, but not ridiculous considering your surroundings. The bill worked out to around $100/pp with our appetizers, entrees, and multiple cocktails (they let us hang out at our table for a good 45 minutes sipping more cocktails before we left for our karaoke reservation). So don't worry about ""paying for the view"" -- you're not. My friends and I all had a fabulous meal, and I highly recommend Gaonnuri.",5,1,2,Meghan A.,"New York, NY",235,593,533
4.0,3/25/2013,"Finally a different Korean option to the MSG laden food found in the chaotic & dive-y restaurants in K-town. Yes, the prices are expensive but not obscenely so. Also, last I checked, any decent place in K-town is extremely expensive. So anyone who complains about that hasn't really been eating at a lot of ktown spots, especially for bbq or for drinks. The food is very fresh. The yukhoe (raw beef) was phenomenal according to my husband. I loved their bibimbap. I liked their banchan and you can definitely tell the quality of their ingredients. It's upscale without being too stuffy. Daytime has a great calm ambiance. At night the lights dim down and you can see the spectacular view of the city. It's spacious and not too noisy.  No club music all up in your face. No sweaty irritated ajumma waitresses running around. The staff is professional. The decor is modern. I've recommended this place to a handful of people. And I'll definitely come back again.",1,0,1,Emily J.,"Pittsford, NY",0,64,31

The food on the other hand, was just ok We ordered the marinated galbi, octopus bokkeum, Doengjiang jigae and the black cod in soy bean sauce My favorite item was the black cod in soy bean sauce, it was tender and fresh and marinated nicely in the sauce. The galbi was a bit disappointed. Small portion, nothing special. The octopus bokkeum and the doengjiang jigae were both just ok. I have had better The banchan here was a bit disappointing.

My favorite was when the waiter explained to us  (I'm Korean, dining w non koreans) that we would be eating an exotic mountain plant -- which last time I checked were sesame leaves which my mom gets at the grocery store for not the price listed.

4.0,3/24/2013,"Went there in January to celebrate a birthday and ate lunch there.  My friends and I all ordered the $20 lunch special, most of us got bulgogi.  The proportions were pretty big, and the staff was nice.  My only issue with the menu was the soups they had for the lunch. They only had two choices; both were spicy and as I am not a fan of spicy food I had to make my friends eat it for me.  I forget the other choices they had but I do remember they had this nice multi-grain rice that my friend ordered instead of white rice so I do appreciate the healthy options they have here. The view was great, and we made reservations for the window seat so it really made the meal so much more enjoyable.  The only downsides were the fact that all the kids there were crying (like practically every other customer had a child or infant that was unhappy, therefore crying).  Also when we finished our meal it took a while for the staff to give us the bill.  Its not like we hate being there, but we had other stuff to do and we were one of their few customers.  Our attempts to make eye contact failed and after a few minutes we were able to call over someone and ask for our check.  Other than that I enjoyed it and I would definitely like to go back.  If I could I would give 4 1/2 stars, but since that isn't an option then I must sadly give 4.  I highly recommend this spot for lunch or dinner because of the great view and the tasty, well proportioned food.Advice for customers: Make a reservation in advance and if you want a window seat, make sure to let them know (if you make the reservation online list it in the comments section).  Also, don't bring your kids if they're under 12 years old.  I saw the kids there and they didn't enjoy themselves so save your kids the tears and take them to a kid friendly place.  No offense to the restaurant...Advice for the restaurant: Please have more options for soup that aren't spicy at all.",1,0,1,Sarah Y.,"Flushing, NY",95,23,16

We had a bit of a rocky start, but once our contacts communicated with their staff that evening, everything was smooth sailing. Jason and the team were fantastic. They were very accommodating and proactive. Upon settling in our cast, Jason informed the tables around ours that filming would be taking place for the next hour or so and that they were welcome to move to another table if they were against being on camera.Service was fast with a flare. According to the cast the food was fantastic even though our female protagonist wasn't a fan of spicy food. The desserts were to die for!Overall, lovely ambiance.

4.0,3/10/2013,"I actually tried to talk a friend out of eating here for his birthday dinner after reading some of the previous reviews. It was his first time trying Korean food and I thought he would be better served visiting a place less expensive and more established. He really wanted to show his wife the view so I relented and tried to be positive about dining here. I'm no expert in Korean food but after experiencing Gaonnuri I found the food to be better than adequate and the service to be great. Okay, so the bar area is a nice place to wait if you arrive early. The atmosphere is definitely upscale and trendy. People were dressed for an evening out. Also, if you're sitting in a booth apparently there is a mandatory coat check. We sat in the lower dining room area with a view of the Empire State building. We started with the beef and tofu dumplings and pancake sampler. When the dumplings (10 in a large order) arrived, they were larger than I expected and were round in nature instead of half circle shaped. I thought they tasted pretty good. The pancake sampler arrived with 3 pieces for each type of pancake. I know other Korean places provide a pancake that is as large as the plate but these pieces were maybe the size of two ritz crackers in length. I thought they tasted good but were expensive for the amount received.My friends went on to order some bulgolgi and 4 bibimbaps. The banchan arrived at the table as a dish with 4 sections. We were given some kimchee, some tofu, some squid with julienned cucumbers and burdock root sticks. Our server was gracious enough to bring us two of these plates. The amount of bulgolgi that arrived was an ample amount, think noodle bowl's worth (it should be at $28). I thought the Dolsot bibimbaps were suppose to mixed and served table side but ours arrived in super hot metal bowls already mixed. I ordered the galbi and did not get much protein in my bowl. One of my friends enjoyed his octopus dolsot even though it was very spicy. The octopus was served chopped into sugar cube sized pieces. The other two liked their regular bibimbaps although the novice didn't get the raw egg on his. All in all I thought Gaonnuri provided a nice dinning experience. The decor and service were very good. I thought the food was pretty good, not great though. I would choose this venue based on location and atmosphere but not necessarily if I wanted to go out for Korean.",2,0,2,Steve S.,"New York, NY",32,125,565

And yet, the only thing I could focus on was the disposable chopsticks.Why does a restaurant so focused on cultivating a high-class atmosphere (sights, wait staff dress code, lighting) have disposable chopsticks?I got a Bibimbap and was surprised at how well the meat was prepared but how old the veggies seemed. For such a basic dish, I expected better.All in all, the disposable chopsticks gives away the faults of Gaonnuri; it wants to be a high-end Korean restaurant, but it's lacking the polish to be truly fantastic.",2,1,1,Andrew Q.,"Cambridge, MA",91,148,0
4.0,3/1/2013,"Not bad. I heard good things and bad things about Kristabelli so I was wary of the high priced Korean fine-dining experience when Gaonnuri opened. So basically I find the food to be authentic and very good but comparable to the other restaurants in k-town. The reason to go is really the view itself is pretty kick-ass especially if you score a table by the window. Service is non-rushed (almost down right slow compared to the rushed service at other restaurants) which is nice, as I can enjoy a Korean meal without being pushed out of the restaurant, but its expected in a nicer venue like this. I'd say prices are about 20% higher than other Korean places. I find this justified because the restaurant itself is very nice, you're like on the 40th floor with wraparound views of Manhattan, and better than average service.  Its not very hard to score a table here. The times I went, I found quite a few empty tables which surprised me given most of ktown is packed at dinner. Makes me wonder if this place will last. I like the place, I just wonder if it will last. I don't think people will treat this as an everyday dining experience b/c some people like myself look at Korean food as basic sustenance. I'm hungry, I want to eat Korean food. Bottom line. Gaonnuri is not the first name that pops to mind though when I think of places to eat. I see it as a special occasion kind of place. If someone asks me where to take his parents, I would recommend Gaonnuri. It'll be interesting to see if they can last. They also have a nice bar when you enter which I think is great for drinks and is lacking at all of the other korean restaurants in Manhattan.

I never go by reviews people write, I like to experience my self and Josephine proved me right, she was our server and she was just too good. Mind you she didn't knew that we were celebrating a special occasion as in other places if the service team knows that customer are in for special occasion they tend to get special attention, but in my case we left it all on Josephine, she recommended us great food without ripping our pockets and enough till we were full. Very attentive and made us feel as if we were regular guest of this place. Half way through our meal I had made up my mind of coming back to this place again.

Not a lot of banchan, but they're generous with what they give you, and there aren't many of the filler/dud banchan you sometimes get at other Ktown establishments.

2.0,2/24/2013,"I was taking a friend out to dinner and decided to check this place out.  The view is great, food was pretty good, the menu is confusing, the seating assignment needs to be clearer, and the wait staff could use more training.  We decided not to sit on the BBQ table because we wanted to get a table with the best view we can get.  We hadn't made reservations so the next best available seats were for the non-BBQ tables.  Then we had to talk to the waiter about three times before he took our order because there were things that you can or cannot order from the menu based on what table we chose.  If we can't order certain things by not sitting at a BBQ table, shouldn't they have a different menu or at least note on the menu what we can order?! I thought it was ridiculous.I definitely thought that the service needs improvement.  We were having an okay time but were tired, so when the waiter cleared out the table, we asked for the check.  Instead of obliging with our request, the waiter started talking about how Korean people think when the table is cleared, they think they are being asked to leave whereas non-Korean patrons get offended when the table is not cleared out.  I thought it was completely unprofessional that he's stereotyping his own patrons not to mention this could be a rather easy fix if he just asked if he could clear out the table and if we want to order coffee/other drinks.  Basically, you got a first class view with the decoration to match, but the service was underwhelming... If you just wanted good, solid Korean food and didn't care so much about the view or service, you should check out other Korean restaurants on the 32nd st.  If they want to take this to the next level, they really have to figure out the details.

After reading other yelp reviews I was skeptical of the portion sizes, but I decided to give it a go anyway & I was very glad that I did. We split two appetizers and got a soup entree each and left full with decent leftovers. That being said, the food was good, but not mind blowing.   I was also shocked that this place didn't break the bank, especially considering the view they could totally choose to exploit. Like others have said, the service is good. Almost every table was occupied, with a packed bar as well as several people waiting for a table yet our waiter didn't rush us out or anything.

Minus one star for the 14-year-old-looking clueless hostesses.  Since our table wasn't ready, they had us hang out at the bar where we had some cocktails.  Every time my husband went to check on our table (because they kept saying ""we'll come get you in 5 min""), they had no idea who he was and no idea why he kept asking about our table.  Basically they kept forgetting about us until we kept reminding them we were still waiting.  They need some more experienced hostesses who can remember a face and decipher a reservation system.",1,0,1,Flora S.,"New York, NY",1,41,0

3.0,1/25/2013,"This place is a little pricey. Having said that I'll admit I've had many meals in less expensive places where a few drinks made the check just about the same per person. So I wouldn't consider it outrageously expensive. But Gaonnuri is just expensive enough that I expect something to dazzle me. Because I'd feel foolish shelling out this kind of money simply for the pleasure of eating in the same room with others willing to do so.  I always hope the dazzle will come from the food, because I cook at home, and it's a pleasure to eat something better than what I can do myself. Unfortunately the Korean BBQ here is not better than what I can do myself. I was taught how to do it by a friend's Korean mother, so my standards might be a little high. Can't argue with the quality of the meat they use, though. But overall the BBQ was good, just not amazing. The side dishes that came with the BBQ ranged from delicious (salad and winter squash) to insipid (broccoli), with the kimchi landing somewhere in the middle.They did manage to dazzle in other areas. The views out the windows of this restaurant are the kind of thing that would blow your out of town friends away. The decor is the kind of casual posh that manages to be unashamedly upscale without feeling like a put on - civilized and a little slick without feeling stuffy or over trendy. The space is very well done.The service was also excellent.  The staff was uniformly young, good looking and on point. They fit with the view and decor perfectly - they seemed like pros, not kids working here until something better came along.Don't know whether I'd recommend having dessert here, but the yuzu parfait was enjoyable.

Yes, the portions tend to be small, but unlike what some reviewers mentioned, the quality of the meats and food are NOT poor and everything was incredibly fresh and well presented. One reviewer mentioned that Korean food is not meant to be ""fancy"". Who ever came up with such a rule?! I think it is awesome that someone finally opened up a high-quality Korean restaurant with breath-taking views, awesome food, and a great variety of dishes. If you would like to ""fill your belly up"", you can always order more food. Edit*: In any Korean BBQ restaurant, there is some responsibility on the diner to tend to the meat on the grill. It is very common to eat straight from the grill. Therefore, if you see your meat burning, you can easily flip the meat yourself or take it off the grill and eat it! Let's not whine and complain that our food wasn't spoon-fed to us...FYI, The built-in exhausts sucked out all the smoke from the BBQ so we left the restaurant smelling like we did before dinner- and not like a walking plate of galbi.

1.0,1/20/2013,"You're paying for the view.If you're looking for authentic Korean food, this is NOT the place to go.As a Korean myself, none of their dishes (the ones I ordered) were different from what you get in other restaurants in K-Town, and they were definitely too westernized for my liking.Service was absolutely terrible and staff members definitely lack experience.My boyfriend took me here to celebrate our anniversary and it was a disastrous experience.Despite being reminded four times, our waitress didn't bring him his drink for 30 minutes. Not only that, she ""forgot"" to tell us that certain grill pans were only for certain kind of meats. When she arrived at our table, she gave me a smirk (as if to mock me for using the wrong grilling pan), laughed and told me I wasn't using the right one.Once she figured out I was Korean, she refused to speak in English. My boyfriend felt really uncomfortable and couldn't really understand what was going on. At one point, the fire went out on our grill, so I called her over and she lit it on fire while yelling out, ""IT'S MAGIC!"". At that point, I think both of us weren't feeling comfortable being there.To top that off, after paying the bill, my boyfriend was waiting for me in front of the bathroom. Our waitress came up to him, grabbed him by his arm and demanded to know why she wasn't tipped well. Despite her terrible service, we thought that a 15% tip was reasonable.All in all, we had a horrifying experience at this place, and they really need to teach their FOBBY employees NOT to put their hands on their customers. This isn't Korea, that kind of behavior isn't acceptable and is extremely RUDE.This is a place good for drinks and not so much good for food.",2,0,1,Roseanne I.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0

When you step out of the elevator, you can see the lavish bar and to your right is where the hostesses are. There is a waiting area if you have to wait right next to the bar. The hostesses found us a table and we were seated new the window and let me tell you, the view is great (especially at night). you get to see a lot of the buildings and also the hudson river so try and get a seat near the window. The decor is amazing and I felt like I was in one of those high end restaurants you see in the movies. The Food: Very Delicious. the waitress gave us good recommendations and we started with the calamari salad (highly recommended) and then we had some steamed dumplings. Our main entree was the Marinated Kalbi and let me say this, they marinate is perfectly!! As a korean person I've eaten my  fair share of kalbi and this is by far one of the best I've ever had. it is marinated perfectly and the quality of the meat is extremely good. Service: our waitress seemed like she genuinely cared about our time there and she was always there when we needed her. She asked us several times if we needed anything and she cooked our kalbi the way it is supposed to be cooked.

When the food came, we were given banchan- enough for a family of 4 with some leftovers which was delicious. The food were served nicely and eloquently. It was so yummy! The meat (I had the korean raw meat- yookhwae) which I had for the first time was AMAZING. It was very good and the quality was impeccable.OH, the calamari salad. IT WAS THE BEST THING I EVER ATE. It was really good, and the next time I go there, I will definitely get it again. yum:) Other food that we ordered was one of the best korean food I tried in NYC. The galbi- yummmmmmm, it is the finest quality of galbi. Even compared to the ones in other korean restaurants in Flushing, the galbi at Gaoonuri was delish. The desserts were great as well! The  snickers bar was a rainbow in my mouth!!!! It is a great dessert for those that like sweet chocolate wonders of heaven in their mouth. It is a combination of Snickers, mousse, cocoa and salted caramel ice cream (as described on their menu)mmmmmmmm yum, I can't wait to go there again!Before you go, you should make reservations.

5.0,1/1/2013,"First, I really don't understand why so many people hate this place. Definitly it worths for money and staffs are friendly. and THEY DON'T RUSH YOU TO LEAVE like another ktwon Korean restaurant. 1. Food is great. I am Korean but even in Korea, it's not easy to find a Korean restaurant like this for this price.  Good quality meat, nicely marinated and good grill. (If you have Korean grill, you smell like Korean grill right? but here it isn't.) 2.Portion is not generous either small, it's just okay. If you are looking for cheap big  portion restaurant, this is not a place to come, go to flushing. 3. Staffs are friendly, but they servers in the front and bar, they are kind of useless.Well, speed of service cannot be expected in the good Korean restaurant. If you go to hotel-owned Korean restaurant in Korea, they are all slow. So I can bear it. But if you have chance to be in a Korean restaurant and their food takes suspiciously short, you should avoid that restaurant. It's MSG tempest in your stomach or they are re-using the food. 4. Price, well I don't think it's over-priced. People are so used to expensive sushi but for Korean food, for god sake, why does it have to be cheap? They have proper Korean chef (unlike other restaurants), and he cooks food with much more delicated manner, nice decor, why are you still expecting K-town average? You pay 45 dollars for tuna sushi and think it's not overpriced and why do you think 38 dollars galbi is expensive? I simply don't get it. I mean it",11,0,2,Randy K.,"Manhattan, NY",2,5,0

I am glad we  made reservations as we were seated at a table with a prime view while there were several other parties waiting for tables. The views and room setting are fantastic. My lunch guest is a bit scared of heights and our table was away from the window but raised somewhat which made her happy but allowed for fantastic skyline views which we both enjoyed. I was also very impressed that with all the table bbq's going there was no grilling smell, fan sounds or drafts. Well engineered! Now down to the food . . The traditional Korean appetizer dishes were all good although none stood out from what I have had at other Korean restaurants.  For an appetizer we shared a seafood pancake which was well prepared and not greasy at all (vg). For our main course we shared Kalbi (vg) and Pork Belly (ok) - I enjoyed doing the grilling, which was a good thing as the wait staff was not very attentive. It took several minutes for someone to come over to change the grill for the pork. All in all it was quite an enjoyable experience and I will definitely return. I would recommend this if you are looking for a dining experience that is something special and a little bit different. 5 stars for the setting and views; 3 1/2 stars for the food; 2 1/2 stars for service.",3,0,0,Jim L.,"Rutherford, NJ",5,50,36

The haemul pajun is by far the best that I've had so far in k town so make sure you start with that. The beef tartare was beautifully presented and was also delicious. The best part of the meal, unsurprisingly, was the BBQ. My favorite were the duck and marinated galbi. The shrimp was just all right so I would pass on that the next time I come. We weren't going to order a dessert because we were so full but my friend had heard great things about the dessert so we went with the deconstructed snickers bar and the yuzu parfait.

2.0,12/14/2012,"""Welcome to the center of the world!""Initially, I was excited to try this restaurant after reading a glowing review from Time Out New York. Gaonnuri possesses a bold name and hides upstairs in an office building on the corner of 32nd & Broadway. Most folks who don't work in the building look like lost sheeple on their phones trying to find this restaurant. Find 1250 and walk in; there is the typical door man in the center, then a hostess to the left. She'll allow you to pass the turnstiles and take the elevator upstairs.Once inside you see a small bar then another hostess to your right. Chic and modern decor. As the hostess takes you to your seats, your pupils dilate immediately. What a view!Unfortunately, that's when it all ends. Overall the food portions were tiny and some items were disappointing. The black cod gui was oily; nok doo jun (mung bean pancake with pork & vegetables) was ok, but it was small (I'm talking about their large order). Galbi jjim was copasetic but yuk kae jang needs serious help. With this type of ordinary offering I don't see why I would return. It's like ordering off the kid's menu.Waitstaff was friendly, but service was surprisingly slow even when the restaurant was not full.Unsatisfied, I paid a hefty price for average Korean food. I get it, it's fusion. Disappointing value. You pay for the view. Even if I had an expense account, I would rather ditch the view and eat well at Don's Bogam BBQ & Wine Bar instead.Gaonnuri is all style, little substance.

For those curious on where the entrance is, you enter through the Woori Bank and tell the person downstairs you're going up to 39th and they will swipe you in. Once the elevator doors open, you'll be facing a surprisingly small bar where you can either grab a drink with some friends, or head over to hostess who will seat you. The second you turn right, you'll notice that the place is beautiful with spectacular city views for a restaurant, period. The space is quite large with elegant-but-not-stiff décor - think walls made of wine bottles, and a clean open kitchen where you can see all the chefs in action (which I love!). The main space is split level - tables on the main floor level with the open kitchen, as well as a lower dining area with more private/smaller seating by the windows - with AMAZING views. This is definitely not your typical Koreatown joint and you can see the Western influences evident in the décor. I would describe the vibe and interior as being similar to Kittichai - just must larger and open with high ceilings.We went on a Tuesday night at 7 PM (missed our earlier reservations) and they wouldn't give us a two-seater table, but there was still plenty of room to be seated. The place filled up around 8 PM or so, but never got packed. I assume management has been reading Yelp (and all the nasty reviews about their service) because the wait staff was on point yesterday - maybe even a little too much. They were pouring us glasses of water & wine every 20 minutes or so, and insisted we look at their dessert menu, which we passed on. Regarding the food, we had the regular bibimbap and cod fish stew. I think their food tastes fine - not horrible or unauthentic by any stretch of the imagination, nor are the portions small (it might vary though depending on what you get, ie: BBQ). It's just your average Korean food that's slightly pricier than normal, and note that this is NOT fusion Korean food by any means, despite what the restaurant claims. It's regular Korean food that's simply served more elegantly (ie: tiny banchans or side dishes in prettier China), and the flavor might be slightly toned down than, say, Keunjip.I wouldn't necessarily go here to get your Korean food fix though, especially if you're craving something particularly sinful like cheese ddukboki or budae jjigae. ;) It's really for the gorgeous views and a more ""upscale"" Korean dining experience. You could tell that the place was filled with lots of foodies and non-Koreans, as I'm sure the novelty has gotten many people quite curious to see what all the buzz is about.

1.0,11/30/2012,"This is the first time I've felt compelled to write about a restaurant.  More to the point about the reviewer from Timeout NY who gave this place a 4 star rating.  An absolute glowing review that made me change my original plans for dinner.  The only redeeming critique from the reviewer was that the space was attractive.  That's where it ended.  I don't think Mr. Cheshes ate the same food as we did.  We tried the pancake sampler (as recommended).  The texture was spongy and the taste was flavorless.  The miso black cod was so sub-standard.  The small steak-like piece was not buttery & flakey as sablefish should be.  Along with the fact that once again... tasteless.  (yes, I have had the cod at Nobu).  Shame on you for making the comparison.  We ordered the tabletop BBQ.  The ""Korean"" style short ribs were fatty little chunks and the tongue was not the quality I have experienced at other tabletop Korean restaurants.  Not only was it insulting to pay for food that was highly recommended but, it was a wasted night out for my guest who was in town from overseas for a limited time.",4,1,1,Debra O.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",0,1,0
1.0,11/28/2012,Food was mediocre. Service was horrible. Management has no clue what they are doing. Great location and exceptional interior.

1.0,11/22/2012,"All show, small portions and waiters with iPads. I'm going to emphasize that the service was horrible, especially with only two other tables occupied on a very quiet post hurricane Monday evening.Attentive service is critical especially since the meat doesn't BBQ itself. My partner is Korean so it became kind of self service but we didn't come up for a nice view and relaxing dinner to have to do this ourselves. I don't know whether it was because the waiter saw us and just ASSUMED we would like to do this ourselves or it was an honest case of absent service. We ordered the combination and after the first meat was done the waiter came to say the plate needed to be changed. Took an eternity for another person to come and change it, and only after we had to remind the waiter who is apparently too blasé to notice us sitting there doing nothing but wait for the plate exchange.After this, the pork belly was put on the hot plate. Most places would have the waiter at least somewhat concerned about the meat that they leave to cook. The pork belly was basically rubber by the time I put it in my mouth; the waiter was nowhere in sight to flip them or give any notice to doneness. Same thing happened to the brisket, but we had the common sense to take the meat off ourselves before it turned wholly into carbon- since we knew he wasn't coming back.There was about 10:1 staff to diner ratio.I had the impression that the restaurant was actually filled with ghost regulars because the iPad-wielding overlords glided around mechanically and directed the bussers with silent nods as if they were all part of a bustling world my five senses cannot detect. Surreal.This restaurant is the strongest evidence I've yet encountered for the existence of ghosts.I highly suggest diners bring a science vessel or at least come with a few charges left on the comsat in order to witness all the cloaked patrons who seem to have more weight with the staff than us regular folk.",14,9,5,George Y.,"Manhattan, NY",2,2,4
1.0,11/20/2012,"Let me first say that my wife and I love going to 32nd Street and doing the Korean BBQ thing.  We took some out of town friends to Gaonnuri last night who had never really experienced Korean BBQ.  After this, I don't think they'll ever want to experience it again.  Service was terrible.  They are completely overrun.  We were forgotten about multiple times, usually while our Tiger Prawns or Pork Belly were burning to a crisp on the way too hot grill.  We actually had to put the Pork on the grill ourselves because there was no server to be found anywhere.  Drinks came out wrong multiple times and the bottle of sake I ordered came to the table with the screw top opened and only 2/3 full.  No dishes were EVER cleared, unlike at the simple, much more delicious places on the street where service is incredibly attentive.  They're trying WAY too hard here to ""elevate"" Korean BBQ and they're doing it very poorly.  Portions are insanely small.  Bad bad bad.I will say that once all of our complaints were voiced to a manager that they took care of us nicely.  But this was two hours later and the damage had already been done.Please stick to the smaller places on street level.",14,6,6,Chuck R.,"New York, NY",2,3,0

3.0,11/18/2012,"Decor is sleek, definitely feels more upmarket than other Korean restaurants in the area. Lovely views of Manhattan if you can score a window seat, especially around dusk time. We went for an early dinner (5pm) since we were in the area, and although we had a time limit of 1.5hours (as we were walk in's and they were fully booked that evening), it was plenty of time to finish our meal, including dessert. Entry was slightly confusing - not sure if its a teething issue or a permanent one but the hostess at the lobby of the building, needed to swipe the number of people who entered the building - i guess it's for security reasons? Anyways she literally had to swipe 12 times through each turn style to let 12 people through. So it took a little time to get up to the restaurant.Service was good and wait staff were friendly, they all spoke english and are happy to explain the menu. Having said that, I found the prices to be a tad on the expensive side. This is what we had: $14 for small bossum which came with 6 or so small slices of pork with side of kimchi. $20 for galbi bibimbap which again came with small slices of galbi and only a few bits. $16 for nokdugeon (mungbean pancake) - this was my favorite dish of the evening. Delicious! Then we split a dessert - which is unusual for a Korean place to be offering but it was great! Had the Snickers Bar which is like a deconstructed snickers bar with ice cream. It was $12 for all desserts. Just over $80 for the dinner incl tax and tip but no drinks. Presentation was the dishes was nice - nice looking plates and bowls. Overall i think it's a great place to bring friends who are not familiar with Korean food - who may find the other restaurants on 32nd st a little hectic and intimidating. It's a very easy entry into the cuisine in a nice setting. Having said that I will probably stick to the other places in K-town except if i have visitors from out of town.",8,2,2,Ella C.,"New York, NY",9,60,6
4.0,11/18/2012,"I'm tempted to give Gaonnuri five stars for excellent BBQ and the amazing view, but it can still be improved so I'll stick with four for now. I enjoyed the bar and prices were reasonable given the atmosphere. However, table service was a bit slow and some of the appetizers we got were not as hot as they should have been. The waitresses were professional, but not as welcoming or attentive as at Miss Korea or Don's Bogam. I'm sure it will become harder to get a reservation as more people hear about it. I will have to go back soon while I can! It is one of the few restaurants I've been to outside of Korea that really reminds me of Seoul.",6,1,2,Adam E.,"Astoria, NY",86,95,3
4.0,11/17/2012,"Kudos for JK for exceptional, friendly and professional service throughout the evening. This is a great James Bond Cool spot with awesomely buttery ""meat velvet"" kalbi (be sure to ask for the marinated version) but it's not on the menu because the restaurant tries to hustle you to order it as part of a $95 Tasting Menu. Don't fall for this ruse, however. Instead, request the $68 Kalbi Dinner for 2 with panchan (the little piquant side dishes, salads and kimchi that typically accompany a barbecue beef meal.) That plus one of the heavenly desserts (i.e. like the deconstructed Snickers bar or Black Forest Baked Alaska) dreamed up by the former pastry chef at Daniel will leave you feeling totally sensually satisfying, along with the romantic lights of Manhattan enveloping you from high atop your perch over K-Town.",9,4,4,Erica K.,"New York, NY",0,17,0

Had to request it.  The water refills and wine came out really late, and we had to ask two OTHER waiters for it.  Asked for rice, came out another 10m later.  Waiters were very nice but busy.

4.0,11/9/2012,"I loved this place! It was really awesome. I would have given it a 5 star but the waiters were a lil confused about our order. It wasn't enough to upset me but I felt it a 5 star rating would be a bit much.1. The food is fantastic. Really delicious and not over priced at all. It's a lil more expensive than some of the other areas but you're paying for the view and beautiful ambiance.  Both of our desserts were an experience in itself, w/ a great dessert chef. The different kimchis that they served were really nice. I normally hate kimchi (had a bad experience before) but each one we tried was tasty and had their own unique flavor. I was truthfully impressed. My husband who loves kimchi just quietly ate, which was a good sign.  2. The waiters were very professional, our bbq order came out before one of our appetizers and even though our waiter was very cool about it you could tell he wasn't happy w/ the person who brought it out. Another tiny gaffe was made later w/ our dessert timing but it's barely mentioning b/c everyone there was fabulous! I'm sure that mistake was just because they are new and it was a busy. night3. The place was beautiful, well worth going back. It'd like to go back for my birthday. Best Korean food I've ever had. It's my husband's favorite place. The seating was comfortable and the space between tables wasn't tight. The noise level was also good. It was pin drop quiet but I didn't have to yell in order to have a conversation.

I had the lunch combo with kalbi and dwenjjang chigae, The staff is polite and professional. The portions were decent, I left feeling totally full and didnt want to move from the amazing window seat I had.  Lunch box was $20.  You also get six panchan with it.  They refill them as much as you want without even asking you. Sodas are $3, and apparently refills are another $3.  Wish they told me that before they brought another... minus a star for that. Sodas from the fountain should be free....but whatever.  Nice lunch in a nicely, new, clean location. Unlike all the other places in ktown this place does not rush you, lets you enjoy the scene, and works around your pace at eating.

5.0,10/12/2012,"I've been to this restaurant three times since it opened, and I've been impressed every single time.  - For starters, the view and ambiance is great.  Whether you are in the waiting room next to the wine racks, or siting by the main dining area next to the windows, or even on the elevated dining area with a view of the kitchen, the decor of the place is top notch.  - Second, the dining experience is quite different from other Korean restaurants, where you have to deal with a lot of noise pollution (drunk people acting all roudy) or smell pollution (I love the smell of galbi but not on sweater please). They got this cool ventilation system where it sucks out all the air from the grill. In general, you got the impression that this was a classy place, with classy people.- Third, the food was great. It was somewhat disappointing that they didn't have more ""experimental/fusion"" dishes but I think the restaurant tries to stay with the authentic stuff but make it real high quality.  I haven't tried everything on the menu yet but so far of the dishes I tried my favorites were: The Youkhue (this is like beef tartar) and most of the BBQ meats.The first two nights I was there it was relatively empty. But the last time I was there it was nearly packed and bumping!

4.0,9/28/2012,"Well, I guess I am the first one to add this place onto Yelp and to review it~! lolI came here on their soft opening. They don't officially ""Open"" till October 1st but they do serve dinner with a limited menu item (they had a wide variety though) The entrance to this restaurant reminds me of the entrance to 230 5th Ave Rooftop Bar (for those that have been there...) Upon entering through the revolving doors of an office building/skyscraper located at the entrance of Koreatown, you are greeted by a hostess (??) that will ask you if you have reservations or just walking in. I told that I don't have a reservation and just walking in for dinner and my party and I were escorted to the elevator to the 39th floor where this restaurant is located.After the elevator door opens, you see a small bar area with the main hostess stand to your right where you will be greeted by a hostess. She will then ask how many of us there are and ask whether we will have Korean BBQ or not (they have different tables for those that want Korean BBQ and those that are having entree items like Stew, Soup, Bibimbap, etc) Since we were having BBQ, we were seated in the BBQ table.After a couple of seconds, we were served water and our Korean waiter  introduced himself and attended us in a very FRIENDLY manner. His English wasn't perfect but he answered a lot of questions and trillion times better than the UNFRIENDLY ajoomas and server guys in other veteran Korean restaurants on 32nd StreetAfter browsing the limited menu we were given, we decided to order the Bossam as the appetizer, 2 orders of Marinated Galbi Ribs, and 1 order of Duck Breast. After a few minutes, our side dishes come out and they were most scrumptious and well-made side dishes I've ever seen. The side dish selections were not that wide but VERY decent and the portions were HUGE: Slices of Korean Pancakes, Perilla Leaves in Soy Sauce, Radish/Daikon Pickles, Cruncy Vinegary Turnips, and one of the BEST Freshly-made Kimchi I've ever eaten in Manhattan (think Muk Eun Ji's Kimchi). We were all also each given a Korean Cabbage/Raddish Salad which tthe waiter told us to reserve it to eat it with the meat. There was also a small plate containing ssamjang paste, Korean chili peppers, carrots, and dill pickles.The Bossam came out and it looked fantastic. Served with Fresh White Kimchi, Daikon Raddish Salad with Perilla Leaves, these looked amazing. For $26, they were WELL worth the cost. The waiter asked if we need rice with the Bossam Pork Belly and when I asked if they were extra and the waiter told us that it was free. The Bossam was very fatty and scrumptious. Although considered an appetizer, it was filling enough to be an entree on its own.Then the meat came out which our waiter delightfully cooked it for us at the table. . First was the Marinated Galbi Ribs which were marinated to perfection and melt in your mouth good. They went SO well with the Korean Cabbage/Raddish Salad that were given to us. The texture of the meat were just so incredible that every bite was heaven in my mouth. My Ecuadorian and Colombian friends were constantly giving the THUMBS UP for the meat and the food/service overall. The Duck Breast was not bad but was kind of bland or maybe Duck really isn't my thing...reminded me of Pork Chops or a Thicker Samgyubsal in terms of texture. The waiter asked us if we would like some wine but I declined since we were heading to a lounge afterwards. The atmosphere here sort of reminds me of revolving ""The View Lounge"" of Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square sans the revolving part with gorgeous wide views of the city views while you dine at your table. There are tables right near the windows but those are for customers that are NOT grilling. Although this is an upscale Korean restaurant, I love the fact that the prices are NOT pretentiously expensive and VERY reasonable in an excellent setting. Why dine at any other Korean restaurant on 32nd Street if the prices here are similar with better views, better service, better food, and better vibe? In addition, I like the fact that the table grill here doesn't give off fumes so you don't end up smelling like you had Korean BBQ on your clothes. Dress Code by the way is Smart CasualGAONNURI did a good job and probably will be my go-to restaurant when I want to Korean food in an upscale atmosphere. Good for dates but not for parents (if they're Korean that is...) Where are the managers by the way? Do they even exist? Oh yeah they do, but they're busy handing out and receiving business cards from customers instead of assisting and supporting their employees.
