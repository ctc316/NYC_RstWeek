4.0,3/24/2019,"Went here with some friends to grab a bite to eat for brunch on a Saturday. The restaurant was definitely full, but we were able to be seated upon arrival.As a table we started with the cucumber and date salad and the basket of pastries.The cucumber and date salad was very tasty and a pairing of flavors that I had never experienced before.I tried a few of the pastries and the chocolate croissants were to die for! So petite, but so delicious and rich--yum!For my main course I ordered the green beans and the lamb kefta. The green beans were very good--a bit overpriced--but they had great flavor nonetheless. The lamb was also very tasty and paired nicely with the yogurt.For dessert, we split the pot de creme and the madeleines. The madeleines were very average in my opinion, but the pot de creme was absolutely delicious--definitely a must order.I also induced in a couple of their espresso martinis here, which are divine.Overall, this place is a bit on the pricy side, but definitely does a great brunch. Service was friendly and attentive and food came out quickly. Definitely not a bad spot to check out if you're looking for an upscale brunch.",2,0,1,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",746,1843,225
4.0,3/24/2019,"Just your classical brunch spot without anything too crazy. We had a french toast, some sort of mushroom omelette, and a shakshuka. The seating is kind of cute, and you can definitely get Provencal vibes, but for brunch it's a pretty standard brunch menu without too much extra to offer.",0,0,0,Willy X.,"New York, NY",873,222,74
5.0,3/9/2019,"My wife and I had dinner at Claudette last night and had our best dining experience in some time. It's rare for a restaurant to impress in all the important categories from food quality, to excellent bar, good service, and warm friendly atmosphere. It was just the right amount of fancy for us.We started with their speciality cocktail that had bourbon infused with clove and apple, and followed with a great Bordeaux. My wife convinced me to try the sardine appetizer and I was pleasantly surprised, as I'm not generally a fan. The lamb tagine was flavorful and tender. My wife ordered the vegetable tagine, which was too spicy for her and they took it back without so much as a raised eyebrow, and replaced with a hummus dish that she loved. Perhaps the best part was how the staff was friendly and efficient without being obsequious - it was almost like having dinner at a friends place - we will definitely return.",0,0,1,Jeff L.,"Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, NY",2,19,1

3.0,2/18/2019,"Very cute exterior and interior, but a bit pricey and the food was just alright - personally I really disliked my dish but the rest of my party had decent food.  The flatbread and hummus we started with was very tasty, and the server was kind enough to provide a crudite platter for my gluten-free friend. Unfortunately, that's where the enjoyment ended for me -I ordered the salmon and eggs special and found it much too salty and left the majority on the plate. I ended up having to eat everyone else's fries in order to recoup the caloric content needed for the meal. My boyfriend's BLT was pretty good, but my friend said her steak frites were nothing special. Service was also slow and subpar as coffees were not refilled until the very end of the meal and there was also no general check ins (otherwise I would've sent my entree back). Overall, I'd call Claudette the kind of place that's nice if you're looking for a cozy French vibe (French vibe extending to European style service if you know what I mean) and also going on someone else's tab.",3,0,0,Elaine Z.,"New York, NY",495,291,132
1.0,2/13/2019,"I wouldn't recommend this place for private events... I booked their Flamingo Room last Friday for my birthday event, and the overall experience was disappointing. I think the sub par service was the most frustrating part. 1). When we first arrived, the host at the front seemed to have a problem to take us the the space - she was very confused on what private event/space we were referring to when we told her booking under my name, the flamingo room the private event room etc until someone else came by to take us downstairs. Then we arrived the servers did not offer any drinks and continued to chat with each other behind the bar for at least 10 minutes until probably more than ten guests arrived. They did not offer drinks or assistance or anything before we sat down on the table and were socializing at the bar area. And with dinner starting, the female server was very unprofessional that when I asked her to offer newly arrived guests some drinks so we can raise glasses and start dinner, she walked away. 2). The service team that night and the booking team seem to have miscommunication. I told them a total of 22 people, where they only put 20 seats and the table was already too crowded and did not fit. It was very uncomfortable for some of our guests who sit by the corners... The food portion was not nearly enough... It was $$65 pp for the food and 45 pp for the wine package, and paying for 22 people at $110 pp, the food was probably only enough for 15 people to have a satisfying dinner... so of course we had to order more food beyond what the private event package provided... Btw the cake plating fee was 110 dollars for a cake that my friend brought in, hot water was $5 per cup if I remembered correctly... The night ended up much higher than the min spend requirement, which I would totally be fine with if I had a great experience...Lastly about the space, it's a basement area with an entrance in the kitchen, so it was little weird walking in and downstairs through the kitchen. The space is pretty much what they presented in the brochure, but one thing is that the space is not very ""private"". it didn't have a solid door that could be closed but using a cloth type of ""separater"", and many times when servers come in and out of the room and the bar area, they do not close it completely sometime does not even close it. So the bright lights, loud noise and people walking around in the kitchen really affects the ambiance of the room... The whole night just feel very hectic and the guests cannot really enjoy at ease.",1,0,1,Noño Z.,"New York, NY",164,109,169
4.0,2/9/2019,"Came here on a Friday night around 7:30 pm for dinner with a friend. There wasn't any table seating available but we found two spots at the bar. We started out with cocktails and wine then ordered the Roasted Cauliflower, Charred Halloumi, Sweet Potato Falafel and Pommes Frites. The Charred Halloumi was SOO good, it was seasoned with an apple chutney and pistachios. The cauliflower was also really well made. The ambiance of the restaurant was very cute with rustic decor and a marble bar, the crowd ranged from older patrons to NYU students; everyone seemed to be enjoying their drinks, food and company.

2.0,2/4/2019,"Recently went here for brunch and was underwhelmed. Great ambience - it's a very cute French cafe, but the food was less than average and quite pricey. The kale salad in particular was inedible. The soft cheese just didn't go with the kale and half of the kale had been fried. The textures just didn't work together. Scrambled eggs were good, but hard to mess that up.",0,0,0,Tom R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0
3.0,1/31/2019,We had 7:30 reservations for dinner during Restaurant Week. We waited 30 minutes for a table. Staff did periodically update us on status of table. When we were seated 30 minutes late we were told by manager thank you for waiting and don't worry we will take care of you. I'm not sure what this meant but we were not taken care of in any way. Not even our hummus was comped. Three of us ordered soup for a first course and it came to the table cold not lukewarm cold. And we had to ask for spoons. We were beyond disappointed. I will say the soup although cold was tasty but it should have been served hot.,0,0,0,Stephanie S.,"Astoria, NY",11,2,0
4.0,1/25/2019,"I'd go back to Claudette for the food, not the service. To begin, my party of three was wedged into a corner, seated at a small table, which was not very comfortable. We are all friends, so it wasn't a big deal, but if you're looking for privacy or space this probably isn't the place for you. Maybe due to the placement of our table (maybe not), our server didn't check on us often. We were usually trying to flag him down to order more drinks and even place a food order. He was friendly enough, but I would've liked to see him more than three times in 90 minutes. Food-wise, I'd recommend the pork chop (delicious!), the salmon, and the burrata. Portions were generous, too, which I appreciated. Reservations recommended, this place is tiny.",0,0,0,Allison M.,"San Francisco, CA",95,87,7

5.0,12/15/2018,"When France meets Morocco;When the sea meets the land.We had beet salad for appetizer. The beets tastes really well after roasting, mixing with honey mustard and paring with cheese. The salad also has green apples, almonds, Parmesan cheese and lettuce, a nice balance of taste and crunch.The salmon had a nice dill smell when it came to our table. Perfectly cooked (aka: crispy skin and tender inside). It is so creative and so Moroccan that the salmon came with cucumber, dates, walnut and mint. I actually liked it.The lamb Tagine. Can a lamb dish go wrong in a Moroccan restaurant? The meat could be deboned easily and did not have the ""lamb flavor"" which many people don't like.

The Marche de Provence with housemade ricotta is delicious, as is the gazpacho, Grilled Shiitake Mushrooms, and Grilled Local Squid. This isn't the kind of restaurant that's going to take Paris by storm and rake in the Michelin stars. It's more like the quiet bistros you'd find in France's smaller cities and larger towns.

The first and last thing I noticed was ambiance which is warm, light, and welcoming, highlighted by decor that encompasses the french/Moroccan theme of the menu. On top of this, my dinner was absolutely delicious. I got the salmon which was perfectly cooked and deliciously served with green sauce, veggies, and walnuts which I found to be a really creative and interesting touch. The tagines are so well seasoned and also taste amazing. My friend and I started with truffle hummus. I definitely recommend it.

5.0,10/30/2018,"Was brought here for a drink post shenanigans and we tried some of the eats too. The place is quaint and beautifully decorated.  Great spot to get together with some friends and good fare. It was really warm on the interior,  and though today was chilly, we decided to sit outside because the sun was out and we were initially hot from walking. We got a few looks by mischievous/curious folks passing by. We were lucky enough to enjoy happy hour:I tried the Ricard Spritz which was unique and tasty.  Flavors of anise and peach roamed the glass. My friend had the Morrocaine. Both drinks were great!Shortly after ordering the hors d'oeuvres came out and we shared pommes frites (french fries) which came with a smokey orange-colored dip.The fries seemed to have some autumnal flavors attached. Reminded me of pumpkin or a squash. The sweet potato falafel is a small plate but that's because it doesn't need to be larger. The two pieces satisfy.  It comes with harissa, greens, and jalapeño slices. It's quite spicy on it's own.  If you want to dim it down, I tasted a piece with a small dollop of the truffle hummus on top. Perfect combination of flavors! Definitely go for it!Post noshing and drinks, my friend ordered a glass of wine for added warmth as it began to get chillier. She had something with a G, don't recall the type. She loved that too. Our server Kelsey was amazing! She was wonderful with recommending flavors and foods and explained that the pêche de la crème doesn't have any dairy inside it for my dieting needs. The prices here are a bit on the high end, so expect to spend at least  $33pp not including tip if ordering drinks and eats. I have yet to venture into their restrooms, to describe the cleanliness and coolness of them.  Perhaps I'll update this review after the next tim I visit. Overall, it's a great spot.

The winner was definitely the apps. Drinks were good. Service was kind and attentive. It's got a cute decor and a nice outdoor seating. Would be a fine place for outdoor brunch.

While the truffle hummus was good, unfortunately it didn't take one bit like truffle. I still enjoyed it though! I can't wait to come back here soon.

The lamb was amazingly tender, salmon had a nice crispy skin and mint based purée, the chicken was very succulent, and the sea bass was delicious! This is definitely a treat your self, splurge type of restaurant, but they do use great flavors that you wouldn't usually get elsewhere. Even the fries had some Moroccan spices on it.

2.0,8/16/2018,"I want to like Claudette, I really do.  But, this just isn't the case. It is a beautiful restaurant, and a lovely atmosphere, but quite simply it falls short.  And with a hefty price tag.  Who:  Two Single, NYC gals, old friends meeting up for a long overdue six month hiatus.  When: Wednesday Night, 6:00 PM I had an appointment around the corner, thus the choice in venue and the grandma time slot. I said, ""Dinner for two"".  The hostess then proceeded to take me outside (it was a fairly warm summer evening), at which point I said, ""Do you have anything on the inside?""  She then immediately snapped ""No. Not without reservations, unless you want to wait till 7:30.""  What I wanted to say, was, ""We will be out of your hair by 7:30 lady.""  But I didn't, I just smiled and said, ""No problem.""  What:Wine by the glass $15.00 NYC prices and a decent size pour, but buyer beware.  It does add up. We ordered apps to share, because isn't that what most women do when drinking?  We shared the burrata, which was unusually hard?  I didn't know burrata could be like jello, until this experience. The bread, which added more insult to injury was burnt. Toasted bread of any kind is lovely, but blackened burnt bread, just isn't delicious no matter how much burrata you attempt to smother it with, or olive oil.  (PS who doesn't love burrata) The chicken mousse. This was beyond my better judgement, but my friend had suggested it, so I said sure.  Don't order it.  Spare yourself the questioning of ""What is this?"" Topping it off with more burnt bread, and $15.00 wine to wash it down with. Lamb Kefta.  This attempted to be good, except felt like ground lamb under cooked on a stick, and a lovely salad with some nice yogurt sauce and veggies underneath. Service: Eh, I have had better, and well, I have had worse.  She genuinely could have cared less.  If one us had begun to choke, I think she might have been forced, to actually raise an eyebrow.  And while she did make a 20% tip, she probably thought as I did leaving, 'See ya... Never' ...Recap: While the yelp reviews all scream Claudette's praises, I dined here about five years ago, and left again, feeling the same, as I did previously, underwhelmed, and that I had over paid.",0,0,0,Elizabeth P.,"Manhattan, NY",88,11,0

5.0,7/3/2018,"Fantastic restaurant. Moroccan-French fusion, very interesting concept and perfectly executed.We started with the labneh special which was to die for. Labneh mixed with tons of spices and topped with toasted nuts. Served with ""flatbread"" (roti). The flatbread was hot out of the oven and delicious on its own. They refill your flatbread basket for free!We then split the lamb kefta and sirloin steak au poivre. Both did not disappoint. You get three relatively small skewers with the kefta, but they were very flavorful. The steak was amazing. Always impressive to see a huge chunk of meat cooked a perfect medium-rare all the way through. The pepper is baked onto the surface of the steak as opposed to a sauce. The potatoes were wonderfully crispy since they sort of flatten the fingerling potatoes into thick chips. The olives gave the dish an interesting twist.The wine list is extensive though with limited by-the-glass options. We each ordered a glass of chablis. The only negative about the whole experience was that they didn't pour our wine at the table!

1.0,6/27/2018,"It's a shame because the restaurant, food, atmosphere and outdoor seating are lovely. On the website they are advertising ""L'apero"" Happy Hour from 3-6 p.m. I was taking my family out for cocktails and hor's douvres and thought this would be very nice. We were a party of eight. We arrived at 5:00 p.m. The place was quiet. They clearly did not want to bother with a big group. It took over 20 minutes  to get some food and cocktails. At 5:30 they whisked our happy hour menus away and said the menus change over to the regular dinner menu at 5:30. When I questioned the manager he said the food specials are until 5:30 only. That's not what they are advertising on the website. He also told us we needed to vacate by 7:00 for a reserved party. Forget trying to get a second round of drinks for the happy hour price. The mostly rude staff seems to ignore you. At 5:45 we received our second round only after I had to get angry. They ignore you so by the time they come around it's after 6:00 and they can charge the regular drink price. Very sketchy and dishonorable.

4.0,6/8/2018,"Went here for my birthday dinner with my SO, and we had a great time. This was one of the first times both me and my partner have eaten French-Morrocan cuisine, so Claudette was a treat for us. We ordered:- Burnt Eggplant Provenc'ail, a cold small appetizer with tomato, served with housemade flatbread- Morrocan Carrots, marinated in traditional morrocan spices, served cold with pistachios - Pan Roasted Aurora Salmon ($29), with cucumber, dates, horseradish, walnuts, and dill- Roasted Sasso Chicken ($27) with summer squash and zucchini- Chocolate Crémeux ($12), a flourless chocolate cake, hazelnuts, caramel, vanilla ice cream- Brown Butter Madeleines ($8), with caramelOur waiter was very knowledgeable, friendly, and accommodating throughout the night. My two favorites from the night were the carrots and the salmon, the two dishes that I was initially most excited about. To be honest, I was surprised upon the first bite to see that the carrots were cold, as they were slow roasted with a delicate consistency, but after I adjusted my expectations, I was blown away. The combination of the harissa and honey infused into the carrot impressed me.The salmon was also phenomenal, with a perfectly crispy skin and a medium-cooked filet void of any fishy flavor. The sweetness of the dates and the fattiness of the walnuts paired well with salmon, under a bed of a few cucumbers and (what I assume to be) a dill, cucumber puree.My SO's dishes, on the other hand, I was less impressed by. The chicken (for me) was nearly sickeningly fried and not as juicy as expected, and the burnt eggplant flatbread was good, but not incredibly exciting. My partner, on the other hand, loved their two choices (but agreed that the chicken was the slightest bit dry). So, as with anything, to each their own. The Chocolate Crémeux is much more like a thick mousse than a flourless cake, but still delicious, and the Brown Butter Madeleines, if you're looking for something delectably doughy and fluffy, are an apt choice. We made our reservations on OpenTable, and since I put in my birthday, they gave the Brown Butter Madeleines complimentary with a candle, which I thought was a very nice touch.",1,0,0,Ryanne B.,"Jamesburg, NJ",0,6,8

4.0,4/2/2018,"Went to Claudette for Easter Brunch and here are some highlights: Intro: Breaking down the review as follows: Ambiance: Claudette's decor is so shabby chic! I love all the white and pastel colors throughout the restaurant. Now that it's Spring, they have some pretty cherry blossoms all around that makes the decor even more beautiful!Service:  Service was a little lack-luster. Granted, it was Easter and it was really busy so I'm a little more forgiving. Luckily our waiter had help and there was a really nice man who helped us sort out our check because our waiter never came back. Food/Drinks: They had a Brunch Special for $40 and you can choose between an appetizer and main course or a main course and dessert. I chose the latter.I had the Duck Papardelle Pasta dish and it was very tasty. For dessert, I had the freshly baked Madeline cookies. They were so yummy!!Summary: Overall, I would still give Claudette 4-stars mainly because they accommodated us when I had to change my reservation and added people and they seated us even though they had a policy of not seating unless all parties are there.

3.0,1/19/2018,"3.5 stars if I could give half stars. Honestly, the food was REALLY good. Service? Mediocre at best.Food first. Our groups did not order appetizers but went ahead with the mains. There were no main course specials which I did find to be a bit odd. The special was pertaining to dessert. Charcoal grilled Bass - This was the dish I ordered. The fish was cooked to perfection and came with two potato latkes which were also divine. Be aware that the fish comes out fully boned and all so be careful when eating because I definitely had to finesse my way through the bones. The sauce that came with the dish was also great. It was a lemon aioli with a tang (addition of capers) to it. Perfect with the grilled bass. One problem was that this dish took 1 hour to cook which also delays the rest of the main courses if you are with a group.(They fail to mention this, by the way)Other dishes ordered by the group:Lamb tagine - I personally am not a fan of lamb but the cous cous was so good and the lamb itself seemed to be flavored very well. My friends loved this dish.Bouillabaisse - Did not personally taste this dish but my friends commented that a couple of the mussels did not taste fresh and still had a very fishy taste, almost spoilt. This dish had to be sent back. Special of the day (chocolate cake basically) - Really good. Simply a layered chocolate cake with high ratio of mousse to cake. Chocolate mousse dish listed on menu - Essentially the same as the special with hazelnuts. Again really good since I am a huge chocolate fan. SERVICE- Now here is what dropped this rating by 1.5 stars. Firstly, the waiter failed to mention that the bass dish would take an hour to make which would affect the timing of the other main courses. Generally, restaurants would warn you before that happens and would give you the option to wait as a table or to have courses come out separately. This did not happen.Secondly, our waiter changed throughout the meal without giving notice. This was odd because our original waiter did come back at the end of the meal to collect the check. Not sure where he was during the duration of the meal. Thirdly, the specials description. I was very intrigued by the description of the special (the dessert). However, upon hearing the first explanation of the dessert in the beginning of the meal and the second explanation given before we ordered dessert, the description of the special changed drastically. I literally had to repeatedly ask a third time what the special actually was. It concerns me that no one actually could give an accurate description of one dessert. Did the dessert (essentially a piece of chocolate cake) go through some transformation from the time of the first and second explanation?  This incompetency was just icing on the cake...Overall, great food, but service troubles would not have me coming back.",0,0,0,Tiffany Z.,"New York, NY",0,33,4
3.0,1/18/2018,"3.5 stars. Some dishes were great, atmosphere was lovely, but there were a couple of major service issues (even though the servers themselves were very friendly).Atmosphere: A bit of an older crowd, calm, sophisticated. Dimly lit (a little too dim. No one at my table could read their menus.) Nice bar in one corner. Well decorated. Food: - Lamb Tagine: SO good. A ton of really tender, well flavored meat. The couscous was also delicious - perfectly cooked, and came in a hearty sauce with berries. - Charcoal Grilled Whole Black Bass: Also just fantastic. The fish was well seasoned and so moist. Only thing to keep in mind is that it takes an hour to make.- Bouillabaisse: Decent tomato stock, but some of the seafood was not fresh and it was making the entire dish taste way too fishy. The mussels in particular tasted really fishy. Had to ask them to take the dish back.- Chocolate Crémeux: It's described as a chocolate flourless cake, but it's honestly just a pudding/pot de creme type dessert.Service: All the servers were very friendly, but a couple of major issues. The bass dish took 1 hour to cook. They didn't let us know that ahead of time, so that we could maybe order appetizers. They didn't once in that hour come to check on us. We were seriously starving and had no idea why the food wasn't coming. They only alerted us to it once we asked them, and they didn't even offer to bring something else out to tide us over or to show us a menu again.

The interior was also nicely decorated for the holidays in early December. We ordered le pain tunisien which came with hummmus and the hummus was so good! I usually don't like hummus (I'll eat it but won't really go out of my way to get it), but from some recommendations, I decided to get this dish and was very pleased. We also got the sweet potato falafel but unfortunately it was too spicy for my liking. From some side conversation, I heard that they do have private party seating space downstairs so this is a good option to look into for any special events you might be having. For my main dish I got the grilled branzino and while the fish and sauce were delicious and complimented each other very well, I was disappointed that a grain didn't come with the dish. After eating the fish and the tomatoes and sauce, I was still very hungry and wish there was something to pair with the fish like rice or bread or even potatoes. Someone from my table got the crispy hake sandwich and that came with a bun and fries. I wish there was just something more with the branzino. Overall it was a positive experience but I'd have to give it a 3.5-4. It quite pricey for the dishes and probably overpriced for that matter.

It was so warm and pillowy and flavorful and I wanted to take it home and snuggle with it. But I didn't. I ate it all. Because I had no other choice.Add a great wine list and classy music to the mix and Claudette becomes the kind of girl you want to take your parents to meet. Everyone who works there knows it, too.

The chickpea salad was okay - pretty plain but nice and fresh, my favorite part was the crunchy toasted chickpeas they had as garnish. The sweet potato falafel had really nice texture and flavor, the harissa and chili are VERY spicy. The shitake mushroom was the standout! You get 3 perfectly grilled mushrooms which had so much flavor, dipped in the tasty accompanying hummus it was perfection. - Shakshouka: pretty good shakshouka and eggs are the perfect level of runny. The pita-like bread it comes with is really good.- Coffee is not that great, standard restaurant coffee.Decor & Service:- Decor: I don't know what's the right way to describe it that's not culturally insensitive, but I got a French Provencal/Mediterranean vibe.

5.0,11/5/2017,"I came here after attending the Halloween parade. Now this might have become my favorite place to go to. It was great service and extremely well decorated. So we ordered a wine and a couple of starters. The chicken liver mousse was excellent to say the least. We also had the sweet potato falafel that comes with this red sauce/ chutney/ dip. Absolutely scrumptious!! What complimenting flavors. The sauce brings out the falafel flavors just right. The third appetizer was the grilled portobello mushrooms. Again, an absolute hit. After splurging on appetizers we shared two enters among three of us. The lamb tagine is delicious and full of enriching spices. It. Ones with a gigantic piece of lamb shank. Yum. The pork chop is also pretty tasty however the potato whatever it came with (in a cue little skillet) wasn't that great (for us). Now we are dessert people so we also went for the ice cream/ sorbet and chocolate crémeux. DELICIOUS! Trying to go back for Thanksgiving for their Prix fixe. Hopefully we get in.

The cocktail list is adorably French, as is the floral decor, and everything is on theme including the service which is at a much slower pace than I'm used to in New York.

4.0,9/21/2017,"Claudette is a beautiful example of a neighborhood place to go that draws on good food and even better ambience. It's easily filled with large or small groups and the volume can get very loud. Tables are close together here as well. The interior is decorated in a light wood with a farm to table feeling. Candle and plants and beautiful large flower arrangements add to that. They have a small counter that's even used to serve dinner. Dining outside is probably a nice idea when the weather is good for people watching as they sit on a busy corner but the street noise is loud. Menu here is quite simple but has a good selection of everything. There are a few appetizers and cheese selections that you can order one, three or five of for a lighter meal. It's portions are small in my estimation so you should really be feeling like eating light. One of the entrees we had was salmon with a gazpacho base. It was cooked perfectly with a crunchy skin. The flowerless chocolate cake was light and served with a really good ice cream. Again, small size. Wine and drink selections all great as well.

The grilled mushrooms are served on top of hummus and pistachios- also yummy. For the main course we had salmon and eggs and tuna salad.

We were given menus but none of the wait staff bothered to come by to even offer us water. We saw another couple came in, sat down, and was greeted by one of the waitress right away, and were given water. Not sure why we were discriminated against, as we were both dressed professionally and carried ourselves as such. More than one wait staff made eye contact with us, it was obvious that we were waiting for them, but they all just decided to ignore us. After sitting there for 15 minutes, we left. We told the hostess what happened, and she was nice enough to apologize. The four or five wait staff were just standing there chatting-- I guess they were too busy to serve us. About 15 minutes after we left, I got a notification that the restaurant ""Cancelled"" our reservation on OpenTable.

5.0,6/19/2017,"One of Washington Square favorites. Had dinner both inside and outside. Definitely like both and would choose depending on weather/mood.The setting is shabby chic romantic. The style reflects its cuisine, which is provençal as someone else noted here. Perfect for dates, parents, special occasions, GNO.Me and my bf usually share three of the Marche de Provence appetizers (3 for $24), one main and one dessert. You may want to throw in a side or two if you are really hungry.So far I have tried:- Bacalao Tartine ($10): Amazing. Three toasts with generous topping. Pairs very well with the gazpacho.- Tomato Almond Gazpacho soup ($10): Super tasty, comes with lots of crunchy almonds and a fair amount of croutons (I hate when they fill my plate with croutons. I'm not paying to get stuffed with bread! Fortunately, didn't get that here.).- Cucumber and tomato salad ($10): love all the herbs it comes with and pumpkin seeds, very refreshing. Be warned it is small.- Sasso Chicken ($27): Half chicken, juicy, healthy. Comes with roasted veggies and delicious croutons (ok, they are allowed to put croutons as long as they are as tasty as these ones!)- Bouillabaise ($35): a dish full of everything good the sea has to offer - mussels, shrimps, squid. Topped with veggies and tomato broth. A must if it is a cold evening.- Ile flottante ($10): vanilla crème anglaise, caramel and hazelnut praline. Made to perfection. It is light but filling.- Ice Cream & Sorbet ($9): had vanilla, yogurt, cassis. Perfect trio.- Wine: Royal Heritage Le Prince 2009. Medium body. Paired perfectly with Chicken. I remember the first time I came here, they had the wrong vintage number in the wine menu. We found out when they brought the bottle and it was a different year than what we had ordered (and arguably should be different price?). They apologized, offered to choose another bottle instead and gave as an extra dessert  We left with very full tummies that night.

The tables are quite close to each other and at dinner time it can be quite noisy and stuffy inside. The service was haphazard and we went to great efforts at certain points to get attention from the servers or to point out things they had forgotten. I think they had good intentions but lack of training and experience for a place this busy and pricey. The food was average but lacked a level of refinement I would expect at this price point.

We were seated about 30 minutes later than our reservation because an elderly group took their sweet time. A bit out of Claudette's hands so won't penalize them for it. I ordered the lamb burger and it was quite good. Their toppings complemented the lamb nicely, with a cumin mayo of some sort, tomatoes and pickled onions. The pickled onions were a pleasant surprise. The lamb was tender. I think my main critique I have is that the meat patty should fit the bun better. I got a lot of just pure bread bites which is a huge pet peeve of mine. The burger came with well-seasoned fries that were crisp and accompanied by the same mayo in the burger.I also had a small bite of their braised oxtail pasta dish and that was super delicious. Pasta was perfectly al-dente with a good tomato sauce and big pieces of oxtail.At the end of the meal, we got some complimentary madelines, perhaps for the wait and those were delicious.

Every bite had a different taste.  The selection of cheeses were quite good as well (we didn't get the blue cheese since I'm not a fan).For entrees I got the steak frites and my boyfriend got the lamb.  Both were very spiced with what tasted like Indian flavors, but was not over powering of the dish.  I ordered my steak medium rare and it came out a bit more on the medium side, but I was over all pleased.As for desert, we shared the chocolate cake, which turned out to be gluten free (plus +1 since my boyfriend has a gluten allergy).Overall we had a lovely meal for a decent price, and we will be back, especially since it's close by.",2,2,1,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634

4.0,9/29/2016,"KenScale: 8.0/10With a mind-blowingly large number of restaurants in NYC, it is not quite easy to re-visit a restaurant unless there was something that makes me go back on my first visit. I haven't had a chance to make a second visit to the charming Provencal bistro Claudette in Greenwich Village largely because there were other restaurants ahead of the list and also while the food at Claudette was over delicious, there weren't enough factors that made me think of this restaurant again other than the charming vibe. When a couple that I frequently dine out with said they haven't tried this place, I took that as an opportunity to see how the kitchen has evolved over time since its opening in 2014, when the restaurant was one of the harder tables to secure. The menu format at Claudette hasn't changed much, consisting of some light vegetables, cheese and meat plates, appetizers and large dishes. I do recommend getting a couple of fresh vegetable dishes to start the meal here, such as the roasted beets with walnuts and watermelon radishes or cauliflower with cherry tomatoes and coriander. By now, I've had countless octopus dishes in the city, but the charred octopus with chickpeas, harissa and parsley is one of the better ones with very nice balance of flavor and texture. The main dishes that we ordered were all successful as well. Rabbit cavatelli with black olive rabbit ragu, guanciale and smoked onion had the rustic touch that I very much enjoyed, and black angus rib-eye was also juicy and tender while working quite harmoniously with roasted potatoes and scallions on the side without too much seasoning that could've undermined the texture of the meat. Grilled branzino was also fantastic in its simple form without too much salt. All of the main dishes were better than the ones that I had had last time (chicken tagine and bouillabaisse), and really showcased the light yet soulful personality of the food of southern France. For dessert, stick with French classics and order the decadent ile flottante with vanilla crème anglaise, caramel and hazelnuts praline.Getting a reservation at Claudette is now easier than when the restaurant first opened, but the restaurant was still relatively packed on a Tuesday night. Sometimes, the magic of first-time visit isn't quite there at a restaurant that I re-visit, but I would say Claudette is an exception. I was overall pretty pleased with the Provencal fare at the restaurant, even more so than my previous visit.",4,0,0,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

I had the Moroccan duck leg sandwich as my entree and the meat was perfectly done. Juicy and tender - I was most pleased!! Highly recommend the dish. For dessert I had a custard praline with vanilla cream (unfortunately I don't remember exactly what it's called) - the dish was balanced and absolutely delicious. Again I highly recommend it but I suggest sharing it - it's quite a lot to have for one person and counters the fact that it was a light dessert dish. Service: Good service (as you would expect at a top restaurant) but it was quite slow at times which was odd given how empty it was. Price: Quite pricey - if you're looking for a deal, this is not it. Two of us spent ~$75 for an entree, OJ and a shared dessert. Overall: Quieter posh spot with excellent food.

Dimly lit, and it has an interesting decor with a homey feel thanks to the bookshelves on the walls. But Claudette's charms seem to end here, and don't really extend to the food.We ended up going for a bunch of small plates instead of the mains, and here is the verdict:1. Cauliflower - the gingery twist was interesting, but wasn't enough to save it from being bland2. Cucumber, dates and leeks - below average...it was just a bunch of ingredients thrown together without any dressing or thought (and only a few slivers of dates)3. Roasted beets - good, the candied walnuts gave a nice crunch 4. Asparagus with labneh - good quality ingredients, and the labneh was good too5. Truffle hummus - best part of the meal....we ended up ordering 3 of these. BUT it was only partly because it was really good, and more because the portion was audaciously tiny for $16 (all of 3 spoons)6. Pistounade - this spread was good too, but the same deal with the portion as the hummus7. Flourless chocolate cake - the cake was rich and decadent like it should beThe wine list is also a bit limited - they have a long list, but they are clustered together with regard to flavor profiles (light to medium bodied)Good place to try once, but not sure if I'll make it a point to come back.",1,0,0,Sargam M.,"Manhattan, NY",81,163,0

5.0,7/15/2016,"I can't begin to describe how much flavor was in every bite I took. Just to clarify, this was for a private event - so I had about 3 options to choose for each course.I started off with the basic hummus and flatbread that was given to use without requesting... BEST HUMMUS I've ever had at any NYC eatery. I couldn't stop eating it. The texture was nice and creamy, and it was packed with so much flavor (hints of garlic that gave it a nice flare).Moved onto the tuna nicoise for my appetizer, which I'd recommend to anyone. I thought I wasn't much of a tuna fan, but decided to give it a try since it was one of the most raved about things. I definitely see why: the searing on it is perfect, leaving the inside tender and juicy - no fishy taste AT ALL. They also give you enough pieces for the dish, leaving me more than satisfied with it. It also comes with a potato cake that blended perfectly with the tuna. I chose the pan seared aurora salmon for my entree and was a bit disappointed that there was not a real side to accompany it; however, the seasoning (I tasted pepper and hints of garlic) made up for it. There was a ring of pea puree around the plate that was a tad necessary, but did make it look cute. I tried their version of a Beignet for dessert, which was filled with nutella and topped with a glorious amount of sugar. This was accompanied by a caramel dressing that was on the side in a little cup. Definitely tasty, sweet and filling; however, I could have done without it, as I'm not much of a dough girl. The wine selections are beautiful and the atmosphere is even better.This is definitely my new favorite place, when I'm craving that fantastic hummus and an overall quaint experience with guaranteed flavorful food.",0,0,1,Amanda T.,"Manhattan, NY",128,22,2
5.0,7/13/2016,"New favorite brunch place. And I don't even like brunch. My personal philosophy is that Sunday is a day of rest and thus I shall not be roused to entertain company of any kind. However, my Manchild Lover's father happened to be in town, and being a true lady I arranged brunch for a party of three in spite of my personal inclinations. I showed up at Claudette on the dot and the Manchild and his father were nowhere to be found (of course). I took a seat at the bar, where a very nice gentleman immediately saw through the situation and pushed a glass of water toward me. Bless his soul.At last, the dynamic duo arrived and we were seated at a round table in the middle of the dinning room. I was momentarily transported to a roadside restaurant in Provence. Oh, how I miss the sunny French countryside, with rows and rows of olive trees and idyllic blooms dancing in the mistral wind. If only the scaffolding at the entrance wasn't there, because Claudette had to be one of the nicest settings I have found myself in for brunch. Speaking of food...- Truffle hummus: came with pita bread, served hot. One of the best hummus I've had- Wild mushroom omelette: garlic and herb sautèed mushrooms, goat cheese. Mushrooms were juicy and very flavorful. - Lamb sandwich: special on the menu that day. Toasted bread with stewed lamb. Very yummy.

It even radiates that broader ""je ne sais quoi"" feeling that great restaurants give off. At least, it radiated that feeling until the actual food hit my mouth.I had the Tuna Nicoise at brunch yesterday. It was a paradox, in that how could something so over-salted be so vanilla? (I will admit that I ate it all. But not because it was good - I ate it all because it was like 25-30 bucks, and I wanted to be able to look myself in the mirror at the end of the day.) In that way, Claudette reminded me of Megan Fox. Megan, as you all know, looks the part. Star actress. A-list. Magazine covers. All that. At least, she looks the part until the moment she opens her mouth and starts ""acting"". Ok, I'm being a little mean here. Claudette wasn't as bad of a restaurant as Megan Fox is an actress.

Even with scaffolding blocking the sidewalk tables, it's a charming little restaurant that makes you feel as if you were in a Parisian cottage inside.First things first: make a reservation. Claudette is always bursting at the seams, no matter what time of day you go. Secondly, if you're there for lunch, order the pre-fixe (for only $25!) so you can try as many of their delicious offerings as possible.Claudette's food is definitely pricey, but simple and delicious. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's one of my favorites in NYC, but the excellent service and cute ambiance definitely lend to reasons to come back. Again, I would recommend getting the pre-fixe to add a little bulk to your meal, and of course, have dessert. On a recent weekday, I tried:+ cold sweet pea soup with creme fraiche: I'm not a huge fan of chilled soups, but this was amazing. Really flavorful and refreshing on a warm spring day. It comes with a huge cheese stick which was good, but you definitely didn't need it to complete the meal.+ chicken paillard: this was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. The chicken was covered in a chipotle gremolata which packed a punch, topped with quinoa and arugula.+ meringue with vanilla creme anglaise: I forget the actual name of this dessert, but it was definitely my favorite part of the meal. The meringue was so light and fluffy, which was a great contrast to the heavy creme anglaise. It also had these delicious pieces of brittle floating around. Overall, great mixture of textures and flavors.I also shared a bit of the star anise creme brûlée, which was just OK; the sugar was a little bit too burnt, which destroyed the taste of the star anise for me.Definitely a place to impress!

1.0,4/4/2016,"Like automaton waitstaff and overpriced, mediocre food? Then this place is for you. It's just another example of how more and more New York is becoming a crappy joke, catering to rich, classless tourists who, like stupid sheep, will accept - and welcome - ridiculously priced goods and services as an earmark of quality. NYC real estate is a fortune and customers must pay for it. Thanks for that legacy, Bloomberg. Anyway, I went to Claudette the other night with a friend after reading so many good reviews about it. The first thing I noticed was the annoying vestibule, with curtains literally whipping you upon entering. There was a beehive of activity, as at least 8 busboys and waitstaff formed a clump near the host's table, all ready to either trip you up or bang into each other. This type of unnecessary frenetic energy is usually not a good sign and is often symptomatic of 'too many cooks in the kitchen'. The waitress seemed sweet, but like the restaurant, pretty lackluster, and asking her for recommendations was like pulling teeth. The $13-16 by-the-glass wine list is relatively short on variety. Probably so that you'll purchase a bottle from the overblown-priced, yet more extensive list instead. The octopus starter we shared contained 2 pathetic pieces of charred octopus swimming in a blow-your-head-off SPICY tomato-y sauce with chickpeas. It's one of the worst octopus dishes I've ever had. Seriously, the waitress should have said something about the spice factor when we ordered the dish. Next, the mint salad at $14 is a big boring rip-off - a plate piled high with mainly arugula and quinoa that came off like mustard seeds left in between your teeth. Several small slices of pear and slivers of red onion dotted the dish, but the whole thing was totally overwhelmed by the taste of mint. Not good. My companion ate two forkfuls and called it a day. At this point we walked outside to get some air. The restaurant, though small and quaint was warm and stuffy. We were gone about 10 min and when we returned, our dirty appetizer plates were still on the table! Totally unacceptable, especially with the amount of staff buzzing around. And as for the staff, they are expressionless zombies who don't smile or speak. They just plop your food on the table and run away. It was both hilarious, yet chilling watching them deliver the tagine towers like robots. But the more I observed this detached service, the sadder I got and the more I disliked Claudette. Later, my companion and I concluded that this horrible attitude witnessed en masse in the waitstaff can only originate with the owner or is being imparted by the phony maître d'. Honestly, this was a major turn-off. For the mains, we ordered the bouillabaisse and Bronzino. At $32, the two pieces of fish come with NOTHING on the side but a piece of lemon. That's it! While the $34 bouillabaisse was tasty, it contained more broth than fish. It would have been nice to dunk a few slices of bread into the broth - more than the two thin pieces of toasted French bread that accompanied the dish. But as we realized, we never received bread when we were first seated. Two mussels, two prawn heads, some cut up pieces of shrimp, maybe a scallop and a small piece of cheap perch were swimming around. All served on a small soup plate - not your typical bowl. A nice way to skimp on portion, I guess. In the end, I give one star to the restaurant because the Madeleine dessert served with caramel dipping sauce was sublime.

We arrived on time; my friend beat me there and they sat her immediately, which I liked.  The restaurant is super cute - perfect for a girls night.  It's very open and fairly small without being cramped.  The tables are evenly spaced so you don't feel like you're right on top of one another.  We were greeted by our server right away and we ordered appetizers and entrees.  Our server was friendly and was able to describe the dishes I asked about.  The food came out quickly.  My friend got the mint salad to start with, which was a straightforward bed of arugula with pear and quinoa.  It was exactly what you'd expect it to be.  I didn't think it was worth $14 but at least it was a reasonable portion.I started with the young potatoes in truffle vinegarette and shallots.  This was good overall although I didn't expect it to be cold.  It was a good portion size for $8.  The shallots were a little overwhelming.For the entrees, my friend and I both got the salmon with gnocchi.  It was served over mushrooms and fennel (with, again, lots of onions).  The mushrooms were great and flavorful.  The gnocchi were good but there were literally FOUR tiny pieces of it.  I asked for mine without peas but it was still served with a pea purée.  The piece of salmon was a nice size with a crunchy skin on top, but the fish itself seemed rather oily.  The dish was overall OK, although I was very disappointed at the lack of gnocchi.  For dessert, we split the chocolate valhrona cake.  This was served with ""charred cinnamon marshmallow, sweet harissa coulis chestnut honey sherbet, hazelnut allepo crumble"", while this dessert was reasonably sized and pretty good, it was essentially a good chocolate cake with relatively mild tasting gelato, crushed hazelnuts, and some melted marshmallow.  We enjoyed this but didn't necessarily feel like it fit the description.The bill came to ~$100 and we didn't even get drinks.  I felt like that was a bit expensive for what we consumed.  $56 for some potatoes, a piece of salmon, and half a piece of chocolate cake is a lot.  The food was good but it certainly wasn't one of my favorite places or anything.  I left satisfied but not super full.In conclusion, Claudette was alright.  It's a good place to have in your back pocket for a girls night.  It likely won't disappoint although it won't blow you away either.  I would consider coming back.",2,0,1,Jenn P.,"Manhattan, NY",285,134,933

4.0,2/15/2016,"Welcoming setting reminiscent of a French countryside farmhouse. Part of the Rosemary's and BoBo family, Claudette certainly delivers when it comes to food and service. Small bar followed by an open kitchen can be seen right when you enter.We recently visited during the NYC Restaurant Week. Plating and portion sizes seemed a bit limited, not sure if this was related to the restaurant week. Dishes were still delicious but there were a lot of negative space in the plates. Also the standard pricing on the dishes were slightly higher than expected.Cassoulet, Salmon and Bouillabaisse were our choices for mains with Tuna Crudo, Mint Salad and Baby Octopus for starters. Menu offered few other dishes to try at a future visit from sections including 'from the garden' and 'flat breads'. Wine list was small but had options for various budgets and tastes.Late dinner on a Friday night and the space was packed and vibrant.

4.0,2/14/2016,"The restaurant has a very cozy atmosphere and amazing wait staff.  Those two things were immediately noticeable as I walked in.  The dining area has a chic farmhouse feel which I love.We came here for dinner last week and while the food was good, what made the dinner stand out was the impeccable service.  Our waiter was attentive and catered to our every need, as were the servers and other wait staff who made sure our glasses were always filled.For appetizer, we had the grilled octopus which I thought was just ok; and the brussel sprouts with bacon which was pretty good (but then, what's doesn't taste good with bacon?)  I fared better with the main dish.  Though my initial reaction when I saw was disappointment (didn't look anything like the bouillabaisse pics I saw online; it wasn't encased in puff pastry); I was not disappointed with the dish.  The bouillabaisse was almost perfect except I found it a bit salty.  If it weren't for the saltiness, I would have said it was one of the best bouillabaisse I've ever had.  The soup was quite dense and you could taste the shell fish used in the fish stock.  There were mussels, fish, shrimp, and clams in the dish which made it quite tasty.  I sopped up the entire dish with the side of french bread (bread was amazing too).  My dining partner ordered the hanger steak, and I have to say it looked kinda sad compared to my bouillabaisse.  The steak came pre-sliced (I don't know why restaurants do that), and under-cooked.  Though I like my steak bloody, not everyone does and my friend specifically asked for her meat to be medium.  She sent back the steak (hey, you might as well enjoy a dish you're paying $30 for!) and they re-cooked it, but still arrived back a bit too red for her.  I think that was the only downside experience.  Though the serving staff was very gracious about it, the fact it still came back under-cooked was disappointing.We had to skip the dessert b/c we had stuffed ourselves w appetizers and main dishes.  The coffee was good though-- I could have drunk cups of it.  It was a great way to end a very nice meal.",0,0,1,gwen L.,"New York, NY",3,137,0
5.0,2/12/2016,"Went here for lunch during New York Restaurant Week. We were seated right by the colorful bookcase, but anywhere in this restaurant would have been good because they had the cutest decor. Our waiter was very attentive and nice. Apps, I had Grilled Montauk Squid which was tasty and the perfect portion size. The Squid was nicely seasoned and I liked the crunch of the chickpeas. My friend had the Za'atar Roasted Eggplant Soup which I had a spoon of and actually enjoyed it. Her soup had a thick consistency but kind of bland I liked the flavor of my app better.Entrees, I had the Claudette Cassoulet which was a smoked duck leg baked in sausage and beans which I absolutely loved. It was tender, savory and hearty. My friend had the Grilled Branzino which had the most beautiful presentation. She enjoyed her dish and I had a bite of it so I thought was light and fresh.Dessert, we shared the Crème Brûlée & Nougat Glacé. We ended on a good note with our desserts. The Crème Brûlée was always a good go-to French dessert, but the Nougat Glacé was so delicious and an interesting texture I really enjoyed. It reminded me of the filling of a napoleon cake.All in all, I had a great experience with amazing food so I would definitely recommend this place for a Ladies brunch or a date.",6,4,4,Kristine V.,"Manhattan, NY",301,65,240

4.0,1/29/2016,"Came here for Restaurant Week lunch and was impressed. It's a Provencal restaurant, so the dishes are different from what we think of as traditional French cuisine (think: French ingredients with a Greek/Tunisian/Moroccan twist in preparation). I was surprised but ended up enjoying the meal.In terms of the RW menu, the only thing I was not a huge fan of was the Za'atar Roasted Eggplant Soup. It was a bit too  heavily seasoned and came off a bit sour for me. I can see someone else with different tastes enjoying it though. The Claudette Cassoulet was good: tender and savory--an amazing piece of smoked duck baked in sausages and beans. The  Creme Brûlée with Star Anise was AMAZING. It's the best creme brûlée I've had outside of Paris and even my friend who's not a fan of anise enjoyed it (the anise flavor isn't overpowering).We also ordered the Le Pain Tunisien (truffle hummus with flatbread). Highly recommended. You can taste the truffle with every bite and it balances very well with the texture of hummus. Can't believe other places haven't through of this combination yet. For drinks, I had the St. Trop (citrus-y and a bit bubbly since it has a rosé base) and my friend had the Bloody Mary. He liked it so much he got two. I'm not a fan of Bloody Marys but after trying his I do agree they do them very well here. Decor is very French country--light and airy but cozy, with wicker chairs and a few plants here and there. There's a bar on the side too. Really great for daytime, but not sure how it would transition into dinner. Seems more like a place for a relaxing lunch rather than a romantic dinner date, but they do have the bar so I guess everything could look different with dimmed lights?

3.0,1/27/2016,"When reading reviews, I immediately discount any that begin with ""I went here on Valentine's Day and..."" or ""New Year's Eve was..."" so I don't have any business writing about a Restaurant Week visit. Or do I? The host and hostess were lovely and our waiter was very nice, and efficient, but the bartender had no idea what was what, talking all bull, and if by chance he was correctly making drinks on their specialty menu, they were terrible recipes. Wine list was appealing. Cassoulets were tiny which was good because they were dry and hard. Octopus had an odd sauce-- thick and sweet like when you're a teenager and cook spaghetti with tomato paste.  The room is OK looking and supposed to say Provence, although all that white is today too suggestive of 'shabby chic,' which we can do without. Music is pleasant and low (jazz, 1960s Laurel Canyon pop rock) but curtains don't help the sound level at Claudette because for some reason there is a din of jabbering, not helped by the screeching privileged dames on the banquette across. So yes, maybe RW is not a time to go anywhere, and the restaurant was certainly slammed, but we didn't get an idea it is important to visit Claudette again.",0,0,0,Dennis O.,"Manhattan, NY",0,29,0

A choice of 3 appetizers.  Carole and I both chose the grilled montauk squid.  Tender little squid rings, playing against firm chickpeas, and soft eggplant cubes. The seasoning takes you to morocco.  Little red peppers introduce sweet into the background. A very satisfying dish, not to be missed.She had the grilled branzino entree. It tasted like it had just been caught. Multi colored cherry tomatoes and a green sauce complimented the fish. Throw in the grilled lemon slices, and you've achieved a high end taste without compromising high end health. Since it was January, my choice was the cassoulet.  Fuel for the furnace! Flageolet beans flavored by their marriage to duck confit and pork sausage. We both chose the star anise creme brulee for dessert.  Creamy, not too sweet, with an anise edge.Was their room for improvement? Yes. The skin of the branzino should have been crisp.

5.0,1/20/2016,"Claudette is a Francophile's wet dream with its lighthearted Provençal fare, breezy decor and properly demure staff. I've been eyeing this Greenwich Village cafe for a while and, on a whim, we decided to reserve a 9:30pm dinner spot during restaurant week. We complemented the restaurant week menu with a few a la carte options. In stark contrast to the french eating philosophy, we outdid ourselves with the quantity of food and left with food bebes in our bellys. For apps, we started with the charred octopus appetizer, which seems to be popular amongst the Yelp community. In line with what everyone's said, the meat was tender and paired well with the charred chickpeas, eggplant and roasted peppers. The Claudette Cassoulet was hands-down my favorite meal of the night, with its decadent, meaty flavors. I associate cassoulet with medieval peasantry but I'm pretty certain that duck contif was not a prime dark ages ingredient. Interestingly, I didn't see this dish on their regular menus but I really hope that it finds its way there sometime soon!  The seafood in the Bouillabaise dish was tender and fragrant but the soup itself was bit salty for my taste. I was a bit confused because I expected a pastry top to the soup. After consuming nearly a whole loaf of crusty bread between the octopus and cassoulet, it probably was for the best. The local greens looked like they had gotten a deep tissue olive oil massage. The spicy kick was a bit unexpected (though not necessarily in a negative way). The Suzette drink is so simple and refreshing. I would highly recommend as a quasi aperitif. I thought the service was impeccable, especially since we were there until nearly midnight.

You truly feel like you're at a seaside cottage in Provence, and since I was here in October I can only imagine how it might be to dine here in the spring, with the French doors open to 5th avenue. In any case, I really enjoyed ""dining with my eyes"" here on a recent dinner. Food wise, everything was wonderful. We started with the truffle hummus and tabouleh, which both lived up to expectations (and I'd heard a lot about the hummus). Then, I ordered hanger steak for my main course, which was sort of a take on steak frites but instead of potatoes there was shoestring parsley root. These were a bit of a downer since they bore only a passing resemblance to fries, but since I was trying to eat ""light"" I actually didn't mind, and just ignored them. Still, something to keep in mind.  The only other caveat I'd give here is on price - my steak was $30, the hummus was $16, the cheapest glass of wine was around $12, I think. It is Greenwich Village, so not totally unreasonable, but be prepared that it's not a bargain.

5.0,10/20/2015,"Claudette is a Provençal restaurant in the heart of Greenwich Village, steps from Washington Square Park, created by two friends, Carlos A Suarez and Mark Barak. The menu focuses on local produce, seafood and North African aromatics found in the Provençal kitchen.This is definitely one of my favorites in New York! The service is great, the food is fabulous (I just love their 'les garnitures' and usually we order some to go with our dinner). They have a good knowledge of what the food contains so even tough I have allergies I always feel safe eating here.I visit Claudette every time I'm in New York, sometimes for food, sometimes for drinks and I'm always leaving this place with a big smile on my face! The interior is warm and welcoming and they have an adorable outdoor seating during summer. On Claudette's homepage they write that they are offering a warm and inviting atmosphere to share great food with friends and family and I can just say that they really succeeded!I can really recommend you to visit Claudette when in New York!",7,1,1,Frida J.,"New York, NY",70,100,62
4.0,10/10/2015,"Claudette was a lil surprise after the torrential downpour. It is a cute bistro on 5th Avenue in the Village. So happy we were able to enjoy a nice evening with friends. My good friend made an rsvp for dinner before the play. While waiting for me, the group was having cocktails at the bar. As soon as I arrived, we were seated. The decor was very quaint and cute with a touch of romanticism. A very nice place for dinner with friends or a date. The staff was super friendly. The menu had a vast selection for every palate. For appetizers, we ordered the scallop crudo, the charred baby octupus and the truffle hummus. Everything was delicious according to my friends. I just had the charred baby octupus. It was delicious and the octupus was very tender. A great portion to share. For entrees, we ordered the hangar steak (2 orders), bouillabaise, and the pan seared Atlantic cod. Our food was delicious. You can tell by the fact that we all finished our food. I for one absolutely loved my dish. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a crust which gave it a nice texture contrast to the dish. The accompaniments such as the brandade, the cherry tomatoes and the lil potato chips were delish. I was so happy I picked this dish. Everyone at the table enjoyed their entrees. The hanger steak was cooked well and flavorful and the seafood in the bouillabaise was cooked to perfection. We were full and some contemplated having dessert, but we opted out and were just enjoying the conversation and the laughter. Claudette was a really nice restaurant that I highly recommend. What a great evening.",2,2,2,Amy C.,"Flushing, NY",135,308,2008
4.0,10/7/2015,"I tried Claudette with a Blackboard Eats lunch deal. It first took the waitress 15 minutes to take my order even though I was the only customer, but things perked up from there, starting with a delicious amuse bouche of grilled carrots. My appetizer of grilled octopus with ratatouille and chickpeas was a bit too salty, but had bright lemon flavors and the octopus was well cooked. My main was cavatelli with rabbit ragu and was perfect--toothsome cavatelli, flavorful and hearty sauce, generous proportions. It was actually a pleasant surprise--the menu had described the cavatelli as a summer dish with fava beans, but the very friendly manager came over to explain that they hadn't updated the BBE menu yet. My dessert was an orange-flower creme brulee. The tuile was sadly limp, but the creme brulee was very creamy and just the right mix of flowery and sweet.I'm giving the food a 4, the service a 4 (the waitress was attentive later, and the busboys, manager, and hostess were great), and the decor a 5 (very cute and stylish).

I went to rosemary last year so I knew I was going to have a great experience here as well.Though this was supposed to be a birthday dinner for me, it ended up turning into a ""we've had a bad work week and need alcohol"" dinner. We started off with a great steak tartar and grilled octopus. Both were flavored very well. Then we had a pot of mussels with a helping of pasta. Mussels were ok but the pasta was great. Now the drinks! We both started off with some strong cocktails just to take the edge off of the work week. Later on we moved onto wine.

The octopus was the crowd favorite, but the truffle hummus is also award winning.

The flatbread was great, and the octopus was good, but a little overbearing. For dinner I had the hangar steak, which was a perfect size and had enormous flavor. My only true problem with the restaurant is the prices of their beverages. I understand that this is NYC so a $4 coke is normal, but I do have a problem when the waiter assumes you want a refill and then charges another $4. I mean $8 for two glasses of coke!?

Service was ok, the place was not crawling with waiters (I have no problem with waiters/waitresses unless there are too few of them or unavailable), ours was managing her volume but I could tell she had quite a few tables to attend to. Our drinks (nothing fancy) took FOREVER to arrive.....this alone peeved me as much as the noise. Food was pretty good, I loved my appetizer but clearly not a place to linger over a dessert, no matter how good it is. At the end, I wished I had eaten outdoors despite it being a terribly muggy evening to do so. BTW, this was not a weekend night.

I got super lucky with what I ordered: St. Trop cocktail, Ahi Tuna Niçoise, and the Apple Tartine.St. Trop: Delightfully sweet. Not too strong. Fresh, fruity flavor, almost like you were drinking juice with a bit of a punch. Might be too sweet for some, but it was perfect for me.Ahi Tuna Niçoise: Recommended by our maitre d'. It was excellent. Beautifully plated, and the tuna was seared to tender perfection. Wonderful balance of texture from the leaves, potatoes, croutons, and tuna. Also, the sauce was excellent - not too heavy or distracting.Apple Tartine: Another recommendation. It was heavenly. The tartine was heated so nicely, and the crust wasn't soggy at all. There was a lovely dollop of cream on the top that wasn't too sweet or overwhelming. Portion was perfect, although to be honest, I definitely could have ate like five of those singlehandedly.Absolutely will come again!",3,0,1,Katherine Z.,"Washington, DC",561,473,556
3.0,5/29/2015,"Adorable place to have brunch.  The decorations are unique and really give the place a tea party type of vibe.  They have outdoor seating as an option but due to construction going on outside, we opted to stay indoors.  I ordered the Rock Shrimp Omelette which was decent but I found the egg itself to be rather bland.  It came with a side of salad which was nice.  We also ordered a side of fries (which I actually thought was the best part of the meal...hmm odd I know).  FYI, this is not the kind of place that lets you substitute things.  If you don't like a certain ingredient in the food, you can ask them to leave it out but they won't let you add anything in place of it.  Overall, I thought the food here was decent but not sure it was really worth the price point.  Also, there were a few flies flying around but I suppose that's to be expected when there are windows and doors open.",1,0,0,Wendy L.,"Jersey City, NJ",11,47,60

There were 5 of us, and they got 3 of the orders wrong, because whoever made the food didn't read the waitress's notes. That seems kind of stupid to me. We didn't ask for anything complicated, just normal things like: leaving sauce on the side or removing cheese. So, it wasn't like we were unreasonable with our requests.And when asked which dish is easy to make vegan, the hostess (I assume) said that EVERYTHING can be made vegan (really?? even the steak sandwich with gruyere and paprika mayo - what is left - the onions???). She obviously didn't know the menu well and instead of saying she doesn't know, I will get your waitress, she made up some answer. Besides this, Claudette was also not very easy to get in touch with prior to the reservation to check on whether they can accomodate dietary restrictions. I called several times during their normal business hours and no one ever answers the phone - it always goes to voicemail.  Also, I didn't see this prior to going, but vegans beware, this place serves foie gras - disgusting!I wouldn't recommend and I wouldn't return.",4,1,3,H W.,"Manhattan, NY",3,86,36

No need for ketchup. -Beets - I'm a big fan of beets and these were very flavorful and satisfying-Brown Butter Almond Madeline with salted caramel sauce - great dessert to end the meal.  The Madelines were so buttery (butter is everything!) and delectable but the side of salted caramel sauce was incredible.  After we finished all the Madelines, all I wanted to do was drink the little cup of caramel sauce but I was too embarrassed.  The bartender was friendly and had an amusingly dry sense of humor.  All our plates came out fairly quickly which was great for two gals who were very hungry.  Overall a great dining experience and would definitely visit again.",1,1,1,Marilen R.,"Nutley, NJ",307,342,297
4.0,12/29/2014,"Though many people have less than stellar feelings about Rosemary's - finding the food not worthy of the accompanying hype - I always had enjoyable meals there.  So, when I heard that the team was opening a second restaurant, I was eager to give it a shot.  The old Cru and Lotus of Siam spot had been transformed into an elegant French bistro.  Despite having a more formal aire than Rosemary's, the menu and vibe remained more low-key.  I started my meal with two cocktails.  First, I went for the Cotillard's Kiss, which used Roundhouse Pumpkin Liqueur, Becherovka (a Czech herbal beverage), and figs to embody the flavors of the fall season.  Sadly, I found the cocktail a bit too sweet, so I switched over to the A Z Navour, which blended Bombay Gin with the flavors of strawberry, thyme, and lemon.  It was a delightful, but certainly strong, beverage.  In terms of the cuisine, we started by sharing the Corsican Mint Salad, an unseasonably refreshing mixture of arugula, hearts of palm, onions, green beans, and quinoa.  I then moved onto the Chicken Tagine, which was infused with Swiss chard, bulgar wheat, almonds, and oranges.  The meat was moist and tender, and the ingredients within the bulgar added a sweetness.  It was a hearty and flavorful meal.I truly enjoyed my dinner at Claudette, but would also be interested in trying it for brunch, as I have heard great things about that service as well.",0,0,0,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

4.0,11/30/2014,"Lunch here was better than expected.  This space has changed hands so many times over the years, my expectations have become increasingly lowered. The staff was very attentive and friendly.  Nothing bad in that department.The Anouk cocktail was refreshing and delicious. The charred octopus was delectable and a bit meager in portion for more than one person.We might have gone for Le Pain Tunisien, but for $18.00, it seemed pretty steep. My message to the owner might be: forgo being pound-wise and penny foolish, while raising the positive mojo of this much maligned space by giving out this yummy, puffy bread for free...if not, for just for the first few months, or so.The steak sandwich was superlative. Would definitely go back just for this, but many other interesting choices on the menu to lure you in other directions. My friends had the duck salad and seemed pretty satisfied.We tried no desserts, but the list of choices could have used a a bit more thoughtand creative expression.  With one of the best gelato places in the city only a block away, (on University), a wiser approach might be to give that gelateria some stiffer competition.  Even a few French or Moroccan cookies with the espresso we ordered would have set a different tone, like: ""stick around and linger a bit longer, get comfortable here, and come back again.""",0,0,0,Lucienne D.,"Hoboken, NJ",17,171,0

Now on to the food! The food here sadly though did not live up to all the hype! Here is what we ordered:- Tunisian bread with truffle hummus- the bread was basically Indian parantha and the hummus was delicious but I didn't feel like it stood out. Plus for 18 bucks I expect the hummus and the bread to really wow me!- Harissa baked eggs- surprisingly not that great, they were good but nothing that would make me want to come back again. The eggs were a bit dry and the chickpeas in the dish just made the dish even ""drier"" so overall the dish was kind off...meh- Truffaut- rum drink which was delicious! If you love rum you must order this drink! - Harissa chocolate tart- again nothing that different from a regular chocolate tartI think the descriptions of the food let you down, because the descriptions on the menu are fantastic but what comes out doesn't match!

4.0,11/11/2014,"I was really excited to try Claudette because there has been so much hype surrounding it since it's opened. I came here for an early dinner and the place was pretty empty, although I did make a reservation.  The decor is very simple and clean with a lot of floral accents.  It was cozy, warm, and candlelit- I couldn't ask for much more from the ambiance.  The hostess was so welcoming and friendly and brought us over to our table as soon as we arrived.  Our server came over to tell us about the specials, and I instantly got a snobby type vibe.  Yes, Claudette is a fancier type restaurant, but I could have done without the snooty attitude.  At times, I even felt a bit judged by the waitstaff, which is of course never a great feeling while you're trying to enjoy your meal.  Anyway, the food was the star of the evening, as it should be.  We started with the truffle hummus with garlic flatbread, which was very delicious.  The bread was moist and warm and the hummus was perfect.  I decided on the chicken tagine after hearing that it was one of their best dishes.  It is presented in a beautifully decorated tagine dish.  The chicken was flavorful and moist and went so well with the other orange and almond flavors.  This dish is very large, so it's a great option if you have an appetite.  My boyfriend had the striped bass, which he really enjoyed.  I only got to try a tiny piece, but what I did have was very good.  For dessert, we split the pistachio cake which was pretty tiny but so yummy.  It had a delicious citrus cream in the center that went so well with the pistachios in the cake.  The prices are what you would expect for a slightly fancier French restaurant, but it was definitely worth it.  Overall, the food was great (although I was a little irritated with the service).  Great spot for an intimate date or quiet dinner with friends.",4,2,2,Kristina D.,"New York, NY",56,131,156

Big chunks of fish and lots of other yummy seafood delights tucked under the puffed pastry 'lid'. The serving bowl was so special,  it looked like something you see in a Pottery Barn image.  My friend ordered the warm duck salad and another got the market pasta and it all looked good.  We tried a few different cocktails and they were good, sampled some red wine and it was ok.  Overall, I would go back if someone else was itching to try it but I would definitely try some other items on the menu.",0,0,0,Michelle M.,"Manhattan, NY",2,12,5

3.0,10/27/2014,"Claudette was yet another new opening of the year that I couldn't help but make a reservation to. Located just north of Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village, it's best described as a French bistro, pulling inspiration from the Provence region in France. Carlos Suarez and Mark Barak are no strangers to the NYC dining scene, as the success of Rosemary's and Bobo indicates, and their latest venture is a unique meld of the French, Mediterranean, and North African cuisines.On the warm summer evening we visited, the restaurant was buzzing, as nearly every table and seat was occupied. Thankfully, several of the floor-to-ceiling windows had been retracted, which gave the impression of a more spacious dining room. We were quickly seated and given an overview of the menu, a nice but unnecessary gesture, as we'd both gone over the menu well in advance. After deciding on two starters to share and our own entrees, our server was quick to return and take our order.The Courgette was a memorable dish of the evening, a dish composed of zucchini strings in a light anchovy vinaigrette, with roasted tomato slices and basil interspersed throughout. The menu failed to mention the additional sprinkling of feta cheese, and although it provided a needed element of creaminess to the plate, also proved to be a slight annoyance. Slightly better received was the Charred Baby Octopus, a dish featuring several cuts of the cephalopod layered atop a bed of harissa-touched chickpeas, squash, and tomatoes. The octopus was slightly overcooked and the punch of spices I was hoping for wasn't present in the vegetables either. Thankfully, they were more generous was the parsley, which added an aromatic edge to the dish.The Chicken Tagine was probably the standout of the evening. It's brought out in a full-size tagine pot, complete with the triangular lid; the latter is removed after being placed in front of the diner, a showy, but perhaps justified, initial presentation. At first glance, the elements seem too cacophonous to work together, but the tender braised chicken thighs, are well-complemented by the hint of sweetness from orange slices and the nuttiness from the almonds. A bed of bulgar and swiss chard help to round out the carbohydrate and vegetable elements of the dish, although I was again disappointed by the lack of the promised harissa, as the spice would have made for a full flavor profile. It was a stronger plate than the Grilled Lamb that I tried, which seemed average with the yogurt vinaigrette and pommes anna it came with.Claudette has a lot of potential, given the unique area of cuisine it features and the prior experiences of Chef Koren Grieveson, who trained under Paul Cahan at Chicago's avec. The restaurant has been fairly cautious showcasing the full flavors of the regions it represents, a decision that's stemmed the success of a variety of dishes. I hope that they're willing to be a little bolder and more daring in the future, however, as they've started a welcoming ambiance in a well-traversed part of the city.",7,5,7,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

4.0,9/22/2014,"I read lots of great reviews of this place and so decided to give it a try. Overall, I had a pretty pleasant experience, with some slight kinks in the service.Food:In the interest of getting a wider sampling of their offerings, my friends and I decided to order more appetizers and vegetable side dishes (""du Jardin"") instead of getting just entrees. We started out with the pains tunisiens with the pistou (the Provencal version of pesto). The ""pains"" were really just pita, but they made for a great start to our meal and the pistou was a nice complement. I only wish that for $9, there was more than 2 pieces.Next came the fennel salad and baby cauliflowers. Both were quite tasty, with the fennel slightly beating out the cauliflowers in its dressing and overall composition of flavors. The ratatouille tarte that followed was the best of the appetizers. The pie pastry crust was especially well done.For my entree, I ordered the pieds paquets because it came highly recommended by Tasting Table. The meat itself (tripe and pork shoulder) was quite good. The sauce was a bit overseasoned though, and the bread that came with was so charred it was almost completely black on one side. The burnt smell that accompanied my entree didn't help either. My friends ordered the quail (a special that night) and the chitarra. The quail tasted delicious and looked awesome on the plate. The homemade chitarra was my favorite - the subtle lemony flavor in the cream sauce was like nothing that I had tasted before.Service:Our waiter was nice and checked in on us throughout our meal. My only issue was that he pretty much forgot about us for a while after we got water so we ended up waiting a long time to order. Then when he finally did come over (probably because he caught us repeatedly glancing at him while he was chatting with his friend), he decided to announce the specials, which should have done before we had made our decisions.

2.0,9/19/2014,"My friend and I were disappointed with our lunch.  The waiter seemed overly concerned that we order drinks and did not tell us that there were lunch specials.  The hummus was good and clearly fresh, but the flat bread that came with it was like a salty, greasy, fried tortilla.  The beet salad with arugula had only a couple sprigs of arugula and it was doused with vinegar and untoasted sesame seeds.  My friend ordered the warm lamb salad, which was, fatty, soggy and not warm.  Beautiful, bright and clean interior, but I can't recommend this restaurant for the food.",0,0,0,L C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0

2.0,8/24/2014,"Not very impressed honestly.  When I found out a new restaurant was finally going to fill one of the unoccupied storefronts in the 24 5th ave building I was really excited.  I went in one of its first few weeks of being open and left feeling unsatisfied. I ordered the fish, Branzino, and that's all that came out.  The food that was presented to me was just a seared fish on a plate with no garnish, side, or anything.  It was good, but very very plain and left me wanting more.The service was alright, but when the waiter found out I was ordering a glass of wine instead of a full bottle I started to feel rushed as if the waiter wanted us to finish up so he could fill the table with someone else who might be spending more.  It may have just been my waiter though because the waiter for the table next to me was there very often and seemed really nice, while mine was nowhere to be found when I needed something.Overall overpriced and very underwhelming.  I probably will not be coming back, but who knows maybe things will pick up and get better once they've been open for longer and worked out the kinks.",4,0,1,Trevor M.,"New York, NY",0,11,7

5.0,8/12/2014,"Planned to go here for dinner with a party of five and everything that could have possibly gone wrong on our part did, but the team at Claudette hardly batted an eye.We made a reservation for the correct day, but the incorrect month (August instead of July); they gave us a table without a minute's hesitation, but we misspoke and told them we would be four instead of five (one person had yet to arrive); they found us a larger table without any hesitation whatsoever. Needless to say, five gold stars for the waitstaff.Among our party, we had two chicken tagines (myself being one of them -- chicken so tender it fell off the bone; delicious blend of flavors), bouilliabaisse, lamb, and one of the pasta dishes (I forget which one).

Very disappointed. No Rouille? WTH? Desert was near perfection. Lavender cake was awesome. Pot de creme was a tad overcooked, but the fleur de sel on top really was a nice touch.

Highlights were the fennel, the cauliflower, the zucchini, and pickled leeks. Flavors were fresh and it was a great way to start the meal. We had a bottle of Minuty rose, one of my favorites.For entrees my fiancé and I shared the chicken Tagine and the snapper. The snapper came wrapped in eggplant on a nice bed of pesto. The chicken was served with couscous in a real Tagine.I also took a nibble of the whole dorade and found it a little too simple.Unfortunately they didn't let us look at the dessert menu and sent out a pistachio cake with candied orange.

3.0,7/23/2014,"It could have been great... We arrived earlier than our reservation - 6.45pm for a 8.30pm - thinking we would grab a drink at the bar and be seated earlier, upon the advise provided over the phone for walkins. The hostess tells me it will be 15-20 minutes. Perfect! But almost an hour later we are still not seated... Yet, I noticed the 2 other couples that walked in right after us got seated - and are already eating!!! I go back to the hostess, ask when I'll be seated, she replies ""oh for walk-ins it is an hour now..."" ""Well, my reservation is at 8.30pm, so I hope to be seated by then..."" ""Oh sorry I completely forgot about you... give me 5 minutes you should be set up"". Yet we still pay our drinks at the bar... a kind gesture would have been to offer them for the wait. Oh well, I guess manners can get lost.We finally sit. The restaurant is bustling, our waitress does her best. I can't blame her. But I have to ask 5 times for tabasco... I end up walking back to the bar and ask the bartender for his. Not cool. My friend and I have ordered a bottle of Bandol ($90... it is rose guys!) which is lovely, and overpriced! :-) We want to leave it on ice... we have to ask multiple times to get our glasses refilled... same with the water. My friend and I are sharing appetizers, to sample different things. The tunisian bread is awful. It is cold, not crusty, very chewy... Worse ever. We ask for regular bread to eat the tapenade with and tell the waitress this is really meh... The rest is good! The couteaux clams are excellent, the Mint salad is really good too. The rest is less memorable... The ratatouille tart is neither cold nor hot... like it never finished heating. The spring peas and radish are good, but could be better....I do not eat very fast but I am not slow either... I was still working on the plates and that was obvious... I got asked (and interrupted) at least 12 times if we were done... so at the end we gave up and told the gentleman he could just take everything... half of our appetizers being still worked on. My friend then ordered desert... and she loved it! The lemon tart is apparently exceptional!Come the time of the check. The restaurant has quieted down. They have forgotten to put the bottle on the check. Kindly, we tell the waitress. She apologizes, runs back and brings the new check... with the wine on. My friend had taken desert... Seriously, we remind you of a $90 bottle and you are not even going to show some customer honesty appreciation? Take 1 appetizer or my friend's dessert off for god's sake. It is a shame....

3.0,7/16/2014,"I'm always hesitant to go to restaurants this new because I do feel like they have some kinks to work out.  I do want to preface by saying that my dining experience wasn't bad, but there were just little things that could have made it significantly better.  Great things about this place1) the atmosphere- so cute and romantic.  The lighting is beautiful and soft.  2) the size of the menu- not too crazy and overly ambitious but plenty if choices3) quality of ingredients- everything seemed to be very fresh4) prices- they're pretty fair.  Nothing too outrageous.What could have made my experience better?  Well, let's see1) spacing of the tables- we were sitting at a table in the middle of the dining room and I think the tables are situated a little too close.  I spent most of the meal trying to scoot my chair in to keep people (including the waitstaff) from bumping into me every 2 seconds...2) Service- while the service was fine and unoffensive, the waitress was sounding really uncertain when she was talking about the specials, which made me not want to order it.3) My dish- I ordered the whole dorade which I expected to be a whole fish.  And that it was.  Just a fish.  On a plate.  No garnish, no sides no nothing.  Oh wait, there was a grilled half lemon on the plate.  On top of that, for the prices that this restaurant charges, someone should have come filet it for me, but no one did.  Luckily, I'm pretty experienced when it comes to whole fish so I was able to do it myself, but what if I wasn't?  Awkward.  Also, my fish was under-seasoned (while simple, it was a little TOO simple).  Others seemed to like their dish, but maybe I just ordered wrong.4) Dessert- we didn't get a choice of dessert since they needed our table back.  I wish I had at least gotten to see what I didn't get!  The dessert that I had was good, but I was unfortunately the only one at the table that liked it.Anyway, I think this place has some work to do before it earns another star from me.  I think that the simplicity of its dishes definitely will draw a strong audience of people that love it, but for me, I'll probably wait a few months before I visit again.",3,1,4,Rachel K.,"Queens, NY",150,248,13

She truly ensured the event went off without a hitch-- and we didn't even have a  private room, but were simply part of a restaurant full of diners.   The food was fresh and amazing!

After 2 generous glasses of Pampelonne, received our appetizers : fennel, pieds paquets (pigs feet) and truffle humus. The fennel was delicious, but we could not taste the truffle oil in the hummus, although it was a good dish. I was waited for the pieds paquets to try and was not regrettably very pleased. A greasy dish, not enough salt. I should have selected the octopus.A main dishes were much better, a fantastic red snapper, and it went so well with a glass of chateau nelly (11$) and some delicious Cavaletti.

5.0,6/22/2014,"It's a new kid on the street in west village where a lot of great restaurants have made their marks. However, it is a promising jam. They put a lot of effort into the decor and the presentation to make it upscale. I would suggest girls dressing up to enjoy the lovely dining vibe there. The baby octopus was very interesting, filling with different layers. At first, it was just a grilled octopus but while you were chewing, there was a layer of spice. The truffle hummus was also great, together with the naan-ish bread. The chicken was delicious, tender and juicy. The snapper tasted a bit dry for me but the potato chip pairing was surprisingly delightful. In addition, the drinks they provided were definitely a must-try. For girls, Claudette offers this low-alcohol to pair your appetizers, I would recommend ""Simone"" which is an orange-based drink, very refreshing and light, perfect for the summer.And the service was just perfect. Our waitress was very attentive and professional. She times perfectly to keep the pace of our dishes and made small chats to ease us in. For boys, if you really like the girl, and it's your first or second date, you are on the mission to impress but don't think your relationship has developed to the stage to dine at a Michelin three-star yet, this place could be a perfect spot for you.",5,2,1,Ariel G.,"Redwood City, CA",128,98,1

It is like cherry blossom in your mouth! Of course, all of these cannot be so perfect without a glass of chilled Provencial rose from chateau de pampelonne - bone dry, with honey and strawberry notes. As a matter of fact, the while wine list is well curated, which is dominated by Loire, burgundy and souther France wines. Must have - soft shell crab and baby octopus. Both are savory and seasonal. Between the two my fave is the octopus which is seasoned with sun dried tomatoes and chickpeas. Charred, smokey and zesty! Would come back just for it. The softshellcrab crab is good but the jalapeño needs to deliver more heat.Service is friendly. the bartender, Dillion, will makes your cocktail on demand.
