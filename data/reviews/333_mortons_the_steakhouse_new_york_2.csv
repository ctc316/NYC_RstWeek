Food arrive in timely order, I always ask for recommendations since I have dietary restrictions whereas a great blue cheese salad accompanied with some fine was was suggested. Menu has a great variety. Portions are just right. Morton's is a great ambience for lunch or diner. Everyone from the Hosts to the cook were very kind during our visit.

4.0,3/21/2019,"It's Morton's so it's good.  Steaks are awesome, sides are great, cocktails are superior and that onion bread they bring to the table is orgasmic.  I'll bet you $20 that if you order a bottle a wine under $80 that they'll come back and say it's not available until you pick a bottle of $100 or more.  This seems to be the deal lately at most restaurants around NYC and I feel it's deceptive and a way for the restaurant to boost the bill and the servers' tip.  We had filet mignonette with shrimp and scallops.  The steak and shrimp were good, the bacon wrapped scallops were average.  Chocolate lava cake was Devine.  I'm rating on the food and atmosphere, not on the shady wine bottle sham.  Shame on you Morton's!!",0,0,0,Paul M.,"Wayne, NJ",37,275,680

5.0,2/13/2019,"Excellent ambiance, service, and food.I. Ambiance1.1 Minor initial problemWhen we arrived, there was a very loud radio noise - horrible voices of angry lovers - impossible to have a conversation - it took about 20 unnecessary minutes to convince the manager to lower the sound. Fortunately for the rest of the dinner - the radio was shut down.1.2 Relaxed elegant ambianceThere is sufficient space between tables - very comfortable seats - elegant settings -high ceilings and beautiful romantic lights.2. ServiceThe service was impeccable - our server, Mr. Paul Parrott, was extremely professionally efficient, graceful, caring and went beyond the call of duty to please us - observed carefully our needs, explained thoroughly the options in the menu - as perfect as can be.II. The food1.AppetizersShrimp Cocktail, Jumbo Crab Cocktail, Onion Soup, Escargot were excellent.2.Main dishes The filet mignon ( both 6 and 12 ounces), the Ribeye, the Chilean Sea Bass were very tasty-worth ordering. ( I still prefer the Chateaubriand at Keens Steak House) The outstanding dish was Steamed Jump Alaskan Giant Crab legs - $67 per lb. (In China town prices are from $30 to $55 per lb -have to order minimum 8 lbs); excellent preparation.We did not try the Lobster options (single and double) tails.3. DesertsThe souffle's (Grand Marnier,   Chocolate, Lemon, Rasbury flavors -both single and double sizes) were acceptable ( The competition in Chez Napoleon [50th street and 9th avenue] and Madison Bistro[37th street and Madison Avenue] are slightly better). The chocolate cakes options -better than souffle's -were excellent.   Generous portion of whipe cream was served. 4. Drinks - excellent choices of non-alcoholic as well as wine and hard liquor- the coffee (Americano and Cappuccino) -were good.General EvaluationA first class, upscale steak house, with excellent sea food-fish options.Recommended for large parties, family gatherings, business meetings, as well as romantic encounters - superior service.A note to the management - PLEASE HAVE MERCY ON YOUR CUSTOMERS' EARS - NO need for the customer to walk at 4:30 pm into an empty restaurant - with awful - songs of hostile lovers. You have a dignified space, superior food, and perfect service - it deserves a peaceful ambiance. Very likely due to prices, a majority of your clients are professionally established people who may like classical music.Also, may I recommend you taste Chateaubriand steak at Keens Steak House (36th street, near 6th avenue).Thank you Paul!",0,0,0,Parviz M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,47,1
5.0,2/9/2019,"I went here on date and also part of restaurant week! Dinner ($42) The menu wasn't bad! My appetizer started with a lobster bisque ($3 upgrade). I used the complimentary bread that they offer which is enormous! as a dipping tool. With that I ordered a seasonal sangria which is strong in alcohol but I prefer actual fruits in mine instead of flavored alcohol. Anyways, for the entree, I chose the 6oz filet mignon. It was quite small and I wasn't in the mood to spend an extra $10 for the upgrade to an 8oz. Besides that, the filet was PERFECTLY . cooked and was very juicy! It also came with an accompaniment side which I picked twiced baked potatoes. The cheese smells like it should be a mac and cheese but it smelled and tasted awesome! On top of that we ordered different desserts. Key Lime Pie and Chocolate Mousse. It was very delicious so we ended up cancelling our plans for dessert. Also saved a few bucks haha.  But great ambiance and experience. The waiters and host were extremely attentive and nice.",0,0,0,Eric Y.,"Old Bridge, NJ",47,220,196
4.0,2/7/2019,"Met up with my two friends to enjoy one final restaurant during restaurant week and this was the choice. I tried to be good by opting for the Caesar salad to start because of how much bread I had already ate at that point. For main course, I went with the 6oz center cut steak with creamed spinach. Let me say the creamed spinach was great! My friends got the horseradish mashed potatoes that are unique to say the least and not in a good way, maybe they are an acquired taste. Ordered the key lime pie to take home to my husband since I was stuffed, he really enjoyed the pie.",0,0,0,Ciara S.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",63,145,35
4.0,1/28/2019,"I had a chance to dine at Morton's steakhouse for restaurant week, and may I say I receive top knot service. From the moment I walked in your eyes are greeted with a lovely dim ambiance and a romantic atmosphere. There are two levels which had a little bit more light. So it was cool for a girls night as well. The host greeted me and I was taking upstairs where I had the most utmost service from a lovely waitress name Alexandria. She was attentive but not overbearing answered all my questions about the menu. Told me the crowd favorites vs her own. I had the prime 16oz pork chop medium well. It was cooked to perfection but honestly lacked a little flavor but nothing that couldn't be fixed with a dash of salt and pepper. For the side order, I had the Twice baked Au  Gratin potatoes which were recommended by my waitress. It was delicious well baked with cheese and bits of bacon. For my starter I had the Lobster bisque it was really rich with a kicked of spice it was still missing little chunks of meat but it was definitely high quality. I also had the pleasured of tasting the honey roasted salmon spread over corn and tomatoes. It was amazing and the sweet sauce it wasn't overkilled. The side for the salmon was their creamy spinach. You could tell the spinach is fresh it was so creamy. Now for Dessert's, I had the key lime pie it was absolutely delicious. Light, Fluffy just a bit tart with a graham cracker crust. I also had the chocolate lava cake with ice cream. To my surprise the chocolate was light wasn't over sweet but still tasty. I enjoyed the key lime more and the ice cream which tasted a lot like  Haagen Dazs. Overall my experience was amazing and I will recommend this place for Date Night, Family Dinners, Birthday's and if you and the girls feel like just catching up with great food and looking cute deft go for it!!!! And how can I forget that fluffy fresh bun they bring to your table! with whipped butter. yummy yum yum.",0,0,0,Helene M.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,20,4

2.0,12/25/2018,"Sadly our perception of a romantic dinner at Mortons was crushed.  We walked in to an ear piercing restaurant that might have very well be a local pub by all the noise.  In booking, I asked for a quiet table.  Mortons could very well have written back to us and said this isnt the restaurant for us!  The tables were so close together, you might as well been dining in a cafeteria!  We were almost ready to ask for our food to be bagged so we could take away and eat in peace in our Airbnb!  REALLY!!!????  For the price it was very disappointing and the manager listened but  was indifferent to our disappointment in the whole experience.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this particular Mortons.  Unless you wish to dine with not speaking to your table mates.   Shame shame.  I recorded the sound!  Shrilling!!!   In my younger days I went to beer bars that were less noisy!",0,0,0,Katherine W.,"San Diego, CA",45,45,2

Entree came with delicious round onion bread. The bread is nothing short of amazing. At Morton's everything's ala carte so this time, I decided to try the macaroni and cheese which was very flavorful, tasted blue cheese strongly in this but not really sure if it was used. It was very creamy and a huge portion; so always opt to share the sides. For dessert, I had the berries a la glacé. Only issue is that I received whipped cream not ice cream like I thought. Service was great! When I asked if the bread had any nuts I was reassured me that there were none.

3.0,11/10/2018,"Decor: Very Romantic or just chill, it's dark which I liked a lot and a little off the fast pace of 5th avenue which I also loved but the overall service could have been better especially for Lunch.Service: As you look through my reviews, you'll know I have been to countless steakhouse's and I really feel that the part of a steak house experience is always to make their guest feels top notch with  have attentive waiters, for one because half the time you leave steakhouse you could have bought yourself something amazing at Saks, Burbery, LV, etc but more importantly, because at times you are there with an important client that you want to impress or frankly, you just want be catered to and distress from life.That said, the service here needs some improvement. I went during lunch and I requested the crab BLT and they didn't even attempt to make it as app for the table; I was just told to come back from dinner and that I would have to sit a the BAR! I was floored, I even stressed that the reason I came to Morton's was to try ; I dont see the big deal in making and exception, most steakhouse  makes exceptions to make things form their dinner menu for lunch, if all ingredients are in house, what is the difference?! But was more annoying was being told come back in the evening  and I had to sit at the bar, that ridiculous!Food:For apps, the  scallops with bacon were great but the short rib tacos were NOTHING special, do yourself a favor and don't order it.However, their steak was awesome, the porter for two with garlic butter was amazing but the chicken bianco was nothing special, the bread crumbs didn't have flavor.Deserts: My favorite was the red velvet but we also ordered their legendary chocolate  cake which was good and not too sweet but it took  30 minutes to come out.All in all , I would come back if I were invited but I wouldn't go out of my way to stop in.",1,0,1,Angelica B.,"Manhattan, NY",75,113,432

Perhaps my first mistake was looking at the ONE restaurant week menu that was brought to our table with the caveat that, ""more were being printed"". We did get the 2 glasses of ice we asked for, but for the most part the waitress was M.I.A. during our meal. We had to ask for the complimentary bread. Really?

I would love to give 5 stars, sadly my Restaurant Week experience forces me to drop a star.Good News: The food is fantastic! Their R.W menu is an accurate cross section of their regular menu and the portion sizes are generous. I got the five onion soup, 6oz filet mignon medium well, horseradish mashed potato, and chocolate mousse. My sister had the same except her side was the broccoli florets and her entree was the salmon. The food was perfectly prepared. We also ordered coffee which was fresh brewed and wonderful.Not So Good News:Overall Experience. Now I have been here for R.W before and had a wonderful time . However, I regularly come to this restaurant and had certain expectations that were not met.1) The bread:If I'm at a steak restaurant, I'm probably not terribly concerned about my carb intake. So why did I have to ask for the complimentary bread? Was it because it was R.W and the young lady didn't think I was aware of regular protocol? Who knows?2) The service:I am not exaggerating. There were TWO other parties in the restaurant yet our waitress was often M.I.A. I could understand if it was busy but it wasn't. I believe the manager came by more often than she did to ask if everything was ok.Conclusion: Morton's IS worth it. As I said, I have the card, visit often and actually get several rewards. I'm sure this is an isolated incident and I would just suggest that Morton's advise staff to give the same level of service to ALL customers, even if it's R.W.",0,0,0,Mireya H.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,46,256

Atmosphere: high ceilings, dim lighting, intimate modern feel. Food:  Cesar salad is pretty standard. Bread is large round loaf, warm that can be shared amongst the table. I had the sirloin steak- medium rare which again was standard, no particular seasoning or taste that comes to mind. The side of mashed potatoes was delicious ( mixed with milk and butter?) Tasted home made and delicious. Dessert: chocolate mousse- was good , light and refreshing topped with a raspberry.Service: I would say great service , very attentive , water always filled in time, made the experience very pleasant.

Bathrooms downstairs, and they have an elevator inside to get you up or down their different floors (down to bathroom/kitchen, up to dining room section).Popped in for lunch, and it was still pretty busy - big business meeting going on upstairs, and was greeted and seated promptly.Lunch special had a few items (soup/salad + main + dessert) for $39. Or you could order off the regular menu.A large loaf of onion bread on the table for people to share. Had escargot (love the garlic & butter, could do without the strange flaky biscuit they put on there - the onion bread was better at soaking up the butter and garlic). The tuna taco was ok, a little spice with avocado, tomatoes, cucumbers and seaweed salad on the side to add on top (3 to an order).The ribeye I had was cooked medium rare in the center; outside was a bit burnt leading to some charcoal that I'm not a fan of, but otherwise was good (though I should've asked for some horseradish cream). Spinach sauteed with garlic was simple and not salty, so that was good balance.Fellow diner had the veal chop which was rich and buttery - super buttery (literally top was swimming in it). I'll have to try that another time.End they pitch a Landry's card ($25 cost, but you get some portion off all future purchases and faster seating, etc.). Could be worth it? Felt oddly commercial.

4.0,4/11/2018,"Right when we walked in, we were greeted with a friendly service immediately. The ambiance is a little dark and quite honestly made me a little sleepy at the end of my meal. Our waiter brought us out bread within minutes of being seated; the bread was fluffy, warm, topped with crunchy onions and delicious. When it came to ordering our food, he was patient with us and explained the menu wonderfully. The friend I was with was pregnant and couldn't eat a well done steak so he allowed her to order a burger which is usually not done in the dining room. (Why pay 80$ for a meal you can't enjoy!) He was very accommodating and did not give us a tough time at all regarding this request! I got the 6oz filet with bacon wrapped scallops and shrimp. The food was good, but not exceptional. I also felt like it was not worth the price of the dish; I personally feel like there are better steakhouses near the area for the same price. However, we got the chocolate lava cake for dessert and it was absolutely phenomenal.Overall, I am giving the place four stars due to great ambiance, service and dessert. It is short of five stars due to the fact that the food was not overwhelmingly great and given what you are paying for the plates, you can get better steaks with your money at other nearby places in the midtown east and west area.",1,0,0,Grace K.,"New York, NY",393,60,87

4.0,3/22/2018,"Had a reservation for 5:30 pm Friday night. The restaurant is spacious, there's a mezzanine. Muted, dark and golden colors, dim lighting, classy, Fitzgerald-esque vibes. Fitting for an intimate dinner. Towards the evening, the space gets really dark, so recommend sitting closer to the windows or the walls, where there are additional lamps so you can actually see your companion and your plate.The service was impeccable--our waiter, Louis, was super friendly and helpful. Checked in on us after serving every course. Was very attentive and was at our side to help before we even thought we needed help. Tables around us received excellent service all around as well. The manager checked in on some guests.The food was delicious, but be prepared to pay a pretty penny, as in all major steakhouses. We weren't particularly hungry, so opted out for a lighter meal (as, surprisingly, many guests around us did).Bacon wrapped scallops appetizer: three well-cooked, tender scallops, the bacon flavor stood out in this dish. (Can turn this into an entree and will receive four scallops instead of three). Sweet sauce (wish it had more citrus to it, to actually highlight the scallops). Tasty, but scallops by themselves were pretty bland, wish they had more flavor to them, so that all that I'd end up remembering from the dish was the overpowering taste of bacon.Ordered crab cake as an entrée: got two crab cakes, two sauces, a tiny bit of arugula. Solid crab cakes and tartar & hollandaise sauces. Raspberry soufflé for two: like eating a cloud! Seriously, the fluffy foam just melted in the mouth. Served with a side of custard, which was perfect. The frothy, bubbly soufflé mound disappeared from our plates--delicious and barely there. So light, you could barely tasted it. A perfect conclusion of a meal, so you won't feel overstuffed by a heavy sweet.Our waiter separated the soufflé into two portions, without my date and me first even taking a look at it, which was felt rushed and disappointing, as we couldn't see the beautiful dish. Other reviewers mentioned that the soufflé is big enough to serve 3-4. Cannot speak to that, as we haven't actually seen our soufflé and what was presented to us on our individual plates was a pretty small portion, especially considering that it was a nearly transparent foam.Overall, will be back to try the steak and do recommend this for a solid dining experience.",0,0,0,Kseniya K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",223,112,526
5.0,2/28/2018,"Eaten at several steakhouses and Morton's (midtown) was by far better than other. Started with 1/2 dozen raw oysters and crab cake. For what we're paying, the crab cake could've been bigger or give two per order. Ordered the bone in ribeye and it was cooked and seasoned just right. Some steakhouse tend to drown the steak in butter...not Morton's. For sides, we ordered sautéed mushrooms & spinach and an order of onion ring. Onion rings are thick cut and crispy (not oily). For dessert, we ordered the raspberry soufflé and key lime pie. Soufflé (for two) is huge and can be shared between three or four. Key lime pie isn't sweet but can use a little more key lime flavor. Can't forget about the service. We had a good friendly waiter (Matt). He came to check in on us to make sure everything is good several times.

Always good to hear what the specials are for the day...whether you get them or not.Appetizers: 1/2 dozen oysters (blue point) were good...though I prefer west coast oysters are better. Crab cake was good though small. Main course: Bone-in ribeye was nicely prepared and didn't require additional steak sauce. One of my friends had the twin lobster tail special...look a bit small but good.Sides: Sautéed spinach and button mushrooms and onion rings! can't go wrong with these choices.Desserts: Must get the soufflé for 2 to share - highly recommend the raspberry soufflé (sooo delicious) but order it with dinner as it takes 30 minutes to prepare... Key lime pie was also good - not to tart. But soufflé is the best! There's chocolate, lemon, raspberry or gran marnier - lemon is hit or miss at times.If you're celebrating your birthday, you get a free dessert and complimentary picture to remember the special occasion...very nice touch!  Thank you for that!

When I made reservation, OpenTable has options to choose occasion, so I put ""special occasion"" as my friends have some good news that we can celebrate for. Upon arrival, we were brought to the dinning area all the way in the back. It's less crowded, has nice lighting, and is more quiet compare to the outside dinning area. Later there was another table for celebrating birthday. I realized/guessed that we probably sat in the area for ""occasions"". Among everything we had, we were surprised how big the bread and the pork chop (16oz) were. 6oz steak seems small but was actually enough. Medium is pink inside (only the edge looks cooked). I had a hard time cutting some steak for my friends who cannot eat raw lol. I may try medium well-done next time if that's an option. 3 of us think cheesecake tastes better than chocolate mousse and think chocolate mousse is too sweet. Before we got the bill, the waitress (Carol?) politely asked if she can take a picture for us (using their camera).

Only if the seasoning wasn't too strong, we could have finished all but I had to drink a lot of water even after I came out of the restaurant.The service wasn't so great. Workers were keep passing behind my seat which had a very small gap and they never apologized for hitting my chair. I had to say sorry for sitting there which I still don't understand. Our waitress Carolina wasn't around much, and we had to wait for her to come by every time we needed her. When I asked her for the side plate, she looked annoyed, and only time she smiled at us was when she grabbed back the bill.

4.0,1/6/2018,"This Morton's is set in the iconic Fred F. French building and carries the art deco motif through perfectly. Understated lines and geometric patterns everywhere, lots of lush blacks and gold in the color palette. Staff attire, glass patterns -- everything -- imbues this place with that F. Scott Fitzgerald feel. The lighting is pitch perfect. Dim and intimate, yet warmly golden and more than sufficient to leave you with no problems enjoying your dining companions or feasting with your eyes and taste buds on the sumptuous fare before you. Julien waited on us. He was everything you want in a server -- very conscientious of how little or how much attention guests require of him and the ability to deliver. He was naturally charming and knew his craft well. I enjoyed talking to him about his native France. The sides were pretty decent -- I guess you'd only be disappointed if you expected everything to blow your mind, which I kind of did because of the cache these types of joints evoke. They tasted like your standard, well-prepared side dish. But the bone-in rib eye actually did blow my mind. I asked for rare originally, but Julien cautioned that medium rare might be a better choice because the fat needs a *touch* more time to render in that cut. I heeded his advice and was not disappointed. So succulent and flavorful, I barely touched the blue cheese butter I got alongside because the rib eye itself was perfection that needed no doctoring whatsoever. I'm not a drinker, so I can't speak for wine pairings or cocktails.

Our friends were thankfully very early when arriving to the location and called us immediately to inform us that the place closed down. I was frantic because it was nearing our reservation time so I had to rush to call the other couples and tell them to not bother making the trip. I was so upset because we prepaid for the dinner and the location closed without informing diners who booked tables. I felt just as bad because despite reaching the rest of our dinner party before they left their homes, we still had a couple that took the Metro North all the way downtown in the cold for nothing.We decided to head downtown to meet them for dinner so that the night wasn't a total let down and to also give them a ride back home for their trouble of coming out to celebrate with us. They decided on Morton's and we met them there. I found parking right in front and by the time we arrived they had already ordered and were halfway through there meal.i really can't blame them and I believe I used our entire dinner to apologize profusely for the whole evening. Hubby and I shared everything we ordered and settled on three items. We didn't want to overdo it because we saw that our friends could not finish their meals and from the size of their plates, we had a feeling that we would have the same problem.Food:Steak Tartare w/Frites - I loved this dish. Every bite was the perfect bite. It was molded with a layer of chopped egg and chopped shallots. Perfect.Ceasar Salad - the portion size was smaller than I would have thought but it was more than enough for us, especially with a huge ribeye approaching.Ribeye - huge, juicy piece of meat, cooked to temp with just the right amount of bloody and a buttery tender texture. We loved it.Our server was great. He was nice and attentive and didn't mind the additional diners. My dirty martini was solid and I would most definitely come back to Morton's again.

When I first found out about Morton's Happy Hour some odd number of years ago, each item on their Bar Bites menu were a whopping $5.00!! It was the absolute best deal in midtown. On quite a few occasions my friends and co-workers would take a seat at one of their many high top tables in the bar lounge and imbibe on happy hour priced glasses of ""BV"" aka BV Coastal - Beaulieu Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon. And round out our HH with either the Petite Filet Mignon sandwiches, the plump and juicy Mini Prime Cheeseburgers, the refreshingly crisp Iceberg Wedge and/or Mini Crab Cake BLT's. Other menu items such as Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail, Oysters on the Half Shell, Creamy Crab, Spinach and Artichoke dip plus Blue Cheese Steak fries, were also in our rotation. Outside of happy hour, Morton's power prix-fixe lunches were also a decent deal offering the standard one appetizer, entree choice of steak or seafood plus dessert. But what kept us coming back more often than not, were the affordable Bar Bites. Through the years, the cost has incrementally increased from $5 to $6 to $7 per item, which still is a good deal.  As Morton's is a chain restaurant, you too can take advantage of their Happy Hour Bar Bites at any of their other locations, such as in Westchester or Connecticut.

She didnt explain that salad i order is just half of tomato with some mayo and blue cheese on top for 20$!!!! Place looked good but waitress killed all the mood, and i believe in place like this should work people that will make you comfortable and explain you all about the food coz they see you are just a foreigner... and by the way tomato was very bad i had stomach problem for the rest of the day from the sous, and dishes from the rest of my family were super small and not best quality.

The server did forgot a soda order, which we had to remind him about, and our entrees came out before we were finished with the appetizers, but other than that he was good.The complimentary onion bread is gigantic and delicious.  I had to restrain myself from getting full before our food came out.My boyfriend and I both ordered the Caesar salad to start (his without croutons). It's your typical Caesar salad (nothing special) and was pretty tasty, but could've been dressed a little more. We both also ordered the 6 oz filet, medium rare. This was cooked perfectly and was incredibly soft and juicy. They did not serve the jus to my boyfriend because the server noted it has gluten in it. The steak could've been seasoned a bit more, it was slightly bland.The steak comes with a side of mashed potatoes, which were very smooth and creamy.  I added some butter and it could've used a bit more salt, but was otherwise good.For dessert I ordered the cheesecake, which was very rich.  Although the cheesecake itself was good, I didn't like the strawberry sauce they poured on, which cheapened it to me.My boyfriend got the chocolate mousse, which was gluten free. This was chocolaty and delicious.Overall, the restaurant week menu is great and of good value, especially with the Amex $5 back per person if each Amex cardholder spends over $35.",3,2,3,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634

It's really great bread.Morton's Salad - more or less your standard Cesar salad with eggs and an anchovy on top. Pretty average16oz Pork Chop - in my opinion, the best RW dish you can get at any steak house near Midtown. Massive cut with a great char, and cooked perfectly. The only way this could get better is if it was served on a plate of butter.Key Lime Pie - what a great piece of pie. Perfect balance of a tart filling with sweet cream and crust.

I can't imagine anyone having more than 2-3 bites, but it's free- beggars can't be choosers. Mortons salad-  ""lettuce"" just say that if you're going to name a salad after your restaurant at least try make it memorable. This came w three little sad anchovies and about 10 little crumbles of egg yolk.

Something i would not expect from a steakhouse that claims it has ""the best steak anywhere."" This is a ""misteakhouse."" Cheesecake - this was the highlight of dinner. Not the best cheesecake i've ever had, but still pretty good. Key Lime pie-This was super sweet- it's like eating a handful of sugar. This is def not the ""key"" to my heart, nor should it be the ""limelight"" of yours or your cutie ""pie's"" dinner. I would have probably given this place 3 stars, but it was just a really annoying dinner. When we first sat down, 3 different people asked us about what drinks we wanted. I guess they dont communicate very well because it was only after the third try did we actually get our drinks.Then when our appetizers and entrees came, they kept mixing up our orders. They kept giving me my friend's food and my friend my food. This doesn't even happen to me at an applebee's in east harlem-i expect nothing less than this from a Morton's.

We went there because of Restaurant Week and figured we would try this place. Upon arrival and asking for the restaurant week menu, our server seemed very disappointed. The service he gave us was horrible. Seriously McDonalds service is better... We got no greeting, no customer service that you usually get anywhere else. For appetizers we ordered lobster bisque and the Morton's salad. Morton's salad is disgusting ,don't even think about getting it. Lobster bisque was okay. For the entree, I got the 6oz filet mignon and my friend got the double cut pork shop. My filet mignon was perfectly seasoned but the pork chop was incredibly salty. Salty to the point where it was really inedible after a few pieces. They seasoned the pork chop to death. Desserts were okay at best, nothing special. Cheese cake seemed old and not fresh, chocolate moose was decent. If you are going here for restaurant week, don't bother. We tipped our server 20% even though he deserved way less.

Finally got weak drinks and those great apps. 1 and 15 after we got there I checked in at the front about a table and the response was surprise someone didn't get us earlier. There were many open tables. Manager tried to make amends with free drinks.

I've been to the Morton's in Great Neck and wasn't impressed - though I was at that one for an educational dinner as well, I *really* got the restaurant treatment there. This Morton's was better - though I only got a sampling of what they offered, the food was very good. The bread basket contained onion rolls served with soft butter - it was carblicious mmmm. We then proceeded to Caesar salad which was basic but tasty - in lieu of croutons a cheese crostini was served in its place. I had to go with beef for my main, which came with sides of garlic green beans and sour cream mashed potatoes. Everything was very tasty and full of flavor. We finished the meal with chocolate mousse - it was rich but good. The decor was typical of other Morton's - I'm a fan, totally gives off the steakhouse feel.

3.0,7/7/2016,"Had dinner last night at Morton's. First of all, this place needs a serious wait stuff training. Once we were given the menu, our waiter asked us about the drinks. Good start. Since we haven't seen wine list, we ordered water first. And I asked for a straw and a lemon. Got the straw with my dessert, about an hour later after asking every passing waiter/busboy. Second: my concern was the fish: farm-raised or wild. The waiter confidently stated that salmon is wild. Well, after going back to the kitchen and discussing it with a chef, he changed the origins of salmon to farm-raised. If you are not sure, please, don't come up with an answers. There is a difference between those two, not only in price. For an appetizer, we had caesar salads. Lettuce were crispy but fresh. The waiter did a good job taking and delivering  my salad as requested: dressing on the side, no croutons. As a mail course, my friend had steak with shrimps and I enjoyed sea bass but broccoli that were overcooked (steamed).

The wine was the Howl at the Moon and was good and I thought the price tag of $111.00 was alright. This is what got me! I have always went there with a friend who usually handles dividing up the bill. I was appalled to learn that they charge for the onion roll that they so generously place on the table without asking if you actually want it. Honestly, I love a good onion roll and probably would pay the $10.00 charge. It is more the principle for me. Just ask. Do not place something on the table and then charge for it.

The staff is always very courteous and professional even when the people you're with are picky eaters. I have to be completely honest Morton's is not my favorite steakhouse, but I have never had a bad meal here and it's still a very good steak and I would recommend coming here 100%. My favorite thing to get at Morton's surprisingly is the macaroni and cheese. It is the best damn macaroni and cheese I think I've ever had. When I was in Vegas for dinner one night. I just had macaroni and cheese and a scotch. In my opinion the macaroni and cheese is that good and filling. I have had the Mac and cheese at all of the locations That I have been to and it tasted exactly the same at every location. It is soooo goodddd!As far as lunch and dinner. I do recommend calling mortons A few days Ahead to make reservations. You should make reservations In general anywhere you eat. For lunch on a weekday I don't think you will be needing a reservation. But for dinner reservation is a must. The ambience is very nice during dinner hours. It's dimly lit and they have candles on every table. You could definitely take a date here just for drinks or for a meal. There is a private upstairs seating area that you have to call and ask to be seated up there. They also have private and VIP dining. Will also have to call ahead of time to arrange for that.The menu has a wide range of options from $99 bone in ribeye.  To many different types of seafood  like white Seabass lobster and scallops. I have noticed that every Morton's has the exact same menu no matter where they're located in the country. The mortons in Midtown has a decent wine list that will suit just about any pallet and the recommendations are free to pair with the food. They have a good selection of single malt scotch as well. Overall Morton's is a very solid steakhouse to have a great lunch or dinner. It's a nice place to go on a date. Staff is great and accommodating. Like I said in my review I have been to multiple locations across the country and I do continue to come back especially for that macaroni and cheese!!!!PROS:- great service- Mac and cheese is amazing!!- nice ambiance for a steakhouse- food is consistent at multiple locations  CONS:- you have to go into the basement level to use the bathroom.

She took both steaks away.  When the steaks came back the manager came with the chef to apologize, the steaks this time were so much better plus they gave us 2 extra side dishes.  There were no longer a drizzle of sauce on the steaks.  The side dishes were very small portion due to RW menu I guess.

4.0,1/31/2016,I am a fan of the Morton group.  They always take care of us when we go there and the service is always above average.  This was no exception. It has been a while since I had been to this location and I was reminded of why I liked it - almost a classic NY steakhouse but with modern twists and a really nice bar area!The salad was standard fare but as always fresh and crisp.  I like that.  The fillet was cooked perfectly and the accompanying baked potato could have fed several people...but it was nice to nibble and use some of the accompaniments.

3.0,1/20/2016,"This is specifically for their Restaurant Week 2016 menu. I checked out Ruth Chris' restaurant week offerings as well as Morton's and I must say that Ruth Chris beats them by a LONG shot. The service was attentive; however, the food didn't live up to the typical Morton's expectations and standards. I've had Morton's outside of rest week at a different location so maybe it's just the 5th ave one that's a bit off....We ordered the Morton's salad as an appetizer which was WAY too salty. Those anchovies did not complement the rest of the salad at all. Super bland salad with no appeal to it whatsoever. The tomato bisque was alright, nothing earth shattering there. Much to my surprise the filet mignon did not blow me away. It was far from the tender, juicy cut that I had at Ruth's. Thank goodness I went during Restaurant Week or else I would never pay that much $$$$ for this quality. Oh, and the cheesecake was ROCK HARD. I get it that it's Restaurant Week but don't make it so obvious that you premade a billion cuts of cheesecake and stuffed them in the freezer overnight or something. Morton's only saving grace is their bread that comes before the meal. That was one of the fluffiest, warmest and carbiest bread I've ever had.",2,1,0,Marianne P.,"New York, NY",422,41,198

This was not our first time at Morton's for New Years, so to get this type of reception was a shock. Rude manager, who was annoyed by our inquiries about whether it would be possible for us to have our table before New Years. Terrible food looked like it was done in the rush. Few bottles of champagne were thrown at us with few complimentary appetizers, so we could have something before the ball dropped, then the staff evaporated.

3.0,12/27/2015,"My friends and I came here for Christmas Day dinner. I thought the ambience was good and the food was good. Once of the things that really impress me about NYC restaurants is when they do not jam you in and that you have some elbow room between the tables which I was happy this restaurant did.I would say that I didn't think it stood out from other steakhouses that I have eaten at in the city but I would say it was good. I had the lobster bisque which was delicious and the stuffed shrimp which I would say was good but not outstanding. I thought the pasta that it was served with was overly salted and too rich. My friends had a steak which the enjoyed and crab cocktail which also was good. I thought the asparagus was standard as well as the corn. I did really like the au gratin potatoes. We had two children with us and they were very accommodating to them, bringing their food out quickly and custom making the mac and cheese without bacon for them. I felt that the service was a little slow otherwise and for the price of the restaurant I was hoping for something a little more WOW.

Their portions are decent size for restaurant week, even though some may think their 6oz filet mignon is a bit on the slim side. For me, it was perfect because I generally don't eat that much beef. I've also learned to ask for Medium instead of Medium Well.  It makes a big difference in terms of tenderness. I'm not ready to go for medium rare yet. I also went for the Tomato Bisque for the appetizer, which is surprisingly delicious for such a simple bowl of soup. As for dessert, you can never go wrong with the Double Chocolate Mousse. The only slight ""complaint"" I have about Morton's is their bread because it requires some work getting to it. It's not pre-sliced for you unlike other restaurants. It's a giant fresh onion loaf where you have to carve it yourself.

But the soft white mound of roasted onion bread with whipped butter the server put in front of me quelled all hanger. The bread was fluffy and light with a crisp toasted bottom. It held up well to the whipped butter and the refreshing but flavorful tomato bisque I chose for my starter.That whet my appetite proper for my entree. I chose the 6 oz steak, and it was cooked to medium rare perfection. I didn't care for the side of broccoli, it was a little too tough for me and I didn't like the seasoning.We ended off with a sweet note of key lime pie and chocolate mousse. The key lime pie had a nutty graham crust, but the filling was a tad too sweet.

1.0,7/29/2015,"I came here for NYE last year and had a great time. I found that they have restaurant week and my co-workers never been there. So I figure why not come here for lunch - BIG MISTAKE.First of all, we waited 25-30 min in between our appetizer and entree. You would think ordering from the restaurant week menu will be quick. I had medium-WELL pork chop. The entree came, the waitress asked if everything is ok. I didn't say anything coz I haven't even carved out my chop. Turned out it's more like medium-RARE. The waitress nor the manager were nowhere to be found. So I just kept eating the outskirt of the pork chop until they show up. I finished before I finally see our waitress. I asked her if she think this is medium-well. She said ""I think so, let me check"". She came back with a freaking attitude saying well, I came and asked if everything was ok and you guys said nothing. Really? I am surprised this kind of attitude is tolerate in this restaurant. She said I will ask the manager to come over. The guy came, doesn't even care even I told her about the food and the waitress. Just said I will take off the bill and took off!We didn't even have time to finish the dessert at the restaurant and had to take the dessert to go.I don't expect the management to care and write to me about this because apparently, the manager on site DO NOT CARE.

2.0,7/3/2015,"Coming to this Morton's I had high expectations. My fiance and I have been to Morton's many times in various locations. We have had dinner there countless times but this time we decided to come in to a new Morton's location for lunch. What a horrific experience it was. Other than great food, I expect quality service at five star restaurants. The service here was lacking to say the least. Our server was Viswarup. He walked over without introducing himself and asked if we wanted still or sparkling water. I asked for still water and a wine menu while my fiance asked for a Coca-cola. He then left and came back 15 MINUTES later- with one coke and still no water or wine menu. Ten minutes after that he came back and asked if I wanted still or sparkling water again. Normally, I wouldn't mind if the restaurant was busy. I understand sometimes it gets overwhelming. But there was was only TWO other tables besides us and another server. So 30 minutes into us being there I get water.We ordered off of the lunch menu: - French onion soup for him and Morton's Salad for me- Filet Mignon- Chocolate Mousse and CheesecakeThe French onion soup was delicious. However, my salad was inedible. It was drenched and dripping with sauce. The anchovies smelled revolting as if they were rotten. However, what was worse is that no one came over and asked how everything was going. The two waiters kept walking by our table to the other two tables and speaking with them but we were ignored. Finally, the other waiter walked over without a word and removed our plates. I asked if he was going to be taking care of us and he said no. So, I asked if he could instead bring me a soup because I literally had one bite of the salad and it was horrendous. We asked also for another soda.The filet mignons came and they were amazing. Tender, juicy, wonderfully prepared with mashed potatoes on the side. At that time I received a soup from the waiter with his apologizes- but still no soda.The dessert was mediocre at best. Just blah. Finally, we received another soda at that point. They did not ask if we wanted anything else to drink, coffee or tea, it was as if we were barely there.The reason this place is getting two stars is for the amazing filet mignon and beautiful restaurant (it was chic with a warm feel to it).

4.0,4/17/2015,"Overall a very good and pricey steak house!I came here for a work lunch and ordered the filet mignon. The filet mignon was very flavorful and did not need any type of steak sauce. I ordered it to order for Medium, however I felt it came out more Medium Well. I will not complain though because it was a very good steak. As a group we decided to order a few sides as well including the potatoes, asparagus, and spinach. All of the sides were very delicious; however they come separate from the steak so keep that in mind.In addition, we tried a couple of the desserts including the key lime pie and chocolate mousse. I am a chocolate lover and that was some good stuff! Coffee is $9 that I feel is a little too much so I didn't try it.One plus I will give is the bus boys and waiters are very attentive and ensure the table stays clean and clear plates. Let me tell you I can be pretty messy lol. The hostess was very nice as well and checked in our bag and jackets. Overall great experience and felt satisfied. If you can afford it or spurge every once in a while this is a good option.",1,0,0,Ahmed A.,"Jersey City, NJ",792,379,594
4.0,4/12/2015,"The food here is full of flavor, well prepared and filling. When you come you have to get steak. I know the seafood is supposedly very good, but it's a steakhouse. Splurge and get the steak because you won't regret it. You can always start with some seafood, like I did. I shared the tuna tower which was good, but I would try something else the next time since there were so many good looking appetizers and this one didn't blow me out of the water. I got the Rib-eye for my main meal and it was delicious. I prefer getting it without the bone since I think you get more meat this way and you don't have to eat around the bone. Plus, there is plenty of flavor in this and the bone doesn't add much, except price, for the steak. I couldn't finish mine (pathetic I know), but it was still great the next day! Any of the steaks are a good choice though. I also had dessert, a slice of chocolate cake, that the whole table shared. It was all delicious, but this is not a place I can go on a regular basis as I will explain now. It is expensive. There is no denying that. The drinks, wine and food are all pricey, but this is to be expected so don't count your pennies here. The other negative, which almost made me knock the rating down to three stars, is that the restaurant puts the calorie count next to every item on the menu! This is awful in my opinion and something I would change immediately. If someone wants to see this then he can ask for a particular type of menu. I go out to dinner to eat great food, not to worry about the calorie count. However, it blanked this out as best as possible as you might guess if you do go and look at the calorie count of the chocolate cake that I shared, but ate most of. Thank goodness the amazing bread doesn't have a calorie notice next to it. Overall, the food is great and the atmosphere is wonderful. It is pricey and there are a couple negatives, but I would recommend this to anyone looking for a very tasty dinner.",1,0,1,George S.,"San Francisco, CA",24,67,48

The appetizer was a salad, entree was a filet steak, and dessert was a key lime pie and cheesecake. We also ordered a bottle of wine as part of the special deal as well. The salad was not really spectacular. The steak was amazing. Do not be hesitant to order a steak cooked medium to medium rare. They know how to cook their steaks to the right temp. The key lime pie was our favorite dessert. Just the right balance of sweet and tart. A star is lost because the waiter made a slight blunder with our wine.

2.0,2/28/2015,"My fiance and I came here for restaurant week and the restaurant week options were diverse but the meal experience was aptly the description of the star ratings - ""Meh. I've had better."" Personally I find Statler better than this place in terms of the quality of the food. The fiance's steak could've been more tender and literally had no flavor! My shrimp pasta was good but was heavy on the oil.The onion bread and butter were delicious but I think the only highlight of the evening was the Palm Beach Passion drink and the butter that we dipped the pitifully sized lobster tail add on ($25!). The chocolate mousse was good but the key lime pie was just incredibly too acidic - I couldn't take more than 2 bites. Honestly when I go out to eat at a fancy restaurant I want to eat food that I wouldn't have any idea how to make and have it plated beautifully. This was not what I got but maybe it's because this American steakhouse doesn't put themselves at that level(?). I wasn't particularly impressed by the simple plating and unimpressionable flavor of the steak. Please tell me why you're a steakhouse?! The quality of the food did not meet anywhere near the prices. I gave two start because at least the service and the atmosphere were very pleasant. I wouldn't come back here again for these prices at the regular rate!

However my co-worker talked me into going to our 1st location pick for lunch (Mortons the Steakhouse on 45th ). So we went and checked out the restaurant week lunch menu. The outside gives you that old stuffy steakhouse feel but once inside it was pleasantly more modern. We got there around 2 and it was a nice mix of business corporate and business casual. Service here was very attentive and courteous especially being strapped for time, they brought everything out with enough time for me to get back to the office.  our server was micah (ask for him, he was wonderful) and the host was Richard, he came to our table spoke with us, asked if we were ok and recommended items for dessert. we thanked him and told him we had to rush out.For the appetizers, we ordered the Wedge Salads and the Tomato Soup.  Both good choices.  fresh and flavorful.Even though we were at a steakhouse, we did not order steak (had red meat the week before).  We all ordered different entrees and shared.  The Cajun Pork Chop was to die for...crisp on the outside tender and moist on the inside and well seasoned.  The Salmon was fresh with a vegetable and bean medley, cooked to perfection with a nice sear. and the Shrimp Scampi was garlicky and not too oily. overall the food was amazing and experience was exciting.

Whether entertaining business associates, having a casual dinner with your buddies, or a romantic night out with your significant other, Morton's suit you well.Crab Cakes and Shrimp cocktail are standard starters and very good. I'm a ribeye fan and both the Center-Cut & Chicago Style Bone-In are excellent choices. Creamed Spinach and almost any potato dish are great sides. I know none of this sounds adventurous but sometimes you just have to go with the basics and enjoy well executed dishes!Our servers have always been nothing short of excellent and very helpful with suggestions. Their recommendations are usually spot on (according to my meal companions who may ""veer away from center"" more than I do here) and they're very knowledgeable about the menu and what pairs well.

Morton's lost it's dominance and quality in exchange for portion control. I ordered what I have been eating for 20 years- filet mignon with mashed potatoes and mushrooms. I ordered rare and got a charred outside that was disgustingly burnt and medium. Potatoes were soupy and the mushrooms were okay. Wine portions keep dropping lower in the glass. AND the management seems a bit more arrogant. Very disappointing and now we remember why we stopped going there.Also, the class of  clientele of people on a Saturday night wearing sweats in an upscale steakhouse in Manhattan totally puts everything into perspective.

2.0,1/19/2015,"Either New Yorkers have low expectations, or I have too high of an expectation for the food and service. A high end steakhouse should at least have service. The service here was definitely lacking as I observe them go through the serving process. Our waitress seated us and left. She came back later and asked if we wanted bottle water or ice water. Then asked if we were ready to order. I wished she explained today's special or even go through briefly what is offered and what is available. Maybe even explain to us how we can order to share. She did non of this... but the table next to us had another server which performed all these steps. We ordered: - Chicago Style Prime Bone-In Ribeye- Center-Cut Prime Ribeye- Baked Stuffed Jumbo ShrimpThe starter bread, ""Onion Bread"" was delicious. It was heated/toasted and served with house butter. We even asked for a second. While we were enjoying our seconds, the steak came... All of us rushed to move the plates and the bread. I expected the waitress to clean the table, give us a heads up about the steak coming out. Clean the table that was full of breadcrumbs. etc etc...My ""Center-Cut Prime Ribeye"" (ordered medium rare) was a huge disappointment. The meat quality wasn't the best, it was chewy even on medium rare. I was having a sore jaw just from chewing and trying to find the juicy buttery prime taste, but there was non of that. I totally believe that my homemade steak (costco - USDA Prime Ribeye) slapped on the grill tasted better.  ""Chicago Style Prime Bone-In Ribeye"" was good, in fact.... Night and day difference... But, it wasn't my order. I only had a small bite, which left me hating my own order. ""Baked Stuffed Jumbo Shrimp"" was good as well. Came with pasta on the side. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that the chef did not prepare it all that well. He/She did not clean out the intestines. Apparently there was no deveining done and I had to remove that gunk. Aside from that, it was tasty. Anyways, this was my first experience at Morton's chain..

The CEO and national management should be fair to their female staff, as it is obviously this is an abuse of the female staff's right and  discriminatory.  This is not a place we will visit for its unfair discrimination to woman staff and the poor quality of food.    We were not offered a menu of burger and we were charged $25. for each burger which was extremely poor.",0,1,0,Fred E.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,14,8

The hash browns were taken back and re-served burnt.  2 stars (1 more than I would have normally given to any restaurant that would behave as though it was its first night serving food) because the steak was cooked exactly as I like it.    Morton's took the hash browns off the bill but I give Morton's no credit for that.   I should not have been served any ""hot"" food item right after it was taken out of the refrigerator.  Any 4 or more star designation by yelp or any reviewer is probably because they do not know what service at a 4 star restaurant is truly like.  Go around the corner to Strip House.",0,0,0,T D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,10,0

Very spit spot clean.Service: Amazing! Water was filled at all times, the waiter kept up with us and asked if we needed anything occasionally. Our table was kept clean after we destroyed the bread and left a mountain of bread crumbs. Onion bread: love the fluff. The butter that came with it was nice and soft. Onion soup: great onion taste and not to salty.  I suggest using the bread to dip in this soup.House salad: just like any old salad,  not much to it. Steak 6oz: this was to dry in my opinion for being medium rare,  more on the rare side. .. It was tough to chew and didn't have much flavor. Prime pork chop: if you thought the steak was dry. ..Oh boy this one won the dry mouth award.  Not much flavor...Cream corn: one thing I could count on was the corn! ! Good balance of sweat and salty. Mashed potatoes: this was alright. . Maybe I hint more of salt Key lime pie: this was on point!

4.0,3/5/2014,"3.5 stars. I'm not much of meat eater. I only check steakhouses out for their complementary breadbaskets to be honest. Nevertheless when my school's alumni association decided to throw a dinner party for us at Morton's, I was excited to check it out. The restaurant situated our party in the back private room (5 tables) which was beautifully set up when we arrived. As we mingled, two designated servers came in to take our drink orders and served us two types of passing hors d'oeuvres (tomato + house made mozzarella cheese and crab cakes) were served. The tomato was surprisingly sweet and the mozzarella cheese was really soft. The crab cake was a bit on the dry side but nothing a little aioli couldn't fix! We were soon seated and I noticed there was a printed 3 course pre-fix menu set up for us (perhaps it's the same one for RW?) Aside from the house salad, our party was allowed to choose out of 4 entrees (2 steaks, 1 salmon, and 1 chicken) and 2 desserts (chocolate mousse and fresh berries). Since I was in a steakhouse, I knew I had to go with the filet mignon. Before our 3 courses, my carb + seafood obsessed belly was jumping in joy when I saw that they started us off with their giant complimentary house made onion bread and a seafood sampler platter (oysters, crab legs, crab meat, lobsters, shrimp). The bread was so soft and the seafood was so fresh! I just couldn't stop especially one of the girls at my table didn't eat seafood (yay more for me). I was unbelievably full before my salad was even served! (Un)Fortunately the actual dinner wasn't as wow-ing. Out salads were drenched in dressing to a point where the lettuces were soggy. My medium rare steak was beautifully cooked but the seasoning/flavor wasn't there. I had to power through the meat just because and I needed a lot of hot sauce (yes hot sauce) to help. The berries weren't anything special - just a toss of handful of blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries onto a plate (ppl actually pay to get this as dessert?). Overall the 3 courses did reflect most RW quality. Morton's certainly didn't convince me to check out the rest of the famous steakhouses in the city.

It is very marbled and juicy! The potatoes Lyonnaise, bacon mac and cheese, and asparagus were also great sides (the asparagus is huge branches). The bacon wrapped scallops were delicious (wish it came with more than 3), and the ahi tower was good. The ahi tower tastes like a guacamole but with tuna and is served with fried wontons for chips--kind of a play on chips and guac. Not what I was expecting, but good nonetheless. I was shocked they did not have any beers on tap, but the wine and whiskey/bourbon options more than make up for that.

Morton's is a classic and legendary steakhouse, serving up only the best Prime-Aged Beef and seafood. The restaurant is sleek, dim, and features an open kitchen layout and large bar.We started with the oysters which were fantastic. They were served with an entire bottle of Tabasco nestled into the ice. Good move Morton's, I like you already. The bacon wrapped scallops followed. These of course, were great. The scallops were pan seared, wrapped in crispy bacon, and served on spinach for a pop of color. Next were the entrees. Morton's is a steakhouse and Kyle's NY Strip steak was amazing, but I couldn't decide if I enjoyed that or my Double Cut Rib Lamb Chops more... 3 large pieces of perfectly cooked lamb -- tender, juicy, flavorful, and perfectly smokey. Lamb chops are a favorite of mine, and I have had them at many restaurants (Pylos takes the spot for #2), the chops at Morton's may be the best I've ever had.  We ordered a side of their Lyonnaise potatoes, served pan fried with onions, and sautéed in butter with parsley. So good.We finished our meal with a classic dessert, the Morton's Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake. A warm chocolate cake, of course with a molten chocolate core, vanilla ice cream and raspberries.

The bartender then decides to tell me you can't take them to go. At this point I'm upset...what the heck?! You told me I could take 'em home. Needless to say, the bartender honored his word and I got to take the 2 home for my bf. For all of that...Morton's is good in my book.

3.0,8/9/2013,I came here last friday with my family after work for some drinks and appetizers. For a friday around 7 pm the place wasn't too crowded which was great.  The decor of this place is absolutely amazing but very ritzy and upscale. This place is very expensive so expect to spend a pretty penny.  I ordered the 3 mini prime cheeseburgers and the parmesan truffle fries. The burger was good but the parmesan fries were absolutely amazing. The flavor was incredible. I definitely recommend anyone going there to try those fries. For drinks I had the cherry bomb and my hubby had the cadillac margarita. Both were very good although my drink seemed to be overpowered a bit too much with the flavor of redbull. The service was good because our waitress was very attentive to us. Overall the food and service was ok but I prefer somewhere more laid back and alot less cheaper if I'm just going out for drinks and appetizers after work.,0,0,0,Natasha S.,"Bronx, NY",29,62,60
1.0,8/7/2013,"My husband and I came here for our one year anniversary and are only filled with regrets.  We booked the experience on open table, and my husband wanted to surprise me, so he made notes while booking indicating that it was a special occasion.  As we walked in, we were lead to the seating on the side by the busy bar, until my husband reiterated that we would appreciate a more 'quiet and appropriate' atmosphere.  We were then seated in the middle of the restaurant right in front of the Chef Station.  Watching the food preparation isn't exactly what we would call romantic.  Then it took 15 minutes for our waitress to come over and introduce herself.  Another 10 just to bring us a drink and a full half hour before she even offered us menus.  We were twiddling our thumbs so long we had to ask another waiter if we could have a set of menus.  We finally ordered appetizers and our waitress disappeared into the black hole yet again.  The tuna tartare arrived, which needless to say was a terrible choice considering my husband spend the rest of the evening in the restroom.  Another 45 mins later our food finally arrived, which based on our waitress's recommendation and my allergy to dairy, I ordered the Alaskan Halibut.  They needed to replace the butter sauce (seriously, why was everything is this place dipped in butter??  No wonder we have such an issue with obesity) with a white wine and caper sauce, which sounded great but arrived completely dry.  I made sure my husband agreed before mentioning it to the waitress, to which her response was ""do you want more of the sauce to put over it?"" Seriously??  I'm spending $200 on dinner and that's what you offer me??  Meanwhile, during this entire experience, after we had finished our drinks, we were never offered an additional drink with dinner.  Isn't that why people go out to eat??Needless to say, this will not be our go-to for any special events.  They could take a lesson from The Ritz Carlton on service, our best experience was at 42 in White Plains - they know how to treat a guest!",1,0,0,D S.,"White Plains, NY",1,15,0

Stay out of the dining room!The bar is right there, the minute you enter, to the left. Nice little tables with high stools. In addition to the regular menu, there's a Bar Bites menu with more than a dozen items. Bar items include Mini Crab Cake BLTs, Mini Prime Cheeseburgers, Steak Tacos, Filet Mignon Mini Sandwiches and more. I chose the Bar Bites Iceberg Wedge Bites, which was actually four small wedge salads on a single plate, with bits of bacon, tomato and egg, and a big pour of blue cheese dressing. Quite generous and tasty. It was enough for two to with one round of drinks. The bill came out to about 30 bucks before tipping. Not cheap but still in the afforable range.

It came that way and was definitely pork heaven. Thick and delicious and very nicely seasoned.  A real winner.    The  Lyonnaise Potatoes were outstanding, but my only complaint was that they came slightly cool.  I did not send them back though, although perhaps I should have.

It's actually on 45th between Madison and Park.

Our refills were brought by a pitcher that was warm tea, leaving us with no ice in the glasses.  We were splitting an entree because we each ordered two starters.  We were told that it would be no problem to have our order split onto two plates.  When our order came it was on one plate with a second empty one that had dried food on it.  When our server came to check on the food that was recently delivered she said that she would take it back into the kitchen and have them split it for us since that is what we asked for.  She came back and said that the kitchen refused to do it because it would be ascetically unpleasing. Leaving us to do a bad job of it at the table, make it look horrible.  There were many times throughout our experience that we couldn't figure out if we were at a nice restaurant or a fast food restaurant.  This was not a pleasing experience at all, and I will make sure not to let it happen again.",3,2,1,David H.,"West Hollywood, CA",113,102,107

Mine was really good until I bite into an avocado. I really hate avocado - the texture just grosses me out. I found a few more avocado pieces and gave them to my husband to eat (his salad did not have any avocado so they obviously gave us the wrong salads). I was going to just eat it but then the manager came over and we explained the situation and he said he would take it back. All was ok - mistakes get made and no big deal. Until the manager returned and informed me that the kitchen found no avocado in my salad and I must have been wrong - that it was cucumbers. So, at that point I was ticked off and just wanted to leave. They brought the new salad and I asked for it to be packed. They offered us dessert which we declined. So, rating is based on the manager insulting me and telling me I do not know what an avocado is. My husband's salad was delicious and our server was nice.

2.0,1/24/2013,"Morton's must take a long hard look at how this particular location is run. The service is absolutely awful!  We arrived 30 minutes prior to our reservation and proceeded to the bar to have a cocktail before ring seated.  The waitress in the bar area took our order and disappeared. 30 minutes later the host came in to let us know our table was ready and we still had no drinks (party of 8 and only 3 mixed drinks ordered).Once we were seated at a table that had been haphazardly jammed into a corner between the kitchen door, a non-working fireplace and the stairs, our waitress from the bar suddenly reappeared with our drinks....well almost all of our drinks.  Apparently, they had run out of a particular type of whiskey and needed to ""get more.""  Our waiter came to the table, introduced himself and offered to retake and fulfill the whiskey drink order.  He failed - returning with a drink that was straight up, not in the rocks as ordered.Throughout the experience, we were rushed. The waitstaff brought entrees to the table while we were still eating our salads (I'm talking half full plates)!  Out waiter also aggressively pursued his desert upsell to the point of being completely annoying.  I can appreciate the strategy involved in taking orders for a final course before any food has hit the table and that a soufflé takes time to prepare, but asking three times is just too much.  Having eaten at several other Morton's locations I feel it's fair to say that these guys are just WAY to pushy.  Another example of this unnecessarily pushy behavior was displayed every time our wine glasses were refilled. One member of our party was not drinking and made our waiter aware that she was taking antibiotics.  Do you think this stopped the waiter from pouring wine into her glass every time he handled refills? No, of course not.  The side dishes were as lackluster as the service. The brussel sprouts were particularly offensive as they were barely cooked (not Caramelized at all) and completely drowning in butter and pork fat.  even worse still, the bacon in the brussel sprouts was nearly raw.The saving grace was the beef! I ordered a bone-in ribeye that was cooked perfectly to temperature (at least the guy cooking the steaks knows what he's doing), nicely seasoned, and quite tender!  I was tempted to give this venue two stars, but the ribeye saved the day.All in all, you go to a place like Morton's expecting the service to be spot on. A table of 8 is going to spend money, you don't need to be pushy trying to squeeze $15 more onto the tab. Save that technique for Outback Steak House!  The money spent here would be much better spent at a place like Wolfgang's or better yet, the Minetta Tavern!

The service. Awful. Beyond awful. Never offered a drink or a refill. Had to go to the bar to get a glass of water. After waiting 45 minutes for our food, our waitress disappeared for another 45 minutes. Did not come around until taking our plates. We had to ask for a dessert menu--not offered. When ordering the hot chocolate cake we were smugly told, ""that takes 30 minutes and should have been ordered when your meal was brought out"". I'm sorry, Kellie, but you didn't tell us this. Nor did you bring our meal to the table. Regardless, we settled on the cold chocolate cake that would be brought out right away. Keep in mind we were deterred from the hot cake as it would take 30 minutes. The cold cake? Took 35 minutes to get to our table. It's a shame such horrible service in the front kills such high quality in the back. Won't be back to this location.",5,1,0,Shawn S.,"Baden, PA",13,25,4

4.0,11/14/2012,"I have been to this location several times. I would say the most consistent thing about this place is the service is always good. As for the food, I had some variations and quality twice was a concern. Bottom line, this is still a great goto place for a nice assortment of well cooked items.Salad: The morton salad being their signature dish should wow someone. I wasn't impressed... I was looking forward to this so much but the other times I tried different salads, the Caesar wasn't good at all in my opinion. Its not bad, but its not what I would expect them to deliver at a mortons. It almost seemed like a watery flavorless Caesar salad, but when done right caesar gets the right saltiness from the cheese and anchovies..etc.Seafood appetizers: I loved the shrimp alexander b/c it was simply a collosal shrimp grilled to perfection. Not over cooked or under, but the perfect light char with moist meat. The guest thought it was a tiny lobster tail it was so big. Crab Cakes: These are incredible, buttery with giant lump crab meat and very little filler. Balanced taste.. Definitely get it!Bacon Warped Scallops:  As much as I love scallops, these I would never get again, they were over cooked each time, rubbery and had a fishy smell. Which was very concerning as to the quality which I should never question at morton's.Soups: I don't remember but I think the others at the table had soups several times and everyone was wow''d with them. I can't vouch for them.Steaks: Double Cut Filet Mignon: I had this many times and I do love their filet but compared to other high end steak houses, morton's filets are very dry. Which leads me to believe they aren't the best of the prime cuts with good marbling. Others that also had single and double cut filets said the same thing. Which was disappointing when you are paying these prices. You would expect only the best of the best, but I guess at their size they do look for the cost effective prime cut. So they can promote they use prime which any top steak house must use. The steak was cooked perfectly, but if you take a mortons double cut vs Club A's filet mignon, the Club A steak house would run circles around this b/c the quality and flavor of the meat, all the char on the Club A is incredible, mortons is really good but these subtle things create the difference of good and great.Porter House: Its good, the chefs know how to get the steak cooked right. This had better flavor due to the bone, etc... Dollar for dollar, Club A still out shines mortons.. But do no get me wrong, these are steaks you would not be able to make like this at home, so try it out and compare. I don't like having my steak pre cut, its my personal choice.Sides: Creamed Spinach: Very fresh and good.. Its a steak house must.Baked potato: Where do they find them this size???? I thought it must have weighed 2lbs+Mushrooms: They were good, I think there was truffle oil or something b/c it had a very unique taste the one time I got themWe had I think 1 of each side, I can't remember them all but they do not disappoint. The only thing I do remember was either a potato gratin being way to salty.. Dessert: The mortons lava cake in incredible... Who in their right mind would not love a hot cake with hot chocolate in the center oozing out with vanilla ice cream?.. Its really really good.. Get this. We tried many of the other appetizers but this is something that you go out for. The others can be had at bakeries etc, but not this.So about this place, its mortons, if you have never been, its upscale, stuffy and full service. Its designed for people that want to have a upscale expeience, large wine list and the chefs highly highly trained to prepare your food consistently. The few times I went there and had variations were mainly on the quality of the source of the steak. One time it was pretty impressive and the others were dryer and less flavor. Don't let that discourage you.Bottom line... Just go!!! Also its great when they run their promotions that make your meal more affordable. Instead of dropping $125 per person, you can get their promos for $50-75/per person.",5,2,3,Phoenix X.,"New York, NY",338,220,29

The host was professional and very friendly, as well.When we were sat, our waiter and his assistant introduced themselves (Matt and George?) and then took our picture and gave us a nice anniversary card with the photo in it. They were very friendly and attentive. When we explained my wife's gluten-free needs, the waiter was very aware and made sure that he checked everything we ordered.On to the food:Amazing! We both had bone-in rib eyes. My wife had it plain and I had the truffle butter. The steaks were cooked to a perfect medium rare and had a mouth-watering crust. The truffle butter was beyond exquisite but my wife's regular steak was also delicious.The truffle shoestring fries were the best fries we have ever had. Just enough truffle and salt and they were piping hot, served in a paper cone wireframe Belgian-style.Creamed spinach and roasted Brussels sprouts with bacon were perfect steakhouse recipes and rounded out the main course.We had some complimentary berries for our anniversary to finish which were a bit hard and not too sweet. Not a detraction at all from the whole experience. They did look beautiful but the chef probably did not taste that batch.Overall, I would like to return with guests to give them the experience.

3.0,8/29/2012,"I had dinner with my team at Morton's Steakhouse on 5th Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. The service at this well respected national chain, that claims to be the best steakhouse anywhere was flawless.  However, I find the Morton's chain stuffy and the marketer in me thinks they seriously need a re-branding.I started my meal with the bibb lettuce salad ($11.50), knowing I'd likely overeat since portions at steakhouses always seem large.  Since I prefer seafood, I ordered the honey-chili glazed salmon fillet which came on a bed of beans, corn and spinach ($38).  Despite the ridiculously large size, it was cooked perfectly.  Its been my experience that some of the best seafood dinners have been at steakhouses and this dinner did not disappoint.Although I was full, the team went ahead and ordered two desserts to share.  I have to admit I tried not to be tempted, but I relented and while both desserts were very good, Morton's Hot Chocolate Cake made with Godiva chocolate was beyond decadent.

I ordered a Caeser salad; the portion was huge and it was tasty, but not the best I've had.  There was a slightly bitter taste to the dressing but that could be because it was made correctly instead of out of bottle like I'm used to :).  I ordered the filet & shrimp combination meal.  The presentation was lovely.  Unfortunately, I had ordered my steak medium rare and it was medium; very big difference. I'm sure it would've tasted just fine, but if I'm spending $50 on an entree, I expect it to be done correctly.  Call me crazy - I sent it back.  The waiter and the manager both came to apologize several times which was appreciated and a new steak was prepared correctly in a reasonably short time.  However there was no compensation offered for the fact that my food wasn't prepared as ordered or that my friend had to sit and watch me eat since she was finished by the time my meal arrived.  It was delicious, don't get me wrong, but I think I'll try another steakhouse next time.",1,0,0,Lynn G.,"Milwaukee, WI",9,43,0

2.0,6/22/2012,"First off I'd like to recommend you take my review with a grain of salt because I experienced Mortons as part of a business luncheon with around 50 people. I would hope that the experience is very different for normal diners. The attitude of the employees left a lot to be desired. The first thing that threw me was when the waiter asked one gentleman what he wanted and the guy asked if he could have a few minutes. The room was half full and people were still showing up but he was told no he needed order now. An acquaintance of mine didn't receive her tea she ordered and had to ask another waiter after about half an hour of waiting. Also when our plates were removed so were some of our knives, one diner commented to the waitress that he needed his knife back and she got snippy and said she would bring him a new one.The food was also somewhat hit and miss. The salad was one of the most disgusting things I've eaten in a while. Soggy iceberg lettuce soaked in tasteless dressing with egg on top, that was it. The filet I got was a bit overcooked and didn't really look all that appealing, it looked like 2 pieces had been up together. The potatoes were alright, the green beans were decent as well, and the cheesecake was passable. With all the steakhouses in the area I probably wouldn't return, I didn't really see anything special about it.",0,0,0,Matthew R.,"Manhattan, NY",151,749,53

3.0,6/10/2012,"Fortunate enough to have a vendor outing at Morton's The Steakhouse so lunch was covered. While I would not recommend either land line or wireless connectivity they have here for events, the steak is another thing. Presented with the option of filet mignon, chicken, or salmon I couldnt help myself to ask the waiter if this was a steakhouse. Of course, ordered the file mignon medium. Before the main course, received some fresh baked bread and salad. The baked bread was awesome and the caesar salad was not bad. The only disappointment is that they took the bread away before bringing the main course! The steak was served with some string beans and house style (ie, one bowl per table passed around) mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were a bit too creamy for my liking and I was asking myself if they were from powder. The string beans had way too much oil but then again should you care about eating healthy if you are eating a steak? The desert I picked was the cheese cake which was OK but would have been better if they remembered to give us coffee before desert! Service-wise they kept refilling the iced tea some had at the table but very rarely the water.While the steak is good, think everyone decided to never attend another work-related event here due to (a) poor network communications and (b) the 'dungeon' where they use for events has absolutely no cell connectivity (so all of our phones died from RF search and we were unable to respond to work emails).",0,0,0,George G.,"Carteret, NJ",24,547,0

The warm onion poppy bread was absolutely to die for. Our waitress was very knowledgeable, explained the menu, and brought out the food card to show us our options. While I understand why they show you the proteins so you can get an idea of size, I thought the live lobster was completely inappropriate. I'm not really a person who liked to look my meal in the face before I eat it. On top of that, I have a soft spot for animals of all kinds and to see something to pitiful was really heart-wrenching. I get it, it's a lobster, but there was no need for it to be sitting on a platter, suffocating all night. At that point I almost lost my appetite. Luckily I was able to move on from that and enjoy the rest of dinner. I had the smaller filet and it was incredible. Cooked to perfection and incredibly juicy. We shared a baked potato (the skin was a little too crispy for my taste) and the sauteed spinach. Both were tasty and HUGE. for desert we got their version of chocolate molten cake with haagen dazs ice cream.

I'd been to the Beverly Hills location to celebrate my mother's birthday a while back and knew it would be the perfect place to take my boyfriend for his birthday. Surely I wasn't disappointed. As a matter of fact, my expectations were certainly exceeded!I called the week before and spoke to the very sweet hostess to make my reservation and she told me about what the restaurant does for birthdays. I was surely excited and knew this would be the perfect surprise for my boyfriend. We had the pre-fixe three course dinner which had so many options. I had the wedge salad, crab cake and a butterflied fillet with the Morton's chocolate cake. All of which was to die for, especially the cake!  I'm a die-hard dessert lover and this cake is the best cake that I've ever had! It was actually one of the reasons why I wanted to come here since I'd been salivating over the cake since the last time I was here!!! !My boyfriend and I shared our two vegetables: brussel sprouts and garlic mashed potatoes. I'm not a big fan of brussels, but anytime anything is paired with bacon, it's surely a win-win situation and both were so delicious! By the way, the steak was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth along with the yummy onion bread!!The personalized birthday menu, framed picture at the table, and after-dinner drinks on the house were all extremely nice touches to round out a perfect night. Our server Darren was absolutely amazing, attentive, knowledgeable and humorous. I certainly think the best aspect of our meal was the fact that we weren't rushed and were encouraged to enjoy our meal and our time together which is a rarity at restaurants, particularly in New York City.The manager dropped by to wish my boyfriend a happy birthday, gave us a round of after-dinner drinks and gave us a business card to thank us for coming. I thought all of the exceptional service paired with the delicious food made this the best dinner experience that I've ever had. This restaurant is ideal for a special occasion as most of the patrons that were there that night were celebrating either a birthday or anniversary.

2.0,9/30/2011,"I really wanted to give this place only one star, despite their quality service and decent vittles. Why? Because they cart LIVE lobsters around on ""menu"" carts with their claws bound for no good reason. It is one thing to choose a lobster from a tank, it is entirely another to put one on a cart and make it suffer while lackadaisical diners decide whether to order a soup or salad while it slowly suffocates to death. It completely ruined my appetite.I have been to plenty of other perfectly delightful steakhouses and never, ever seen this done. If you choose to have a menu display instead of a printed menu, fine, it's cheesy, but some people like theatrical antics in a restaurant. I get it. But can't you put an already-dead lobster on there? Or maybe a nice replica? I mean, you don't put a COW on the cart, do you? You put an already-cut, nicely-presented steak. Having a lobster's plaintive eyes looking at me as if to say, ""Please, please help me, I'm in pain and I don't want to die"" during dinner is not the best way to get me to order expensive food. Or ANY food, actually.I can't comment on the quality of the food (my companions seemed to like it, though) because the live lobster suffering for no reason ruined my appetite. The second star is for the service. The waiter was extremely nice, we were seated swiftly, and my water glass stayed full throughout the meal even though I didn't order anything.

And if you read any of my review (Which you probably haven't), I always get a filet migon. The food comes earlier than expected, and they steak was SO good that i literally almost jumped out of my seat. It was as if the taste buds in my mouth had a fiesta (Okay, I know its a little corny, but it's true so shut up! ;))! The service was very kind and likeable, and thats why this definately deserves five stars.

Now, the prices at Morton's is to be expected, very expensive, which is why I only come here for birthdays and other special occasions. What we usually do is order the steak and seafood for two: each person gets a salad of her choice (Ceasar Salad is great), a choice of Shrimp Alexander, Scallops wrapped in bacon, or crab cake (my favorite) with an 8 oz. filet mignon or other steak cut of your choice with a side of your choice (i.e. grilled asparagus, mushrooms and onions, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach), and a choice of dessert (I always get the molten chocolate Godiva cake with Haagen Daz vanilla ice cream. All of that is priced at $110 plus tax, tip, and drinks. You want to save money, then drink water, or better yet, drink a bottle of vino before you go to the restaurant. The service is top-notch, and although I always know what I'm going to get, it's still great to watch the dinner selection presentation with all the raw cuts of meat (yummmm!). Every time I go, I am usually offered a round of drinks on the house to go with dessert, which is always a nice touch. Nothing wrong with a little Sambuca or Bailey's in your coffee. Anyway, the decor and atmosphere is awesome, and makes you feel like you're somebody important when you go in there, even if it's just for the night.

Oh yeah I got to eat a cesear salad too. The overall sense of the food was poor and tasteless. I didn't add any salt so I can really taste the meat and guess all of those years holding on to a PAST memory of something that I thought was good when I was younger. Why would you wrap a bacon on a scallop? It take away from the freshness of the scallop or I am sure it is frozen here and that why they don't mind doing it.

4.0,3/18/2011,"Part of why we're here -- not on this planet, natch, but reading/writing reviews on Yelp -- is because food consumption is far more than mere nutrition. It's also an emotional and aesthetic exercise. Otherwise we'd all be eating Special K power bars and look the same.Point being, Morton's -- for me -- is a great joint, but not particularly my thing. It's certainly a solid steak house -- their steaks are perfectly prepared, they're optionally paired with great, tasty sides, and they have a great wine list, excellent service, and they are are not snooty, aloof or over the top.Problem is, I just can't find the soul. It's sort of like driving a car that is perfectly fine but doesn't have that fire in the belly (say, a Honda as compared with a Porsche 911 Turbo). If you know what I mean, you'll realize that Mortons is a very, very good place, but probably not the end-all, be-all steakhouse. That, frankly, would be -- perhaps -- Keen's.If you're looking simply for a great location to hold a relatively corporate or proper, button-down event, dinner, lunch, meeting and don't have romance (or the urgent variations thereof) or serious, kick-back fun, this is a good choice. It's more than a good choice -- it's just sort of...meh.Take me to Sparks or Keen's or even The Palm (the original). Their steaks (at least Keens') are about as good, the prices are a bit less outrageous (so you'll save $17 by going elsewhere besides Mortons...you'll be able to go to the movies -- by yourself ;-). It's just, I 'spose, that Mortons feels very corporate, whereas Keens and Sparks feel as if you have as good a chance at being stabbed in the neck with a scallop fork or a medium cleaver as you do at not only enjoying your steak, the sides, the alcohol but the sheer lunacy of licking the plate(s) clean after the meal.Mortons -- like Keens -- has great service, wonderful steaks, very tasteful decor, a great selection of alcohol (drinks, wine) and absolutely nothing wrong with it.I'll be back, but the night before I'm scheduled for open-heart surgery, I'll be at Keens -- if you need me, I'll be the one staring out from behind the wall of Mutton ;-)",0,0,0,Boogie N.,"Manhattan, NY",39,151,10

Though one of us thought the steak needed sauce, i thought the steak was great without it. The only gripe i had was that my steak seemed to have a good amount of tendon which made cutting and eating of some portions slightly difficult. No one else had an issue so it wasn't bad. The other 1/6 of us had the NY Stripe steak which was also very good. The chefs prepare the steaks perfectly to our liking and i loved the tenderness of my medium rare :)The appetizers were a little on the small side, but the sides were normal size for a steakhouse. The molten chocolate lava cake was delicious and so was the belgium chocolate mousse :) The upside-down apple pie was nothing special, i would've traded it for another molten cake (at the same price!). But remember to order these special desserts with your meal bc it takes 40 min to make!Overall I had a wonderful experience at Morton's.

The service it very much lacking at the 5th Ave. location. We walked in the door, the lady pointed at a table across the room and told us to sit. Ugh! My wife asked me if we were at McDONALD'S. We chose a different table, thinking the excitement was over for the night, until our wait staff started. We knew the menu better than they did, glasses we dirty, and when they took my wife salad plate away there was a nice black ring left behind on the white table cloth.

4.0,5/16/2010,"If they didn't have a $50 offer, do you think I would actually give them 4 stars?Its not often that you get a 3 course surf and turf special at a steak house for $50, so when my gf's friends mentioned it, I had to come, even though my expectations were not high. Morton's is one of those places where its probably been around forever, but I never would have stop by because their name just isn't connected with superb quality of meat, like Lugers or Keens or Sparks. They are kind of a like a 2nd tier steakhouse like Bobby Vans and Ruth Chris'. Chains that scatter along midtown and dwell on the corporate cards that its diners flash at the end of a meal.Here's what I ordered:Morton's salad - Too big of a salad, did they really expect someone to finish the salad and have a steak afterwards? It also had too much cheese. The only thing that I liked about it is the 3 slivers of anchovies which they asked if I was okay with before I ordered it. I barely finished 1/2 of it.Double Cut Filet Mignon and Maryland Crab Cake ($6 extra for the the double cut) with grilled asparagus for the side- The crab cake was crap. I enjoyed the bacon on the bacon wrapped scallop that my gf ordered more. I'm not the biggest fan of crabs because of all the work to eat it, but the crab cake had no taste to it. Big fail. The Double Cut Filet is huge, and if they cut off the chewy burnt edges, you really do taste the quality, although it still isn't as tender as the perfectly aged meat from Luger or one of its off-shoots. The asparagus is exactly that, grilled. Almost if it was too much work for them to do anything else with it.Molten chocolate cake and Keylime pie - heart attack good! Why didn't my gf's friends tell me that this is the best part of the meal? The chocolate cake is really delicious, with Godiva chocolate, although they are no longer allow to advertise that in the dessert (haha, Godiva wants it name back), as the waiter pointed out when my gf's friend asked about that. But it really wasn't the name that made it so good. It was simply the tongue burning chocolate oozing out of the cake that only the sweet but cold vanilla ice-cream can mend that really made this earth shattering good. But what if you are not a chocolate fan? No problem, the Key lime pie (my gf ordered that) is spectacular in its own right. Rich, thick, creamy with a nice thin layer of graham crack crust on the bottom and plenty of whipped cream on top, we probably should have just asked them to pack the dessert to go since we were so stuffed that we couldn't finish either.So would I come back? Not any time soon, which is sad since this $50 deal is only good til 6/30. I thoroughly enjoyed the meal, but the salad was overwhelming and the crab cake was a fail. At least there's a lot of value to this. Maybe I should ask to have them pack the salad and the dessert the next time they have this deal so I can just eat and enjoy better than average steak and (hopefully) a better surf item.Date Visited: 5/14/2010Decor: 3 out of 5Service: 4 out of 5Food: 3 out of 5Value: 4 out of 5 (It still cost $83 after tax+tip+upgrade to double cut+a beer)",4,1,3,Jack N.,"Brooklyn, NY",155,352,129

My boyfriend ordered the prime rib which can only be ordered on Fridays and Saturdays.  We specifically picked a Friday so that we can order the prime rib.  He asked for a medium rare but after cutting it in the center we noticed that we had received it in a medium well.  Very disappointing.  What was even more disappointing was that after we had sent the prime rib back to order another one, the host came to our table to inform us that they had sold out of the prime rib.  So he ordered the New York Strip Steak instead.  Our waitress was very apologetic and gave us a complimentary shrimp cocktail while we waited for his steak.   For dessert we had the hot chocolate cake which was actually the best part of the meal.  Overall, the service was great and the food was good.  Would have gotten 4 stars if we had actually gotten the prime rib.",1,1,1,Susan C.,"Mineola, NY",82,25,0

5.0,5/6/2008,"One of the best meals I ever had!Service was beyond excellent, food was delicious, music was good (Ya gotta like Frankie).I had the porterhouse.  Big ol' piece of meat cooked to perfection, with a big plate of hash browns on the side - also very yummy.It wasn't cheap, but it was worth it!",1,0,1,Ramon V.,"Windsor, CA",5,118,83
5.0,4/25/2008,"Morton's Midtown restaurant is better than any Morton's across the country. I love coming here for a good steak and honestly believe that it is one of the best steakhouses in New York. Quieter, with a calmer feeling then the Post House and Smith & Wollensky, Morton's Midtown is a perfect place to bring a client or catch up with good friends. The steaks are tender and cooked to perfection, the service is wonderful, and my dining experiences here have been nothing but enjoyable. It deserves 5 stars, and will always have my patronage.",1,1,1,Alexander P.,"New York, NY",4,51,0
5.0,3/7/2008,"oh man i had such a good time, service was great!!...my friend knows the actual owner of Mortons, so we had a reserv area and an amazing free meal..not to mention it was my friends bday and they had a cake brought in for him, so sweet...we love Mr. B!!fresh food, i had the salmon of course, but i tried the steak..all was really good!!",1,0,1,Sahara D.,"Manhattan, NY",160,389,6
4.0,3/4/2008,"It was a nice experience...I'm not a big fan of filet mignon but for some reason I ordered that..and it was soooo tender and juicy.  Their fresh bread was huge and it looked like a big pillow...I almost ate the entire thing myself! For dessert,  I had the godiva chocolate souffle which you have to order together with the entree because it takes them 30 minutes to prepare....it's good, but not orgasmic good.  I feel like a lot of restaurants make the chocolate souffles with vanilla bean ice cream now, so it doesn't really impress me.  Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this place.",0,0,0,Monica T.,"Forest Hills, NY",32,118,8
4.0,11/4/2007,"3.75 stars.My porterhouse (I ordered it medium) was tender and very flavorful, but slightly too burnt on the outside (I can't remember the last time I tasted that much charcoal in my steak).  My shrimp cocktail was tasty, but pretty standard.  The Caesar salad was pretty good, but also standard.  The side of sauteed spinach+mushrooms was delicious.  I liked the bread, even though I had to slice it myself.The 2nd time I had the NY strip steak (ordered it medium plus), and while still tender and very flavorful, it came out MUCH rarer than I thought it would be.  So I ended up just eating mostly the outside of the meat and leaving the inner, more rare parts on my plate.  What a waste  =( .  I also had the ""Morton's"" salad which basically was lettuce with blue cheese dressing, anchovies, and chopped egg.  The salad was just ok.  I liked the mashed potatoes: ight and fluffy, with just enough butter to taste (not too much) and the green beans were pretty good too.  For dessert I ordered the ""mixed berries"" which was just some strawberries and raspberries with a dab of whipped cream to dip it in.  But my friend's cheesecake was delicious!  Quite sweet, not-too-rich, probably one of the best cheesecakes I've had (and I'm not really a cheesecake person).Note: my friend also ordered the NY strip steak (well done) and it came out as a MUCH thinner cut of meat than my NY strip steak.  I didn't know the actual cut of the meat would be different.Overall, pretty good, although I was slightly disappointed with my steaks.Maybe I was expecting too much.",1,0,0,Junkfoodie Q.,"NY, NY",12,372,0
4.0,9/17/2007,"This place is a real treat.   The ambience is perfect and not brightly lit and loud as it is at most steakhouses.  The shrimp alexander is too die and the tomato salad with blue cheese had big, red, juicy tomatoes which are hard to come by year-round.   You would be hard pressed to find any fat on the strip steak AND this is one of the few steak houses in NYC where you can get lobster tails (usually you have to order a whole lobster).  The tails were gigantic and perfectly cooked.  We ended with the cheesecake which was so light and delicious.  One star missing because the steak was not as seasoned as I like it, but all in all it was an almost perfect meal.",1,1,1,lisa S.,"New York, NY",55,95,0
3.0,12/2/2006,"We had our company holiday dinner here this week. The private room was quiet, the wait staff swift and the food was fine.The salad came with all too much dressing for my taste and the sadly, I found the bread to be too heavily herbed, but the lamb chops were cooked perfectly.Go for the meats - they seemed to be the best of what was offered. (Please note that we had a limited menu to choose from as it was a party.)March 2008 --- I was taken here for another company party. Still dissapointed. The steak was over cooked on one half. Don't they specialize in steak?Unless it's a work event - I won't go back again. There was so little value for the high price.",1,0,0,Kimberli M.,"New York, NY",124,423,156
4.0,8/28/2006,"I love Sinatra but if you don't he's going to drive you nuts! That's all these guys seem to play. Luck be a lady tonight... luck be a lady tonight! No luck needed here.  I love their Fillet Mignon ""Steak Dianne"" with HUGE asparagus, buttery mashed potatoes, and a sinful chocolate (Godiva) hot molten cake (ask for strawberries and vanilla ice cream on it, it makes it that much better). There are plenty of other steak houses in town but if you've been here before and don't want to be adventurous it's a good safe bet! Date Rating: 8Pick up Scale: 3  (8 if you're a beautiful business woman who likes men in suits, try the bar after work, ladies choice) Strong Suggestions: Call for a reservation if you want a table during the typical dinner hours.",4,2,1,Megan C.,"New York, NY",4019,835,1062
4.0,4/11/2006,"Went here almost every week when I was in NY.  You can not go wrong with the steaks here!  I've ordered the double fillet mignon and have never been disappointed.  As accompaniment, I've ordered the asparagus with the hollandaise sauce!  YUM.  During one of my visits there, I ordered the molten cake and when I cut into the cake, the  chocolate did not ooze out.  My server immediately informed me that I will get a new cake because the cake is ""suppose to ooze with chocolate.""  I was impressed with the service and food.",0,0,0,Mishee D.,"San Jose, CA",46,243,186
3.0,11/9/2005,"The steak (double cut filet) was delicious here, but several of the other items on the menu fell a little flat. Scallops appetizer was overcooked, spinach was tasty but lukewarm. The hollandaise sauce was excellent but the peppercorn cognac sauce disappointed. The desserts were only so-so. I think there are better steakhouses in NYC for a great overall dining experience, but if you're just looking for good MEAT, you can't go wrong here!",0,0,0,Steve M.,"New Hyde Park, NY",3,528,0
