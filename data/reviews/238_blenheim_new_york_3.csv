4.0,4/14/2019,"Very cute little New American (with seemingly a little French flare?) restaurant in the West Village. Came on a Tuesday during the day to sit down for a quick, small bit. Weather was nice and it was great to sit outside. Brunch or Lunch menu had 3 toasts to sample for $21 which was enough for the two of us to have something to munch on. Nice space inside and out. This restaurant is far more upscale/expansive into dinner it looks like. All farm-to-table from their own farm upstate.

1.0,3/30/2019,"Horrible service. We were excited to try on a sunny afternoon and were told there were two in front of us and it would be about a 20 minute wait. Completely reasonable. Asked the host if he needed a name and he said no. We waited outside, saw the two others be seated and then they seated a third pair. We went back to the host stand and explained to the manager who then went and told the host. The host asked what we needed and he acted like he'd never seen us. He then said ""you've been waiting out front?"" We said yes and then he just walked away, no apology, no promise to seat us soon, so we left.",0,0,0,Lee S.,"New York, NY",2,6,0

4.0,3/18/2019,"Found this gem walking to the Whitney on a Sunday morning. Opted to eat here because while I am not a big breakfast food person the brunch offerings looked a bit more interesting than some of the other places that we passed. I started with the Bloody Blenheim which is their take on a Bloody Mary which was lovely and made with gin rather than vodka. If you want a salad sticking out of your glass, this is not it, but for a hearty morning cocktail it was on point with a lemon and olive as garnish. My friend and I asked the waitress for recommendations and she steered us mostly to dishes that have pork as that comes directly from their farm upstate. We both ended up getting the hash which although looked on the small side was filling enough.  Enjoying the quiet atmosphere and the fact that no one was in any hurry for us to leave I ordered a glass of rose which they poured at the table offering a taste first. Always appreciated.From where I was sitting I could see the bar tender making a beautiful purple drink and so we inquired about it and she told us it was a Purple Butterfly soon to be on the menu. She made us a sample which I will be back for come spring!",0,0,1,Sharon S.,"New York, NY",2,106,132
1.0,3/17/2019,"I live in West Village and I was not impressed by this place. I stopped by for the first time last Sunday night for dinner and everyone seemed SO stressed out. I sat at the bar and the only presence I enjoyed was the bartender with blue hair. Despite it being a slow night, my food took awhile to arrive. The pan roasted chicken breast was dry and the beef tartare was disappointing (coming from someone who has sampled beef tartare at many spots throughout the neighborhood, including Employees Only etc). Would not recommend this place to my friends, and again, I found it funny that the blue-haired bartender was the only one with a calm demeanor amidst a chaotic environment - despite it being a slow night!

4.0,2/25/2019,"Brunch was quite delightful. The simple farm to table menu ethos carries though with the decor - comfortable and quiet. Servers are attentive and warm. The food is not quite rustic, but not trying to be elegant. Wonderful ingredients from their own farm (""grown to order"", they claim!) are simply served without much adulteration, and the result is delicious. It's the sort of food you might expect to  get served in a country bed and breakfast upstate. Baked eggs and short rib hash were the stand out items.",0,0,0,Jay H.,"New York, NY",195,72,0

Ultimately was there for over 3 hours just to get through our meal which came out to almost $400 in the end.

4.0,2/17/2019,"Cozy, modern. Fast and friendly service. Coffee and water refilled frequently. Brunch Pain Perdu. Soft, warm and fluffy. Wasn't dry, unlike many others. Could be more egg-y or milky, but I liked it. The blueberries are giant and sweet! And apparently they just keep on getting the giant blueberries. Classic maple syrup, can't go wrong with that. Smoked bacon was tasteful and incredibly crispy.  Some small parts were a little thick so it was hard as a rock. Otherwise, some good bacon. Fruit bowl was filled with pear, apple, orange, blueberries, and grapefruit. The only sweet fruits were the pear and blueberries, of which there were very few (pear was a few paper thin slices). Most definitely not worth the money.",0,0,0,Elei Z.,"New York, NY",109,90,487
5.0,2/15/2019,"Came here for dinner during the week, and was very impressed with the food and service. In particular, a few of the the vegetarian dishes were excellent (highly recommend the roasted cauliflower with pepper appetizer and the fava bean falafel). The food is also locally sourced from a farm, which is another plus. With the appetizers being very good and the local sourcing, it would be nice to see more of the creativity with vegetables and grains carry over into the main courses; hopefully they'll keep experimenting with that.Overall highly recommended for a locally sourced meal in a cozy restaurant.",0,0,0,J W.,"Arlington, VA",0,30,0

Overall, the restaurant was nicely decorated but still cozy. The brunch was your standard options: bacon, eggs, sandwiches, etc. Much of their food is sourced from a farm that they also have, which is pretty cool and sustainable.

1.0,11/29/2018,"The Thanksgiving dinner I hoped I newer would have suggested! I don't even know where to start, our party of 9 had our worst Thanksgiving dinner we ever have had. After having had a rough year we decided to make it easier and take our family out for dinner, since we honestly didn't have the strength to cook up our regular feast. Blenheim is close to us and we love their idea of having their own farm. Menu sounded great and we thought we were in for a treat. We were greeted by so,done who seem totally overwhelmed and a tall skinny guy finally found our reservation and got us seated. Our waiter started by telling us that he was new ""so I apologize if I can't answer all your questions, but I will do my best. Fair enough and cudos for him to fessing up. One of our guest asked what comes from their farm and was told by the same waiter ""the sunchokes"". That was it! It turns out nothing else on the entire menu comes from their farm? We chuckled and asked the waiter to double check and he returned after checking with the same confused person who could not find our reservation, and said yes ma'am only the sunchokes. So the whole farm to table idea is it just a lie? The food we ordered was cold, took for weaver and after knowing that it's a scam; I can truly say that it was a disaster!!!! I also looked into reporting them to the better business bureau since it's a scam! I will definitely tell all my neigborgs to spend their money elsewhere, and to think that all the times I have been it was all a lie......We almost decided to have our daughters wedding at their venue upstate, but who knows is that also all a scam. I definitely will make it my mission to find out, and whe. I do I will update my review.

3.0,10/3/2018,"Michelin star rated huh? Let New Yorkers be the judge of that. We happened to stumble on this place early on a Saturday afternoon looking for a brunch spot in the west village and chose this. This place is very cute with surprisingly ample space inside and outdoors. As mentioned in other reviews, they have a confusing method of having 2 people serve you. Also they seem disorganized as they were out of certain things first thing as soon as they opened and they weren't sure what those things were until we asked for them. Super simple requests: almond milk, a certain beer etc..... so a bit of advice to the staff: Check to make sure everything on the menu is available before opening. The food was just ok. We ordered eggs Benedict and the French toast. Everything tasted very fresh. Which is nice. I understand the lack of seasoning since you want all of that farm fresh food to shine. That was actually fantastic. I'm just unsure it would be anything to rave about and make me want to come back again.",1,0,0,Tai R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3,47,89

My only hesitation about the 5 star review is that their wine prices are ridiculous! Most of the time I either order their roasted chicken or pork two ways, however the short ribs are to die for. Always had very good service and the staff are all very nice, the manager knows me and normally seats me in my favorite waiter's section. You can tell that they have a lot of regulars, everyone seems to be greeted by name or welcome back.

Unfortunately we were disappointed with both the food and the service. We ordered the brussel sprouts and fried chicken snacks to start. The brussel sprouts were undercooked and underseasoned. They were kind of bitter. The chicken had this ""sweet"" glaze on it and I found it very pepper-y and unpleasant. My boyfriend didn't mind it as much, so to each their own. We split the poached farm egg with spaghetti squash carbona appetizer as our entree and it was also disappointing - bland and also underseasoned. We also waited nearly an hour for our first course to arrive despite the fact that it was late and not very busy.

2.0,4/8/2018,"After trying, for a long, LONG time to like, and ""understand"" this restaurant.  I'm giving up.  Last night, was the last straw.  Please note that  this is a review based on at least six visits, two good, four, not so much.Three and four visits ago, they had adults working there.  They knew what they were doing, acted, well, like adults, and took care of customers.  Lately, it feels like the staff graduated a week ago from restaurant school.  Two visits ago, the ""manager,"" took 15 minutes to find our reservation while the line backed up.  This time, he couldn't find it, period.  His catty comment ""you're in luck, I have room tonight"" was only half right.  He had room.  We were not in luck.Things started ok.  We got the menus, ordered drinks, and the waiter gave us the special.  We studied, and ordered. That's when we find out, for the first time, that one of the five appetizers, is not available.  It's pasta with a sauce.  I had my stomach set on pasta as a first . ""Ok, so can I have the gnocchi with another sauce?""  ""No, I just told you we don't have gnochhi.""  Well, then I see you have pasta with another sauce.  Can I have THAT pasta with a sauce?"" ""I'm afraid we can't do that.""  ""Ok.... can I have the main course pasta, but as an appetizer portion?"" ""I'd be happy to bring you two main dishes, but I can't make a smaller portion.""  WOW.  He then explains the plusses of the appetizers he DOES have.  I order one, and the hamburger.  ""How would you like that? ""  My response is ""Medium rare.""  I laugh to my partner because we had been at Union Square the night before, and the price of the hamburger there ( a BEAUTIFUL thing, with a brioche roll, piles of fries, bacon and cheese), is the same as here. Let's just say, Blenheim is no Union Square.  Appetizers are good.  Mains are not.  Our waiter forgot to tell us that the special had mint in its sauce.  My partner is allergic to mint.  My medium rare burger, is so overdone, it's black at the center.  Ketchup doesn't save it. My partner deals with the mint sauce by scraping it off.  I decide my dinner is going to be roasted potatoes.  The 14 year old manager comes over to ask how things are.  I tell him not good and show him the burger, and I ask  ""is that medium rare?""  He says ""no, but you didn't order medium rare."" I tell him  ""Yes, I did.  If your waiter wrote down something else, that's his problem, not mine.""  ""Well, can I replace the burger?  Can I pay for it?  Can I bring you a free dessert?""  Frankly, at this point, all I want to do is leave.  I tell him ""No, I ate most of the burger, just let me have the check and we'll leave. No such luck.  We can't leave until we have the ceremony of the dessert menus, which we simply hand back.  Now, and only now, may we have the check (and, to be fair, he took the burger off the bill, which I told him not to do).  No apologies, no nothing, just get us out of there as fast as possible.    At least in getting us out fast, you did the right thing.  I'd say  ""see you later,"" but I won't.",2,1,1,Norman H.,"New York, NY",101,75,0

1.0,12/19/2017,"I dined at Blenheim last night with my husband and his business partner. While the food was quite tasty, I have never received such poor service in a restaurant before. It took forever for the server to come over and take our order and she was incredibly unknowledgeable about the menu. This was even more difficult because I have dietary restrictions, so knowing if unpasteurized cheeses or raw egg is included in a dish is essential. Additionally, we received the wrong squash appetizer and had to ask four times for our broccoli appetizer, which finally came out over two hours later with our entrees. The restaurant was practically empty, so this poor service was even more surprising. My guests ended up going to the bar to order more drinks because the server also did not frequently visit our table. While I love the farm-to-table concept, and loved some of the dishes, the service was so terrible and I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone.",0,0,0,Kate P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0
5.0,12/18/2017,"It was supposed to be ""a couple of Appetizers and Drink night"", but it turned out to be a super awesome and friendly dinner. We'd finished with a quick errand and were tossed between Blenheim- that seemed calm from the outside and a jam-packed restaurant right across the street. We instead went for the underdog. And Boy...was that a really nice move. I almost wanna wait for my next outing to give you Blenheim's complete experience. But then again, what's so wrong about letting you know now? We had Blenheim pretty much to ourselves, with the exception of 2 young ladies off to one side having dinner. Greeting was instantly warm. Place is so freaking cute: it's elegant but with a mixture of rustic, a bit of soft and some chachkies thrown in. My girl Juliette in all her Frenchness, was chatting it up with us about her likes for House Music and we even suggested some hot spots she should check out in BK. And Raul (OhmyGod) a straight up Puerto Rican brother right from the island, had all this freaking charisma in everything he did. He is the main Bartender though, but gave us a twofer (also as a server) on a Sunday night.I usually complain about my drinks, but damn....both my 'Soul Of Jalisco' and 'Blondie' cocktails, were perfectly prepared with sweetness and strength. My Ricotta Gnocchi Appetizer with toasty breadcrumbs and the most subtle chile heat- turned out to be melt-in-my-mouth! While my husband, was satisfied with his Braised Short Rib, Pommes Puree and Mushroom Stew. Blenheim has the look of a romantic setting, a meeting of some sort or a cool hangout spot. Music was an outrageously sexy mix of The Cure, Reggae and more New Wave. So I'm not gonna start nitpicking about dollar amount this, small portions that---but it's just how they do in the W. Village. Am I being a bit delirious then-with a 5? Hmmm...maybe...maybe not. But it's all about the experience at that moment- whether it's the first time, second or even third. Right? Listen, I'm not going buck wild just because the brother is Boricua, or that we talked endlessly about his struggles during Hurricane Maria. But I'll give credit to where it's due and being kind has no color, no race.

3.0,11/23/2017,"Came here for thanksgiving dinner. It was a fixed menu and we made reservations far in advance. The disappointing part of the meal was the dessert. They ran out of all 3 options on the menu and offered some other various things they seemed to have thrown together last minute. Having picked the restaurant after looking at the fixed menu, we were very disappointed, however, we decided to try the chocolate cake and cheesecake they offered us. Both of these were NOT up to the standard of a 5 star restaurant or even to the standard of the rest of the meal. We did not end up eating the desserts. Because we were not offered the entire 4 courses on the menu or offered a dessert of equal quality, it would have been nice to have been offered to adjust the price to remove the dessert. We had to ask for this price adjustment and then argue to get it which was very uncomfortable. We were eventually offered a price adjustment of $10 per person off the fixed price of $95 for the dessert. I was very upset that I had to complain/argue to receive this and would have been more satisfied if this was offered initially. The manager mentioned there was a new chef and they were having issues with the desserts. This issue clearly detracted from the value of the meal and I did not feel the issue was managed effectively. The other food we had was good but the quality of the dessert and the management of this issue led to this review.",1,0,0,Phoebe L.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,2,0

2.0,9/24/2017,"My family group of 6 had dinner at Blenheim on a recent Saturday nite.  We were excited by the farm to table ethic and Michelin recommendation.  I am sorry to say our experience did not live up to our expectations.  While the snacks and apps were very good, the entrees were over cooked and even the cooked veg on the entrees  were mistreated and mushy....so sad for a farm to table with supposedly the best ingredients at their disposal.  We loved the fried chicken snacks and squash blossoms; these were a highlight.  But it was clearly the service that ruined our experience.  It started out with a few minor faux pas such as different version of the menu given to us at the same table including a dessert menu mixed in and missing silverware at 2 place settings.  This could have been overlooked.  But things deteriorated quickly.  The waitress was slow and often absent for long stretches of time.  While water glasses were filled often, they were filled with a pitcher that allowed water and ice to spill out on the table and floor.  Silverware was cleared twice, but was replaced with random assortments with none of us getting a full set of silverware.  One of us got 2 forks but nothing else,  one got a fork and spoon but no knife.  The plates for 2 of the appetizers and one entree had large chips in them that were unsightly at best and unsanitary at worst.  We were offered cocktails and wine twice before the meal, but then not again until we were almost ready to leave.  The restaurant is decorated very nicely, but in the back room where we were seated we found a small deli carton of mortzarella cheese and someone's personal laptop and folios left beside our table.  We handed the waitress the cheese carton making a joke that we didn't want extra cheese, but instead of removing it she put it back next to me!  We finally asked another of the wait staff to remove it.  By the end of the meal the number of service errors were comedic in scope.  Needless to say we cannot recommend this restaurant....so disappointing.",0,0,0,Marty A.,"Shutesbury, MA",0,1,0

5.0,8/15/2017,"This is a genuine five-star restaurant, and readers should notice that some of the less starry judgments are based on slow service.  It's clear that Blenheim has explained to its staff what first-rate service is, and my companion and I found nothing lacking.  Even the young man who cleared our plates (after asking politely) was articulate and friendly.  The manager came over and inquired in the most heartfelt way about how our dinner was, and he was interested, not formulaic.  We were shown to a spacious corner table (unlike other places, Blenheim does not jam its diners in to raise the trendy-rating) and we could hear our conversation, a bliss in itself. I don't know how my companion's wine was, but my craft cocktail of gin, lime, lavender, and grapes, was delicious -- ample and potent, no need for a second.  You'll notice I've left the food for last.  The best.  We had dinner during Restaurant Week, with a three-course prix fixe for $42.  Everything was marvelous -- the quality of the ingredients, the way the dishes were plated, the balance of flavors and spicing, the overall freshness, the intelligent and gratifying inventiveness of the cookery -- not so elaborate as to interfere with the essential combinations, but everything subtle, delicate, memorable.  My companion had the corn soup which was savory and not too sweet, with lovely slices of purple potato; I had the steak tartare which, had it been on the menu as an entree, would have been divine on its own terms -- beautifully seasoned and ground, and wonderful beef.  For our main courses, she opted for the pork, which was beautifully done, and a substantial portion; I had the diver scallops, again, well-handled, with fresh pea shoots and more corn.  Blenheim was out of the advertised chocolate dessert, so we were given a scoop of watermelon sorbet (or ices?) and basil panna cotta.  I left some of mine over, which is not like me, but the food was so satisfying and filling.I'm not a friend or relative, and neither of us had been to the restaurant before.  But it was a wonderful experience in every way.",2,0,0,Michael S.,"Great Neck, NY",0,92,0

2.0,5/15/2017,"The waitress, for the eighty seconds she was willing to devote to us, was very pleasant. After our initial introduction we caught fleeting glimpses of her plying her trade on other tables. At some point she vanished and we were left to assume she'd stepped aboard a steamship to start a new life in Morocco.During the course of the waitress's slow-motion disappearance, the hostess assumed the role of backup waitress. She did well but not perfectly. I had to track her down when it was apparent that, like some waitresses, our drink order had vanished. Speaking of drinks - $16 for a Bloody Mary is remarkably steep, Tito's vodka or not.We opted for the three-course Mother's Day prix fixe menu and then proceeded to wait for it for a long time. I understand the farm-to-table concept, but hadn't realized that the food might literally be coming from a farm to your table. The food was okay. The garlic soup was nice. The avocado toast was decent but I've had better. The burger was a little on the bland side. The salmon Benedict was good. The hanger steak was particularly tender for hanger steak. And then it was time for dessert. Or was it? As mentioned, our waitress had gone from table to farm. Or Canada. At some point we flagged down the nice hostess-waitress and ordered dessert.Were this a screenplay, this would be where I put the montage of my family waiting for said dessert. There would be shots of us talking, looking around, the kids kicking each other under the table, the taking of Mother's Day photos, chatting with our neighbors and generally looking like people wondering where the hell dessert was. At some point a waiter came to tell us that our desserts would be out soon. Time is relative. One man's 'soon' is another man's 'long time.'  Two hours and ten minutes after we'd been seated, the desserts made it to the table. I took the opportunity to ask for the check, lest our waiter decide that he too was going to retire from his career during the course of our patronage. I left a decent tip only because I hoped it would reach the deserving hostess-waitress and our new waiter friend. If it didn't, then there's no justice in the world.",1,16,2,Brian S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",120,87,7

We all ordered the $25 brunch prix fixe, which was a couple dollars cheaper than ordering the meal and drink separately. I split the fried chicken sandwich and the meat trio, both of which were decently prepared, but the fried chicken was far better. It was dark meat sandwich that was very delicately battered, and it went very well with the cole slaw and sauce.

But color me surprised! Everyone we met was very charming. And when we got too cold outside, they accommodated us by finding a spot for us inside. And when my colleague had to walk outside to be on a call, the bartender and I just chatted up a storm and even kept my colleague's food warm. Which reminds me, the food! We shared the charred romaine and both got the pork. Both were SO good.

3.0,2/3/2017,"This review is for last night during restaurant week. I really wanted to give this place 4 or 5 stars, and I was really excited to love it, but a few glaring issues got in the way. And I very rarely give bad reviews! We went for the restaurant week dinner. PROS: when we actually got our food, it was quite good! I especially enjoyed the skate entree. It was perfectly crispy on the outside and unbelievably bursting with tender juicy flavor on the inside. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! The complementary bread was also amazing. I wish I could buy it in a store and eat it at home. The chicken appetizer was also bursting with flavor and absolutely delicious. The chocolate mousse was just ok, but the ice cream trio tasted so fresh and the creaminess was perfect. also in terms of service, I got there quite late because a problem with the subway rails and being stuck, and they were very gracious and never hassled my friend, and let her go to the table. CONS: A note to make is don't trust the menu...either online or in the restaurant. I realized after the meal was over that we never got the promised amuse bouche at the beginning. At that point, it was too late to ask, but it seems they are doing false advertising by saying they include an amuse bouche. Also, there were several items on the menu that were not actually available. This would normally not be a huge issue, but during restaurant week, you only have a few choices to begin with, so the menu was even more restricted than I thought it would be. A restaurant with good customer service would have offered that we could pick an item from the regular menu to make up for it, but they did not, which was disappointing. The service was also spotty but to be fair the place was packed. It was difficult to get the waiters attention to give our order and once he did come, he wandered away several times without any explanation while we were trying to order seemingly to go to another table or talk to another waiter? It was no big deal, but he never explained. Other than that, he was very nice and asked us how we enjoyed each course and was very attentive afterwards.",0,0,0,Danielle N.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",40,25,14

4.0,1/25/2017,"Proudly featuring the most trendy concept ""farm-to-table"", Blenheim has had all its ingredients originated from the Catskills farm, marking it as the unique new American place in west village ny. As everyone has probably already talked enough upon their signature chicken dishes, I would like to strongly recommend the freshly prepared beef tartare. Carefully smashed, the beef tartare sat itself quietly on a piece of sourdough, and made with it a perfect combination. It was well-seasoned too. Make sure someone from your party is ordering it! The fried chicken app was much better than the main course roast chicken, as the former slightly carried a sweet flavor, and I thought it went well with the chicken meat. Dessert was a bit of let-down, at least my chocolate cake was not as impressive. Some of the non-RW dishes were quite interesting too - squid ink pasta with uni, grilled duck, and the organic egg dish.",11,9,10,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1221,1748,5633

1.0,9/24/2016,"Hands down, the customer service at Blenheim was both TERRIBLE and RUDE in a way I have never quite experienced.  I will never go back to this establishment and highly recommend that others avoid it at all costs.I went to Blenheim on a Saturday night (last night, 9/23/16) with a date.  We got there and were seated outside around 10PM.  We ordered wine and appetizers.  As we approached 11PM, the waiter kept coming over and asking us if we wanted anything else, even though we were still working on our wine.  I asked him if they were trying to give us a hint that we had to leave, and he said no, and that there was no rush.  Then within a few minutes he came back and gave us a check and while reiterating that there was no rush, asked me if I could pay the bill right away.  Even though I was annoyed, I obliged.  Within a few minutes, while still drinking our wine, the lights were literally SHUT OFF on us with no warning.  We were now sitting in the dark while drinking our $18 a glass wine.  This occurred AFTER I payed the bill and left him an 18% tip on a bill that was over $100.  This, in and of itself, was preposterous.  In hindsight, I wish I had left nothing for a tip.  Eventually another person working at the restaurant came outside and started breaking down the area around us.  Removing tables and chairs and closing umbrellas.  What was happening was so ridiculous that my date and I were actually laughing at it.  We couldn't believe what was happening.  Then, to really top of this ""amazing"" display of customer service, the waiter came back over to us and said something to the affect of ""OK, that's it, we're gonna have to grab those chairs from you"" and then walked off.  As you can imagine, I was pretty upset at this point. ""You are gonna to take the chairs away from us?""  Keep in mind, it was about 11:30PM on a Friday night!But it didn't end there.  The manager then came out and told us they were closed and that we had to leave.  I said, ""You are telling us we can't enjoy the rest of our wine?  We have to leave?""  He said, ""We are closing.  We close at 11PM"".  I said, ""You close at 11PM on a Friday night in the West Village?  It's 11:30.  We'd like to finish this expensive wine we paid for.  I had a bill for over $100, we aren't finished, and you are kicking us out.  This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  You are shutting lights off on us.  Telling us you have to take the chairs we are sitting on away from us.  This is the very definition of bad business. We'd like to finish our wine.""  He said, ""You can finish your wine.  But we are closing.""  I said, ""We will finish our wine and then never come back here again, OK?""  The whole time this conversation was happening he seemed totally baffled by why I was upset.  He then said, ""OK"", and walked away.   Stay away from this establishment.  It's a joke.",2,1,0,Neil H.,"New York, NY",0,4,0

A New Yorker guest told us that he had not have eaten duck that good in New York for 30 years! The dinner, the service - their staff were incredibly cheerful, and the ambience - everything was perfect from its design to its location - and we talked about how good our dinner was, for days!Ours was a destination wedding so we did not have the chance to see the venue beforehand, so it was a risk that we took.

4.0,6/5/2016,"As someone who lives just a few hundred yards from Blenheim, I agree with the reviewers who think this place is highly underrated.  The dinner menu (which is very seasonal) is consistently on point, with a prix fixe four-course tasting menu that gives you access to a handful of their best items at a ridiculously affordable price (side note, the roasted duck is a must).  While their spring/summer menu is quite good, be sure to swing by during late fall to sample one of the best autumn menus in New York City (they do more with pumpkin than you ever thought imaginable).  The brunch menu is also well diversified and consistently good, ranging from your traditional eggs benedict to the blenheim pork trio.  One of the best parts of the Blenheim experience though is the atmosphere itself.  Playing off the farm to table theme, the farm house/barn style decor is quite cozy and welcoming.  Located on a very popular corner in West Village, the crowd tends to be quite youthful, with outdoor seating that makes for a tremendous people watching spot during brunch hours.  Shockingly, reservations are fairly easy to come by and walk-ins are generally accommodated very quickly.  The only downside is that the service tends to be on the slow side, but still very attentive and helpful.  A must go.",0,0,2,Matt K.,"New York, NY",262,93,22

The only appetizer I wasn't too fond of were the shishito peppers - which were a little too undercooked for my party's liking. The fried chicken and salmon tartar were fantastic. For the middle course, the lobster tortellini and angalotti were also awesome. Only order the ladder for you're okay with a bit of sweetness though.

The tools hanging on the walls were the tools they used to make the place. How cool is that? Which brings me to my next point.

The food was absolutely fresh and delicious. The only dish I was not over the moon about was the egg white omelette. It could be I was not too impressed with it because, well, it is an egg white omelette, but I did find it a bit dry and salty.

3.0,3/14/2016,"This is really a 3.5, more related to the whole ""getting in the door"" than the food. I came here on Saturday night with a group of friends, after walking by with my fiance earlier in the week and thinking the menu was worth a shot. The food was good, but service was a tad slow and making a reservation was a total disaster. First the bad: I called on a Monday to see if the restaurant could accommodate 7 people at 8pm on Saturday. I was told that they only do a private room for 7+ and weren't sure they could accommodate us, but they'd take my info and call back. I never heard anything back. I called again on Thursday to see what was up and a different person said that for 7 people we'd need to talk to  the events person Carol and that there was a $75 tasting menu. They took my email this time and said Carol would email me that night or the following day at the latest with the menu so we could finalize our plan. No email arrives, but on Friday night I get a call confirming a reservation for 7 people on Saturday at 6:45pm?! Very confusing. I called (yet again) and this time someone read the menu to me over the phone and changed the reservation to 8pm. Glad we were finally able to get it sorted with 3 phone calls and some perseverance, but it really shouldn't have been that complicated. A less determined person would have given up and the restaurant would have lost out on a pretty big bill.The good: When we arrived the space was nice and we had a cool little room. The food was very good, with well balanced flavors that were simple enough to let the ingredients shine but still super unique and complementary.  It took forever for drinks to arrive and for the server to take our orders, but once everything was ordered things moved along at a good pace. I had the Blenheim salad which was pretty delicious and simple, with fresh veggies and shaved gouda, and a refreshing citrus vinaigrette. I tasted the chestnut papardelle pasta which was bomb, with a hearty serving of crispy pork and mushrooms. The chef's choice was a seared scallop with pearled couscous and some sort of marmalade butter compote. I had the short rib as my main which I ate with a fork only (yum!) and which was a good size of meat (If I had just gotten that and not the other apps, I would have still been hungry because it came with like a tablespoon of mashed potato puree and 2 sunchokes). Dessert was the chocolate cremeaux which I also was a fan of...they were out of the wine we wanted but had a good alternative.

5.0,2/11/2016,"so me and my so. just recently moved around this area in West Village and let me just say. what a find, Blenheim is. we walked in on a Tuesday night and the place was very lively and we were thinking about going over to corner bistro instead (heard great things about that place) since we didn't make a reservation ahead of time. we were told not to worry and the hostess led us to the bar to get us comfortable while our table was being set. the bartender, Amber, expertly made my partner a walk in the woods cocktail, one of their signature I've been told, and chose out a nice glass of red for me. I think too many times in the city there are young bartenders that serve to be eye candy but can't produce the drinks. Amber clearly knows what she's doing. before even half the glass was sipped we were led to a table and seated and made comfortable before our server Drew, came and introduced himself. Drew was the epitome of great service. There when you need him, not intrusive, got one of his team right on the water pour and answered questions before they were even asked. I thought I was having my mind read! the kitchen offers a small but diverse menu, and we wanted to try it all to be honest, so we went with the 4 course pre-fix menu. very similar concept to batard where the diner is in charge of his own pre fix and able to choose off the menu  (another great restaurant).so we both got a choice of snack, appetizer, entree and dessert.even before anything we chose came out a canapé of baked oysters. imagine a plump oyster with a creamy sauce and bursts of acid. wow.I had the fried chicken and my partner the tuna escabesce. the chicken is insanely crispy. it gets spicy then a cool peanut sauce takes you down and a refreshing pickled slaw to get you ready for the next bite. the tuna looks like a jewel. pieces of pickled vegetables adorn the plate with avocado and carrots. I thought it was weird to have avocados in an escabesce. (I lived in Spain a year and half so I've eaten couple in my life) but it works! it provides just enough creamy fat to balance the acid and I was blown away!next we had the scallop and foie gras. and the foie grass terrine  (can you tell we hate foie? :)) the cold foie preparation was unlike any other traditional foie I've seen. it's so amazingly smooth. layered between a black fruit jelly and served with rich and buttery brioche and salad. I wish all my friends in California can see this. maybe they'll remove their ban on it! the hot foie was equally as amazing. perfectly seared scallops with a acidic sweet chutney and a nice foie sitting right on top. beautiful red sauce with nuts and fruits. I'll leave it at that.duck is cooked to perfection here. a cute layered potato cake is unexpectedly creamy and rich. a sweet and sour duck jus and a celebration of kumquats. possibly my new favorite citrus.short ribs here are classic 101. silky mashed potatoes, fried wild mushrooms and adorable Sunchokes, which its from their farm apparently, and the most amazing glaze. no need to add any more it's delicious and the sayings right. there's a reason why classics are classics.I opted for the sorbet trio ( quite full to be honest!) and my husband got the Panna cotta. this place is full of surprises as they tell me all the ice creams are made in house like everything else. this place seats like 40 people max. who is making all these?!! my favorite was the plum sorbet. yum! and the Panna cotta is heavenly. again another classic done well. in the end when the check came we were greeted with tiny chocolates from the chef. which of course again I am told is made in house. little balls of boozy caramel burst into my mouth and the deal was sealed. this place is so cute and the staff and the food is out of this world. definitely must come here again after I hit the gym a little bit!",2,0,1,Bobby L.,"New York, NY",0,4,0

2.0,11/28/2015,"We moved to the neighborhood a few weeks ago and kept walking by and wondering why this seemingly cool restaurant was always slow in a busy block. Today we found out.Had brunch for four and started off with awkward service - offered ""house sparkling water"" which sounded as though it was complimentary based on the waitress's phrasing, only to find out it was a ridiculous $6 (and in addition to being pretty flat, the busboy kept pouring regular water over it like another reviewer mentioned). Then we inexplicably were shuffled to another waitress who was completely devoid of any sense of hospitality, scowling and robotic the entire time. When we finally got our entrees (after our simple drinks in a mainly empty restaurant took about 15 minutes) everyone's poached eggs were rock hard. When my husband, who runs restaurants, politely alerted the dour waitress, she said ""oh, so you like your eggs cooked more soft?"" He replied, again politely, that poached eggs are supposed to be soft and runny, that's not a preference. She was exasperated and rude, and took everyone's plates and said ""I guess we'll just have to remake everything then."" No apology. The bizarre man who seemed to be the manager or owner stared at this happening, but never bothered to stop by our table. When the food finally arrived, it was decent. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough to save this place - zero offer of trying to make up for our crap experience with even a minor gesture like taking off the ludicrous water charge that felt like a trick anyway. When the manager/owner came back with our credit cards he didn't even say thank you or goodbye or utter a single word. Charging $150 for one tiny drink apiece and average food that took two rounds to get right with miserable service is an embarrassment, when you could spend less and have a far more enjoyable experience at Cafe Minerva, Mole, Tavern on Jane, Tartine or basically any other place in this neighborhood. You could bring a box of saltines to Cubbyhole and have a much better brunch.Everyone makes mistakes but covering them up by being rude and dismissive is a sure fire way to guarantee that a restaurant stays empty.",10,4,3,s v.,"New York, NY",4,45,2

On the minus side, I paid $12 for the skimpiest fruit salad I've ever seen. It was majority underripe honeydew, and 2-3 tiny pieces of plum. Shameful, especially when there are fresh berries, bananas and other fruits readily available and, as I said, $12?!?!

I was REALLY hoping a second experience would change my mind.Last week my boyfriend and I came for dinner. We ordered three plates based on the server's recommendation: an appetizer, 'Chestnut Pappardelle' and two entrees, 'Roasted Beef Short Rib' and 'Blenheim Pork Two Ways'.We were served bread and butter to start. The butter was exceptionally good (homemade, I believe) but overly salted, which was unfortunate. Most of the food we ordered was also unfortunate. The 'Chestnut Pappardelle' had potential but was almost inedible, due to the amount of salt. (I normally add salt to everything. I promise.) The 'Blenheim Pork Two Ways' had some good meat flavors but the rest of the plate was not memorable and the wilted greens also overly salted. The one notable dish was the 'Roasted Beef Short Rib'. In fact, it was an incredibly crafted plate with very good flavors all around.I understand what Bleinheim is trying to do: farm-to-table, beautiful decor that blends 'local farm' with 'upscale and chic', attentive service, creatively constructed plates with artful presentation... The thing that really tipped the scale in the negative direction was receiving the bill, which with tax and gratuity surpassed $100.

We've been before and it's been better but never great; perhaps it was an off night but I was hoping it would be improving and not on the decline. I won't be trying this place again.",7,2,2,Ramiro J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0

The soup was excellent, and my friend was very pleased with the crudo. Being plant-based, the menu doesn't offer too many options, but three of us ordered the Nature's bounty, and it was absolutely amazing. Tons of flavors, beautifully plated and presented on a big wooden plate. My friend had the asparagus and cockles, and was very pleased. Granted, the portions are not very big, but the food itself and the plating makes up for it. The wine is quite expensive, so we stuck to beer and water. An extra plus for the delicious crisp bread.",4,0,5,Linnea L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,20,1
4.0,8/17/2015,"A happy find! Farm-to-table food that's vegetarian and pescatarian-friendly. Even better, it's served in cozy booth settings with decor that muffles ambient noise. Farm fresh veggies come with frothy poured sauces, and wine selections by the glass are excellent. Restaurant week menu portions and presentation didn't feel rushed, which is a good sign. We're looking forward to returning next time to try the trout, which unfortunately wasn't on the menu the night we visited.",0,0,2,J C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,0

5.0,7/24/2015,"It's been a few days, yet I'm still dreaming about that octopus dish. It was so good! crispy on the outside and tender in the inside, and the flavor was just perfect! I also had the pork trio, another beautiful and well executed dish. Who knew pork can be treated so elegantly, the pork belly melted in my mouth, and the pork loin was the perfect size so I was not overwhelmed by it. I often find pork loin to be dry and boring and never ending, and this was not the case. The beet dish was also great, very fresh and crisp. Definitely will be back. Loved the decor by the way. Only complain was that it was a very hot evening, and although we sat inside, it was still very warm, maybe fix the A/C?",5,0,5,Frank C.,"Bedford-Stuyvesant, NY",169,32,3

2.0,7/22/2015,"I just arrived home from dinner at Blenheim and I'm so irked I had to write a review stat. The wine director, if there is one, should be ashamed. Granted, I have no problem with a condensed list but to not offer any by the bottle choices under $50 is a bit of a shame. Blenheims list crosses the line to criminal. The DMX South African rose, which is spectacular btw, is $8.95 at my local wine merchant..Blenheim price? $52. How in good conscience is that OK? This clouded the rest of my experience. The staff seems very inexperienced, but friendly, does that work for you? We ordered the restaurant week menu which was slightly different from the online version. I get what they're trying to do here...super fresh ingredients, it works but at a slight cost of flavor. The salad was interesting with different greens, blue cheese and candied walnuts, minimal dressing which I like but darn it if the busboy didn't try to take our plates multiple times before we finished. The chicken entree was good, a little bland, a little too well done. The short ribs were meh, nothing special, more a slab of pork and not what you think of when you order short ribs. One of the desserts was a disgrace..the bread pudding was a hard stale chunk of who knows what...not what bread pudding is all about. The chocolate dessert was actually the best part of the meal, a dark chocolate log with sea salt on top. I can't help but feel like Blenheim has kind of given up already?",3,0,2,Leslie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,444,2
5.0,7/16/2015,"A few weeks after my original review, the owner reached out and invited me to return. He mentioned as a new restaurant they are still working out the kinks. I'm glad I returned last night for dinner. We sat outside and dinner started with an amuse bouche. Little bite of watermelon with spice. I believe it was soaked in lime. Very delicious. Complimentary with bread basket which was also yummy with salted butter. Next, we ordered crudités. Not really what I expected as per the description I thought there would be more pickled vegetables (just one), but nonetheless very interesting. For the entree I had cod and my partner chicken. Both meals were delicious. Much more flavor than the original cod I had earlier this year. Adding the jus at the table was a nice touch. The service was fantastic from the moment we stepped in (option of where to sit) to the moment we left. All of the staff we encountered were lovely. My only negative would be the sorbet at the end of the meal. I don't really think it was worth $7 as the portion and taste left me wanting. Overall great experience. I would recommend this restaurant for someone who wants dinner where the main ingredients shine and you leave the restaurant feeling satisfied but healthy.

4.0,6/28/2015,"Came here on a Thursday night with no expectations...I left very full and very content! The concept is farm to table which is quite new to me...I honestly did not expect such fresh ingredients. So what did I love the most? Snacks: -Fried chicken: I LOVE fried chicken and one bite of this blew my mind. The chicken meat was juicy, the skin had a good crunch and the dipping sauce just completed it.-Heirloom beet salad: these were so naturally sweet I thought I was eating fruit. -Charred shishito peppers: charred with orange and sea salt...I wanted to order more! Appetizer: -Grilled octopus: I was so glad this was grilled just right as I've experienced some really rubber-like octopus. I was told this was flash fried so it had a nice crispy layer with a really good sauce made with XO sauce. I point this out because the XO contains dried scallop and dried shrimp which went really well with the octopus. Or it might just be my bias because Canto food uses this a lot. Entree: -Brook trout: the fish was cooked perfectly. There were 2 sauces for this and the pale colored sauce was SO good. Don't know what was in it but it won me over. -Nature's Bounty: a beautifully plated selection of raw, cooked and pickled vegetables that came straight from their farm. I was pretty full by the time this came out so I think I'll enjoy it even more the next time I order this!Overall, really fresh food with excellent sauces and visually appealing dishes.

I went on a Friday evening, the place was busy but not overly crowded. The service was good, not pushy or overly attentive. The food was good, very fresh. I didn't realize they service their own farm upstate. Had the prefix which comes w/ 4 courses, appears to be a decent deal (basically comes up to free desserts). You choice a start, full app, and entree, plus dessert.  Had the farm vegetables salad and the foigras royale (which was interesting, is foigras spread to be dipped in raw veg). Had the pork and short ribs for our two entrees, which were both flavorful and cooked very well.

1.0,6/10/2015,"I almost never write reviews, and I don't think I've really ever written a bad one, but in this case I feel obliged.  I was excited to try this place because I'm passionate about farm to table food and live in the neighborhood, but omg, this place is the WORST!!  Terrible service, tiny overpriced portions, bland pretentious food...The service was AWFUL, and didn't get better even when we complained about it (though they did end up comping most of our dinner in the end).  Every time we asked for something (extra salad dressing for the super boring salad... sparkling water, etc.) they forgot about it and we had to ask for it again.  When we asked for the 2nd or 3rd time about the sparkling water, the water came out with it saying, ""sorry about the water, I had a brain fart"".  What?? What waiter says that in a fancy restaurant? Then when they brought us our entrees, we never saw them again.  After a LONG time we finally tried and tried to flag them down by waving our hands in the air when they were like 2 tables away, but they kept not noticing.  Finally the manager came out and asked how things were going and we were like, well, not good.  We've been trying to order dessert for like 30 minutes.  So, he took our order.  Then the order never came!!! So like another 20 minutes later we had to ask a bus boy to check on it!  Finally it came.  Then the manager came out again, we complained again, he apologized and comped our entrees and our dessert.  He didn't seem very sincere, and was like kind of sheepish.  Apparently they just hired him 2 days ago to try to improve service.  Maybe he'll catch his stride, but so far, not so much.  And then the food:  wtf?  they're charging tons of money and trying so hard to be fancy and ""interesting"" and everything just turns out super boring, and the tiniest portions.  After eating a salad, an entree and splitting a dessert, we both left hungry.  How does that happen!???  The dessert sounded good but was NOT, the chicken itself was fine but what it came with was super weak (a pile of ""wilted"" greens, no real sauce, some broth.  boring.).  The salad was a bunch of interesting greens from their farm, which was nice, but they were in a super bland dressing that was barely even there (my friend was like, ""does this even have dressing on it?"").  It was supposed to have shaved pecorino on it, and it looked like there was a whiff of some, but the tiniest bit that I couldn't even taste.  So, it basically was a plate of plain, undressed greens. And, apparently this place has been open a year, has had bad reviews about their service since the beginning, and they still haven't fixed the problem.  How hard is it to hire a few good people?  All the other fancy restaurants in nyc seem to be able to figure it out... This city is overflowing with capable people who need the work...So, to recap: Terrible service, food that is both pretentious and bland, and overpriced portions so small you leave hungry. Seriously, this place gives farm to table a bad name, and is a waste of one of the best, most special locations in the city!  I will NEVER go back.",4,1,2,Rosemary P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0

Wonderful warm tones and farming accessories make it cozy. It earns 2 stars because we got to sit outside on a Sunday. Espresso was good... But this is the west village, espresso is everywhere. At brunch had an omelette. The Eggs were greasy and served with a side of bland potatoes. I don't eat potatoes so this was based on one taste. Don't really go for bread and theirs was nothing special. Tried the 25.00 boozy brunch and the 10 drink was the best part. My partner had bacon that was half burnt and half undercooked.

4.0,4/8/2015,"I came here for restaurant week. To be honest, I only chose the restaurant because it was featured daily on Eater for an obscene amount of time. The tiny restaurant wasn't too crowded at around 8:30 on a Sunday, and they seated our party of six in a small, almost-private room in the back. It was kind of cute, and did in fact make you feel like you were eating in a barn. The food wasn't particularly spectacular, but so artfully plated that I kind of loved every dish purely on that basis. I read that they changed chefs once again, so I can't really attest to what the food is like now. As for the service, I'm generally not that picky with service unless they're actually outright mean to me. The server we had was obviously new, but fine. I also remember the bartender being pretty nice and kept refilling my water, even though I didn't order a drink as I waited for my friends at the bar. There was a manager/supervisor of sorts who was so insanely nice that it made it a tiny bit awkward...but I'm just an awkward person, so maybe that's just me. And of course it was very much appreciated. Oh! When they take your coats they give you an old-timey key to mark which one is yours.

4.0,3/22/2015,"If there is one thing I loved about Blenheim it definitely is their attention to detail.When checking your coat (sadly a necessity in wintery NY) you don't get a piece of plastic or paper, you get this key which is a detail that says a lot about this restaurant.The outstanding presentation was what most caught my attention. The ambiance was perfect, so was the lighting, noise level as well as the service (mostly).We got started with some oysters and cauliflower custard.We continued with some starters.Chilled Maine Lobster - satsuma tangerine, artichoke, olive oilBeets a La Plancha - yogurt, quinoa and nasturtiumAnd our favorite, the Carrot Crab Soup:  peeky toe crab, fresno chili, espelette pepper.The starters were accompanied with a beautiful cheddar focaccia and gluten free sesame crackers.We followed with the sweet potato gnocchi smoked pumpkin seed, lemon cream, baby herbs.Mangalitsa Pork with oyster mushroom, potato puree, white miso, that night was served with hedgehog mushroom.Hay Smoked Chicken, heirloom carrots, green chili spice, carrot jus.The portions were perfect if you're in the mood for trying a few different things however the mains seemed to be small for the price.The ingredients were excellent, you could taste everything was top quality. If I had to criticize anything, it would be a slight lack of contrast between the dishes. Perhaps I was just expecting some surprise element to stand out and emphasize the distinctiveness of the flavors.Afterwards, we tried to identify our favorite dish of the night, and that is when I realized most dishes were in the same level but also in the same flavor palette. In the end, we found in Blenheim some comfort with great style.

The hostess took our coats and sat us very welcomingly, the server had confident recommendations and good answers to all of our questions. As for the food, you can taste the farm-to-table difference. The vegetables were fresh & flavorful--the brussel sprouts and sunchokes accompanying our mains were great pairs. The cod was a favorite, as was the sweet potato gnocchi. The hangar steak was small, and slightly tougher than expected, but flavor is there and the parsnip adds a great flavor and texture to the dish.

5.0,1/4/2015,"Was recently there for both dinner and brunch. You can tell they have been responsive in listening to customer feedback (and now actively seek it). I've noticed the following changes: 1) new, friendly hostess, 2) revamped menu, 3) larger portions, 4) quicker and more attentive service. For dinner, we had the 4-course tasting. I had the monkfish liver mousse for my canape, the bay scallop for my appetizer, the icelandic lamb for my entree, and the chocolate ganache for my dessert. The first three were very good: prepared well, balanced flavor, tasty. The dessert was unfortunately a little too rich and overbearing. My wife had the kabocha squash cremeux, which was delicious; I wish I had had that. For brunch, I recently had the smoked trout on toast, which was absolutely fantastic. My wife had the omelette, which she also very much enjoyed. Coffee is also excellent, which is an often overlooked detail with other frequented, nearby brunch spots (e.g., Cafe Cluny, Good, etc.)This place still has my favorite ambiance of all places in WV. Well balanced, beautiful decor with enough space between seats to not make you feel like you're on top of each other. This is a huge bonus for the WV.

4.0,12/13/2014,"Decided to check out this place after reading about it in an listicle about the best restaurants in the West Village and this was praised as a very good farm-to-table. Went there in a Saturday evening with a friend around 7 without reservation and we yet we were able to get seated promptly. For the later times, try to reserve a table as the place gets full. Cocktail menu was available quickly but the order taking for the drinks was a bit tardy, and the only time during the evening where we felt a bit unattended. The homemade soda is worth a try. We had oysters on the half-shelf (they don't get seafood from their farm upstate but almost everything else). I had the muscovy duck, which was good and my friend had the strip steak (medium rare) with parsley root, that made the dish. Desert was chocolate ganache which had a chocolate bar on the dense side. (Don't step on a scale after you eat that). Overall the cookery was very good and especially the sides complemented the entrées without being overbearing and reminding of country. The prices, well, what you expected for a West Village joint with a Michelin-star chef. The decor was particularly interesting as it is all expensive wood and in the corner there are farm tools hanging from the wall. The noise level was not too high even with the restaurant being full by the time we finished after two hours.The business model of farm-to-table restaurants? Remains to be seen as raising cattle, ducks, chicken in a responsible way and the planting and growing of vegetables etc. is not inexpensive (they get between 50-80% of the ingredients on the menu from their farm upstate) and we know how unforgiving the restaurant biz is in New York.",9,2,13,Matthias S.,"Manhattan, NY",19,7,1

(he then walked down the street to who knows where.) really. everything was as if they were driving to the farm to retrieve the ingredients except they only harvested the ingredients for that one dish, not all the dishes ordered. ridiculous. the idea of this restaurant is a common and good one yet the communication between the 'staff' and timing is atrocious. i would not give them a second chance, especially after reading other's opinions and that time has gone by and they have not solved and smoothed out the kinks.",3,1,1,Taste2taste O.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0

3.0,9/9/2014,"KenScale: 7.5/10Perhaps no restaurant gave me higher expectations than Blenheim this year. When it first opened in West Village, I was very intrigued by the farm-to-table cuisine with ingredients being sourced from a farm in the Catskills that goes by the same name, as well as the chef who would be in charge (Justin Hilbert from what used to be Gywnnett Street in Brooklyn, a restaurant that I to this day regret not having had an opportunity to visit). After about a month, however, chef Hilbert abruptly left the kitchen and in came another highly touted chef, Ryan Tate (formerly of Le Restaurant in TriBeCa, another restaurant that I regret not having visited before it shut down). With all the turmoil in its early days, I debated whether I should make a visit. I finally did last week hoping that the kitchen turned the corner. Unfortunately, I was less than impressed.I started out with roasted beets and sockeye salmon. Roasted beets had a nice texture, but somehow the temperature was a bit off. Sockeye salmon was hugely disappointing too; instead of fresh fish, each piece tasted like a gummy bear and not much flavor to overcome it. For the entree, I really liked striped bass, a perfectly cooked fish that came with sea urchin sabayon to give an enhanced flavor. On the other hand, hanger steak was not only a bit tough in texture but the seasoning was a bit too much. I understand a lot of restaurants are off on the seasoning when it comes to steak dishes, but the restaurant should know better. I finished with one dessert, and it happened to be the best dish of the night. Fresh berries dessert that came with strawberry and buttermilk sorbet was a very delightful dish that wasn't too sweet with very crunchy and fresh berries.Getting a reservation at the restaurant isn't particularly challenging (given the pedigree of the chef, you would think otherwise). Blenheim has a full bar with some classic cocktail selections. I normally don't talk about services when reviewing a restaurant, but I was slightly put off that the restaurant kept the door open on a warm day (they do have some outdoor seating) and the flies kept coming into the indoor dining area. I complained about it, but the server said there was nothing they can do about it. Anyways, aside from the service, I think Blenheim needs for more work on execution. After all, not all farm-to-table restaurants are created equal.",6,2,1,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738
5.0,9/8/2014,"I had high expectations for Blenheim after Chef Ryan Tate took over because I loved his food at prior gigs Savoy and All Good Things Le Restaurant, and I'm happy to report that Blenheim is farm-to-table at its best: the food reminds me of blue hill in west village, but better. Loved the choice of a la carte and two tasting menus, all at reasonable prices for fine dining and can accommodate either casual meals or special occasions. We had the smaller tasting and found every course delicious and inventive. Presentation was thoughtful, ingredients very fresh and well integrated. We particularly loved the sous vide hanger steak. We could tell that a lot of thought and time were put into this and other dishes. This is a place that foodies will love. Some prior reviews complained about the service, but the restaurant must have corrected all the opening hiccups because the service we received was top notch.  The sommelier was friendly and knowledgeable, the waiters even took time to let us know when they changed shifts, which was thoughtful. We also liked the ambience and decor. Will recommend and go back for sure.",9,0,8,Cheryl D.,"New York, NY",0,2,0
5.0,8/29/2014,"Just back from a superb dinner at this amazing restaurant.  We were lucky to experience the Restaurant Week Tasting menu.  The pork with peaches, farrow, crispy okra along with droplets of a spicy green ""something"" (mint, citrus ... je ne sais quoi...?) was an incredible assembly of little bursts of flavor dancing around a sublime rectangle of carefully cooked pork.  The monkfish too, was exceptional.  As an appetizer, the cream of cauliflower soup with some sort of mushroom, decorated with just enough crunchy almond thingies was also extra special.  The beet appetizer was barely recognizable as beets, and in my opinion, way too small, but still very tasty.  Desserts also outstanding.  This was really an all around amazing show, enjoyed sitting outside in this quite and shady west village refuge.  My only disappointment was that we were offered three breads before dinner, and all three looked absolutely stunning, but we only got to taste the cheddar marmite (I'm not makin this up!!) dinner roll, which also was truly outstanding.  Although Marmite runs in my veins, the same cant be said of the wife and she gobbled hers down as well.Although we did not eat inside, the view of the beautiful room was also quite appealing.  Great service too - kudos!",8,1,7,Jef B.,"New York, NY",1,62,1

Also noteworthy, the presentation.. Instagrammable for sure.I'd say I'd subtract half a star for the cost as it's not normally what I'd pay for a meal, but for the quality food that we got and the incredible presentation, it's worth it every once in a while!",9,2,6,Tessa V.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",13,12,0
2.0,8/25/2014,"Being big fans of Smorgas-Chef, we were anticipating coming to the reincarnation of the WV location, Blenheim.We stopped in for brunch on a Saturday afternoon of shopping in the green market.There were two people seated inside, and a table for two and one for four outside. It was a very quiet day at the restaurant, there were probably more staff than patrons. We were seated promptly but no waiter came over. After a bit the Maitre'd walked over and took our order. We ordered a bottle of sparkling water, two glasses of Mount Eden Wolff Vineyard 2011 Chardonnay, I ordered the potato pancake with poached eggs, my wife a zucchini omelet. The water came promptly..... but not the wine. After about ten minutes of looking around the restaurant the hostess had to inquire with half the staff to figure out where it was.Thew maitr'd brought it over begrudgingly, and here was the problem. Mount Eden Wolff Vineyard 2011 is not an expensive wine. I ordered it at the 21 Club a few weeks back, and even at one of the more pricey midtown restaurants it was $51, at Blenheim they were charging $16 per glass. So far so fair, until he brought the glasses. I have had bigger pours at church. There wasn't more than 3oz in the glass. I found this to be completely unacceptable, and didn't order a second glass after ours were gone in two sips.The food was good. The potato pancake with poached eggs and hollandaise was delicious. My wife really enjoyed her omelet.Food was great but the service was very lacking, and the wine pour put it over the top.

The waitress apologized when we asked for an update which really should have been her queue to comp those (drinks were great btw)3) we had a different server for every food delivery (aps, main, etc). plus different people clearing plates. for the main the server didn't know who ordered what.  Just seemed weird and uncoordinated. overall, i liked it and we weren't in a rush so had a nice time. but i do think the restaurant needs to polish their delivery if they want 5 stars.",5,1,8,Daniel K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0

I had a feeling this would not be a good meal when the amuse bouche came. It was an anchovy foam on egg yolk and tasted as bad as it sounds - fishy cream. I took one bite and quickly put it down. Then came the roasted beets dish. The beets were good but everything else on the plate was too sour/tart or bitter. Again, I just picked off the edible parts. The english pea dumplings smelled and tasted like bland mushy peas (think pea gnocchi). Don't order the pea dumplings. The best dish of the night was the langoustine special on toast.

The food was OVERPRICED given the quality and proportion. AND for two simple brunch dishes (ham), it took the kitchen almost 30-40 min to get them ready. Worst off, they did not have a proper credit card machine when we paid. They had like a paper receipt with handwritten price etc and it also took them like 15 minutes to make that ready. The climax came after a week when my credit card was billed THREE TIMES the amount we paid!!! We called but no one answered!

After planning on a tremont night and it was closed, popped in here... Scaffolding was still up, but that did not scare us away... Walked in around 815, sat at the fairly empty bar... No hooks under the bar, so put our massive bags into the chair next to us along with other patrons umbrellas..Cocktail menu was not too enticing, very few vodka drinks, many strange and not too appetizing sounding cocktails, meanwhile the wines and sparkling were pretty bleak as well... and a bit pricey, even for the West Village... the Cheapest wine was a Riesling for $12? From Michigan?? Isn't Riesling from Germany by definition?!Ultimately ordered a grapefruit vodka, and a grapefruit vodka variation... Neither of which were spectacular... Unfortunately, the experience got worse from there.It was mostly tourists and b&ters (the few patrons that were there), and as a new couple walked in, the manager walked over and asked if we minded moving down a seat at the bar to accommodate two new patrons... We did, and asked if there were hooks as my bag was very large, and we also had another bag with us... He said no, the hooks had not come in yet... So ultimately we had to sit with a massive Celine bag on top of us, which was of no concern to them. Also, apparently asking for a straw to drink the cocktails through was a bit much (as peter also wrote me on here, straws I guess are hard to come by here and you shouldn't ask for one).Given we live half a block away, I found the complete lack of customer service and fact that they would have no hooks and expect patrons to sit with a massive bag on your lap (after having you move) fairly disappointing and surprising.... So sitting with a massive bag in your lap and another at your feet, subpar cocktails, and pretty ineffective service = will not return despite the convenience and proximity, and quite saddened that there is not another great option on the block...

2.0,5/29/2014,"Blenheim was lousy.We had a 915pm reservation on a Thursday night, and we were seated right away - all fine.The waiter recommended a rum-based cocktail which he described as ""clean"". It was not good - but that's a difference of opinion.We ordered an appetizer (the ferns) and a main (the beefsteak) and made it very clear we were splitting everything.The food took ~30 minutes to come out - so long that I had to ask. Rather than sequencing, they brought both dishes out at once. The ferns were fine - dripping in dressing, but fairly crunchy. The steak was truly awful - barely warm, very chewy, sauce unevenly distributed. Absolutely subpar - and frustrating, as the table next to us clearly had a very good steak.The service was inattentive at best. We asked for a second steak knife - a reasonable ask, considering we were clearly splitting; the waiter disappeared for 10 solid minutes, eventually just dropping a steak knife to my right without comment.  All of which would have been forgivable if the restaurant were a) busy (nope, fairly quiet) or b) understaffed (not at all - there were a ridiculous number of servers, so many that they spent much of the time wandering around in the kitchen, which I could see from our table).Poor execution and very expensive - one drink, one app, one main for $75.

5.0,5/23/2014,"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday this week. I was a little nervous because there is not much information about the place so far since it is so new. Anyway, I made a reservation we were not let down. The restaurant is small but a standard size for NYC. The décor was nice and fit well with the aesthetic of the place. The lighting was low but comfortable, and the music was perfect--not too loud. Overall a pleasing atmosphere. If you get the table by the window like we did you will be happy.The staff were all very friendly and easy to talk to. They could have checked in on us a little quicker than they did sometimes but it didn't bother me too much because I wanted to take my time with everything. They offered us a complimentary liver mousse to start and when we left gave us a treat to take home.For drinks I would recommend the gimlet. If you are a fan of this cocktail you won't be disappointed. ($15) We also had a glass of the High West whiskey, the Paloma (mescal cocktail), and the pinot noir. For dinner we started with the crab and artichoke dish. This could be my favorite thing we ate. The sauce that was on top was amazing! Everything was cooked well and worked well together. We shared the steak (Asparagus, Morels and Dill Havarti). The steak was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. We also shared the Lamb (Roasted Spinach and Mentholated Yogurt). Served with a piece of lamb as well as a piece of lamb belly. Delicious! The entrees were about ($28) though we picked the more expensive ones.At the end of the night we left pleased and our bill was about $140 before tip. Would definitely love to come back some time.",0,0,0,Nicole W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0
5.0,5/19/2014,"Opening night! (I even made the honor of being customer #1.) Saw it on Timeout NY and decided to pop by with a friend after work (how could I possibly resist farm-to-table?). Overall, an outstanding experience. Everything we ordered was great. I ordered the gimlet (with ice plant!) to start. We also ordered two small plates and a large plate, which we enjoyed. But the real winner was the rhubarb and celery dessert. It is definitely one of the top two best desserts of my life (tied only with Boulud Sud's Grapefruit Givré).Looking forward to our next visit, for sure!",13,1,6,Allison E.,"Capitol Hill/Southeast, Washington, DC",27,15,0
